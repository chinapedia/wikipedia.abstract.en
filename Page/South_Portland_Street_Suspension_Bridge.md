South_Portland_Street_Suspension_Bridge,_Glasgow,_2018-06-30_panorama_1.jpg.png The SOUTH PORTLAND STREET SUSPENSION BRIDGE is a suspension-type footbridge across the River Clyde in Glasgow, Scotland linking the City Centre on the north side to the Laurieston and Gorbals districts on the south side.

S_Portland_Street_Suspension_bridge_in_Glasgow_looking_south_early_April_evening.JPG The bridge, made from wrought iron with arched sandstone towers at either end, has a suspension span of 414 ft;[1] the bridge deck is 13 ft wide. It was built between 1851 and 1853, replacing a temporary wooden bridge on the same site (used from 1832 to 1846) designed by Robert Stevenson.[2][3] Its structure was modified in 1871 and it has been refurbished on several further occasions, including repair work by _Sir William Arrol & Co._ in 1926.[4]

The bridge is so named due to being the continuation of South Portland Street in Laurieston; however it is perpendicular to the better-known Carlton Place[5] (a well-preserved cobbled street of Georgian terraces dating from the early 1800s) and so is sometimes known as _Carlton Place Bridge_ or simply _Glasgow Suspension Bridge_ although there is another bridge of this type upstream nearby. Both the bridge[6] and the buildings of Carlton Place[7] are category A listed.
