The following is A LIST OF THE WACHOWSKIS' UNPRODUCED PROJECTS in roughly chronological order. During their long careers, The Wachowskis have worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under their direction. Some of these projects fell in development hell and are presumably or officially canceled.


1990s

_Plastic Man_

In 1995, The Wachowskis wrote a script for a film adaptation of the Plastic Man comic book series.[1][2] The film was planned to be developed by Warner Bros.. However, due to unknown reasons, the film was never made, although the script was finally leaked online by Yahoo! Movies columnist and reader Greg Dean Schmitz in June 2003, one month after the release of _The Matrix Reloaded_.[3]

_Vertical Run_

Around 1996, The Wachowskis wrote a script for a film adaptation of Joseph R. Garber's thriller _Vertical Run_.[4] However, the film wasn't made, and after Garber's subsequent death in 2005,[5] it's very unlikely that the film would be made.

_Carnivore_

This was the first film script written by The Wachowskis.[6] It has been described as "a Corman-style, low-budget horror movie that dealt with cannibalism or, more specifically, millionaires being eaten by cannibals".[7] The writing was well received and the script made the duo minded, although interest in making the film was low as executives told them "This is a bad idea. I can't make this. I'm rich." On April 6, 1999, a week after _The Matrix_ opened in theaters, _Variety_ reported that Trimark was considering purchase of the script and that they were in talks with George Romero to direct it with production slated to begin in August.[8] In April 2001, it was reported that The Wachowskis were producing it for Lionsgate and looking for a director surfaced again (meaning Romero's departure from the project),[9] and in August 2003 a second time, with their go-to cinematographer Bill Pope supposed to be making his directorial debut with it.[10] However, to the disappointment of The Wachowskis, the film was never produced.

_Hard Boiled_

On August 22, 1999, five months after the release of _The Matrix_, it was reported that The Wachowskis were considering an animated film adaptation of the _Hard Boiled_ comic book series, in which Geof Darrow, the conceptional designer of _The Matrix_ trilogy, participated as cartoonist.[11] However, Bleeding Cool later reported that the project was cancelled due to the fact that the _Hard Boiled_ creator Frank Miller didn't want to see his creation as an animated film.[12]


2000s

_King Conan: Crown of Iron_

On November 6, 2000, _Variety_ reported that The Wachowskis were working with Warner Bros. to make a film reboot of _Conan the Barbarian_, due to the unsuccessful reception of _Conan the Destroyer_. The Wachowskis originally attempted to film _The Matrix Reloaded_ and _The Matrix Revolutions_ and work on this film at the same time,[13] On January 20, 2004, however, via IGN, Lilly Wachowski reported that the film entitled _King Conan: Crown of Iron_ was stalled for years due to her and her sister Lana's lack of interest after finishing the filming of _The Matrix_ sequels,[14] although Lana and Lilly stated that _Conan the Barbarian_ was their favorite movie based on comics.[15]

_Batman: Year One_

Around 2001, Warner Bros. commissioned The Wachowskis the rewrite of the Darren Aronofsky's planned film adaptation of Frank Miller's _Batman: Year One_. However, The Wachowskis' script didn't convince Warner and the project was finally cancelled in June 2002 in favor of the also cancelled _Batman vs. Superman_.[16]

_Shaolin Cowboy and the Tomb of Doom_

In 2008, The Wachowskis were reported of being working with Madhouse to make an animated film adaptation of the _Shaolin Cowboy_ comic book series.[17][18][19] The film's title was eventually revealed as _Shaolin Cowboy and the Tomb of Doom_.[20] Darrow and Japanese director Seiji Mizushima were attached to direct the film.[21] However, according to Darrow, the film's production was finally left unfinished after the lack of money.[22]

_Speed Racer 2_

Before the release of _Speed Racer_, _Variety_ stated that a sequel to the film could happen if the film had a good box office performance.[23] In 2008, a possible sequel was contemplated by The Wachowskis when Rain asked them why his character was so happy that Speed won; they replied it could be explained in the next film. Rain said he was hired for three years, while noting that did not guarantee a sequel would be released.[24] Christina Ricci also considered it a possibility; she stated "When we [the cast] were all leaving, we were like 'write the sequel!' 'We want to come back'. And they [the Wachowskis] were like, 'I know. I know. We're going to. Don't worry'", adding she would like more action scenes for her character.[25] The producer Joel Silver said that the Wachowskis "have a great story idea for a sequel" but that it is "a great idea for a sequel if it makes sense to make it."[26] However, any sequel to this film was not made, implying that the project was cancelled.

_Cobalt Neural 9_

In December 2009, Arianna Huffington tweeted pictures of herself on the set of "a Wachowskis movie on Iraq from the perspective of the future".[27] _CHUD.com_ reported what the Wachowskis were doing was camera tests and shooting of test footage on the Red digital camera for a future movie, but not shooting the movie itself.[28] In March 2010, Jesse Ventura said he had also shot for the project right before Huffington. Both of them were dressed as people from roughly 100 years in the future and they were asked to improvise without a script about the Iraq War.[29] In May 2010, _Deadline_ reported the movie was going to be a hard-R story that would begin in the future but move back to the then-current war in Iraq and center on the homosexual relationship between an American soldier and an Iraqi. The Wachowskis completed the script and were searching for funding to direct it.[30] In July 2010, the movie was reported to have begun casting under the codename _CN9_ (or _CN-9_),[31] and in August 2010 the full name was revealed as _Cobalt Neural 9_.[32] In September 2010, _Vulture_ posted additional details about the script and revealed the movie would be told in found footage-style from the perspective of digital archaeologists from the future. An estimated $20 million budget was reported although they were told a studio would "never, ever" finance it but perhaps the Wachowskis could do it themselves.[33] In December 2010, _The Hollywood Reporter_ reported that Salman Rushdie and Cornel West had also shot talking head sequences along with the previously reported involvement of Huffington and Ventura but the Wachowskis were currently looking into other movies because of troubles financing it.[34] Later, in September 2012, Aleksandar Hemon wrote about the making of _Cloud Atlas_ and recalled he too was one of the people the Wachowskis had invited to interview in December 2009, to help inspire the script of _Cobalt Neural 9_.[35] The last update on the film was in October 2012, when the Wachowskis were asked about it and they responded they were still keen to make it, because they had invested both financially ($5 million) and emotionally into it, even if that ends up being in a different form than film.[36]


2010s

_Hood_

In December 2010, _The Hollywood Reporter_ wrote that The Wachowskis were planning to direct for Warner Bros. a script of theirs called _Hood_, which was a modern adaptation of the Robin Hood legend. The Wachowskis were said to be reaching out to actors, including Will Smith.[37] However, no update was made after this, implying that the film likely had been canceled.

_The Matrix 4_

On January 23, 2011, Mental Floss reported that The Wachowskis had spoken with Keanu Reeves to make two more films of _The Matrix_, with Reeves reprising his role as Neo. However, it was later discovered that the news were false and that it was all a hoax from Ain't It Cool News.[38] Despite this, on September 28, 2013, Mental Floss reported that during an unspecified moment, The Wachowskis planned to make a fourth _The Matrix_ film, but the project was cancelled.[39] On June 2016, producer Joel Silver was asked if any other _The Matrix_ movie would be made in the future, to what he said that he stated;

  We haven’t talked about it yet. I hope there’ll be a time we can do that at some point. That was very seriously designed as three stories and that was it, but we’ll see what happens.[40]
