History

Intelligence Node was incepted in 2012 as a consulting company that focused on providing expert consulting to the retailers in the e-commerce apparel domain. The company was co-founded by Sanjeev Sularia,[2] CEO of Intelligence Node and Yasen Dimitrov, COO of Intelligence Node. Sularia previously worked as the CFO for Exclusively.in (an e-commerce portal for upscale fashion), now acquired by Snapdeal, and CFO for Shersingh.com (a private label e-commerce fast fashion portal), now under Myntra. While Yasen was the Practice Leader at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in their London office. Prior to this, he was the Head of Research and Analytics in a boutique financial research lab in London. Intelligence Node began its operations with seven members at Mumbai, India. The company currently has offices in London, New York City, and Dubai along with Mumbai.[3]

The enterprise expanded its consulting business into retail analytics that provides real-time information to the retailers by enabling them to gain access to pools of data generated globally, and also resources to synthesize them. Retailers can use the products as trading platforms where they can implement a dynamic pricing model based on accurate and reliable insights.[4]

The technology engaged by the company encompasses a SaaS-based platform that scans the internet for the pricing strategies and cataloging models of over 1 billion products of more than 130,000 brands sold in around 1,100 categories.[5]

In 2015, Intelligence Node raised $4 million in Series A funding from New Enterprise Associates and Orios Venture Partners[6] and now plans to expand its operations in the US and Europe.[7]

As a part of its global expansion strategy, Intelligence Node has integrated multilingual support[8] into its applications. Currently, the platforms support 29 major languages, which represent around 95% of the total global GDP. It will enable the company to serve a global clientele and make its processes internationally scalable.

In Feb 2017, Intelligence Node announced the recent acquisition of three new global customers,[9] namely UK's MADE.com, Brazil's Mobly, and India's Tata CLiQ.
