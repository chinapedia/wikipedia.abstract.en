LOUISA ANNIE BICKNELL (1879 - 25 June 1915) was an Australian civilian and military nurse who died while serving in World War I.[1]


Early life

Bicknell was born in Abbotsford, Victoria, Australia in 1879, the seventh of twelve children of Eliza and John Bicknell.[2] She initially learnt dressmaking, but later decided to train as a nurse. She trained at Mooroopna Hospital and worked at the Womenâ€™s Hospital.[3]


Career

Bicknell opened her own private hospital at Bairnsdale and nursed there for eight years.[4] In April 1915 she enlisted in the Australian Army Nursing Service and embarked for Egypt on the _Kyarra_. She was stationed at Heliopolis, Cairo at the No.1 Australian General Hospital.[5]


Death

Bicknell sustained a scratch on her hand while nursing wounded soldiers, and developed pyaemia, a type of infection.[6][7] She was ill for about six days, and died on 25 June 1915.[8][9] Before she died, it was reported that she said: "How hard it is to die with so little accomplished, but I would go through it all again to help."[10]

Bicknell is buried in the Cairo War Memorial Cemetery.[11] She is remembered on the Bairnsdale Shire honour roll and on a memorial to overseas nurses who died in World War I at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital in London.[12]
