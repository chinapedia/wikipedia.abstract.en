Denton was the 2015 Barbara Ward Lecturer, challenging policy-makers, researchers, and academics in London to reexamine Africa and its relationship to climate change.[13] She is a speaker at the 2016 Borlaug Dialogue International Symposium, one of several "Women Leaders Driving Agricultural Transformation in Africa".[14]


Early life and education

Fatima Denton was born and raised in The Gambia. After primary and secondary schooling in Banjul, she completed a wide-ranging array of undergraduate studies at Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar, Senegal (humanities), the University of Besançon, France, (applied linguistics and interpreting), the University of Paris – la Sorbonne Paris IV (humanities) and the Écoles des Hautes Études Internationales et Politiques (HEIP) (international relations).[15] She earned her PhD in political science and development studies from the University of Birmingham (UK).[16][17][18]


Career

Fatima Denton worked as a policy analyst and project coordinator with the energy program of Enda Tiers Monde in Senegal.[19] Her work addressed issues including sustainable development, climate and gender,[20] climate change vulnerability and adaptation, food security, local governance, water, and energy poverty[21] in the Sahel.[22][23]

Fatima Denton worked as a senior energy planner with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) at Risø Centre in Denmark.[24] She was a member of UNEP's Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel. She has paid particular attention to the role of women, pointing out their absence from planning and development processes, the unequal impact of disasters and climate change given gendered labour roles and social status, and the need to include women in developing effective energy policies.[25][26] Solutions cannot solely focus on technology and infrastructure; they must also consider community-focused research and analysis of multiple socio-economic and political-institutional factors leading to vulnerability.[27]

Fatima Denton joined the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) in 2006, where she has been a leader in strategies for climate change adaptation.[28]
