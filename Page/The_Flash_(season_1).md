It is a spin-off from _Arrow_, existing in the same fictional universe, and was produced by Berlanti Productions, Warner Bros. Television, and DC Entertainment, with Andrew Kreisberg serving as showrunner.

The series follows Allen, portrayed by Grant Gustin, a crime scene investigator who gains super-human speed, which he uses to fight criminals, including others who have also gained superhuman abilities. Gustin is joined by main cast members Candice Patton, Danielle Panabaker, Rick Cosnett, Carlos Valdes, Tom Cavanagh, and Jesse L. Martin. _The Flash_ was picked up for a full season by The CW in October 2014, and filming took place primarily in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

It also became The CW's second-most watched series premiere ever, behind _90210_, and the third-highest rated in the 18–49 demographic. The first season finished as the 118th ranked show, with an average viewership of 4.62 million, making it the most watched series ever on The CW, and also the highest rated series among men 18–49 and men 18+ ever on the network.

Production

Development

On July 30, 2013, it was announced that _Arrow_ co-creators Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg, _Arrow_ pilot director David Nutter, and DC Comics CCO Geoff Johns would develop a television series based on the Flash for The CW, and it would detail Barry Allen's origin.[18] Kreisberg revealed after the announcement that Allen would first appear as a recurring character on _Arrow_ in three episodes of season two—all written by Berlanti, Kreisberg and Johns—and the last of the episodes would act as a backdoor pilot for the new show. Kreisberg added that Allen would be a forensic scientist and the introduction of his superpowers, as well as the reactions to this, will be very human and grounded. Johns stated that the character of the Flash in the show would resemble his comic book counterpart, complete with his trademark red costume, and not be a poor imitation. Kreisberg elaborated: "No sweat suits or strange code names; he _will be_ The Flash." While researching the best way to depict the Flash's lightning speed, Johns stated it would not just be the standard "blurring around".[19]

Barry ultimately appeared twice in _Arrow_{{'}}s second season, with the planned backdoor pilot canceled in favor of a traditional pilot by The CW executives, who had been impressed by early cuts of Barry's first two episodes on _Arrow_. This allowed the creative team to flesh out Barry's story and his world on a bigger budget, as opposed to a backdoor pilot's constraint of incorporating characters from the parent show. The pilot was officially ordered on January 29, 2014, and was written by Berlanti, Kreisberg, and Johns, and directed by Nutter.[20][21] On May 8, 2014, _The Flash_ was officially picked up as a series, with an initial order of 13 episodes.[22] Three more scripts were ordered in September 2014 following a positive response to newly completed episodes by executives,[23] while a back ten was ordered on October 21, 2016 for a full 23-episode season.[24]

In July 2014, Johns described the series as "the most faithful DC Comics adaptation ever... We've incorporated almost everything of the mythology into it and added a new backstory with S.T.A.R. Labs."[25] In October 2014, Johns explained that DC's approach to their films and television series would be different to Marvel Studios' cinematic universe, stating that their film universe and TV universes would be kept separate within a multiverse to allow "everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world."[26]

Casting

Grant_Gustin_at_2015_PaleyFest.jpg stars as Barry Allen / Flash]] On September 13, 2013, Grant Gustin was cast in the titular role of Barry Allen / Flash.[27] Andy Mientus, who would eventually be cast as Hartley Rathaway, also auditioned for the role.[28] Gustin began researching the character during the audition process, and reading as many comics as possible. Gustin primarily focused on The New 52 series of comics, because he knew it would be difficult to read everything and he felt the New 52 was the closest to the show's "look and feel".[29] In January 2014, actor Jesse L. Martin was cast as Detective Joe West,[30] while Rick Cosnett was cast as Eddie Thawne and Danielle Panabaker as Caitlin Snow.[31] In February 2014, Candice Patton was cast as Iris West[32] and Carlos Valdes as Cisco Ramon.[33] Patton's casting as Iris caused significant backlash among comic book fans due to Patton being of African descent, while Iris has typically been depicted as a Caucasian woman in comics.[34] Also in February 2014, _The Hollywood Reporter_ reported that the remaining regular roles to be cast were for the parts of Harrison Wells and Hartley Rathaway.[35] On February 10, 2014, Tom Cavanagh was cast as Harrison Wells, with his role described as "a rock star in the world of physics and the mind and money behind Central City's S.T.A.R. Labs Particle Accelerator".[36] It was eventually revealed that Cavanagh's character was actually Eobard Thawne, who stole the appearance of the real Wells (also portrayed by Cavanagh) after killing him, with Matt Letscher portraying Thawne before the transformation.[37]

Several cast members from the 1990 television series appear in the series. John Wesley Shipp, who portrayed Barry Allen/Flash in the 1990 series, joined the cast in a recurring role as Barry's father, Dr. Henry Allen,[38] and Amanda Pays once again portrays a character named Dr. Tina McGee.[39] In the episode "Tricksters", Mark Hamill returns as James Jesse / Trickster and Vito D'Ambrosio plays Mayor Anthony Bellows (a character he played in 1991, but as a police officer), with images of Hamill as Trickster from the 1990 TV series being used in a police report.[40][41]

Design

The Flash costume was designed by Colleen Atwood.[42] While remaining largely faithful to Barry's costume from the comics, it was designed as a more "functional, textured quality" costume than previous live-action Flash ones.[43]

Filming

Production on the pilot began in March 2014, with filming taking place in Vancouver, British Columbia;[44] additional filming for the series takes place in Portland, Oregon.[45] On how action sequences are shot for the series, compared to _Arrow_, Gustin said, "When [_Arrow_] shoot[s] action sequences, pretty much what you see is what you get and they're really doing everything. We do a lot of plate shots that are empty shots of the area we’re going to be in and then they’re putting us in later in post. I do a lot of the fighting. I don’t have to do it full speed and then they ramp it up and a lot of people have to freeze and I keep moving. Then I have to clear frame and step back into frame. It’s really tedious stuff that we have to do. On theirs, they learn fight choreography and they shoot it from the perfect angles and what you see is what you get."[46]

Filming for the rest of the season began on July 11, 2014 and,[47] ended on April 14, 2015.[48]

Crossovers

In March 2014, it was announced that Gustin would not appear in a third episode of _Arrow_ as originally planned. However, Panabaker and Valdes appear in the _Arrow_ episode "The Man Under the Hood" in their roles as Caitlin Snow and Cisco Ramon, respectively. _Arrow_ executive producer Marc Guggenheim stated, "This was something that really came about because obviously Barry is in a coma at the end of ["Three Ghosts"]. That pretty much made it impossible for Barry to appear in [the third episode, as originally planned]... The idea of bringing in [Caitlin Snow and Cisco Ramon] really, really appealed to us because it allowed us to honor our original intention [of] doing something Flash-related around episode 19 or 20 [of season two] without having comatose Barry and basically paying Grant Gustin a lot of money to sit around with his eyes closed just unconscious the whole episode... It allows us to further flesh out the _Flash_ universe in _Arrow_."[49] Gustin had a brief cameo appearance in the _Arrow_ season three premiere, "The Calm".[50] Valdes appeared once again in the season three episode "Broken Arrow",[51] while Gustin appeared in the final episode of season three, "My Name is Oliver Queen".[52] Stephen Amell appears as Oliver Queen / Arrow in the pilot episode.[53] Kreisberg announced that Emily Bett Rickards would appear in the fourth episode as Felicity.[54] Previous _Arrow_ adversary William Tockman / The Clock King (Robert Knepper) was in the seventh episode.[55] Members of The Royal Flush Gang, who previously appeared on _Arrow_, made a cameo appearance in the eleventh episode of the series.[56] Rickards and Brandon Routh as Ray Palmer had scenes in the eighteenth episode, "All Star Team Up".[57][58] Katie Cassidy and Paul Blackthorne, as Laurel Lance / Black Canary and Detective Quentin Lance, respectively, appeared in the following episode, "Who Is Harrison Wells?",[59][60][61] while Amell and Doug Jones as Jake Simmons / Deathbolt appeared in the twenty-second episode, "Rogue Air".[62][63]

"Flash vs. Arrow"

On July 18, 2014, Kreisberg stated that a crossover event would occur in the eighth episode of the first season of _The Flash_ and the third season of _Arrow_, respectively.[64] In early January 2015, The CW president Mark Pedowitz announced the intention to do a _Flash_/_Arrow_ crossover every season, after the success of the first one.[65]

Music

_Arrow_ composer Blake Neely is the primary composer of the series, and was first hired in April 2014 to score the pilot.[66][67] He had previously composed a theme for Barry Allen which was featured in _Arrow_{{'}}s season two episodes "The Scientist" and "Three Ghosts". The theme was titled "The Scientist" when it was released on the _Arrow: Season 2_ soundtrack. According to Neely, "It had to be different [from _Arrow_] ... but it also couldn't be so different that it couldn't fit in the _Arrow_ universe, ... it had to be in a style that could hold hands with _Arrow_."[68] On December 18, 2014, WaterTower Music released a selection of music from _The Flash_/_Arrow_ crossover episodes, as well as two bonus tracks from their respective 2014 midseason finales.[69] The first season, two-disc soundtrack was released on October 16, 2015 by La La Land Records.[70]

All music composed by Blake Neely.[71][72]
