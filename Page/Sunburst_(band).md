Biographical

Their music was a combo of Afro-rock, Zamrock, and Kitoto.[1] Following a radio session in 1973, the band gained national attention. A month after that in July they won a band competition in Dar Es Salaam and grew more popular. They also recorded singles in Kenya. In 1976 they were working on an album.[2] Their album was released in 1977 and around that time they had split up. Prior to the recording of their album, they had recorded a session for Tanzanian radio.[3]

They were managed by Peter Bagshawe.[4] Prior to becoming the manager for the band, Bagshawe originally from Yorkshire was a steam train enthusiast and living in Zambia at the time.[5]

in 2016, the _Ave Africa, The Complete Recordings 1973-1976_ album was released.[6] It was released on Strut Records.[7]
