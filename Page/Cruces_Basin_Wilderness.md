Flora and fauna

The area consists of spruce-fir, ponderosa pine, and aspen forests as well as high elevation grassy meadows.[4] A large fire in 1879 cleared old-growth forest, making room for the aspen forests and meadows present today.[5] The area provides habitat for elk, deer, mountain lion, black bear and coyote.[6] Creeks contain brook, brown, and rainbow trout, as well as beaver.[7]
