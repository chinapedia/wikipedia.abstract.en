FAKE TAXI is a pornography website which produces videos within the reality pornography genre. Founded and currently owned by Jonathan Todd (aka "The YouPorn Guy" and simply "JT").[1][2] who also founded YouPorn,[3] its online presence and assets are managed by Mind Geek along with related websites.


History

The Fake Taxi website originated from Really Useful Ltd in April 2013. Really Useful also managed several other similar pornographic websites.[4] Its United Kingdom-based owner, known as JT, had been named as "CEO of the Year" by adult industry news website XBIZ.[5] Prior to the partnership with MindGeek/Manwin, Really Useful Ltd had functioned independently. Fake Taxi's sister sites include Fake Agent and Public Agent.[6]


Description

Fake Taxi's videos[7] all follow a similar premise that start with a conversation between a taxi driver and a passenger. A typical video would begin with an actress depicting a passenger entering a taxi. The male or female driver, using persuasion fuelled oftentimes by the passenger's lack of funds, finds a way to convince his passenger to engage in sexual intercourse in the back of the taxi. The use of a realistic element such as a cab ride coupled with the raw scene that follows in the back of said car contributed to the site becoming a favourite within the reality pornography genre. Fake Taxi's website is categorised by videos, actresses and scenes from all Fakehub sites. Most content is viewable with paid membership only.[8]


Operations

In 2014, information technology giant MindGeek, then known as Manwin, took over the management of online assets' for Really Useful Ltd.[9] Manwin's involvement meant a surge in internet traffic for the website, leading to its present-day popularity. Websites such as Fake Taxi became affiliated with other well-known websites such as Brazzers, RedTube, Spankwire, Tube8, Pornhub and Twistys, among others.[10]


Statistics

Fake Taxi has released videos to websites such as Pornhub and YouPorn. Those videos have become the most popular on both sites. Fake Taxi boasts a global traffic ranking of 60,965.[11]


Female Fake Taxi

MindGeek and Really Useful announced in February 2016 the launch of Female Fake taxi website.[12] The lead actress is the United Kingdom-based adult actress Rebecca Moore and the videos would follow the same premise of Fake Taxi, except reverse the gender roles wherein the female would be driving and seducing the male (and sometimes female) passenger.
