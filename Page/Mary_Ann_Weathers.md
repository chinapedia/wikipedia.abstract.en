MARY ANN WEATHERS wrote the essay "An Argument for Black Womenâ€™s Liberation as a Revolutionary Force," "one of the pioneering texts" of Black feminism.[1] In it she "challenges the black liberation movement to embrace women's liberation which she hopes would be responsive to the needs of all oppressed people."[2]

The essay was published in Cell 16's _No Fun and Games: A Journal of Female Liberation_ in 1969[3] as well as in Leslie Tanner's 1970 _Voices for Female Liberation_, circulated among consciousness-raising groups in New York City in the 1970s,[4] and in other anthologies in the following decades.

Weathers was a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee's Black Women's Liberation Committee.[5]
