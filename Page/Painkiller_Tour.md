The _PAINKILLER TOUR_ was a concert tour by British heavy metal band Judas Priest which was in support of the album _Painkiller_. It ran from 18 October 1990 until 15 April 1991.

This tour introduced new drummer Scott Travis from Racer X, who joined the band in 1989 after previous drummer Dave Holland's departure that same year. He would remain with the band ever since, surpassing Holland as the band's longest staying drummer.


Pre-tour

A one-off pre-tour show took place on 13 September 1990 in which the band performed at the third annual Foundations Forum in Los Angeles. It was recorded and put together along with the performance from Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson's solo band (recorded on 27 June 1990 in London) as a bootlegged split live album.[1] The setlist for the event is as follows:

1.  "Riding on the Wind"
2.  "Grinder"
3.  "Heading Out to the Highway"
4.  "Between the Hammer and the Anvil"
5.  "Bloodstone"
6.  "Better By You, Better Than Me" (Spooky Tooth cover)
7.  "The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)"(Fleetwood Mac cover)
8.  "Leather Rebel"
9.  "Hell Bent for Leather"
10. "You've Got Another Thing Comin'"

Encore:

1.  "Living After Midnight"

NOTE

-   The live versions of "Better By You, Better Than Me" and "Leather Rebel" appear as bonus tracks on the 2001 re-issues of _Stained Class_ and _Painkiller_ respectively
