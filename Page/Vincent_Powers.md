VINCENT MINFORD POWERS (June 6, 1891 â€“ October 19, 1966) was an American Champion jockey and trainer who competed in both flat racing and steeplechase racing. He rode the winning horse Wintergreen in the 1909 Kentucky Derby and in 1927 and 1928 rode Jolly Roger to back-to-back wins in the most important steeplechase race in the United States, the American Grand National. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2015 as well as the Chautauqua County, New York Sports Hall of Fame in formal ceremonies held on February 16, 2015.[1][2] [3] [4]

In 1908 and 1909, Vincent Powers earned national riding championships when he won more races than any other jockey in United States flat racing.[5] In 1917 he became the first jockey in American racing to win a National Championship in both steeplechase and flat racing.
