_CONQUEST_ (aka _THE CANDLE IN THE WIND_) is a 1928 American aviation drama film, based on the short story _Conquest_ by Mary Imlay Taylor. {{#tag:ref|Prior to publication in book form, Mary Imlay Taylor's novel was serialized in _Munsey's Magazine_ (July–November 1917).[1]|group=N}} The film was made using the Vitaphone sound process. [2]

_Conquest_ was directed by Roy Del Ruth, starring Monte Blue, H.B. Warner and Lois Wilson. The film is a melodrama about a aircraft crash in Antarctica. [3] _Conquest_ is now considered a lost film.[4]


Plot

Two pilots, James Farnham (H.B. Warner) and Donald Overton (Monte Blue) are in love with the same girl, Diane Holden (Lois Wilson ). Attempting to fly an aircraft to the South Pole, the pair run into trouble, tumbling out of control, and crashing in the Antarctic wastelands. Donald's leg is broken, and is left to die by James, whose motives are suspect. He can now have Diane all to himself.

Rescued by the crew of a whaler, Donald is injured but survives. When he recovers, he vows vengeance on the man who left him to die. Returning home, James has proposed and marries Diane, Donald's former fiancée.

Now, scarred and crazed, Donald searches out Dianne and James. Donald persuades William Holden (Edmund Breese), Diane's father, the sponsor of the first flight, to finance another flight to Antartica.

The same crew is resurrected but again the two pilots crash, and this time James is injured, unable to move because of a broken leg. Donald cannot bring himself to leave him, and together they make their way to safety.

On the way back to civilization, James asks Donald's forgiveness and then kills himself, freeing Donald to find happiness with Diane.

Production

Original pre-production work was on a film project entitled _The Candle in the Wind_, that was subsequently changed to _Conquest_.[5] Highly influenced by public awareness of Antarctic aerial exploration by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, _Conquest_ was one of a number of aviation films about Antarctica flights, that were released, including _With Byrd at the South Pole_ (1930) and _The Lost Zeppelin_ (1929).[6] Principal photography on _Conquest_ began on July 30, 1928.[7] To recreate the aircraft used on the Antarctic flight, an "elaborate full-scale Fokker tri-motor mockup" was constructed.[8]


Reception

Aviation film historian Stephen Pendo, in _Aviation in the Cinema_ (1985) characterized _Conquest_ as a typical early "talkie" with a heavy reliance on dialogue, with as much as 70 percent of the film taken up by conversations.[9]

Preservation status

_Conquest_ is considered a lost film.[10] [11]
