DRAGO (stylised as DRAGO) is an independent international publishing house of contemporary art based in Rome, Italy.[1][2][3] The company specialises in street and urban art[4] and has published the works of street photographers, street artists and graffiti writers from around the world. It is frequently involved in exhibitions of contemporary art and acts as the official publisher for various galleries, museums and institutions.[5]


Overview

Drago was founded in 2001 by Paulo Lucas von Vacano as publisher,[6][7] following years working as an Italian-German journalist and president of the Castelvecchi Publishing Company, _Posse_ of Antonio Negri and _Aspenia Magazine_ of The Aspen Institute.[8] He was joined by Domitilla Sartogo as executive director[9] and Nicola Veccia Scavalli as art director.

In the same year, the company published its first book, Brice Marden's _Brice Marden: Opere Su Carta 1964-2001_[10][11] which was followed by the publication of Ed Templeton's _The Golden Age of Neglect_ in 2002. As well as selling out quickly,[12] this title became the professional skateboarder's best-known book.[13] More recently, Drago's books have included Miss Van's _Wild at Heart_; Estevan Oriol's _LA Woman_[14][15] and Boogie's _Ah Wah do Dem_, a book that received a score of 9.6/10 in a recent _Street Hunters_ review.[16] Among other notable books is Letizia Battaglia’s _Anthology_, which has been mentioned on CNN,[17] BBC News,[18] _The Wall Street Journal_[19] and The Daily Beast.[20]

Drago has worked alongside many exhibitors of contemporary art. As the publisher of The French Academy in Rome – Villa Medici, it has been in charge of all publications for exhibitions and artists-in-residence[21] and published many books with its director and art historian, Eric de Chassey.[22] Elsewhere, the company has collaborated with the Outdoor Festival in Rome to produce a five-year catalogue of their exhibitions[23] and the Dorothy Circus Gallery in Rome to create a trilogy of books documenting over three years of exhibitions dedicated to the Lowbrow art movement.[24][25] Among other clients are Nike, The L'Orèal Group, Danesi, The City of Rome, 55DSL, Alcatel and Bulgari.

Drago's most recent project has been an exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art of Rome. Curated by Paulo Lucas von Vacano and Christian Omodeo, _Cross the Streets_ recounts 40 years of street art and graffiti writing in Rome and beyond. It hosts 200 artworks from a number of artists ranging from Shepard Fairey to DAIM including some that came to the museum specifically to produce artwork for the exhibition.[26]

Drago has published 112 titles, of which 12 have sold out.
