GEORGE STANYFORD FRANCIS "FRANK" COWCHER (30 December 1854 – 4 August 1925) was an Australian farmer and politician who was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia from 1904 to 1911, representing the seat of Williams.

Cowcher was born in Barragup, a rural locality that is now a suburb of Mandurah.[1] From a farming background, he became prominent in agricultural circles himself, helping to found the Williams Agricultural Society for the improvement of agriculture in the Williams district.[2] Cowcher served on both the Wandering and Williams Road Boards at various stages, including as chairman of the latter.[3] He entered parliament at the 1904 state election, winning 45.0 percent of the vote as an independent. He was subsequently re-elected with large majorities at the 1905 and 1908 elections, running as a Ministerialist. Prior to the 1911 election, Cowcher's seat was abolished and replaced with the seat of Williams-Narrogin. He attempted to move seats, but was defeated by Bertie Johnston of the Labor Party.[4] He made one final run for parliament at the 1920 Legislative Council elections, but lost to James Greig in South-East Province. Cowcher died in Williams in August 1925, aged 70. He had married Emma Sophie Farmer in 1882, with whom he had four sons and four daughters.[5]
