JENNI RUIZA is a Latina producer, actress, comedian, and writer from Bronx, New York. She is the co founder of Comedy High, a comedy production company.[1] She is a cohost of _Fixx Podcast_.[2]


Early life

Ruiza began her career in middle school where she wrote screenplays. She made herself the starring role of each, alongside the women who inspire her, including Bette Midler, Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep. She wanted to star in TV shows and films, focusing on her love for comedy.


Career

Ruiza wanted to do comedic roles, but eventually led her to become a producer. She participated in Latino Stereotypes for Dummies.[3] This short video was written by Jesenia and uses humor to explore the realities of stereotypes that Latinas face in the entertainment industry. _Saturday Night Live_ served as an impetus for this project, as up until 2017 it did not include a Latina comedienne in its cast.

Projects

The podcast _The Fixx_[4] promotes Ruiza and allows her to voice her opinions. Ruiza takes part in web series, web shorts and commercials. Her works include _Goddesses in the Loo_, _In Case of Emergency_ and Luminosity.[5]
