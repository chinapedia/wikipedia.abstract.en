DANIEL JOSEPH LEAB (August 29, 1936 – November 15, 2016) was an American historian of 20th-century history, particularly the history of American labor unions. He was also long-time editor of three journals and magazines.[1][2][3][4][5]


Early years

Leab was born Daniel Joseph Liebeskind in Berlin, Germany, on August 29, 1936. His mother was Herta Marcus (1901–1981) from the East Prussian town of Gilgenburg (now Dąbrówno, Poland). His father was Leo Liebeskind (1897–1979) of Berlin. Although they had planned to leave Germany for Palestine, instead they emigrated to America in 1938, where they changed the surname from Liebeskind to Leab.[6][7]

In 1957, he obtained a BA from Columbia University. From 1957 to 1958, he attended Harvard Law School. Returning to Columbia, he obtained an MA in 1961 and PhD in 1969. He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the formative years of the American Newspaper Guild (1933-1936).[8][9]

He first taught in the history department of his alma mater, Columbia University. Eventually, he served there as associate dean of Columbia College, a member of the university's central administration, and member of the executive committee of the university's senate.[10][11]

In 1974, he began teaching at Seton Hall University. He began as an associate professor. By 1980, he had become a full professor. He taught 20th-century history for more than three decades there.[12][13]

Provost John Duff appointed him to oversee the university's American Studies Program. He served as acting chairman of the Department of History and two years as chair of University Rank and Tenure Committee. He created and directed its Multi-Cultural Program.[14][15]

He wrote or edited seven books, published more than 90 articles, and lectured extensively in Europe and America.[16][17]

Research topics included labor history, history in film, and cultural conflicts of the Cold War.[18][19][20]

He was a senior Fulbright lecturer at the University of Cologne two times (1977 spring, 1986–1987). He was also visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania (1986 spring) and at the Heim-Hoch-Volksschule, in Falkenstein, Bavaria, Germany (June 1970, July 1972, July 1975).[21]

Editing and publishing

In the 1960s, Leab served as an editorial assistant of and contributing editor to the _Columbia Journalism Review_.[22]

In 1974, Leab became managing editor of peer-reviewed _Labor History_ journal and served for more than two decades.[23][24]

Leab helped administer both Seton Hall and Columbia universities:

    -   2005–2006: Member of Faculty Committee on Criminal Justice and Faculty Rights

Personal and death

Leab married Katharine Kyes Leab, the editor of _American Book Prices Current_ (published by Bancroft-Parkman, Inc.), in 1964. They had three children: Abigail Leab Martin, Constance Rigney, and Marcus Leab.[28]

Leab quoted aphorisms to describe views on history with which he disagreed:

-   Voltaire: "A pack of lies mutually agreed upon"
-   Henry Ford: "More or less bunk"
-   Truman Capote" History teaches us... nothing"

Leab held that such aphorisms merely pointed out "failings of History as a discipline and as a guide." Instead, he expressed his views on history with a quote from poet Maya Angelou:

  History, despite its wrenching pain
  Cannot be unlived, but if faced
  With courage, need not be lived again.[29]

He served as justice of the peace for Washington, Connecticut, from 1999 until his death. He served on the Connecticut Region 12 Board of Education for Bridgewater-Roxbury-Washington (1997–2001, 2003–2004).
