TIGRES ISLAND () is an island in Angola.[1] It is situated in the Namibe Province.


History

It is the largest island of Angola; its area is 98 km². It once had been a small peninsula in Baia dos Tigres known as _Península dos Tigres_ with a well established fishing village named Tigres.

The ocean broke through the isthmus of the peninsula on March 14, 1962 and the water line was severed. Tigres became an island overnight with no water supply. Later Tigres and the pump station at the Cunene river mouth were abandoned, and have become ghost towns slowly being reclaimed by the desert.[2][3]
