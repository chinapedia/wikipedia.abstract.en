TURKISH (), also referred to as ISTANBUL TURKISH,[1] and sometimes known as TURKEY TURKISH, is the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages, with around ten to fifteen million native speakers in Southeast Europe (mostly in East and Western Thrace) and sixty to sixty-five million native speakers in Western Asia (mostly in Anatolia). Outside Turkey, significant smaller groups of speakers exist in Germany, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Northern Cyprus, Greece, the Caucasus, and other parts of Europe and Central Asia. Cyprus has requested that the European Union add Turkish as an official language, even though Turkey is not a member state.

To the west, the influence of Ottoman Turkish—the variety of the Turkish language that was used as the administrative and literary language of the Ottoman Empire—spread as the Ottoman Empire expanded. In 1928, as one of Atatürk's Reforms in the early years of the Republic of Turkey, the Ottoman Turkish alphabet was replaced with a Latin alphabet.

The distinctive characteristics of the Turkish language are vowel harmony and extensive agglutination. The basic word order of Turkish is subject–object–verb. Turkish has no noun classes or grammatical gender. The language has a strong T–V distinction and usage of honorifics. Turkish uses second-person pronouns that distinguish varying levels of politeness, social distance, age, courtesy or familiarity toward the addressee. The plural second-person pronoun and verb forms are used referring to a single person out of respect.

About 40% of all speakers of Turkic languages are native Turkish speakers.The characteristic features of Turkish, such as vowel harmony, agglutination, and lack of grammatical gender, are universal within the Turkic family. The Turkic family comprises some 30 living languages spoken across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Siberia.

Turkish is a member of the Oghuz group of languages, a subgroup of the Turkic language family. There is a high degree of mutual intelligibility between Turkish and the other Oghuz Turkic languages, including Azerbaijani, Turkmen, Qashqai, Gagauz, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish.

The Turkic languages were grouped into the now discredited Altaic language group.


History

The earliest known Old Turkic inscriptions are the three monumental Orkhon inscriptions found in modern Mongolia. Erected in honour of the prince Kul Tigin and his brother Emperor Bilge Khagan, these date back to the second Turk Kaghanate. After the discovery and excavation of these monuments and associated stone slabs by Russian archaeologists in the wider area surrounding the Orkhon Valley between 1889 and 1893, it became established that the language on the inscriptions was the Old Turkic language written using the Old Turkic alphabet, which has also been referred to as "Turkic runes" or "runiform" due to a superficial similarity to the Germanic runic alphabets.

With the Turkic expansion during Early Middle Ages (c. 6th–11th centuries), peoples speaking Turkic languages spread across Central Asia, covering a vast geographical region stretching from Siberia and to Europe and the Mediterranean. The Seljuqs of the Oghuz Turks, in particular, brought their language, Oghuz—the direct ancestor of today's Turkish language—into Anatolia during the 11th century.[2] Also during the 11th century, an early linguist of the Turkic languages, Mahmud al-Kashgari from the Kara-Khanid Khanate, published the first comprehensive Turkic language dictionary and map of the geographical distribution of Turkic speakers in the _Compendium of the Turkic Dialects_ (Ottoman Turkish: _Divânü Lügati't-Türk_).[3]

Ottoman Turkish

Following the adoption of Islam c. 950 by the Kara-Khanid Khanate and the Seljuq Turks, who are both regarded as the ethnic and cultural ancestors of the Ottomans, the administrative language of these states acquired a large collection of loanwords from Arabic and Persian. Turkish literature during the Ottoman period, particularly Divan poetry, was heavily influenced by Persian, including the adoption of poetic meters and a great quantity of imported words. The literary and official language during the Ottoman Empire period (c. 1299–1922) is termed Ottoman Turkish, which was a mixture of Turkish, Persian, and Arabic that differed considerably and was largely unintelligible to the period's everyday Turkish. The everyday Turkish, known as _kaba Türkçe_ or "rough Turkish", spoken by the less-educated lower and also rural members of society, contained a higher percentage of native vocabulary and served as basis for the modern Turkish language.[4]

Language reform and modern Turkish

After the foundation of the modern state of Turkey and the script reform, the Turkish Language Association (TDK) was established in 1932 under the patronage of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, with the aim of conducting research on Turkish. One of the tasks of the newly established association was to initiate a language reform to replace loanwords of Arabic and Persian origin with Turkish equivalents.[5] By banning the usage of imported words in the press, the association succeeded in removing several hundred foreign words from the language. While most of the words introduced to the language by the TDK were newly derived from Turkic roots, it also opted for reviving Old Turkish words which had not been used for centuries.[6]

Owing to this sudden change in the language, older and younger people in Turkey started to differ in their vocabularies. While the generations born before the 1940s tend to use the older terms of Arabic or Persian origin, the younger generations favor new expressions. It is considered particularly ironic that Atatürk himself, in his lengthy speech to the new Parliament in 1927, used a style of Ottoman which sounded so alien to later listeners that it had to be "translated" three times into modern Turkish: first in 1963, again in 1986, and most recently in 1995.[7]

The past few decades have seen the continuing work of the TDK to coin new Turkish words to express new concepts and technologies as they enter the language, mostly from English. Many of these new words, particularly information technology terms, have received widespread acceptance. However, the TDK is occasionally criticized for coining words which sound contrived and artificial. Some earlier changes—such as __ to replace __, "political party"—also failed to meet with popular approval (__ has been replaced by the French loanword __). Some words restored from Old Turkic have taken on specialized meanings; for example __ (originally meaning "book") is now used to mean "script" in computer science.[8]

Some examples of modern Turkish words and the old loanwords are:

  Ottoman Turkish   Modern Turkish   English translation   Comments
  ----------------- ---------------- --------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  __                __               triangle              Compound of the noun __ the suffix __
  __                __               aeroplane             Derived from the verb __ ("to fly"). The word was first proposed to mean "airport".
  __                __               ratio                 The old word is still used in the language today together with the new one. The modern word is from the Old Turkic verb __ (to cut).
  __                __               north                 Derived from the Old Turkic noun __ ("cold and dark place", "shadow"). The word is restored from Middle Turkic usage.[9]
  __                __               October               The noun __ means "the action of planting", referring to the planting of cereal seeds in autumn, which is widespread in Turkey


Geographic distribution

Turkish is natively spoken by the Turkish people in Turkey and by the Turkish diaspora in some 30 other countries. Turkish language is mutually intelligible with Azerbaijani and other Turkic languages. In particular, Turkish-speaking minorities exist in countries that formerly (in whole or part) belonged to the Ottoman Empire, such as Iraq, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece (primarily in Western Thrace), the Republic of North Macedonia, Romania, and Serbia. More than two million Turkish speakers live in Germany; and there are significant Turkish-speaking communities in the United States, France, The Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.[10] Due to the cultural assimilation of Turkish immigrants in host countries, not all ethnic Turkish immigrants speak the language with native fluency.[11]

In 2005, 93% of the population of Turkey were native speakers of Turkish,[12] about 67 million at the time, with Kurdish languages making up most of the remainder.[13]

Official status

, Kosovo. Official languages are: Albanian (top), Serbian (middle) and Turkish (bottom).]] Turkish is the official language of Turkey and is one of the official languages of Cyprus. Turkish has official status in 38 municipalities in Kosovo, including Mamusha, and two in the Republic of North Macedonia.[14]

In Turkey, the regulatory body for Turkish is the Turkish Language Association (_Türk Dil Kurumu_ or TDK), which was founded in 1932 under the name _Türk Dili Tetkik Cemiyeti_ ("Society for Research on the Turkish Language"). The Turkish Language Association was influenced by the ideology of linguistic purism: indeed one of its primary tasks was the replacement of loanwords and foreign grammatical constructions with equivalents of Turkish origin.[15] These changes, together with the adoption of the new Turkish alphabet in 1928, shaped the modern Turkish language spoken today. TDK became an independent body in 1951, with the lifting of the requirement that it should be presided over by the Minister of Education. This status continued until August 1983, when it was again made into a governmental body in the constitution of 1982, following the military coup d'état of 1980.[16]

Dialects

across Southeast Europe and the Middle East.]] Modern standard Turkish is based on the dialect of Istanbul.[17] This "Istanbul Turkish" (_İstanbul Türkçesi_) constitutes the model of written and spoken Turkish, as recommended by Ziya Gökalp, Ömer Seyfettin and others.[18]

Dialectal variation persists, in spite of the levelling influence of the standard used in mass media and the Turkish education system since the 1930s.[19] Academically, researchers from Turkey often refer to Turkish dialects as _ağız_ or _şive_, leading to an ambiguity with the linguistic concept of accent, which is also covered with these words. Projects investigating Turkish dialects are being carried out by several universities, as well as a dedicated work group of the Turkish Language Association. Work is currently in progress for the compilation and publication of their research as a comprehensive dialect atlas of the Turkish language.[20][21]

_Rumelice_ is spoken by immigrants from Rumelia, and includes the distinct dialects of Ludogorie, Dinler, and Adakale, which are influenced by the theoretized Balkan sprachbund. _Kıbrıs Türkçesi_ is the name for Cypriot Turkish and is spoken by the Turkish Cypriots. _Edirne_ is the dialect of Edirne. _Ege_ is spoken in the Aegean region, with its usage extending to Antalya. The nomadic Yörüks of the Mediterranean Region of Turkey also have their own dialect of Turkish.[22] This group is not to be confused with the Yuruk nomads of Macedonia, Greece, and European Turkey who speak Balkan Gagauz Turkish.

_Güneydoğu_ is spoken in the southeast, to the east of Mersin. _Doğu_, a dialect in the Eastern Anatolia Region, has a dialect continuum. The Meskhetian Turks who live in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia as well as in several Central Asian countries, also speak an Eastern Anatolian dialect of Turkish, originating in the areas of Kars, Ardahan, and Artvin and sharing similarities with Azerbaijani, the language of Azerbaijan.[23]

The Central Anatolia Region speaks _Orta Anadolu_. _Karadeniz_, spoken in the Eastern Black Sea Region and represented primarily by the Trabzon dialect, exhibits substratum influence from Greek in phonology and syntax;[24] it is also known as _Laz dialect_ (not to be confused with the Laz language). _Kastamonu_ is spoken in Kastamonu and its surrounding areas. Karamanli Turkish is spoken in Greece, where it is called . It is the literary standard for the Karamanlides.[25]

: CONSONANT PHONEMES OF STANDARD TURKISH

At least one source claims Turkish consonants are larengially specified three-way fortis-lenis (aspirated/neutral/voiced) like Armenian.[26]

The phoneme that is usually referred to as _yumuşak g_ ("soft g"), written in Turkish orthography, represents a vowel sequence or a rather weak bilabial approximant between rounded vowels, a weak palatal approximant between unrounded front vowels, and a vowel sequence elsewhere. It never occurs at the beginning of a word or a syllable, but always follows a vowel. When word-final or preceding another consonant, it lengthens the preceding vowel.[27]

In native Turkic words, the sounds , , and are in complementary distribution with , , and ; the former set occurs adjacent to front vowels and the latter adjacent to back vowels. The distribution of these phonemes is often unpredictable, however, in foreign borrowings and proper nouns. In such words, , , and often occur with back vowels:[28] some examples are given below.

Consonant devoicing

Turkish orthography reflects final-obstruent devoicing, a form of consonant mutation whereby a voiced obstruent, such as , is devoiced to at the end of a word or before a consonant, but retains its voicing before a vowel. In loan words, the voiced equivalent of _/k/_ is _/g/_; in native words, it is _/ğ/_.[29][30]

+------------+----------+------------+-----------------+---------------+--------------+

: Obstruent devoicing in nouns

This is analogous to languages such as German and Russian, but in the case of Turkish, the spelling is usually made to match the sound. However, in a few cases, such as _ad_ 'name' (dative _ada_), the underlying form is retained in the spelling (cf. _at_ 'horse', dative _ata_). Other exceptions are _od_ 'fire' vs. _ot_ 'herb', _sac_ 'sheet metal', _saç_ 'hair'. Most loanwords, such as _kitap_ above, are spelled as pronounced, but a few such as _hac_ 'hajj', _şad_ 'happy', and _yad_ 'strange(r)' also show their underlying forms.

Native nouns of two or more syllables that end in _/k/_ in dictionary form are nearly all _//ğ//_ in underlying form. However, most verbs and monosyllabic nouns are underlyingly _//k//_.[31]

Vowels

The vowels of the Turkish language are, in their alphabetical order, , , , , , , , .[32] The Turkish vowel system can be considered as being three-dimensional, where vowels are characterised by how and where they are articulated focusing on three key features: front and back, rounded and unrounded and vowel height.[33] Vowels are classified [±back], [±round] and [±high].[34]

The only diphthongs in the language are found in loanwords and may be categorised as falling diphthongs usually analyzed as a sequence of /j/ and a vowel.[35]

Vowel harmony

 in Istanbul. (Photo taken during the 28th Istanbul Marathon in 2006)]]

Turkish is an agglutinative language where a series of suffixes are added to the stem word; vowel harmony is a phonological process which ensures a smooth flow, requiring the least amount of oral movement as possible. Vowel harmony can be viewed as a process of assimilation, whereby following vowels take on the characteristics of the preceding vowel.[36] It may be useful to think of Turkish vowels as two symmetrical sets: the a-undotted (a, ı, o, u) which are all back vowels, articulated at the back of the mouth; and the e-dotted (e, i, ö, ü) vowels which are articulated at the front of the mouth. The place and manner of articulation of the vowels will determine which pattern of vowel harmony a word will adopt. The pattern of vowels is shown in the table above.[37]

Grammatical affixes have "a chameleon-like quality",[38] and obey one of the following patterns of vowel harmony:

-   TWOFOLD (_-E/-A_):[39] the locative case suffix, for example, is _-de_ after front vowels and _-da_ after back vowels. The notation _-de_² is a convenient shorthand for this pattern.
-   FOURFOLD (_-I/-I/-Ü/-U_): the genitive case suffix, for example, is _-in_ or _-ın_ after unrounded vowels (front or back respectively); and _-ün_ or _-un_ after the corresponding rounded vowels. In this case, the shorthand notation _-in_⁴ is used.

Practically, the twofold pattern (also referred to as the e-type vowel harmony) means that in the environment where the vowel in the word stem is formed in the front of the mouth, the suffix will take the e-form, while if it is formed in the back it will take the a-form. The fourfold pattern (also called the i-type) accounts for rounding as well as for front/back.[40] The following examples, based on the copula _-dir_⁴ ("[it] is"), illustrate the principles of i-type vowel harmony in practice: _Türkiye'DIR_ ("it is Turkey"),[41] _kapıDIR_ ("it is the door"), but _günDÜR_ ("it is the day"), _paltoDUR_ ("it is the coat").[42]

There are several exceptions to the vowel harmony rules, which can be categorised as follows:

1.  A few native root words such as anne (mother), elma (apple) and kardeş (brother). In these cases the suffixes harmonise with the final vowel.
2.  Compounds such as the bu-gün (today) and baş-kent (capital). In these cases vowels are not required to harmonise between the constituent words.
3.  Loanwords often don't harmonise, however, in some cases the suffixes will harmonise with the front vowel even in words that may not have a front vowel in the final syllable. Usually this occurs when the words end in a palatal [l], for example _halsiz_ < _hal_ + _-siz_ "listless", _meçhuldür_ < _meçhul_ + _-dir_ "it is unknown". However, affixes borrowed from foreign languages do not harmonise, such as -izm (ateizm "atheism"), -en (derived from French -ment as in taxmen "completely), anti- (antidemokratik "antidemocratic").
4.  A few native suffixes are also invariable (or at least partially so) such as the second vowel in the bound auxiliary -abil, or in the marker -ken as well as in the imperfect suffix -yor. There are also a few derivational suffixes that do not harmonise such as -gen in uçgen (triangle) or altigen (hexagon). [43]

Some rural dialects lack some or all of these exceptions mentioned above.

The road sign in the photograph above illustrates several of these features:

-   a native compound which does not obey vowel harmony: _Orta+köy_ ("middle village"—a place name)
-   a loanword also violating vowel harmony: _viyadük_ (< French _viaduc_ "viaduct")
-   the possessive suffix'' -i''⁴ harmonizing with the final vowel (and softening the _k_ by consonant alternation): _viyadüğü_

The rules of vowel harmony may vary by regional dialect. The dialect of Turkish spoken in the Trabzon region of northeastern Turkey follows the reduced vowel harmony of Old Anatolian Turkish, with the additional complication of two missing vowels (ü and ı), thus there is no palatal harmony. It's likely that _elün_ meant "your hand" in Old Anatolian. While the 2nd person singular possessive would vary between back and front vowel, -ün or -un, as in _elün_ for "your hand" and _kitabun_ for "your book", the lack of ü vowel in the Trabzon dialect means -un would be used in both of these cases — _elun_ and _kitabun_.[44]


Word-accent

Word-accent is usually on the last syllable in most words.[45] There are however, several exceptions. Exceptions include certain loanwords, particularly from Italian and Greek, as well as interjections, certain question words, adverbs (although not adjectives functioning as adverbs), and many proper names. Loanwords are usually accented on the penultimate syllable ( _lokanta_ "restaurant" or _iskele_ "quay"). Proper names are usually accented on the penultimate syllable as in _İstanbul_, but sometimes on the antepenultimate, if the word ends in a cretic rhythm (– u x), as in _Ankara_. (See Turkish phonology#Place names.)

In addition, there are certain suffixes such as _-le_ "with" and the verbal negative particle _-me-/-ma-_, which place an accent on the syllable which precedes them, e.g. _kitáp-la_ "with the book", _dé-me-mek_ "not to say".[46]

In some circumstances (for example, in the second half of compound words or when verbs are preceded by an indefinite object) the accent on a word is suppressed and cannot be heard.


Syntax

Sentence groups

Turkish has two groups of sentences: verbal and nominal sentences. In the case of a verbal sentence, the predicate is a finite verb, while the predicate in nominal sentence will have either no overt verb or a verb in the form of the copula _ol_ or _y_ (variants of "be"). Examples of both are given below:[47]

  Sentence type       Turkish   English
  ------------------- --------- ------------------------------------------
                      Subject   Predicate
  Verbal              Necla     okula gitti
  Nominal (no verb)   Necla     oğretmen
  (copula)            Necla     ev-de-Y-miş (hyphens delineate suffixes)

Negation

The two groups of sentences have different ways of forming negation. A nominal sentence can be negated with the addition of the word _değil_. For example, the sentence above would become _Necla oğretmen değil_ ('Necla is not a teacher'). However, the verbal sentence requires the addition of a negative suffix _-me_ to the verb (the suffix comes after the stem but before the tense): _Necla okula gitmedi_ ('Necla did not go to school').[48]

Yes/no questions

In the case of a verbal sentence, an interrogative clitic _mi_ is added after the verb and stands alone, for example _Necla okula gitti mi?_ ('Did Necla go to school?'). In the case of a nominal sentence, then _mi_ comes after the predicate but before the personal ending, so for example _Necla, siz oğretmen misiniz_? ('Necla, are you [formal, plural] a teacher?').[49]

Word order

Word order in simple Turkish sentences is generally subject–object–verb, as in Korean and Latin, but unlike English, for verbal sentences and subject-predicate for nominal sentences. However, as Turkish possesses a case-marking system, and most grammatical relations are shown using morphological markers, often the SOV structure has diminished relevance and may vary. The SOV structure may thus be considered a "pragmatic word order" of language, one that does not rely on word order for grammatical purposes.[50]

Immediately preverbal

Consider the following simple sentence which demonstrates that the focus in Turkish is on the element that immediately precedes the verb:[51]

  Word order                                                            Focus
  ------------ ------------- ----------------------------- ------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------
  SOV          Ahmet Ahmet   yumurta-yı egg (accusative)   yedi ate     unmarked: Ahmet ate the egg
  SVO          Ahmet         yedi                          yumurta-yı   the focus is on the subject: Ahmet (it was Ahmet who ate the egg)
  OVS          Yumurta-yı    yedi                          Ahmet        the focus is on the object: egg (it was an egg that Ahmet ate)

Postpredicate

The postpredicate position signifies what is referred to as background information in Turkish- information that is assumed to be known to both the speaker and the listener, or information that is included in the context. Consider the following examples:[52]

  Sentence type   Word order
  --------------- ------------- --------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------
  Nominal         S-predicate   Bu ev güzelmiş (apparently this house is beautiful)       unmarked
                  Predicate-s   Güzelmiş bu ev (it is apparently beautiful, this house)   it is understood that the sentence is about this house
  Verbal          SOV           Bana da bir kahve getir (get me a coffee too)             unmarked
                                Bana da getir bir kahve (get me one too, a coffee)        it is understood that it is a coffee that the speaker wants

Topic

There has been some debate among linguists whether Turkish is a subject-prominent (like English) or topic-prominent (like Japanese and Korean) language, with recent scholarship implying that it is indeed both subject and topic-prominent.[53] This has direct implications for word order as it is possible for the subject to be included in the verb-phrase in Turkish. There can be S/O inversion in sentences where the topic is of greater importance than the subject.


Grammar

Turkish is an agglutinative language and frequently uses affixes, and specifically suffixes, or endings.[54] One word can have many affixes and these can also be used to create new words, such as creating a verb from a noun, or a noun from a verbal root (see the section on Word formation). Most affixes indicate the grammatical function of the word.[55] The only native prefixes are alliterative intensifying syllables used with adjectives or adverbs: for example _SIMsıcak_ ("boiling hot" < _sıcak_) and _MASmavi_ ("bright blue" < _mavi_).[56]

The extensive use of affixes can give rise to long words, e.g. _Çekoslovakyalılaştıramadıklarımızdanmışsınızcasına_, meaning "In the manner of you being one of those that we apparently couldn't manage to convert to Czechoslovakian". While this case is contrived, long words frequently occur in normal Turkish, as in this heading of a newspaper obituary column: _Bayramlaşamadıklarımız_ (Bayram [festival]-Recipr-Impot-Partic-Plur-PossPl1; "Those of our number with whom we cannot exchange the season's greetings").[57] Another example can be seen in the final word of this heading of the online Turkish Spelling Guide (_İmlâ Kılavuzu_): _Dilde birlik, ulusal birliğin vazgeçilemezlerindendir_ ("Unity in language is among the indispensables [dispense-Pass-Impot-Plur-PossS3-Abl-Copula] of national unity ~ Linguistic unity is a _sine qua non_ of national unity").[58]

Nouns

There is no definite article in Turkish, but definiteness of the object is implied when the accusative ending is used (see below). Turkish nouns decline by taking case endings. There are six noun cases in Turkish, with all the endings following vowel harmony (shown in the table using the shorthand superscript notation. The plural marker _-ler_ ² immediately follows the noun before any case or other affixes (e.g. _köylerin_ "of the villages").

The accusative case marker is used only for definite objects; compare _(bir) ağaç gördük_ "we saw A tree" with _ağacı gördük_ "we saw THE tree".[59] The plural marker _-ler_ ² is generally not used when a class or category is meant: _ağaç gördük_ can equally well mean "we saw trees [as we walked through the forest]"—as opposed to _ağaçları gördük_ "we saw the trees [in question]".

The declension of _ağaç_ illustrates two important features of Turkish phonology: consonant assimilation in suffixes (_ağaçTan, ağaçTa_) and voicing of final consonants before vowels (_ağaCın, ağaCa, ağaCı_).

Additionally, nouns can take suffixes that assign person: for example _-imiz_ ⁴, "our". With the addition of the copula (for example _-im_ ⁴, "I am") complete sentences can be formed. The interrogative particle _mi_ ⁴ immediately follows the word being questioned: _köye mi?_ "[going] to the village?", _ağaç mı?_ "[is it a] tree?".

Personal pronouns

The Turkish personal pronouns in the nominative case are _ben_ (1s), _sen_ (2s), _o_ (3s), _biz_ (1pl), _siz_ (2pl, or 2h), and _onlar_ (3pl). They are declined regularly with some exceptions: _benim_ (1s gen.); _bizim_ (1pl gen.); _bana_ (1s dat.); _sana_ (2s dat.); and the oblique forms of _o_ use the root _on_. All other pronouns (reflexive _kendi_ and so on) are declined regularly.

Noun phrases (_tamlama_)

Two nouns, or groups of nouns, may be joined in either of two ways:

-   definite (possessive) compound (_belirtili tamlama_). E.g. _Türkiye'nin sesi_ "the voice of Turkey (radio station)": the voice belonging to Turkey. Here the relationship is shown by the genitive ending _-in_⁴ added to the first noun; the second noun has the third-person suffix of possession _-(s)i_⁴.
-   indefinite (qualifying) compound (_belirtisiz tamlama_). E.g. _Türkiye Cumhuriyeti_ "Turkey-Republic[60] = the Republic of Turkey": not the republic belonging to Turkey, but the Republic that is Turkey. Here the first noun has no ending; but the second noun has the ending _-(s)i_⁴—the same as in definite compounds.

The following table illustrates these principles.[61] In some cases the constituents of the compounds are themselves compounds; for clarity these subsidiary compounds are marked with [square brackets]. The suffixes involved in the linking are underlined. Note that if the second noun group already had a possessive suffix (because it is a compound by itself), no further suffix is added.

  : Linked nouns and noun groups

As the last example shows, the qualifying expression may be a substantival sentence rather than a noun or noun group.[65]

There is a third way of linking the nouns where both nouns take no suffixes (_takısız tamlama_). However, in this case the first noun acts as an adjective,[66] e.g. _Demir kapı_ (iron gate), _elma yanak_ ("apple cheek", i.e. red cheek), _kömür göz_ ("coal eye", i.e. black eye) :

Adjectives

Turkish adjectives are not declined. However most adjectives can also be used as nouns, in which case they are declined: e.g. _güzel_ ("beautiful") → _güzeller_ ("(the) beautiful ones / people"). Used attributively, adjectives precede the nouns they modify. The adjectives _var_ ("existent") and _yok_ ("non-existent") are used in many cases where English would use "there is" or "have", _e.g._ _süt yok_ ("there is no milk", _lit._ "(the) milk (is) non-existent"); the construction "_noun 1_-GEN _noun 2_-POSS var/yok" can be translated "_noun 1_ has/doesn't have _noun 2_"; _imparatorun elbisesi yok_ "the emperor has no clothes" ("(the) emperor-_of_ clothes-_his_ non-existent"); _kedimin ayakkabıları yoktu_ ("my cat had no shoes", _lit._ "cat-_my_-_of_ shoe-_plur._-_its_ non-existent-_past tense_").

Verbs

Turkish verbs indicate person. They can be made negative, potential ("can"), or impotential ("cannot"). Furthermore, Turkish verbs show tense (present, past, future, and aorist), mood (conditional, imperative, inferential, necessitative, and optative), and aspect. Negation is expressed by the infix _-me²-_ immediately following the stem.

  _gelebil-_          (to) be able to come
  _gelme-_            not (to) come
  _geleme-_           (to) be unable to come
  _gelememiş_         Apparently (s)he couldn't come
  _gelebilecek_       (s)he'll be able to come
  _gelmeyebilir_      (s)he may (possibly) not come
  _gelebilirsen_      if thou can come
  _gelinir_           (_passive_) one comes, people come
  _gelebilmeliydin_   thou shouldst have been able to come
  _gelebilseydin_     if thou could have come
  _gelmeliydin_       thou shouldst have come

Verb tenses

(_Note_. For the sake of simplicity the term "tense" is used here throughout, although for some forms "aspect" or "mood" might be more appropriate.) There are 9 simple and 20 compound tenses in Turkish. 9 simple tenses are simple past (_di'li geçmiş_), inferential past (_miş'li geçmiş_), present continuous, simple present (aorist), future, optative, subjunctive, necessitative ("must") and imperative.[67] There are three groups of compound forms. Story (_hikaye_) is the witnessed past of the above forms (except command), rumor (_rivayet_) is the unwitnessed past of the above forms (except simple past and command), conditional (_koşul_) is the conditional form of the first five basic tenses.[68] In the example below the second person singular of the verb _gitmek_ ("go"), stem _gid-/git-_, is shown.

  you have gone               _gitmişsin_    _gitmiştin_        _gitmişmişsin_      _gitmişsen_
  you are going               _gidiyorsun_   _gidiyordun_       _gidiyormuşsun_     _gidiyorsan_
  you (are wont to) go        _gidersin_     _giderdin_         _gidermişsin_       _gidersen_
  you will go                 _gideceksin_   _gidecektin_       _gidecekmişsin_     _gideceksen_
  if only you go              _gitsen_       _gitseydin_        _gitseymişsin_      –
  may you go                  _gidesin_      _gideydin_         _gideymişsin_       –
  you must go                 _gitmelisin_   _gitmeliydin_      _gitmeliymişin_     –
  go! (imperative)            _git_          –                  –                   –

There are also so-called combined verbs, which are created by suffixing certain verb stems (like _bil_ or _ver_) to the original stem of a verb. _Bil_ is the suffix for the sufficiency mood. It is the equivalent of the English auxiliary verbs "able to", "can" or "may". _Ver_ is the suffix for the swiftness mood, _kal_ for the perpetuity mood and _yaz_ for the approach ("almost") mood.[69] Thus, while _gittin_ means "you went", _gidebildin_ means "you could go" and _gidiverdin_ means "you went swiftly". The tenses of the combined verbs are formed the same way as for simple verbs.

Attributive verbs (participles)

Turkish verbs have attributive forms, including present,[70] similar to the English present participle (with the ending ²); future (²); indirect/inferential past (⁴); and aorist (² or ⁴).

The most important function of some of these attributive verbs is to form modifying phrases equivalent to the relative clauses found in most European languages. The subject of the verb in an ² form is (possibly implicitly) in the third person (he/she/it/they); this form, when used in a modifying phrase, does not change according to number. The other attributive forms used in these constructions are the future (²) and an older form (⁴), which covers both present and past meanings.[71] These two forms take "personal endings", which have the same form as the possessive suffixes but indicate the person and possibly number of the subject of the attributive verb; for example, _yediğIM_ means "what I eat", _yediğIN_ means "what YOU eat", and so on. The use of these "personal or relative participles" is illustrated in the following table, in which the examples are presented according to the grammatical case which would be seen in the equivalent English relative clause.[72]

Vocabulary

Latest 2010 edition of _Büyük Türkçe Sözlük_ (_Great Turkish Dictionary_), the official dictionary of the Turkish language published by Turkish Language Association, contains 616,767 words, expressions, terms and nouns.[73]

The 2005 edition of _Güncel Türkçe Sözlük_, the official dictionary of the Turkish language published by Turkish Language Association, contains 104,481 words, of which about 86% are Turkish and 14% are of foreign origin.[74] Among the most significant foreign contributors to Turkish vocabulary are Arabic, French, Persian, Italian, English, and Greek.[75]

Word formation

Turkish extensively uses agglutination to form new words from nouns and verbal stems. The majority of Turkish words originate from the application of derivative suffixes to a relatively small set of core vocabulary.[76]

Turkish obeys certain principles when it comes to suffixation. Most suffixes in Turkish will have more than one form, depending on the vowels and consonants in the root- vowel harmony rules will apply; consonant-initial suffixes will follow the voiced/ voiceless character of the consonant in the final unit of the root; and in the case of vowel-initial suffixes an additional consonant may be inserted if the root ends in a vowel, or the suffix may lose its initial vowel. There is also a prescribed order of affixation of suffixes- as a rule of thumb, derivative suffixes precede inflectional suffixes which are followed by clitics, as can be seen in the example set of words derived from a substantive root below:

  Turkish         Components                  English            Word class
  --------------- --------------------------- ------------------ -------------------

  _gözlükçülük_   _göz + -lük + -çü + -lük_   optician's trade   Noun
  _gözlem_        _göz + -lem_                observation        Noun
  _gözlemci_      _göz + -lem + -ci_          observer           Noun

  _yatırımcı_   _yat- + -(ı)r- + -(ı)m + -cı_   depositor, investor                        Noun

New words are also frequently formed by compounding two existing words into a new one, as in German. Compounds can be of two types- bare and (s)I. The bare compounds, both nouns and adjectives are effectively two words juxtaposed without the addition of suffixes for example the word for girlfriend _kizarkadaş_ (_kiz+arkadaş_) or black pepper _karabiber_ (_kara+biber_). A few examples of compound words are given below:

  Turkish        English      Constituent words                                      Literal meaning
  -------------- ------------ ------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------
  _pazartesi_    Monday       _pazar_ ("Sunday") and _ertesi_ ("after")              after Sunday
  _bilgisayar_   computer     _bilgi_ ("information") and _say-_ ("to count")        information counter
  _gökdelen_     skyscraper   _gök_ ("sky") and _del-_ ("to pierce")                 sky piercer
  _başparmak_    thumb        _baş_ ("prime") and _parmak_ ("finger")                primary finger

However, the majority of compound words in Turkish are (s)I compounds, which means that the second word will be marked by the 3rd person possessive suffix. A few such examples are given in the table below (note vowel harmony):

  Turkish         English      Constituent words                   Possessive Suffix

  _el çantası_    handbag      _el_ (hand) and _çanta_ (bag)       _+SI_
  _masa örtüsü_   tablecloth   _masa_ (table) and _örtü_ (cover)   _+SÜ_
  _çay bardağı_   tea glass    _çay_ (tea) and _bardak_ (glass)    _+I_ (the k changes to ğ)


Writing system

introducing the new Turkish alphabet to the people of Kayseri. September 20, 1928. (Cover of the French _L'Illustration_ magazine)]]

Turkish is written using a Latin alphabet introduced in 1928 by Atatürk to replace the Ottoman Turkish alphabet, a version of Perso-Arabic alphabet. The Ottoman alphabet marked only three different vowels—long _ā, ū_ and _ī_—and included several redundant consonants, such as variants of _z_ (which were distinguished in Arabic but not in Turkish). The omission of short vowels in the Arabic script was claimed to make it particularly unsuitable for Turkish, which has eight vowels.[77]

The reform of the script was an important step in the cultural reforms of the period. The task of preparing the new alphabet and selecting the necessary modifications for sounds specific to Turkish was entrusted to a Language Commission composed of prominent linguists, academics, and writers. The introduction of the new Turkish alphabet was supported by public education centers opened throughout the country, cooperation with publishing companies, and encouragement by Atatürk himself, who toured the country teaching the new letters to the public.[78] As a result, there was a dramatic increase in literacy from its original Third World levels.[79]

The Latin alphabet was applied to the Turkish language for educational purposes even before the 20th-century reform. Instances include a 1635 Latin-Albanian dictionary by Frang Bardhi, who also incorporated several sayings in the Turkish language, as an appendix to his work (e.g. _alma agatsdan irak duschamas_[80]—"An apple does not fall far from its tree").

Turkish now has an alphabet suited to the sounds of the language: the spelling is largely phonemic, with one letter corresponding to each phoneme.[81] Most of the letters are used approximately as in English, the main exceptions being , which denotes ( being used for the found in Persian and European loans); and the undotted , representing . As in German, and represent and . The letter , in principle, denotes but has the property of lengthening the preceding vowel and assimilating any subsequent vowel. The letters and represent and , respectively. A circumflex is written over back vowels following , , or when these consonants represent , , and —almost exclusively in Arabic and Persian loans.[82]

The Turkish alphabet consists of 29 letters (q, x, w omitted and ç, ş, ğ, ı, ö, ü added); the complete list is:

    _a, b, c, ç, d, e, f, g, ğ, h, ı, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, ö, p, r, s, ş, t, u, ü, v, y_, and _z_ (Note that capital of _i_ is _İ_ and lowercase _I_ is _ı_.)

The specifically Turkish letters and spellings described above are illustrated in this table:

Whistled language

In the Turkish province of Giresun, the locals in the village of Kuşköy have communicated using a whistled version of Turkish for over 400 years. The region consists of a series of deep valleys and the unusual mode of communication allows for conversation over distances of up to 5 kilometres. Turkish authorities estimate that there are still around 10,000 people using the whistled language. However, in 2011 UNESCO found whistling Turkish to be a dying language and included it in its intangible cultural heritage list. Since then the local education directorate has introduced it as a course in schools in the region, hoping to revive its use.

A study was conducted by a German scientist of Turkish origin Onur Güntürkün at Ruhr University, observing 31 "speakers" of __ ("bird's tongue") from Kuşköy, and he found that the whistled language mirrored the lexical and syntactical structure of Turkish language.[83]

[56] "The prefix, which is accented, is modelled on the first syllable of the simple adjective or adverb but with the substitution of M, P, R, or S for the last consonant of that syllable." Lewis (2001):55. The prefix retains the first vowel of the base form and thus exhibits a form of reverse vowel harmony.

[57] This "splendid word" appeared at the time of _Bayram_, the festival marking the end of the month of fasting. Lewis (2001):287.

[58]

[59] Because it is also used for the indefinite accusative, Lewis uses the term "absolute case" in preference to "nominative". Lewis (2001):28.

[60] Lewis points out that "an indefinite izafet group can be turned into intelligible (though not necessarily normal) English by the use of a hyphen". Lewis (2001): 42.

[61] The examples are taken from Lewis (2001): 41–47.

[62] For other possible permutations of this vehicle, see Lewis (2001):46.

[63] "It is most important to note that the third-person suffix is not repeated though theoretically one might have expected _Ankara [Kız Lisesi]si_." Lewis (2001): 45 footnote.

[64] Note the similarity with the French phrase _un m'as-tu-vu_ "a have-you-seen-me?", i.e., a vain and pretentious person.

[65] The term _substantival sentence_ is Lewis's. Lewis(2001:257).
