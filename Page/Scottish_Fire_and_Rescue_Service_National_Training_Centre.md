Construction of the facility took 77 weeks and cost Â£43million.[2] The buildings were completed in April 2012.[3] The official opening was in January 2013,[4] shortly before all eight of Scotland's fire services merged in April 2013. With the centre up and running, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service College Gullane closed in March 2015.[5]
