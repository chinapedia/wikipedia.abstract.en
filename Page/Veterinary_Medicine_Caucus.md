Information and Purpose

According to the Caucus's Official Website and Co-Chair Kurt Schrader, the purpose of the Caucus is to:[1]

_"...keep members informed about the opportunities and challenges facing veterinary medicine and help us to increase awareness of the importance of veterinary medicine on research, public health, animal health and welfare, food safety, and our overall economy."_

-   The Caucus is co-chaired by Rep. Kurt Schrader, DVM (OR-5) and Rep. Ted Yoho, DVM (FL-03).
