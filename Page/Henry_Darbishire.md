HENRY ASTLEY DARBISHIRE (15 May 1825 – 1899) was a British architect, best known for working on philanthropic schemes – including those of Angela Burdett-Coutts – and was the architect for the Peabody Trust from 1863 until 1885,[1] when he was succeeded by Victor Wilkins.[2]

He was of Mancunian origin,[3] the son of James Darbishire and his wife Mary Roberts.[4] He qualified as a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1856, and finally retired from practice in 1894.[5]

Darbishire married Eliza Paget in 1858, and they had three children.[6]
