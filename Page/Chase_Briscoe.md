Racing career

Briscoe started racing in 2001 when he competed in quarter midgets, winning his heat race and feature. Five years later, he returned to racing, driving 410 sprint cars at the age of 13. That year, he recorded 17 top-ten finishes and a win at the final race of the season; he became the youngest driver to win a 410 sprint car race, beating NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon's record by one year despite racing with an engine from 1993.[1]

In 2013,[2] Briscoe applied for the Peak Stock Car Dream Challenge, a contest rewarding the winner with a ride at Michael Waltrip Racing.[3] He finished second behind Patrick Staropoli in the challenge.[4] 2017_No._29_Cooper_Standard_Ford_F-150.jpg shop.]] Later that year, Briscoe joined Bill McAnally Racing to compete in the K&N Pro Series West, making his debut at NAPA Speedway and finishing eighth.[5] He ran two more races in the series that year, finishing 13th and 27th at Kern County Raceway Park and Phoenix International Raceway, respectively.[6]

In 2015, Briscoe was contacted by friend and driver Christopher Bell regarding a contract with Roush Fenway Racing, which resulted in a test session with ARCA Racing Series team Cunningham Motorsports. After two tests at Mobile International Speedway and Fairgrounds Speedway,[7] he made his ARCA debut at Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis,[8] finishing tenth.[9] He later ran at Salem Speedway, where he finished fifth.[10] A year later, he began competing full-time in the series.[11] That season, Briscoe recorded six wins, including four consecutive,[12] as he won the 2016 championship by 535 points over runner-up Tom Hessert.[13]

In 2017, Briscoe joined the newly formed Ford Performance NASCAR Driver Development Program and the Camping World Truck Series team Brad Keselowski Racing, driving the No. 29 Cooper Standard Ford F-150 full time.[14] Briscoe finished third at Daytona in his Truck Series debut by avoiding a tremendous wreck on the final lap after running top ten almost all day. Briscoe earned his first-career Truck Series pole award at Dover International Speedway. Later in the season, Briscoe earned his first career win at Homestead-Miami Speedway. He was named the Truck Series' Most Popular Driver for 2017.[15]

For 2018, Briscoe ran a part-time schedule in the NASCAR Xfinity Series. Briscoe ran races in both the No. 60 Ford of Roush Fenway Racing[16] and the No. 98 Ford of Stewart Haas Racing.[17] In the summer, returned to the Truck Series, driving the No. 27 truck for ThorSport Racing at Eldora and won in a photo finish over teammate Grant Enfinger. Later that year, Briscoe would go on to win the inaugural Charlotte Roval Race in the Xfinity Series after holding off Justin Marks and Austin Cindric.

Briscoe committed to a full-time Xfinity schedule in SHR's No. 98 in 2019.[18] In July, he rejoined ThorSport's No. 27 for Eldora.[19]

Briscoe's father Kevin and grandfather Richard are both involved in sprint car racing, Kevin being a former Truck Series driver and a five-time track champion at Tri-State Speedway and Bloomington Speedway, while Richard has worked as a car owner for drivers like Rich Vogler and Dave Blaney.[20] He met and became friends with fellow driver Christopher Bell on _iracing_.[21]
