In October 2012, Canadian-American couple JOSHUA BOYLE and CAITLAN COLEMAN were kidnapped in Ghazni Province of Afghanistan while on a trip through Central and South Asia. They were held by the Haqqani network until October 2017 when they were rescued by Pakistani forces in Kurram Agency, Pakistan. During their captivity, Coleman gave birth to three children.


Background

Joshua Boyle was born in Breslau, Ontario, to Linda and Patrick J. Boyle.[1] He attended Rockway Mennonite Collegiate in Kitchener, Ontario, and graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2005.[2] Following the September 11 attacks, Boyle became interested in human rights issues and the case of Omar Khadr, a Canadian held in Guantanamo Bay. Boyle believed Khadr was innocent and spent several years acting as the spokesman for the Khadr family.[3] Through his work with Khadr, Boyle met and eventually married Omar's sister Zaynab in 2009,[4] but they divorced in 2010.[5]

Caitlan Coleman was born in Stewartstown, Pennsylvania.[6]

Boyle and Coleman met online as teenagers as mutual fans of the _Star Wars_ franchise and were married in 2011.[7] After their marriage, they spent time travelling in Central America before moving to Perth-Andover, New Brunswick, where Boyle worked as a municipal clerk.[8] In July 2012, the two began travelling through Russia and Central Asia, planning on travelling through the "safe '-stans".[9] For unknown reasons, the couple crossed into Afghanistan in October;[10][11] Boyle has stated it was to help "ordinary villagers"[12], while other accounts indicate a more spontaneous decision.[13]


Kidnapping

On October 8, 2012, Boyle sent an email to his parents saying that he and Coleman were in an "unsafe" part of Afghanistan.[14] Soon after, the pair were captured by members of the Haqqani network. Coleman was pregnant at the time of their capture.[15] The first ransom video of the couple was released in early 2013. The Haqqani network demanded the release of prisoners in exchange for the release of Boyle and Coleman.[16] It was also revealed that Coleman had given birth to her child, a boy.[17]

Over the course of their five-year captivity, Coleman gave birth to a girl and a second boy, and suffered a miscarriage of a second girl. Coleman and Boyle claim that the miscarriage was intentionally caused by their captors,[18] but the Taliban claims it occurred naturally.[19] The two would regularly be separated and beaten,[20] and Coleman claims that she was raped.[21] She also charges Boyle with cruelty saying he "was just like my captors."[22] The family would regularly be transported between Afghanistan and Pakistan.[23]


Rescue

In September 2017, a CIA drone spotted what was believed to be Caitlan Coleman and her children in a militant camp in northwestern Pakistan near the Afghan border. SEAL Team Six was tasked with preparing an extraction, but concerns about the accuracy of the image and the logistics of an assault deterred the Americans from taking action.[24] The information about the family's location was passed to the Pakistani government with a request to oversee a rescue operation.

On October 11, 2017, Pakistani troops encountered the vehicle carrying the family in the Kurram Valley, Pakistan, shooting out the tires and rescuing them. The family was being held in the locked trunk. The captors managed to escape,[25] and Boyle was injured by shrapnel.[26] The family was then transported to Islamabad before travelling back to North America via the United Kingdom.[27]


Aftermath

After their rescue, the family stayed with Boyle's parents in Smiths Falls, Ontario, before moving to Ottawa. In December 2017, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with the family after Boyle requested a meeting.[28]

Criminal charges

In January 2018, Boyle was charged with numerous crimes including assault, sexual assault, assault causing bodily harm, and unlawful confinement, relating to incidents that allegedly occurred after the family was freed from captivity by Pakistani security forces and returned to Canada in October 2017. There are two alleged victims but their identities are protected by a publication ban. The charges have not been heard in court. In June 2018, Boyle was released on bail under the condition that he wear a GPS monitor and live at his parents’ house in Smith's Falls, Ontario.[29]

Coleman attributed Boyle's actions to their captivity, stating, "I can't speak about the specific charges, but I can say that ultimately it is the strain and trauma he was forced to endure for so many years and the effects that that had on his mental state that is most culpable for this."[30]

Boyle faced 19 charges, relating to two victims, being Coleman and another who was not identified; 17 of the charges relate to Coleman who agreed to lift the publication ban as to her identity as one of the victims. The charges included sexual assault, uttering a threat to cause death, assault with a weapon, unlawful confinement, and administering a noxious substance. All relate to incidents alleged to have occurred between October 14 and December 30, 2017. Boyle pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. The trial commenced on March 25, 2019, with judge alone to decide on a verdict. Boyle's lawyer told the court that Coleman's reliability and credibility would be "vigorously challenged".[31][32]

Child custody battle

Records of the Ontario Superior Court child custody case, unsealed in early September 2018, indicate that Coleman alleged that Boyle had physically and emotionally abused her during their captivity. According Coleman, Boyle had physically struck her, once breaking a cheekbone, and depicted her as "an enemy in his life," accusing her of betrayal to the guards. Boyle's own affidavit denied the allegations and accused Coleman of child neglect due to mental health issues during the captivity, requiring him to be the primary caregiver. The case is pending, and the allegations have not been heard in court.[33][34]

Since June 23, 2018, Coleman has had temporary sole custody; she relocated to Pennsylvania by mid-summer with the children. Boyle tried to prevent that move, but his request was denied by the court[35] and Justice Tracy Engelking issued a restraining order to prevent him from contacting or approaching Coleman or the children.[36]
