__NOTOC__ AMERICAN RIVER AQUATIC RESERVE is a marine protected area in the Australian state of South Australia located on the north coast of Kangaroo Island in waters of the coastal lagoon known as Pelican Lagoon.[1][2]

American River Aquatic Reserve which is also called the Pelican Lagoon Aquatic Reserve in some sources was declared on 30 November 1971 under the _Fisheries Act 1971_ and was re-proclaimed in 2007 following the enactment of the _Fisheries Management Act 2007_.[3][4] It is reported as being the oldest operating aquatic reserve created under fisheries legislation in South Australia.[5][6]

The purpose of the aquatic reserve is to ‘protect seagrass mudflats and to provide a sanctuary for juvenile and adult fish including whiting.’[7] This is achieved by the prohibition of both fishing and the collection of marine organisms within its waters. Access is permitted and activities such as birdwatching, boating, swimming and recreational diving (i.e. snorkelling and scuba diving) are also permitted. The aquatic reserve covers the full extent of the lagoon up including part of the inlet stopping at a line running from Picnic Point across to the adjoining shore just south of the American River township.[8][9][10]

Since 2012, it has been located within the boundaries of a “sanctuary zone” within the Encounter Marine Park.[11]

The aquatic reserve is classified as an IUCN Category II protected area.[12]
