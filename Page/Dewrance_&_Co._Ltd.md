DEWRANCE & CO. LTD was a manufacturer of engine and boiler accessories, such as pumps and gauges.


History

It was established in London in 1835 as a partnership by Joseph Woods, with John Dewrance. It was involved in the building of the locomotive 'Lion' in 1838 for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.[1] In 1844 after Wood's death the firm became a company specialising in manufacturing engine and boiler accessories. It produced a brass pressure gauge for Lloyd's Register of shipping to pressure-test ships' boilers before insuring them.[2] Such gauges have become collectable.[3] A pair are on display at the Internal Fire – Museum of Power.[4]

Dewrance died in 1861 and left the business to his son.[5] The firm's introduction of the groove-packed plug cock in 1875 was a major innovation because it made steam safety valves easier to operate.[6] Sir John Dewrance,[7] who was married to the granddaughter of Richard Trevithick took over the business in 1879.[8] In 1937 after Dewrance's death it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Babcock & Wilcox Ltd.[9]

In 1961 it had 2,000 employees.[10]

The firm was sold by Dresser Industries in 1998 to Tyco International. It was then operating from Skelmersdale.[11]
