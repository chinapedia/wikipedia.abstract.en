"" (I dreamed last night) is a German folk song. It is a melancholic song that tells of a disturbing dream foreshadowing death – a rosemary tree in the garden, falling leaves, and a jar broken to pieces and bleeding a red liquid. In Northern Germany, rosemary was planted in graveyards, and mourners at funerals would sometimes wear rosemary stalks.


History

It is unknown when the song was first popularized, but the melody was first written and published in 1777 by Friedrich Nicolai in _Eyn feyner kleyner Almanach_ with the text of "" (A hunter wanted to go hunting).[1] Other versions using the same melody but different lyrics included "" (The leaves fall from the trees) by Siegfried August Mahlmann in 1804/1805,[2] "" (Beautiful children love), and "" (In Koblenz on the bridge).

The best-known and most widely used lyrics to the melody were written by German preacher and collector of folk songs August Zarnack.[3][4] Zarnack's version was originally published under the title "" (The heavy dream), and appeared in Zarnack's 1820 book which was a collection of German folk songs intended for primary schools.[5][6] Zarnack's textbook sold well, and in the 1840s and onwards, "Ich hab die Nacht geträumet" was increasingly included in other music workbooks as well for schools and choirs.[7]


Lyrics

+--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  | I had a dream last night, It was such a worrisome dream, There was growing in my garden, A rosemary tree.    |
|  |                                                                                                              |
|  | A graveyard was the garden, A flowerbed the grave And from the green tree The crown and flower fell.         |
|  |                                                                                                              |
|  | The blossoms I gathered in a golden jar, It fell out of my hands, And smashed to pieces.                     |
|  |                                                                                                              |
|  | Out of it I saw pearls trickling And droplets rose-red What could the dream mean? Oh, my love, are you dead? |
