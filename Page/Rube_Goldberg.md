REUBEN GARRETT LUCIUS GOLDBERG (July 4, 1883 – December 7, 1970), known best as RUBE GOLDBERG, was an American cartoonist, sculptor, author, engineer, and inventor.

Goldberg is best known for his popular cartoons depicting complicated gadgets performing simple tasks in indirect, convoluted ways. The cartoons led to the expression "Rube Goldberg machines" to describe similar gadgets and processes. Goldberg received many honors in his lifetime, including a Pulitzer Prize for political cartooning in 1948 and the Banshees' Silver Lady Award in 1959.[1]

Goldberg was a founding member and first president of the National Cartoonists Society,[2] and the namesake of the Reuben Award, which the organization awards to its Cartoonist of the Year. He is the inspiration for international competitions, known as Rube Goldberg Machine Contests, which challenge participants to create a complicated machine to perform a simple task.


Personal life

Goldberg was born July 4, 1883, in San Francisco, California, to Jewish parents Max and Hannah (Cohen) Goldberg.[3] He was the third of seven children, three of whom died as children (older brother Garrett, younger brother Walter, and younger sister Lillian also survived).[4]

Goldberg began tracing illustrations when he was four years old, and first took professional drawing lessons when he was eleven.[5]

Goldberg married Irma Seeman on October 17, 1916.[6] They lived at 98 Central Park West in New York City and had two sons named Thomas and George.

During World War II Goldberg's sons changed their surname, at Goldberg's insistence, because of the amount of hatred towards him stemming from the political nature of his cartoons.[7] Thomas chose the surname of George, in order to honor his brother; George, wanting to keep a sense of family cohesiveness, adopted the same surname. Thomas and George's children now run a company called RGI (Rube Goldberg Incorporated) to maintain the Goldberg name. John George (Thomas's son) is assisted by his cousin Jennifer George[8][9] (George's daughter) and John's son Joshua George to keep the family name alive.[10]


Career

Goldberg's father was a San Francisco police and fire commissioner, who encouraged the young Reuben to pursue a career in engineering. Rube graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1904 with a degree in Engineering[11] and was hired by the city of San Francisco as an engineer for the Water and Sewers Department. After six months he resigned his position with the city to join the _San Francisco Chronicle_ where he became a sports cartoonist.[12] The following year, he took a job with the _San Francisco Bulletin_, where he remained until he moved to New York City in 1907, finding employment as a cartoonist with the _New York Evening Mail_.[13]

The _New York Evening Mail_ was syndicated to the first newspaper syndicate, the McClure Newspaper Syndicate, giving Goldberg's cartoons a wider distribution, and by 1915 he was earning $25,000 per year and being billed by the paper as America's most popular cartoonist.[14] Arthur Brisbane had offered Goldberg $2,600 per year in 1911 in an unsuccessful attempt to get him to move to William Randolph Hearst's newspaper chain, and in 1915 raised the offer to $50,000 per year. Rather than lose Goldberg to Hearst, the _New York Evening Mail_ matched the salary offer and formed the Evening Mail Syndicate to syndicate Goldberg's cartoons nationally.[15]

In 1916, Goldberg created a series of seven short animated films, finding humorous aspects to details of everyday life[16] in the form of an animated newsreel.[17] The seven films were released on these dates in 1916: May 8, _The Boob Weekly_; May 22, _Leap Year_; June 5, _The Fatal Pie_; Jun 19, _From Kitchen Mechanic to Movie Star_; July 3, _Nutty News_; July 17, _Home Sweet Home_; July 31, _Losing Weight_.[18]

Goldberg was syndicated by the McNaught Syndicate from 1922 until 1934.

A prolific artist, Goldberg produced several cartoon series simultaneously, including _Mike and Ike (They Look Alike)_, _Boob McNutt_, _Foolish Questions_,[19][20] _What Are You Kicking About_,[21] _Telephonies_,[22] _Lala Palooza_, _The Weekly Meeting of the Tuesday Women's Club_, and the uncharacteristically serious soap-opera strip, _Doc Wright_, which ran for 10 months beginning January 29, 1933.[23] The cartoons that brought him lasting fame involved a character named Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts. In that series, Goldberg drew labeled schematics of the comical "inventions" that would later bear his name. Professor Butts was based on a couple of college professors he studied with (and found boring) while earning his degree from the College of Mining and Engineering at the University of California from 1901-1903, Samuel B Christie and Frederick Slate.[24][25]

From 1938 to 1941, Goldberg drew two weekly strips for the Register and Tribune Syndicate: _Brad and Dad_ (1939-1941) and _Side Show_ (1938-1941).[26]


Cultural legacy

The popularity of Goldberg's cartoons was such that the term "Goldbergian" was in use in print by 1915,[27] and "Rube Goldberg" by 1928.[28] "Rube Goldberg" appeared in the _Random House Dictionary of the English Language_ in 1966 meaning "having a fantastically complicated improvised appearance", or "deviously complex and impractical."[29] The 1915 usage of "Goldbergian" was in reference to Goldberg's early comic strip _Foolish Questions_ which he drew from 1909 to 1934, while later use of the terms "Goldbergian", "Rube Goldberg" and "Rube Goldberg machine" refer to the crazy inventions for which he is now best known from his strip _The Inventions of Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts_, drawn from 1914 to 1964.[30]

The corresponding term in the UK was, and still is, "Heath Robinson", after the English illustrator with an equal devotion to odd machinery, also portraying sequential or chain reaction elements. Goldberg's work was commemorated posthumously in 1995 with the inclusion of _Rube Goldberg's Inventions_, depicting his 1931 "Self-Operating Napkin" in the Comic Strip Classics series of U.S. postage stamps.[31]

Film and television

Rube Goldberg wrote a feature film featuring his machines and sculptures called _Soup to Nuts_, which was released in 1930 and starred Ted Healy and the pre-Curly Howard version of The Three Stooges.

In the 1962 John Wayne movie _Hatari!,_ an invention to catch monkeys by character Pockets, played by Red Buttons, is described as a "Rube Goldberg."

In the late 1960s and early 70s, educational shows like _Sesame Street_, _Vision On_ and _The Electric Company_ routinely showed bits that involved Rube Goldberg devices, including the _Rube Goldberg Alphabet Contraption_, and the _What Happens Next Machine_.[32][33]

Various other films and cartoons have included highly complicated machines that perform simple tasks. Among these are _Flåklypa Grand Prix_, _Looney Tunes_, _Tom and Jerry_, _Wallace and Gromit_, _Pee-wee's Big Adventure_, _The Way Things Go_, _Edward Scissorhands_, _Back to the Future_, _Honey, I Shrunk the Kids_, _The Goonies_, _Gremlins_, the _Saw_ film series, _Chitty Chitty Bang Bang_, _The Cat from Outer Space_, _Malcolm_, _Hotel For Dogs_, the _Home Alone_ film series, _Family Guy_, _American Dad!_, and _Waiting..._

Also in the _Final Destination_ film series the characters often die in Rube Goldberg-esque ways. In the film _The Great Mouse Detective_, the villain Ratigan attempts to kill the film's heroes, Basil of Baker Street and David Q. Dawson, with a Rube Goldberg style device. The classic video in this genre was done by the artist duo Peter Fischli & David Weiss in 1987 with their 30-minute video _Der Lauf der Dinge_ or _The Way Things Go_.

Honda produced a video in 2003 called "The Cog" using many of the same principles that Fischli and Weiss had done in 1987.

In 2005, the American alternative rock/indie band The Bravery released a video for their debut single, "An Honest Mistake," which features the band performing the song in the middle of a Rube Goldberg machine.

In 1999, an episode of _The X-Files_ was titled "The Goldberg Variation". The episode intertwined characters FBI agents Mulder and Scully, a simple apartment super, Henry Weems (Willie Garson) and an ailing young boy, Ritchie Lupone (Shia LaBeouf) in a real-life Goldberg device.

The 2010 music video "This Too Shall Pass – RGM Version" by the rock band OK Go features a machine that, after four minutes of kinetic activity, shoots the band members in the face with paint. "RGM" presumably stands for Rube Goldberg Machine.[34]

2012 The CBS show _Elementary_ features a machine in its opening sequence.

2014 The Web Series, _Deadbeat_, on Hulu features an episode titled, "The Ghost in the Machine," which features the protagonist, Kevin, helping the ghost of Rube Goldberg complete a contraption that will bring his grandchildren together after making a collection of random items into a machine that ends up systematically injuring two of his grandchildren so they end up in the same hospital and finally meet.

Games

Both board games and video games have been inspired by Goldberg's creations, such as the 60's board game _Mouse Trap_,[35] the 1990s series of _The Incredible Machine_ games,[36] and _Crazy Machines_.[37] The _Humongous Entertainment_ game _Freddi Fish 2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse_ involves searching for the missing pieces to a Rube Goldberg machine to complete the game.

In 1909 Goldberg invented the "Foolish Questions" game based on his successful cartoon by the same name. The game was published in many versions from 1909 to 1934.[38]

_Rube Works: The Official Rube Goldberg Invention Game_, the first game authorized by The Heirs of Rube Goldberg, was published by Unity Games (the publishing arm of Unity Technologies) in November 2013.[39]
