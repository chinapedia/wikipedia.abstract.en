Personal Views

Social Entrepreneurship

In an interview with _Firstbiz_ regarding Deshpande foundation's Master’s program in social entrepreneurship, Naveen stated, "In the past ten years we've seen that there are very few people engaging in social entrepreneurship or non-profit space. To solve India's problems of healthcare, education, sanitation we need people with an entrepreneurial mindset who can create new ideas. We've been building up this (Sandbox) ecosystem in Hubli and so thought that a good master's program will help people engage with these organisations."

He also expressed positive views on the future of social entrepreneurship and the social entrepreneurship program. He said, "In the last couple of years, India has seen the young generation talking about good things they want to do. They want to be active for the benefit of society."[18]

Skill Development

In another interview with National Skills Network, Naveen expressed his concern about the huge gap between education and employment in India. He stated, "It’s apparently because our college and university education systems are unable to catch up with necessary skills and the right mind-set required at the workplace, resulting in a huge ‘skill gap’, forcing enterprises to run parallel training programs."

He went on to explain DET's approach to deliver unique experiential short-term skill training, adhering to global standards of quality and efficiency and supplementing it with strong work ethics culture. [19]
