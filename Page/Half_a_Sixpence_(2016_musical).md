_HALF A SIXPENCE_ is a musical based on the 1905 novel _Kipps_ by H. G. Wells and the original 1963 musical, with music by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe, and lyrics by Anthony Drewe and Heneker, featuring several of the original songs by Heneker, and book by Julian Fellowes.

This production was produced by Cameron Mackintosh and Chichester Festival Theatre where it premiered in July 2016 before transferring into the West End in London at the Noël Coward Theatre in October 2016.

The show closed on 2 September 2017 after three extensions to its limited run.[1]


Background

The original musical of _Half a Sixpence_, based on the novel _Kipps_ by H. G. Wells, featured music and lyrics by David Heneker and book by Beverley Cross. The musical was originally written as a star vehicle for British pop star Tommy Steele who performed the role of Kipps originally in London in 1963, Broadway in 1965 and in the 1967 film adaptation. It was evident that the show relied on Steele as the star vehicle as he featured in twelve of the musical's fifteen songs.

Following the success with _Mary Poppins_, producer Cameron Mackintosh reunited the same team of George Stiles and Anthony Drewe to adapt Heneker's original songs and create new material for the production, with Julian Fellowes re-writing an entirely new book. The creative team also reunites Stiles and Drewe with Fellowes after _Mary Poppins_ and the new musical adaptation of _The Wind in the Willows_ (which also reunites director Rachel Kavanaugh, who also directed Stiles and Drewe's _Peter Pan: A Musical Adventure_ at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in 2007).


Productions

Chichester and West End production

The musical premiered at Chichester Festival Theatre (as part of the final season of Jonathan Church as artistic director and Alan Finch as executive producer) from 14 July to 2 September 2016 as a co-production with Cameron Mackintosh. It was originally announced that Bryan Dick would star as Kipps, however he later withdrew to appear in the West End production of _Hobson's Choice_.[2] It was later announced that newcomer Charlie Stemp would take over as Arthur Kipps alongside Devon-Elise Johnson as Ann Pornick, Ian Bartholomew as Chitterlow, Emma Williams as Helen Walsingham and Vivien Parry as Mrs Walsingham.[3] The production is directed by Rachel Kavanaugh, designed by Paul Brown, choreographed by Andrew Wright, orchestrations by William David Brohn, lighting by Paule Constable, sound by Mick Potter and video design by Luke Halls.

Following rave reviews in Chichester, the production transferred to the West End in London at the Noël Coward Theatre with previews beginning 29 October and press night on 17 November 2016. It featured the original Chichester cast and ran for ten months in the West End following three extensions to its limited run. Combined with the Chichester run, the production played around 400 performances.[4]
