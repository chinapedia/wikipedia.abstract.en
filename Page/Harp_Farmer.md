Controversies

In May 2016, Harp started Stop Defaming Punjab campaign which urged people to fight against the propagation that more than 70% of the people of Punjab were into substance abuse in one form or the other. He drew a lot of flak for the campaign and was criticized by those who either had vested interests or had not actually understood the message. He was accused of being a mouthpiece for the ruling party which is thought to be primarily responsible for the widespread usage of drugs in the state. There was much hue and cry criticizing the campaign, though, individuals including renowned artists and a number of NGOs came forward to uphold the cause.[17][18][19][20][21][22][23]

Prior to that, he, along with Ankur Singh Patar had pulled up a cellphone company for using his creation in an unauthorized manner.[24]
