Life

Moffat graduated in 1985 with a B.A. in Hispanic Studies from the University of Liverpool,[9] though has said that she "almost got booted out" for neglecting her studies in favour of the Officers' Training Corps' activities.[10], and started her military training at RMAS in September 1985, graduating with SGC 853 in April 1986. In 1995 she gained an MA in Military Studies, Defence from Cranfield University.[11]

She joined the then Women's Royal Army Corps after university, and stayed in the army 26 years, including a spell as military private secretary to Geoff Hoon while he was Minister of Defence.[12] Her final posting before resigning was as Armed Forces head of pay and strategic manning at the Ministry of Defence.[13] Her resignation caused some surprise, as six months earlier she had given an interview enthusing about the army as a career for women.[14][15] She has founded the What Good Leadership Looks Like consultancy,[16][17] and appears as a speaker on awards panels.[18][19]
