"SABOR A MÍ" ("Taste of Me") is a 1959 bolero by Mexican composer and singer Álvaro Carrillo. It was internationally popularized by Los Panchos, who collaborated on their rendition with Eydie Gormé in 1964.[1] Among the over 300 songs that he created, this song was considered Carrillo's biggest hit both in Mexico and internationally.[2] Since its creation, the song has been covered by several artists, including among them Mexican singer Luis Miguel.

The autobiographical movie of Álvaro Carrillo, starring José José, uses this song name as its title.[3]


Covers

Luis Miguel version

In 1997, Mexican singer Luis Miguel covered "Sabor a Mí" on his album _Romances_. It was released as the sixth single from the album in 1998 and peaked at number six on the _Billboard_ Hot Latin Songs.[4] Miguel's cover was recognized as one of the best-performing songs of the year at the 1999 BMI Latin Awards.[5]

Miguel's rendition received unfavorable reviews from music critics. Mario Tarradell of _The Dallas Morning News_ noted that Miguel's cover of Sabor a Mí "retains some of its exotic, flamenco guitar-fueled flavor".[6] Fernando Gonzalez of the _Orange County Register_ was not impressed with Miguel's take as he felt that Miguel "sounds simply loud, rather than romantic".[7] _Los Angeles Times_ editor Ernesto Lechnero also criticized Luis Miguel's version of "Sabor a Mí" and stated that is "spun out of control with the addition of drums, reducing the lilting melody to something reminiscent of a TV commercial jingle".[8]
