The HANOVER TRUST COMPANY was a private American bank of the 1920s. Its offices were located in Boston, Massachusetts.[1]

It became infamous initially for turning down Charles Ponzi for a loan of 2,000 dollars[2] (for his IRC scheme) in 1919, and subsequently for being bought up by Charles Ponzi in July 1920.[3]
