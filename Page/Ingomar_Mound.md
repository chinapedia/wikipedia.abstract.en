Ingomar_Mound.jpg INGOMAR MOUND is the large central mound and sole remaining feature of a ceremonial center of the late Mississippian Period of cultural development. A total of 13 mounds composing the group have been excavated. Believed to be a temple mound, Ingomar is the only structure of the group not overrun by later agriculture and development, thus generally undisturbed when archeologists began studying the complex of mounds.[1] At least one of the mounds in the group was a flat-topped burial mound.[2] Ingomar is one of the largest such mounds found in the Southeast.[3] Ingomar is important because of its potential for the testing of theories about aboriginal settlement pattern hypotheses, such as the Clay's system environments theory[4] and Steponaitis' spatial efficiency theory[5][6]
