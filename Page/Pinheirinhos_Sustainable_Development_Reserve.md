History

The Pinheirinhos Sustainable Development Reserve was created by state law 12.810 of 21 February 2008. This law broke up the old Jacupiranga State Park and created the Jacupiranga Mosaic with 14 conservation units. It is administered by the state forest foundation (Fundação para Conservação e a Produção Florestal do Estado de São Paulo). In April 2011 residents of the community of Pinheirinhos das Dúvidas in the reserve, with 30 families, still had no electric power supply despite being registered since 2008 under the Luz para Todos program. The power company said work would start soon.
