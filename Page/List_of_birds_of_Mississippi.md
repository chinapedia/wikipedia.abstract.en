Northernmockingbird.jpg is the state bird of Mississippi.]]

This LIST OF BIRDS OF MISSISSIPPI contains species credibly documented in the U.S. state of Mississippi, as accepted by the Mississippi Ornithological Society Bird Records Committee (MBRC). As of March 2018, there were 426 species on the official list.[1] Of them, 22 are classed as casual as defined below, 90 are classed as accidental, and four were introduced to North America. Two species are extinct; two others are considered extirpated by the MBRC and might also be extinct.

This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the _Check-list of North American Birds_, 7th edition through the 59th Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS).[2][3] Common and scientific names are also those of the _Check-list_.

Unless otherwise noted, all species listed below are considered to occur regularly in Mississippi as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The following tags have been used to annotate some species:

-   (Ca) CASUAL - a species "generally occurring in four to eight years during a ten year period" per the MBRC
-   (A) ACCIDENTAL - a species "generally occurring three or fewer years during a ten year period" per the MBRC
-   (I) INTRODUCED - a species that has been introduced to Mississippi by the actions of humans, either directly or indirectly
-   (E) EXTIRPATED - a species no longer found in Mississippi though populations exist elsewhere
-   (Ext) EXTINCT - a recent species that no longer exists

Cranes

ORDER: GruiformesFAMILY: Gruidae

Cranes are large, tall birds with long legs and long necks. Unlike the similar-looking but unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks extended.

Northern storm-petrels

ORDER: ProcellariiformesFAMILY: Hydrobatidae

Though the members of this family are similar in many respects to the southern storm-petrels, including their general appearance and habits, there are enough genetic differences to warrant their placement in a separate family.

-   Band-rumped storm-petrel, _Oceanodroma castro_ (A)
