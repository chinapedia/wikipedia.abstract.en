He moved to Haddington, East Lothian in 1833 to oversee the design and building of the County Buildings there, and settled there thereafter. In 1863 he became Provost of the town.[1]

He died on 16 December 1878 and is buried in the churchyard of St Mary's Collegiate Church, Haddington, against the northern wall.
