THE PAVILION THEATRE at 191â€“193 Whitechapel Road, London, was the first major theatre to open in London's East End. It was destroyed by fire in 1856 and rebuilt as the NEW ROYAL PAVILION THEATRE.


History

The theatre was opened in 1828 on the site of a former factory, and was the first major theatre to open in London's East End.[1] The first managers were William Wyatt and John Farrell.[2]

The first Pavilion Theatre was entirely destroyed by fire on 13 February 1856, and was rebuilt in 1858 as the New Royal Pavilion Theatre, with a capacity of 3,500.[3] It was further reconstructed in 1871 by the architect J. T. Robinson, and the capacity increased to 4,000.[4] Charles Dickens, Jr. (eldest child of Charles Dickens), in his 1879 book _Dickens's Dictionary of London_, described the Pavilion this way: "A large East-end theatre capable of holding considerably over 3,000 persons. Melodrama of a rough type, farce, pantomime, &c."[5]

In the early 20th century it became the home of Yiddish theatre, catering to the large Jewish population of the area, and gave birth to the Anglo-Jewish 'Whitechapel Boys' avant-garde literary and artistic movement.

In later years, it operated under the names, Royal Clarence Theatre, Eastern Opera House, and New Royal Pavilion Theatre,[6] continuing in business until 1935. The building was demolished in 1962.
