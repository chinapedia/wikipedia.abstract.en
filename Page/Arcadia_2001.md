ARCADIA 2001 is a second-generation 8-bit console released by Emerson Radio in May 1982, several months before the release of ColecoVision. It was discontinued only 18 months later, with a total of 35 games having been released.[1] Emerson licensed the Arcadia 2001 to Bandai, which released it in Japan.[2] Over 30 Arcadia 2001 clones exist.

The unrelated Arcadia Corporation, manufacturer of the Atari 2600 Supercharger add-on, was sued by Emerson for trademark infringement. Arcadia Corporation then changed its name to Starpath.[3]


Description

The Arcadia is much smaller than its contemporary competitors and is powered by a standard 12-volt power supply so it can be used in a boat or a vehicle. It also has two outputs (or inputs) headphone jacks on the back of the unit, on the far left and far right sides.

The system came with two Intellivision-style controllers with a 12-button keypad and 'fire' buttons on the sides. The direction pads have a removable joystick attachment. Most games came with BoPET overlays that could be applied to the controller's keypads. The console itself had five buttons: power, start, reset, option, and select.

There are at least three different types of cartridge case styles[4] and artwork, with variations on each. Emerson-family cartridges come in two different lengths (short and long) of black plastic cases.

Bandai Arcadia

In 1982, the Bandai Arcadia, a variant of the Emerson Arcadia 2001, was released in Japan by Bandai. There were four Japan-exclusive game releases developed by Bandai which were the only known Arcadia titles written by other companies than UA Ltd.

-   _Doraemon_
-   _Dr. Slump_
-   _Mobile Soldier Gundam_
-   _Super Dimension Fortress Macross_


Reception

After seeing the Arcadia 2001 at the summer 1982 Consumer Electronics Show, Danny Goodman of _Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games_ reported that its graphics were similar to the Atari 2600's, and that "our overall impression of the game play was favorable for a system in this price range, though no cartridge stands out as being an exciting original creation". He called the controller offering both Intellivision-like disc and joystick functionality "A great idea".[5]


Games

Emerson planned to launch the console with 19 games. Some Arcadia 2001 games are ports of lesser-known arcade games such as _Route 16_, _Jungler_, and _Jump Bug_, which were not available on other home systems.

Emerson actually created many popular arcade titles including _Pac-Man_, _Galaxian_ and _Defender_ for the Arcadia, but never had them manufactured as Atari started to sue its competitor companies for releasing games to which it had exclusive-rights agreements.[6] Early marketing showed popular arcade games, but they were later released as clones. For instance, the Arcadia 2001 game _Space Raiders_ is a clone of _Defender_, and _Breakaway_ is a clone of _Breakout_.[7]
