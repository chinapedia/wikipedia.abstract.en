The borders of District 3 are defined in the Nevada Revised Statutes using census tracts, block groups, and blocks.[3] Since its creation, senatorial elections have been held twice in the district.

Elections

2012

During the 2012 election, voters of the third district could choose between Democrat Tick Segerblom, who was a member of the Assembly between 2006 and 2012, and Republican Ed Gobel, who is a veteran.[9] Since no other candidates filed for the office, no primaries were held.[10] Segerblom focussed in his campaign on criminal justice issues, raising corporate taxes, and raising the gasoline tax. Gobel, on the other hand, argued that taxes should not be raised.[11] Segerblom won the election, that was held on November 6, with nearly 65% of the votes.[12]

2016

In 2016, incumbent Segerblom ran for re-election. He was contested by Republican Dennis Palmerston and Libertarian Jonathan Friedrich, a former general contractor.[13] No primaries were held.[14] Segerblom said again he would advocate criminal justice reform to reduce the number of prisoners. Furthermore, he said he supported the legalization of recreational marihuana. Libertarian contender Friedrich said he was against the legalization of marihuana, and criticized homeowner associations. Friedrich had never held public office before. Palmerston did not actively campaign. The election on November 8 was won by incumbent Segerblom, who received just over 60% of the votes.[15]
