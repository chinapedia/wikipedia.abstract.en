The EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF POSTAL AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ADMINISTRATIONS (CEPT) was established on June 26, 1959, as a coordinating body for European state telecommunications and postal organizations. The acronym comes from the French version of its name _Conférence européenne des administrations des postes et des télécommunications_.

CEPT was responsible for the creation of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in 1988.

CEPT is organised into three main components:

-   Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) - responsible for radiocommunications and telecommunications matters and formed by the merger of ECTRA (European Committee for Telecommunications Regulatory Affairs) and ERC (European Radiocommunications Committee) in September 2001[1]
    -   The permanent secretariat of the ECC is the European Communications Office (ECO)
-   European Committee for Postal Regulation (CERP, after the French _"Comité européen des régulateurs postaux"_) - responsible for postal matters
-   The Committee for ITU Policy (Com-ITU) is responsible for organising the co-ordination of CEPT actions for the preparation for and during the course of the ITU activities meetings of the Council, Plenipotentiary Conferences, World Telecommunication Development Conferences, World Telecommunication Standardisation Assemblies
