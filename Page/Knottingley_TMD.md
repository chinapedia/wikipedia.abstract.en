KNOTTINGLEY TMD is a Traction Maintenance Depot located in Knottingley, West Yorkshire, England. The depot is situated on the Pontefract Line and is near Knottingley station.[1] It opened in 1967 to maintain the locomotives and hopper wagons for a planned 75 Merry-go-round trains a day, expected to use the Wakefield and Goole line.[2]


History

In 1976, Class 03, 04, 08 shunters and Class 47 locomotives could be seen at the depot.[3] During the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s the depot was home to Class 56 and from the mid eighties, Class 58 locomotives.[4]

When the depot opened in July 1967, it was given the depot code of 56A, which had previously been a code used in Wakefield for a shed that had closed in June of 1967.[5] Later that year, it was renumbered to 55G, however since 1973 when the TOPS system was introduced, the depot code has been _KY_.[6]


Allocation

As of 2016, the depot's allocation consists of DB Cargo UK Class 60 and 66 locomotives.


Traffic in 2018

Of the three power stations the depot was built to serve, Ferrybridge was closed on 31 March 2016,[7] while Eggborough was officially decommissioned in February 2018. However, the depot is still busy with gypsum and biomass traffic, particularly for the remaining Power Station at Drax, with workings from the Humber ports at Hull and Immingham.[8]
