GEORGE WYLD (1821 - 1906) was a Scottish homeopathic physician and Christian Theosophist.


Career

Wyld became interested in homeopathic medicine in 1851 after discovering the work of Samuel Hahnemann whilst a medical student at Edinburgh. After he obtained his M. D. he moved to London where he taught homeopathic medicine and in 1876 became president of the British Homeopathic Society.[1]

Wyld was interested in mesmerism, spiritualism and Theosophy. He has been described as one of the "oldest mesmerists in England".[2] Wyld was also a proponent of phrenology. He 1844 he joined the London Phrenological Society.[3] He was a convinced spiritualist, in 1854 he met the medium Daniel Dunglas Home.[4]

In October 1876 he defended the fraudulent slate-writing medium Henry Slade at his trial. He help to organize a spiritualists defense fund to cover Slade's legal costs. Because of this he received great criticism from the medical community.[5]

Wyld was a vice-president for the British National Association of Spiritualists and an early member of the Society for Psychical Research.[6][7]


Theosophy

In the 1879 he joined the British Theosophical Society and was its president during 1880-1882. He resigned in 1882 due to Madame Blavatsky's opposition to Christianity.[8]

Wyld was originally impressed by Blavatsky, believing her to possess mediumistic powers but later fell out with her, describing her as a rude and vulgar woman. He resigned after she had written an article in _The Theosophist_ claiming "there is no personal or impersonal God." However, he did not abandon Theosophy altogether, he formed his own hybrid version of Christianity with Theosophy known as Christo-Theosophy.[9]
