Born in Budweis, he emigrated to the United States in 1892 and resided in Cleveland, Ohio, until 1904, when he became a member of the modeling staff of the American Museum. He was known for his realistic large-scale models including the flea, house fly, and spider. As an entomologist he focused on treehoppers (Membracidae), authoring eight papers on their biology.[1][2][3]
