_I CALLED HIM MORGAN_ is a 2016 Swedish-American documentary film, written and directed by Kasper Collin, about the life of jazz trumpeter Lee Morgan.

It premiered out of competition at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival after being pitched at the 2012 MeetMarket at Doc/Fest.[1] After Venice, it went on to play Telluride Film Festival,[2] Toronto International Film Festival,[3][4][5][6][7] New York Film Festival,[8][9][10][11] and BFI London Film Festival. After Toronto, Vox.com described the film as "an Oscar winner for best documentary feature just waiting to happen".[12] The New Yorker dubbed the documentary, together with Moonlight and The Hedonists, as New York Film Festival's Breakout Films.[13]

_I Called Him Morgan_ had its US theatrical premiere on March 24, 2017. It premiered in Sweden on March 31, in Canada on April 7, and in the United Kingdom on July 28. In his _New York Times_ review, A.O. Scott called the film "a delicate human drama about love, ambition and the glories of music".[14] _Los Angeles Times_ critic Kenneth Turan noted that "As a slice of recovered and illuminated time, “I Called Him Morgan” has few peers".[15] And in the _Wall Street Journal_, film critic Joe Morgenstern wrote in his review that "Musicians sometimes paraphrase Debussy, or one another, in saying that music is the silence between the notes. “I Called Him Morgan” has it all—the notes and the silence, plus the music of spoken language, pitched in rueful tones of recollection".[16]

On July 1 2017, Metacritic announced the film as the best reviewed movie of the first half of 2017.[17] As of October 1, 2017, _I Called Him Morgan_ was listed as the third best reviewed movie of the year.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 95% "Certified Fresh" score based on 44 reviews,[18] describing it as "a seductive tribute to its subject's jazz passion as well as an absorbing look at a fatally doomed relationship".

Esquire magazine's list of the best documentaries of 2017 placed _I Called Him Morgan_ at the top.[19] The film was also included in mid-year best-of lists in the _Los Angeles Times_, _The Playlist_, _Thrillist_ and _Paste Magazine_.

Among the participants in _I Called Him Morgan_ are Wayne Shorter, Jymie Merritt, Billy Harper, Judith Johnson, Bennie Maupin, Larry Ridley, Paul West, Larry Reni Thomas, Al Harrison, Charli Persip and Albert "Tootie" Heath.

On July 24 2017, the film premiered on Netflix worldwide, except in the UK and Sweden. The UK premiere was on August 8, 2017.

_I Called Him Morgan_ is director Kasper Collin's second feature documentary, the first being _My Name Is Albert Ayler_.[20]
