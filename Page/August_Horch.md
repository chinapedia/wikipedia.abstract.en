His initial trade was as a blacksmith, and then was educated at Hochschule Mittweida (Mittweida Technical College). After receiving a degree in engineering, he worked in shipbuilding. Horch worked for Karl Benz from 1896, before founding _A. Horch & Co._ in November 1899, in Ehrenfeld, Cologne, Germany.[1]


Manufacturing

Horch left the company in 1909 after a dispute, and set up in competition in Zwickau. His new firm was initially called _Horch Automobil-Werke GmbH_, but following a legal dispute over the _Horch_ name, he decided to make another automobile company. (The court decided that _Horch_ was a registered trademark on behalf of August Horch's former partners and August Horch was not entitled to use it any more). Consequently, Horch named his new company _Audi Automobilwerke GmbH_ in 1910, _Audi_ being the Latinization of Horch.


Post Audi

Horch left Audi in 1920 and went to Berlin and took various jobs. He published his autobiography, _I Built Cars (Ich Baute Autos)_ in 1937. He also served on the board of Auto Union, the successor to Audi Automobilwerke GmbH. He was an honorary citizen of Zwickau and had a street named for his Audi cars in both Zwickau and his birthplace Winningen. He was made an honorary professor at Braunschweig University of Technology.[2]
