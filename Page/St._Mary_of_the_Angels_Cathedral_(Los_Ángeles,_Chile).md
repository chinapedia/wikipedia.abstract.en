It was built between the years 1970 and 1972. On the frontis are shown different scenes of the Holy Trinity. The interior of the temple has no columns, so you can see a complete panoramic view.

The interior walls are ornamented with fragments of the Bible and on one side is placed the image of the Virgin of Carmen carved in native wood.
