_THE GREASY POLE_ (in , ) is a painting by Francisco de Goya.


Analysis

Like the rest of the series, the painting is based on a popular scene of a vertical greased Cockaigne pole. The greasy pole is a popular theme of the iconography of the eighteenth century that Goya had already used for his tapestry drawings. During Cockaigne, boys climb and fight to reach the top of the pole. The background landscape is blurred, but it is possible to distinguish farms and a crowd gathered at the foot of the pole.
