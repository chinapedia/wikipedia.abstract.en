"JOY SPRING" is a 1954 jazz composition by Clifford Brown that became his signature work. It is the name he called his wife, Emma LaRue Anderson _(maiden;_ 1933–2005),[1] who he married June 26, 1954 – on her 21st birthday – in Los Angeles.[2]


Early history

Brown first recorded "Joy Spring" in a studio session led by him on August 6, 1954, at Capitol Recording Studios, in Los Angeles, with Harold Land (tenor sax), Richie Powell (piano), George Morrow (bass), and Max Roach (drums). They did two takes – and .[3][4]

Six days later (August 12, 1954), at the same studio, Brown, as leader, recorded Jack Montrose's arrangement of it with Stu Williamson (valve trombone), Zoot Sims (tenor sax), Bob Gordon (bari sax), Russ Freeman (piano), Joe Mondragon (bass), Shelly Manne (drums). That take has been issued on several albums, including (i) _Jazz Messages_ (Jazztone ), (ii) _Clifford Brown & Max Roach_ (Pacific Jazz ), and (iii) _Jazz Imortal – Featuring Zoot Sims_ (1988; Pacific Jazz ).[5]

There is an anecdote tied to this composition. Larue Anderson, before marrying Brown, had been a classical music student at the University of Southern California.[6] Absent any knowledge of jazz theory – and in particular, absent any knowledge of bebop articulations, phrasing, and the use of half-step progressions, tritone substitutions, and other musical features of the style – she began writing a thesis titled "Jazz versus the Arts." Max Roach, her friend who introduced her to Brown, took her aside and said: "Honey, the whole world is not built around tonic / dominant." He convinced her to the point that she became a jazz devotee.[7][8]
