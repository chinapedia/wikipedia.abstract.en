The '''Jahangiris ''', also called SWATIS, is a tribe of Pashtun people found in Pakistan, and in some eastern parts of Afghanistan. The JAHANGIRIS (1190-1520), a dynasty, were originally called Sultani.

A dynasty of Sultans who, according to Raverty, once ruled from Nangrahar to the Jhelum but, by the time the Kheshi Pathans overran Swat, their sway did not extend far beyond the Indus on the east. They claim descent from Alexander Biccortunus.

The first Muslim masters of Swat were Pathan Dilzak tribes from south-east Afghanistan. These were later ousted by Swati Pathans, who were succeeded in the sixteenth century by Yusufzai Pathans. Both groups of Pathans came from the Kabul Valley.

After The defeat in various wars against Zaheeruddin Babar many of these Jahangiris moved through out what is now the north west Pakistan especially in Manshera near Abbottabad,Pakistan and the some parts of Afghanistan.
