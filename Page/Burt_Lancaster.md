BURTON STEPHEN LANCASTER (November 2, 1913 – October 20, 1994) was an American actor and producer. Initially known for playing "tough guys", he went on to achieve success with more complex and challenging roles. He was nominated four times for Academy Awards, and won once for his work in _Elmer Gantry_ in 1960. He also won a Golden Globe Award for that performance and BAFTA Awards for _Birdman of Alcatraz_ (1962) and _Atlantic City_ (1980).

During the 1950s his production company Hecht-Hill-Lancaster was highly successful, making films such as _Trapeze_ (1956), _Sweet Smell of Success_ (1957), _Run Silent, Run Deep_ (1958), and _Separate Tables_ (1958). The American Film Institute ranks Lancaster as #19 of the greatest male stars of classic Hollywood cinema.[1]


Early life

Burton Stephen Lancaster was born on November 2, 1913, in Manhattan, New York, at his parents' home at 209 East 106th Street, the son of Elizabeth (_née_ Roberts) and mailman James Henry Lancaster.[2] Both of his parents were Protestants of working-class origin. All four of his grandparents were British immigrants to the United States, from the province of Ulster; his maternal grandparents were from Belfast and were descendants of English immigrants to Ireland.[3]

Lancaster grew up in East Harlem and spent much of his time on the streets, where he developed a great interest and skill in gymnastics while attending DeWitt Clinton High School, where he was a basketball star. Before he graduated from DeWitt Clinton, his mother died of a cerebral hemorrhage. Lancaster was accepted by New York University with an athletic scholarship, but subsequently dropped out.[4]


Circus and military careers

Circus

At 19, Lancaster met Nick Cravat, with whom he developed a lifelong partnership. Together they learned to act in local theatre productions and circus arts at Union Settlement, one of the city's oldest settlement houses.[5] They formed the acrobat duo Lang and Cravat in the 1930s and soon joined the Kay Brothers circus. However, in 1939, an injury forced Lancaster to give up the profession, with great regret. He then found temporary work, first as a salesman for Marshall Fields and then as a singing waiter in various restaurants.[6]

World War II

With the United States having then entered World War II, Lancaster joined the United States Army in 1942 and performed with the Army's 21st Special Services Division, one of the military groups organized to follow the troops on the ground and provide USO entertainment to keep up morale. He served with General Mark Clark's Fifth Army in Italy from 1943 to 1945.[7]


Acting career

Broadway

Killers001.jpg in _The Killers_ (1946)]] Lancaster returned to New York after his Army service. Although initially unenthusiastic about acting, Lancaster was encouraged to audition for a Broadway play by a producer who saw him while he was visiting his then-girlfriend at work. The audition was successful and Lancaster was cast in Harry Brown's _A Sound of Hunting_ (1945). The show only ran three weeks, but his performance attracted the interest of a Hollywood agent, Harold Hecht. Lancaster had other offers but Hecht promised him the opportunity to produce their own movies within five years of hitting Hollywood.

Through Hecht, Lancaster was brought to the attention of producer Hal B. Wallis, who signed him to a non-exclusive eight-movie contract.

Hal Wallis

Lancaster's first filmed movie was _Desert Fury_ (1947) for Wallis, where Lancaster was billed after John Hodiak and Lizabeth Scott. It was directed by Lewis Allen.[8]

Then producer Mark Hellinger approached him to star in _The Killers_ (1946), which was completed and released prior to _Desert Fury_. Directed by Robert Siodmak it was a great critical success and launched Lancaster and his co-star Ava Gardner to stardom. It has since come to be regarded as a classic.[9]

Hellinger used Lancaster again on _Brute Force_ (1947), a prison drama written by Richard Brooks and directed by Jules Dassin. It was also well received.[10] Wallis released his films through Paramount, and so Lancaster and other Wallis contractees made cameos in _Variety Girl_ (1947).

Lancaster's next film was for Wallis, _I Walk Alone_ (1947), a thriller co-starring Scott and a young Kirk Douglas, who was also under contract to Wallis. It was a minor hit.[11]

Lancaster had a change of pace with the film adaptation of Arthur Miller's _All My Sons_ (1948), made at Universal with Edward G. Robinson. His third film for Wallis was an adaptation of _Sorry, Wrong Number_ (1948) with Barbara Stanwyck.

Norma Productions

Hecht kept to his promise to Lancaster to turn producer. The two of them formed a company, Norma Productions, and did a deal with Universal to make a thriller in England, _Kiss the Blood Off My Hands_ (1948) with Joan Fontaine and directed by Norman Foster. It made a profit of only $50,000, but was critically acclaimed.[12]

Back in Hollywood, Lancaster did another film noir with Siodmak, _Criss Cross_ (1949). It was originally going to be produced by Hellinger and when Hellinger died another took over. Tony Curtis made an early appearance.

Lancaster did a fourth for Wallis, _Rope of Sand_ (1949).

Norma Productions signed a three-picture deal with Warner Bros. The first was _The Flame and the Arrow_ (1950), a swashbuckler movie, in which Lancaster drew on his circus skills. Nick Cravat had a support role and the film was a huge commercial success, making of $6 million. It was Warners' most popular film of the year and established an entirely new image for Lancaster.[13]

Lancaster was borrowed by 20th Century Fox for _Mister 880_ (1950), a comedy with Edmund Gwenn. MGM put him in a popular Western, _Vengeance Valley_ (1951),[14] then he went to Warners to pay the title role in the biopic _Jim Thorpe -- All-American_ (1951).

Halburt

Norma signed a deal with Columbia to make two films through a Norma subsidiary, Halburt. The first film was _Ten Tall Men_ (1951) where Lancaster was a member of the French Foreign Legion. Robert Aldrich worked on the movie as a production manager.

The second was a comedy _The First Time_ (1952), a comedy which was the directorial debut of Frank Tashlin. It was meant to star Lancaster but he wound up not appearing in the film - the first of their productions in which he did not act.)[15]

Hecht-Lancaster Productions

In 1951 the actor/producer duo changed the company's name to Hecht-Lancaster Productions. The first film under the new name was another swashbuckler: _The Crimson Pirate_ (1952), directed by Siodmak. Co-starring Cravat, it was extremely popular.

Lancaster changed pace one more by doing a straight dramatic part in _Come Back, Little Sheba_ (1952), based on a Broadway hit, with Shirley Booth, produced by Wallis and directed by Daniel Mann.

Alternating with adventure films, he went into _South Sea Woman_ (1952) at Warners. Part of the Norma-Warners contract was that Lancaster had to appear in some non-Norma films, of which this was one.[16]

Lancaster played one of his best-remembered roles with Deborah Kerr in _From Here to Eternity_ (1953) for Columbia, directed by Fred Zinnemann. The American Film Institute acknowledged the iconic status of the scene from that film in which he and Deborah Kerr kiss on a Hawaiian beach amid the crashing waves. The organization named it one of "AFI's top 100 Most Romantic Films" of all time. Lancaster's performance earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Awarded the Oscar for Best Picture of the Year, the film would be one of the most critically acclaimed Lancaster ever made.

For his own company, Lancaster produced and starred in _His Majesty O'Keefe_ (1954), a South Sea island tale shot in Fiji. It was co-written by James Hill who would soon become a part of the Hecht-Lancaster partnership.[17]

United Artists

Hecht and Lancaster left Warners for United Artists for what began as a two-picture deal, the first of which was to be _Apache_ (1954), starring Lancaster as a Native American.[18][19]

They followed it with another Western, _Vera Cruz_ (1954) co-starring Gary Cooper and produced by Hill. Both films were directed by Robert Aldrich and were hugely popular.

United Artists signed Hecht-Lancaster to a multi-picture contract, to make seven films over two years.[20] These included films which Lancaster did not act in. Their first was _Marty_ (1955), based on Paddy Chayefsky's TV play starring Ernest Borgnine and directed by Delbert Mann. It won both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Palme d'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival. It also earned $2 million on a budget of $350,000.[21] _Vera Cruz_ had been a huge success but _Marty_ secured Hecht-Lancaster as one of the most successful independent production companies in Hollywood at the time.[22]

Without Hill, Hecht and Lancaster produced _The Kentuckian_ (1955) was directed by Lancaster in his directorial debut. He also played a lead role. Lancaster disliked directing and only did it once more, in the 1970s.[23]

Lancaster still had commitments with Wallis, and made _The Rose Tattoo_ (1955) for him, starring with Anna Magnani and directed by Daniel Mann. It was very popular at the box office and critically acclaimed, winning Magnani an Oscar.[24]

Hecht-Hill-Lancaster

In 1955 Hill was made an equal partner in the company and the name was upgraded to Hecht-Hill-Lancaster, releasing their first film in 1956, _Trapeze_, in which Lancaster performed many of his own stunts. _Trapeze_, co-starring Tony Curtis and Gina Lollobrigida, went on to become the production company's top box office success. United Artists expanded its deal with HHL.[25]

In 1956 Lancaster and Hecht entered the music industry with the companies Hecht-Lancaster & Buzzell Music and Calyork Music.[26]

The "H-H-L" team impressed Hollywood with its success; as _Life_ wrote in 1957, "[a]fter the independent production of a baker's dozen of pictures, it has yet to have its first flop ... (They were also good pictures.)." [27] In late 1957 they announced they would make ten films worth $14 million in 1958.[28]

Lancaster did two films for Wallis, to complete his eight film commitment for that produce: _The Rainmaker_ (1956) with Katharine Hepburn, which earned Lancaster a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor; and _Gunfight at the O.K. Corral_ (1957) with Kirk Douglas, directed by John Sturges, which was a huge commercial hit.

Lancaster worked with Tony Curtis again on _Sweet Smell of Success_ (1957), a co-production between Hecht-Hill-Lancaster and Curtis' own company Curtleigh Productions (co-owned with his wife, Janet Leigh). The movie, directed by Alexander Mackendrick, was a critical success but a commercial disappointment. Over the years it has come to be regarded as one of Lancaster's greatest films.[29]

Hecht-Hill-Lancaster produced seven additional films in the late 1950s. Four starred Lancaster: _Run Silent, Run Deep_ (1958), a war film with Clark Gable, directed by Robert Wise, which was mildly popular; _Separate Tables_ (1958), with Kerr and Rita Hayworth (who married James Hill), based on a play by Terence Rattigan which received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and Oscar awards for David Niven and Wendy Hiller and was both a critical and commercial success; _The Devil's Disciple_ (1959), with Douglas and Laurence Olivier, which lost money (and saw Lancaster fire Mackendirck during shooting);[30] and _The Unforgiven_ (1960), with Audrey Hepburn, which was a critical and commercial disappointment.[31]

Three were made without Lancaster, all of which lost money: _The Bachelor Party_ (1957), from another TV play by Chayefsky, and directed by Delbert Mann; _Take a Giant Step_ (1959), about a black student; and _Summer of the Seventeenth Doll_ (1960), from an Australian play, shot in Australia and Britain.

Additionally, Hecht-Hill-Lancaster served as the production company for the 1960-1961 TV series _Whiplash_.

The Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions company dissolved in 1960 after Hill ruptured his relationship with both Hecht and Lancaster.[32]

Hecht and Lancaster

Burt_Lancaster_1960.jpg]] Lancaster played the title role in _Elmer Gantry_ (1960), written and directed by Richard Brooks for United Artists. The film received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor. Lancaster won the 1960 Academy Award for Best Actor, a Golden Globe Award, and the New York Film Critics Award for his performance.

Hecht and Lancaster worked together on _The Young Savages_ (1961), directed by John Frankenheimer and produced by Hecht. Sydney Pollack worked as a dialogue coach.

Lancaster starred in _Judgment at Nuremberg_ (1961) for Stanley Kramer, alongside Spencer Tracy, Richard Widmark and a number of other iconic stars. The film was both a commercial and critical success, receiving 11 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. He then did another with Hecht and Frankenheimer (replacing Charles Crichton, _Birdman of Alcatraz_ (1962). The second film earned Lancaster a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Hecht went on to produce five films without Lancaster's assistance, through his company Harold Hecht Films Productions between 1961 and 1967, including another Academy Award winner, _Cat Ballou_, starring Lee Marvin and Jane Fonda.

Collaborations with younger filmmakers

Lancaster made _A Child Is Waiting_ (1963) with Judy Garland. It was produced by Kramer and directed by John Cassavetes.[33]

He went to Italy to star in _The Leopard_ (1963) for Luchino Visconti, co-starring Alain Delon and Claudia Cardinale. It was one of Lancaster's favourite films and was a big hit in France but failed in the US (though the version released was much truncated.)[34]

He had a small role in _The List of Adrian Messenger_ (1963) for producer/star Kirk Douglas, and then did two for Frankenheimer: _Seven Days in May_ (1964), a political thriller with Douglas, and _The Train_ (1964), a World War Two action film (Lancaster had Frankenheimer replace Arthur Penn several days into filming).

Lancaster starred in _The Hallelujah Trail_ (1965), a comic Western produced and directed by John Sturges which failed to recoup its large cost.[35]

He had a big hit with _The Professionals_ (1966), a Western directed by Brooks and co-starring Lee Marvin.

In 1966 at the age of 52, Lancaster appeared nude in director Frank Perry's film _The Swimmer_ (1968), in what the critic Roger Ebert called "his finest performance".[36] Prior to working on _The Swimmer_, Lancaster was terrified of the water because he did not know how to swim. In preparation for the film, he took swimming lessons from UCLA swim coach Bob Horn.[37] Filming was difficult and clashes between Lancaster and Perry led to Sydney Pollack coming in to do some filming.[38] The film was not released until 1968, when it proved to be a commercial failure, though Lancaster remained proud of the movie and his performance.

Norlan Productions

Burt_Lancaster_-_Audrey_Hepburn_-_1960.JPG in _The Unforgiven_ (1960)]] In 1967, Lancaster formed a new partnership with Roland Kibbee, who had already worked as a writer on five Lancaster projects; _Ten Tall Men_, _The Crimson Pirate_, _Three Sailors and a Girl_ (in which Lancaster made a cameo appearance), _Vera Cruz_ and _The Devil's Disciple_. Through Norlan Productions, Lancaster and Kibbee produced _The Scalphunters_ (1968), directed by Sydney Pollack.

Lancaster followed it with another film from Pollack, _Castle Keep_ (1969), which was a big flop. So was _The Gypsy Moths_ (1969] for Frankenheimer.[39]

1970s

Lancaster had one of the biggest successes of his career with _Airport_ (1970), starring alongside Dean Martin, Jean Seberg and Jacqueline Bisset. The film received 9 academy award nominations, including one for Best Picture. It became one of the biggest box-office hits of 1970 and, at that time, reportedly the highest-grossing film in the history of Universal Pictures.

He went into a series of Westerns: _Lawman_ (1971) directed by Michael Winner; _Valdez Is Coming_ (1971), for Norlan; and _Ulzana's Raid_ (1972), directed by Aldrich and produced by himself and Hecht. None were particularly popular but _Ulzana's Raid_ has become a cult film.[40]

Lancaster did two thrillers: _Scorpio_ (1973) with Winner and _Executive Action_ (1973).

Lancaster returned to directing with _The Midnight Man_ (1974), which he also wrote and produced with Kibee.

He made a second film with Visconti, _Conversation Piece_ (1974) and played the title role in the TV series _Moses the Lawgiver_ (1974).

Lancaster was one of many names in _1900_ (1975), directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, and he had a cameo in _Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson_ (1976) for Robert Altman.

He played Shimon Peres in the TV movie _Victory at Entebbe_ (1977) and had a support role in _The Cassandra Crossing_ (1976). He made a fourth a final film with Aldrich, _Twilight's Last Gleaming_ (1977) and had the title role in _The Island of Dr. Moreau_ (1978).[41]

Lancaster was top-billed in _Go Tell the Spartans_ (1978), a Vietnam War film; Lancaster admired the script so much he took a reduced fee and donated money to help the movie be completed. He was in _Zulu Dawn_ (1979).[42]

1980s

Lancaster began the 1980s with a highly acclaimed performance in _Atlantic City_ (1980), directed by Louis Malle. The film received 5 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and a Best Actor nomination for Lancaster.

He had key roles in _Cattle Annie and Little Britches_ (1981), _The Skin_ (1982) with Cardinale, _Marco Polo_ (1982) and _Local Hero_ (1983).

By now Lancaster was mostly a character actor in features, as in _The Osterman Weekend_ (1983), but he was the lead in the TV movie _Scandal Sheet_ (1985).

He was in _Little Treasure_ (1985), directed by Alan Sharp who had written _Ulzana's Raid_; _On Wings of Eagles_ (1986) for TV, as Bull Simons; _Barnum_ (1986) for TV, in the title role; _Tough Guys_ (1986) with Douglas, _Fathers and Sons: A German Tragedy_ (1986) for German TV, _Control_ (1987) in Italy, _Rocket Gibraltar_ (1988), and _The Jeweller's Shop_ (1989).

His first big hit in a while was _Field of Dreams_ (1989) in which he played a support role as Moonlight Graham. He was in the miniseries _The Betrothed_ (1989).

Final years

Lancaster's final performances included _The Phantom of the Opera_ (1990) for TV; _Voyage of Terror: The Achille Lauro Affair_ (1990) as Leon Klinghoffer; and _Separate But Equal_ (1991) with Sidney Poitier.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Lancaster has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard.

Lancaster appeared in a total of 17 films produced by his agent Harold Hecht. Eight of these were co-produced by James Hill. He also appeared in eight films produced by Hal B. Wallis and two with producer Mark Hellinger. Although Lancaster's work alongside Kirk Douglas was mostly known as a successful pair of actors, Douglas, in fact, produced four films for the pair, through his production companies Bryna Productions and Joel Productions. Roland Kibbee also produced three Lancaster films. Lancaster was also cast in two Stanley Kramer productions.

John Frankenheimer directed five films with Lancaster: _The Young Savages_ (1961), _Birdman of Alcatraz_ (1962), _Seven Days in May_ (1964), _The Train_ (1964), and _The Gypsy Moths_ (1969). He was directed four times by Robert Aldrich, three times by Robert Siodmak and Sydney Pollack, and twice by Byron Haskin, Daniel Mann, John Sturges, John Huston, Richard Brooks, Alexander Mackendrick, Luchino Visconti, and Michael Winner.

Roland Kibbee wrote for seven Lancaster films. Lancaster used make-up veteran Robert Schiffer in 20 credited films, hiring Schiffer on nearly all the films he produced.


Personal life

Bill_Lancaster_1967.JPG in _The Big Valley_ (1967)]]

Marriages and relationships

Lancaster vigorously guarded his private life. He was married three times. His first two marriages, to June Ernst from 1935 to 1946 and Norma Anderson from 1946 to 1969, ended in divorce. His third marriage, to Susan Martin, lasted from September 1990 until his death in 1994. All five of his children were with Anderson: Bill (who became an actor and screenwriter), James, Susan, Joanna, and Sighle (pronounced "Sheila"). Friends say he claimed he was romantically involved with Deborah Kerr during the filming of _From Here to Eternity_ in 1953.[43] However, Kerr stated that while there was a spark of attraction, nothing ever happened. He reportedly had an affair with Joan Blondell.[44]

In her 1980 autobiography, Shelley Winters claimed to have had a long affair with him.[45] Recent biographers and others suggest that Lancaster was bisexual, and that he had intimate relationships with men as well as women.[46] According to testimony in Kate Buford's _Burt Lancaster: An American Life_, Lancaster was devotedly loyal to his friends and family. Old friends from his childhood remained his friends for life.[47]

Political views

Lancaster was a vocal supporter of liberal political causes, and he frequently spoke out in support of racial minorities, such as when he attended the March on Washington in 1963.[48][49] He was a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War and right-wing political movements such as McCarthyism,[50] and he helped pay for the successful defense of a soldier accused of "fragging" (murdering) another soldier during that war.[51] In 1968, Lancaster actively supported the presidential candidacy of antiwar Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota, and frequently spoke on his behalf during the Democratic primaries.[52] He campaigned heavily for George McGovern in the 1972 presidential election.[53] In 1985, Lancaster joined the fight against AIDS after his close friend, Rock Hudson, contracted the disease.[54] He campaigned for Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential election.

Legacy

The centennial of Lancaster's birth was honored at New York City's Film Society of Lincoln Center in May 2013 with the screening of 12 of the actor's best-known films, from _The Killers_ to _Atlantic City_.[55]

Religion

Despite his Protestant background and upbringing, Lancaster identified as an atheist later in life.[56]


Health problems

As Lancaster grew older he became increasingly wracked with atherosclerosis, and barely survived a routine gall bladder operation in January 1980. Following two minor heart attacks, he had to undergo an emergency quadruple coronary bypass in 1983, after which he was extremely weak. However, he still managed to continue acting. In 1988, Lancaster was well enough to attend a Congressional hearing in Washington D.C. with old colleagues such as James Stewart and Ginger Rogers to protest against media magnate Ted Turner's plan to colorize various black-and-white films from the 1930s and 1940s. Lancaster's acting career ended after he suffered a stroke on November 30, 1990, which left him partially paralyzed and largely unable to speak.


Death

Burt_Lancaster_grave_at_Westwood_Village_Memorial_Park_Cemetery_in_Brentwood,_California.JPG Lancaster died at his apartment in Century City, California, after suffering a third heart attack at 4:50 am on October 20, 1994, at the age of 80.[57] His body was cremated, and his ashes were scattered under a large oak tree in Westwood Memorial Park which is located in Westwood Village, California. A small, square ground plaque amidst several others, only inscribed with "BURT LANCASTER 1913–1994", marks the location. Upon his death, as he had previously requested, no memorial or funeral service was held for him.
