History

The Peace and Diversity Party has been campaigning vigorously against land confiscations in Myanmar for years, in 2012 the party's farm land strikes have been given public attention and is unique in comparison with strikes by other parties in the country.[4][5][6] The party is well known for their farm land strike's in Myanmar, where they protest farm land confiscation by the Zaykabar company , a company illegally confiscating farm land in order to turn them into industrial zones.[7][8]

The Peace and Diversity Party also stand with farmers whose lands are under control by the ministry of defence although unused by Myanmar military.[9] The party actively participated in exchanging idea's and opinion's about establishing a federal army and federal union. They were calling for political dialogue to be held in Thailand back in 2013.[10]

In recent years, the Peace and Diversity Party has shifted their focus toward anti-Islamization but not anti-Islam as they view islamization as a great threat towards Myanmar and the world. This anti-islamization movement of the Peace and Diversity Party is based on party's ideology to avoid practicing politics based on a particular class or nationalism based on any race or religion.[11]

14 candidates of Peace and Diversity Party compete in 2015 General Election.[12]
