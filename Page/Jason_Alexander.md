JAY SCOTT GREENSPAN[1][2][3] (born September 23, 1959),[4] known by his stage name JASON ALEXANDER, is an American actor, voice actor, singer, comedian, and director. Alexander is best known for his role as George Costanza in the television series _Seinfeld_, for which he was nominated for six consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards and three Golden Globe Awards. Other well-known roles include Phillip Stuckey in the film _Pretty Woman_ (1990) and the title character in the animated series _Duckman_ (1994–1997).

Alexander has had an active career on stage, appearing in several Broadway musicals including _Jerome Robbins' Broadway_ in 1989, for which he won the Tony Award as Best Leading Actor in a Musical. He appeared in the Los Angeles production of _The Producers_. He was the Artistic Director of "Reprise! Broadway's Best in Los Angeles", where he has directed several musicals.


Early life

Alexander was born in Newark, New Jersey, the son of Jewish parents Ruth Minnie (née Simon), a nurse and health care administrator, and Alexander B. Greenspan, an accounting manager whose first name Jay later borrowed to create his stage name.[5] He has a half-sister, Karen Van Horne, and a half-brother, Michael Greenspan.[6] Alexander grew up in Livingston, New Jersey, and is a 1977 graduate of Livingston High School.[7] He attended Boston University but left the summer before his senior year, after getting work in the city of New York. At Boston University, Alexander wanted to pursue classical acting, but a professor redirected him toward comedy after noticing his physique, remarking, "I know your heart and soul are Hamlet, but you will never play Hamlet."[8] He was awarded an honorary degree in 1995. He is a practicing magician, and switched to acting as a career only after deciding that he was unlikely to succeed professionally in a magic career.[9]


Acting career

Stage career

Alexander began his acting career on the New York stage and is an accomplished singer and dancer. On Broadway he appeared in Stephen Sondheim's _Merrily We Roll Along,_ Kander & Ebb's _The Rink_, Neil Simon's _Broadway Bound_, _Accomplice_, and _Jerome Robbins' Broadway_, for which he garnered the 1989 Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical. Returning to the stage in 2003, Alexander was cast in a successful run, opposite Martin Short, in the Los Angeles production of Mel Brooks' _The Producers_.[10] Alexander also appeared with Kelsey Grammer in the 2004 musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' _A Christmas Carol_, playing Jacob Marley to Grammer's Ebenezer Scrooge. He continues to appear in live stage shows, including Barbra Streisand's memorable birthday party for Stephen Sondheim at the Hollywood Bowl, in which he appeared with Angela Lansbury, performing selections from _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_. Alexander was recently named the Artistic Director of Reprise Theatre Company in Los Angeles, where he previously directed _Sunday in the Park with George_. He is scheduled to direct the upcoming revival of _Damn Yankees_ at Reprise. In 2015, he replaced Larry David as the lead in David's Broadway play _Fish in the Dark._ Alexander co-starred opposite Sherie Rene Scott in the September 2017 world premiere of John Patrick Shanley's _The Portuguese Kid_ at the Manhattan Theatre Club.[11]

Television

Alexander is best known as one of the key cast members of the award-winning television sitcom _Seinfeld_ (1989–1998), in which he played the bumbling-but-lovable George Costanza (Seinfeld's character's best friend since childhood). Alexander was nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards and four Golden Globe Awards for his performance as Costanza, but did not win any, mainly due to his co-star Michael Richards being nominated and winning for his role as Cosmo Kramer. He did, however, win a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series for his work.

Before _Seinfeld_, he starred in a commercial for John Deere and in a short-lived CBS sitcom called _Everything's Relative_ in 1987 that lasted ten episodes. Concurrently with his _Seinfeld_ role, Alexander provided the voice of the lead character in the cult animated series _Duckman_ (1994–1997). Alexander voiced Catbert, the evil director of human resources, in the short-lived _Dilbert_ animated series based on the popular comic strip.

Alexander made cameo appearances in the second season of _Curb Your Enthusiasm_, playing himself, and appeared in the seventh season of _Curb Your Enthusiasm_ along with the other three principal _Seinfeld_ cast members.[12] He had a part in the ABC sitcom _Dinosaurs_, as Al "Sexual" Harris (who frequently engaged in sexual harassment) as well as other voices. Despite a successful career in film and stage, Alexander never managed to repeat his _Seinfeld_-level of success in television. 2001 marked his first post-_Seinfeld_ return to prime-time television: the heavily promoted but short-lived ABC sitcom _Bob Patterson_ (which was canceled after five episodes). Alexander partially blames the lack of success on the mood of the country after 9/11.[13]

His second chance as a TV series lead, the CBS sitcom _Listen Up!_ (September 20, 2004 to April 25, 2005), also fell short of a second season. Alexander was the principal executive producer of the series, based very loosely on the life of the popular sports-media personality Tony Kornheiser. Alexander appeared on the _Family Guy: Live in Vegas_ CD and sang a verse in a song. He was featured in the _Friends_ episode "The One Where Rosita Dies" as a suicidal supply manager named Earl. Phoebe calls him trying to sell him toner and she learns about his problem and tries to persuade him not to commit suicide. This is referred to in an episode of _Malcolm in the Middle_ where Alexander appears as a neurotic and critical loner called Leonard. He describes himself as free and mentions that he makes money with a job "selling toner over the phone". Later in the episode, he is repeatedly harassed by a man named George – his character's name on _Seinfeld_. Alexander appeared in the 1995 TV version of the Broadway musical _Bye Bye Birdie_, as Conrad Birdie's agent, Albert Peterson. He guest-starred in episode 8 of the 1996 variety show _Muppets Tonight_.

Alexander appeared on _Star Trek: Voyager_ on the episode "Think Tank" playing a genius alien named Kurros who was trying to get Seven of Nine to serve on his ship. He appeared in "One Night at Mercy", the first episode of the short-lived 2002 revival of _The Twilight Zone_, playing Death. He featured in the 2005 _Monk_ episode "Mr. Monk and the Other Detective" as Monk's rival, Marty Eels. On the June 26, 2006 episode of the _Jimmy Kimmel Live!_ talk show, Alexander demonstrated several self-defense techniques. He was the Host of the 230th July 4, 2006 of the PBS July 4 "A Capitol Fourth" Celebrations in Washington, D.C. in which he sang, danced, and played tuned drums. In 2006, Alexander signed on to feature as a regular cast member in the second season of _Everybody Hates Chris_. Alexander was the host of the Comedy Central Roast of actor William Shatner on August 13, 2006 (first airdate: August 20, 2006). In 2007, Alexander was a guest star in the third episode of the improv comedy series _Thank God You're Here_. He is a frequent guest and panelist on: Bill Maher's _Politically Incorrect_ and _Real Time_ shows; _Hollywood Squares_; the _Late Late Show_, with both Craig Kilborn and Craig Ferguson; and the _Late Show with David Letterman_.

In 2008, Alexander guest-starred on the CBS show _Criminal Minds_ in the season four episode "Masterpiece" as Prof. Rothschild,[14][15] a well-educated serial killer obsessed with the Fibonacci sequence who sends the team into a race against time to save his last victims. He returned in the same season to direct the episode "Conflicted", featuring the actor Jackson Rathbone. In 2011, Alexander was the guest star in an episode of _Harry's Law_, playing a high school teacher bringing a wrongful dismissal suit.[16] In 2018 , Alexander played Olix the bartender in The Orville Season 2 Episode 1[17]

In addition to his roles as an insensitive, money-hungry lawyer in _Pretty Woman_, co-starring with Richard Gere, and as inept womanizer Mauricio in _Shallow Hal_, with Jack Black, Alexander has appeared in _Love! Valour! Compassion!_, _Dunston Checks In_, _Love and Action in Chicago_, _The Last Supper_ and the psychological horror film _Jacob's Ladder_. He voiced the gargoyle Hugo in Disney's 1996 animated film _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_ and its direct-to-video sequel, _The Hunchback of Notre Dame II_. His other Disney voice work includes _House of Mouse_ and the video game _Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance_.[18] He has dabbled in directing, starting with 1996's _For Better or Worse_ and 1999's _Just Looking_. He also played the toymaker A.C. Gilbert in the 2002 movie _The Man Who Saved Christmas_.

In the summer of 2005, he appeared with Lee Iacocca in ads for DaimlerChrysler.

One of Alexander's earliest television roles was in a McDonald's commercial advertising the McDLT, in which he sings. He has appeared in Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) commercials, including one with baseball superstar Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants and another one opposite Trista Rehn of _The Bachelorette_. It was rumored that he no longer appears in these commercials due to the alleged cruelty to animals by KFC suppliers and slaughterhouses, but he refuted that in the August 2, 2006 issue of _Adweek_. Alexander said, "That's PETA bullcrap. I loved working for KFC. I was targeted by PETA to broker something between them. I think KFC really stepped up to the plate; unfortunately PETA did not."

He performed a mentalism and magic act at The Magic Castle in Hollywood, California from April 24 to 30, 2006, and was later named The Academy of Magical Arts Parlor Magician of the Year for this act.
