_QUOYA_ is a genus of flowering plants in family Lamiaceae and is endemic to Western Australia. Plants in this genus are shrubs with five petals joined to form a tube-shaped flower with four stamens of unequal lengths.


Description

Plants in the genus _Quoya_ are evergreen shrubs densely covered with woolly hairs. The leaves are simple, egg-shaped to almost circular, arranged in opposite pairs and covered with branched hairs. The flowers are arranged in groups of 3 to 7, often forming short spikes and exhibit left-right symmetry. There are five sepals which are joined at their base, forming a short tube and five petals forming a straight or slightly curved tube with five lobes on the end, the upper lobes shorter than the lower ones. There are four stamens with the lower pair having reduced fertility. The fruit is a drupe with the sepals remaining attached.[1]
