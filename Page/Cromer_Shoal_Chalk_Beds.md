The CROMER SHOAL CHALK BEDS are a chalk reef off the coast of Cromer, Norfolk in the United Kingdom, believed to be the largest chalk reef in Europe.[1] Since January 2016, it has been designated as a Marine Conservation Zone.[2]

The chalk beds have an area of about 320 km², starting 200m away from the coastline and extending about 10 km out into the North Sea, and stretching from west of Weybourne to Happisburgh.[3][4] They are home to more than 350 marine species, including a species of purple Hymedesmia sponge first discovered there in 2011.[5]
