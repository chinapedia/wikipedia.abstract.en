THE QUANTUM ACADEMY, INC. is a private college preparatory school in the Philippines whose primary goal is to meet the educational needs of its students from pre-school to senior high school that will prepare them for admission in colleges and universities.[1]


History

In 1998, three academicians, Rosa D. Ling, Lynette T. Demegillo and Angela Corazon Z. Licas, envisioned an innovative school system in General Santos City, Philippines. This vision was marked by their desire to provide education not only for the youth of this city but also for the children from other cities or countries who came to General Santos City because of their families' business or work assignment. While the school was still in the stage of planning, teaching opportunities abroad came.[2] Demegillo opted to leave for a teaching career in New Zealand with her family while Ling and Licas stayed to continue what had been started. The two academicians took charge of the procedures and requirements needed for the school's application and operation. Ling was in charge of the operation while Licas developed the policy framework, the curriculum and educational programs to be implemented by the school. As the Department of Education required an incorporation to establish a private school, it was through Ma. Rosario V. Lo and Normalita G. Gonzales, both co-founders, that stockholders were tapped to establish The Quantum Academy, Inc. (formerly Quantum Learning Center, Inc.) in 1998. At present, TQA has 13 incorporators composed of two teachers, three doctors, an architect, and business people who are all committed to the school.[3]

Through the assessment of the school's performance and standard of education, the Government Recognition for the three basic education levels were earned in a short span of time: the Pre-School Government Recognition was granted in 2002; the Grade School in 2005; and the High School in 2008.
