The AUTOPISTA TOLUCA–NAUCALPAN is a toll road under construction in Greater Mexico City which will connect Toluca in the west with Naucalpan in the east, meeting the Autopista Chamapa–Lechería.[1]

April 24, 2007, Constructora Teya (part of Grupo Higa) won the concession for 30 years, and so far the tollway has been under construction for almost ten years.[2]


Ethnic conflict

The construcction of the highway has been stopped due to a legal battle the ñathö-Otomi community "San Francisco Xochicuautla" has undertaken against the "Constructora Teya". The highway crosses the "Bosque Otomi-Mexica" natural reserve, which is also sacred territory of the vernacular religion of the community.[3]
