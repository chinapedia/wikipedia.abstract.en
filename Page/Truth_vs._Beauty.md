Thompson's Return to Music and Teasers Leading Up to _Truth vs. Beauty_

After the 2010 release of his 4th studio album, _Swansongs_, Thompson announced he was moving on from music. Aside from a 2011 song collaboration with Buddy Miller ("Dang Me") and the Chocolate Genius Twitter feed, Thompson remained mostly inactive. However, on December 16, 2015, a video was released on No Format's YouTube channel, entitled "Chocolate Genius Inc. - Epilogue 1: Truth vs. Beauty." The video simply consisted of quotes. Then, on July 4, an official teaser for _Truth vs. Beauty_ was uploaded. Then, in September, a music video was uploaded for the song "Fortitude." The final moment before the release was 1 day before the album debuted. An official music video for the song "Detroit" was uploaded.
