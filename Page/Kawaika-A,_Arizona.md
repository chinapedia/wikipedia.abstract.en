KAWAIKA-A is a populated place situated in Navajo County, Arizona.[1] It has an estimated elevation of above sea level.[2]

From 1935 to 1939, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology of Harvard University conducted an archeological expedition of which this location was one of the primary sites, along with Awatovi. The expedition uncovered murals and wall paintings from the aboriginal American Southwest.[3] Prior to settlement by European pioneers, the location was inhabited as early as early as 1500, but was deserted for unknown reasons by 1583. The name is derived from the Hopi name for the local inhabitants, the Kawaika.[4]
