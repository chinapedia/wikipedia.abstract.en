Career

Military

In December 1999, Hegar was commissioned into the U.S. Air Force through ROTC at the University of Texas. From April 2000 to March 2004, Hegar served on active duty as an Aircraft Maintenance Officer. She was initially stationed at Misawa Air Force Base in Misawa, Aomori, in the northern part of the island of Honshū of Japan. She was also stationed at Whiteman Air Force Base near Knob Noster, Missouri, about an hour east-southeast of Kansas City, Missouri. At Whiteman, Hegar worked on the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the B-2 Stealth Bomber. Her maintenance career culminated in responsibility for 75% of all B-2 maintenance as a Captain and selection as the Company Grade Officer of the Year for 2003.

In 2004, Hegar was selected for pilot training by the Air National Guard. Upon completion of her training at the top of her class, she served two deployments to Afghanistan, flying Combat Search and Rescue[17] on over 100 missions[18] as well as Medevac missions as a helicopter pilot.[19][20][21] As a member of the California Air National Guard, Hegar worked as a pilot and trainer at the San Jose, California-based Counterdrug Task Force from 2007 to 2011.

In addition to the deployments to Afghanistan during the Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan, Hegar flew marijuana eradication missions, wildfire suppression with buckets of water on cargo slings, performed pilot duties in evacuating survivors from hurricane-devastated cities, and rescued many civilians on civil search and rescue missions in California and at sea.[22]

On July 29, 2009, on her third tour to Afghanistan, Hegar, who went by the call sign Pedro 15,[23] was shot down on a Medevac mission near Kandahar and sustained wounds during a conflict with the Taliban.[24] She was operating as a combat search and rescue helicopter co-pilot on loan to the U.S. Army for the Medevac mission. Taliban ground forces shot at the helicopter, which disabled her helicopter, and wounded Hegar with shrapnel in her arm and leg. Although injured, Hegar and her pilot were able to rescue the soldiers but under further heavy fire, the helicopter was forced to conduct an emergency landing. U.S. Army helicopter were able to rescue Hegar, her team, and the other soldiers, but because the rescue helicopter was full, Hegar and others had to fly out on holding on to the wheel of the Blackhawk. On the way up out of the area, Hegar saw insurgents and returned fire towards the area where she saw muzzle flashes demonstrating her excellent marksmanship.[25][26]

Hegar was awarded the Purple Heart in December 2009.[27] Her actions on this mission earned her the Distinguished Flying Cross with Valor Device in 2011.[28] Hegar was one of the few women to receive this medal after Amelia Earhart.[29][30] In 2016, Hegar described a 2007 mission to medevac a child in great detail in a TEDx Talks presentation.[31]

Due to the restriction of the Combat Exclusion Policy on women applying for ground combat positions, and because she was medically disqualified from flying due to a serious back injury sustained during the 2009 mission,[32] Hegar transitioned out of the Air National Guard and became a Reservist Liaison.[33]

Other work

Hegar relocated to Austin in 2010 and worked as a program manager at Seton Healthcare Family, a position she held until 2015. From 2015 to 2017, Hegar worked at Dell Computers as a consultant.[34]

Hegar has taught at the University of Texas at Austin's McCombs School of Business as well as at UT in the ROTC and Women's Studies departments. She has mentored cadets at the university[35] and has served on the AFROTC Advisory Committee.

Hegar has worked as an executive coach and consultant. Hegar writes and speaks publicly about her experiences in the military and her fight to put women in combat, which she calls “equality”, and claims will increase military readiness.

Writing

In March 2017, Hegar's memoir, _Shoot Like a Girl,_ was published by the Berkley Books imprint of Penguin Books, in a new military division called Caliber.[36] In 2016, it was announced that the movie rights to the book were optioned by TriStar Pictures, with Angelina Jolie reportedly in negotiations for the lead role.[37][38]

Politics

On July 6, 2017, Hegar announced that she would be running to be the Democratic nominee for the United States Representative in Texas's 31st congressional district.[39] Hegar won the Democratic nomination.[40] She was narrowly defeated by 3% by incumbent John Carter in the November 2018 elections. Hegar said that she thinks the political leaders for this district need to be more reflective of the population served, and notes that the district has more military personnel living there than in 97% of the districts in the rest of the country.[41]

In June 2018, Hegar released a short form political ad called "Doors" that described her career in the military, which included her being shot down in Afghanistan.[42] The video went viral and drew the attention of celebrities like Lin-Manuel Miranda.[43][44][45]


Combat Exclusion Policy

Shortly after the mission where Hegar was wounded in Afghanistan, due to the military's Combat Exclusion Policy, while Hegar had not been previously barred from air combat as a pilot, she was medically disqualified from flying. Hegar was automatically excluded from applying for combat positions that would have moved her military career forward.[46] Hegar was barred from cross-training for a ground combat position (like a special tactics officer) despite her expertise as a pilot, which had it not been for her gender would have been a next step.[47][48]

In 2012, Hegar was the lead plaintiff alongside former U.S. Marine Corps Captain Zoe Bedell, U.S. Marine Corps First Lieutenant Colleen Farrell, U.S. Army Reserves Staff Sergeant Jennifer Hunt, and the Service Women's Action Network (SWAN) in a legal suit filed against the then U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta asserting that the Combat Exclusion Policy was unconstitutional.[49][50][51] Hegar said that the suit was about military effectiveness and would provide a larger pool of applicants to the military commanders.[52] The assertion was not upheld, but the policy, implemented in 1994, was repealed in January 2013 for political reasons.[53][54][55]


Personal life

In 2011, Hegar married Brandon Hegar, who she knew from high school. She and her family live in Round Rock, Texas, a town outside of Austin, Texas.[56] Hegar has two sons as well as stepchildren from her husband's prior marriage.[57][58]

Hegar has many tattoos, which were prominently featured in her 2018 viral campaign ad video, "Doors."[59] Hegar told Megyn Kelly during an interview on the _Today Show_ that the cherry blossom tattoo on her shoulder was a way to cover up the shrapnel scar tissue that she had there, an idea to take control and make those wounds beautiful.[60][61] The video also featured the domestic violence by her father that Hegar and her mother and sister experienced when she was young.[62][63]
