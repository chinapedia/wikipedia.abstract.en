PROJECT SEMICOLON - stylized as PROJECT ; - is an American nonprofit organization known for its advocacy of mental health wellness and its focus as an anti-suicide initiative. Founded in 2013, the movement's aim is "presenting hope and love to those who are struggling with depression, suicide, addiction, and self-injury".[1] They are known for encouraging people to tattoo the punctuation mark semicolon (;) as a form of solidarity between people dealing with mental illness or the death of someone from suicide.[2]


History

Project Semicolon was founded by Amy Bleuel in 2013, as a tribute to her father, who died by suicide in 2003.[3] She was a Christian.[4][5]

Amy Bleuel

Bleuel lived in Wisconsin. After her parents divorced, Bleuel chose to live with her father and his second wife at the age of 6. Since then, Bleuel endured being physically abused by her stepmother. At the age of 8, she was taken into state custody by a child protective service. Bleuel began self-harming and attempting to kill herself after she had been sexually abused at the age of 10,[6] and raped at 13. At the age of 18, Bleuel's father died from suicide, and she was subsequently released from the system.[7] In her early years in college, Bleuel was raped twice and suffered a miscarriage.[8] Bleuel suffered from alcoholism at the age of 30 and had five major suicidal attempts.[9]

Bleuel died on March 23, 2017, aged 31; the cause of death was ruled as suicide. She was romantically involved with her partner David.[10]


Overview

Project Semicolon defines itself as "dedicated to presenting hope and love for those who are struggling with mental illness, suicide, addiction and self-injury", and "exists to encourage, love and inspire".[11] While they are devoted to achieving lower suicide rates in the U.S. and worldwide, they do not themselves practice psychiatry, and the staff are not trained mental health professionals.[12] Rather, they recommend contacting emergency hotlines (e.g. 9-1-1 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) or seeking mental health professionals.[13] The movement is inclusive for people holding different beliefs or religions.[14][15][16]


Advocacy

ProjectSemicolonTrinitarianTattoo.jpg context, God the Holy Spirit]] Project Semicolon explains that "a semicolon is used when an author could've chosen to end their sentence, but chose not to. The author is you and the sentence is your life".[17]

The movement became prominent in early July 2015. People have started uploading photos of their own semicolon tattoos through social media to support the movement, gaining attention from a variety of mainstream news outlets.[18][19][20]

Amy Bleuel remarked on the initial outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, crisis hotlines having reported a major uptick, that "There's valid fear, and fear drives suicide. Also, sadness drives suicide. So these people are feeling this, and it's at an overwhelming extent that they're choosing to go that route."[21]

A book titled _Project Semicolon: Your Story Isn't Over_ was released on September 5, 2017. Published by HarperCollins, it is a compilation of stories and photos shared within Project Semicolon's online community.[22]


Support

Project Semicolon was echoed when actress Selena Gomez tattooed a semicolon onto her wrist to commemorate the premiere of _13 Reasons Why_, a Netflix series in which she served as co-executive producer. Accordingly, the show's casts Alisha Boe and Tommy Dorfman have also tattooed the punctuation mark onto their wrists in commemoration of the suicide-themed drama series released in early April 2017.[23]
