The EK SOCH SANDBOX in Varanasi was inspired by the Deshpande Foundationâ€™s Social Innovation Sandbox model - the Hubli Sandbox.[1][2] It was co-founded by Dilip Modi,[3] the pioneering telecom entrepreneur in India and Naveen Jha, CEO of Deshpande Foundation, India.

It engages with not-for-profits, academics, non-governmental organizations and entrepreneurs to launch effective and scalable models of development. It cultivates an ecosystem that nurtures innovation and entrepreneurship in eastern Uttar Pradesh[4] covering seven districts of Azamgarh, Jaunpur, Sant Ravidas Nagar, Mirzapur, Chandauli, Ghazipur, and Varanasi.[5]


Programs

Ek Soch runs many programs in the areas of education, agriculture, maternal health, student leadership, and micro-entrepreneurship. Some major programs are LEADers Accelerating Development (LEAD) and Navodyami.[6]

LEAD is an incubation program that provides financial support and mentorship to college students to help them generate and implement their innovative ideas.

Navodyami program helps micro-entrepreneurs create a sustainable livelihood and scale up in their businesses.

Ek Soch Sandbox has partnered with many organizations like Agastya Foundation, Save A Mother, Friends Union for Energizing Lives (FUEL), MILAAN and Swatantra Talim in areas of education, healthcare, and career planning to improve the lives of people in rural communities in Uttar Pradesh and bring about social change.[7]
