GUINEESINE (or GUINEENSINE) is an alkaloid isolated from long pepper (_Piper longum_)[1] and black pepper (_Piper nigrum_).[2]


Research into potential biological activities

Guineensine inhibits the cellular reuptake of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol in a mouse model (EC₅₀ = 290 nM).[3] [4] This causes an increase in the activity of the two neurotransmitters which are classified as endogenous cannabinoids.

Guineesine can dose-dependently produce cannabimimetic effects in a mouse model[5] which are indicated by potent catatonic, analgesic, hypo-locomotive and hypo-thermic effects. In addition, the analgesic and catatonic effects were reversed by the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) inverse agonist rimonabant.[6]

Guineesine is also a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) _in vitro_ (IC₅₀ = 139.2 μM).[7]
