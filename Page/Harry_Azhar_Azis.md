HARRY AZHAR AZIS is the member of the Audit Board of Indonesia and a former legislator in the People's Representative Council.[1] During his tenure as a Representative, Azis was the chairman of the House Budget Committee,[2] and in 2010 was also one of the first Indonesian legislators to suggest a bridge between Batam and Singapore as part of the Indonesia–Malaysia–Singapore Growth Triangle.[3]

In April 2016, Azis was implicated in the Panama Papers due to a previously registered blank company which he hadn't reported.[4] Azis claimed that the company was merely a registered name on paper which he had started for his oldest daughter, but then sold to someone else after his appointment as Board chairman in December 2014.[5] In October that same year, the Ethics Council of the Audit Board sanctioned Azis via a written warning upon ruling that he violated the ethics code by failing to report the company.[6]
