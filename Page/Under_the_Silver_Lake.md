_UNDER THE SILVER LAKE_ is a 2018 American comedic neo-noir mystery film written, produced and directed by David Robert Mitchell. Set in Los Angeles, it follows a young man (Andrew Garfield) who sets out on a quest to investigate the sudden disappearance of his neighbour (Riley Keough), only to stumble upon an elusive and dangerous large-scale conspiracy.

The film had its world premiere on May 15, 2018, at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or, before being released nationwide in France on August 8. It was released in the United States on April 19, 2019, by A24. _Under the Silver Lake_ polarized critics; although its originality, direction, soundtrack, cinematography, and Garfield's performance were praised, some found the script confusing, too cryptic, and lacking the substance and depth the film was aiming for.


Plot

Sam is an aimless young man with an interest in conspiracy theories and finding hidden messages in everyday popular culture, who lives a lazy, jobless life in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles. Throughout his interactions, Sam and the public are warned to beware of the Dog Killer, who's apparently been kidnapping and murdering pet dogs. One day he befriends his beautiful neighbor Sarah, who invites him to come over the next day, apparently to have sex. However, when he drops by he discovers that she and her roommates moved out during the night. Sam becomes obsessed with finding what happened to Sarah. He trails a woman who he sees removing items from Sarah's apartment. She and her two friends end up leading Sam to a series of elite Hollywood parties where he encounters other people, including the pop band "Jesus and the Brides of Dracula" and a performance artist who works for a prostitution ring which employs struggling or washed up actresses. All of these people seem to have connections to one another, although Sam struggles to put them into any meaningful pattern. A news report details the discovery of the body of billionaire Jefferson Sevence, who burned to death in a car along with three women. Sam recognizes a hat found at the crime scene as belonging to Sarah.

As he continues his investigation, Sam is haunted by signs of the Dog Killer and disturbing instances possibly related to a conspiracy. Sam contacts the author of _Under the Silver Lake_, an underground comic book specializing in urban legends. The author is far more conspiratorial-minded than Sam and is obsessed with a monster known as the Owl Woman, as well as a secret message he believes to be hidden in an old cereal box. Later, the police find the author dead in what they believe to be an apparent suicide. Sam reviews footage and discovers that the he was actually seemingly killed by the Owl Woman.

By following a series of clues hidden in "Jesus and the Brides of Dracula" songs, Sam meets the "Homeless King," a man who brings him to an underground bunker beneath Griffith Park leading into a supermarket. With the help of the performance artist and her friends, Sam encounters "the Songwriter" a fabulously wealthy man living in a gated community who claims to have written most of the popular songs of history. After mocking Sam, the Songwriter tries to shoot him, leading Sam to bludgeon him to death with a guitar which purportedly belonged to Sam's musical idol, Kurt Cobain. Later, Sam meets Millicent Sevence, Jefferson's daughter. She gives him a bracelet which had belonged to her father, which happens to be the same exact type of bracelet Sarah was wearing when they met. Just as Millicent slips Sam the bracelet she is shot dead by unseen assailants.

By combining the bracelet, the prize inside his friend's old cereal box, and a _The Legend of Zelda_ map featured in the first-ever issue of _Nintendo Power_, Sam is able to find a location that doesn't show on web mapping where he finds a man and three women in a hut. The man reveals the answer to Sam's investigation: through history a selected few wealthy men like himself choose to lock themselves into underground bunkers similar to the one Sam previously discovered in order for their souls to "ascend" similar to Egyptian Pharaohs, while taking three wives to go with them. He confirms that Sarah and her roommates were Jefferson Sevence's wives, and that their deaths were faked in order for the four of them to ascend. Once they went inside their bunker, it was sealed and cannot be left. However the process takes months and they can actually be contacted via videotelephony. Sam speaks with Sarah, who confirms that she entered the bunker on her own will and that she's at peace with her fate. Since Sarah leaving the bunker is not an option, the two share an emotional farewell and hang up for good.

Sam unexpectedly passes out along with the man and his three wives, just as the Homeless King arrives. The Homeless King captures Sam, and when he finds dog biscuits in his pocket it is heavily implied that Sam is the Dog Killer who's wreaked havoc across Los Angeles. Sam alludes to a painful breakup with his girlfriend and their dog, and the despair he felt knowing they'd never get back together and would never see his dog again. The Homeless King eventually lets him go, stating that the members of the conspiracy probably won't kill Sam, although he is not certain. When he comes back to his apartment complex, Sam spends the night with a neighbor whose parrot keeps on saying incomprehensible words, although she too does not know what words he is saying. From her balcony, Sam sees his landlord and a police lady entering his apartment to evict him because he didn't pay his rent. The two realize that the wall has been painted with a strange symbol, which Sam knows to be a message left by the conspiracy members to remind him to keep quiet.


Themes

Though David Robert Mitchell has not outwardly spoken on the symbolism and social commentary within, many critics have brought up how the film often plays with several different concepts revolving Hollywood and consumerism, sexism and the male gaze, conspiracy theories and subliminal messages in popular culture, technological paranoia, and religion.

There are several allusions to the classic Hollywood, specifically the films of Alfred Hitchcock, even to the point of the composer Disasterpeace scoring the film based on a heavy influence from noir films and scores by Bernard Hermann. There are also certain references to Marilyn Monroe's unfinished film, _Something's Got to Give_. The movie also references the consumption of music and popular media, consumption of actors and actresses, and even alludes to the town of Los Angeles as a tomb of consumption.

The majority of female characters are portrayed in the mind of the main character as idols, despite not really being shown to have much character outside their physical appearances. The film, based around the sequence of events, implies that innocent women travel to Hollywood with promises of being immortalized on the silver screen, only to be sacrificed into the servitude of the _Hollywood producer_ and sold as sex slaves, call girls, and objects to ogle at.

Reception

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 55% based on 118 reviews, with an average rating of 5.83/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "_Under the Silver Lake_ hits its stride slightly more often than it stumbles, but it's hard not to admire - or be drawn in by - writer-director David Robert Mitchell's ambition."[16] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[17]

Joshua Rothkopf of _Time Out_ gave the film a perfect five rating, calling it "Hypnotic, spiraling and deliriously high" and stating "the ambition of _Under the Silver_ Lake is worth cherishing. It will either evaporate into nothingness or cohere into something you'll want to hug for being so wonderfully weird."[18] Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave a positive review, calling it "a bizarre and outrageous drama grounded in the consistency of Garfield's astonishment at every turn... It's fascinating to watch Mitchell grasp for a bigger picture with the wild ambition of his scruffy protagonist."[19]

Owen Gleiberman of _Variety_ gave a positive review, calling it "a down-the-rabbit-hole movie, at once gripping and baffling, fueled by erotic passion and dread but also by the code-fixated opacity of conspiracy theory. The movie is impeccably shot and staged, with an insanely lush soundtrack that's like Bernard Herrmann-meets-Angelo-Badalamenti-on-opioids.[20] A.A. Dowd of _The A.V. Club_ gave the film a B rating, stating "Mitchell is taking a big swing with his third feature, trying something not just new but also more unconventional, ambitious, and even potentially off-putting."[21]

Emily Yoshida of _Vulture_ stated about the film's message: "I kept coming back to the women in this extremely boy-driven movie — Mitchell suspects that they're all on one big conveyor belt to be chewed up and spit out by Hollywood, or if they're lucky, locked away in the dungeons of the rich and powerful. It's a rather pedestrian imagining for an otherwise admirably cuckoo film — you keep hoping for Mitchell to land on something weirder, more radical."[22] Despite praising Garfield's performance and the film's originality, Bilge Ebiri of _The Village Voice_ gave a negative review, stating: "If you're going to make a postmodern neo-noir sex-conspiracy... set in Los Angeles, it helps to have some personality, or at least a sense of style... Mitchell has interesting ideas, and his actors seem to be having fun, but that's not enough when the film itself lacks atmosphere, or tension, or emotional engagement."[23]
