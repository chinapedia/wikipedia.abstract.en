Institutional Support & Exhibitions

Velonis work has been supported by the MAK Center (Los Angeles, 2012), the Swedish Arts Council (Malmö, 2012), Casa Maauad (Mexico City, 2016), and the Akademie Schloss Solitude (Stuttgart, 2016). He has participated in multiple exhibitions, artfairs and residencies internationally.

Kostis Velonis was the NEON City Project 2017 commissioned artist. CITY PROJECT is an initiative for public art and the city, conceived and commissioned annually by NEON to a Greek artist. For this commission Velonis created _A Puppet Sun,_ the largest individual presentation of his work until then.[4] The exhibition mined the rich context of a historical neoclassical residence in the center of Athens, its political, social and cultural history that dates back to the end of 19th century, for narratives and symbols which Velonis both incorporates and invokes in his sculptural works. The exhibition was curated by Vassilis Oikonomopoulos, Assistant Curator, Collections International Art, Tate Modern, London. [5]


Work

According to a recent catalogue, "His work interrogates the ideological orientations of avant-garde movements during the 20th century, which saw art as a practice for social purposes."[6] Velonis’ work reminds us of domestic spaces which were easily dismissed during the heyday of modernism, when it was considered a failed and outdated value system. Apart from historical connotations, the playful narrations and “awkward” craftsmanship of Velonis’ sculptures demythicize the “revolutionary” rhetoric and ideological taboos of contemporary “political art”. Velonis evokes contradictory ideas through the use of simple materials. His work explores the broader contexts around class identity and the beauty of the trivial. He engages concepts that encompass rather than isolate aesthetics and politics.

Velonis' work has been documented in a number of publications, including: ArtPulse Magazine,[7] ArtForum,[8][9][10] and ArtReview.[11] According to art historian Daphne Vitale, Velonis "is considered one of the most important Greek artists of his generation."[12]
