Maltoscannabis.png CANNABIS IN SWEDEN is illegal for recreational and medical purposes; only very limited medical usage of cannabis-based drugs is allowed for specific conditions.


Medical cannabis

In Sweden, cannabis has no officially recognized medical usage and medical use is not seen as an extenuating circumstance. Rather the opposite, in a case that drew some attention in the national press involving a multiple sclerosis patient, the disease, and the fact that she stated that cannabis helped her, were seen as an aggravated circumstance by the court. The court argued in the verdict that she lacked motivation to stop using the drug and therefore gave her an unconditioned jail sentence, although she was a first-time offender, she would have otherwise regularly been given a suspended sentence or a fine.[1][2]

The Medical Products Agency reported in 2008 that no drugs containing cannabinoids are available, although they can have beneficial effects on symptoms like neuralgia.[3] Cannabinoid mouth spray Sativex that is derived from cannabis plants was approved in Sweden for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis on 22 December 2011.[4]


Reform

In 2013, Centre Party Youth (CUF) announced their advocacy for the legalization of cannabis. Among their justifications are the idea that the ban will lead to greater harm than the drug itself, that prohibition favors organized crime, and possession and controlled sale of alcohol is already legal.[5]
