'' THE HUNT IN ARANJUEZ'' (Spanish: _LA CACERIA DEL TABLILLO EN ARANJUEZ_) is an oil painting by Juan Bautista Martínez del Mazo, painted around 1640.


Description

The work shows the court of Philip IV, hunting a deer near the palace of Aranjuez.

It is preserved in the Museo del Prado who bought it from the German collector A. S. Drey, of Munich, in 1934. Conde de Cartagena legacy funds were used to purchase the work.


Analysis

It is a court scene. Tabladillo found in Queen Elizabeth of Bourbon, her ladies and three sisters. Down on the field, the king, and his brother, the Cardinal Infante Ferdinand of Austria and servants. One of hunting dogs has been identified with one of those accompanying the prince Baltasar Carlos in a painting by Velázquez, the teacher of Mazo, is unmistakable.[1]


Provenance

In 1666, it appears in the inventory of the Royal Alcazar of Madrid. Elizabeth Farnese took the work to the Pardo Palace where it was inventoried in 1714. It later returned to the Alcazar where it was before the fire of 1734. During the War of Spanish Independence, Joséph Bonaparte took it out of the Pardo and took it with him to France. After the ruin of the ousted king of Spain, it was sold to Lord Ashburton. This happened to German collections, such as Sedelmayer, or Hungarian, like Marcel Nemes.
