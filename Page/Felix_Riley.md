Early life and studies

Riley began his studies in Mental Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh,[2] graduating in 1993.


Early comedy writing career

Riley began his comedy career on the BBC Radio 4 satire show Weekending. His involvement ran from 1993 through to 1998, including one year as Script Associate and recipient of the BBC Radio Comedy Writers Bursary.

Some of the other radio credits during this time include The Zoë Ball Breakfast Show (BBC Radio 1) as a member of the show's posse, Cross Talk (BBC Radio 4) as _Producer/writer/creator,_ the Simon Mayo Show (BBC Radio 1), The Scott Mill's Breakfast Show (BBC Radio 1), Chris Moyles (Radio 1), Xmas Panto _(_BBC Radio 4 1999 _with R.

Riley partnered with the comedy writer Simon Littlefield during much of this time as well as performing stand-up in the mid-1990s, appearing at, amongst other venues, The Comedy Store.[3]


City and entrepreneurial career

In 2003 Riley took a break from writing from which he didn’t know if he would return. He gained a job at the leading American brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald where he joined the sales team of their financial spread betting arm, Cantor Index. In 2006 he launched his own financial binary betting firm, ChoiceOdds, which he sold fifteen months later to the American brokerage firm MF Global where he became Managing Director of his division.[4]


Credits

Novels

Having worked in Finance in the City at the height of the Credit Crunch Riley was struck not only by what he saw as the criminal nature of it but also the lack of understanding amongst the wider public. Inspired by this he set out to write a book that, whilst a high-octane thriller, would explain exactly what the Credit Crunch was – and why it was a scam perpetrated by the banks. That book was _The Set Up_,[5] published by Michael Joseph, a Penguin Books imprint. It was the first in his Mike Byrne series which also includes the follow up _The Inside Job_.[6]

Politics

In 2016 he stood unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate in the Elmbridge Borough council elections for the ward of Claygate.[7]
