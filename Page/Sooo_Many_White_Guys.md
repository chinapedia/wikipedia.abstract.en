Format

_Sooo Many White Guys_ is taped at WNYC studios in New York City.[8] Each podcast typically runs between 30 and 45 minutes.[9] Each episode features interviews with an individual from either the music, comedy, and LGBTQ, or acting industries.[10] Issues discussed on the podcast include race, and feminism.[11]

Host Phoebe Robinson says of the podcast, "I figured it might be cool to change it to a talk show and just get to talk to women, people of color, people from the LGBTQ+ community that I think are really fascinating and awesome and that just aren't highlighted as much. And then that way I could focus on them and just kind of turn the whole interview process on its head and, you know, have one token white guy â€” obviously, a person I still respect, but just flipping the ratio."[12]
