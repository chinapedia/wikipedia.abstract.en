ALEXEY FYODOROVICH IVANOV (, 14 February 1841, Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, — 15 January 1894, Saint Petersburg) was a Russian writer and poet, better known under his pen name IVANOV-CLASSIC (Иванов-Классик).[1]

Having debuted as a published author in 1861 (_Peterburgsky Vestnik_, "On the Death of Nikitin"), Ivanov was spotted by Vasily Kurochkin who invited him to become a major contributor to the _Iskra_ magazine. It was there (as well as in _Delo_, _Zanoza_, _Budilnik_, _Oskolki_ and _Vsemirnaya Illyustratsia_) that his numerous poems (he preferred to refer to them as 'songs') were published to make their author one of the best-known masters of humorous and satirical verse of his time in Russia.[2] Many of them were collected in the books _Pesni Klassika_ (The Classic's Songs, 1873), _Na rassvete_ (At Dawn, 1882), _Stikhotvoreniya_ (Poems, 1891). He also authored the short novel _Besputnye deti_ (Wayward Children, 1874), as well as _Vesyoly poputchik_ (Jolly Companion, 1889), a compilation of travel sketches and stories he wrote during his numerous journeys, to Austria, Italy, Germany, as well over Siberia, Ukraine and Caucasus.[3][4]
