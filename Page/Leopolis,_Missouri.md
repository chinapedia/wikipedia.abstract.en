LEOPOLIS is an extinct town in Livingston County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]

Leopolis was settled by a colony of Catholics, and most likely was named after a seminary of the same name near the original town site.[2] A post office called Leopolis was established in 1892, and remained in operation until 1901.[3]
