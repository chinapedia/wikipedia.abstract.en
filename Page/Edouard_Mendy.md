EDOUARD MENDY (born 1 March 1992) is a footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Stade de Reims.[1] Born in France, Mendy represents the Senegal national football team.


Professional career

Mendy helped Stade de Reims win the 2017–18 Ligue 2, as they were promoted to Ligue 1 for the 2018–19 season.[2]


International career

Mendy was born to a Senegalese mother and a Bissau-Guinean father. In November 2016, he was called-up by Guinea-Bissau to play friendly matches against Portuguese clubs Belenenses and Estoril.[3] At the time, his father was very ill and was about to pass away, leading Mendy to honour him playing for the Bissau-Guinean national team.[4] Shortly after, he was shortlisted by Guinea-Bissau to play the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations for them,[5] but he has ultimately rejected the call and pledged his future to Senegal.[6]

Mendy made debut for Senegal in a 1–0 win over Equatorial Guinea on 18 November 2018.[7]
