, also known as _Heijō-tennō_, was the 51st emperor of Japan,[1] according to the traditional order of succession.[2] Heizei's reign lasted from 806 to 809.[3]


Traditional narrative

Heizei was the eldest son of the Emperor Kanmu and empress Fujiwara no Otomuro.[4] Heizei had three Empresses and seven sons and daughters.[5]

Heizei is traditionally venerated at his tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates , in Nara, as the location of Heizei's mausoleum.[6] The site is publicly accessible.[7] Although one of the largest kofun monuments in Japan, archaeological investigations in 1962–1963 indicate that it was constructed in the early 5th century, and that portions of it were destroyed during the construction of Heijo-kyō, calling into question the designation by the Imperial Household Agency.

Events of Heizei's life

Before he ascended to the throne, his liaison with Fujiwara no Kusuko, the mother of his one consort, caused a scandal. Because of this scandal his father considered depriving him of the rank of crown prince.

-   785: (): Heizei was appointed Crown Prince at the age of 12.[8]
-   APRIL 9, 806 [9] (): In the 25th year of Emperor Kanmu's reign, he died; and despite an ensuring dispute over who should follow him as sovereign, contemporary scholars then construed that the succession (_senso_) was received by his son. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Heizei is said to have acceded to the throne (_sokui_).[10]

His title Heizei was derived from the official name of the capital in Nara, Heizei Kyō.

During Heizei's reign, the bodyguards were reorganized; the existing Imperial Bodyguards became the Left Imperial Bodyguards, while the Middle Bodyguards became the Right Imperial Bodyguards.[11] Both sides were given a new Senior Commander; at this time Heizei appointed Sakanoue no Tamuramaro (758–811) as Senior Commander of the Imperial Bodyguards of the Right.[12] Under Emperor Kanmu, Tamuramaro had been appointed as _shōgun_ of a military expedition against the Emishi.[13]

-   809 (): After a reign of four years, Heizei fell ill; and fearing that he would not survive, Heizei abdicated in favor of his younger brother, who would later come to be known as Emperor Saga.[14] After abdicating, Heizei moved to Nara and was henceforth known as _Nara no Mikado_, the "Emperor of Nara".[15]
-   MAY 18, 809 (): Emperor Saga was enthroned at age 24.[16]
-   810 (_Kōnin 1_): In Heizei's name, the former emperor's ambitious third wife, , and her brother Nakanari organized an attempted rebellion, but their forces were defeated. Kusuko died in poison and her brother was executed. Heizei took the tonsure and became a Buddhist monk.[17]
-   AUGUST 5, 824 (): Heizei died at age 51, 14 years after he had abdicated due to illness.[18]

Era of Heizei's reign

The years of Heizei's reign are encompassed within one era name (_nengō_).[19]

-   _Daidō_ (806–810)


Kugyō

is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.[20]

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career. During Heizei's reign, this apex of the _Daijō-kan_ included:

-   _Sadaijin_ (not appointed)
-   _Udaijin_, Miwa-no-Oh or Miwa-no-Ohkimi (神王), 798–806.[21]
-   _Udaijin_, Fujiwara no Uchimaro (藤原内麿), 806–812.[22]
-   _Naidaijin_
-   _Dainagon_, Fujiwara no Otomo (藤原雄友), 806–807

When the daughter of a _chūnagon_ became the favored consort of the Crown Prince Ate (later known as Heizei_-tennō_), her father's power and position in court was affected. Kanmu disapproved of , former wife of Fujiwara no Tadanushi; and Kanmu had her removed from his son's household. After Kanmu died, Heizei restored this one-time favorite as part of his household; and this distinction had consequences.[23]

-   _Chūnagon_, Fujiwara no Tadanushi[24]
