Production

This is the only film that Musiri Subramania Iyer had any stint in the celluloid world. According to writer and critic Kalki Krishnamurthy, during the shooting of the film, Tukaram wore a moustache whereas Subramania Iyer had a clean shaved face. When he was acting the part, an artificial moustache was fixed on his face. Subramania Iyer could not bear the itching caused by the gum that held the moustache under his nose. He told the producers to wait for sometime until he grew his own moustache. It was a scene of merriment to see him sporting a moustache because basically he was a Carnatic singer and in those days it was considered a taboo for them to wear a moustache. However, the very next moment shooting was over, Subramania Iyer got a clean shave done.[2]

R. Balasaraswathi who became a popular playback singer in later years, appeared as a child artiste, playing the role of Tukkaram's daughter. The film was produced also in Telugu with C. S. R. Anjaneyulu playing the title role.[3]
