Lambeth_Town_Hall,_May_2015_02.jpg Lambeth_Town_Hall.jpg LAMBETH TOWN HALL, also known as BRIXTON TOWN HALL, is the head office of the London Borough of Lambeth on Brixton Hill and Acre Lane, Brixton, London SW2.

It is a Grade II listed building, completed in 1908, and designed by Septimus Warwick and H. Austen Hall in Edwardian Baroque style.[1] It was built to replace a smaller town hall building on Kennington Road.[2] Warwick and Hall were the winners of a design competition that attracted 143 entries. Construction began in 1905, with the foundation stone laid on the 21 July 1906 by the mayor, and was formally opened on 29 April 1908 by the Prince and Princess of Wales, the future King George V and Queen Mary.[3] The original cost of the building, excluding furnishings, was put at £40,000 in 1908.[4]

The building occupies a triangular site, with its longest and principal facades at Brixton Hill and Acre Lane. The rounded front entrance is on the junction of these two roads, above it rises the 134 feet high clock tower which is the building's principal feature and is a local landmark[5]. The clock chimes out every 15 minutes. Sculpted stone figures surround the four clock faces, at the corners of the tower, representing Justice, Science, Art and Literature[6]. On the Brixton Road facade are the foundation stone and a stone war memorial with the names of Lambeth Borough Council staff who died in World War I.

The main external materials are Portland stone, Norwegian granite and red brick[7]. Both the exterior and interior feature many original decorative details such as sculptures, metalwork and stained glass. Interior spaces include the Council Chamber, meeting rooms, atrium and a community room.[8]

The building was extended westwards in 1935-8 to sympathetic designs by Whinney, Son and Austen Hall with E.R. Silver, which added an extra floor and the Assembly Hall.[9]

In 2016 it underwent a £71 million refurbishment, completed in 2018, as part of the council’s redevelopment of the area.[10] This scheme, due to be completed in 2020, includes the construction of new residential units and offices in new or refurbished buildings next to the town hall.[11]
