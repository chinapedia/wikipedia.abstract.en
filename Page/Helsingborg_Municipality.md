HELSINGBORG MUNICIPALITY (_Helsingborgs kommun_) is a municipality in Skåne County in Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Helsingborg, which is Sweden's eighth largest city. The municipality had a population of 132,011 on January 1, 2013, and the population is increasing with roughly 1500 people annually.

Between 1912 and 1971 the name of the town was officially spelled HÄLSINGBORG (rather like the region of Hälsingland but unlike neighbouring Danish Helsingør and the Finnish capital Helsingfors (Helsinki)). The spelling was changed back to the older version when the present municipality was created in 1971 through the amalgamation of the _Town of Hälsingborg_ with four surrounding rural municipalities. Since the 1990s the municipality again styles itself _Helsingborgs stad_ (_Town of Helsingborg_). This usage is only nominal and has no effect on the status of the municipality.
