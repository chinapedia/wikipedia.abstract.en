_SKELETOCUTIS CHRYSELLA_ is a species of poroid crust fungus in the family Polyporaceae. Found primarily in Northern Europe, it has a boreal distribution, and has also been collected in East Karelia, Yakutia, and North America. It is classified as a vulnerable species on the Norwegian Red list, where it is considered to be declining.[1]

The fungus was described as new to science in 1998 by mycologist Tuomo Niemelä. The type collection made in Finland, where it was found growing on a dead fruit body of _Phellinus chrysoloma_, a polypore fungus that is found only in old-growth forest. As its successor, _S. chrysella_ is highly susceptible to forest management and disturbances.[2] Molecular analysis suggests that it is closely related to _Skeletocutis kuehneri_.[3]
