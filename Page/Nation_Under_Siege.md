Reception

The film received some controversy over Majid Michel, a Ghanian actor, portraying a Nigerian terrorist,[2] and for its depiction of Islamic terrorism, which resulted in the movie getting banned in Ghana.[3] Film theaters in Nigeria also declined to screen the film for the same reasons and Amanfo had to change the film's name from _Boko Haram_ to _Nation Under Siege_ before releasing it in Nigeria.[4][5]
