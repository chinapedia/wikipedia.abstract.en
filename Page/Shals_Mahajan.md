Timmi in Tangles

_Timmi in Tangles_ is an experimental children's book that won the Kotak Junior Children writing award.[6] It depicts the quirky and imaginative life of Timmi and the trials she faces in her everyday life.[7]


No Outlaws in the Gender Galaxy

_Outlaws_ explorers the lives of people assigned the gender female at birth and retells the stories of several such individuals that faced opposition and the possibility of ostracism from society for their existence outside of the gender norm. Additionally, it questions gender - the need for it and its all encompassing influence on our lives.
