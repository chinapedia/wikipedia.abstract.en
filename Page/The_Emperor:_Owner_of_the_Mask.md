-   The first script reading took place on December 23, 2016 at MBC Broadcasting Station in Sangam, Seoul, South Korea. The series was pre-produced with filming commencing in December 2016, and lasted six months.[15][16][17][18] The series reunited Kim So-hyun and Yoo Seung-ho who starred in _Missing You_ (2013), and Kim Myung-soo and Yoon So-hee in _The Day After We Broke Up_ (2016).[19][20]
-   The series was promoted heavily by MBC, with the first teaser released six months before its premiere at the MBC Drama Awards, where leads Yoo and Kim also served as presenters.[21] There were also several exclusive Naver features and V Live broadcasts before and during its run.[22][23][24]

Reception

Despite being touted as the next _Love in the Moonlight_ (2016) which became a youth sageuk sensation,[28] _Emperor_ was not able to emulate _Moonlight_'s success and only averaged modest ratings of 12.4%.[29][30] Additionally, even though it topped ratings in its time slot, it was overtaken by its competitor in the important 20-49 year old demographic, as well as streaming, popularity, and brand reputation charts for consecutive weeks.[31][32] With the extensive promotion and hype the series received before premiere, its figures were underwhelming.[33][34][35] Performances of the cast were praised, though audiences also stated their dissatisfaction with the story and the production as a whole.[36][37] William Schwartz of _HanCinema_ stated that the series is "irredeemably stupid", adding that "...the obstacles the characters run into are never clearly defined. It's one of the reasons why the resolutions in this drama are so unsatisfying. There's no tension."[38]
