UPĀLI ORDINATION HALL (, ) is a Buddhist ordination hall located midway between Bagan and Nyaung U in Myanmar.[1] The ordination hall is known for its well-preserved Konbaung Dynasty interior frescoes.[2][3]

The ordination hall was built during the reign of King Anawrahta and was consecrated by four monks from Ceylon, led by Upāli Thera.[4] The exterior was altered during the reign of Bodawpaya.[5] The interior frescoes were begun on 4 March 1794 and completed a year later.[6] The highest tier depicts the 28 past Buddhas seated in the _bhūmisparśa_ mudra, while the middle tier depicts scenes from the Jataka tales, and the lowest tier depicts the rehabilitation of a Buddhist monk who has violated the Vinaya.
