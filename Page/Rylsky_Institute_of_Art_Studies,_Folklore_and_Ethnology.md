Рильського, _Instytut mystetsvoznavstva, folklorystyky ta etnolohiyi imeni M. T. Ryl’s’koho_) is a research institute in Kyiv, Ukraine, established in August 1936.


History

Stamp_of_Ukraine_s81.jpg The Institute takes its origin from a number of art and ethnographic centres that emerged during the 1920s. Thus, in 1921 the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences established the Ethnographic Commission (1921–1933), which played a leading role in preservation and development of ethnographic and folkloristic sciences in Ukraine. The Vovk Centre of Anthropology and Ethnology [also known as the Vovk Museum [or Cabinet] of Anthropology and Ethnology] (1921–1934), named after Fedir Vovk, oversaw the anthropological and ethnographic research studies of the entire territory of Ukraine. A separate research institution was entirely dedicated to studies of Ukrainian folk music: The Centre of Music Ethnography [also known as Cabinet] (1922–1935).

In 1936 the Ukrainian Folklore Institute was established under the umbrella of the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences. At that time it consisted of the Narrative Folklore Department, the Folk Music Department, and Archives. Its Lviv branch was established in 1939, with Filaret Kolessa as its first director.

In 1964, the Institute was named after Maksym Rylsky, who was its long-standing director (1942–1964).

The Institute was given its current name in 1994.[1]
