_EUCALYPTUS HOWITTIANA_, commonly known as HOWITT'S BOX, is a eucalypt that is native to Queensland.[1]

The tree can grow to in height and forms a lignotuber. It has rough grey coloured bark that is shortly fibrous and flaky, often fissured to tessellated on older trunks. The discolorous, glossy, green and thick-textured adult leaves are alternately arranged. The leaf blade has a lanceolate to ovate shape with a length of and a width of with the base tapering to the petiole and a pointed apex often with a drip-tip.[2] It blooms between January and May producing white-cream coloured flowers.

The species was first formally described by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1882 as part of the work _Definitions for some new Australian plants_ and published in the _Southern Science Record_.[3] The specific epithet honours the bushman, explorer, botanist, geologist and magistrate, Alfred William Howitt.[4]

It is endemic to hilly country in tropical sub-coastal north-eastern Queensland where it has a limitied distribution. The tree is found growing in skeletal sandy well-drained soils on rocky escarpments and slopes on a variety of substrates. It is a part of woodland communities usually with other eucalypts or sometimes on the boundary of semi-deciduous vine thickets.[5]
