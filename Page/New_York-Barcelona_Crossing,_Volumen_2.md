_NEW YORK-BARCELONA CROSSING, VOLUMEN 2_ is an album by jazz pianist Brad Mehldau, with Perico Sambeat (alto sax), Mario Rossy (bass) and Jorge Rossy (drums).


Music and recording

The album was recorded in concert at the Jamboree Club in Barcelona[1] on May 10, 1993.[2] The material is mostly jazz standards and pieces from the Great American Songbook.[3]


Reception

_The Penguin Guide to Jazz_ commented that this album was not as good as _New York-Barcelona Crossing, Volumen 1_, but that "It's Easy to Remember" is "another gorgeous ballad performance, at a dangerously slow tempo".[4] The AllMusic reviewer wrote that "What is engrossing about the disc is the utter fluidity with which these four young musicians from varying backgrounds are able to communicate using the common language of standard songs."[5]
