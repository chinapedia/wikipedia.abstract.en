BLACKBERRY DTEK60 is an Android smartphone co-developed and distributed by BlackBerry Limited, and manufactured by TCL. Unveiled on October 25, 2016,[1] it is BlackBerry's second device in the DTEK series after the BlackBerry DTEK50, and the third Android device after the BlackBerry Priv slider. As with the Priv and the DTEK50, the DTEK60 Android operating system is customized with features inspired by those seen on BlackBerry's in-house operating systems, and with hardware and software security enhancements (such as the titular DTEK software).[2] The DTEK60 features a fingerprint sensor on the rear of the device.[3]
