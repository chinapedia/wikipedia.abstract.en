In the summer of 2017, archaeologists from the University of Tübingen in Germany uncovered a collection of 3,200 year old Assyrian cuneiform tablets hidden inside a collection of ceramic jugs. These tablets reveal the location of the ancient lost royal city of Mardaman that once stood where Bassetki lies today. The tablets date back to when the area was part of the Middle Assyrian Empire.
