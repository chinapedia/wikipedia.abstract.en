Sacred grove of ancient Pisaureum, LUCUS PISAURENSIS is a sacerdotal lucus lying just outside the coastal _comune_ of Pesaro, Italy between the Colle della Salute (Hill of Salus) and the Collina (Hillside of the Springs of Beatitude) in Santa Veneranda.[1] Santa Veneranda is a hamlet in the Pesaro e Urbino Province of Marche, Italy, a pre-_Imperium Romanum_ region of the Latin Sabini, Umbrian and Estrucan tribes.


History of Discovery

_Pisaurensia Marmora_, ("Marble of Pesaro-Umbria"), a manuscript written by 18th Century Italian aristocrat Annibale degli Abbati Olivieri Giordani, was published in 1738.[2] In the preface, Olivieri reports having discovered, in the prior year, a sacred grove on his estate in a farm field by the little _Chiostro di Santo Gaetano dei Conti._[3] He calls the site _Lucus Pisaurensis_ (Sacred Grove of Pesaro) and provides a brief description of his findings. Olivieri further states that he plans to publish a future manuscript entitled _De Luco Sacred Veterum Pisaurensium_ ("The Sacred Grove of Ancient Pisaurensis"), once excavations are completed. This work however, was never published and interest in the _lucus_ disappeared after Oliviera's passing.

21ST CENTURY

During excavations in the 21st century, the grove was rediscovered[4] and archaeological interest in the site renewed.[5]


The Findings

Oliveri unearthed in his field, near the ancient _fontanine_ by the _Chiostro di Santo Gaetano dei Conti_,[6] 13 votive stones[7] or _cippi_,[8] carved of sandstone with Sabine inscriptions in Umbrian-Estrucan; a number of terracotta and sandstone artifacts; clay & copper coin;[9] and a small _semo_ replica in bronze inscribed _Libra_.[10] The votives were inscribed with names of various Sabini-Estrucan _semones_: Salute, Fide, Lucina, Marica, Feronia, Juno Regina; as well as the later Roman Gods: Iunos, Apolenei, Diana, Mater Matuta.

In addition to the found votives, coin and idol, a terracotta borderline marker was unearthed, inscribed: " _δ Δ δ luci coiirii CI LX_ ". _Luci Coiiri_ means 'Coerian Grove' and the Roman numerals are taken to reference land measurements._Cippi of Luci_, by L. Bouke van der Meer, BABESCH 90, 2015, ppg 103-104, ref. Gen. 2:21 מִצַּלְעֹתָ֔יו

Olivieri found numerous other artifacts on his estate, all of which are housed in the Biblioteca Oliveriana, a Museum and Library in Pesaro that he founded. Among these many findings are bronze and clay coinage, carved sandstone stela from 7th C. B.C. depicting naumachia (mock naval battles), the famed bronze Tabula Fabrorum[11] with the relief of Etruscan goddess Minerva (Pallas Athena).

The _fontanine_, or little fountains of stone, by groves near the _Chiostro_ where many of the votives are discoveried, give archaeologists reason to connect the _lucus_ to a cult of water[12] goddesses.[13] Latin meaning of the word _fontanine_[14] is 'spring waters' as referenced by Decimus Iūnius Iuvenālis, a Silver Age Roman poet, (55 - c. 138 CE), _Quaesitum ad fontem solos deducere verpus_, "To guide only the _condūcēbāmus_ to the fountain that they seek."[15]

EVOLUTION OF VOTIVES

It is of interest to note that over the millennia, as the original purpose of _luci_ became lost, votive stones, cippi and stelae translated to become grave markers and tombs.


Elements of Sacred Groves (_Luci_)

Ceremonies in _luci_ were centered around classic elements of a spring and a sylvan wood or coppice.[16] Trees with certain desired qualities of a mystical nature and waters of a certain mineral purity were essential to the creating of a Sacred Grove.[17]

One of these trees is the Laurus nobilis (_lat._ Laures, _gr._ Dáphnē Δάφνη), a Mediterranean tree native to the Greek and Roman territories of the early Italics, Illyrians and Iberians. The leaves, roots, berries and bark of the bay laurel contain volatile oils, malabathrum,[18] which stimulate sense glands of the nose, and were the basis[19] of these rituals.

Earliest ceremonies[20] of the bronze-age were very naturalistic, _πῖπτον_ [21] in scope and were enacted within an atmosphere of laurel-enhanced mysticism in the minds of the ethnarches[22] (founding tribal leaders) who performed these simple ceremonies[23] with their semones[24] in the surroundings of their sacred groves.

The Carmen Arvale is a surviving Classical-Age _Anticuus Latius[25] vocare mei_ chant of _di semones_[26] with the praepositus calling forth _quod potentia_ of their guardian divinities and imploring them to _limen sali, sta._

AN ALLEGORICAL MYTH OF "LUCI"

Daphne, a naiad (nymph, a spirit of springs and sacred groves) is pursued by Apollo and when she entreaties, is allegorically turned to a _laures_ tree by her river god Ladon.
