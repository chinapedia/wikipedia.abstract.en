Born in Naples, after getting a degree in law Rendine graduated in piano, harmony and composition at the San Pietro a Majella Conservatory. In the second half of the 1940s he moved to Milan, where he was active as conductor of dance orchestras and started collaborating with EIAR.[1][2]

Rendine debuted as a composer in 1947, and got his first success in 1948 with the song "A Zingarella". In 1950 he founded the record label Casa Musicale Rendine.
