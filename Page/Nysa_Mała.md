In the area of the foothills of the Sudetes it flows through the Chełmy Landscape Park.

The Little Neisse flows for much of its course through deciduous forests.

The entire course of the river is located south of Jawor, and north of Bolków and runs from west to east.

Between Gniewków and Czernica, the Little Neisse discharges into the Raging Neisse, the largest and most important tributary of the Kaczawa.
