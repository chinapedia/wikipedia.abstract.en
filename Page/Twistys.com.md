TWISTYS is a major adult film studio, producing its eponymous pornography website, Twistys.com, a variety site that caters to many different preferences.[1]


About

The Twistys website was acquired by Mindgeek in 2011.[2] Prior to MindGeek's acquisition, Twistys, along with sister sites: GayTube, SexTube and TrannyTube, belonged to Carsed Marketing. The Twisty's website is distinctive due to its softer approach to pornography. Despite elements of hardcore content, much of Twistys' content feature softcore pornography as well. The majority of content is accessible with a monthly membership. Its popularity is heightened by the fact that the site is updated daily, adding new material to the database constantly.[3]


Stats

As of November 2016, the Twistys website has a global traffic ranking of 18,769.[4]


Operations

Twistys.com, along with a large number of other well-known pornographic websites, is maintained and managed by MindGeek. The website ranks as the fourth most popular of MindGeek's network of porn sites.[5] When Twistys was originally acquired, Mindgeek was then-known as Manwin.[6]
The name change came shortly after managing partner, Fabian Thylman, stepped down. Thylman had first acquired the company after purchasing the assets from the original founders of Mansef.[7] In 2013, he sold his stakes to Feras Antoon and David Tassillo, the senior management of the company.[8] The company then merged with RedTube, a large porn tube site, thus creating MindGeek.[9]
