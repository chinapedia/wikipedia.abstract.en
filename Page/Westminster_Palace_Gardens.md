Westminster_Palace_Gardens,_Artillery_Row_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1031823.jpg WESTMINSTER PALACE GARDENS (WPG) is a Victorian red brick mansion block with apartments centred around a courtyard. It is located on Artillery Row in the City of Westminster, London. It is listed at grade II.[1]

The seven-story building was designed in the grand mansion style by architect Charles J.C. Pawley, and was built between 1898 and 1899. The façade of the building is clad at street level in blue and green faience tiles. In the centre of the façade are full height black iron gates, and a two-storey former carriage archway flanked by pilasters. Above the entrance at both first and second floor level are examples of lavish Victorian splendour with ornate terra cotta friezes that run the length of the façade.

WPG was built on the site of the artillery brewery, one of several breweries and distilleries in the area. However, the "artillery" name commemorates the historical use of the area for military exercises and target practice.
