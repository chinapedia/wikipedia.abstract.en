SVALBARD are an English hardcore punk band from Bristol, formed in 2011. Following early material (compiled on the album _Discography 2012–2014_) they have released two studio albums through Holy Roar Records: _One Day All This Will End_ (2015) and _It's Hard to Have Hope_ (2018). Their style integrates disparate influences, including post-rock and black metal.


History

Svalbard's first release was a self-titled EP released on 29 March 2012. It was re-released on 1 November 2013 after being remixed and remastered by Patrick W. Engel at Temple of Disharmony, who also mixed and mastered two further EPs that the band released that year, _Gone Tomorrow_ and _Flightless Birds_.[1] Ever since these early releases, the band has toured often in the UK and Europe.[2] On 7 July 2014, their split album with Pariso, with cover art by Daniel P. Carter, was released through multiple record labels (Tangled Talk in the UK, Holy Ground in the US, Swarm of Nails in France, Through Love in Germany and Smithsfoodgroup in the Netherlands).[3] This was followed by the band's debut studio album, _One Day All This Will End_, which was recorded and mixed by Lewis Johns and released on 25 September 2015 through Holy Roar Records.[4] Through Love handled the release in Germany and Halo of Flies in the US.[5] Music videos were released for the tracks "Disparity" and "Expect Equal Respect", the latter advocating for the acceptance of women within extreme music without treating them as anomalies.[6]

On 28 October 2016, _Discography 2012–2014_, a compilation album of all 15 songs that Svalbard recorded before their debut album, remastered by Brad Boatright, was released by Holy Roar in conjunction with Through Love and Halo of Flies.[7] A split EP with the Tidal Sleep featuring one new song from each band followed on 15 January 2017;[8] a music video for Svalbard's side of the split, "Open the Cages", was released on 12 November 2016. On 25 May 2018, they released their second studio album _It's Hard to Have Hope_.[9]


Musical style

On their Bandcamp, Svalbard place their work within the general categories of alternative, crust, hardcore, metal, punk, rock, and occasionally post-hardcore, post-rock, post-metal, black metal and emo.[10] Their label, Holy Roar Records, has described them as combining "post-hardcore, crust/d-beat, post-rock and black metal atmospherics and intensity" as well as drawing "musical influence from crust, post-rock and hardcore ... and lyrical influence from early 20th century existentialism".[11] They have also been described as: an "archetypal 2010s post-hardcore band" by _Drowned in Sound_;[12] performing "melodic hardcore, with dramatic overtones of post-rock and black metal" by _Bristol 24/7_;[13] performing "atmospheric hardcore" which blends "Explosions in the Sky influenced post metal ... [with] harsher and more aggressive aspects" by AveNoctum.com;[14] and "one of the brightest sparks in UK hardcore" by _Metal Hammer_.[15] In a positive review of _One Day All This Will End_, Echoes and Dust called it "a swirling mixture of hardcore, metal, crust, black metal and post-rock".[16] Rating their performance in London in August 2015 4/5, OneMetal.com wrote: "The [band's] Isis-inspired nuances feel all the more cathartic when paired with the blasts of harsh, mournful riffs, reminiscent of Modern Life Is War."[17]
