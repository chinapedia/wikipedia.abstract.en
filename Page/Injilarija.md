The INJILARIJA people were an Indigenous Australian people south of the Gulf of Carpentaria in Queensland who lived east of the Waanyi, south of the Nguburinji and west of the Mingginda that are considered extinct.


History

The Gulf Country's aborigines were severely affected by the rapid seizure and occupation of their lands by the great pastoral boom of the 1880s. One station at Lawn Hill in Injilarija territory was run by the Melbourne Grammar-educated Jack Watson, whose home had a trophy room with 40 pairs of aboriginal ears nailed to the walls, which he would show proudly to visitors. The traditional lands of the Injilarija, partially covered by the Boodjamulla National Park in the Shire of Burke were eventually taken over by right of succession by the Waanyi after the Injilariya were deemed to be extinct.
