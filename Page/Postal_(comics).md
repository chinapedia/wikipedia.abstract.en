_POSTAL_ is an American comic book series created by Matt Hawkins, Bryan Hill, and Isaac Goodhart and published by Top Cow Productions through Image Comics. The first issue was released in February 2015 and new installments were released on a near-monthly basis until its conclusion at issue 25 in January 2018. The characters and setting were also part of a three-issue limited series, _Eden's Fall_, in the Fall of 2016. Two one-shot issues were published as an epilogue in February and March 2018. A second volume of the comic is planned for 2019. The series has been collected in seven soft cover volumes and a television adaptation is in development for Hulu.

The story is set in Eden, Wyoming, a fictional town where ex-convicts secretly live together in peace. Residents must abide by the mayor's strict rules, and any crime is severely punished. Mark, the lead character, has Asperger syndrome and is both the mayor's son and the town's mail carrier. His violent father, who founded the town before being exiled from it, returns for revenge on Mark's mother and the town. As his parents struggle to influence him, Mark becomes more independent and assertive. When his mother triumphs over his father, she retires and Mark assumes her role in Eden.

_Postal_ debuted to mixed reviews from critics who found it to be contrived and predictable. As the series progressed, reviewers drew attention to the story's exploration of complicated moral issues. By its conclusion, both the writing and art were noted for their improvement.


Publication history

The concept behind _Postal_ was created by Matt Hawkins, who is also the president of Top Cow Productions. He drew inspiration from television shows _Northern Exposure_, _Twin Peaks_, and _True Detective_.[1] When Hawkins asked Bryan Hill to co-write the story, Hill accepted because he thought the quiet drama of the story would be challenging, saying that quiet drama does not come naturally to him.[2] Hawkins based the lead character on his college roommate, a smart man with Aspergers whose behavior was mocked by other students.[3] To ensure he wrote the condition authentically without being offensive, Hill researched the condition and spoke with people who have dealt with it.[4] The two writers chose to work with Isaac Goodhart, who had won Top Cow's annual talent hunt contest in 2014, because of his artistic style.[5] In a 2016 interview, Hill described _Postal_ as "a Norman Rockwell painting, if there was blood in it."[6]

The series was formally announced as a four-issue limited series on November 10, 2014.[7][8] The first issue was released in February 2015 and sold an estimated 14,000 physical copies, selling out at the distributor level.[9][10] Subsequent issues continued to sell out, prompting the series to switch to an ongoing monthly series.[11][12] Digital copies of the first issue were temporarily available for free as part of the In-Store Convention Kick-off event held in March 2016, then again in September 2016 when the television adaptation for Hulu was announced.[13][14] In November 2015, a special one-shot issue titled _Postal: Dossier_ featured a comic story with art by Atilio Rojo that served as a Frame story to prose dossiers on important characters. Beginning with #12, Hawkins removed his name from the credits as writer because Hill was doing most of the work. Although Hawkins still gave input on the story and dialogue,[15] he called Hill a "dialogue wizard".[16] Hill said the book was hard to write because it was unpleasant exploring the "darker aspects of humanity" in the story.[17]

In the fall of 2016, _Eden's Fall_ was a three-issue crossover limited series that tied _Postal_ to two other comic titles created by Hawkins, _The Tithe_ and _Think Tank_. It was co-written by Hawkins and Hill with art by Atilo Rojo.[18] The three series were not initially conceived as a shared universe, but they share similar themes and Hawkins said it "made sense" to mix them together because they are all "down to Earth thrillers".[19][20] Following the conclusion of _Eden's Fall_, subsequent issues of each series included an icon indicating they were part of the "Eden-verse".[21]

The series concluded with issue #25 in January 2018. It was followed by two one shots, _Postal: Mark_ by Hawkins and Rojo and _Postal: Laura_ by Hill and Goodhart, that served as epilogues. Hawkins returned to write the _Mark_ issue because the interactions between Mark and his parents were his favorite parts of the story. A second volume was being developed by Hawkins and Hill in early 2018 and is expected to launch in 2019. They hope Goodhart will return, but as of May 2018 he was not confirmed.[22]

Although initial monthly sales were strong, Hawkins said that later sales were more oriented toward the softcover collections that were released during serialization. Each softcover contains four issues worth of material and first became available about a month after the release of the final issue included within it. As orders for individual issues declined, sales of the collections were consistent and growing in the book market and for online retailers like Amazon.[23][24]


Plot

In the early 1970s,[25] criminals Isaac and Laura Shiffron help FBI agent Jon Schultz hide five million dollars in gold bars he stole from a crime scene. In exchange, Schultz agrees to use his position of power to prevent outside authorities from investigating anything in the small town of Eden, Wyoming.[26] Isaac and Laura turn Eden into a safe haven for convicts who live by their strict laws and religious ideals. Punishment for disobedience is severe because any criminal activity within Eden may bring attention to the city. When Isaac begins to abuse his authority, Laura and most of the town try to kill him, but he escapes. Laura was pregnant at this time, but gives her baby daughter away because she did not want another part of Isaac to remain in town. She keeps Mark, her toddler with Asperger's syndrome, and becomes Eden's mayor.[27]

Years later, Mark has become Eden's mail carrier and is treated badly by everyone in town except for Maggie, a young waitress at the town's diner and Mark's love interest. Life in the town is disrupted when Isaac leaves his daughter's dead body in front of the town church. With the help of some secret loyalists in Eden, Isaac asks Mark to meet him. Isaac tells Mark that Laura has raised him to be weak, but that he has strength buried inside. They beat Mark and leave him hanging from a tree in Laura's yard. Isaac says surviving the experience will prove how strong Mark is, and it will punish Laura by making Mark more like him.[28]

After his recovery, Mark realizes his Asperger's gives him a unique view of the world and allows him to see details and patterns that others do not. He begins using his talents to expose some troublemakers and start new friendships.[29] He also starts to openly pursue Maggie, who explains that she was a leader in a heroin running gang in Los Angeles before being caught and sent to Eden.[30] She returns some of his affection, but also sees Mark as a way for her to gain some power in Eden.[31]

When Schultz's sociopathic daughter Molly[32] needs to hide from some Armenian gangsters, Schultz threatens to renege on their deal if Laura does not protect her.[33] Shortly after arriving in Eden, Molly murders two people and Laura is unable to explain why she is not punished because most of the town is unaware of her arrangement with Schultz. After Molly assaults Maggie,[34] Mark discovers that Molly feels love toward her father. He has a prison cell built in an abandoned mine shaft and promises to kill her father if she does not remain there. Once a week, he brings her a phone so she can tell her father that she is safe and happy.[35]

Because of Isaac's return and other events, some townspeople begin to lose faith in Laura as a leader. She collapses from stress and Eden's doctor suggests she prepare a succession plan. He tells her that no one fears Mark, and that Maggie would be a better choice. Instead, Laura makes Mark the temporary Mayor so she can see how he performs. Mark is unhappy in this role.[36] Soon thereafter, Molly escapes her prison and tries to kill Laura. Mark and Maggie intervene and kill Molly. In exchange for saving her life, Laura agrees to resume her duties as Mayor.[37]

Meanwhile, FBI Agent Bremble has been trying to investigate Eden.[38] Tired of being stonewalled by his superiors, he goes rogue and locates Isaac.[39] Although Bremble despises Isaac, they agree to work together because they both want to destroy Eden - Bremble because it offends his sense of justice, and Isaac because it is not what he intended it to become.[40] Together they threaten Schultz, who tells Laura that he is scared and wants to run away with his money and daughter. Laura kills him instead.[41] When Isaac and Bremble invade Eden, Bremble kills Isaac's other followers. Laura publicly reveals that Bremble has been her mole the whole time, then beats Isaac with a shotgun. This event restores the town's faith in her leadership.[42]

Later, Laura fakes her death and leaves Eden with her lover, Sheriff Marcum.[43] Mark begins acting as the mayor with the town's support and learns Maggie is pregnant. He does not want his family line to continue, but she wants to have a child. Mark agrees to keep her happy. To prevent his father from corrupting his child, Mark has Isaac brought to him and uses a screwdriver to give Isaac a lobotomy.[44] Maggie miscarries soon after and becomes the new sheriff of Eden. She is called to a murder scene where a man has killed his wife. Maggie kills him, then finds their newborn daughter in a crib. She and Mark adopt the child.[45]


Critical reception

According to review aggregator Comic Book Roundup, the first issue of the series received an average score of 7.4/10 based on 18 reviews.[46] The series as a whole averages 8.3/10, based on 103 reviews.[47]

Critics had mixed opinions about the first issue. The visuals were described as "strong" by _Unleash the Fanboy_ reviewer Harrison Rawdin,[48] but in his review for _Comic Book Resources_, Matt Little felt Goodhart's background as a storyboard artist led to a lack of variation in panel sizes which minimized the impact of some scenes.[49] The characters were also praised by Rawdin, although Mark's portrayal was described as "borderline stereotypical" in Sam Graven's review for _Big Comic Page_.[50] All three of these reviewers found fault in the plot, which they described as "uneven",[51] "contrived",[52] and "too predictable".[53] Graven felt that _Postal_ was especially disappointing in comparison to contemporary new series from Image such as _Saga_ and _Lazarus_.[54]

As the series progressed, reviewers focused on the story's themes. The "uneasy moral questions" explored by Hill were appealing to _Newsarama_ reviewer CK Stewart.[55] Daniel Gehen told readers that _Postal_ explored "religious extremism, hate crimes, and redemption" among other concepts in a review for _Comics Bulletin_.[56] The observations align with Hill's stated intention to model Eden's morality after that found in the Old Testament, which he feels would be horrifying to modern society.[57] While the premise of Eden interested David Pepose, he said in a review for _Newsarama_ that the real draw was Mark and his Asperger's, which he felt overshadowed the criminal elements of the story.[58]

Although the resolution of the story's main conflict in issue 24 was criticized in a review for _Spartantown_ by Enrique Rea,[59] the epilogue issues were generally better received.[60][61] Rea found the climatic battle to be too brief and too convenient to be satisfying, and he disliked how inconsequential Mark's role was.[62] Goodhart was noted for his artistic improvement over the course of the series in Nick Nafpliotis' review for _Adventures in Poor Taste_, who described issue 25 as his best work yet.[63] Michael Mazzacane agreed in a review for _Multiversity Comics_, saying that Goodhart's panel layouts did a good job of controlling the narrative pace.[64] Stewart described the work of colorist K Michael Russell in issue 25 as essential to the story's mood.[65] Gehen and Nafpliotis both enjoyed the _Postal: Mark_ one shot,[66][67] and Mazzacane called _Postal: Laura_ one of the series' better issues.[68]


Adaptation

A live action television adaptation of _Postal_ from Matt Tolmach and Legendary Entertainment was in development in early 2016.[69][70] _The Walking Dead_ executive producer Seth Hoffman is writing the pilot script.[71] After tough competition for the rights,[72][73] it was picked up by Hulu in September 2016.[74]
