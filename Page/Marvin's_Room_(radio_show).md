_MARVIN'S ROOM_ is a Canadian radio program, which airs on CBC Music.[1] Hosted by Amanda Parris, the program explores the genre of rhythm and blues, incorporating both historical and contemporary music in the genre.[2]

The program premiered in July 2016 as a short-run summer series.[3] Following the end of the show's original run, the CBC announced that the series would return as a permanent part of the network's regular schedule, beginning in November 2016.[4]

The title was chosen because it symbolically connects the history and the future of the genre, linking Marvin Gaye's historic recording studio Marvin's Room with the contemporary Drake song "Marvins Room".[5]

The series is also repeated on CBC Radio One in a weekend slot.
