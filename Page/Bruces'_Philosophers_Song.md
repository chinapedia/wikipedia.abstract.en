"BRUCES' PHILOSOPHERS SONG (BRUCES' SONG)" is a popular Monty Python song written and composed by Eric Idle[1] that was a feature of the group's stage appearances and its recordings.


Origins

The Bruces' Philosophy Song is sung by _THE BRUCES_, stereotypical "ocker" Australians of the period. The Bruces are kitted out in khakis, slouch hats and a cork hat and are faculty members of the Philosophy Department at the fictional University of Woolamaloo. (N.B. there is no such place as Woolamaloo in Australia but Woolloomooloo is an inner suburb of Sydney. There is no university there, though the real-life University of Sydney is not far away.)

The Bruces themselves first appeared in the Bruces sketch which featured in episode 22 "How to Recognise Different Parts of the Body" of the TV show _Monty Python's Flying Circus_, first broadcast on 24 November 1970. The sketch shows an English academic (played by Terry Jones) coming to a hot and perhaps remote part of Australia and being inducted by the Bruces (Cleese, Chapman, Idle and Palin) into their Philosophy Department, seemingly located in a simple wooden shack. The Bruces are lounging around a wooden table and soon start drinking cans of Foster's Lager.

The song was not part of the TV sketch; it first appeared on the Monty Python's 1973 album _Matching Tie and Handkerchief_ as a coda for the album version of the sketch. The song was subsequently included in most of the Monty Python team's live shows, sometimes as a singalong with musical accompaniment provided by a Jew's harp.


Lyrics

The song's lyrics make a series of scandalous allegations about a number of highly respected philosophers, usually with regard to their capacity or incapacity for imbibing intoxicating beverages.[2][3]

There is some debate over whether the sixth line is supposed to be "Schopenhauer and Hegel" or just "Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel." The reason for the confusion is that existing live recordings of the song (included in the _Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl_ film and on the albums _Live at Drury Lane_ and _Live at City Center_) have the "Schopenhauer and Hegel" version, while the studio recording on _Matching Tie and Handkerchief_ features the "Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel" version. However, the publication of the lyrics with the release of _Monty Python Sings_ suggests that the "Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel" version is the official one. (The reason for the change of lyric may be that the philosopher in question's name is actually _Georg_ Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and that Georg is pronounced in German with two syllables (GAY-org) making it difficult for the philosopher's full name to fit in the song.)


The philosophers

Philosophers mentioned in the song (in order):

1.  Immanuel Kant (a real pissant who was very rarely stable)
2.  Martin Heidegger (a boozy beggar who could think you under the table)
3.  David Hume (able to out consume Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel)
4.  Arthur Schopenhauer (some versions) (out consumed by Hume)
5.  G. W. F. Hegel (Ibid)
6.  Ludwig Wittgenstein (a beery swine who was just as sloshed as Schlegel)
7.  Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel and/or August Wilhelm Schlegel (Wittgenstein is alleged be just as sloshed as)
8.  Friedrich Nietzsche (particularly knowledgeable about "the raising of the wrist")
9.  Socrates (the only one mentioned twice in the song) (permanently pissed)
10. John Stuart Mill (particularly ill after half a pint of shandy)
11. Plato (said to regularly consume half a crate of whiskey daily)
12. Aristotle (a bugger for the bottle)
13. Thomas Hobbes (fond of his dram)
14. René Descartes (a drunken fart)
15. Socrates (second mention) (particularly missed, noted as both a lovely little thinker, but a bugger when he’s pissed)

Philosophical references

Some of the philosophers are portrayed according to their works.

-   Kant being "very rarely stable" harkens to his theory of a stable universe.
-   John Stuart Mill becoming ill "of his own free will" alludes to his 1859 work _On Liberty_, which argues for liberty that does no harm to others.
-   Plato is, famously, the author of the dialogue _Symposium_, taking place at a drinking party, as the title itself says. Socrates appears prominently in it.
-   The Descartes line, "I drink therefore I am", is a twist on his well-known phrase "Cogito, ergo sum," or "I think therefore I am".
