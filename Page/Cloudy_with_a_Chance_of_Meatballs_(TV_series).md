_CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS_ (also called _CLOUDY: THE SERIES_[1]) is a Canadian/American spin-off animated comic sci-fi sitcom television series produced by DHX Media and Sony Pictures Animation in association with Corus Entertainment for Cartoon Network and YTV.[2] Based on the children's book and the film series of the same name,[3] _Cloudy_ is the first television series to be produced by Sony Pictures Animation and was animated using Toon Boom Harmony.[4]

The series officially premiered in the United States on March 6, 2017 on Cartoon Network, with a sneak peek airing on February 20, 2017.[5] After an unsuccessful run, the show moved to Boomerang's SVOD service, where it debuted on January 11, 2018. In Canada, the series was originally planned to air on Teletoon,[6] but instead premiered on YTV on April 6, 2017. On February 2, 2018, DHX Media announced the series has been picked up for a second season.[7] The entire first season is available on Netflix in the United Kingdom and in the United States.


Plot

The series is a prequel, featuring the high school years of Flint Lockwood, the eccentric young scientist in the films.[8] In his adventures, he is joined by Sam Sparks, a new girl in town and the school's "wannabe" reporter, along with Flint's dad Tim, Steve the Monkey, Manny as the head of the school's audiovisual club (among other professions), Earl as a school gym teacher, Brent still riding on his fame as from the sardine commercial, and Mayor Shelbourne, who serves as school principal, and who wins every Mayoral election on the pro-sardine platform.[9]

The show clarifies that when Flint and Sam met in their adulthood in the first film, it was not their first meeting. They first met and became friends in high school. In the first episode, Flint says that if Sam ever has to move away from Swallow Falls, he will invent a memory eraser, as she had moved around frequently and did not want the memory of another lost friendship to sadden her.

Notes


Reception

The show received a mixed to negative response from audiences, currently holding a 3.2/10 rating on IMDb.[25]

Common Sense Media rated the show a three out of five stars stating "_Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs_ doesn't attempt to lead directly into the movies and in fact presents a major inconsistency for the later stories by introducing Sam to Flint during their teen years. Of course this is only a concern for those who have seen the chronologically later stories first; new viewers without a history with these characters won't have a problem and likely will want to follow up with the movies at some point. A big plus to the show? Even though the science often isn't realistic, the hero and heroine make nerdiness seem pretty cool."[26]
