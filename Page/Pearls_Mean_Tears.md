Plot

Aunt Agatha intends to engage Bertie to "a nice quiet girl" named Aline Hemmingway. Bertie is forced to spend some time with Aline and her brother, Rev. Sidney Hemmingway, but finds them dreary. After Sidney loses money at the races, he borrows £100 from Bertie with Aline's pearl necklace on deposit. Coincidentally, Aunt Agatha's pearl necklace goes missing.

Charles Edward Biffen ("Biffy") cannot find a girl to whom he was engaged, named Mabel. Primarily because he cannot remember her surname. But Mabel is Jeeve’s niece. Biffy comes to Jeeves for help, but Jeeves, who happens to be the Mabel's uncle, and misunderstands Biffy's intentions, does not wish to help. Mabel is now a British burlesque dancer and showgirl who performs in the theatre. At the end Jeeves produces a plan to get Biffy and Mabel together and suggests to Biffy that he may go to the theatre. Disaster ensues when Biffy sees Mabel dancing and singing in the theatre. Biffy proposes and she accepts his proposal and Honoria cries hysterically.
