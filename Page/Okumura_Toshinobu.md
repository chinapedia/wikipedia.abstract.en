Okumura_Toshinobu_-Actor_Yamashita_Kinsaku_I_as_Tora_Gozen,_mid_1720s.jpg

OKUMURA TOSHINOBU (, birth and death dates unknown) was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist. He is the only known student of Okumura Masanobu; many of his works nonetheless appeared from publishers other than Masanobu.

The majority of Toshinobu's works come from the Genbun era (1716â€“1741), and are mostly prints in the _beni-e_ ("red picture[s]") and _urushi-e_ ("lacquer picture[s]") styles. Many of his works depict people selling things. Toshinobu also made _yakusha-e_ portraits of kabuki actors; in contrast to the Torii school, rather than heroics, Toshionobu tended to depict scenes of romance.
