Hay held a range of positions on professional bodies, including vice president of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians from 1988 to 1992, president of the Canterbury branch of the British Medical Association in 1972, and New Zealand chair of the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand from 1977 to 1981. In 1977 he was appointed a member of the World Health Organization Expert Advisory Panel on Tobacco and Health, and in 1987 he became an overseas regional advisor to the Royal College of Physicians.[21]
