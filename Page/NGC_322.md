NGC 322 is a lenticular galaxy located approximately 318 million light-years from the Solar System[1] in the constellation Phoenix. It was discovered on September 5, 1834 by John Herschel. It was described by Dreyer as "very faint, very small, round, a little brighter middle, 3 stars to west." It apparently seems to be interacting with PGC 95427, another galaxy.[2]
