Richard Wagner in 1871 Richard_Wagner_Signature.svg WILHELM RICHARD WAGNER (, ;[1] 22 May 181313 February 1883) was a German composer, theatre director, polemicist, and conductor who is chiefly known for his operas (or, as some of his later works were later known, "music dramas"). Unlike most opera composers, Wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works. Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of Carl Maria von Weber and Giacomo Meyerbeer, Wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the _Gesamtkunstwerk_ ("total work of art"), by which he sought to synthesise the poetic, visual, musical and dramatic arts, with music subsidiary to drama. He described this vision in a series of essays published between 1849 and 1852. Wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the four-opera cycle _Der Ring des Nibelungen_ (_The Ring of the Nibelung_).

His compositions, particularly those of his later period, are notable for their complex textures, rich harmonies and orchestration, and the elaborate use of leitmotifs—musical phrases associated with individual characters, places, ideas, or plot elements. His advances in musical language, such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres, greatly influenced the development of classical music. His _Tristan und Isolde_ is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music.

Wagner had his own opera house built, the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, which embodied many novel design features. The _Ring_ and _Parsifal_ were premiered here and his most important stage works continue to be performed at the annual Bayreuth Festival, run by his descendants. His thoughts on the relative contributions of music and drama in opera were to change again, and he reintroduced some traditional forms into his last few stage works, including _Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg_ (_The Mastersingers of Nuremberg_).

Until his final years, Wagner's life was characterised by political exile, turbulent love affairs, poverty and repeated flight from his creditors. His controversial writings on music, drama and politics have attracted extensive comment, notably, since the late 20th century, where they express antisemitic sentiments. The effect of his ideas can be traced in many of the arts throughout the 20th century; his influence spread beyond composition into conducting, philosophy, literature, the visual arts and theatre.


Biography

Early years

Richard Wagner was born to an ethnic German family in Leipzig, who lived at No 3, the Brühl (_The House of the Red and White Lions_) in the Jewish quarter. He was baptized at St. Thomas Church. He was the ninth child of Carl Friedrich Wagner, who was a clerk in the Leipzig police service, and his wife, Johanna Rosine (née Paetz), the daughter of a baker.[2]{{#tag:ref|Of their children, two (Carl Gustave and Maria Theresia) died as infants. The others were Wagner's brothers Albert and Carl Julius, and his sisters Rosalie, Luise, Clara and Ottilie. Except for Carl Julius becoming a goldsmith, all his siblings developed careers connected with the stage. Wagner also had a younger half-sister, Caecilie, born in 1815 to his mother and her second husband Geyer.[3] See also Wagner family tree.|group=n}} Wagner's father Carl died of typhus six months after Richard's birth. Afterwards, his mother Johanna lived with Carl's friend, the actor and playwright Ludwig Geyer.[4] In August 1814 Johanna and Geyer probably married—although no documentation of this has been found in the Leipzig church registers.[5] She and her family moved to Geyer's residence in Dresden. Until he was fourteen, Wagner was known as Wilhelm Richard Geyer. He almost certainly thought that Geyer was his biological father.[6]

Geyer's love of the theatre came to be shared by his stepson, and Wagner took part in his performances. In his autobiography _Mein Leben_ Wagner recalled once playing the part of an angel.[7] In late 1820, Wagner was enrolled at Pastor Wetzel's school at Possendorf, near Dresden, where he received some piano instruction from his Latin teacher.[8] He struggled to play a proper scale at the keyboard and preferred playing theatre overtures by ear. Following Geyer's death in 1821, Richard was sent to the Kreuzschule, the boarding school of the Dresdner Kreuzchor, at the expense of Geyer's brother.[9] At the age of nine he was hugely impressed by the Gothic elements of Carl Maria von Weber's opera _Der Freischütz,_ which he saw Weber conduct.[10] At this period Wagner entertained ambitions as a playwright. His first creative effort, listed in the _Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis_ (the standard listing of Wagner's works) as WWV 1, was a tragedy called _Leubald._ Begun when he was in school in 1826, the play was strongly influenced by Shakespeare and Goethe. Wagner was determined to set it to music and persuaded his family to allow him music lessons.[11]{{#tag:ref|This sketch is referred to alternatively as _Leubald und Adelaide_.|group=n}}

By 1827, the family had returned to Leipzig. Wagner's first lessons in harmony were taken during 1828–31 with Christian Gottlieb Müller.[12] In January 1828 he first heard Beethoven's 7th Symphony and then, in March, the same composer's 9th Symphony (both at the Gewandhaus). Beethoven became a major inspiration, and Wagner wrote a piano transcription of the 9th Symphony.[13] He was also greatly impressed by a performance of Mozart's _Requiem._[14] Wagner's early piano sonatas and his first attempts at orchestral overtures date from this period.[15]

In 1829 he saw a performance by dramatic soprano Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient, and she became his ideal of the fusion of drama and music in opera. In _Mein Leben_, Wagner wrote, "When I look back across my entire life I find no event to place beside this in the impression it produced on me," and claimed that the "profoundly human and ecstatic performance of this incomparable artist" kindled in him an "almost demonic fire."[16]{{#tag:ref|Wagner claimed to have seen Schröder-Devrient in the title role of _Fidelio_, but it seems more likely that he saw her performance as Romeo in Bellini's _I Capuleti e i Montecchi_.[17]|group=n}}

In 1831, Wagner enrolled at the Leipzig University, where he became a member of the Saxon student fraternity.[18] He took composition lessons with the Thomaskantor Theodor Weinlig.[19] Weinlig was so impressed with Wagner's musical ability that he refused any payment for his lessons. He arranged for his pupil's Piano Sonata in B-flat major (which was consequently dedicated to him) to be published as Wagner's Op. 1. A year later, Wagner composed his Symphony in C major, a Beethovenesque work performed in Prague in 1832[20] and at the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1833.[21] He then began to work on an opera, _Die Hochzeit_ (_The Wedding_), which he never completed.[22]

Early career and marriage (1833–1842)

She wears a small hat, a cloak and dress that expose her shoulders and pearl earrings. On her left hand that holds the edge of the cloak, two rings are visible.]]In 1833, Wagner's brother Albert managed to obtain for him a position as choirmaster at the theatre in Würzburg.[23] In the same year, at the age of 20, Wagner composed his first complete opera, _Die Feen_ (_The Fairies_). This work, which imitated the style of Weber, went unproduced until half a century later, when it was premiered in Munich shortly after the composer's death in 1883.[24]

Having returned to Leipzig in 1834, Wagner held a brief appointment as musical director at the opera house in Magdeburg[25] during which he wrote _Das Liebesverbot_ (_The Ban on Love_), based on Shakespeare's _Measure for Measure_. This was staged at Magdeburg in 1836 but closed before the second performance; this, together with the financial collapse of the theatre company employing him, left the composer in bankruptcy.[26][27] Wagner had fallen for one of the leading ladies at Magdeburg, the actress Christine Wilhelmine "Minna" Planer[28] and after the disaster of _Das Liebesverbot_ he followed her to Königsberg, where she helped him to get an engagement at the theatre.[29] The two married in Tragheim Church on 24 November 1836.[30] In May 1837, Minna left Wagner for another man,[31] and this was but only the first débâcle of a tempestuous marriage. In June 1837, Wagner moved to Riga (then in the Russian Empire), where he became music director of the local opera;[32] having in this capacity engaged Minna's sister Amalie (also a singer) for the theatre, he presently resumed relations with Minna during 1838.[33]

By 1839, the couple had amassed such large debts that they fled Riga on the run from creditors.[34] Debts would plague Wagner for most of his life.[35] Initially they took a stormy sea passage to London,[36] from which Wagner drew the inspiration for his opera _Der fliegende Holländer_ (_The Flying Dutchman_), with a plot based on a sketch by Heinrich Heine.[37] The Wagners settled in Paris in September 1839[38] and stayed there until 1842. Wagner made a scant living by writing articles and short novelettes such as _A pilgrimage to Beethoven_, which sketched his growing concept of "music drama", and _An end in Paris_, where he depicts his own miseries as a German musician in the French metropolis.[39] He also provided arrangements of operas by other composers, largely on behalf of the Schlesinger publishing house. During this stay he completed his third and fourth operas _Rienzi_ and _Der fliegende Holländer_.[40]

Dresden (1842–1849)

Richard_Wagner_c.1840.jpgWagner had completed _Rienzi_ in 1840. With the strong support of Giacomo Meyerbeer,[41] it was accepted for performance by the Dresden Court Theatre (_Hofoper_) in the Kingdom of Saxony and in 1842, Wagner moved to Dresden. His relief at returning to Germany was recorded in his "Autobiographic Sketch" of 1842, where he wrote that, en route from Paris, "For the first time I saw the Rhine—with hot tears in my eyes, I, poor artist, swore eternal fidelity to my German fatherland."[42] _Rienzi_ was staged to considerable acclaim on 20 October.[43]

Wagner lived in Dresden for the next six years, eventually being appointed the Royal Saxon Court Conductor.[44] During this period, he staged there _Der fliegende Holländer_ (2 January 1843)[45] and _Tannhäuser_ (19 October 1845),[46] the first two of his three middle-period operas. Wagner also mixed with artistic circles in Dresden, including the composer Ferdinand Hiller and the architect Gottfried Semper.[47][48]

Wagner's involvement in left-wing politics abruptly ended his welcome in Dresden. Wagner was active among socialist German nationalists there, regularly receiving such guests as the conductor and radical editor August Röckel and the Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin.[49] He was also influenced by the ideas of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Ludwig Feuerbach.[50] Widespread discontent came to a head in 1849, when the unsuccessful May Uprising in Dresden broke out, in which Wagner played a minor supporting role. Warrants were issued for the revolutionaries' arrest. Wagner had to flee, first visiting Paris and then settling in Zürich[51]{{#tag:ref|Röckel and Bakunin failed to escape and endured long terms of imprisonment.|group=n}} where he at first took refuge with a friend, Alexander Müller.[52]

In exile: Switzerland (1849–1858)

Richard_Wagners_Steckbrief_1849.jpgWagner was to spend the next twelve years in exile from Germany. He had completed _Lohengrin_, the last of his middle-period operas, before the Dresden uprising, and now wrote desperately to his friend Franz Liszt to have it staged in his absence. Liszt conducted the premiere in Weimar in August 1850.[53]

Nevertheless, Wagner was in grim personal straits, isolated from the German musical world and without any regular income. In 1850, Julie, the wife of his friend Karl Ritter, began to pay him a small pension which she maintained until 1859. With help from her friend Jessie Laussot, this was to have been augmented to an annual sum of 3,000 Thalers per year; but this plan was abandoned when Wagner began an affair with Mme. Laussot. Wagner even planned an elopement with her in 1850, which her husband prevented.[54] Meanwhile, Wagner's wife Minna, who had disliked the operas he had written after _Rienzi_, was falling into a deepening depression. Wagner fell victim to ill-health, according to Ernest Newman "largely a matter of overwrought nerves", which made it difficult for him to continue writing.[55]{{#tag:ref|Gutman records him as suffering from constipation and shingles.[56]|group=n}}

Wagner's primary published output during his first years in Zürich was a set of essays. In "The Artwork of the Future" (1849), he described a vision of opera as _Gesamtkunstwerk_ ("total work of art"), in which the various arts such as music, song, dance, poetry, visual arts and stagecraft were unified. "Judaism in Music" (1850)[57] was the first of Wagner's writings to feature antisemitic views.[58] In this polemic Wagner argued, frequently using traditional antisemitic abuse, that Jews had no connection to the German spirit, and were thus capable of producing only shallow and artificial music. According to him, they composed music to achieve popularity and, thereby, financial success, as opposed to creating genuine works of art.[59]

In "Opera and Drama" (1851), Wagner described the aesthetics of drama that he was using to create the _Ring_ operas. Before leaving Dresden, Wagner had drafted a scenario that eventually became the four-opera cycle _Der Ring des Nibelungen_. He initially wrote the libretto for a single opera, _Siegfrieds Tod_ (_Siegfried's Death_), in 1848. After arriving in Zürich, he expanded the story with the opera _Der junge Siegfried_ (_Young Siegfried_), which explored the hero's background. He completed the text of the cycle by writing the libretti for _Die Walküre_ (_The Valkyrie_) and _Das Rheingold_ (_The Rhine Gold_) and revising the other libretti to agree with his new concept, completing them in 1852.[60] The concept of opera expressed in "Opera and Drama" and in other essays effectively renounced the operas he had previously written, up to and including _Lohengrin._ Partly in an attempt to explain his change of views, Wagner published in 1851 the autobiographical "A Communication to My Friends".[61] This contained his first public announcement of what was to become the _Ring_ cycle:

  I shall never write an _Opera_ more. As I have no wish to invent an arbitrary title for my works, I will call them Dramas ...

  I propose to produce my myth in three complete dramas, preceded by a lengthy Prelude (Vorspiel). ...

  At a specially-appointed Festival, I propose, some future time, to produce those three Dramas with their Prelude, _in the course of three days and a fore-evening_ [emphasis in original].[62]

Wagner began composing the music for _Das Rheingold_ between November 1853 and September 1854, following it immediately with _Die Walküre_ (written between June 1854 and March 1856).[63] He began work on the third _Ring_ opera, which he now called simply _Siegfried,_ probably in September 1856, but by June 1857 he had completed only the first two acts. He decided to put the work aside to concentrate on a new idea: _Tristan und Isolde,_[64] based on the Arthurian love story _Tristan and Iseult._

Mathilde_Wesendonck_by_Karl_Ferdinand_Sohn,_1850.jpg (1850) by Karl Ferdinand Sohn|alt=A three-quarter length portrait of a young white woman in the open air. She wears a shawl over an elaborate long-sleeved dress that exposes her shoulders and has a hat on over her centrally parted dark hair.]] One source of inspiration for _Tristan und Isolde_ was the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, notably his _The World as Will and Representation,_ to which Wagner had been introduced in 1854 by his poet friend Georg Herwegh. Wagner later called this the most important event of his life.[65] His personal circumstances certainly made him an easy convert to what he understood to be Schopenhauer's philosophy, a deeply pessimistic view of the human condition. He remained an adherent of Schopenhauer for the rest of his life.[66]

One of Schopenhauer's doctrines was that music held a supreme role in the arts as a direct expression of the world's essence, namely, blind, impulsive will.[67] This doctrine contradicted Wagner's view, expressed in "Opera and Drama", that the music in opera had to be subservient to the drama. Wagner scholars have argued that Schopenhauer's influence caused Wagner to assign a more commanding role to music in his later operas, including the latter half of the _Ring_ cycle, which he had yet to compose.[68]{{#tag:ref|The influence was noted by Nietzsche in his "On the Genealogy of Morality": "[the] fascinating position of Schopenhauer on art ... was apparently the reason Richard Wagner first moved over to Schopenhauer ... That shift was so great that it opened up a complete theoretical contrast between his earlier and his later aesthetic beliefs."[69] |group=n}} Aspects of Schopenhauerian doctrine found their way into Wagner's subsequent libretti.{{#tag:ref|For example, the self-renouncing cobbler-poet Hans Sachs in _Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg_ is a "Schopenhauerian" creation; Schopenhauer asserted that goodness and salvation result from renunciation of the world, and turning against and denying one's own will.[70]|group=n}}

A second source of inspiration was Wagner's infatuation with the poet-writer Mathilde Wesendonck, the wife of the silk merchant Otto Wesendonck. Wagner met the Wesendoncks, who were both great admirers of his music, in Zürich in 1852. From May 1853 onwards Wesendonck made several loans to Wagner to finance his household expenses in Zürich,[71] and in 1857 placed a cottage on his estate at Wagner's disposal,[72] which became known as the _Asyl_ ("asylum" or "place of rest"). During this period, Wagner's growing passion for his patron's wife inspired him to put aside work on the _Ring_ cycle (which was not resumed for the next twelve years) and begin work on _Tristan_.[73] While planning the opera, Wagner composed the _Wesendonck Lieder,_ five songs for voice and piano, setting poems by Mathilde. Two of these settings are explicitly subtitled by Wagner as "studies for _Tristan und Isolde_".[74]

Amongst the conducting engagements that Wagner undertook for revenue during this period, he gave several concerts in 1855 with the Philharmonic Society of London, including one before Queen Victoria.[75] The Queen enjoyed his _Tannhäuser_ overture and spoke with Wagner after the concert, writing of him in her diary that he was "short, very quiet, wears spectacles & has a very finely-developed forehead, a hooked nose & projecting chin."[76]

In exile: Venice and Paris (1858–1862)

Richard_Wagner,_Paris,_1861.jpgWagner's uneasy affair with Mathilde collapsed in 1858, when Minna intercepted a letter to Mathilde from him.[77] After the resulting confrontation with Minna, Wagner left Zürich alone, bound for Venice, where he rented an apartment in the Palazzo Giustinian, while Minna returned to Germany.[78] Wagner's attitude to Minna had changed; the editor of his correspondence with her, John Burk, has said that she was to him "an invalid, to be treated with kindness and consideration, but, except at a distance, [was] a menace to his peace of mind."[79] Wagner continued his correspondence with Mathilde and his friendship with her husband Otto, who maintained his financial support of the composer. In an 1859 letter to Mathilde, Wagner wrote, half-satirically, of _Tristan_: "Child! This Tristan is turning into something _terrible_. This final act!!!—I fear the opera will be banned ... only mediocre performances can save me! Perfectly good ones will be bound to drive people mad."[80]

In November 1859, Wagner once again moved to Paris to oversee production of a new revision of _Tannhäuser_, staged thanks to the efforts of Princess Pauline von Metternich, whose husband was the Austrian ambassador in Paris. The performances of the Paris _Tannhäuser_ in 1861 were a notable fiasco. This was partly a consequence of the conservative tastes of the Jockey Club, which organised demonstrations in the theatre to protest at the presentation of the ballet feature in act 1 (instead of its traditional location in the second act); but the opportunity was also exploited by those who wanted to use the occasion as a veiled political protest against the pro-Austrian policies of Napoleon III.[81] It was during this visit that Wagner met the French poet Charles Baudelaire, who wrote an appreciative brochure, "".[82] The opera was withdrawn after the third performance and Wagner left Paris soon after.[83] He had sought a reconciliation with Minna during this Paris visit, and although she joined him there, the reunion was not successful and they again parted from each other when Wagner left.[84]

Return and resurgence (1862–1871)

The political ban that had been placed on Wagner in Germany after he had fled Dresden was fully lifted in 1862. The composer settled in Biebrich, on the Rhine near Wiesbaden in Hesse.[85] Here Minna visited him for the last time: they parted irrevocably,[86] though Wagner continued to give financial support to her while she lived in Dresden until her death in 1866.[87]

To one side a cushion holding a crown sits on a table.In Biebrich, Wagner at last began work on _Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg_, his only mature comedy. Wagner wrote a first draft of the libretto in 1845,[88] and he had resolved to develop it during a visit he had made to Venice with the Wesendoncks in 1860, where he was inspired by Titian's painting _The Assumption of the Virgin_.[89] Throughout this period (1861–64) Wagner sought to have _Tristan und Isolde_ produced in Vienna.[90] Despite numerous rehearsals, the opera remained unperformed, and gained a reputation as being "impossible" to sing, which added to Wagner's financial problems.[91]

Wagner's fortunes took a dramatic upturn in 1864, when King Ludwig II succeeded to the throne of Bavaria at the age of 18. The young king, an ardent admirer of Wagner's operas, had the composer brought to Munich.[92] The King, who was homosexual, expressed in his correspondence a passionate personal adoration for the composer,{{#tag:ref|E.g. "My dearest Beloved!", "My beloved, my most glorious Friend" and "O Holy One, I worship you".[93]|group=n}} and Wagner in his responses had no scruples about counterfeiting a similar atmosphere.[94]{{#tag:ref|Wagner excused himself in 1878, when discussing this correspondence with Cosima, by saying "The tone wasn't good, but I didn't set it."[95]|group=n}} Ludwig settled Wagner's considerable debts,[96] and proposed to stage _Tristan_, _Die Meistersinger_, the _Ring_, and the other operas Wagner planned.[97] Wagner also began to dictate his autobiography, _Mein Leben_, at the King's request.[98] Wagner noted that his rescue by Ludwig coincided with news of the death of his earlier mentor (but later supposed enemy) Giacomo Meyerbeer, and regretted that "this operatic master, who had done me so much harm, should not have lived to see this day."[99]

After grave difficulties in rehearsal, _Tristan und Isolde_ premiered at the National Theatre Munich on 10 June 1865, the first Wagner opera premiere in almost 15 years. (The premiere had been scheduled for 15 May, but was delayed by bailiffs acting for Wagner's creditors,[100] and also because the Isolde, Malvina Schnorr von Carolsfeld, was hoarse and needed time to recover.) The conductor of this premiere was Hans von Bülow, whose wife, Cosima, had given birth in April that year to a daughter, named Isolde, a child not of Bülow but of Wagner.[101]

Cosima was 24 years younger than Wagner and was herself illegitimate, the daughter of the Countess Marie d'Agoult, who had left her husband for Franz Liszt.[102] Liszt initially disapproved of his daughter's involvement with Wagner, though nevertheless, the two men were friends.[103] The indiscreet affair scandalised Munich, and Wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court, who were suspicious of his influence on the King.[104] In December 1865, Ludwig was finally forced to ask the composer to leave Munich.[105] He apparently also toyed with the idea of abdicating to follow his hero into exile, but Wagner quickly dissuaded him.[106]

Richard_and_Cosima_Wagner.jpgLudwig installed Wagner at the Villa Tribschen, beside Switzerland's Lake Lucerne.[107] _Die Meistersinger_ was completed at Tribschen in 1867, and premiered in Munich on 21 June the following year.[108] At Ludwig's insistence, "special previews" of the first two works of the _Ring_, _Das Rheingold_ and _Die Walküre_, were performed at Munich in 1869 and 1870,[109] but Wagner retained his dream, first expressed in "A Communication to My Friends", to present the first complete cycle at a special festival with a new, dedicated, opera house.[110]

Minna had died of a heart attack on 25 January 1866 in Dresden. Wagner did not attend the funeral.[111]{{#tag:ref|Wagner claimed to be unable to travel to the funeral due to an "inflamed finger".[112]|group=n}} Following Minna's death Cosima wrote to Hans von Bülow on a number of occasions asking him to grant her a divorce, but Bülow refused to concede this. He only consented after she had two more children with Wagner; another daughter, named Eva, after the heroine of _Meistersinger_, and a son Siegfried, named for the hero of the _Ring_. The divorce was finally sanctioned, after delays in the legal process, by a Berlin court on 18 July 1870.[113] Richard and Cosima's wedding took place on 25 August 1870.[114] On Christmas Day of that year, Wagner arranged a surprise performance (its premiere) of the _Siegfried Idyll_ for Cosima's birthday.[115]{{#tag:ref|Cosima's birthday was 24 December, but she usually celebrated it on Christmas Day.|group=n}} The marriage to Cosima lasted to the end of Wagner's life.

Wagner, settled into his new-found domesticity, turned his energies towards completing the _Ring_ cycle. He had not abandoned polemics: he republished his 1850 pamphlet "Judaism in Music", originally issued under a pseudonym, under his own name in 1869. He extended the introduction, and wrote a lengthy additional final section. The publication led to several public protests at early performances of _Die Meistersinger_ in Vienna and Mannheim.[116]

Bayreuth (1871–1876)

In 1871, Wagner decided to move to Bayreuth, which was to be the location of his new opera house.[117] The town council donated a large plot of land—the "Green Hill"—as a site for the theatre. The Wagners moved to the town the following year, and the foundation stone for the Bayreuth Festspielhaus ("Festival Theatre") was laid. Wagner initially announced the first Bayreuth Festival, at which for the first time the _Ring_ cycle would be presented complete, for 1873,[118] but since Ludwig had declined to finance the project, the start of building was delayed and the proposed date for the festival was deferred. To raise funds for the construction, "Wagner societies" were formed in several cities,[119] and Wagner began touring Germany conducting concerts.[120] By the spring of 1873, only a third of the required funds had been raised; further pleas to Ludwig were initially ignored, but early in 1874, with the project on the verge of collapse, the King relented and provided a loan.[121]{{#tag:ref|In 1873, the King awarded Wagner the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art; Wagner was enraged that, at the same time, the honour had been given also to Brahms.[122]|group=n}} The full building programme included the family home, "Wahnfried", into which Wagner, with Cosima and the children, moved from their temporary accommodation on 18 April 1874.[123] The theatre was completed in 1875, and the festival scheduled for the following year. Commenting on the struggle to finish the building, Wagner remarked to Cosima: "Each stone is red with my blood and yours".[124]

Festspielhaus_Bayreuth_1900.jpg: photochrom print of c. 1895]] For the design of the Festspielhaus, Wagner appropriated some of the ideas of his former colleague, Gottfried Semper, which he had previously solicited for a proposed new opera house at Munich.[125] Wagner was responsible for several theatrical innovations at Bayreuth; these include darkening the auditorium during performances, and placing the orchestra in a pit out of view of the audience.[126]

The Festspielhaus finally opened on 13 August 1876 with _Das Rheingold_, at last taking its place as the first evening of the complete _Ring_ cycle; the 1876 Bayreuth Festival therefore saw the premiere of the complete cycle, performed as a sequence as the composer had intended.[127] The 1876 Festival consisted of three full _Ring_ cycles (under the baton of Hans Richter).[128] At the end, critical reactions ranged between that of the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg, who thought the work "divinely composed", and that of the French newspaper _Le Figaro_, which called the music "the dream of a lunatic".[129] Amongst the disillusioned were Wagner's friend and disciple Friedrich Nietzsche, who, having published his eulogistic essay "Richard Wagner in Bayreuth" before the festival as part of his _Untimely Meditations_, was bitterly disappointed by what he saw as Wagner's pandering to increasingly exclusivist German nationalism; his breach with Wagner began at this time.[130] The festival firmly established Wagner as an artist of European, and indeed world, importance: attendees included Kaiser Wilhelm I, the Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, Anton Bruckner, Camille Saint-Saëns and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.[131]

Wagner was far from satisfied with the Festival; Cosima recorded that months later, his attitude towards the productions was "Never again, never again!"[132] Moreover, the festival finished with a deficit of about 150,000 marks.[133] The expenses of Bayreuth and of Wahnfried meant that Wagner still sought additional sources of income by conducting or taking on commissions such as the _Centennial March_ for America, for which he received $5000.[134]

Last years (1876–1883)

Following the first Bayreuth Festival, Wagner began work on _Parsifal_, his final opera. The composition took four years, much of which Wagner spent in Italy for health reasons.[135] From 1876 to 1878 Wagner also embarked on the last of his documented emotional liaisons, this time with Judith Gautier, whom he had met at the 1876 Festival.[136] Wagner was also much troubled by problems of financing _Parsifal_, and by the prospect of the work being performed by other theatres than Bayreuth. He was once again assisted by the liberality of King Ludwig, but was still forced by his personal financial situation in 1877 to sell the rights of several of his unpublished works (including the _Siegfried Idyll_) to the publisher Schott.[137]

WahnfriedBayreuth11.JPGWagner wrote a number of articles in his later years, often on political topics, and often reactionary in tone, repudiating some of his earlier, more liberal, views. These include "Religion and Art" (1880) and "Heroism and Christianity" (1881), which were printed in the journal _Bayreuther Blätter_, published by his supporter Hans von Wolzogen.[138] Wagner's sudden interest in Christianity at this period, which infuses _Parsifal_, was contemporary with his increasing alignment with German nationalism, and required on his part, and the part of his associates, "the rewriting of some recent Wagnerian history", so as to represent, for example, the _Ring_ as a work reflecting Christian ideals.[139] Many of these later articles, including "What is German?" (1878, but based on a draft written in the 1860s),[140] repeated Wagner's antisemitic preoccupations.

Wagner completed _Parsifal_ in January 1882, and a second Bayreuth Festival was held for the new opera, which premiered on 26 May.[141] Wagner was by this time extremely ill, having suffered a series of increasingly severe angina attacks.[142] During the sixteenth and final performance of _Parsifal_ on 29 August, he entered the pit unseen during act 3, took the baton from conductor Hermann Levi, and led the performance to its conclusion.[143]

After the festival, the Wagner family journeyed to Venice for the winter. Wagner died of a heart attack at the age of 69 on 13 February 1883 at Ca' Vendramin Calergi, a 16th-century palazzo on the Grand Canal.[144] The legend that the attack was prompted by argument with Cosima over Wagner's supposedly amorous interest in the singer Carrie Pringle, who had been a Flower-maiden in _Parsifal_ at Bayreuth, is without credible evidence.[145] After a funerary gondola bore Wagner's remains over the Grand Canal, his body was taken to Germany where it was buried in the garden of the Villa Wahnfried in Bayreuth.[146]


Works

Wagner's musical output is listed by the _Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis_ (WWV) as comprising 113 works, including fragments and projects.[147] The first complete scholarly edition of his musical works in print was commenced in 1970 under the aegis of the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts and the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur of Mainz, and is presently under the editorship of Egon Voss. It will consist of 21 volumes (57 books) of music and 10 volumes (13 books) of relevant documents and texts. As at October 2017, three volumes remain to be published. The publisher is Schott Music.[148]

Operas

Wagner's operatic works are his primary artistic legacy. Unlike most opera composers, who generally left the task of writing the libretto (the text and lyrics) to others, Wagner wrote his own libretti, which he referred to as "poems".[149]

From 1849 onwards, he urged a new concept of opera often referred to as "music drama" (although he later rejected this term),[150]{{#tag:ref|In his 1872 essay "On the Designation 'Music Drama{{'"}}, he criticises the term "music drama" suggesting instead the phrase "deeds of music made visible".[151]|group=n}} in which all musical, poetic and dramatic elements were to be fused together—the _Gesamtkunstwerk_. Wagner developed a compositional style in which the importance of the orchestra is equal to that of the singers. The orchestra's dramatic role in the later operas includes the use of leitmotifs, musical phrases that can be interpreted as announcing specific characters, locales, and plot elements; their complex interweaving and evolution illuminates the progression of the drama.[152] These operas are still, despite Wagner's reservations, referred to by many writers[153] as "music dramas".[154]

Early works (to 1842)

Wagner's earliest attempts at opera were often uncompleted. Abandoned works include a pastoral opera based on Goethe's _Die Laune des Verliebten_ (_The Infatuated Lover's Caprice_), written at the age of 17,[155] _Die Hochzeit_ (_The Wedding_), on which Wagner worked in 1832,[156] and the singspiel _Männerlist größer als Frauenlist_ (_Men are More Cunning than Women_, 1837–38). _Die Feen_ (_The Fairies_, 1833) was unperformed in the composer's lifetime[157] and _Das Liebesverbot_ (_The Ban on Love_, 1836) was withdrawn after its first performance.[158] _Rienzi_ (1842) was Wagner's first opera to be successfully staged.[159] The compositional style of these early works was conventional—the relatively more sophisticated _Rienzi_ showing the clear influence of Grand Opera _à la_ Spontini and Meyerbeer—and did not exhibit the innovations that would mark Wagner's place in musical history. Later in life, Wagner said that he did not consider these works to be part of his _oeuvre_;[160] and they have been performed only rarely in the last hundred years, although the overture to _Rienzi_ is an occasional concert-hall piece. _Die Feen_, _Das Liebesverbot_, and _Rienzi_ were performed at both Leipzig and Bayreuth in 2013 to mark the composer's bicentenary.[161]

"Romantic operas" (1843–51)

Der_fliegende_Holländer.jpg Wagner's middle stage output began with _Der fliegende Holländer_ (_The Flying Dutchman_, 1843), followed by _Tannhäuser_ (1845) and _Lohengrin_ (1850). These three operas are sometimes referred to as Wagner's "romantic operas".[162] They reinforced the reputation, among the public in Germany and beyond, that Wagner had begun to establish with _Rienzi_. Although distancing himself from the style of these operas from 1849 onwards, he nevertheless reworked both _Der fliegende Holländer_ and _Tannhäuser_ on several occasions.{{#tag:ref|For the reworking of _Der fliegende Holländer_, see Deathridge (1982) 13, 25; for that of _Tannhäuser_, see Millington (2001) 280–2, which further cites Wagner's comment to Cosima three weeks before his death that he "still owes the world _Tannhäuser_."[163] See also the articles on these operas in Wikipedia.|group=n}} These three operas are considered to represent a significant developmental stage in Wagner's musical and operatic maturity as regards thematic handling, portrayal of emotions and orchestration.[164] They are the earliest works included in the Bayreuth canon, the mature operas that Cosima staged at the Bayreuth Festival after Wagner's death in accordance with his wishes.[165] All three (including the differing versions of _Der fliegende Holländer_ and _Tannhäuser_) continue to be regularly performed throughout the world, and have been frequently recorded.{{#tag:ref|See performance listings by opera in Operabase, and the Wikipedia articles The Flying Dutchman discography, Tannhäuser discography and Lohengrin discography.|group=n}} They were also the operas by which his fame spread during his lifetime.{{#tag:ref|For example, _Der fliegende Holländer_ (_Dutchman_) was first performed in London in 1870 and in the US (Philadelphia) in 1876; _Tannhäuser_ in New York in 1859 and in London in 1876; _Lohengrin_ in New York in 1871 and London in 1875.[166] For detailed performance histories including other countries, see Stanford University Wagner site, under each opera.|group=n}}

"Music dramas" (1851–82)

Starting the _Ring_

Ring22.jpg the Valkyrie, as illustrated by Arthur Rackham (1910)|alt=A youthful valkyrie, wearing armour, cloak and winged helmet and holding a spear, stands with one foot on a rock and looks intently towards the right foreground. In the background are trees and mountains.]]

Wagner's late dramas are considered his masterpieces. _Der Ring des Nibelungen_, commonly referred to as the _Ring_ or "_Ring_ cycle", is a set of four operas based loosely on figures and elements of Germanic mythology—particularly from the later Norse mythology—notably the Old Norse _Poetic Edda_ and _Volsunga Saga_, and the Middle High German _Nibelungenlied_.[167] Wagner specifically developed the libretti for these operas according to his interpretation of _Stabreim_, highly alliterative rhyming verse-pairs used in old Germanic poetry.[168] They were also influenced by Wagner's concepts of ancient Greek drama, in which tetralogies were a component of Athenian festivals, and which he had amply discussed in his essay "Oper und Drama".[169]

The first two components of the _Ring_ cycle were _Das Rheingold_ (_The Rhinegold_), which was completed in 1854, and _Die Walküre_ (_The Valkyrie_), which was finished in 1856. In _Das Rheingold_, with its "relentlessly talky 'realism' [and] the absence of lyrical 'numbers{{'"}},[170] Wagner came very close to the musical ideals of his 1849–51 essays. _Die Walküre_, which contains what is virtually a traditional aria (Siegmund's _Winterstürme_ in the first act), and the quasi-choral appearance of the Valkyries themselves, shows more "operatic" traits, but has been assessed by Barry Millington as "the music drama that most satisfactorily embodies the theoretical principles of 'Oper und Drama'... A thoroughgoing synthesis of poetry and music is achieved without any notable sacrifice in musical expression."[171]

_Tristan und Isolde_ and _Die Meistersinger_

While composing the opera _Siegfried_, the third part of the _Ring_ cycle, Wagner interrupted work on it and between 1857 and 1864 wrote the tragic love story _Tristan und Isolde_ and his only mature comedy _Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg_ (_The Mastersingers of Nuremberg_), two works that are also part of the regular operatic canon.[172]

Betz_Franz.png, who created the role of Hans Sachs in _Die Meistersinger_, and sang Wotan in the first complete _Ring_ cycle|alt= A photograph of a bearded white man with male-pattern baldness wearing glasses]]_Tristan_ is often granted a special place in musical history; many see it as the beginning of the move away from conventional harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the 20th century.[173][174][175] Wagner felt that his musico-dramatical theories were most perfectly realised in this work with its use of "the art of transition" between dramatic elements and the balance achieved between vocal and orchestral lines.[176] Completed in 1859, the work was given its first performance in Munich, conducted by Bülow, in June 1865.[177]

_Die Meistersinger_ was originally conceived by Wagner in 1845 as a sort of comic pendant to _Tannhäuser_.[178] Like _Tristan_, it was premiered in Munich under the baton of Bülow, on 21 June 1868, and became an immediate success.[179] Barry Millington describes _Meistersinger_ as "a rich, perceptive music drama widely admired for its warm humanity";[180] but because of its strong German nationalist overtones, it is also cited by some as an example of Wagner's reactionary politics and antisemitism.[181]

Completing the _Ring_

When Wagner returned to writing the music for the last act of _Siegfried_ and for _Götterdämmerung_ (_Twilight of the Gods_), as the final part of the _Ring_, his style had changed once more to something more recognisable as "operatic" than the aural world of _Rheingold_ and _Walküre_, though it was still thoroughly stamped with his own originality as a composer and suffused with leitmotifs.[182] This was in part because the libretti of the four _Ring_ operas had been written in reverse order, so that the book for _Götterdämmerung_ was conceived more "traditionally" than that of _Rheingold_;[183] still, the self-imposed strictures of the _Gesamtkunstwerk_ had become relaxed. The differences also result from Wagner's development as a composer during the period in which he wrote _Tristan_, _Meistersinger_ and the Paris version of _Tannhäuser_.[184] From act 3 of _Siegfried_ onwards, the _Ring_ becomes more chromatic melodically, more complex harmonically and more developmental in its treatment of leitmotifs.[185]

Wagner took 26 years from writing the first draft of a libretto in 1848 until he completed _Götterdämmerung_ in 1874. The _Ring_ takes about 15 hours to perform[186] and is the only undertaking of such size to be regularly presented on the world's stages.

_Parsifal_

Wagner's final opera, _Parsifal_ (1882), which was his only work written especially for his Bayreuth Festspielhaus and which is described in the score as a "_Bühnenweihfestspiel_" ("festival play for the consecration of the stage"), has a storyline suggested by elements of the legend of the Holy Grail. It also carries elements of Buddhist renunciation suggested by Wagner's readings of Schopenhauer.[187] Wagner described it to Cosima as his "last card".[188] It remains controversial because of its treatment of Christianity, its eroticism, and its expression, as perceived by some commentators, of German nationalism and antisemitism.[189] Despite the composer's own description of the opera to King Ludwig as "this most Christian of works",[190] Ulrike Kienzle has commented that "Wagner's turn to Christian mythology, upon which the imagery and spiritual contents of _Parsifal_ rest, is idiosyncratic and contradicts Christian dogma in many ways."[191] Musically the opera has been held to represent a continuing development of the composer's style, and Barry Millington describes it as "a diaphanous score of unearthly beauty and refinement".[192]

Non-operatic music

The figure is hammering the sharp end of a crochet symbol into the inner part of the ear and blood pours out.]]

Apart from his operas, Wagner composed relatively few pieces of music. These include a symphony in C major (written at the age of 19), the _Faust Overture_ (the only completed part of an intended symphony on the subject), some concert overtures, and choral and piano pieces.[193] His most commonly performed work that is not an extract from an opera is the _Siegfried Idyll_ for chamber orchestra, which has several motifs in common with the _Ring_ cycle.[194] The _Wesendonck Lieder_ are also often performed, either in the original piano version, or with orchestral accompaniment.{{#tag:ref|Normally the orchestration by Felix Mottl is used (score available at IMSLP website), although Wagner arranged one of the songs for chamber orchestra.[195]|group=n}} More rarely performed are the _American Centennial March_ (1876), and _Das Liebesmahl der Apostel_ (_The Love Feast of the Apostles_), a piece for male choruses and orchestra composed in 1843 for the city of Dresden.[196]

After completing _Parsifal_, Wagner expressed his intention to turn to the writing of symphonies,[197] and several sketches dating from the late 1870s and early 1880s have been identified as work towards this end.[198] The overtures and certain orchestral passages from Wagner's middle and late-stage operas are commonly played as concert pieces. For most of these, Wagner wrote or rewrote short passages to ensure musical coherence. The "Bridal Chorus" from _Lohengrin_ is frequently played as the bride's processional wedding march in English-speaking countries.[199]

Prose writings

Wagner was an extremely prolific writer, authoring numerous books, poems, and articles, as well as voluminous correspondence. His writings covered a wide range of topics, including autobiography, politics, philosophy, and detailed analyses of his own operas.

Wagner planned for a collected edition of his publications as early as 1865;[200] he believed that such an edition would help the world understand his intellectual development and artistic aims.[201] The first such edition was published between 1871 and 1883, but was doctored to suppress or alter articles that were an embarrassment to him (e.g. those praising Meyerbeer), or by altering dates on some articles to reinforce Wagner's own account of his progress.[202] Wagner's autobiography _Mein Leben_ was originally published for close friends only in a very small edition (15–18 copies per volume) in four volumes between 1870 and 1880. The first public edition (with many passages suppressed by Cosima) appeared in 1911; the first attempt at a full edition (in German) appeared in 1963.[203]

There have been modern complete or partial editions of Wagner's writings,[204] including a centennial edition in German edited by Dieter Borchmeyer (which, however, omitted the essay "Das Judenthum in der Musik" and _Mein Leben_).[205] The English translations of Wagner's prose in eight volumes by W. Ashton Ellis (1892–99) are still in print and commonly used, despite their deficiencies.[206] The first complete historical and critical edition of Wagner's prose works was launched in 2013 at the Institute for Music Research at the University of Würzburg; this will result in 16 volumes (eight of text and eight of commentary) totalling approximately 5,300 pages. It is anticipated that the project will be completed by 2030.[207]

A complete edition of Wagner's correspondence, estimated to amount to between 10,000 and 12,000 items, is under way under the supervision of the University of Würzburg. As of October 2017, 23 volumes have appeared, covering the period to 1873.[208]


Influence and legacy

Influence on music

Wagner's later musical style introduced new ideas in harmony, melodic process (leitmotif) and operatic structure. Notably from _Tristan und Isolde_ onwards, he explored the limits of the traditional tonal system, which gave keys and chords their identity, pointing the way to atonality in the 20th century. Some music historians date the beginning of modern classical music to the first notes of _Tristan_, which include the so-called Tristan chord.[209][210]

Photo_of_Gustav_Mahler_by_Moritz_Nähr_01.jpgWagner inspired great devotion. For a long period, many composers were inclined to align themselves with or against Wagner's music. Anton Bruckner and Hugo Wolf were greatly indebted to him, as were César Franck, Henri Duparc, Ernest Chausson, Jules Massenet, Richard Strauss, Alexander von Zemlinsky, Hans Pfitzner and numerous others.[211] Gustav Mahler was devoted to Wagner and his music; aged 15, he sought him out on his 1875 visit to Vienna,[212] became a renowned Wagner conductor,[213] and his compositions are seen by Richard Taruskin as extending Wagner's "maximalization" of "the temporal and the sonorous" in music to the world of the symphony.[214] The harmonic revolutions of Claude Debussy and Arnold Schoenberg (both of whose _oeuvres_ contain examples of tonal and atonal modernism) have often been traced back to _Tristan_ and _Parsifal_.[215] The Italian form of operatic realism known as verismo owed much to the Wagnerian concept of musical form.[216]

Wagner made a major contribution to the principles and practice of conducting. His essay "About Conducting" (1869)[217] advanced Hector Berlioz's technique of conducting and claimed that conducting was a means by which a musical work could be re-interpreted, rather than simply a mechanism for achieving orchestral unison. He exemplified this approach in his own conducting, which was significantly more flexible than the disciplined approach of Felix Mendelssohn; in his view this also justified practices that would today be frowned upon, such as the rewriting of scores.[218]{{#tag:ref|See for example Wagner's proposals for the rescoring of Beethoven's _Ninth Symphony_ in his essay on that work.[219]|group=n}} Wilhelm Furtwängler felt that Wagner and Bülow, through their interpretative approach, inspired a whole new generation of conductors (including Furtwängler himself).[220]

Amongst those claiming inspiration from Wagner's music are the German band Rammstein,[221] and the electronic composer Klaus Schulze, whose 1975 album _Timewind_ consists of two 30-minute tracks, _Bayreuth Return_ and _Wahnfried 1883_. Joey DeMaio of the band Manowar has described Wagner as "The father of heavy metal".[222] The Slovenian group Laibach created the 2009 suite _VolksWagner_, using material from Wagner's operas.[223] Phil Spector's Wall of Sound recording technique was, it has been claimed, heavily influenced by Wagner.[224]

Influence on literature, philosophy and the visual arts

Nietzsche1882.jpgWagner's influence on literature and philosophy is significant. Millington has commented:

  [Wagner's] protean abundance meant that he could inspire the use of literary motif in many a novel employing interior monologue; ... the Symbolists saw him as a mystic hierophant; the Decadents found many a frisson in his work.[225]

Friedrich Nietzsche was a member of Wagner's inner circle during the early 1870s, and his first published work, _The Birth of Tragedy_, proposed Wagner's music as the Dionysian "rebirth" of European culture in opposition to Apollonian rationalist "decadence". Nietzsche broke with Wagner following the first Bayreuth Festival, believing that Wagner's final phase represented a pandering to Christian pieties and a surrender to the new German Reich. Nietzsche expressed his displeasure with the later Wagner in "The Case of Wagner" and "Nietzsche contra Wagner".[226]

The poets Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Verlaine worshipped Wagner.[227] Édouard Dujardin, whose influential novel _Les Lauriers sont coupés_ is in the form of an interior monologue inspired by Wagnerian music, founded a journal dedicated to Wagner, _La Revue Wagnérienne_, to which J. K. Huysmans and Téodor de Wyzewa contributed.[228] In a list of major cultural figures influenced by Wagner, Bryan Magee includes D. H. Lawrence, Aubrey Beardsley, Romain Rolland, Gérard de Nerval, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Rainer Maria Rilke and numerous others.[229]

1908_v._Werner_Enthuellung_Richard-Wagner-Denkmal_Tiergarten_anagoria.JPG, Berlin (1908); painting by Anton von Werner]] In the 20th century, W. H. Auden once called Wagner "perhaps the greatest genius that ever lived",[230] while Thomas Mann[231] and Marcel Proust[232] were heavily influenced by him and discussed Wagner in their novels. He is also discussed in some of the works of James Joyce.[233] Wagnerian themes inhabit T. S. Eliot's _The Waste Land_, which contains lines from _Tristan und Isolde_ and _Götterdämmerung_, and Verlaine's poem on _Parsifal_.[234]

Many of Wagner's concepts, including his speculation about dreams, predated their investigation by Sigmund Freud.[235] Wagner had publicly analysed the Oedipus myth before Freud was born in terms of its psychological significance, insisting that incestuous desires are natural and normal, and perceptively exhibiting the relationship between sexuality and anxiety.[236] Georg Groddeck considered the _Ring_ as the first manual of psychoanalysis.[237]

Influence on cinema

Wagner's concept of the use of leitmotifs and the integrated musical expression which they can enable has influenced many 20th and 21st century film scores. The critic Theodor Adorno has noted that the Wagnerian leitmotif "leads directly to cinema music where the sole function of the leitmotif is to announce heroes or situations so as to allow the audience to orient itself more easily".[238] Amongst film scores citing Wagnerian themes are Francis Ford Coppola's _Apocalypse Now_, which features a version of the _Ride of the Valkyries_, Trevor Jones's soundtrack to John Boorman's film _Excalibur_,[239] and the 2011 films _A Dangerous Method_ (dir. David Cronenberg) and _Melancholia_ (dir. Lars von Trier).[240] Hans-Jürgen Syberberg's 1977 film _Hitler: A Film from Germany_'s visual style and set design are strongly inspired by _Der Ring des Nibelungen_, musical excerpts from which are frequently used in the film's soundtrack.[241]

Opponents and supporters

Hanslick.jpgNot all reaction to Wagner was positive. For a time, German musical life divided into two factions, supporters of Wagner and supporters of Johannes Brahms; the latter, with the support of the powerful critic Eduard Hanslick (of whom Beckmesser in _Meistersinger_ is in part a caricature) championed traditional forms and led the conservative front against Wagnerian innovations.[242] They were supported by the conservative leanings of some German music schools, including the conservatories at Leipzig under Ignaz Moscheles and at Cologne under the direction of Ferdinand Hiller.[243] Another Wagner detractor was the French composer Charles-Valentin Alkan, who wrote to Hiller after attending Wagner's Paris concert on 25 January 1860 at which Wagner conducted the overtures to _Der fliegende Holländer_ and _Tannhäuser_, the preludes to _Lohengrin_ and _Tristan und Isolde_, and six other extracts from _Tannhäuser_ and _Lohengrin_: "I had imagined that I was going to meet music of an innovative kind but was astonished to find a pale imitation of Berlioz ... I do not like all the music of Berlioz while appreciating his marvellous understanding of certain instrumental effects ... but here he was imitated and caricatured ... Wagner is not a musician, he is a disease."[244]

Even those who, like Debussy, opposed Wagner ("this old poisoner")[245] could not deny his influence. Indeed, Debussy was one of many composers, including Tchaikovsky, who felt the need to break with Wagner precisely because his influence was so unmistakable and overwhelming. "Golliwogg's Cakewalk" from Debussy's _Children's Corner_ piano suite contains a deliberately tongue-in-cheek quotation from the opening bars of _Tristan_.[246] Others who proved resistant to Wagner's operas included Gioachino Rossini, who said "Wagner has wonderful moments, and dreadful quarters of an hour."[247] In the 20th century Wagner's music was parodied by Paul Hindemith{{#tag:ref|See _Overture to the Flying Dutchman as Sight-read by a Bad Spa Orchestra at 7 in the Morning by the Well_|group=n}} and Hanns Eisler, among others.[248]

Wagner's followers (known as Wagnerians or Wagnerites)[249] have formed many societies dedicated to Wagner's life and work.[250]

Film and stage portrayals

Wagner has been the subject of many biographical films. The earliest was a silent film made by Carl Froelich in 1913 and featured in the title role the composer Giuseppe Becce, who also wrote the score for the film (as Wagner's music, still in copyright, was not available).[251] Amongst other film portrayals of Wagner are: Alan Badel in _Magic Fire_ (1955); Lyndon Brook in _Song Without End_ (1960); Trevor Howard in _Ludwig_ (1972); Paul Nicholas in _Lisztomania_ (1975); and Richard Burton in _Wagner_ (1983).[252]

Jonathan Harvey's opera _Wagner Dream_ (2007) intertwines the events surrounding Wagner's death with the story of Wagner's uncompleted opera outline _Die Sieger (The Victors)_.[253]

Bayreuth Festival

Since Wagner's death, the Bayreuth Festival, which has become an annual event, has been successively directed by his widow, his son Siegfried, the latter's widow Winifred Wagner, their two sons Wieland and Wolfgang Wagner, and, presently, two of the composer's great-granddaughters, Eva Wagner-Pasquier and Katharina Wagner.[254] Since 1973, the festival has been overseen by the Richard-Wagner-Stiftung (Richard Wagner Foundation), the members of which include a number of Wagner's descendants.[255]


Controversies

Wagner's operas, writings, politics, beliefs and unorthodox lifestyle made him a controversial figure during his lifetime.[256] Following his death, debate about his ideas and their interpretation, particularly in Germany during the 20th century, has continued.

Racism and antisemitism

Wagnerclic.jpg

Wagner's writings on Jews, including _Jewishness in Music_, corresponded to some existing trends of thought in Germany during the 19th century;[257] however, despite his very public views on these themes, throughout his life Wagner had Jewish friends, colleagues and supporters.[258] There have been frequent suggestions that antisemitic stereotypes are represented in Wagner's operas. The characters of Mime in the _Ring_, Sixtus Beckmesser in _Die Meistersinger,_ and Klingsor in _Parsifal_ are sometimes claimed as Jewish representations, though they are not identified as such in the librettos of these operas.[259]{{#tag:ref|Weiner (1997) gives very detailed allegations of antisemitism in Wagner's music and characterisations.|group=n}} The topic of Wagner and the Jews is further complicated by allegations, which may have been credited by Wagner, that he himself was of Jewish ancestry, via his supposed father Geyer.[260]

Some biographers have noted that Wagner in his final years developed interest in the racialist philosophy of Arthur de Gobineau, notably Gobineau's belief that Western society was doomed because of miscegenation between "superior" and "inferior" races.[261] According to Robert Gutman, this theme is reflected in the opera _Parsifal_.[262] Other biographers (such as Lucy Beckett) believe that this is not true, as the original drafts of the story date back to 1857 and Wagner had completed the libretto for _Parsifal_ by 1877;[263] but he displayed no significant interest in Gobineau until 1880.[264]

Other interpretations

Wagner's ideas are amenable to socialist interpretations; many of his ideas on art were being formulated at the time of his revolutionary inclinations in the 1840s. Thus, for example, George Bernard Shaw wrote in _The Perfect Wagnerite_ (1883):

  [Wagner's] picture of Niblunghome{{#tag:ref|Shaw's anglicization of _Nibelheim_, the empire of Alberich in the _Ring_ cycle.|group=n}} under the reign of Alberic is a poetic vision of unregulated industrial capitalism as it was made known in Germany in the middle of the 19th century by Engels's book _The Condition of the Working Class in England_.[265]

Left-wing interpretations of Wagner also inform the writings of Theodor Adorno among other Wagner critics.{{#tag:ref|See Žižek (2009) viii: "[In this book] for the first time the Marxist reading of a musical work of art ... was combined with the highest musicological analysis."|group=n}} Walter Benjamin gave Wagner as an example of "bourgeois false consciousness", alienating art from its social context.[266]

The writer Robert Donington has produced a detailed, if controversial, Jungian interpretation of the _Ring_ cycle, described as "an approach to Wagner by way of his symbols", which, for example, sees the character of the goddess Fricka as part of her husband Wotan's "inner femininity".[267] Millington notes that Jean-Jacques Nattiez has also applied psychoanalytical techniques in an evaluation of Wagner's life and works.[268]

Nazi appropriation

Adolf Hitler was an admirer of Wagner's music and saw in his operas an embodiment of his own vision of the German nation; in a 1922 speech he claimed that Wagner's works glorified "the heroic Teutonic nature ... Greatness lies in the heroic."[269] Hitler visited Bayreuth frequently from 1923 onwards and attended the productions at the theatre.[270] There continues to be debate about the extent to which Wagner's views might have influenced Nazi thinking.{{#tag:ref|The claim that Hitler, in his maturity, commented that "it [i.e. his political career] all began" after seeing a performance of _Rienzi_ in his youth, has been disproved.[271]|group=n}} Houston Stewart Chamberlain (1855–1927), who married Wagner's daughter Eva in 1908 but never met Wagner, was the author of the racist book _The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century_, approved by the Nazi movement.[272] Chamberlain met Hitler on a number of occasions between 1923 and 1927 in Bayreuth, but cannot credibly be regarded as a conduit of Wagner's own views.[273] The Nazis used those parts of Wagner's thought that were useful for propaganda and ignored or suppressed the rest.[274]

While Bayreuth presented a useful front for Nazi culture, and Wagner's music was used at many Nazi events,[275] the Nazi hierarchy as a whole did not share Hitler's enthusiasm for Wagner's operas and resented attending these lengthy epics at Hitler's insistence.[276]

Guido Fackler has researched evidence that indicates that it is possible that Wagner's music was used at the Dachau concentration camp in 1933–34 to "reeducate" political prisoners by exposure to "national music".[277] There has been no evidence to support claims, sometimes made,[278] that his music was played at Nazi death camps during the Second World War, and Pamela Potter has noted that Wagner's music was explicitly off-limits in the camps.{{#tag:ref|See e.g. John (2004) for a detailed essay on music in the Nazi death camps, which nowhere mentions Wagner. See also Potter (2008) 244: "We know from testimonies that concentration camp orchestras played [all sorts of] music ... but that Wagner was explicitly off-limits. However, after the war, unsubstantiated claims that Wagner's music accompanied Jews to their death took on momentum."|group=n}}

Because of the associations of Wagner with antisemitism and Nazism, the performance of his music in the State of Israel has been a source of controversy.[279]
