_BRENTWOOD STRANGLER_ is a 2015 award-winning holiday-themed horror short film. It was written and directed by John Fitzpatrick following the success of his first short _Skypemare_, and stars 'scream queen' Jordan Ladd and Australian actor Adam J. Yeend in the title role. The film premiered December 2015 at the A Night of Horror Film Festival in Sydney, Australia,[1] and had its U.S. premiere in early 2016 at the Hollywood Reel Independent Film Festival in Los Angeles where it won the jury award for Best Genre Short.[2] The film has received critical acclaim from the independent horror community with multiple online reviews citing Fitzpatrick's writing, and the chemistry between the two leads.[3] The film has screened at multiple festivals and horror conventions around the world including Shriekfest, Horrible Imaginings Film Festival, FilmQuest, and at Phoenix Comicon where it won the audience award for 'Best Horror'.[4] The producing team went on to make the popular online series _Scary Endings_ which is currently in its second season.


Plot

It's the Christmas season in Los Angeles; Maggie (Jordan Ladd), a lonely woman goes on a blind date with a man unbeknownst to her that her date has been replaced by an active and notorious serial killer, The Brentwood Strangler (Adam J. Yeend). Is it love at first sight or is Maggie in for the worst (and last) date of her life?


Production

The film was financed by Far From Everything Films and shot on location in Camarillo, California not only for cheaper studio rental but because street locations could be made to look similar to that of Brentwood, Los Angeles. Writer, Director John Fitzpatrick said in making the film he wanted to turn "back the clock to the days of Michael Curtiz, Billy Wilder and Alfred Hitchcock." [5] Producer / Actor Adam J. Yeend was cast first in the role of the Strangler but asked to audition by Fitzpatrick followed by Jordan Ladd being cast in the lead role following an introduction from _Skypemare_ actress Cerina Vincent; the two had worked together previously on _Cabin Fever_.[6] Actress Annika Marks was asked to reprise her _Skypemare_ role as Jenna and cameos along with producer Ryan Dillon reprising his role as Steve. Australian actors Cameron Daddo and Roxane Wilson also have cameo roles as news reporters. Maximilian Osinski was the final lead to be cast, a friend of Yeend's, Fitzpatrick felt the audience would buy that based off a single photo, it'd make sense for Maggie to confuse the two men in the story.
