BOBBY THEODORE is a Canadian screenwriter, playwright and translator. He has worked mainly in television and theatre, and is most known for his translation of François Archambault's _15 Seconds_, for which he was nominated for a Governor General's Award in 2000.[1] In 2016 he is the host of the Glassco Translation Residency in Tadoussac, a retreat that allows playwrights, translators and adaptors from across Canada to develop their projects and exchange ideas with each other.[2] Theodore currently lives in Toronto's annex.[3]


Early life

Theodore was born in Montreal, Quebec, and speaks and writes in both French and English. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Concordia University in 1994. He graduated from the National Theatre School of Canada's playwright program in 1998.[4] He also completed the Bell Media Prime Time TV Program at the Canadian Film Centre in 2005.[5]


Career

Theodore worked as a writer and story editor on a number of Canadian television shows, including _Instant Star_ (2006), _Murdoch Mysteries_ (2008), _Cra$h and Burn_ (2009), and _Flashpoint_ (2010-2011). He also wrote for children's television shows, including the French Canadian animated series, _Willa's Wild Life_ (2008). In addition, Theodore has written for CBC's radio drama, _Afghanada_, a Canadian's view of the war in Afghanistan.[6]

Theodore spends most of his time working in live theatre, where he has translated over 20 plays from French to English. Theodore participated in the 2013 Playwrights Retreat;[7] he has said that developing friendly relationships with playwrights whose work he translates helps him to understand and connect with their work.[8] As a result, he has a professional relationship with playwright François Archambault, and has translated three of his most well known works: _15 Seconds_ premiered at the ATP playWrites Festival in Calgary in 1999;[9] _The Leisure Society_ played at the Trafalgar Studios in New York in 2012;[10] and Tarragon Theatre has produced _You Will Remember Me_ in 2016.[11] He has also translated the works of Quebec playwrights Geneviève Billette and Nathalie Boisvert.

Along with Ame Henderson, a Canadian choreographer, Theodore has helped create a theatre performance called _300 Tapes_, which premiered at the Theatre Centre in Toronto and at ATP in Calgary. The piece consists of a collection of 100 memories recorded on 100 mini cassette tapes, performed by three actors enlisted by Henderson and Theodore.[12]
