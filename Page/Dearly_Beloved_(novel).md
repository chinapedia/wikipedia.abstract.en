Reception

The book sold more than 100,000 copies and was on the _New York Times_ Best Seller list for nearly 30 weeks.[2] _Kirkus Reviews_ wrote: "It is a sensitive—at times a tragic—book, penetrating the depths of men's and women's souls, as line after line of the service is spoken, with its meaning enlarged, heightened by the lives of the listeners. ... The composite that emerges is a many hued tapestry, almost flawless in projection and performance."[3]
