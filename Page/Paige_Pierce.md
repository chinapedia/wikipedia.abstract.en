PAIGE PIERCE, from Plano, Texas, is the number one ranked and rated female professional disc golfer in the world. She is a four-time World Champion, and has been consistently ranked in the top four professional women between 2011 and 2018. In 2018 she achieved the highest player rating a woman has ever had at 978. [1]

Pierce began playing disc golf at the age of 4 with her father and his friends. She went professional in 2009 and started touring in 2010.

After winning the US Women's Disc Golf Championship in 2014, Pierce made history by becoming the first female to ever win the USDGC Performance Flight division.[2] She narrowly missed qualifying for the Open division in 2015, missing a playoff for the fifth qualifying spot by two strokes. In 2017 at the first major championship of the year, The Aussie Open, she shot amongst the top 10 scores of all divisions earning her a coveted qualification for the Open Flight of the USDGC. In 2018 she once again earned a qualifying spot when she won the United States Women's Disc Golf Championship. [3]


Professional career

In addition to Pierce's four World Championships, she also holds two Mixed Doubles World Championships, both with Jeremy Koling.[4]
