_APTENOPERISSUS_ is a genus of extinct wasp with eight described species, placed into the monotypic family APTENOPERISSIDAE. The type species _APTENOPERISSUS BURMANICUS_ resembles a mix between a grasshopper, an ant, and a wasp. It was described by a group of researchers from Oregon State University in a paper released online in October 2016.[1] The piece of 100 million year old amber that it was preserved in was found in the Hukawng Valley of Myanmar in Southern Asia. A new family, Aptenoperissidae, was described to accommodate this insect. Aptenoperissus had a strong stinger for defense against predators and to stab grubs for its food. The creature had long legs making it perfect for jumping higher than most insects.[2] Subsequently additional species were described from the Myanmar amber: _A. amabilis_, _A. delicatus_, _A. formosus_,[3] _A. etius_, _A. magnifemoris_, _A. pusillus_[4] and _A. zonalis_.[5]
