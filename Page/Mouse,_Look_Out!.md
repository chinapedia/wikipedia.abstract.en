_MOUSE, LOOK OUT!_ is a 1998 children's picture book by Judy Waite and Norma Burgin. It is about a mouse being stalked by a cat.


Plot summary

In an isolated, abandoned cottage with "Danger Keep Out" on the wall, a brown mouse scampers around, at first unaware of being watched and followed by a stealthy black cat. The cat is also being watched, however, and is at last startled into running away.


Reception

_Booklist_ wrote "Prereaders can easily grasp the plot just by looking at the wonderfully detailed pictures, but this entertaining, interactive story begs to be read aloud."[1] and the _School Library Journal_ wrote "Beautiful artwork with some double-page spreads show a spooky English cottage filled with interesting junk. Young audiences will never tire of finding the cat in each picture and joining in the refrain, "MOUSE, LOOK OUT!/THERE'S A CAT ABOUT.""[2]

_Kirkus Reviews_ described it as "A tale of mild suspense." and "Waite's story is sweet but negligible; what will keep readers flipping the pages is Burgin's tour of the deserted house--the artwork naturalistic and detailed--and the menacing cat lurking in the shadows, all stealth and determination."[3] _Publishers Weekly_ found it a "taut tale"[4] and the English Association called it "a perfect partnership of text and illustration."[5] It has also been review by _Reading Time_[6] and the ''Teacher Magazine]][7]
