Lee_Art_Theater.jpg The LEE ART THEATER was an adult film theater located on 934 W Grace Street, Richmond, Virginia, United States, that ran from 1965-1993. It is known as Richmond's first adult theater, and featured burlesque dancers in its later years.[1] The theater closed in 1993, was bought and reopened by Virginia Commonwealth University, was renamed the Grace Street Theater, and is now used for the Universities Dance program.


Opening

The theater, originally the Lee Theater, named after the Confederate general Robert E. Lee, opened on October 13th, 1935.[2] The opening night program it stated it was built "in anticipation of scientific entertainment, miracles of the present and future, talking pictures, and other developments, [that] future generations will know and enjoy." The first showing was of _China Seas_. At this time it was a second-run movie theater that showed family-oriented MGM movies.[3]

In 1963 the Lee Theater closed. Its final showing was _Carry On Teacher_.[4]


Opening as an art house

The theater was remodeled and reopened as the Lee Art Theater in September 1965. It opened with the intention of being an art house, showing mostly foreign films. A personal account explains the Lee Art Theater's marketing as stating, "The programmer was clearly targeting couples with a guilty pleasure as bait but offering a respectable or even critically acclaimed title to validate their attendance."[5] The theater used adult programs as a way to keep people interested in the art house.


Richmond's first porn theater

Without the public desire for foreign films, the theater soon began playing soft-core porn movies such as _The Girl From S.I.N_ and _Olga's Dance Hall Girls_.[6]The theater even played the huge hit _Deep Throat_, which helped launch the porn chic movement of the 1970s. Lines formed around the block for the showings of this film.[7] By 1971, it was calling itself "Richmond's first adult theater", and in 1975 it added burlesque dancers.[8]


_Lee Art Theater, Inc v. Virginia_

Several films were confiscated from the Lee Art Theater by the Richmond police department for obscenity, one of which was _Angelique in Black Leather_.[9] These movies were taken in violation of Title 18.1-228 Code of Virginia. They were taken without a warrant, and the theater took the case to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia, where the case was refused. The case was then brought to the Supreme Court and on June 17th, 1968 the films were determined to have been taken unconstitutionally.[10]


Grace Street Theater

After the Supreme Court case, the Lee Art Theater continued to run as an adult theater until it closed in 1993. With the rise of home videos, the need for an adult theater decreased. The theater was then bought by Virginia Commonwealth University and remodeled. In February 1996 the theater reopened, was renamed the Grace Street Theater, and is currently still in use for the university's dance program.[11]
