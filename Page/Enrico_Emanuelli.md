ENRICO EMANUELLI (17 April 1909 - 1 July 1967) was an Italian novelist, essayist and journalist.

Born in Novara into a wealthy family, after the primary school Emanuelli studied as an autodidact. In 1928 he co-founded, with Mario Soldati and Mario Bonfantini, the literary prestigious magazine _La Libra_ (1928-1930). The same year he made his novel debut with _Memolo, ovvero vita, morte e miracoli di un uomo_, which got him critical comparisons to Ugo Foscolo and Giacomo Leopardi.[1]

In 1929 Emanuelli started his journalistic career, collaborating with the Genoa newspaper _Il Lavoro_. He later directed the magazine _Costume_ and worked, often for reports from abroad, for _La Stampa_ and _Corriere della Sera_.[2] His travels inspired him several books in the form of travel diaries such as _Giornale Indiano_ and _La Cina Ã¨ vicina_. His 1959 novel _The man from New York_ () got him a Bagutta Prize as well as critical praises which paired him to Gustave Flaubert and Alain Robbe-Grillet.[3]

Emanuelli died of a heart attack on July 1, 1967. His last novel, _Curriculum mortis_, was released posthumously and incomplete in 1968, yet it was received as his masterpiece.[4]
