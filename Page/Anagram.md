An ANAGRAM is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.[1] For example, the word _anagram_ can be rearranged into _nag a ram_, or the word _binary_ into _brainy_ or the word _adobe_ into _abode_.

The original word or phrase is known as the _subject_ of the anagram. Any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram. Someone who creates anagrams may be called an "anagrammatist",[2] and the goal of a serious or skilled anagrammatist is to produce anagrams that reflect or comment on their subject.


Examples

Anagrams may be created as a commentary on the subject. They may be a synonym or antonym of their subject, a parody, a criticism or satire. For example:

-   "rail safety" = "fairy tales"
-   "roast beef" = "eat for BSE" [3]
-   "Elvis" = "livEs" or "lives"

An anagram which means the opposite of its subject is called an "antigram". For example:

-   "restful" = "fluster"
-   "funeral" = "real fun"
-   "adultery" = "true lady"
-   "customers" = "store scum"
-   "forty five" = "over fifty"
-   "eleven plus two" = "twelve plus one"
-   "placebo" = "obecalp"

They can sometimes change from a proper noun or personal name into an appropriate sentence:

-   "William Shakespeare" = "I am a weakish speller"
-   "Madam Curie" = "Radium came"
-   In the second book of the Harry Potter series, it's been revealed that "I am Lord Voldemort" is an anagram of the character's birth name, "Tom Marvolo Riddle" .

They can change part of speech, such as the adjective "silent" to the verb "listen".

"Anagrams" itself can be anagrammatized as _"Ars magna"_ (Latin, 'the great art').[4]


History

Anagrams can be traced back to the time of the Ancient Greeks, and were then known as "Themuru" or changing, which was to find the hidden and mystical meaning in names.[5] They were popular throughout Europe during the Middle Ages, for example with the poet and composer Guillaume de Machaut.[6] They are said to go back at least to the Greek poet Lycophron, in the third century BCE; but this relies on an account of Lycophron given by John Tzetzes in the 12th century.[7]

Anagrams in Latin were considered witty over many centuries. "Est vir qui adest", explained below, was cited as the example in Samuel Johnson's _A Dictionary of the English Language_. They became hugely popular in the Early Modern period, especially in Germany.[8]

Any historical material on anagrams must always be interpreted in terms of the assumptions and spellings that were current for the language in question. In particular, spelling in English only slowly became fixed. There were attempts to regulate anagram formation, an important one in English being that of George Puttenham's _Of the Anagram or Posy Transposed_ in _The Art of English Poesie_ (1589).

Influence of Latin

As a literary game when Latin was the common property of the literate, Latin anagrams were prominent.[9]. Two examples are the change of _Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum_ (Latin: Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord [is] with you) into _Virgo serena, pia, munda et immaculata_ (Latin: Serene virgin, pious, clean and spotless), and the anagrammatic answer to Pilate's question, _Quid est veritas?_ (Latin: What is truth?), namely, _Est vir qui adest_ (Latin: It is the man who is here). The origins of these are not documented.

Latin continued to influence letter values (such as I = J, U = V and W = VV). There was an ongoing tradition of allowing anagrams to be "perfect" if the letters were all used once, but allowing for these interchanges. This can be seen in a popular Latin anagram against the Jesuits: _Societas Jesu_ turned into _Vitiosa seces_ (Latin: Cut off the wicked things). Puttenham, in the time of Elizabeth I of England, wished to start from _Elissabet Anglorum Regina_ (Latin: Elizabeth Queen of the English), to obtain _Multa regnabis ense gloria_ (Latin: By thy sword shalt thou reign in great renown); he explains carefully that H is "a note of aspiration only and no letter", and that Z in Greek or Hebrew is a mere SS. The rules were not completely fixed in the 17th century. William Camden in his _Remains_ commented, singling out some letters—Æ, K, W, and Z—not found in the classical Roman alphabet:[10]

Early modern period

When it comes to the 17th century and anagrams in English or other languages, there is a great deal of documented evidence of learned interest. The lawyer Thomas Egerton was praised through the anagram _gestat honorem_ ('he carries honor'); the physician George Ent took the anagrammatic motto _genio surget_ ('he rises through spirit/genius'), which requires his first name as _Georgius_.[11] James I's courtiers discovered in "James Stuart" "a just master", and converted "Charles James Stuart" into "Claims Arthur's seat" (even at that point in time, the letters I and J were more-or-less interchangeable). Walter Quin, tutor to the future Charles I, worked hard on multilingual anagrams on the name of father James.[12] A notorious murder scandal, the Overbury case, threw up two imperfect anagrams that were aided by typically loose spelling and were recorded by Simonds D'Ewes: "Francis Howard" (for Frances Carr, Countess of Somerset, her maiden name spelled in a variant) became "Car findes a whore", with the letters E hardly counted, and the victim Thomas Overbury, as "Thomas Overburie", was written as "O! O! a busie murther" (an old form of "murder"), with a V counted as U.[13][14]

William Drummond of Hawthornden, in an essay _On the Character of a Perfect Anagram_, tried to lay down rules for permissible substitutions (such as S standing for Z) and letter omissions.[15] William Camden[16] provided a definition of "Anagrammatisme" as "a dissolution of a name truly written into his letters, as his elements, and a new connection of it by artificial transposition, without addition, subtraction or change of any letter, into different words, making some perfect sense applyable (i.e., applicable) to the person named." Dryden in _MacFlecknoe_ disdainfully called the pastime the "torturing of one poor word ten thousand ways".[17]

"Eleanor Audeley", wife of Sir John Davies, is said to have been brought before the High Commission in 1634 for extravagances, stimulated by the discovery that her name could be transposed to "Reveale, O Daniel", and to have been laughed out of court by another anagram submitted by Sir John Lambe, the dean of the Arches, "Dame Eleanor Davies", "Never soe mad a ladie".[18][19]

An example from France was a flattering anagram for Cardinal Richelieu, comparing him to Hercules or at least one of his hands (Hercules being a kingly symbol), where _Armand de Richelieu_ became _Ardue main d'Hercule_ ("difficult hand of Hercules").[20]

Modern period

Examples from the 19th century are the transposition of "Horatio Nelson" into _Honor est a Nilo_ (Latin: Honor is from the Nile); and of "Florence Nightingale" into "Flit on, cheering angel".[21] The Victorian love of anagramming as recreation is alluded to by the mathematician Augustus De Morgan[22] using his own name as example; "Great Gun, do us a sum!" is attributed to his son William De Morgan, but a family friend John Thomas Graves was prolific, and a manuscript with over 2,800 has been preserved.[23][24][25]

With the advent of surrealism as a poetic movement, anagrams regained the artistic respect they had had in the Baroque period. The German poet Unica Zürn, who made extensive use of anagram techniques, came to regard obsession with anagrams as a "dangerous fever", because it created isolation of the author.[26] The surrealist leader André Breton coined the anagram _Avida Dollars_ for Salvador Dalí, to tarnish his reputation by the implication of commercialism.


Applications

While anagramming is certainly a recreation first, there are ways in which anagrams are put to use, and these can be more serious, or at least not quite frivolous and formless. For example, psychologists use anagram-oriented tests, often called "anagram solution tasks", to assess the implicit memory of young adults and adults alike.[27]

Establishment of priority

Natural philosophers (astronomers and others) of the 17th century transposed their discoveries into Latin anagrams, to establish their priority. In this way they laid claim to new discoveries, before their results were ready for publication.

Galileo used __ for __ (Latin: _I have observed the most distant planet to have a triple form_) for discovering the rings of Saturn in 1610.[28][29] Galileo announced his discovery that Venus had phases like the Moon in the form __ (Latin: _These immature ones have already been read in vain by me -oy_), that is, when rearranged, __ (Latin: _The Mother of Loves_ [= Venus] _imitates the figures of Cynthia_ [= the moon]). In both cases, Johannes Kepler had solved the anagrams incorrectly, assuming they were talking about the Moons of Mars (__) and a red spot on Jupiter (__), respectively.[30] By coincidence, he turned out to be right about the actual objects existing.

In 1656, Christiaan Huygens, using a better telescope than those available to Galileo, figured that Galileo's earlier observations of Saturn actually meant it had a ring (Galileo's tools were only sufficient to see it as bumps) and, like Galileo, had published an anagram, __. Upon confirming his observations, three years later he revealed it to mean __ (Latin: _It [Saturn] is surrounded by a thin, flat, ring, nowhere touching, inclined to the ecliptic_).[31]

When Robert Hooke discovered Hooke's law in 1660, he first published it in anagram form, __, for __ (Latin: _as the tension, so the force_).[32]

In a related use, from 1975, British naturalist Sir Peter Scott coined the scientific term __ (Greek: _The monster (or wonder) of Ness with the diamond-shaped fin_) for the apocryphal Loch Ness Monster.[33] Shortly afterwards, several London newspapers pointed out that __ anagrams into _Monster hoax by Sir Peter S_. However, Robert Rines, who previously made two underwater photographs allegedly showing the monster, countered that they can also be arranged into _Yes, both pix are monsters, R_.[34]

Pseudonyms

Anagrams are connected to pseudonyms, by the fact that they may conceal or reveal, or operate somewhere in between like a mask that can establish identity. For example, Jim Morrison used an anagram of his name in The Doors song _L.A. Woman_, calling himself "Mr. Mojo Risin'". The use of anagrams and fabricated personal names may be to circumvent restrictions on the use of real names, as happened in the 18th century when Edward Cave wanted to get around restrictions imposed on the reporting of the House of Commons.[35] In a genre such as farce or parody, anagrams as names may be used for pointed and satiric effect.

Pseudonyms adopted by authors are sometimes transposed forms of their names; thus "Calvinus" becomes "Alcuinus" (here V = U) or "François Rabelais" = "Alcofribas Nasier". The name "Voltaire" of François Marie Arouet fits this pattern, and is allowed to be an anagram of "Arouet, l[e] j[eune]" (U = V, J = I) that is, "Arouet the younger". Other examples include:

-   "Damon Albarn" = "Dan Abnormal"
-   "Dave Barry" = "Ray Adverb"
-   "Arrigo Boito" = "Tobia Gorrio"
-   "Buckethead" = "Death Cube K"
-   "Daniel Clowes" = "Enid Coleslaw"
-   "Siobhán Donaghy" = "Shanghai Nobody"
-   "Glen Duncan" = "Declan Gunn"[36]
-   "(Theodor) Giesel" = "(Theo) Le Sieg"
-   "Edward Gorey" = "Ogdred Weary", = "Regera Dowdy" or = "E. G. Deadworry" (and others)
-   "Anna Madrigal" = "A man and a girl"
-   "Tom Marvolo Riddle" = "I am Lord Voldemort"
-   "Ted Morgan" = "(Sanche) de Gramont"
-   "Lorin Morgan-Richards" = "Marcil d'Hirson Garron"
-   "Vladimir Nabokov" = "Vivian Darkbloom", = "Vivian Bloodmark", = "Blavdak Vinomori", or = "Dorian Vivalkomb"
-   "Elon Musk" = "Muskmelon"

Several of these are "imperfect anagrams", letters having been left out in some cases for the sake of easy pronunciation.

Titles

Anagrams used for titles afford scope for some types of wit. Examples:

-   Homer Hickam, Jr.'s book _Rocket Boys_ was adapted into the 1999 film _October Sky_.[37]
-   The tapes for the revival of the BBC show _Doctor Who_ were labeled with the anagram _Torchwood_, which later went on to be used as the name for a spin-off show.
-   The New Wave band Missing Persons' best-selling album was called _Spring Session M_.
-   Hip-hop artist MF DOOM recorded a 2004 album called _MM..FOOD_.
-   Brian Eno's album _Before and After Science_ includes a song entitled "King's Lead Hat", an anagram of "Talking Heads", a band Eno has worked with.
-   Juan Maria Solare's piano ballad "Jura ser anomalía" (literally "he/she swears to be an anomaly") is an anagram of the composer's full name. His composition for English horn titled "A Dot in Time" is an anagram of "Meditation", which describes the piece. The title of his piano piece that is a homage to Claude Debussy is "Seduce Us Badly".
-   Bill Evans's overdubbed piano elegy for fellow jazz pianist Sonny Clark is titled "N.Y.C.'s No Lark," and another composition, "Re: Person I Knew" is a tribute to his producer, Orrin Keepnews.
-   The title of Imogen Heap's album _iMegaphone_ is an anagram of her name.
-   Progressive rock group Rush published a song off their 1989 album _Presto_ titled "Anagram (for Mongo)" that makes use of anagrams in every line of their song.
-   The title of the fifth album by American rock band Interpol, _El Pintor_, is an anagram of the band's name and also Spanish for "the painter".
-   Many of the song titles on Aphex Twin's _...I Care Because You Do_ are anagrams of either "Aphex Twin", "The Aphex Twin", or "Richard D James".
-   In Disney's 1964 film _Mary Poppins_, Dick Van Dyke played Mr. Dawes, Sr., as the anagram of his name, Navckid Keyd. In the credits, the words unscrambled themselves to reveal his name.

Coincidences

In Hebrew, the name "Gernot Zippe" (גרנוט ציפה), the inventor of the Zippe-type centrifuge, is an anagram of the word "centrifuge" (צנטריפוגה).

Games and puzzles

Anagrams are in themselves a recreational activity, but they also make up part of many other games, puzzles and game shows. The Jumble is a puzzle found in many newspapers in the United States requiring the unscrambling of letters to find the solution. Cryptic crossword puzzles frequently use anagrammatic clues, usually indicating that they are anagrams by the inclusion of a descriptive term like "confused" or "in disarray". An example would be _Businessman burst into tears (9 letters)_. The solution, _stationer_, is an anagram of _into tears_, the letters of which have _burst_ out of their original arrangement to form the name of a type of _businessman_.

Numerous other games and contests involve some element of anagram formation as a basic skill. Some examples:

-   In Anagrams, players flip tiles over one at a time and race to take words. They can "steal" each other's words by rearranging the letters and extending the words.
-   In a version of Scrabble called Clabbers, the name itself being an anagram of Scrabble, tiles may be placed in any order on the board as long as they anagram to a valid word.
-   On the British game show _Countdown_, contestants are given 30 seconds to make the longest word from nine random letters.
-   In Boggle, players make constrained words from a grid of sixteen random letters, by joining adjacent cubes.
-   On the British game show _BrainTeaser_, contestants are shown a word broken into randomly arranged segments and must announce the whole word. At the end of the game there is a "Pyramid" which starts with a three-letter word. A letter appears in the line below to which the player must add the existing letters to find a solution. The pattern continues until the player reaches the final eight-letter anagram. The player wins the game by solving all the anagrams within the allotted time.
-   In Bananagrams, players place tiles from a pool into crossword-style word arrangements in a race to see who can finish the pool of tiles first.
-   Other anagram games include Bonza (Word Game), Bookworm (video game), Dabble, Jumble, Letterpress (video game), Perquackey, Puzzlage, Word Force, WordSpot, and Words with Friends.

Ciphers

Multiple anagramming is a technique used to solve some kinds of cryptograms, such as a permutation cipher, a transposition cipher, and the Jefferson disk.[38] Solutions may be computationally found using a Jumble algorithm.


Methods of construction

Sometimes, it is possible to "see" anagrams in words, unaided by tools, though the more letters involved the more difficult this becomes. Anagram dictionaries could also be used. Computer programs, known as "anagram servers"[39] "anagram solvers"[40] or "anagrammers"[41], offer a much faster route to creating anagrams, and a large number of these programs are available on the Internet.

The program or server carries out an exhaustive search of a database of words, to produce a list containing every possible combination of words or phrases from the input word or phrase using a jumble algorithm. Some programs (such as _Lexpert_) restrict to one-word answers. Many anagram servers (for example, The Words Oracle) can control the search results, by excluding or including certain words, limiting the number or length of words in each anagram, or limiting the number of results. Anagram solvers are often banned from online anagram games. The disadvantage of computer anagram solvers, especially when applied to multi-word anagrams, is their poor understanding of the meaning of the words they are manipulating. They usually cannot filter out meaningful or appropriate anagrams from large numbers of nonsensical word combinations. Some servers attempt to improve on this using statistical techniques that try to combine only words that appear together often. This approach provides only limited success since it fails to recognize ironic and humorous combinations.

Some anagrammatists indicate the method they used. Anagrams constructed without aid of a computer are noted as having been done "manually" or "by hand"; those made by utilizing a computer may be noted "by machine" or "by computer", or may indicate the name of the computer program (using _Anagram Genius_).

There are also a few "natural" instances: English words unconsciously created by switching letters around. The French _chaise longue_ ("long chair") became the American "chaise lounge" by metathesis (transposition of letters and/or sounds). It has also been speculated that the English "curd" comes from the Latin _crudus_ ("raw"). Similarly, the ancient English word for bird was "brid".


Prominent anagrammatists

The French king Louis XIII had a man named Thomas Billen appointed as his Royal Anagrammatist with an annual salary of 1200 pounds.[42] Among contemporary anagrammers, Anu Garg, the founder of Wordsmith.org, created the Internet Anagram Server in 1994. He is also the founder and editor of satirical anagram-based newspaper The Anagram Times. Mike Keith has anagrammed the complete text of Moby Dick.[43] He, along with Richard Brodie, has published _The Anagrammed Bible_ that includes anagrammed version of many books of the Bible.[44] Popular television personality Dick Cavett is known for his anagrams of famous celebrities such as Alec Guinness and Spiro Agnew.[45]


Anagram animation

An animated anagram displays the letters of a word or phrase moving into their new positions. Animations can be created manually, or with software.[46]
