MOTOBLOT is an annual motorcycle rally held in Chicago, Illinois, for three days and four nights in June.[1] It is the largest vintage motorcycle and scooter rally in the United States.[2] One of the co-producers of the festival was Riot Fest founder Sean McKeough. [3]


History and features

The first Motoblot rally took place in July 2014, and was renamed from the previous "Mods vs Rockers Chicago" rally.[4] In addition to a motorcycle and hot rod show, the rally features live music, the Miss Motoblot pin-up contest,[5] and sponsorship by Triumph Motorcycles, Progressive Insurance, and All Rise Brewing.[6]

Motoblot also has featured a custom motorcycle building competition called the Iron Moto Challenge.[7] Local Chicago dealer Motoworks won the competition in 2014 and 2015.[8]
