MANGAL is a former princely state in north India.

Its territory, presently in Himachal Pradesh, was only 33.6 km2, with a population of 1,227 in 1901.


History

The princely state was founded in the fifteenth century. From 1803 - 1815 t was occupied by mighty neighboring Gurkha kingdom Nepal. On 20 December 1815 it entered the British raj by accepting a protectorate, restoring its autonomy, now within British India, colonially controlled under the Simla Hill States Superintendency of the Punjab States Agency.

Although its revenue was only 700 rupees, a private purse of 3000 rupees was awarded to the ruling Ranas.

Its separate existence ended at its accession to the then Chief Commissioner's Province of Himachal Pradesh, and hence to independent India, on 15 April 1948.
