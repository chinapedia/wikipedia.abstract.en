BOOYAMI INC. (also often referred by its brand names FINAGRAPH or BBC EASY) is a provider of automation tools and business intelligence software for small business accounting. The company was founded in 2011 by a former Microsoft employee James Walter and a former vice-president of Bank of America, Corey Ross.[1][2] The synergy produced BBC Easy and Finagraph — two technological solutions for small business that offer strategic financial intelligence and streamline obtaining business loans.[3] After Moody's acquisition of the stake in Booyami in May 2016, Booyami announced that it now intends to expand its Finagraph service to medium-size businesses.[4][5]


History

Booyami Inc. was founded in March 2011 by two former Seattle area executives, James Walter and Corey Ross.[6] With seven years experience working on Xbox and Windows 7 at Microsoft, James came from the IT world, while Corey, who held titles of vice-president in Banner Bank and in Bank of America, came from the world of banking.[7][8]

Together, they conceived its first product — ″BBC Easy″ aimed to automate borrowing base certificate processing for small businesses. By the end of 2011, the company raised over $900,000 of venture capital towards patenting their ideas and towards the new hires needed for the product development.[9] BBC Easy cloud application was launched in November 2012.[10] In April 2013, the first financial institution, Numerica Credit Union, successfully integrated the product into its C&I loan system.[11]

At the same time Booyami started its second product, Finagraph, designed to assess small businesses for loan eligibility. In 2013 Booyami intended to raise $1 million for the product development, but managed to raise only $195,000.[12] Nevertheless, Finagraph was successfully developed. In 2014, Finagraph was among 20 finalists (out of 870 participants) of Forbes' _New Banking and Digital Life_ Open Talent event.[13] Booyami initially planned to sell Finagraph to small businesses,[14] but changed their business model, offering Finagraph to small business for free, making money of banks and large accounting firms.[15]

Selling Finagraph to US banks was aggravated by "the steep regulations in the industry," and Booyami searched for alternative ways to promote and distribute the product.[16] In September 2014, Booyami raised additional $1.25 million to acquire a 15-year-old Seattle _BBI Financial Academy_.[17][18] Booyami re-branded it as "Finagraph Academy" and incorporated Finagraph in its training courses.[19]

In October 2015, Puget Sound Business Journal has listed Booyami in the top ten Big Data companies of Puget Sound Area.[20] In May 2016, Moody's purchased a stake in Booyami. The companies announced plans to integrate Finagraph with existing Moody's analytics tools and further developing Finagraph to service medium-sized businesses.[21][22]


Products and Services

BBC Easy

BBC_Easy_Logo_--_brand_of_Booyami_Inc.png BBC Easy (stands for ″Borrowing Base Certificates made EASY″) is a cloud application that streamlines processing of small business loans. In order to get a loan approval, a small business needs to certify is borrowing base — a metric of the value of its assets, so the lender can determine the size of the loan that can be offered. However, the time required of a loan officer to underwrite a small loan is comparable to the time needed to underwrite a substantial loan which reduces banks' propensity to deal with small borrowers.[23] BBC Easy simplifies underwriting by generating required forms and reports directly from borrower's accounting system, thus reducing errors, fraud, and in turn, lenders' risks.[24][25] BBC Easy turns traditional borrowing base certificate submission into a single click.[26]

After the application launch in November 2012,[27] Booyami focused on credit unions as the primary market for BBC sales.[28] Numerica Credit Union in Spokane, Washington was the first bank that adopted BBC Easy.[29]

Finagraph

Finagraph_Logo_--_brand_of_Booyami_Inc.png Finagraph is a business intelligence application which analyzes current and historical accounting data of a small business, offers strategical financial advice,[30] and provides business owners with an overview of their business from banks' perspective, including relevant financial comparisons with similar organizations within the same industry.[31][32] Finagraph is compatible with major accounting software (such as QuickBooks, Xero, etc.) and does not require any separate data entry.[33] Instead, Finagraph ″replaces hours of work with 1-click.″[34][35]

Furthermore, Finagraph can perform certain functions of BBC Easy by assembling relevant accounting data and generating forms required for a loan application.[36][37][38] Finagraph is currently offered to clients for free, as Booyami seeks to make money of Finagraph licences sold to financial institutions.[39][40] In the effort of disseminating Finagraph, Booyami has purchased _BBI Financial Academy_ and modified its curriculum around Finagraph.[41]

Finagraph also supports complex accounting of crowdfunding ventures.[42] In 2014, Finagraph application was recognized by Forbes as _New Banking and Digital Life_ finalist.[43] After Moody's investment into Booyami in 2016, Booyami announced its intention to expand Finagraph to medium-size businesses market and to feature Finagraph with credit score information based on Moody's Analytics Risk Quality (MARQ) system.[44][45]

Finagraph Academy

Formerly BBI FINANCIAL ACADEMY, Finagraph Academy founded in 1990[46] provides financial education and consulting to business owners and accountants.[47] Booyami purchased the academy on September 18, 2014 and re-branded it as ″Finagraph Academy.″[48][49] The academy retained its original curriculum, while incorporating Finagraph in its courses with the goal to promote Finagraph among accountants and business owners.[50][51]
