_THESE MEMORIES WON'T LAST_ is a 2015 webcomic created by Stu Campbell. The infinite canvas webcomic written in HTML5 tells the story of Campbell's grandfather suffering from Alzheimer's disease. _These Memories Won't Last_ is deliberately created to work with current web browser software and will likely not be readable with future technologies. The webcomic was nominated for an Eisner Award.


Content

In _These Memories Won't Last_, Stu Campbell describes his experiences from when his grandfather was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. In the webcomic, Campbell recounts how he spent parts of his youth listening to his grandfather's childhood memories and old war stories, before going on to describe how these stories began to fade as his grandfather's condition developed. As the reader scrolls down the page, earlier panels begin to disappear making re-reading the webcomic difficult, mimicking the effects of the disease. Campbell tells mournful anecdotes of his grandfather experiencing severe paranoia and calling him by his cousin's name.[1]

The webcomic was created in HTML5 in order to work on web browsers and features a large amount of subtle visual effects. Foggy clouds drift across the screen as the reader scrolls down the page and an atmospheric soundtrack was composed by Lhasa Mencur.[2] A rope twists around the panels of the webcomic, connecting elements of the story. As the grandfather's mind deteriorates, the rope becomes tangled and knotted, ensnaring individual elements of his memory. Some panels and text are crystal clear when these are out of sync, but when the reader scrolls to line them up properly, they get a misty appearance. Scrolling backwards is fruitless, as previous panels become hidden in a white fog.[3]


Development

Campbell created _These Memories Won't Last_ during his stay at Vienna's Air 15 artist residency.[4] In an interview with _CNET_, Campbell explained that he had been experimenting with incorporating interactive elements in digital comics for a while at that point, in order to find new ways to invoke a feeling for his story. Campbell's previous works _Modern Polaxis_, _Neomad_, and _Nawlz_ were similarly enhanced through digital means. The slowly fading panels of _These Memories Won't Last_ were intended to create a sense of urgency to read the story before time runs out.[5]

Campbell wrote his webcomic in part to preserve the memories of his grandfather. Though browser updates have shown to often break the functionalities of the page, Campbell stated that reaching an audience through computers and smart devices was something he deemed important. Campbell said to _CNET_ that he hopes that the story of his grandfather and the digital presentation of his work "shows the fragility of memory and makes us question how we choose to preserve it."[6]

_These Memories Won't Last_ was published in December 2015. Its soundtrack was designed by Lhasa Mencur, and it was programmed by Vitaliy Shirokiy.[7]


Reception

_These Memories Won't Last_ was nominated for an Eisner Award in the "Digital Comics" category in 2016. Caitlin Rosberg of _Paste Magazine_ stated that _These Memories Won't Last_ uses motion and music to "ensnare" the readerâ€™s attention and force them to actively engage with the webcomic.[8] Michelle Starr of _CNET_ said that, as a "story of fading memories told in a fading medium," _These Memories Won't Last_ is particularly poignant, asking questions of how stories should be preserved and remembered.[9]

Minna Sundberg of _NPR_ noted that though Cambell's "goofy" art style doesn't seem suited for the melancholy plot at first, the latter actually works really well with the over-exaggerated features and fantastical images. Noting the brittle nature of the work, Sundberg described _These Memories Won't Last_ as a "fragile gem".[10] _The Hindu_ stated in 2018 that the webcomic "offer[s] an experience that cannot be reproduced in print," calling it "a homage to the unique opportunities offered by technology."[11]
