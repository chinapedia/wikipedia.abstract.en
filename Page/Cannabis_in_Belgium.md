CANNABIS IN BELGIUM is illegal, but personal possession has been decriminalized since 2003;[1][2] adults over the age of 18 are allowed to possess up to 3 grams.[3][4]

In June 2015, Maggie De Block signed a royal decree legalizing certain uses of medical cannabis, which as of 2015 only include Sativex oral spray for multiple sclerosis.[5]
