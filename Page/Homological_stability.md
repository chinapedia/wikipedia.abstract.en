In mathematics, HOMOLOGICAL STABILITY is any of a number of theorems asserting that the group homology of a series of groups G₁ ⊂ G₂ ⊂ ⋯ is stable, i.e.,

_H__(_i_)(_G__(_n_))
is independent of _n_ when _n_ is large enough (depending on _i_). The smallest _n_ such that the maps H_(i)(G_(n)) → H_(i)(G_(n + 1)) is an isomorphism is referred to as the _stable range_. The concept of homological stability was pioneered by Daniel Quillen whose proof technique has been adapted in various situations.[1]


Examples

Examples of such groups include the following:

  group                                                               name
  ------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------
  symmetric group S_(n)                                               Nakaoka stability[2]
  braid group B_(n)                                                   [3]
  general linear group GL_(n)(R) for (certain) rings _R_              [4][5]
  mapping class group of surfaces (_n_ is the genus of the surface)   Harer stability[6]
  automorphism group of free groups, Aut (F_(n))                      [7]


Applications

In some cases, the homology of the group

_G__(∞) = ⋃_(_n_)_G__(_n_)
can be computed by other means or is related to other data. For example, the Barratt–Priddy theorem relates the homology of the infinite symmetric group agrees with mapping spaces of spheres. This can also be stated as a relation between the plus construction of BS_(∞) and the sphere spectrum. In a similar vein, the homology of GL_(∞)(R) is related, via the +-construction, to the algebraic K-theory of _R_.
