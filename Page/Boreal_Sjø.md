BOREAL SJØ AS (formerly BOREAL TRANSPORT NORD AS and VEOLIA TRANSPORT NORD AS) is a subsidiary of Boreal Norge, operating road ferries and fast ferries in Finnmark, Nordland and Troms. The headquarters are located in Hammerfest, Finnmark.[1]


History

In spring of 2007, Veolia Transport Norge restructured their subsidiaries that had been acquired since the beginning in 1999, to make larger regional units. _Veolia Transport Nord AS_ (VTN) was created as a merger of Finnmark Fylkesrederi og Ruteselskap (FFR), Helgelandske, and the two former Nordtrafikk subsidiaries Nordtrafikk Buss and Nordtrafikk Maritim. FFR and Nordtrafikk's bus operations in Eastern Norway were moved to another regional unit.[2]

When Veolia sold their Norwegian operations in May 2011, renaming the Norwegian operations to Boreal Transport, the company was accordingly renamed _Boreal Transport Nord AS_ (BTN), its current name.

In July 2014, Boreal Transport Nord acquired Hurtigruten's 71.3%-share in TIRB, becoming the major owner.[3] TIRB had the bus operating subsidiaries Cominor (100%) and Senja Rutebil (49.3%)

In 2014, a PSO tender for all bus operations in Finnmark (except some minibus routes) was offered, and in 2015 it was won by Boreal Transport Nord as the only bidder. The contract lasts for seven years, starting from 1 January 2016, with an optional extension of up to three years. The buses were delivered by Scania and Mercedes-Benz.[4]

During 2016, a new restructure occurred, changing from regional units to units based on business areas. As BTN had all of Boreal's ferry operations, the company was renamed _Boreal Sjø AS_ and all other business areas were moved to other Boreal companies. All non-commercial bus services were moved to Boreal Buss, while commercial operations were moved to Boreal Travel.
