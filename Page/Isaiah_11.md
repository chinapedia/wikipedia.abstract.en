    {S} 11:1-9 {S} 11:10 {P} 11:11-16 [12:1-6 {S}]


Verse 1

    _And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse,_

        _and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:_[3]

Cross reference: Isaiah 11:10

-   "Rod" (◊ó◊ò◊® ; also in : or "branch" (◊¶◊û◊ó tsemach) in Isaiah 4:2 (a twig, a shoot); these words "are messianic terms."[4]

-   "Jesse": the father of king David ().[5]
-   "Branch" - (◊†◊¶◊® ). A twig, branch, sprout or shoot; a word of "messianic terms."[6] The word occurs four times in the Hebrew Bible including this verse; the other three are Isaiah 60:21 : 'They shall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting;' Isaiah 14:19 : 'But thou art cast out of thy grave as an abominable branch;' Daniel 11:7: 'But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate.' There is another word rendered "branch" in Jeremiah 23:5; Jeremiah 33:15, a different word in the original (◊¶◊û◊ó tsemach), although it means substantially the same thing. The word "branch" is also used in rendering several other Hebrew words, but here the word is synonymous with that which is rendered "rod" in the previous part of the verse - a shoot, or twig, from the root of a decayed tree.[7] The word "netser" or "netzer" is the name of the city of Nazareth;[8] which perhaps called like that, from the trees, plants, and grass, which grew here. Jesus Christ's dwelling in this city fulfilled a prophecy, that he should be called a "NAZARENE"; or an inhabitant of Netzer (Matthew 2:23). The Jews speak of one Ben Netzer, who they say was a robber, took cities, and reigned over them, and became the head of robbers;[9] and make him to be the little horn in ,[10] which some implied that he was Jesus;[11] at the same time it tacitly acknowledges that Jesus of Nazareth is the "Netzer" this prophecy speaks of, but in a negative way, that he should be as "a root out of a dry ground" (Isaiah 53:2) or as "a rod and branch out of a dry root".[12]
-   "Roots": from a decayed tree where a shoot starts up. The Septuagint renders this, 'And a flower (·ºÑŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ anthos) shall arise from the root'.[13] Chaldee version states 'And a king shall proceed from the sons of Jesse, and the Messiah from his sons' sons shall arise', showing conclusively that the ancient Jews referred this to the Messiah.[14] In the Book of Revelation it is applied to Jesus Christ (Revelation 22:16).[15]


Verse 3

    _His delight shall be in the fear of the Lord_, (English Standard Version), or
    _Of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord_ (King James Version).


Verse 6

    ''‚ÄúThe wolf also shall dwell with the lamb,

        ''The leopard shall lie down with the young goat,

    ''The calf and the young lion and the fatling together;

        _And a little child shall lead them._[16]


Verse 10

    ''‚ÄúAnd in that day there shall be a Root of Jesse,

        ''Who shall stand as a banner to the people;

    ''For the Gentiles shall seek Him,

        _And His resting place shall be glorious.‚Äù_[17]

-   Cross reference: (a) Isaiah 11:1
    (b) Isaiah 2:3; Isaiah 43:6; Isaiah 49:22; Isaiah 60:3; Isaiah 66:12
-   Cited by Apostle Paul in Romans 15:12
-   "Root of Jesse": a sprout, shoot, or scion of the family of Jesse (cf. Isaiah 5:1).[18] This particular "root" (Hebrew: , _shoresh_) is still alive when the tree is dead, that it can send up a shoot or sprout; it is thus applied to him who should come out of the ancient and decayed family of Jesse (cf. Isaiah 53:2).[19] In Revelation 5:5, the Messiah is called 'the" root" of David,' and in Revelation 22:16, 'the root and the offspring of David'.[20]
