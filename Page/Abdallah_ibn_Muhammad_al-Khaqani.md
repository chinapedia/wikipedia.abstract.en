ABU'L-QĀSIM ABDALLĀH IBN MUḤAMMAD AL-KHĀQĀNĪ was a senior official of the Abbasid Caliphate, who served as vizier in 924–925.

He was the son of Muhammad ibn Ubayd Allah al-Khaqani, vizier in 912–913, and grandson of Ubayd Allah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan, vizier in 851–861 and 870–877. He served as a secretary under his father, and in June 924 became vizier himself, in succession to Ali ibn al-Furat. He was unable to deal with the challenges facing the Abbasid government at the time, and was dismissed in November 925, on the insistence of the commander-in-chief Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, who at the time was the virtual regent of the Caliphate. As was customary, he was imprisoned and forced to pay a fine. Released, he died in 926/7.
