Nearby localities include Ratyan, Bayanoun and Mayer to the north, Anadan, Huraytan to the west, Kafr Hamrah to the south and Shaykh Najjar to the east.

Syrian civil war

During 2013 Kafr Saghir received in influx of Kurds from nearby Tell Aran and Tal Hasel.[4]

On 3 July 2014 during Operation Canopus Star, the Syrian military with help from Republican Guards and Hezbollah captured Kafr Saghir from opposition forces.[5]

On 20 March 2016, ISIL killed more than 20 Kurdish and Arab civilians in the eastern Aleppo town of Kafr Saghir.[6] By 22 March, however, the Syrian Army managed to repel the ISIL offensive and regain control over the villages.[7]

After ISIL was driven from Kafr Saghir by the Syrian Armed Forces and the Syrian Democratic Forces, a new, local militia named the "Kafr Saghir Martyrs Brigade" was formed by the two to protect the area.[8] This unit later joined the Syrian National Resistance.
