CHARLES JOHN HUFFAM DICKENS (; 7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era.[1] His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the 20th century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories are still widely read today.[2][3]

Born in Portsmouth, Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed readings extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms.

Dickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of _The Pickwick Papers_. Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication.[4][5] Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense.[6] The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback.[7] For example, when his wife's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in _David Copperfield_ seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features.[8] His plots were carefully constructed, and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives.[9] Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha'pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.[10]

His 1843 novella _A Christmas Carol_ remains especially popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. _Oliver Twist_ and _Great Expectations_ are also frequently adapted and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel _A Tale of Two Cities_ (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. Dickens has been praised by many of his fellow writers—from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell, G. K. Chesterton, and Tom Wolfe—for his realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social criticism. However, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of sentimentalism.

The term _Dickensian_ is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters.[11]


Early years

, Dickens's home 1817 – May 1821[12]]]

Charles John Huffam Dickens was born on 7 February 1812, at 1 Mile End Terrace (now 393 Commercial Road), Landport in Portsea Island (Portsmouth), the second of eight children of Elizabeth Dickens (née Barrow; 1789–1863) and John Dickens (1785–1851). His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district. He asked Christopher Huffam,[13] rigger to His Majesty's Navy, gentleman, and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles. Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey, the owner of a shipping company in Dickens's novel _Dombey and Son_ (1848).[14]

In January 1815, John Dickens was called back to London, and the family moved to Norfolk Street, Fitzrovia.[15] When Charles was four, they relocated to Sheerness, and thence to Chatham, Kent, where he spent his formative years until the age of 11. His early life seems to have been idyllic, though he thought himself a "very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy".[16]

Charles spent time outdoors, but also read voraciously, including the picaresque novels of Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding, as well as _Robinson Crusoe_ and _Gil Blas_. He read and reread _The Arabian Nights_ and the Collected Farces of Elizabeth Inchbald.[17] He retained poignant memories of childhood, helped by an excellent memory of people and events, which he used in his writing.[18] His father's brief work as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him a few years of private education, first at a dame school, and then at a school run by William Giles, a dissenter, in Chatham.[19] , published in the 1892 edition of Forster's _Life of Dickens_[20]]]

This period came to an end in June 1822, when John Dickens was recalled to Navy Pay Office headquarters at Somerset House, and the family (except for Charles, who stayed behind to finish his final term of work) moved to Camden Town in London.[21] The family had left Kent amidst rapidly mounting debts, and, living beyond his means,[22] John Dickens was forced by his creditors into the Marshalsea debtors' prison in Southwark, London in 1824. His wife and youngest children joined him there, as was the practice at the time. Charles, then 12 years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at 112 College Place, Camden Town.[23] Roylance was "a reduced [impoverished] old lady, long known to our family", whom Dickens later immortalised, "with a few alterations and embellishments", as "Mrs Pipchin" in _Dombey and Son_. Later, he lived in a back-attic in the house of an agent for the Insolvent Court, Archibald Russell, "a fat, good-natured, kind old gentleman... with a quiet old wife" and lame son, in Lant Street in Southwark.[24] They provided the inspiration for the Garlands in _The Old Curiosity Shop_.[25]

On Sundays—with his sister Frances, free from her studies at the Royal Academy of Music—he spent the day at the Marshalsea.[26] Dickens later used the prison as a setting in _Little Dorrit_. To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warren's Blacking Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present Charing Cross railway station, where he earned six shillings a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. The strenuous and often harsh working conditions made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays, becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socio-economic and labour conditions, the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor. He later wrote that he wondered "how I could have been so easily cast away at such an age".[27] As he recalled to John Forster (from _The Life of Charles Dickens_):

  The blacking-warehouse was the last house on the left-hand side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.[28]

When the warehouse was moved to Chandos Street in the smart, busy district of Covent Garden the boys worked in a room in which the window gave onto the street and little audiences gathered and watched them at work—in Dickens biographer Simon Callow's estimation, the public display was "a new refinement added to his misery".[29]

around 1897, after it had closed]] A few months after his imprisonment, John Dickens's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, died and bequeathed him £450. On the expectation of this legacy, Dickens was released from prison. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act, Dickens arranged for payment of his creditors, and he and his family left Marshalsea,[30] for the home of Mrs Roylance.

Charles's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, did not immediately support his removal from the boot-blacking warehouse. This influenced Dickens's view that a father should rule the family, and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home: "I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back". His mother's failure to request his return was a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women.[31]

Righteous indignation stemming from his own situation and the conditions under which working-class people lived became major themes of his works, and it was this unhappy period in his youth to which he alluded in his favourite, and most autobiographical, novel, _David Copperfield_:[32] "I had no advice, no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, no assistance, no support, of any kind, from anyone, that I can call to mind, as I hope to go to heaven!"[33]

Dickens was eventually sent to the Wellington House Academy in Camden Town, where he remained until March 1827, having spent about two years there. He did not consider it to be a good school: "Much of the haphazard, desultory teaching, poor discipline punctuated by the headmaster's sadistic brutality, the seedy ushers and general run-down atmosphere, are embodied in Mr Creakle's Establishment in _David Copperfield_."[34]

Dickens worked at the law office of Ellis and Blackmore, attorneys, of Holborn Court, Gray's Inn, as a junior clerk from May 1827 to November 1828. He was a gifted mimic and impersonated those around him: clients, lawyers, and clerks. He went to theatres obsessively—he claimed that for at least three years he went to the theatre every single day. His favourite actor was Charles Mathews, and Dickens learnt his _monopolylogues_, (farces in which Mathews played every character), by heart.[35] Then, having learned Gurney's system of shorthand in his spare time, he left to become a freelance reporter. A distant relative, Thomas Charlton, was a freelance reporter at Doctors' Commons, and Dickens was able to share his box there to report the legal proceedings for nearly four years.[36][37] This education was to inform works such as _Nicholas Nickleby_, _Dombey and Son_, and especially _Bleak House_—whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the general public and served as a vehicle for dissemination of Dickens's own views regarding, particularly, the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by circumstances to "go to law".

In 1830, Dickens met his first love, Maria Beadnell, thought to have been the model for the character Dora in _David Copperfield_. Maria's parents disapproved of the courtship and ended the relationship by sending her to school in Paris.[38]


Journalism and early novels

In 1832, at age 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident.[39] He enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment, lacked a clear, specific sense of what he wanted to become, and yet knew he wanted fame. Drawn to the theatre—he became an early member of the Garrick[40] — he landed an acting audition at Covent Garden, where the manager George Bartley and the actor Charles Kemble were to see him. Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate the comedian Charles Mathews, but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold. Before another opportunity arose, he had set out on his career as a writer.[41] In 1833, he submitted his first story, "A Dinner at Poplar Walk", to the London periodical _Monthly Magazine_.[42] William Barrow, a brother of his mother, offered him a job on _The Mirror of Parliament_ and he worked in the House of Commons for the first time early in 1832. He rented rooms at Furnival's Inn and worked as a political journalist, reporting on Parliamentary debates, and he travelled across Britain to cover election campaigns for the _Morning Chronicle_. His journalism, in the form of sketches in periodicals, formed his first collection of pieces, published in 1836: _Sketches by Boz_—Boz being a family nickname he employed as a pseudonym for some years.[43][44] Dickens apparently adopted it from the nickname "Moses", which he had given to his youngest brother Augustus Dickens, after a character in Oliver Goldsmith's _The Vicar of Wakefield_. When pronounced by anyone with a head cold, "Moses" became "Boses"—later shortened to _Boz_.[45][46] Dickens's own name was considered "queer" by a contemporary critic, who wrote in 1849: "Mr Dickens, as if in revenge for his own queer name, does bestow still queerer ones upon his fictitious creations." He contributed to and edited journals throughout his literary career.[47] In January 1835, the _Morning Chronicle_ launched an evening edition, under the editorship of the _Chronicle_{{'}}s music critic, George Hogarth. Hogarth invited Dickens to contribute _Street Sketches_ and Dickens became a regular visitor to his Fulham house, excited by Hogarth's friendship with a hero of his, Walter Scott, and enjoying the company of Hogarth's three daughters—Georgina, Mary, and nineteen-year-old Catherine.[48]

(1838)]]

Dickens made rapid progress both professionally and socially. He began a friendship with William Harrison Ainsworth, the author of the highwayman novel _Rookwood_ (1834), whose bachelor salon in Harrow Road had become the meeting place for a set that included Daniel Maclise, Benjamin Disraeli, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and George Cruikshank. All these became his friends and collaborators, with the exception of Disraeli, and he met his first publisher, John Macrone, at the house.[49] The success of _Sketches by Boz_ led to a proposal from publishers Chapman and Hall for Dickens to supply text to match Robert Seymour's engraved illustrations in a monthly letterpress. Seymour committed suicide after the second instalment, and Dickens, who wanted to write a connected series of sketches, hired "Phiz" to provide the engravings (which were reduced from four to two per instalment) for the story. The resulting story became _The Pickwick Papers_, and though the first few episodes were not successful, the introduction of the Cockney character Sam Weller in the fourth episode (the first to be illustrated by Phiz) marked a sharp climb in its popularity.[50] The final instalment sold 40,000 copies.[51]

In November 1836, Dickens accepted the position of editor of _Bentley's Miscellany_, a position he held for three years, until he fell out with the owner.[52] In 1836 as he finished the last instalments of _The Pickwick Papers_, he began writing the beginning instalments of _Oliver Twist_—writing as many as 90 pages a month—while continuing work on _Bentley's_ and also writing four plays, the production of which he oversaw. _Oliver Twist_, published in 1838, became one of Dickens's better known stories, and was the first Victorian novel with a child protagonist.[53]

, 1839]]

On 2 April 1836, after a one-year engagement, and between episodes two and three of _The Pickwick Papers_, Dickens married Catherine Thomson Hogarth (1816–1879), the daughter of George Hogarth, editor of the _Evening Chronicle_.[54] They were married in St. Luke's Church,[55] Chelsea, London. After a brief honeymoon in Chalk in Kent, the couple returned to lodgings at Furnival's Inn.[56] The first of their ten children, Charley, was born in January 1837, and a few months later the family set up home in Bloomsbury at 48 Doughty Street, London, (on which Charles had a three-year lease at £80 a year) from 25 March 1837 until December 1839.[57][58] Dickens's younger brother Frederick and Catherine's 17-year-old sister Mary, moved in with them. Dickens became very attached to Mary, and she died in his arms after a brief illness in 1837. Unusually for Dickens, as a consequence of his shock, he stopped working, and he and Kate stayed at a little farm on Hampstead Heath for a fortnight. Dickens idealised Mary—the character he fashioned after her, Rose Maylie, he found he could not now kill, as he had planned, in his fiction,[59] and, according to Ackroyd, he drew on memories of her for his later descriptions of Little Nell and Florence Dombey.[60] His grief was so great that he was unable to meet the deadline for the June instalment of _Pickwick Papers_ and had to cancel the _Oliver Twist_ instalment that month as well.[61] The time in Hampstead was the occasion for a growing bond between Dickens and John Forster to develop and Forster soon became his unofficial business manager, and the first to read his work.[62]

His success as a novelist continued. The young Queen Victoria read both _Oliver Twist_ and _Pickwick_, staying up until midnight to discuss them.[63] _Nicholas Nickleby_ (1838–39), _The Old Curiosity Shop_ (184041) and, finally, his first historical novel, _Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty_, as part of the _Master Humphrey's Clock_ series (1840–41), were all published in monthly instalments before being made into books.[64]

In the midst of all his activity during this period, there was discontent with his publishers and John Macrone was bought off, while Richard Bentley signed over all his rights in _Oliver Twist_. Other signs of a certain restlessness and discontent emerge—in Broadstairs he flirted with Eleanor Picken, the young fiancée of his solicitor's best friend, and one night grabbed her and ran with her down to the sea. He declared they were both to drown there in the "sad sea waves". She finally got free but afterwards kept her distance. In June 1841 he precipitously set out on a two-month tour of Scotland and then, in September 1841, telegraphed Forster that he had decided to go to America.[65] _Master Humphrey's Clock_ was shut down, though Dickens was still keen on the idea of the weekly magazine, a form he liked, a liking that had begun with his childhood reading of the eighteenth-century magazines _Tatler_ and _The Spectator_.

Dickens was perturbed by the return to power of the Tories, whom Dickens described as "people whom, politically, I despise and abhor."[66] He had been tempted to stand for the Liberals in Reading, but decided against it due to financial straits.[67] He wrote three anti-Tory verse satires ("The Fine Old English Gentleman", "The Quack Doctor's Proclamation", and "Subjects for Painters") which were published in _The Examiner_.[68]


First visit to the United States

On 22 January 1842, Dickens and his wife arrived in Boston, Massachusetts aboard the RMS _Britannia_ during their first trip to the United States and Canada.[69] At this time Georgina Hogarth, another sister of Catherine, joined the Dickens household, now living at Devonshire Terrace, Marylebone, to care for the young family they had left behind.[70] She remained with them as housekeeper, organiser, adviser, and friend until Dickens's death in 1870.[71] Dickens modelled the character of Agnes Wickfield after Georgina and Mary.[72]

He described his impressions in a travelogue, _American Notes for General Circulation_. In _Notes,_ Dickens includes a powerful condemnation of slavery which he had attacked as early as _The Pickwick Papers_, correlating the emancipation of the poor in England with the abolition of slavery abroad[73] citing newspaper accounts of runaway slaves disfigured by their masters. In spite of the abolitionist sentiments gleaned from his trip to America, some modern commentators have pointed out inconsistencies in Dickens's views on racial inequality, for instance, he has been criticized for his subsequent acquiescence in Governor Eyre's harsh crackdown during the 1860s Morant Bay rebellion in Jamaica and his failure to join other British progressives in condemning it.[74] From Richmond, Virginia, Dickens returned to Washington, D.C., and started a trek westward to St. Louis, Missouri. While there, he expressed a desire to see an American prairie before returning east. A group of 13 men then set out with Dickens to visit Looking Glass Prairie, a trip 30 miles into Illinois.

During his American visit, Dickens spent a month in New York City, giving lectures, raising the question of international copyright laws and the pirating of his work in America.[75][76] He persuaded a group of twenty-five writers, headed by Washington Irving, to sign a petition for him to take to Congress, but the press were generally hostile to this, saying that he should be grateful for his popularity and that it was mercenary to complain about his work being pirated.[77]

The popularity he gained caused a shift in his self-perception according to critic Kate Flint, who writes that he "found himself a cultural commodity, and its circulation had passed out his control", causing him to become interested in and delve into themes of public and personal personas in the next novels.[78] She writes that he assumed a role of "influential commentator", publicly and in his fiction, evident in his next few books.[79] His trip to the U.S. ended with a trip to Canada: Niagara Falls, Toronto, Kingston and Montreal where he appeared on stage in light comedies.[80]

, 1843. Painted during the period when he was writing _A Christmas Carol_, it was in the Royal Academy of Arts' 1844 summer exhibition. After viewing it there, Elizabeth Barrett Browning said that it showed Dickens with "the dust and mud of humanity about him, notwithstanding those eagle eyes".[81]]] Soon after his return to England, Dickens began work on the first of his Christmas stories, _A Christmas Carol_, written in 1843, which was followed by _The Chimes_ in 1844 and _The Cricket on the Hearth_ in 1845. Of these, _A Christmas Carol_ was most popular and, tapping into an old tradition, did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas in Britain and America.[82] The seeds for the story became planted in Dickens's mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there. This, along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane Ragged School, caused Dickens to resolve to "strike a sledge hammer blow" for the poor. As the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest, Dickens became engrossed in the book. He later wrote that as the tale unfolded he "wept and laughed, and wept again" as he "walked about the black streets of London fifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to bed."[83]

After living briefly in Italy (1844), Dickens travelled to Switzerland (1846), where he began work on _Dombey and Son_ (1846–48). This and _David Copperfield_ (1849–50) mark a significant artistic break in Dickens's career as his novels became more serious in theme and more carefully planned than his early works.

At about this time, he was made aware of a large embezzlement at the firm where his brother, Augustus, worked (John Chapman & Co.). It had been carried out by Thomas Powell, a clerk, who was on friendly terms with Dickens and who had acted as mentor to Augustus when he started work. Powell was also an author and poet and knew many of the famous writers of the day. After further fraudulent activities, Powell fled to New York and published a book called _The Living Authors of England_ with a chapter on Charles Dickens, who was not amused by what Powell had written. One item that seemed to have annoyed him was the assertion that he had based the character of Paul Dombey (_Dombey and Son_) on Thomas Chapman, one of the principal partners at John Chapman & Co. Dickens immediately sent a letter to Lewis Gaylord Clark, editor of the New York literary magazine _The Knickerbocker_, saying that Powell was a forger and thief. Clark published the letter in the _New-York Tribune_, and several other papers picked up on the story. Powell began proceedings to sue these publications, and Clark was arrested. Dickens, realising that he had acted in haste, contacted John Chapman & Co. to seek written confirmation of Powell's guilt. Dickens did receive a reply confirming Powell's embezzlement, but once the directors realised this information might have to be produced in court, they refused to make further disclosures. Owing to the difficulties of providing evidence in America to support his accusations, Dickens eventually made a private settlement with Powell out of court.[84]


Philanthropy

Angela Burdett Coutts, heir to the Coutts banking fortune, approached Dickens in May 1846 about setting up a home for the redemption of fallen women of the working class. Coutts envisioned a home that would replace the punitive regimes of existing institutions with a reformative environment conducive to education and proficiency in domestic household chores. After initially resisting, Dickens eventually founded the home, named "Urania Cottage", in the Lime Grove section of Shepherds Bush, which he managed for ten years,[85] setting the house rules, reviewing the accounts and interviewing prospective residents.[86] Emigration and marriage were central to Dickens's agenda for the women on leaving Urania Cottage, from which it is estimated that about 100 women graduated between 1847 and 1859.[87]


Religious views

As a young man Dickens expressed a distaste for certain aspects of organised religion. In 1836, in a pamphlet titled _Sunday Under Three Heads_, he defended the people's right to pleasure, opposing a plan to prohibit games on Sundays. "Look into your churches- diminished congregations and scanty attendance. People have grown sullen and obstinate, and are becoming disgusted with the faith which condemns them to such a day as this, once in every seven. They display their feeling by staying away [from church]. Turn into the streets [on a Sunday] and mark the rigid gloom that reigns over everything around."[88][89]

Dickens honoured the figure of though some claim he may have denied his divinity.[90] Notwithstanding, Dickens has been characterized as a professing Christian.[91] His son, Henry Fielding Dickens, described Dickens as someone who "possessed deep religious convictions". In the early 1840s, Dickens had shown an interest in Unitarian Christianity, and Robert Browning remarked that “Mr Dickens is an enlightened Unitarian.”[92] Writer Gary Colledge, however, asserted that he "never strayed from his attachment to popular lay Anglicanism".[93] He also wrote a religious work called _The Life of Our Lord_ (1846), which was a short book about the life of Jesus Christ, written with the purpose of sharing his faith with his children and family.[94][95]

Dickens disapproved of Roman Catholicism and 19th-century evangelicalism, seeing both as extremes of Christianity and likely to limit personal expression, and was critical of what he saw as the hypocrisy of religious institutions and philosophies like spiritualism, all of which he considered deviations from the true spirit of Christianity, as shown in the book he wrote for his family in 1846.[96] Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky referred to Dickens as "that great Christian writer".[97][98]

reaches Canterbury, from _David Copperfield_. The character incorporates many elements of Dickens’s own life. Artwork by Frank Reynolds.]] In December 1845, Dickens took up the editorship of the London-based _Daily News_, a liberal paper through which Dickens hoped to advocate, in his own words, "the Principles of Progress and Improvement, of Education and Civil and Religious Liberty and Equal Legislation."[99] Among the other contributors Dickens chose to write for the paper were the radical economist Thomas Hodgskin and social reformer Douglas William Jerrold, who frequently attacked the Corn Laws.[100][101] Dickens lasted only ten weeks on the job before resigning due to a combination of exhaustion and frustration with one of the paper's co-owners.[102]

The Francophile Dickens often holidayed in France, and in a speech delivered in Paris in 1846 in French called the French "the first people in the universe".[103] During his visit to Paris, Dickens met the French literati Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, Eugène Scribe, Théophile Gautier, François-René de Chateaubriand and Eugène Sue.[104] In early 1849, Dickens started to write _David Copperfield_. It was published between 1849 and 1850. In Dickens’ biography, _Life of Charles Dickens_ (1872), John Forster wrote of _David Copperfield_, “underneath the fiction lay something of the author’s life.”[105] It was Dickens's personal favourite among his own novels, as he wrote in the author's preface to the 1867 edition of the novel.[106]

In late November 1851, Dickens moved into Tavistock House where he wrote _Bleak House_ (1852–53), _Hard Times_ (1854), and _Little Dorrit_ (1856).[107] It was here that he indulged in the amateur theatricals described in Forster's _Life_.[108] During this period he worked closely with the novelist and playwright Wilkie Collins. In 1856, his income from writing allowed him to buy Gad's Hill Place in Higham, Kent. As a child, Dickens had walked past the house and dreamed of living in it. The area was also the scene of some of the events of Shakespeare's _Henry IV, Part 1_, and this literary connection pleased him.[109]

, 1858]]

In 1857, Dickens hired professional actresses for the play _The Frozen Deep_, written by him and his protégé, Wilkie Collins. Dickens fell in love with one of the actresses, Ellen Ternan, and this passion was to last the rest of his life.[110] Dickens was 45 and Ternan 18 when he made the decision, which went strongly against Victorian convention, to separate from his wife, Catherine, in 1858—divorce was still unthinkable for someone as famous as he was. When Catherine left, never to see her husband again, she took with her one child, leaving the other children to be raised by her sister Georgina who chose to stay at Gad's Hill.[111]

During this period, whilst pondering a project to give public readings for his own profit, Dickens was approached through a charitable appeal by Great Ormond Street Hospital, to help it survive its first major financial crisis. His 'Drooping Buds' essay in _Household Words_ earlier on 3 April 1852 was considered by the hospital's founders to have been the catalyst for the hospital's success.[112] Dickens, whose philanthropy was well-known, was asked by his friend, the hospital's founder Charles West, to preside over the appeal, and he threw himself into the task, heart and soul.[113] Dickens's public readings secured sufficient funds for an endowment to put the hospital on a sound financial footing—one reading on 9 February 1858 alone raised £3,000.[114][115][116]

After separating from Catherine,[117] Dickens undertook a series of hugely popular and remunerative reading tours which, together with his journalism, were to absorb most of his creative energies for the next decade, in which he was to write only two more novels.[118] His first reading tour, lasting from April 1858 to February 1859, consisted of 129 appearances in 49 different towns throughout England, Scotland and Ireland.[119] Dickens's continued fascination with the theatrical world was written into the theatre scenes in _Nicholas Nickleby_, but more importantly he found an outlet in public readings. In 1866, he undertook a series of public readings in England and Scotland, with more the following year in England and Ireland.

Other works soon followed, including _A Tale of Two Cities_ (1859) and _Great Expectations_ (1861), which were resounding successes. During this time he was also the publisher, editor, and a major contributor to the journals _Household Words_ (1850–1859) and _All the Year Round_ (1858–1870).[120]

In early September 1860, in a field behind Gad's Hill, Dickens made a bonfire of most of his correspondence—only those letters on business matters were spared. Since Ellen Ternan also destroyed all of his letters to her,[121] the extent of the affair between the two remains speculative.[122] In the 1930s, Thomas Wright recounted that Ternan had unburdened herself to a Canon Benham, and gave currency to rumours they had been lovers.[123] That the two had a son who died in infancy was alleged by Dickens's daughter, Kate Perugini, whom Gladys Storey had interviewed before her death in 1929. Storey published her account in _Dickens and Daughter_,[124][125] but no contemporary evidence exists. On his death, Dickens settled an annuity on Ternan which made her a financially independent woman. Claire Tomalin's book, _The Invisible Woman_, argues that Ternan lived with Dickens secretly for the last 13 years of his life. The book was subsequently turned into a play, _Little Nell_, by Simon Gray, and a 2013 film. In the same period, Dickens furthered his interest in the paranormal, becoming one of the early members of The Ghost Club.[126]

In June 1862, he was offered £10,000 for a reading tour of Australia.[127] He was enthusiastic, and even planned a travel book, _The Uncommercial Traveller Upside Down_, but ultimately decided against the tour.[128] Two of his sons, Alfred D'Orsay Tennyson Dickens and Edward Bulwer Lytton Dickens, migrated to Australia, Edward becoming a member of the Parliament of New South Wales as Member for Wilcannia between 1889 and 1894.[129][130]


Last years

On 9 June 1865, while returning from Paris with Ellen Ternan, Dickens was involved in the Staplehurst rail crash. The train's first seven carriages plunged off a cast iron bridge that was under repair. The only first-class carriage to remain on the track was the one in which Dickens was travelling. Before rescuers arrived, Dickens tended and comforted the wounded and the dying with a flask of brandy and a hat refreshed with water, and saved some lives. Before leaving, he remembered the unfinished manuscript for _Our Mutual Friend_, and he returned to his carriage to retrieve it.[131] Dickens later used this experience as material for his short ghost story, "The Signal-Man", in which the central character has a premonition of his own death in a rail crash. He also based the story on several previous rail accidents, such as the Clayton Tunnel rail crash of 1861. Dickens managed to avoid an appearance at the inquest to avoid disclosing that he had been travelling with Ternan and her mother, which would have caused a scandal.[132]


Second visit to the United States

, New York City in 1867]] While he contemplated a second visit to the United States, the outbreak of the Civil War in America in 1861 delayed his plans. On 9 November 1867, over two years after the war, Dickens set sail from Liverpool for his second American reading tour. Landing at Boston, he devoted the rest of the month to a round of dinners with such notables as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and his American publisher, James Thomas Fields. In early December, the readings began. He performed 76 readings, netting £19,000, from December 1867 to April 1868.[133] Dickens shuttled between Boston and New York, where he gave 22 readings at Steinway Hall. Although he had started to suffer from what he called the "true American catarrh", he kept to a schedule that would have challenged a much younger man, even managing to squeeze in some sleighing in Central Park.[134] dated 4 February 1869, two months before he suffered a mild stroke]]

During his travels, he saw a change in the people and the circumstances of America. His final appearance was at a banquet the American Press held in his honour at Delmonico's on 18 April, when he promised never to denounce America again. By the end of the tour Dickens could hardly manage solid food, subsisting on champagne and eggs beaten in sherry. On 23 April he boarded the Cunard liner to return to Britain,[135] barely escaping a Federal Tax Lien against the proceeds of his lecture tour.[136]


Farewell readings

Between 1868 and 1869, Dickens gave a series of "farewell readings" in England, Scotland, and Ireland, beginning on 6 October. He managed, of a contracted 100 readings, to deliver 75 in the provinces, with a further 12 in London.[137] As he pressed on he was affected by giddiness and fits of paralysis. He suffered a stroke on 18 April 1869 in Chester.[138] He collapsed on 22 April 1869, at Preston in Lancashire, and on doctor's advice, the tour was cancelled.[139] After further provincial readings were cancelled, he began work on his final novel, _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_. It was fashionable in the 1860s to 'do the slums' and, in company, Dickens visited opium dens in Shadwell, where he witnessed an elderly addict known as "Laskar Sal", who formed the model for the "Opium Sal" subsequently featured in his mystery novel, _Edwin Drood_.[140]

After Dickens had regained sufficient strength, he arranged, with medical approval, for a final series of readings to partially make up to his sponsors what they had lost due to his illness. There were to be 12 performances, running between 11 January and 15 March 1870, the last at 8:00 pm at St. James's Hall in London. Although in grave health by this time, he read _A Christmas Carol_ and _The Trial from Pickwick_. On 2 May, he made his last public appearance at a Royal Academy Banquet in the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales, paying a special tribute on the death of his friend, the illustrator Daniel Maclise.[141]


Death

—_The Empty Chair_. Fildes was illustrating _Edwin Drood_ at the time of Charles Dickens's death. The engraving shows Dickens's empty chair in his study at Gads Hill Place. It appeared in the Christmas 1870 edition of _The Graphic_ and thousands of prints of it were sold.[142]]]

On 8 June 1870, Dickens suffered another stroke at his home after a full day's work on _Edwin Drood_. He never regained consciousness, and the next day, five years to the day after the Staplehurst rail crash, he died at Gads Hill Place. Biographer Claire Tomalin has suggested Dickens was actually in Peckham when he suffered the stroke, and his mistress Ellen Ternan and her maids had him taken back to Gad's Hill so the public would not know the truth about their relationship.[143] Contrary to his wish to be buried at Rochester Cathedral "in an inexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly private manner",[144] he was laid to rest in the Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey. A printed epitaph circulated at the time of the funeral reads:

His last words were: "On the ground", in response to his sister-in-law Georgina's request that he lie down.[145] On Sunday, 19 June 1870, five days after Dickens was buried in the Abbey, Dean Arthur Penrhyn Stanley delivered a memorial elegy, lauding "the genial and loving humorist whom we now mourn", for showing by his own example "that even in dealing with the darkest scenes and the most degraded characters, genius could still be clean, and mirth could be innocent". Pointing to the fresh flowers that adorned the novelist's grave, Stanley assured those present that "the spot would thenceforth be a sacred one with both the New World and the Old, as that of the representative of literature, not of this island only, but of all who speak our English tongue."[146]

In his will, drafted more than a year before his death, Dickens left the care of his £80,000 estate to his longtime colleague John Forster and his "best and truest friend" Georgina Hogarth who, along with Dickens's two sons, also received a tax-free sum of £8,000 (about £800,000 in present terms). Although Dickens and his wife had been separated for several years at the time of his death, he provided her with an annual income of £600 and made her similar allowances in his will. He also bequeathed £19 19s to each servant in his employment at the time of his death.[147]


Literary style

Dickens's approach to the novel is influenced by various things, including the picaresque novel tradition,[148] melodrama,[149] and the novel of sensibility.[150] According to Ackroyd, other than these, perhaps the most important literary influence on him was derived from the fables of _The Arabian Nights_.[151] Satire and irony, are central to the picaresque novel.[152] Comedy is also an aspect of the British picaresque novel tradition of Laurence Sterne, Henry Fielding, and Tobias Smollett. Fielding's _Tom Jones_[153][154] was a major influence on the nineteenth novel including Dickens, who read it in his youth,[155] and named a son Henry Fielding Dickens in his honour.[156][157] Melodrama is typically sensational and designed to appeal strongly to the emotions.

His writing style is marked by a profuse linguistic creativity.[158] Satire, flourishing in his gift for caricature, is his forte. An early reviewer compared him to Hogarth for his keen practical sense of the ludicrous side of life, though his acclaimed mastery of varieties of class idiom may in fact mirror the conventions of contemporary popular theatre.[159] Dickens worked intensively on developing arresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations for his readers, and assist the development of motifs in the storyline, giving what one critic calls an "allegorical impetus" to the novels' meanings.[160] To cite one of numerous examples, the name Mr Murdstone in _David Copperfield_ conjures up twin allusions to "murder" and stony coldness.[161] His literary style is also a mixture of fantasy and realism. His satires of British aristocratic snobbery—he calls one character the "Noble Refrigerator"—are often popular. Comparing orphans to stocks and shares, people to tug boats, or dinner-party guests to furniture are just some of Dickens's acclaimed flights of fancy.

The author worked closely with his illustrators, supplying them with a summary of the work at the outset and thus ensuring that his characters and settings were exactly how he envisioned them. He briefed the illustrator on plans for each month's instalment so that work could begin before he wrote them. Marcus Stone, illustrator of _Our Mutual Friend_, recalled that the author was always "ready to describe down to the minutest details the personal characteristics, and ... life-history of the creations of his fancy".[162]

Characters

Dickens's biographer Claire Tomalin regards him as the greatest creator of character in English fiction after Shakespeare.[163] Dickensian characters are amongst the most memorable in English literature, especially so because of their typically whimsical names. The likes of Ebenezer Scrooge, Tiny Tim, Jacob Marley, Bob Cratchit, Oliver Twist, The Artful Dodger, Fagin, Bill Sikes, Pip, Miss Havisham, Sydney Carton, Charles Darnay, David Copperfield, Mr Micawber, Abel Magwitch, Daniel Quilp, Samuel Pickwick, Wackford Squeers, and Uriah Heep are so well known as to be part and parcel of popular culture, and in some cases have passed into ordinary language: a _scrooge_, for example, is a miser – or someone who dislikes Christmas festivity.[164]

from _Oliver Twist_]] His characters were often so memorable that they took on a life of their own outside his books. "Gamp" became a slang expression for an umbrella from the character Mrs Gamp, and "Pickwickian", "Pecksniffian", and "Gradgrind" all entered dictionaries due to Dickens's original portraits of such characters who were, respectively, quixotic, hypocritical, and vapidly factual. Many were drawn from real life: Mrs Nickleby is based on his mother, though she didn't recognise herself in the portrait,[165] just as Mr Micawber is constructed from aspects of his father's 'rhetorical exuberance':[166] Harold Skimpole in _Bleak House_ is based on James Henry Leigh Hunt: his wife's dwarfish chiropodist recognised herself in Miss Mowcher in _David Copperfield_.[167][168] Perhaps Dickens's impressions on his meeting with Hans Christian Andersen informed the delineation of Uriah Heep.[169]

Virginia Woolf maintained that "we remodel our psychological geography when we read Dickens" as he produces "characters who exist not in detail, not accurately or exactly, but abundantly in a cluster of wild yet extraordinarily revealing remarks".[170] One "character" vividly drawn throughout his novels is London itself.[171] Dickens described London as a magic lantern, inspiring the places and people in many of his novels.[172] From the coaching inns on the outskirts of the city to the lower reaches of the Thames, all aspects of the capital – Dickens' London – are described over the course of his body of work.[173]

Autobiographical elements

from the novel _David Copperfield_, which is widely regarded as Dickens's most autobiographical work]]

Authors frequently draw their portraits of characters from people they have known in real life. _David Copperfield_ is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of Dickens. The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in _Bleak House_ reflect Dickens's experiences as a law clerk and court reporter, and in particular his direct experience of the law's procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright.[174] Dickens's father was sent to prison for debt, and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in _Little Dorrit_ resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution.[175] Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart, may have affected several of Dickens's portraits of girls such as Little Em'ly in _David Copperfield_ and Lucie Manette in _A Tale of Two Cities._[176]

Dickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences, but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor. Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death, when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated. Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt, some critics have detected in his portrait features of Dickens's own character, which he sought to exorcise by self-parody.[177]

Episodic writing

'' from December 1860 to August 1861]] A pioneer of serialised fiction, most of Dickens's major novels were first written in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as _Master Humphrey's Clock_ and _Household Words_, later reprinted in book form.[178][179] These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible, and the series of regular cliffhangers made each new episode widely anticipated.[180] When _The Old Curiosity Shop_ was being serialised, American fans waited at the docks in New York harbor, shouting out to the crew of an incoming British ship, "Is little Nell dead?"[181] Dickens's talent was to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end.

'', 7 December 1867]]

Another important impact of Dickens's episodic writing style resulted from his exposure to the opinions of his readers and friends. His friend Forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts, an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation. He toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations, cut long passages (such as the episode of Quilp's drowning in _The Old Curiosity Shop_), and made suggestions about plot and character. It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in _Oliver Twist_. Dickens had not thought of killing Little Nell, and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine.[182]

Dickens's serialisation of his novels was criticised by other authors. In Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson's novel _The Wrecker_, there is a comment by Captain Nares, investigating an abandoned ship: "See! They were writing up the log," said Nares, pointing to the ink-bottle. "Caught napping, as usual. I wonder if there ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his log-book up to date? He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break, like Charles Dickens and his serial novels."[183]

Social commentary

(left) from _Martin Chuzzlewit_ became a stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the early Victorian era, before the reforms of Florence Nightingale]] Dickens's novels were, among other things, works of social commentary. He was a fierce critic of the poverty and social stratification of Victorian society. In a New York address, he expressed his belief that "Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen".[184] Dickens's second novel, _Oliver Twist_ (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it challenged middle class polemics about criminals, making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed.[185][186]

At a time when Britain was the major economic and political power of the world, Dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged within society. Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues—such as sanitation and the workhouse—but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities. He often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist, but flourished as a result. His most strident indictment of this condition is in _Hard Times_ (1854), Dickens's only novel-length treatment of the industrial working class. In this work, he uses vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed "Hands" by the factory owners; that is, not really "people" but rather only appendages of the machines they operated. His writings inspired others, in particular journalists and political figures, to address such problems of class oppression. For example, the prison scenes in _The Pickwick Papers_ are claimed to have been influential in having the Fleet Prison shut down. Karl Marx asserted that Dickens "issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together".[187] George Bernard Shaw even remarked that _Great Expectations_ was more seditious than Marx's _Das Kapital_.[188] The exceptional popularity of Dickens's novels, even those with socially oppositional themes (_Bleak House_, 1853; _Little Dorrit_, 1857; _Our Mutual Friend_, 1865), not only underscored his ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters, but also ensured that the Victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored. It has been argued that his technique of flooding his narratives with an 'unruly superfluity of material' that, in the gradual dénouement, yields up an unsuspected order, influenced the organisation of Charles Darwin's _On the Origin of Species_.[189]

Literary techniques

Dickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his caricatures and the ugly social truths he reveals. The story of Nell Trent in _The Old Curiosity Shop_ (1841) was received as extraordinarily moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by Oscar Wilde. "One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell", he said in a famous remark, "without dissolving into tears...of laughter."[190][191] G. K. Chesterton stated, "It is not the death of little Nell, but the life of little Nell, that I object to", arguing that the maudlin effect of his description of her life owed much to the gregarious nature of Dickens's grief, his "despotic" use of people's feelings to move them to tears in works like this.[192]

The question as to whether Dickens belongs to the tradition of the sentimental novel is debatable. Valerie Purton, in her book _Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition_, sees him continuing aspects of this tradition, and argues that his "sentimental scenes and characters [are] as crucial to the overall power of the novels as his darker or comic figures and scenes", and that "_Dombey and Son_ is [ ... ] Dickens's greatest triumph in the sentimentalist tradition".[193] The _Encyclopædia Britannica_ online comments that, despite "patches of emotional excess", such as the reported death of Tiny Tim in _A Christmas Carol_ (1843), "Dickens cannot really be termed a sentimental novelist".[194]

In _Oliver Twist_ Dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young pickpockets. While later novels also centre on idealised characters (Esther Summerson in _Bleak House_ and Amy Dorrit in _Little Dorrit_), this idealism serves only to highlight Dickens's goal of poignant social commentary. Dickens's fiction, reflecting what he believed to be true of his own life, makes frequent use of coincidence, either for comic effect or to emphasise the idea of providence.[195] For example, Oliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper-class family that rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group. Such coincidences are a staple of 18th-century picaresque novels, such as Henry Fielding's _Tom Jones,_ which Dickens enjoyed reading as a youth.[196]


Reputation

, Ottawa, Canada]] Dickens was the most popular novelist of his time,[197] and remains one of the best-known and most-read of English authors. His works have never gone out of print,[198] and have been adapted continually for the screen since the invention of cinema,[199] with at least 200 motion pictures and TV adaptations based on Dickens's works documented.[200] Many of his works were adapted for the stage during his own lifetime, and as early as 1913, a silent film of _The Pickwick Papers_ was made.[201] He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest British novelist of the Victorian era.[202] The most popular works of Dickens since their publication have been, _The Pickwick Papers_, _Oliver Twist_, _Martin Chuzzlewit_, _A Christmas Carol_, and _David Copperfield_.[203]

Dickens's literary reputation, however began to decline with the publication of _Bleak House_ in 1852–3. Philip Collins calls _Bleak House_ ‘a crucial item in the history of Dickens's reputation. Reviewers and literary figures during the 1850s, '60s and '70s, saw a "drear decline" in Dickens, from a writer of "bright sunny comedy ... to dark and serious social" commentary.[204] _The Spectator_ called _Bleak House_ "a heavy book to read through at once … dull and wearisome as a serial"; Richard Simpson, in _The Rambler_, characterized _Hard Times_ as ‘this dreary framework’; _Fraser's Magazine_ thought _Little Dorrit_ ‘decidedly the worst of his novels’.[205] All the same, despite these "increasing reservations amongst reviewers and the chattering classes, ‘the public never deserted its favourite’". Dickens's popular reputation remained unchanged, sales continued to rise, and _Household Words_ and later _All the Year Round_ were highly successful.[206]

For 70 years after his death Dickens received remarkably little serious attention from the literary intelligentsia. Notable exceptions were George Gissing, _Charles Dickens: A Critical Study_, 1898), G. K. Chesterton, _Charles Dickens_, 1911, John Cowper Powys, _Visions and Revisions_, 1915, and George Bernard Shaw.[207][208]

Among fellow writers, Dickens there was a range of opinions. Poet laureate, William Wordsworth (1770 – 1850), thought him a "very talkative, vulgar young person", adding he had not read a line of his work, while novelist George Meredith (1828 – 1909), found Dickens "intellectually lacking".[209] In 1888 Leslie Stephen commented in the _Dictionary of National Biography_ that " if literary fame could be safely measured by popularity with the half-educated, Dickens must claim the highest position among English novelists".[210] Anthony Trollope's _Autobiography_ famously declared Thackeray, not Dickens, to be the greatest novelist of the age. However, both Leo Tolstoy[211] and Fyodor Dostoyevsky were admirers. Dostoyevsky commented: "We understand Dickens in Russia, I am convinced, almost as well as the English, perhaps even with all the nuances. It may well be that we love him no less than his compatriots do. And yet how original is Dickens, and how very English!".[212] French writer Jules Verne called Dickens his favourite writer, writing his novels "stand alone, dwarfing all others by their amazing power and felicity of expression."[213] Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh was inspired by Dickens's novels in several of his paintings like _Vincent's Chair_ and in an 1889 letter to his sister stated that reading Dickens, especially _A Christmas Carol_, was one of the things that was keeping him from committing suicide.[214] Oscar Wilde generally disparaged his depiction of character, while admiring his gift for caricature.[215] Henry James denied him a premier position, calling him "the greatest of superficial novelists": Dickens failed to endow his characters with psychological depth and the novels, "loose baggy monsters",[216] betrayed a "cavalier organisation".[217] Virginia Woolf had a love-hate relationship with his works, finding his novels "mesmerizing" while reproving him for his sentimentalism and a commonplace style.[218]

Around 1940–41 the attitude of the literary critics began to warm towards Dickens, led by George Orwell, _Inside the Whale and Other Essays_. March 1940, Edmund Wilson, _The Wound and the Bow_, 1941, and Humphry House, _Dickens and his World_.[219] But even in 1948, F. R. Leavis, in _The Great Tradition_, asserted that “the adult mind doesn’t as a rule find in Dickens a challenge to an unusual and sustained seriousness”; Dickens was indeed a great genius, “but the genius was that of a great entertainer,”[220] though he later changed his opinion with _Dickens the Novelist_ (1970) (with Q. D. (Queenie) Leavis): "Our purpose", they wrote, "is to enforce as unanswerably as possible the conviction that Dickens was one of the greatest of creative writers".[221]

In the 1950s, "a substantial reassessment and re-editing of the works began, and critics found his finest artistry and greatest depth to be in the later novels: _Bleak House_, _Little Dorrit_, and _Great Expectations_—and (less unanimously) in _Hard Times_ and _Our Mutual Friend_".[222] A favourite author of Roald Dahl’s, the best-selling children’s author would include three Dickens’ novels among those read by the title character in his 1988 novel _Matilda_.[223] On 7 February 2012, the 200th anniversary of Dickens's birth, Philip Womack wrote in the _Telegraph_: "Today there is no escaping Charles Dickens. Not that there has ever been much chance of that before. He has a deep, peculiar hold upon us".[224]


Influence and legacy

statue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in 2012]] Museums and festivals celebrating Dickens's life and works exist in many places with which Dickens was associated. These include the Charles Dickens Museum in London, the historic home where he wrote _Oliver Twist_, _The Pickwick Papers_ and _Nicholas Nickleby_; and the Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum in Portsmouth, the house in which he was born. The original manuscripts of many of his novels, as well as printers' proofs, first editions, and illustrations from the collection of Dickens's friend John Forster are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum.[225] Dickens's will stipulated that no memorial be erected in his honour; nonetheless, a life-size bronze statue of Dickens entitled _Dickens and Little Nell_, cast in 1891 by Francis Edwin Elwell, stands in Clark Park in the Spruce Hill neighbourhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Another life-size statue of Dickens is located at Centennial Park, Sydney, Australia.[226] In 2014, a life-size statue was unveiled near his birthplace in Portsmouth on the 202nd anniversary of his birth; this was supported by the author's great-great grandsons, Ian and Gerald Dickens.[227][228]

_A Christmas Carol_ is most probably his best-known story, with frequent new adaptations. It is also the most-filmed of Dickens's stories, with many versions dating from the early years of cinema.[229] According to the historian Ronald Hutton, the current state of the observance of Christmas is largely the result of a mid-Victorian revival of the holiday spearheaded by _A Christmas Carol_. Dickens catalysed the emerging Christmas as a family-centred festival of generosity, in contrast to the dwindling community-based and church-centred observations, as new middle-class expectations arose.[230] Its archetypal figures (Scrooge, Tiny Tim, the Christmas ghosts) entered into Western cultural consciousness. A prominent phrase from the tale, "Merry Christmas", was popularised following the appearance of the story.[231] The term Scrooge became a synonym for miser, and his dismissive exclamation 'Bah! Humbug!' likewise gained currency as an idiom.[232] Novelist William Makepeace Thackeray called the book "a national benefit, and to every man and woman who reads it a personal kindness".[233] in Broadstairs, Kent, where Dickens wrote some of his novels]]

Dickens was commemorated on the Series E £10 note issued by the Bank of England that circulated between 1992 and 2003. His portrait appeared on the reverse of the note accompanied by a scene from _The Pickwick Papers_. The Charles Dickens School is a high school in Broadstairs, Kent. A theme park, Dickens World, standing in part on the site of the former naval dockyard where Dickens's father once worked in the Navy Pay Office, opened in Chatham in 2007. To celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens in 2012, the Museum of London held the UK's first major exhibition on the author in 40 years.[234] In 2002, Dickens was number 41 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.[235] American literary critic Harold Bloom placed Dickens among the greatest Western Writers of all time.[236] In the UK survey The Big Read, carried out by the BBC in 2003, five of Dickens's books were named in the Top 100.[237]

Dickens and his publications have appeared on a number of postage stamps including: UK (1970, 1993, 2011 and 2012), Soviet Union (1962), Antigua, Barbuda, Botswana, Cameroon, Dubai, Fujairah, St Christopher, Nevis and Anguilla, St Helena, St Lucia and Turks and Caicos Islands (1970), St Vincent (1987), Nevis (2007), Alderney, Gibraltar, Jersey and Pitcairn Islands (2012), Austria (2013), Mozambique (2014).[238]

In November 2018 it was reported that a previously lost portrait of a 31-year-old Dickens, by Margaret Gillies, had been found in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Gillies was an early supporter of women's suffrage and had painted the portrait in late 1843 when Dickens, aged 31, wrote _A Christmas Carol_. It was exhibited, to acclaim, at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1844.[239]
