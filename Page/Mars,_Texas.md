MARS is a ghost town in Van Zandt County, Texas, United States.[1]

Once a retail center for the surrounding community, all that remains of the settlement is a church.


History

Mars was settled by brothers John and Henry Marrs.[2]

The settlement included a retail trading center, and had two mercantile stores, a blacksmith shop, a cotton gin and a grist mill.[3][4][5]

The Pleasant Ridge Church and school were established in Mars in 1871.[6] In 1916, the school consolidated to form the Clower Common School District (Clower is located approximately north of Mars).[7][8][9]

In 1891, a post office was established, originally called "Acme". The name was changed to "Mars" seven years later. The post office closed in 1907.[10][11]

The population of Mars was over 100 in 1915, and had declined to 50 in 1945.[12]

The Pleasant Ridge Church is now all that remains of the settlement.[13]
