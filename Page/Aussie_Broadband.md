AUSSIE BROADBAND is an Australian telecommunications carrier (ISP) that provides internet, web hosting, mobile and other telephony services. The company was formed in 2008 after the merger of Wideband Networks and Westvic Broadband.[1]

Wideband Networks was founded in the Latrobe Valley by Phillip Britt and John Reisinger, it exists as secondary brand servicing government and business/enterprise.

While primarily operating as a reseller of telecommunications services, Aussie Broadband operates its own wireless broadband network in some regional areas of Victoria and South Australia[2] and has equipment at 34[3] ADSL exchanges across some states of Australia. In late 2016, the company began implementing its own backhaul infrastructure to interface the NBN.[4][5]
