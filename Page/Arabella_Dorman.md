ARABELLA DORMAN (born 1975 in London)[1] is a British war artist and portrait painter.[2][3] She was chosen as one of the BBC's "100 Women" in 2014.[4]


Life

Dorman was born in 1975 in London. She studied at the Byam Shaw School of Art in London (since absorbed into Central Saint Martins) and the University of Edinburgh.[5] She is married to Dominic Elliot, a film maker.[6]

In 2006 Dorman was Britain's first official war artist to go to the front line in Iraq[7] after being invited by Lt Gen Richard Shirreff, who had purchased one of her works.[8] She started her time in Iraq with the Royal Green Jackets in Basra Palace, where she frequently came under enemy fire, then went to the desert near the Iranian border.[9] She spent time with British forces in Afghanistan in 2009-2014. In 2009 she was embedded with 2nd Battalion, The Rifles in Sangin, Helmand, though she was not allowed to accompany soldiers on patrol,[10] and in 2010 travelled within Afghanistan from her base in Kabul.[11]

She worked with refugees in Lesbos, Calais and Dunkirk in 2015 and 2016.[12] In December 2015 she created an art installation by suspending a dinghy, which had been used to transport refugees across the Mediterranean, from the roof of St James's Church, Piccadilly.[13][14] Called _Flight_, the exhibit was on display until February 2016, and related the flight of refugees to the ancient tradition of hanging boats from church roofs.[15]

Dorman has exhibited at venues including the Imperial War Museum, the Frost and Reed Gallery, and La Galleria Pall Mall.[16]
