JERWIN JUNTILLA ANCAJAS (born 1 January 1992) is a Filipino professional boxer. He has held the IBF junior bantamweight title since September 2016. As of July 2017, he is ranked as the sixth-best junior bantamweight in the world by The Ring[1], fifth by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board[2], and eighth by BoxRec.[3] Ancajas is the first world champion promoted by MP Promotions, a promotional company owned by Manny Pacquiao.[4] Ancajas currently trains and fights out of Philippine Marines training camp in ternate, cavite.

Jerwin was born and raised in Panabo, a suburb of Davao City, Philippines.[5] He was introduced to boxing in the second grade by his brother, Jesar. Jerwin would go on to win several national championships, including a gold medal at the Palarong Pambansa, before turning pro in 2009, at the age of 17.[6] Jerwin Ancajas has a 90-5 record in the Amateur Boxing.[7]


Professional career

Ancajas made his professional debut on July 2009. Ancajas suffered a loss in his fifteenth pro bout, losing a majority decision to Mark Anthony Geraldo.

He became the IBF junior bantamweight champion when he defeated McJoe Arroyo on September 3, 2016.[8] Ancajas earned just $3,750 for the fight.[9] He entered the fight on an 11-fight win streak.[10] Ancajas comfortably outboxed Arroyo, and dropped him in round 8 to win a unanimous decision.[11]

Ancajas made his first defense on January 29, 2017, beating José Alfredo Rodríguez by technical knockout, after Rodríguez was unable to continue due to injury.[12] Ancajas made a further defense on July 2017, on the undercard of Manny Pacquiao-Jeff Horn against Teiru Kinoshita. Ancajas battered Kinoshita, opening a cut over his right eye and pummeling him to the body, before dropping him in round 7 with a right hook to the body. Kinoshita beat the count but the referee stopped the fight, giving Ancajas a TKO win.[13] On November 18, 2017, Ancajas defeated Jamie Conlan with a round 6 TKO. Conlan was battered from the first round, going down after a body shot. He was dropped three more times until the referee stopped the fight. Ancajas was deducted a point in round 5 by referee Steve Gray, following a legitimate shot to Conlan's abdomen. With the win, Ancajas made his third successful title defense in 2017, all by technical knockout and in different countries.[14][15]

In December, it was announced that Ancajas had signed with Top Rank and would make his U.S. debut in February 2018, defending his title against Israel Gonzalez in Corpus Christi, Texas.[16]
