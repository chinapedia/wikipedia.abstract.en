Reception

_Booklist_ gave _Ketzel_ a star review, wrote "this delightfully told story is unlikely and adorable in equal parts.

It was also reviewed by the Jewish Book Council,[5] the _Jewish Journal_,[6] and the _Buffalo News_.[7]

_Ketzel_ won the 2016 Massachusetts Book Awards Picture Book/Early Reader Award,[8] and the 2016 Gold Sydney Taylor Book Award Younger Reader Category[9]
