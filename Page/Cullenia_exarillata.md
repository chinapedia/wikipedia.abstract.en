_CULLENIA EXARILLATA_ is a flowering plant evergreen tree species in the family Malvaceae endemic to the rainforests of the southern Western Ghats in India. It is one of the characteristic trees of the mid-elevation tropical wet evergreen rainforests and an important food plant for the endemic primate, the lion-tailed macaque.[1]


Description

Tall evergreen trees with smooth greyish white BARK, flaking in mature trees, with straight boles, frequently buttressed. The BRANCHES are horizontal often with series of knob-like tubercles (for cauliflorous attachment of flowers and fruits). The young BRANCHLETS and the underside of leaves are covered by golden brown peltate (or shield like) scales. LEAVES are simple, alternate, glabrous, shiny green above and covered beneath with silvery or orangish peltate scales.[2] The tubular, hermaphroditic FLOWERS (also covered by golden brown scales) are about 4–5 cm long and cream or pinkish brown in colour. The flowers lack petals and are formed of tubular bracteoles and tube-like calyx, obscurely 5-lobed. The round FRUITS, about 10–13 cm in diameter and covered with spines, are clustered along the branches. The fruit is a capsule, 5-valved, containing many reddish brown seeds about 4–5 cm long and 2–3 cm wide. In the fruit, the seeds are covered by a fleshy, whitish aril. The fruit dehisces open when mature and dry to release seeds.[3]


Taxonomy

The genus _Cullenia_ was created by Robert Wight and commemorates William Cullen with the type species _excelsa_ from India which Wight considered incorrectly as being identical to the Sri Lankan _C. ceylanica_ which was earlier described under the genus _Durio_. André Robyns examined Wight's specimen and fresh specimens from southern India and noted it as being distinct and described it as _C. exarillata_ in 1970. _C. ceylanica_ has the seeds covered by an aril whereas _C. exarillata_ does not have the aril surrounding the seeds.[4] The genus is evolutionarily close to _Boschia_ and _Durio_.[5]


Distribution and habitat

The species is characteristically found and dominant in the mid-elevation (700 m to 1400 m) tropical wet evergreen rainforests, which has been called the _Cullenia exarillata_ - _Mesua ferrea_ - _Palaquium ellipticum_ type.[6] It occurs from the southern tip of the Western Ghats in Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve and Agasthyamalai hills to Wayanad and Kodagu in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve.[7][8][9]


Breeding system and dispersal

The hermaphroditic (or bisexual) flowers are mainly pollinated by bats (_Cynopterus_ and _Rousettus_) and arboreal mammals (Lion-tailed Macaque, Brown Palm Civet, Indian Giant Squirrel, Nilgiri Langur, and Indian Giant Flying Squirrel).[10] These mammals and other rodents that visit the flowers such as Dusky-striped Squirrel and Malabar Spiny Dormouse also act as flower predators as they consume a substantial number of flowers.[11] The flowers are also visited by a number of bird species, including Oriental White-Eye, Square-tailed Bulbul, Yellow-browed Bulbul, Brown-cheeked Fulvetta, Common Rosefinch, Kerala Laughingthrush, and White-cheeked Barbet.[12] However, flowers visited by birds tend to be aborted.[13]

_Cullenia exarillata_ is an outcrossing species, producing negligible fruit-set under geitonogamy and no fruit-set under autogamy.[14] The seeds are mechanically dispersed (gravity)[15] as well as by Lion-tailed Macaques over short distances.


Ecology

_Cullenia exarillata_ is a dominant tree species in the mid-elevation tropical rainforests (between 700 and 1,400 m elevation) of the southern Western Ghats.[16] It is also among the most abundant canopy trees in relatively undisturbed mature wet evergreen forests.[17] Individual trees were estimated to produce between 1300 and 26000 flowers (average = 8734) chiefly between February and May, followed by a fruiting peak between May and September, in a rainforest in the southern end of the Western Ghats.[18] As the tree flowers abundantly during the dry season, a period of fruit scarcity in the forest, the flowers attract many diurnal and nocturnal frugivorous mammals and birds, making the tree a possible keystone species in these forests.[19] The flowers are low in nectar but contain fleshy sepals embedded with nectaries which are the main reward for animal visitors.[20] The flowers are eaten by endemic arboreal mammals such as Lion-tailed Macaque[21] and Brown Palm Civet.[22] The seeds and flowers of this species form a major part of the diet (20.7% of annual diet) of Lion-tailed Macaque in mid-elevation rainforests of Silent Valley National Park.[23] A seed predation rate of 45% has been estimated in a wet evergreen forest of the southern Western Ghats, caused by species such as Indian Giant squirrels that feed on unripe fruits (with softer spines) and Lion-tailed Macaques that feed on ripe fruits (with hard spines).[24]


Conservation

The species is endemic to the Western Ghats and has not yet been assessed for the IUCN Red List. The tree may persist in rainforest fragments showing similar levels of flowering and fruit-set, and may even have higher fruit-set in some disturbed sites and on isolated trees.[25] Highly disturbed sites, including plantations where understorey vegetation and canopy trees were removed, have lower density of _Cullenia exarillata_.[26]
