Plot

Rama Rao (Sundeep Kishan) is an aspiring police officer who was born in a police family - his great-grandfather, grandfather, and father have all served in the police department. To carry out the family legacy, he dreams of becoming an SI and serving the society, so he strives hard to achieve his goal. He, however, was not able to qualify for the job for various reasons. That is when he decides to perform the duties of a cop even without wearing the uniform.

Meanwhile, following a bomb blast that claims many innocent lives, Parasuramaiah IPS (Prakash Raj), the honest police commissioner of Hyderabad, vows to rid the city of terrorist activities. He forms a crack team led by dynamic cop Alexander IPS (Sai Dharam Tej) for the purpose. Meanwhile, Rama Rao gets into a tiff with Rahul (Tanish), the wayward son of Parasuramaiah.

How does this quarrel affect Rama Rao's aspirations of joining the force? Is Rama Rao able to realise his ambition or does he get bogged down by circumstances? How does he get connected to the larger picture of Alexander and his investigation? Is Parasuramaiah really the honest cop that he appears to be?
