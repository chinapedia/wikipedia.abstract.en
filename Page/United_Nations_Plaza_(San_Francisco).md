UNITED NATIONS PLAZA (often abbreviated to UN PLAZA or UNP) is a plaza located along the former alignment of Fulton Street in the block bounded by Market, Hyde, McAllister, and 7th in San Francisco's Civic Center, in the U.S. state of California. It is located east of City Hall, connected to another public open space, Civic Center Plaza, via the Fulton Mall, and close to the BART and Muni Metro station.[1]

UN Plaza was dedicated in 1975 to commemorate the formation of the United Nations via the signing of the Charter of the United Nations on 26 June 1945. It was designed by the noted architects John Carl Warnecke, Mario Ciampi, and Lawrence Halprin. Since its initial dedication, UN Plaza was updated in 1995 and 2005. Three redesign proposals were advanced for public review in spring 2018.


History

UN Plaza was installed during the reconstruction of Market Street following the cut-and-cover excavation for the Market Street Subway.[2] It was designed by Lawrence Halprin and opened in 1975.[3] Construction of the plaza was funded by a bond issued in 1968; work began in January 1975 and was completed by June 1975. Mayor Joseph Alioto dedicated the first tree on the plaza to honor the late UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld on June 26, 1975, the thirtieth anniversary of the signing of the U.N. Charter.[4]

The homeless in San Francisco have long occupied the site, dating back to before the construction of UN Plaza.[5] Since 1981, the Heart-of-the-City Farmers Market has been held at UN Plaza on Wednesdays and Sundays, which alleviated the food desert that otherwise existed in Civic Center and the South of Market neighborhoods.[6] In 1994, the fountain at UN Plaza was recommended for removal, as it had attracted a significant homeless population, was the site of bird droppings, public bathing, and public urination, and was called "out of scale", an assertion which was rejected by Halprin, the original designer.[7] An assessment completed in 1995 concluded the fountain was not operating as designed, as only a single pump was still working to supply the jets, and the filtration was completely defunct.[8] A "Walk of Great Ideas" was added to UN Plaza at a cost of , all funded through private donations, in 1995, the 50th anniversary of the United Nations.[9]

In the early 2000s, as an attempt to combat homelessness, the city removed the benches.[10] The city fenced off the fountain and stopped the water temporarily in March 2003 to alleviate the daily burden of cleaning used needles and human feces.[11] A working group commissioned by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors published a report that same month recommending the fountain be removed.[12][13] The renewed calls to remove the fountain were based on many of the same reasons as ten years prior; an article in _The New York Times_ published in 2004 called it "a public toilet, shower, washing machine, brothel, garbage can and drug market all in one".[14] Ultimately, the Board of Supervisors rejected the 2003 proposal,[15] and a new round of refurbishment started in March 2005 at a cost of .[16]

In 2017, CMG Landscape Architecture were hired by the city planning department to redesign UN Plaza along with the adjoining Civic Center Plaza and Fulton Market. The design goals of the Civic Center Public Realm Plan were to retain the civic scale but encourage pedestrian traffic from local residents and workers. CMG unveiled three proposals in spring 2018:[17]

1.  _Civic Sanctuary_, a design "that celebrates History" by evoking the Beaux-Arts spirit of the original plan.[18]
2.  _Culture Connector_, billed as "a vision for an inclusive commons that prioritizes Ecology, Wellness, and Variety" which includes additional trees to shade a promenade between Market and City Hall.[19]
3.  _Public Platform_, "centered on Performance" by creating flexible plazas for temporary activities.[20]

Of the three proposals, only _Civic Sanctuary_ calls for the restoration of the fountain at UN Plaza.[21] _Culture Connector_ would remove the water features and convert the fountain into a bouldering playground.[22] _Public Platform_ would install a new "iconic, interactive fountain" near the current site on Market.[23]


Design

United_Nations_Plaza_Obelisk.jpg In the 1962 report _What to do About Market Street_, Halprin described his initial vision for what would become UN Plaza: "... when the Hyde-Larkin block is reconstructed (as proposed in [the Civic Center Plan]), views into the Civic Center should be created. Thus our Civic Center, one of the most beautiful in America, could give tremendous support to Market Street."[24] Halprin designed UN Plaza as a joint venture with Warnecke and Ciampi under the Market Street/Civic Center Station project.[25] That trio were also responsible for the design of the earlier Hallidie Plaza (1973) next to the station.[26] UN Plaza was originally known as the CIVIC CENTER STATION PLAZA according to the 1967 _Market Street Design Plan_ written by Warnecke and Ciampi, which called for "a major civic sculpture" to dominate "the central space and [create] the focus for the activities of the Plaza".[27] The commission for that sculpture became the fountain by Halprin.

In the original design, UN Plaza features included:[28]

-   of brick paving, laid in a herringbone pattern

-   of grass lawn

-   16 light standards
-   24 wood slate benches along the outer edges
-   192 London plane and poplar trees
-   a large fountain executed in granite slabwork

When Civic Center was nominated for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), UN Plaza was noted to provide "a pedestrian approach to the Civic Center and a clear view from Market Street to City Hall."[29] UN Plaza is eligible on its own design merits for inclusion on the NRHP and San Francisco also considers it eligible for inclusion on the California Register of Historic Resources for its original design merits in addition to its historic role in the LGBTQ movement as the site of parades and protests.[30]

For the 50th anniversary of the signing of the U.N. Charter in 1995, a "Walk of Great Ideas" designed by Andrew Detsch was added to UN Plaza.[31] The Walk consisted of eight white granite paving stones inlaid with the preamble to the U.N. Charter in brass, inscribing a list of the member nations on the light standards, adding the U.N. emblem to the center of the plaza, and engraving the preamble for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on an existing tall black granite obelisk, along with new lighting fixtures.[32][33][34]

A second round of refurbishment kicked off in 2005 for the 60th anniversary; planned improvements included a new stone monument to commemorate UN World Environment Day 2005, hanging the flags of all 191 member nations, and the inscription of new member nation names on the light standards. In addition, the city began to increase the number of events booked for the plaza to encourage "a healthy, vibrant environment that anybody can enjoy."[35][36]

Fountain

UN Plaza Fountain was also designed by Halprin.[37] For Halprin & Associates, Don Carter was principal-in-charge and Angela Danadjieva (who later served as lead designer for Freeway Park in Seattle) was the landscape architect.[38] The granite slabs are intended to symbolize the continents of Earth, and the lowest central block symbolizes a mythical lost continent. According to the original design, water floods and is subsequently drained from the basin on a two-minute cycle to simulate the ocean's tides. Aerial jets make the fountain's location visible from the street, and also alert spectators to the start of a new flood/drain cycle.[39] Computer-controlled features were intended to detect winds and attenuate pump output accordingly, to avoid splashing passers-by.[40]

The fountain is largely sunken into the surrounding brick plaza with a basin wide, it contains 673 granite blocks over a total length of ; the cost was .[41] Several blocks are inscribed; one carries a quotation from Franklin Delano Roosevelt.[42] According to Halprin, the fountain was meant to be "a place to walk to, sit down, do theater in"[43] and claimed to have created the first space that could actually be used by the public.[44] Bollards and chains were added around the fountain in the 2005 renovation to prohibit public entry into the fountain,[45] but have since been removed.[46] Because the fountain is registered with the city as part of its civic art collection, removing the fountain would require extensive reviews and public hearings.[47]


Reception

Upon its unveiling, Allan Temko, architecture critic for the local _San Francisco Chronicle_, declared the fountain was "pretentious schmaltz" that "rarely work[s] and merely toss[es] around empty muscatel bottles."[48][49] Andrew Young, United States Ambassador to the United Nations, called the fountain "a tribute to the U.N.'s goals of seeking peaceful resolutions to international rivalries" at its 1975 dedication.[50] In a 2007 retrospective, current _Chronicle_ architecture critic John King collectively said the "mannered drama of [Halprin's] plazas along Market Street" "haven't aged well".[51]
