TYPHOON SARIKA, known in the Philippines as TYPHOON KAREN, was a powerful tropical cyclone which affected the Philippines, China and Vietnam in mid October 2016. It was the twenty first named storm and the tenth typhoon of the annual Pacific typhoon season.


Meteorological history

Sarika was first noted by the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center as a tropical disturbance during October 11, while it was located about to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines.[1] At the time deep atmospheric convection was moving and expanding, over the system's elongated and ill-defined low level circulation centre.[2] During that day the system's low level circulation centre rapidly consolidated and became more defined within a favourable environment for further development, which consisted of low vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures of about .[3] As a result of this the Japan Meteorological Agency started to monitor the system as a tropical depression, while the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the depression.[4][5] During October 12, as the system moved along a low to mid level reflection of the subtropical ridge of high pressure, it was classified as Tropical Depression 24W by the JTWC, while PAGASA named the system Karen.[6][7]

By October 13, images depicted its LLCC and described it as "broad", and Karen was located in an area of high sea surface temperatures of 31 °C (88 °F).[8] Hours later, both agencies upgraded Karen to a tropical storm, with the JMA naming it as _Sarika_.[9][10] Despite the system has maintained its intensity at that time, deep convection had increased and formative banding started to wrap into its center.[11] Sarika was upgraded into a severe tropical storm by the JMA three hours later.[12] Several hours later, Sarika started to form an eye feature, and the JMA upgraded Sarika to a typhoon.[13][14] After imagery had depicted a significant organisation of convection around the system, the JTWC upgraded Sarika to a Category 1 typhoon.[15] By October 15, the JTWC stated that Sarika had expanded and deepened with a wide ragged eye present, and upgraded it into a Category 2 typhoon.[16] Within their next advisory, it was reported that Sarika had strengthened into a Category 3 typhoon.[17] Sarika reached its peak intensity as a Category 4 typhoon with 1-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935 mbar.[18][19] Early on October 16, PAGASA had stated that Sarika had made landfall over in Baler, Aurora.[20] Dramatic weakening occurred as Sarika traversed the islands, by the time the storm entered the South China Sea.[21] After moving westward rapidly for two days, Sarika weakened to a severe tropical storm as it made landfall over in Hainan.[22][23] By October 19, imagery depicted that Sarika was rapidly deteriorating as it made its final landfall over in the coastline and border of Vietnam and China, while the JTWC issued its final advisory.[24] The JMA followed suit three hours later and dissipated in the same day.[25][26]


Preparations and Impact

Philippines

On October 15, signal number 3 was raised throughout the area of Catanduanes.[27] NDRRMC confirmed a total of 6 people dead, 26 missing and recorded damages up to ₱3.86 billion (US$79.7 million).[28][29]

China

Even some crops in the northeast part of Hainan were damaged, particularly banana, cassava, and papaya. Only 1 person was killed, and total economic losses in South China were counted to be ¥5.3 billion (US$786 million).[30]

Vietnam

Flash flooding from Sarika caused 60 casualties in Vietnam.[31] 30 people were killed and 30 other people were injured, according to news released by official media on October 20.[32] 120 thousand houses, hospitals, schools and other facilities were severely damaged, and many roads were blocked by floods. Airports cancelled all flights in and out of the Haiphong airport on 19 days. The flight reminding to remind passengers from Hanoi and other places to travel to sea defense in time to understand the flight dynamics and weather information, and to arrange the travel reasonably. A helicopter crashed in the southern part of the country in 18 days, killing all 3 people on board. The helicopter was considered to have been damaged by bad weather.[33]


Retirement

On October 26, PAGASA has announced that the name _Karen_ will be removed from their naming lists because it had caused over ₱1 billion in damages.[34] On January 17, 2017, PAGASA chose the name _Kristine_ to replace _Karen_ for the 2020 season.

During the 49th annual session of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee during 2017, they announced that the name _Sarika_ will be removed from the naming lists. In March 2018, the Typhoon Committee finally chose _Trases_ as its replacement name.[35]
