This is a LIST OF FILMS released by the British studio BRITISH LION FILMS which was established in 1927 during the silent era. In its early years the company produced adaptations of Edgar Wallace crime novels, and later focused mainly on quota quickies. After the Second World War British Lion was acquired by Alexander Korda and it became a distribution outlet for independent British films with government backing.

While British Lion distributed many foreign films in Britain, such as a large number of Republic Pictures productions, these are not included in the list,
