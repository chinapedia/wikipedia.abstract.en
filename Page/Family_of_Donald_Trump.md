Children with Ivana

Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric are Trump's three eldest children, from his first marriage with Ivana Trump.

Prior to the election, each of the siblings held the title of executive vice president at the Trump Organization. During the campaign, they served as surrogates for their father on national news programs. Following Trump's election victory, all three were named to the presidential transition team.[4]

Following the inauguration, Donald Jr. and Eric took charge of the family's real estate empire. Ivanka moved to Washington, D.C., with her husband Jared Kushner, who was appointed to a senior White House advisory position.[5]

Tiffany Trump

Tiffany Ariana Trump (born October 13, 1993) is Donald Trump's only child with Marla Maples. In 2016, she participated little in her father's campaign because she was studying sociology and urban studies at the University of Pennsylvania, her father's alma mater.[6] Shortly after graduating, she made a speech for her father at the Republican National Convention at age 22.[7]

Barron Trump

Barron_Trump_2016.png Barron William Trump (born March 20, 2006)[8] is Donald Trump's youngest child and his only child with Melania Trump. He is of German and Scottish descent on his father's side and Slovenian descent on his mother's side. In May 2006, Barron Trump received the Christian sacrament of baptism at The Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea in Palm Beach, Florida.[9][10] He attended the Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School in Manhattan. Barron is fluent in English and Slovene.[11] During his early childhood, Barron made several television appearances, including on _The Apprentice_ and a May 16, 2006, episode of _The Oprah Winfrey Show_ at only 2 months old.[12] Barron did not immediately move into the White House when his father became president, but remained at Trump Tower with his mother until the end of the 2016–2017 school year.[13] Melania and Barron moved to the White House on June 11, 2017. He now attends St. Andrew's Episcopal School in Potomac, Maryland.[14]

He made few appearances during the 2016 election because his mother wanted to keep him out of the spotlight.[15] He made a total of three public appearances on the campaign trail, appearing at a campaign rally in South Carolina, and attending his father's RNC acceptance speech and presidential victory speech.[16] While absent from pre-inauguration events, he was at his father's inauguration ceremony in January 2017 and some of the subsequent events.[17]

Barron is noted to be a fan of soccer. He appeared in an Arsenal F.C. jersey and met D.C. United players at the White House Easter Egg Roll in April 2017.[18] In September 2017, he was selected to join the U-12 team for D.C. United's Development Academy for the 2017–2018 season.[19] In December 2018, he met D.C. United player Wayne Rooney and family, who had been invited to the White House Christmas party.[20] As of February 2019, Trump plays with the Arlington Soccer Association.[21]

Ancestry

Donald Trump's paternal ancestry is traceable to Bobenheim am Berg, a village in the Palatinate, Germany, in the 18th century. Johann Trump, born in Bobenheim in 1789, moved to the nearby village of Kallstadt where his grandson, Friedrich Trump, the grandfather of Donald Trump, was born in 1869.[33][34] This German heritage was long concealed by Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, who had grown up in a mainly German-speaking environment until he was 10 years old;[35] after World War II and until the 1980s, he told people he was of Swedish ancestry.[36] Donald Trump repeated this version in _The Art of the Deal_ (1987) but later said he is "proud" of his German heritage, and served as grand marshal of the 1999 German-American Steuben Parade in New York City.[37][38]

Parents

Fred Trump

Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump (1905–1999), born in New York, was a successful real estate developer in New York City.[39][40] Using his inheritance, Fred Trump and his mother Elizabeth founded _Elizabeth Trump & Son_. Donald Trump later renamed it the Trump Organization and served as its chairman and president until assuming the office of U.S. president.[41]

Mary Anne MacLeod Trump

Born as Mary Anne MacLeod (1912–2000) in Tong, a small village near Stornoway, in the Western Isles of Scotland, she was the daughter of fisherman Malcolm MacLeod and Mary MacLeod (née Smith).[42] At age 17, she immigrated to the United States and started working as a maid in New York.[43] Mary and Donald Trump's father Fred Trump met in New York and married in 1936, settling together in Queens. Mary became a U.S. citizen in 1942.[44][45] Donald Trump has said that he "feels Scottish".[46][47]

Grandparents

Frederick Trump

Friedrich_Trump_Family.jpg family, 1915]] In 1885, Donald Trump's grandfather, Friedrich Trump, emigrated from Kallstadt, Palatinate (then part of the Kingdom of Bavaria), to the United States at age 16. He anglicized his name to _Frederick_ in 1892 when he became a U.S. citizen.[48] During the Klondike Gold Rush, he amassed a fortune by opening a restaurant and hotel in Bennett and later Whitehorse, serving gold seekers on their way to the region; one biographer wrote that the business included a brothel, a portrayal Donald Trump has said was "totally false".[49] After his death, his fortune was passed on to his wife and son. Frederick Trump was a second cousin of Henry J. Heinz, founder of H. J. Heinz Company, whose father also came from Kallstadt.

Elizabeth Christ Trump

Donald Trump's grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, _née_ Christ, was born in 1880 and died on June 6, 1966. Born Elisabeth Christ, she married Frederick Trump in 1902 and moved to the United States with him. Like her husband, she was a native of Kallstadt, born as the daughter of Philipp and Marie Christ. Philipp Christ was descended from Johannes Christ (1626–1688/9) of Flörsheim, Hesse. Elizabeth Christ Trump was a descendant of organ builder Johann Michael Hartung (1708–1763) through her paternal grandmother Sabina Christ.[50]
