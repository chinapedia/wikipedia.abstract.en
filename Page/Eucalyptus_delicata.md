_EUCALYPTUS DELICATA_ is a species of tree that is endemic to Western Australia. It has rough, fibrous to scaly bark on the trunk, smooth white to greyish bark above, linear to narrow lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, creamy white flowers and more or less spherical to barrel-shaped fruit.


Description

_Eucalyptus delicata_ is a tree, rarely a mallee and typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough fibrous to scaly grey bark on the lower half and a smooth grey-copper colour above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have linear to narrow lance-shaped, more or less sessile leaves arranged spirally along the stem. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, glossy green long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven, nine or eleven in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval, long and about wide with a conical to rounded operculum long. Flowering occurs in March or April and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody shortened spherical to barrel-shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel long with the valves protruding. The fruit contains flattened oval, brown-grey seeds that are long.[1][2][3]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus delicata_ was first formally described in 1999 by the botanists Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill and the description was published in the journal _Telopea_. The type specimen was collected by Johnson, Hill and Donald Frederick Blaxell in 1986 about west of the Coolgardieâ€“Esperance Highway on the road to Peak Charles.[4][5]

This species is part of the _Eucalyptus_ subgenus _Symphyomyrtus_ in the section _Bisectae_ and the subsection _Destitutae_. It is closely related to _E. longicornis_, _E. oleosa_ and _E. longissima_.[6]

The specific epithet (_delicata_) is a Latin word meaning "tender", "dainty" or "fastidious",[7] referring to the small buds and fruits.[8]


Distribution

This eucalypt is found in flat areas of the Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions of Western Australia where it grows in red clay to sandy-loamy soils.[9]


Conservation status

_Eucalyptus delicata_ is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[10]
