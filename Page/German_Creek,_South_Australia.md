GERMAN CREEK is a rural locality in south-eastern South Australia, situated in the District Council of Grant.[1] The boundaries were formalised in October 1995 for the long established name. The postcode was originally 5280, but was altered to 5291 in 2004.[2] It was reportedly named for a German who was shepherding in the area.[3]

The German Creek area was offered to the government for closer settlement purposes in 1911; however, while the government purchased the nearby Moorak estate, it declined to purchase land at German Creek, and the area was privately subdivided.[4][5]

It was renamed BENARA CREEK in 1918, one of many German-themed named places in South Australia to be renamed during World War I; however, it reverted to its original name in 1986.[6][7]

The principal land use at German Creek is primary production.[8]

The Coola Shearing Shed has been listed as a state heritage place on the South Australian Heritage Register.[9]

The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that German Creek had a population of 44 people.[10]

German Creek is located within the federal division of Barker, the state electoral district of Mount Gambier and the local government area of the District Council of Grant.[11][12][13]
