_SIGMA_ (stylized with the Greek symbol _Σ_) is the debut studio album by Japanese musical unit REOL. It was released on October 19, 2016 by Toy's Factory in two physical editions—a standard CD, and a CD and DVD bundle—and for digital consumption. Prior to their formation, each member—Reol, Giga and Okiku—worked with each other on numerous musical projects until finalizing a record contract with Toy's Factory in early 2016. The material on the album were written, sung and co-composed by Reol, whilst production was handled by all three artists and arranged by Giga.

Inspired by the aesthetics and sounds of Western culture and the Korean wave, _Sigma_ is an electronic dance album that incorporates elements of hip-hop, contemporary pop and club sounds. Lyrically, the record delves into enjoyment, love, having fun and a variety of expressions, all encased by their current state of mind, as described by them as "transitory". Upon its release, _Sigma_ received positive reviews from music critics. Several commentators complimented the groups musical direction, alongside Reol's vocals and commercial appeal.

Commercially, _Sigma_ experienced moderate success in Japan, reaching the top ten on both the Oricon Albums Chart and Japan Hot Albums chart, the latter hosted by _Billboard_. In order to promote the album, the album tracks: "ChiruChiru", "Give Me a Break Stop Now", and "YoiYoi Kokon" were served as digital singles, accompanied with additional music videos co-created by Okiku. Furthermore, REOL had appeared on several promotional formats such as live performances, magazines and interviews on social media.


Background

Reol and GigaP had consistently worked together prior to forming the musical unit REOL, providing compositions and vocals to several Japanese vocaloid acts such as Hatsune Miku.[1] Additionally, Reol and art director Okiku had been long-time friends and occasionally collaborated with her music videos and packaging for her releases.[2] Reol and GigaP's first project as a duo was _No Title_, which was released on August 17, 2014 through Japanese label Celo Project.[3] Furthermore, Reol continued working on her debut studio album, titled _Gokusaishiki_. It was released on July 29, 2015 through Victor Entertainment, and reached the top ten on the Oricon Albums Chart.[4][5] Subsequently, Reol, GigaP, and Okiku signed a record contract with Japanese label Toy's Factory, forming themselves as a unit under Reol's name—capitalized as REOL.[6] Despite this, the trio stayed anonymous with their identity, using anime-influenced illustrations and chibi designs to depict themselves; several other animations were also distributed in their subsequent music videos.[7] But on August 18, REOL made their debut appearance in the music video for their track "Give Me a Break Stop Now".[8]


Composition and material

The material on _Sigma_ were written, composed and produced by member Reol, whom also provided vocals to each track; bandmate, GigaP, received additional music credits towards composing and arranging the album.[9] The album was recorded between 2015 and 2016 in Japan, and was mixed GigaP. Additionally, Hiromichi Takiguchi mastered the record alongside GigaP, which was finalized on September 1 with the music videos.[10][11] Despite the groups experimentation with J-Pop, general pop music and indie rock music, both as a trio and individually,[12] _Sigma_ is an electronic dance album that incorporates elements of hip-hop and club sounds.[13][14] According to GigaP, the record was heavily influenced by Westernized music, both contemporary pop and EDM, and also noted inspiration of K-Pop and modern Korean pop culture.[15]

The first song created for the project was "Detarame Kidding", an "interesting" collaboration between the two but was briefly shelved. However, Reol started to re-edit the track and after completing it, she Skyped GigaP the results.[16] This allowed the singer to compose the tracks herself, resulting into the three album inclusions "VIP Kid", "Re:" and "404 Not Found".[17][18] In an interview with _Billboard_ Japan, the members commented that the lyrical content emphasizes enjoyment and how they are feeling at current state, noting it as "transitory"; they had chosen the album tracks "YoiYoi Kokon" and "Give Me a Break Stop Now" as examples of this.[19][20] Similarly, the group told Music-Lounge.jp that songs like "Give Me a Break Stop Now" delves into Reol's anger and irresponsibility, while "YoiYoi Kokon" was inspired by the Gion Matsuri event in Kyoto, and represents a sign of celebration and change.[21]

Although majority of the tracks were commissioned throughout its production process, Reol stated that the song "Re:" was originally left out of the final product. However, because Okiku and GigaP identified it as one of their favorite recordings—Okiku described it as "lovely" and "cute"—Reol added into the record.[22] On the album, tracks like "Konoyo Loading..." and "Summer Horror Party" contrast between an "innocent" and "cute" vocal delivery, and the groups initial aesthetic and lyrical content. Reol believed that these tracks were examples of her departure from her rock-influenced work as a solo artist.[23] _Sigma_ also includes one interlude track, "Final Sigma", which samples Reol's previous releases alongside material from _Sigma_.[24]


Release and packaging

On August 18, 2016, the group announced the release for their studio album _Sigma_, scheduled on October 19, 2016.[25] Released in both physical and digital formats,[26][27][28] pre-ordered versions through Japanese retail CDJapan.co.jp included a limited edition poster featuring the members.[29] Two bonus tracks were issued through different stores in Japan; the first was the Tenka Toritai remix of "OedoRanvu" at Tower Record stores, whilst an Okinawa Ikitai remix of "Drop Pop Candy" was announced at Tsutaya shops. Both remixes were distributed on music cards, where consumers had to use a special code to access the recordings.[30] The title of the album was based on several theories; member Reol said it first came from the thought of a somewhat internet slang, then it progressed with the literal sense of Summation (a term in Mathematics), and the phenomenon of artists' interest of symbolizing their records with one word/phrase.[31] Additionally, she said that the sigma term through mathematics represented the group as a whole.[32] The cover art and design was directed by Okiku and photographed by Kenichi Sonehara; it depicts Reol in a small 4x4 room, effected by static imagery. According to member Okiku, the artwork was thought out by the result of the songs lyrics and sound.[33]

Singles

"ChiruChiru", "Give Me a Break Stop Now", and "YoiYoi Kokon" were served as digital singles on October 7, 2016 via iTunes Store, as part of a pre-order promotion with the album.[34] Additionally, the songs received music videos, all produced and co-directed by the group member Okiku. The first promotional visual was "ChiruChiru", which was released June 30, 2016; it features footage of random locations in Japan, overlapped with several animated characters and lyrics of the song. It also includes several video shots of objects, such as tree branches, flowers, and building walls.[35] The second visual was "Give Me a Break Stop Now", published on August 18 via YouTube and NicoNico. REOL made their debut appearance in the video, which represents the groups vocalist as a queen-like monarch and several other personas.[36] The third video from the album was "YoiYoi Kokon", which incorporates several traditional Asian objects, symbols and aquatic life. The song is sung with archaic Japanese words, and a "modern" translation is transcribed on the video, as well. It was distributed through the band's YouTube and Reol's NicoVideo account on September 15.[37] In order to promote the album's remaining material in the days prior to release, Reol uploaded a crossfade video that included snippets of each track and additional visuals that represented them.[38]
