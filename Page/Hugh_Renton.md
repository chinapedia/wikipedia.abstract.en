[1][2]


Early career

Born and raised in Hastings, New Zealand, Renton attended Lindisfarne College (10-14) in his hometown and played first XV rugby for them in 2012 and 2013 but was unable to play his senior year. [3]


Super Rugby

Hugh played under-18 rugby for the Hurricanes in 2013 as a year 12 and captained them against the Chiefs under-18, winning 40-10. Wellington based super rugby team the made an agreement that would keep Hugh amongst the team. Specifically to return him from injury and look after his development. Unspurprisingly 2015 was a season of learning for Renton and he made no appearances during the campaign. Renton was apart of the Hurricanes squad for the 2016 season in which the 'Canes would be crowned Super Rugby champions for the first time. Despite coming back from injury and the campaign being a successful one for the franchise, it was one of personal disappointment for Renton, as injury ruined his year and he again failed to make the field. 2017 Super Rugby saw Renton performing well throughout pre-season. However he had to wait till round 13 vs the Cheetahs to make his debut as regular Callum Gibbins pulled out late with an injury complaint. Renton came on as a replacement for Ardie Savea in the last quarter of the match, the Hurricanes went on to win 61-7. 'Gibbins returned to the squad the following week', which meant that was the only game time Renton saw in 2017 as the Hurricanes lost to the Lions in the semi final 44-29. Despite having a promising Mitre 10 Cup for the Hawkes Bay Magpies and the first time he had played consistently without injury, Renton found himself surplus to requirements in 2018 for both the Hurricanes and Hawkes Bay Magpies with the Hurricanes signing fellow Magpie Gareth Evans.
