Life and career

She completed a PhD in comparative literature at Sichuan University and is the Chair of the China Young Writers Association.

In 2012 she was chosen as Best New Writer by the prestigious Chinese Literature Media Prize (华语文学传媒大奖 最佳新人奖). Yan Ge was a guest writer at the Netherlands Crossing Borders festival in The Hague, November 2012,[2] and since then has appeared at numerous literary festivals in Europe.
