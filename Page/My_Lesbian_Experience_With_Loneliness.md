Synopsis

The manga is an autobiography following Kabi Nagata, a young woman, exploring subjects such as her mental health, her exploration of her sexuality, and her experience with growing up.[1]


Production and publication

_My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness_ was written and drawn by Kabi Nagata, with art colored in a two-tone palette.[2] According to Nagata, she does not hesitate to expose her private life for the sake of creating interesting content for a manga, despite being more introverted when speaking to people in person. She decided to do this because of a lack of work after she had become a manga artist, thinking that the only way for her to create something interesting that could earn her a living was to base her creation on her own experiences. The writing process involved her writing down things that have happened to her, and her feelings, in the form of a bulleted list, and rearranging the items to form a narrative. When writing, she strove towards neither lowering or glorifying herself, to avoid spreading too negative feelings and making readers unable to relate to the stories. She said that there were some things she "couldn't touch on" in the manga, that she would like to use in a future work.[3]

Nagata originally published the manga on the Japanese art website Pixiv;[4] it was later published by East Press in one print volume on June 17, 2016.[5] For the printed volume, extra story material was added, and the art throughout the manga was revised.[6] Seven Seas Entertainment announced in October 2016 that they had acquired the license for the manga, and released it on June 6, 2017 in North America, in a single volume,[7][8][9] and digitally a day later through ComiXology.[10] A sequel, _My Solo Exchange Diary_, was published by Shogakukan in Japan on December 10, 2016, and in English by Seven Seas Entertainment on June 5, 2018.[11]


Reception

The manga was well received by critics.[12] The publishing company Takarajimasha listed _My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness_ as the third best manga of the year for women in the 2017 incarnation of their yearly _Kono Manga ga Sugoi!_ top-twenty list, after _Kin no Kuni Mizu no Kuni_ and _Haru no Noroi_.[13] It won _The Anime Awards_ 2017 in the "Manga of the Year" category,[14] both _Publishers Weekly_ and Amazon listed it as one of the best comics of 2017,[15][16] _Teen Vogue_ included it on their list of the "best queer books to celebrate Pride 2017",[17] and comic creator Tillie Walden included it in a _Bookish_ article about "must-read" LGBTQ comics.[18] It is nominated for a Harvey Award in the "Best Manga" category.[19]

The Japanese newspaper _Fukui Shimbun_ liked the manga, and said that Nagata's thoughts remained with them after having finished reading it.[20] The entertainment news site _Natalie_ also enjoyed it, calling it a "breathtaking essay".[21] Ana Valens of _The Mary Sue_ cited it as a work that goes against the typical _yuri_ fantasy themes in _yuri_ works by exploring realistic emotional and mental dynamics in lesbian relationships, and said that the events leading up to Nagata's meeting with the sex worker "shed a new light on how we can think about yuri".[22] Heidi MacDonald at _The Beat_ called it "an irresistible memoir" and perfect for young readers also dealing with identity and acceptance issues.[23] Judith Utz of _Teen Vogue_ described it as "moving and honest", and relatable for everyone who has doubted themselves.[24]

_My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness_ was the second best selling comic of its debut week in North America, according to the weekly Nielsen BookScan graphic novel sales charts, after _Bitch Planet_ volume 2.[25] It also appeared on the monthly BookScan chart for June 2017, in eleventh place.[26]
