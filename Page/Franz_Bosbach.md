FRANZ BOSBACH (born 11 January 1952) is a German historian and university professor.[1]


Life

Bosbach was born in Bornheim, a small town situated on the left bank of the Rhine, between Cologne and Bonn.

He received his doctorate from Bonn University in 1981 for a piece of analytical research on the longer lasting effects of the 1648 Peace of Westphalia.[2] His habilitation (higher academic qualification), also from Bonn followed in 1986, this time for a piece of work entitled "Monarchia Universalis. Ein politischer Leitbegriff der fr√ºhen Neuzeit" (_"Universal monarchy: a political precept for the early modern period"_).[3] Between 1987 and 1989 he was supported by a bursary from the German Research Foundation's Heisenberg Programme.[4]

In 1989 Bosbach was appointed visiting fellow at Clare College, Cambridge.[5] He held a teaching chair in early modern history between 1989 and 2008 at the recently established University of Bayreuth,[6] where between 2005 and 2008 he served as vice-president for study and teaching.[7] Between 1995 and 2008 he was also "at the helm" of the Anglo-German (Coburg based) Prince Albert Society.[8]

In 2008 he switched to the University of Duisburg-Essen where he was elected full-time vice-rector for study and teaching. His term in office ended in 2014, since which time he has remained at the university as a professor of early modern history.[9]
