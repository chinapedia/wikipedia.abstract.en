NEXT GENERATION ATP FINALS is an annual men's youth tennis tournament for the best 21-and-under players of the season.


History

Following a competitive bid process, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) announced that the Italian Tennis Federation, in association with the Italian Olympic Committee, will organise a new ATP tournament featuring the world’s top 21-and-under singles players of the ATP World Tour season. The first five editions of the Tournament will be hosted in Milan, Italy from 2017 to 2021.[1]


Format

Played over five days, the format for the competition consists of two round robin groups, followed by the semi-finals and final. Played on a singles-only court, the competition features the best seven qualified 21-and-under players of the season, plus one wild card.[2]


Rule changes

A number of rule changes have been introduced for the competition:[3]

Ranking points and prize money

The tournament does not distribute points for the ATP Rankings for the participants. The ATP does not count it as an official tournament victory, but matches count towards official win-loss season record. Prize money worth US$1,275,000 is distributed.[4] The International Tennis Federation does not recognize the event.


Qualification

The Top 7 players in the _Emirates ATP Race to Milan_ will qualify. The eighth spot will be reserved for a wild card, the winner of a qualifying tournament. Eligible players must be 21-and-under (born 1998 or later for 2019 edition).[5]
