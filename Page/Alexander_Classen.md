ALEXANDER CLASSEN (13 April 1843, in Aachen – 28 January 1934, in Aachen) was a German chemist, who is considered one of the founders of electrochemical analysis.[1]

From 1861 he studied chemistry at the universities of Giessen and Berlin. In 1870 he became a lecturer of analytical chemistry at the polytechnic school in Aachen, where in 1882 he succeeded Hans Heinrich Landolt as professor of inorganic chemistry. At Aachen, he was appointed director of the Electrochemical Institute,[2][3][4]


Published works

He was the author of _Quantitative Analyse durch Elektrolyse_, a book that was published over numerous editions, and translated into English with the title: _Quantitative analysis by electrolysis_. He was editor of the last issue of Friedrich Mohr's textbook on titrimetry ("_Friedrich Mohr's Lehrbuch der chemisch-analytischen Titrirmethode_", 1914),[5] and with English chemist Henry Enfield Roscoe, he authored a textbook on inorganic chemistry ("_Lehrbuch der anorganischen Chemie_"; 2 volumes, 3rd edition 1895–97). Other noted works by Classen are:

-   _Tabellen zur Qualitativen Analyse_, 1876 – Tables for quantitative analysis.
-   _Grundriss der analytischen chemie_ (2 volumes, 2nd edition 1879) – Outline of analytical chemistry.
-   _F.L. Sonnenschein's Handbuch der gerichtlichen chemie_ (new edition of Franz Leopold Sonnenschein's manual of forensic chemistry, 1881).
-   _Handbuch der analytischen chemie_ (2 volumes, 4th edition 1889–91) – Handbook of analytical chemistry
-   _Neuerungen in der quantitativen Analyse durch Elektrolyse_, 1895 – Innovations in quantitative analysis by electrolysis.[6]
