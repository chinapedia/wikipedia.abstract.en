In February 2017, Sena left FC Barcelona Lassa by mutual consent.[5] He saw action in only one ACB game for Barcelona, while being a regular in the reserve side, averaging 6.8 points and 3.3 rebounds a contest.

In March 2017, he joined the Contagem Towers of the Liga Ouro de Basquete in his native Brazil.[6]

On August 8, 2018, Sena signed with CB Prat of the LEB Oro.[7]
