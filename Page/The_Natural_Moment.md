Background

This was alto saxophonist Christopher Hollyday's third album.[1] It was pianist Brad Mehldau's first recording.[2]


Music and recording

The album was recorded in January 1991.[3] Hollyday "performs five of his driving originals and a song apiece from Peter Bernstein, Walter Davis Jr., John Webber, and Cole Porter."[4]


Release and reception

_The Natural Moment_ was released by RCA Novus.[5] The _Chicago Tribune_ reviewer commented that Hollyday's album "represents a musical advance over his second and almost justifies the attention given his first".[6] _The Penguin Guide to Jazz_ wrote that "the music seems over-intense, as if Hollyday were reacting to the usual charges of neo-conservatism by trying to prove how impolite he can be".[7]
