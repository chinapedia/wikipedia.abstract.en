Background

To commemorate the label's 20th anniversary, Combs reunited with his former (& current) Bad Boy Family artists at the 2015 BET Awards for an all-star medley performance of the collective's many hits including "Can't Nobody Hold Me Down", "Feel So Good", "Peaches & Cream", "I Need A Girl, Pt. 2", "Love Like This", "Hot Boy (Remix)" (Verse Only), "Can't You See", "It's All About The Benjamins" (Remix), "Mo Money, Mo Problems" & Combs' new single, "Finna Get Loose" (with a special appearance from Pharrell Williams.) Mase, 112, Faith Evans, The LOX (sans Styles P), Lil' Kim & French Montana accompanied Combs for their respective performances.

In April 2016, Combs announced a two-night Bad Boy Family Reunion show on May 20 & 21 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, which was also in commemoration of the late Notorious B.I.G.'s 44th birthday (May 21.) The first show included performances from Combs, Mase, Faith Evans, 112, Total, The LOX, Carl Thomas, Lil' Kim, French Montana, Mario Winans, Cassie, Black Rob, Lil' Cease & Red Cafe. Special guest performances included Jay-Z, Nas, Usher, Mary J. Blige and Rick Ross.[2] The second night special guest included Busta Rhymes, Fabolous, Desiigner, 2 Milly, DMX & Ty Dolla Sign.[3]
