_AXIOS_ (stylized as AXIOS) is an American news and information website founded in 2016 by former _Politico_ staffers Jim VandeHei, Mike Allen, and Roy Schwartz. It officially launched in 2017. The site's name is based on the (_áxios_), meaning "worthy".[1]


History

Founding

_Axios_{{'}}s founder VandeHei said he aimed for the company to be a "mix between _The Economist_ and Twitter."[2] The company initially targeted coverage of a mix of news about business, politics, technology, healthcare, and media. Founder VandeHei said _Axios_ would focus on the "collision between tech and areas such as bureaucracy, health care, energy, and the transportation infrastructure".[3] At launch, Nicholas Johnston, a former managing editor at Bloomberg LP was named editor-in-chief.[4]

In the summer of 2016, _Axios_ secured $10 million in a round of financing led by Lerer Hippeau Ventures. Backers include media-partner NBC News; Emerson Collective, the investment vehicle of Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs; Greycroft Partners; and David and Katherine Bradley, owners of Atlantic Media.[5] The company had raised $30 million .[6][7] It planned to focus on "business, technology, politics, and media trends."[8] Axios generates revenue through short-form native advertising and sponsored newsletters.[9] The company earned more than $10 million in revenue in its first seven months.[10]

Content

The content is designed to live on digital platforms, such as Facebook and Snapchat, as well as its own website.[11] Reporters have made appearances on television news on NBC News and MSNBC through a deal with NBC.[12] Its NBC Universal partnership has featured _Axios_ co-founder Mike Allen on its show _Morning Joe_.[13][14] Content is distributed via newsletters covering politics, technology, healthcare, and other subjects. Among the newsletters is a daily report by Mike Allen, who formerly wrote the Playbook newsletter for _Politico_.[15] Typical articles are shorter than 300 words.[16]

Staff

In January 2017, the company hired as an executive vice president, Evan Ryan, the assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs and a former staffer for Vice President Joe Biden.[17] In March 2017, the company said it had 60 employees with 40 working in editorial.[18] _Axios_ had six million visitors in September 2017, according to comScore. As of November 2017, _Axios_ said it had 200,000 subscribers to 11 newsletters, with an average open rate of 52%. That same month, _Axios_ said it would use a new $20 million investment to expand data analysis, product development, fund audience growth, and increase staff to 150, up from 89.[19]

Paid Wikipedia editing

In March and April 2019, _HuffPost_ reported that Axios had paid a firm to burnish its reputation by lobbying for changes to the Wikipedia articles on _Axios_ and Jonathan Swan, and the story was later picked up by _Wired_.[20][21] Ashley Feinberg of _HuffPost_ reported that from February 2018, _Axios_ had hired a Wikipedia editor to "beef up its Wikipedia page (mostly with benign—if largely flattering—stats about _Axios_{{'}} accomplishments)."[22][23] Noam Cohen of _Wired_ suggested the practice was indicative of a wider problem, saying, "Attempts to influence the site are... sadly inevitable; there are few areas immune to power of wealth and status."[24]
