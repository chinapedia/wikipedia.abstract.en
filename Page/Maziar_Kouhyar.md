MAZIAR KOUHYAR (Dari: مازیار كوهيار, born 30 September 1997), is an Afghan professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for EFL League One side Walsall. He is the first Afghan to play professionally in Great Britain.[1]


Club career

Born in Badakhshan Province in Afghanistan,[2] Kouhyar moved to England as a two-year old due to conflict in his home country.[3] His parents settled in Handsworth suburb of Birmingham and his father worked as a pizza delivery driver, before returning to Afghanistan to work as an interpreter, leaving his mother to bring up the four children.[4] At the age of eleven he was spotted by a Coventry City scout after attending a Saturday football session with his cousin, and joined the club's youth system.[5] After being released at the age of sixteen, he played in Sunday league football, before being spotted by a Walsall scout whilst playing in a local Powerleague.[6] After a trial, he subsequently joined the club.[7] He went on to sign a two-year scholarship with the club, progressing to sign his first professional deal in February 2016, on a one-year contract with the option of a further year.[8] He made his professional debut in August 2016, in a 2–0 defeat to Chesterfield, replacing Kieron Morris as a substitute.[9] He scored his first goal for Walsall in an EFL Trophy tie against Grimsby Town on 30 August 2016.[10] On 9 December he signed a new contract with Walsall until the summer of 2019.[11]

Outside of football, Kouyar attends an accountancy evening course.[12]


International career

In October 2016, he received his first call-up to the Afghanistan senior side for the friendly against Malaysia.[13] While he was on international duty with the national team, he picked up an injury which cost him a minimum of three months without playtime and required knee surgery.[14] Kouhyar made his formal debut for Afghanistan in a friendly 2–0 loss to Oman on 30 August 2017.[15] In 2018 he rejected a call-up for a home match against Palestine as his family did not want him to travel to Kabul.[16]
