ARTHUR GOMES LOURENÇO (born 3 July 1998), known as ARTHUR, is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Chapecoense on loan from Santos as a forward.


Club career

Santos

Arthur was born in Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, and joined Santos' youth setup in November 2012,[1] after representing São Paulo, Uberlândia and Poliesportivo.[2] In January 2015, he signed a two-year professional deal with the former.[3]

In September 2016, after Gabriel's departure to Internazionale, Arthur was called up to train with the main squad by manager Dorival Júnior.[4] He was first included in a matchday squad on 19 October, for a Copa do Brasil match against Internacional,[5] but remained an unused substitute in the 0–2 away loss and subsequent elimination.[6]

On 6 November 2016 Arthur made his first team – and Série A – debut, coming on as a late substitute for Jean Mota in a 2–1 away win against Ponte Preta.[7] The following 4 January, after featuring in one further match with the main squad, he renewed his contract until December 2021.[8]

Arthur scored his first professional goal on 3 February 2017, netting his team's fourth in a 6–2 Campeonato Paulista home routing of Linense.[9] After only appearing rarely with Dorival and Levir Culpi, he was made a starter by interim manager Elano, and scored his first goal in the top tier on 4 November by netting the first in a 3–1 home win against Atlético Mineiro.[10]

Arthur made his Copa Libertadores debut on 1 March 2018, replacing Jean Mota in a 2–0 away loss against Real Garcilaso.[11]

Chapecoense (loan)

On 1 May 2019, Arthur was loaned to fellow top tier club Chapecoense until the end of the season.[12]
