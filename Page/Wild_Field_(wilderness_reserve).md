WILD FIELD ( _Dikoe pole_) is a 300 ha (740 ac) nature reserve near the city of Tula in Tula Oblast in the European part of Russia, approximately 250 km (150 mi) south of Moscow.[1] It was established in 2012 by Russian scientists Sergey Zimov and Nikita Zimov as a companion to Pleistocene Park in Siberia.[2]

Unlike Pleistocene Park, Wild Field’s primary purpose is not scientific research but public outreach, i.e. it will provide a model of what an unregulated steppe ecosystem looked like before the advent of humans.[3] It is situated near a federal road and a railway station and is accessible to the general public.[4]


The reserve

Wild Field comprises 300 ha (740 ac) of which at first 150 ha were fenced off and stocked with animals.[5] In 2017 the fenced area was increased to 280 hectares.[6]

The area of the reserve will be increased to 500 ha in 2018/2019.[7] For the future, plans call for a continuous increase of the area in relation to the increasing population of animals in the reserve.[8]


Animals

Introduced between 2012 and 2015 were

-   Bashkir horses (a strain of _Equus ferus caballus_), from a feral herd in the southern part of the Ural Mountains,[9][10]
-   Altai maral/Altai wapiti (_Cervus canadensis sibiricus_),[11]
-   Edilbaevskaya sheep (a strain of _Ovis orientalis aries_),[12][13]
-   Roe deer (_Capreolus spec._),[14][15]
-   Kalmykian cattle (a strain of _Bos primigenius taurus_),[16][17]
-   Domestic yaks (_Bos mutus grunniens_), both polled[18][19] and unpolled.[20]

The total number of large herbivores in Wild Field Park numbered around 150 in April 2015.[21]

In 2016, several wild boars (_Sus scrofa_)[22] and a female elk^([BE])/moose^([AE]) (_Alces alces_) entered the reserve through special one-way entrances built into the fences.[23] Several young wild boar/domestic pig hybrids (_Sus scrofa × domesticus_) have also been purchased to be released into the park upon maturing.[24]

In 2017, four reindeer (_Rangifer tarandus_)[25] and 73 domestic Pridonskaya goats (a strain of _Capra aegagrus hircus_)[26] were added.

A herd of 20 plains bison (_Bison bison bison_) which was to be delivered in March 2014 by the True Nature Foundation, a European organization for ecological restoration and rewilding,[27] could not be imported due to a blanket import ban on cattle from countries affected by the Schmallenberg virus.[28]

The introduction of a test group of camels (_Camelus spec._) is under consideration.[29] Further plans call for the introduction of bison, saiga antelopes, vultures, bobak marmots and speckled ground squirrels.[30][31][32]
