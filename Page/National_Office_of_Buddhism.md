The NATIONAL OFFICE OF BUDDHISM (; ), also known as OFFICE OF NATIONAL BUDDHISM (ONAB), is an agency of the central government of Thailand. It is an independent public agency, reporting directly to the prime minister. The National Office of Buddhism is responsible for state administration of the religion, including the development of Phuttamonthon as a religious center. Religious affairs are handled by a Sangha Supreme Council of monks.[1]

ONaB, together with the Sangha, sponsors Thailand's overseas Buddhist missionary policy and activities.[2]


History

Traditionally, the government of Thailand administered matters of religion and public education together under the Ministry of Public Institution, whose name was changed to the Ministry of Education in a 1943 reform, which also established the Department of Religious Affairs within the ministry. Another reform in 2002 moved the Department of Religious Affairs to the Ministry of Culture and split part of its responsibilities to create the independent National Office of Buddhism.


Anti-corruption activities

The head of the National Office of Buddhism, Pongporn Pramsaneh, a former policeman who joined the organization in February 2017, vowed to reform Thailand's 37,075 temples by forcing them to open their financial accounts to the public. The temples receive an estimated US$3.5 billion a year in donations.[3] The government provides a further 4.67 billion baht (US$137 million) to support temples and their more than 300,000 monks.[4] In August 2017 Pongporn was dismissed from his position after Buddhist groups called on the government to sack him over his plans to clean up monasteries.[5] In September 2017 Pongporn was reinstated.[6] His reinstatement followed a police decision to bring charges against four senior monks in connection with temple funds embezzlement.[7] The alleged wrongdoings have since broadened to include officials of the National Office of Buddhism who are alleged to have worked with senior monks in charge of at least 45 temples in Bangkok and other provinces to embezzle more than 270 million baht in state funding.[8] at least one Thai Buddhist organization is again calling for Pongporn's ouster, claiming that, "...laymen did not have the power to rule over monks."[9] There are signs, however, of growing opposition to clerical independence. As an editorial in the _Bangkok Post_ put it, "...temple donations must be transparent and open to independent auditing. The government must also make temples stand on their own feet. No more financial support; no more privileges."[10]
