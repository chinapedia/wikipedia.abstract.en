Tapestry_lawn_at_Avondale_Park_Summer.jpg AVONDALE PARK is a small park in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, London, England, between Walmer and Sirdar Roads. It has a mix of formal gardens, sports facilities and lawns. Notably, it is home to what is believed to be Britain's first floral lawn.[1]

The park is named after the late Duke of Clarence and Avondale.[2]


Floral lawn

The lawn is made just of flowering dicots include lawn chamomile, thyme, Corsican mint, daisies, red-flowering clover, yarrow, pennyroyal and bugle. The lawn is the result of collaboration between the Council and Lionel Smith, a PhD researcher at the University of Reading.

The aim of the lawn is to enhance the biodiversity of the Park by providing foraging habitats for a variety of pollinator species. This is particularly important for bees and butterflies which are in decline mainly due to loss of habitat, food sources, and the use of pesticides. [3]


Facilities

The park has a multi-use sports area which can be used for football, netball and tennis, a children's play areas and public toilets.[4]
