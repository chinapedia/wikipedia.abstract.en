More than 220.000 Franciscans are active in around 110 countries, living and working with people in need.n[3] The MZF supports around 600 projects in 60 countries.[4] They are chosen by criteria:

-   initiated by the people in need
-   socially and environmentally sustainable
-   helping people to help themselves ("Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe")

The MZF organises seminars and issues publications such as the quarterly _Grüne Reihe_.[5] From 1999, the MZF organized a voluntary year ("Freiwilligenjahr") for young adults, who work in projects.[6] From 2009, the MZF has organised travels to enable meetings of people of different cultures and religions,.[7]
