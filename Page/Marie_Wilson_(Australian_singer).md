Born in Melbourne, Wilson started playing solo gigs in 1993. She had a series of independent releases before signing with Warner Music in 1997. In 1998 she released two singles, "Next Time" and "Won’t Keep a Good Girl Down", both of which made the ARIA top 40. An album _Real Life_ followed in September and reached #7 on the albums chart.[6] _Real Life_ was subsequently released in USA in June 1998.[7] In 2000 she covered "Me Myself I" which was the lead song on the movie _Me Myself I_.[8] She released two more albums, _Studio Sessions_ in 2001 and _Heartbreak_ in 2005, then took a break from music. She later made her return, releasing a song "Extraordinary" in 2013[9] and followed it up the next year with an album of the same name.[10]
