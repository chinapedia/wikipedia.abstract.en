_TEN TRUMPETS AND 2 GUITARS_ is an album by composer, arranger and conductor Pete Rugolo featuring performances recorded in 1961 and first released on the Mercury label as part of its audiophile Perfect Presence Sound Series.[1][2][3][4]


Reception

The Allmusic review by arwulf arwulf noted: "_Ten Trumpets and Two Guitars_ showcases a skilled team of brass players who juggle trumpets and flugelhorns backed by a solid rhythm section featuring guitarists Howard Roberts and Al Viola. Although some of Rugolo's arrangements contain squirrel-like passages, most of the textures encountered here are characteristically cool and firmly rooted in traditional jazz."[5]
