The ALBERT SCHWEITZER SCHOOL () is a gymnasium in Offenbach am Main in the state of Hesse. It was founded in 1853 and was originally named the Higher Girls' School. It received its current name in honour of Albert Schweitzer in 1956; in the same year the school moved to its current buildings, which were built between 1909 and 1911 for the former Grand Ducal High School. The school has admitted boys since 1957.[1][2]
