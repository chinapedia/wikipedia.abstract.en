STREET DOGS is the twelfth studio album released by American band Widespread Panic. Recorded at Echo Mountain Recording Studio in Asheville, NC, it was released September 25, 2015.

This marks the first album by the band without drummer, and founding member, Todd Nance although he does receive co-writing credit on every song. It features Duane Trucks on drums. He was not an official member of the band at the time of its recording but had been performing live with them since late 2014. He joined the band as a full member in February 2016.[1]

Lead singer and guitarist John Bell has said in interviews that much of the album was recorded live in studio, with as little overdubbing as possible.[2][3]
