The PROVISIONAL IRA'S BALCOMBE STREET GANG was a Provisional IRA active service unit (ASU) (also known as the BALCOMBE STREET FOUR or the BALCOMBE STREET UNIT) who carried out a bombing campaign in England in the mid 1970s. All of their attacks and attempted attacks happened in southern England with the vast majority taking place in London and the rest in Surrey, Hampshire and Wiltshire. Between October 1974 and December 1975 they carried out approximately 40 bomb and gun attacks in and around London, sometimes attacking the same targets twice. The unit would sometimes carry out two or more attacks in one day; on the 27 January 1975 they placed seven time bombs in London.[1] On 25 November 1974, they carried out three bomb attacks in the centre of London injuring 20 people.[2] They were eventually caught during the Balcombe Street Siege in December 1975 thus ending their 15-month bombing campaign in England. They have been described as "the most violent, ruthless and highly-trained unit ever sent to Britain by the Provisional IRA".[3][4]


Active members

The six known members of the Balcombe Street Gang's ASU were Hugh Doherty, Joseph O'Connell, Eddie Buttler and Harry Duggan (these four volunteers were captured at the Balcombe Street Siege). Liam Quinn (a US-born volunteer) and Brendan Dowd were also active volunteers within the unit, there were also at least two unidentified female members who accompanied Dowd and O'Connell during the Guildford pub bombings.

O'Connell and fellow ASU member Dowd flew from Shannon Airport, County Clare, to Heathrow in early August 1974, under the pretense of looking for work in London. They rented a flat in Fulham, West London, for both living quarters and the storage of nitroglycerin and other bomb making equipment.

O'Connell, as the bomb-maker of the group, was responsible for making the first devices the ASU detonated in their campaign, during the Guildford pub bombings on 5 October 1974. This was the beginning of a wide range of attacks O'Connell was involved in. They varied from the kidnapping of a bus inspector and the bombing of the Kings Arms, Woolwich, to throwing hand bombs in Sir Edward Heath's club and the murder of an insurance broker.[5]


Background

The Balcombe Street Unit was possibly the most successful IRA unit ever to carry out a bombing campaign in England. They had a focus on London (in particular the West End of London where they targeted pubs, clubs and restaurants with bombings and shootings. They attacked several of their targets twice. Within the space of nineteen days the ASU days they had planted their first six explosive devices, two in Guildford on 5 October, another two in Seymour Street and St. James's Square on the 11th, another at St James's Square on the 22nd and one in Harrow on the 24th.[6]

In spring 1973, the IRA extended its bombing campaign to mainland Britain, attacking military and symbolically important targets. The aim was to both increase pressure on the British government by swaying popular British opinion, with the goal of British withdrawal from Northern Ireland.

It began on 8 March 1973 when an 11-person ASU, (which included now well known Irish republicans including the Price Sisters and Gerry Kelly) bombed the Old Bailey courthouse. Despite warnings, one person died of a heart attack and about 200 were injured, some seriously. The IRA always believed that one bomb in England was worth about 30 in Belfast and the huge media response seemed to prove this theory.[7]

The ASU behind the Old Bailey bombing was caught trying to leave England by plane to Ireland. Although the IRA achieved its objective, it was a tactical error to try to leave so quickly, as British security forces would be extra vigilant at escape routes from England to Ireland.[8]

The IRA General Headquarters realised this mistake. Instead, they decided that instead of sending over a large 10-person ASU for just one day of spectacular bombing, they would use smaller sleeper cells of three or four volunteers to carry out several bombings over a number of months.[9]

IRA attacks in England for the rest of 1973 soon started to become more professional and sophisticated. The following attack was on 18 August 1973 when two IRA firebombs exploded at Harrods Department store, causing some damage but no injuries or deaths. This was the start of their prolonged bombing campaign in England. Just four days later an IRA book bomb exploded at the Conservative Party Central Office in London, injuring several people but none seriously. A few weeks later IRA bombs went off at King's Cross & Euston stations causing 13 injuries and wide spread damage, and panic in central London. From then on IRA bombs became a regular occurrence in London and other major English cities.[10][11]

By 1974, mainland Britain saw an average of one attack - successful or otherwise - every three days. These attacks included the Birmingham pub bombings on 21 July which were possibly the first major attacks on the Midlands.

It is believed that republican Brian Keenan was in charge of the IRA bombing campaign in England from 1974–1976. After the Balcombe Street unit was arrested in 1975 Keenan visited a separate unit in Crouch Hill, London, to give it further instructions. In follow-up raids after the siege, police discovered crossword puzzles in his handwriting and his fingerprints on a list of bomb parts. A warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) at Banbridge in March 1979 on charges relating to the London campaign in the mid-1970s.[12][13]


1974

August

Sometime in August 1974 the first members of the Balcombe Street Unit moved into its first safe house, a London home in Fulham, in Waldemar Avenue SW6. Dowd and O'Connell start drawing up plans with a list of targets for the campaign to start in Autumn.[14]

October

-   5 OCTOBER – Guildford pub bombings The IRA unit planted two bombs in Guildford pubs. The Bomb in the Horse & Groom pub killed five people and injured 65. At the time this was the second worst attack the IRA carried out in Britain in terms of death toll and it provoked a strong reaction from the British public against the IRA. This was the start of "phase one" of the campaign. Four innocent people nicknamed the "Guildford Four" received large jail sentences for the bombings in 1975 until their convictions were quashed in 1989.[15][16]
-   9 OCTOBER - IRA Volunteers Brendan Dowd and Joe O'Connell plus an unknown young female volunteer mistakenly kidnap Basil Dalton, East Kent bus inspector, from the coach station in Buckingham Palace Road SW1. He is later found unharmed in the boot of his Corsair, having spent about fours in the back of it. The IRA volunteers believed they were kidnapping the head of the British Bomb Squad.
-   10 OCTOBER - Volunteers Harry Duggan and Eddie Butler arrive in London, and join the cell unit after being vetted by O'Connell. They rent another flat in Waldemar Avenue.
-   11 OCTOBER – The IRA attacked two different London ex-servicemen's clubs in Seymour Street near Marble Arch and the Army and Navy Club in St. James's Square ,each time using a hand-thrown bomb, this was the first time the unit had used a hand thrown bomb. One person was injured in total.[17][18]
-   22 OCTOBER – Brook's bombing The IRA threw a bomb into Brook's club injuring three people.[19][20]
-   24 OCTOBER – The IRA bombed a cottage in the grounds of Harrow public school which used to house the head of the school's Combined Cadet Force, which was probably the bombers' target. Nobody was hurt in the attack. This was the first time the unit gave a telephoned warning before a bombing occurred.[21]

November

-   6 NOVEMBER - The IRA unit was going to plant a bomb at the Kings Arms public house in Woolwich, but after doing some reconnaissance on the pub the unit decides planting a bomb inside is too risky, they will have to use a thrown bomb instead. They make a throw bomb and drive to the Kings Arms but there are not enough people inside.
-   7 NOVEMBER – Woolwich pub bombing The IRA threw a bomb into the King's Arms pub in Woolwich, killing two people and injuring 35. Two members of the "Guildford Four" were also charged with this bombing.[22][23]

    Daithi O Conaill in Dublin says that the IRA had not authorised the pillar box bombing: "To bomb civilians just because they are civilians, I would class as murder." This is a warning to the London ASU to stop. They ignore it.

-   27 NOVEMBER – The London IRA unit carried out two bomb attacks in Tite Street, Chelsea. The first bomb was placed in a post office pillar-box at 8:30 pm. About 20 minutes later a second, larger bomb, exploded close to the first. The second bomb injured 20 people including an explosives officer, six policemen and two ambulance men.[25]

Trial

The Balcombe Street four came to trial at the Old Bailey on 24 January 1977. On 9 February 1977, the jury acquitted the defendants on twenty-six of the hundred indictments. On the remaining charges, the Balcombe Street Four were found guilty and each received a thirty-year minimum sentence. All were released on 14 April 1999 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.[74]


Type of attacks

Most of the attacks carried out by the unit were bombings, but they were also involved in several shooting incidents.

The gang used several different methods to deliver and explode their bombs. The unit's favoured method was using hand-thrown bombs. The unit made and used a series of these grenade-like devices. These were small devices with around of gelignite in them with a short fuse attached. The fuse would be lit and then thrown at its target by one volunteer while another volunteer would keep lookout. This method was used in the Woolwich pub bombing of November 1974 and the Waltons bombing of November 1975.

Another common method was making either a time bomb or an incendiary device with a timer on it which would then be planted inside a pub, club, hotel etc. This method was used in the Guildford pub bombings of October 1974 and the Hilton bombing of September 1975. They also detonated a car bomb at Selfridge's department store on Oxford Street in December 1974. Booby-trap bomb were occasionally used, as were letter bombs in post boxes. During these attacks they would also placed a hidden second bomb with a timer nearby to try and kill or injure security services reacting to the initial bombing.

On several occasions they fired shots from rifles and machine guns (usually Sten guns and M1 carbines) into hotels and restaurants, as in the attacks on the Carlton Tower Hotel and the Portman Hotel in January 1975. The gang also shot dead several people, the most famous of whom was _Guinness Book of Records_ founder Ross McWhirter in November 1975.

Nineteen people were killed from the ASU's campaign: 16 from bombings and three from gun attacks. Six of the dead were British military personnel, one was a London police officer, one was a member of the bomb squad and 11 were civilians.


Aftermath

After the Balcombe Street unit was arrested a new active service was sent to England to carry on the bombing campaign in London. This new unit began it's campaign on the 29 January 1976, planting a dozen bombs around London's West End which exploded during the night, another bomb was found which was defused by police.[75] The unit was also responsible for the West Ham station attack which killed one person and injured nine others.[76] And also the carried out the 1976 Olympia bombing which killed one person and injured 85 others, some sersiously.[77] The bombing campaign soon fizzled out after this attack.
