US_Army_Excellence_in_Armor_Coin.png EXCELLENCE IN ARMOR (EIA) is a program of the United States Army that awards outstanding Armor and Cavalry Soldiers whose performance is routinely above the standard and demonstrate superior leadership potential. The EIA was initially proposed in May 1984 and implemented in October 1987. The program rewards outstanding armor and cavalry Soldiers with a Certificate of Achievement, a challenge coin from the U.S. Army's Chief of Armor, awarding of the personnel development skill identifier (PDSI) “E4J,” and will set the Soldier apart from their peers during promotion boards.[1][2][3]

According to U.S. Army Armor School, the EIA program identifies outstanding Armor Branch Soldiers in the ranks of Private (E-1/OR-1) through Sergeant (E-5/OR-5) who have demonstrated performance and leadership potential, either in One Station Unit Training (OSUT) or in Armor and Cavalry units. EIA also applies to Armor and Cavalry Soldiers serving in non-Armor units in the Regular Army, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard. One of the established goals of the program is to "increase combat readiness across Armor and Cavalry units through identification and promotion of highly qualified highly motivated Armor and Cavalry Soldiers and non-commissioned officers.[4]
