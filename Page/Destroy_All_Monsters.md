is a 1968 Japanese _kaiju_ film directed by Ishirō Honda and written by Honda and Takeshi Kimura. The film, which was produced and distributed by Toho Studios, is the ninth film _Godzilla_ franchise, and features the fictional monster characters Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, King Ghidorah, Anguirus, and Minilla. The film stars Akira Kubo, Jun Tazaki, Yukiko Kobayashi and Yoshio Tsuchiya, and features special effects by Sadamasa Arikawa, which were provided under the supervision by Eiji Tsuburaya.

The plot follows the events surrounding various giant monsters, contained in an area known as Monsterland. The monsters are freed from the area and are mind-controlled by aliens known as Kilaaks, who send them to attack major cities. When the monsters are freed from the Kilaaks' influence, the aliens send King Ghidorah to challenge the other monsters.

_Destroy All Monsters_ was released theatrically in Japan on August 1, 1968.


Plot

At the close of the 20th century, all of the Earth's kaiju have been collected by the United Nations Science Committee and confined in an area known as Monsterland, located in the Ogasawara island chain. A special control center is constructed underneath the island to ensure that the monsters stay secure and to serve as a research facility to study them.

When communications with Monsterland are suddenly and mysteriously severed, and all of the monsters begin attacking world capitals, Dr. Yoshida of the UNSC orders Captain Yamabe and the crew of his spaceship, Moonlight SY-3, to investigate Ogasawara. There, they discover that the scientists, led by Dr. Otani, have become mind-controlled slaves of a feminine alien race identifying themselves as the Kilaaks, who reveal that they are in control of the monsters. Their leader demands that the human race surrender, or face total annihilation.

Godzilla attacks New York City, Rodan invades Moscow, Mothra (a larva offspring) lays waste to Beijing, Gorosaurus destroys Paris, (although Baragon was credited for its destruction), and Manda attacks London. These attacks were set in to motion to draw attention away from Japan, so that the aliens can establish an underground stronghold near Mt. Fuji in Japan. The Kilaaks then turn their next major attack on to Tokyo and, without serious opposition, become arrogant in their aims until the UNSC discover, after recovering the Kilaaks' monster mind-control devices from around the world, that they have switched to broadcasting the control signals from their base under the Moon's surface. In a desperate battle, the crew of the SY-3 destroys the Kilaak's lunar outpost and returns the alien control system to Earth.

With all of the monsters under the control of the UNSC, the Kilaaks unleash their hidden weapon, King Ghidorah. The three-headed space monster is dispatched to protect the alien stronghold at Mt. Fuji, and battles Godzilla, Minilla, Mothra, Rodan, Gorosaurus, Anguirus, and Kumonga. While seemingly invincible, King Ghidorah is eventually overpowered by the combined strength of the Earth monsters and is killed. Refusing to admit defeat, the Kilaaks produce their trump card, a burning monster they call the Fire Dragon, which begins to torch Tokyo and destroys the control center on Ogasawara. Suddenly, Godzilla attacks and destroys the Kilaak's underground base, revealing that the Earth's monsters instinctively know who their enemies are. Captain Yamabe then pursues the Fire Dragon in the SY-3 and narrowly achieves victory for the human race. The Fire Dragon is revealed to be a flaming Kilaak saucer and is destroyed. With the Kilaaks defeated, Godzilla and the other monsters eventually return to Monsterland to live in peace.


Cast


Production

Per the waning popularity of the _Godzilla_ series, special effects director Sadamasa Arikawa noted that Toho were going to potentially end the _Godzilla_ series as "Producer Tanaka figured that all the ideas had just run out."

The film was written by Takeshi Kimura and Ishirō Honda, making it the first _Godzilla_ film since _Godzilla Raids Again_ not written by Shinichi Sekizawa. Takeshi Kimura is credited to the pen name Kaoru Mabuchi in the film's credits. Kimura and Honda's script developed the concept of Monsterland (referred to as Monster Island in future films). As the films has several monsters who continuously return in the films, the location was developed to as a faraway island where the monsters are pacified. This tied other films not related to the _Godzilla_ series within its universe, as creatures such as Manda (from _Atragon_) and Varan (_Varan the Unbelievable_) exist. The film features footage from _Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster_ (1964), specifically King Ghidorah's fiery birth scene.

New monster suits for Godzilla and Anguirus were constructed for the film, while Rodan and King Ghidorah suits were modified from previous films, with King Ghidorah having less detail than he had in previous films.


Release

_Destroy All Monsters_ was released in Japan on 1 August 1968 where it was distributed by Toho. It was released on a double bill with a reissue of the film _Atragon_. The film was reissued theatrically in Japan in 1972 where it was re-edited by Honda to a 74-minute running time and released with the title _Gojira: Dengeki Taisakusen_ ( _Godzilla: Lightning Fast Strategy_). _Destroy All Monsters_ continued the decline in ticket sales in Japan for the _Godzilla_ series, earning 2.6 million in ticket sales. In comparison, _Invasion of Astro-Monster_ brought in 3.8 million and _Son of Godzilla_ collected 2.5 million.

The film was released in the United States by American International Pictures with an English-language dub on 23 May 1969. The film premiered in the United States in Cincinnati. American International Pictures hired Titra Studios to dub the film into English. The American version of the film remains relatively close to the Japanese original. Among the more notable removed elements include Akira Ifukube's title theme and a brief shot of Minilla shielding his eyes when King Ghidorah drops Anguirus from the sky. _Destroy All Monsters_ was shown on American television until the early 1980s. It resurfaced on cable broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel in 1996.


Home media

_Destroy All Monsters_ was released on VHS by ADV Films in 1998 which featured English dubbed dialogue from Toho's own International version of the film. In 2011, Tokyo Shock released the film on DVD and Blu-ray and in 2014 the company re-released it on DVD and Blu-ray.[1]


Critical reception

From contemporary reviews, both _Variety_ and _Monthly Film Bulletin_ noted the film's best scenes involved the monsters together, while criticising the filmmaking. _Variety_ reviewed the English-dubbed version of the film stating that it may appeal to "Sci-fi addicts and monster fans" while stating that the "plot is on comic strip level, special effects depend on obvious miniatures and acting (human) is from school of _Flash Gordon_" and that the film's strength relied on its "monster rally". The _Monthly Film Bulletin_ opined that "the model work is poor, and as usual the script is junior comic-strip".[2] Both reviews mentioned the monsters final scene with _Variety_ commenting that it was "clever" and the _Monthly Film Bulletin_ stating that "apart from [the monsters] statutory devastation of world capitals [...] the monsters have disappointingly little to do until they get together in the last reel for a splendid battle"[3] The _Monthly Film Bulletin_ commented that the film was "almost worth sitting through the banalities for the final confrontation on Mount Fuji" noting the son of Godzilla "endearingly applauding from a safe distance" and "the victorious monsters performing a celebratory jig".[4]

From retrospective reviews, Steve Biodrowski of _Cinefantastique_ commented that the film "is too slim in its storyline, too thin in its characterizations, to be considered a truly great film [...] But for the ten-year-old living inside us all, it is entertainment of the most awesome sort."[5] Matt Paprocki of _Blogcritics_ said the film is "far from perfect" and "can be downright boring at times" but felt that "the destruction scenes make up for everything else" and "the final battle is an epic that simply can't be matched".[6]

_Godzilla_ director Gareth Edwards has expressed an interest in making a sequel to his 2014 movie inspired by _Destroy All Monsters_.[7]
