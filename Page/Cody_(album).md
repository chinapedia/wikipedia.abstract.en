_Cody_ marks Joyce Manor's first studio release with drummer Jeff Enzor, who had replaced Kurt Walcher. The album was produced by Rob Schnapf, who had previously worked with Elliott Smith and Guided by Voices.[1] Music videos were produced for the songs "Fake I.D." [2] and "Last You Heard Of Me".[3]


Critical reception

Metacritic, a site that aggregates reviews from critics, gives the album 79 out of 100 based on 16 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[4] In a positive review, Pitchfork's Quinn Moreland praised the risks the band took: "For the first time, a Joyce Manor album includes an acoustic track and a song over four minutes.", while also praising their ability to stay themselves: "[...] every track contains enough blunt expressions of existential despair to tie them to their angsty past."[5] David Sackllah, writing for Consequence of Sound, expressed a similar sentiment: "While not quite an identity crisis, Cody is first and foremost a record of reflection and exploration."
