The JAPAN SELF-DEFENSE FORCE BASE DJIBOUTI () is a military base operated by the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) located near in Ambouli, Djibouti. Aircraft based here use the Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport runway. It is the JSDF's first full-scale, long term overseas base.


Background

Since their establishment in the 1950s following World War II, Japan's Self-Defense Forces have concerned themselves only with defense of the home islands. In the 1990s JSDF contingents were dispatched to Cambodia under the UN and to Iraq to aid in reconstruction efforts. These were relatively short-term missions and used temporary bases.[1]

In 2009, in response to piracy off the coast of Somalia members of the European Union, North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other countries including Japan, China, Australia, and many others deployed personnel, air and naval resources as part of global anti-piracy measures. In 2009 Japan's National Diet passed the "Anti-piracy measures law".

From March 2009 the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) deployed the destroyers JS _Sazanami_ and JS _Samidare_ (DD-106).[2] The JMSDF also deployed two P-3 Orion patrol aircraft to Djibouti, which began patrols on June 11, 2009.[3] From 2009 to 2011 the aircraft operated from Camp Lemonnier, which is run by the United States Navy.[4][5][6]


History

In 2011 the JMSDF established its own base nearby with 180 troops deployed there on a four month rotational basis, with a command headquarters, boarding facilities and parking apron, at a cost of $4.7 billion yen (USD$40 million).[7]

In 2015 two of the JMSDF's new Kawasaki P-1 patrol aircraft deployed to the base, to continue with operational trials within tropical and desert climates.[8][9]

Three Lockheed C-130H Hercules aircraft of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force's 401st Tactical Airlift Squadron were sent to the base in July 2016 to evacuate Japanese citizens from Juba in South Sudan after fighting broke out there.[10][11][12] They were expected to pick up around 70 Japanese citizens.[13]

In August 2016 Tomomi Inada, the then Japanese Minister of Defense, visited the base.[14]

In 2016 it was announced that the Japanese government was considering expanding the 12 hectare site by leasing more land to the east. It was considering deploying C-130 Hercules aircraft and Bushmaster armored vehicles. This was reportedly so that Japan could more easily rescue Japanese citizens in Africa.[15]

From September 25 – October 2, 2017 the SDF conducted a drill in Djibouti to practice rescuing Japanese nationals.[16]

In November 2017 a C-2 of the 403rd Tactical Airlift Squadron deployed to the base for the first time.[17][18]

In November 2017 it was confirmed that the base would be expanded. Currently 12 hectares (30 acres), Japan will lease 3 hectares (7.4 acres) on the eastern side of the SDF base.[19]
