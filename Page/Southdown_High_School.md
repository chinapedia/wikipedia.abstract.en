SOUTHDOWN HIGH SCHOOL was a segregated school for black people in Houma, Louisiana. It was a part of Terrebonne Parish School District [1]

It opened in 1946 as HOUMA COLORED HIGH SCHOOL, and in 1949 it became SOUTH_T_OWN HIGH SCHOOL. In 1952 grades 6-12 began classes and in 1953 the first class graduated. Its name changed to South_d_own High School when it moved into its final location, a St. Charles Street building. Its books originated from the then-white Terrebonne High School and South Terrebonne High School. Eventually it became a grade 9-12 school. In 1969 the school closed due to racial integration, and students moved to South Terrebonne High School and Terrebonne High School.[2]
