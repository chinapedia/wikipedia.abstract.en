, also known as was the 11th Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.[1][2] There is less known about _Suinin_ than his father, and likewise is also considered to be a "legendary emperor". Both the _Kojiki_, and the _Nihon Shoki_ (collectively known as the _Kiki_) record events that took place during Suinin's alleged lifetime. This legendary narrative tells how he ordered his daughter Yamatohime-no-mikoto to establish a new permanent shrine for Amaterasu (the Sun Goddess), which eventually became known as the Ise Grand Shrine. Other events that were recorded concurrently with his reign include the origins of Sumo wrestling in the form of a wrestling match involving Nomi no Sukune.

Suinin's reign is conventionally considered to have been from 29 BC to AD 70.[3] During his alleged lifetime, he fathered seventeen children with two chief wives (empress) and six consorts. One of his sons became the next emperor upon his death in 70 AD, but the location of his father's grave (if any) is unknown. Suinin is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb (_misasagi_) at Nishi-machi, Amagatsuji, Nara City.


Legendary narrative

The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Suinin is currently maintained. There remains no conclusive evidence though that supports this historical figure actually reigning.[4] The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical _Kojiki_ and _Nihon Shoki_, which are collectively known as or _Japanese chronicles_. These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The records state that Suinin was born sometime in 69 BC, and was the third son of Emperor Sujin.[5][6] Suinin's empress mother was named _Mimaki-hime_, who is also former Emperor Kōgen's daughter. Before he was enthroned sometime in 29 BC, his pre-ascension name was Prince _Ikumeiribikoisachi no Sumeramikoto_. He appears to have ascended the throne a year before his father's death in 30 BC, and ruled from the palace of at Makimuku in what later became Yamato Province.

Suinin is best known for events that surround the founding of the Ise Grand Shrine. The _Nihon Shoki_ states that around 2,000 years ago the Emperor ordered his daughter Yamatohime-no-mikoto, to find a permanent location to worship the goddess Amaterasu-ōmikami (the Sun Goddess).[7][8] Yamatohime searched for 20 years before settling on a location in Ise, where she established Naiku, the Inner Shrine.[9][10] She is said to have chosen the location after she heard the voice of Amaterasu say; "(Ise) is a secluded and pleasant land. In this land I wish to dwell." Amaterasu had previously been enshrined and worshipped in Kasanui, which was set up by Suinin's father in an attempt to alleviate a devastating plaque. The _Kojiki_ records that during the reign of Emperor Suinin, the first _Saiō_ (High Priestess) was appointed for Ise Grand Shrine. This recording is also noted by _Jien_, who was a 13th-century historian and poet.[11] This remains disputed though, as the Man'yōshū (The Anthology of Ten Thousand Leaves) states that the first Saiō to serve at Ise was Princess Ōku. If the latter is true then it would date the Saiō appointments to the reign of Emperor Tenmu ( – 686 AD).[12]

There were other events during Suinin's reign as well that include a Asama Shrine tradition regarding Mount Fuji. The earliest veneration of Konohanasakuya-hime at the base of the mountain was said to be during the 3rd year of Emperor Suinin's reign.[13] The _Nihon Shoki_ also records a wrestling match in which _Nomi no Sukune_ and _Taima no Kehaya_ held during his era, as the origin of _Sumai_ (Sumo wrestling). Meanwhile, Emperor Suinin's family grew to consist of 17 children with eight variously ranked wives. One of his consorts named _Kaguya-him-no-Mikoto_, is mentioned in the _Kojiki_ as a possible basis for the legend of Kaguya-hime regarding the couple's love story. Emperor Suinin died in 70 AD at the age of 138, and his son Prince _Ootarashihikoosirowake_ was enthroned as the next emperor the following year.[14]


Known information

]] Emperor Suinin is regarded by historians as a "legendary Emperor" as there is insufficient material available for further verification and study.[15] Unlike Emperor Sujin, there is less known about Suinin to possibly support his existence. In either case (fictional or not), the name Suinin_-tennō_ was assigned to him posthumously by later generations.[16] His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Suinin, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the Yamato dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the _Kojiki_.[17] Suinin's longevity was also written down by later compliers, who may have unrealistically extended his age to fill in time gaps.[18] While the actual site of Suinin's grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (_misasagi_) at Nishi-machi, Amagatsuji, Nara City. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Suinin's mausoleum, and is formally named _Sugawara no Fushimi no higashi no misasagi_.[19][20]

While the Ise Grand Shrine is traditionally said to have been established in the 1st century BC, other dates in the 3rd and 4th centuries have also been put forward for the establishment of Naikū and Gekū respectively.[21] The first shrine building at Naikū was allegedly erected by Emperor Tenmu (678-686), with the first ceremonial rebuilding being carried out by his wife, Empress Jitō, in 692.[22] Outside of the Kiki, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates.[23] The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as "traditional" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.[24]


Consorts and children

Emperor Suinin had two chief wives (aka Empress), it is recorded in the Kiki that the first empress was named Saho. Not much is known about her other than that her father was Emperor Kaika's son and she allegedly died sometime in 34 AD. As with the first empress there is also not much known about Suinin's second chief wife Hibasu. She was the daughter Prince Tanba-no-Michinoushi, who was Prince Hikoimasu's son and Emperor Kaika's grandson. Hibasu's third son later became known as Emperor Keikō (the next emperor), she allegedly died sometime in 61 AD. Suinin also had six named consorts with an additional one remaining unknown. Prince Tanba-no-Michinoushi (previously mentioned), was also the father to three of Suinin's consorts. In all the Emperor's family consisted of 17 children with these variously ranked wives.
