SEISMIC PRODUCTIONS is a Los Angeles based creative marketing company that creates trailers, television spots, and other marketing tools for the entertainment industry.


History

Seismic Productions was founded in 1989 under the co-ownership of David Schneiderman and Kevin Sewelson. Schneiderman initially began his career at J. Walter Thompson advertising agency in New York before moving out west to work for Disney in 1986. In 1998, Erin Wyatt joined the company, and after a few years was working as an editor. In 2010, Wyatt was made a partner, and in 2011 Sewelson exited Seismic, leaving Schneiderman and Wyatt as the remaining partners.

Since its founding, the company has expanded from its roots in independent cinema (_Fargo_, _The Crying Game_, _Four Weddings and a Funeral_) to larger commercial projects, including the critically acclaimed campaigns for _The Devil Wears Prada_, _Les Mis√©rables_, and _Brokeback Mountain_, the latter of which was later parodied in its entirety on _Saturday Night Live_.[1] The company has since moved into exploring social media marketing and creative content for companies such as Netflix and Amazon.[2]


Recent Awards

Seismic Productions has garnered dozens of nominations and awards, including two Clio Awards for their work on _American Sniper_ and _American Ultra_, and numerous Golden Trailer Awards, including the Best Drama TV Spot Award for _American Sniper_.[3][4]

In November 2016, Seismic's trailer for _Beauty and the Beast_ broke the record for most views in 24 hours with 127.6 million views.[5]
