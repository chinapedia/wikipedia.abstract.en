Plot

The film revolves around three people: Chellappa (Saravanan), Saroja (Ahana) and Sudalamani (Vasu Vikram). Chellappa is a smart college student from a poor family, he lives with his widow mother Thangamma (Vaani). Saroja is the daughter of the village chief (S. S. Chandran) and arrogant Rasathi (Srividya). Sudalamani is Saroja's relative and a womanizer who teases the village girls. He wants to get married to Saroja to gain her property. One day, Chellappa beats up Sudalamani and they land at Saroja's house. At the village court, Chellappa remains silent. Irritated by his reaction, she gets him suspended from the college. She later comes to know that Chellappa saved a blind girl from the pervert Sudalamani, but Chellappa remains silent at the village court to protect the blind girl's privacy.

Saroja wrongly accuses Chellappa of kidnapping her and holding her for a day. Chellappa accepts the blame and he says he did much worse. The villagers advise her to get married to Chellappa. The shrewish Rasathi refuses and tries to find a bribe for her daughter, but nobody was ready to get married to an unchaste woman. Only Sudalamani accepts for marriage and they arrange their wedding. The day before their wedding, the villagers force Chellappa to get married to Saroja. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.
