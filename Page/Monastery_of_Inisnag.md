The MONASTERY OF ENNISNAG ( and meaning "_the Island or Islet of the Crane or Heron_") was an early Irish Christian monastery, and later a medieval prebendal church, located at Ennisnag, in County Kilkenny, Ireland. The medieval monastery and church are no longer extant. From the ruins, St Peter's church, of Protestant denomination, was established in the early 19th century.


Monastery of Inis-Snaig

Little is known about the monastic community here. Canon William Carrigan suggested "_an ancient Church stood on the site from time immemorial to after the Cromwellian era_". John O'Hanlon reported that Diocese of Ossory ecclesiastical records names Saint Manchan as patron saint writing "_at Inisnag, diocese of Ossory, St. Manchan, whose feast occurs on the 14th of February, was venerated as a patron (Statuta Dioecesis Ossoriensis)_". This implies the church was founded in the fifth, or early sixth century. The _monastery of Inis-Snaig_ was probably small in scale.

Modern tradition names Máedóc of Ferns as patron saint of Ennisnag though the claim "his feast day was celebrated here on the 14th of February" suggests confusion regarding patron Saints.{{#tag:ref|In the Old Calendar 14 February is the feast day of Saint Manchan, not Máedóc of Ferns (29 January). The foundation by Manchan would date the early church to late 5th century or first decades of the 6th century.|group=n|name=feastdayconfusion}} Nevertheless, his holy well called "Tobermogue" () is preserved.

The Annals of the Four Masters has an entry for AD745, recalling the "battle of Inis Snaig", between "Anmchaidh mac Cucearca", king of Osraighe, and an unknown opponent, and an entry for AD 889, "_the death of "Suadhbhar mac Coitceadhach, of Inis Snaig, died an anchorite_", confirming the early Christian Irish monastery of _Inis Snaig_ flourished in at least the ninth century, but probably from the early Middle Ages to sometime before, or after, the Norman invasion of the 12th century.


Prebend of Inisnag

The church of _Inisnag_ was recorded as prebendal of Ossory diocese, in the Taxatio Ecclesiastica of AD 1291-1292. The Treasurer of the Diocesan Chapter of Ossory, possessed the prebend of Ennisnag from the 15th century. This Diocesan Chapter, consisted of a Dean, Archdeacon, Chancellor, precentor and Treasurer, is traceable back to Felix O'Dulaney (1178-1202), the late 12th century onwards. The prebendal church of Ennisnag is included in the list of churches, or parishes, possessed by ecclesiastics of the Diocesan Chapter of Ossory, right down to the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. According to a papal document titled "_Ecllesia De Inisnage Prebend -£ ix._", preserved by the Protestant Bishop of Ossory, with Rev. James Graves once holding a correct transcript of same, the _prebend of Inisnag_ was granted on "the authority of Pope Nicholas IV, 1291 [liber ruber Ossoriensis]".

The medieval church fell into ruins after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and upheavals of 17th century Ireland.
