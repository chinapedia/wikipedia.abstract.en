MEYER VON SCHAUENSEE was a family of the patriciate of Lucerne in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. The family is descended from Andreas Meyer, member of the Lucerne Grand Council in 1523, and his son Leodegar, member of the Lesser Council in 1581. From 1618, the Meyer and Balthasar families acquired considerable wealth due to their control of the trade with Milan.


Life

Originally named _Meyer_, Joseph Leonz Meyer (1695–1764) acquired Schauensee castle near Kriens in 1749. He and his direct descendants called themselves "von Schauensee" from this time, and the entire Meyer family officially adopted the "von Schauensee" byname in 1895. Historiography in the 20th century has tended to anachronistically use the name of "Meyer von Schauensee" of all members of the Meyer family in the later 19th century, while historically only the direct descendants of Joseph Leonz used this name prior to 1985.
