_BURIOLESTES_ (meaning "Buriol's robber") is a genus of early sauropodomorph dinosaurs from the Late Triassic Santa Maria Formation of the Paraná Basin in southeastern Brazil. It contains one species, _B. SCHULTZI_, named in 2016. The type specimen was found alongside a specimen of the lagerpetid dinosauromorph _Ixalerpeton_.[1]


Description

Buriolestes_skull_color_coded.png Although _Buriolestes_ superficially resembles the predatory theropod dinosaurs, with jaws lined by finely serrated and slightly curved teeth well-adapted to a carnivorous diet, it is in fact an early member of the otherwise-herbivorous Sauropodomorpha, the group that gave rise to the giant sauropods. Characteristically sauropodomorph traits seen in _Buriolestes_ include a downturned jaw tip and a long deltopectoral crest on the humerus. However, _Buriolestes_ also lacks a small head and enlarged nostrils, which are typical among sauropodomorphs, and the medial condyle on the end of its tibia projects backwards, a distinctive feature (autapomorphy) unique to this animal.[2]

In _Buriolestes_, the shaft of the pubis is straight, in contrast to later sauropodomorphs, where it has been modified into an expanded "apron", theropods, where it forms a "boot", and all ornithischians, where it is reversed and is parallel to the ischium. Additional traits differentiate _Buriolestes_ from both later and contemporary sauropodmorphs: the front expansion (preacetabular ala) of the ilium is relatively tall, the outer edges of the pubis are bevelled, the trochanter of the femur forms a shelf, and the metatarsal of the fifth digit on the foot is relatively long.[3] Buriolestes_schultzi_restoration.png


Discovery and naming

Skeletal_reconstruction_of_Buriolestes_schultzi.png The holotype specimen, ULBRA-PVT280, was discovered in the Buriol ravine in São João do Polêsine, Brazil. These rocks are part of the Santa Maria Formation, which dates to the Carnian epoch. The specimen consists of a single skeleton preserving parts of the skull, vertebrae, left forelimb, and left hindlimb. Another set of smaller bones is also present, which may belong to a juvenile or a different taxon altogether. Two individuals of _Ixalerpeton_ were also preserved close by.[4]

Additional remains were described in 2018. These include a mostly complete skeleton, CAPPA/UFSM 0035, which preserves a complete skull and most bones apart from tail vertebrae. Additional dinosaur bones from the Buriol locality may also belong to _Buriolestes_, but their assignment is uncertain. They include a femur (ULBRA-PVT289), a portion of an individual's hip and hindlimbs (ULBRA-PVT056), and a lone axis vertebra (CAPPA/UFSM 0179). These new finds have made _Buriolestes_ among the most complete Triassic dinosaurs known, comparable to _Eoraptor_, _Herrerasaurus_, and _Coelophysis_.[5]

In 2016, the specimen was named _Buriolestes_ after the Buriol family; the suffix _-lestes_ is Greek for "robber". The specific name honours palaeontologist Cezar Schultz.[6]


Classification

A phylogenetic analysis conducted in 2016 affirmed the sauropodomorph affinities of _Buriolestes_. Part of the phylogenetic tree from the study is shown below.[7] Buriolestes_schultzi_size_comparison.png Five variants of phylogenetic analyses published earlier were used along with the description of the new specimens in 2018. One of these analyses, based on Langer _et al._ (2017)[8] placed _Buriolestes_ in a clade of early sauropodomorphs, alongside _Eoraptor_, _Panphagia_, _Pampadromaeus_, and _Saturnalia_. Another analysis, which used the dataset of _Buriolestes_' original description with the added parameter of implied weighting, placed it as the sister taxon to _Eoraptor_, with the _Buriolestes_+_Eoraptor_ clade sister to a clade connecting _Panphagia_ and _Pampadromaeus_. The other three analyses, which also corresponded to the original description's dataset, agreed with that study's placement of _Buriolestes_ as the single most basal sauropodomorph.[9]


Paleoecology

Buriolestes_teeth.jpg The shape of the teeth of _Buriolestes_ suggest that it was a carnivore which fed on small vertebrates and invertebrates, which provides evidence that sauropodomorphs - and likely all saurischians and dinosaurs as a whole - were ancestrally carnivorous, and that sauropodomorphs, ornithischians, and various groups of theropods independently became herbivorous.[10]

The co-occurrence of _Buriolestes_ and _Ixalerpeton_ parallels the simultaneous presence of dinosaurs and non-dinosaur dinosauromorphs at other sites (such as the Ischigualasto[11] and Chinle[12] Formations), suggesting that, after their initial evolutionary radiation, dinosaurs did not rapidly replace their dinosauromorph precursors.[13]
