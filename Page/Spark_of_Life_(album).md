_SPARK OF LIFE_ is an album by Polish jazz pianist and composer Marcin Wasilewski's Trio with saxophonist Joakim Milder recorded in 2014 and released on the ECM label.[1][2][3]


Reception

In JazzTimes Jeff Tamarkin wrote "Wasilewski and his compatriots habitually roll out one stately, even-tempered melody after the next, giving each plenty of simmer time before ultimately coming out the other side, regardless of what happens along the way, without having broken a sweat. (This is an ECM record, after all.)".[4] The Guardian critic John Fordham noted "It’s all right up to Wasilewski Trio standards, and Milder is a shadowy but fascinating presence".[5] On _All About Jazz_ John Kelman observed "_Spark of Life_ is another stellar collection from a trio predicated on the value of longevity and leveraging the opportunities this now late-thirty-something trio has been afforded to build a language all its own ... With the addition of Milder on roughly half of this 74-minute program, the Marcin Wasilewski Trio has managed to retain its core strengths while adding something new to avoid any pitfalls of predictability".[6]
