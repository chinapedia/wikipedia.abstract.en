_ERETMOCERA RUBRIPENNIS_ is a moth of the Scythrididae family. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1915. It is found in southern India.[1]

The wingspan is 11–12 mm. The forewings are glossy rather dark bronzy-grey, sometimes with some whitish-ochreous suffusion on the fold at one-third of the wing, as well as a cloudy whitish-ochreous spot on the costa at three-fourths, and another on the dorsum towards the tornus obliquely before it. The hindwings are light rose-pink, the apex and sometimes the upper part of the terminal edge dark grey.[2]
