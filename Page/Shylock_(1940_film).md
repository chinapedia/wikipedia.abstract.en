Production

Kinema Ramu, a lawyer based in Kumbakonam and scholar on William Shakespeare, wrote the dialogue for _Shylock_, a Tamil adaptation of Shakespeare's play _The Merchant of Venice_. He and his friend Serukalathur Sama directed the film under the name Sama-Ramu. Sama also played the title character. The lyricists were Yaanai Vaidyanatha Iyer, P. S. Sivaramalingam (who acted onscreen as the Duke) and Papanasam Rajagopala Iyer, brother of Papanasam Sivan. S. G. Kasi Iyer, the brother of Tamil theatre actor S. G. Kittappa, was the music director, besides playing Antonio onscreen. Portia was played by T. V. Janakam, and Bassanio by T. S. Santhanam. Shooting took place at Bharat Movietone in Kilpauk.[2] The makers went to great lengths to recreate an authentic Venetian look for the narrative through the costumes and setting.[3]


Release and reception

The film did not succeed commercially as audiences could not relate to the characters, costumes and sets.[4] However, film historian Randor Guy praised it for remaining faithful to the source material, the performances of the cast, and the costumes and sets.[5] No print of the film is known to survive, making it a lost film.[6][7]
