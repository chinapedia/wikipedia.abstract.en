  Ancient times   The Ancient Romans make a huge input into medicine and health. Their approach is mainly concerned with public health schemes. Much of Ancient Roman medicine is learned from Ancient Greeks. The Romans believe that illnesses have a natural cause and that bad health could be caused by bad water and sewage.[1]
  Middle Age      The Schola Medica Salernitana is the first medical school of modern history, and today is considered a fundamental institution in order to understand Medieval medicine. Bologna and Padua also develop as important medical centers. The Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum is written as the Code of Health, which becomes popular in Europe for many centuries. Medieval hygienists believe very much in early rising, cold water, thorough cleansing, and exercise in the open air.[2]
  16th century    With the Renaissance, comes an increase in experimental investigation, principally in the field of dissection and body examination, thus advancing the knowledge of human anatomy.[3] Italian physician Girolamo Fracastoro suggests that infectious diseases are caused by 'disease seeds', which are carried by the wind or transmitted by touch.[4]
  17th century    Medicine continues to advance. Venetian physician Santorio Santorio invents the medical thermometer.[5]
  18th century    Medicine makes slow progress. Doctors still do not know what causes disease. Bernardino Ramazzini is regarded as the father of occupational medicine.[6]
  19th century    Italy unifies. Healthcare relies on several different structures. Some of them are healthcare centers sponsored by the Catholic Church, others are old charitable institutions nationalized by the new liberal state. There is also a provincial network for preventive medicine and public health, municipal provisions for economic and social assistance to disabled and needy people.[7]
  1922â€“1943       Fascist regime. Several changes in the Italian healthcare system are pushed forward. Right to hospital care for the needy is guaranteed for the first time. Several initiatives targeting diseases of perceived social relevance are launched. Treatment of venereal diseases becomes free, and several centers for cancer diagnosis are created. Provincial authorities in charge of treating tuberculosis are established and tuberculosis insurance becomes compulsory.[8]
  1930s           Health insurance funds become responsible for covering not only workers but also their dependents.[9]
  1950s           An independent Ministry of Health is established for the first time.[10]
  1970s           Italy launches universal healthcare. Public health facilities start to be launched.[11]
  Present time    Today, Italy maintains a universal public healthcare system, and healthcare is provided to all citizens and residents by a mixed public-private approach. The Italian health system is regarded among the best in the world, and the life expectancy of Italy is also one of the highest.[12]
