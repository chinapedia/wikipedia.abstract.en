KEITH MATTHEW THORNTON (born October 7, 1963), better known by his stage name KOOL KEITH, is an American rapper from The Bronx, New York known for his surreal, abstract and often profane or incomprehensible lyrics. Kool Keith has recorded prolifically both as a solo artist and in group collaborations. Kool Keith is generally considered[1] to be one of hip-hop's most eccentric and unusual personalities.

Kool Keith was a cofounding member of Ultramagnetic MCs, whose debut _Critical Beatdown_ was released in 1988. After two more albums with the group, _Funk Your Head Up_ and _The Four Horsemen_, Kool Keith released his critically acclaimed solo debut album, _Dr. Octagonecologyst_ under the name Dr. Octagon in 1996. He subsequently released a series of further independently released hip hop albums, including _Sex Style_ and _First Come, First Served_ (as Dr. Dooom).

After releasing only one album on a major label, _Black Elvis/Lost in Space_, Kool Keith subsequently returned to independently releasing music, producing further efforts as a solo artist and in collaboration with groups such as Analog Brothers, Masters of Illusion, Thee Undatakerz and Project Polaroid. Kool Keith has also made guest appearances in collaboration with Peeping Tom and Yeah Yeah Yeahs. He was also featured on the short track DDT on Jurassic 5's album _Power in Numbers_. The Prodigy's hit "Smack My Bitch Up" was based on a sample of Kool Keith's voice saying "Change my pitch up. Smack my bitch up."


History

Ultramagnetic MCs (1984–1993)

Kool Keith began his career with the group Ultramagnetic MCs. After the release of their influential 1988 album _Critical Beatdown_, Thornton was reportedly institutionalized in Bellevue Hospital Center.[2][3] However, he later said that the idea that he was institutionalized came from a flippant remark made during an interview, and he never expected the story to become so well known.[4]

After continuing with Ultramagnetic for two more albums (1992's _Funk Your Head Up_ and 1993's _The Four Horsemen_), Thornton would embark on a solo career.

Dr. Octagon debuts (1995–1996)

Thornton released his first notable solo single, "Earth People", in 1995, under the name Dr. Octagon. This was followed by the release of _Dr. Octagonecologyst_ the following year. The album's production by Dan the Automator and Kutmasta Kurt, with scratching by DJ Qbert was acclaimed by critics, and the album was released nationally by DreamWorks Records in 1997, after an initial release on the smaller Bulk Recordings label (as, simply, _Dr. Octagon_) a year prior. DreamWorks also issued an instrumental version of the album, titled _Instrumentalyst (Octagon Beats)_.[5][6]

Further releases (1997–1999)

Thornton followed the _Dr. Octagonecologyst_ album with _Sex Style_ in 1997, under the name Kool Keith.

In 1996, Thornton collaborated with Tim Dog for the single "The Industry is Wack", performing under the name Ultra[7][8]—the album _Big Time_ soon followed. In 1999, he released the album _First Come, First Served_ under the name "Dr. Dooom", in which the album's main character killed off Dr. Octagon on the album's opening track. The same year, on August 10, 1999, Thornton released _Black Elvis/Lost in Space_. It peaked at #10 on the _Billboard_ Heatseekers chart, #74 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and #180 on the _Billboard_ 200,[9] and stands as Thornton's most commercially successful project to date.

Collaborations (2000–2001)

On July 25, 2000, Thornton released the album _Matthew_. It peaked at #47 on the _Billboard_ Heatseekers chart.[10] The same year, Thornton collaborated with Ice-T, Marc Live, Black Silver and Pimp Rex for the album _Pimp to Eat_, under the group name Analog Brothers, with Keith performing as Keith Korg and Ice-T as Ice Oscillator.[11]

On June 5, 2001, Thornton released the album _Spankmaster_ on Gothom Records.[12] It peaked at #16 on the _Billboard_ Heatseekers chart, #11 on the Top Independent Albums chart and #48 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.[13]

Second Dr. Octagon album (2002–2004)

In 2002, Thornton began recording _The Resurrection of Dr. Octagon_ with producer Fanatik J,[14][15] signing a contract with CMH Records to release the album, which was eventually completed without much input from Thornton, due to a falling out over contractual terms.[16]

On October 12, 2004, Real Talk Entertainment issued the album _Dr. Octagon Part 2_. The album was discontinued by court order. On June 27, _The Return of Dr. Octagon_ was released by OCD International, an imprint of CMH, advertised as the official follow-up to _Dr. Octagonecologyst_.[17] Some critics felt that it was not as good as its predecessor.[18][19] Thornton stated that he liked the album, but felt that it hurt his reputation as a musician.[20] In August, Thornton performed under the Dr. Octagon billing, but did not acknowledge the release of the OCD album.[21]

Further collaborations and solo albums (2002 onward)

Thornton, Marc Live and H-Bomb formed the group KHM, releasing the album _Game_ on November 19, 2002, changing their name to "Clayborne Family" by the release of their second album.[22]

On April 25, 2006, Thornton released the album _Nogatco Rd._ under the name Mr. Nogatco.[23]

In 2007, Ultramagnetic MCs released the reunion album _The Best Kept Secret_.[24] In 2009, Kool Keith released the concept album _Tashan Dorrsett_; a follow-up, _The Legend of Tashan Dorrsett_, followed two years later.[25] In 2012, Kool Keith performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos.[26] He has stated that he is considering retiring from music.[27] In 2013, Keith appeared as Dr. Octagon on the Yeah Yeah Yeahs song "Buried Alive", from their album _Mosquito_. In 2015, Keith released "Time? Astonishing!" with producer L'Orange and began the start of his relationship with Mello Music Group.[28] Since then, Keith also re-issued his group album with the Analog Brothers (Ice-T, Pimp Rex, Marc Live, Silver Synth) "Pimp To Eat" with Mello Music.[29] Kool Keith's recent solo album _Feature Magnetic_ was dropped on September 16, 2016 and it features MF DOOM, Slug from Atmosphere, Dirt Nasty and many others.[30] Artwork for the "Feature Magnetic" album was produced by Marc Santo.

In 2018, Keith collaborated once again with Dan the Automator and DJ Qbert for another Dr. Octagon album.[31][32] _Moosebumps: An Exploration Into Modern Day Horripilation_ was released on streaming services on April 6, 2018,[33] with the physical release scheduled for Record Store Day,[34] April 21, 2018. The Record Store Day release includes both vinyl and CD copies. Using his Deltron persona, Del the Funky Homosapien guests on "3030 Meets the Doc, Pt. 1". NPR offered a first look at the album on March 29, 2018.[35] Kool Keith appears on "Western" by the bluegrass-rap group Gangstagrass, performing as himself.

Thornton's fan site refers to his discography of roughly fifty album releases, most of which have been commercially released. Singles such as "Spectrum" continue to appear online under the artist's name, on sites such as SoundCloud and Spotify.


Lyrical and performance style

Kool-Keith-2009.jpg.]] Thornton's lyrics are often abstract,[36] surreal,[37] and filled with non-sequiturs and profane humor.[38] Thornton is also known for an explicit style focusing on sexual themes, which Thornton has referred to as "pornocore".[39][40] In a 2007 interview, Thornton claims to have "invented horrorcore".[41]

Thornton's lyrics are particularly dense, and he is a master of internal rhyme. His extensive use of internal rhyme pre-dates Eminem and other artists who have embraced this style.

In reference to his relationship between himself and his various stage personalities, Keith has said, "I don't even feel like I'm a human being anymore."[42]
