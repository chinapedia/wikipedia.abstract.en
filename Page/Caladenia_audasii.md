_CALADENIA AUDASII_ is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to Victoria. It is a rare ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and a single yellow flower.


Description

_Caladenia audasii_ is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy leaf, long and wide.[1]

A single yellow flower in diameter is borne on a spike high. The petals and sepals are long and spreading, the petals somewhat shorter than the sepals. The petals and lateral sepals are wide and taper to a thread-like end covered with glandular hairs. The labellum is curved with the tip rolled under and has erect lateral lobes. It is about long and wide when flattened. The edges of the labellum are scalloped and the middle lobe has short, broad teeth. There are six rows of stalkless calli along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from September to November.[2][3]


Taxonomy and naming

The species was first formally described by Richard Rogers in 1927 and the description was published in _Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia_. The type specimen was collected on Mount McIvor near Bendigo.[4][5] The specific epithet (audasii) honours James Wales Clarendon Audas, a member of staff at the National Herbarium of Victoria.[6]


Distribution and habitat

Only five plants of this orchid species were known in 2000, growing in grassy Boxâ€“ironbark forest in three disjunct populations near Bendigo, Kingower and Deep Lead north-west of Stawell. It is extinct in South Australia.[7] In June 2015, thirty new plants were introduced into the Greater Bendigo National Park.[8]


Conservation

This species is classified as "Endangered" under the Commonwealth Government _Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999_ (EPBC) Act.[9]
