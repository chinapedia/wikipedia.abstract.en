AMANDA HESSER (born 1971) is an American food writer, editor, cookbook author and entrepreneur. Most notably, she was the food editor of _The New York Times Magazine_, the editor of _T Living_, a quarterly publication of _The New York Times_, author of The Essential New York Times Cookbook which was a _New York Times_ bestseller, and co-founder and CEO of Food52.

After finishing her first book, in 1997, Hesser was hired as a food reporter for _The New York Times_ where she wrote more than 750 stories. While at the _Times_ Hesser wrote about the influence of Costco on the wine industry, and how the Farmer Consumer Advisory Committee made decisions for the New York City Greenmarket.[1] She was also among the first to write about Ferran Adria of El Bulli in a major American publication.[2]

Hesser was involved in two cases of conflict of interest while working at the _Times_. In 2004, she awarded the restaurant Spice Market a three-star rating without disclosing that the year before, the restaurant's owner, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, had provided a complimentary jacket blurb for her book _Cooking for Mr. Latte_. In 2007, Hesser published a favorable review of _Vegetable Harvest_ by Patricia Wells, without noting that in 1999, Wells had provided a jacket blurb for Hesser's book _The Cook and the Gardener_. In both cases, the _Times_ subsequently pointed out the conflicts of interest with editorsâ€™ notes.[3][4]

While Hesser left the _Times_ in March 2008 to focus on the development of Food52 she continued to write the "Recipe Redux" feature for the _Times_ magazine until February 27, 2011.[5][6]

As co-founder and CEO of Food52 she has raised two rounds of investment from parties including Lerer Hippeau Ventures and Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments. Food52 has won numerous notable awards including the James Beard Award for Publication of the Year (2012)[7] and the IACP Award for Best Website (2013). In February 2017, noting that 92 percent of the company was white, she and her co-founder Merrill Stubbs "issued a statement about the ways in which the company intended to redress a lack of racial equality in its workplace." By the following January, "they published a follow-up letter updating readers on the progress of their efforts, stating that their staff had been reduced to being 76 percent white."[8]

Hesser was featured in _Food & Wine_'s _40 under 40_[9] list, was named one of the 50 most influential women in food by _Gourmet_ Magazine, and had a cameo as herself in the film _Julie & Julia_.[10]

Hesser lives in Brooklyn Heights with her husband, Tad Friend,[11] a staff writer for _The New Yorker_, and their two children.
