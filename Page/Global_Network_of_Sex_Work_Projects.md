GLOBAL NETWORK OF SEX WORK PROJECTS (NSWP) is an organisation that advocates for the health and human rights of sex workers.[1] It is a private not for profit limited company, based in Edinburgh, Scotland, and founded in November 1990.[2] NSWP is a membership organisation, with members from five regions (Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America and North America & the Caribbean). NSWP publishes resources, including briefing papers, policy briefs, community guides, global and regional reports, smart guides, statements, the _Research for Sex Work Journal_ and case studies. It supports the decriminalisation of sex work.[3]

NSWP advocates for sex worker representation at international policy forums. It "credits itself as largely responsible for “sex work” replacing “prostitution” as the go-to terminology for institutions such as the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO)."[4]


Manifesto

NSWP's website states:

  "NSWP amplifies the voices of sex worker-led organisations advocating for rights-based services, freedom from abuse and discrimination, freedom from punitive laws, policies and practices, and self-determination for sex workers. NSWP works primarily with sex worker-led regional networks and facilitates sex worker-led capacity building."[5]


History

Global Network of Sex Work Projects was founded in November 1990 at the 2nd International Conference for NGOs working on AIDS[6] and was registered in the UK in 2008.[7][8]

In 2008 it received $60000 in grant funding from Open Society Foundations.[9]

In 2009 it was appointed co-chair of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) ‘Advisory Group on HIV and Sex Work’,[10] established to "review and participate in the development of UNAIDS policy, programme or advocacy documents, or statements."
