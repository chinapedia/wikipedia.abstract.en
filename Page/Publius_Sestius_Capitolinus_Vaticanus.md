PUBLIUS SESTIUS CAPITOLINUS VATICANUS was a Roman politician in the 5th century BC, consul in 452 BC and decemvir in 451 BC.


Family

He was a member of the _Gens Sestii_. He was the son of Quintus and his complete name is _Publius Sestius Q.f. Vibi.n. Capitolinus Vaticanus_. Livy gives the form _Sextius_[1] then _Sestius_.[2] Dionysius of Halicarnassus uses the form _Siccius_. His _cognomen_ _Capitolinus_ is not certain - we also see _Capito_ being used. He was the only member of his family to attain the rank of consul.


Biography

Consulship

In 452 BC, he was consul with Titus Menenius Lanatus.[3] During their consulship, the delegates left to study Greek law in Athens. After returning to Rome, the tribunes of the plebs called together officials to create a commission to write the law down. Publius Sestius supported this proposition, contrary to his colleague Titus Menenius, who pondered the question before falling ill - then was rendered inactive until the end of his term as consul. Publius Sestius refused to take sole initiative in creating the commission, and so deferred the decision to the following year.[4]

_Decemvirate_

In 451 BC, because of his vocal support, he was taken into the first commission of the decemvirs which drew up the first ten tables of the Law of the Twelve Tables.[5][6][7]
