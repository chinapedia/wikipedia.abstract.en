Critical reception

According to review aggregator Metacritic, _Dad Country_ received generally favorable reviews from critics.[2] For example, Robert Christgau gave the album an A-, and said that it "presents [Fritz] as an ordinary Southern-accented male with an unusually high-strung larynx who goes to bars and forgets the garbage and bathes in the holy pool of the Mount of Venus and catches sick and drives 250 miles to get tossed from your birthday party just like any other fella."[3]
