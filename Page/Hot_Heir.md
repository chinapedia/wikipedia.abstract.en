_HOT HEIR_ aka The Great Balloon Chase, is a 1984 3D comedy film starring Curtis Credel, Dianne Beatty, Ron Campbell. It was the second of six 3-D movies produced by Earl Owensby during the 1980s. HOT HEIR (aka The Great Balloon Chase) was shot in Summer/Fall of 1982, and contains stunning stereoscopic photography, especially of the balloons themselves.

The Freedom Weekend Aloft festival was specially created in order to bring together the hot air balloons necessary for filming. It subsequently became an annual event.[1]
