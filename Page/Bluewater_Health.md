History

There were several doctors in the Sarnia community in 1880, but because there was no hospital in the area, serious medical help had to be sought in London, to the east. On July 7, 1890, a public meeting was held to canvas for subscriptions for a hospital. By 1895, $13,000 had been raised. A three-story hospital with 26 beds was opened on October 3, 1896 at a cost of about $25,000.[7]

The hospital was operated by a trust until 1920 when it was given to the City and became a municipally-operated hospital. Stress on the hospital became severe with an admission of about 800 patients a year. In 1929, about 80 beds were added, which met the needs of the community until 1952. In January 1953, the hospital doors were closed while construction of a new five-story building took place. The new hospital opened in March 1954 at a cost of about $2.7 million, and had enough beds for 266 adults and 50 newborns.

By November 1963, expansion of the facility led to a capacity of 315 beds at a cost of about $1.5 million.[8]
