_MORGANA ROBINSON'S THE AGENCY_ is a British mockumentary about fictional talent agency Mann Management, with impressions by Morgana Robinson. In a seven-part show, Robinson plays the roster of talent agent Vincent Mann. It was broadcast on BBC Two from September 2016.

The premise of the programme is that Vincent has allowed a documentary crew access to his celebrity clients, including Miranda Hart, Natalie Cassidy, Russell Brand, Joanna Lumley, Gregg Wallace, Mel and Sue, Danny Dyer and Adele, all of whom are played by Robinson.[1] Critical reception was largely positive.[2]

The shows additional cast members include Oliver Maltman, Terry Mynott, Matthew Steer, Cariad Lloyd and Matt Berry.


Reception

Robinson has received praise for her impersonations, with Georgina Littlejohn of _The Sun_ describing them as "wickedly accurate,"[3] and the _Daily Mail's_ Christopher Stevens writing that Robinson is "an outstanding impressionist." Stevens also gave the show four stars out of five, saying it is Robinson's "best show yet", but was critical of the amount of coverage given to the Natalie Cassidy scenes, writing: "the problem wasn’t a shortage of ideas or characters — more likely that she simply can’t get enough of doing Natalie."[4] Lucy Mangan of _The Guardian_ says the programme "is just what we need in this strife-strewn year."[5] In comparing it to Rory Bremner's political satire which he describes as "sharp", Mat Baylis of the _Daily Express_ describes the show as "sharp, too, but in a less appealing way."[6]_The Telegraph_ rated it three stars out of five.[7]
