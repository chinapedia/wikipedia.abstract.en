Ribbon_development,_Soothill_Lane,_Soothill_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1597649.jpg SOOTHILL is a small village in the town of Batley, West Yorkshire, England. Soothill is northeast from the town of Dewsbury and directly north of Hanging Heaton.[1] The name derives from the Old English "sot" and means a place where wood was burnt.[2]

Soothill was on the Great Northern Railway's Leeds to Batley branch line, although no station was provided.[3] The colliery at Soothill, adjacent to the railway, was the scene of a rail accident in February 1920 between a goods train and a passenger train. The accident was not fatal with only injuries being recorded.[4] The railway was closed in 1953[5] leaving a disused tunnel (Soothill Tunnel) north east of the settlement. This tunnel has been bricked up as it contains toxic gases.[6]
