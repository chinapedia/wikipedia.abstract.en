DIANE OBOMSAWIN (born 1959) is a Quebec-based author, illustrator and animated filmmaker, often known by her pseudonym, OBOM. Some of her notable works have explored the issue of lesbian first love, including a 2014 graphic novel, published in French as _J'aime les filles_ by L'Oie de Cravan and in English as _On Loving Women_ by Drawn & Quarterly.[1][2][3] _J'aime les filles_ was adapted as a 2016 National Film Board of Canada animated short, _I Like Girls (J'aime les filles)_, which received the Nelvana Grand Prize for Independent Short at the 40th Ottawa International Animation Festival.[4]


Comic books

Obomsawin's works has been described as complex contemporary comics that often have emotionally charged subjects depicted in clear and accessible manner.[5] An example is _Kaspar_ (2007), which is based on the story of Kaspar Hauser, a German boy raised without human contact. This story, which had previously inspired a film by Werner Herzog, was noted for its different portrait of Hauser as a kind of forsaken everyman, a metaphor for the romantic artist and outsider with the protagonist's depiction that focused on Hauser’s naive befuddlement with the world.[6]

_On Loving Women_, which was translated into English by Helge Dascher, tackles biography (and autobiography) through a series of vignettes that explore memories — crucial moments in the subject’s discovery of their sexual identity.[7] A review noted that this material features a “stripped-down approach” that “allows for a focus on the events.”[8]

The author also published the following comic books:

-   _À chier_, volume 2 numéro 2, _Iceberg_, autumn 1991.
-   _Greta et Poutine_, La Paryse, 1995.

Films

One of Obomsawin's notable films is _I Like Girls_ (2012). This film, which was produced by the National Film Board of Canada and based on _J’aime les filles_ and _On Loving Women_, follows four women who "reveal the nitty-gritty about their first loves, sharing funny and intimate tales of one-sided infatuation, mutual attraction, erotic moments, and fumbling attempts at sexual expression.”[9] The film was screened at the London Short Film Festival, the L.A. Film Festival,[10]  the New Hampshire Film Festival,  the St. John’s International Women’s Film Festival, the Yorkton Film Festivalthe Sundance Film Festival,  and other venues. The National Film Board of Canada, in a collaborative initiative with Canadian cartoonists, also adapted another of Obomsawin's graphic novels, _Kaspar_, which was released as an animated short.[11]
