_H_ () is a 1973 novel by French novelist Philippe Sollers. The novel was distinguished by its lack of punctuation, similar to Sollers' novels _Lois_ and _Paradis_. The book was published in English translation in 2015. Critic Roland Champagne describes _H_ as the "culmination" of the "breakdown in traditional writing for Sollers," a period that began with Sollers' novel _Lois_.


Overview

Sollers opens _H_ with a reference to Deleuze and Guattari's _Anti-Oedipus_. This reference, Roland Champagne argues, reflects a kinship between the _Anti-Oedipus_ authors' view of the self as a "desiring machine" and Sollers' desire to parody the "texts which create the self and thereby produce mirror-images of the self as it is reflected in the languages of culture."

_H_ is characterized by Sollers' preoccupation with Joyce's _Finnegans Wake_, a book that provides Sollers an example of "a true subversion of language and a profound historical vision." _H_ also reveals Sollers' interest in Ezra Pound's work, "the epic thrust through time and across space."

Sollers had written in _Tel Quel_ that he needed a "rhythm that reflects the tangle of social relationships." Roland Champagne, in his book on Sollers, writes "for this, he need[ed] a new form that will allow the spoken word to provide such a complex voicing, without the hindrances of formal written structure with its paragraphs, capitalization, and punctuation.

David Hayman wrote that _H_ was a departure for Sollers in that "[i]t is the first of Sollers' books to have frequent glimmers of humor ... and the first to come to its public, as did the _Wake_, without an explicit ‘key,’ a preliminary road map. The reader must chart his own _H_ space and time, carve out chunks of _H_ meaning, and supply punctuation and emphases.”

Hayman goes on to distinguish H from its antecedents such as _Finnegans Wake_: "While the _Wake_ has strong, if hidden, elements of plot and character, and a coherent and systematic development, there is no plot line in _H_ or _Paradis_. If there are personalities, there are no personae. Instead we have the overarching person (_sujet_) of the writer imposing itself discreetly through its rhythms upon a vision of history as process, or rather of historical flux.”


Reception

French literary critic Roland Barthes grouped _H_ with three other books by Sollers, _Drame_, _Paradis_, and _Lois_, and described these four as books that

  have to be referred to as novels because there is no other term to designate them. But they do not tell stories, describe a particular society or present identifiable characters. They are texts of which language itself is the subject, language which is wholly free from the duty to describe. The world which these texts presents is not one which the reader could either identify as her own or see clearly as different from it. In the past, in Barthes' view it was the author's duty to describe such a world which held language unjustifiably captive. One of the reasons he writes with such enthusiasm about Sollers is the way in which texts such as _Paradis_ and _Lois_ show what happens when this duty is removed.

Philip Barnard and Cheryl Lester also viewed _H_ as a turning point in Sollers' work, while also acknowledging its clear antecedents in the work of authors like Joyce and Faulkner:

  Without yet returning to plot and character, the novels _H_ (1973) and _Paradis_ (1981) transform the discrete segments and pronounced architecture of the earlier works into a continuous, unpunctuated flow of rhythmic prose. With these two novels, Sollers achieved a _tour de force_ of modernist poetics whose clear precedents are Joyce and Faulkner. The powerful narrative voice that emerges in these works foregrounds song, chant, psalmody, and real rhythms that point toward their sources in sacred texts and Dantean _epos_.

_Driftless Area Review_ lauded _H_, stating "[a]long with _Ulysses_ and Beckett’s _Three Novels_, _H_ can take its place in the permanent avant-garde."
