CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF TACHIRA (_Universidad Católica del Táchira_ – UCAT) in San Cristobal, capital of Tachira state in Venezuela, originated in 1962 as an extension of Andrés Bello Catholic University of the Society of Jesus.


History

The Catholic University of Tachira is a tertiary education institution born through the initiative of the Diocese of San Cristobal. It received the support of the Andrés Bello Catholic University, which in 1962 decided to open an outreach campus in Tachira. Actual activities began on 22 September 1962. It was the first institution of higher education in Tachira state. At that time the NGO "Asociación Civil", was responsible for the financial and administrative management of the university. In 1982 the outreach campus became independent from Andres Bello University by decree of the President of the Republic.[1][2]

In 2012 the University was canonically recognized by Pope Benedict XVI.[3]
