APPIUM[1][2][3][4] is an open source automation tool for running scripts and testing native applications, mobile-web applications and hybrid applications on Android or iOS using a webdriver.


History

Appium was originally developed by Dan Cuellar in 2011 under the name "iOSAuto", written in the C# programming language.[5][6][7] The program was open-sourced in August 2012 using the Apache 2 license.[8][9] In January 2013, Sauce Labs agreed to fund Appium's development and motivated its code to be rewritten using Node.js.[10][11]

Appium won the 2014 _Bossie award_ of InfoWorld about the best open source desktop and mobile software.[12] Appium was also selected as an _Open Source Rookie of the Year_ by Black Duck Software.[13][14]

In October 2016, Appium joined the JS Foundation.[15] Initially as a mentor program, it graduated in August 2017. [16]
