TROY CARTWRIGHT (born April 3, 1990) is an American country music singer-songwriter. The Dallas, Texas native currently resides in Nashville, Tennessee.


Life and career

Early life

Cartwright grew up in a conservative Texas home where his exposure to modern music was limited. For his twelfth birthday, his parents gave him an acoustic guitar which led him to being penning his own songs and, by the time he hit high school, he was playing regularly in bars and churches.[1] A summer program at New York University exposed Cartwright to the world outside of Dallas and inspired him to head even further from home to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. He worked his way through school with odd jobs in the music industry and wedding band gigs until he took the leap with his own music upon graduating in 2012.[2]

2013–2015

Cartwright moved back to Texas and recorded an EP, _Bull Run_, earning him recognition at the 2013 B. W. Stevenson Songwriting Competition.[3] The following year, he was the recipient of the 2014 Rising Star Texas Music Award.[4] A performance with John Fullbright led Cartwright to Oklahoma, where he collaborated with producer Wes Sharon on his 2015 self-titled full-length debut.[5]

2016–present

Radio play coupled with extensive touring caught the ear of fellow Texas songwriter Rob Baird, who offered to co-produce Cartwright's latest release, an EP titled 'Don't Fade', with Brian Douglas Phillips at Phillip's Austin-based Rattle Trap Studio, which released October 7, 2016.[6] The new project played a part in helping him land an agency deal with William Morris Endeavor (WME).[7] 'Don't Fade' also garnered Cartwright debuts on numerous Billboard music charts – No. 60 on the US Country Chart, No. 53 on the US Heatseekers Chart, and No. 8 on the Heatseekers South Central Chart.

Cartwright has shared the stage and toured with several notable acts including Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Green River Ordinance (band), Turnpike Troubadours, Randy Rogers Band, William Clark Green, Rob Baird, Stoney LaRue, Wade Bowen, Sean McConnell, Cody Jinks and more.
