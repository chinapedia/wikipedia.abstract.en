The SPEEDWAY GREAT BRITAIN (SGB) CHAMPIONSHIP is the second division of speedway league competition in the United Kingdom, governed by the Speedway Control Bureau (SCB), in conjunction with the British Speedway Promoters' Association (BSPA). It was introduced for 2017 following a restructuring of British speedway.[1]


League format

2017

The league contained ten teams who meet each other twice home and away. The top four teams at the end of the regular season go into playoffs to decide the champions. Ten of the teams from the previous Premier League will be in the Championship for 2017.[2] In 2017, there was a relegation and promotion race-off between the Championship and the new top tier, the SGB Premiership, with the bottom team from the Premiership going into a playoff with the Championship winners.[3][4]

2018

The Lakeside Hammers opted to join the Championship after having competed in the National League in 2017. [5] Each team meet each other home and away only once. The top four teams at the end of the regular season go into playoffs to decide the champions.

2019

11 teams make up the 2019 league structure. Birmingham Brummies[6], Eastbourne Eagles, Leicester Lions and Somerset Rebels join the Championship whilst Ipswich Witches and Peterborough Panthers move up a level to the SGB Premiership. Workington Comets initially declared to run then withdrew their intention.[7]
