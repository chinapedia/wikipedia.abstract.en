PAIGE DOHERTY was a 15-year-old student from Clydebank, Scotland who went missing on 19 March 2016. She had stayed at one of her friends' house the night before and the next day she went to the deli before she would have gone to her hairdressing job. The search for her began after she failed to arrive at her weekend hairdressing job in Kirkintilloch, away. Her body was found on the roadside near Glasgow's Great Western Road two days after she disappeared. Doherty had been stabbed in the head and neck and suffered more than 250 wounds.[1] The last sighting of her was on CCTV at a deli shop in Clydebank, owned by John Leathem, who later admitted to murdering Paige Doherty.[2] Doherty's mother, Pamela Munro, set up a charity in her daughter's name to teach children self defence, to prevent murder.

John Leathem claimed that Paige threatened to tell people that he had "touched her" inappropriately, if he refused to give her a job.[3] The police knew it was him due to the footage they found of him closing the Deli and running to the shop next to it and then returning with the deli still closed for about an hour, then the footage shows him putting a big heavy bin bag in his trunk. The bag was confirmed to be the body of Paige and when the owner of the shop he went was questioned they showed him purchasing gloves, bleach and a black bin bag. On 12 October 2016, 7 months after Doherty's murder, Leathem was sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow, where judge Lady Rae set a minimum time of 27 years in jail before becoming eligible to apply for parole.[4] However in February 2017, following an appeal by Leathem, the minimum term was reduced to 23 years.
