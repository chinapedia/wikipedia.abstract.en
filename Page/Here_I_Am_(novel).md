_HERE I AM_ is a 2016 novel by Jonathan Safran Foer. It depicts a series of events that impact members of a Jewish family living in Washington, D.C., which some reviewers suggest includes autobiographical elements of Foer’s life. _Here I Am_ is the first new novel published by Foer in over ten years, and it is the first in Foer's three-book installment with Farrar, Straus and Giroux.


Plot

Christian Lorentzen has described the plot as a blend of several different events, including "[a] divorce, a suicide, a bar mitzvah, an earthquake, an all-out Middle Eastern war, and the putting to sleep of a family dog".[1] These plot elements are tied together through a central narrative about the ways in which these events impact the lives of a Jewish family living in Washington, D.C.[2][3] Daniel Menaker notes that the "collage" of narratives overlap with one another at times, though they also sometimes conflict with each other.[4] Jennifer Maloney has suggested that the novel contains several autobiographical elements.[5] Constance Grady also cited similarities between Jacob Bloch, a character in the novel, and events in Foer's own life.[6] When asked to describe the novel, author Jonathan Safran Foer said, "I would say it’s not my life but it’s me."[7]


Background

_Here I Am_ is Foer's third novel, following _Everything Is Illuminated_ (2002) and _Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close_ (2005).[8][9] It is the first in Foer's three-book installment with publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux.[10] The phrase "here I am" is derived from the biblical account of the words that were spoken by Abraham when he was asked to sacrifice his son, Isaac.[11][12] Foer stated that he wrote two-thirds of _Here I Am_ in the final year of his work on the novel.[13] According to _Time_, Foer's work on the novel "went into high gear" after Foer decided to stop working on a planned television show for HBO called _All Talk_; the planned television show also would have focused on the life of a Jewish family in Washington, D.C.[14] Foer explained that when he worked on the novel at his home, he would write on a laptop computer placed on his lap, and that he would move between rooms of his house whenever he began to experience "the inability to value [his] thoughts", an experience that Foer described as "Jonathan block".[15]
