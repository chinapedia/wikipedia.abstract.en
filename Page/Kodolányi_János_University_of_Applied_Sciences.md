The university was founded in 1992. The municipality of Székesfehérvár donated a building for the campus, because until then there was no university in the city. It was named after Hungarian writer János Kodolányi, because of his connections to the city. In 1994 the university started its own local radio station. In 1997 opened a faculty in Siófok, and in the following year campus in Budapest. The Orosháza campus was opened in 2004.

The university offers Bachelor's, Master's and Doctorate programmes in Hungarian, English and German.
