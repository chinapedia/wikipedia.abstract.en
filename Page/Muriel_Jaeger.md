MURIEL JAEGER (May 23, 1892 â€“ November 21, 1969) was a British author who wrote early novels of science fiction as well as plays and non-fiction.


Biography

Jaeger attended Somerville College, Oxford from 1912 to 1916 and belonged to a society of women writers that included Winifred Holtby and her close friend Dorothy L. Sayers. Her nickname in college was James, or Jim, or even Jimmy: her friend Dorothy L. Sayers would address her in all three ways.[1] After graduation,[2] she worked for _Time and Tide_ and _Vogue_ before setting out on an independent writing career.

Her novels deal with such topics as extrasensory perception, utopian speculation, and genetic engineering and are considered important for their place in the history of science fiction. At the time, her work was not well-received by critics, and she abandoned her career.[3][4]
