WINTER ISLAND (also known as RUCKELS ISLAND)[1] is a island in Suisun Bay, in the western Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.[2][3] It is north of Pittsburg,[4][5] separated from Browns Island to the west by a slough. It was private property,[6] and contained one house.[7] It is used as a duck hunting area, a wetland, and a dredging disposal area.[8] It was recently purchased by the California Department of Water Resources in order to restore the island as a tidal marsh.

In 2009, Brusco Tug and Barge, a tugboat company, pled guilty to illegal dredge dumping near the island between 2003 and 2007.[9] In 2014, a large wildfire broke out on the island.[10]
