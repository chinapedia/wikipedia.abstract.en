JOHN HENRY LOFT (20 February 1769 – 13 July 1849) was a British soldier and politician.


Early life

Loft was born on 20 February 1769, in Grainthorpe, Lincolnshire.[1]


Military career

In 1769 he enlisted in the 15th Regiment of Foot and had been promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel within four years, of an unattached Corps of 4,000 men which he had raised himself.[2]


Political career

Loft was the member of Parliament for Great Grimsby [3] and was much involved with recruiting during the Napoleonic Wars. He was a controversial but influential figure in the development of Grimsby as a port, being one of the original shareholders named in the act of parliament which created the Grimsby Haven Company in 1796.[4]


The antiquarian

Between around 1826 and 1844, Loft obsessively recorded details of churches, gravestones and memorials around Lincolnshire, many of which have survived and become a useful resource for historians.[5]


Death and legacy

Loft died on 13 July 1849, in a house on Loft Street, Grimsby, which had been named after him.[6]
