_DAMNED_ is a British television sitcom shown on Channel 4. It is set in the office of the children's services department of fictional Elm Heath Council.[1]


Production

In March 2014, Sky Arts announced that it was reprising its _Playhouse Presents_ series of self-contained television plays. Jo Brand and Morwenna Banks penned a script for what was hoped to be a pilot episode. Sky Arts aired the episode but never commissioned it to series; so Brand, Banks, and comedic writer Will Smith re-developed it for Channel 4, who announced its commission in May 2016.[2]


Broadcast

The first series premiered on Channel 4 on 27 September 2016, and concluded on 1 November 2016. In February 2017, Channel 4 commissioned a second six-episode series.[3] Series 2 began broadcasting on 14 February 2018.[4] Episode 5 of the second series was not aired as planned on 14 March 2018 to make space for a tribute to Professor Steven Hawking, who had died a day earlier. The episode was then aired a week later on 21 March 2018 as a double feature alongside the sixth and final episode of the second series.
