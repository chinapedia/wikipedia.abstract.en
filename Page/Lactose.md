LACTOSE is a disaccharide. It is a sugar composed of galactose and glucose subunits and has the molecular formula C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁. Lactose makes up around 2–8% of milk (by weight). The name comes from __ (gen. __), the Latin word for milk, plus the suffix _-ose_ used to name sugars. The compound is a white, water-soluble, non-hygroscopic solid with a mildly sweet taste. It is used in the food industry.[1]


Structure and reactions

Lactose is a disaccharide derived from the condensation of galactose and glucose, which form a β-1→4 glycosidic linkage. Its systematic name is β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucose. The glucose can be in either the α-pyranose form or the β-pyranose form, whereas the galactose can only have the β-pyranose form: hence α-lactose and β-lactose refer to the anomeric form of the glucopyranose ring alone.

Lactose is hydrolysed to glucose and galactose, isomerised in alkaline solution to lactulose, and catalytically hydrogenated to the corresponding polyhydric alcohol, lactitol.[2] Lactulose is a commercial product, used for treatment of constipation.


Occurrence and isolation

Lactose comprises about 2–8% of milk by weight. Several million tons are produced annually as a by-product of the dairy industry.

Whey or milk plasma is the liquid remaining after milk is curdled and strained, for example in the production of cheese. Whey is made up of 6.5% solids, of which 4.8% is lactose, which is purified by crystallisation.[3] Industrially, lactose is produced from whey permeate – that is whey filtrated for all major proteins. The protein fraction is used in infant nutrition and sports nutrition while the permeate can be evaporated to 60–65% solids and crystallized while cooling.[4] Lactose can also be isolated by dilution of whey with ethanol.[5]

Dairy products such as yogurt, cream and fresh cheeses have lactose contents similar to that of milk. Ripened cheeses contain little to no lactose, as bacteria convert most of it into lactic acid during the ripening process.


Metabolism

Infant mammals nurse on their mothers to drink milk, which is rich in lactose. The intestinal villi secrete the enzyme lactase (β-D-galactosidase) to digest it. This enzyme cleaves the lactose molecule into its two subunits, the simple sugars glucose and galactose, which can be absorbed. Since lactose occurs mostly in milk, in most mammals, the production of lactase gradually decreases with maturity due to a lack of continuing consumption.

Many people with ancestry in Europe, West Asia, South Asia, the Sahel belt in West Africa, East Africa and a few other parts of Central Africa maintain lactase production into adulthood. In many of these areas, milk from mammals such as cattle, goats, and sheep is used as a large source of food. Hence, it was in these regions that genes for lifelong lactase production first evolved. The genes of adult lactose tolerance have evolved independently in various ethnic groups.[6] By descent, more than 70% of western Europeans can drink milk as adults, compared with less than 30% of people from areas of Africa, eastern and south-eastern Asia and Oceania.[7] In people who are lactose intolerant, lactose is not broken down and provides food for gas-producing gut flora, which can lead to diarrhea, bloating, flatulence, and other gastrointestinal symptoms.


Applications

Its mild flavor and easy handling properties has led to its use as a carrier and stabiliser of aromas and pharmaceutical products.[8] Lactose is not added directly to many foods, because its solubility is less than that of other sugars commonly used in food. Infant formula is a notable exception, where the addition of lactose is necessary to match the composition of human milk.

Lactose is not fermented by most yeast during brewing, which may be used to advantage.[9] For example, lactose may be used to sweeten stout beer; the resulting beer is usually called a milk stout or a cream stout.

Yeast belonging to the genus _Kluyveromyces_ have a unique industrial application as they are capable of fermenting lactose for ethanol production. Surplus lactose from the whey by-product of dairy operations is a potential source of alternative energy.[10]

Another significant lactose use is in the pharmaceutical industry. Lactose is added to tablet and capsule drug products as an ingredient because of its physical and functional properties, _i.e._, compressibility and cost effective use. For similar reasons it can be used to cut (dilute) illicit drugs.


History

The first crude isolation of lactose, by Italian physician Fabrizio Bartoletti (1576–1630), was published in 1633.[11] In 1700, the Venetian pharmacist Lodovico Testi (1640–1707) published a booklet of testimonials to the power of milk sugar (_saccharum lactis_) to relieve, among other ailments, the symptoms of arthritis.[12] In 1715, Testi's procedure for making milk sugar was published by Antonio Vallisneri.[13] Lactose was identified as a sugar in 1780 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele.See:

-   Carl Wilhelm Scheele (1780) "Om Mjölk och dess syra" (About milk and its acid), _Kongliga Vetenskaps Academiens Nya Handlingar_ (New Proceedings of the Royal Academy of Science), 1 : 116–124. From page 116: _"Det år bekant, at Ko-mjölk innehåller Smör, Ost, Mjölk-såcker, … "_ (It is known, that cow's milk contains butter, cheese, milk-sugar, … )
-   Carl Wilhelm Scheele (1780) "Om Mjölk-Såcker-Syra" (On milk-sugar acid), _Kongliga Vetenskaps Academiens Nya Handlingar_ (New Proceedings of the Royal Academy of Science), 1 : 269–275. From pages 269–270: _"Mjölk-Såcker år et sal essentiale, som uti Mjölken finnes uplöst, och som, för dess sötaktiga smak skull, fått namn af såcker."_ (Milk sugar is an essential salt, which is found dissolved in milk, and which, on account of its sweet taste, has the name of "sugar".)[14]

In 1812, Heinrich Vogel (1778–1867) recognized that glucose was a product of hydrolyzing lactose.See:

-   Vogel (1812) "Sur le sucre liquide d'amidon, et sur la transmutation des matières douces en sucre fermentescible" (On the liquid sugar of starch, and on the transformation of sweet materials into fermentable sugars), _Annales de chemie et de physique_, series 1, 82 : 148–164; see especially pages 156–158.
-   H. A. Vogel (1812) "Ueber die Verwandlung der Stärke und andrer Körper in Zucker" (On the conversion of starches and other substances into sugar), _Annalen der Physik_, new series, 42 : 123–134; see especially pages 129–131. In 1856, Louis Pasteur crystallized the other component of lactose, galactose.[15] By 1894, Emil Fischer had established the configurations of the component sugars.Fischer determined the configuration of glucose in:
-   Emil Fischer (1891) "Ueber die Configuration des Traubenzuckers und seiner Isomeren" (On the configuration of grape sugar and its isomers), _Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft_, 24 : 1836–1845.
-   Emil Fischer (1891) "Ueber die Configuration des Traubenzuckers und seiner Isomeren. II" (On the configuration of grape sugar and its isomers), _Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft_, 24 : 2683–2687.

Fischer established the configuration of galactose in:

-   Emil Fischer and Robert S. Morrell (1894) "Ueber die Configuration der Rhamnose und Galactose" (On the configuration of rhamnose and galactose), _Berichte der Deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft zu Berlin_, 27 : 382–394. The configuration of galactose appears on page 385.

Lactose was named by the French chemist Jean Baptiste André Dumas (1800–1884) in 1843.[16] In 1856, Louis Pasteur named galactose "lactose".[17] In 1860, Marcellin Berthelot renamed it "galactose", and transferred the name "lactose" to what is now called lactose.[18] It has a formula of C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ and the hydrate formula C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁·H₂O, making it an isomer of sucrose.
