LAWS REGARDING SAME-SEX PARTNERSHIPS ON THE ISLAND OF CYPRUS SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IN AKROTIRI AND DHEKELIA, a British Overseas Territory, has been legal since 3 June 2014. An ordinance to legalise such marriages was approved by the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty in Council on 28 April 2014 and came into effect on 3 June. However, for a same-sex couple to marry in the territory, at least one partner has to serve in the British Armed Forces and their marriage application has to be approved by the base commander.[1] The first same-sex couple to marry in the territory was Sergeant Alastair Smith and Aaron Weston, who married on the British military base on Dhekelia on 10 September 2016.[2][3]

Civil partnerships have also been legal for same-sex couples, if at least one partner is serving in the British Armed Forces, since 7 December 2005.[4]

Civilian same-sex couples living in the territory are unable to marry, as they are governed under the laws of Cyprus which does not recognise same-sex marriage.[5] In 1960, when the Republic of Cyprus became independent, the United Kingdom declared that the laws applicable to the civilian population would be as far as possible the same as the laws of Cyprus.[6] In December 2015, civil unions were legalised in Cyprus for both different-sex and same-sex couples.[7]
