CONCRETE HERITAGE MUSEUM (formerly CAMP SEVEN LOGGING MUSEUM) is a local heritage museum in Concrete, Washington. The museum focuses on the industrial history of the region and has collections dedicated to Superior Portland Cement Company, Lower Baker Dam, and the region's rich history of logging.[1][2] The museum maintains an archive of The Concrete Herald, a historical local newspaper established in 1901.[3] The museum has regular summer weekend hours,[4] but open by appointment only all other times.[5]


History

The museum was founded in early 1980s by a retired Concrete judge, Herb Larsen.[6] Larsen initially named the museum 'Camp Seven Logging Museum', as it was primarily dedicated to the history of logging camps of the area. Later, the museum also incorporated historical collections related to cement industry of Concrete and regional railroad and hydroelectric power projects.[7] In September 2009, the museum opened an exhibit displaying the contents of the time capsule that was interred on August 11, 1932 by now defunct Superior Portland Cement Company.[8]
