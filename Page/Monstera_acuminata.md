_MONSTERA ACUMINATA_, or SHINGLE PLANT, is a species of flowering plant from Araceae family which is widespread from Mexico to Central America.[1] It is abundant in central Petén and extends north to San Luis Potosí, making it the northernmost of the species of _Monstera._[2]


Description

_Monstera acuminata_ germinates in the ground and grows horizontally as a low prostrate herb.[3] The juvenile plant is much smaller and heart-shaped with thick, roundish, waxy leaves which grow in two ranks and overlap each other with the stem elliptic in cross section and internodes 1–5 cm long and asymmetric leaves.[4][5]

When it encounters a tree trunk, it uses its ageotropic anchoring roots to grow vertically.[6] The adult plant appears similar to that of _Monstera deliciosa_ and these leaves are developed when the plant reaches 15 feet and is an example of an example of dimorphism. The leaves are smooth or papillose stem 2-3.5 cm thick with internodes 6–11 cm long.[7][8] After it grows upwards, the base of the stem of the hemiepiphyte dies and rots, thereby losing its connection to the soil.[9]
