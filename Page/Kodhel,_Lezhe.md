In general

On August 16 is the village's holiday of Shen Rroku, celebrated vigorously with lots of visits, church mass, prayers and numerous activities.

Name etymology

The name 'Kodhel' comes from the name 'kudher',anvil in English . This is the main version, although, there are more versions of the name's origin. Many years ago, the village was much larger than it is today and it was located at the upper side of the hill. In the village center, there is a place called 'Farka' which means 'kudher'. This fact proves that Kodheli long ago was a village with a large population and the existence of a blacksmith shop for forging tools, was necessary. According to some legends, the old village comprised around 300-400 houses, which may have a population of about 2000–3000 people, having in mind that there were large families with more than 60–70 members. About 300 years ago, a great disease killed almost the entire population; the survivors moved to the current location of the village.[2]
