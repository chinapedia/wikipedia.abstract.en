_SONGS FOR THE LIVING_ is the fourth album by the Christian metal band Embodyment. The album was the biggest departure from the band's original Death metal/deathcore sound, the album being more of an Alternative metal.


Critical reception

Andy Kelly of Jesus Freak Hideout wrote "Overall, Songs for the Living is a very solid release that takes Embodyment in incredible new directions, including great vocals and melodies that will be stuck in your head for weeks to come.",[1] while Kevin Gordon of AllMusic wrote "...Embodyment's _Songs for The Living_ makes a convincing pitch for mainstream success. Guitarist Andrew Godwin's six-string work dominates the material, laying the groundwork for Sean Corbray's soaring vocals. The band's Christian leanings are only hinted at in these songs; the obtuse lyrics instead exploring the many facets of romance and human relationships. "Reaching Out" sounds a little like R.E.M., even as it reasserts a grab at faith, while "She's There" revisits the memory of a lost love with Wall-of-Sound instrumentation and powerful vocals. A red-hot riff and recurring rhythm sends "Segue Station" into the stratosphere, glimpses of lyrics passing by underneath a shimmering melody and sonic overkill. Altogether radio-friendly and ready for the major leagues, Embodyment discarded a large part of its past in favor of a brighter future with the slickly-produced, chart-rock of _Songs for The Living_. Although the band has done little to distinguish itself from, say, Creed and its many doppelgangers, ten years down the road finds Embodyment still reaching for the stars, adding various disparate elements to their sound, and seeing what works."[2]
