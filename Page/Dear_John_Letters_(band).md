DEAR JOHN LETTERS are a Seattle, Washington-based rock band made up of Robb Benson, Richard Davidson, Cassady Laton, and Johnny Sangster.


Formation and history

Robb Benson was born in Mount Vernon, Washington, and lived most of his early life in the area.[1]

Benson's first band was the Seattle-based Nevada Bachelors, formed in 1997, who received national interest. When they disbanded, he recorded the _Songs about Songs_ EP.[2]

Benson then formed Dear John Letters, who released three albums. Benson and Johnny Sangster (who had produced the first Nevada Bachelors album and _Songs About Songs_) also collaborated on _Sangster Meets Benson/Benson Meets Sangster_, an album of experimental pop.[3]

When Dear John Letters went on hiatus, Robb Benson continued to record solo albums and launched other projects. Dear John Letters is not active, but did perform in 2009 for Robb's 40th birthday.[4]


Releases

The first Dear John Letters album _Rewriting the Wrongs_ was released in 2001 on the Roam Records label, and was produced by Johnny Sangster. Its music style was described as being influenced by Paul McCartney and Simon & Garfunkel.[5]

A second album _Unbroken_ was released in 2002 also by Roam Records and again produced by Johnny Sangster. The sound was described as more refined than their first recording.[6]

In 2003, the band moved to Foodchain records for their third album _Stories of Our Lives_. The album was well-received, and reached #34 on the CMJ charts.[7][8]
