History

Following the election of Suharto as a president of Indonesia in 1967, a new policy was introduced to boost economic growth in Indonesia by promoting foreign investment into its capital Jakarta. Ali Sadikin, governor of Jakarta at that time, prepared the infrastructure of Jakarta for the new policy with the construction of the Jakarta Convention Center (1974) and several hotel projects. The 1970s saw hotel building boom in Jakarta with the opening of nine major hotels, among these was Hotel Ambassador.

Construction of the hotel started in 1971. The hotel was opened in June 1974 as Hotel Ambassador.[1] The hotel was originally owned by the prominent journalists and owner of newspapers _Merdeka_ and _Indonesian Observer_ B.M. Diah and Herawati Diah. The hotel was built on land where the home of Herawati Diah's parents once stood. In the beginning, the hotel consists of 216 rooms.[2]

On 1 January 1976, Hotel Ambassador became the Hyatt Aryaduta Hotel Jakarta following a contract-signing between PT Aryaduta Hotel Tbk and Hyatt International. The contract allowed Hyatt to manage the hotel building for 10 years. The contract has been renewed ever since.[3]

In 1985, a new wing was constructed to the west of the original main wing. This new wing was known as The Ambassador and consists of 115 hotel units, adding the total units into 325 hotel units. The new wings was officially opened on December 7, 1986. The opening ceremony was attended by Siti Hartinah, the wife of President Suharto.[4]
