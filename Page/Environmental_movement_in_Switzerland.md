Environmental policy

Legislation

In 1874, an article to protect forests was introduced in the Swiss Federal Constitution.[7] In 1962, a constitutional article was introduced for the protection of nature.[8]

In 1967, the Federal Act on the Protection of Nature and Cultural Heritage introduced notably the right of appeal of environmental organisations ("entitlement to appeal", article 12) which gives all Swiss organisations concerned with nature protection the right to raise general objections or to file appeals against some projects.[9][10] The right of environmental organisations to appeal was later also included in the Federal Act on the Protection of the Environment (1985, article 55[11]) and the Federal Act on Non-Human Gene Technology (2004, article 28[12]).[13]

In 1971, a constitutional article for the protection of the environment was approved by 92.7 percent of voters (article 24, currently article 74 of the constitution of 1999) and the Federal Office for the Environment, Forests and Landscape (renamed Federal Office for the Environment in 2006) was founded (as part of the Department of Transport, Communications and Energy).[14]

The Federal Inventory of Landscapes and Natural Monuments was introduced in 1977.

On 21 May 2017, 58 percent of Swiss voters accepted the new Energy Act establishing the energy strategy 2050 (energy transition) and forbidding the construction of new nuclear power plants.[15]

Popular initiatives

Several federal popular initiative were launched to increase environmental protection. Several of them were accepted:[16]

-   Federal popular initiative "for the protection of marsh" ("Rothenthurm initiative"), accepted by 57.8 percent of voters on 6 December 1987. For the protection of wetlands.[17]
-   Federal popular initiative "stop the construction of nuclear power plants (moratorium)", accepted by 54.5 percent of voters on 23 September 1990. For a ten-year moratorium on the construction of new nuclear plants.[18]
-   Federal popular initiative "for the protection of alpine areas against transit traffic" ("Alps initiative"), accepted by 51.9 percent of voters on 20 February 1994. To protect the Alpine environment from the negative impact of traffic (see also Gotthard Base Tunnel).[19]
-   Federal popular initiative "for food produced without genetic engineering", accepted by 55.7 percent of voters on 27 November 2005. For a moratorium on the culture of genetically modified organisms.[20]
-   Federal popular initiative "to end the invasive construction of second homes" ("Franz Weber initiative"), accepted by 50.6 percent of voters on 12 March 2012. To reduce urban sprawl by limiting the number of second homes (with a quota of twenty percent per commune).[21]
