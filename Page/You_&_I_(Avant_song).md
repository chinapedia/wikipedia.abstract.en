Critical response

The song was met with a positive response from critics and journalists.

In a review from _DJBooth_ stated "If you like love, then you’ll love Avant‘s latest feature. On album lead single You & I the MO-B Entertainment/EMI singer reaches out to a special woman in his life, assuring her that not only that he loves her, but that he loves loving her and, presumably, loves loving loving her. And Keke Wyatt, his partner on this heartwarming duet? As she makes clear over a currently unknown producer’s slow-jam boardwork, she loves him, and loves loving him, right back."[2]

_YouKnowIGotSoul_ stated in a review of the album Face the Music, "You and I teams Avant with his longtime cohort KeKe Wyatt and, as usual, they’re magic together. Avant and KeKe continue to smolder every time they connect."[3] Elle Breezy from Singersroom stated in a review "Might as well coin them the modern day Marvin Gaye and Tammy Terrell, because the chemistry that Avant and Keke Wyatt share behind the mic is crazy! The longtime-duet partners are back with another gem in You & I."[4]


Music video

The music video was released to Avant's VEVO channel on January 4, 2013.[5] Directed by Kai Crawford, was intended to highlight the chemistry and performance of both Avant and KeKe as they reunite in the first time to perform in six years.[6]

Avant described the song and video in a behind the scenes video of the song as "What were really trying to do is bring back that old true R&B back. You know back in the days you would see black and white just amazing performance. What were gonna do is have the black and white look but with some colour."[7]
