The LOOSEMORE–HANBY INDEX measures disproportionality of electoral systems. It computes the absolute difference between votes cast and seats obtained using the formula:

$$LH=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n|\omega_i-\sigma_i|}{2}$$

The index is named after John Loosemore and Victor J. Hanby, who first published the formula in 1971 in a paper entitled "The Theoretical Limits of Maximum Distortion: Some Analytic Expressions for Electoral Systems". Along with Douglas W. Rae's, the formula is one of the two most cited disproportionality indices. Whereas the Rae index measures the average deviation, the Loosemore–Hanby index measures the total deviation. Michael Gallagher used least squares to develop the Gallagher index, which takes a middle ground between the Rae and Loosemore–Hanby indices.
