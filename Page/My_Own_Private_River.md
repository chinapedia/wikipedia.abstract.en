Development and release

In 2007, at a conference meeting in New York City for the 2008 film _Milk_, Franco and Van Sant responded to questions about Franco's favourite movie, which turned out to be _My Own Private Idaho._ Van Sant admired Franco's appreciation for the film, while Van Sant enticed Franco to give him a tour of the film's locations in Portland, Oregon. Franco expressed his wish to Van Sant to access the outtake footage for the original film.[4]

Van Sant showed Franco the collection of unseen film. Franco was interested to digitize and assemble the footage as a re-contextualized film. About the unseen footage, Franco stated, _“_I edited the film as I imagined Gus might have if he made _My Own Private Idaho_ today,_”_

In an interview in February, 2012, Franco said he was not sure about releasing the film on DVD, yet sought approval by New Line Cinema who was against the idea, Franco stated that they didn’t want us to compete with the final film.[5]
