Description

Woolsbarrow is a slight univallate hillfort on a flat-topped knoll on the plateau of Bloxworth Heath, which separates the rivers Sherford to the east and Piddle to the west. The hillfort is marked by a single rampart about below the top of the gravel knoll and covers an area of around .[4] The eastern part of the hillfort has been damaged by sand and gravel extraction, but much of it survives well and has the potential for further archaeological evidence to be uncovered.[5]

It is one of only about 150 slight univallate hillforts nationally and is of national importance.[6]
