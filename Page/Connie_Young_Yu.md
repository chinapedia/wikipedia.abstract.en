CONNIE YOUNG YU (born 1941) is a Chinese American writer, historian, and lecturer. She is "the author of countless articles and three books: (_Profiles in Excellence: Peninsula Chinese Americans_; _Chinatown San Jose, U.S.A._; and _The People's BiCentennial Quilt: A Patchwork History_)... through articles, essays, lectures, and community activities, she has devoted her energies for more than a quarter of a century in rediscovering a history of Chinese and Asian America that has, for the most part, been forgotten, overlooked, and even hidden." (Profile: "Connie Young Yu, 1941-, writer, _Notable Asian Americans_, edited by Helen Zia and Susan B. Gall, Detroit: Gale Research, 1995).

Shelley Fisher Fishkin, in "Writing America," cites Connie Young Yu's involvement in saving the detention barracks of Angel Island Immigration Station that had Chinese poems carved on the walls: "Most of these poems were forgotten until they were rediscovered by a California State Park Ranger named Alexander Weiss in 1970. Connie Young Yu, a community historian and activist who would play a central role in getting the Angel Island Immigration Station designated a National Historic Landmark, said, 'In 1970 all that remained on the site were the deteriorating barracks.' The California State Parks administration had plans to demolish the entire site. Yu describes the arduous process by which that destruction was averted...."
