JANNEKE ELLEN RAAIJMAKERS (born 28 June 1973, in Hilversum)[1] is a Dutch historian of the Middle Ages who specializes in the formation of monastic communities and the role of religious objects in the cult of the saints, with a particular focus on Fulda and the Fulda monastery, founded by Saint Boniface.

Raaijmakers received her Ph.D. from the University of Amsterdam in 2003; her dissertation, _Sacred Time, Sacred Space. History and Identity at the monastery of Fulda (744–856)_, investigates the Fulda monastery[2] including the relics it acquired and their function,[3] and the monastery's position in the "sacred landscape" of the Carolingians.[4] Between 2005 and 2010 she did postdoctoral research on Saint Boniface and the role his life and work played in the building and transformation of various monastic communities. She has published on various aspects of monastic and religious life, including necrologies.[5] Her _The Making of the Monastic Community of Fulda, c. 744 – c. 900_ was published by Cambridge University Press in 2012 and offered a "multidimensional portrait of [this] influential monastery".[6][7]

Since then, she has focused on the function of religious objects in the medieval West, particularly relics and their veneration. Raaijmakers is a former editor of the Dutch history journal _Madoc_.[8]
