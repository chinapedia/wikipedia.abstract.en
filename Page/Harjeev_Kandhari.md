In partnership with Alzura.com[28] in Germany it has launched a scheme that has many people referring to ZTYRE as the Netflix of tyres.[29] This scheme allows consumers to pay a flat monthly rate and covering all tyre related costs, and allowing customers to fit or upgrade tyres when needed. The service is currently available through Alzura X and its 600 partner stores nationwide.[30]
