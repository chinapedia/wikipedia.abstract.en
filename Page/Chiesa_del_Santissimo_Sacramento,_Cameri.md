The church of the SANTISSIMO SACRAMENTO, or _S.S. Sacramento_ (Holy Sacrament), is a Roman Catholic church located on Piazza Dante Alighieri, adjacent to the parish church of San Michele in Cameri, province of Novara, Piedmont, Italy.


History

The church was originally an oratory for a flagellant confraternity, known as the _Rossi_ or red for the processional gowns worn by the group. The confraternity then became the _Confraternita del SS. Sacramento_. The 16th-century fa√ßade was restored in 2002, the roofline has statues of the Saints Bartholemew, Peter, and Paul. The interior at present is undecorated. The church was dedicated to the Holy Trinity and San Bartolomeo.[1]
