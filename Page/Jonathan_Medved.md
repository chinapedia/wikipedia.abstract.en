Career

Medved is the founder and CEO of OurCrowd, an equity crowdfunding platform that connects its “crowd” of accredited investors to funding startup investments. OurCrowd was started in 2013 and has its global headquarters in Jerusalem with additional offices in Tel Aviv, San Diego, New York, Toronto, London, Hong Kong, Singapore and Sydney.[3] As of November 2018, OurCrowd has raised $800M in 160 startup companies and venture funds in its portfolio.[4]

Saul Singer and Dan Senor, in their best-selling book, Start-up Nation, describe Medved as “one of Israel’s legendary business ambassadors….[he] has taken on a role that – in any other country – would typically belong to the local Chamber of Commerce, Minister of Trade, or Foreign Secretary.”[7]
