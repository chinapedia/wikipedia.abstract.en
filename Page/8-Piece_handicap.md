The 8-PIECE (八枚落ち _hachimai-ochi_) handicap in shogi has both of White's major pieces, the rook and the bishop, removed as well as their lances, knights, and silvers. White only has the line of pawns and two gold plus their king.

Black has the usual setup of twenty pieces.

The handicap is not a part of the current official handicap system of the Japan Shogi Association, but it is still used by novice players and has received joseki treatment in shogi texts.


Openings

Unlike the larger 10-Piece and 9-Piece handicaps, the 8-Piece is more balanced with White having the minimum number of pieces needed to defend their line of pawns from Black's early bishop attacks.

The first couple of moves by White are crucial. The fastest attack that Black can initiate is via their bishop. Once their bishop's diagonal is open, the bishop is directly attacking White's pawn on 33. Therefore, White must address this threat in their first two moves. Additionally, once the bishop is mobile, Black may also threaten White's right edge pawn on 93. White must accordingly address this in their first two moves as well. If these two points are not defended properly, then Black will succeed in breaching White's camp very early in the game.

1...G-32. White prepares for the bishop attack on 33 by defending the pawns on 23, 33, and 43.

Alternately, White's king may move to 42 defending 33 if White intends to position the king on the left side of their board as suggested by Hosking.

2. P-76. Black opens their bishop's diagonal.

2...G-72. White moves their gold (金) to defend the pawns on files 6–8. Additionally, Black is also threatening to move their bishop to 66 attacking White's edge. If White does not move their gold to 72 by their second move, then White will not be fast enough to actually defend 93. (See example in next subsection.)

The first two moves by White may also be transposed to the order 1...G-72, 2. P-76 G-32 (or 1...G-72, 2. P-76 K-42). What is essential is that the 32 and 82 squares are defended before Black's second move (or the third move of the game).

Failing to defend ninth file

To the right is an example of White failing to defend the eighth file pawn by their second move and the ninth file pawn by their third move. Since White's gold was not moved, Black breaks through White's camp.

3.☗B-66 5.☗P-56

This is the line suggested by Kageyama & Kimura (1955).

3. B-66 G-82. As in the 9-Piece handicap, Black attacks White's ninth file pawn forcing White to defend with the gold.

4. P-56. Black pushes their central pawn in order to allow the bishop to move to the 57 square. (Cf. 9-Piece § ☗4.P-56.)

Climbing Silver

After the initial three moves, the general strategy for Black that professional player Kazuharu Shoshi recommends is to activate both the bishop and the rook and start a Climbing Silver attack (下手棒銀戦法 _shitate bōgin senpō_).

He offers the two variations shown below. The first variation positions White's king on the right side while the second positions the king on the left.

3. P-26. In order to build a Climbing Silver structure, Black must create an open space in their line of pawns so that their right silver can climb out. The general idea of Climbing Silver to create an attack with their (second file) rook pawn, right silver, and rook with the bishop also thrown in for good measure. The initial pawn push on the second file accomplishes this as well as signaling to White what Black is planning.

☖K-52

Shoshi (2000).

3. P-26 K-52, 4. P-25.

8. S-35. The Climbing Silver formation is complete with Black's silver on rank 5.

☖K-42

Shoshi (2000).

Edge attack

Another strategy for Black is an edge attack.

Rook-34 variation

Yet another possibility is recommended by Fairbairn (1981) for Static Rook attack in which Black moves their rook sideways to the third file.
