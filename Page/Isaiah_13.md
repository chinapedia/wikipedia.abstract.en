ISAIAH 13 is the thirteenth chapter of the Book of Isaiah in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible.

Text

The original text was written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 22 verses.

-   The American Old Testament scholar Brevard Childs links this chapter with the first part of chapter 14 as one section, composed of two units: 13:2-22 and 14:4b-21, "linked editorially by an initial superscription (13:1) and two redactional units 14:1-4a and 22-23.

Parashot

The _parashah_ sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.[8] Isaiah 13 is a part of the _Prophecies about the Nations (Isaiah 13–23)_. {P}: open _parashah_; {S}: closed _parashah_.

    {S} 13:1-5 {S} 13:6-22 [14:1-2 {S}]


Verse 1

    _The burden against Babylon which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw._ (NKJV)[9]

-   "Burden" (Hebrew: מַשָּׂ֖א ): the keyword in the superscriptions for a total of nine similar oracles; the others being: Isaiah 15:1; Isaiah 17:1; Isaiah 19:1; Isaiah 21:1; Isaiah 21:11; Isaiah 21:13; Isaiah 22:1; Isaiah 23:1.


Verse 2

    _Lift up a banner on the high mountain_ (NKJV)[10]

The ASV refers to "the bare mountain", i.e. "i.e. one denuded of trees, so that the signal might be clearly distinguished".[11]


Verse 17

    ''"Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them,

        ''Who will not regard silver;

    _And as for gold, they will not delight in it."_ (NKJV) [12]

-   Cross reference: ; ; ;

This verse makes clear that Babylon was to fall at the hand of the Medes, probably under the leadership of Cyrus the Great.[13] The Medes are specified _by name_ as the instrument of God's wrath, pointing to a historical setting in the sixth century, but according to Childs, significantly "portrayed as a still future event, and ... not to be interpreted as a late postexilic retrojection of the events in 539" BC when Medes (and Persia) actually conquered Babylon.


Verse 21

    _Desert animals will move into the ruined city_ (NLT) [14]

Owls, ostriches and goats are identified as examples.
