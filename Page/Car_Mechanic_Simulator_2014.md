_CAR MECHANIC SIMULATOR 2014_ is a simulation video game depicting the work of an automotive mechanic. It was released in January 2014 on for Windows and macOS,[1] and for iOS and Android.[2] The game has a sequel, _Car Mechanic Simulator 2015_.


Gameplay

The game is played from a first-person perspective, with the player able to walk freely around the shop. Instead of levels, the game is divided into "jobs" - customer vehicles with a list of problems — which the player must troubleshoot and repair. Upon receiving a job and a vehicle, the player is required to remove, inspect, and replace the relevant broken parts. When a vehicle is reassembled, it may be taken for a test drive before being returned to the customer.


Reception

_Car Mechanic Simulator 2014_ received average reviews from critics, with a mixed reception according to Metacritic.[3]


Extensions

Game offers two extensions with packs of additional cars to repair:[4]

-   4X4 EXPANSION PACK provides 20 new F2P work orders for various repairs of 4X4 off road vehicles and is available at no cost to owners of the baseline Steam-enabled release. The primary 4X4 car is a separate body frame with rigid, live front and rear axles. It presents unique new maintenance challenges far different from those in the base version of _Car Mechanic Simulator 2014_. Once installed, new parts appear in the garage shop including front and rear axles, drive shafts, special off-road shock absorbers and a rear muffler. The new vehicle is also available in endless mode.
-   1/4 MILE EXPANSION PACK comes with new test track, where you can check the performance of tuned cars.
