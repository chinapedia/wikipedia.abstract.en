During the 1955–56 English football season, Brentford competed in the Football League Third Division South. A promising 6th-place finish was achieved with a squad mainly drawn from the club's youth system.


Season summary

Brentford went into the 1955–56 Third Division South season full of optimism, with the side having lost only four of the final 18 matches of the 1954–55 season, winning 9.[1] Of the productive youth system (now led by former player Ernest Muttitt), forwards Jim Towers and Dennis Heath had established themselves in the first team, while George Francis and Gerry Cakebread had also made their debuts.[2] Full backs Alan Bassham, George Lowden and half backs Wally Bragg and George Bristow also made up the ranks of home-grown players in the first team squad and forward John Pearson would be another to graduate from the youth team during the 1955–56 season.[3] Chelsea full back Sid Tickridge was manager Bill Dodgin Sr.'s only major signing of the off-season and he replaced Frank Latimer as club captain.

Despite winning more games than they had lost, Brentford hovered in mid-table during the opening three months of the season.[4] Forward Jeff Taylor led the attack, scoring 11 goals in as many matches during a five-week period in September and October 1955.[5] Buoyed by four goals in five league matches by Wendell Morgan and news from the boardroom that a £9,000 profit had been made on the year ending in May 1955,[6] the Bees moved as high as 8th-place in early December, before losing form again later in the month.[7] Victory over Exeter City on 4 February 1956 (courtesy of a George Francis brace) was the first win of a strong run which lasted for the remainder of the season, with the team's record almost mirroring that of the final 18 matches of the previous campaign.[8] Brentford finished the season in 6th-place, 11 points behind the leading three clubs, but 22-goal Jim Towers and goalkeeper Gerry Cakebread had established themselves as two of the best players in the Third Division South.

Long-serving Jimmy Bain retired at the end of season, after nearly 27 years as a player, assistant manager and caretaker manager at Griffin Park. He received a Long Service Medal from the Football League in recognition of his long service.
