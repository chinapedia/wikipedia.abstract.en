TOIVO RIKHART PEKKANEN (10 September 1902 Kotka, Finland – 30 May 1957 Copenhagen, Denmark) was a writer from Finland.

He was a working class writer without much formal education and is notable for being the first member of the working class to make a living from writing. [1] The Pekkas Award has been established in his honor.

Pekkanen's breaktrough work _Tehtaan varjossa_ (1932, in Shadow of the factory) describes realistically but dispassionately the living conditions of the working class. The hero, Samuel Oino, educates himself to get a better life - much like Pekkanen himself. His second well known book is the autobiographical _Lapsuuteni_ (1953, My Childhood), about his poor childhood years. The Finnish Civil War is seen from the Reds' side but without bitterness.[2]

Pekkanen was in Copenhagen, Denmark, improving his health, when he died from a brain hemorrhage.[3]
