FRIEDRICH SIEBENMANN (22 May 1852, in Uerkheim – 4 April 1928, in Basel) was a Swiss otolaryngologist.

From 1871 he studied at the universities of Zürich, Würzburg and Bern, and afterwards worked as a physician in the communities of Muri and Brugg. He furthered his education in otology and laryngology in Vienna, Breslau and Munich and in 1888 obtained his habilitation. In 1892 he became an associate professor for otolaryngology at the University of Basel, and from 1896 to 1922 served as director of the otolaryngology clinic at Basel municipal hospital.[1][2]

He is best remembered for anatomical research of the inner ear and for studies involving the pathology of deafness.[3] In 1908 he was the first physician to describe lipoid proteinosis, a disorder also known as Urbach–Wiethe disease.[4]
