Lydia_circa_50_AD_-_English_legend.jpg GORDUS or GORDOS (),[1] also known as JULIA GORDUS or IULIA GORDOS, and possibly also known as POROTTA,[2][3] was an ancient Greek city located in eastern Lydia (modern western Turkey). It was a strategically important town founded by the Seleucid Kings. The Julio-Claudian emperors of the Roman Empire renamed the city Julia Gordos in the 1st century and the city minted its own coins.[4][5][6]

The city achieved the full status of a _polis_ under the Flavian emperors.[7]

It was the home to Appolophanes the physician,[8] and there is epigraphical evidence of both pagans[9] and Christians in the town.[10]

Three bishops of the town are known: Isidor attended Third Council of Constantinople, Neophytus attended the Second Council of Nicaea and Stephen attended the Photian Council of 870. No longer the seat of a residential bishop, it remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.[11]

Its site is located near Eski Gördes in Asiatic Turkey.[12][13]
