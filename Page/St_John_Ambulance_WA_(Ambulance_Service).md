ST JOHN AMBULANCE WESTERN AUSTRALIA (ST JOHN WA) is a non-profit, charitable organisation providing first aid services and training, urgent care, patient transport, ambulance and other medical services in Western Australia. It has provided the statutory ambulance service in Western Australia since 1922.[1] These services are provided through a combination of paid and volunteer staff. St John WA is funded through a combination of government funding, Lotterywest grants, corporate and private donations and user pays services.[2]

Western Australia and the Northern Territory are the only two states or territories in Australia which do not have an ambulance service provided by government agencies and regulated by legislation.[3]

Uniform

Previous uniforms were the traditional white shirts with black trousers, these were replaced during the 1970's with blue trousers and a white smock for summer uniform, along with a white skivvy and blue jacket for winter. In 1981 the uniforms changed to blue trousers, blue shirt and a blue jacket with tie for winter. In 1983 a padded winter jacket with reflective stripes replaced the blue jacket. Ties were discontinued at that time as they were impractical in the field. In 1995 a light green shirt, teamed with dark green pants and jacket was introduced. In the late 2000's the uniforms were upgraded to the new style of all over, utility suit. These consist of a black undershirt with dark green shirt, jacket and pants with reflective stripes. Rescue helmets are utilised in certain situations along with high visibility vests with officer rank visible.


Criticisms

In July 2009, the ABC's _Four Corners_ broadcast a report identifying failures in St John's call-out system, specifically the failure of call centre operators to appropriately prioritise and respond ambulances.[5] The program identified four deaths in which dispatch and prioritisation errors were involved. The WA Health Minister, Dr Kim Hames, has since promised to review "reports of significant wrongdoing, and see if it is correct" in order to prevent recurrence of such events.[6]

On 24 March 2015, the ABC's 7.30 reported on poor management and culture within St John in Western Australia which led an ambulance officer to commit suicide.[7]
