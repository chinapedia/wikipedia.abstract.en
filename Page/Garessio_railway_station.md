GARESSIO RAILWAY STATION () is the train station serving the _comune_ of Garessio, in the Piedmont region, northwestern Italy. It is the junction of the Ceva–Ormea.

The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the passenger building is managed by comune. The station is served only by historic trains, in the service of tourism, on planned dates.[1] The regular service has been suspended from 12 June 2012, by decision of the Piedmont Region.[2][3] Train services are operated by Fondazione FS and Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company.


History

The station was opened on 15 July 1890, upon the inauguration of the track from Priola to Garessio of the Ceva–Ormea railway.[4]
