Aurigo Software was established in January 2003 by Balaji Sreenivasan, an alumnus of the National Institute of Technology (NIT) in Tiruchirappalli, India and the University of Florida, Gainesville.[1][2] Sreenivasan is also a member of The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE) and in 2016 was awarded the Young Alumnus Achiever (YAA) Award for entrepreneurial achievement by the National Institute of Technology.[3] Aurigo's current chairman, Ravi Gulati, is an alumnus of IIT Kharagpur and Carnegie Mellon University, and founded Stonybrook Software in the 1990s, which later became Ascend and then Lucent in 1999, when Gulati was appointed President of their NSO business division. He became director of Aurigo in December 2005, and has been chairman since 2006.[4]


History

In 2007, Aurigo entered into an agreement with The Oregon Bridge Delivery Partners (OBDP), who have been using its capital project management application to automate the Oregon Department of Transportation’s (ODOT) $2.5 billion OTIA III State Bridge Delivery Program.[5] The City of Lincoln, Nebraska began working with Aurigo in 2012.[6]

In August 2013, Aurigo moved its headquarters from New York City to Austin, Texas.[7] Three months later it was reported that the company had managed to attract an additional $6.3 million.[8] In June 2014, Aurigo entered into a seven-year deal with Ontario's ministry of transportation. Gulati said of the agreement: “Infrastructure is falling apart. Governments don't have money to spend. So let the beneficiaries (the contractors) pay. It also increases project efficiency and brings savings for all”.[9] In January 2015, the company announced that it had reached a three-year agreement with Canadian energy company TransCanada, with TransCanada agreeing to use Aurigo's software in its pipeline projects.[10] Another agreement was made with Utah DOT for providing project controls software the same month. UDOT has reportedly estimated that using Aurigo Masterworks will bring them annual savings of between $9.5 and $19 million, in six different areas of improvement.[11] The following month, Aurigo announced that it had entered into a five-year multimillion-dollar agreement with the Port of Portland, who now use Aurigo for its capital project management.[12] In March, Aurigo entered into a five-year deal with Tampa Bay Water, taking responsibility for their project management system, which prior to the deal had been self-managed.[13] In June, the company entered into an agreement with Colorado’s Department of Transportation,[14] followed by a three-year deal with the City of Houston's General Services Department in August 2015.[15]

In January 2016,[16] Aurigo beat off the likes of SciQuest, CDW-G, Birlasoft and BidSync to be awarded the responsibility for Wisconsin Department of Transportation’s management software project portfolio, managing its “contract solicitation, selection, development, execution, and tracking”.[17] In August Aurigo entered into an agreement with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.[18] In November, Aurigo made agreements with the City of Las Vegas, Nevada[19] and the Regional Municipality of York, Ontario, Canada.[20] Aurigo also has agreements with Fargo, North Dakota and Pinellas County, Florida.[21]
