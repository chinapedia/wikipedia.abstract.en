MARY MARGARET GABRIELSE (born 1923 in Tjimahi, Indonesia) is the niece of Johannes Gabrielse.

Just before World War II she was a champion swimmer holding several Dutch East Indies swim records as well as Asian swimming records.

After the war she became an artist having studied art at school. She also was an artist and interned in the Japanese camps of World War II. She survived as did a number of her colour illustrations reflecting camp life in the women's camp and now at the museum Museon.

Her other work produced after the war is in private hands. She was not prolific due to family responsibilities but with her habit of illustrating her letters to her very large correspondence contacts has ensured that her work is well spread and in many hands.
