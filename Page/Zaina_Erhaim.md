Biography

Erhaim was born in Idlib in north western Syria.[6] She was educated in Damascus.[7] In 2011, Erhaim pursued a masters in International Journalism from City, University of London on a Chevening scholarship; around the same time the Syrian civil war begun.[8][9][10] Erhaim spent a year[11] or two[12] as a broadcast journalist with BBC Arabic Television before returning to Aleppo in 2013[13][14][15][16] in order to report on the situation there.[17] Aleppo is the worst-hit city in the civil war, since the Battle of Aleppo began in 2012 it has been split between the government-held west and the rebel-held east. Reporting from within Syria, Erhaim has contributed to _The Economist,_ _The Guardian,_[18] _Newsweek,_[19] _Middle East Eye,_[20] Orient TV,[21] _Al-Hayat_[22] and Syria-News.[23] As the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR)'s Syria project coordinator, Erhaim also trained hundreds of citizen reporters in print and TV journalism whilst in Syria, notably including many women, to report "independently and accurately" on the civil war.[24] She helped establish many of Syria’s emerging independent newspapers and magazines.[25][26] She fled Syria in 2015[27] and continues working as IWPR's Syria project coordinator, now in Turkey.[28]

In 2015 a series of short documentary films directed by Erhaim, _Syria's Rebellious Women,_ were first screened.[29] The films were made over a period of 18 months in rebel-held parts of Aleppo. They tell the individual stories of a diverse group of women and the challenges facing them from the Assad government’s air force, the conservative traditions of a male-dominated society, and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.[30][31][32]

In September 2016, upon arrival for a visit to the UK, Erhaim had her passport confiscated by border officials at the request of the Syrian government, who had declared it stolen.[33][34][35][36] She was visiting to give a talk with Kate Adie[37] about "how and why reporters take risks to get close to the action, and the vital role women can play in bringing truth to light" at the Write on Kew literary festival.[38]
