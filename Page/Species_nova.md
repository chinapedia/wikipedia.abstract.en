In biological taxonomy, a __ (plural: __; abbreviation: __ plural abbreviation: __) is a new species.[2] The phrase is Latin,[3] and is used after a binomial name that is being published for the first time.[4]

An example is the species of miniature frog, _Paedophryne amauensis_, originally described as _Paedophryne amauensis sp. nov._ in PLOS ONE in 2012.[5]

The term should not to be confused with __, used when a previously named taxon is moved to a different genus or species, or its rank is changed.
