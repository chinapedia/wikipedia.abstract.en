History

The Sussex manor of Glottenham has had boundary ditches since the eleventh century, and the moat at Glottenham Castle is believed to date from around 1200.[2] Glottenham Castle was built in the late thirteenth century. The castle had stone walls, two square towers and a gatehouse.[3][4] The castle was owned by the de Etchingham family, before being abandoned in the late 16th or 17th century.[5] In 1990, the site was listed under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.[6] The site is now a popular camping and glamping site.[7][8]
