with the same length as the radius of that circle subtends an _angle_ of 1 radian. The circumference subtends an angle of 2 radians.]] The RADIAN is the SI unit for measuring angles, and is the standard unit of angular measure used in many areas of mathematics. The length of an arc of a unit circle is numerically equal to the measurement in radians of the angle that it subtends; one radian is just under 57.3 degrees (expansion at ). The unit was formerly an SI supplementary unit, but this category was abolished in 1995 and the radian is now considered an SI derived unit.[1]

Separately, the SI unit of solid angle measurement is the steradian.

The radian is most commonly represented by the symbol RAD.[2] An alternative symbol is ^(c), the superscript letter c (for "circular measure"), the letter r, or a superscript ,[3] but these symbols are infrequently used as it can be easily mistaken for a degree symbol (°) or a radius (r). So, for example, a value of 1.2 radians could be written as 1.2 rad, 1.2 r, 1.2, 1.2, or 1.2.


Definition

Radian describes the plane angle subtended by a circular arc as the length of the arc divided by the radius of the arc. One radian is the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc that is equal in length to the radius of the circle. More generally, the magnitude in radians of such a subtended angle is equal to the ratio of the arc length to the radius of the circle; that is, , where _θ_ is the subtended angle in radians, _s_ is arc length, and _r_ is radius. Conversely, the length of the enclosed arc is equal to the radius multiplied by the magnitude of the angle in radians; that is, .

As the ratio of two lengths, the radian is a "pure number" that needs no unit symbol, and in mathematical writing the symbol "rad" is almost always omitted. When quantifying an angle in the absence of any symbol, radians are assumed, and when degrees are meant the symbol ° is used.

2).]] It follows that the magnitude in radians of one complete revolution (360 degrees) is the length of the entire circumference divided by the radius, or , or 2. Thus 2 radians is equal to 360 degrees, meaning that one radian is equal to 180/ degrees.

The relation 2π rad = 360^(∘) can be derived using the formula for arc length. Taking the formula for arc length, or $\ell_{arc}=2\pi r\left(\frac{\theta}{360^{\circ}}\right)$. Assuming a unit circle; the radius is therefore one. Knowing that the definition of radian is the measure of an angle that subtends an arc of a length equal to the radius of the circle, we know that $1=2\pi\left(\frac{1\text{ rad}}{360^{\circ}}\right)$. This can be further simplified to $1=\frac{2\pi\text{ rad}}{360^{\circ}}$. Multiplying both sides by 360^(∘) gives 360^(∘) = 2π rad.


History

The concept of radian measure, as opposed to the degree of an angle, is normally credited to Roger Cotes in 1714.[4][5] He described the radian in everything but name, and he recognized its naturalness as a unit of angular measure. Prior to the term _radian_ becoming widespread, the unit was commonly called _circular measure_ of an angle.[6]

The idea of measuring angles by the length of the arc was already in use by other mathematicians. For example, al-Kashi (c. 1400) used so-called _diameter parts_ as units where one diameter part was radian and they also used sexagesimal subunits of the diameter part.[7]

The term _radian_ first appeared in print on 5 June 1873, in examination questions set by James Thomson (brother of Lord Kelvin) at Queen's College, Belfast. He had used the term as early as 1871, while in 1869, Thomas Muir, then of the University of St Andrews, vacillated between the terms _rad_, _radial_, and _radian_. In 1874, after a consultation with James Thomson, Muir adopted _radian_.[8][9][10]


Conversions

Conversion between radians and degrees

As stated, one radian is equal to 180/ degrees. Thus, to convert from radians to degrees, multiply by 180/.

$$\text{angle in degrees} = \text{angle in radians} \cdot \frac {180^\circ} {\pi}$$

For example:

$$1 \text{ rad} = 1 \cdot \frac {180^\circ} {\pi} \approx 57.2958^\circ$$

$$2.5 \text{ rad} = 2.5 \cdot \frac {180^\circ} {\pi} \approx 143.2394^\circ$$

$$\frac {\pi} {3} \text{ rad} = \frac {\pi} {3} \cdot \frac {180^\circ} {\pi} = 60^\circ$$

Conversely, to convert from degrees to radians, multiply by /180.

$$\text{angle in radians} = \text{angle in degrees} \cdot \frac {\pi} {180^\circ}$$

For example:

$$1^\circ = 1 \cdot \frac {\pi} {180^\circ} \approx 0.0175 \text{ rad}$$
$23^\circ = 23 \cdot \frac {\pi} {180^\circ} \approx 0.4014 \text{ rad}$

Radians can be converted to turns (complete revolutions) by dividing the number of radians by 2.

Radian to degree conversion derivation

The length of circumference of a circle is given by 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle.

So the following equivalent relation is true:

360^(∘) ⇔ 2πr[Since a 360^(∘) sweep is needed to draw a full circle]

By the definition of radian, a full circle represents:

$$\frac{2\pi r}{r} \text{ rad}$$

 = 2_π_ rad

Combining both the above relations:

2_π_ rad = 360^(∘)

$$\Rrightarrow 1 \text{ rad} = \frac{360^\circ}{2\pi}$$

$$\Rrightarrow 1 \text{ rad} = \frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$$

Conversion between radians and gradians

2π radians equals one turn, which is by definition 400 gradians (400 gons or 400^(g)). So, to convert from radians to gradians multiply by 200/π, and to convert from gradians to radians multiply by π/200. For example,

$$1.2 \text{ rad} = 1.2 \cdot \frac {200^\text{g}} {\pi} \approx 76.3944^\text{g}$$

$$50^\text{g} = 50 \cdot \frac {\pi} {200^\text{g}} \approx 0.7854 \text{ rad}$$


Advantages of measuring in radians

s.]]

In calculus and most other branches of mathematics beyond practical geometry, angles are universally measured in radians. This is because radians have a mathematical "naturalness" that leads to a more elegant formulation of a number of important results.

Most notably, results in analysis involving trigonometric functions are simple and elegant when the functions' arguments are expressed in radians. For example, the use of radians leads to the simple limit formula

$$\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{\sin h}{h}=1,$$

which is the basis of many other identities in mathematics, including

$$\frac{d}{dx} \sin x = \cos x$$

$$\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \sin x = -\sin x.$$

Because of these and other properties, the trigonometric functions appear in solutions to mathematical problems that are not obviously related to the functions' geometrical meanings (for example, the solutions to the differential equation $\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = -y$, the evaluation of the integral $\int \frac{dx}{1+x^2}$, and so on). In all such cases it is found that the arguments to the functions are most naturally written in the form that corresponds, in geometrical contexts, to the radian measurement of angles.

The trigonometric functions also have simple and elegant series expansions when radians are used; for example, the following Taylor series for sin _x_ :

$$\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots .$$

If _x_ were expressed in degrees then the series would contain messy factors involving powers of /180: if _x_ is the number of degrees, the number of radians is , so

$$\sin x_\mathrm{deg} = \sin y_\mathrm{rad} = \frac{\pi}{180} x - \left (\frac{\pi}{180} \right )^3\ \frac{x^3}{3!} + \left (\frac{\pi}{180} \right )^5\ \frac{x^5}{5!} - \left (\frac{\pi}{180} \right )^7\ \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots .$$

Mathematically important relationships between the sine and cosine functions and the exponential function (see, for example, Euler's formula) are, again, elegant when the functions' arguments are in radians and messy otherwise.


Dimensional analysis

Although the radian is a unit of measure, it is a dimensionless quantity. This can be seen from the definition given earlier: the angle subtended at the centre of a circle, measured in radians, is equal to the ratio of the length of the enclosed arc to the length of the circle's radius. Since the units of measurement cancel, this ratio is dimensionless.

Although polar and spherical coordinates use radians to describe coordinates in two and three dimensions, the unit is derived from the radius coordinate, so the angle measure is still dimensionless.[11]


Use in physics

The radian is widely used in physics when angular measurements are required. For example, angular velocity is typically measured in radians per second (rad/s). One revolution per second is equal to 2 radians per second.

Similarly, angular acceleration is often measured in radians per second per second (rad/s²).

For the purpose of dimensional analysis, the units of angular velocity and angular acceleration are s^(−1) and s^(−2) respectively.

Likewise, the phase difference of two waves can also be measured in radians. For example, if the phase difference of two waves is (_k_⋅2) radians, where _k_ is an integer, they are considered in phase, whilst if the phase difference of two waves is (), where _k_ is an integer, they are considered in antiphase.


SI multiples

Metric prefixes have limited use with radians, and none in mathematics. A milliradian (mrad) is a thousandth of a radian and a microradian (μrad) is a millionth of a radian, i.e. .

There are 2 × 1000 milliradians (≈ 6283.185 mrad) in a circle. So a trigonometric milliradian is just under of a circle. This “real” trigonometric unit of angular measurement of a circle is in use by telescopic sight manufacturers using (stadiametric) rangefinding in reticles. The divergence of laser beams is also usually measured in milliradians.

An approximation of the trigonometric milliradian (0.001 rad) is used by NATO and other military organizations in gunnery and targeting. Each angular mil represents of a circle and is % or 1.875% smaller than the trigonometric milliradian. For the small angles typically found in targeting work, the convenience of using the number 6400 in calculation outweighs the small mathematical errors it introduces. In the past, other gunnery systems have used different approximations to ; for example Sweden used the _streck_ and the USSR used . Being based on the milliradian, the NATO mil subtends roughly 1 m at a range of 1000 m (at such small angles, the curvature is negligible).

Smaller units like microradians (μrad) and nanoradians (nrad) are used in astronomy, and can also be used to measure the beam quality of lasers with ultra-low divergence. More common is arc second, which is  rad (around 4.8481 microradians). Similarly, the prefixes smaller than milli- are potentially useful in measuring extremely small angles.
