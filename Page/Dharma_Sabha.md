DHARMA SABHA was formed in 1829 in Calcutta by Akash Kant. The organization was established mainly to counter the ongoing social reform movements led by protagonists such as Raja Ram Mohun Roy and Henry Derozio. More specifically, the impetus of forming the organization came from a new law enacted by the colonial British rule which banned the practice of sati in the country; the focus of the new association was to repel the law which was seen as an intrusion by the British into the religious affairs of the indigenous people by some sections of the Hindu community.[1]

This Sabha again resisted the Hindu Widow Remarriage Act, 1856, passed by British India under pressure from Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar.

The organization soon morphed into a 'society in defense of Hindu way of life or culture'.[2]
