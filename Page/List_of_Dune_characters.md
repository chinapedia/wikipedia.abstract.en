_Dune_ is a science fiction media franchise that originated with the 1965 novel _Dune_ by American author Frank Herbert. _Dune_ is frequently cited as the best-selling science fiction novel in history,[1][2] and won the 1966 Hugo Award[3] as well as the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel.[4] Herbert wrote five sequels before his death in 1986.[5][6][7] _Dune_ was adapted into a 1984 film,[8][9] and a 2000 television miniseries.[10][11] The first two sequels were presented as a miniseries in 2003.[12]

Since 1999, Herbert's son Brian Herbert and science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson have published eleven prequel novels, as well as two which complete the original _Dune_ series.[13]
