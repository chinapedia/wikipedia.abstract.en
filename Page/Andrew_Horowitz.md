In high school, he pursued composition and piano studies with faculty at the Juilliard School.

Over the summers, he attended the Interlochen Arts Festival and Aspen Music Festival.[2]

He attended the University of Michigan in 2001 and received bachelor's degrees in Music Composition and English Literature. He studied composition privately with Susan Botti, Michael Daugherty, Curtis Curtis-Smith, William Bolcom, Evan Chambers and Karen Tanaka. He also attended La Schola Cantorum’s counterpoint workshop in Paris.

As a writer, Horowitz won two Hopwood Awards for fiction and poetry.[3] Andrew was also a senior arts writer for The Michigan Daily.[4]

In 2005, Horowitz was the recipient of BMI Foundation's John Lennon Scholarship Award for writing Tally Hall's "Good Day".[5]
