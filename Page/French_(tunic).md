_FRENCH_ () was the designation of a particular type of military jacket or tunic in the Russian Empire and later in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Related words are _kurtka_, (куртка), _kitel_ (китель; derived from German: _Kittel_) or _pidzhak_ (пиджак; derived from English: _pea-jacket_).

In the years immediately preceding the start of World War I, a large number of new uniform jackets were created in Russia, in most cases related to (and influenced by) the latest creations in the armies of France and the United Kingdom. These kinds of uniform jackets received the collective designation _french_ in relation to the supreme commander of the British Expeditionary Force to France, field marshal John French.

The main features of _french_ were as follows:

-   soft collar – turndown version or standing version with button fastening,
-   variable half-belt and changeable sleeves
-   four big pockets (appliquéd, with buttons) with flaps (two upper chest, two below).

In the Red Army of the Soviet Union it was usually worn by commanding officers, chiefs and political officers and from 1924 to 1943.

In the air force there was a limited number of _frenches_ regularly worn by British officers. It was characterised by an open collar, to be worn with tie or scarf.


Evolution to the _Stalin tunic_

The _French_ tunic eventually evolved in the 1920s to the Stalin tunic, which was adopted by several political leaders, such as Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong (Mao suit) and Chiang Kai-shek.
