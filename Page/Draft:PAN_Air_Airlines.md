History

PAN AIR was established in October 1988, and was owned and operated privately by Paul Nicholas, untill ceasing operation in the late 2000's.

The company logo was originally hand painted on the tail of all aeroplanes and helicopters, with no original digital reference. This was later re-created manually in digital format.
