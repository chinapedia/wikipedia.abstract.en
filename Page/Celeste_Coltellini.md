CELESTE COLTELLINI (26 November 1760 - 24 July 1828) was an Italian soprano. She was a well-known singer of opera buffa in Europe in the late 18th century.[1]

Born in Livorno, Celeste was the daughter of a librettist, Marco Coltellini. In 1780, she made her debut at Teatro alla Scala in Milan, performing in three operas: Giovanni Valentini's _Le nozze in contrasto_, Giacomo Rust's _Gli antiquari in Palmira_ and Giovanni Paisiello's _La Frascatana_, singing in mezzo-soprano register. She then sang at Teatro San Carlo in Naples, where she had the opportunity to meet Emperor Joseph II, who later invited her to perform in Vienna.

When her voice changed to soprano, she accepted the Emperor's invitation. In 1785, she went to Vienna with her mother, and stayed there for a year. In Vienna, she made her debut singing Domenico Cimarosa’s _Contadina di spirito_. She returned to Vienna again in 1788, but stayed just for a few months. She was seen with Mozart several times at music performances and parties, however, there was no record or any official report mentioning about any affairs or collaboration works between them.

Coltellini was famous for her excellent interpretation of the title role Nina, o sia La pazza per amore by Giovanni Paisiello. Her sister, Annetta also a singer, often accompanied her in the production.

In 1792, at the age of 32, Celeste retired from the opera stage and married the Swiss banker Jean-Georges Meuricoffre who owned a bank in Naples.[2]

Coltellini died in Naples in 1828.
