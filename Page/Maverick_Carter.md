MAVERICK CARTER is an American businessman and media personality.


Early life and education

Originally from Atlanta, GA, Maverick grew up the son of Katherine Powers, a social worker, and Otis Carter, a drug dealer who spent much of Maverick's childhood in federal penitentiaries.[1] Carter is a longtime friend of LeBron James; both played basketball at St. Vincentâ€“St. Mary High School in Akron. After graduating from SVSM, Carter played college basketball at Western Michigan, before transferring to The University of Akron and focusing on other pursuits.[2]


Career

While in college, Carter interned with Nike, withdrawing from college to become a Nike field representative.[3] Carter has served as James' business manager since 2006. Carter (along with James, Rich Paul and Randy Mims) is one of the founders and principals of agent and sports-marketing company LRMR. Carter was responsible for engineering "The Decision", generally believed to be a marketing failure.[4] However, Carter has also had his share of successes, such as arranging a deal between LRMR and Fenway Sports Group that secured James a partial stake in Liverpool F.C. and bolstered his overseas profile.[5] Carter developed The LeBrons series of commercials featuring caricatures of LeBron.[6] Carter and James founded SpringHill Entertainment, a collaborator of Warner Bros. whose projects include the Disney XD series _Becoming_, the Starz series _Survivor's Remorse_, the NBC game show _The Wall_ and the Bleacher Report spinoff "Uninterrupted"[7]

Besides managing LeBron James, other business management clients of Carter include former football player Johnny Manziel.
