_AT THE CROSSROADS_ is an album by saxophonist James Carter's Organ Trio which was released on the EmArcy label in 2011.[1]


Reception

The _Allmusic_ review by Thom Jurek says, "_At the Crossroads_ delivers what its title promises: a portrait of the Organ Trio at the point where they look back at B-3 jazz history and move it ever forward".[2] In _JazzTimes_ Steve Greenlee said, "Carter’s tone—alternately gruff and sensuous, always balancing melody and skronk—of course gets the limelight. His is, after all, one of today’s most unmistakable saxophone voices, and he knows it".[3] On _All About Jazz_ C. Michael Bailey noted, "Carter takes advantage of the music, exploring all of its facets in his exceptional organ trio format. No stone is left unturned, no influence unaknowledged".[4] The Guardian critic John Fordham wrote, "Carter can be sumptuously romantic or exhilaratingly funky – his technique embraces all kinds of extreme playing, from split-note multiphonic harmonies to staccato effects – and he directs his full firepower at this mostly mainstream-groovy repertoire".[5]
