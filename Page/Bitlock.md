The BITLOCK is a brand of bicycle lock for securing a bicycle to a pole or other fixture, similar to a standard U-lock but it also incorporates a smartlock that can be activated via bluetooth with a smartphone.[1]

Bitlock specifically, and bluetooth-based locking systems in general, have been criticized for being too easy to hack. In August 2016, _Tom's Guide_ reported that researches had found a vulnerability in the lock which they had reported to the company, but remained unpatched six months later. [2]

Bitlock was initially funding through Kickstarter in 2013 for delivery in 2014, but manufacturing problems delayed delivery.[3]
