_TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT_ is an American television talk program on Fox News Channel hosted by Tucker Carlson. Episodes air live at 8:00 p.m. EST on weekdays. The show focuses on politics and includes commentary, monologues, interviews, and political analysis.

_Tucker Carlson Tonight_ has been a part of the Fox News Channel's program lineup since November 14, 2016, and was the number one cable news broadcast in its time slot as of April 2018.[1]


History

_Tucker Carlson Tonight_ was created to replace the show _On the Record_,[2] which was hosted by Brit Hume on an interim basis after Greta Van Susteren's departure from Fox News.

Following Megyn Kelly's departure from Fox News, it was announced on January 5, 2017, that the show would be the replacement for _The Kelly File_ on January 9, 2017.[3] Martha MacCallum was named as his replacement in the 7:00 p.m. timeslot, with her show carrying the title _The First 100 Days_.[4]

On April 19, 2017, it was announced that the show would take over _The O'Reilly Factor_'s 8:00 p.m. time-slot beginning April 24, 2017, following the cancellation of the latter program.[5] It was made public that _Hannity_ would replace the 9:00 p.m. time slot Carlson left.


Synopsis

Carlson, who co-founded _The Daily Caller_,[6] (with Neil Patel), typically devotes his show to two or three current events and brings on speakers to debate about them. Carlson uses a loose format in which he interviews persons from varied political perspectives and asks them probing questions. The show also includes monologues, commentary and political analysis.

Carlson describes _Tucker Carlson Tonight_ with the tagline, "the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink."[7]

_Tucker Carlson Tonight_ is broadcast from a studio at 400 N Capitol Street, Washington D.C.. Carlson debuted a new set April 19, 2017, remodeling the previous set.
