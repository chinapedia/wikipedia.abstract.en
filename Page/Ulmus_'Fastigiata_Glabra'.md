The ELM cultivar _ULMUS_ 'FASTIGIATA GLABRA' was distributed by the Späth nursery, Berlin, in the 1890s and early 1900s as _U. montana fastigiata glabra_. Späth used _U. montana_ both for wych elm and for _U._ × _hollandica_ hybrids like 'Dampieri',[1] so the name does not necessarily imply a wych elm cultivar. A specimen in the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh was determined by Melville in 1958 as a hybrid of the _U._ × _hollandica_ group (he called it _U. glabra_ × _U. carpinifolia_ [:_U. minor_ ] × _U. plotii_ [:_U. minor_ 'Plotii' ]).[2] The cultivar did not appear in Späth's 1903 catalogue.

Not to be confused with _U. montana fastigiata_, Exeter Elm.


Description

Späth's name implies that when young, at least, the tree had an upright form and smooth leaves.


Pests and diseases

Not known. Some examples of the _U._ × _hollandica_ group possess a moderate resistance to Dutch elm disease.[3]


Cultivation

One tree was planted in 1898 as _U. montana fastigiata glabra_ at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, Canada.[4] Three specimens supplied by Späth to the RBGE in 1902 as _U. montana fastigiata glabra_ may survive in Edinburgh, as it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city (viz. the Wentworth Elm);[5] the current list of Living Accessions held in the Garden _per se_ does not list the plant.[6] A largish-leaved glabrous elm on The Mound, Edinburgh (2016) matches the 1958 RBGE herbarium leaf-specimen of _U. montana fastigiata glabra_ (see EXTERNAL LINKS below) and may be an example of the cultivar.
