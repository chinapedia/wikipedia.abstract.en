Overview

Voight came to prominence in the late 1960s with his Oscar-nominated performance as Joe Buck, a would-be gigolo in _Midnight Cowboy_ (1969). During the 1970s, he became a Hollywood star with his portrayals of a businessman mixed up with murder in _Deliverance_ (1972); a paraplegic Vietnam veteran in _Coming Home_ (1978), for which he won an Academy Award for Best Actor; and a penniless ex-boxing champion in the remake of _The Champ_ (1979).

His output became sparse during the 1980s and early 1990s, although he won the Golden Globe and was nominated for an Academy Award for his iconic performance as the ruthless bank robber Oscar "Manny" Manheim in _Runaway Train_ (1985). Voight made a comeback in Hollywood during the mid-1990s, starring in Michael Mann's crime epic _Heat_ (1995) opposite Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. He portrayed Jim Phelps in _Mission: Impossible_ (1996), a corrupt NSA agent in _Enemy of the State_ (1998), and the unscrupulous attorney Leo F. Drummond in Francis Ford Coppola's _The Rainmaker_ (1997), which earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

Voight gave critically acclaimed biographical performances during the 2000s, appearing as legendary sportscaster Howard Cosell in _Ali_ (2001) for which his supporting performance was nominated for the Academy Award, the Golden Globe and a Critics Choice Award, and also as Nazi officer Jürgen Stroop in _Uprising_ (2001), as Franklin D. Roosevelt in Michael Bay's _Pearl Harbor_ (2001) and as Pope John Paul II in the eponymous miniseries (2005). Voight also appears in Showtime's _Ray Donovan_ TV series, now in its sixth season as Mickey Donovan, a role that brought him newfound critical and audience acclaim and his fourth Golden Globe win in 2014.


Early life

Voight was born on December 29, 1938, in Yonkers, New York,[1] the son of Barbara (; 1910–1995) and Elmer Voight (né Voytka; 1909–1973),[2] a professional golfer. He has two brothers, Barry Voight (born 1937), a former volcanologist at Pennsylvania State University,[3] and James Wesley Voight (born March 21, 1940), known as Chip Taylor, a singer-songwriter who wrote "Wild Thing" and "Angel of the Morning". Voight's paternal grandfather and his paternal grandmother's parents were Slovak immigrants,[4] while his maternal grandfather and his maternal grandmother's parents were German immigrants.[5] Joseph P. Kamp was his great-uncle through his mother.[6]

Voight was raised as a Catholic[7] and attended Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains, New York, where he first took an interest in acting, playing the comedic role of Count Pepi Le Loup in the school's annual musical, _The Song of Norway_. Following his graduation in 1956, he enrolled at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he majored in art and graduated with a B.A. in 1960. After graduation, Voight moved to New York City, where he pursued an acting career.


Personal life

In 1962, Voight married actress Lauri Peters, who he met when they both appeared in the original Broadway production of _The Sound of Music_. They divorced in 1967. He married actress Marcheline Bertrand in 1971. They separated in 1976, filed for divorce in 1978, and divorced in 1980. Their children, James Haven (born May 11, 1973) and Angelina Jolie (born June 4, 1975), would go on to enter the film business as actors and producers. While still married to Bertrand, Voight had an affair which upset his children leading to a breakdown in their relationship for several years.[8] They reconciled in 2007 after Bertrand's death.[9]


Career

1960s

In the early 1960s, Voight found work in television, appearing in several episodes of _Gunsmoke_, between 1963 and 1968, as well as guest spots on _Naked City_, and _The Defenders_, both in 1963, and _Twelve O'Clock High_, in 1966.

His theatre career took off in January 1965, playing Rodolfo in Arthur Miller's _A View from the Bridge_ in an Off-Broadway revival.

Voight's film debut did not come until 1967, when he took a part in Phillip Kaufman's crimefighter spoof, _Fearless Frank_. Voight also took a small role in 1967's western, _Hour of the Gun_, directed by veteran helmer John Sturges. In 1968 Voight took a role in director Paul Williams's _Out of It_.

In 1969, Voight was cast in the groundbreaking _Midnight Cowboy_, a film that would make his career. Voight played Joe Buck, a naïve male hustler from Texas, adrift in New York City. He comes under the tutelage of Dustin Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo, a tubercular petty thief and con artist. The film explored late 1960s New York and the development of an unlikely, but poignant friendship between the two main characters. Directed by John Schlesinger and based on a novel by James Leo Herlihy, the film struck a chord with critics and audiences. Because of its controversial themes, the film was released with an X rating and would make history by being the only X-rated feature to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Both Voight and co-star Hoffman were nominated for Best Actor, but lost out to John Wayne in'' True Grit.''

1970s

In 1970, Voight appeared in Mike Nichols' adaptation of _Catch-22_, and re-teamed with director Paul Williams to star in _The Revolutionary_, as a left wing college student struggling with his conscience.

Voight next starred in 1972's _Deliverance._ Directed by John Boorman, from a script that poet James Dickey had helped to adapt from his own novel of the same name, it tells the story of a canoe trip in a feral, backwoods America. Both the film and the performances of Voight and co-star Burt Reynolds received great critical acclaim, and were popular with audiences.

Voight also appeared at the Studio Arena Theater, in Buffalo, New York in the Tennessee Williams play _A Streetcar Named Desire_ from 1973-74 as Stanley Kowalski.

Voight played a directionless young boxer in 1973's _The All American Boy_, then appeared in the 1974 film, _Conrack_, directed by Martin Ritt. Based on Pat Conroy's autobiographical novel _The Water Is Wide_, Voight portrayed the title character, an idealistic young schoolteacher sent to teach underprivileged black children on a remote South Carolina island. The same year he appeared in _The Odessa File_, based on Frederick Forsyth's thriller, as Peter Miller, a young German journalist who discovers a conspiracy to protect former Nazis still operating within Germany. This film first teamed him with the actor-director Maximilian Schell, who acted out a character named and based on the "Butcher of Riga" Eduard Roschmann, and for whom Voight would appear in 1976's _End of the Game_, a psychological thriller based on a story by Swiss novelist and playwright Friedrich Dürrenmatt.

Voight was Steven Spielberg's first choice for the role of Matt Hooper in the 1975 film _Jaws_, but he turned down the role, which was ultimately played by Richard Dreyfuss.[10]

In 1978, Voight portrayed the paraplegic Vietnam veteran Luke Martin in Hal Ashby's film _Coming Home,_ and was awarded Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival, for his portrait of a cynical, yet noble paraplegic, reportedly based on real-life Vietnam veteran-turned-antiwar-activist Ron Kovic, with whom Fonda's character falls in love. The film included a much-talked-about love scene between the two. Jane Fonda won her second Best Actress award for her role, and Voight won for Best Actor in a Leading Role.[11]

In 1979, Voight once again put on boxing gloves, starring in 1979's remake of the 1931 Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper vehicle, _The Champ,_ with Voight playing the part of an alcoholic ex-heavyweight and a young Ricky Schroder playing the role of his adoring son. The film was an international success, but less popular with American audiences.

1980s

He next reteamed with director Ashby in 1982's _Lookin' to Get Out_, in which he played Alex Kovac, a con man who has run into debt with New York mobsters and hopes to win enough in Las Vegas to pay them off. Voight both co-wrote the script and also co-produced. He also produced and acted in 1983's _Table for Five_, in which he played a widower bringing up his children by himself.

Also in 1983, Voight was slated to play Robert Harmon in John Cassavetes' Golden Bear-winning _Love Streams_, having performed the role on stage in 1981. However, a few weeks before shooting began, Voight announced that he also wanted to direct the picture and was consequently dropped.[12]

In 1985, Voight teamed up with Russian writer and director Andrei Konchalovsky to play the role of escaped con Manny Manheim in _Runaway Train_. The script was based on a story by Akira Kurosawa, and paired Voight with Eric Roberts as a fellow escapee. Voight received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and won the Golden Globe's award for Best Actor. Roberts was also honored for his performance, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

Voight followed up this and other performances with a role in the 1986 film, _Desert Bloom_, and reportedly experienced a "spiritual awakening" toward the end of the decade. In 1989 Voight starred in and helped write _Eternity,_ which dealt with a television reporter's efforts to uncover corruption.

1990s

He made his first acting debut into television movies, acting in 1991's _Chernobyl: The Final Warning_, followed by _The Last of his Tribe_, in 1992. He followed with 1992's _The Rainbow Warrior_ for ABC, the story of the ill-fated Greenpeace ship sunk by French operatives in the Auckland Harbour. For the remainder of the decade, Voight would alternate between feature films and television movies, including a starring role in the 1993 miniseries _Return to Lonesome Dove_, a continuation of Larry McMurtry's western saga, 1989's _Lonesome Dove_. Voight played Captain Woodrow F. Call, the part played by Tommy Lee Jones in the original miniseries. Voight made a cameo appearance as himself on the _Seinfeld_ episode "The Mom & Pop Store" airing November 17, 1994, in which George Costanza buys a car that appears to be owned by Jon Voight. Voight described the process leading up to the episode in an interview on the Red Carpet at the 2006 BAFTA Emmy Awards:



        Well what happened was I was asked to be on Seinfeld. They said: "Would you do a Seinfeld?" And I said, and I just happened to know to see a few Seinfelds and I knew these guys were really tops; they were really, really clever guys, and I liked the show. And so I said "Sure!" and I thought they would ask me to do a walk-on, the way it came: "Would you come be part of the show?" And I said "Yeah, sure I'll do it." You know what I mean? Then I got the script and my name was on every page because it was about my car. And I laughed; it was hysterically funny. So I was really delighted to do it. The writer came up to me and he said "Jon, would you come take a look at my car to see if you ever owned it?", because the writer wrote it from a real experience where someone sold him the car based on the fact that it was my car. And I went down and I looked at the car and I said "No, I never had this car." So unfortunately I had to give him the bad news. But it was a funny episode.[13]

In 1992, Voight appeared in the HBO film _The Last of His Tribe_.[14]

In 1995, Voight played the role of "Nate", a fence in the film, _Heat_, directed by Michael Mann, and appeared in the television films _Convict Cowboy,_ and _The Tin Soldier,_ also directing the latter film.

Voight next appeared in 1996's blockbuster film _Mission: Impossible_, directed by Brian De Palma and starring Tom Cruise. Voight played the role of spymaster James Phelps, a role originated by Peter Graves in the television series.

In 1997, Voight appeared in six films, beginning with _Rosewood_, based on the 1923 destruction of the primarily black town of Rosewood, Florida, by the white residents of nearby Sumner. Voight played John Wright, a white Rosewood storeowner who follows his conscience and protects his black customers from the white rage. Voight next appeared in _Anaconda_. Set in the Amazon, Voight played Paul Sarone, a snake hunter obsessed with a fabled giant anaconda, who hijacks an unwitting National Geographic film crew looking for a remote Indian tribe. Voight next appeared in a supporting role in Oliver Stone's _U Turn_, portraying a blind man. Voight took a supporting role in _The Rainmaker_, adopted from the John Grisham novel and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. He played an unscrupulous lawyer representing an insurance company, facing off with a neophyte lawyer played by Matt Damon. His last film of 1997 was _Boys Will Be Boys_, a family comedy directed by Dom DeLuise.

The following year, Voight had the lead role in the television film _The Fixer_, in which he played Jack Killoran, a lawyer who crosses ethical lines in order to "fix" things for his wealthy clients. A near-fatal accident awakens his dormant conscience and Killoran soon runs afoul of his former clients. He also took a substantial role in Tony Scott's 1998 political thriller, _Enemy of the State,_ in which Voight played Will Smith's character's stalwart antagonist from the NSA .

Voight was reunited with director Boorman in 1998's _The General_. Set in Dublin, Ireland, the film tells the true-life story of the charismatic leader of a gang of thieves, Martin Cahill, at odds with both the police and the Provisional IRA. Voight portrays Inspector Ned Kenny, determined to bring Cahill to justice.

Voight next appeared in 1999's _Varsity Blues_. Voight played a blunt, autocratic football coach, pitted in a test of wills against his star player, portrayed by James Van Der Beek. Produced by fledgling MTV Pictures, the film became a surprise hit and helped connect Voight with a younger audience.

Voight played Noah in the 1999 television production _Noah's Ark_, and appeared in _Second String,_ also for TV. He also appeared with Cheryl Ladd in the feature _A Dog of Flanders_, a remake of a popular film set in Belgium.

2000s

Voight next portrayed President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 2001's action/war film _Pearl Harbor_, having accepted the role when Gene Hackman declined (his performance was received favorably by critics). Also that year, he appeared as Lord Croft, father of the title character of _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider_.[15] Based on the popular video game, the digital adventuress was played on the big screen by Voight's own real-life daughter Angelina Jolie.

That year, he also appeared in _Zoolander_, directed by Ben Stiller who starred as the title character, a vapid supermodel with humble roots. Voight appeared as Zoolander's coal-miner father. The film extracted both pathos and cruel humor from the scenes of Zoolander's return home, when he entered the mines alongside his father and brothers and Voight's character expressed his unspoken disgust at his son's chosen profession.

Also in 2001, Voight joined Leelee Sobieski, Hank Azaria and David Schwimmer in the made-for-television film _Uprising_, which was based on the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto.

In 2009, Voight played Jonas Hodges, the American antagonist, in the seventh season of the hit Fox drama _24_, a role that many argue is based on real life figures Alfried Krupp, Johann Rall and Erik Prince. Voight plays the chief executive officer of a fictional private military company based in northern Virginia called _Starkwood_, which has loose resemblances to Academi and ThyssenKrupp. Voight made his first appearance in the two-hour prequel episode _24: Redemption_ on November 23. He then went on to recur for 10 episodes of Season 7. He joined Dennis Haysbert as the only two actors ever to have been credited with the "Special Guest Appearance" card on _24_.

2010s

JonVoightHWOFJune2013.jpg In 2013, Voight made his much acclaimed appearance on _Ray Donovan_ as Mickey Donovan, Ray's estranged pseudo-evil crudely charismatic highly persuasively endearing father who brought nothing to his sons' lives but paranoia, neurosis, and disastrous complications. Under the category Television Series, Voight received a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film in 2013.

On March 26, 2019, Jon Voight was appointed to a six year term on the Board of Trustees of the Kennedy Center in Washington DC as reported the next day by the Washington Post and Fox News.


Political views

In his early life, his political views aligned with American liberal views and he supported President John F. Kennedy, describing his assassination as traumatizing to people at that time.[18] He also worked for George McGovern's voter registrations efforts in the inner cities of Los Angeles.[19] Voight actively protested against the Vietnam War.[20] In the 1970s, he made public appearances alongside Jane Fonda and Leonard Bernstein in support of the leftist Unidad Popular group in Chile.[21]

In a July 28, 2008 op-ed in _The Washington Times,_ he wrote that he regretted his youthful anti-war activism, and claimed that the peace movement of that time was driven by "Marxist propaganda". He also claimed that the radicals in the peace movement were responsible for the communists coming to power in Vietnam and Cambodia and for failing to stop the subsequent slaughter of 2.5 million people in the Killing Fields.[22]

In the same op-ed he also criticised the Democratic Party and Barack Obama's bid to become president claiming that the Democrats had created "a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages, creating a God-like figure (Obama)" who would "demoralize this country and help create a socialist America".[23] He claimed Obama had grown up with the teachings of very angry, militant white and black people around him.[24]

In May 2008, Voight paid a solidarity visit to Israel in honor of its 60th birthday. "I'm coming to salute, encourage and strengthen the people of Israel on this joyous 60th birthday", said Voight. "This week is about highlighting Israel as a moral beacon. At a time when its enemies threaten nuclear destruction, Israel heals."[25]

Voight endorsed Republican presidential nominees Mitt Romney and Donald Trump in the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections respectively.[26][27] Speaking at an inauguration rally for Donald Trump in January 2017 Voight said, "God answered all our prayers" by granting Trump the White House. In May 2019, Voight released a short two-part video on Twitter supporting President Trump's policies, and calling him "the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln".[28]


In popular culture

In the _Seinfeld_ episode "The Mom & Pop Store," George Costanza buys a 1989 Chrysler LeBaron thinking it was previously owned by Jon Voight. However Jerry points out that Jon Voight must have misspelled his first name with an "h" in the owners manual for this to be true. Jon Voight appears briefly as himself in the episode and bites Kramer on the arm. By the end of the episode it is revealed that the car was actually owned by a periodontist named John Voight.
