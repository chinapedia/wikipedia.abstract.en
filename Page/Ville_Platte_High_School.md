VILLE PLATTE HIGH SCHOOL (VPHS) is a senior high school in Ville Platte, Louisiana. It is a part of the Evangeline Parish School Board.


History

The school first began in 1908.[1]

Jer√© Longman of _The New York Times_ wrote that the facilities began to deteriorate after racial integration occurred in 1969. By 2008 the school received upgrades to its computer laboratory and library and a new metal roof, along with other items within $2.4 million with of repairs and improvements. In 2008 the school had about 400 students. That year Longman stated that the classrooms were "no longer considered safe".[2] The State of Louisiana had given the school failing marks, and under No Child Left Behind it was considered failing.[3]

On November 4, 2008 Evangeline Parish voters opted not to accept a property tax increase that would construct a new facility for the school. The United States Justice Department accused the parish's remodeling efforts of being inadequate and sought the school's closure. Toni Hamlin, the superintendent of the parish school system, argued that the district had completed the renovations mandated by the 2004 federal school reorganization plan.[4]


Demographics

the school's student body was mostly black; while the town was about 60% black and 40% white many of the white residents did not send their kids to this school.[5]


Athletics

In 2006 Longman stated that the athletic facilities were "run-down" with a track that had its rubberized surface worn out, a basketball court not of regulation sizes.[6]

Sacred Heart High School and Ville Platte High, since 2000, regularly play each other in the Tee Cotton Bowl. Longman stated that this game was created as a " unifying civic gesture".[7]
