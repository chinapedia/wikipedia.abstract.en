The CHISHI BRIDGE () is a bridge carrying the G76 Xiamenâ€“Chengdu Expressway over a deep valley.[1][2][3][4] At the longest span is longer than France's Millau Viaduct, which has a similar structure, but is longer and higher than the Chishi Bridge.

On June 10, 2017, _The New York Times_ offered the Chishi Bridge as an example of one of China's many troubled bridge projects.[5] They reported that the bridge's construction was significantly delayed, and went fifty percent over budget. The total cost of the project was US$300 million[6].In addition, they reported that, once complete, the bridge was under-used, because the toll, equivalent to $3 USD, was too expensive for locals.

The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge project has also encountered problems, falling years behind schedule and reportedly more than tripling its original CNY37.5 billion budget. As of April, nine workers had died, with local media estimating more than 600 injuries. Austin Williams, senior lecturer at Kingston University, has stated that the talent needed to execute the project has not kept up with the pace and that workers are entering the infrastructure sector with low technical skills.[7]
