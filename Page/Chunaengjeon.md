CHUNAENGJEON or DANCE OF SPRING NIGHTINGALE (춘앵전) is a Korean court dance (_jeongjae_) created during the later period of Joseon Dynasty.[1][2][3]


History

The oldest document providing brief information about Chunaengjeon is Jinchan Uigwe (_Manual of Court Banquet_) published in 1848.[4] According to Jinchan Uigwe text, Chunaengjeon have existed in Joseon court since 1649, but only then under Crown Prince Hyomyeong's tutelage it was revised and perfected. The dance was presented to 40th birthday Queen Sunwon in 1828. Jinchan Uigwe wrote that the Korean Chunaengjeon originated from a Chinese nightingale dance which was created by Tang Gaozong's court musician.[5]

It is written :

The manual of 1828 did not contain dance choreography.[6] Both 1829 and 1848's Uigwes also provided same information. The first book that contained the dance choreography was _Manual of Court Dance_ (_"Jeongjae Mudo Holgi"_) of 1893. It comprised the choreography of 37 Chinese and Korean dances in the form of manuscript. During Japanese occupation of Korea, court dance was banned. Therefore, only five court dances originally inherited; Cheoyongmu, Mugo, Pogurak, Geommu, and Chunaengjeon. Eventually, court dances were performed in entertainment house (_gyobang_).

One of the last original skill holder of Chunaengjeon was Kim Cheon-heung (1909-2007).[7] At the age of 15 he performed Chunaengjeon in front of Emperor Sunjong. During period of Japanese occupation, he only focused on preserving traditional music. After Korean independence in 1945, he began to revive the dance in Yi Wang-jik Court Music Association.


Characteristics

Chunaengjeon is the only solo Korean court dance.[8] It shares the same basic pattern and movement with other court dances. Among Joseon court dances it is praised as "the flower of court dance".

The most important movement is _hwajeontae_, when the dancer imitates bird perching on flower by put the colorful sleeves at the back and smiles.[9] This is a movement hard to find in other court dances and the highlight of the dance. The quality of smile decides the quality of the dancer.

The dancer dances on a floral-pattern mat (_hwamunseok_) with defined and controlled steps.[10] The costume is called yellow _aengsam_. The headdress can be lotus coronet for male dancer and jokduri for female dancer. Another peculiarity is they are not wearing shoes, only with traditional socks _beoseon_. Court music piece _pyeongjo hoesang_ is played to accompany the dance.
