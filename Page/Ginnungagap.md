In Norse mythology, GINNUNGAGAP ("gaping abyss", "yawning void") is the primordial void, mentioned in the Gylfaginning, the Eddaic text recording Norse cosmogony.


Etymology

_Ginnunga-_ is usually interpreted as deriving from a verb meaning "gape" or "yawn", but no such word occurs in Old Norse except in verse 3 of the Eddic poem "Vǫluspá", "gap var ginnunga", which may be a play on the term. In her edition of the poem, Ursula Dronke suggested it was borrowed from Old High German _ginunga_, as the term Múspell is believed to have been borrowed from Old High German.[1] An alternative etymology links the _ginn-_ prefix with that found in terms with a sacral meaning, such as _ginn-heilagr_, _ginn-regin_ (both referring to the gods) and _ginn-runa_ (referring to the runes), thus interpreting _Ginnungagap_ as signifying a "magical (and creative) power-filled space".[2]


Creation myth

Ginnungagap appears as the primordial void in the Norse creation account. The _Gylfaginning_ states:

In the northern part of Ginnungagap lay the intense cold of Niflheim, and in the southern part lay the equally intense heat of Muspelheim. The cosmogonic process began when the effulgence of the two met in the middle of Ginnungagap.


Geographic rationalization

Scandinavian cartographers from the early 15th century attempted to localise or identify Ginnungagap as a real geographic location from which the creation myth derived. A fragment from a 15th-century (pre-Columbus) Old Norse encyclopedic text entitled _Gripla_ (Little Compendium) places Ginnungagap between Greenland and Vinland:

A scholion in a 15th-century manuscript of Adam of Bremen's _Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum_ similarly refers to _Ghimmendegop_ as the Norse word for the abyss in the far north.[3]

Later, the 17th-century Icelandic bishop Guðbrandur Thorlaksson also used the name _Ginnungegap_ to refer to a narrow body of water, possibly the Davis Strait, separating the southern tip of Greenland from _Estotelandia, pars America extrema_, probably Baffin Island.[4]


In popular culture

Ginnungagap is featured in the Marvel Universe, which existed before the formation of the world. In this place were formed entities such as the Elder Gods,[5][6] Xian,[7] Ennead,[8] Frost Giants, Fire Demons,[9] Nyx[10] and Amatsu-Mikaboshi.[11]
