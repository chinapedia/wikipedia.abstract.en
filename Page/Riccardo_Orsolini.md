RICCARDO ORSOLINI (born 24 January 1997) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a winger for Serie A club Bologna.


Club career

Orsolini is a product of Ascoli's youth academy. He made his debut with the first team in the 2015–16 season in Serie B, obtaining 9 appearances in the league.

On 30 January 2017, Orsolini joined Juventus on a contract until June 2021, for a fee of €6 million, plus an extra €4 million dependent on certain conditions.[1]

On 14 July 2017, Orsolini joined Atalanta on a two-year loan.[2]

Orsolini moved back to Juve and then on loan to Bologna FC in a January 2018 after making just substitute appearances for Atalanta. The loan is for 18 months with an option to buy.[3] On 19 June 2019, Orsolini signed a deal with Bologna and signed the club on permanent basis.[4]


International career

With the Italy U-20 side, Orsolini took part at the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup, and led the tournament in goals, scoring five, as Italy finished the competition in third place, their best ever result.[5][6] Due to his prolific performances, he was named by many in the media as the outright best player on the Italian side.[7]

He made his debut with the Italy U21 team on 1 September 2017, in a friendly match lost 3–0 against Spain.


Style of play

Orsolini is a physically strong and fast-paced winger, who excels in one on one situations due to his excellent dribbling ability. Although he is naturally left-footed, he prefers to play on the right flank, in either a 4–3–3 or 4–2–3–1 formation, a position which allows him to cut into the centre and shoot on goal with his stronger foot.[8][9][10]
