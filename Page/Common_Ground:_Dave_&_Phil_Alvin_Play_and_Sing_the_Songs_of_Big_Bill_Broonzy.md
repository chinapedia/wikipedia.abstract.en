_COMMON GROUND: DAVE & PHIL ALVIN PLAY AND SING THE SONGS OF BIG BILL BROONZY_ is a studio album by folk rock musicians Dave and Phil Alvin, released in 2014.


Reception

Writing for Allmusic, music critic Mark Deming wrote of the album "while listening to this is a potent reminder of how good Broonzy's songs still sound in the 21st century, it also demonstrates the complementary talents of Dave and Phil Alvin... It's clear the Alvins love this music and know how to mess with it in just the right way, and they don't treat Broonzy's tales of all manner of wild living like museum pieces, but as vital, living bits of American music, and that's how they sound on this album."[1]
