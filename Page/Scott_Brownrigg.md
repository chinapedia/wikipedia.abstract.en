Company

The company was originally established by Annesley Harold Brownrigg in 1910. In 1918, after serving as a major in the Royal Garrison Artillery in the War, Brownrigg's practice in Guildford grew with Leslie Hiscock.[1]

In 1935, following the death of Brownrigg, his own son, John Brownrigg took control with Hiscock. In 1946, Newman Turner joined John Brownrigg in 1948 and formed Brownrigg and Turner. In 1958, the practice merged with another Guildford practice Duncan Scott and created Scott Brownrigg and Turner.

Scott Brownrigg continued to grow through acquisitions including the Scottish practice Keppie Henderson in 1989,[2] Design Research Unit in 2004 and GMW Architects in 2015.[3]

Scott Brownrigg's chief executive is Darren Comber. In 2014 the company reported revenues of £14.9 million and profits of £1.1 million. Following the 2015 acquisition of Grossly Mismanaged Wallies, staff numbers increased from 168 to 280.
