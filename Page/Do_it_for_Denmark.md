DO IT FOR DENMARK is a Danish media and advertising campaign designed to increase the birth rate of the nation. The campaign, launched by the Danish travel agency Spies Rejser, is envisioned as a way to stop the population decline present in Denmark. Following the implementation of the campaign in 2014, the Danish birth rate increased.[1][2][3][4]

The advertising campaign has been criticized for invoking age-related and gendered stereotypes. The "Do it for Denmark" and subsequent "Do it for Mom" ads have been accused of carrying "explicit heteronormative and ageist tones" that "reflect a pro-natal and youth-oriented culture."[5]
