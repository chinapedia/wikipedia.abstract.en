_MAIL ORDER FAMILY_ was a television comedy television series by writer-producer Jackie Clarke, director-executive producer Ruben Fleischer and executive producer David Bernad, that was cancelled without an episode even being made. The show was pitched to NBC was meant to revolve around "a widowed single father who orders a mail-order bride from the Philippines to help raise his two preteen daughters."[1]

The story, based on Clarke's real life experiences with her step-mother, was previously an online web animated series, and covered in a segment on the radio show This American Life.[2]


Reception

The announcement resulted in criticism from Asian American community bloggers and commentators about the show making light of human trafficking and sexual exploitation.[3][4]

On September 30, 2016, NBC announced, “We purchased the pitch with the understanding that it would tell the creator’s real-life experience of being raised by a strong Filipina stepmother after the loss of her own mother... The writer and producers have taken the sensitivity to the initial concept to heart and have chosen not to move forward with the project at this time."[5][6][7][8]
