Father EUZEBIUSZ HUCHRACKI, O.F.M., (October 15, 1885 – May 6, 1942) was a Polish Franciscan friar, superior of the monastery in Miejska Górka, chaplain of the Secular Franciscan Order, who shortly after the Nazi invasion of Poland was arrested by the Gestapo, imprisoned at several places of detention, and lastly deported to the Dachau concentration camp, and murdered.[1]

Franciscan Euzebiusz Huchracki is currently one of the 122 Polish martyrs of the Second World War who are included in the beatification process initiated in 1994, whose first beatifica­tion session was held in Warsaw in 2003 (see _Słudzy Boży_). A person nominated for beatification receives within the Roman Catholic Church the title of "Servant of God"; once he is ac­tu­al­ly beatified he is accorded the title of "Venerable" and "Blessed", which are a prerequisite for sainthood conferred in a process known as canonization.[2]
