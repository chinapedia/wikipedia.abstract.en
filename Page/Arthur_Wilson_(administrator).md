ARTHUR J. WILSON is an Australian administrator and historian who is currently the chairman of the Fitzroy–Brisbane Lions Historical Society. He has been involved with Fitzroy and its successor, the Brisbane Lions, for more than 40 years.[1]


Fitzroy involvement

Wilson was a mascot in the 1944 Grand Final, in which Fitzroy won its last VFL premiership.[2] He unofficially joined the club in 1965, and officially joined the Fitzroy General Committee in 1968. He remained on the Committee until 1978, and was the Recruiting manager in 1979.[3] His recruiting has been described as "important" to the club's success in the 1980s.[4] From 1980 to 1985 he was the club's secretary,[5] and he had his last official stint at the club from 1986 to 1990, as the Football Manager.


Fitzroy–Brisbane Lions Historical Society

In 1997, after the merger between Fitzroy and the Brisbane Bears to create the Brisbane Lions, Wilson founded the Fitzroy–Brisbane Lions Historical Society with George Coates, creator of Fitzroy's logo. He was the president of the Society from 1997 to 2010, and is currently the chairman. He helped found a Fitzroy museum at Docklands Stadium.[6]


Honours

Wilson was one of eight inducted into the Brisbane Lions Hall of Fame in 2016.[7] He was the first non-player or coach inducted. He is also a Brisbane Lions Life Member and a member of the Fitzroy–Brisbane Lions Past Players and Officials Association Hall of Fame.
