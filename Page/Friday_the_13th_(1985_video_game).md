_FRIDAY THE 13TH: THE COMPUTER GAME_ is the first game adaptation based on the films of the same name. It was released in 1985[1][2] by Domark[3] for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum.[4][5] The game was released on floppy diskette and cassette tape. The player's goal is to find and kill Jason, while making sure his friends or he himself are not killed by Jason.[6]


Gameplay

The player can roam around freely in the scenery, walk in and outside of buildings. Jason, as well as other characters, do the same. It is the player's task to make sure his friends do not get killed by Jason, who often appears disguised as one of them,[7] unless he is hit once and becomes visible as a man dressed in black.[8] Various improvised weapons (e.g., chainsaw, pitchfork, machete, etc.)[9] are scattered around the camp and various buildings (e.g., a barn, a church, a cabin), picked up, and used to confront Jason.[10] There are five levels in the game and each time you play as another character. The character assignment is random at the start of the round.[11][12] The game uses an early pseudo-3D view along with a more traditional side view, depending on the character's location.[13] The game also features a "fear meter", in the form of a blonde woman's head with hair standing on end, to symbolize the players level of fright at the time, and a change in the situation.[14][15] Unlike the later Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) title, the game included scenes of gore consistent with the film franchise.[16] For example, when a character is killed by Jason, sometimes there is a scream followed by a quick cut to a graphic image of a head with a machete slicing into said.[17][18][19][20] A similar startle effect would be used in the 1989 title _Project Firestart_.[21]


Reception

The game's main appeal was the obvious horror elements, which included atmospheric music and digitized screams.[22] [23] Some criticized that it changed elements from the franchise, such as Jason being dressed all in black,[24] which has nothing in common with his appearance from the movies.[25]

The game received otherwise negative review, regardless of the platform. _Zzap!64_ gave it 13%,[26] _Your Sinclair_ gave it 3/10, _Crash_ 3/10 and _Sinclair User_ 4/10.[27]
