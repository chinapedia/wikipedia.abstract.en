MANSING RONGPI is an Bharatiya Janata Party politician from Assam. He was elected in Assam Legislative Assembly election in 2016 from Baithalangso as a candidate from the Indian National Congress party.[1][2][3]

Mansing decided to leave the Congress Party in 2016 to run separately for his new party. This was a major shock and a huge gain for the Bharatiya Janata Party.
