The vegetation is mainly _restinga_ salt marsh, with shrubs and thickets. There are mangroves and many bromeliads and orchids. There is an endemic lizard named _Cnemidophorus nativo_.

The reserve is threatened by construction on private properties, which cover most of the reserve, and by Buffalo incursions.

History

On 15 May 2006 the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) began public consultations on the proposed creation of the Rio dos Frades and Una wildlife refuges, as well as the proposed expansion of the Pau-Brazil and Descobrimento national parks and of the Una Biological Reserve.

The Rio dos Frades Wildlife Refuge was created by federal decree on 21 December 2007 with the basic objective of preserving natural ecosystems of great ecological relevance and scenic beauty, enabling scientific research, education and environmental interpretation and supporting recreation in contact with nature. It is classed as IUCN protected area category III (natural monument or feature). It is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation. It became part of the Central Atlantic Forest Ecological Corridor, created in 2002.

The consultative council was created on 21 July 2011. The consultative council included representatives of ICMBio and landowners, but the landowners were not actively participating due to lack of interest. As of 2014 the reserve had no management plan and was therefore not open to visitors.
