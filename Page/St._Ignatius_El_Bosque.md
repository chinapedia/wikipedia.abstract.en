ST. IGNATIUS EL BOSQUE (_Colegio San Ignacio El Bosque_ â€“ SIEB) is a primary and secondary school in the Providencia area of Santiago, Chile, founded by the Society of Jesus in 1956.


History

In 1931, the Society of Jesus acquired ten blocks of land in the Providencia district, intending to build a stadium where school students from St. Ignatius College, Alonso de Ovalle, could play sports. In 1935 while the stadium was being built, a modern boarding school was built on the premises. The stadium, meanwhile, was opened in 1936. The new building was never used as a boarding school since the one at Alonso Ovalle was closed in 1954. In that year the work on the current Lecaros campus progressed with the idea of taking the preparatory school to the new premises. In 1960, the two schools were separated. The secondary school became Colegio San Ignacio El Bosque.

On 7 March 2016 there was a change of command in the establishment, with Jorge Radic becoming the second lay rector of St. Ignatius El Bosque, and the first one in more than 40 years. He replaced Ismael Aracena.[1]
