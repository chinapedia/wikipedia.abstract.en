History

Robert Miller was a staple of the Boston music scene in the 1970ʼs at a time when jazz fusion acts such as Weather Report, Return To Forever, Mahavishnu Orchestra and others were performing. His personal fusion band (which included Anton Fig of David Letterman fame)[2] performed with Gary Burton, Sonny Stitt, and Jaki Byard, among others, and played steadily at all the Boston area clubs.[3][4][5]

In the 1990s Robert formed 32 Records with Joel Dorn. 32 Records bought the Muse Records jazz catalog and proceeded to reissue several hundred recordings in new combinations and with new art work and liner notes.[6] Among the releases was the “Jazz For….” series, starting with “Jazz For A Rainy Afternoon”. This series went on to have the top 4 albums on the Billboard Top Jazz Albums chart in April 1999, "a feat never before accomplished by any record label."[7]

In the mid 1990ʼs Robert formed The Robert Miller Group. Their first album, “Childʼs Play” (1994), contained Robertʼs first original compositions and featured guest artists Al Foster (Miles Davis), Randy Brecker (Brecker Brothers), Tony “Thunder” Smith (Lou Reed), Anton Fig and Jon Lucien. The band went on to record a second album, "Prisoner's Of Love" (1996) and to play at several music festivals including the Telluride Jazz Celebration and the San Bernardino Jazz Festival (alongside Bruce Hornsby, War and Bela Fleck).

In 2007 Robert put together Project Grand Slam in New York City. PGS's first two CDs, “Play” (2008) and “Spring Dance” (2012), had three top radio singles[8][9] – “The Captain Of Her Heart” (feat. Judie Tzuke on vocals)[10] from Play, and “Catch You Later” and the title song from Spring Dance. In 2009 the band and Robert also had a featured role in an episode of the hit NBC-TV series “Lipstick Jungle” starring Brooke Shields and Kim Raver, with five of Robert's songs featured in the soundtrack and Robert having a speaking part.[11][12]

In 2015 Robert re-formed PGS with an entirely new lineup. In September of that year PGS released its third album – “Made In New York”. The album featured two singles, “New York City Groove”, a song penned by Robert as a celebration of his NYC home, and “Fire”, Robert's reimagined version of the Jimi Hendrix classic.[13] Both singles featured 2013 “The Voice” semi-finalist Kat Robichaud on vocals.[14][15]

The band's fourth album _The Queenʼs Carnival_ (CEN/Sony Music), was released in August 2016, and features nine original tunes written by Robert and a reimagined cover of The Kinks’ “You Really Got Me” (feat. Lucy Woodward on vocals).[16] Dave Davies, guitarist and co-founder of The Kinks, has publicly praised PGS’s version of the song.[17] The Official and Live videos of the tracks from this album have been viewed over 500,000 times to date.

In 2016 and 2017 PGS has shared the stage with artists including Mindi Abair, Boney James[18] (twice), YES and Scott Weiland (formerly of Stone Temple Pilots),[19] and performed at major venues including the Bergen Performing Arts Center, Ridgefield Playhouse, F.M. Kirby Performing Arts Center,[20] Gramercy Theater, and Garcia’s at The Capitol Theater, while also performing at major clubs including The Blue Note, The Cutting Room,[21] Iridium[22] and a continuing a monthly residency at The Groove and Ashford & Simpson's Sugar Bar.[23]

No Depression has praised "The Queen's Carnival" as “a uniquely affecting work…impossibly memorable!”.[24] Stylistically the band draws influences from artists including Jimi Hendrix,[25] The Kinks,[26] and styles including Afro-Cuban rhythms and Celtic Folk. The band has also covered notable classic rock songs including Jimi Hendrix’s ‘Fire’[27] and The Kinks’ ‘You Really Got Me’.[28][29]

In early 2017 PGS recorded five new tracks including three new originals by Robert and reimagined covers of "Free" by Phish and "I'm So Glad" by Cream. The band plans to release these tracks as part of a forthcoming album.

In 2017 Robert was profiled in Downbeat [30][31] and Bass Musician.
