Homeless_bed.jpg, Sweden, 2013.]] HOMELESSNESS IN SWEDEN affects some 34,000 people.[1][2]

The Swedish government's response to homelessness has included commissioning national surveys on homelessness during the last decade that allow for direct comparison between Sweden, Denmark and Norway.[3] The three countries have very similar definitions of homelessness, with minor variations.[4]

Some researchers maintain that measures to counteract homelessness in Sweden are largely dependent on a general premise equating homelessness with addiction, mental illness and deviance.[5] On the other hand, youth homelessness is considered a child protection problem.[6]


Street newspapers

Situation_Sthlm_vendor_Stockholm.jpg There are several street newspapers in Sweden. _Situation Sthlm_,[7] was founded in 1995 and was Sweden's only street newspaper until _Faktum_ and _Aluma_ were founded early in the 2000s.[8]

In 2006 the three street newspapers were awarded the grand prize of Publicistklubben (Swedish Publicists' Association).[9][10]

In 2013, a Swedish tech company created software for the homeless newspaper vendors to accept credit card payments via a mobile app.[11]


In art

In 2015, a Swedish art exhibition at Malmö Konsthall titled “The Alien Within: A Living Laboratory of Western Society” included two homeless people from Romania. The homeless people were not accepting money from visitors but were paid at hourly rate by the event organizers.[12]


Health

Researchers have found that excess mortality among homeless men and women in Stockholm is entirely related to alcohol and drug abuse.[13]

Some researchers have conducted studies on the oral health of homeless people in Sweden and found that they have fewer remaining teeth than the general population.[14]
