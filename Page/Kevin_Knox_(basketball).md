KEVIN DEVON KNOX II (born August 11, 1999) is an American professional basketball player for the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats and attended high school at Tampa Catholic High School.


High school career

Knox attended Tampa Catholic High School in Tampa, Florida. As a junior, he averaged 30.1 points per game, 11.2 rebounds per game, and 2.4 assists while leading the crusaders to regional and district championships and runner-up to the 2016 Florida Class 4A semifinals. In the 2016 summer, he joined his AAU team, E1T1 United on the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League (EYBL) Circuit. On May 14, 2016, Knox scored career high 28 points in a win against All Ohio Red. He averaged 19.6 points per game and 7.6 rebounds per game on the EYBL circuit. As a senior, Knox averaged 28.5 points per game and 11.3 rebounds per game leading Tampa Catholic to a (25–6) record. He played in the McDonald's All-American Game and Jordan Brand Classic. He was a five-star recruit and was regarded as one of the top players in the 2017 class. On May 6, 2017, Knox committed to play basketball at the University of Kentucky, spurning offers from Duke, Florida State, Missouri and North Carolina.[1] He also turned down a professional offer to play in the Chinese Basketball Association as well.


College career

In his freshman season, Knox led the young Wildcats to a 10-8 conference record, finishing 4th in the SEC, but still led the team with 15.9 points per game. As one of the team's only three point shooting threats, he frequently played big minutes, leading Calipari to complain that Knox was playing "too many" minutes as early as December.[2] Despite this, he went to be named to the All-Rookie and First Team All-SEC.[3] The team turned around their fortunes in time to win the SEC tournament, with Knox totaling 18 points and 7 rebounds in the final against Tennessee.[4]

On April 6, 2018, Knox declared for the 2018 NBA draft and hired an agent, foregoing his final three years of college eligibility.[5]
