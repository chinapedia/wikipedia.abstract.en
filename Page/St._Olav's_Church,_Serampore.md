ST.Olav's_Church,_Dr._B.J._Sarani,_Serampore-1.jpg Interior_of_The_Church.jpg ST. OLAVâ€™S CHURCH () is a Catholic church. It is located in Serampore, West Bengal.[1]


History

Locally known as the Danish Church, it was one of the 100 buildings that were constructed by the Danish management between 1755 and 1845, at a time when the town was called Frederiksnagore.[2]

A major restoration project there was rewarded by the 2016 UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Awards[3]


Architecture

The entrance has an open portico of twin columns under a broken-base pediment containing the royal monogram of Christian VII, king of Denmark when the church was consecrated. Above the portico is a bell tower that also contains a clock. One of the church bells is inscribed "Frederiksvaerk 1804", indicating it originated from a Danish factory. The church is flat roofed, inside and out. The church is not particularly Scandinavian, but reflects the designs of contemporary churches in British India, in particular those in Calcutta, which were inspired by contemporaneous designs popular in Britain, such as St. Martin-in-the-Fields in London.[4]
