SOMESHWAR BEACH (Tulu/Kannada :_Someshwara_) is a beach located in Ullal in the city of Mangalore, India.

The name 'Someshwara beach' is derived because of Lord Somanatha temple standing since several centuries on the sea shore.[1]

The golden sands are used for walking or sunbathing. The presence of hidden rocks and currents along this stretch of the coast make this each unsuitable for swimming. The sea claims a number of lives every year as unwary swimmers are dragged by the current.

Close to this beach there is a hill called 'Ottinene Hill'. On reaching the top of this hill there are views of Netravati River merging and disappearing in Arabian Sea. There is lush vegetation and number of medicinal plants that are naturally grown on this hill.[2]


Rudra Paadhe

Someshwara beach is known for large rocks on the beach called _Rudra Shile_ or _Rudra Paadhe, Rudra is Lord Shiva and "Shile"_ or _"Paadhe"_ means rock in _Tulu language_.[3]
