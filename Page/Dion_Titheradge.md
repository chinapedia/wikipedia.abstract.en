DION TITHERADGE (30 March 1889 – 16 November 1934) was an Australian-born actor and writer of revues, plays and screenplays.


Early life

He was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1889, son of the actor George Sutton Titheradge. He was brother of the actress Madge Titheradge.[1]

His early career was as an actor. His first appearance on stage was in 1908 at the Theatre Royal, Newcastle-on-Tyne, in _The Woman of Kronstadt_, and he then toured Australia and New Zealand playing various roles. In 1910 he was a member of Lewis Waller's company, touring with him in the play _Bardelys the Magnificent_.[2]

Titheradge appeared with Waller in September–October 1912 at Daly's Theatre, New York, in _Henry V_. Also in New York, he played Harry Anson in _The Whip_ at the Manhattan Opera House from November 1912 to April 1913; he appeared in _Life_ by Thompson Buchanan at the same theatre from October 1914 to March 1915, and in _The Harp of Life_ by J. Hartley Manners at the Globe Theatre from November 1916 to May 1917.[3][4]


Writer

Writing became important in his subsequent career. Titheradge and Kenneth Duffield, of South Australia, created a successful West End revue in London in 1920 and, before Duffield returned to Australia in 1922, they produced several more revues including _A to Z_, _Puss Puss_, _Snap_ and _Pot Luck_.[5][6]

The song "And Her Mother Came Too", of which he wrote the lyrics, became famous; the music was by Ivor Novello, and it was first heard in _A to Z_, which opened at the Prince of Wales Theatre on 11 October 1921. It was sung by Jack Buchanan.[7][8] Also famous was his sketch "Dinner Napkins" (also known as "Double Damask"), heard in Noel Gay's show _Clowns in Clover_ (1927).[9]

Titheradge wrote many plays.[10] His play _Loose Ends_ was first seen at the Duke of York's Theatre in London from 19 April 1926; it ran for 81 performances, transferring to the Shaftesbury Theatre from 7 June. He directed and appeared in the play in New York; it ran for 40 performances from 1 November 1926 at the Ritz Theatre. It was later (1930) made into a film of the same name.[11][12][13] His play _The Crooked Billet_, a murder mystery, ran for 168 performances from 13 October 1927 at the Royalty Theatre in London, and was made into a film of the same name (1929).[14][15]

He wrote the screenplays for the films _Mr. Bill the Conqueror_ (1932) and _Dangerous Ground_ (1934).[16]


Family

Titheradge married Margaret Ann Bolton in 1909 in New South Wales; their children were Meg and the writer Peter Dion Titheradge (1910–1989).[17][18] They divorced in 1927, and he married the actress Madge Stuart in 1928.[19]

He died in London in 1934.[20]
