TFM-4AS-1 is a dual selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) and 5α-reductase inhibitor.[1][2] It is a potent and selective partial agonist (E_(max) = 55%) of the androgen receptor (IC₅₀ = 30 nM) and inhibitor of 5α-reductase types I and II (IC₅₀ = 2 and 3 nM, respectively).[3][4] TFM-4AS-1 shows tissue-selective androgenic effects; it promotes the accumulation of bone and muscle mass and has reduced effects in reproductive tissues and sebaceous glands.[5] In addition, it does not promote growth of the prostate gland and it antagonizes the actions of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the seminal vesicles.[6] Structurally, TFM-4AS-1 is a 4-azasteroid.[7]
