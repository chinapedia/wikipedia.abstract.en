_SIRODOTIA_ Kylin (1912) is a freshwater red alga which was described by Kylin in 1912. The family Batrachospermaceae belongs to the order Batrachospermales and has six well known genera namely _Batrachospermum_, _Kumanoa_, _Sirodotia_, _Nothocladus_, _Tuomeya_, and _Sheathia_. The morphology of the gametophyte of _Batrachospermum_, _Sirodotia_, _Tuomeya_, and _Nothocladus_ are more are less similar to each other. Necchi and Timothy John Entwisle (1990) proposed to delimit them from Generic level to section level of genus _Batrachospermum_ _Sheathia_ was the member of genus _Batrachospermum_ and recently rose to generic level). Later phylogenetic studies revealed a distinctive genus level of the above with full support in bootstrap analysis[1] (Vis et al., 1998) and _Sirodotia_ has been raised to generic level.[2]


Taxonomic character

Attached, gelatinous gametophytic filaments, up to 17 cm long, with a beaded appearance varying from blue-green to yellow-green. Uniseriate central axis with large, cylindrical cells; 4–6 pericentral producing repeatedly branched fascicles of limited growth. In most species, rhizoid-like cortical filaments from lower side of pericentral cells. Each fascicle cell contains several, ribbon-like, parietal chloroplasts with no pyrenoid. Spermatangia budded off terminal fascicle cells, spherical, colorless, 4–7 µm diam. Little differentiated carpogonial branches with small cells. Carpogonia with broad trichogyne attached off-center to base, latter structure having a definite protrusion. Carposporophyte a branched filament creeping along main axis; carposporangia formed at branch apices. Carpospores germinate into _Chantransia_ (= _Pseudochantransia_) stage, composed of branched, uniserate filaments. Meiosis and monosporangia not observed.[3]

The genus _Sirodotia_ has been recognized by the two important reproductive characters such as asymmetrical carpogonium in the gametophyte and indeterminate/indistinct gonimoblast filament in the carposporophyte.[4][5][6] Further recognition of species inside the genus is done by various distinct characters like morphology of the gametophyte, position of spermatangia, position of the carpogonial branch, gonimoblast filament arising from the side of from carpogonium, and the size of the carpogonium.[7][8][9]
