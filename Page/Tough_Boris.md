_TOUGH BORIS_ is a 1994 Children's picture book by Mem Fox. It is about a pirate who grieves when his parrot dies and a boy who helps him through this difficult time.


Reception

_Booklist_ wrote "This picture book is full of surprises, both in the simple text and in the dramatic underlying story the pictures tell.", but also stated "the design is confusing; the boy appears on the imprint page but then remains hidden until the middle of the book; some kids may be puzzled about where he comes from."[1] The _School Library Journal_ called it "A compelling and entertaining tale of adventure."[2] A _New York Times_ review noted "a rather puny story line." and concluded "Resisting the temptation to reveal everything, author and illustrator instead give imaginative children something much better -- a picture book that luxuriates in pure possibility."[3]

It has also been reviewed by _Kirkus Reviews_,[4] _Publishers Weekly_,[5] and ''The Horn Book Magazine.[6]

It appears on the American Library Association's 1995 Best List.[7]
