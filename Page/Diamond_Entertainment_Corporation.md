DIAMOND ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION (formerly TRANS-ATLANTIC VIDEO and BURGUNDY DIAMOND ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY), doing business as E-DMEC,[1] is an American home video distributor from Walnut, California.


History

DEC was founded in 1985 as Trans-Atlantic Video. At this time, they released only classic cartoons and black-and-white movies. Around 1987 and 1990, TAV changed its name to Burgundy Diamond Entertainment Company and Also Diamond Entertainment Corporation and began releasing more tapes aimed at children, and fewer to adults.

In 1997, DEC began releasing DVDs, though they still continued to release VHS tapes as well. Because of their large library (398 titles on DVD), they were successful in the DVD market as well. DEC opened up a subsidiary, Jewel Products International, which sold children's toys and other small items.

In 2007, DEC was purchased by Rx For Africa, Inc. in a reverse-merger transaction. DEC stopped releasing films after the takeover, but legally remains open to this day.[2]
