JANET MORISON MILLER (1891â€“1946[1]) was the first woman entered on the rolls on the Newfoundland Law Society, in the Dominion of Newfoundland, United Kingdom.


Early life

The youngest daughter of Lewis Miller and Mary Morison, Miller was born in St. John's, Newfoundland on November 12, 1891. She attended Bishop Spencer College, St. John's, where she won the Lord Bishop's Scripture prize and was runner up for the Jubilee Scholarship.[2] Miller studied law in the office of her uncle, Donald Morison, who was Newfoundland's attorney general. In 1910, she petitioned the Law Society to be examined, but the Law Society refused on the grounds that membership was restricted to men.[3]


Law society

At the next annual general meeting of the society, Morison put forward a motion requesting that women be allowed to join the society. His request was refused. However, as an influential member of government, he convinced cabinet to amend the Law Society Act in 1911 to give women the legal right to become members of the legal profession in Newfoundland.[4] In 1913 Miller became a law student in her uncle's firm.

After Eric's death, Janet, together with her mother and her mother-in-law, janet moved to the south of England. She served with the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) of the British Red Cross in the 1st Berkshire Association and also trained as an ambulance driver. After the war, she returned to Newfoundland, but did not return to study law. Instead, she became a leading player in the suffragette movement in the early 1920s, helping to win Newfoundland women the right to vote. On April 30, 1924, she married Andrew H. Murray, a St. John's businessman, and they had one daughter. Janet died at St. John's on April 5, 1946 after a short illness.[7]
