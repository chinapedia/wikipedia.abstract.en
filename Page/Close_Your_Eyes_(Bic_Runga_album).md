_CLOSE YOUR EYES_ is the fifth studio album by New Zealand singer-song writer Bic Runga. The album is made up of ten covers and two original tracks. Upon announcement of the album in October, Runga said: "There are so many songs I've always wanted to cover. I wanted to see if I could not just be a singer-songwriter, but someone who could also interpret songs. In the process, I found there are so many reasons why a cover version wouldn't work, perhaps because the lyrics were not something I could relate to first hand, because technically I wasn't ready or because the original was too iconic. But the songs that all made it on the record specifically say something about where I'm at in my life, better than if I'd written it myself. It was a challenging process, I'm really proud of the singing and the production and the statement".[1]


Critical reception

Henry Oliver from _The Spinoff_ said the album is "excellent", adding "_Close Your Eyes_ is a grab bag of genre, emotion and sound". Oliver deemed the highlight "Close Your Eyes" "with its Stereolab-esque layers of voices and organs."[2]

Shane Gilchrist from the _Otago Daily Times_ gave the album 3 and a half out of 5, saying the album has "peaks and plateaus", praising Kanye West's "Wolves", The Meters' "What'cha Say" and Nick Drake's "Things Behind the Sun".[3]
