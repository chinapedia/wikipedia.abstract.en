The SEPTEMBER 2016 BUDAPEST EXPLOSION occurred on 24 September 2016 when a young man detonated a nail bomb to kill two patrolling police officers. A policeman and a policewoman suffered injuries but survived the attack. After the incident the police chief in charge announced a full-scale investigation and promised to give 10 million HUF to the ones who report the perpetrator. According to Zsolt Molnár, the chairman of the National Security Commission of the Hungarian Parliament, the attack unlikely has anything to do with other terror-related incidents in 2016 in Europe.[1]


Perpetrator

The alleged perpetrator, László Gergely P., was caught on 19 October 2016 by the Counter Terrorism Centre in Keszthely. The 23 years old man is a Hungarian citizen without any kind of criminal antecedents; his father was earlier the mayor of Karmacs, a small village in Zala county. According to prosecutors, he planned to blackmail the Hungarian Ministry of Interior for €1 million.[2]


Trial

The perpetrator's trial started on January 31, 2018.[3] On September 12, he was sentenced to prison for life.[4]
