_EUCALYPTUS DEPAUPERATA_ is a species of mallee that is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has spindly stems with smooth bark, linear to narrow elliptic adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, usually lemon-yellow flowers and conical to cup-shaped fruit. It is most common near Lake King.


Description

_Eucalyptus depauperata_ is a mallee with spindly stems that typically grows to a height of but can be as tall as , and forms a lignotuber. The bark is smooth and pale grey to salmon-brown in colour. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves that are linear to oblong, long and wide on a short petiole. The adult leaves are the same glossy green on both sides, linear to narrowly elliptic, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are borne in leaf axils on a pendulous, flattened, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are spindle-shaped, long and wide, with a blunt horn-shaped operculum that is two or three times as long as the floral cup. Flowering occurs from September to November and the flowers are lemon-yellow, or sometimes pink-red. The fruits are woody, pendulous, conical to cup-shaped capsules that are long and wide on a pedicel long and contain dark brown flattened-ovoid shaped seeds.[1][2][3]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus depauperata_ was first formally described by the botanists Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill in 1992 in the journal _Telopea_. The type specimen was collected by Hill in 1988 near Lake King.[4] The specific epithet (_depauperata_) is a mediaeval Latin word meaning "made poor", referring to the small habit, buds and fruits on this species.[5][6]

This species is part of the _Eucalyptus_ subgenus _Symphyomyrtus_ in the section _Bisectae_ and the subsection _Glandulosae_. It is closely related to _E. eremophila_, _E. incerata_ and _E. tenera_.[7]


Distribution and habitat

This mallee is found on sandplains and lateritic breakaways in the southern Wheatbelt and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia.[8] Its range extends from the southern wheatbelt, with large numbers around Lake King extending south-east to around Munglinup.[9]


Conservation status

_Eucalyptus depauperata_ is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[10]
