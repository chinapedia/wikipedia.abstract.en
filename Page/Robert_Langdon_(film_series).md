The _ROBERT LANGDON_ films are a series of American action-adventure mystery-thriller movies directed by Ron Howard. The films are based on the novels written by Dan Brown, and center around the fictional character of Robert Langdon. Though based on the book series, the films have a different chronological order, and consist of: _The Da Vinci Code_ (2006), _Angels & Demons_ (2009) and _Inferno_ (2016). The film series as a whole has grossed almost $1.5 billion worldwide.


Development

Dan Brown’s novels about Professor Robert Langdon: _Angels & Demons_ (2000), _The Da Vinci Code_ (2003), and _Inferno_ (2013), quickly became international bestsellers, and were soon adapted into films by Columbia Pictures with Ron Howard directing and producing, and Tom Hanks portraying Langdon.

_The Da Vinci Code_ (2006)

A murder inside the Louvre and clues in Da Vinci paintings lead to the discovery of a religious mystery protected by a secret society for two thousand years, which could shake the foundations of Christianity.

_Angels & Demons_ (2009)

Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon continues to work to solve a murder and prevent a terrorist act against the Vatican.

_Inferno_ (2016)

When Robert Langdon wakes up in an Italian hospital with amnesia, he teams up with Dr. Sienna Brooks, and together they must race across Europe against the clock to foil a deadly global plot.


Television

Following the worldwide successes of the first two films,[1][2] Columbia Pictures began development on a film adaptation of _The Lost Symbol_.[3][4] Hanks and Howard were scheduled to return as star and director, with Brian Grazer and John Calley as producers, while a script was collectively co-written by screenwriters Steven Knight,[5] original author Dan Brown,[6] and Danny Strong.[7] By January 2013, the final draft of the script was near completion, with pre-production expected to start later that year.[8] However, in July Sony Pictures announced they would instead adapt _Inferno_ as the next film instead.[9][10]

In June 2019, the project was announced to be re-conceived as a television series tentatively titled _Langdon_. The series will serve as a prequel to the film series, with Daniel Cerone serving as creator, showrunner, chief executive producer, and screenwriter. Dan Brown, Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, Francie Calfo, Samie Falvey and Anna Culp will act as additional executive producers. The show will be a co-production between Imagine Television Studios, CBS Television Studios, and Universal Television Studios and was ordered to series on NBC.

The plot reportedly revolves around a young Robert Langdon, who is hired by the CIA to solve a number of deadly puzzles when his mentor goes missing.[11]

Difference between novels and films

_The Da Vinci Code_

_Angels & Demons_

There are many differences between the novel and the film.[21]

-   In the novel, the papal conclave attracts relatively little public attention. In the wake of the huge international interest in the 2005 election of Pope Benedict XVI, this was judged to be out of date.[22]
-   The character of CERN Director Maximillian Kohler does not appear in the film.
-   The Italian Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca is changed to the Irish Patrick McKenna, portrayed by Ewan McGregor.
-   The Boeing X-33 that takes Langdon from the United States to Geneva and then to Rome is absent in the film.
-   In the novel, Commander Olivetti is the commander of Swiss Guard, and his second in command is Captain Rocher, whereas in the film, Richter is the head of the Swiss Guard.
-   In the novel, the Assassin contacts members of the BBC in order to influence how they present the story of his activities, but this does not happen in the film.
-   The character Leonardo Vetra is named Silvano Bentivoglio in the film, is not related to Vittoria and his death scene is changed.
-   Vittoria is a love interest for Langdon in the novel while there is no attraction present in the film.
-   In the novel Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca is revealed to be the late pope's biological son, in the film he is his adoptive son.
-   In the book, the assassin has Middle Eastern looks whereas in the movie he is portrayed by a Danish actor Nikolaj Lie Kaas . In the film, he is killed by a car bomb, whereas in the book he falls from a balcony at the top of the Castel Sant Angelo and breaks his back on a pile of marble cannonballs which eventually kills him.
-   In the novel, Vittoria is kidnapped, whereas in the film, she follows Langdon almost everywhere. In the book, all four preferiti are killed by the assassin and eventually the high elector, Cardinal Saverio Mortati, is elected as the new pope whereas in the film, the fourth preferito, Cardinal Baggia, is saved by Langdon and is elected the new pope. The high elector, renamed Cardinal Strauss, becomes the Camerlengo to the new pope.
-   In the end, the new Camerlengo hands over Galileo's book to Langdon instead of a Swiss guard handing the 5th brand, the Illuminati diamond (which is also different in the movie and looks like two crossed keys). In the movie before the explosion Langdon doesn't get on the helicopter unlike in the book where he does and right before the explosion jumps out, barely surviving.

_Inferno_

-   In the novel, the Inferno Virus causes sterility in one third of the human population. At the end of the novel it is revealed that the virus was released before the events of the book, as the date given in the video was when the virus would be worldwide, thus searching for its whereabouts was futile.
-   In the novel, Dr. Sienna Brooks intends to prevent the virus from being released and to destroy it as she believes Governments and other organisations will use it as a weapon and at the end of the novel she is offered a position in the WHO in order to address the crisis.
-   In the novel, Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey is not a former romantic interest of Robert Langdon.
