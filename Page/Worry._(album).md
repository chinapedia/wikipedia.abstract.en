_WORRY._ is the second solo album by Jeff Rosenstock. It was released by SideOneDummy Records on October 14, 2016.

The album addresses themes including urban gentrification, economic inequality and police brutality in the United States.[1][2] Its structure has been compared to both _Abbey Road_ and _Short Music for Short People_.[3]

The album was recorded in April and May 2016 at a house in Stinson Beach, California.[4] Much of the album was written shortly after the band's gear was stolen while on tour in 2015.[5]

Jeff Rosenstock toured the album with Hard Girls, Katie Ellen and local acts picked in each city.[6]

Writing for _USA Today_, Nate Scott ranked it the best album of 2016.[7]
