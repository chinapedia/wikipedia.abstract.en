ENDZONE.jpg Each fall, the varsity football teams of Idaho Falls and Skyline High Schools compete in a rival football game called the Emotion Bowl, at Idaho Falls' Ravsten Stadium, which is shared by the two schools. The winning team and its fans traditionally paint the goalposts of the stadium in their school colors (orange for Idaho Falls High School, and blue for Skyline High School) after each Emotion Bowl.[3]
