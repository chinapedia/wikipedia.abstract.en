_DIE INSELN DER WEISHEIT_ (_The Islands of Wisdom_) is a 1922 novel by Alexander Moszkowski that features expeditions to various utopian and dystopian islands that embody various social-political ideas of European philosophy and extrapolates them for their absurdities when they are put into practice.[1]

The novel's "island of technology" Sarragalla anticipates mobile telephones and a thorough mechanization of life.[2]

The satire of utopias also reproduces the society described in Plato's _The Republic_.[3]
