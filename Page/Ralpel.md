History

The ancestors of Ralpel abandoned the village Khuahring and came down to Khuafo village through Chuncung village. The size of the village became bigger and they grew a population of around 500 houses. Once a man from Chuncung village came to fetch rice from the village. No sooner had he started his way back to his village than he was gunned down by the owner of his temporary lodging. Enraged by the incident, Chuncung with the help of Mangkheng and Thlanrawn planned to invade the Khuafo Village. The circulating news soon reached the ears of the Khuafo people, and left the village at around 1820.[1]

Under the sect leader Mr Sertivang, they established a new village Dawn. Another rebellion Khuangli emerged. All the Dawn people fled down to Runzawl (now known as Cherhlun in Mizoram State, India) to take refuge. As a group of people with an unsettled place, who were moving along the range of mountains of the Indo-Burman boundary line, they were enticed by the view of the Dawn Hill and could not banish it from their thoughts. When the revolt of Khuangli came to end, when the flooding stage of the Tiau River was lowering at the end of the rainy season, they immediately came back to Dawn Village. At the time they returned to Dawn, their leaders were Mr Kamthai (Mualcin) and Mr Chawnhmung (Fancun). There were only a few houses in the village. Thanhlira_Tomb.jpg A generation had passed without any conflicts. After that the village leader Mr Sailuai heard that some parts of their land were frequently purloined by the neighbouring Lungler village, and ordered Mr Thanhlira (Tlanglian descendant), the strongest man in the then Thantlang District, and his 8 friends to build a vedette at the location of the present day Ralpel Village. They called the vedette Ralpel and it became an established village. Among the selected sentinels, Mr Thankio (Hlawncheu) who was a descendant of the chief clan, was initially appointed to be the Chief(Bawi) of Ralpel Village but there was disagreement over his appointments and the Dawn Chief Mr Sailuai appointed Mr Satlung (Hlawncheu) instead to be the first Chief of the Ralpel Village. Mr. Thanhlira (Tlanglian) paid a tax of Ks 30/- and 6 hand-spans of copper pot for establishing Ralpel Village. For this reason, he was entitled to different kinds of the contemporaneous village taxes.

The term Ralpel is derived from the two Mizo / Lai words: Ral and Pel. In both Mizo and Lai "ral" means "enemy" and "pel" means "hunting". So the word "Ralpel" in its simplest form would be "Hunting the enemy" or "The place for hunting the enemy". Older people consider Ralpel and Dawn Village as a single-separated village.

The neighboring villages call Ralpel `Leisen`. The origin of this term 'Leisen' is not known, however, the term is believed to be used by these villages because the soil of the Ralpel is mostly red, and hence the term 'Leisen' which literally means 'Red Soil'.

Only one student name Laltanpuia (now Dr.Laltanpuia) could follow higher education. The middle school was discontinued due to lack of teachers and poverty. However the middle school was re-established in 1994 by the then Village President Tluangala with the help of the financial contribution from parents.
