ORESTE MATTIROLO (7 December 1856, in Turin – 3 December 1947, in Turin) was an Italian botanist and mycologist, who specialized in hypogeal fungi.

He studied medicine and sciences at the University of Turin, and from 1879, continued his education at the University of Strasbourg as a pupil of Heinrich Anton de Bary.[1] In 1894 he became an associate professor at the University of Bologna, where he attained a full professorship during the following year. Later on, he served as a professor of botany and director of the botanical gardens at the universities of Florence (1898–1900) and Turin (1900–37).[2]

The mycological genera _Mattirolia_ (Berl. & Bres., 1889) and _Mattirolomyces_ (E.Fisch., 1938) commemorate his name.[3]
