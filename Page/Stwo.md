In 2013, he signed with Los Angeles- and Toronto-based record label HW&W Recordings after meeting Kaytranada and his manager while they were on tour in Paris.

In late 2014, OVO in house producer 40 reached out to Stwo after released the mixtape "92", which was all instrumentals inspired by Drake's "Nothing Was The Same". Steven went on to sign an exclusive deal with 40’s publishing company, Alice Island. [4]
