BEARS TOOTH () is a mountain spire in the Beartooth Mountains in the U.S. state of Montana.[1] The peak is in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness in Custer National Forest, and is adjacent to Beartooth Mountain. Bears Tooth is the namesake for numerous other points in the region and the Beartooth Mountains themselves. Known by the Native American Crow as "Na Piet Say", translated as _bears tooth_, the spire can be seen from the Beartooth Highway.[2]
