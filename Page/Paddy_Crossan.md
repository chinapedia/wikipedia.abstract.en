PATRICK JAMES "PADDY" CROSSAN (1894 â€“ 5 May 1933) was a Scottish professional football defender who played in the Scottish League for Heart of Midlothian.[1][2]


Personal life

Crossan joined Hearts from Arniston Rangers in 1912, aged 18, alongside Willie Wilson.[3] He lodged at Wilson's family home which was very close to the Tynecastle ground. He was powerful and an extremely fast runner, and supplemented his income occasionally by racing under pseudonyms.[4] Crossan was considered by many to be very good looking and it was said that although he could pass a ball, he could not pass a mirror![5]

After the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Crossan enlisted in McCrae's Battalion of the Royal Scots.[6] Around the same time he was selected for the Scottish League XI with teammates Peter Nellies, James Low and Harry Graham.[7]

Once on active service, he was hit in the leg by shrapnel near Bazentin, France on 9 August 1916, during the Battle of the Somme.[8] The leg was marked for amputation but was saved after being operated on by a German POW surgeon.[9] After recovering back in Britain, Crossan was posted to the 4th Battalion to serve in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and he was present during the Battle of Jersusalem.[10] He was posted back to the Western Front in 1918 and was gassed in April that year.[11]

He returned to Hearts after the war and featured in another six full seasons, receiving two benefit games and bringing his total number of competitive appearances to over 300[12] before being release on a free transfer in 1925, aged 31.

After his retirement from football, he opened Paddy's Bar on Rose Street in Edinburgh.[13] Crossan died of tuberculosis in 1933 and was buried in Mount Vernon Cemetery.[14]
