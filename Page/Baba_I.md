BABA I village (Papiakum) is one of the four villages that make up Babessi sub division and one of the thirteen villages of Ngoketunjia division of the North West region of Cameroon. Baba I village is located along the ring road from Bamenda some 50Â km away from Bamenda town on the Bamenda-Nkambe stretch of the ring road just before you reach Bamunka (Ndop town).

In September 2015, floods rendered thousands of villagers homeless after water overflowed its banks. The floods were blamed on the poor construction of part of the ring road without culverts.[1]
