CHAOSIUM INC. is one of the oldest publishers of role-playing games still in existence. Established by Greg Stafford in 1975, its first title was the board game _White Bear and Red Moon_ (later renamed _Dragon Pass_), set in Stafford's fictional fantasy gaming world of Glorantha. Over the years Chaosium has published many acclaimed and award-winning games. These include the roleplaying games _RuneQuest_, set in Glorantha, and _Call of Cthulhu_, based on the stories of H.P. Lovecraft.

While Stafford himself has been described as "one of the most decorated game designers of all time"[1] and "the grand shaman of gaming",[2] many other notable game designers have written material for Chaosium. These include David Conyers, Matthew Costello, Larry DiTillio, David A. Hargrave, Rob Heinsoo, Keith Herber, Jennell Jaquays, Katharine Kerr, Reiner Knizia, Charlie Krank, Robin Laws, Penelope Love, Mark Morrison, Steve Perrin, Sandy Petersen, Ken Rolston, Ken St. Andre, Jonathan Tweet, and Lynn Willis, among others.

One of the very first RPGs by a female lead designer was published by Chaosium: Kerie Campbell-Robson's 1986 release Hawkmoon[3].

LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman's first paid job was as an editor at Chaosium, when he was 12 years old.[4]


History

1975–1980: Early years

Greg Stafford founded "The Chaosium" in 1975 to publish his board game _White Bear and Red Moon_. He derived the name partly from his home, which was near the Oakland Coliseum, combining "coliseum" with "chaos."

In 1978 Chaosium published Steve Perrin's roleplaying game _RuneQuest_, set in Stafford's mythic fantasy setting Glorantha, following up with a second edition in 1980 and various supplements over the next six years.

RuneQuest Products

1980s: Growth and licensing with Avalon Hill

In 1980, the company officially incorporated as Chaosium Inc. That year, Stafford and Lynn Willis simplified the RuneQuest rules into the 16-page Basic Role-Playing (BRP). These simulationist, skill-based generic rules formed the basis of many of Chaosium's later "d100" RPGs, most notably _Call of Cthulhu_, first published in 1982, which has remained a significant hit through subsequent editions.

RuneQuest Products

Chaosium entered into a licensing agreement with Avalon Hill in 1983 to produce a third edition of _RuneQuest_. Avalon Hill manufactured and marketed the game, while Chaosium was responsible for acquisitions, design, development and layout. This relationship was not financially successful for Chaosium, although several high quality and well-received products were produced in a so-called "RuneQuest Renaissance" after Avalon Hill brought acclaimed game designer Ken Rolston on board to manage the line as "Rune Czar".

Late 1990s–early 2010s: Financial struggle

In 1996 it was prematurely reported that Chaosium had secured the rights to publish a collectible card game based on the video game Doom.[5]

In 1998, following the financial failure of the collectable card game _Mythos_, Greg Stafford resigned as Chaosium president and left the company, along with Sandy Petersen (although they both remained shareholders). Chaosium effectively split up into various successor companies, each maintaining its focus on a few of the company's products. Stafford took the rights to his game setting Glorantha, setting up the company Issaries, Inc. to continue publishing this line (later licensing it to Moon Design Publications, along with the game HeroQuest).

Long-time employees and part-owners Charlie Krank and Lynn Willis remained at Chaosium as President and Editor-in-Chief respectively, continuing on with _Call of Cthulhu_ as the main product line. Lynn Willis retired in 2008 due to poor health and died in 2013.

Mid 2010s: The return of Stafford and Petersen

Problems and delays fulfilling the Kickstarters for the 7th edition of _Call of Cthulhu_ led Stafford and Petersen to return to an active role at Chaosium in June 2015.[6] Charlie Krank subsequently left the company.

Later that year at Gen Con 2015, Stafford and Petersen announced Moon Design Publications were now part of the Chaosium ownership, and the four principals of Moon Design (Rick Meints, Jeff Richard, Michael O'Brien and Neil Robinson) had become the new Chaosium management team. Chaosium once again became the licensed publisher for _RuneQuest_, _HeroQuest_ and other products related to Gloranthan universe, and continue to publish the _Call of Cthulhu_ line.[7] Stafford and Petersen remained as board members (Stafford as chair), and creative consultants to the company.

As part of its financial reorganization, the new management closed the company office and warehouse in Hayward, California, ending Chaosium's long association with the San Francisco Bay Area.[8] The company is now based in Ann Arbor, Michigan and uses a fulfillment house model for distribution of product.

Delivery of the core rewards of the Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition Kickstarter finally commenced in April 2016.[9] The new edition went on to win nine of the ten awards it was nominated for at the Gen Con 2017 ENnie Awards.[10]

On April 2, 2019, Chaosium Inc. announced they acquired the rights to the 7th Sea product line (both Second Edition and Khitai Kickstarters) from John Wick, including back stock of books published so far. [11]


Fiction

Chaosium began publishing a line of non-game books (primarily fiction) in 1993. Many titles are themed around H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos and related topics, although the first work published was Greg Stafford's fantasy work _King of Sartar_, set in his mythic world Glorantha.

_Cassilda's Song_, a 2015 anthology based on Robert W. Chambers's King in Yellow and featuring an all-female line up of contributors, was nominated for two 2016 World Fantasy Awards.[12]

In May, 2017, Chaosium appointed award-winning author and editor James Lowder as executive editor of fiction.[13] Lowder had previously served as a consultant for Chaosium, helping the company and freelancers resolve payment and contract problems with past fiction projects.[14]

Although not published by Chaosium, the ongoing Wild Cards series of superhero science fiction originated from a long-running _Superworld_ campaign gamemastered by Game of Thrones author George R. R. Martin and his circle of fellow writers who played in his game.[15]


Magazines

Three magazines have been published by Chaosium to promote its products:

-   _Wyrm's Footnotes_ ran for fourteen issues from 1976 to 1995. Initially it was a supporting material publication for _White Bear and Red Moon_ but for its 11th issue, in 1981, it had become the official _RuneQuest_ magazine.[16] The magazine was revived in 2012 by Moon Design Publications, continuing the issue numbering at 15, despite the 17-year hiatus.
-   _Different Worlds_. Forty-seven bimonthly issues from _Different Worlds_ were published. Chaosium, from 1979 to 1985, published the first thirty-eight and Sleuth Publications, from 1985 to 1987, the final nine. Tadashi Ehara was the editor of the magazine during the periods concerned by both publishing houses.[17]
-   _Starry Wisdom_, a Lovecraft-themed magazine, three issues of which Chaosium published in 1997.[18]
