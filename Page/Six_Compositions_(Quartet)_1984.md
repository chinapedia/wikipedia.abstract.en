_SIX COMPOSITIONS (QUARTET) 1984_ is an album by the American saxophonist and composer Anthony Braxton, recorded in New York in 1984 and released on the Italian Black Saint label.[1]


Reception

The AllMusic review awarded the album 4 stars with Scott Yanow observing, "Anthony Braxton (who on this set plays alto, soprano, C-melody sax, clarinet, and flute) met up with his longtime pianist Marilyn Crispell for the first time on this Black Saint release. With bassist John Lindberg and drummer Gerry Hemingway forming what would be (with Mark Dresser in Lindberg's place) a regular group for nearly a decade, his quartet was off to a strong start. Braxton seems quite comfortable playing this complex music."[2] _The Penguin Guide to Jazz_ singled out Crispell's contributions as being particularly effective.[3]
