A HONEYMOON is a holiday taken by newlyweds immediately after their wedding, to celebrate their marriage. Today, honeymoons are often celebrated in destinations considered exotic or romantic.


History

Upper-class couples would take a "bridal tour", sometimes accompanied by friends or family, to visit relatives who had not been able to attend the wedding.[1] The practice soon spread to the European continent and was known in France as a _voyage à la façon anglaise_ (translation: English-style voyage), from the 1820s onwards.

Honeymoons in the modern sense—a pure holiday voyage undertaken by the couple—became widespread during the _Belle Époque_,[2] as one of the first instances of modern mass tourism. This came about despite initial disapproval by contemporary medical opinion (which worried about women's frail health) and by _savoir vivre_ guidebooks (which referred to the public attention drawn to what was assumed to be the wife's sexual initiation). The most popular honeymoon destinations at the time were the French Riviera and Italy, particularly its seaside resorts and romantic cities such as Rome, Verona, and Venice. Typically honeymoons would start on the night of the marriage, with the couple leaving midway through the reception to catch a late train or ship. However, in the 21st century, many couples will not leave until 1–3 days after the ceremony and reception. In Jewish traditions, honeymoons are often put off seven days to allow for the seven nights of feasting if the visits to friends and family cannot be incorporated into the trip.


Etymology

The honeymoon was originally the period following marriage, "characterized by love and happiness", as attested since 1546.[3] The word may allude to "the idea that the first month of marriage is the sweetest."[4]

According to a different version of the Oxford English Dictionary:

Today, _honeymoon_ has a positive meaning, but originally it may have referred to the inevitable waning of love like a phase of the moon. In 1552, Richard Huloet wrote:

A fanciful 19th-century theory claimed that the word alludes to "the custom of the higher order of the Teutones... to drink Mead, or Metheglin, a beverage made with _honey_, for thirty days after every wedding",[5][6] but the theory is now rejected.[7][8]

In many modern languages, the word for a honeymoon is a calque (e.g., in French: _lune de miel_) or near-calque.

One possible source of the word is from Persian _mah-e-asal,_ which translates to month of honey. The Persian word _mah_ means both moon as well as month, and perhaps during translation the wrong meaning of _mah_ was taken.

Another practical source for the term comes from the early days in the life of a honey bee queen. Immediately after her birth within a hive, a queen bee leaves the hive over the course of several days, to meet up with multiple drones in separate drone congregation areas. She is inseminated with a lifetime of sperm, and then returns to the hive to remain there the rest of her life, laying eggs. The queen essentially goes away for a "honey-moon" and returns, ready to live the rest of her life. The centuries-old practice of beekeeping may have led to other folklore related to this "going away" before starting a life "in the hive" (back at home).


Effects

One 2015 scholarly study concluded that going on a honeymoon is associated with a somewhat lower risk of divorce, regardless of how much or little is spent on the honeymoon itself.[9] However, high spending and incurring significant debt on other wedding-related expenses, such as engagement rings and wedding ceremonies, is associated with a high risk of divorce.[10]


Solomoon or unimoon

An emerging 21st-century travel trend is the "solomoon" or "unimoon", a separate, solo holiday the newlyweds take without their spouse.[11][12] _The New Zealand Herald_ cites a report by _The New York Times_[13] that such alternatives to honeymoons are "particularly suited for couples who just cannot agree on where to go."[14] (This trend contrasts with the use by a jilted bride or groom of the travel reservations intended for the honeymoon, as popularly depicted in such films as _Sex and the City: The Movie_ (2008), wherein Carrie Bradshaw turns her ruined Mexican honeymoon into a girls' trip,[15] and _Like Father_ (2018), wherein a bride left at the altar travels with her absentee father on the cruise meant for her honeymoon.[16])
