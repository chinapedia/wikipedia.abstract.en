RUDOLF ERHARD RIECKE (11 May 1869, in Aschersleben – 15 November 1939, in Leipzig) was a German dermatologist and venereologist.

He studied medicine at the universities of Munich and Halle, receiving his doctorate in 1895. In 1902 he obtained his habilitation for dermatology at the University of Leipzig, and in 1908 became an associate professor. From 1914 onward, he was a professor of dermatology at the University of Göttingen, where in 1932 he was named academic rector. In 1917 he was appointed director of the new university policlinic for skin and venereal diseases.[1][2]

He is remembered for his research of ichthyosis congenita, a disease he classified into three types based on severity (ichthyosis congenita gravis, mitis and tarda).[3][4] In 1900 he published _Über Ichtyosis congenita_ regarding the disorder.[5]
