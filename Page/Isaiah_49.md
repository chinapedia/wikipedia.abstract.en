Second servant song (49:1‚Äì12)

The servant songs were first identified by Bernhard Duhm in his 1892 Commentary on Isaiah. The songs are four poems within the Book of Isaiah written about a certain "servant of YHWH". God calls the servant to lead the nations, but the servant is horribly repressed. In the end, he is rewarded. Those four poems are:

1.  2.  3.  4.  Isaiah 52-53

The second of the "servant songs" begins at Isaiah 49:1, continuing through 49:12. This poem, written from the Servant's point of view, is an account of his pre-natal calling by God to lead both Israel and the nations. The Servant is now portrayed as the prophet of the Lord equipped and called to restore the nation to God. Yet, anticipating the fourth song, he is without success. Taken with the picture of the Servant in the first song, his success will come not by political or military action, but by becoming a light to the Gentiles. Ultimately his victory is in God's hands.[2]

Verse 1

    _Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far;_
    _The LORD hath called me from the womb;_

        _from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name._[3]

-   "Isles" (KJV; NKJV: "coastlands" or "islands") are frequently referred to in _Deutero-Isaiah_ (Isaiah 40‚Äì55). The first reference is in .

Verse 12

    _Behold, these shall come from far:_
    ''and, lo, these from the north and from the west;

        _and these from the land of Sinim._[4]

-   "Sinim" (, __;[5] NIV: "Aswan" based on 'Dead Sea Scrolls'): a word that only found here in the Bible, could be interpreted as "Persia" (Septuagint Greek: , _tes Person_[6]), "the South" (Vulgate Latin: _terra australi_[7]) or even "China" (cf. the English term 'sinologist' comes from the Greek word for 'Chinese'), but the most can be said safely is that verse 12 foresees many converts coming from far distant places, of which 'Sinim' was a notable example.


Comfort for Jerusalem (49:14‚Äì26)

Verse 16

    ''See, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands;
    _Your walls are continually before Me._[8]

Biblical translator and commentator Robert Lowth suggests that there was "some practice, common among the Jews at that time, of making marks on their hands or arms by punctures on the skin, with some sort of sign or representation of the city (i.e. Jerusalem) or temple, to shew their affection and zeal for it".[9]

Verse 22

    _Thus saith the Lord GOD,_

        _Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people:_
        _and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders._[10]
