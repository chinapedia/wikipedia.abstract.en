Personal life

Zanetti went to school in Rothwell to Royds School from which he was expelled and moved to Tinshill Learning Centre until he was 16. Regardless of being expelled, Zanetti claims that he "got on with his work and was in top set for everything", he just wasn't always there and didn't always follow the rules.[2] Zanetti found out he was going to be a dad at the age of 16, which he wasn't prepared for at that age. Zanetti has had many jobs at a young age, which include working in a warehouse, where he made pallets from 6am to 6pm, he was also a butcher, window cleaner, bricklayer and milkman. Zanetti's girlfriend, Lizzie died in a car accident on 10 August 2010.[3] Zanetti has one son, Deaconn born on 11 October 2006,[4][5] who has made an appearance in one of his music videos.[6]
