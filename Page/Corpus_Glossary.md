The CORPUS GLOSSARY is one of many Anglo-Saxon glossaries. Alongside many entries which gloss Latin words with simpler Latin words or explanations, it also includes numerous Old English glossaries on Latin words, making it one of the oldest extant texts in the English language.[1]


History

The manuscript of the Corpus Glossary, Cambridge Corpus Christi College, 144, dates to the 8th century.[2][3] The manuscript in fact contains two glossaries, the first of which is short, and the second of which (fols. 4–64v, to which the name 'Corpus Glossary' usually refers) is much longer. This latter contains almost the full text of the Épinal-Erfurt glossary (deriving independently from the same archetype as the Épinal and Erfurt manuscripts), along with about as much extra material again.[4] It also shares much material with the Leiden Glossary.[5]
