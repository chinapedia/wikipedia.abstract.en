The BEIJING GARRISON HONOR GUARD (), also known as the PLA HONOR GUARD is a ceremonial honor guard and police unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. It is composed of representatives of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The Honor Guard soldiers must be at least 192 cm tall. It performs the Changing of the Guard on Tiananmen Square and the raising of the Flag of China as well (starting 2018). It also greets foreign leaders at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. It has also performed at social events such as the 2008 Summer Olympics 2010 Asian Games in and the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics. It also has marched on Tiananmen square for the 35th, 50th and 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, as well as the Moscow Victory Day Parade in 2015 and the 2017 Pakistan Day parade.[1][2][3]

This honor guard battalion, while reporting directly to the Central Military Commission, falls under the operational control of the Central Theater Command. During parades, the battalion is led by a color guard detail bearing the PLA flag, a tradition which began in 1981.[4]


History

In the 1950s, the battalion was tasked with guarding the Korean War negotiations. The battalion was given the responsibility in May 1977 to raise the national flag on Tiananmen Square. This was among its list of duties until December 1982.[5] Members of the BGHGB raised the Chinese national flag in Hong Kong in 1997 and in Macao in 1999. In December 2017, the BGHGB officially attached the Beijing Garrison Color Guard Company as part of the battalion, formerly under the People's Armed Police, which had been responsible for flag raising ceremonies for 35 years.[6]

Female soldiers in the PLA Honor Guard

On May 13, 2015, 13 female Chinese soldiers who were added to the battalion made their debut during the welcoming ceremony for the President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov of Turkmenistan.[7] Since then, female soldiers have stood shoulder to shoulder with their male counterparts in the battalion on state occasions and in parades. In June 2018, the battalion created a separate female detachment composed of 55 female honor guards from the PLA as a result of the reforms in the ceremony of military honours for foreign leaders. This detachment was first reviewed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kyrgyz President Sooronbay Jeenbekov, and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, during their visits to the capital that month.[8][9][10][11]

Ceremonial uniform

From 1955, the battalion used Chinese made ceremonial uniforms for the first time. They would continue to use these uniforms until June 1, 1965, when they reverted to using regular infantry uniforms for the next 20 years. In 1987, Central Military Commission of China ordered a reform of army uniforms, ordering the battalion ceremonial uniforms once again, and on Oct. 1, 1992, the battalion gained ceremonial sabres.[12]
