ASKERN GREYHOUND STADIUM is a greyhound racing stadium in Selby Road, Askern, near Doncaster, South Yorkshire.

Racing takes place every Wednesday and Friday at 7.15pm with occasional Sunday racing. Facilities include a club room, bar and fast food.[1] It is one of only five independent (unaffiliated to a governing body) tracks remaining today.


Origins

Askern applied for a betting licence during 1938 and it was approved on 15 October 1938. The track was constructed north of Askern on the west side of Selby Road and the east side of the Askern branch of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in an area known as Norton Common.[2]


History

The racing is independent (unaffiliated to a governing body) and is believed to have started in 1939.

In the 1980s the track had a circumference of 350 yards and race over distances of 225, 425m and 600 metres with an 'Inside Sumner' hare system. Described as a tight circuit with a short run to the first bend it had a club house and car park for 100 vehicles.[3]

Today race distances remain as 225, 425 and 600 metres and the track also runs some races for whippets and lurchers.[4]
