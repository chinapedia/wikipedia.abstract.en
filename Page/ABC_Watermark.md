ABC WATERMARK was a radio syndication entity that existed from 1982 until 1995.


History

The company came to be as the result of ABC Radio Networks' purchase of Watermark Inc. from its founders Tom Rounds and Ron Jacobs. The acquisition gave ABC control of Watermark's two major syndication properties, the Casey Kasem and Don Bustany creations _American Top 40_ and _American Country Countdown_. ABC would later launch another show under the _American_ brand, the oldies-themed _American Gold_, in 1991.


Current status

Watermark ceased to exist after the cancellation of _American Top 40_ in 1995; it would later be revived by Kasem in 1998 and is currently distributed by Premiere Radio Networks. _American Country Countdown_ has aired continuously since its premiere and continues to be distributed by ABC successor Cumulus Media, now under the Nash FM brand (it is now hosted by Kix Brooks; longtime host Bob Kingsley now hosts the identically formatted _Country Top 40_). _American Gold_ ended in 2009, with host Dick Bartley now hosting the similarly formatted _Classic Countdown_ for United Stations Radio Networks.
