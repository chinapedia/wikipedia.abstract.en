Redondo began writing literature with short stories and children's stories. In 2009 she published her first novel, _Los privilegios del ángel_, and in January 2013 she published _El guardián invisible_, the first volume of the _Baztán Trilogy_ (). The second part, titled _Legado en los huesos_, followed in November of that year, and it finished in November 2014 with _Ofrenda a la tormenta_.

Works

_El guardián invisible_

The first title of the trilogy[7] begins with the discovery, on the banks of the river Baztán, the naked body of a teenager (Ainhoa Elizasu). The Policía Foral homicide inspector Amaia Salazar is put in charge of the investigation, which leads her to return to Elizondo, the hometown she always wanted to escape from.

The story moves between two fronts – professional, focused on solving a series of murders, and personal, which in this case becomes as important and surprising as the outcome of the investigation.

_Legado en los huesos_

Although the first volume completed the plot of the investigation, the second installment begins with the trial against the stepfather of a young woman, Johana Márquez. Amaia Salazar is called on by the police just after the accused has committed suicide in the bathroom of the courthouse and left a note with a single message: "Tarttalo". Amaia must discover its meaning and at the same time uncover disturbing details of her past.

_Ofrenda a la tormenta_

The last entry in the trilogy was presented to the public on 25 November 2014.[8]

During the presentation, the author admitted that the idea which inspired the whole story was for readers to understand that "as more magical elements appear, the novel is more real and more current."
