_SYSTEMA VEGETABILIUM_ (abbreviated as Syst. Veg.) is a book published in four editions, following twelve earlier editions known as _Systema Naturae_. The first edition, published in 1774 and edited by Johan Andreas Murray is counted as edition 13 because it continues from the 12th edition of _Systema Naturae_. All the names in it are attributed to Carl Linnaeus.[1][2] The second edition, (counted as the 14th of _Systema Naturae_) published in 1784, includes plant species described by J.A. Murray and Carl Peter Thunberg.[3][4] The third edition (counted as the 15th), was edited by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon[5][6]

Although the fourth edition, purportedly the 16th edition of Linnaeus's work was published in five volumes between 1824 and 1828, and attributed to Kurt Sprengel, the International Plant Names Index suggests that it should be counted as edition 17.[7][8]

The 16th edition (abbreviated as Syst. Veg., ed. 15 bis [Roemer & Schultes]) was written jointly by Johann Jacob Roemer, Josef August Schultes and Julius Hermann Schultes. It was published in seven volumes between 1817-1830 under the name _Systema Vegetabilium: Secundum Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species. Cum characteribus differentiis et synonymis. Nova Editio, speciebus inde ab Editione XV. Detectis aucta et locupletata_.[9][10][11]
