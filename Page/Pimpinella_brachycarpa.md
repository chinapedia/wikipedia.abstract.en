_PIMPINELLA BRACHYCARPA_, known as CHAMNAMUL[1][2] and SHORT-FRUIT PIMPINELLA,[3] is a species in the genus _Pimpinella_ (family Apiaceae). It is a scented plant with saw-toothed, oval leaves, which bears white flowers between June and August, and edible baby leaves.[4]


Culinary use

Like other plants of the parsley family, chamnamul has aromatic leaves used as a culinary herb.

Korea

In Korean cuisine, the smooth leaves and crunchy stems of young chamnamul are served fresh or blanced as a spring _namul_ (seasoned herbal vegetable dish). In North Korea, _chamnamul-kimchi_ is a popular dish, known as one of Kim Il-sung's favourite.[5] Recently in South Korea, chamnamul is one of the ingredients that frequently feature in Korean-style western food recipes, such as chamnamul pasta or chamnamul pesto.[6]
