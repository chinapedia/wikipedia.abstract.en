"I GOTCHA NOW" is a song written by Lynsey de Paul and released as a single by Zakatek (Lenny Zakatek) on the Bell Records label on 2 March 1973.[1][2][3] The song features a pounding piano (possibly played by de Paul), fuzz guitar and "I Am the Walrus"-esque strings.[4][5] The B-side is also a de Paul song, "So Good To You",[6][7] and both songs were recorded at 10cc's Strawberry Studios with Eric Stewart, the lead guitarist and singer of The Mindbenders and later a member of 10cc, being the co-engineer.[8][9] De Paul recorded her own version of "So Good To You" and released it in October 1973 as the flip side to her single "Won't Somebody Dance with Me".[10][11] In Japan, this was the A-side of the release.[12] Both songs were however, originally written by de Paul for Zakatek (as was the follow up single "Get Your Gun"),[13] after she co-discovered him together with the actor Dudley Moore,[14][15] her boyfriend at the time, although some years later de Paul revealed that she had offered "I Gotcha Now" to Slade.[16][17]

"I Gotcha Now" was released on CD for the first time in 2018 on the compilation album _Mixed Up Minds Part Thirteen: Rock & Pop From the British Isles, 1969-1973_.[18][19] The song is still played on the radio, most recently by KDVS based in based in Davis, California[20] and KOOP in Austin, Texas.[21]
