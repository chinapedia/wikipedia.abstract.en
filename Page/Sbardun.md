ALUN 'SBARDUN' HUWS (26 September 1948 – 15 December 2014) was a Welsh musician and songwriter, known mainly for founding 1970s folk band Y Tebot Piws. He was known in the music world as Sbardun.[1] He worked exclusively in Welsh and only gave one English language interview to the music press.[2]

Sbardun was born Alun Huws on 26 September 1948 in Caernarfonshire, Wales, and grew up in the village of Penrhyndeudraeth, where he formed a skiffle band with his brother.[3] In 1968, when at college in Cardiff,[4] he formed folk rock band Y Tebot Piws with three college friends, which was credited with beginning the 1970s rock scene in Wales.[5] Y Tebot Piws was disbanded in 1972 and Sbardun joined folk band Ac Eraill, who composed the first Welsh language rock opera in 1974.[6]

Y Tebot Piws reformed in 2002 and in 2008 released a collection of rock songs with a Celtic/Gaelic twist. They released a farewell album, _Ta Ta Tebot_, in 2011.[7]

Sbardun died at the Heath Hospital in Cardiff on 15 December 2014.[8]

A special edition of the Welsh language music programme, _Y Stiwdio Gefn_, was broadcast in December 2015, where a number of musicians performed music written by Sbardun.[9] At the 2016 National Eisteddfod of Wales a new prize was to be awarded, with a trophy and £500 prize to be provided by Sbardun's widow, Gwenno Huws. The Sbardun Memorial Trophy competition and prize was to be for the best original folk song.[10]
