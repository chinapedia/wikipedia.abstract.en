Legend

Lord Tuljabhavani is a popular deity and also a family deity (Kul-daiwatall) across India. She is described as the impressive and formidable Goddess in Hindu Puranas, who is known to combat demons and evil forces and maintain the moral order and righteousness in the universe.

The temple is mentioned in the "skanda puran". A sage known as Kardabh had a wife Anubuti who performed a penance at the banks of Mandakini river for Bhavani mata to look after her infant child after the sage's death. While performing the penance, the demon known as Kukur tried to disturb her penance during which Mata Bhavani came to the aid of Anubuti and killed the demon.. From that day onwards the Goddess Bhavani came to be known as Tulja Bhavani. The same place is today known as Tuljapur.

History

People of Peddamunigal started worshipping the goddess Bhavani in the early 1900s in a small hut built with cloth (Paal in native Lambada language). After few years Kethavath Hema Saukaar and the local people of the village came to a consensus and appointed a family to serve the goddess. Since then this family is called the Bhakath family. The Temple was constructed in the mid-1950s by Kethavath Chandru Naik with the cooperation of locals and the people of nearby villages. Daily prayers are performed to the goddess Bhavani by the Bhakath family.
