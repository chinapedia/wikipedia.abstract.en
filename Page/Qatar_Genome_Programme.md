The QATAR GENOME PROGRAMME aims to sequence the genomes of 350,000 inhabitants of Qatar.[1] Supported by the Sidra Medical and Research Center, the program is managed by Qatar Genome Committee and wants to eventually offer personalized healthcare in Qatar to its population with advances in genomics.[2]

Apart from the Qatar Genome Programme, a number of other genome-scale studies have emerged from Qatar, including ones looking at the pharmacogenetic map[3] of Qatar from genome and exome sequences available in public domain.
