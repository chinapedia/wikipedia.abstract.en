The word with a descriptor is also used to describe the eves of Christmas, New Year, and Feast of Jordan days.[1][2][3]


Etymology

The word kutia is a borrowing from the Greek language κουκκί (bean) or κόκκος (grain).[4]


Description

Ukraine

In Ukraine kutia is an essential dish at the Ukrainian Christmas Eve Supper[5] (also known as _Sviata vecheria_ or _Svyata vecherya_). It is believed that kutia has been known to Ukrainians’ ancestors since pre-historic times.[6]

The main ingredients used to make traditional kutia are: wheatberries, poppy seeds and honey.[7] At times, walnuts, dried fruit and raisins are added as well. Kutia is a Lenten dish and no milk or egg products can be used. There are known kutia recipes that use pearl barley instead of wheatberries.[8]

Kutia, as a part of Ukrainian Christmas Eve Supper, is used in a number of rituals performed on the night. Kutia is the first out of twelve dishes served for Sviata Vecheria to be tasted.[9] Everyone present must have at least a spoonful of kutia.[10] In the past, the head of the household used kutia to foretell whether the upcoming year harvest would be plentiful; and to bargain with the forces of the nature asking for good weather.[11]

Kolyvo is a Ukrainian ritual dish similar to kutia, but includes no poppy seeds. Kolyvo is served at remembrance services.
