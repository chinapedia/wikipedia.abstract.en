GOTHAM CITY ( ), or simply GOTHAM, is a fictional city appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, best known as the home of Batman. The city was first identified as Batman's place of residence in _Batman_ #4 (December 1940) and has since been the primary setting for stories featuring the character.

Gotham City is traditionally depicted as being located in the state of New Jersey.[1][2][3][4][5][6] Over the years, Gotham's look and atmosphere has been influenced by cities such as New York City[7] and Chicago.[8][9]

Locations used as inspiration or filming locations for Gotham City in the live-action _Batman_ films and television series have included Chicago, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, New Jersey, and New York City.


Origin of name

Writer Bill Finger, on the naming of the city and the reason for changing Batman's locale from New York City to a fictional city, said, "Originally I was going to call Gotham City 'Civic City.' Then I tried 'Capital City,' then 'Coast City.' Then I flipped through the New York City phone book and spotted the name 'Gotham Jewelers' and said, 'That's it,' Gotham City. We didn't call it New York because we wanted anybody in any city to identify with it."[10]

"Gotham" was a nickname for New York City that became popular in the nineteenth century; Washington Irving had first attached it to New York in the November 11, 1807 edition of his _Salmagundi_,[11] a periodical which lampooned New York culture and politics. Irving took the name from the village of Gotham, Nottinghamshire, England: a place inhabited, according to folklore, by fools.[12][13] The village's name derives from Old English _gāt_ 'goat' and _hām_ "home", literally "homestead where goats are kept,"[14] and is pronounced , like the word _goat_ (cf. _Chatham_, , a similar name where the letters _th_ represent a "t" sound followed by a silent "h" rather than a "th" sound). The Joker refers to this etymology in _Detective Comics_ #880, in which he tells Batman that the word means "a safe place for goats."[15] In contrast, "Gotham" as used for New York has a different pronunciation by analogy to other words spelled with "th" and is pronounced as ,[16] like the word _Goth_.


Geography

Location in New Jersey

from _Amazing World of DC Comics_ #14 (March 1977). Art by Dick Dillin.]] Gotham City, like other cities in the DC Universe, has varied in its portrayals over the decades, but the city's location is traditionally depicted as being in the state of New Jersey. In _Amazing World of DC Comics_ #14 (March 1977), publisher Mark Gruenwald discusses the history of the Justice League and indicates that Gotham City is located in New Jersey.[17]

In the _World’s Greatest Super Heroes_ (August 1978) comic strip, a map is shown placing Gotham City in New Jersey and Metropolis in Delaware.[18] _World's Finest Comics_ #259 (November 1979) also confirms that Gotham is in New Jersey.[19] _New Adventures of Superboy_ #22 (October 1981) and the 1990 _Atlas of the DC Universe_ both show maps of Gotham City in New Jersey and Metropolis in Delaware.[20][21]

_Detective Comics_ #503 (June 1983) includes several references suggesting Gotham City is in New Jersey. A location on the Jersey Shore is described as "twenty miles north of Gotham". Within the same issue, Robin and Batgirl drive from a "secret New Jersey airfield" to Gotham City and then drive on the "Hudson County Highway";[22] Hudson County is the name of an actual county in New Jersey.

_Batman: Shadow of the Bat_, Annual #1 (June 1993) further establishes that Gotham City is in New Jersey. Sal E. Jordan's driver's license in the comic shows his address as "72 Faxcol Dr Gotham City, NJ 12345".[23]

The 2016 film _Suicide Squad_ reveals Gotham City to be in the state of New Jersey within the DC Extended Universe.[24][25]

In relation to Metropolis

.]]

Gotham City is the home of Batman, just as Metropolis is home to Superman, and the two heroes often work together in both cities. In comic book depictions, the exact distance between Gotham and Metropolis has varied over the years, with the cities usually being within driving distance of each other. The two cities are sometimes portrayed as twin cities on opposite sides of the Delaware Bay, with Gotham in New Jersey and Metropolis in Delaware.[26][27] _The Atlas of the DC Universe_ from the 1990s places Metropolis in Delaware and Gotham City in New Jersey.[28]

During the Bronze Age of Comic Books, the Metro-Narrows Bridge was depicted as the main route connecting the twin cities of Metropolis and Gotham City.[29][30] It has been described as being the longest suspension bridge in the world.[31]

A map appeared in _The New Adventures of Superboy_ #22 (October 1981), that showed Smallville within driving distance of both Metropolis and Gotham City; Smallville was relocated to Kansas in post-Crisis continuity.[32] A map of the United States in _The Secret Files & Origins Guide to the DC Universe 2000_ #1 (March 2000) depicts Metropolis and Gotham City as being somewhere in the Tri-state Area alongside Blüdhaven.[33]

Within the DC Extended Universe, the 2016 film _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_ depicts Gotham City as being located across a bay from Metropolis.[34]


Fictional history

In _Swamp Thing_ #53, Alan Moore wrote a fictional history for Gotham City that other writers have also followed. According to Moore's tale, a Norwegian mercenary, Captain Jon Logerquist, founded Gotham City in 1635 and the British later took it over—a story that parallels the founding of New York by the Dutch (as New Amsterdam) and later takeover by the British. During the American Revolutionary War, Gotham City was the site of a major battle (paralleling the Battle of Brooklyn in the American Revolution). This was detailed in Rick Veitch's _Swamp Thing_ #85 featuring Tomahawk. Rumors held it to be the site of various occult rites.

The 2011 comic book series _Batman: Gates of Gotham_ details a history of Gotham City in which Alan Wayne (Bruce Wayne's ancestor), Theodore Cobblepot (Oswald Cobblepot's ancestor), and Edward Elliot (Thomas Elliot's ancestor), are considered the founding fathers of Gotham. In 1881 they constructed three bridges called the Gates of Gotham, each bearing one of their last names. Edward Elliot became increasingly jealous of the Wayne family’s popularity and wealth during this time period, a jealousy that would spread to his great-great grandson, Thomas Elliot or Hush.[35]

The occult origins of Gotham are further delved into by Peter Milligan's 1990 story arc "Dark Knight, Dark City",[36] which reveals that some of the American Founding Fathers are involved in summoning a bat-demon which becomes trapped beneath old "Gotham Town", its dark influence spreading as Gotham City evolves. A similar trend is followed in 2005's _Shadowpact_ #5 by Bill Willingham, which expands upon Gotham's occult heritage by revealing a being who has slept for 40,000 years beneath the land upon which Gotham City was built. Strega, the being's servant, says that the "dark and often cursed character" of the city was influenced by the being who now uses the name "Doctor Gotham."

During the American Civil War, it was defended by an ancestor of the Penguin, fighting for the Union Army, Col. Nathan Cobblepot, in the Legendary Battle of Gotham Heights. In _Gotham Underground_ #2 by Frank Tieri, Tobias Whale claims that 19th century Gotham was run by five rival gangs, until the first "masks" appeared, eventually forming a gang of their own. It is not clear whether these were vigilantes or costumed criminals.

In contemporary times, Batman is considered the protector of Gotham, as he is fiercely protective of his home city. While other masked vigilantes also operate in Gotham City, they do so under Batman's approval since he is considered the best and most knowledgeable crime-fighter in the city.

Many storylines have added more events to Gotham's history, at the same time greatly affecting the city and its people. Perhaps the greatest in effect was a long set of serial storylines, which started with Ra's al Ghul releasing a debilitating virus called the "Clench" during the _Contagion_ storyline. As that arc concluded, the city was beginning to recover, only to suffer an earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter Scale in the 1998 "Cataclysm" storyline. This resulted in the federal government cutting Gotham off from the rest of the United States in the 1999 storyline "No Man's Land", the city's remaining residents forced to engage in gang warfare, either as active participants or paying for protection from groups ranging from the GCPD to the Penguin, just to stay alive. Eventually, Gotham was rebuilt and returned to the U.S. as part of a campaign mounted by Lex Luthor, who used the positive publicity of his role to make a successful bid for the position of President of the United States.

For a time, the city faces various complications from gang warfare and escalating vigilante actions, due to such events as Spoiler unintentionally triggering a gang war, the return of Jason Todd as the Red Hood, and Bruce Wayne's disappearance during the war against Darkseid. Although Dick Grayson takes on the role of Batman for a time, matters become worse when a complex conspiracy initiated by the Cluemaster results in multiple villains attacking all areas of Batman's life, ruining the reputation of Wayne Enterprises and seeing Commissioner Gordon framed for causing a mass train accident. After destruction caused by the Joker's latest rampage, new villain Mr Bloom sets out to destroy the city so that a new form can "grow" from it, but Bruce Wayne returns as Batman in time to defeat Bloom and reaffirm his role as Batman.


Atmosphere

In terms of atmosphere, _Batman_ writer and editor Dennis O'Neil has said that, figuratively, Batman's Gotham City is akin to "Manhattan below Fourteenth Street at eleven minutes past midnight on the coldest night in November."[37] Batman artist Neal Adams has long believed that Chicago, with its proliferation of mobsters in the 1940s, was the basis for Gotham, commenting, "Chicago has had a reputation for a certain kind of criminality," says Adams, who lives in New York. "Batman is in this kind of corrupt city and trying to turn it back into a better place. One of the things about Chicago is Chicago has alleys (which are virtually nonexistent in New York). Back alleys, that's where Batman fights all the bad guys."[38] The statement "Metropolis is New York in the daytime; Gotham City is New York at night" has been variously attributed to comics creators Frank Miller and John Byrne.[39]

Stone gargoyles are commonly depicted on the buildings of Gotham City, such as the thirteen gargoyles on Wayne Tower.[40] Various artists have depicted Batman perched atop gargoyles while keeping watch over Gotham City.[41]

In designing the award-winning _Batman: The Animated Series_, creators Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski emulated the Tim Burton films' "otherworldly timelessness," incorporating period features such as black-and-white title cards, police airships (although no such thing existed, Timm has stated that he found it to fit the show's style), and a "vintage" color scheme with film noir flourishes.[42] Police airships have since been incorporated into Batman comic books and are a recurring element in Gotham City.[43]

Gotham City's atmosphere took on a lighter tone in the comics of the 1950s and part of the 1960s, similar to the tone of _Batman_ stories of that era. However, by the early 1970s, particularly with Dennis O'Neil becoming a prominent _Batman_ writer,[44] the tone of the city, along with that of the stories, had become grittier. Significantly, by the 1970s, Gotham's real-life counterpart, New York, had lost much of its 1960s "Fun City" luster and was beset by urban problems including public fear of rising crime, a declining economy, police corruption, and municipal financial mismanagement. In most stories since the 70s, the portrayal of Gotham is that of a dark and foreboding metropolis rife with crime, corruption, and a deep-seated sense of urban decay.

During his run as a writer, _Batman_ scribe Grant Morrison brought about a more optimistic interpretation of Gotham City. As Morrison stated: "If Gotham was so bloody awful, no one normal would live there and there'd be no one to protect from criminals. If Gotham really was an open sewer of crime and corruption, every story set there would serve to demonstrate the complete and utter failure of Batman's mission, which isn't really the message we want to send, is it? You've got Batman and all his allies as well as Commissioner Gordon and the city still exudes a vile miasma of darkness and death? I can't buy that. It's simply not realistic and flies in the face of in-story logic (and you know I like my comics realistic!) so my artists and I have taken a different tack and we want to show the cool, vibrant side of Gotham, the energy and excitement that would draw people to live and visit there."[45]

Architecture

, inspired the look of Gotham in the 1989 film _Batman_.[46]]] In the Batman comics, the person cited as an influential figure in promoting the unique architecture of Gotham City during the 19th century was Judge Solomon Wayne, Bruce Wayne's ancestor. His campaign to reform Gotham came to a head when he met a young architect named Cyrus Pinkney. Wayne commissioned Pinkney to design and to build the first "Gotham Style" structures in what became the center of the city's financial district. The "Gotham Style" idea of the writers matches parts of the Gothic Revival in style and timing. In the storyline of Batman: Gothic, the Gotham Cathedral plays a central role for the story as it is built by Mr. Whisper, the story's antagonist.

In a 1992 storyline, a man obsessed with Pinkney's architecture blew up several Gotham buildings in order to reveal the Pinkney structures they had hidden; the editorial purpose behind this was to transform the city depicted in the comics to resemble the designs created by Anton Furst for the 1989 _Batman_ film.[47][48][49] Alan Wayne expanded upon his father's ideas and built a bridge to expand the city. Edward Elliot and Theodore Cobblepot also each had a bridge named for them.

Christopher Nolan, who once lived in Chicago, effected a depiction of Gotham that featured distinct Chicago architecture.[50] _Batman Begins_ features a CGI-augmented version of Chicago while _The Dark Knight_ more directly features Chicago infrastructure and architecture such as Navy Pier: however, _The Dark Knight Rises_ abandoned Chicago, instead shooting in Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, New Jersey, London and Glasgow.[51][52][53][54][55][56]

_Arkham Asylum: Living Hell_ mentions the "Sprang Act", which forbids Gothamite businesses from advertising on rooftops. It was passed after minor villain Humpty Dumpty over-wound the mainspring of the city hall clock, causing the hour hand to jump off and knock one of the billboards down, causing a chain reaction.[57]

Police corruption

A common theme in stories set in Gotham is the rampant and recurring corruption within the city's civil authorities and infrastructure, most notably within the Gotham City Police Department. During stories set early in Batman's career (most notably _Batman: Year One_), Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb was depicted as accepting bribes from many people. However, Batman found evidence for conspiracy charges, forcing Loeb to resign his position. Later stories depicted subsequent commissioners as also being corruptible, or open to various forms of influence. In other stories, Batman has had to take on crooked cops, either acting in collusion with supervillains, working for the mob, or on their own. Later stories, featuring James Gordon as the new Commissioner, show the two characters often uniting to purge corruption from the force. Gordon eventually retired, handing the police force over to his replacement, Commissioner Akins. Gordon later returned to the position of Commissioner, unfortunately to find corruption taking a greater hold since his departure.

Corruption escalates during _Batman Eternal_ when Gordon is framed for causing a major train accident and a new commissioner is appointed with ties to the old gangs, but Batman and his allies are eventually able to replace him with their ally Jason Bard, only for Bard to resign when he is revealed to have been working with Hush to destroy Batman. During Bruce Wayne's temporary 'retirement' after he was left with amnesia following his last battle with the Joker, the police department even created their own Batman using various donated technology, with Gordon acting as the GCPD's official Batman, but he returned to his old role in the department after the true Batman returned. In the 1966 television series, _Batman_, the Gotham City police force was not a focus of the stories.

Films

1989 Batman Anthology

in the 1989 _Batman_ film]] For _Batman_ (1989), the look of Gotham was designed by production designer Anton Furst, who won an Oscar for his work on the film.[84] Wayne Manor's exteriors utilized Knebworth House, a Gothicised Tudor, while its interiors were Hatfield House in Hatfield. The Axis Chemical Works, where Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) plunges into the chemical sludge, was filmed at a disused power station in Acton Lane, West London. The exploding exterior was Little Barford Power Station, a couple of miles south of St Neots in Cambridgeshire.[85] Tim Burton's sequel, _Batman Returns_ (1992), filmed city scenes entirely on soundstages.[86] Production designer Bo Welch, who took over from Furst, based his designs on Furst's concepts.[87][88]

When Joel Schumacher took over directing the _Batman_ film series from Tim Burton, Barbara Ling handled the production design for both of Schumacher's films _Batman Forever_ (1995)[89][90][91] and 1997's _Batman & Robin_[92][93][94] Ling's vision of Gotham City was a luminous and outlandish evocation of Modern expressionism[95] and Constructivism.[96] Its futuristic-like concepts (to a certain extent, akin to the 1982 film _Blade Runner_[97]) appeared to be sort of a cross between Manhattan and the "Neo-Tokyo" of _Akira_. Ling admitted her influences for the Gotham City design came from "neon-ridden Tokyo and the Machine Age. Gotham is like a World's Fair on ecstasy."[98] When Batman is pursuing Two-Face in _Batman Forever,_ the chase ends at Lady Gotham, the fictional equivalent of the Statue of Liberty. During Mr. Freeze’s attempt to freeze Gotham in the film _Batman & Robin_, the targeting screen for his giant laser locates it somewhere on the New England shoreline, possibly as far north as Maine. The soundtrack for _Batman & Robin_ features a song named after the city and sung by R. Kelly, later included on international editions of his 1998 double album _R._

The Dark Knight Trilogy

Christopher Nolan has stated that Chicago is the basis of his portrayal of Gotham, and the majority of both _Batman Begins_ (2005) and _The Dark Knight_ (2008) were filmed there.[99] However, the city itself seems to take many cues from New York City: police cars use a paint job that was used by the NYPD in the 1990s, and the same is applicable to garbage trucks, and the _Gotham Post_ seems to have the same font heading as _The New York Post_.

In _Batman Begins_, the art deco Chicago Board of Trade Building was used for the film's Wayne Tower, which in the film, was also as the hub of Gotham's water and elevated railway systems. Garrick Theatre stood in as Gotham's opera house. 35 East Wacker was used as the Gotham courthouse. Mentmore Towers in Buckinghamshire was used to portray Wayne Manor.[100] Nolan desired that Gotham appeared as a large, modern city that nonetheless reflected a variety of architecture styles and periods, as well as different socioeconomic strata. The production's approach depicted Gotham as an exaggeration of New York, with elements taken from Chicago, the elevated freeways and monorails of Tokyo,[101] and the "walled city of Kalhoon" in Hong Kong, which was the basis for the slum in the film known as The Narrows.[102][103]

In the animated _Batman: Gotham Knight_ (2008), which takes place between _Batman Begins_ and _The Dark Knight_, The Narrows was converted into an expansion of Arkham Asylum.

In _The Dark Knight_, Wayne Enterprises, previously depicted as the Chicago Board of Trade Building, was now the Richard J. Daley Center. As Wayne Manor was being reconstructed during the events of _The Dark Knight_, a digitally enhanced Hfront 71 was used as Bruce Wayne's penthouse. 330 North Wabash was used as Gotham City Hall and houses Mayor Garcia's office and Harvey Dent's office. The climax of the movie on the Prewitt Building uses the then-under-construction Trump Tower. Other Chicago landmarks seen in _The Dark Knight_ include the Marina City towers, Willis Tower, Navy Pier, the Randolph Street Metra Station, and 111 East Wacker Drive.[104] It is revealed that downtown Gotham, or much of the city, is on an island, similar to New York City's Manhattan Island, as suggested by the _Gotham Island Ferry_. However, while Gordon is discussing evacuation plans with the Mayor, _land routes to the east_ are mentioned. In conversation with Harvey Dent, Bruce Wayne indicates that the Palisades of the Wayne Manor estate are within the city limits. In terms of population, Lucius Fox says that the city houses "30 million people". The film indicates that the city's area code is 735, which in real life is an unused code. Compared to the previous film, less CGI was used in Gotham's skyline, resulting in plenty of shots of a digitally unaltered Chicago skyline.

For _The Dark Knight Rises_ (2012), the production utilized Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, New Jersey, London and Glasgow for shots of Gotham City.[105][106][107][108] [109][110] Locations in Pittsburgh included the Mellon Institute and Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University,[111] and Heinz Field, which is used as Gotham City's football stadium.[112] A scene where John Blake confronts two construction workers at the "Broucek Cement Company" was filmed at the Frank Bryan Cement Plant in South Pittsburgh.[113] In Manhattan, One Liberty Plaza replaced the Richard J. Daley Center as the location for the headquarters of Wayne Enterprises.[114] The JP Morgan Building at 23 Wall Street represents the exterior of the Gotham City Stock Exchange, the area of Park Avenue around 84th Street is used for the scene in which rich citizens are dragged from their homes, and Batman surveys the city from atop the Queensboro Bridge. In Newark, Military Park Station, on the Newark Light Rail, between Orange Street and Penn Station, is used as the subway tunnel through which Catwoman lures Batman into Bane's trap,[115] and Newark City Hall was used as the Red Cross shelter inhabited by Bane's guerrilla army.[116][117] An address by the president refers to Gotham City as "America's greatest city," combined with a map seen briefly onscreen, confirms that Gotham (which looks more like Manhattan than Chicago, the city that stood in for Gotham in the previous two films) is an analogue to New York City within the movie's universe. The overview image of "Gotham Island" seen when the bridges are being blown is an aerial view of Manhattan with three bridges digitally added in on the Hudson River side. A state trooper on the last remaining intact bridge into the city is shown to be part of the "Gotham State Police," and a Gotham State Police car is among the vehicles that participate in the car chase after Bane's attack on the Stock Exchange, suggesting that Gotham City is in the fictional US state of Gotham.

DC Extended Universe

Within the DC Extended Universe, Gotham City is located in Gotham County, New Jersey. In _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_, paperwork mentions that the city is in "Gotham County", and Amanda Waller's files on Deadshot and Harley Quinn in _Suicide Squad_ reveal Gotham City to be located in the state of New Jersey.[118][119]

Zack Snyder confirmed that Metropolis and Gotham City are in close geographical proximity to each other,[120] with Gotham City being located on the edge of the New Jersey, separated from the federal district[121] of Metropolis by Delaware Bay. In _Justice League_ it is revealed there is an underground tunnel connecting the two, constructed as part of the abandoned 'Metropolis Project' in 1929 to connect the two cities. There are multiple islands located in the bay also, with one of them being named Braxton Island. Senator Debbie Stabenow makes a cameo appearance in _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_ as the state's governor.

The _Boston Globe_ compared the close proximity of Gotham and Metropolis to Jersey City, New Jersey and Manhattan, New York.[122] A television spot for Turkish Airlines premiering during the 2016 Super Bowl featured Bruce Wayne (played by the film's star, Ben Affleck) promoting Gotham as a tourist destination.[123]

Television

The 1960s live-action _Batman_ television series never specified Gotham's location. The related theatrical movie showed Batman to be flying over suburban Los Angeles, the Hollywood Hills, palm trees, a harbor, a beach and a view of the Los Angeles City Hall.

Gotham City is featured in _Batman: The Animated Series_. In the episode "Joker's Favor", a driver's license lists a Gotham area resident's hometown as "Gotham Estates, NY". In the episode "Avatar", when Bruce Wayne leaves for England, a map shows Gotham City, at the joining of Long Island and the Hudson River. The episode "Fire from Olympus" shows a character's address in a police file indicating that Gotham City is located in New York state. The episode "The Mechanic", however, implies that Gotham resides in a state of the same name; a prison workshop is shown stamping license plates that read "Gotham: The Dark Deco State" (as a reference to the artistic style of the series). The episode "Harlequinade" states that Gotham City has a population of approximately 10 million people.

The TV series _Gotham_ films in New York City, and according to executive producer Danny Cannon, its atmosphere is inspired by the look of the city itself in the 1970s films of Sidney Lumet and William Friedkin. Clues to this include and signs showing phone numbers bearing the area code 212.[124] Donal Logue, who portrays Harvey Bullock in the series _Gotham_, described different aspects of that series' design of Gotham City as exhibiting different sensibilities, explaining, "For me, you can step into things that almost feel like the roaring 20s, and then there's this other really kind of heavy _Blade Runner_ vibe floating around. There are elements of it that are completely contemporary and there are pieces of it that are very old-fashioned...There were a couple of examples of modern technology, but maybe an antiquated version of it, that gave me a little bit of sense that it's certainly not the 50s and the 60s...But it's not high tech and it's not futuristic, by any means."[125]

In the TV series _Smallville_, Gotham City is mentioned by the character Linda Lake in the episode "Hydro", who jokes she can see Gotham from her view. It is also mentioned in "Reunion", where one of Oliver Queen's friends mentions having to get back to Gotham.

The fifth episode of _Young Justice_, entitled "Schooled", indicates that Gotham is located in Connecticut, near Bridgeport.

In the CW series _Supergirl_, Gotham is mentioned by a civilian after Superman saves him and his family from John Corben, telling his wife and son they should move back to the city. Gotham and its vigilantes are referenced by Supergirl during a battle with Master Jailer. It is also mentioned in _Arrow_, where in the same episode Oliver mentions Bruce Wayne by name. Gotham City was incorporated into the Arrowverse as part of _Elseworlds_, a 2018 crossover storyline among the shows, which introduced Batwoman.[126]

Animated films

During the events of the direct-to-video film, _Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero_ (1998), a computer screen displaying Barbara Gordon's personal information refers to her location as "Gotham City, NY", and also displays her area code as being 212 – a Manhattan area code. _Batman Beyond_ (1999–2001) envisions a Gotham City in 2039, referred to as "Neo-Gotham".

The 2008 direct-to-DVD film _Batman: Gotham Knight_ shows Gotham as a large city with many skyscrapers and a bustling population.

Video games

Gotham City appears in several video games, including _Batman Begins_, _DC Universe Online_, and _Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe_. The city makes another appearance in a video game with _Injustice: Gods Among Us_, where the player can fight in front of and inside of Wayne Manor, on top of a building and in an alley as well. Gotham also appears in _Lego Dimensions_, and it is a playable stage once again in _Injustice 2_, where the player can fight in front of Empire Theater and inside the prop room.

Lego Batman

The city is featured in _Lego Batman: The Videogame_ and _LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes_ as the main hub world, and in _LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham_, and _Lego DC Super-Villains_. It also the main setting in the related film 'The LEGO Batman Movie''.

Batman: Arkham Universe

_Batman: Arkham Asylum_ (2009) opens with Batman driving Joker from Gotham City to Arkham Asylum. Joker also threatens to detonate bombs across Gotham. In _Batman: Arkham City_ (2011), the slums of Old Gotham City (the northern island) were converted into Arkham City. Inside the prison walls, this part of Gotham contains various landmarks throughout the story, like Penguin's Iceberg Lounge, the Ace Chemical Plant, the Sionis Steel Mill, the Old Gotham City Police Department building, and the Monarch Theatre with the Wayne murder scene in Crime Alley. Most of these locations have major events in the story. In _Batman: Arkham Origins_ (2013), an earlier, younger version of the city can be seen than that of other games in the _Batman: Arkham_ series. In addition to the northern island, this installment in the series lets players explore a new southern island, connected to the former by the Pioneer's Bridge. The setting of _Batman: Arkham Knight_ (2015), Central Gotham City, is five-times larger than Old Gotham.
