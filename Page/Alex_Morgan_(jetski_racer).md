Early life

Morgan grew up in Redondo Beach, California and attended south high school. Alex was an avid street bike racer until he suffered an injury due to an accident forcing him to quit racing bikes. During summer vacation that same year, Morgan had traveled to the Bahamas and decided to rent a Kawasaki Jet Ski. Looking to replace the thrill of street bike riding, he ultimately decided that jet skiing was for him and upon his return he purchased his own Kawasaki jet ski. Morgan then spent most of his weekends riding in his local lake and occasionally ocean riding when time permitted. One such weekend trip to Puerto Vallarta as Morgan pulled up to his favourite ride spot, there was an IJSBA-sanctioned race going on. Confident in his skill, Morgan wondered how he would do against other riders in the competition, so he signed up and joined fourteen 14 other riders. Despite lack of quality racing fuel and little to no racing experience, he finished well. And was motivated to improve and to find what kind of heights he could reach in the sport.[3]
