Wiki_slope_in_2d.svg In mathematics, the SLOPE or GRADIENT of a line is a number that describes both the _direction_ and the _steepness_ of the line.[1] Slope is often denoted by the letter _m_; there is no clear answer to the question why the letter _m_ is used for slope, but its earliest use in English appears in O'Brien (1844)[2] who wrote the equation of a straight line as and it can also be found in Todhunter (1888)[3] who wrote it as "_y_ = _mx_ + _c_".[4]

Slope is calculated by finding the ratio of the "vertical change" to the "horizontal change" between (any) two distinct points on a line. Sometimes the ratio is expressed as a quotient ("rise over run"), giving the same number for every two distinct points on the same line. A line that is decreasing has a negative "rise". The line may be practical - as set by a road surveyor, or in a diagram that models a road or a roof either as a description or as a plan.

The _steepness_, incline, or grade of a line is measured by the absolute value of the slope. A slope with a greater absolute value indicates a steeper line. The _direction_ of a line is either increasing, decreasing, horizontal or vertical.

-   A line is INCREASING if it goes UP from left to right. The slope is POSITIVE, i.e. m > 0.
-   A line is DECREASING if it goes DOWN from left to right. The slope is NEGATIVE, i.e. m < 0.
-   If a line is horizontal the slope is ZERO. This is a constant function.
-   If a line is vertical the slope is _undefined_ (see below).

The rise of a road between two points is the difference between the altitude of the road at those two points, say _y_₁ and _y_₂, or in other words, the rise is (_y_₂ − _y_₁) = Δ_y_. For relatively short distances - where the earth's curvature may be neglected, the run is the difference in distance from a fixed point measured along a level, horizontal line, or in other words, the run is (_x_₂ − _x_₁) = Δ_x_. Here the slope of the road between the two points is simply described as the ratio of the altitude change to the horizontal distance between any two points on the line.

In mathematical language, the slope _m_ of the line is

$$m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}.$$

The concept of slope applies directly to grades or gradients in geography and civil engineering. Through trigonometry, the slope _m_ of a line is related to its angle of incline _θ_ by the tangent function

_m_ = tan (_θ_)

Thus, a 45° rising line has a slope of +1 and a 45° falling line has a slope of −1.

As a generalization of this practical description, the mathematics of differential calculus defines the slope of a curve at a point as the slope of the tangent line at that point. When the curve is given by a series of points in a diagram or in a list of the coordinates of points, the slope may be calculated not at a point but between any two given points. When the curve is given as a continuous function, perhaps as an algebraic formula, then the differential calculus provides rules giving a formula for the slope of the curve at any point in the middle of the curve.

This generalization of the concept of slope allows very complex constructions to be planned and built that go well beyond static structures that are either horizontals or verticals, but can change in time, move in curves, and change depending on the rate of change of other factors. Thereby, the simple idea of slope becomes one of the main basis of the modern world in terms of both technology and the built environment.


Definition

Slope_of_lines_illustrated.jpg Gradient_of_a_line_in_coordinates_from_-12x+2_to_+12x+2.gif The slope of a line in the plane containing the _x_ and _y_ axes is generally represented by the letter _m_, and is defined as the change in the _y_ coordinate divided by the corresponding change in the _x_ coordinate, between two distinct points on the line. This is described by the following equation:

$$m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{\text{vertical} \, \text{change} }{\text{horizontal} \, \text{change} }= \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}.$$
(The Greek letter _delta_, Δ, is commonly used in mathematics to mean "difference" or "change".)

Given two points (_x_₁,_y_₁) and (_x_₂,_y_₂), the change in _x_ from one to the other is (_run_), while the change in _y_ is (_rise_). Substituting both quantities into the above equation generates the formula:

$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}.$$
The formula fails for a vertical line, parallel to the _y_ axis (see Division by zero), where the slope can be taken as infinite, so the slope of a vertical line is considered undefined.

Examples

Suppose a line runs through two points: _P_ = (1, 2) and _Q_ = (13, 8). By dividing the difference in _y_-coordinates by the difference in _x_-coordinates, one can obtain the slope of the line:

$$m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{8 - 2}{13 - 1} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}$$
.

    Since the slope is positive, the direction of the line is increasing. Since |m|<1, the incline is not very steep (incline <45°).

As another example, consider a line which runs through the points (4, 15) and (3, 21). Then, the slope of the line is

$$m = \frac{ 21 - 15}{3 - 4} = \frac{6}{-1} = -6.$$

    Since the slope is negative, the direction of the line is decreasing. Since |m|>1, this decline is fairly steep (decline >45°).


Algebra and geometry

-   If _y_ is a linear function of _x_, then the coefficient of _x_ is the slope of the line created by plotting the function. Therefore, if the equation of the line is given in the form

_y_ = _m__x_ + _k_

    then _m_ is the slope. This form of a line's equation is called the _slope-intercept form_, because _k_ can be interpreted as the y-intercept of the line, that is, the _y_-coordinate where the line intersects the _y_-axis.

-   If the slope _m_ of a line and a point (_x_₁,_y_₁) on the line are both known, then the equation of the line can be found using the point-slope formula:

_y_ − _y_₁ = _m_(_x_ − _x_₁).

-   The slope of the line defined by the linear equation

_a__x_ + _b__y_ + _c_ = 0

    is
    $$-\frac {a}{b}$$
    .

-   Two lines are parallel if and only if they are not the same line (coincident) and either their slopes are equal or they both are vertical and therefore both have undefined slopes. Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is −1 or one has a slope of 0 (a horizontal line) and the other has an undefined slope (a vertical line).
-   The angle θ between −90° and 90° that a line makes with the _x_-axis is related to the slope _m_ as follows:

_m_ = tan (_θ_)

    and
    _θ_ = arctan (_m_)
      (this is the inverse function of tangent; see inverse trigonometric functions).

Examples

For example, consider a line running through the points (2,8) and (3,20). This line has a slope, , of

$$\frac {(20 - 8)}{(3 - 2)} \; = 12.$$
One can then write the line's equation, in point-slope form:

_y_ − 8 = 12(_x_ − 2) = 12_x_ − 24
or:

_y_ = 12_x_ − 16.
The angle θ between -90° and 90° that this line makes with the -axis is

_θ_ = arctan (12) ≈ 85.2^(∘) .

Consider the two lines: and . Both lines have slope . They are not the same line. So they are parallel lines.

Consider the two lines and . The slope of the first line is . The slope of the second line is . The product of these two slopes is −1. So these two lines are perpendicular.


Statistics

In statistical mathematics, the gradient of the line of best fit for a given distribution of data which is linear, numerical, and free of outliers, is usually written as $b = \frac{rs_y}{s_x}$, where b is defined as the gradient (in statistics), r is Pearson's correlation coefficient, s_(y) is the standard deviation of the y-values and s_(x) is the standard deviation of the x-values.[5]

In this equation y = a + bx for the least-squares regression line, b is the slope and a is the intercept.


Slope of a road or railway

    _Main articles: Grade (slope), Grade separation_

There are two common ways to describe the steepness of a road or railroad. One is by the angle between 0° and 90° (in degrees), and the other is by the slope in a percentage. See also steep grade railway and rack railway.

The formulae for converting a slope given as a percentage into an angle in degrees and vice versa are:

$$\text{angle} = \arctan \left( \frac{\text{slope}}{100\%} \right)$$
 , (this is the inverse function of tangent; see trigonometry)

    and
    slope = 100% ⋅ tan (angle),

where _angle_ is in degrees and the trigonometric functions operate in degrees. For example, a slope of 100% or 1000‰ is an angle of 45°.

A third way is to give one unit of rise in say 10, 20, 50 or 100 horizontal units, e.g. 1:10. 1:20, 1:50 or 1:100 (or _"1 in 10"_, _"1 in 20"_ etc.) Note that 1:10 is steeper than 1:20. For example, steepness of 20% means 1:5 or an incline with angle 11,3°.

Roads and railways have both longitudinal slopes and cross slopes.

Calculus

Tangent_function_animation.gif is the slope of a line that is tangent to the curve at that point. Note: the derivative at the point A is positive where green and dash-dot, negative where red and dashed, and zero where black and solid.]] The concept of a slope is central to differential calculus. For non-linear functions, the rate of change varies along the curve. The derivative of the function at a point is the slope of the line tangent to the curve at the point, and is thus equal to the rate of change of the function at that point.

If we let Δ_x_ and Δ_y_ be the distances (along the _x_ and _y_ axes, respectively) between two points on a curve, then the slope given by the above definition,

$$m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$
,

is the slope of a secant line to the curve. For a line, the secant between any two points is the line itself, but this is not the case for any other type of curve.

For example, the slope of the secant intersecting _y_ = _x_² at (0,0) and (3,9) is 3. (The slope of the tangent at is also 3—_a_ consequence of the mean value theorem.)

By moving the two points closer together so that Δ_y_ and Δ_x_ decrease, the secant line more closely approximates a tangent line to the curve, and as such the slope of the secant approaches that of the tangent. Using differential calculus, we can determine the limit, or the value that Δ_y_/Δ_x_ approaches as Δ_y_ and Δ_x_ get closer to zero; it follows that this limit is the exact slope of the tangent. If _y_ is dependent on _x_, then it is sufficient to take the limit where only Δ_x_ approaches zero. Therefore, the slope of the tangent is the limit of Δ_y_/Δ_x_ as Δ_x_ approaches zero, or _dy_/_dx_. We call this limit the derivative.

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$

Its value at a point on the function gives us the slope of the tangent at that point. For example, let _y_=_x_². A point on this function is (-2,4). The derivative of this function is ^(d_y_)/_(d_x_)=2_x_. So the slope of the line tangent to _y_ at (-2,4) is 2·(-2) = -4. The equation of this tangent line is: _y_-4=(-4)(_x_-(-2)) or _y_ = -4_x_ - 4.


Other generalizations

The concept of slope can be generalized to functions of more than one variable and is more often referred to as gradient.
