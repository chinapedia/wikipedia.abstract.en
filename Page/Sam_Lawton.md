Appearance

_Final Destination 5_

Sam is an office worker at Presage Paper and a trainee chef who has dreams of going to Paris to be an apprentice for his mentor. While on his way to a corporate retreat, Sam has a premonition that the North Bay bridge will collapse, and manages to convince his co-workers to leave the bus before the accident occurs. He later learns that Death is still after them, and he and his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper attempt to save the remaining survivors. In the film's climax, he tries to stop an enraged Peter from killing Molly by stabbing him in the back with a large skewer. He assumes that he has "claimed" Agent Jim Block's life (whom Peter killed), and has cheated Death by adding years to his own life. Two weeks later, he and Molly board a plane to Paris which is later revealed to be Flight 180, and he is incinerated when the plane explodes in midair.
