RESONATOR is Kathryn Williams 13th studio album and a collaboration with jazz musician and vibraphone player, Anthony Kerr. The album is a set of jazz standards that the pair worked on over a six-year period [1]

The album has received mixed reviews with _Musik-Express_ claimed the album 'liberates oft-heard standards from the corset of arbitrariness'[2] with _Intro_ adding 'Only an muted jazz trumpet and a distant double bass enrich the charged silence which often ends in unexpected slowness'.[3] Williams asserted on The Afterword podcast that 'I don't mind the different reactions that the album has got because it makes me feel like I'm doing something right.'
