EXTRATORRENT (commonly abbreviated ET) was an online index of digital content of entertainment media and software. Until its shut down it was among the top 5 BitTorrent indexes in the world, where visitors could search, download and contribute magnet links and torrent files, which facilitate peer-to-peer file sharing among users of the BitTorrent protocol.


History

ExtraTorrent was founded in 2006 by the administrator who acted under the alias "SaM".[1]

In November 2016, the website celebrated their 10-year anniversary. The website briefly changed their logo with a celebratory theme and launched a contest for users to guess the most downloaded movies on the site in exchange for prizes.[2]

On 17 May 2017, ExtraTorrent voluntarily ceased operations out of the blue. The entire website was replaced with a message from the administrator, stating that the website was to shut down permanently (as well as all mirror domains), and wipe all data relating to the website and its content.[3][4] The website was already down for days due to an emergency maintenance situation, just two days before the website shut down permanently.[5]

At the time of its shutdown, ExtraTorrent's primary domain name was the 291st most viewed website globally, according to statistics from Alexa Internet.[6]


Clones

Shortly after the shutdown of the official ExtraTorrent website, multiple clones and imitations appeared online.[7] Initially, the most popular one of these clones was located at EXTRATORRENT.CD. While this was at first speculated to be an official rehosting,[8] it was later discovered to be a re-skinned proxy of The Pirate Bay, serving exact information from their database, under an ExtraTorrent interface.[9][10] Despite this however, the website still quickly gained a large userbase, reaching two million unique visitors in May 2017.[11] To date, there are no new "official" ExtraTorrent mirrors as the database for the original was wiped during its shutdown in 2017.[12] The site was blocked in Spain in 2019, with the blocking of other similar websites such as Lime Torrents and 1337x.[13] Another one of these prominent imitators is EXTRATORRENT.AG, a website that has connections to the operator of EZTV.AG (another clone website of the also defunct EZTV release group).
