DUANE A. DAVIDSON (born June 6, 1959) is the Washington State Treasurer, and was elected in November 2016, and took office in January 2017.


Early life

Davidson was born and raised in the Snoqualmie Valley near the town of Carnation, WA into a family involved in dairy farming, logging and other small businesses. He graduated from Tolt High School, in Carnation. He started his undergraduate education at Bellevue Community College and transferred to Central Washington University in Ellensburg where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Accounting.


Career

Davidson is an actively licensed certified public accountant (CPA). Before winning the statewide post, he was elected to four terms as Treasurer of Benton County, Washington. He took that office following his initial election in 2003.[1]

Immediately prior to being elected as Benton County Treasurer, Duane was the Chief Financial Accountant for the county. Earlier in his career, as auditor for the Washington State Auditor’s Office, he served as the Assistant Audit Manager in the Tri-Cities in charge of the Walla Walla regional offices.


Election to State Office

In the 2016 elections, three Democrats ran in the state's blanket primary, splitting the Democratic vote across three candidates, thus allowing the two Republican candidates to advance to the general election. Davidson was elected state treasurer by winning 58% of the statewide vote against another Republican.[2]


Responsibilities of Washington State Treasurer

Core duties of the Washington State Treasurer's Office include cash management, investments, and debt management.[3] Under state law, the Treasurer also chairs the State Finance Committee, which reviews and authorizes debt issuances approved by lawmakers, and the Public Deposit Protection Commission. Additionally, the Treasurer serves on five other state boards or committees. These bodies have assigned duties relating to aspects of the economy, the state budget process, college savings plans, housing affordability, and investments made on behalf of public sector employees.[4]


Financial Education

Davidson has said his agenda as State Treasurer includes emphasizing financial education for consumers, and particularly students. In a May, 2017 visit to the Yakima, Wash. area, he visited a Junior Achievement program focusing on financial education and emphasized the utility of successful learning models already in use, rather than the development of new curricula by state agencies.[5]


State Debt Concerns

Davidson has raised concerns about Washington state's total outstanding debt, and annual debt service costs.[6] Currently state debt is almost $20 billion, and annual state debt service costs are about $2 billion.[7] He has said he intends to issue the annual report from the Treasurer's Office on the state's debt position earlier in the year than the historical release date in December - one month prior to the start of the annual legislative session - and have the copies sent directly to the homes of lawmakers, so that they will pay more attention to the findings.[8]

During Davidson's tenure as Benton County Treasurer, available public documents show that total outstanding year-end debt dropped from $24.4 million as of December 31, 2012 [9] to $12.6 million as of December 31, 2016.[10]


Family, and Professional and Community Service

He and his wife Kathy (deceased 2016), raised three children together – daughters Bailey (Young) and Kinzey, and son Luke – in the Tri-Cities. While a county treasurer, Davidson served three terms as President of the Washington State Association of County Treasurers (WSACT) and earlier served as the organization’s treasurer. Davidson is a long-time Kiwanian. He is the past-president for two separate Kiwanis Clubs in the Tri-Cities and served as treasurer for the Kiwanis Club of Tri-Cities Industry Foundation.[11]
