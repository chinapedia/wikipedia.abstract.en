_EUCALYPTUS CRUCIS_ is a species of mallee that is endemic in Western Australia. There are three subspecies, commonly known as SILVER MALLEE or SOUTHERN CROSS MALLEE, (subspecies _crucis_), NARROW-LEAVED SILVER MALLEE, (subsp. _lanceolata_) and PAYNES FIND MALLEE, (subsp. _praecipua_).[1][2] It has rough bark that is shed in curling flakes, more or less round, glaucous juvenile leaves, egg-shaped intermediate leaves and lance-shaped adult leaves. The type of bark and the proportion of juvenile, intermediate and adult leaves in the crown of mature plants varies with subspecies. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils, the flowers are whitish to pale yellow and the fruit is a conical to hemispherical capsule.


Description

_Eucalyptus crucis_ is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rich, reddish brown, fibrous bark that in several subspecies is shed in curling "minni ritchi" patches about wide. Young plants, coppice regrowth, and sometimes the crown of mature trees have sessile, usually glaucous, more or less round leaves arranged in opposite pairs, long and wide. Intermediate leaves are arranged more or less in opposite pairs or alternately, egg-shaped to lance-shaped, up to long and wide with a short petiole. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long.[3][4][5][6][7]

The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are more or less oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum long. Flowering occurs between September and March and the fruit is a woody cup-shaped to hemispherical capsule long and wide.[8][9][10]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus crucis_ was first formally described in 1923 by Joseph Maiden from a specimen collected near Southern Cross by Henry Steedman in 1922. Maiden published the description in his book _A Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus_.[11][12] The specific epithet (_crucis_) is a Latin word meaning "cross",[13] referring to the type location.[14]

In 1982, Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper described two subspecies, _crucis_ and _lanceolata_, and in 1993 they described subspecies _praecipua_. The three subspecies have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census.

-   _Eucalyptus crucis_ subsp. _crucis_[15] has a crown composed of glaucous juvenile leaves;[16]
-   _Eucalyptus crucis_ subsp. _lanceolata_[17] has a crown of greyish green adult leaves;[18]
-   _Eucalyptus crucis_ subsp. _praecipua_[19] has a crown of adult leaves but they are larger than in subspecies _lanceolata_ and the bark is only the "minni ritchi" type on the thinner branches.[20]


Distribution and habitat

Silver mallee is found in an area in the Goldfields-Esperance and Wheatbelt region of Western Australia where it grows in sandy, clay or loam soils amongst granite outcrops.[21] It is associated with sheoak (_Allocasuarina_ species), wattle (_Acacia_ species) and one-sided bottlebrush (_Calothamnus_ species).[22]

Subspecies _crucis_ is only found between Merredin, Southern Cross and Westonia, subspecies _lanceolata_ between Corrigin, Mount Churchman and Chiddarcooping Rock. Subspecies _praecipua_ is only known from near Paynes Find.[23]


Conservation status

Subspecies _lanceolata_ is classified as "not threatened"[24] but subspecies _crucis_[25] and _praecipua_[26] are classified as "Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora â€” Extant)" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia). Subspecies _crucis_ (silver mallee) is also listed as "vulnerable" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The main threats to this subspeces are recreational activities, pipeline maintenance, grazing and weed invasion.[27]


Use in horticulture

This eucalypt is frost and drought tolerant and is suitable for alkaline soils. It is commonly used as a windbreak, a street tree, for its decorative fruit, for erosion control, and as a honey producing or bird nesting plant.[28]
