The DIVINE FALLACY is an informal fallacy that often happens when people say something must be the result of superior, divine, alien or supernatural causes because it is unimaginable for it not to be so.[1] A similar fallacy, known as ARGUMENT FROM INCREDULITY, APPEAL TO COMMON SENSE, or PERSONAL INCREDULITY,[2] asserts that because something is so incredible or difficult to imagine, it is wrong. Arguments from incredulity are called non sequiturs.[3] Arguments from incredulity can take the form:

1.  I cannot imagine how F could be true; therefore F must be false.
2.  I cannot imagine how F could be false; therefore F must be true.[4]

Arguments from incredulity can sometimes arise from inappropriate emotional involvement, the conflation of fantasy and reality, a lack of understanding, or an instinctive 'gut' reaction, especially where time is scarce.[5]
