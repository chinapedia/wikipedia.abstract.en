Kaleidoscope was formed in 1988 by television enthusiasts to show appreciation and to research vintage television shows. In late 2013, ten years after Bob Monkhouse died, a large number of television and radio programmes were donated to Kaleidoscope from Monkhouse's archive.[4]

From 1993, along with the British Film Institute Kaleidoscope have been running a campaign called Missing, Believed Wiped (sometimes called: Raiders of the Lost Archive).[5][6][7][8] The campaign has led to numerous episodes being recovered from Steptoe and Son, Dad's Army, a Dennis Potter play and more than sixty classics BBC or ITV programmes from 1957 to 1969 in the Library of Congress[9][10]
