Centennialphoto.jpg The NINOY AQUINO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TERMINAL 2 (NAIA-2), in Pasay City, Metro Manila, Philippines, (also known as CENTENNIAL TERMINAL), has an area of , and is located on NAIA Road. It began construction in December 1995 and was inaugurated on May 1, 1999[1] and began operations in 1999. It has been named the Centennial Terminal in commemoration of the centennial year of the declaration of Philippine independence. The terminal was originally designed by Aéroports de Paris to be a domestic terminal, but the design was later modified to accommodate international flights.[2] It has a capacity of 2.5 million passengers per year in its international wing and 5 million in its domestic wing. It is able to be modified to accommodate nine million passengers per year if needed.[3]


Operations

Terminal 2 is exclusively used by Philippine Airlines and PAL Express for both its domestic and international flights. It is divided into two wings: the North Wing, for international flights, and the South Wing, which handles domestic operations. It currently has 12 air bridges. There are several cafes and restaurants in the Terminal post-security. There is also a small duty-free section in the north wing. The need for two more terminals was proposed by a Master Plan Review of the Airport that was undertaken in 1989 by Aéroports de Paris. The study was facilitated by means of a grant from the French Government. The review cost 2.9 million French francs and was submitted to the Philippine Government for evaluation in 1990.


History

Early years

The site of Terminal 2 used to be the site of the original terminal of what was then the Manila International Airport. The structure was destroyed by fire in 1972 and was replaced by a slightly smaller terminal, designed by National Artist for Architecture, Leandro Locsin, Sr. The small terminal was the international airport until its conversion to a domestic terminal upon the opening of what is now the present-day Terminal 1 in the year 1981. Another fire destroyed the domestic terminal in 1987.

1990s

In 1991, the French government granted a 30 million franc soft loan to the Philippine government, which was to be used to cover the Detailed Architectural and Engineering Design of the NAIA Terminal 2. ADP completed the design in 1992 and in 1994, the Japanese Government granted an 18.12 billion yen soft loan to the Philippine Government to finance 75% of the terminal's construction costs and 100% of the supervision costs. Construction of the terminal began on December 11, 1995, and was formally turned over to the government of the Philippines on December 28, 1998. The Centennial Terminal became fully operational by 1999.[4]

2000s

On August 2014, DOTC formally announced the plan of expanding of Terminal 2. The plan also considers to build a structure interconnecting Terminals 1 and 2.[5] It also includes the demolition of the unused Philippine Village Hotel complex beside the terminal awaiting the fixing of certain issues.[6] A fuel depot located between the terminals will be transferred to the demolished area to give way for the expansion.[7] The 26 comfort rooms are being renovated, in which 16 are located in a passenger movement area.[8] 4 of the 7 Air handling units are being repaired and 21 additional units are expected to be installed to improve the temperature in the Terminal.[9]
