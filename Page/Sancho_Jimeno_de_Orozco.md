SANCHO JIMENO (born as Sancho Jimeno de Orozco y Urnieta; 1640 in Hondarribia, Spain) was a governor of Cartagena, Colombia, between 1693 and 1695 and later, lord of the Castle of San Luis in the island of Tierrabomba, fort that was defended by him during the Raid of Cartagena in 1697. After the escape of Governor Diego de los Rios, Don Sancho was called to govern Cartagena between 1698 and 1699.


Life

In accordance with Rodolfo Segovia[1] and Soledad Acosta de Samper,[2] Don Sancho Jimeno de Orozco, was a Spanish nobleman of a become impoverished family of the Basque Country. He served as a page of John of Austria The Younger, and fought if the Spanish Netherlands wars. Later he traveled to Cartagena in the Americas in 1670. He married Maria Ines Blanco de Salcedo y Fernandez Calvo and had one child, Maria Teresa Jimeno Orozco y Blanco de Salcedo who married in the 18th century with Juan Fernandez de Miranda Gandarillas whose descendants formed part of the most important families of the Colombian Caribbean zone until now.

Don Sancho Jimeno was owner of farms near Cartagena, where he had cattle and slaves. He is recognized to have fought the runaway slaves in the surrounding area of Cartagena, because they would attempt to liberate other slaves and steal from the travelers.[3]

After his government of Cartagena between 1693 and 1695, he was designated as the Lord of the Castle of San Luis de Bocachica since 1695. Was in those time, when the castle was attacked by the French and pirate forces of the Baron of Pointis and the freebooter Ducasse in April 1697.


The defense of the Castle of San Luis de Bocachica

On 13 April 1697, 29 ships of Pointis fleet were seen from Bocachica.[4] They landed troops in the coast of the island of Tierra Bomba and sieged the castle, preventing the arrive of reinforcements. Although it was known by the Spanish about the French attack, because spies have discovered the departure of the fleet from the port of Brest in January, the city of Cartagena and its forts were poor prepared when the pirates arrived. In the castle of San Luis were only 139 men, some Spanish soldiers and most of them slaves, with enough weapons and gunpowder, but with few foodstuffs. The food supply was arriving just when the pirates surrounded the castle in two small ships that was sunk. On 15 April 1697, the fort was bombarded by the French warships each one with 80 cannons. The slaves rise up, asking to accept the defeat when the pirates reach the drawbridge. Don Sancho denied surrender the castle, despite the rebellion, so the French had to capture him inside the fortress being alone. When he was captured, he denied to surrender the castle of San Luis de Bocachica, action that was considered admirable by Pointis. According to the popular legend, Don Sancho, to not accept the defeat, broke his sword as Lord of the Castle.

Pointis wanted to honor Jimeno's bravery, so the French Baron gave him his own sword.[5]

Captured by the French, Pointis granted to Don Sancho a prison in his own farm in Isla Baru, where he was brought by a French guard. He was held as a prisoner until the French left Cartagena starting June 1697.

Don Sancho was designated again governor of Cartagena in 1698, after the escape of the former governor Don Diego de Los Rios, who has handed over the city to the French in May 1697 without fighting.

At the beginning of the 18th century, Don Sancho was judged by the Spanish tribunals, by the suspect that the Spanish public servants were corrupted by French spies before the attack and the story of the sword of Pointis was an evidence against Don Sancho. After many years through the penal process, he was declared innocent.
