EMERALD CITY FOOTBALL CLUB (ECFC) is a Seattle-based select soccer club. ECFC is a premier year-round soccer club with professional coaching. It is one of Seattle's oldest select soccer clubs, having formed in 1979.[1] ECFC is a non-profit, 501c3 organization largely run by volunteers. ECFC teams compete with other premier clubs in Washington State in the Puget Sound Premier League (PSPL[2]). ECFC players come from all different neighborhoods in the Seattle and Puget Sound region, rather than from one specific geographical area. ECFC is a member of US Club Soccer.[3]
