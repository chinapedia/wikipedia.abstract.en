The REEVES FARMSTEAD HISTORIC DISTRICT is a nationally recognized historic district located north of Le Mars, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.[1] At the time of its nomination the district consisted of 13 resources, including 11 contributing buildings, one non-contributing building, and one non-contributing object.[2] The contributing buildings include an American Four Square house, a barn, cob house and wash house, hen house, outhouse, machine shed, corn crib, two hog houses, and a garage. The non-contributing building is a second garage built in the late 20th century, and the non-contributing object is an incomplete wind mill. The buildings were all built in the late 19th- or early 20th century, but exact dates are uncertain.[3] The fully integrated farmstead from the early to mid 20th century features buildings that utilize simple architecture that was typical of many Iowa farms.
