LAS DERRUMBADAS (from Spanish, meaning 'the collapsed ones' or 'the ones that suffered a stonefall') is a rhyolitic twin dome volcano[1] in the Mexican state of Puebla. Often overlooked for its proximity to some of the country's most famous mountains —including Cofre de Perote, Sierra Negra and colossal Pico de Orizaba— its two summits are nevertheless within the top 30 of the country's highest mountain peaks.

Officially, both mountains are individually called _Cerro Derrumbadas_. To distinguish them, they are called _Derrumbada Roja_ or _Derrumbada de Fuego_ (Red or Fire Derrumbada, southeastern cone, 3480 m a.s.l.), and _Derrumbada Azul_ or _Derrumbada de Agua_ (Blue or Water Derrumbada, northwestern cone, 3420 m a.s.l.) by the locals. A third mountain, nearby Cerro Pinto, is often included in the Derrumbadas complex, under the name of _Derrumbada Blanca_ (White Derrumbada, 3000 m a.s.l.).

Due to the volcano's fumarolic activity, it has been studied and proposed as a source of geothermal energy.[2]
