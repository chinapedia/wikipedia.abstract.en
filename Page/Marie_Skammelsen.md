Career

2014–16: Junior career

2014

In September, Skammelsen competed at the 2014 Northern European Gymnastics Championships, which were held in Greve, Denmark.[9] With her team, she took a silver medal, and an eleventh place finish in the all-around standings.[10] She advanced to the vault event final and finished in second place position.[11]

2015

Skammelsen participated in the 2015 European Youth Summer Olympic Festival in the summer of 2015, where she travelled to Tbilisi, Georgia.[12] In the qualification round, she finished thirty-sixth which didn't advance her through to the all-around final; she did make the vault final though. In the vault final, she finished fifth.[13]

Later in the year, in mid-September, Skammelsen participated in the 2015 Northern European Gymnastics Championships in Limerick, Ireland.[14] She took an eighth place finish in the all-around standings, in addition to three event finals.[15] In the event finals, Skammelsen took home two bronze medals; one on vault and one on balance beam, as well as a fourth place finish on floor.

2016

Skammelsen became the Danish Junior Champion in the all-around in April.[16] She claimed additional titles on the vault and floor too.

In May, she travelled to Reykjavik, Iceland for the 2016 Nordic Championships.[17] At the championships, she was crowned the junior Nordic all-around champion.[18] She also captured Junior Nordic titles on vault and floor, in addition to medals on the remaining two events.

A month later, in June, she journeyed to Bern for the 2016 European Artistic Gymnastics Championships. The qualification round saw Skammelsen advance to the all-around final in one of the final qualification spots.[19] She also qualified to the vault event final, taking the seventh place in the quota.[20] In the all-around final, Skammelsen finished twentieth in the field of twenty-four.[21] Soon after, she participated in the vault final where she over-performed to a finish of fourth place.[22]

2017–present: Senior career

Skammelsen becomes a senior gymnast in 2017, and has openly set her immediate sights on participating at the 2017 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.[23] Her more long-term goal is to make the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan – a participation from Skammelsen in these games would be the first of any Danish gymnast since 1976.[24]
