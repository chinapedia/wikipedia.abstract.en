The DIOCESAN MUSEUM OF PADUA was founded in 2000 in the bishop's residence which was constructed in the 15th century, but which has a foundation dating from the beginning of the 14th century. The building, close to the cathedral in the _Piazza del Duomo_, can be found in the historic center of the city which is the capital of the comune of Padua.


Works

Works of the museum come from the cathedral, dedicated to Mary's Assumption, and from other diocesan churches, and date from the 9th to the 19th centuries. These works can be found on two separate floors and are ordered chronologicallyl and by type.

The Hall of St. Gregory Barbarigo

On the first floor, chiefly for use by scholars due to the presence of the chapter library and the diocesan archives, is a room named for St. Gregory Barbarigo, bishop of Padua (1664 - 1697), which contains several accounts of the diocese's library and of the cathedral's _scriptorium_. Of special interest are documents pertaining to the renaissance library of bishops Iaocopo Zeno and Pietro Barozzi:

-   _illuminations_ (14th century);
-   _incunabola_ (15th century);
-   _books and prints_ (prior to the 16th century).

The actual diocesan museum is found on the second floor of the building.

The salon of the bishops and chapel of St. Mary of the Angels

The most important part of the museum's itinerary is the monumental and luxurious salon of the bishops, in which are presented:

-   ''a cycle of portraits of Padua's bishops ''(from the 16th century), frescoed on the walls by Bartolomeo Montagna but reworked and completed in the subsequent centuries. Represented here are the first one hundred bishops of Padua, beginning with San Prosdocimo and arriving at Pietro Barozzi, who commissioned the work.
-   a fresco containing a portrait Francesco Petrarca, removed from the poet's house in Padua
-   a mosaic of the _Madonna with child_, from the middle of the 15th century, recovered after the demolition of the church of Saint Job in Padua in 1810.

Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries this room slowly deteriorated, and was returned to its original splendor with its latest restoration in 2006.

On the north-east side of the salon is the entrance to the chapel of _Saint Mary of the Angels_, built in 1495 by architect Lorenzo da Bologna at the bidding of Pietro Barozzi, bishop of Padua from 1487-1507. The frescos by Prospero da Piazzola and Jacopo da Montagnana follow an iconographic program centered on the Apostles' Creed. On the main altar is found:

-   the triptych of Jacopo da Montagnana which includes _the Annunciation, St. Michael the archangel and St. Rafael the archangel._

The Treasure of the cathedral

The oldest liturgical items are found in the Treasure of the cathedral and include:

-   an silver inkwell (9th century) that was later transformed into a chrismarium;
-   a formella with _Jesus giving a blessing_ (11th century), made of soapstone;
-   a processional cross (1228);
-   the cover of an evangelario (13th century), from the church of Santa Giustina (Monselice).
