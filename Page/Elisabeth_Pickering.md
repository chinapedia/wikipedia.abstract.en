Biography

Magna_Carta_-_colophon_-_Pickering_1540-1.png from _The Great Charter, Called in Latin Magna Carta_, London: Elizabeth Pickering, 1540/41]] Elisabeth Pickering is known as the wife and, on his death in October/November 1540, widow, of Robert Redman, a printer of law books in London since 1525. Thirteen editions of Redman books were printed, eleven under Pickerings name, within nine-months of his death, including an edition of the Magna Carta.[2] Thereafter she sold the printing business to one William Middleton.[3] She is reputed by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography to have been the first English woman to print books under her maiden name; James Raven asserts that "as early as 1527-8 a widow is recorded as printing in York", and terms Pickering as 'the best-known early press woman'.[4]

Elisabeth Pickering was married four times; to a Mr. Jackson, with issue Lucy and Elizabeth, prior to her marriage in 1537[5] to Redman, with issue Alice and Matilda. After Redman's death she married William Cholmeley, a lawyer who may, according to the ODNB have been involved in a 1542 attempt by the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers to be incorporated in London. After William's death she married his relation Ranulph Cholmeley, who from 1553 to 1663 was Recorder of London and thereafter Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. This Cholmeley was responsible for the successful incorporation of the Stationers, and the ODNB suggests that Elisabeth's interest in the matter was related to both Cholmeley's actions.[6]

Elisabeth Pickering died in October 1562.[7]
