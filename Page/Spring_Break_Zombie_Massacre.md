Production

Sam Suchmann and Mattie Zufelt, both of whom have Down syndrome, met at the Special Olympics. Sam's older brother, Jesse, said their families initially viewed the friends' enthusiasm for a film as a phase the two would eventually outgrow. When they did not, Jesse investigated further, finding that they had written a notebook full of scenes, including storyboards.[1] Jesse initially considered shooting the film do-it-yourself style but was impressed enough with their work that he took the film to Kickstarter, where it received $68,000 in funding.[2] Taking the position of producer, Jesse brought in director Bobby Carnevale, whom he had been friends with in high school.[3] Filming took place over 16 days in Providence, Rhode Island. The Kickstarter campaign and resulting publicity resulted in increased interest in the film, and industry veterans like Farrelly brothers visited the set.[4] Casting involved diverse groups of people. Some of the extras are friends on the autism spectrum or with Downs,[5] and some auditioned after discovering the project. Other talent came from Atlanta, where director Carnevale had contacts.[6] Pauly D, a hero to Mattie, accepted a cameo role after the friends insisted that he be approached.[7] Jesse said the film was Sam and Mattie's project, and they were not simply helped by a professional film crew.[8] A sequel is planned.[9]


Release

_Spring Break Zombie Massacre_ premiered on July 7, 2016, in Providence, Rhode Island.[10] It later played at the Telluride Film Festival in October 2016.[11]


Reception

Steve Hartman of CBS News called it "really gross in parts, terribly offensive in others and completely ludicrous throughout", concluding that it is a future cult film.[12]
