The 46TH GUILLERMO MENDOZA MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION BOX OFFICE ENTERTAINMENT AWARDS (GMMSF-BOEA), honored the personalities, movies and TV programs in the Philippines, and took place on June 14, 2015 at the Solaire Resort & Casino, Parañaque City. The award-giving body honors Filipino actors, actresses and other performers' commercial success, regardless of artistic merit, in the Philippine entertainment industry.[1]


Winners selection

The GMMSF selects the high-ranking Philippine films of 2014 based on total average rankings at box office published results (MMFF has not released the final gross tally for the 2014 edition.) as basis for awarding the three major categories in the awarding ceremonies, The Phenomenal Box Office Star, The Box Office King and The Box Office Queen.[2]

The deliberations were held at the Barrio Fiesta Restaurant in Greenhills, San Juan on May 16, 2015 attended by the representatives of GMMSF.[3] New Special Awards were introduced at this event. This includes the Corazon Mendoza Samaniego Lifetime Achievement Award, which was given to Vic Sotto. Also included in the new Special Awards were the Breakthrough Box Office Indie Film Award, as well as the All-Time Highest Grossing Horror Film Award.
