Pitchfork wrote "it is superbly written and performed. Saba is a crafty storyteller who makes full use of his long memory and slithering wordplay."[9] Finishing 12th on _Rolling Stone_'s list of 40 Best Rap Albums of 2016, Saba "successfully mashes of-the-moment hip-hop and atmospheric, live-band funk textures."[10] Consequence of Sound compared _Bucket List Project_ to Kendrick Lamar, writing "Saba maintained a precocious mastery of his craft with windingly poetic flows over murky, subdued beats, not too far removed from Kendrick Lamar circa _Section 80_."[11]
