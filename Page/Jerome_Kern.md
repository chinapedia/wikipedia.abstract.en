Jerome-Kern-1934.jpg JEROME DAVID KERN (January 27, 1885 – November 11, 1945) was an American composer of musical theatre and popular music. One of the most important American theatre composers of the early 20th century, he wrote more than 700 songs, used in over 100 stage works, including such classics as "Ol' Man River", "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man", "A Fine Romance", "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes", "The Song Is You", "All the Things You Are", "The Way You Look Tonight", "Long Ago (and Far Away)" and "Who?". He collaborated with many of the leading librettists and lyricists of his era, including George Grossmith Jr., Guy Bolton, P. G. Wodehouse, Otto Harbach, Oscar Hammerstein II, Dorothy Fields, Johnny Mercer, Ira Gershwin and Yip Harburg.

A native New Yorker, Kern created dozens of Broadway musicals and Hollywood films in a career that lasted for more than four decades. His musical innovations, such as 4/4 dance rhythms and the employment of syncopation and jazz progressions, built on, rather than rejected, earlier musical theatre tradition. He and his collaborators also employed his melodies to further the action or develop characterization to a greater extent than in the other musicals of his day, creating the model for later musicals. Although dozens of Kern's musicals and musical films were hits, only _Show Boat_ is now regularly revived. Songs from his other shows, however, are still frequently performed and adapted. Many of Kern's songs have been adapted by jazz musicians to become standard tunes.


Biography

Early life

Kern was born in New York City, on Sutton Place, in what was then the city's brewery district.[1] His parents were Henry Kern (1842–1908), a Jewish German immigrant, and Fannie Kern _née_ Kakeles (1852–1907), who was an American Jew of Bohemian parentage.[2] At the time of Kern's birth, his father ran a stable; later he became a successful merchant.[3] Kern grew up on East 56th Street in Manhattan, where he attended public schools. He showed an early aptitude for music and was taught to play the piano and organ by his mother, an accomplished player and teacher.[4]

In 1897, the family moved to Newark, New Jersey, where Kern attended Newark High School (which became Barringer High School in 1907). He wrote songs for the school's first musical, a minstrel show, in 1901, and for an amateur musical adaptation of _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ put on at the Newark Yacht Club in January 1902.[5] Kern left high school before graduation in the spring of his senior year in 1902. In response, Kern's father insisted that his son work with him in business, instead of composing. Kern, however, failed miserably in one of his earliest tasks: he was supposed to purchase two pianos for the store, but instead he ordered 200.[6] His father relented, and later in 1902, Kern became a student at the New York College of Music, studying the piano under Alexander Lambert and Paolo Gallico, and harmony under Dr. Austin Pierce.[7] His first published composition, a piano piece, _At the Casino_, appeared in the same year. Between 1903 and 1905, he continued his musical training under private tutors in Heidelberg, Germany, returning to New York via London.[8][9]

First compositions

Angela_Lansbury_in_Till_the_Clouds_Roll_By.jpg sings "How'd you like to spoon with me?" in _Till the Clouds Roll By_ (1946)]] For a time, Kern worked as a rehearsal pianist in Broadway theatres and as a song-plugger for Tin Pan Alley music publishers. While in London, he secured a contract from the American impresario Charles Frohman to provide songs for interpolation in Broadway versions of London shows. He began to provide these additions in 1904 to British scores for _An English Daisy_, by Seymour Hicks and Walter Slaughter, and _Mr. Wix of Wickham_, for which he wrote most of the songs.[10]

In 1905, Kern contributed the song "How'd you like to spoon with me?" to Ivan Caryll's hit musical _The Earl and the Girl_ when the show transferred to Chicago and New York in 1905.[11] He also contributed to the New York production of _The Catch of the Season_ (1905), _The Little Cherub_ (1906) and _The Orchid_ (1907), among other shows.[12] From 1905 on, he spent long periods of time in London, contributing songs to West End shows like _The Beauty of Bath_ (1906; with lyricist P. G. Wodehouse) and making valuable contacts, including George Grossmith Jr. and Seymour Hicks, who were the first to introduce Kern's songs to the London stage.[13] In 1909 during one of his stays in England, Kern took a boat trip on the River Thames with some friends, and when the boat stopped at Walton-on-Thames, they went to an inn called the Swan for a drink. Kern was much taken with the proprietor's daughter, Eva Leale (1891–1959), who was working behind the bar. He wooed her, and they were married at the Anglican church of St. Mary's in Walton on October 25, 1910. The couple then lived at the Swan when Kern was in England.[14]

Mind_the_Paint.pdf, for whom Kern wrote stage and screen music]] Kern is believed to have composed music for silent films as early as 1912, but the earliest documented film music which he is known to have written was for a twenty-part serial, _Gloria's Romance_ in 1916.[15] This was one of the first starring vehicles for Billie Burke, for whom Kern had earlier written the song "Mind the Paint", with lyrics by A. W. Pinero. The film is now considered lost, but Kern's music survives. Another score for the silent movies, _Jubilo_, followed in 1919.[16] Kern was one of the founding members of ASCAP.[17]

Kern's first complete score was Broadway's _The Red Petticoat_ (1912), one of the first musical-comedy Westerns. The libretto was by Rida Johnson Young. By World War I, more than a hundred of Kern's songs had been used in about thirty productions, mostly Broadway adaptations of West End and European shows. Kern contributed two songs to _To-Night's the Night_ (1914), another Rubens musical. It opened in New York and went on to become a hit in London. The best known of Kern's songs from this period is probably "They Didn't Believe Me", which was a hit in the New York version of the Paul Rubens and Sidney Jones musical, _The Girl from Utah_ (1914), for which Kern wrote five songs.[18] Kern's song, with four beats to a bar, departed from the customary waltz-rhythms of European influence and fitted the new American passion for modern dances such as the fox-trot. He was also able to use elements of American styles, such as ragtime, as well as syncopation, in his lively dance tunes.[19] Theatre historian John Kenrick writes that the song put Kern in great demand on Broadway and established a pattern for musical comedy love songs that lasted through the 1960s.[20]

In May 1915, Kern was due to sail with Charles Frohman from New York to London on board the RMS _Lusitania_, but Kern missed the boat, having overslept after staying up late playing poker.[21] Frohman died in the sinking of the ship.[22]

Princess Theatre musicals

Jerome-Kern-1918.jpg Kern composed 16 Broadway scores between 1915 and 1920 and also contributed songs to the London hit _Theodore & Co_ (1916; most of the songs are by the young Ivor Novello) and to revues like the Ziegfeld Follies. The most notable of his scores were those for a series of shows written for the Princess Theatre, a small (299-seat) house built by Ray Comstock. Theatrical agent Elisabeth Marbury asked Kern and librettist Guy Bolton to create a series of intimate and low-budget, yet smart, musicals.[23]

The "Princess Theatre shows" were unique on Broadway not only for their small size, but their clever, coherent plots, integrated scores and naturalistic acting, which presented "a sharp contrast to the large-scale Ruritanian operettas then in vogue"[24] or the star-studded revues and extravaganzas of producers like Florenz Ziegfeld. Earlier musical comedy had often been thinly plotted, gaudy pieces, marked by the insertion of songs into their scores with little regard to the plot. But Kern and Bolton followed the examples of Gilbert and Sullivan and French _opéra bouffe_ in integrating song and story. "These shows built and polished the mold from which almost all later major musical comedies evolved. ... The characters and situations were, within the limitations of musical comedy license, believable and the humor came from the situations or the nature of the characters. Kern's exquisitely flowing melodies were employed to further the action or develop characterization."[25] The shows featured modern American settings and simple scene changes to suit the small theatre.[26]

An_Old-Fashioned_Wife_cover.jpg]] The team's first Princess Theatre show was an adaptation of Paul Rubens' 1905 London show, _Mr. Popple (of Ippleton)_, called _Nobody Home_ (1915).[27] The piece ran for 135 performances and was a modest financial success.[28] However, it did little to fulfill the new team's mission to innovate, except that Kern's song, "The Magic Melody", was the first Broadway showtune with a basic jazz progression.[29] Kern and Bolton next created an original piece, _Very Good Eddie_, which was a surprise hit, running for 341 performances, with additional touring productions that went on into the 1918-19 season.[30] The British humorist, lyricist and librettist P. G. Wodehouse joined the Princess team in 1917, adding his skill as a lyricist to the succeeding shows. _Oh, Boy!_ (1917) ran for an extraordinary 463 performances.[31][32] Other shows written for the theatre were _Have a Heart_ (1917), _Leave It to Jane_ (1917)[33] and _Oh, Lady! Lady!!_ (1918).[34] The first opened at another theatre before _Very Good Eddie_ closed. The second played elsewhere during the long run of _Oh Boy!_[35] An anonymous admirer wrote a verse in their praise[36] that begins: Not_Yet_cover.jpg'']]

In February 1918, Dorothy Parker wrote in _Vanity Fair_:

_Oh, Lady! Lady!!_ was the last successful "Princess Theatre show". Kern and Wodehouse disagreed over money, and the composer decided to move on to other projects.[37] Kern's importance to the partnership was illustrated by the fate of the last musical of the series, _Oh, My Dear!_ (1918), to which he contributed only one song: "Go, Little Boat". The rest of the show was composed by Louis Hirsch, and ran for 189 performances: "Despite a respectable run, everyone realized there was little point in continuing the series without Kern."[38]

Early 1920s

Marilyn_Miller.jpg, the star of _Sally_]] The 1920s were an extremely productive period in American musical theatre, and Kern created at least one show every year for the entire decade. His first show of 1920 was _The Night Boat_, with book and lyrics by Anne Caldwell, which ran for more than 300 performances in New York and for three seasons on tour.[39] Later in the same year, Kern wrote the score for _Sally_, with a book by Bolton and lyrics by Otto Harbach. This show, staged by Florenz Ziegfeld, ran for 570 performances, one of the longest runs of any Broadway show in the decade, and popularized the song "Look for the Silver Lining" (which had been written for an earlier show), performed by the rising star Marilyn Miller. It also had a long run in London in 1921, produced by George Grossmith, Jr.[40] Kern's next shows were _Good Morning, Dearie_ (1921, with Caldwell) which ran for 347 performances; followed in 1922 by a West End success, _The Cabaret Girl_ in collaboration with Grossmith and Wodehouse;[41] another modest success by the same team, _The Beauty Prize_ (1923); and a Broadway flop, _The Bunch and Judy_, remembered, if at all, as the first time Kern and Fred Astaire worked together.[42]

_Stepping Stones_ (1923, with Caldwell) was a success, and in 1924 the Princess Theatre team of Bolton, Wodehouse and Kern reunited to write _Sitting Pretty_, but it did not recapture the popularity of the earlier collaborations.[43] Its relative failure may have been partly due to Kern's growing aversion to having individual songs from his shows performed out of context on radio, in cabaret, or on record, although his chief objection was to jazz interpretations of his songs. He called himself a "musical clothier – nothing more or less," and said, "I write music to both the situations and the lyrics in plays."[44] When _Sitting Pretty_ was produced, he forbade any broadcasting or recording of individual numbers from the show, which limited their chance to gain popularity.[45]

1925 was a major turning point in Kern's career when he met Oscar Hammerstein II, with whom he would entertain a lifelong friendship and collaboration. As a young man, Kern had been an easy companion with great charm and humor, but he became less outgoing in his middle years, sometimes difficult to work with: he once introduced himself to a producer by saying, "I hear you're a son of a bitch. So am I."[46] He rarely collaborated with any one lyricist for long. With Hammerstein, however, he remained on close terms for the rest of his life.[47] Their first show, written together with Harbach, was _Sunny_, which featured the song "Who (Stole My Heart Away)?" Marilyn Miller played the title role, as she had in _Sally_.[48] The show ran for 517 performances on Broadway, and the following year ran for 363 performances in the West End, starring Binnie Hale and Jack Buchanan.[49]

_Show Boat_

Hammerstein.jpg, one of Kern's chief collaborators]] Because of the strong success of _Sally_ and _Sunny_ and consistent good results with his other shows, Ziegfeld was willing to gamble on Kern's next project in 1927. Kern had been impressed by Edna Ferber's novel _Show Boat_ and wished to present a musical stage version.[50] He persuaded Hammerstein to adapt it and Ziegfeld to produce it. The story, dealing with racism, marital strife and alcoholism, was unheard of in the escapist world of musical comedy. Despite his doubts, Ziegfeld spared no expense in staging the piece to give it its full epic grandeur. According to the theatre historian John Kenrick: "After the opening night audience filed out of the Ziegfeld Theatre in near silence, Ziegfeld thought his worst fears had been confirmed. He was pleasantly surprised when the next morning brought ecstatic reviews and long lines at the box office. In fact, _Show Boat_ proved to be the most lasting accomplishment of Ziegfeld's career – the only one of his shows that is regularly performed today."[51] The score is, arguably, Kern's greatest and includes the well-known songs "Ol' Man River" and "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" as well as "Make Believe", "You Are Love", "Life Upon the Wicked Stage", "Why Do I Love You", all with lyrics by Hammerstein, and "Bill", originally written for _Oh, Lady! Lady!_, with lyrics by P. G. Wodehouse.[52] The show ran for 572 performances on Broadway and was also a success in London.[53][54] Although Ferber's novel was filmed unsuccessfully as a part-talkie in 1929 (using some songs from the Kern score), the musical itself was filmed twice, in 1936, and, with Technicolor, in 1951.[55] In 1989, a stage version of the musical was presented on television for the first time, in a production from the Paper Mill Playhouse telecast by PBS on _Great Performances_.[56]

While most Kern musicals have largely been forgotten, except for their songs, _Show Boat_ remains well-remembered and frequently seen. It is a staple of stock productions and has been revived numerous times on Broadway and in London. A 1946 revival integrated choreography into the show, in the manner of a Rodgers and Hammerstein production, as did the 1994 Harold Prince–Susan Stroman revival, which was nominated for ten Tony Awards, winning five, including best revival. It was the first musical to enter a major opera company's repertory (New York City Opera, 1954), and the rediscovery of the 1927 score with Robert Russell Bennett's original orchestrations led to a large-scale EMI recording in 1987 and several opera-house productions.[57] In 1941, the conductor Artur Rodziński wished to commission a symphonic suite from the score, but Kern considered himself a songwriter and not a symphonist. He never orchestrated his own scores, leaving that to musical assistants, principally Frank Saddler (until 1921) and Russell Bennett (from 1923).[58] In response to the commission, Kern oversaw an arrangement by Charles Miller and Emil Gerstenberger of numbers from the show into the orchestral work _Scenario for Orchestra: Themes from Show Boat_, premiered in 1941 by the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Rodziński.[59][60]

Kathryn_Grayson_in_Show_Boat_trailer.jpg'']] Kern's last Broadway show in the 1920s was _Sweet Adeline_ (1929), with a libretto by Hammerstein. It was a period piece, set in the Gay 90s, about a girl from Hoboken, New Jersey (near Kern's childhood home), who becomes a Broadway star. Opening just before the stock market crash, it received rave reviews, but the elaborate, old-fashioned piece was a step back from the innovations in _Show Boat_, or even the Princess Theatre shows.[61] In January 1929, at the height of the Jazz Age, and with _Show Boat_ still playing on Broadway, Kern made news on both sides of the Atlantic for reasons wholly unconnected with music. He sold at auction, at New York's Anderson Galleries, the collection of English and American literature that he had been building up for more than a decade. The collection, rich in inscribed first editions and manuscript material of eighteenth and nineteenth century authors, sold for a total of $1,729,462.50 – a record for a single-owner sale that stood for over fifty years. Among the books he sold were first or early editions of poems by Robert Burns and Percy Bysshe Shelley, and works by Jonathan Swift, Henry Fielding and Charles Dickens, as well as manuscripts by Alexander Pope, John Keats, Shelley, Lord Byron, Thomas Hardy and others.[62][63][64]

First films and later shows

In 1929 Kern made his first trip to Hollywood to supervise the 1929 film version of _Sally_, one of the first "all-talking" Technicolor films. The following year, he was there a second time to work on _Men of the Sky_, released in 1931 without his songs, and a 1930 film version of _Sunny_.[65] There was a public reaction against the early glut of film musicals after the advent of film sound; Hollywood released more than 100 musical films in 1930, but only 14 in 1931.[66] Warner Bros. bought out Kern's contract, and he returned to the stage.[67] He collaborated with Harbach on the Broadway musical _The Cat and the Fiddle_ (1931), about a composer and an opera singer, featuring the songs "She Didn't Say Yes" and "The Night Was Made for Love". It ran for 395 performances, a remarkable success for the Depression years, and transferred to London the following year.[68] It was filmed in 1934 with Jeanette MacDonald.

_Music in the Air_ (1932) was another Kern-Hammerstein collaboration and another show-biz plot, best remembered today for "The Song Is You" and "I've Told Ev'ry Little Star". It was "undoubtedly an operetta", set in the German countryside, but without the Ruritanian trimmings of the operettas of Kern's youth.[69] _Roberta_ (1933) by Kern and Harbach included the songs "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes", "Let's Begin and "Yesterdays" and featured, among others, Bob Hope, Fred MacMurray, George Murphy and Sydney Greenstreet all in the early stages of their careers. Kern's _Three Sisters_ (1934), was his last West End show, with a libretto by Hammerstein. The musical, depicting horse-racing, the circus, and class distinctions, was a failure, running for only two months. Its song "I Won't Dance" was used in the film _Roberta_.[70][71] Some British critics objected to American writers essaying a British story;[72] James Agate, doyen of London theatre critics of the day, dismissed it as "American inanity,"[73] though both Kern and Hammerstein were strong and knowledgeable Anglophiles.[74] Kern's last Broadway show (other than revivals) was _Very Warm for May_ (1939), another show-biz story and another disappointment, although the score included the Kern and Hammerstein classic "All The Things You Are".[75]

Kern in Hollywood

In 1935, when musical films had become popular once again, thanks to Busby Berkeley,[76] Kern returned to Hollywood, where he composed the scores to a dozen more films, although he also continued working on Broadway productions. He settled permanently in Hollywood in 1937.[77] After suffering a heart attack in 1939, he was told by his doctors to concentrate on film scores, a less stressful task, as Hollywood songwriters were not as deeply involved with the production of their works as Broadway songwriters. This second phase of Kern's Hollywood career had considerably greater artistic and commercial success than the first. With Hammerstein, he wrote songs for the film versions of his recent Broadway shows _Music in the Air_ (1934), which starred Gloria Swanson in a rare singing role, and _Sweet Adeline_ (1935). With Dorothy Fields, he composed the new music for _I Dream Too Much_ (1935), a musical melodrama about the opera world, starring the Metropolitan Opera diva Lily Pons. Kern and Fields interspersed the opera numbers with their songs, including "the swinging 'I Got Love,' the lullaby 'The Jockey on the Carousel,' and the entrancing title song."[78] Also with Fields, he wrote two new songs, "I Won't Dance" and "Lovely to Look At", for the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film version of _Roberta_ (1935), which was a hit. The show also included the song "I'll Be Hard to Handle". This was given a 1952 remake called _Lovely to Look At_.[79]

Their next film, _Swing Time_ (1936) included the song "The Way You Look Tonight", which won the Academy Award in 1936 for the best song. Other songs in _Swing Time_ include "A Fine Romance", "Pick Yourself Up" and "Never Gonna Dance". _The Oxford Companion to the American Musical_ calls _Swing Time_ "a strong candidate for the best of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals" and says that, although the screenplay is contrived, it "left plenty of room for dance and all of it was superb. ... Although the movie is remembered as one of the great dance musicals, it also boasts one of the best film scores of the 1930s."[80] For the 1936 film version of _Show Boat_, Kern and Hammerstein wrote three new songs, including "I Have The Room Above Her" and "Ah Still Suits Me".[81] _High, Wide, and Handsome_ (1937) was intentionally similar in plot and style to _Show Boat_, but it was a box-office failure. Kern songs were also used in the Cary Grant film, _When You're in Love_ (1937), and the first Abbott and Costello feature, _One Night in the Tropics_ (1940). In 1940, Hammerstein wrote the lyric "The Last Time I Saw Paris", in homage to the French capital, recently occupied by the Germans. Kern set it, the only time he set a pre-written lyric, and his only hit song not written as part of a musical.[82] Originally a hit for Tony Martin and later for Noël Coward, the song was used in the film _Lady Be Good_ (1941) and won Kern another Oscar for best song. Kern's second and last symphonic work was his 'Mark Twain Suite'' (1942).[83]

In his last Hollywood musicals, Kern worked with several new and distinguished partners. With Johnny Mercer for _You Were Never Lovelier_ (1942), he contributed "a set of memorable songs to entertain audiences until the plot came to its inevitable conclusion".[84] The film starred Astaire and Rita Hayworth and included the song "I'm Old Fashioned". Kern's next collaboration was with Ira Gershwin on _Cover Girl_ starring Hayworth and Gene Kelly (1944) for which Kern composed "Sure Thing","Put Me to the Test," "Make Way for Tomorrow" (lyric by E. Y. Harburg), and the hit ballad "Long Ago (and Far Away)".[85] For the Deanna Durbin Western musical, _Can't Help Singing_ (1944), with lyrics by Harburg, Kern "provided the best original score of Durbin's career, mixing operetta and Broadway sounds in such songs as 'Any Moment Now,' 'Swing Your Partner,' 'More and More,' and the lilting title number." "More and More" was nominated for an Oscar.[86]

Kern composed his last film score, _Centennial Summer_ (1946) in which "the songs were as resplendent as the story and characters were mediocre. ... Oscar Hammerstein, Leo Robin, and E. Y. Harburg contributed lyrics for Kern's lovely music, resulting in the soulful ballad 'All Through the Day,' the rustic 'Cinderella Sue,' the cheerful 'Up With the Lark,' and the torchy 'In Love in Vain.'" "All Through the Day" was another Oscar nominee.[87] The music of Kern's last two films is notable in the way it developed from his earlier work. Some of it was too advanced for the film companies; Kern's biographer, Stephen Banfield, refers to "tonal experimentation ... outlandish enharmonics" that the studios insisted on cutting.[88] At the same time, in some ways his music came full circle: having in his youth helped to end the reigns of the waltz and operetta, he now composed three of his finest waltzes ("Can't Help Singing", "Californ-i-ay" and "Up With the Lark"), the last having a distinctly operetta-like character.[89]

Personal life and death

TillCloudsRollBy01.jpg sings "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" in _Till the Clouds Roll By_.]] Kern and his wife, Eva, often vacationed on their yacht _Show Boat_. He collected rare books and enjoyed betting on horses.[90] At the time of Kern's death, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was filming a fictionalized version of his life, _Till the Clouds Roll By_, which was released in 1946 starring Robert Walker as Kern.[91] In the film, Kern's songs are sung by Judy Garland, Kathryn Grayson, June Allyson, Lena Horne, Dinah Shore, Frank Sinatra and Angela Lansbury, among others, and Gower Champion and Cyd Charisse appear as dancers.[92] Many of the biographical facts are fictionalized.[93]

In the fall of 1945, Kern returned to New York City to oversee auditions for a new revival of _Show Boat_, and began to work on the score for what would become the musical _Annie Get Your Gun_, to be produced by Rodgers and Hammerstein. On November 5, 1945, at 60 years of age, he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while walking at the corner of Park Avenue and 57th Street.[94] Identifiable only by his ASCAP card, Kern was initially taken to the indigent ward at City Hospital, later being transferred to Doctors Hospital in Manhattan. Hammerstein was at his side when Kern's breathing stopped. Hammerstein hummed or sang the song "I've Told Ev'ry Little Star" from _Music in the Air_ (a personal favorite of the composer's) into Kern's ear. Receiving no response, Hammerstein realized Kern had died.[95] Rodgers and Hammerstein then assigned the task of writing the score for _Annie Get Your Gun_ to the veteran Broadway composer Irving Berlin.[96]

Kern is interred at Ferncliff Cemetery in Westchester County, New York.[97] He was survived by his wife and their daughter, Betty Jane (1913–1996; she married Artie Shaw in 1942 and later Jack Cummings).[98] Kern's wife eventually remarried, to a singer named George Byron.[99]


Awards

Jerome Kern was nominated eight times for an Academy Award, and won twice. Seven nominations were for Best Original Song; these included a posthumous nomination in each of 1945 and 1946. One nomination was in 1945 for Best Original Music Score. Kern was not eligible for any Tony Awards, which were not created until 1947. In 1976, _Very Good Eddie_ was nominated for a Drama Desk Award as Outstanding Revival, and the director and actors received various Tony, Drama Desk and other awards and nominations. Elisabeth Welsh was nominated for a Tony Award for her performance in _Jerome Kern Goes to Hollywood_ in 1986, and _Show Boat_ received Tony nominations in both 1983 and 1995, winning for best revival in 1995 (among numerous other awards and nominations), and won the Laurence Olivier Award for best revival in 2008. In 1986, _Big Deal_ was nominated for the Tony for best musical, among other awards, and Bob Fosse won as best choreographer. In 2000, _Swing!_, featuring Kern's "I Won't Dance" was nominated for the Tony for Best Musical, among others. In 2002, _Elaine Stritch at Liberty_, featuring Kern's "All in Fun", won the Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event. In 2004, _Never Gonna Dance_ received two Tony nominations.

Kern was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame posthumously, in 1970. In 1985, the U.S. Post Office issued a postage stamp (Scott #2110, 22¢), with an illustration of Kern holding sheet music.

Selected works

Note: All shows listed are musical comedies for which Kern was the sole composer unless otherwise specified.

During his first phase of work (1904–1911), Kern wrote songs for 22 Broadway productions, including songs interpolated into British musicals or featured in revues (sometimes writing lyrics as well as music), and he occasionally co-wrote musicals with one or two other composers. During visits to London beginning in 1905, he also composed songs that were first performed in several London shows. The following are some of the most notable such shows from this period:[100]

From 1912 to 1924, the more-experienced Kern began to work on dramatically concerned shows, including incidental music for plays, and, for the first time since his college show _Uncle Tom's Cabin_, he wrote musicals as the sole composer. His regular lyricist collaborators for his more than 30 shows during this period were Bolton, Wodehouse, Caldwell, Harry B. Smith and Howard Dietz. Some of his most notable shows during this very productive period were as follows:

-   _The "Mind-the-Paint" Girl_ (1912 play; starring Billie Burke) – incidental music
-   _The Red Petticoat_ (1912) – Kern's first complete score
-   _To-Night's the Night_ (1914) – contributor of two songs to this Rubens musical
-   _The Girl from Utah_ (1914) – added five songs to the American production of this Rubens musical
-   _Nobody Home_ (1915) – the first "Princess Theatre show"
-   _Very Good Eddie_ (1915; revived in 1975)
-   _Ziegfeld Follies of 1916_ (1916; a revue; the first of many) – contributed four songs
-   _Theodore & Co_ (1916) – contributed four songs to young Ivor Novello's London hit.
-   _Miss 1917_ - the musical comedy
-   _Miss Springtime_ (1917) – contributor of two songs to this Emmerich Kalman success
-   _Have a Heart_ (1917) – composer and contributor of some lyrics[101]
-   _Love O' Mike_ (1917)

-   _Oh, Boy!_ (1917) – the most successful Princess Theatre show
-   _Ziegfeld Follies of 1917_ (1917) – contributor of "Because You Are Just You (Just Because You're You)"
-   _Leave It to Jane_ (1917; revived in 1958 Off-Broadway)
-   _Oh, Lady! Lady!!_ (1918) – the last Princess Theatre hit
-   "Oh, My Dear" (1918) – contributed one song to this last "Princess Theatre show"
-   _The Night Boat_ (1920)
-   _Hitchy-Koo of 1920_ (1920) – revue
-   _Sally_ (1920; revived in 1923 and 1948) – one of Kern's biggest hits
-   _The Cabaret Girl_ (London 1922)
-   _The Bunch and Judy_ (1922) – Kern's first show with Fred Astaire
-   _Stepping Stones_ (1923)

During the last phase of his theatrical composing career, Kern continued to work with his previous collaborators but also met Oscar Hammerstein II and Otto Harbach, with whom Kern wrote his most lasting, memorable, and well-known works. The most successful of these are as follows:

-   _Sunny_ (1925) – a follow-up to _Sally_ and almost as big a hit; first collaboration with Hammerstein and Harbach
-   _Criss Cross_ (1926) – with Harbach
-   _Show Boat_ (1927; revived frequently) – with Hammerstein
-   _Blue Eyes_ (1928; London)
-   _Sweet Adeline_ (1929) – with Hammerstein
-   _The Cat and the Fiddle_ (1931) – Kern collaborated with Harbach the music, book and lyrics
-   _Music in the Air_ (1932; revived in 1951) – composer and co-director with Hammerstein
-   _Roberta_ (1933) – with Harbach (remade as _Lovely to Look At_ (1952))[102]
-   _Three Sisters_ (1934; London)
-   _Mamba's Daughters_ (1939; revived in 1940) – play – featured songwriter
-   _Very Warm for May_ (1939) – with Hammerstein; Kern's last stage musical, and a failure

In addition to revivals of his most popular shows, Kern's music has been posthumously featured in a variety of revues, musicals and concerts on and off Broadway.

-   _Jerome Kern Goes to Hollywood_ (1986) – Broadway revue consisting solely of Kern songs with lyrics by twelve different writers

-   _Something Wonderful_ (1995) – concert celebrating Oscar Hammerstein II's 100th birthday – featured composer
