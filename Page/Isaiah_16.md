    _Send the lamb to the ruler of the land_ [2]
    _Send lambs as tribute to the ruler of the land_ [3]
    _Send lambs to the king of the country_ [4]
    _I will send forth the son of the ruler of the land_
    _The people of Moab send a lamb as a present to the one who rules in Jerusalem_ [5]

states that:

    _Mesha king of Moab was a sheepbreeder, and he regularly paid the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams. But it happened, when Ahab died, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel._


Verse 14

    ''But now the Lord has spoken, saying,

        _‚ÄúWithin three years, as the years of a hired man, the glory of Moab will be despised with all that great multitude, and the remnant will be very small and feeble.‚Äù_[6]

"Within three years" may refer to the attack of Sargon II "in 715 BC" to put down a rebellion in Moab.[7]
