A _PRAKHOM_ BAND () is a type of traditional Thai music band employed to play ceremonial music–known as _prakhom_ music–during certain Thai rituals. Today, they report to the Bureau of the Royal Household's (BRH) Royal Ceremonial Division, and are responsible for the playing of traditional songs during royal events of the Royal Family of Thailand, in a custom known as _prakhom yam yam_ or royal ceremonial music performances.[1] The Prakhom Band plays the _prakhom_ part of state events involving the Thai Royal Family and are distinguished by their red dress uniforms and pith helmets.[2] As the term states they play ceremonial music every three hours during state funeral rites to signal officials and staff members of the Royal Family and the ensemble plays in other events like state coronations, royal anniversaries and the State Opening of the National Assembly.[3]

The ensemble is similar to the _daechwita_ ensembles of South Korea, but are of Chinese and Hindu origin.[4] Unlike other ensembles it reports as part of the Royal Ceremonial Division of the BRH, since the instruments are part of the Thai royal regalia. Of the 80 members, 38 work for the BRH, 42 are uniformed personnel of the Royal Thai Army 11th Military District (1st Division, King's Guard).[5]

In parades and ceremonies these are reinforced by cadets of the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School and traditional musicians from the Royal Thai Navy.
