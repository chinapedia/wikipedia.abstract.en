(_J_₃₇), a Johnson solid]] example is not a Johnson solid because it is not convex.]] s.)]]

In geometry, a JOHNSON SOLID is a strictly convex polyhedron, which is not uniform (i.e., not a Platonic solid, Archimedean solid, prism, or antiprism), and each face of which is a regular polygon. There is no requirement that each face must be the same polygon, or that the same polygons join around each vertex. An example of a Johnson solid is the square-based pyramid with equilateral sides (_J_₁); it has 1 square face and 4 triangular faces.

As in any strictly convex solid, at least three faces meet at every vertex, and the total of their angles is less than 360 degrees. Since a regular polygon has angles at least 60 degrees, it follows that at most five faces meet at any vertex. The pentagonal pyramid (_J_₂) is an example that actually has a degree-5 vertex.

Although there is no obvious restriction that any given regular polygon cannot be a face of a Johnson solid, it turns out that the faces of Johnson solids always have 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, or 10 sides.

In 1966, Norman Johnson published a list which included all 92 solids, and gave them their names and numbers. He did not prove that there were only 92, but he did conjecture that there were no others. Victor Zalgaller in 1969 proved that Johnson's list was complete.

Of the Johnson solids, the elongated square gyrobicupola (_J_₃₇), also called the pseudorhombicuboctahedron,[1] is unique in being locally vertex-uniform: there are 4 faces at each vertex, and their arrangement is always the same: 3 squares and 1 triangle. However, it is not vertex-transitive, as it has different isometry at different vertices, making it a Johnson solid rather than an Archimedean solid.


Names

The naming of Johnson solids follows a flexible and precise descriptive formula, such that many solids can be named in different ways without compromising their accuracy as a description. Most Johnson solids can be constructed from the first few (pyramids, cupolae, and rotunda), together with the Platonic and Archimedean solids, prisms, and antiprisms; the centre of a particular solid's name will reflect these ingredients. From there, a series of prefixes are attached to the word to indicate additions, rotations and transformations:

-   BI- indicates that two copies of the solid in question are joined base-to-base. For cupolae and rotundae, the solids can be joined so that either like faces (ORTHO-) or unlike faces (GYRO-) meet. Using this nomenclature, an octahedron can be described as a _square bipyramid_, a cuboctahedron as a _triangular gyrobicupola_, and an icosidodecahedron as a _pentagonal gyrobirotunda_.
-   ELONGATED indicates a prism is joined to the base of the solid in question, or between the bases in the case of Bi- solids. A rhombicuboctahedron can thus be described as an _elongated square orthobicupola_.
-   GYROELONGATED indicates an antiprism is joined to the base of the solid in question or between the bases in the case of Bi- solids. An icosahedron can thus be described as a _gyroelongated pentagonal bipyramid_.
-   AUGMENTED indicates another polyhedron, namely a pyramid or cupola, is joined to one or more faces of the solid in question.
-   DIMINISHED indicates a pyramid or cupola is removed from one or more faces of the solid in question.
-   GYRATE indicates a cupola mounted on or featured in the solid in question is rotated such that different edges match up, as in the difference between ortho- and gyrobicupolae.

The last three operations – _augmentation_, _diminution_, and _gyration_ – can be performed multiple times for certain large solids. _Bi-_ & _Tri-_ indicate a double and triple operation respectively. For example, a _bigyrate_ solid has two rotated cupolae, and a _tridiminished_ solid has three removed pyramids or cupolae.

In certain large solids, a distinction is made between solids where altered faces are parallel and solids where altered faces are oblique. _Para-_ indicates the former, that the solid in question has altered parallel faces, and _Meta-_ the latter, altered oblique faces. For example, a _parabiaugmented_ solid has had two parallel faces augmented, and a _metabigyrate_ solid has had 2 oblique faces gyrated.

The last few Johnson solids have names based on certain polygon complexes from which they are assembled. These names are defined by Johnson[2] with the following nomenclature:

-   A _lune_ is a complex of two triangles attached to opposite sides of a square.
-   _Spheno_- indicates a wedgelike complex formed by two adjacent lunes. _Dispheno-_ indicates two such complexes.
-   _Hebespheno_- indicates a blunt complex of two lunes separated by a third lune.
-   _Corona_ is a crownlike complex of eight triangles.
-   _Megacorona_ is a larger crownlike complex of 12 triangles.
-   The suffix -_cingulum_ indicates a belt of 12 triangles.


Enumeration

Pyramids, cupolae and rotundae

The first 6 Johnson solids are pyramids, cupolae, or rotundae with at most 5 sides. 6 sided pyramids and cupolae are coplanar and are hence not Johnson solids.

Pyramids

The first two Johnson solids, J1 and J2, are pyramids. The _triangular pyramid_ is the regular tetrahedron, so it is not a Johnson solid.

Cupolae and rotunda

The next four Johnson solids are three cupolae and one rotunda. They represent sections of uniform polyhedra.

Modified pyramids, cupolae and rotundae

Johnson solids 7 to 48 are derived from pyramids, cupolae and rotundae.

Elongated and gyroelongated pyramids

In the gyroelongated triangular pyramid, three pairs of adjacent triangles are coplanar and form non-square rhombi, so it is not a Johnson solid.

+------------------------------+--------------------------+

Bipyramids

The _square bipyramid_ is the regular octahedron, while the _gyroelongated pentagonal bipyramid_ is the regular icosahedron, so they are not Johnson solids. In the gyroelongated triangular bipyramid, six pairs of adjacent triangles are coplanar and form non-square rhombi, so it is also not a Johnson solid.

Snub antiprisms

The snub antiprisms can be constructed as an alternation of a truncated antiprism. The gyrobianticupolae are another construction for the snub antiprisms. Only snub antiprisms with at most 4 sides can be constructed from regular polygons. The snub triangular antiprism is the regular icosahedron, so it is not a Johnson solid.

Dual Polyhedrons

As of now, the website https://levskaya.github.io/polyhedronisme/ supports Conway operations applied to Johnson solids. For example, see https://levskaya.github.io/polyhedronisme/?recipe=C1000dJ73&palette=%2300ffff%20%23ff7f7f for the dual polyhedron of J73.
