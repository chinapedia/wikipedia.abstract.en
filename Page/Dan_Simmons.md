DAN SIMMONS (born April 4, 1948) is an American science fiction and horror writer. He is the author of the Hyperion Cantos and the Ilium/Olympos cycles, among other works which span the science fiction, horror, and fantasy genres, sometimes within a single novel. A typical example of Simmons' intermingling of genres is _Song of Kali_ (1985), winner of the World Fantasy Award.[1] He also writes mysteries and thrillers, some of which feature the continuing character Joe Kurtz.


Biography

Born in Peoria, Illinois, Simmons received a B.A. in English from Wabash College in 1970 and, in 1971, a Masters in Education from Washington University in St. Louis.[2]

He soon started writing short stories, although his career did not take off until 1982, when, through Harlan Ellison's help, his short story "The River Styx Runs Upstream" was published and awarded first prize in a _Twilight Zone Magazine_ story competition. Simmons' first novel, _Song of Kali_, was released in 1985.[3]

He worked in elementary education until 1989.[4]


Horror fiction

_Summer of Night_ (1991) recounts the childhood of a group of pre-teens who band together in the 1960s, to defeat a centuries-old evil that terrorizes their hometown of Elm Haven, Illinois. The novel, which was praised by Stephen King in a cover blurb, is similar to King's _It_ (1986) in its focus on small town life, the corruption of innocence, the return of an ancient evil, and the responsibility for others that emerges with the transition from youth to adulthood.

In the sequel to _Summer of Night_, _A Winter Haunting_ (2002), Dale Stewart (one of the first book's protagonists and now an adult), revisits his boyhood home to come to grips with mysteries that have disrupted his adult life.

Between the publication of _Summer of Night_ (1991) and _A Winter Haunting_ (2002), several additional characters from _Summer of Night_ appeared in: _Children of the Night_ (1992), a loose sequel to _Summer of Night_, which features Mike O'Rourke, now much older and a Roman Catholic priest, who is sent on a mission to investigate bizarre events in a European city; _Fires of Eden_ (1994), in which the adult Cordie Cooke appears; and _Darwin's Blade_ (2000), a thriller in which Dale's younger brother, Lawrence Stewart, appears as a minor character.[5][6]

Soon after _Summer of Night_ (1991), Simmons, who had written mostly horror fiction, began to focus on writing science fiction, although in 2007 he returned with a work of historical fiction and horror, _The Terror_. In 2009, he published another book, _Drood_, based on the last years of Charles Dickens' life leading up to the writing of _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_, which Dickens had partially completed at the time of his death.[7]


Historical fiction

_The Terror_ (2007) crosses the bridge between horror and historical fiction. It is a fictionalized account of Sir John Franklin and his expedition to find the Northwest Passage. The two ships, and , become icebound the first winter, and the captains and crew struggle to survive while being stalked across an Arctic landscape by a monster.

_The Abominable_ (2013) recounts a mid-1920s attempt on Mount Everest by five climbers—two English, one French, one Sherpa, and one American (the narrator)—to recover the body of one of the English characters' cousin.[8]


Literary references

Many of Simmons' works have strong ties with classic literature. For example:

-   His 1989 novel _Hyperion_, winner of Hugo and Locus Awards for the best science fiction novel,[9] deals with a space war and is inspired in its structure by Boccaccio's _Decameron_ and Chaucer's _Canterbury Tales_.
-   The last story in _Hyperion_, “The Consul’s Tale”, is a futuristic retelling of Shakespeare's _Romeo & Juliet_.
-   The _Hyperion Cantos_ take their titles from poems by the English Romantic John Keats.[10]
-   The title of _Carrion Comfort_, as well as many of its themes, derives from the poem "Carrion Comfort" by Gerard Manley Hopkins.
-   In _The Fall of Hyperion_, John Keats himself appears as one of the main characters, with references to characters in _Forbidden Planet_ and _The Time Machine_.
-   "Vanni Fucci Is Alive and Well and Living In Hell" (1988), a short story lampooning televangelists and included in _Prayers to Broken Stones_, is about a brief return to earth by the title character, an inhabitant of Dante's _Inferno_
-   _The Hollow Man_ (1992) is a novel influenced by Dante's _Inferno_ and T. S. Eliot[11]
-   "The Great Lover" (1993) is a short story inspired by the World War I War Poets[12]
-   The _Ilium/Olympos_ cycle is inspired by Homer's works, as well as Shakespeare and Marcel Proust, and the character Ada and her home Ardis Hall are inspired by Vladimir Nabokov's novel _Ada or Ardor_, which was one of Nabokov's forays into the science fiction genre and alternate history
-   Simmons' collection of short stories, _Worlds Enough & Time_, takes its name from the first line of the poem _To His Coy Mistress_ by British poet Andrew Marvell: "Had we but world enough, and time"[13]
-   The detective in _Flashback_ is named Nick Bottom after a character in Shakespeare's _A Midsummer Night's Dream_[14]


Screen adaptations

In January 2004, it was announced that the screenplay he wrote for his novels _Ilium_ and _Olympos_ would be made into a film by Digital Domain and Barnet Bain Films, with Simmons acting as executive producer. _Ilium_ is described as an "epic tale that spans 5,000 years and sweeps across the entire solar system, including themes and characters from Homer's _The Iliad_ and Shakespeare's _The Tempest_."[15]

In 2008, Guillermo del Toro is scheduled to direct a film adaptation of _Drood_ for Universal Pictures.[16] As of December 2017, the project is still listed as "in development."[17]

In 2009, Scott Derrickson was set to direct _"Hyperion Cantos"_ for Warner Bros. and Graham King, with Trevor Sands penning the script to blend the first two cantos "Hyperion" and "The Fall of Hyperion" into one film.[18] In 2011, actor Bradley Cooper expressed interest in taking over the adaptation.[19] In 2015, it was announced that TV channel Syfy will produce a mini-series based on the Hyperion Cantos with the involvement of Cooper and King.[20] As of May 2017, the project was still "in development" at Syfy.[21]

_The Terror_ (2007) has been adapted as an AMC TV 10 episode-mini-series in 2018 and received generally positive reviews upon release.[22][23]
