History

Austin International School, originally called the "Lycée Français d'Austin" (French School of Austin), was founded in April 2001 by the Consul General of France to Houston, the Honorary Consul of France in Austin, some Austin‐based business leaders, and a group of French, American, and Francophone parents to meet the demands of a growing international and globally‐minded population in Austin.

AIS became the third French‐American school established in Texas and the 43rd in the United States. In its first year, AIS enrolled 65 pre-kindergarten, kindergarten and elementary students, with a student body that included French, American, and other nationalities. In 2006, it received its first American accreditation and in 2007, it became the first and only school in central Texas to be accredited by the French Ministry of Education. In 2019, received additional regional accreditation, becoming one of three schools in the State of Texas to hold full accreditation from both a regional accrediting body and the French Ministry of Education.[4]

In 2019, AIS was awarded a Platinum Seal of Transparency by GuideStar.[5]
