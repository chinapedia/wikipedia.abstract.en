Bevan_punkt.svg Bevan2_punkt.svg The BEVAN POINT, named after Benjamin Bevan, is a triangle center. It is defined as center of the BEVAN CIRCLE, that is the circle through the centers of the three excircles of a triangle.

The Bevan point M of triangle _ABC_ has the same distance from its Euler line _e_ as its incenter _I_ and the circumcenter _O_ is the midpoint of the line segment _MI_. The length of _MI_ is given by

$$|MI|=2\sqrt{R^2-\frac{abc}{a+b+c}}$$
where _R_ denotes the radius of the circumcircle and _a_, _b_ and _c_ the sides of the triangle _ABC_. The Bevan is point is also the midpoint of the line segment _NL_ connecting the Nagel point _N_ and the Longchamps point _L_. The radius of the Bevan circle is 2_R_, that is twice the radius of the circumcircle.
