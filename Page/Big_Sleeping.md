BIG SLEEPING is an Italian noir-humorous comic series created by Daniele Panebarco.


History and profile

Inspired by Raymond Chandler's novels, the main character of the series is a private detective loosely based on Philip Marlowe. The series featured typical noir and hard-boiled elements mixed with surreal and humorous plots, such as the research of Godot, or the thief of the Christmas Star.[1][2]

The series debuted in the magazine _Il Mago_, and was later published in a large number of other publications including _linus_, _Orient Express_, _Comic Art_ and _L'espresso_. Big Sleeping was also featured in several graphic novels, the first of them being _Il Falcone Sardese_ (Longanesi, 1977), which featured the killing of Italian Communist Party secretary Enrico Berlinguer and his replacement with a double appointed to kill the American president Jimmy Carter during a public event.[3][4]

The appearance of the main character and the graphic rendering of the comics significantly evolved over the course of publications, from an early roundish and "boterian" style to a more stretched and realistic drawing.[5][6]
