WATAGA is an unincorporated community in Mercer County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]


History

A post office called Wataga was established in 1886, and remained in operation until 1907.[2] While at least one source states the name is derived from an unidentified Native American language with an obscure meaning,[3] the name may be the Lakota language word signifying "foam" or "froth".[4]
