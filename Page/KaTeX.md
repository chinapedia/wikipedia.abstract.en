KATEX is a cross-browser JavaScript library that displays mathematical notation in web browsers. It puts special emphasis on being fast and easy to use.[1]

It was initially developed by Khan Academy,[2] and became one of the top five trending projects on GitHub in September 2014.[3]


Features

KaTeX rendering of math claims to be:

-   Fast: It renders its math synchronously and doesnâ€™t need to reflow the page.
-   Print quality: Its layout is based on TeX.
-   Self contained: It has no dependencies, so it can be easily bundled.
-   Capable of server-side rendering: it has an option to generate HTML on the server (so, for example, one can pre-render expressions using Node.js and send them as plain HTML).

However, compared to MathJax, it handles only a more limited subset of LaTeX's mathematics notation.[4]
