NordnorskKunstmuseum-Tromsø.jpg, Norway]] NORDNORSK KUNSTMUSEUM is a Norwegian visual arts museum in Northern Norway. It claims to be the country's youngest and geographically northernmost art museum.[1]


History

Established in 1985, and opened its doors in March 1988. Moved to its current location in Tromsø in 2001.[2]


Collections

The museum presents different temporary exhibitions of both contemporary and historical art during the year, in addition to the permanent collection. The permanent collection contains approximately 2,200 works, of which only a small, representative amount is on display. The collection includes artworks from the late 18th century to the present day.[3]

The museum also deposits art from the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, SpareBank 1 Northern Norway Art Foundation, Sparebankstiftelsen DNB NOR, Tromsø Kunstforening and private collections. Key artists include Peder Balke, Adelsteen Normann, Harriet Backer, Anna-Eva Bergman and Olav Christopher Jenssen.[4]

Nordnorsk Kunstmuseum was named Norway's «Museum of the Year 2017» by Norges Museumsforbund, the Norwegian museum association.[5]


Other locations

The museum has a special responsibility for the northern parts of Norway, and tours 2-3 smaller exhibitions in Nordland, Troms, Finnmark and Svalbard. In 2015 the satellite Kunsthall Svalbard opened in Longyearbyen, Svalbard as a dedicated arena for contemporary art.[6] Queen Sonja of Norway did the official opening,[7] and the first exhibition was _Glacier_ by Joan Jonas.[8]
