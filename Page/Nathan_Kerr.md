NATHAN KERR (born 20 January 1998) is a professional footballer who plays as a full-back for NIFL Premiership side Glentoran. He has been capped by Northern Ireland up to under-19 level.


Playing career

Kerr came through the youth team at Stevenage to sign his first professional contract in May 2016.[1] Manager Darren Sarll had originally taken Kerr to the club's academy after seeing him captain Northern Ireland schoolboys to victory over England in the Victory Shield.[2] He made his first team debut as a 77th-minute substitute for Ronnie Henry in a 3–1 defeat to Leyton Orient in an EFL Trophy group stage game at Brisbane Road on 30 August 2016.[3] He made his League Two debut four days later, again replacing Henry, as Stevenage beat Hartlepool United 6–1 at Broadhall Way.[4]
