BANGANGA RIVER originates from the Bairath hills in Jaipur. It passes through Modhapur, Bharatpur and Fatehabad and drains into Yamuna. Jamwa Ramgarh dam has been constructed across the river in Jaipur. The river Banganga has its multiple tributary rivers like Gumti Nala, and Suri rivers on the right side banks and Palasan and Sanwan rivers are on the left bank. Water levels have now dropped to a very low level with nearby areas suffering from water shortages. Fairly recently, within 30 years, these areas were vibrant and arable with different types of agriculture . There were significant areas of forest along the Banganga's route and it was known for its special tree date khajoor in Maid (a town based on the river bank) but with the dropping water levels farming has suffered.
