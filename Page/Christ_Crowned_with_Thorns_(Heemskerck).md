_CHRIST CROWNED WITH THORNS_ is a c.1550 painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Maarten van Heemskerck in the collection of the Frans Hals Museum.[1]

The subject depicts Christ before the crucifixion being mocked by soldiers, who are fixing the crown of thorns to his head. It was commissioned by the Church of Delft where it hung until 1625 when it was removed and placed in the town hall for being "too Catholic". It was sold 24 April 1860, when it was purchased by the noble Jhr. Jan Six of Hillegom. He in turn gave it to the museum in 1871.[2]
