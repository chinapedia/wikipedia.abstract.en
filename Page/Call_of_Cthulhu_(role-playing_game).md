_CALL OF CTHULHU_ is a horror fiction role-playing game based on H. P. Lovecraft's story of the same name and the associated Cthulhu Mythos.[1] The game, often abbreviated as _CoC_, is published by Chaosium; it was first released in 1981 and is currently in its seventh edition, with many different versions released. It makes use of Chaosium's Basic Role-Playing (BRP) system, with special rules for Sanity.[2]


Gameplay

The setting of _Call of Cthulhu_ is a darker version of our world, based on H. P. Lovecraft's observation (from his essay, "Supernatural Horror in Literature") that "The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown." The original game, first published in 1981, uses mechanics from Basic Role-Playing, and is set in the 1920s, the setting of many of Lovecraft's stories. Additional settings were developed in the _Cthulhu by Gaslight_ supplement, a blend of occult and Holmesian mystery and mostly set in England during the 1890s, and modern/1980s conspiracy with _Cthulhu Now_ and _Delta Green_. More recent additions include 1000 AD (_Cthulhu: Dark Ages_), 23rd century (_Cthulhu Rising_) and Ancient Roman times (_Cthulhu Invictus_). The protagonists may also travel to places that are not of this earth, represented in the Dreamlands (which can be accessed through dreams as well as being physically connected to the earth), to other planets, or into the voids of space. In keeping with the Lovecraftian theme, the gamemaster is called the Keeper of Arcane Lore, or simply the keeper, while player characters are called "investigators".

_CoC_ uses the Basic Role-Playing system first developed for _RuneQuest_ and used in other Chaosium games. It is skill-based, with player characters getting better with their skills by succeeding at using them for as long as they stay functionally healthy and sane. They do not, however, gain hit points and do not become significantly harder to kill. The game does not use levels.

_CoC_ uses percentile dice (with a results ranging from 1 to 100) to determine success or failure. Every player statistic is intended to be compatible with the notion that there is a probability of success for a particular action given what the player is capable of doing. For example, an artist may have a 75% chance of being able to draw something (represented by having 75 in Art skill), and thus rolling a number under 75 would yield a success. Rolling or less of the skill level (1-15 in the example) would be a "special success" (or an "impale" for combat skills) and would yield some extra bonus to be determined by the keeper. For example, the artist character might draw especially well or especially fast, or catch some unapparent detail in the drawing.

The players take the roles of ordinary people drawn into the realm of the mysterious: detectives, criminals, scholars, artists, war veterans, etc. Often, happenings begin innocently enough, until more and more of the workings behind the scenes are revealed. As the characters learn more of the true horrors of the world and the irrelevance of humanity, their sanity (represented by "Sanity Points", abbreviated SAN) inevitably withers away. The game includes a mechanism for determining how damaged a character's sanity is at any given point; encountering the horrific beings usually triggers a loss of SAN points. To gain the tools they need to defeat the horrors – mystic knowledge and magic – the characters may end up losing some of their sanity, though other means such as pure firepower or simply outsmarting one's opponents also exist. _CoC_ has a reputation as a game in which it is quite common for a player character to die in gruesome circumstances or end up in a mental institution. Eventual triumph of the players is not assumed.


History

The original conception of _Call of Cthulhu_ was _Dark Worlds_, a game commissioned by the publisher Chaosium but never published. Sandy Petersen contacted them regarding writing a supplement for their popular fantasy game _RuneQuest_ set in Lovecraft's Dreamlands. He took over the writing of _Call of Cthulhu_, and the game was released in 1981.[3]

Editions

Since Petersen's departure from Chaosium, continuing development of _Call of Cthulhu_ passed to Lynn Willis, credited as co-author in the fifth and sixth editions, and more recently to Paul Fricker and Mike Mason. The game system underwent only minor rules changes in its first six editions (between 1981 and 2011); the current seventh edition, released 2014, includes more significant rules alterations than in any previous release.[4]

Early releases

For those grounded in the RPG tradition, the very first release of _Call of Cthulhu_ created a brand new framework for table-top gaming. Rather than the traditional format established by _Dungeons & Dragons_, which often involved the characters wandering through caves or tunnels and fighting different types of monsters, Sandy Petersen introduced the concept of the _Onion Skin_: Interlocking layers of information and nested clues that lead the player characters from seemingly minor investigations into a missing person to discovering mind-numbingly awful, global conspiracies to destroy the world. Unlike its predecessor games, _CoC_ assumed that most investigators would not survive, alive or sane, and that the only safe way to deal with the vast majority of nasty things described in the rule books was to run away. A well-run _CoC_ campaign should engender a sense of foreboding and inevitable doom in its players. The style and setting of the game, in a relatively modern time period, created an emphasis on real-life settings, character research, and thinking one's way around trouble.

The first book of _Call of Cthulhu_ adventures was _Shadows of Yog-Sothoth_. In this work, the characters come upon a secret society's foul plot to destroy mankind, and pursue it first near to home and then in a series of exotic locations. This template was to be followed in many subsequent campaigns, including _Fungi from Yuggoth_ (later known as _Curse of Cthulhu_ and _Day of the Beast_), _Spawn of Azathoth_, and possibly the most highly acclaimed, _Masks of Nyarlathotep_.[16]

_Shadows of Yog-Sothoth_ is important not only because it represents the first published addition to the boxed first edition of _Call of Cthulhu_, but because its format defined a new way of approaching a campaign of linked RPG scenarios involving actual clues for the would-be detectives amongst the players to follow and link in order to uncover the dastardly plots afoot. Its format has been used by every other campaign-length _Call of Cthulhu_ publication. The standard of _CoC_ scenarios was well received by independent reviewers. _The Asylum and Other Tales_, a series of stand alone articles released in 1983, rated an overall 9/10 in Issue 47 of _White Dwarf_ magazine.[17]

The standard of the included 'clue' material varies from scenario to scenario, but reached its zenith in the original boxed versions of the _Masks of Nyarlathotep_ and _Horror on the Orient Express_ campaigns. Inside these one could find matchbooks and business cards apparently defaced by non-player characters, newspaper cuttings and (in the case of _Orient Express_) period passports to which players could attach their photographs, increasing the sense of immersion. Indeed, during the period that these supplements were produced, third party campaign publishers strove to emulate the quality of the additional materials, often offering separately-priced 'deluxe' clue packages for their campaigns.

Additional milieux were provided by Chaosium with the release of _Dreamlands_, a boxed supplement containing additional rules needed for playing within the Lovecraft Dreamlands, a large map and a scenario booklet, and _Cthulhu By Gaslight_, another boxed set which moved the action from the 1920s to the 1890s.

Supplement campaigns

-   _Shadows of Yog-Sothoth_, 1982
-   _Fungi from Yuggoth_, 1984
-   _Masks of Nyarlathotep_, 1984
-   _Spawn of Azathoth_, 1986
-   _Horror on the Orient Express_, 1991
-   _Beyond the Mountains of Madness_, 1999

_Cthulhu Now_

In 1987, Chaosium issued the supplement titled _Cthulhu Now_, a collection of rules, supplemental source materials and scenarios for playing _Call of Cthulhu_ in the present day. This proved to be a very popular alternative milieu, so much so that much of the supplemental material is now included in the core rule book.

_Delta Green_

Pagan Publishing released _Delta Green_, a series of supplements originally set in the 1990s, although later supplements add support for playing closer to the present day. In these, player characters are agents of a secret agency known as Delta Green, which fights against creatures from the Mythos and conspiracies related to them. Arc Dream Publishing released a new version of _Delta Green_ in 2016 as a standalone game, partially using the mechanics from _Call of Cthulhu_.

_Lovecraft Country_

_Lovecraft Country_ was a line of supplements for _Call of Cthulhu_ released in 1990. These supplements were overseen by Keith Herber and provided backgrounds and adventures set in Lovecraft's fictional towns of Arkham, Kingsport, Innsmouth, Dunwich, and their environs. The intent was to give investigators a common base, as well as to center the action on well-drawn characters with clear motivations.

Recent history

In the years since the collapse of the _Mythos_ collectible card game (production ceased in 1997), the release of _CoC_ books has been very sporadic with up to a year between releases. Chaosium struggled with near bankruptcy for many years before finally starting their upward climb again.

2005 was Chaosium's busiest year for many years with ten releases for the game. Chaosium took to marketing "monographs"—short books by individual writers with editing and layout provided out-of-house—directly to the consumer, allowing the company to gauge market response to possible new works. The range of times and places in which the horrors of the Mythos can be encountered was also expanded in late 2005 onwards with the addition of _Cthulhu Dark Ages_ by Stéphane Gesbert, which gives a framework for playing games set in 11th century Europe, _Secrets of Japan_ by Michael Dziesinski for gaming in modern-day Japan, and _Secrets of Kenya_ by David Conyers for gaming in interwar period Africa.

In July 2011, Chaosium announced it would re-release a 30th anniversary edition of the _CoC_ 6th edition role-playing game.[18] This 320-page book features thick (3 mm) leatherette hardcovers with the front cover and spine stamped with gold foil. The interior pages are printed in black ink, on 90 gsm matte art paper. The binding is thread sewn, square backed. Chaosium offered a one-time printing of this Collector's Edition.

On May 28, 2013, a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter for the 7th Edition of _Call of Cthulhu_ was launched with a goal of $40,000; it ended on June 29 of the same year having collected $561,836.[19] It included many more major revisions than any previous edition, and also split the core rules into two books, a Player's Guide and Keeper's Guide.[20][21] Problems and delays fulfilling the Kickstarters for the 7th edition of _Call of Cthulhu_ led Greg Stafford and Sandy Petersen (who had both left in 1998) to return to an active role at Chaosium in June 2015.[22]


Licenses

Chaosium has licensed other publishers to create supplements using their rule system, notably including _Delta Green_ by Pagan Publishing. Other licensees have included Infogrames, Miskatonic River Press, Theater of the Mind Enterprises, Triad Entertainment, Games Workshop,[23] Fantasy Flight Games, RAFM, Goodman Games, Grenadier Models Inc. and Yog-Sothoth.com. These supplements may be set in different time frames or even different game universes from the original game.

_Shadow of the Comet_

_Shadow of the Comet_ (later repackaged as _Call of Cthulhu: Shadow of the Comet_) is an adventure game developed and released by Infogrames in 1993. The game is based on H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos and uses many elements from Lovecraft's _The Dunwich Horror_ and _The Shadow Over Innsmouth_. A follow-up game, _Prisoner of Ice_, is not a direct sequel.

_Prisoner of Ice_

_Prisoner of Ice_ (also _Call of Cthulhu: Prisoner of Ice_) is an adventure game developed and released by Infogrames for the PC and Macintosh computers in 1995 in America and Europe. It is based on H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, particularly _At the Mountains of Madness_, and is a follow-up to Infogrames' earlier _Shadow of the Comet_. In 1997, the game was ported to the Sega Saturn and PlayStation exclusively in Japan.

_d20 Call of Cthulhu_

In 2001, a stand-alone version of _Call of Cthulhu_ was released by Wizards of the Coast, for the d20 system. Intended to preserve the feeling of the original game, the d20 conversion of the game rules were supposed to make the game more accessible to the large _D&D_ player base. The d20 system also made it possible to use _Dungeons & Dragons_ characters in _Call of Cthulhu_, as well as to introduce the Cthulhu Mythos into _Dungeons & Dragons_ games. The d20 version of the game is no longer supported by Wizards as per their contract with Chaosium.[24] Chaosium included d20 stats as an appendix in three releases (see Lovecraft Country), but have since dropped the "dual stat" idea.

_Dark Corners of the Earth_

A licensed[25] first-person shooter adventure game by Headfirst Productions, based on _Call of Cthulhu_ campaign _Escape from Innsmouth_ and released by Bethesda Softworks in 2005/2006 for the PC and Xbox.

_Trail of Cthulhu_

In February 2008, Pelgrane Press published _Trail of Cthulhu_, a stand-alone game created by Kenneth Hite using the GUMSHOE System developed by Robin Laws.[26] _Trail of Cthulhu_{{'}}s system is more mystery oriented and focuses mostly on interpreting clues.

_Shadows of Cthulhu_

In September 2008, Reality Deviant Publications published _Shadows of Cthulhu_, a supplement that brings Lovecraftian gaming to Green Ronin's True20 system.[27]

_Realms of Cthulhu_

In October 2009, Reality Blurs published _Realms of Cthulhu_, a supplement for Pinnacle Entertainment's Savage Worlds system.[28]

_The Laundry_

In 2010, Cubicle 7 published an official role-playing game, _The Laundry_[29][30][31] and a number of supplements, all based on Charles Stross's "Laundry Files" series.[32]

_The Wasted Land_

In April 2011, Chaosium and new developer Red Wasp Design announced a joint project to produce a mobile video game based on the _Call of Cthulhu_ RPG, entitled _Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land_.[33][34] The game was released on January 30, 2012.[35]

_Cthulhu Chronicles_

In 2018, Metarcade produced _Cthulhu Chronicles_, a game for iOS with a campaign of nine mobile interactive fiction stories set in 1920s England based on _Call of Cthulhu_.[36][37] The first five stories were released on July 10, 2018.[38]

Card games

_Mythos_ was a collectible card game (CCG) based on the Cthulhu Mythos that Chaosium produced and marketed during the mid-1990s. While generally praised for its fast gameplay and unique mechanics, it ultimately failed to gain a very large market presence. It bears mention because its eventual failure brought the company to hard times that affected its ability to produce material for _Call of Cthulhu_. _Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game_ is a second collectible card game, produced by Fantasy Flight Games.

Miniatures

The first licensed _Call of Cthulhu_ gaming miniatures were sculpted by Andrew Chernack and released by Grenadier Models in boxed sets and blister packs in 1983. The license was later transferred to RAFM. As of 2011, RAFM still produce licensed C_all of Cthulhu_ models sculpted by Bob Murch. Both lines include investigator player character models and the iconic monsters of the Cthulhu mythos. As of July 2015, Reaper Miniatures started its third "Bones Kickstarter", a Kickstarter intended to help the company migrate some miniatures from metal to plastic, and introducing some new ones. Among the stretch goals was the second $50 expansion, devoted to the Mythos, with miniatures such as Cultists, Deep Ones, Mi'Go, and an extra $15 Shub-Niggurath "miniature" (it is, at least, 6x4 squares). It is expected for those miniatures to remain in the Reaper Miniatures catalogue after the Kickstarter project finishes.

_The Official Video Game_

_CALL OF CTHULHU: THE OFFICIAL VIDEO GAME_ is a survival horror role-playing video game developed by Cyanide and published by Focus Home Interactive for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows. The game features a semi-open world environment and incorporates themes of Lovecraftian and psychological horror into a story which includes elements of investigation and stealth. It is inspired by H. P. Lovecraft's short story "The Call of Cthulhu".


Reception

William A. Barton reviewed _Call of Cthulhu_ in _The Space Gamer_ No. 49.[39] Barton calls the game "an excellent piece of work." He noted that there were some shortcomings resulting from assumption of rules details from _RuneQuest_ that are not in _CoC_ itself, but praised it overall, saying "the worlds of H. P. Lovecraft are truly open for the fantasy gamer., and calling the game a satisfactory experience.[40]

David Cook reviewed _Call of Cthulhu_ for _Dragon_ magazine #61 (May 1982).[41] He commented: "It is a good game for experienced role-playing gamers and ambitious judges, especially if they like Lovecraft’s type of story."[42]

Lisa Cohen reviewed the 1986 edition of _Call of Cthulhu_ in _Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer_ No. 80.[43] Cohen commented that "This book can be for collectors of art, players, or anyone interested in knowledge about old time occult. It is the one reprint that is worth the money."[44]

_Call of Cthulhu_ was ranked 1st in the 1996 reader poll of _Arcane_ magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time. The UK magazine's editor Paul Pettengale commented: "_Call of Cthulhu_ is fully deserved of the title as the most popular roleplaying system ever - it's a game that doesn't age, is eminently playable, and which hangs together perfectly. The system, even though it's over ten years old, it still one of the very best you'll find in any roleplaying game. Also, there's not a referee in the land who could say they've read every Lovecraft inspired book or story going, so there's a pretty-well endless supply of scenario ideas. It's simply marvellous."[45]

The game won several major awards in the following years:[46]

-   1982, Origins Awards, _Best Role Playing Game_
-   1981, Game Designer's Guild, _Select Award_
-   1985, Games Day Award, _Best Role Playing Game_
-   1986, Games Day Award, _Best Contemporary Role Playing Game_
-   1987, Games Day Award, _Best Other Role Playing Game_
-   1993, Leeds Wargame Club, _Best Role Playing Game_
-   1994, Gamer's Choice Award, _Hall of Fame_
-   1995, Origins Award, _Hall of Fame_[47]
-   2001, Origins Award, _Best Graphic Presentation of a Book Product_ (for _Call of Cthulhu_ 20th anniversary edition)
-   2003, GamingReport.com readers voted it as the number-one Gothic/Horror RPG
