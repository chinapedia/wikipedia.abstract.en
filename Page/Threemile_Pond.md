THREEMILE POND is a lake located in China and Windsor, Maine. The lake is known for being infested with algae blooms often.[1] Despite the name, the pond is in fact 2.71 miles long.[2] The lake has a boat ramp for aquatic actives.[3] The lake has one large island that causes a major boating hazard.[4] The lake's water quality has somewhat improved recently.[5] South Vassalboro is located less than half a mile away from the lake. The lake contains two small islands, which one contains a small house and dock, while the other is undeveloped marsh.
