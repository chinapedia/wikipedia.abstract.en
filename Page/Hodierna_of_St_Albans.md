HODIERNA OF ST ALBANS (fl. 1150â€“1210) was the mother of Alexander Neckam and wet nurse of Richard I of England. Hodierna is also known as Audierne.[1]

According to legend, Richard I and Alexander Neckam were born on the same day.[2] The astrological significance of these two births may be the reason Hodierna was chosen as wet nurse.[3] The boys were breastfed together, although as heir to the throne Richard was given the right breast which was believed to produce richer milk.[4]

Wet nurse to the young princes was an honoured position and Hodierna was given a home in the King's Houses.[5] However, if Richard became ill or died, Hodierna could be blamed.[6] Transitioning into a nanny role as Richard got older, Hodierna was Richard's main source of maternal affection in his early years as his mother was often away.[7]

Richard did not forget Hodierna as he got older. Records show that when he was King, Richard gave Hodierna a generous pension.[8][9]

The village of West Knoyle in Wiltshire was formerly known as Knoyle Hodierne after her.[10]
