He is a leading authority in near-death research with over twenty years in the field. In this book, Sabom describes the Pam Reynolds case.[4] This work has been criticized that "experimenter bias, witness tampering (however unconscious), and false memories intruded into this best of all recorded cases (as)...painfully obvious."[5] In 1994, he founded the Atlanta Study which is the first comprehensive investigation of its kind into NDEs. Sabom's latest book, _Light and Death_, shares his findings from the Atlanta Study.[6][7][8]
