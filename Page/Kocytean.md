The release consists of a collection of six B-side songs from their prior three albums at the time - _The Great Cold Distance_ (2006), _Night is the New Day_ (2009), and _Dead End Kings_ (2012). While given a limited release, it was still generally praised by critics.


Background and release

The _Kocytean_ EP was compiled and released for the 2014 iteration of Record Store Day, a yearly event where band create a limited edition release strictly a small businesses dedicated to releasing music.[1] The releases consists of six tracks, featuring two B-side songs each from each of their last three studio albums at the time. The tracks "Unfurl" and "Code Against the Code" originate from _The Great Cold Distance_ sessions, "Sold Heart" and "Ashen" originate from the _Night is the New Day_ sessions," and "Second" and "The Act of Blackening" originate from the _Dead End Kings_ sessions.[2] The release features album artwork from Travis Smith, who had previously created cover art for the band.[3] The EP was released just before the band embarked on the "Unplugged & Reworked Tour", which was in support of the just prior released _Dethroned & Uncrowned_ - an acoustic re-recording of their ninth album _Dead End Kings_ - something journalists felt _Kocytean_ was an extension considering the more mellow nature of several of the EP's tracks.[4][5][6][7]


Critical reception

The album was generally well-received by critics. _Dead Press UK_ praised the album's similar sound to _Dethroned & Uncrowned_, concluding that "Despite these tracks being taken from a whole host of Katatonia‘s previous albums, each one maintains the same spark of brilliance....it’s evident that a great deal of consideration goes into producing these highly intelligent and stirring songs. Whether you’re doing some soul searching or need a thought-provoking soundtrack to a gloomy winter day, _Kocytean_ is a good place to start."[8] The _Ultimate Guitar_ staff review praised the lyrics and elaborate sound, concluding that "As the tracks are rare and B-sides you may already own several of them if you are a big fan of the band, and that may be discouraging, but I honestly feel like this is a worthwhile release."[9]
