GONZALO CASTELLOT MADRAZO (February 20, 1922 – August 6, 2011) was a Mexican broadcaster, station owner and politician. He served three times in the Chamber of Deputies and was particularly involved in the development of broadcasting in the state of Colima.


Life

Castellot Madrazo was born to José Castellot Paullada and Ernestina Madrazo Torres on February 20, 1922, either in Campeche, Campeche or in Mexico City.[1][2] He went to elementary and secondary school in Mexico City and then attended the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where he earned his legal degree. In 1944, Castellot obtained his announcer's license; he then worked briefly at Cadena Radio Continental and at XEKJ in Acapulco.[3]

In 1947, Castellot and Alonso Sordo Noriega unionized the workers at XEX, a then-new radio station in the nation's capital.[4] Three years later, on July 26, 1950, he would hold the distinction of being the first announcer to be seen on Mexican television, on the first day of operations of XHTV, the country's first TV station.[5] He read news headlines as part of XHTV's first day of programming.[6]

Castellot also was involved in the creation of new representative organizations for announcers and employees in broadcasting. In 1951, he founded the National Announcers' Association (_Asociación Nacional de Locutores_), as well as _TV Servicio Modelos_, the first modeling agency of its kind in the country.[7] Eight years later, he became the secretary general of SITAT, the Industrial Union of Television Artists and Workers, now known as SITATYR.[8] He remained the head of the union for 37 years.[9]

In politics

Castellot Madrazo represented the Federal District three times in the Chamber of Deputies: from 1961 to 1964, from 1979 to 1982 and again from 1985 to 1988.[10] His involvement with the Institutional Revolutionary Party extended beyond serving in the legislature, as he headed the radio, television and film office of the presidential press office during the term of Gustavo Díaz Ordaz and worked on the campaigns of Díaz Órdaz and his predecessor, Adolfo López Mateos.[11]

Colima

In the 1980s, Castellot moved to the state of Colima, where he contributed to the development of media in the state. In January 1980, Castellot and José de Jesús Partida Villanueva launched a new Televisa station, XHCC-TV channel 5.[12][13] In November 1984, XHCC began offering regular local programs.

In 1993, Castellot brought the first FM station to Colima City when XHCC-FM "Volcán FM" was launched;[14][15] the station was sold to Grupo Imagen in 2008. Also in the 1990s, he began serving on various organizations relating to broadcasting, including as president of Promosat de México, from 1997 until his death.[16] He also was the president of the state chapter of the National Radio and Television Chamber (CIRT) in 2004.[17]

Castellot was recognized by major broadcasting organizations for his lengthy career. In 2000, he was presented with the Golden Microphone Award by the National Announcers' Association and with the Premio Antena, awarded by the national CIRT.[18] In 2010, the Mayor of Colima City, José Ignacio Peralta Sánchez, honored him for his 60 years of service to the industry.[19]

Toward the end of his life, Castellot continued to host the radio programs "Colima Hoy" (Colima Today) and "El Compositor y Su Música" (The Composer and Their Music); he also wrote a book, _Mis memorias a casi un siglo de la radio en México_ ("My Memories of Almost a Century of Radio in Mexico").[20]

Castellot died in Colima on August 6, 2011, of cardiorespiratory failure after a long illness.[21] He was survived by his wife Laura and children and grandchildren.[22]
