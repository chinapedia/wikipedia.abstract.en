Life and work

Qin Wenjun was born in Shanghai in 1954. In 1971, as one of the educated youth sent to work in the rural China, Qin was sent to a forested area in Daxing'an Ling Prefecture, Heilongjiang province, in north-east China. Her first publication was a novella "Shining Fireflies" (《闪亮的萤火虫》) in 1981. In 1984 she graduated from East China Normal University's Department of language and literature, and then worked as an editor at the Shanghai Children's Press (少年儿童出版社). She is now Director-General of the Shanghai Board on Books for Young People (SHBBY, part of IBBY), Vice President of the Shanghai Writers Association, and a National Committee Member of the China Writers Association. Qin's novels have been adapted for films and TV series, and have attained China's highest honours for film and TV series. Her works have been translated into English, Dutch, Japanese, Korean, and other languages.

While drawing on deep Chinese traditions, she has also laid new foundations for young readers.[1]
