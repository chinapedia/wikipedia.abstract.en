LION CREEK AND LOWER RAYPITS is a 65.2 hectare nature reserve east of Canewdon in Essex. It is part of the Crouch and Roach Estuaries Site of Special Scientific Interest,[1][2] and is owned and managed by the Essex Wildlife Trust.[3]

The former creek has been cut off from the Crouch Estuary by a seawall, and it has salt marsh plants such as golden samphire and sea-spurrey. There is a bird hide from which many species of sea birds can be seen. Lower Raypits can be accessed from Lion Creek by the seawall path. It has a variety of pasture, salt marsh and intertidal habitats, with nationally scarce plants such as beaked tasselweed, sea barley, grass vetchling and curved hard-grass. Invertebrates include Roesel's bush-cricket.[4]

There is access from the road between Canewdon and Wallasea Island.[5]
