LEAGUE OF SOCIALISTS OF THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT OF IRAN () or SOCIETY OF IRANIAN SOCIALISTS () was a socialist nationalist party in Iran.

The party formally joined the Socialist International upon establishment.[1]

It was founded in 1960 by Third Force activists led by Khalil Maleki and a number of radical nationalists, most of whom had social democracy leanings and some members with Islamic socialism tendencies. Hossein Malek, Ahmad Sayyed Javadi and Jalal Al-e-Ahmad were among people associated with the group.[2]

The organization was a founding member of the National Front (II)[3] and was considered the "extereme left-wing" within the front.[4] It broke with the front and joined the National Democratic Front after the Iranian Revolution.[5] In the 1980 Iranian presidential election, the group supported People's Mujahedin of Iran nominee Masoud Rajavi.[6]
