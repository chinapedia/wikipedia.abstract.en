JEFFREY LYNNE (born 30 December 1947) is an English songwriter, singer, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist from Birmingham who co-founded the rock band Electric Light Orchestra (ELO). The group formed in 1970 as an offshoot of the Move, of which Lynne was also a member. Following the departure of Roy Wood in 1972, Lynne assumed sole leadership of the band and wrote, arranged and produced virtually all of its subsequent records. Before, Lynne was also involved with the Idle Race as a founding member and principal songwriter.

After ELO's original disbandment in 1986, Lynne released two solo albums: _Armchair Theatre_ (1990) and _Long Wave_ (2012). Additionally, he began producing various artists. In 1988, under the pseudonyms OTIS WILBURY and CLAYTON WILBURY, he co-founded the supergroup Traveling Wilburys with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty. Lynne's songwriting and production collaborations with former Beatles led him to co-produce their _Anthology_ reunion singles "Free as a Bird" (1995) and "Real Love" (1996). In 2014, Lynne reformed ELO and resumed concert touring under the moniker "Jeff Lynne's ELO".

Lynne produced all fifteen ELO singles that rose to the Top 10 record charts in the UK. His producing credits also include the UK or US Top 10 albums _Cloud Nine_ (Harrison, 1987), _Mystery Girl_ (Orbison, 1989), _Full Moon Fever_ (Petty, 1989), _Into the Great Wide Open_ (Petty, 1991), _Flaming Pie_ (Paul McCartney, 1997) and _Get Up!_ (Bryan Adams, 2015). In 2014, Lynne received a star on the Birmingham Walk of Stars, and in 2015, was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He received three Ivor Novello Awards including the award for Outstanding Services to British Music.[1] In 2017, Lynne was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of ELO.[2]


Musical career

Early life and career

Lynne was born to Nancy and Philip Lynne and grew up in Shard End, Birmingham, England where he attended Alderlea Boys' Secondary School.[3] As a native of Birmingham he has a flat Brummie accent.[4] His first guitar, an acoustic instrument, was bought for him by his father for £2.[5] He was still playing it in 2012.[6] In 1963 he formed a group with Robert Reader and David Walsh using little more than Spanish guitars and cheap electrical instruments. They were originally named the Rockin' Hellcats, then the Handicaps and finally the Andicaps. They practised at Shard End Community Centre and performed weekly. However, in 1964, Robert Reader and David Walsh left the band and Lynne brought in replacements. At the end of 1964, Lynne decided to leave the band to replace Mick Adkins of the local band "the Chads".[7]

Some time in or after 1965, he acquired his first item of studio recording equipment, a Bang & Olufsen 'Beocord 2000 De Luxe' stereo reel-to-reel tape recorder, which allowed multi-tracking between left and right channels.[8][9] He says it "taught me how to be a producer".[10] In 1966, Lynne joined the line-up of the Nightriders as guitarist, having responded to an advertisement in the Birmingham Evening Mail[11]. The band would soon change their name to the Idle Race. Despite recording two critically acclaimed albums with the band and producing the second, success eluded him. In 1970, Lynne accepted an offer from friend Roy Wood to join the line-up of the more successful band the Move.[12]

1970–86: The Move and ELO

Lynne contributed many songs to the Move's last two albums while formulating, with Roy Wood and Bev Bevan, a band built around a fusion of rock and classical music - a project which would eventually become the highly successful Electric Light Orchestra (ELO). The original idea was that both bands would exist in tandem.[13] Bevan has, however, since suggested that Lynne had little interest in the Move, stating:

_"The only reason Jeff Lynne ever joined the Move was to form a new band. He was never interested in being a part of the Move. It was a good, money-earning band. It really subsidised the beginning of ELO for getting musicians in and recording and rehearsals and stuff. Jeff never wanted to be in the Move. He wanted to form a new band."_[14]

Problems led to Wood's departure from ELO in 1972, after the band's eponymous first album, leaving Lynne as the band's dominant creative force.[15] Thereafter followed a succession of band personnel changes and increasingly popular albums: 1973's _ELO 2_ and _On the Third Day_, 1974's _Eldorado_ and 1975's _Face the Music_. By 1976's _A New World Record_, Lynne had almost developed the roots of the group into a more complex and unique pop-rock sound mixed with studio strings, layered vocals, and tight, catchy pop singles. Lynne's now almost complete creative dominance as producer, songwriter, arranger, lead singer and guitarist could make ELO appear to be an almost solo effort. However, the ELO sound and the focus of Lynne's writing was also shaped by Louis Clark's and Richard Tandy's co-arranging, under Lynne's direction (notably the large string sections), and Bev Bevan's drumming, while Richard Tandy's integration of the Moog, harmonium, and Mellotron, with more novel keyboard technology, gave Lynne's songs a more symphonic sound. Kelly Groucutt's distinctive voice mixed with Lynne's to produce the classic ELO harmonic vocal sound.

The pinnacle of ELO's chart success and worldwide popularity was the expansive 1977 double album _Out of the Blue_, which was largely conceived in a Swiss chalet during a two-week writing marathon.[16] The band's 1978 world tour featured an elaborate "space ship" set and laser light show. In order to recreate the complex instrumental textures of their albums, the band used pre-recorded supplemental backing tracks in live performances. Although that practice has now become commonplace, it caused considerable derision in the press of the time.[17] Lynne has often stated that he prefers the creative environment of the studio to the rigours and tedium of touring. In 1979, Lynne followed up the success of _Out of the Blue_ with _Discovery_, which held No. 1 in the UK for 5 weeks. The album is primarily associated with its two disco-flavoured singles ("Shine a Little Love" and "Last Train to London") and with the title's word play on "disco" and "very".[18] However, the remaining seven non-disco tracks on the album reflected Lynne's range as a pop-rock songwriter, including a heavy, mid-tempo rock anthem ("Don't Bring Me Down") that, despite its use of a drum loop, could be considered the antithesis of disco. Lynne later recalled his forays into dance music: "I love the force of disco. I love the freedom it gave me to make different rhythms across it. I enjoyed that really steady driving beat. Just steady as a rock. I’ve always liked that simplicity in the bass drum."[19]

In 1979, Lynne rejected an offer for ELO to headline the Knebworth Concert in the UK, allowing Led Zeppelin to headline instead. In the absence of any touring to support _Discovery_, Lynne had time to contribute five tracks to the soundtrack for the 1980 film musical _Xanadu_. The score yielded three Top 40 singles: "I'm Alive" (UK No. 20), "All Over The World" (UK No. 11), and the title track "Xanadu", which reached number one in the UK. Nevertheless, Lynne was not closely involved with the development of the film, and his material consequently had only superficial attachment to the plot. _Xanadu_ performed weakly at the box office (although it later has experienced popularity as a cult favourite). Lynne subsequently disavowed his limited contribution to the project.[20]

In 1981, Lynne took the band in a somewhat different direction with the science-fiction themed album _Time_, reaching number one for two weeks in the UK, producing the second Top 3 single in less than two years. The strings were still featured, but with heavily synthesised textures. Following a marginally successful tour, Lynne kept this general approach with 1983's _Secret Messages_ and a final contractually-obligated ELO album _Balance of Power_ in 1986. Lynne discusses the contractually-obligated nature of the final albums on the short interview included with the 'Zoom' DVD. ELO now had only three remaining official members (Lynne, Bevan and Tandy), and Lynne began devoting more time to producing. During his time in the Electric Light Orchestra, Lynne did manage to release a few recordings under his own name. In 1976, Lynne covered the Beatles songs "With a Little Help from My Friends" and "Nowhere Man" for _All This and World War II_. In 1977, Lynne released his first solo single, the disco-flavoured "Doin' That Crazy Thing"/"Goin' Down to Rio". Despite ELO's high-profile at that time, it received little airplay and failed to chart.

In 1984, Lynne and Tandy contributed two original songs "Video!" and "Let It Run" to the film _Electric Dreams_ (they also provided a third song, "Sooner Or Later", which was released as the b-side of "Video!"). Lynne also wrote the song "The Story of Me," which was recorded by the Everly Brothers on their comeback album _EB84_. Even before the official end of ELO, Lynne began his move toward focusing almost exclusively on studio production work. Lynne produced and wrote the 1983 top-40 hit "Slipping Away" for Dave Edmunds and played on sessions (with Tandy) for Edmunds' album, _Information_. Lynne also produced six tracks on Edmunds' follow-up album in 1984, _Riff Raff_. In contrast to the dense, boomy, baroque sound of ELO, Lynne's post-ELO studio work has tended toward more minimal, acoustic instrumentation and a sparse, "organic" quality that generally favours light room ambience and colouration over artificial reverb, especially on vocals. Lynne's recordings also often feature the jangling compressed acoustic guitar sound pioneered by Roger McGuinn and a heavily gated snare drum sound.

1987–91: Traveling Wilburys

Lynne's influence by the Beatles was clearly evident in his ELO work, and the connection to the Beatles was strengthened when Lynne produced George Harrison's _Cloud Nine._[21] The latter was a successful comeback album for Harrison, released in 1987, featuring the popular singles "Got My Mind Set on You", "When We Was Fab" (where Lynne played the violin in the video) and "This Is Love", the last two of which were co-written by Lynne. Lynne's association with Harrison led to the 1988 formation of the Traveling Wilburys, a studio "supergroup" that also included Tom Petty, Bob Dylan and Roy Orbison and resulted in two albums (_Vol. 1_ and _Vol. 3_), both produced by Harrison and Lynne.[22] In 1988, Lynne also worked on Orbison's album _Mystery Girl_,[23] co-writing and producing Orbison's last major hit, "You Got It", plus two other tracks on that album. For _Rock On!_, the final Del Shannon album, Lynne co-wrote "Walk Away" and finished off several tracks after Shannon's death.

In 1989, Lynne co-produced _Full Moon Fever_ by Tom Petty,[24] which included the hit singles "Free Fallin'", "I Won't Back Down" and "Runnin' Down a Dream", all co-written by Lynne. This album and _Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1_ received nominations for the Grammy Award for Best Album of the Year in 1989. The Traveling Wilburys won a Grammy for "Best Rock Performance By a Duo or Group with Vocal" that year.[25] Lynne's song "One Way Love" was released as a single by Agnetha Fältskog and appeared on her second post-ABBA album, _Eyes of a Woman_. Lynne co-wrote and produced the track "Let It Shine" for Beach Boys founder Brian Wilson's first solo album in 1988. Lynne also contributed three tracks to an album by Duane Eddy and "Falling in Love" on _Land of Dreams_ for Randy Newman.

In 1990, Lynne collaborated on the Wilburys' follow up _Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3_[26] and released his first solo album _Armchair Theatre_.[27] The album featured Harrison and Tandy and included the singles "Every Little Thing" and "Lift Me Up". It received some positive critical attention but little commercial success. Lynne also provided the song "Wild Times" to the motion picture soundtrack _Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves_ in 1991. In 1991, Lynne returned to the studio with Petty, co-writing and producing the album _Into the Great Wide Open_ for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, which featured the singles "Learning to Fly" and "Into the Great Wide Open". The following year he produced Roy Orbison's posthumous album _King of Hearts_, featuring the single "I Drove All Night".

1990s–2000s

In February 1994, Lynne worked with the three surviving Beatles on the _Anthology_ album series.[28] At Harrison's request, Lynne was brought in to assist in reevaluating John Lennon's original studio material. The songs "Free as a Bird"[29] and "Real Love" were created by digitally processing Lennon's demos for the songs and overdubbing the three surviving band members to form a virtual Beatles reunion that the band had mutually eschewed during Lennon's lifetime. Lynne has also produced records for Ringo Starr and worked on Paul McCartney's Grammy nominated album _Flaming Pie_.[30]

Lynne's work in the 1990s also includes production of a 1993 album for singer-songwriter Julianna Raye entitled _Something Peculiar_ and production or songwriting contributions to albums by Roger McGuinn (_Back from Rio_) and Joe Cocker (_Night Calls_), songs by Aerosmith ("Lizard Love"), Tom Jones ("Lift Me Up"), Bonnie Tyler ("Time Mends a Broken Heart"), the film _Still Crazy_, Hank Marvin ("Wonderful Land" and "Nivram"), Et Moi ("Drole De Vie") and the Tandy Morgan Band ("Action"). In 1996, Lynne was officially recognised by his peers when he was awarded the Ivor Novello Award for "Outstanding Contributions to British Music" for a second time.

Bev Bevan sold his 50% rights to the ELO name to Lynne, after Lynne initiated legal action regarding Bevan's touring group ELO Part II.[31][32] This allowed Lynne to release a new album in 2001 under the ELO moniker entitled _Zoom_.[33] The album featured guest appearances by Ringo Starr, George Harrison and Richard Tandy, with Lynne multi-tracking a majority of the instruments and vocals. The album received positive reviews but had no hit singles.[34] It was marketed as a "return to the classic ELO sound"[35] in an attempt to connect with a loyal body of fans and to jump-start a planned concert tour (with Lynne and Tandy as the only returning original ELO members). While a live performance was taped at CBS Television City over two consecutive nights and shown on PBS (with subsequent DVD release), the tour itself was cancelled.[36]

Earlier in 2001, Lynne began working with George Harrison on what would turn out to be Harrison's final album, _Brainwashed_.[37] After Harrison's death from cancer on 29 November 2001, Lynne returned to the studio in 2002 to help finish the uncompleted album.[38] Lynne was heavily involved in the memorial _Concert for George_, held at London's Royal Albert Hall in November 2002, which also featured Traveling Wilburys member Petty. Lynne sang the lead vocal on "The Inner Light", "I Want to Tell You" and "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)", and subsequently produced the Surround Sound audio mix for the _Concert for George_ DVD, released in November 2003, which later received a Grammy. Lynne reunited in 2006 with Petty to produce the latter's third solo release, _Highway Companion_.[39] In 2004, Lynne and Petty inducted Harrison into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,[40] then played "Handle with Care" with Dhani Harrison,[41] also "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" adding Prince, Steve Winwood, and others.[42]

In a Reuters article on 23 April 2009, Lynne said that he had been working on the follow-up to his 1990 solo debut album _Armchair Theatre_ with a possible tentative release date of "later this year".[43] He also produced four tracks on Regina Spektor's fifth album _Far_, released 23 June 2009.[44]

2010s

In a March 2010 interview with the _Daily Express_ newspaper, Lynne confirmed he was working on a new album with Joe Walsh and simultaneously "writing a couple of albums under his own name, though he won't tell us in which musical direction he's heading." Lynne contributed a cover of Buddy Holly's "Words of Love" for the tribute album _Listen to Me: Buddy Holly_, which was released on 6 September 2011.[45] On 31 December 2011, Brian Williams reported on NBC New Year's Eve with Carson Daly that "2012 releases will include rare new work from Jeff Lynne."[46]

In 2012, Walsh released his _Analog Man_ album which was produced by Lynne.[47] Lynne's second solo album, a covers album entitled _Long Wave_, was released on 8 October 2012. A greatest hits collection of re-recorded ELO songs by Lynne titled _Mr. Blue Sky: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra_ was also released under the ELO moniker on the same day.[48] Lynne suggested that a new album with original material may be released during 2013.[49] In 2012, Lynne and Tandy teamed up at Lynne's Bungalow Palace home studios to record a live set of ELO's songs. This was broadcast on TV as part of the _Mr. Blue Sky_ documentary.[50] Lynne and Tandy reunited again on 12 November 2013 to perform, under the name Jeff Lynne and Friends, "Livin' Thing" and "Mr. Blue Sky" at the Children in Need Rocks concert at Hammersmith Eventim Apollo, London.[51]

On 9 February 2014, Lynne performed George Harrison's "Something" with Joe Walsh and Dhani Harrison[52] on _The Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to The Beatles_, as well as "Hey Bulldog" from the _Yellow Submarine soundtrack_, while accompanying Dave Grohl, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Beatles' performance on _The Ed Sullivan Show_.[53] On 5 March 2014, Lynne received an honorary doctorate degree from Birmingham City University. He also mentioned he was working with Bryan Adams on new material.[54] On 14 September 2014, Jeff Lynne and his touring band, under the name Jeff Lynne's ELO, played a public concert for the first time in over 25 years, headlining at the Radio 2 festival in Hyde Park, London.[55] Never particularly enthusiastic for live performance even in his younger days, Lynne has called this event "easily the best concert I've ever been involved with".[56]

On 8 February 2015, Lynne appeared at the Grammy Awards, playing "Evil Woman" and "Mr. Blue Sky" with Ed Sheeran.[57]

On 10 September 2015, Lynne's website announced he had signed a contract to deliver an album of new ELO music for Columbia Records marking the first time in 14 years new ELO music would be released.[58] On 24 September 2015, "When I Was a Boy", the first single from _Alone in the Universe_ was released on the internet with a music video scheduled not long after. The album was released on 13 November 2015[59] and was followed by promotional shows including the first ELO shows in the United States in 30 years. A 2016 European tour was scheduled, with Dublin, Amsterdam and Zurich being some of the locations toured. Notably, the Dublin concert was delayed by a week due to medical advice given to Lynne.[60]

On 24 June 2017, Lynne performed at Wembley Stadium to a crowd of 60,000, playing a 24-song setlist including 'Xanadu', 'Do Ya' and 'Twilight'. The concert was released on DVD and CD, under the title _Wembley or Bust_.[61]

On August 2, 2018, Lynne and his band Jeff Lynne's ELO began a 10-city tour of North America which included the US cities of Oakland, California and Los Angeles, Denver, Houston, Dallas, Rosemont, Illinois, Detroit, New York City, Philadelphia and Toronto.[62]

On September 12, 2018, Jeff Lynne's ELO began a tour throughout Europe including dates in Stockholm, Oslo, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Berlin, Munich, Mannheim, Vienna, Amsterdam, Nottingham, Glasgow, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Birmingham, Leeds, London, Liverpool, Dublin, and Belfast.[63]

On June 20, 2019, Jeff Lynnes’s ELO began a North American tour with Dhani Harrison.[64]


Personal life

Lynne has been married twice: first to Rosemary (née Adams, b. 1952) in 1972[65] (divorced 1977) and then to Sandi Kapelson in 1979, with whom he has two daughters: Laura (born December 1979) and Stephanie (born 1981).[66] He is a fan of Birmingham City F.C.[67]
