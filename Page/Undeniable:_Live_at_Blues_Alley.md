Reception

Allmusic reviewed the album stating "_Undeniable: Live at Blues Alley_ is a memorable document of Martino's June 2009 appearance at the Washington, D.C. club." [2] JazzTimes observed "Recorded live with a brilliant all-star group, this is one of his best recordings for years." [3] Downbeat noted "The shuffle march that drives 'Midnight Special' does its job by hustling everything along, but Monaco's stormy exposition and Martino's fluid romp play havoc with the groove while steadfastly fanning its flames."
