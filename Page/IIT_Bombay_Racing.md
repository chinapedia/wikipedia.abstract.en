IIT BOMBAY RACING[1] is a Formula Student team from India based at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay since 2007. The team consists of 70 members who aim to conceive, design and fabricate a formula style racecar through innovation to compete in international Formula Student events.

IIT Bombay Racing made its debut at Formula Student Michigan, 2008 with an entry car Vayu as only Indian team participating in the event. In the following year, the team participated in Formula Student UK, 2009 at Silverstone Circuit with entry car Agni[2] and was 2nd best Asian entry at Formula Student UK. The team also achieved highest score among Indian participating teams along with a 2nd rank in Cost Event.

In the year 2012, IIT Bombay Racing developed Prithvi 3.0 securing 1st in low weight sustainability and won the best car award by peers at the Baja SAE India event held at Pithampur. The same year also witnessed the launch of EVo 1.0,[3] India's first student designed electric racing vehicle.

Since 2012, the team has launched 5 electric vehicles with giant leaps in design and performance. Recently IIT Bombay Racing's 5th electric Racecar Orca participated in FSAE UK, 2016.


Team Philosophy

IIT Bombay Racing team has been a unique team being a leading Indian team developing electric race car. The team is driven by a common vision of 'Revolutionizing electric mobility in India focusing on sustainable technologies and innovations'. Bringing electric car technologies in India has been goal of the team for last 5 years. The team has been working besides competition to increase awareness about electric vehicle technologies in Indian society. It has aided many Indian FSAE teams to develop own electric vehicle. The team will further continue to prove power of electric vehicles.
