Early life

Johnson was born in the East Flatbush[3] section of New York City's, Borough of Brooklyn to Jamaican parents. He attended Humanities Preparatory Academy in New York City. His introduction to music came at the age of 10 when he grew fascinated with the discipline of DJing after watching a neighbor who held the profession of a DJ.[4] This eventually lead to opportunities for Ricky to provide support and assistance to the neighborhood DJs by keeping the party going when they needed to step away, ultimately leading him to become a full-on DJ and promoter/organizer of parties and events by the age of 15.[5]

While DJing, Ricky's interest in music production and songwriting began to develop, pushing him to develop his skills in this area. At the age of 17, Ricky officially made the transition from DJing to music production, singing, and songwriting.[6]

He credits Reggae and R&B pioneers Dennis Brown, Peter Tosh, and Gloria Gaynor for his early musical influence.
