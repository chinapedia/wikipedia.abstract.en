The MADNGELLA, otherwise known as the _Matngala_ or _Hermit Hill tribe_, are an indigenous Australian people of the Northern Territory, Australia.


Language

The Madngella spoke Matngele, one of the Eastern Daly languages, now extinct.


Country

The Madngella lived traditionally in the middle and lower reaches of the Daly River nearby to the Mulluk-Mulluk people. Norman Tindale assigned to them some of tribal land around Hermit Hill, and the area west of the Daly River, placing them to the southeast of the Yunggor people. The Pongaponga lay to their north.


Social system

In the [[Mulluk-Mulluk|_merbok]] system of ceremonial exchange, the Madngella used the words in a way that indicated the coastal provenance of the articles (_ninymer_) exchanged, north-easterly and south-westerly._Medrdok_from the former direction was called_pork'' _padaka_, as opposed to the south-westerly merbok, called_nim berinken,_where_berinken_ is a generic term used of tribe(s) living south-west of the Madngella.


Circumcision

A technique used in native medicine by the Madngella to heal infections to the penis after ritual circumcision had been performed was described by the Norwegian ethnographer Knut Dahl.


History

The Madngella tribe had experienced intense culture shock in the wake of white settlement, whose effects over 50Â years, according to who studied them in the early 1930s, had been to disintegrate many of their attachments to the traditional way of life.

Jesuit missionaries, after several endeavours to set up a station in the general area of the Daly River, eventually managed to establish a viable community at Hermit Hill.
