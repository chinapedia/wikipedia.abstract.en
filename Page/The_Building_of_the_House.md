Snape_maltings_1975.jpg _THE BUILDING OF THE HOUSE_, op. 79 is an "overture with or without chorus" by Benjamin Britten written in 1967. The overture is notable for the use of Asian-influenced heterophony.[1]

_THE BUILDING OF THE HOUSE_, which had previously only been heard in the Snape Maltings Concert Hall on the night of its premiere, was again performed there for the 2017 Aldeburgh Festival of Music and the Arts, marking the fiftieth anniversary of the composition.


Text

The optional text is taken from Psalm 127, adapted by Imogen Holst from _The Whole Book of Psalms (set in English)_. It is set using the chorale melody Vater unser im Himmelreich.


History

The piece was written for the inauguration of the Snape Maltings concert hall, which took place in June 1967.[2] This has been described as the first performance,[3] although it was played at the opening of the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London which took place earlier the same year.[4]
