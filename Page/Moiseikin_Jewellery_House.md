MOISEIKIN JEWELLERY HOUSE is a Russian jewellery production company based in Ekaterinburg. The production is mainly based on minerals and gems that are mined in Ural Mountains—these are famous for its rich natural resources. Some of the company's luxury goods are known internationally.


The company

The company was founded in 1993[1] by businessman Viktor Moiseikin and is named after him.

Moiseikin Jewellery House has developed and patented internationally some unique technologies of jewelry production such as Waltzing Brilliance.[2] According to _Rapaport Magazine_, "this technology both secures the diamonds and allows them to rotate gently around the axis created by the two points of contact"[3]—and "this is the first patented jewelry invention for Russia in the past 100 years".

The company regularly showcases its works at multiple international luxury exhibitions.[4][5] It also provides prizes for ceremonies such as "Person of the Year" business event held annually in Ekaterinburg.[6]
