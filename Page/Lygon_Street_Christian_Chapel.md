LYGON STREET CHRISTIAN CHAPEL is an Evangelical church in the inner-city suburb of Carlton, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, built in 1865, and designed by architect W.M. Moore.[1] The services were led by a 'preacher'. The preacher prior to February 1867 was American Reverend H.S. Earl. He was replaced by fellow Americans T.J. Gore and G.L. Surben.[2][3]

The chapel contains a "fine example of late 19th century organ building" with an original working organ thought to have been made by Fincham & Hobday in the early 1890s, installed in the chapel in 1913.[4]
