_CALADENIA ATROVESPA_, commonly known as the THIN-CLUBBED MANTIS ORCHID, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to New South Wales. It is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy leaf. The species was first formally described by David Jones in 2008 and given the name _Arachnorchis atrovespa_ from a specimen collected on Black Mountain in the Australian Capital Territory. The description was published in _The Orchadian_.[1] In 2010, Gary Backhouse changed the name to _Caladenia atrovespa_.[2] The specific epithet (atrovespa) is derived from the Latin words _atra_ meaning "black"[3] and _vespa_ meaning "wasp".[4]
