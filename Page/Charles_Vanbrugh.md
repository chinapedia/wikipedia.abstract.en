In 1709 he was replaced by Captain Robert Paston under whose command the _Feversham_ was shipwrecked on 7 October 1711 with the loss of 102 lives. _Feversham_ was on a voyage from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to New York City after participating in Admiral Hovenden Walker's disastrous expedition to Quebec.[2]
