_STAR TREK: BRIDGE CREW_ is a virtual reality action-adventure video game developed by Red Storm Entertainment and published by Ubisoft for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4.


Plot

_Star Trek: Bridge Crew_ takes place in the timeline established in the 2009 _Star Trek_ film and sees the Starfleet ship USS _Aegis_ searching for a new homeworld for the Vulcans after the destruction of their planet. The ship heads for a region of space called 'The Trench', which is being occupied by Klingons.[1]


Gameplay

The game is played through four roles: captain, tactical officer, engineer and helm officer. The captain is the only role to which mission objectives are directly displayed; they are responsible for communicating these to the crew and issuing orders to accomplish them. The helm officer controls the ship's course and travel between regions through impulse or warp drive. The tactical officer is in charge of sensors and weapons. The engineer manages the ship's power distribution and supervises repairs. Each role except the captain may be occupied by a human player or by an NPC indirectly controlled by the captain. Both story and randomly generated missions exist.[2]

In December 2017, the game developers modified the game so that it can be played without a virtual-reality headset. Prior to that, the game could only be played using a headset.[3]


Development

It was developed by Red Storm Entertainment and published by Ubisoft. Series actors Karl Urban, LeVar Burton and Jeri Ryan appeared at E3 2016 to promote the game during Ubisoft's press conference.[4] A new trailer was showcased at CES 2017.[5] The game was released on May 30, 2017.[6]


Reception

_Star Trek: Bridge Crew_ received "generally positive" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[7][8] _Eurogamer_ ranked it 42nd on their list of the "Top 50 Games of 2017",[9] while _GamesRadar+_ ranked it 25th on their list of the 25 Best Games of 2017.[10]

In 2017, _PC Gamer_ ranked _Star Trek: Bridge Crew_ among the best _Star Trek_ games.[11]
