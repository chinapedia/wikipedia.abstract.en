HILSEA BARRACKS was a military installation at Hilsea in Portsmouth.


History

The site was originally occupied by Gatcombe Manor, a medieval house which was acquired through marriage by Admiral Sir Roger Curtis in the 18th century.[1] The War Office requisitioned the site from Curtis for military purposes in the 1770s.[2] The garrison commander's house, which was rebuilt in 1780, evolved to become the officers' mess and survives as a Grade II listed building.[3]

A plan for barracks on the site was first drawn up by William Dundas in 1756, in connection with the construction of Hilsea Lines (designed to protect Portsmouth and its Dockyard from landward attack). As designed, the barracks consisted of rows of long wooden huts arranged around three sides of a parade ground.[4] Building commenced in 1780 and the barracks, built to accommodate several thousand troops, were completed in 1794.[5] In 1854 they were rebuilt, on a more permanent basis, for occupation by the Royal Field Artillery: a military chapel known as "St Barbara's Garrison Church" was added in 1888.[6] The Royal Field Artillery vacated the site in 1921 when it became the main headquarters and training depot for the Royal Army Ordnance Corps.[7] During the Second World War the site was used by the United States Army.[8] The RAOC vacated the site on 31 March 1962.[9] The buildings, which had undergone various improvements and changes of use over the years, were demolished to make way for the "Gatcombe Park" housing development in 1965.[10]
