CHRISTINE MICHELLE METZ (born September 29, 1980)[1] is an American actress and singer. She is known for playing Kate Pearson in the NBC drama _This Is Us_, for which she has earned Best Supporting Actress nominations at the Primetime Emmy Awards (2017) and Golden Globe Awards (2017 and 2018).


Early life

Metz was born to Denise and Mark Metz in Homestead, Florida.[2] She spent her formative years in Japan, where her father was stationed. The family later moved back to Gainesville, Florida, where she attended elementary, middle, and high school.[3][4] She grew up with her mother, stepfather, two siblings, two half-siblings, and her dog, Jack.[5][6]

Metz has stated that her first job was at McDonald's in Gainesville, Florida so she could afford to purchase a $120 pair of sneakers that her mother wouldn't agree to pay for. She fondly recalls how her manager treated both her and her fellow employees with respect and dignity, and how she learned early on the benefits of hard work and the advantages one can gain from being nice to other people.[7]


Career

Metz is best known for her role as Kate Pearson in the NBC drama series _This Is Us_, which earned her Primetime Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations. She is also known for her role in FX's _American Horror Story: Freak Show_.[8][9]

Metz is a singer in her band Chrissy and The Vapors.[10]

In early 2018, it was announced that Metz would star in _Breakthrough_, working with producer DeVon Franklin.[11] She is cast as Joyce Smith, the mother of John, a 14-year-old boy who fell through an icy Missouri lake and was proclaimed dead. The movie, based on the book written by Smith herself, tells the story of how a mother takes credit for bringing her son back to life through prayer.

Metz studies with acting coach John Kirby.[12]


Personal life

On January 5, 2008, Metz married British journalist Martyn Eaden in a Santa Barbara, California, court house ceremony.[13] They separated in January 2013, and Eaden filed for divorce from Metz in November 2014, citing "irreconcilable differences".[14] On December 11, 2015, their divorce was finalized.
