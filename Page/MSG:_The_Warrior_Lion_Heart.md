Critical reception

Devarsi Ghosh of _India Today_ wrote "MSG The Warrior Lion Heart is not a film. Like the previous MSG (Messenger of God) films, this too is a propaganda piece made by the subject of the said propaganda, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh himself".[23] Mihir Bhanage of _The Times of India_ gave it 1.5 stars out of 5, describing the film as indicative of Singh's self-obsession. Bhanage wrote, "It takes guts to roll out such preachy and glorified films, but the saga continues with a devil-may-care attitude."[24]

Anshu Lal of _Firstpost_ described the film as "horrible". Specific criticism was centered on problems in storytelling, such as the use of pop-up video. Lal wrote, "Because without that pop up, how would the poor audience comprehend the concept of background narration, right?"[25] Lal also criticised the plot, the acting, and the cartoonish nature of the film. Namrata Thakker of _Rediff.com_ gave it half star out of 5, and wrote that it is only for die hard fans of Singh's.[26] Aakash Karkare of _Scroll.in_ wrote that movie is every bit as terrible as you expect it to be.[27]

According to _The Times of India_ the film collected approximately 32 million in its first weekend with an estimated total of 46 million after five days.[28] _Box Office India_ tallied the worldwide gross at approximately 176.7 million.[29] According to _Bollywood Hungama_ the film collected approximately 1.13 million in just one week.[30] International Business Times stated that movie had a gross of 1.50 million.[31]
