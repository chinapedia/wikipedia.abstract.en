PAUL J. MCAULEY (born 23 April 1955) is a British botanist and science fiction author.

A biologist by training, McAuley writes mostly hard science fiction. His novels dealing with themes such as biotechnology, alternative history/alternative reality, and space travel.

McAuley began with far-future space opera _Four Hundred Billion Stars_, its sequel _Eternal Light_, and the planetary-colony adventure _Of the Fall_. _Red Dust_, set on a far-future Mars colonized by the Chinese, is a planetary romance featuring many emerging technologies and SF motifs: nanotechnology, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, personality downloads, virtual reality. The Confluence series, set in an even more distant future (about ten million years from now), is one of a number of novels to use Frank J. Tipler's Omega Point Theory (that the universe seems to be evolving toward a maximum degree of complexity and consciousness) as one of its themes.[1] About the same time, he published _Pasquale's Angel_, set in an alternative Italian Renaissance and featuring Niccolò Machiavegli (Machiavelli) and Leonardo da Vinci as major characters.

McAuley has also used biotechnology and nanotechnology themes in near-future settings: _Fairyland_ describes a dystopian, war-torn Europe where genetically engineered "dolls" are used as disposable slaves. Since 2001 he has produced several SF-based techno-thrillers such as _The Secret of Life_, _Whole Wide World_, and _White Devils_.

_Four Hundred Billion Stars_, his first novel, won the Philip K. Dick Award in 1988.[2] _Fairyland_ won the 1996 Arthur C. Clarke Award[3] and the 1997 John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best SF Novel.[4] "The Temptation of Dr. Stein", won the British Fantasy Award. _Pasquale's Angel_ won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History (Long Form).
