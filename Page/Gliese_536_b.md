GLIESE 536 B also known as GJ 536 B[1][2][3] is a nearby[4][5][6] Super-Earth sized exoplanet orbiting within the circumstellar habitable zone of the red dwarf (M1)[7] star Gliese 536 every 8.7 days. Due to its short orbital period it could help with future studies of biological activity on exoplanets.[8]

This exoplanet is given the title Super-Earth due to its immense size which is more that five times greater than the Earth. Like many other rocky exoplanets, Gliese 536 b should be part of a large planetary group. Astronomers are still in search of other planets that are in orbit of star Gliese 536.[9]
