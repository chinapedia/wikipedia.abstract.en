_NA MOONEYS_ is the debut (eponymous) self-produced album from Irish folk music band Na Mooneys, released in October 2016.[1][2][3][4]


History

Na Mooneys was formed in late 2013 / early 2014 by Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh (from Irish folk music band Altan) and her siblings Anna Ní Mhaonaigh and Gearóid Ó Maonaigh along with Ciarán Ó Maonaigh (Gearóid's son[5] and Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh's nephew), on the occasion of the very last Frankie Kennedy Winter School where they performed their first ever show.

As Irish News' critic Robert McMillen wrote on 28 October 2016: "the group's roots are to be found in the rural Donegal Gaeltacht and go back several generations. [Indeed], the musical DNA from Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh's [grandparents]—Róise Bheag Róise Móire, her melodeon-playing grandmother who died very soon after [Mairéad's] parents married in 1954 [and] her grandfather Francie—would have passed through to Mairéad's father, Francie Mooney, the man who wrote "Gleanntáin Ghlas' Ghaoth Dobhair" and much more."[6]

On their Facebook page (created on 7 January 2016), the band describe themselves as "a family of musicians & singers from the Donegal Gaeltacht" playing Irish traditional music.[7]


Recording

The band Na Mooneys recorded their debut family album _Na Mooneys_ in early 2016[8][9][10] in Manus Lunny's studios in Co. Donegal, Ireland.

About the recording and the choice of the album track listing, Mairéad explained in an October 2016 interview by Irish News' critic Robert McMillen: "We took a few tunes that my father played a lot as well. It was very important to show the repertoire that we played regularly as a family in session. Some are well known, but we played them to honour the family sessions so we decided not to overproduce the album and most of the tunes are played live."[11]


Release

_Na Mooneys_ was officially launched on 6 October 2016 on Rónán Beo, RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta.[12][13][14][15] On the radio show which occurred in RnaG studios, Na Mooneys talked about their debut album and performed live exclusive versions from it,[16] including a (short) one: the (2 marches) medley "Suffering Ducks / The Cavanman's Daughter" (2:21), track 14 on the album.[17]


Critical reception

On 28 October 2016, _Na Mooneys_ received a warm review from Irish News' critic Robert McMillen, stating: "It goes without saying that this is an album with a superb pedigree and the thing I liked about it most is that it sounds as if you were there in the Mooney household, either in Slíochán or in Cois Chlaidí. It is full of energy, the songs are really great and there's something different with the treatment of even the very well-known tunes."[18]

On 2 November 2016, _Na Mooneys_ received another warm review, this time from Irish Music Magazine's critic Alex Monaghan, stating: "The family album to end all family albums, Na Mooneys' eponymous release is a joy from end to end. Reels, highlands, jigs, mazurkas, marches, a fiddle air and four songs in Donegal Irish: this is the music which made Altan a worldwide favourite, the tradition of the Dohertys and the Byrnes, Tommy Peoples and Johnny Doran, and of course Francie Mooney and his family. [...] It's all brilliant music, masterfully played by Na Mooneys. The big question, of course, is why has it taken them so long?"[19]

In the January–February 2017 issue of (French magazine) Trad' Mag, folk critic Philippe Cousin awarded _Na Mooneys_ full marks (giving the album a "Bravo!!!" award), calling it a "superb album" and stating: "[The album] highlights all the brilliance of these talented musicians' skills."
