JACKIE SHARKEY or JACK SHARKEY (born GIOVANNI CERVATI) was an Italian-born American boxer who made a claim to the World Bantamweight Title on August 15, 1919 defeating reigning champion Pete Herman in a fifteen-round, no-decision bout in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His claim to the title was not universally recognized at the time. Jack Sharkey, also known as Little Jackie Sharkey, should not be confused with the heavyweight champion Jack Sharkey.[1]


Early life and career

Jackie Sharkey was born Giovanni Cervati in Bologna, Emilia Romagna, Italy on June 20, 1897, though he would live most of his life in New York City. In his early professional career between May 23, 1914, and February 21, 1916, fighting almost exclusively in the New York area, he won three and lost six bouts, with one draw.[2]

On February 21, 1916, Sharkey lost to Jewish boxer Abe Friedman at the Olympia Boxing Club in New York in a ten-round newspaper decision.[3] Friedman would become a competent bantamweight fringe contender during his career taking the USA New England Bantamweight Title in 1921.

On June 2, 1916, Sharkey lost to Young Zulu Kid in a fifth-round knockout at the Vanderbilt Athletic Club in Brooklyn, New York.[4] By that year, Zulu Kid had established himself as a serious world flyweight contender.

Draw with Johnny Coulon, February 1917

On February 5, 1917, Sharkey drew with former World Bantamweight champion Johnny Coulon in a ten-round newspaper decision at the Pioneer Sporting Club in New York. Local newspapers disagreed on the decision. Coulon held the World Bantamweight Championship from 1911–13, though the title was not unified at the time.

On July 27, 1917, Sharkey first lost to Kid Williams in six rounds at Oriole Park in Baltimore, at least by the newspaper decision of the _Baltimore Sun_. He lost to Williams again on April 1, 1918 in a twelve-round points decision at the Lyric Theater in Baltimore. Williams held the World Bantamweight Title from June 1914 to January 1917.[5]

Bouts with December 1920 World Bantamweight Champion Joe Lynch 1916–25

Sharkey first met Joe Lynch on September 26, 1916 in the star bout at the Pioneer Sporting Club in New York, losing in ten-round newspaper decisions of the _New York Times_ and _New York Tribune_.[6] They met on February 27, 1917, and Sharkey lost again by a ten-round decision of three New York newspapers at the Pioneer Sports Club in New York City. Sharkey was down in the fifth round, after which Lynch had little trouble penetrating his defenses. The bout was an elimination series for the bantamweight championship, and Lynch had some difficulty with Sharkey in the early rounds.[7][8]

Sharky and Joe Lynch drew in a fifteen-round points decision at New York's Madison Square Garden on September 28, 1920, although Lynch was down in several rounds from the blows of Sharkey.[9] Sharkey's ability to stay fifteen rounds with a top bantamweight contender put him squarely in the list of top contenders himself. On December 2, 1920, in a somewhat more historic bout, Lynch defeated Sharkey in a fifteenth-round knockout at Madison Square Garden. Sharkey had the better of the bout up until the sixth round, when Lynch became far more dominant. Lynch's win gave him the right to challenge Pete Herman for the Bantamweight Championship three weeks later.[10] On July 2, 1925, at the Polo Grounds in New York, home of the New York Giants, the two drew in four rounds to a large house in which Lynch was somewhat favored to win.[11][12]

Seven bouts with top bantamweight contender Frankie Burns, 1916–18

Frankie_Burns.jpg Sharkey met Frankie Burns seven times during his career, but had little luck with the highly rated bantamweight contender. Beginning on November 27, 1916 Sharkey faced a ten-round loss by newspaper decision from Burns in New York, followed by a ten-round loss on February 9, 1917 at the Harlem Sports Club in New York by newspaper decision of the _New York Sun_. Sharkey sank to the mat in the sixth round and claimed a foul, though he recovered by the seventh. He fought the first two rounds "like a whirlwind" and looked to have an advantage, but lost his pace in subsequent rounds.[13] In the third, Sharkey was stunned by a left hook to his midriff that may have affected him for the remainder of the bout.[14]

On October 15, 1917, he lost to Burns in a newspaper decision ten rounder in Albany, New York. Burns was "too clever" for Sharkey and "won by use of constant left jabs and right handers to the body".[15] Sharkey fell to a ten-round loss by newspaper decision in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on February 21, 1918. In their February 21 Jersey City Town Hall bout, Burns was described as easily outpointing his opponent, and taking seven of the ten rounds, with only one to Sharkey before a substantial house of 4000.[16][17] On June 20, 1918, he drew with Burns in a six-round newspaper decision in Madison Square Garden, and he lost to Burns again at the Garden in their last bout on November 16 in a six-round newspaper decision of the _New York Times_. Burns was eight years older than Sharkey, but seemed a difficult opponent to defeat. On July 13, 1920, Sharkey lost to Burns in a twelve-round newspaper decision of the _Philadelphia Record_ at the Outdoor Arena of the Armory in Jersey City, New Jersey.[18] As a highly rated Bantamweight, Burns contended four times for the World Bantamweight Championship between 1912 and 1917.

On April 6, 1918, Sharkey defeated Joe Tuber at the National Athletic Club in Philadelphia in a six-round newspaper decision of the _Philadelphia Inquirer_. The bout was described as sensational and Sharkey was considered to have been in his best form with a clear advantage.[19]

On March 24, 1919, Sharkey lost to Jackie "Kid" Wolfe in a ten-round newspaper decision of the _Bridgeport Standard Telegram_ at the Grand Theater in Cleveland, Ohio.[20]

On May 3, 1920, Sharkey lost to Jewish boxer Young Montreal, aka Morris Billingkoff, in a twelve-round points decision at Infantry Hall in Providence, Rhode Island.[21] Young Montreal was a skilled opponent who was a contender for the World Bantamweight Championship for a ten-year period.[22]


Bouts with Champion Pete Herman and claiming World Bantamweight Championship

Pete.Herman.jpeg Sharkey first defeated Pete Herman in a six-round newspaper decision of two local newspapers at the National Athletic Club in Philadelphia on May 4, 1918. The victory over the reigning bantamweight champion was described as "a clean cut lacing", and several newspapers agreed Sharkey had the advantage in the bout. Due to a smaller house than expected, Sharkey was poorly compensated for his victory. Sharkey was described as the aggressor through most of the bout and able to stand punch for punch with the champion.[23][24] On September 2, 1918, Sharkey again fared well against World Bantamweight Champion Pete Herman in a non-title six-round match at the Olympia Club in Philadelphia, though the bout was a no-decision, and more newspapers gave the advantage to Herman. Sharkey was described as the aggressor and always forcing the pace, though more newspapers felt Herman deserved the decision having better timed and more effective punches.[25][26] The bout was close and Sharkey made Herman extend himself.[27]

Claiming the World Bantamweight Championship, August 15, 1919

Sharkey briefly claimed the World Bantamweight Championship on August 15, 1919 in a ten-round newspaper decision against Pete Herman in a no-decision bout in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, though the title was not unified at the time, and Sharkey won the bout by a fairly close margin. Sharkey's claim was not recognized at the time, as he would have had to win by knockout or technical knockout to take the title, or to have won by the decision of a referee. The majority of newspaper reports gave Sharkey the edge in the bout.[28][29] On September 15, 1919, Sharkey had the edge over Herman in a World Bantamweight Championship match in Detroit, Michigan in a ten-round newspaper decision by the _Detroit Free Press_, though the bout was fairly close. According to one source, Sharkey was the aggressor, though Herman landed the more telling blows.[30] On September 11, 1920, Sharkey again defeated Herman in a non-title, fifteen-round newspaper decision of the _Chicago Tribune_ in East Chicago, Indiana, though Herman held the World Bantamweight Championship at the time. Sharkey claimed fouls in the fifth and seventh rounds which were not allowed by the referee. Sharkey was the aggressor throughout which earned him the advantage according to several newspapers.[31] Sharkey's claim to the title was stripped on September 11, 1920.[32]

Win over British champion Jimmy Wilde, December 1919

On December 6, 1919, Sharkey impressively defeated British champion Jimmy Wilde in a ten-round newspaper decision of the _Milwaukee Journal_ before a crowd close to 8,000 at the Auditorium in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[33] Sharkey was considered a decisive winner, taking eight of the ten rounds according to the newspapermen at ringside. Wilde had been away from the ring for months, and was outweighed by Sharkey by seven pounds. Sharkey's blows were said to land more frequently and with greater force. Sharkey's win was at least a minor upset as Wilde led in the early betting 2 to 1.[34][35] Sharkey would make $2,0000 on the bout and gain notoriety that would help him command more for his future bouts.[36] An exceptional opponent, Wilde would take the British and European Flyweight Championships in that year, and the World Flyweight Championship by 1920.

Win over French and European Bantamweight Champion Charles Ledoux, October 1920

On October 15, 1920, Sharkey defeated French boxer Charles Ledoux in a fifteen-round points decision at Madison Square Garden. In his career, LeDoux would take both the European and French bantamweight championships. Sharkey appeared to have a clear advantage in the first three rounds, and Ledoux was very briefly down in the second.[37][38]

Attempt to take World Bantamweight Championship against Johnny Buff, November 1921

On November 10, 1921 Sharkey lost to Johnny Buff in a fifteen-round World Bantamweight Championship by points decision at Madison Square Garden. In the close and exciting bout, Sharkey had five rounds, six went to Buff, and four were even. Both boxers took the lead at times, but Buff finished stronger. The _Des Moines Register_ called the bout "as rousing a battle as ever you'd wish to see." Most newspapers gave the bout to Buff, who held World Bantamweight title at the time. The _New York Times_ gave Sharkey the seventh, eighth and ninth rounds, while Buff took eleven of the remaining rounds, with one even. The final rounds seemed to clearly belong to Buff.[39][40] Sharkey had lost earlier to Buff on January 15, 1920 in an eight-round newspaper decision of the _Jersey Journal_ in Jersey City, New Jersey.[41]

Close loss to Johnny Dundee for Jr. Lightweight Championship, July 1922

Johnny_Dundee.jpg On July 6, 1922, Sharkey lost to Johnny Dundee in a fifteen-round points decision of a Jr. Lightweight Championship bout at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn with an impressive attendance of 10,0000. Sharkey was down briefly in the fourth, and again in the fifteenth in what several boxing critics considered only a modest showing for Dundee. The _New York Evening World_ wrote that Dundee was "losing his fighting fire", by allowing the bout to go fifteen rounds. The _Evening World_ considered Dundee to have taken every round, though Sharkey made a strong showing in the early part of the fourth. The _Evening World_ described the fighting as somewhat refrained though there was a stronger showing in the fourth and fourteenth rounds. Though Sharkey came out strong in the fourteenth with a blow to Dundee's jaw, Dundee answered and the close exchange was short lived, with both boxers fighting with more reserve through the fifteenth.[42] The bout was quite exciting and Sharkey was said to excel at infighting having a reach advantage over Dundee. In the early betting, at least among New York newspapers like the _New York Tribune_, Dundee seemed a clear favorite.[43] The bout was close according to some newspapers and pushed Dundee to his limits, though he won "by a shade". Sharkey never again competed in a World Championship bout.[44][45]

Fighting at 127 pounds, in the Jr. Lightweight range, on June 19, 1923, Sharkey lost to Pete Zivic at Queensboro Stadium in Queens, New York in a twelve-round points decision. Zivic was a competent junior lightweight, but Sharkey's record included many losses after his loss to Johnny Dundee on July 6, 1922. Sharkey had nearly a six-pound weight advantage over Zivic though he lacked a few inches in reach.[46]

Loss of boxing license against Frankie Fasano, December 2, 1924

On December 2, 1924, Sharkey lost on a second round disqualification against Frankie Fasano when he reportedly and uncharacteristically attacked the referee. He had claimed to be a victim of a foul which the referee disallowed. According to the _New York Times_, the event greatly disquieted the audience. After striking referee Eddie Purdy in the jaw, his boxing license was revoked the following day and he did not box for the remainder of the year. He boxed in New York four months later in April 1925.[47][48] On May 14, 1925, he lost again to Fasano in a ten-round points decision at Manhattan Casino in New York after being reinstated. He lost his momentum by the second round.[49]


Retirement from boxing, 1926

Sharkey retired from boxing around May 1926, with a ten-round points decision loss to Young Mulligan in Norwalk, Connecticut. He had lost two prior bouts by newspaper decision since September 1925, as well as a third-round TKO to Jewish boxer Red Chapman on October 23, 1925. In September 1927, the talented Chapman would lose to Benny Bass in a close bout for the NBA World Featherweight Championship in Philadelphia.[50]

Sharkey was twenty-eight years old when he retired from the ring. He died on March 1, 1970 at the age of 72.[51]
