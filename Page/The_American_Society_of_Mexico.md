THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF MEXICO (AMSOC) is a community organization and non-profit for the greater American Community living in Mexico that has historically supported inclusion and empowerment for all people.[1][2][3][4][5] The society was established on August 26, 1942 as the American population in Mexico started to increase.[6] Over the years, the society has organized hundreds of events centered around American and Mexican traditions as well as formed dozens of partnerships to benefit the American Community in Mexico.[7][8][9][10][11][12][13]

History

The American Society of Mexico was one of the first players in uniting the American Community within Mexico, helping Americans integrate within Mexico and sharing many distinctly American traditions between the American Community in Mexico and Mexicans.[14]

"Amistad: Magazine of American Society of Mexico"

From the mid- through the late- 1900s, The American Society of Mexico published a regular bulletin for its members and those associated with the society.[15] The bulletin served to announce get-togethers, events, initiatives and, perhaps most importantly, updates on U.S. and U.S.-Mexico news before the days of online media.[16] Due to technological advances, the society has shifted to distribute information online.

Political Affiliation

The American Society of Mexico is currently run by society president Larry Rubin, who although is the primary representative of the US Republican Party in Mexico demonstrates a conduct of empowering bipartisanship in the society by frequently working alongside and welcoming left-wing organizations.[17][18][19][20] Additionally, Rubin]] went on air to publicly withdraw support from (at the time) presidential candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election.[21][22]

The 2016 U.S. Presidential Race

The American Society of Mexico played perhaps the most significant role in Mexico organizing around the 2016 U.S. Presidential Race.[23][24][25][26] Prior to Election Day, the society was frequently featured in and consulted by the Mexican press for opinions from the society and its president, Larry Rubin, an opinion leader in Mexico.[27] In addition to organizing the largest U.S. Election Party in the nation, AMSOC served as a media liaison between the American Community living in Mexico, the United States and the Mexican press bridging the three entities during a particularly contentious U.S. Election from the Mexican perspective.[28][29]
