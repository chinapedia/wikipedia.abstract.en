The PRAYER BOOK SOCIETY is a charity in England that "is established for the advancement of the Christian religion as set forth in the Book of Common Prayer; and, in furtherance of this Object, for the promotion of the worship and doctrine enshrined in the Book of Common Prayer and its use for services, teaching and training throughout the Church of England and other Churches in the Anglican tradition".[1]


Activity

The Prayer Book Society was founded in 1972, as a conservative reaction to the Church's experiments with liturgical reform in the Alternative Services Series 1, and Series 2, and just prior to the publication of Series 3.

In 2012 the Charity Commission for England and Wales permitted the society to simplify its objects in order to allow it to undertake a number of new activities closely related to its previous work.[2]

The society considers itself to be a sister society of the Prayer Book Society of the USA, the Prayer Book Society of Canada, the Scottish Prayer Book Society and the Prayer Book Society in Australia. The society's patron is Charles, Prince of Wales and the ecclesiastical patron is Richard Chartres, the former Bishop of London.

According to the Society it has over 4,500 members, and 51 branches throughout England.
