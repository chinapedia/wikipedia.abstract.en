Ivar Anderson is among its former editors-in-chief who assumed the post in 1940.[2]

The paper is published in Stockholm and provides coverage of national and international news as well as local coverage of the Greater Stockholm region. Its subscribers are concentrated in the capital, but it is distributed in most of Sweden. During the beginning of the 1900s the paper was one of the right-wing publications in Stockholm.[3]

_Svenska Dagbladet_ is owned by Schibsted[4] which purchased it in the late 1990s.[5] The stated position of the editorial page is "independently moderate" (_oberoende moderat_), which means it is independent but adheres to the liberal conservatism of the Moderate Party. On the other hand, the paper is also regarded as conservative.[6][7]

In November 2000 _Svenska Dagbladet_ changed its format from broadsheet to tabloid.[8][9] In 2005 the paper started a Web portal for business news as a joint venture with _Aftonbladet_.[10]

Since 1925 _Svenska Dagbladet_ has awarded an individual sportsperson or a team the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal at the end of each year.
