The_New_Cambridge_History_of_Islam_Vol._I.jpg _THE NEW CAMBRIDGE HISTORY OF ISLAM_ is a six volume history of Islam published by Cambridge University Press in 2010.[1] The general editor is Michael Cook.

The history replaced the original _Cambridge History of Islam_ which was published in 1970.[2] As well as being greatly expanded from the earlier history, which was of two volumes, the new history introduces more thematic sections and covers wider ground by, for instance, a detailed examination of Sufism. It also cautiously questions the narrative of the history of Islam believed by Muslims which it finds lacks reliable textual evidence for the earliest period.[3]
