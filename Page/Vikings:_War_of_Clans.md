VIKINGS: WAR OF CLANS is an MMO strategy game developed and published by Plarium. The game is free-to-play though certain features are available for players to buy.

The game was launched on Google Play and the iOS App Store on August 10, 2015[1] and on Amazon Appstore on December 10, 2015.[2] On October 19, 2016, the desktop version of the game was released on Facebook, and on January 15, 2017, the browser version of the game appeared on the company’s official portal.


Gameplay

In Vikings: War of Clans, players have to cooperate with each other to create their own clan. Each clan has the ruling hierarchy from a ranker to the chief, and each player has their correspondent authority extent.[3]

The main game goal is to capture the place of power – a unique location placed at the center of every kingdom. Players create and develop their own clans, train troops and upgrade their heroes and their towns. Each in-game upgrade requires special resources – lumber, iron, food, stone, silver or the in-game currency "gold". Resources can be obtained via upgrading resource buildings in the town, undertaking marches to resource locations on the global map and attacking towns of other players.[4]

New competition have been implemented into the game, which allow you to fight and become the king of the entire land. Players have to travel to the kingdom Jotunheim to compete in the legendary competition.

Players can team up into groups which can contain up to 100-125 persons (depending on the strength of the clan and their stronghold) united by a single clan name, shield, regulations and management structure. Players create clans to achieve collective goals such as capturing the Place of Power, taking part in clan competitions and helping clan members to develop.[5]

Players in the game are geographically separated into different game locations – the kingdoms. On average, in each kingdom there can be around 45,000 players. By the end of 2018, there were more than 750 kingdoms.

In creating the game, the development team used information from articles and books about the Scandinavian Peninsula's history, and from television shows and movies depicting war marches and the day-to-day life of the Vikings, as well as other sources containing info on early medieval Scandinavia.[6]


Cultural references and critical reception

On May 23, 2016, French politician Frédéric Lefebvre, appearing on _Le Talk_ show on Le Figaro television channel, comparing the situation faced by French people to the challenges in _Vikings: War of Clans_: “Look, it is a system locked in itself. The situation in France reminds me of games popular among youth, World of Warcraft and Vikings: War of Clans, where you have to develop your town for hours to start a war eventually. However, all this time you only notice what’s going on around you and you cannot see any further”.[7]

Paul Glader, associate professor of journalism at Berlin School of Creative Leadership, wrote about his experience of a Summer spent ruling a clan in _Vikings: War of Clans_, summarising "I enjoyed my Summer as a Viking chief. I learned that many of the principles of good leadership in real life apply in these virtual realms. Good leadership in either realm takes time, thought and engagement. It also takes a team. And, sometimes, when you find yourself less engaged as a leader, it's time to make a succession plan or a new leadership plan. Because that’s when your Viking clan might face its greatest test."[8]
