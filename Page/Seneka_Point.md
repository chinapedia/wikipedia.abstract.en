SENEKA POINT (Russian: _Mys Seneka_) is a steep-to point in the western Sea of Okhotsk. It has sheer cliffs that are 152 m (500 ft) high and grayish-brown in color. It forms the eastern point of the entrance to Tugur Bay, the southeastern point of Lindholm Strait, and the western point of the entrance of Academy Bay; to its north lies Belichy Island. Numerous tide rips and eddies form near the point.[1]


History

American whaleships cruised for bowhead whales off the point between 1855 and 1874. They called it SHANTAR HEAD or WALRUS POINT.[2]
