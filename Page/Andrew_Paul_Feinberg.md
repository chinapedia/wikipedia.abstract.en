ANDREW PAUL FEINBERG is the director of the Center for Epigenetics, chief of the Division of Molecular Medicine in the Department of Medicine, and the King Fahd Professor of Medicine, Oncology, Molecular Biology & Genetics in the School of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University.[1]

Andrew Feinberg received his B.A. in 1973 and M.D. in 1976 from the accelerated medical program at Johns Hopkins University, as well as an M.P.H. from Johns Hopkins in 1981. He did his residency in internal medicine, followed by a fellowship in genetics at Hopkins. He did a postdoctoral fellowship in developmental biology at UCSD where he researched the multiple differentiation paths of _Dictyostelium discoideum_. His research into hereditary inheritance of traits outside of DNA was initially seen as controversial, and he was told that if he continued this work, his funding would be cut off.[2]

Dr. Feinberg discovered epigenetic alterations in human cancer with Bert Vogelstein in 1983. He is also credited with the discovery of gene imprinting in humans.[3] He has made many contributions to the field of epigenetics in cancer, and discovered the molecular basis of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.[4] He pursued this work while he was an HHMI Investigator at the University of Michigan from 1986-1994,[5] when he returned to Johns Hopkins as King Fahd Professor of Molecular Medicine in the Department of Medicine.
