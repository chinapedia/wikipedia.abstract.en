_ATTACK OF THE MAYAN MUMMY_ is the Americanized, English-dubbed version of a 1957[1][2] Mexican horror film called _La Momia Azteca_, aka _La Momia_. It was made by Jerry Warren, who removed a huge portion of the original Mexican film, replacing it with newly filmed footage featuring American actors.[3][4] This solved the problem of redubbing the original Spanish dialogue into English.[5] Warren released his film in 1963.[6][7][8][9] He later re-released the film in 1965 on a double bill with his _Creature of the Walking Dead_.[10]


Plot

A Mayan temple maiden named Xochitl is reincarnated centuries later as a woman named Ann Taylor. A scientist uses hypnosis to cause her to regress to her earlier life many centuries ago when she was executed by the high priests for having an affair with a Mayan warrior named Popoca. As punishment, Popoca was turned into a living mummy and placed in a pyramid tomb where he must guard Xochitl's remains and a Mayan treasure for all eternity. Ann Taylor leads an expedition of archaeologists to the hidden tomb where a valuable gold breastplate is guarded by the still living Popoca. Taking the treasure from its resting place automatically revives the mummy. In this Americanized version, the mummy kills one of the explorers, and is in turn captured by the scientists and taken back to civilization. The mummy later escapes, gets back his stolen breastplate and returns to his tomb. In the end, the scientists return to the pyramid and battle the mummy, holding him at bay with a crucifix. The leader of the expedition sacrifices his life to destroy the mummy with dynamite, collapsing the tomb on both of them.

Reception

Cavett Binion of AllMovie referred to the film as a "tedious effort" that was "padded out with deadly-dull exposition".[18]

Mike Haberfelner of SearchMyTrash.com wrote: ".....nothing really happens in the newly shot footage, it just shows characters commenting on what has just happened in the Mexican footage or contemplating what will happen - and it all seems to serve primarily one purpose: To avoid having to dub and lip-synch too much dialogue of the original footage. The result is so bad in fact that the film has come to be known as a trash masterpiece."[19]
