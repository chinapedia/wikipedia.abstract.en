Historic Torah

History

Origins

Temple Emanuel was formally incorporated on December 2, 1952.[59] At the time, it was the only reform Jewish congregation in Montgomery County, Maryland.[60] Rabbi Leon M. Adler served as its first spiritual leader.[61] In January 1955, the congregation agreed to purchase of land along Connecticut Avenue in Kensington to build a sanctuary, religious school, and social hall.[62] Oscar Felker chaired the fundraising campaign for purchasing the land and constructing the synagogue.[63] Construction plans were finalized in October 1956.[64] Construction was completed in 1958,[65] and the synagogue was formally dedicated on May 2, 1958.[66]

Religious school schism

Temple Emanuel's religious school was founded as a program of the synagogue in 1973.[67] In order to be eligible for funding from the United Jewish Appeal, the religious school was separately incorporated, with its own board of directors, in 1976.[68] Around that time, the religious school's board of directors considered whether to move the religious school to a more spacious location outside the synagogue.[69]

Honorary Dean Rabbi Herzel Kranz wanted the religious school to continue to be connected to the synagogue, and he called a meeting of the synagogue's board of directors to replace the religious school's board of directors.[70] The religious school's board of directors said Rabbi Kranz had no authority to call for such a meeting.[71]

The religious school's board of directors a group of parents withdrew their children from the religious school, and they organized their own religious school.[72] The newly formed religious school enrolled approximately half the students and hired half the teachers of the old religious school.[73] It also hired the principal of the old religious school, Rabbi Jeffrey Rubenstein.[74]

The new religious school's board of directors moved the religious school's $21,000 bank balance to a new bank account in order to try to prevent Rabbi Kranz from accessing the funds.[75] Rabbi Kranz still attempted to withdraw $16,000 from the new bank account without authorization and without success.[76] Tuition for the new religious school was also deposited into the synagogue's bank account, which the parents contested.[77] The synagogue's board of directors decided to increase the new religious school's rent from $15,000 to $28,000, threatening eviction if not paid in full.[78]

Rabbi Kranz instructed the synagogue to fire Rabbi Rubenstein, and he changed the locks of the religious school.[79]

The new religious school's board of directors said that Rabbi Kranz had no authority to fire Rabbi Rubenstein, and Rabbi Rubenstein appeared at work the next day.[80] Rabbi Kranz locked Rabbi Rubenstein in his office, called the police, and told the police there was a trespasser in the building.[81] Rabbi Rubenstein also the police from inside the office, telling them he was being held captive.[82] When police officers arrived at the building, Rabbi Kranz freed Rabbi Rubenstein.[83]

Montgomery County Circuit Court prohibited Rabbi Kranz from interfering with the new religious school.[84] The court decided to allow a Bet Din to arbitrate.[85] The Bet Din decided that the new religious school could continue to operate separately from the synagogue and without interference from Rabbi Kranz.[86]

New rabbi

On February 27, 1988, Rabbi Adler died of an aneurysm.[87] Rabbi Warren G. Stone was installed as Temple Emanuel's spiritual leader on November 15, 1988.[88] Originally from Massachusetts, Rabbi Stone had served as rabbi of Temple Beth El in Corpus Christi, Texas, for six years.[89]
