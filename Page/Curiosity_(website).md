CURIOSITY is an online education website. The site aggregates content from various online educational and instructional resources (such as courses, articles, and videos), which can be filtered by subjects and topics, course cost, and other factors.

Curiosity originally founded by Gabe Vehovsky, Discovery Communications chief of digital strategy and digital businesses. He saw Curiosity as a "vertically centric marketplace" for online learning.[1]

In November 2014, Curiosity was spun out of Discovery with Vehovsky as CEO; Discovery remains a content partner for the service. At the same time, the company raised $6 million in a Series A funding round from a number of Chicago-based investors, including Pritzker Group Venture Capital, Origin Ventures, Chicago Ventures, and Corazon Capital.[2][3][4][5]
