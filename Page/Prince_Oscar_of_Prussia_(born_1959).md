PRINCE OSCAR OF PRUSSIA (German: _Oskar Prinz von Preussen_; born 6 May 1959) is a member of the House of Hohenzollern, the former ruling house of Prussia, and a pretender in line to the German throne. He is the thirty-seventh _Herrenmeister_ ("Master of the Knights" or Grand Master) of the Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg).


Life

He is the second son of Prince Wilhelm-Karl of Prussia and wife Armgard von Veltheim, and the great-grandson of Wilhelm II, the last German Emperor and King of Prussia. He married Auguste Zimmermann von Siefart (born 1962) and they had three children : Oskar Prinz von Preussen (born 1993), Wilhelmine Prinzessin von Preussen (born 1995) and Albert Prinz von Preussen (born 1998).

Since 1999 he serves as the _Herrenmeister_ (Grand Master) of the Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg), following his father Prince Wilhelm-Karl of Prussia and his grandfather Prince Oskar of Prussia, and he is a distant cousin of each of the respective sovereign heads of the Orders of St John of the British and Commonwealth realms (Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester), of the Netherlands (until his death in 2004 Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, since vacant) and of the Order of St John in Sweden (King Carl XVI Gustav), which constitute the Alliance of the Orders of Saint John of Jerusalem.
