The ST. ANNE'S CHURCH[1] () It is a Catholic church located in Yekaterinburg,[2] in the Diocese of Novosibirsk in Russia,[3] suffragan of the Archdiocese of the Mother of God in Moscow.

History

The parish was founded in 1876 and included more than a thousand faithful. In 1884, it was built the first stone church, entrusted to the patronage of St. Anne, mother of the Virgin Mary. His parish priest was shot after the October Revolution and the church was secularized. It was destroyed about 1960.

The parish was restored in the 1990s after the dissolution of the USSR and a new church was built and consecrated in 2000 by Bishop Joseph Werth.
