Satellite services

Most products and services provided by the consortium are in the field of satellite-based communications, including voice, Internet and Machine-to-Machine (M2M), with emphasis on L band mobile satellite service (MSS) through the Iridium and Inmarsat satellite constellations.[22] Fixed-satellite service (FSS) / VSAT and system integration are also provided in some markets, as well as Inmarsat's Ka band mobile service known as Global Xpress (GX).[23] One of the group's largest projects currently involves a utility company in Brazil that uses mixed L band and terrestrial cellular for redundant high availability mobile push-to-talk communications.


Recent activities

In March 2018, Globalsat Group was awarded for the work of its Brazilian affiliate Globalsat do Brasil on an innovative solution which uses L-band MSS to provide dependable communications to a railway system.[24]

During 2017 Inmarsat highlighted the railway project in Brasil as one of its important success stories.[25]

In March 2016, Globalsat Group was named "Company to Watch" in the category Emergency Response Mobility Satcom Innovation by the Mobile Satellite Users Association (MSUA) at the Satellite 2016 conference,[26] for its role as a provider of satellite services for the tsunami detection and warning system operated by Chile's government, through the local subsidiary Globalsat Chile.[27]

On May 2016 the group received the "2016 Latin America Satellite Communications Company of the Year" award from the highly recognized international consulting firm Frost & Sullivan.[28]

On November 2016 LeoSat and Globalsat Group sign a strategic worldwide agreement. LeoSat Enterprises is planning to launch a constellation of as many as 108 LEO communications satellites. Under the agreement Globalsat Group will provide market access and LeoSat will provide infrastructure for service. J. Alberto Palacios, CEO of Globalsat, will hold a seat in representation of the group on the LeoSat Customer Technical Advisory Committee (CTAC). The committee will advise on system configuration, product design and launch of LeoSat's upcoming satellite constellation.[29]

On December 2016 Globalsat Group obtained a license for all Inmarsat services through its Mexican affiliate MultiSAT. This includes official authorization and landing rights for foreign satellite signals in the Ka and L bands.[30]

In March 2017 Globalsat Group has been appointed as an Tier 1 Enterprise Distribution Partner to Inmarsat Global, the global mobile satellite operator. This improved situation will enable Globalsat Group to have access of Inmarsat upcoming products, direct hotlines to operations personnel for faster customer support and a higher level of solutions customization.[31]

In March 2017 Globalsat Group and Sky and Space Global signed a MoU towards testing and offering satellite service in Latin America. Under the agreement, the group will take part in early trials of the Sky and Space Global satellite system. The non-binding deal also involves working towards establishing a commercial agreement for providing services to end-users across Globalsat Groups' multi country footprint.[32]

Recently, Globalsat Group has bought major shares in Peruvian connectivity provider ST2.[33] Sky and Space Global has joined hands with Globalsat Group for the launch of nano-satellites to revolutionize the telecommunication.[34]
