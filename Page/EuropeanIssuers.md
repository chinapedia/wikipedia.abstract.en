EUROPEANISSUERS is an association representing the interests of publicly quoted companies on European stock exchanges.[1][2] Since 2008, its objective has been to ensure that European Union policy creates an environment in which companies can raise capital through the public markets and deliver growth over the longer term.[3]


Overview

The lobby association is registered in the European Transparency Register with the European Commission and Parliament.[4] EuropeanIssuers' direct members include listed companies and national associations of listed companies from 14 European countries which represents approximately 8,000 companies.[5]

EuropeanIssuers has co-organised the European Small and Mid-Cap Awards along with the European Commission and the Federation of European Securities Exchanges since 2013.[6][7][8]


History

Founded in 2008 as the result of a merger between two associations of listed companies, EuropeanIssuers was created as a not-for-profit association when EALIC, the European Association of Listed Companies, joined with UNIQUE, the Union of Issuers Quoted in Europe.[9]

Leadership

EuropeanIssuers is led by a Board of Directors. Luc Vansteekiste has served as chairman since 2014.[10][11]

The association is administrated by a secretary general. Florence Bindelle has held this position since 2015.[12][13] Past secretary generals include Dorien Fransens (2008–2010) and Susannah Haan (2010-2015).[14]


Activities

EuropeanIssuers organises the European Small and Mid-Cap Awards with FESE and the European Commission's Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs in order to encourage the growth of smaller companies' stock listing, particularly SMEs and growth companies.[15] It has organised the awards ceremony and dinner since 2013 when the European Commission launched the project.[16]

The organisation is also on the events planning committee for the first inaugural Invest Week 2016, a series of events focused on the European investment and growth agenda.[17][18]


Membership

Companies listed on European stock exchanges as well as national associations of listed companies form the direct membership base of EuropeanIssuers.[19]
