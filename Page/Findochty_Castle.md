FINDOCHTY CASTLE is a ruined 16th century L-plan tower house, near Findochty, Moray, Scotland, about north east of Buckie, and about from the sea to the north.[1]

The castle stands on a rock at the end of a drained loch.[2]


History

Findochty_castle.jpg The castle was built by the Gordons, but was acquired by the Ogilvies, and, in 1568, by the Ord family, who subsequently developed Findochty village as a fishing port.[3]

The castle was a ruin in 1794.[4] Some repairs were done to the castle remains in the 1880s.[5]


Structure

It appears that the castle comprised an oblong block, broad (but of unknown length), and a small oblong tower, about by to the west, attach to the north front.[6]

The main building has been destroyed, apart from part of the north wall, and of the west wing. The tower and west wing, once the kitchen, remain up to about .[7]

There was a vaulted basement, while the hall was on the first floor.[8]

The castle is constructed of harl-pointed rubble, with roughly tooled dressings. There is a narrow door in the south front, with a relieving arch.[9]

The castle is a scheduled monument.[10]
