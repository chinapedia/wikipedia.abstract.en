The 1985 TENNENTS' SIXES was the second staging of the indoor 6-a-side football tournament at Ingliston Showground near Edinburgh on 20 and 21 January. It was again televised on BBC Scotland.

The format had changed from 3 groups of 3 teams to 2 groups of 10 with all from the 1984-85 Scottish Premier Division season except Celtic. First Division club Airdrieonians replaced them.

The two group winners and runners-up qualified to the semi-finals and Hearts beat Morton 4-1 in the final.
