WILLIAM JAMES CHRYSTAL (20 May 1854 – 21 April 1921) was a Scottish chemist and partner in his family’s chemicals business J & J White Chemicals based in Rutherglen.


Ancestors

Chrystal was born in Glasgow, son of insurance broker Robert Chrystal and grandson of Dr. William Chrystal (1776–1830), rector of Glasgow Grammar School who died in a boating accident and is remembered with a bust in Glasgow Cathedral.[1] His mother Jean was the daughter of the founder of _J & J White Chemicals_, John White, and her brothers John and James were also partners from 1840 and 1851 respectively until their deaths in the 1880s.


Education and career

He was a fellow of the Royal Institute of Chemistry and the Chemical Society.[2] After working in a laboratory in the 1870s he joined _J & J White Chemicals_ as an expert chemist, and after his uncle John died in 1881 he became the technical partner in the business. By this time Chrystal’s cousin John Campbell White, the son of his other uncle James, was also a partner. After the death of James White in 1884 another cousin, Hill Hamilton Barrett, became the commercial partner. At this time the Shawfield works, mainly producing bichromate of potash, were the largest of their kind in the world and employed over 500 men. Chrystal was credited with improving the manufacturing processes for the products.
