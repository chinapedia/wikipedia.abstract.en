The PAVANE, pavan, paven, pavin, pavian, pavine, or pavyn (It. _pavana_, _padovana_; Ger. _Paduana_) is a slow processional dance common in Europe during the 16th century (Renaissance).

The pavane, the earliest-known music for which was published in Venice by Ottaviano Petrucci, in Joan Ambrosio Dalza's _Intabolatura de lauto libro quarto_ in 1508, is a sedate and dignified couple dance, similar to the 15th-century basse danse. The music which accompanied it appears originally to have been fast or moderately fast but, like many other dances, became slower over time .


Origin of term

The word "Pavane" is most probably derived from Italian "[danza] Padovana" , , meaning "[dance] typical of Padua" (similar to Bergamask, "dance from Bergamo"); "pavan" is a dialectal/old form for the modern Italian adjective "padovano" (= from Padua).[1] This origin is consistent with the equivalent form, "Paduana".

An alternative explanation is that it derives from the Spanish _pavón_ meaning _peacock_ .

Although the dance is often associated with Spain , it was "almost certainly of Italian origin" .


History

The decorous sweep of the pavane suited the new more sober Spanish-influenced courtly manners of 16th century Italy. It appears in dance manuals in England, France, and Italy.

The pavane's popularity was from roughly 1530 to 1676 , though, as a dance, it was already dying out by the late 16th century . As a musical form, the pavan survived long after the dance itself was abandoned, and well into the Baroque period, when it finally gave way to the allemande/courante sequence .


Music

-   Slow duple metre ( or ) by the late 16th century, though there is evidence that it was still a fast dance as late as the mid-16th century, and there are also examples of triple-time pavans from Spain, Italy, and England .
-   Two strains of eight, twelve, or sixteen bars each.
-   Accent generally comes on the third beat with a secondary accent on the 1st beat though some Pavans place the accent on the first beat with the secondary accent falling on the third.
-   Generally follows the form of A–A′–B–B′–C–C′.
-   It generally uses counterpoint or homophonic accompaniment.
-   Often accompanied by a tabor according to in a rhythmic pattern of minim–crotchet–crotchet (––) or similar.
-   This dance was generally paired with the Galliard.
-   often accompanied by a song with oboe and drums.
-   Usually no florid or running passages in instrumental ensemble settings, but pavans for solo instruments usually included written-out repeat sections with variations .


Dance

In Thoinot Arbeau's French dance manual, it is generally a dance for many couples in procession, with the dancers sometimes throwing in ornamentation (divisions) of the steps .

The _Dictionnaire de Trevoux_ describes the dance as being a "grave kind of dance, borrowed from the Spaniards, wherein the performers make a kind of wheel or tail before each other, like that of a peacock, whence the name." It was usually used by regents to open grand ceremonies and to display their royal attire . Before dancing, the performers saluted the King and Queen whilst circling the room. The steps were called _advancing_ and _retreating_. Retreating gentlemen would lead their ladies by the hand and, after curtsies and steps, the gentlemen would regain their places. Next, a lone gentleman advanced and went _en se pavanant_ (strutting like a peacock) to salute the lady opposite him. After taking backward steps, he would return to his place, bowing to his lady .


Modern use

The step used in the pavane survives to the modern day in the _hesitation step_ sometimes used in weddings.
