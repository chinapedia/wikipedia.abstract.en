WILLIAM ARNOLD EGGER (24 February 1900 â€“ 2 March 1989) was a Surinamese resistance fighter in the Netherlands during the Second World War.

Born in Paramaribo, Egger was the grandson of a slave. He moved to the Netherlands to pursue his education, where he married Engelina Jas, a Dutch Jewish woman. During the Second World War, the Eggers hid 12 Jewish people in the cellar of the home, but the couple was betrayed to the Nazis. Egger and his wife were sent to concentration camps and survived their incarceration, but the Jews they sheltered did not. In 2014, Egger was posthumously by Israel's Yad Vashem with the honor of Righteous among the Nations.[1]
