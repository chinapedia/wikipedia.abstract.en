SCOTT & CHARLENE'S WEDDING are an Australian indie rock band, formed in Melbourne in 2006. The band currently consists of singer-songwriter Craig Dermody, bassist Jack Farley and drummer Joe Alexander. Dermody has always seen the band as being a solo project, and that by 2013 there had been "30 or 40 people in total" in the band.[1]

The band's name is taken from the 1987 wedding between Scott Robinson and Charlene Mitchell (played by Jason Donovan & Kylie Minogue, respectively) on the soap opera _Neighbours_. Dermody stated that "I remember sitting down and watching it with my mum. I just watched it as a kid and then stopped watching it. I remember the wedding being massive, it was as if it was a real wedding. Like a royal wedding, but in Australia.".[2] When asked if he actually liked the programme, Dermody responded "No, I hate Neighbours. It was just for a bogan reference. I used to watch it with my mum when i was young so it reminds me of Adelaide".[3]


History

The band were formed in 2006 in Melbourne by Craig Dermody, who had been a member of various bands including Lindsey Low Hand, Spider Vomit and Divorced with whom he had released albums on various independent Australian labels.[4] Dermody self-released the band's debut album in 2010 ''Para Vista Social Club '' on vinyl only, via his own label Untapped Resources. It was recorded with guitarist Luke Horton, bassist Jarrod Quarrel and drummer Dion Nania who usually played guitar with Melbourne band Panel of Judges.[5] The album was released as a limited edition of 200 copies in second-hand album covers which he painted over by hand.[6] The song _Epping Line_ "is about hearing news of my mother passing away. Those big moments are important as song subjects and the songs are important to help me get through those big moments".[7]

In 2010, Dermody relocated from Melbourne to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, revealing that he "was just after a bit of a life change. I'd just done what I was doing, and it was just time for me to go there, I guess â€“ I'd always wanted to".[8] The following year the album was released internationally by London-based label Critical Heights and re-issued in Australia on Bedroom Suck Records. Dermody admitted that "the fact that it has been re-issued is pleasant surprise to me" and that "at the time my painting career was going a lot better than my music career".[9]

Whilst based in Williamsburg, he formed a new lineup of the band but admitted that he found it difficult to find band members at first or to get gig bookings.[10] Former drummer Dion Nania re-located with Dermody and moved back on to guitar, bassist Karla Way from Beaches and guitarist Antonia Sellbach from Love of Diagrams and Beaches were also recruited.[11] The band recorded the _Two Weeks_ EP, which was released in early 2013 on 10" vinyl via Critical Heights.[12]

In 2013, the band signed to Fire Records after the label heard them through their Bandcamp page, and released second album _Any Port In A Storm_.[13] The album was recorded with another lineup of the band featuring guitarist Michael Caterer, drummer Michael Mimoun and bassist Ian Savage.[14] Written and recorded whilst in New York City, Dermody stated that "most of the inspiration came from my pretty standard places, girls, crap jobs and the place that I was living in".[15][16] The band toured the album worldwide, with longterm friend and producer Jack Farlay on bass.

In September 2014, the band released the cassette only mini-album _Back On The Tools_,[17] and the following year released the Australian-only EP _Delivered_ (later issued worldwide via Fire Records in 2016).

In October 2016, the band released their third album _Mid Thirties Single Scene_. Commenting on writing the album, Dermody revealed that "I've been writing a lot about stuff happening in life at the moment, moving back to Melbourne and trying to adjust to all of that. My father passed away during the period of writing so that's in there and girls, girls are in there".[18] Now back in Melbourne, the band consists of long-time friends and former band members, bassist Jack Farley, guitarist/backing vocalist Gill Tucker, drummer Joe Alexander (also owner of Bedroom Suck Records) and occasionally keyboardist/backing vocalist Esther Edquist. The band embarked on a world tour, taking in the UK, mainland Europe and Japan.[19][20][21] Tucker left the band in June 2017.[22]
