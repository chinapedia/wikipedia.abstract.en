ARNOLD ALOIS SCHWARZENEGGER (;[1] ; born July 30, 1947) is an American politician, actor, filmmaker, and former professional bodybuilder.[2] He served as the 38th Governor of California from 2003 to 2011.

Schwarzenegger began lifting weights at the age of 15. He won the Mr. Universe title at age 20 and went on to win the Mr. Olympia contest seven times, remaining a prominent presence in bodybuilding and writing many books and articles on the sport. The Arnold Sports Festival, considered the second most important professional bodybuilding event in recent years,[3] is named after him. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time, as well as the sport's most charismatic ambassador.[4]

Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action film icon. His breakthrough film was the sword-and-sorcery epic _Conan the Barbarian_ in 1982, a box-office hit that resulted in a sequel.[5] In 1984, he appeared in the title role of James Cameron's critically and commercially successful science-fiction thriller film _The Terminator_. He subsequently played a similar Terminator character in most of the franchise's later installments, _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_ (1991), _Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines_ (2003), _Terminator Genisys_ (2015),[6][7][8] and the upcoming _Terminator: Dark Fate_ (2019). He has appeared in a number of other successful films, such as _Commando_ (1985), _The Running Man_ (1987), _Predator_ (1987), _Twins_ (1988), _Total Recall_ (1990), _Kindergarten Cop_ (1990), and _True Lies_ (1994).

Schwarzenegger married Maria Shriver, a niece of the 35th U.S. President John F. Kennedy and daughter of the 1972 Democratic vice presidential candidate and former Ambassador to France Sargent Shriver, in 1986. They separated in 2011 after he admitted to having fathered a child with another woman in 1997;[9] the divorce was finalized in 2017.

As a Republican, Schwarzenegger was first elected on October 7, 2003, in a special recall election to replace then-Governor Gray Davis. He was sworn in on November 17, to serve the remainder of Davis' term. He was then re-elected in the 2006 California gubernatorial election, to serve a full term as governor.[10] In 2011, he completed his second term as governor and returned to acting.

Schwarzenegger was nicknamed "the Austrian Oak" in his bodybuilding days, "Arnie" or "Schwarzy" during his acting career, "The Governator" (a portmanteau of "Governor" and "Terminator") during his political career, and is commonly known in Japan as "Shuwa Chan" (シュワちゃん).


Early life

Thal_-_Geburtshaus_Arnold_Schwarzenegger1.jpg Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born on July 30, 1947, in Thal, Styria,[11] to Aurelia (_née_ Jadrny; 1922–1998) and Gustav Schwarzenegger (1907–1972). His father was the local chief of police and had served in World War II as a _Hauptfeldwebel_ after voluntarily joining the Nazi Party in 1938,[12] was wounded during the battle of Stalingrad,[13] but was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria. He married Schwarzenegger's mother on October 20, 1945; he was 38 and she was 23. According to Arnold Schwarzenegger, his parents were very strict: "Back then in Austria it was a very different world ... if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, the rod was not spared."[14] He grew up in a Catholic family who attended Mass every Sunday.[15][16]

Gustav had a preference for his elder son, Meinhard, over Arnold.[17] His favoritism was "strong and blatant", which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child.[18] Schwarzenegger has said that his father had "no patience for listening or understanding your problems."[19] He had a good relationship with his mother and kept in touch with her until her death.[20] In later life, he commissioned the Simon Wiesenthal Center to research his father's wartime record, which came up with no evidence of Gustav being involved in atrocities, despite his membership in the Nazi Party and Sturmabteilung (SA).[21] Gustav's background received wide press attention during the 2003 California recall campaign.[22]

At school, Schwarzenegger was reportedly academically average, but stood out for his "cheerful, good-humored, and exuberant" character.[23] Money was a problem in their household; Schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator.[24] As a boy, he played several sports, heavily influenced by his father.[25] He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym.[26] At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career.[27][28] He later said, "I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start olympic lifting."[29] However, his official website biography claims that "at 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career."[30] During a speech in 2001, he said, "My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school."[31]

Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in Graz, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen.[32] When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: "As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve." In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz.[33] He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, so that he could train even when it was closed. "It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it."[34] When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: "I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie."[35]

Schwarzenegger's brother, Meinhard, died in a car crash on May 20, 1971.[36] He was driving drunk and died instantly. Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral.[37] Meinhard was engaged to Erika Knapp, and they had a three-year-old son named Patrick. Schwarzenegger paid for Patrick's education and helped him to move to the U.S.[38] Gustav died on December 13, 1972, from a stroke.[39] In _Pumping Iron_, Schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his father's funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest. Later, he and the film's producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder to show the extremes some would go to for their sport and to make Schwarzenegger's image colder to create controversy for the film.[40] However, Barbara Baker, his first serious girlfriend, recalled that he informed her of his father's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother.[41] Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father's funeral.[42]

In an interview with _Fortune_ in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what "would now be called child abuse" at the hands of his father: "My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'You can't do this,' I said, 'This is not going to be for much longer because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.'"[43] Reagan+Schwarzenegger1984.jpg in 1984]]

Schwarzenegger served in the Austrian Army in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males.[44][45] During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest.[46] He went AWOL during basic training so he could take part in the competition and then spent a week in military prison: "Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences." He entered another bodybuilding contest in Graz, at Steirerhof Hotel, where he placed second. He was voted "best-built man of Europe", which made him famous in bodybuilding circles. "The Mr. Universe title was my ticket to America—the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich."[47] Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the NABBA Mr. Universe competition in London.[48] He would come in second in the Mr. Universe competition, not having the muscle definition of American winner Chester Yorton.[49]

Charles "Wag" Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language.[50][51] Living with the Bennetts also changed him as a person: "Being with them made me so much more sophisticated. When you're the age I was then, you're always looking for approval, for love, for attention and also for guidance. At the time, I wasn't really aware of that. But now, looking back, I see that the Bennett family fulfilled all those needs. Especially my need to be the best in the world. To be recognized and to feel unique and special. They saw that I needed that care and attention and love."[52]

Also in 1966, while at Bennett's home, Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol Reg Park, who became his friend and mentor.[53][54] The training paid off and, in 1967, Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time, becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at the age of 20.[55] He would go on to win the title a further three times.[56] Schwarzenegger then flew back to Munich, where he attended a business school and worked in a health club (Rolf Putziger's gym, where he worked and trained from 1966 to 1968), returning in 1968 to London to win his next Mr. Universe title.[57] He frequently told Roger C. Field, his English coach and friend in Munich at that time, "I'm going to become the greatest actor!"[58]

Schwarzenegger, who dreamed of moving to the U.S. since the age of 10, and saw bodybuilding as the avenue through which to do so,[59] realized his dream by moving to the United States in October 1968 at the age of 21, speaking little English.[60][61] There he trained at Gold's Gym in Venice, Los Angeles, California, under Joe Weider's supervision. From 1970 to 1974, one of Schwarzenegger's weight training partners was Ric Drasin, a professional wrestler who designed the original Gold's Gym logo in 1973.[62] Schwarzenegger also became good friends with professional wrestler Superstar Billy Graham. In 1970, at age 23, he captured his first Mr. Olympia title in New York, and would go on to win the title a total of seven times.[63]

The immigration law firm Siskind & Susser has stated that Schwarzenegger may have been an illegal immigrant at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s because of violations in the terms of his visa.[64] _LA Weekly_ would later say in 2002 that Schwarzenegger is the most famous immigrant in America, who "overcame a thick Austrian accent and transcended the unlikely background of bodybuilding to become the biggest movie star in the world in the 1990s".[65]

In 1977, Schwarzenegger's autobiography/weight-training guide _Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder_ became a huge success.[66] In 1977 he posed for the gay magazine _After Dark_.[67][68] After taking English classes at Santa Monica College in California, he earned a bachelor's degree by correspondence from the University of Wisconsin–Superior, in international marketing of fitness and business administration in 1979. He got his United States citizenship in 1983.[69]

Schwarzenegger said that during this time he encountered a friend who told him he was teaching Transcendental Meditation (TM), which prompted Schwarzenegger to reveal that he had been struggling with anxiety for the first time in his life: "Even today, I still benefit from [the year of TM] because I don't merge and bring things together and see everything as one big problem."[70]


Bodybuilding career

Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding,[71] and his legacy is commemorated in the Arnold Classic annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.

For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines _Muscle & Fitness_ and _Flex_. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed the executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California.[72] Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005.[73] American Media Inc., which owns _Muscle & Fitness_ and _Flex_, announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines.[74]

One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965.[75] He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19.[76][77] He would go on to compete in many bodybuilding contests, and win most of them. His bodybuilding victories included five Mr. Universe wins (4 – NABBA [England], 1 – IFBB [USA]), and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until Lee Haney won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.

Schwarzenegger continues to work out. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 Arnold Classic he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.[78]

Powerlifting/weightlifting

During Schwarzenegger's early years in bodybuilding, he also competed in several Olympic weightlifting and powerlifting contests. Schwarzenegger's first professional competition was in 1963[79] and he won two weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965, as well as two powerlifting contests in 1966 and 1968.[80]

In 1967, Schwarzenegger won the Munich stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254 kg / 560 lbs.) is lifted between the legs while standing on two footrests.

Mr. Olympia

Schwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming Mr. Olympia.[88][89] His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion Sergio Oliva. However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he still holds to this day.[90]

He continued his winning streak in the 1971–74 competitions.[91] In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time,[92] beating Franco Columbu. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.[93]

Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete, in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called _Pumping Iron._ Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film _Stay Hungry_ with Jeff Bridges. Although significantly taller and heavier, Lou Ferrigno proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia.

Schwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia.[94] Schwarzenegger was training for his role in _Conan_, and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide color commentary for network television when he announced at the eleventh hour that, while he was there, "Why not compete?" Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. Having being declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition. This victory (subject of the documentary "The Comeback") was highly controversial, though, as fellow competitors and many observers felt that his lack of muscle mass (especially in his thighs)[95] and subpar conditioning shouldn't have allowed him to come ahead of a very competitive lineup that year;[96] Mike Mentzer, in particular, felt cheated and withdrew from competitive bodybuilding after that contest.[97][98]

Steroid use

Schwarzenegger has admitted to using performance-enhancing anabolic steroids while they were legal, writing in 1977 that "steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth, but rather for muscle maintenance when cutting up."[99] He has called the drugs "tissue building".[100]

In 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Willi Heepe, a German doctor who publicly predicted his early death on the basis of a link between his steroid use and his later heart problems. As the doctor had never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a US$10,000 libel judgment against him in a German court.[101] In 1999, Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with _Globe_, a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder's future health.[102]

Acting career

Early roles

Schwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the role of Hercules in 1969's _Hercules in New York_. Credited under the stage name "Arnold Strong", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production.[107] His second film appearance was as a deaf-mute mob hitman in _The Long Goodbye_ (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film _Stay Hungry_ (1976), for which he won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: "It was very difficult for me in the beginning – I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance."[108]

Schwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the bodybuilding film _Pumping Iron_ (1977),[109][110] elements of which were dramatized; in 1991, he purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography.[111] In 1977, he made guest appearances in single episodes of the ABC sitcom _The San Pedro Beach Bums_ and the ABC police procedural _The Streets of San Francisco_. Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of _The Incredible Hulk_, but did not win the role because of his height. Later, Lou Ferrigno got the part of Dr. David Banner's alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with Kirk Douglas and Ann-Margret in the 1979 comedy _The Villain_. In 1980, he starred in a biographical film of the 1950s actress Jayne Mansfield as Mansfield's husband, Mickey Hargitay.

Action superstar

Schwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the sword-and-sorcery epic _Conan the Barbarian_ in 1982, which was a box-office hit.[112] This was followed by a sequel, _Conan the Destroyer_, in 1984, although it was not as successful as its predecessor.[113] In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video, _Carnival in Rio_. In 1984, he made his first appearance as the eponymous character, and what some would say was his acting career's signature role, in James Cameron's science fiction thriller film _The Terminator_.[114][115][116] Following this, Schwarzenegger made _Red Sonja_ in 1985.[117] During the 1980s, audiences had an appetite for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone becoming international stars.[118] Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his sense of humor, separating him from more serious action hero films. He made a number of successful action films in the 1980s, such as _Commando_ (1985), _Raw Deal_ (1986), _The Running Man_ (1987), _Predator_ (1987), and _Red Heat_ (1988).

Chth_arnold_schwarzenegger.jpg, with his catchphrase _"I'll be back"_ written in.]] _Twins_ (1988), a comedy with Danny DeVito, also proved successful. _Total Recall_ (1990) netted Schwarzenegger $10 million (equivalent to $ million today) and 15% of the film's gross. A science fiction script, the film was based on the Philip K. Dick short story "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale". _Kindergarten Cop_ (1990) reunited him with director Ivan Reitman, who directed him in _Twins_. Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing, first with a 1990 episode of the TV series _Tales from the Crypt_, entitled "The Switch",[119] and then with the 1992 telemovie _Christmas in Connecticut_.[120] He has not directed since.

Schwarzenegger's commercial peak was his return as the title character in 1991's _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_, which was the highest-grossing film of 1991. In 1993, the National Association of Theatre Owners named him the "International Star of the Decade".[121] His next film project, the 1993 self-aware action comedy spoof _Last Action Hero_, was released opposite _Jurassic Park_, and did not do well at the box office. His next film, the comedy drama _True Lies_ (1994), was a popular spy film and saw Schwarzenegger reunited with James Cameron.

That same year, the comedy _Junior_ was released, the last of Schwarzenegger's three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring Danny DeVito. This film brought him his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. It was followed by the action thriller _Eraser_ (1996), the Christmas comedy _Jingle All The Way_ (1996), and the comic book-based _Batman & Robin_ (1997), in which he played the villain Mr. Freeze. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of _Batman & Robin_, his film career and box office prominence went into decline. He returned with the supernatural thriller _End of Days_ (1999), later followed by the action films _The 6th Day_ (2000) and _Collateral Damage_ (2002), both of which failed to do well at the box office. In 2003, he made his third appearance as the title character in _Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines_, which went on to earn over $150 million domestically (equivalent to $ million today).[122] Arnold_Schwarzenegger's_star_on_the_Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame.jpeg In tribute to Schwarzenegger in 2002, Forum Stadtpark, a local cultural association, proposed plans to build a _Terminator_ statue in a park in central Graz. Schwarzenegger reportedly said he was flattered, but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the Special Olympics.[123]

Retirement

His film appearances after becoming Governor of California included a three-second cameo appearance in _The Rundown_, and the 2004 remake of _Around the World in 80 Days_. In 2005, he appeared as himself in the film _The Kid & I_. He voiced Baron von Steuben in the _Liberty's Kids_ episode "Valley Forge". He had been rumored to be appearing in _Terminator Salvation_ as the original T-800; he denied his involvement,[124] but he ultimately did appear briefly via his image being inserted into the movie from stock footage of the first _Terminator_ movie.[125][126] Schwarzenegger appeared in Sylvester Stallone's _The Expendables_, where he made a cameo appearance.

Return to acting

In January 2011, just weeks after leaving office in California, Schwarzenegger announced that he was reading several new scripts for future films, one of them being the World War II action drama _With Wings as Eagles_, written by Randall Wallace, based on a true story.[127][128]

On March 6, 2011, at the Arnold Seminar of the Arnold Classic, Schwarzenegger revealed that he was being considered for several films, including sequels to _The Terminator_ and remakes of _Predator_ and _The Running Man_, and that he was "packaging" a comic book character.[129] The character was later revealed to be the Governator, star of the comic book and animated series of the same name. Schwarzenegger inspired the character and co-developed it with Stan Lee, who would have produced the series. Schwarzenegger would have voiced the Governator.[130][131][132][133]

On May 20, 2011, Schwarzenegger's entertainment counsel announced that all movie projects currently in development were being halted: "Schwarzenegger is focusing on personal matters and is not willing to commit to any production schedules or timelines."[134] On July 11, 2011, it was announced that Schwarzenegger was considering a comeback film, despite the legal problems related to his divorce.[135] He appeared in _The Expendables 2_ (2012),[136] and starred in _The Last Stand_ (2013), his first leading role in 10 years, and _Escape Plan_ (2013), his first co-starring role alongside Sylvester Stallone. He starred in _Sabotage_, released in March 2014, and appeared in _The Expendables 3_, released in August 2014. He starred in the fifth Terminator movie _Terminator Genisys_ in 2015[137] and would reprise his role as Conan the Barbarian in _The Legend of Conan_,[138][139] later renamed _Conan the Conqueror_.[140] However, in April 2017, producer Chris Morgan stated that Universal had dropped the project, although there was a possibility of a TV show. The story of the film was supposed to be set 30 years after the first, with some inspiration from Clint Eastwood's _Unforgiven_.[141]

In August 2016, his filming of action-comedy _Why We're Killing Gunther_ was temporarily interrupted by bank robbers near filming location in Surrey, British Columbia.[142] He was announced to star and produce in a film about the ruins of Sanxingdui called _The Guest of Sanxingdui_, as an ambassador.[143]

On February 6, 2018, Amazon Studios announced they were working with Schwarzenegger to develop a new series entitled _Outrider_ in which he will star and executive produce. The western-drama set in the Oklahoma Indian Territory in the late 1800s will follow a deputy (portrayed by Schwarzenegger) who is tasked with apprehending a legendary outlaw in the wilderness but is forced to partner with a ruthless Federal Marshal to make sure justice is properly served. The series will also mark as Schwarzenegger's first major scripted TV role.[144]

Schwarzenegger is to return to the _Terminator_ franchise with _Terminator: Dark Fate_, which will be released on November 1, 2019. It is being produced by the series' co-creator James Cameron, who directed him previously in the first two films in the series and in _True Lies_.[145][146] It was shot in Almería, Hungary and the US.[147]

_The Celebrity Apprentice_

In September 2015, the media announced that Schwarzenegger was to replace Donald Trump as host of _The New Celebrity Apprentice_.[148] This show, the 15th season of _The Apprentice_, aired during the 2016–2017 TV season. In the show, he used the phrases "you're terminated" and "get to the choppa", which are quotes from some of his famous roles (_The Terminator_ and _Predator_, respectively), when firing the contestants.

In March 2017, following repeated criticisms from Trump, Schwarzenegger announced that he would not return for another season on the show. Schwarzenegger had reacted to Trump's latest remarks in January 2017 via an Instagram clip:

  "Hey, Donald, I have a great idea. Why don't we switch jobs? You take over TV because you're such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job, and then people can finally sleep comfortably again."[149]

Political career

Early politics

Arnold-Cheney.jpg meets with Schwarzenegger for the first time at the White House]]

Schwarzenegger has been a registered Republican for many years. When he was an actor, his political views were always well known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent Hollywood stars, who are generally considered to be a liberal and Democratic-leaning community. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, Schwarzenegger gave a speech and explained he was a Republican because the Democrats of the 1960s sounded too much like Austrian socialists.[150]

Arnold_Schwarzenegger_on_Capitol_Hill_(cropped).jpg In 1985, Schwarzenegger appeared in "Stop the Madness", an anti-drug music video sponsored by the Reagan administration. He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the 1988 presidential election, accompanying then-Vice President George H. W. Bush at a campaign rally.[151]

Schwarzenegger's first political appointment was as chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, on which he served from 1990 to 1993.[152] He was nominated by George H. W. Bush, who dubbed him "Conan the Republican". He later served as chairman for the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor Pete Wilson.

Between 1993 and 1994, Schwarzenegger was a Red Cross ambassador (a ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities), recording several television and radio public service announcements to donate blood.

In an interview with _Talk_ magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office. He replied, "I think about it many times. The possibility is there because I feel it inside." _The Hollywood Reporter_ claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for governor of California Following his initial comments, Schwarzenegger said, "I'm in show business – I am in the middle of my career. Why would I go away from that and jump into something else?"[153]

Governor of California

Arnold Schwarzenegger is a moderate Republican.[154] He says he is fiscally conservative and socially liberal.[155] On the issue of abortion, he describes himself as pro-choice, but supports parental notification for minors and a ban on partial-birth abortion.[156] He has supported gay rights, such as domestic partnerships, and he performed a same-sex marriage as Governor.[157]

Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the 2003 California recall election for Governor of California on the August 6, 2003, episode of _The Tonight Show with Jay Leno_.[158] Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the "Governator" (referring to _The Terminator_ movies, see above) and "The Running Man" (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election "Total Recall" (yet another movie starring Schwarzenegger). Schwarzenegger declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates, and appeared in only one debate on September 24, 2003.[159]

Schwarzenegger_Bush.jpg meets with Schwarzenegger after his successful election to the California Governorship.]] On October 7, 2003, the recall election resulted in Governor Gray Davis being removed from office with 55.4% of the _Yes_ vote in favor of a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat Cruz Bustamante, fellow Republican Tom McClintock, and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received 31% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3 million votes. Under the regulations of the California Constitution, no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the second foreign-born governor of California after Irish-born Governor John G. Downey in 1862.

Schwarzenegger was entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up gridlock. Building on a catchphrase from the sketch "Hans and Franz" from _Saturday Night Live_ (which partly parodied his bodybuilding career), Schwarzenegger called the Democratic State politicians "girlie men".[160]

Schwarzenegger's early victories included repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver's licenses being given out to illegal immigrants, but later he began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a special election he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California. He would later comment that "no one could win if the opposition raised 160 million dollars to defeat you". The U.S. Supreme Court later found the public employee unions' use of compulsory fundraising during the campaign had been illegal in _Knox v. Service Employees International Union, Local 1000_.[161]

Dmitry_Medvedev_in_the_United_States_23_June_2010-5.jpeg and Cisco CEO John Chambers]] Schwarzenegger, against the advice of fellow Republican strategists, appointed a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, as his Chief of Staff. He gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election.

Schwarzenegger ran for re-election against Democrat Phil Angelides, the California State Treasurer, in the 2006 elections, held on November 7, 2006. Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party, Schwarzenegger won re-election with 56.0% of the vote compared with 38.9% for Angelides, a margin of well over 1 million votes.[162] Around this time, many commentators saw Schwarzenegger as moving away from the right and towards the center of the political spectrum. After hearing a speech by Schwarzenegger at the 2006 Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast, in which Schwarzenegger said, in part "How wrong I was when I said everyone has an equal opportunity to make it in America [...] the state of California does not provide (equal) education for all of our children", San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom said that "[H]e's becoming a Democrat [... H]e's running back, not even to the center. I would say center-left".[163]

Some speculated that Schwarzenegger might run for the United States Senate in 2010, as his governorship would be term-limited by that time. Such rumors turned out to be false.[164][165]

Visit_wildfires_2007.jpg behind him, President George W. Bush comments on wildfires and firefighting efforts in California, October 2007.]] Wendy Leigh, who wrote an unofficial biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and bodybuilding as the means to escape a depressing home.[166] Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, "I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential – I was always fascinated by people in control of other people."[167] Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, "I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and Sargent Shriver became my heroes."[168] Eunice Kennedy Shriver was the sister of John F. Kennedy, and mother-in-law to Schwarzenegger; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Schwarzenegger.

Schwarzenegger cannot run for U.S. President as he is not a natural-born citizen of the United States. Schwarzenegger is a dual Austrian and United States citizen.[169] He has held Austrian citizenship since birth and U.S. citizenship since becoming naturalized in 1983. Being Austrian and thus European, he was able to win the 2007 European Voice campaigner of the year award for taking action against climate change with the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and plans to introduce an emissions trading scheme with other US states and possibly with the EU.[170]

Schwarzenegger's endorsement in the Republican primary of the 2008 U.S. presidential election was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates Rudy Giuliani and Senator John McCain, Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. Giuliani dropped out of the presidential race on January 30, 2008, largely because of a poor showing in Florida, and endorsed McCain. Later that night, Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. The following day, he endorsed McCain, joking, "It's Rudy's fault!" (in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind). Schwarzenegger's endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator McCain's campaign; both spoke about their concerns for the environment and economy.[172]

In its April 2010 report, Progressive ethics watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Schwarzenegger one of 11 "worst governors" in the United States because of various ethics issues throughout Schwarzenegger's term as governor.[173][174]

Governor Schwarzenegger played a significant role in opposing Proposition 66, a proposed amendment of the Californian Three Strikes Law, in November 2004. This amendment would have required the third felony to be either violent or serious to mandate a 25-years-to-life sentence. In the last week before the ballot, Schwarzenegger launched an intensive campaign[175] against Proposition 66.[176] He stated that "it would release 26,000 dangerous criminals and rapists".[177]

Although he began his tenure as governor with record high approval ratings (as high as 65% in May 2004),[178] he left office with a record low 23%,[179] only one percent higher than that of Gray Davis, when he was recalled in October 2003.

Death of Louis Santos

In May 2010, Esteban Núñez pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 16 years in prison for the death of Louis Santos. Núñez is the son of Fabian Núñez, then California Assembly Speaker of the House and a close friend and staunch political ally of then governor Schwarzenegger.[180][181][182][183]

As a personal favor to "a friend", just hours before he left office, and as one of his last official acts, Schwarzenegger commuted Núñez's sentence by more than half, to seven years.[184][185][186] Against protocol, Schwarzenegger did not inform Santos' family or the San Diego County prosecutors about the commutation. They learned about it in a call from a reporter.[187]

The Santos family, along with the San Diego district attorney, sued to stop the commutation, claiming that it violated Marsy's Law. In September 2012, Sacramento County superior court judge Lloyd Connelly stated, "Based on the evidentiary records before this court involving this case, there was an abuse of discretion...This was a distasteful commutation. It was repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state." However, Connelly ruled that Schwarzenegger remained within his executive powers as governor.[188] Subsequently, as a direct result of the way the commutation was handled, Governor Jerry Brown signed a bipartisan bill that allows offender's victims and their families to be notified at least 10 days notice for any commutations.[189] Núñez was released from prison after serving less than six years.[190]

Allegations of sexual misconduct

Arnold_Schwarzenegger_sexual_harassment_protestors750.jpg protesting against Schwarzenegger]] During his initial campaign for governor, allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against Schwarzenegger, dubbed "Gropegate".[191] Within the last five days before the election, news reports appeared in the _Los Angeles Times_ recounting allegations of sexual misconduct from several individual women, six of whom eventually came forward with their personal stories.[192]

Three of the women claimed he had grabbed their breasts, a fourth said he placed his hand under her skirt on her buttock. A fifth woman claimed Schwarzenegger tried to take off her bathing suit in a hotel elevator, and the last said he pulled her onto his lap and asked her about a sex act.[193]

Schwarzenegger admitted that he has "behaved badly sometimes" and apologized, but also stated that "a lot of [what] you see in the stories is not true". This came after an interview in adult magazine _Oui_ from 1977 surfaced, in which Schwarzenegger discussed attending sexual orgies and using substances such as marijuana.[194] Schwarzenegger is shown smoking a marijuana joint after winning Mr. Olympia in the 1975 documentary film _Pumping Iron._ In an interview with _GQ_ magazine in October 2007, Schwarzenegger said, "[Marijuana] is not a drug. It's a leaf. My drug was pumping iron, trust me."[195] His spokesperson later said the comment was meant to be a joke.[196]

British television personality Anna Richardson settled a libel lawsuit in August 2006 against Schwarzenegger, his top aide, Sean Walsh, and his publicist, Sheryl Main.[197] A joint statement read: "The parties are content to put this matter behind them and are pleased that this legal dispute has now been settled."[198] Richardson claimed they tried to tarnish her reputation by dismissing her allegations that Schwarzenegger touched her breast during a press event for _The 6th Day_ in London.[199] She claimed Walsh and Main libeled her in a _Los Angeles Times_ article when they contended she encouraged his behavior.[200]

Citizenship

Arnold_Schwarzenegger_2004-01-30.jpg

Schwarzenegger became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 17, 1983.[201] Shortly before he gained his citizenship, he asked the Austrian authorities for the right to keep his Austrian citizenship, as Austria does not usually allow dual citizenship. His request was granted, and he retained his Austrian citizenship.[202] In 2005, Peter Pilz, a member of the Austrian Parliament from the Austrian Green Party, unsuccessfully advocated for Parliament to revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship due to his decision not to prevent the executions of Donald Beardslee and Stanley Williams. Pilz argued that Schwarzenegger caused damage to Austria's reputation in the international community because Austria abolished the death penalty in 1968. Pilz based his argument on Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act, which states: "A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic."[203] Pilz claimed that Schwarzenegger's actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights) had damaged Austria's reputation. Schwarzenegger explained his actions by pointing out that his only duty as Governor of California with respect to the death penalty was to correct an error by the justice system by pardon or clemency if such an error had occurred.

Environmental record

On September 27, 2006, Schwarzenegger signed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, creating the nation's first cap on greenhouse gas emissions. The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries, and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state's greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.[204]

Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006, allowing California to work with the Northeast's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. They plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the number of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan took effect in 2009.[205] In addition to using his political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint. Schwarzenegger has adapted one of his Hummers to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels. He has also installed solar panels to heat his home.[206]

In respect of his contribution to the direction of the US motor industry, Schwarzenegger was invited to open the 2009 SAE World Congress in Detroit, on April 20, 2009.[207]

In 2011, Schwarzenegger founded the R20 Regions of Climate Action to develop a sustainable, low-carbon economy.[208]

Electoral history

Presidential ambitions

The Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment in 2003 was widely accredited as the "Amend for Arnold" bill, which would have added an amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing his run, as he was not a natural born citizen. In 2004, the "Amend for Arnold" campaign was launched, featuring a website and TV advertising promotion.[209]

In June 2007, Schwarzenegger was featured on the cover of _TIME_ magazine with Michael Bloomberg, and subsequently, the two joked about a Presidential ticket together.[210]

In October 2013, the _New York Post_ reported that Schwarzenegger was exploring a future run for president. The former California governor would face a constitutional hurdle; Article II, Section I, Clause V nominally prevents individuals who are not natural-born citizens of the United States from assuming the office. He has reportedly been lobbying legislators about a possible constitutional change, or filing a legal challenge to the provision. Columbia University law professor Michael Dorf observed that Schwarzenegger's possible lawsuit could ultimately win him the right to run for the office, noting, "The law is very clear, but it's not 100 percent clear that the courts would enforce that law rather than leave it to the political process."[211]


Business career

Schwarzenegger has had a highly successful business career.[212][213] Following his move to the United States, Schwarzenegger became a "prolific goal setter" and would write his objectives at the start of the year on index cards, like starting a mail order business or buying a new car – and succeed in doing so.[214] By the age of 30, Schwarzenegger was a millionaire, well before his career in Hollywood. His financial independence came from his success as a budding entrepreneur with a series of lucrative business ventures and investments.

Bricklaying business

In 1968, Schwarzenegger and fellow bodybuilder Franco Columbu started a bricklaying business. The business flourished thanks to the pair's marketing savvy and an increased demand following the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.[215][216] Schwarzenegger and Columbu used profits from their bricklaying venture to start a mail-order business, selling bodybuilding and fitness-related equipment and instructional tapes.[217][218]

Investments

Schwarzenegger transferred profits from the mail-order business and his bodybuilding-competition winnings into his first real estate investment venture: an apartment building he purchased for $10,000. He would later go on to invest in a number of real estate holding companies.[219][220]

Schwarzenegger was a founding celebrity investor in the Planet Hollywood chain of international theme restaurants (modeled after the Hard Rock Cafe) along with Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone and Demi Moore. Schwarzenegger severed his financial ties with the business in early 2000.[221][222] Schwarzenegger said the company had not had the success he had hoped for, claiming he wanted to focus his attention on "new US global business ventures" and his movie career.[223]

He also invested in a shopping mall in Columbus, Ohio. He has talked about some of those who have helped him over the years in business: "I couldn't have learned about business without a parade of teachers guiding me... from Milton Friedman to Donald Trump... and now, Les Wexner and Warren Buffett. I even learned a thing or two from Planet Hollywood, such as when to get out! And I did!"[224] He has significant ownership in Dimensional Fund Advisors, an investment firm.[225] Schwarzenegger is also the owner of Arnold's Sports Festival, which he started in 1989 and is held annually in Columbus, Ohio. It is a festival that hosts thousands of international health and fitness professionals which has also expanded into a three-day expo. He also owns a movie production company called Oak Productions, Inc. and Fitness Publications, a joint publishing venture with Simon & Schuster.[226]

Restaurant

In 1992, Schwarzenegger and his wife opened a restaurant in Santa Monica called _Schatzi On Main_. _Schatzi_ literally means "little treasure," colloquial for "honey" or "darling" in German. In 1998, he sold his restaurant.[227]

Wealth

Schwarzenegger's net worth had been conservatively estimated at $100 million–$200 million.[228] After separating from his wife, Maria Shriver, in 2011, it has been estimated that his net worth has been approximately $400 million, and even as high as $800 million, based on tax returns he filed in 2006.[229]

Over the years as an investor, he invested his bodybuilding and movie earnings in an array of stocks, bonds, privately controlled companies, and real estate holdings worldwide, making his net worth as an accurate estimation difficult to calculate, particularly in light of declining real estate values owing to economic recessions in the U.S. and Europe since the late 2000s. In June 1997, Schwarzenegger spent $38 million of his own money on a private Gulfstream jet.[230] Schwarzenegger once said of his fortune, "Money doesn't make you happy. I now have $50 million, but I was just as happy when I had $48 million."[231]

Commercial advertisements

He appears in a series of commercials for the Machine Zone game _Mobile Strike_ as a military commander and spokesman.[232]


Personal life

Early relationships

Arnold_Schwarzenegger_and_Maria_Schriver-mod.jpg at the 2007 Special Olympics in Shanghai]] In 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher with whom he lived until 1974.[233] Schwarzenegger said of Baker in his 1977 memoir, "Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life."[234] Baker has described Schwarzenegger as a "joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic" but claims that towards the end of the relationship he became "insufferable—classically conceited—the world revolved around him".[235] Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled _Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak_.[236] Although Baker painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover at times, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours.[237]

Baker claims that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life.[238] Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ.[239] The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S. Their first date was watching the first Apollo Moon landing on television.[240] They shared an apartment in Santa Monica, California, for three and a half years, and having little money, they would visit the beach all day or have barbecues in the back yard.[241] Although Baker claims that when she first met Schwarzenegger, he had "little understanding of polite society" and she found him a turn-off, she says, "He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be—he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive ... I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me."[242]

Schwarzenegger met his next lover, Beverly Hills hairdresser's assistant Sue Moray, on Venice Beach in July 1977. According to Moray, the couple led an open relationship: "We were faithful when we were both in LA... but when he was out of town, we were free to do whatever we wanted."[243] Schwarzenegger met television journalist Maria Shriver, niece of President John F. Kennedy, at the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in August 1977. He went on to have a relationship with both Moray and Shriver until August 1978, when Moray (who knew of his relationship with Shriver) issued an ultimatum.[244]

Marriage and family

On April 26, 1986, Schwarzenegger married Shriver in Hyannis, Massachusetts. The Rev. John Baptist Riordan performed the ceremony at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church.[245] They have four children: Katherine Eunice Schwarzenegger (born December 13, 1989), Christina Maria Aurelia Schwarzenegger (born July 23, 1991),[246] Patrick Arnold Shriver Schwarzenegger (born September 18, 1993),[247] and Christopher Sargent Shriver Schwarzenegger (born September 27, 1997).[248] All of their children were born in Los Angeles.[249] The family lived in a home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California,[250][251] with vacation homes in Sun Valley, Idaho and Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.[252] They attended St. Monica's Catholic Church.[253]

Marital separation

Arnoldandson.jpg at Edwards Air Force Base in December 2002]] On May 9, 2011, Shriver and Schwarzenegger ended their relationship after 25 years of marriage, with Shriver moving out of the couple's Brentwood mansion.[254][255][256] On May 16, 2011, the _Los Angeles Times_ revealed that Schwarzenegger had fathered a son more than 14 years earlier with an employee in their household, Mildred Patricia "Patty" Baena.[257][258][259] "After leaving the governor's office I told my wife about this event, which occurred over a decade ago," Schwarzenegger said in a statement issued to _The Times_. In the statement, Schwarzenegger did not mention that he had confessed to his wife only after she had confronted him with the information, which she had done after confirming with the housekeeper what she had suspected about the child.[260]

Baena is of Guatemalan origin. She was employed by the family for 20 years and retired in January 2011.[261] The pregnant Baena was working in the home while Shriver was pregnant with the youngest of the couple's four children.[262] Baena's son with Schwarzenegger, Joseph,[263] was born on October 2, 1997,[264] and Shriver gave birth to Christopher a few days before on September 27, 1997.[265] Schwarzenegger says it took seven or eight years before he found out that he had fathered a child with his housekeeper. It was not until the boy "started looking like [him] ... that [he] put things together".[266] Schwarzenegger has taken financial responsibility for the child "from the start and continued to provide support".[267] KNX 1070 radio reported that in 2010 he bought a new four-bedroom house with a pool for Baena and their son in Bakersfield, California.[268] Baena separated from her husband, Rogelio, a few months after Joseph's birth. She filed for divorce in 2008.[269] Rogelio says that the child's birth certificate was falsified and that he planned to sue Schwarzenegger for engaging in conspiracy to falsify a public document, a serious crime in California.[270]

Pursuant to the divorce judgment, Schwarzenegger kept the Brentwood home, while Shriver purchased a new home nearby so that the children could travel between their parents' homes. They shared custody of the two youngest children.[271] Schwarzenegger came under fire after the initial petition did not include spousal support and a reimbursement of attorney's fees.[272] However, he claims this was not intentional and that he signed the initial documents without having properly read them.[273] He filed amended divorce papers remedying this.[274][275] Schwarzenegger and Shriver finalized their divorce in 2017, six years after separating.[276]

After the scandal, Danish-Italian actress Brigitte Nielsen came forward and stated that she too had an affair with Schwarzenegger while he was in a relationship with Shriver,[277] saying, "Maybe I wouldn't have got into it if he said 'I'm going to marry Maria' and this is deadly serious, but he didn't, and our affair carried on."[278] When asked in January 2014, "Of all the things you are famous for ... which are you least proud of?" Schwarzenegger replied, "I'm least proud of the mistakes I made that caused my family pain and split us up."[279]

, Schwarzenegger was dating physical therapist Heather Milligan, 27 years his junior.[280]

Accidents and injuries

Schwarzenegger was born with a bicuspid aortic valve, an aortic valve with only two leaflets (a normal aortic valve has three leaflets).[281][282] He opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made of his own transplanted tissue; medical experts predicted he would require heart valve replacement surgery in the following two to eight years as his valve would progressively degrade. Schwarzenegger apparently opted against a mechanical valve, the only permanent solution available at the time of his surgery, because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise.[283] On March 29, 2018, Schwarzenegger had undergone emergency open-heart surgery.[284] He said about his recovery: "I underwent open-heart surgery this spring, I had to use a walker. I had to do breathing exercises five times a day to retrain my lungs. I was frustrated and angry, and in my worst moments, I couldn't see the way back to my old self."[285]

On December 9, 2001, he broke six ribs and was hospitalized for four days after a motorcycle crash in Los Angeles.[286]

Schwarzenegger saved a drowning man's life in 2004 while on vacation in Hawaii by swimming out and bringing him back to shore.[287]

On January 8, 2006, while Schwarzenegger was riding his Harley Davidson motorcycle in Los Angeles, with his son Patrick in the sidecar, another driver backed into the street he was riding on, causing him and his son to collide with the car at a low speed. While his son and the other driver were unharmed, Schwarzenegger sustained a minor injury to his lip, requiring 15 stitches. "No citations were issued," said Officer Jason Lee, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman.[288] Schwarzenegger did not obtain his motorcycle license until July 3, 2006.[289]

Schwarzenegger tripped over his ski pole and broke his right femur while skiing in Sun Valley, Idaho, with his family on December 23, 2006.[290] On December 26, he underwent a 90-minute operation in which cables and screws were used to wire the broken bone back together. He was released from the St. John's Health Center on December 30, 2006.[291]

Schwarzenegger's private jet made an emergency landing at Van Nuys Airport on June 19, 2009, after the pilot reported smoke coming from the cockpit, according to a statement released by his press secretary. No one was harmed in the incident.[292]

On May 18, 2019, while on a visit to South Africa, Schwarzenegger was attacked, drop-kicked from behind by an unknown malefactor, while giving autographs to his fans at one of the local schools. Despite the surprise and unprovoked nature of the attack, he reportedly suffered no injuries and continued to interact with fans. The attacker was apprehended and Schwarzenegger declined to press charges against him.[293][294][295]

Height

Schwarzenegger's official height of 6'2" (1.88 m) has been brought into question by several articles. In his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s, he was measured to be 6'1.5" (1.87 m), a height confirmed by his fellow bodybuilders.[296][297] However, in 1988, both the _Daily Mail_ and _Time Out_ magazine mentioned that Schwarzenegger appeared noticeably shorter.[298] Prior to running for governor, Schwarzenegger's height was once again questioned in an article by the _Chicago Reader_.[299] As governor, Schwarzenegger engaged in a light-hearted exchange with Assemblyman Herb Wesson over their heights. At one point, Wesson made an unsuccessful attempt to, in his own words, "settle this once and for all and find out how tall he is" by using a tailor's tape measure on the Governor.[300] Schwarzenegger retaliated by placing a pillow stitched with the words "Need a lift?" on the five-foot-five inch (165 cm) Wesson's chair before a negotiating session in his office.[301] Bob Mulholland also claimed Schwarzenegger was 5'10" (1.78 m) and that he wore risers in his boots.[302] In 1999, _Men's Health_ magazine stated his height was 5'10".[303]

Autobiography

Schwarzenegger's autobiography, _Total Recall_, was released in October 2012. He devotes one chapter called "The Secret" to his extramarital affair. The majority of his book is about his successes in the three major chapters in his life: bodybuilder, actor, and Governor of California.[304]

Vehicles

Growing up during the Allied occupation of Austria, Schwarzenegger commonly saw heavy military vehicles such as tanks as a child.[305] As a result, he came to develop an interest in large vehicles and became the first civilian in the U.S. to purchase a Humvee. He was so enamored by the vehicle that he lobbied the Humvee's manufacturer, AM General, to produce a street-legal, civilian version, which they did in 1992; the first two Hummer H1s they sold were also purchased by Schwarzenegger. In 2010, he had one regular and three running on non-fossil power sources; one for hydrogen, one for vegetable oil, and one for biodiesel.[306] Schwarzenegger was in the news in 2014 for buying a rare Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse. He was spotted and filmed in 2015 in his car, painted silver with bright aluminium forged wheels. His Bugatti has its interior adorned in dark brown leather.[307] In 2017, Schwarzenegger acquired a Mercedes G-Class modified for all-electric drive.[308]

The Hummers that Schwarzenegger bought in 1992 are so large—each weighs and is wide—that they are classified as large trucks, and U.S. fuel economy regulations do not apply to them. During the gubernatorial recall campaign, he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about $21,000. After the election, he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the California Hydrogen Highway Network, and gained a U.S. Department of Energy grant to help pay for its projected US$91,000,000 cost.[309] California took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004.[310]


Public life

ICG is active in 15 cities around the country and serves over 250,000 children in over 400 schools countrywide.[314] He has also been involved with After-School All-Stars and founded the Los Angeles branch in 2002.[315] ASAS is an after school program provider, educating youth about health, fitness and nutrition.

On February 12, 2010, Schwarzenegger took part in the Vancouver Olympic Torch relay. He handed off the flame to the next runner, Sebastian Coe.[316]

Schwarzenegger had a collection of Marxist busts, which he requested from Russian friends at the end of the Soviet Union as they were being destroyed. In 2011, he revealed that his wife had requested they be removed, but he kept the one of Vladimir Lenin present, since "he was the first".[317] In 2015, he said he kept the Lenin bust to "show losers".[318]

Schwarzenegger is a lifelong supporter and "friend of Israel", and has participated in L.A.'s Pro-Israel rally[319] among other similar events.[320]

2017_Wahlkampf-Tour-_Oberösterreich_(37342740665).jpg in September 2017]] Schwarzenegger supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[321] Schwarzenegger also expressed support for the 2011 military intervention in Libya.[322]

Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy

In 2012, Schwarzenegger helped to found the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, which is a part of the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy at the University of Southern California.[323] The Institute's mission is to "[advance] post-partisanship, where leaders put people over political parties and work together to find the best ideas and solutions to benefit the people they serve" and to "seek to influence public policy and public debate in finding solutions to the serious challenges we face".[324] Schwarzenegger serves as chairman of the Institute.[325]

Global warming

At a 2015 security conference, Arnold Schwarzenegger called climate change the issue of our time.[326]

2016 Presidential election

For the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, Schwarzenegger endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich.[327] However, he announced in October that he would not vote for the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in that year's United States presidential election, with this being the first time he did not vote for the Republican candidate since becoming a citizen in 1983.[328][329][330]

Post 2016

In recent years Schwarzenegger has been advocating for eating less meat[331], and he is an executive producer alongside James Cameron et al behind the upcoming documentary The Game Changers[332], that documents the explosive rise of plant-based eating in professional sports, in which he will also star himself.

In 2019, while at the Arnold Classic Africa sports competition as an official, Arnold was attacked by an assailant in a flying kick. The assailant was arrested.[333]
