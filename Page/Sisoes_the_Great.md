Saint SISOËS THE GREAT (also SISOI THE GREAT, SISOY THE GREAT, SISOES OF SCETÉ or SHISHOY; †429 AD) was an early Christian desert father, a solitary monk pursuing asceticism in the Egyptian desert in a cave of his predecessor, St Anthony the Great. St Sisoës is revered as a saint by Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, who consider him a wonderworker. His feast day is observed on .[1][2]

Sisoës was an Egyptian by birth. Having withdrawn the world from his youth, he retired to the desert of Sceté, and lived some time under the direction of abbot Hor. The desire of finding a retreat yet more unfrequented induced him to cross the Nile and hide himself in the mountain where St. Anthony the Great died some time before.
