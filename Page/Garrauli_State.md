GARRAULI (also GARROULI; Hindi Name गर्रौली) is a fort and former Rajput princely state in present Madhya Pradesh, central India.


History

Garrauli became a princely state in 1812, when a sanad (feudal deed) from the British Government was granted to its first Diwan Bahadur, Gopal Singh, second son of Thakur Bhagwant Singh of Mahewa ?jagir, eight generation of that branch of the Hindu Bundela dynasty of Orcha.

The state maintained a military force of 2 cavalry, 56 infantry and 4 guns. The founder and his succeeding descendants bore the style Diwan Sahib or Diwan Bahadur.

Garrauli was a non-salute state, in the charge of the colonial Bundelkhand Agency. It had a population of 5,231 in 1901, a revenue of 25,000 Rupees and surface of 101 km2. It ceased to exist de facto when the states were seized in 1947, and formally on 3 March 1948 by accession to India. The privy purse was fixed at 34,000 Rupees.
