"SHTIL, DI NAKHT IZ OYSGESHTERNT"[1] (_Quiet, the Night is Full of Stars_)[2] or "PARTISANER LID" (_Partisan Song_)[3] is a Yiddish song written in summer 1942 by Hirsh Glick, a young Jewish inmate of the Vilna Ghetto.[4] It is set to a Russian folk melody.[5]

It is a love song that starts with conventional lyrics about a quiet night and sky full of stars, but quickly turns to the realities of war.[6] The song is addressed to a beautiful woman who succeeded in ambushing a Nazi convoy.[7] The song celebrates Vitka Kempner, a Jewish partisan, and her successful attack, an act of sabotage, on a German train in the Vilnius sector.[8] It was the first attack by the Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye (FPO), organization of Jewish partisans from the Vilna Ghetto.[9] Kempner and Itzik Matskevich threw a hand grenade at the convoy damaging it.[10]

The snow and frost mentioned in the lyrics are poetic liberties as the attack occurred in summer 1942.[11] The song is noted for its celebration of a woman partisan – active fighting and resistance were not traditional roles for a woman, even during the war.[12][13] Ruth Rubin also noted the use of three words – shpayer (local word from Vilnius), nagan (Russian term referring to Nagant M1895), pistoyl (German term) – to denote an automatic pistol. Perhaps this was meant to show multiculturalism of the region.[14]
