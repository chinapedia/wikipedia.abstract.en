The restaurant was established in 1987 in Chicago's River North neighborhood, in the former Chicago Varnish Company Building, by a partnership between popular Chicago Cubs broadcaster Harry Caray and restaurateur Grant DePorter.[1] It has alternately been described by writers as "famed"[2] and "legendary".[3]

Harry Caray's fare includes steaks as well as pastas, salads, and seafood. They have a total of seven locations throughout the Chicago area, including one seafood restaurant named Harry Caray's Holy Mackerel. The original location contains a large array of sports and Cubs memorabilia.[4]
