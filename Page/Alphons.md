ALPHONS (Latinized _Alphonsus, Adelphonsus, Adefonsus_) is a male given name recorded from the 8th century (Alfonso I of Asturias, r. 739-757) in the Christian successor states of the Visigothic kingdom in the Iberian peninsula. In the later medieval period it became a standard name in the Hispanic and Portuguese royal families.

It is derived from a Gothic name, or a conflation of several Gothic names; from _*Aþalfuns_, composed of the elements _aþal_ "noble" and _funs_ "eager, brave, ready", and perhaps influenced by names such as _*Alafuns_, _*Adefuns_ and _*Hildefuns_. It is recorded as _Adefonsus_ in the 9th and 10th century,[1] and as _Adelfonsus_, _Adelphonsus_ in the 10th to 11th. The reduced form _Alfonso_ is recorded in the late 9th century, and the Portuguese form _Afonso_ from the early 11th.[2] [3]

Variants of the name include: _Alfonso_ (Spanish and Italian), _Alfons_ (Dutch, German, Catalan, Polish and Scandinavian), _Afonso_ (Portuguese), _Alphonse_, _Alfonse_ (Italian, French and English), etc.
