Career

On 23 September 2011, Bille August announced that he had opened his studio in Hangzhou, China and taken a position as Tianpeng Media's Art Director, aiming to produce Chinese films for Tianpeng Media over the next few years. Tianpeng Media is a new media company established in 2010. The company so far has produced two films, _The Women Knight of Mirror_ (竞雄女侠秋瑾) and _The Years of Qi Xiao Fu_ (七小福之燃情岁月), which will be released later this year. Bille is the first foreign director to be hired by the Chinese film company. Recently, August also accepted the invitation from the Hangzhou government to serve as a "culture consultant" for the city.[1]

His 2013 film _Night Train to Lisbon_ premiered out of competition at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival.[2] He had planned to direct a _Gianni Versace_ biopic with Antonio Banderas as Versace, but this project was cancelled.[3][4]
