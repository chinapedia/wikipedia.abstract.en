Plot

In 1960, Jeannette and Jerry Brinson have recently moved to Great Falls, Montana with their teenage son Joe. Tensions build after Jerry is fired from a job as a golf pro at a country club. He is offered his old job back but refuses out of pride, and instead of looking for work, he sleeps in his car and watches the local firefighting efforts against a forest fire raging in nearby mountains. To support the family as Jerry looks for a job, Jeannette takes a job as a swimming instructor, while Joe works at a local photography studio. One day, Jerry decides to take a low-paying job fighting the forest fire, which upsets Jeannette and worries Joe. Jeannette speaks openly about her strained marriage with Jerry to Joe, and the stress of the situation takes a minor toll on Joe's school life.

While Jerry is away, Jeannette becomes romantically involved with one of her students, Warren Miller, a prosperous older man who owns an automobile dealership. Joe is repeatedly left alone as Jeannette spends time with Miller, initially under the guise of being employed by him, and Jeannette opens up about her dissatisfaction and restlessness. One night, after a dinner hosted by Miller, Miller dances with a drunken Jeannette and kisses her; he spends the night at Joe's house, which a shocked Joe discovers later that night. After Miller leaves, Joe confronts Jeannette about the affair. Jeannette does not admit to caring about Miller or no longer loving Jerry, but concedes that the affair will make their life financially better, and she implores Joe to think of a better plan for her. He tells her that he cannot.

Jerry returns and is met with a lukewarm reception by Jeannette, who reveals that she has begun renting an apartment in town, and Joe is free to stay with her. Devastated and suspecting an affair, Jerry gets Joe to admit to her relationship. Furious upon hearing that Miller slept with Jeannette in the family house, Jerry drunkenly goes to Miller's house and tries to set it ablaze. Miller catches him in the act and confronts him, admonishing him about his behavior with Joe present. When an injured Jerry pleads with Joe to help him escape before the police arrive, Joe flees on foot to the police station, where he discovers his father has not been arrested. Returning to the house, he learns from Jerry that Miller will not press charges, but his parents' marriage is over.

Jeannette moves to Portland, Oregon to teach, while Joe lives peacefully with Jerry, who has become a successful salesman. Jeannette returns spontaneously one weekend to a strained, but polite, reunion, where she learns Joe has been promoted and is on the honor roll. Joe takes his parents to the photography studio, where he requests that they take a family portrait for his sake. An uncomfortable Jeannette is initially reluctant, but accepts, and the family takes one final portrait together.

I have always wanted to make films—and have always known I would make films about family."[3] He has also said that this is the first in a series of films he wants to make about dysfunctional families.[4] The film was produced by June Pictures and Nine Stories Productions.[5]

In September 2016, it was announced that Jake Gyllenhaal and Carey Mulligan would star in the film.[6] American composer David Lang wrote the score.

Filming

Reception

Critical response

On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on 176 reviews, and an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "_Wildlife_'s portrait of a family in crisis is beautifully composed by director Paul Dano -- and brought brilliantly to life by a career-best performance from Carey Mulligan."[17] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on reviews from 41 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[18]

_New York Times_ critic Glenn Kenny called _Wildlife_ a "superb film," calling it "a domestic drama both sad and terrifying." Kenny praised the cast for "exceptional" acting, and said that Mulligan "gives the best performance of any I’ve seen in film this year." He called Oxenbould "an exciting find" and stated of Dano's direction as "meticulous in every respect, which enables him to keep the characters at a remove that is both cleareyed and compassionate. The sharp cinematography by Diego Garcia is ideal for Dano’s purpose. The whole of the film is a potent collaboration in every respect, and a remarkable directorial debut".[19]

Writing for _RogerEbert.com_, Brian Tallerico gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying, "This is an accomplished, moving piece of filmmaking, one that cares about its characters and trusts its performers. It comes from a relatively old school of dramatic storytelling but it connects emotionally because of Dano’s tender but confident work and what he’s able to draw from two of the best performers of their generation."[20] _Variety_'s Owen Gleiberman called Dano "a natural-born filmmaker, with an eye for elegant spare compositions that refrain from being too showy" and gave the film 4 out of 5 stars.[21]

David Edelstein, writing for _Vulture_ gave the film full marks, calling the film "superb", saying "[Dano] gives his actors space so that the rhythms are their own, and they hold us through the tough final scenes and bittersweet ending."[22] _The Guardian_'s Jordan Hoffman gave the film three stars out of five, saying "It is a quiet, subtle story and, as is so often the case when an actor takes their first trip behind the camera, a showcase for terrific performances."[23]

Accolades

The film was nominated for three Independent Spirit Awards Dano for Best First Feature, Mulligan for Best Female Lead, and Garcia for Best Cinematography.[24]
