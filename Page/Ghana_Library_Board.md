The GHANA LIBRARY AUTHORITY, established in 1950, was the first national library service in sub-Saharan Africa.[1]

The Authority was established by the 1949 Gold Coast Library Ordinance. It assumed responsibility for the Aglionby Library, which had been started by John Aglionby, the Anglican bishop of Accra, and the British Council's mobile library service. It served as a model for other public library services in Africa. The Authority is currently headed by Ghanaian Social Entrepreneur, Hayford Siaw who was appointed by President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo [2]
