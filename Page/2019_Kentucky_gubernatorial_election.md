The 2019 KENTUCKY GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION will take place on November 5 to choose the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky. Three slates will be on the ballot:[1]

-   Matt Bevin, Republican, incumbent, running with Ralph Alvarado for Lieutenant Governor.
-   Andy Beshear, Democrat, running with Jaqueline Coleman for Lieutenant Governor.
-   John Hicks, Libertarian, running with Ann Cormican for Lieutenant Governor.

Major-party primary elections occurred on May 21, 2019.[2] Incumbent Republican Governor Matt Bevin was renominated by the Republican Party, and Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear won the Democratic nomination.[3]

Bevin announced on January 25, 2019, that he would run for a second term, choosing State Senator Ralph Alvarado as his running mate over current Lieutenant Governor Jenean Hampton.[4] Since the state's constitutional prohibition of governors serving consecutive terms was repealed in 1992, no Republican Governor of Kentucky has ever been elected to consecutive terms. The only Republican to run for reelection, Ernie Fletcher, was defeated by Democrat Steve Beshear in 2007.
