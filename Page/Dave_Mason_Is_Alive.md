_DAVE MASON IS ALIVE_ is an album of live recordings by Dave Mason. Recorded in 1971 at the Troubadour club in Los Angeles, the album was released in 1973 by Blue Thumb Records. It has been re-released by MCA Coral (MCA 713).


Background

As reported by William Ruhlmann of AllMusic, the album was released without Mason's approval.[1] Its release by Blue Thumb was prompted by the dispute between it and Mason, a dispute that started midway during the recording of Mason's previous album. That previous album, _Headkeeper_, had been intended to be a double album, with one disk composed of live recordings made at the Troubador and the other of studio recordings. But after Mason ceased work and took possession of some of the studio masters, Blue Thumb released _Headkeeper_ as a single album, one side live and one side studio recordings. As the dispute with Mason continued, Blue Thumb issued _Dave Mason Is Alive_, composed entirely of recordings from the same live performance that had been used for _Headkeeper_. Of the seven tracks on _Alive_, two of them, "Feelin' Alright" and "Just a Song", are repeated from _Headkeeper_.[2][3]
