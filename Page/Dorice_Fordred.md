DORICE FORDRED (25 November 1902 – 4 August 1980) was a South African actress, best known for character parts and Shakespearean roles on the London stage.[1] The _Brooklyn Daily Eagle_ commented in 1931, "She is one of those rare things, a young and attractive character actress."[2]


Early life

Dorice Fordred was born and raised near Port Elizabeth, South Africa. She went to England to study theatre. "Living on the veldt gives you – you can't help it, no matter who you are – a susceptibility to simple, earthy rhythms," she explained to an American interviewer in 1931.[3]
