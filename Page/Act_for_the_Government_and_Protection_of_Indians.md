The ACT FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND PROTECTION OF INDIANS (Chapter 133, Cal. Stats., April 22, 1850) was enacted by the first session of the California State Legislature.[1]

The act "facilitated removing California Indians from their traditional lands, separating at least a generation of children and adults from their families, languages, and cultures (1850 to 1865). This California law provided for "apprenticing" or indenturing Indian children and adults to Whites, and also punished "vagrant" Indians by "hiring" them out to the highest bidder at a public auction if the Indian could not provide sufficient bond or bail."[2] It was amended in 1860.[3] Although the California legislature repealed parts of the statute after the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished involuntary servitude,[4] it was not repealed in its entirety until 1937.[5]

The Act for the Government and Protection of Indians is in line with other laws passed in the state of California during this time, such as the Greaser Act in 1855 and the Foreign Miners' Tax Act of 1850 (repealed in 1851 and reinstated in 1852). [6][7]
