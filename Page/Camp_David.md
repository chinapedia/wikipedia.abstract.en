CAMP DAVID is the country retreat for the president of the United States. It is located in the wooded hills of Catoctin Mountain Park near Thurmont, Maryland, also near Emmitsburg, Maryland about 62 miles (100 km) north-northwest of Washington, D.C.[1][2][3] It is officially known as the NAVAL SUPPORT FACILITY THURMONT, because it is technically a military installation, the staffing is primarily provided by the Seabees, CEC, and Marines of the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps.

Originally known as Hi-Catoctin, Camp David was built as a camp for federal government agents and their families by the Works Progress Administration. Construction started in 1935 and was completed in 1938.[4] In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt converted it to a presidential retreat and renamed it "SHANGRI-LA" (for the fictional Himalayan paradise in the 1933 novel _Lost Horizon_ by British author James Hilton, which he had jokingly referenced as the source of the Doolittle Raid earlier that year). Camp David received its present name from Dwight D. Eisenhower, in honor of his father and grandson, both named David.[5]

The Catoctin Mountain Park does not indicate the location of Camp David on park maps due to privacy and security concerns, although it can be seen through the use of publicly accessible satellite images.[6]


Presidential use

-   Franklin D. Roosevelt hosted Sir Winston Churchill in May 1943.[7]
-   Dwight Eisenhower held his first cabinet meeting there on November 22, 1955 following hospitalization and convalescence he required after a heart attack suffered in Denver, Colorado on September 24.[8] Eisenhower met there with Nikita Khrushchev for two days of discussions in September 1959.[9]
-   John F. Kennedy and his family often enjoyed riding and other recreational activities there, and Kennedy often allowed White House staff and Cabinet members to use the retreat when he or his family were not there.
-   Lyndon B. Johnson met with advisors in this setting and hosted both Australian prime minister Harold Holt and Canadian prime minister Lester B. Pearson there.[10]
-   Richard Nixon was a frequent visitor. He personally directed the construction of a swimming pool and other improvements to Aspen Lodge.[11]
-   Gerald Ford often rode his snowmobile around Camp David and hosted Indonesian President Suharto there.[12]
-   Jimmy Carter initially favored closing Camp David in order to save money. Once Carter actually visited the place, he decided to keep it.[13] Carter brokered the Camp David Accords there in September 1978 between Egyptian president Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin.[14]
-   Ronald Reagan visited the retreat more than any other president.[15] In 1984, Reagan hosted British prime minister Margaret Thatcher.[16]
-   George H. W. Bush's daughter, Dorothy Bush Koch, was married there in 1992, in the first ever wedding held at Camp David.[17]
-   During Bill Clinton's time in office, British prime minister Tony Blair was among the many visitors that the president hosted at Camp David.[18] He also held the Camp David Accords between Israel and Palestine.
-   George W. Bush hosted dignitaries, including President of Russia Vladimir Putin, there in 2003,[19][20] and hosted British prime minister Gordon Brown, in 2007.[21] George W. Bush also hosted Danish prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen in June 2006.[22]
-   Barack Obama chose Camp David to host the 38th G8 summit in 2012.[23] President Obama also hosted Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev at Camp David,[24] as well as the GCC Summit there in 2015.[25]
-   President Donald Trump hosted congressional leaders at Camp David as Republicans prepared to defend both houses of Congress in the 2018 midterm elections. The summit at the presidential mountain retreat in Maryland came weeks after the White House and the GOP-controlled Congress scored their first major legislative victory of the year with tax reform.[26]


Security issues

On July 2, 2011, an F-15 intercepted a small two-seat passenger plane flying near Camp David, when President Obama was in the residence. The civilian aircraft, which was out of radio communication, was intercepted approximately from the presidential retreat. The F-15 escorted the aircraft out of the area, and it landed in nearby Hagerstown, Maryland, without incident. The civilian plane's occupants were flying between two Maryland towns and were released without charge.[27]

On July 10, 2011, an F-15 intercepted another small two-seat passenger plane flying near Camp David when Obama was again in the residence; a total of three planes were intercepted over that July 9 weekend.[28]
