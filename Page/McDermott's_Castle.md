MCDERMOTT'S CASTLE is a castle and National Monument located in County Roscommon, Ireland.[1]


Location

McDermott's Castle is located on Castle Island, an island of 0.23 ha (0.57 ac) in the southeast corner of Lough Key.[2]


History

The Mac Diarmada were the ruling dynasty of Magh Luirg (Moylurg; northeast Connacht) from the 10th to 16th centuries. A castle stood on this island from the 12th century: in 1184, the _Annals of Loch Cé_ report that a lightning bolt caused a fire:

A rebuilt castle featured in the final part of the 1235 conquest of Connacht by Richard Mór de Burgh, 1st Baron of Connaught. The castle came under siege, first by a raft-mounted catapult, and then by fire ships. Cormac MacDermott, King of Moylurg, was forced to surrender.

A poem addressed to Tomaltach an Einigh mac Diarmata (King of Moylurg 1421–58) tells the story of the Hag of Lough Key who used (or abused) Cormac MacDermott's (king 1218–44) hospitality by staying on the Rock for a full year, and laid upon the McDermotts the obligation of perpetual hospitality.

The McDermotts lost the island in 1586. Eochaidh Ó hÉoghusa wrote a poem lamenting the castle's emptiness.[3]

In 2014, the island and castle featured in an episode of sitcom _Moone Boy_, as the residence of the mysterious "Island Joe."

In 2018, the castle was put up for sale for £80,000.[4]


Building

Castle_Island_in_Lough_Key_Forest_Park.jpg Isaac Weld, writing in 1832, describes as part of "the castle proper" two rooms, one above the other, each 36 × 22 feet (11 × 7 m), with walls 7½ feet (2.2 m) thick. It is not clear whether this refers to part of the original castle, or the later construction.

Currently a folly castle built c. 1800 by the King family stands on the island. It was built as a summer house and burned down during the Second World War.[5][6]
