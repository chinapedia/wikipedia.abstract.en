Forum on Religion and Ecology

Speaking at that event were such luminaries as Tim Wirth (former senator from Colorado and President of the UN Foundation), Tu Weiming (of Harvard and Peking University), Maurice Strong (former Under-Secretary-General of the U.N.), and Bill Moyers (PBS journalist)[17]

Grim also frequently speaks and gives interviews on religion and ecology and issues of ecological importance, such as Laudato Si' (the Papal Encyclical on the environment)[18][19][20] and Standing Rock/DAPL.[21]
