6 GEMINORUM is a variable star in the zodiac constellation of Gemini, located roughly 5,000 light years away from the Sun.[1] It has the variable star designation BU GEMINORUM; _6 Geminorum_ is the Flamsteed designation. At its brightest this reddish hued star is barely visible to the naked eye but is readily visible with binoculars, found southwest of M 35, below WY Geminorum. It is moving further from the Earth with a heliocentric radial velocity of +27 km/s.[2] The star is a member of the Gemini OB1 association.[3]

This is an evolved red supergiant with a stellar classification of M1-2 Ia-Iab.[4] It is a semiregular variable star, ranging from visual magnitude +5.7 down to +7.5 over a period of 325 days. It has been given the sub-classification of Lc, which means "Irregular variable supergiants of late spectral types having amplitudes of about 1 mag. in V.O".[5] The star has expanded to 670[6] times the Sun's radius and is radiating 86,000[7] times the luminosity of the Sun from its swollen photosphere at an effective temperature of 3,789 K.[8]
