SIR FREDERICK THOMAS GEORGE HOBDAY CMG FRSE PRCVS (4 November 1869 – 24 June 1939) was an innovative veterinary surgeon who served as President of the Royal Veterinary College 1927 to 1937. The college holds an annual lecture entitled the Frederick Hobday Memorial Address. He was the official veterinary surgeon to Queen Alexandra from 1912 to 1939.[1]

He made major advances to animal anaesthesia and to small animal surgery. He also invented a series of thermometers, specific to different animal types.[2]

The term "to hobday" a horse, meaning to remove its larynx to improve deep breathing during racing, stems from a practice created by Karl Adolf Gunther but refined by Hobday.[3]
