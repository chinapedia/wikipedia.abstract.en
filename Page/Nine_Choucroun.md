NINE CHOUCROUN, born FORTUNÉE SCHECROUN (October 6, 1896 – December 10, 1978) was a French biochemist. She was director of research at the Institut de biologie physico-chimique in Paris. She developed, _inter alia_, the electrophoresis.[1]


Biography

Collaborator of Jean Perrin, she became his partner after the death of his wife Henriette in 1938. She managed to board the ocean liner _Massilia_ that allowed them to escape with part of the French government in June 1940 to Casablanca, boarding later the _SS Excambion_ in December 1941, arriving in New York City on December 23, 1941.[2]


Nine-Choucroun Prize

Nine Choucroun wanted to encourage young researchers to research in the area, very wide, from the physico-chemical biology. The Nine Choucroun Prize, annual, was created in December 1980 by her heirs. The value of the prize until 2008 was €5,000 and has been raised to €8,000 in 2011. This prize, awarded under the auspices of the physico-chemical Biology Institute and the Edmond de Rothschild Foundation, is aimed at young researchers working in the field of physico-chemical biology.
