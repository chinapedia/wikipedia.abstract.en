The BRIGADÉR HALLING HOUSE is a listed property at Lille Strandstræde 14 in central Copenhagen, Denmark. It takes its name after William Halling, a Dane who acquired the building shortly after returning to Denmark from India where he had served in the British army. He was known as Brigadér Halling (Brigadér von Hallling) after he acquired the _Brigadér_ title in 1872. The building now houses the Maltese embassy.


History

William_Halling.png The building was originally built in the 1730s. The property was in 1772 acquired by William von Halling who had just returned from India where he had been in British military service. He altered and expanded the building in 1773 - 1776. It is believed that the architect was Hans Næss, a student of Nicolas-Henri Jardin. In 1774, he married Christine Linde Hvas de Lindenpalmm the only daughter of Jørgen Hvas de Lindenpalm. He received the two estates Tirsbæk and Bryckesborg as dowry, renaming the latter Willamsborg. [1] In 1776, he ceded Tirsbæk to count Caspar von Moltke in exchange for Dronninglund in Vendsyssel. Here later constructed a large town mansion in Aalborg (now Hotel Phønic).


Architecture

Lille_Strandstræde_16_-_courtyard.jpg Lille_Strandstræde_15_-_gate.jpg The four-bay median risilit and decorations on the facade date from the expansion of the building in 1773–76. The gate was not moved when the house was expanded and is therefore not placed in the centre of the building. This has been solved by placing the gate and an undecorated window in a slightly recessed portion of the median risilit.[2]


Today

The building now houses the Maltese embassy.
