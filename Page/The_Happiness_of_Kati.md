One day her grandmother asks Kati if she would like to go to visit her mother who is very ill, with Lou Gehrig's disease. She reveals that her mother has been suffering with this condition for many years.

Kati agrees and travels to the house near the sea to spend some time with her mother. During her stay there, she comes to learn why her mother sent her to her grandparents and discovers that she has to meet her father whom she never knew.

In a few days, Kati's mother passes away. After her funeral, Kati travels to her house in town where she finds boxes in which her mom had collected everything since the day Kati was born. She gets a letter from her Uncle Tong that has her father's address. After this everyone waits for Kati's decision of whether to send a letter to her father. She sends him a letter.
