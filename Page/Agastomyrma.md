_AGASTOMYRMA_ is an extinct genus of formicid in the ant subfamily Myrmicinae known from the fossil species _AGASTOMYRMA LATICEPS_ found in eastern Asia.


History and classification

_A. laticeps_ is known from a single queen ant found in Russia.[1] The specimen was described from a compression fossil preserved in diatomite deposits of the Bol’shaya Svetlovodnaya site. The site is exposed on the bank of Barachek Creek upstream from the creeks confluence with the Bol’shaya Svetlovodnaya River[2] in the Pozharsky District, on the Pacific Coast of Russia. The fossil-bearing rocks preserve possibly Priabonian plants and animals which lived in and around a small lake near a volcano. The site has been attributed to either the Maksimovka or Salibez Formations and compared to the Bembridge Marls and Florissant Formation, both of which are Priabonian in age.[3]

At the time of description, the part and counterpart holotype queen specimen, numbers PIN 3429/1178 and PIN 3429/1173, was preserved in the A. A. Borissiak Paleontological Institute collections, part of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The fossil was first described by the trio of paleomyrmecologists Gennady Dlussky, Alexandr Rasnitsyn and Ksenia Perfilieva. In the type description, Dlussky, Rasnitsyn and Perfilieva coined the genus name _Agastomyrma_ from a combination of the Latin _agastus_ which means "pleasing" and Greek _Myrmica_ meaning "ant". The specific epithet is derived the Latin _laticeps_ that translates to "with a wide head".[4]

_Agastomyrma_ is one of two extinct ant genera described by Dlussky _et al_ from Bol’shaya Svetlovodnaya fossils in the 2015 paper. The other genus _Biamomyrma_ is also a myrmicine, and differs from _Agastomyrma_ in the structuring of the petiole and in the relative sizing of the queens head.[5]


Description

The _A. laticeps_ queen is preserved as a dorsal compression showing the upper surface of the head, thorax and abdomen, without fore-wings or antennae. The body length as preserved is estimated at , though portions of the head and the gaster are missing.[6] _A. laticeps_ is distinguished by the large size of the head relative to the body, the head being long while the mesosoma is . The head has rounded back corners and a straight back edge.[7]
