NORTH POINT STATE BATTLEFIELD is a publicly owned historic preserve in Dundalk, Baltimore County, Maryland, that commemorates a portion of the site where the Battle of North Point was fought during the War of 1812.[1] On September 12, 1814, Brigadier General John Stricker commanded forces of the Maryland Militia from within the park's borders. Stricker's men fought the invading British forces from behind a fenceline along the monument's eastern edge.[2]

The site opened to the public in 2015. Park features include wetlands, permeable parking and trail surfaces, boardwalks, and wildflower meadows. It is a satellite facility of North Point State Park, managed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.[3]
