_STAGEBILL_ was a monthly U.S. magazine for theatregoers. Most copies of the publication were printed for particular productions and distributed at the door as the show's program. It was launched as a direct rival to the highly successful monthly _Playbill_. But after five years of head-to-head tough competition with _Playbill_, _Stagebill_ became insolvent and was acquired by its rival who also kept the _Stagebill_ trademark.[1]


History

_Stagebill_ was launched as a direct competition to _Playbill_, a highly successful publication. _Playbill_ concentrated on Broadway and Off-Broadway theaters, while _Stagebill_ positioned itself as a publication focused on concerts, opera, and dance in venues such as Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall.[2][3]

B&B Enterprises, Inc. acquired _Stagebill_ in 1969.[4] The company owned the magazine until 1994 when it was acquired by K-III Communications based in New York City.[5][6] In the 1990s Shira Kalish was the publisher of the magazine.[7] She was succeeded by Darcy Miller Donaldson in the post.[8]

However, by the late 1990s, _Playbill_ was extremely profitable; _Stagebill_ was not, losing millions of dollars annually by 1998.[9] To increase revenue, _Stagebill_ entered _Playbill_{{'}}s turf. Its first major attempt was in 1995 when The Public Theater defected to _Stagebill_. A bigger rift came in 1997, when Disney contracted _Stagebill_ for its big musical production _The Lion King_ at the newly reopened New Amsterdam Theatre.[10] The main point of contention in the latter case was control over advertising content: _Playbill_ is distributed free to theaters, relying on advertising revenue that is completely under its authority, whereas per company policy; Disney required a program without cigarette or liquor ads.[11] In response to _Stagebill's_ upstart incursion, _Playbill_ began to produce _Showbill_, a sister publication that conformed to Disney's advertising requirements for all publications distributed in its properties.[12] _Playbill_ responded further by producing publications for classic arts venues, aggressively courting many venues that were once _Stagebill_ clients like the Metropolitan Opera, the Carnegie Hall and the New York Philharmonic.[13]

With a more aggressive policy of acquiring publicity for more performing arts venues, _Playbill_ broke from its typical format and began publishing completely customized programs in the vein of _Stagebill._[14] This coupled with continuing fiscal troubles of _Stagebill_ signaled the end of it as a publishing entity. _Stagebill_ became insolvent in Summer 2002[15] and in September 2002 it was acquired by its rival _Playbill_ who also kept the _Stagebill_ trademark.[16]
