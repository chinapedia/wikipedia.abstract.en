HUSSAIN SAEED ALNAHDI was a 24-year-old University of Wisconsin–Stout student from Sharurah, Saudi Arabia, majoring in Business Administration, who was murdered in Menomonie, in Dunn County, Wisconsin, United States, in 2016.[1][2][3][4][5]

Alnahdi was attacked, beaten and left unconscious[6] outside a pizza restaurant on Main Street East in downtown Menomonie at about 2am on Sunday 30 October 2016.[7] He died from his injuries the following day, Monday 31 October,[8] at the Mayo Clinic in Eau Claire, having been taken there by helicopter from the Mayo Clinic Health System in Menomonie.[9]

His body was laid to rest on 7 November in Sharurah, Saudi Arabia.[10]

A reward of $20,000 has been offered for information leading to the arrest of his killer.[11]

On 18 November, police in Menomonie announced that they had identified a suspect for the killing, and that there was no evidence that it was a hate crime.[12] On 22 November, they recommended to the Dunn County district attorney’s office that the suspect be charged with felony murder and substantial battery.[13] The suspect, whose name was not given, was said to neither be a student of the University nor a resident of Dunn County.[14]

On January 13, 2017, Cullen Osburn was charged with murder of Hussain[15] and an April 2018 trial has been scheduled[16]

The Consulate of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in Houston has appointed a lawyer to handle all procedural, security, and judicial aspects of this case.[17]
