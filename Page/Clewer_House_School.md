CLEWER HOUSE SCHOOL was a 19th-century grammar school in Clewer, Windsor, Berkshire for boys.[1]

Clewer House was a manor house built _c._ 1795. In the early 1800s the house was occupied by John Ramsbottom (1778–1845), who served as MP for Windsor from 1810 to 1845 and moved to Old Windsor _c._ 1835.[2]

The school was founded in 1839[3] by Rev. William Redford Harris, a magistrate in Windsor who became the town's mayor in 1864. The school had an excellent academic reputation for a number of decades but was closed down around the turn of the 19th century.[4]
