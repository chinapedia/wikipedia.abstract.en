PAGIRINYA REFUGEE SETTLEMENT is a refugee camp in eastern Adjumani District in Northern Uganda. It is (as of October 2016) the newest of Uganda's refugee settlements, launched in June 2016 after the Maaji Refugee Settlements reached capacity.

A cholera outbreak hit Pagirinya soon after it opened. [1]
