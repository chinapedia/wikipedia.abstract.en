DOBSON'S MILL is a working tower windmill for grinding wheat and corn which stands in the High Street in the village of Burgh-le-Marsh, near Skegness in Lincolnshire, England. The mill is open to the public as a tourist attraction and is a Grade I listed building.[1] The mill site also houses the Burgh-le-Marsh Heritage Centre.

The windmill was built and fitted out by Sam Oxley, an Alford millwright, in the early 1800s for the Jessop family, who baked bread on the same site. It was completed by 1844. Dobson was the name of the last miller.

The mill is built in five storeys of tarred brick and fitted with five sails, unusual in that they turn clockwise, driving three sets of millstones (two pairs of grey stones and one pair of French) in an anti-clockwise direction. There is a blocked opening on the ground floor where a steam traction engine used to power an extra set of millstones.

The mill was purchased by the local Council in the 1960s and refurbished, including the installation of a new cap and sails, in 2014.
