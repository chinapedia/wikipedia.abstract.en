ALFRED PARK is a small (8.4 ha) wetland swamp forest in New Germany, Durban, South Africa.[1][2] It is managed by the Ethekwini Municipality.[3]

The park is noted for its frog population, including reed frogs, various tree frogs, and the rare argus reed frog.[4] There are picnic areas and self-guided trails in the park.[5]

The park is currently under threat from alien invasive species, especially the Pickerel weed, which has impacted the frog population.[6]
