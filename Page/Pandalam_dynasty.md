PANDALAM DYNASTY (Malayalam:പന്തളം രാജവംശം) a royal dynasty emerged from a branch of pandya kingdom which existed in Kerala during the Kollam era. They came to Kerala fearing the assault of a ruler. In Kerala they were given land and status by Kaipuzha Thampan (Kunjunni Varma Thampan of Nilambur Kovilakam a landlord who lived in Amanthur Palace at Kaipuzha from Kottayam Kerala.


Early history

The Pandya Kingdom of Tamilakam was once attacked by Malik Kafur, the commander-in-chief of Alauddin Khalji of Khalji dynasty. Upon the failure of Pandiya rajas, two branches of this dynasty fled towards west (Kerala) to secure themselves from the attacks. One branch proceeded via the Western Ghats mountainous regions and settled in Poonjar in Kottayam and established the Poonjar kingdom. The other branch (_Chembazhannur_) wandered through several places ghatsand facing lots of difficulties finally settled in Pandalam.[1] The fleeing Chembazhannur branch at first settled in Valliyur (near Tirunelveli) and enjoyed a privileged position in the society.[2] Later due to the threats of invasion, the royal family shifted to Tenkasi. Thirumalai Nayak(Naykan), a famed ruler of Madurai wished to see his daughter's marriage with a prince of Chembazhannur family. But upon the rejection of marriage proposal, Nayak became an enemy of Pandiyas. He made huge damages in Tenkasi with his strong _Maravappada_ (army). Knowing that they couldn't continue a peaceful life in Tenkasi, the family moved to a place named _Elathoor maniyam_ and procured the mountainous regions near Puliyankudi. But Nayak continued to torture the royal family which forced them to proceed towards west (Kerala) via places such as Achankovil, Aryankavu, Kulathupuzha and settled in Konni by c. 79 ME, which was according to the Copper deed issued by the Venad raja. The family constructed a shrine for lord Shiva in Konni (Muringamangalam Sreemahadevar Temple) for their daily worships. This temple is one of the most noted contributions of Chembazhanuur family in Kerala.[3] A number of Mutts, Manas and Koyikkalls were also constructed by the family. The local people fed up with the activities of thieves accepted the family as the ruling class which was named as _Chembazhanji kovilakom_. Attacks on Travancore by Cholas forced the family to flee Konni and then to settle down in Pandalam which became their permanent capital. A full-fledged kingdom was established by around  ME (1194 CE) by obtaining the land from Kunjunni Varma Thampan (Kaipuzha Thampan) of Amanthur Kovilakam at Kaipuzha and the local ruler and landlord of the region. The Venad ruler also played a great role in the establishment of this kingdom.[4] People enjoyed a peaceful atmosphere and ideal life under the Pandalam rulers. As of the Travancore state manual, Pandalam kingdom kept friendly relations with the rajas of Travancore. Relation between Kaipuzha Thampan and Maharaja of Travancore was extremely cordial.Pandhalam Raja establishd a good relation with Maharaj of Travancore through Kunjunni Varma Thampan who was the close friend, advisory of Maharaja of Travancore.

The territories of Pandalam kingdom extended to an area of which covered the parts of Konni, Achankovil, Tenkasi and the forest regions of Sabarimala, the abode of Ayyayppa. During 345 ME, Aadhichavarman a Venad ruler had given a sizable portion of land to this kingdom. Marthanda Varma, the famed Venad ruler and establisher of Travancore kingdom (925 ME) was named for his annexation policies. But on his conquests in Central Travancore, Pandalam was left independent and wasn't annexed to his domain. This was primarily due to cordial relations that Travancore had with Pandalam and of the assistance by the royal family in the Kayamkulam conquest of Varma. Pandalam was forced to give a big amount of Rs.2,20,001 to Travancore government towards the cost of wars after Tippus conquest in Malabar coast during 965 ME. The amount was paid in various installments. During 969 ME, the income from Sabarimala temple was used to pay as installments by a ruler of Pandalam. By 995 ME, the raja of Travancore made an agreement with the Pandalam king assuring that they would support every member of the royal family if they were allowed to collect revenue from Pandalam. Upon the acceptance of this offer, the kingdom of Pandalam was merged with Travancore and a monthly pension was issued for each royal family member. The administrative rights of temples including Sabarimala within the premises of kingdom was transferred to the Travancore government and later to Travancore devaswom board. Before the formation of Pathanamthitta district, Pandalam was a part of the Mavelikkara taluk of Alappuzha district.


Legend about the relationship with Ayyappa

ശബരിമല_ക്ഷേത്രം.JPG]]

It is believed that the royal family of Pandalam belonged to the _Bhargava gotra_ while other royal families in Kerala were included in the _Viswamitra gotra_. The kingdom is famed for its kinship with Ayyappa, the son of Harihara (the fusion of Shiva and Vishnu). Raja Rajasekhara, a king of this dynasty during his hunting expedition heard the crying of a baby near the banks of Pamba. The raja found a glorious looking infant wearing a bead in his neck and surrounded by a halo. The childless raja was doubted whether to take the child with him. But Sage Agastya arrived there and cleared his doubts by telling him that the child is a boon from the Gods and advised him to accept him. He was named _Manikanta_ (_Mani_ means bead and _Kanta_ being the neck). He was given proper education in gurukulam Later Rani gave birth to a son but raja considered Manikanta as his elder son and decided to crown him as _Yuvaraja_ of Pandalam.[5]

Manikanta was not willing to take up the throne as he was destined to crush evil. A greedy minister in the court misled the rani of the palace and partake in his scheme against Manikanta. Following the words of the minister, the rani pretended to be affected by a severe stomachache. The bribed royal physician prescribed the milk of leopard as the only cure for this ache. The king was quite sure that none of the royal servants could complete the mission of obtaining milk from a leopard, but Manikanta agreed to go deep into the forests to fetch it. In the forests, Manikanta would come to fight and vanquish the demoness Mahishi. On the very next day, he arrived at the palace riding a tiger followed by a group of cubs. Realizing that Manikanta was not an ordinary being, the members of the palace began praising him by calling him _Ayyane_ and _Appane_, from which the name "Ayyappa" originated. As his mission of slaying the demoness Mahishi was fulfilled, Manikanta determined that he should leave the palace, not before instructing the raja to construct a shrine at Sabarimala where he would be presiding to bless thousands of devotees. He blessed everyone who assembled there once this was done and vanished forever.[6]

The above verses show the relationship of Lord Ayyappa with the Pandiya kingdom. He is often depicted as the _Thilak_ (a mark on the forehead) of the Pandiya vamsa and the beloved deity of Kerala nadu.[7]
