STAT (stylized STAT, sometimes also called STAT NEWS)[1] is a health-oriented news website launched on November 4, 2015 by John W. Henry, the owner of _The Boston Globe_. It is produced by Boston Globe Media and is headquartered in the _Globe_{{'}}s own building in Boston.[2][3] Its executive editor is Rick Berke, who formerly worked at both _The New York Times_ and _Politico_.[4] According to Kelsey Sutton of _Politico_, the website is Henry's "biggest and most ambitious standalone site yet".[5] The site's name comes from the term "stat," short for _statim_, or "immediately"â€”a term that has long been used in medical contexts.

As of February 2016, it had 45 staff members.[6]


Impact

Notable stories Stat has broken include one about Robert Califf's research, published after then-President of the United States Barack Obama announced he would be his nominee to lead the Food and Drug Administration. The site also uncovered claims made by a vitamin company to which President Donald Trump had licensed his name. The site's reporting has also inspired another presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, to return a contribution that a disgraced former pharmaceutical industry CEO made to his campaign.[7] The site has also sent multiple journalists to Colombia, Haiti, and Brazil to cover the zika outbreaks there.[8][9]
