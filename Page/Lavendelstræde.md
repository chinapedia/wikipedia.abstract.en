Lavendelstræde_cph.jpg LAVENDELSTRÆDE (lit. "Lavender Street") is a street in the old town of Copenhagen, Denmark). It runs from Kattesundet-Hestemøllestræde in the northeast to Vester Voldgade in the west, linking Slutterigade and Nytorv and at Regnbuepladsen and Copenhagen City Hall in the southwest.


History

Lucie_Mølle_Gyldenløves_Bastion.jpg The street received its name in 1609. It from the area close to the city's central square Gammeltorv to the Gyldenløve Bastion of the West Rampart which followed present-day Vester Voldgade. The name of the street probably refers to the lavender that grew in a small group of herb gardens located next to the rampart.

The street was completely destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. It buildings were rebuilt over the next few years, and a new combined townhall and courthouse was built at its beginning, fronting Nytorv.

On the Gyldenløve Bastion stood a stub mill, St. Lucy's Windmill (_Sankt Lucie Mølle_), which was also known as Lavendelstræde Windmill (_Lavendelstræde Mølle_) after the street. The rampart survived until 1885. The windmill was dismantled and rebuilt at Enghavevej.
