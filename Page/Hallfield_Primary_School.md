HALLFIELD PRIMARY SCHOOL is a two form entry infant and junior primary school housed in a building of architectural distinction. It is a grade II* listed building in Inverness Terrace, Paddington, London, built in 1953â€“55 and designed by Denys Lasdun.[1][2]


Architectural history

The original school designed by Denys Lasdun in the 1950s had become overcrowded by the 1970s. In 2005, new funding allowed two new buildings designed by Caruso St John to be added. These were a RIBA Award Winner in 2006.[3]


School ethos

HALLFIELD PRIMARY SCHOOL claims in its prospectus that it "is building a community that places children firmly at the heart of education, instilling a life time love of learning by personalising the learning journey." [4]
