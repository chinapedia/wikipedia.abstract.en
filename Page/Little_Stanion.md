LITTLE STANION is designated by Corby Borough Council as a “committed new village”. It is situated in Northamptonshire on the edge of Rockingham Forest, 1.1 miles (1.82 km) southeast from the centre of Corby[1] and 7 miles from Kettering. It is a village under construction which, as of October 2016, had 733 completed houses with current plans to build up to 970. The first houses were completed in 2008.

The village is within the parish of Stanion although the Borough Council is currently launching a Community Governance Review following the submission of a valid petition from residents requesting the establishment of a new independent parish council for the village. The review is expected to be completed by mid 2017.

The Little Stanion Village Association (LSVA) was established in 2011 to ensure that residents of the village had a central point to receive information, share their views and have their questions answered. LSVA has been very active since its inception arranging a number of community events and working closely with local organisations to promote the new village and protect its interests.

Little Stanion Primary School is a one-form entry school which opened in 2012. The school was assessed as “Good” by Ofsted in October 2015.
