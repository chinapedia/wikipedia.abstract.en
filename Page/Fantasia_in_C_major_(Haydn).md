FANTASIA IN C MAJOR, Hob. XVII/4, "_CAPRICCIO_", was written by Joseph Haydn. It is based on the Austrian folk song __ ("The farmer's wife has lost her cat").[1]

In March 1789, he wrote to the publishing company Artaria, saying, "In a moment of great good humour I have completed a new Capriccio for fortepiano, whose taste, singularity and special construction cannot fail to receive approval from connoisseurs and amateurs alike. In a single movement, rather long, but not particularly difficult."[2] The fact that Haydn wrote the fantasia "for connoisseurs and amateurs alike" was most likely a nod to C. P. E. Bach's _FÃ¼r Kenner und Liebhaber_ ("For Connoisseurs and Amateurs") that he had requested from Artaria the year before.[3] However, the piece was more difficult than Haydn thought it would be, with zany virtuosity and orchestral effects, recalling the last movement of his Sonata No. 48.[4]
