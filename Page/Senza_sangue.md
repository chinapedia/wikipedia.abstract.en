_SENZA SANGUE_ (Without blood) an opera in one act by Péter Eötvös with a libretto by Mari Mezei. It is based on the second part of the novel of the same name by Alessandro Baricco and is intended to be performed jointly with Béla Bartók's one-act _Bluebeard's Castle_.[1] The concert première was given by the Cologne Philharmonic Orchestra on 1 May 2015. It was premièred in full on 15 May 2016 at the Festival d'Avignon. It is his tenth opera.[2] Anne Sofie von Otter, who gave the New York première with the New York Philharmonic, said: "“The piece is not at all easy for the two singers... [It’s] hard to find the pitch; you have to work it into the voice, unless of course you happen to have perfect pitch, which I don’t."[3]


Synopsis

The opera is set in the time of a civil war in an unnamed country. A little girl called Nina experiences her family being killed in their home by fighters. Nina herself only survived because she was hiding. One of the murderers had traced her, but she was spared. The following years she spent in a kind of schizophrenic condition. During this time she gradually took revenge on all murderers except for her saviour. The opera itself is set many years later. Nina and Tito (her saviour) recall the terrible events of their childhood and reflect on the incomprehensibility of life.[4]
