NIGEL PAUL PATERSON is a British musician[1][2][3][4] Paterson began his career in the early 1960s, singing, playing the guitar, mandolin and tenor recorder[5] in the folk group The Halliard,[6][7][8][9][10] with Dave Moran and Nic Jones.

In 1971 Paterson graduated from Brentwood College of Education (Anglia Ruskin University) where he studied composition, harmony, counterpoint and orchestration with Harold Dexter and contemporary composers' working methods with Annea Lockwood. Paterson also studied classical guitar at Trinity College, London. After teaching for a few years, Paterson freelanced, playing the guitar,[11] arranging and composing for Chappell & Co., Boston Music (USA) and International Music Publications.[12] An original choral work _Here is the News_ received its first performance at The Royal Albert Hall on 18 May 1972 performed by The Southend Schools Music Association Junior Choir. Paterson was invited to conduct at The Royal Albert Hall three times between 1990 & 2000.[13]

Paterson returned to education in 1984 and became Head of Music at Valentines High School, a post he held until his retirement in 2004. In retirement, Nigel spends his time composing and playing the guitar for the occasional recording session. Several of Nigel's guitar music arrangements have been featured regularly on French, Spanish and Mexican television.[14] Nigel Paterson is a member of The British Music Writers Council, the Musicians Union and PRS for Music.
