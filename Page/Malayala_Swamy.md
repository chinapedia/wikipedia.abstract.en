MALAYALA SWAMY (1885â€“1962) was a Hindu religious leader, and a social reformer.[1][2] He dismissed the myth that Vedas and other scriptures are only for a particular section of the society and encouraged common man to gain spiritual knowledge. He also encouraged women education. He was the founder of Sri Vyasashrama in Yerpedu, Andhra Pradesh.[3] He influenced Vidya Prakasananda Swamy, his famous disciple who established Sri Sukabrahmashrama at Srikalahasti.[4]

Malayala Swamy extensively traveled in and out of Andhra Pradesh, where there is a Telugu speaking crowd to propagate the ancient Hindu wisdom by conducting _Sanatana Vedanta Jnana Sabha_s, _Omkara Satra Yaga_s lasting for a week, Chaturmasya Vrathas lasting for four months, installed idols in various temples, inaugurated ashrams, laid foundations to several constructions, opened monasteries, etc in the service of god.


Life

He was born to a traditional Hindu couple Kariappa, and Notthiyamma in village near Guruvayur, Kerala.[5] His birth name is Velappa. He studied various Hindu scriptures and toured various religious places in India. He finally reached Tirumala and did penance near Gogarbham. After doing penance for 12 years he settled at a place near Yerpedu, where he started an ashram in the name of Sage Vyasa. Since he spoke Malayalam only in the initial days, devotees named him Malayala Swamy. After he formally renounced the world, he also got a name _Asangananda Swami_, but he preferred the name _Malayala Swamy_.[6]


Vyasashram

He established Sri Vyasashram in 1926 near Yerpedu which is located in between two famous temple towns Tirupati, and Srikalahasti. His most popular book is _Sushka Vedanta Tamo Bhaskaram_ (The sunlight of truth, dispelling the darkness of empty metaphysics) which was published on December 1919.[7]


Books

Though he was basically from Malayali origin, he learned to speak Telugu. His Telugu speaking disciples wrote the books when he was dictating them in Telugu. He launched a monthly spiritual magazine called _Yadartha Bharati_ on February 1927 to propagate spiritual knowledge expounded by ancient Hindu Rishis. Here are some of his publications.
