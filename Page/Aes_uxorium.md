The AES UXORIUM was a Roman tax paid by those who reached adulthood without marrying,[1] with the exception of the Vestal Virgins.[2]


History

It was first imposed by the censors in 403 BC under the _Lex Papia Poppaea_.[3] It was one of the many measures against _caelibes_ (celibates), unless they married within 100 days. Not only did they have to pay the tax, but also they could not have a _hereditas_ or a legacy (_legatum_)[4] A man, when he attained the age of sixty, and a woman, when she attained the age of fifty, were not included within certain penalties of the law.[5] If they had not obeyed the law before attaining those respective ages, they were perpetually bound by its penalties by a _Senatus-consultum Pernicianum_. A _Senatus-consultum Claudianum_ so far modified the strictness of the new rule as to give a man who married above sixty the same advantage that he would have had if had married under sixty, provided he married a woman who was under fifty; the ground of which rule was the legal notion that a woman under fifty was still capable of having children.[6][7] If the woman was above fifty and the man under sixty, this was called _Impar Matrimonium_, and by a _Senatus-consultum Calvitianum_ it was entirely without effect as to releasing from incapacity to take _legata_ and _dotes_. On the death of the woman, therefore, the _dos_ became _caduca_.
