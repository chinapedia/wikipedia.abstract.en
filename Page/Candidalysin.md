CANDIDALYSIN is a cytolytic 31-amino acid α-helical peptide toxin found in the opportunistic pathogen _Candida albicans_. As such, Candidalysin is a rare fungal example of a classical virulence factor. Hyphal morphogenesis in _C. albicans_ is associated with damage to host epithelial cells; during this process Candidalysin is released.[1]

_C. albicans_ produces the protein Ece1 (extent of cell elongation 1) during the formation of hyphae.[2] Cleavage of Ece1 at arginine/lysine residues by Kex2 and Kex1 releases several peptides, including the toxin Candidalysin. Consequently, Candidalysin is also known as ECE1-III^(62–92K). _C. albicans s_trains missing Candidalysin do not damage epithelial cells and are said to be avirulent with respect to mucosal infections. The toxin is also responsible for the activation and propagation of a cellular immune response.[3]
