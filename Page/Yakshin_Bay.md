YAKSHIN BAY (Russian: _Guba Yakshina_) is a small bight in the western Sea of Okhotsk. It is 29 km (about 18 mi) wide and indents the southwest side of Bolshoy Shantar Island. The bay is entered between Capes Raduzhnyy to the west and Filippa to the east. The YAKSHIN RIVER flows into the head of the bay. There is ice in the bay from December to July. Tides rise 4.9 m (16 ft) at springs, with the flood current flowing in a counterclockwise direction round the bay and the ebb in the reverse direction. These tidal currents may reach 3.5 to 4 knots near the entrance of the bay but are less than 2 knots at its head.[1]


History

American whaleships hunted bowhead whales in the bay between 1858 and 1889. They called it BIG SHANTAR BIGHT. They also anchored in the bay to get wood and water and seek shelter from strong winds.[2]

The rusting remains of a 19th-century whaling station (perhaps American), including a steam engine and a meat grinder, exist at the head of the bay.
