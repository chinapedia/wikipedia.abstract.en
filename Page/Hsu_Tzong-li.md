As president

His selection was challenged with allegations of unconstitutionality, as Hsu had previously served on the Judicial Yuan.[8][9] Article V of the Additional Articles of the Constitution governs judicial appointments, and reads, in part "Each grand justice of the Judicial Yuan shall serve a term of eight years, independent of the order of appointment to office, and shall not serve consecutive terms." The Tsai Ing-wen administration argued that Hsu was reappointed, and never served consecutive terms.[10] The Alliance for Civic Oversight of Supreme Court Justice Nominees approved of Hsu's selection, as did the New Power Party.[11][12] Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan voted 72-2 for him to assume the post and for Tsai Chiung-tun () to be the Vice President.[13] Hsu was inaugurated as the President of the Judicial Yuan on 1 November 2016 in a ceremony attended by Vice President Chen Chien-jen. Hsu appointed Lu Tai-lang () the secretary-general of the Judicial Yuan and Chou Chan-chun () as the head of the Judges Academy.[14]


Political stances

Hsu stated shortly before his confirmation as President of the Judicial Yuan in October 2016 that Cross-Strait relations should be handled on a special state-to-state basis, comparing them to relations between East and West Germany.[15]
