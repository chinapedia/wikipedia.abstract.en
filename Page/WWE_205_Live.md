_WWE 205 LIVE_,[1] also shortened to _205 LIVE_ (pronounced as "two-o-five live"), is a professional wrestling web television program produced by WWE, which features the promotion's cruiserweight division, wherein all participants are billed at a maximum weight of 205 lbs. This show is part of the 205 Live brand and formerly part of the Raw brand, storyline divisions to which WWE employees are assigned to work and perform.

The show premiered on the WWE Network on November 29, 2016, and airs weekly on the service. It originally aired following _SmackDown Live_ on Tuesday nights.[2] _Talking Smack_, which previously held the 10:00pm eastern time slot, moved to 11:00pm eastern following the debut of _205 Live_ until _Talking Smack_'s cancellation in July 2017.[3][4] In September 2018, the show moved to Wednesday nights at 7:00pm eastern time, just prior to _NXT_, and is no longer "live", with tapings occurring on Tuesday nights prior to _SmackDown_{{'}}s live broadcast.[5] On January 13, 2019 it was announced that the show moved back to Tuesday nights at 10pm and air live.

History

WWE_205_Live,_April_4,_2017_Orlando.jpg]] _205 Live_ was established following the success of the Cruiserweight Classic tournament, to feature those who competed in the tournament and others who have become full-time members of WWE's cruiserweight division. Triple H, WWE executive producer and wrestler, stated the program is designed to serve as a showcase for the division, with its own distinctive feel and style compared to other WWE programming.[7]

The Raw brand was originally established as the exclusive home of the division during the 2016 brand extension, with all cruiserweights being drafted to Raw during the 2016 WWE draft. Following the premiere of _205 Live_, the cruiserweight wrestlers appear on both _Raw_ and _205 Live_, as well as making occasional appearances on _NXT_.

The show premiered on November 29, 2016; the main event of the inaugural episode saw Rich Swann defeating The Brian Kendrick for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship.[8]

On November 7, 2017, the United Kingdom Division was invited to _205 Live_. This would be the main roster debuts of most of the UK Division with the exception of Pete Dunne, who debuted the previous night on _Raw_.

In January 2018, Triple H took over the creative side of _205 Live_.[9] The first of the changes under Triple H was announced on January 23, with Daniel Bryan announcing that the first _205 Live_ general manager would be announced the following week.[10] The GM was revealed to be Drake Maverick (formerly known as "Rockstar Spud" from Impact Wrestling). He announced a 16-man tournament for the vacant WWE Cruiserweight Championship, which was won by Cedric Alexander. Once the tournament begun, WWE's cruiserweight division began to wrestle exclusively on _205 Live_ and ceased to appear on _Raw_. [11]

In September 2018, due to the second season of _WWE Mixed Match Challenge_, _205 Live_ went from a live format airing post-_SmackDown_ to a pre-taped format (being taped before _SmackDown_ goes live) and airing before _NXT_ on Wednesdays at 7:00pm eastern.[12]

On January 15, 2019, the show moved back to Tuesday nights at 10pm eastern and airs live again. [13]


Champions

On September 14, 2016, Triple H announced that the winner of the Cruiserweight Classic would not only receive a trophy, but would also receive the new WWE Cruiserweight Championship for the cruiserweight division on the Raw brand. Originally, the title was defended exclusively on _Monday Night Raw_, but on November 29, 2016, _205 Live_ was launched for the cruiserweight division, and for a time, the title was defended on both _Raw_ and _205 Live_, until 2018, when it became exclusive to the latter show - which would eventually become its own brand.
