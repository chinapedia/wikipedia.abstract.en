RUTH LEWIS is a Roman Catholic nun of the religious congregation for women, the Franciscan Missionaries of Christ the King, living and working in Karachi, Pakistan.


Vocation

On 17 February 1969, she became along with Sr. Gertrude Lemmens and Sr. Margaret D’Costa, one of the first to join the staff of Darul Sukun, home for around 150 mentally and physically disabled people, mostly children and teenagers, founded by the sisters of the Franciscan Missionaries of Christ the King.[1]

Since 2000, she has been in charge of the Darul Sukun. Sister Lewis is assisted by a team of five other nuns. Some of the residents like Cookie Lewis are so attached to the nun that she adopted her surname.[2]

She depends on many people and institutions who help her run a home of this size. She praised the people who come and supply groceries, clothes or whatever the sisters need for the institution. Volunteers from schools and other organisations also help feed the children and play with them. She is also assisted by volunteers from the Netherlands who stay to help for as much as three months. Without financial assistance from the Government, she relies on donation to run the institution. She is particularly proud of four of the children who won medals in the Special Olympics held in the United States in 1998.[3]

Her role includes welcoming visitors like American singer Mary McBride and Amanda Claudwell, the US press attaché in Karachi, who visited on October 30, 2011.[4]

She has been listed among people in Imran Aslam's book on the men and women who shaped Karachi.[5]


Making a wish

In January 2015, Make-A-Wish Foundation Pakistan granted the wish of Cookie Lewis from Darul Sukun, to be a teacher for a day. The President of Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Director of Education were also present with Sister Lewis at a ceremony held for the occasion.[6]


Recognition

On 18 January 2014, she received the Pride of Karachi Award which aimed to recognize and honor those individuals who have worked selflessly and passionately for the betterment of society.[7]

In 2018 she received the Hakim Mohammed Said Award for her work for humanity. The award was presented by Sindh Governor Muhammad Zubair.[8]
