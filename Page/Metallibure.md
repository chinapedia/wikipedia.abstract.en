METALLIBURE () (brand names AIMAX, SUISYNCHRON, TURISYNCHRON; former developmental code names ICI-33828, AY-61122, NSC-69536), also known as METHALLIBURE (, ) or METHALLIBUR (German), is a medication which was introduced in 1973 and has been used in veterinary medicine to synchronize estrus.[1][2] It was withdrawn in the United States and Europe due to teratogenicity and has been replaced with altrenogest (Regumate, Matrix), a progestin.[3][4]

The precise mechanism of action of metallibure is unknown.[5] It has been described as a "nonsteroidal antigonadotropin" and it appears to act directly on the pituitary gland and/or hypothalamus to suppress gonadotropin secretion.[6] However, metallibure has also been reported to be an antiprogestogen and to act specifically via inhibition of the biosynthesis or secretion of progesterone.[7]

Metallibure has similar endocrinological effects in women.[8] It is associated with several unpleasant side effects including appetite loss, nausea, occasional vomiting, lethargy, and drowsiness.[9] Animal toxicity studies revealed that the medication induced the development of cataracts, and this resulted in the termination of its clinical development.[10]
