The DASH PAdead simple human powered airplaneis a project led by Alec Proudfoot to build and fly a human-powered aircraft. The project's first flight on December 5, 2015, at Half Moon Bay Airport, was piloted by Proudfoot during which the aircraft flew .[1][2]

Subsequent flight trials in February, June, and November 2016, have also been successful. The second November 5 flight, piloted by Craig Robinson, covered and lasted four minutes.[3]

The longest flight yet occurred on November 18th, 2017, lasting 5 minutes and 20 seconds, covering 1.92 km.


Project history

Proudfoot started the DaSH PA project in late 2010 as a "for-fun, afterhours project to build a human powered airplane".[4]

The original design goals were a weight of , and wingspan of . It was designed to fly at . In October 2015, the team conducted wing load testing at the Hiller Aviation Museum in San Carlos, California.[5]

Over its history, the DaSH PA team has included hundreds of volunteers, and as of November 2017, nine pilots.[6]


Flights

Proudfoot wrote, "We've now had eight pilots fly a total of 22 flights, and the airplane has traveled about 11,000 meters in about 27-1/2 minutes of total flight time."[7]

On December 5, 2015, the first flight at Half Moon Bay Airport, piloted by Proudfoot, was successful, but ended after a tail bracket broke. The problem was subsequently repaired. The final craft weight was .[8]

On February 20 and 21, 2016, the team made six successful flights, with six different pilots, at Half Moon Bay Airport.[9]

On June 25 and 26, 2016, the team made another five flights at Moffett Federal Field, close to their headquarters in Silicon Valley, California; on the last flight, the plane crash-landed after difficulty compensating for a crosswind, damaging the nose-wheel tube, fairing, and propeller.[10]

On November 5, 2016, the team made eight flights with seven pilots at Moffett Field.[11]

On December 11 and 17, 2016, the team conducted more flights at Moffett Field. On the last flight, piloted by Alec Proudfoot, torsional divergence resulted in wing collapse.[12]

In October and November of 2017, the team had a total of 17 additional flights at Moffett.
