_EUCALYPTUS SIMILIS_, commonly known as the INLAND YELLOWJACKET or the QUEENSLAND YELLOWJACKET, is a eucalypt that is native to Queensland.[1]


Description

The medium sized tree typucally grows to a height of .[2] It has yellow-brown or orange, brown or yellow, bark that is persistent throughout. The bark is tessellated or fibrous-flaky with whitish patches that sheds in short ribbons or small polygonal flakes. Adult leaves are disjunct, glossy green or grey-green and discolorous. The leaf blade is lanceolate in shape and basally tapered[3] with a length of and a width of .[4] When the tree blooms in December it produces simple axillary conflorescences with three to seven flowered umbellasters and terete peduncles and white to cream flowers.[5] Flowers have a diameter of approximately .[6] Fruit appear later which are a cylindrical cup shaped woody capsules long and wide containing grey seeds. It is very similar in appearance to _Corymbia leichhardtii_.[7]


Distribution

Found in woodland communities it grows on gentle slopes and flats in deep clay, loamy or sandy soils. The range of the tree is from Jericho in inland Central Queensland extending north to Laura on Cape York in North Queensland.[8]

_E. similis_ often occurs with _Corymbia setosa_ form a sparse canopy. Associated species in the shrub layer, which is also usually sparse, includes _Lithomyrtus microphylla_, _Carissa lanceolata_, _Gastrolobium grandiflorum_ and _Jacksonia ramosissima_. _Triodia pungens_ usually dominants the very sparse to sparse ground layer.[9]


Classification

The species was first described by the botanist Joseph Maiden in 1913 in the _Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales_ from samples collected by G.H. Carr from near Emerald in 1908.[10] _E. similis_ is in the Eucalyptus subgenus _Eudesmia_ and is the only non-bloodwood species likely to be confused with the yellow bloodwoods. It has very similar bark but differs fundamentally in having buds in simple axillary umbels of 7, and lacks the outer operculum, instead having four calyx teeth, and also has a single petaline operculum.[11]


Cultivation

_E. similis_ can be propagated from seed and is suited to drier areas and is planted as a small shade tree for loamy or sandy soils.[12]
