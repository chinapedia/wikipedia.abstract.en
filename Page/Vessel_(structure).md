_VESSEL_ (TKA) is a structure and landmark which was built as part of the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project in Manhattan, New York City, New York. Construction began in April 2017; it opened on March 15, 2019.

Designed by the British designer Thomas Heatherwick, the elaborate honeycomb-like structure rises 16 stories and consists of 154 flights of stairs, 2,500 steps, and 80 landings for visitors to climb. _Vessel_ is the main feature of the Hudson Yards Public Square. Its final cost is expected to be $200 million.[1]

The structure's name is a working title, noted in the TKA abbreviation, which means "Temporarily Known As". The structure owners have asked the public to give it a formal name and have a website devoted to naming it.[2] One of the most discussed names on social media was "The Shawarma", after the cone-shaped meat popular on street carts.[3]


Description

Vessel_top_vc.png _Vessel_ is a 16-story, [4] structure of connected staircases between the buildings of Hudson Yards, located in the Hudson Yards Public Square.[5] Designed by Thomas Heatherwick,[6] _Vessel_ has 154 flights, 2,500 steps, and 80 landings that stretch from its base to its apex (making it as tall as it is wide at its apex),[7] with the total length of the stairs exceeding .[8] The structure also has ramps and an elevator to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.[9] Stephen Ross, the CEO of Hudson Yards' developer Related Companies, said that its unusual shape was intended to make the structure stand out like a "12-month Christmas tree."[10] The copper-clad steps, arranged like a jungle gym[11] and modeled after Indian stepwells,[12][13] can hold 1,000 people at a time.[14] Heatherwick said that he intends visitors to climb and explore the structure as if it were a jungle gym.[15] At the top of the structure, visitors can see the Hudson River.[16]

_Vessel_ was designed in concert with the Hudson Yards Public Square, designed by Thomas Woltz from Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects.[17] The attached public square has 28,000 plants and 225 trees,[18] located on the platform upon which Hudson Yards is built.[19] The plaza's southern side is to have a canopy of trees. The southeast entrance is to contain a fountain as well. A "'seasonally expressive' entry garden" is meant for the 34th Street–Hudson Yards station's subway entrance at 33rd Street.[20] The plaza is also designed to connect the High Line promenade.[21]

Although _Vessel_ had originally been slated to cost $75 million,[22] the projections were later revised to between $150[23] and $200 million.[24] Heatherwick attributed the greatly increased price tag to the complexity of building the steel pieces.[25] The pieces of _Vessel_ are being assembled in the commune of Monfalcone in Italy.[26] Ships transport the sections of the sculpture to Hudson River docks.[27]

It was planned that _"Vessel"_ would be the structure's temporary name during construction, and that a permanent name would be determined later.[28] After _Vessel_ opened, Hudson Yards asked the public to give it a formal name, creating a website devoted to that effect.[29][30]

History

Hudson_Yards_May_2017_40_(cropped).jpg In an interview with _Fortune_ magazine, Ross said that he "wanted to commission something transformational, monumental," which led to the concept for _Vessel_.[31] Ross was looking to five unnamed artists who were renowned for designing similar plazas, then asked them for in-depth proposals. He rejected all of the plans, at which point a colleague introduced Ross to Heatherwick.[32] Six weeks after they talked, Ross accepted Heatherwick's proposal immediately because it "had everything I wanted."[33] In an interview with _designboom_, Heatherwick said that his design for _Vessel_ originated from a childhood experience when he "fell in love with an old discarded flight of wooden stairs outside a local building site."[34] The media first reported Heatherwick's commissioning in October 2013.[35][36]

The concept of _Vessel_ was unveiled to the public on September 14, 2016,[37] in an event attended by hundreds of people including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.[38][39] Hosted by Anderson Cooper, the event featured a performance from the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater that evoked the interlocking design of _Vessel{{'s}}_ staircases.[40]

In April 2017, the first major piece of the sculpture was installed at Hudson Yards.[41] Construction started on April 18[42] with the installation of the first 10 pieces of the 75-piece structure.[43] It was projected for completion in the spring of 2019,[44] with the other 65 pieces arriving in five batches.[45] The structure topped out in December 2017.[46][47] In October 2018, it was announced that the opening of _Vessel_ had been scheduled for March 15, 2019, and that tickets to enter the structure would become available in February.[48] By January 2019, Hudson Yards officials were soliciting public suggestions for a rename of _Vessel_. Though the structure had no official name, the Hudson Yards website called it the "Hudson Yards Staircase".[49] _Vessel_ opened as scheduled on March 15, 2019.[50][51]


Critical reception

HudsonYards_05-06-19-1_(47003439824).jpg The sculpture received both acclaim and criticism upon its unveiling. _Fortune_ called _Vessel_ "Manhattan's answer to the Eiffel Tower",[52] a sentiment echoed by CNN.[53] _Elle Decor_ compared _Vessel_ to an M. C. Escher drawing.[54] _The New York Times_ stated that the sculpture, while a "stairway to nowhere" in the utilitarian sense, served as an "exclamation point" to the northern terminus of the High Line Park.[55] _Gothamist_ called _Vessel_ "a bold addition to the city's landscape."[56] Speaking about the structure's design process, Heatherwick stated, "We had to think of what could act as the role of a landmarker. Something that could help give character and particularity to the space."[57] Several commentators have dubbed the structure the _Giant Shawarma_.[58][59][60]

Public Art Fund president Susan Freedman liked the renderings for _Vessel_ but called it "a leap of faith in terms of scale." She stated that there might be too much demand for _Vessel_, especially considering the structure's proximity to the High Line.[61] Other critics reviewed _Vessel_ more negatively. _New York Times_ architecture critic Michael Kimmelman called _Vessel's_ exterior "gaudy" and criticized Hudson Yards more generally as a "gated community" that lacked real public space.[62] CityLab's Feargus O'Sullivan called _Vessel_, along with Heatherwick's other numerous billionaire-funded developments and architectural projects, "a gaudy monument to being only ever-so-slightly free."[63]

Much of the criticism of _Vessel_ has been of its photo policies. Hudson Yards, the owner of _Vessel_, claims ownership of all pictures and videos taken of _Vessel_, and reserves the right to use any photos or videos taken for commercial purposes without paying royalty fees. This privileged use of photos and videos by Hudson Yards, a private company, has been criticized because Hudson Yards has benefited from $4.5 billion in tax revenue.[64] After criticism emerged about _Vessel's_ copyright policy, Hudson Yards modified the policy so visitors would have ownership of photos of _Vessel_.[65][66]
