Career

In 1987, Simeonovski graduated from the National High School of Applied Art "St.Luka" in Sofia. From 1989 to 1995 he studied vertebrate zoology at the Sofia University, where he earned his Master of Science degree with a thesis on the aspects of wildcats and feral cats. Simeonovski's scientific interests concentrated on the reconstruction of the external characteristics of fossil mammals, including fur hair, fur coloring and fur patterns, crests, mane and dewlaps. He is also studying anatomy, development, heredity, evolution, adaptive characteristics, and the variation of mammals. Further he uses prehistoric and ancient art as sources of zoological information.

In 2010, Simeonovski was a member of the artistic designer team of the exhibition _Mammoths and mastodons: titans of the Ice Age_ in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, where he created an artistic rendering of Lyuba, the currently most completely preserved woolly mammoth calf.[1] In 2011, he illustrated the work _Les petits mammifères de Madagascar: guide de leur distribution, biology et identification_ by Voahangy Soarimalala and Steven M. Goodman. In 2014, he illustrated the book _Extinct Madagascar: Picturing the Island’s Past_ by William L. Jungers and Steven M. Goodman about the fossil and subfossil mammal and bird fauna of Madagascar which was also a subject for an exhibition in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago that run from August 2014 to October 2015.[2]

In 2016, Simeonovski illustrated the book _Horned Armadillos and rafting Monkeys: The Fascinating Fossil Mammals of South America_ by Darin A. Croft on the fossil mammal fauna of the Cenozoic in South America. That same year he was part of the illustrator team of the book _The Mammals of Luzon Island. Biogeography and Natural History of a Philippine fauna_ by Lawrence R. Heaney, Danilo S. Balete and Eric A. Rickart.
