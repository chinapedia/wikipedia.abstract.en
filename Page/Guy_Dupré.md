GUY DUPRÉ (February 27, 1928 – January 17, 2018) was a French writer and publisher.


Biography

Dupré published three novels, two books of memoirs and a collection of chronicles, but the unity of his style and his writing unconcerned with traditional genres makes the same voice heard from one book to the other.

At the time of its publication (1953), his first work, _Les Fiancées sont froides_, was hailed by Albert Béguin, André Breton, and Julien Gracq. This poetic and initiatory account, with its rather obscure intrigue, bears the imprint of German Romanticism. Plotting a fugitive hussar in the time of the Napoleonic wars, it is set on the shores of the Baltic Sea and is not without evoking _Le Coup de Grâce_ (1939) by Marguerite Yourcenar. The subject and the style of the book earned Dupré to be attached to the movement of the Hussards.

Guy Dupré joined the publishing house Plon, which has long specialized in military memorabilia. He prepared a biography of General Charles Mangin that was never completed but whose face would appear in _Le Grand coucher_. He made an anthology of Maurice Barrès (_Mes Cahiers_, Plon, 1962), an anthology of the _Chroniques de la Grande Guerre_ of the same (Plon, 1968), as well as the cross-correspondence between Maurice Barrès and Charles Maurras: _La République ou le Roi, correspondance 1888-1923_, Plon, 1970.

Close to novelist , he wrote the preface for his _L'Étoile de l'Empire invisible_ (Guy Trédaniel, 1994).
