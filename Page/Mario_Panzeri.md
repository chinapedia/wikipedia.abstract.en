He began composing songs in the second half of the 1930s, getting large success with a two songs, "Maramao perché sei morto?" and "Pippo non lo sa", which also raised some controversities as they were accused to mock some important Fascist personalities (Costanzo Ciano and Achille Starace, respectively).

In 1959 his song "Lettera a Pinocchio" was presented at the first edition of the Zecchino d'Oro and later became a hit thanks to the version by Johnny Dorelli.[1][2][3]
