UBUNTU BUDGIE (formerly BUDGIE-REMIX) is an official community flavor of Ubuntu featuring the Budgie desktop. It combines the stable and thoroughly-tested Ubuntu core with a modern, lightweight and traditional-looking desktop developed by the Solus project.


History

Ubuntu Budgie started out as an unofficial community flavor in parallel with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, referred to as budgie-remix.[1] Budgie-remix 16.10 was later released by strictly following the time frame issued for Ubuntu 16.10.[2]

It was eventually recognized as an official community flavor of Ubuntu, and was rebranded as Ubuntu Budgie.[3]

Vincenzo Bovino was hired as the new brand and PR Manager.[4]

Ubuntu Budgie 17.04 was released in April 2017,[5] and was updated to version 17.10 in October 2017.[6]

In Ubuntu Budgie 18.10, 32-bit support has been dropped.[7] 32-bit support has been also dropped in Ubuntu MATE.
