_FTM MAGAZINE_ is a company founded in Rochester, NY currently based in Albany, NY that specifically represents FTM (female to male) trans men. It is a medium for trans masculine people to read other people’s stories and encourages people to share their own. The content on the official website is sorted into: News, Culture, Community, and Transitional. Popular topics include fashion, fitness, community stories, interviews, tips, and reviews. The company advertises through inter-community, and allied businesses rather than banner, or pop-up ads. The company acquires steady funding through T-shirt sales from their clothing line, and cover prices.


History

FTM Magazine was first funded in November 2013. Jason Robert Ballard, ran the company independently for the first three years. The website was then launched in January 2014. The magazine released a photo of model Aydian Dowling recreating the famous Adam Levine photo which was featured in the Cosmopolitan (UK) for testicular and prostate cancer awareness. As a result of this photo's popularity, the magazine launched their clothing line: This Is What Trans Looks Like. Due to some backlash for being a binary exclusive company, the Fall 2017 issue was postponed. It has been reopened with a team as a media platform. The company is looking to reach a larger audience. There are tentative plans to create sub-domains of the magazine in different languages for countries outside of the US.

In 2017, FTM Magazine launched Trans Men Magazine which is a downloadable magazine with monthly topics, horoscopes, and an advise column.

In 2018, Aidan Faiella has taken over as CEO of the company.
