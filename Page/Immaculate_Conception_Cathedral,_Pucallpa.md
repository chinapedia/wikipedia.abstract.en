The IMMACULATE CONCEPTION CATHEDRAL[1] () or PUCALLPA CATHEDRAL[2] (also known as the Cathedral of Ucayali) is the most important Catholic temple in the department of Ucayali in the South American country of Peru.[3] The Cathedral was inaugurated on December 8, 2005. Located next to the provincial municipality and the _Plaza de Armas_, it is the local tourism center. Dedicated to the virgin Mary, the first building dates back to the 1950s. It was imposed by the Apostolic Vicariate of Pucallpa under the command of Bishop Juan Luis Mart√≠n Bisson, with the support of the donations and work of thousands of citizens interested in his culmination. It was the first demonstration on a plane crash of TANS Peru, a week after it was inaugurated.

The inhabitants perform masses mainly dedicated to Jesus Christ and his life in addition to remembering the patron saints: the Lord of Miracles, St. Martin de Porres, Mary of Nazaret, St Rose of Lima, but presented in a modern way and adapted to the jungle.
