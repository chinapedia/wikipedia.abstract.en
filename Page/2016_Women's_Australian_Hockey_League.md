The 2016 WOMEN'S AUSTRALIAN HOCKEY LEAGUE was the 24th edition of the women's field hockey tournament. The tournament was held in the Western Australia city of Perth.

Queensland Scorchers won the gold medal for the sixth time by defeating the Victorian Vipers 3–2 in the final. NSW Arrows won the bronze medal by defeating Canberra Strikers 2–1 in the third place playoff.[1]


Competition format

The tournament is divided into two pools, Pool A and Pool B, each consisting of five teams in a round robin format. Throughout the pool stage however, teams from each pool competed in crossover matches with the teams in the other pool, with each team playing one crossover match.

At the conclusion of the pool stage, the top two teams of Pools A and B progressed through to the semi-finals, where the top placed teams of each pool competed against the second placed team of each pool, with the winners progressing to the final.

The bottom three teams in each pool move into Pool C (Classification Round), where teams carry over points from previous matches, and play the remaining teams. The final placings in Pool C carry over to final placings in the tournament.
