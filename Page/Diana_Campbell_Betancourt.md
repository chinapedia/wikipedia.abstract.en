''' Dhaka Art Summit and Samdani Art Foundation '''

Diana Campbell Betancourt has developed the Dhaka Art Summit to be the world's leading research and exhibitions platform for art from South Asia, and developed a new philanthropic platform to shift the discourse away from an Indo-centric one by bringing together artists, architects, curators, and writers from across South Asia and through a largely commission based model where new work and exhibitions are born in Bangladesh.[11][12] She has curated numerous solo projects with artists such as Raqib Shaw (co-curated with Maria Balshaw)[13]Haroon Mirza, Simryn Gill, Tino Sehgal, Lynda Benglis, Shilpa Gupta, Shahzia Sikander, Naeem Mohaiemen, Runa Islam, Shumon Ahmed, Pawel Althamer, Asim Waqif, and Raqs Media Collective[14][15][16] as well as group exhibitions such as Rewind (with Amara Antilla, Sabih Ahmed, and Beth Citron)),[17] Mining Warm Data,[18] The Asian Art Biennale in Context and Bearing Points[19] and initiated a free, alternative education program called Samdani Seminars and Education Pavilion[20][21][22] which bridges the gaps in curriculum between the various art schools in Dhaka with international guest faculty. Campbell Betanourt has conceived of the Dhaka Art Summit as a cumulative event, stressing that it is 'not about the individual editions; it is a continuation, and it always builds on the last one'.[23]

In addition to her exhibitions making practice, Betancourt is also responsible for developing the Samdani Art Foundation collection, which has been recognized by ArtReview, Artnet News,[24] Artnet News,[25] and Artnews[26] as one of the leading collections in the world. The collection, as well as temporary exhibitions related to it, will be visible in the foundation's art centre that will open in Sylhet, Bangladesh at the end of 2018.[27]

She produced and curated critically acclaimed exhibitions by Carlos Amorales,[29] Pawel Althamer,[30] Isabel and Alfredo Aquilizan,[31] Cian Dayrit,[32] Stefanos Tsivopoulos,[33] as well as the first major solo exhibition in Asia of the late American artist Bruce Conner.[34]
