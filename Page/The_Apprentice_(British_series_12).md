SERIES TWELVE OF _THE APPRENTICE_, a British reality television series, began broadcasting in the UK during 2016, from 6 October to 18 December on BBC One;[1] due to live coverage of the UK EU membership referendum in late Spring of that year, alongside live coverage of Euro 2016 and the 2016 Rio Olympics during Summer, the BBC postponed the series' broadcast until the middle of Autumn to avoid clashing with these major events.[2]

It is the only series to date to have episodes aired on Thursdays, rather than on Wednesdays as is traditionally arranged for the programme's broadcast schedule, and the only one to feature a candidate quitting the programme while a task is currently in progress. Alongside the standard twelve episodes, the series was preceded by the mini online episode "Meet the Candidates" on 27 September, with two specials aired alongside the series – "The Final Five" on 13 December, and "Why I Fired Them" on 16 December.

Eighteen candidates took part in the twelfth series,[3][4] with Alana Spencer becoming the overall winner.[5][6] Excluding the specials, the series averaged around 7.12 million viewers during its broadcast.


Series Overview

Towards the conclusion of the eleventh series' broadcast, applications for the twelfth series were made available in December 2015, with production staff assessing applicants between January and February 2016. Work on filming the series took place from late Spring to early Summer, once assessments had determined which eighteen applicants would form the final line-up. Both the filming and broadcast schedule for this series had to take into account three major events receiving live TV coverage during 2016 - the UK government had announced in 2015 that they would be holding a major referendum pertaining to the future of the country's EU membership, which the major broadcasters would be covering, while the BBC's Summer schedule had been prepared to oversee live coverage of both Euro 2016 and the 2016 Rio Olympics. As such it stuck to the same arrangement as had been used in the previous series, though unusually the episodes were arranged so that the majority took place on Thursdays within the standard timeslot it occupied; it is the only series to date to have this arrangement in its broadcast schedule.

Filming on the first task saw the men name their team _Titans_, while the women named their team _Nebula_. The series is notable for being the second time that both teams lost a task, though with six candidates being brought to face an in-depth review of their performance, the highest number to ever be brought back to the boardroom on any incarnation of _The Apprentice_ brand. It is also the first time in the show's history that a candidate quit the programme while a task was currently underway, while the result of the Interviews stage drew notable criticism over gender discrimination in the aftermath of the episode that members of the programme, particularly Karen Brady, refuted. Of those who took part, Alana Spencer would become the eventual winner, going on to use her prize to start up a nationwide bakery business she would name Ridiculously Rich.[7]

Episodes


Criticism and controversy

Candidate Selection

Following the second episode, fans of the show went onto social media to criticize the selection of candidates for the series as being "the worst ever" in the show's history, based upon the result of the second task, with some remarking that the candidates hadn't shown anything worthwhile to make them continue watching the programme.[8][9][10] However, Claude Littner felt differently about the candidates for the series, panning the comments made on social media by stating in an interview:[11]

  "It is stressful. Having me stand there and all the cameras, and then Lord Sugar asking questions – it's not comfortable, that's for sure. So I think, every year everyone says ‘oh these candidates aren't very good are they,’ it's just that they’re put under pressure. All these people saying ‘this is the worst bunch,’ or whatever it is that they’re saying, I just think is farcical, really."

Allegations of racism and sexism

Following the broadcast of the sixth episode, a number of viewers made accusations that Dillon St. Paul had been racist after he complained about Karthik Nagesan's negotiation technique for their team's lengha, by remarking that it was being basically "Indian chit-chat". In response to this, Dillon apologized for what he said, stating:[12][13][14]

  "I would never intentionally set out to say something derogatory. I apologise if my comment caused offence, it was not intended in that manner."

In a similar incident three episodes earlier, a number of viewers also made accusations on Twitter that Sofiane Khelfa had been sexist after he made a comment of wanting to stay out of the manufacturing process of sweets by stating that "I've got a wife who cooks for me."[15]

Allegations of gender discrimination

Following the broadcast of the Interviews episode, it was alleged by the media that Lord Sugar had fired Grainne McCoy, Jessica Cunningham and Frances Bishop, purely on the basis of them being working mothers.[16] However, Karren Brady, herself a working mother, denied the allegations when the matter was raised during her guest appearance on Loose Women the day after the episode's broadcast, claiming that:[17]

  "The people that went through were those who had the best business plans – I don't think it had anything to do with the fact that they're working mums or not working mums. It was purely a decision based on who's got the best business plan and who's done the best."

Final Decision

Following the broadcast of Week 9, it was revealed by _The Mail on Sunday_ that Lord Sugar had been following Alana Spencer on Twitter, although she was not named in their report. The newspaper explained that it was a tradition of his, every year, to follow the candidate that had won that respective series of _The Apprentice_. The revelations caused an uproar of controversy by many, with Sugar admitting to his mistake before he subsequently unfollowed the candidate as a direct result, in an effort to conceal the winner's identity before the finale had been aired.[18]
