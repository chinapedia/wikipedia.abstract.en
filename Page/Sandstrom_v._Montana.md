_SANDSTROM V. MONTANA_, 442 U.S. 510 (1979), is a United States Supreme Court case that reaffirmed the prosecution's burden of proof of the mental element of a crime by striking down a jury instruction that "the law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts".[1] In _Francis v. Franklin_, 471 U.S. 307 (1985), Justice Brennan wrote about "_Sandstrom_ and the wellspring due process principal from which it is drawn" as follows:

  _Sandstrom v. Montana_ made clear that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a State from making use of jury instructions that have the effect of relieving the State of the burden of proof on the critical question of intent in a criminal prosecution.
