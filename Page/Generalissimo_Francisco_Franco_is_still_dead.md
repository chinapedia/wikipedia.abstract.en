"GENERALISSIMO FRANCISCO FRANCO IS STILL DEAD" is a catchphrase that originated in 1975 during the first season of _NBC's Saturday Night_ (now called _Saturday Night Live_, or _SNL_) and which mocked the weeks-long media reports of the Spanish Caudillo's impending death. It was one of the first catchphrases from the series to enter the general lexicon.


Origin

The death of Spanish Caudillo Francisco Franco during the first season of _NBC's Saturday Night_ served as the source of the phrase. Franco lingered near death for weeks before dying. On slow news days, United States network television newscasters sometimes noted that Franco was still alive, or not yet dead. The imminent death of Franco was a headline story on NBC News for a number of weeks prior to his death on November 20, 1975.

After Franco's death, Chevy Chase, reader of the news on _NBC's Saturday Night_'s comedic news segment _Weekend Update_, announced Franco's death and read a quotation from Richard Nixon: "General Franco was a loyal friend and ally of the United States. He earned worldwide respect for Spain through firmness and fairness."[1] As an ironic counterpoint to this, a picture was displayed behind Chase, showing Franco giving the Roman salute alongside Adolf Hitler.[2]

In subsequent weeks Chase developed the joke into a parody of the earlier news coverage of Franco's illness, treating his death as the top story. "This breaking news just in", Chase would announce – "GENERALISSIMO FRANCISCO FRANCO IS _STILL_ DEAD!"[3] Occasionally, Chase would change the wording slightly in order to keep the joke fresh, e.g. "Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still valiantly holding on in his fight to remain dead."[4] The joke was sometimes combined with another running gag in which, rather than having a sign language interpreter visually presenting the news to aid the deaf, the show would provide assistance from Garrett Morris, "head of the New York School for the Hard of Hearing", whose "aid" involved cupping his hands around his mouth and shouting the news as Chase read it. The gag ran until early 1977, with occasional callbacks in later seasons.


Legacy

The phrase has remained in use since Franco's death. James Taranto's _Best of the Web Today_ column at OpinionJournal.com uses the phrase as a tag for newspaper headlines that indicate something is still happening when it should be obvious. On February 8, 2007, during Jack Cafferty's segment on CNN's _The Situation Room_ on the day of the death of Anna Nicole Smith, he asked of CNN correspondent Wolf Blitzer "Is Anna Nicole Smith still dead, Wolf?"[5] It was also used now and then on _NBC News Overnight_ in the early 1980s, and Keith Olbermann occasionally used it on _Countdown_. In 2013, it experienced a brief resurgence in a different context, when it began appearing on social media a few days after the death of Spanish filmmaker Jesus Franco.

_The Wall Street Journal_ used the headline "Generalísimo Francisco Franco Is Still Dead – And His Statues Are Next"[6] on its front page March 2, 2009. The newspaper used it once again on its front page in the headline "Generalísimo Francisco Franco Is Still Dead – But for some not dead enough" on August 21, 2015 when it reported about critics calling to enforce a 2007 anti-Franco law in Madrid and to rename streets and plazas, after the last election had ended the 24-year reign of conservatives in the city council.[7]

Although _SNL_{{'}}s use is perhaps the most widely known, it is predated by the "'John Garfield Still Dead' syndrome," which originated as a result of extensive coverage in the wake of the actor John Garfield's death and funeral in 1952.[8]

After a brief _in memoriam_ during _SNL_{{'}}s 40th Anniversary Special on February 15, 2015, Bill Murray ended the segment with the famous phrase which "just came in from Spain."
