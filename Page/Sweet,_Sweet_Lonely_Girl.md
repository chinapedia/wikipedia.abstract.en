Reception

IndieWire's Eric Kohn characterized the film as "Bergmanesque"[3] and publicly praised it as being an, "artfully subdued gothic lesbian psychological horror tale with great atmosphere."[4] Bloody Disgusting and Modern Horrors both reviewed _Sweet, Sweet Lonely Girl_, the former writing that the movie "not without flaws – the rather sudden ending, for one – and it does nothing to update the genre, or comment on its influences" but that "Those who appreciate that side of the genre will find something rare and delightful. It is a stylistic achievement, and in the end, a melancholy exploration of just what the title promises – loneliness."[5][6] _The Austin Chronicle_ also reviewed the movie, commenting that they found the film's "little moments" "chillingly captivating".[7]
