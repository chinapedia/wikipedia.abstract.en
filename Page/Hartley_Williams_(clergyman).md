HARTLEY WILLIAMS (1844 – 18 January 1927) was an Anglican clergyman in South Australia who ran a private school in Mount Gambier.


History

Williams was born in South Australia, a son of Thomas Williams (c. 1794–1881) and his second wife Catherine née Codd, who arrived on the _Platina_ in February 1839. The father, a banker and farmer, was appointed to the Legislative Council, then jailed for six months for false pretences.[1] and died in England.

Williams was educated at St. Peter's College and entered St. Mary's Hall, Oxford University, but returned to Adelaide without a degree,[2]

In 1871 he was ordained by Bishop Short as a deacon, and as a priest in 1874. In 1874 he was appointed curate of St. Peter's Church, Glenelg under Canon Field, remaining there for two years.[3] He was at Melrose for five years 1875[4] to 1878?, servicing the townships of Laura, Jamestown, Gladstone, Georgetown and Port Pirie. Port Augusta was later added to his responsibilities. He resigned the incumbency in 1879[5] and was assigned to St Jude's, Brighton. He resigned that cure in 1881, expecting a transfer to Melbourne[6] but was sent instead to Hobart, Tasmania where he relieved Canon Bailey at the St. John the Baptist Church on Goulburn Street. While there, in 1882, a sermon he gave criticising an article in _The Mercury_ brought an intemperate response from that newspaper.[7] Williams returned to South Australia shortly after,[8] accepting an invitation to serve as the first incumbent of the Church of the Holy Cross in Mount Gambier.

In 1884 he founded a high school for boys[9] in Doughty Terrace, Mount Gambier, at which many of the town's future leaders were educated. The existing grammar school closed soon after, and its principal, Richard Newstead Hobart (c. 1835–1898), joined with Williams as second master.[10] Rev. Donald Kerr was another recruit to the school's teaching staff.[11] The Holy Cross Church closed in 1888 and Williams quit the ministry around the same time.[12] His exodus from the Holy Cross church, and perhaps from the Church of England, may have been a consequence of friction between himself and Church authorities. He was of the "High Church" persuasion; dogmatic and outspoken in his views.[13] He no doubt took the classes in Latin, of which he was a considerable scholar.[14] The school closed in 1903,[15] and Williams left Mount Gambier a few years later. The building was for a time used as a private hospital, then may have been used as a girls' school.[16]

He moved to Naracoorte or Bordertown, and may have been involved with a political organisation.

He died at the Grange.


Other interests

Hartley Williams was an enthusiastic sportsman: he excelled at cricket (he was an umpire in the early days of the Adelaide Oval), boxing and rowing. In his later hears he was fond of angling[17] and gardening.[18]

In 1902 he was appointed (honorary) Inspector of Fisheries for the River Glenelg,[19] where he had a residence.

He was for some time a close friend of Canons Samuel Green (c. 1842–1904), James Pollitt (1813–1881) and F. Slaney Poole (c. 1846–1936).[20]
