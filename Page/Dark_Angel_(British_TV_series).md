_DARK ANGEL_ is a British two-part television drama miniseries, based on the adaptation of the book _Mary Ann Cotton: Britain's First Female Serial Killer_ by David Wilson.[1] The series was broadcast on 31 October and 7 November 2016, and starred Joanne Froggatt as protagonist Mary Ann Cotton, widely regarded as Britain's first female serial killer, who was found guilty of murder in March 1873 for the murder of three of her husbands, allegedly in order to collect on their insurance policies.[2] The series was produced by World Productions and distributed by Endemol Shine.[3][4]

The series co-starred Alun Armstrong as Mary Ann's step-father, George Stott, and Jonas Armstrong as her main love interest, Joe Natrass. Penny Layden, Laura Morgan, Sam Hoare and Emma Fielding also took starring roles in the two-part drama.[5]
