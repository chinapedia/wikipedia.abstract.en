_SCREAMING DOWN THE GRAVITY WELL_ is the second studio album by Death Ride 69, released in 1996 by Fifth Colvmn Records.[1] Marco Gariboldi of _Fabryka_ called the album "a crescendo of harsh guitars, distortions and hammering drums directed by the high and charismatic voice of Linda" and "a very good album by an underrated and forgotten band."[2] _Aiding & Abetting_ was more critical, saying "the general lack of creative thought in the songwriting is pretty distressing" and claiming the band was "scraping the bottom of the barrel."[3]
