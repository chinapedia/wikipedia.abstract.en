This is one of the most popular shows on television. [2]

Lisa Joy, along with her husband Jonathan Nolan, signed a new deal with amazon to write and produce a series for the company. The deal is worth 150 million dollars over five years. Joy and Nolan are now working on a Sci-Fi series titled _"The Peripheral."_ [3]
