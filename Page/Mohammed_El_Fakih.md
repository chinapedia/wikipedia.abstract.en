Career

He started his youth career with Raja Casablanca, but did not get his full chance with his childhood team, so he left for JS Massira to seek more games. A year later he proved himself in the Second Division with Chabab El Masira so he got signed by Kawkab Marrakech for the 2015 season. Kawkab Marrakech had a chance to participate in the 2016 CAF Confederation Cup, and he was one of the best players of the tournament scoring 6 goals and taking his team to the group stage with strong teams such as Etoile Sahel . 2016 has been a good year for Mohammed el Fakih. Therefore, Raja Casablanca has offered him a contract but he signed a 2 years extension that will make him stay until 2018.

In January 2019, El Fakih was loaned out to Youssoufia Berrechid from FAR Rabat.[2]
