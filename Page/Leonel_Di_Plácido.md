LEONEL DI PLÁCIDO (born 28 January 1994) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a defender for Lanús.[1][2]


Club career

Di Plácido started his professional career in Floresta, Buenos Aires with then-Primera División club All Boys in 2013, however his first appearance for the team came in 2014 in a league defeat against Newell's Old Boys.[3][4] His first five appearances for All Boys were off the bench so he had to wait until 17 April to start a match, versus Arsenal de Sarandí, which ended with him scoring his first goal of his career, an 84th-minute equaliser assisted by Javier Cámpora. However, it was not a good season for All Boys as they suffered relegation into the Primera B Nacional.[5]

In 2014, his second season with All Boys, he participated in fifteen matches over two competitions and scored his second goal; against Unión. 2015 turned out to be Di Plácido's most prominent and last season with the club as he played thirty-five times before departing to join Atlético Tucumán on loan until June 2017 in 2016. He made his debut for his new club on 19 February against Unión.[6][7] On 24 August 2017, Di Plácido completed a permanent transfer to Lanús.[8][9][10] He made his Lanús debut in a home defeat to Boca Juniors on 10 September.[11]


International career

Di Plácido was called up to the Argentina national team by Lionel Scaloni for friendlies in September 2018 with Guatemala and Colombia; though remained on the bench for both fixtures.[12][13]
