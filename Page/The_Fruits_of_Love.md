Plot

Elizabeth Wallace, formerly Elizabeth Kirbridge née Elizabeth Bellamy, (b. 1887) is the daughter of Richard and Lady Marjorie Bellamy and the sister of James. Julius Karekin is a wealthy Armenian gentleman and businessman and he is Elizabeth's new lover. Julius successfully manages the stocks Elizabeth inherited from a recently deceased great-aunt and buys her a hat shop in Mayfair's Brook Street to manage. She renames it _Madame Yvonne_. Her parents don't like Julius and they don't want to receive him. To further his influence, Karekin buys the lease on 165 Eaton Place. The £5600 lease is put up for sale upon Lord Southwold's death in 1909. He offers the lease to Elizabeth to help save her parents from eviction. She then gives the deed to her parents. He uses her to further his career and contacts. Owing to Richard Bellamy's connections, he becomes a good friend of Arthur Balfour, a financial adviser to the Tory Party, and a candidate for membership in the exclusive Pall Mall men's club, the Athenaeum.[1]
