History

Grohmann Engineering was founded by Klaus Grohmann in 1963.[5] In November 2016, the company's stakeholders (including the , which owned 25%) agreed to sell the company to American automotive company Tesla Motors.[6] The company had 700 employees at the time.[7] The deal was completed on 3 January 2017, at which point the company employed 800 people.[8]

In April 2017, founder Klaus Grohmann left the company due to a dispute with Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Musk demanded the company halt production for competitors, such as BMW and Daimler AG, to focus on the Model 3.[9]

By discontinuing business relations with all customers except Tesla, the company's union was concerned with wage levels and with jobs in the long term if electric cars did not have the expected success.[10] Tesla then offered Grohmann employees 150 euros a month and employee stock options worth $10,000 with a payout over the following four years, as well as a cash payment of 1000 euros. Tesla did not comment on the required collective agreement.[11] In October 2017, the company agreed with union representatives on a competitive pay structure. According to the chairman of the works council, the future remuneration was at the level of the collective agreement valid for the industry.[12]
