Production

Kodlu Ramkrishna's Very own dream script "March 22" which he was planning to do a movie from long back. He went to Harish Sherigar and narrated the story, who agreed to produce after hearing the detailed script. Harish Sherigar corroborated this by saying that the faith he had in Kodlu Ramkrishna , the story and script of the film, and the opportunity of starting his own production company inspired him to produce _March 22_ Film. After so many preparations the film is launched on 7 November at an 800-year-old heritage residential building located on the outskirts of Belagavi.

Location, language and costume

One of the first members to join the production team was subhas Kadakol, the art director,Mohan MM(DOP),Associate director K Jagadeesh Reddy with whom Kodlu Ramakrishna set out for extensive location hunt throughout North Karnataka, to find the setting for the fictional town in late 1980. After searching through Bijapur, Bagalkot, Hubli & belgavi districts . they zeroed in on an ancient village near chachadi located in Belgavi district, where the film was primarily shot.

The script demanded a dry location: an agricultural village where it had not rained in several years. To depict the 1980s, the crew also required a village which lacked electricity, communication and automobiles.

North Kannada which is a dialect of Kannada Language, is primarily from a region in Karnataka. It was chosen to give the feel of the language spoken during that era. However, the language was diluted, and modern viewers can understand it.

Costume designer spent a lot of time researching to lend authenticity to the characters.
