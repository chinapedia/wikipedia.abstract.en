MOK HING LING (莫慶靈) is a Chinese modern ink painting artist. Mok's artworks weight on the adjustment of nature. She builds up her own particular style and features of paintings and delivers some natural and aesthetic effects by utilizing a brush-like sponge as the depiction instrument. With a decent combination of the recognized methods and a unique impression of nature, her artworks have depicted the nature with creativity.

In 1973, Mok settled in Hong Kong and started her art career. She concentrated on Chinese ink wash painting under Ding Yanyong in the 1970s, and later Cheung Kwan-sut. She has practiced Chinese ink painting for over twenty years. She features in a fusion of different painting styles, which is combining customary painting skills with present-day materials and brushstrokes. Her paintings are mostly landscape paintings. These drawings usually express her thankfulness for nature. Mok took part in the Contemporary Hong Kong Art Biennial Exhibition of 1981 and 1983. Also, her works were displayed in different joint presentations in Australia, Philippines, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, China, and Russia. During the 1990s, her solo exhibitions started to launch in Hong Kong and Canada. Her paintings have once been selected in the 2nd Contemporary Chinese Landscape Painting Exhibition in 1993 and "The 9th National Art Exhibition with a Showcase of Selected Works by Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwanese Artists". She also got an award of the third honor of "Youthful Artist in China" in 1994. Her paintings have also been collected by Taiwan Museum of Art, Jiangsu Provincial Art Museum, Hubei Provincial Museum of Art, He Xiangning Art Museum, and other investors. Mok was once a member of the Hong Kong Modern Ink Painting Society but she faded out in 2005.
