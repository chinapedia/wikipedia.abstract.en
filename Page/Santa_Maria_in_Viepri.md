The abbey of SANTA MARIA DI VIEPRI is a Romanesque, former Benedictine monastery and church outside of the town of Massa Martana, province of Perugia, Umbria, Italy.


History

The church was erected circa 1150 by the lords of Castelvecchio. It was once associated with an adjacent castle and monastery. Construction might have been aided by nearby stones from the Via Flaminia.[1] The stone façade is made of stone bricks with a small mullioned window. A large bell-tower arises next to the façade. The semicircular apses differ, with the center one being less decorated. The church contains some of the Romanesque sculptural elements embedded in the walls. The interior still has three naves, but the pilasters lack capitals. The church houses a _Birth of the Virgin_ and a _Madonna of the Rosary_ painted by Andrea Polinori.[2]
