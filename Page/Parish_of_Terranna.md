The PARISH OF TERRANA is a parish of Argyle County, New South Wales, Australia.[1][2]

The area is similar to the locality of Tirrannaville, which partly lies in the Goulburn Parish.


History

The area was first inhabited by the Gundungurra people,[3][4][5] and by the mid 1840s the NSW colonial government had granted numerous land grants in area, beginning white settlement. A Public School was established in 1869. The area is today predominantly used for agriculture though it lies in the Sydney-Canberra transit corridor.
