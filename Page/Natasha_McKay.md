McKay won the junior bronze medal at the British Championships in the 2009–10 season. In February 2011, she placed 22nd at the European Youth Olympic Festival in Liberec, Czech Republic. She was coached by Yuri Bureiko in Coventry, England.[6]

She won the senior bronze medal at the British Championships in the 2014–15 season and finished 5th the next year.

McKay won gold at the Open d'Andorra in November 2016 and became the British national champion the following month.[8] In January 2017, she took gold at Skate Helena. She was named in the British team to the 2017 European Championships in Ostrava.[9] In the Czech Republic, she ranked 24th in the short program, giving her the final qualifying spot, and then rose to 18th overall by placing 16th in the free skate.

In December 2018, McKay won her third consecutive national title.

At the 2019 World Championships, McKay qualified for the free skate for the first time, and placed twenty-first overall.[10]
