The BALTIMORE UNDERGROUND SCIENCE SPACE (BUGSS) is a non-profit synthetic biology and biotechnology makerspace laboratory for science enthusiasts, hobbyists, and professionals to practice, share and learn about the biological sciences. BUGSS is closely aligned with do-it-yourself biology and the Maryland science community generally, and offers courses and lectures in addition to community lab space.[1][2] It was founded by Dr. Tom Burkett in 2012. It is located in the Highlandtown neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland.[3]

BUGSS has regularly hosted teams for the annual International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition. In 2014, the team focused on 3D bioprinting.[4][5] In 2016, the team worked on isolating the genes in the bacterium _Ideonella sakaiensis_ that allow it to consume the plastic PET, and introducing them into _Escherichia coli_.[6][7]
