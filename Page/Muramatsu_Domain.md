was a _tozama_ feudal domain under the Tokugawa shogunate of Edo period Japan. It was located in Echigo Province, Honshū. The domain was centered at Muramatsu _Jin'ya_ (later renamed Muramatsu Castle), located in what is now part of the city of Gosen in Niigata Prefecture.[1]


History

Upon the death of Hori Naoyori, _daimyō_ of Murakami Domain, a 30,000 _koku_ portion of his holdings was separated out into a separate domain for his younger son, Hori Naotoki. This marked the start of Muramatsu Domain. However, to be more precise, Hori Naotoki built his seat at Yasuda in Echigo Province, and it was not until the time of his son, Hori Naoyoshi, that the _jin'ya_ was moved to Muramatsu. The area of the domain was mostly mountainous and unsuited to the development of new rice lands. Its actual _kokudaka_ was only around 40,000 _koku_. Although Hori Naoyoshi attempted a survey and land reform, he died before it could be completed and the domain was perennially in debt. During the time of the 8th _daimyō_, Hori Naoyasu, some fiscal reforms were initiated, which resulted in a peasant uprising in 1814. During the time of the 9th _daimyō_, Hori Naohide, a more successful reform was implemented, with woven goods, _washi_, green tea, and a form of ceramics known as _Muramatsu-yaki_ developed to supplement the domain's income. The domain was also raised in status from a _jin'ya_ domain to a castle domain in 1850.

During the Bakumatsu period, the samurai of the domain were sharply divided between a conservative faction led by the 11th _daimyō_, Hori Naoyoshi, and a pro-_Sonnō jōi_ faction. During the Boshin War, Hori Naoyoshi led the domain into the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei, but he switched sides after only a few months. In July 1871, with the abolition of the han system, Muramatsu Domain briefly became Muramatsu Prefecture, and was merged into the newly created Niigata Prefecture. Under the new Meiji government, Hori Naohiro, the final _daimyō_ of Muramatsu Domain was given the _kazoku_ peerage title of _shishaku_ (viscount). The site of former Muramatsu Castle is now a park.


Bakumatsu period holdings

As with most domains in the han system, Muramatsu Domain consisted of several discontinuous territories calculated to provide the assigned _kokudaka_, based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields.[2][3]
