FRANTIC ASSEMBLY is a theatre production company. They have worked in around 30 countries[1] and are widely studied as practitioners for A-Levels in the UK.[2] They were founded on the 4th of September in 1994.


Background

Frantic Assembly was formed in 1994 by Scott Graham, Steven Hoggett, and Vicki Middleton, three students from Swansea University. None of the three studied Drama or any of the Arts, but were intrigued by theatre and wanted to create their own unique company.[3] They wished to create non-naturalistic pieces through the use of movement and music, although they have always said that this should never take away from the storyline.[4] Their most notable production, in co-operation with The National Theatre, is THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME which won a Tony award for Best Play in 2016. |n 2016 Frantic Assembly collaborated with State Theatre South Australia and Andrew Bovell to create _Things I Know To Be True._ This toured both Australia (2016) and the UK (2016 and 2017). In 2018, Frantic Assembly launched their podcast the Frantic Assembly Podcast which has had guest appearances from old school teachers of Scott Graham, Simon Stephens and Karl Hyde from Underworld.[5]
