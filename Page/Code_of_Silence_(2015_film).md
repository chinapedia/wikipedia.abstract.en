Production

_Code of Silence_ was produced by the Royal Arts Academy in collaboration with Nollywood Workshop. The second feature picture to be filmed by Emem Isong, she said of her reasoning to shoot the picture: "Sometimes, I do advocacy movies and code of silence is one of such movies. I decided to do a movie on rape to urge people to come out and say ‘NO’ to rape. Let's break the code of silence. We want to break the assumption that the victim is at fault. The story actually found me because my friend brought the story to me and when I read it, I realised that I had a good one. It’s a 20 million budget movie. I decided to work with these cast because I've worked with most of them and I felt they would interprete [sic] the roles properly."[3]

Actress and model Makida Moka found shooting the picture to be an "intense" experience, which traumatised her to the point that she was often in tears after scenes were cut.[4]


Reception

The film premiered on August 8 2015 at Silverbird Galleria, Victoria Island, Lagos, in an event which was well-attended by the stars of the Nollywood industry.[5] The film received acclaim from critics. Toni Kan, writing for _Nigeria Entertainment Today_ remarked that the film "travels considerable distance to encourage the reversal of tendencies like stigma which restrains victims and their families from speaking up when rape occurs", and effectively "speaks to everyone: it addresses the issue of what society loses when women are subjected to forced sex, when we all keep quiet about it and why men should have more respect for themselves by not taking the low bend into being rapists". Despite the trauma of the rape, Kan notes that the film is interspersed with moments of comic relief.[6]
