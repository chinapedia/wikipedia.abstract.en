HILDUR ANDERSEN (25 May 1864 – 20 December 1956) was a Norwegian pianist and music pedagogue.

She was born in Christiania to _stadsingeniør_ Oluf Martin Andersen and Annette Fredrikke Sontum, and was a sister of geographer Aksel Arstal. She made her consert debut in Kristiania in 1886. She is known both as a concert pianist and for her music lectures. She had a close friendship with playwright Henrik Ibsen, and is regarded to be the model for the character "Hilde Wangel" in Ibsen's play _The Master Builder_. She was awarded the King's Medal of Merit in gold in 1924.[1][2]
