SAMANTHA SHANTINI RATNAM (born 1977) is an Australian social worker, politician and the current leader of the Victorian Greens. Since October 2017 Ratnam has been a member of the Victorian Legislative Council, representing the Northern Metropolitan Region. Prior to this she was a councillor and former mayor for the City of Moreland.


Early life

Born in England and raised in Sri Lanka,[1] Samantha Ratnam and her family left the country after the 'Black July' 1983 riots in Colombo that gave rise to 30-year Sri Lankan Civil War between the government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a Tamil separatist group. The family eventually settled in Australia after spending time in Europe and Canada.[2]

From 1995 to 2001 Samantha Ratnam completed a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Social Work (Honours) from the University of Melbourne. She completed in 2015 her Doctor of Philosophy in Youth Sociology – Young People and Citizenship, also from the University of Melbourne.

Ratnam has worked in various roles in assisting migrants and asylum seekers including at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, in the fields of drug and alcohol rehabilitation, mental health and international development.[3]

In April 2014 Samantha Ratnam explained in _The Indian Sun_, an online publication for the Australian-Indian community how she is a product of diaspora and her motivations for entering politics.[4]


Moreland Council

Ratnam first stood for and was elected to the City of Moreland Council for South Ward in 2012 as one of three Ward Councillors.[5] In 2016 she was re-elected with her vote more than doubling to over 55 percent of the ward vote.[6]

In 2015 she was elected by councillors as the first Greens mayor of Moreland for 2016 in a 6 to 5 vote with Independent Councillor Helen Davidson and Socialist Alliance Councillor Sue Bolton supporting her bid for the mayor.[7] Her election as Mayor was even noted in the country of her heritage, Sri Lanka,[8] and by the Indian community in Australia,[9] and in Tamil culture.[10]

In her time on the council, Ratnam was instrumental in removing official council references to Australia Day, saying “this is a gesture of respect and an important step in healing”.[11] Ratnam resigned from the council on 11 October 2017.[12]


2016 Federal election campaign

Ahead of the 2016 federal election the Greens preselected Ratnam to stand in the Division of Wills, where the sitting MP Kelvin Thomson was retiring.[13]

During the election campaign Ratnam was invited as a speaker to address an anti-racism rally in the Victoria Street mall in Coburg. With the threat of violence raised by right-wing groups such as the United Patriots Front organising a counter rally in Bridge Reserve nearby, Ratnam withdrew from attending just two days before the rally.[14] The advertised anti-racism rally occurred without violence, however at Bridge Reserve and on Bell Street, Coburg other left-wing anti-racist protesters confronted the right wing protesters with the police needing to use pepper spray.[15] Subsequently, Ratnam wrote an opinion article for SBS on racism and why she chose not to attend the rally.[16] One of the organisers of the rally, Cr Sue Bolton, also wrote an opinion article on why it was essential for the anti-racism rally to be held, despite right-wing threats to disrupt it and calls by others for council to cancel it.[17]

Although Ratnam substantially increased the Greens vote with a swing greater than 10 percentage points in Wills, the Labor candidate Peter Khalil won the seat with a 4.88 point margin.[18][19]


State politics

Ratnam filled the vacant Legislative Council seat of former Victorian Greens leader Greg Barber, who announced his retirement from politics on 28 September 2017.[20] On 12 October 2017, prior to having officially filled Barber’s seat, Ratnam was appointed leader of the Victorian Greens, becoming the first woman to lead the party at a state level.[21][22] She was officially sworn in as a member of the Legislative Council on 19 October 2017.[23] Ratnam was re-elected in the Northern Metropolitan region at the 2018 state election, though her four party colleagues failed to win back their seats and she became the only Greens member of the Legislative Council.[24]
