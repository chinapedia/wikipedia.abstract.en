The VIOLIN SONATA NO. 5 in F major, Opus 24, is a violin sonata by Ludwig van Beethoven. It is often known as the "Spring Sonata" (_Frühlingssonate_), and was published in 1801. It was dedicated to Count Moritz von Fries, a patron to whom Beethoven also dedicated two other works of the same year—the C major string quintet and the fourth violin sonata—as well as his later seventh symphony.[1]

The work is in four movements:

1.  _Allegro_
2.  _Adagio molto espressivo_
3.  _Scherzo: Allegro molto_
4.  _Rondo: Allegro ma non troppo_

The _Scherzo_ and its trio are particularly brief. The entire sonata takes approximately 22 minutes to perform. The name "Spring Sonata" was given to it after Beethoven's death.

The _Allegro_ movement is featured in the stage show _Fame_ and in the syllabus of grade 8 of ABRSM's bowed strings exam from 2016 till 2019[2].
