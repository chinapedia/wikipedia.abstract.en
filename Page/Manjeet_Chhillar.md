MANJEET CHHILLAR (born 18 August 1986) is an Indian professional kabaddi player, who currently represents Tamil Thalaivas[1] in VIVO Pro Kabaddi. He was a member of the India national kabaddi team and won an Asian games gold medal in 2014 and Asian Indoor Games in 2014 in Incheon. The government of India conferred the Arjuna Award on him for his achievements in sports.[2][3] In an exclusive chat with NNIS Sports, Chhillar termed it as a 'dream' to receive the prestigious award. He was also the member of state team of Haryana and is on top of Pro Kabaddi’s all-time leaderboards for tackle points (302), successful tackles (289) and High 5s (21).[4]


Early life

He was born in Nizampur in Haryana. Manjeet Chhillar was initially a wrestler[5], but an injury to his nose saw him return to his village where he started playing Kabaddi. Manjeet was first seen in professional Kabaddi in the 2010 Asian Games in China.[6]


Kabaddi Career:

PRO KABADDI CAREER

Season 1

He was the captain of Bengaluru Bulls in the first season of VIVO Pro Kabaddi and won them a grand total of 51 tackle points – the highest by any defender – to emerge as the Star Sports Defender of the Tournament. Manjeet’s versatility meant that he also picked up 71 raid points[7] and helped the Bulls reach the semi-finals.[8]

Season 2

Manjeet was adjudged Most Valuable Player (MVP) in Season 2 for his all-round performance. He picked up 40 tackle points and 67 raid points[9] as Bengaluru Bulls finished as runners-up. Like the first season, Manjeet contributed heavily in attack for Bengaluru. Having said that, his defensive displays were top class as well and justifies him being MVP in Season 2. [10]

Season 3

He moved to Puneri Paltan ahead of the third season and was made captain. His performance levels though didn’t drop as he scored 61 tackle points and 45 raid points[11] while leading Pune to a third-placed finish in what was their best season.[12]

Season 4

The fourth edition of Pro Kabaddi saw both Manjeet and Pune fail to better their performance from the previous campaign. He scored only 44 tackle points[13] and 24 raid points as Pune narrowly missed out on the playoffs.[14]

Season 5

In Season 5, Manjeet joined Jaipur Pink Panthers and was made captain again. However, he could manage just 5 raid points and 47 tackle points[15] as the Panthers endured a difficult campaign that saw Manjeet nurse an injury for a long duration.

Season 6

Season 6 saw him move to Tamil Thalaivas after the Tamil Nadu based franchise picked him. Manjeet became a leader in defence for the Thalaivas and scored 59 tackle points[16] as well as 8 raid points.[17]

INTERNATIONAL

Manjeet is a gold medalist in the National Championships in 2010, 2011 and 2012. He has also won gold at the Asian Indoor games in 2009 and the 2010 Asian games. Manjeet claimed bronze at the 2012 Asian Beach Games
