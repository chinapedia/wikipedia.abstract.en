JERVIS COTTONBELLY[1] is a professional wrestling gimmick that has been portrayed by professional wrestler Kevin Condron since its debut in 2005. The character originated in Chikara and has also appeared for several independent promotions including Championship Wrestling from Hollywood.


Professional wrestling career

Chikara (2005–2016)

On September 16, 2005, Cottonbelly made his debut at Chikara's Son of The International Invasion of The International Invaders: Stage I, when he unsuccessfully challenged Larry Sweeney for the ICW-ICWA Texarkana Television Championship.[2] On the following day at Son of The International Invasion of The International Invaders: Stage II, Jervis gained his first victory at Chikara in a tag team match, where he teamed with Shiima Xion to defeat the team of Adam Knight and Dr. Cheung.[3]

Other promotions

Jervis has also competed in other companies and has won several championships. On July 10, 2016, Jervis encountered the reigning Ironman Heavymetalweight Champion, Eli Drake, and started tickling Drake in front of a referee until Drake told the referee to make Jervis stop. As a result of this the referee counting Drake's request as a submission, Jervis was declared the new Ironman Heavymetalweight Champion.[4] Later on that same day, Jervis surrendered the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship to Joey Ryan when Ryan requested Jervis trade the championship for the two women that Ryan had with him.[5]

On March 13, 2017, Cottonbelly acted as a marriage counselor to Laura James and her husband, Joey Ryan, who was the reigning WrestleCircus Sideshow Champion at the time. Due to the title having a "24/7" rule, Jervis asked Laura to put on a referee shirt for a counseling "exercise", and then tricked Ryan into saying "I submit" while giving him a hug, which resulted in Jervis winning the Sideshow Championship.[6]
