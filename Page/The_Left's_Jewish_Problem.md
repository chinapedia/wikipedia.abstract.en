_THE LEFT'S JEWISH PROBLEM: JEREMY CORBYN, ISRAEL AND ANTI‑SEMITISM_ is a 2016 book by British author Dave Rich.[1] The book argues that new antisemitism is "masked as anti-Zionism" in left-wing politics.[2]

Rich began writing the book in 2011 as his doctoral thesis at Birkbeck, University of London[3][4] and his studies were funded by his employer, the Community Security Trust.[5]

The book received positive reviews from sympathetic co-religionists. Nick Cohen described the book as an "authoritative history of left antisemitism;"[6] Leslie Wagner described it as "an important one that should be read by all those seeking to understand the New Left’s obsession with anti-Zionism and its inability to recognize, let alone deal with, its own antisemitism";[7] and Benjamin Ramm wrote that "...as a guide to a contemporary malady that is undermining the integrity of the left, Rich’s book is essential reading"[8]


Beginning of New Left antisemitism

Rich traces the origin of what he believes to be contemporary left-wing anti-Semitic anti-Israel rhetoric and of antisemitism in the Labour Party to the early 1970s, when Peter Hain and Louis Eaks of the Young Liberals wing of the Liberal Party reconceptualized the national liberation movement of the Jewish people as an colonialist and imperialist project imposing apartheid on the indigenous Palestinian people. Rich argues Anti-Zionism turned into Antisemitism and how is used to hide it under the guise of the first.[9]
