Campaign

At 39 years of age, Ray Mabus defeated Tupelo businessman Jack Reed in the 1987 gubernatorial election by 53% to 47%, becoming the youngest governor in the United States. He won "on a wave of black votes" (black voters made up about 30 percent of the state's registered voters)[1] and lost the white vote "by about 3 to 2" despite support from what a coalition one Democratic state chairman described as "poor whites" and yuppies.[2] Mabus, who ran on the slogan "Mississippi Will Never Be Last Again",[3] was billed as "the face of the New South", much like his counterpart in Arkansas at the time, Bill Clinton. Mabus was featured in a 1988 _New York Times Magazine_ cover story titled "The Yuppies of Mississippi; How They Took Over the Statehouse".[4]
