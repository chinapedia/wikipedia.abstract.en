GNAEUS OGULNIUS was a Roman magistrate in the early 3rd century BC.

He was from the Plebeian class. Livy accused Gnaeus and his brother, the Tribune Quintus Ogulnius, of cravenly pandering to the lower classes with their proposal to increase the number of high priests and priests of the augurs, and to allow plebes to hold these offices for the first time (the proposal was dubbed the "Ogulnia Law").[1] During their career, they combated usury.[2]

He was Curule Aedile in 296 BC when the brothers erected a statue of the she-wolf and the divine twins Romulus and Remus on the site of Rome's Sacred Fig Tree.[3]
