_CITRINE_ is the third extended play (EP) by American singer and actress Hayley Kiyoko. It was released on September 30, 2016 through Empire Distribution and Atlantic Records.[1]


Background

The EP is called _Citrine_ because the artist wears a citrine crystal, which she believes is of benefit to her wellbeing.[2]


Composition

The EP has a total duration of 18 minutes and 33 seconds. The project is described as "[a collection of] electropop love songs."[3] Kiyoko named the release of it as the moment where she really felt she found her sound and who she was.[4] During an interview, Kiyoko stated that the opening track and lead single on the EP, "Gravel to Tempo" is about "realizing that the only validation you need in life is from yourself," and that she chose high school as the setting because "it's a pivotal moment in [one's] life where [one] naturally develop[s] insecurities."[5] "Pretty Girl", one of Kiyoko's favorite songs on the release, describes her at appreciating how beautiful a girl who comes across is, something she wouldn't share in real life,[6] while "Palace", the final track on the EP, was referred as the most powerful song, lyrically, in which, the theme is mourning someone's loss positively.[7]
