CHARLES ALEXANDER LOCKHART ROBERTSON (4 April 1825 – 18 May 1897), best known as C. LOCKHART ROBERTSON, was a Scottish asylum doctor and spiritualist.

He was born in Edinburgh, the son of John Argyll Robertson, President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. His younger brother, Douglas Argyll Robertson, became a distinguished ophthalmic surgeon. He studied Medicine at Caius College, Cambridge where he earned his M.D. in 1856. Lockhart Robertson worked as the superintendent of the Sussex County Asylum at Haywards Heath from 1859 to 1870, and in 1860 he also served as Linacre demonstrator of Anatomy at Oxford University. In 1870, he was appointed Lord Chancellor's medical visitor and he held this position till 1896. He was the honorary secretary of the Medico-Psychological Association and edited the _Journal of Mental Science_.[1][2][3][4] Lockhart Robertson's translation of Griesinger's _Mental Pathology_ (undertaken in conjunction with James Rutherford) is a valuable addition to the professional literature. Robertson did not publish widely but his achievements in enlightened asylum administration attracted professional admiration across Europe.

Lockhart Robertson, originally a skeptic in the 1850s, became a convinced spiritualist in 1860 after attending a séance with the medium Daniel Dunglas Home.[5] He was a founding member of the Society for Psychical Research.[6] He died at Exmouth.
