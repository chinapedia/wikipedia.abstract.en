Personal life

Crabtree attended Stonyhurst College.[4] On 5 September 1914, a matter of days after the outbreak of the First World War, Crabtree enlisted as a private in the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment.[5] Just over a year later, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant.[6] Crabtree was wounded near Morval during the Battle of the Somme in September 1916 and saw further action at Arras and Passchendaele after his recovery.[7] He won a Military Cross for "conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty" on 26 September 1917.[8] A month later, he was wounded for a second time and wouldn't serve on the Western Front for the remainder of the war.[9] After being promoted to captain, Crabtree was posted briefly to Central Asia before leaving the army.[10]
