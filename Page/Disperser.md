A DISPERSER is a one-sided extractor.[1] Where an extractor requires that every event gets the same probability under the uniform distribution and the extracted distribution, only the latter is required for a disperser. So for a disperser, an event A ⊆ {0, 1}^(m) we have: Pr_(U_(m))[A] > 1 − ϵ

DEFINITION (DISPERSER): _A_ (k, ϵ)_-disperser is a function_

Dis : {0, 1}^(n) × {0, 1}^(d) → {0, 1}^(m)

_such that for every distribution_ X _on_ {0, 1}^(n) _with_ H_(∞)(X) ≥ k _the support of the distribution_ Dis(X, U_(d)) _is of size at least_ (1 − ϵ)2^(m).


Graph theory

An (_N_, _M_, _D_, _K_, _E_)-DISPERSER is a bipartite graph with _N_ vertices on the left side, each with degree _D_, and _M_ vertices on the right side, such that every subset of _K_ vertices on the left side is connected to more than (1 − _e_)_M_ vertices on the right.

An extractor is a related type of graph that guarantees an even stronger property; every (_N_, _M_, _D_, _K_, _E_)-EXTRACTOR is also an (_N_, _M_, _D_, _K_, _E_)-DISPERSER.


Other meanings

A disperser is a high-speed mixing device used to disperse or dissolve pigments and other solids into a liquid.
