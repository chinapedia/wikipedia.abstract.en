Political career

Chou began his political career as party spokesman, for the Kuomintang as a whole and specifically for the party's Culture and Communications Affairs Committee,[3][4] later rising to assistant director of the committee.[5] Chou then represented Lien Chan and James Soong, who fielded a joint ticket in the 2004 presidential elections.[6][7] Chou was first elected to the Legislative Yuan in that year's legislative elections,[8][9] despite the loss of the Pan-Blue coalition's presidential ticket. During his first legislative term, Chou supported stringent monitoring of Taiwan's foreign aid budget as a buffer against checkbook diplomacy.[10] He also brought attention to weakening infrastructure[11] and multiple nationwide violations of the School Health Act, calling out educational institutions that did not employ the number of nutritionists the law required.[12] Chou led allegations of forgery against National Taiwan Normal University president Huang Kuan-tsae in 2005.[13] In 2006, the Kuomintang Youth Corps was established. Chou contested the organization's top leadership position, and lost to Lin Yi-shih.[14][15] Later that year Chou voiced public support for Taipei mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who was under investigation for corruption.[16] In August 2007, Ma was found not guilty.[17]

Chou won reelection to the legislature in 2008 while serving as Ma's presidential campaign manager.[18][19] In his second term, Chou was rated highly by the Citizen Congress Watch.[20][21] Legislative positions he held during this time included deputy secretary general of the KMT caucus.[22][23] Chou also led the Foreign and National Defense Committee with Chang Hsien-yao.[24][25][26] Chou visited Nicuragua in May 2009, as part of a government delegation led by Ma.[27] Chou backed Chang in his bid for the Kaohsiung mayoralty in 2010.[28] Later that year, the murder of Weng Chi-nan was solved when the suspect sought Chou out and asked him to arrange terms of surrender.[29]

Chou faced Chen Yu-mei in a party primary during his second reelection bid until she dropped out April 2011.[30] Chou subsequently lost the 2012 election to Pasuya Yao.[31]

As a legislator, Chou was involved in issues pertaining to education,[32][33] the foreign relations of Taiwan,[34][35] immigration,[36] and public safety.[37] He has repeatedly criticized China for its suppression of Taiwan on the international stage.[38][39][40]


Career in entertainment

Chou has also been active in the entertainment industry as a singer and film director.[41][42] He helped cast Wei Te-sheng's 2011 film _Seediq Bale_ by working with the Ministry of National Defense to ensure aboriginal members of the military could take time off to appear on screen.[43]


Personal

Chou is married to television presenter Wang Yung-ho.[44] Wang was selected to the National Communications Commission in 2012, but review of her nomination was continually stalled in the legislature.[45][46]
