Plot

Radhika (Kushboo) is an honest government employee and she is in charge of the food ration shop. She is then transferred to a remote village. In the village, everything goes well until the release from jail of the dreaded Rajappa (Napoleon) who spent 5 years in jail. Rajappa is known to be a dangerous man who sold illicit arrack and raped the village girls. Half of the villagers flee the village and they settle down in the nearby village. The village police Inspector (Ajay Rathnam) wants to send Rajappa back in jail.

Upon his arrival at the village, Rajappa rapes the poor Radhika. Much to his surprise, Radhika challenges him to change him as a good man. Later, Radhika becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl. When Radhika names her daughter as Sivagami, Rajappa turns berserk (Sivagami was his mother's name). Radhika tells him his past and his mother's past.

When Rajappa was a school student, he was brainwashed by the illicit arrack seller Uthamarasa (Raviraj) and he began to sell his illicit products. His mother Sivagami (Sathyapriya) and his sister left him and started a new life in Sivakasi, his sister got married and had a girl : Radhika. Many years later, Rajappa's mother Sivagami and his niece Radhika came to see Rajappa during the village festival. His mother strongly believed that he had changed and became a good man. But Rajappa became a womanizer and a dreaded arrack seller. At the festival, he got into a fight with the local arrack merchants and killed them all.
