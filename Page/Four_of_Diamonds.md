FOUR OF DIAMONDS are a British girl group composed of Caroline Alvares, Lauren Rammell, Sophia Saffarian and Yasmin Broom.[1] In 2016, they competed in the thirteenth series of _The X Factor_, where they finished in eighth place.[2] In 2018, they were signed to Virgin EMI Records.[3]


Career

2016–2017: _The X Factor_

Four of Diamonds auditioned for _The X Factor_ in the third set of room auditions, performing "No" by Meghan Trainor. They then progressed to bootcamp and the six-chair challenge, gaining a seat and making it through to judges' house. They were eventually sent home by Louis Walsh.[4] However, on 10 October 2016, it was announced that Four of Diamonds would take Brooks Way's place for the remainder of the live shows, starting in week 2.[5]

In week three, Four of Diamonds were in the bottom two against Relley C. They sang "Who Are You" by Fifth Harmony and were saved by Walsh, Nicole Scherzinger and Simon Cowell. Voting statistics revealed that Relley C received more votes than Four of Diamonds in the main vote, meaning if Cowell sent the result to deadlock, Relley C would’ve been saved. The following week, they were in the bottom two against Gifty Louise; they sang "The Voice Within" by Christina Aguilera and were saved by Walsh, Scherzinger and Sharon Osbourne. Once again, Four of Diamonds came behind Louise in the main public vote meaning that if Osbourne sent the result to deadlock, Louise would’ve been saved. They were sent home on week 5, after a sing-off against Saara Aalto, when only Walsh voted to save them. In this sing-off, they sang "When You Believe" by Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey. However, voting statistics revealed that Four of Diamonds and Aalto received more votes than Sam Lavery in the public main vote; meaning if there wasn't a lifeline vote, or if Aalto won the lifeline vote, Four of Diamonds would’ve competed against Lavery in the final showdown instead of Aalto. Additionally, in that scenario, if the result went to deadlock, Four of Diamonds would've been saved and Lavery would've been eliminated.[6]

Following the conclusion of the series, the final eight contestants co-headlined _The X Factor_ Live Tour around in 2017.[7][8] As part of this concert tour, Four of Diamonds performed to over 200,000 people across the United Kingdom.[9][10]

On 14 June 2018, Four of Diamonds released their debut single, "Name On It", featuring Burna Boy.[11] On 28 September 2018, they released their second single, titled "Stupid Things", featuring Saweetie.[12] On 30 November 2018, their third single, “Blind” was released. The song samples “Too Blind to See It” by Kym Sims, and was produced by Jonas Blue. Blue has also been confirmed as the executive producer of their debut album.[13] Later that month, they held a three-date concert tour across England, visiting Birmingham, Manchester and London.[14]

On 17 May 2019, the group released their fourth single, "Walk Away",[15][16] with their debut album expected to be released later in 2019.[17][18] In an interview with Coup De Main, they revealed that both Rihanna and Zara Larsson recorded demos for "Walk Away", but the song was given to Four of Diamonds.[19] The single was supported by a concert held in London.[20] Later that month, it was announced that Four of Diamonds were set to support Rita Ora on the Phoenix World Tour across the United Kingdom.[21][22] After their performance at the O2 Arena, Philip Logan wrote that "the four girls sparked an energy in the room that would only build and grow as the night went on", and that "commanding the audiences attention with immediate effect, the girls made the O2 stage their own – performing a strong set complete with slick choreography, tight vocal harmonies and killer tunes. With a confidence and chemistry that most girl bands can only dream of, there’s a genuine and undeniable sense of camaraderie between the ladies as they perform, so powerful that it translates from the stage right into the audience creating a visceral connection between them and their fans."[23]

On 30 May 2019, they performed "Walk Away" on _Blue Peter_, and the next day, they appeared as the musical guest on _Britain's Got More Talent_.[24] In July 2019, they performed at Bristol Pride, and later performed at their first headline show, at Borderline, London.[25] In August 2019, they will perform as a musical guest at BBC's Summer Social event in Liverpool.[26][27]
