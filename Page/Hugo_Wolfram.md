Biography

Hugo Wolfram was born in Germany, emigrating to England in 1933.[5] When World War II broke out, young Hugo left school at 15 and subsequently found it hard to get a job since he was regarded as an "enemy alien." As an adult, he took correspondence courses in philosophy and psychology.[6]
