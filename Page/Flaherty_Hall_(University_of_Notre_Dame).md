Features

The building was built in the neo-gothic style used for other recent constructions at Notre Dame. The chapel is visible from the outside, unlike many other dorms whose chapel is inside the building. The chapel is named after Mary, Queen of Angels.[11] Flaherty Hall is approximately 71,000 square feet.[12] Student rooms will host 226 students, and rooms feature singles, doubles, quads. Half of each first floor is devoted to community spaces, featuring a two-story floor lounge, reading room, and study areas.[13] Additional space will include pass-through floor lounges on the second, third and fourth floors, designed to promote gathering in community. The building has full kitchens adjoined to the lounge on every floor.[14]

It opened in the fall of 2016, and it hosted the community incoming from Pangborn Hall. The colors, Lavender and Navy, and mascot, Bears, were chosen by popular vote by the residents.[15]
