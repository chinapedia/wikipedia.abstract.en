RICHARD CHARLAND (born September 26, 1956) is a Canadian semi-retired professional wrestler.


Professional wrestling career

1970s

Richard Charland became a wrestler with the encouragement by Mad Dog Vachon. The mat legend had met Charland, as a youngster, who was studying judo, and told him to consider professional wrestling as an option. Charland listened, and took up amateur wrestling for a few years before turning pro in 1972, at the young age of 16. He debuted in the Montreal-based Grand Prix Wrestling, and beat Pat Gerard Jr. in his first match.

In 1974, he wrestled his first overseas tour for International Wrestling Enterprise in Japan, under the name The Tempest. In 1975, he would move to Toronto, to wrestle for Maple Leaf Wrestling. After a year in Toronto, he went to the United States in 1976, wrestling for The Sheik's Big Time Wrestling in Detroit, under the name Mauler Malone. He would remain in Detroit for nearly two years, before returning home to Montreal in 1977, aside from a brief return to Detroit in 1979.

1980s

In 1980, Charland joined the upstart Lutte Internationale in Montreal. Soon after, he won his first title, the Canadian International Tag Team Championship, with Len Shelley. A year later, he and Shelley would lose the titles to Swede Hanson and Le Bourreau, but regained the titles the next year. However, their second reign wouldn't last as long as their first, as they lost the titles months later to Gino Brito and Rick McGraw.

In 1984, Charland would return to Japan to wrestle for the shoot-style UWF. While there, he would wrestle the likes of Mach Hayato, Rusher Kimura, Ryuma Go, Kazuo Yamazaki, and Super Tiger. After a single tour, he returned home to Montreal.

In May 1985, Charland won his third Canadian International Tag Team title, this time with King Tonga. However, his reign lasted over two weeks, before losing them to The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers. In August 1985, he wrestled a World Wrestling Federation house show in Toronto, losing to Dino Bravo. In October 1986, he regained the Canadian International Tag Team title for the fourth time, this time with Sheik Ali. His reign would last nearly four months, before losing them to Armand Rougeau and Dan Kroffat. Two months later, he regained the titles for the fifth and final time, with Chuck Simms. He and Simms would be the final champions, as Lutte Internationale closed down in June 1987.

Charland would join the WWF on shows throughout the United States and Canada for nearly three years, until May 1990.

1990s and beyond

In August 1990, he returned to Japan to wrestle a tour for All Japan Pro Wrestling. While there, he primarily teamed up with Eric Embry, Rip Morgan, and The Trooper. After the tour, he returned to Montreal to wrestle its independent circuit and also was french commentator with Marc Blondin for WCW . In late 1991, Charland adopted the moniker "Blast", in an attempt to resurrect the Demolition name and gimmick, with Bill Eadie as Ax, but were eventually sent a cease and desist letter by the WWF.

After 1991, Charland began to cut back on his wrestling schedule, as he began working in construction, but still remained semi-active. In February 1994, he wrestled a WWF house show in Toronto, losing to Owen Hart. In July 1995, he wrestled a couple independent shows, wrestling Abdullah The Butcher. In April 1997, he wrestled a Montreal house show for World Championship Wrestling, teaming with Jacques Comptois in a loss to Martin and Serge Rolland. In 1999, Charland joined Jacques Rougeau's Lutte Internationale 2000, where he remained active until the promotion's closure in 2003.
