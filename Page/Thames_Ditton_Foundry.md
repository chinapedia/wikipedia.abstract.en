Burton (right) at Thames Ditton – May 28th, 1921]] The THAMES DITTON FOUNDRY was a foundry in Thames Ditton in Surrey which operated from 1874 to 1939 and which under various owners produced numerous major statues and monuments as one of the United Kingdom's leading firms of bronze founders.[1]


Owners

Located in Summer Road in Thames Ditton just outside the Greater London area, the Thames Ditton Foundry is believed to have been built on the site of an historic ‘melting house’ beside the River Thames. Its owners were: Cox & Sons (1874–80), Drew & Co (1880–82), Moore & Co (1882–97), Hollinshead & Burton (1897–1902) and A.B. Burton (1902–39).[2]


Works by the foundry (1874–1903)

OConnellMonument.JPG in Dublin by Thomas Brock (1881)]] The foundry was established in Summer Road, Thames Ditton, in 1874 by Cox & Sons, a large firm of ecclesiastical furnishing suppliers, to cast ornaments and statues in bronze. A hand operated gantry crane, which moved the entire foundry floor to facilitate all major lifting work, was an integral part of the building constructed for this work. When the factory was demolished in 1976 this crane was preserved by Surrey Archaeological Society.

The foundry was a leader in its field and produced fine bronze statues which it exported worldwide, including Matthew Noble's statue of Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby, in Parliament Square (1874), Thomas Thornycroft's equestrian statue of Richard Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo for Calcutta (1875), Matthew Noble's Oliver Cromwell in Manchester (1875) and his Robert Peel in Parliament Square (1876), Thomas Brock's William Rathbone in Liverpool, George E. Ewing’s Robert Burns (1876), Frederic Leighton's _An Athlete wrestling with a Python_ (1877), John Mossman’s David Livingstone (1877), Thomas Woolner’s John Stuart Mill (1877) on the Victoria Embankment and Captain James Cook in Sydney, Australia (1878), Richard Belt’s Lord Byron at Hyde Park (1880), Thomas Brock’s Robert Raikes in the Victoria Embankment Gardens (1880) and Daniel O’Connell in Dublin (1881), William Hamo Thornycroft's statues of General Gordon and related reliefs in the Victoria Embankment Gardens (1888) and John Bright in Rochdale (1891).[3]

Other works by the foundry include Joseph Edgar Boehm's statues of Lord Lawrence in Waterloo Place (1882), Francis Drake in Tavistock (1882–3), William Tyndale in the Victoria Embankment Gardens (1884), The Duke of Wellington in Hyde Park Corner (1884–8), Queen Victoria in Sydney (1885–8), and the equestrian Prince Albert in Windsor Great Park (1890), among others. They cast Thomas Brock’s Sir Bartle Frere in the Victoria Embankment Gardens (1888), Thomas Woolner's Bishop Dr James Fraser in Albert Square, Manchester (1888), George Anderson Lawson’s Robert Burns in Ayr (1891), Albert Toft’s Henry Richard in Tregaron (1893) and Frederick William Pomeroy's statue of Queen Victoria in Chester Castle (1903).


A.B. Burton

A_B_Burton_Family_Grave.jpg From 1902 to 1933 the Thames Ditton Foundry came under the sole ownership of Arthur Brian Burton (1860–25 July 1933), the son of Eliza and Frederick Burton, a carpenter and joiner. Born in Surbiton, aged 16 Burton was apprenticed to the Bronze Foundry of Cox & Sons in Thames Ditton.[4] Burton later opened his own foundry in Southsea Road, Kingston before buying into the Thames Ditton Foundry in 1897, becoming the co-owner with Arthur John Hollinshead. In 1887 he married Florence Louisa Moore (1859–1932), the daughter of the foundry’s then owner, James John Moore. Button's daughter, also named Florence, married Louis Richard Tricker (1884–1963) in 1913. A younger daughter, Dorothy 'Dolly' Frances Victoria Burton (1893–1908) died aged 14.[5][6]

Following the death of his partner Arthur John Hollinshead in 1902 Burton became the sole owner of the Thames Ditton Foundry. He served as a councillor on Surbiton Council, was a deacon of Surbiton Park Congregational Church, was a Sunday school teacher and a benefactor of the Scout Movement. He was a Special Constable during World War I.[7][8][9][10] On his death in 1933 Burton was buried with his daughter Dolly and his wife Florence in Bonner Hill Cemetery. Above their grave atop a granite plinth is a statue in bronze of a winged angel with arms outstretched reaching up. This had been cast in Burton's own foundry.[11]

After Burton’s death the business was continued under his name by his son-in-law, Louis Tricker. In 1939 at the start of World War II Tricker closed the foundry and sold the premises rather than see it used for manufacturing munitions. It was after used by London Metal Warehouses for making industrial castings and then by Metal Centres Ltd as a metal warehouse until 1971/2 when it was sold to the District Council. The foundry was demolished in 1976 and the crane removed for preservation by the Surrey Archaeological Society. Today Burton Court stands on the site.[12][13][14]
