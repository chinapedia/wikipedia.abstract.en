Travelling to the 2015 Maadi Cup, two of his rowers were involved in a security breach at Auckland Airport. St Bede's headmaster stood the rowers down from the regatta and Lindstrom had a public fallout with the headmaster over the affair. It resulted in him resigning as rowing coach at St Bede's, but he was also dumped by RNZ as a junior selector.[10][11] Lindstrom was coaching the Wanganui Collegiate School rowing club, and provided results to the school within his first year of coaching.[12] Lindstrom is now head coach of the Christchurch Girls' High School rowing club.
