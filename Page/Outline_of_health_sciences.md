The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to health sciences:

HEALTH SCIENCES – are those sciences which focus on health, or health care, as core parts of their subject matter. Because these two subject matter relate to multiple academic disciplines, both STEM disciplines as well as emerging patient safety disciplines (such as social care research) are relevant to current health scientific knowledge.

Health sciences knowledge bases are currently diverse, with intellectual foundations which are sometimes mutually-inconsistent. There is currently an existing bias in the field, towards high valuation of knowledge deriving from CONTROLLING views on human agency (as epitomized by the epistemological basis of Randomized Control Trial designs); compare this against the more NATURALISTIC views on human agency taken by research based on Ethnography for example).
