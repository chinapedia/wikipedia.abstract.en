tried to represent "an infinite scream passing through nature" in _The Scream_ (1893).]]

ANGST means fear or anxiety (_anguish_ is its Latinate equivalent, and _anxious,_ _anxiety_ are of similar origin). The dictionary definition for angst is a feeling of anxiety, apprehension, or insecurity.[1] The word _angst_ was introduced into English from the Danish, Norwegian, and Dutch word and the German word . It is attested since the 19th century in English translations of the works of Kierkegaard and Freud.[2][3][4] It is used in English to describe an intense feeling of apprehension, anxiety, or inner turmoil.

In other languages, having the meaning of the Latin word for "fear", the derived words differ in meaning; for example, as in the French and . The word _angst_ has existed since the 8th century, from the Proto-Indo-European root __, "restraint" from which Old High German developed.[5] It is pre-cognate with the Latin , "tensity, tightness" and , "choking, clogging"; compare to the Ancient Greek () "strangle".


Existentialist angst

In Existentialist philosophy, the term _angst_ carries a specific conceptual meaning. The use of the term was first attributed to Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855). In _The Concept of Anxiety_ (also known as _The Concept of Dread_, depending on the translation), Kierkegaard used the word _Angest_ (in common Danish, _angst_, meaning "dread" or "anxiety") to describe a profound and deep-seated condition. Where non-human animals are guided solely by instinct, said Kierkegaard, human beings enjoy a freedom of choice that we find both appealing and terrifying.[6][7] It is the anxiety of understanding of being free when considering undefined possibilities of one's life and one's power of choice over them.[8][9] Kierkegaard's concept of angst reappeared in the works of existentialist philosophers who followed, such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Martin Heidegger, each of whom developed the idea further in individual ways. While Kierkegaard's angst referred mainly to ambiguous feelings about moral freedom within a religious personal belief system, later existentialists discussed conflicts of personal principles, cultural norms, and existential despair. , _Angst_, 1989]]


Music

Existential angst makes its appearance in classical musical composition in the early twentieth century as a result of both philosophical developments and as a reflection of the war-torn times. Notable composers whose works are often linked with the concept include Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss (operas _Elektra_ and _Salome_), Claude-Achille Debussy (opera _Pelleas et Melisande_, ballet _Jeux_, other works), Jean Sibelius (especially the Fourth Symphony), Arnold Schoenberg _(A Survivor from Warsaw_, other works), Alban Berg, Francis Poulenc (opera _Dialogues of the Carmelites_), Dmitri Shostakovich (opera _Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District_, symphonies and chamber music), Béla Bartók (opera _Bluebeard's Castle_, other works), and Krzysztof Penderecki (especially _Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima_).

Angst began to be discussed in reference to popular music in the mid- to late 1950s amid widespread concerns over international tensions and nuclear proliferation. Jeff Nuttall's book _Bomb Culture_ (1968) traced angst in popular culture to Hiroshima. Dread was expressed in works of folk rock such as Bob Dylan's _Masters of War_ (1963) and _A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall_. The term often makes an appearance in reference to punk rock, grunge, nu metal, and works of emo where expressions of melancholy, existential despair, or nihilism predominate.
