_VERTICORDIA_ SECT. _CORYMBIFORMIS_ is one of eleven sections in the subgenus _Verticordia_. It includes five species of plants in the genus _Verticordia_. Plants in this section are mostly compact shrubs tall with a constricted floral cup, fringed or divided sepal lobes and dense heads of small flowers.[1] When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991 he formally described this section, publishing the description in the journal Nuytsia.[2][3] The name _Corymbiformis_ is derived from the Latin word _corymbus_ meaning "a bunch of flowers"[4] and the suffix _-formis_ meaning "shaped"[5] referring to the flower arrangement of the species in this section.[6]

The type species for this section is _Verticordia brownii_ and the other four species are _V. polytricha_, _V. densiflora_, _V. eriocephala_ and _V. capillaris_.[7]
