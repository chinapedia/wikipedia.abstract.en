ST BARNABAS' CHURCH, WOODFORD GREEN is a Church of England church in Snakes Lane East, Woodford, London[1]. It had its origins in a 1904 iron mission church - this was attached to St Paul's Church, Woodford.[2] A permanent church was built between 1910 and 1911, with a lady chapel, organ chamber, chancel and two bays of an aisled nave - the nave was completed in 1964. The church was designed by E T Dunn, who also designed St Luke's Church, Ilford[3] and produced a proposed design for a new chapel screen at St Peter's Church, Bethnal Green.[4] Parts of the parishes of St Paul's, All Saints Church, Woodford Wells and Holy Trinity Church, South Woodford were combined to form the new parish of St Barnabas in 1911.
