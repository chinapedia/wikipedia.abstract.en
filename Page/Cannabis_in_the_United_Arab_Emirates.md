CANNABIS IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES is illegal. Even the smallest amounts of the drug can lead to a mandatory four-year prison sentence.[1]


Economy

The UAE is not a significant cannabis producer or consumer, but is a major transshipment point for cannabis from Pakistan and Afghanistan, due to its free ports and heterogeneous population.[2]
