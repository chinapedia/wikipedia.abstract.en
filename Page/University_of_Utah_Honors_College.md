Academics

The Honors College’s curriculum is designed to support broad liberal arts education and engaged learning experiences.[7] 

Admissions

Admission to the Honors College is highly competitive, based on a holistic process considering students’ application essays, high school GPA, and SAT/ACT scores. As of 2016, incoming Honors students had an average unweighted GPA of 3.9 and average ACT scores of 30. Most Honors students receive scholarship support, either directly from the University of Utah or the Honors College.[8]

Eccles Scholarship

The Eccles Scholarship integrates students into a unique academic community supported by faculty and alumni. Students accepted into this program—30 per year—participate in a selective cohort experience during their time as undergraduate Honors students. Eccles Scholars begin by taking a yearlong class that introduces first-year students to the potential of gaining a truly rich undergraduate education at The University of Utah and starts them on a path towards developing themselves as ethical leaders. During the first year students live together in the Donna Garff Marriott Honors Residential Community as part of a living learning community. Additionally, students take a series of cohort classes together during their time at the University, including a Reacting to the Past Intellectual Traditions course taught by award-winning professor, Dr. Ann Engar.

Courses

Honors students must complete eight honors courses to complete their Honors bachelor's degree. This includes two Intellectual Traditions courses, one Honors Writing, one Honors Science, three Honors Electives, and a thesis course. Electives can be major specific or fulfill other university general requirements.[9][10] Honors electives cover a range of topics but concentrate in three thematic areas of Health & Society, Energy & Environment, and Policy & Social Justice.[11] A majority of Honors courses, both elective and core, fulfill other University of Utah general education and bachelor requirements.[12]

Ecology and Legacy Integrated Minor

The Honors College also offers a unique minor exclusively for Honors students, the Ecology and Legacy Integrated Minor. Over three semesters, students take 18-credit hours of intensive work in which they use science, arts and the humanities to critically think about interactions between humans and their world. A majority of the course work takes place in field sites. Past locations have included the Great Salt Lake; Centennial Valley, Montana; and the Peninsula Valdes in Patagonia.[13][14]

Thesis Project

All Honors Degree recipients at the University of Utah complete an Honors Thesis Project. Led by an Honors Faculty Mentor in their chosen discipline, theses consist of new primary research conducted by the student. Thesis Projects vary between disciplines and range from research papers to creative projects.[15][16][17][18][19][20]

Honors students have the option to live in Honors specific housing in the Donna Garff Marriott Honors Residential Scholars Community (MHC), Fort Douglas Officer’s Circle houses or Sage Point residence halls, but can also apply to live in any other on-campus housing provided by the University of Utah.[21][22][23] The MHC provides options for private single rooms and double rooms. All rooms are apartment-style, where students share a common living room, kitchen, and two bathrooms. Located directly in front of a UTA TRAX light rail stop, the MHC provides students access to downtown Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City International Airport, and the Salt Lake City Public Library, among other nearby destinations.[24]
