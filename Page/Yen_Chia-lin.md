YEN JIÄ€-LIN (), also known as Benjamin Yen (1890-1960) was the founder of Scouting in China.[1] He studied at Boone Seminary and became an ordained minister in 1916. He studied at Springfield College and graduated in 1926. He returned to China and served as the headmaster for Boone College, an American-style preparatory high school affiliated with Yale. He later traveled to New York and Washington, D.C. for the 1935 Boy Scout Jamboree

Following the birth of the Republic of China, the first Scout troop was organized by Yen Chia-lin in Wuchang, Hubei on February 25, 1912 and the Scouting movement spread rapidly all over the country.[2]
