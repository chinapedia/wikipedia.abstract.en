Plot

The film begins with Neelima (Aditi Sharma), a student pursuing her bachelor's degree taking a strong decision to avoid boys who try to develop a relationship with her. She randomly selects a name, _Rajesh_ and she announces the whole college that she is in love with Rajesh just to keep the boys at bay. She takes this decision because her elder sister _Bhramaramba_ was cheated by a person named Munna in the name of love. She had to marry someone else at an early age and suffer because of that. So she does not want to become like her sister.

Balaraju (Uday Kiran) comes from a village to his sister's house in Hyderabad to study B.A, as it was a prerequisite for his village president post which he desperately want to win. He is a shy person and is treated badly by the fellow students. Initially Balaraju want to go back to his village but he wants to fight back. He meets Neelima in the college. He changes his style, and attitude with the help of Neelima and his six year old nephew. Though she talks to him frequently, she is cautious not to get too close with him. Sometimes she uses the name Rajesh just to avoid him. Balaraju also pretends that he is in love with another fictitious lady called Lavanya. After some time they come to know about their real feelings and start liking each other.

Suddenly a person by name Rajesh appears before Neelima and ask her to marry. She is surprised to see Rajesh whose name she just used to escape from boys who tries to befriend her. The rest of the film is about how Balaraju and Neelima unite.
