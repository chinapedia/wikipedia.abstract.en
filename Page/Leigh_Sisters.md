The LEIGH SISTERS was a vaudeville act at the end of the 19th century in the United States.

The sisters were Edna and Stella Leigh who danced in a saucy style,[1] exposing their legs more than was usual in those times.[2] They were filmed by Alfred Clark for two Kinetoscope productions â€“ _Acrobatic Dance_ and _Umbrella Dance_[3] in 1895. The films were hand coloured so we know that they were blondes, the umbrella was purple. One had a pink skirt and the other was lime green or blue. The film was so popular that new versions were printed and hand coloured for the next five years.[4] These early moving pictures have been lost but there is a frame from the latter in the Margaret Herrick Library.[5]

In 1897, Stella had retired and was replaced by Edwina.[6] The act appeared as members of "The Alimony Club" in _Little Miss Chicago_, a burlesque at the Gaiety Theatre in Chicago.[7]
