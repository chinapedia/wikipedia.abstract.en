JULIE MONTAGU, VISCOUNTESS HINCHINGBROOKE (born February 17, 1972) is an American entrepreneur, yoga instructor, blogger, writer and reality television star.


Early life

Julie Fisher was born on February 17, 1972 to Thomas Fisher,[1] and was brought up in Sugar Grove, Illinois, as one of five siblings. She went on to study computer science at Indiana University. Fisher moved to London to work for an internet based company, and was setting up a film school when she met Luke Montagu. She was a single mother at the time, and had assumed he was not interested in her. Three months after they began dating, she noticed that one of his payment cards had "Viscount Hinchingbrooke" written on it. Only then, did he explain that he was a member of the aristocracy and his father was the current Earl of Sandwich. A year after they first met, they married at Mapperton House, Dorset, the country estate of the Earl of Sandwich.[2]


Career

When Luke Montagu suffered years of side effects from being removed from prescription medication by an addiction clinic (and was later awarded Â£1.3 million in compensation), Julie Montagu began running yoga classes in nearby church halls in order to bring some money into the household. She also started a blog, called the "Flexi Foodie" and wrote a successful cookbook,[3] _Superfoods: The Flexible Approach to Eating More Superfoods & Superfoods Superfast_.[4] She founded the charity Council for Evidence-Based Psychiatry after Luke's recovery, based on their experiences.[5]

She was then offered a position on the reality television series _Ladies of London_ as her husband was recovering. She later said of the series, "We thought long and hard before accepting as it offered financial support for a while. But it was not fun to do. I was expected to behave in a way I wasn't, like an It girl or socialite, when I'm not. They edit you... You have to go along with things or you get fired. But you know it was a job. I was acting." She celebrated when it was cancelled after three seasons.[6] In 2016, the couple took over the running of the Mapperton Estate.[7]

The series brought financial stability which allowed the couple to invest further in the Mapperton Estate, turning an old stable block into a wedding venue. Julie Montagu has also opened her own school of yoga within the grounds, but continues to practice yoga elsewhere such as being the headline act at the Wanderlust yoga festival in Victoria Park, London.[8] During the lead up to the Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Julie Montagu was interviewed on a number of occasions because she is an American who married into British aristocracy,[9] and was an on-site commentator on the wedding for the BBC.[10]


Personal life

She is married to Luke Montagu, Viscount Hinchingbrooke, and has four children.[11] Two of those are from her first marriage, and two with Luke.[12] She supported her husband through his recovery from a dependency of prescription drugs and now campaigns for greater awareness of the issue.[13]
