CHUTNIFICATION

“_chutney_ + (-fication)= _chutnification_ meaning “the process of becoming _chutney_”

''[1][2] . Chutney is a sauce or a dry base for a sauce, originating from the Indian subcontinent, used with the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent dishes like Dosa, Idli etc., that can include such forms as a spicy coconut dip, a tomato relish, a ground peanut garnish or a dahi, cucumber, and mint dip. Rushdie’s _Midnight’s Children_ is not the first novel to exhibit or employ chutnification. More-or-less, all the post-colonial writers tried this in some way or other. For example, Chinua Achebe’s seminal trilogy _Things Fall Apart, No Longer at Ease, Arrow of God_ as well as Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s _Petals of Blood_ were written long before Rushdie’s _Midnight’s Children_. But those novels were more busy at ‘creating’ history without proper documentations to challenge the historylessness the Igbo people or Swahili Community was ‘suffering from’ therefore remain in the ‘fictions only’ category.
