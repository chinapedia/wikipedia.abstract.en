Syrian,_Iraqi,_and_Lebanese_insurgencies.png''' ROJAVA]] The Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (also known as Rojava) shares much culturally with Kurdistan Region of Iraq (also known as Iraqi Kurdistan), but has many political differences. There has been military cooperation with Iraqi Kurdistan and the United States in the conflict against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), although neither gives official support for Rojava or its People's Protection Units (YPG). The Kurdistan Regional Government, which the Kurdistan Democratic Party runs, is an ally of Turkey and has co-operated to enforce a unilateral economic blockade against Rojava which has damaged and limited the region's economy. The "Sultanistic system" of Iraqi Kurdistan[1] stands in stark contrast to the democratic confederalist system of the Rojava.

The dominant political party in Rojava, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), is a member of the Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK) organisation. Although KCK member organisations in the neighbouring states with autochthonous Kurdish minorities are either outlawed (as in Iran and Turkey) or politically marginal with respect to other Kurdish parties (as in Iraq), the PYD-governed NES region has acquired the role of a model for the KCK political agenda and blueprint in general.

There is much sympathy for Rojava, in particular among Kurds in Turkey. During the Siege of Kobanî, a large number of ethnic Kurdish citizens of Turkey crossed the border and volunteered in the defence of the town. Upon their return to Turkish Kurdistan, some of these took up arms in the renewed Kurdish–Turkish conflict, where skills acquired by them during combat in Kobanî brought a new quality of urban warfare to the conflict in Turkey.[2][3]

The relationship between Iraqi Kurdistan and Rojava is complicated. One context is that the Kurdistan Democratic Party (the governing party of Iraqi Kurdistan), views itself and its affiliated Kurdish parties in other countries as a more conservative and nationalist alternative and competitor to the KCK's libertarian socialist ideology.[4]

Like the KCK umbrella in general, and even more so, the PYD is critical of any form of nationalism,[5] including Kurdish nationalism, putting them at odds with the Kurdish nationalist visions of the KDP-sponsored Kurdish National Council in Rojava.[6]
