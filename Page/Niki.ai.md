NIKI is India's first voice and vernacular enabled commerce platform focussed on empowering the next billion users with a simplified online experience to manage household expenses. Built for Bharat, by IIT Kharagpur graduates Sachin Jaiswal, Keshav Prawasi, Shishir Modi and Nitin Babel, Niki was officially registered on June 4, 2015. It was then launched to the public, a month later at YourStory’s TechSparks, being one of the Tech30 companies.

The company raised an undisclosed amount in seed funding[1] from Unilazer Ventures,[2] a Mumbai-based VC firm founded by Ronnie Screwvala, in October 2015. This was followed by another seed funding round by Ratan Tata in May 2016.[3] The company then raised US$2 million in Series A round of funding from SAP.iO, existing investors and some US and Germany-based investors, among others.[4]


Product

Niki is designed as a virtual agent for the emerging internet users living in Tier 2,3 or rural India, to pay monthly bills, do prepaid recharges or make travel bookings, just by talking. The experience being much similar to the offline world, where every service is availed through conversations, users place online orders using voice, in their own language while it assists them through every step of the payment process and providing 100% fulfilment guarantee.

Niki caters to the 60% of the 390 million internet users in India who are yet to transact online due to language and interface barriers. Its vernacular users have now expanded to 12,000+ locations such as Jaipur, Gharsana, Surat, Aurangabad, Muzaffarnagar, Ludhiana, Patna, Indore, Sri Ganganagar, Faridabad, Agra.

The company is currently in its hyper-growth phase, witnessing phenomenal adoption in Tier 2 and Tier 3 with 80% of the current 4.5 million+ user-base coming from these towns. It will soon launch language support in multiple Indian languages including Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali and Marathi to become a one stop commerce solution for all of Bharat.
