_THE GRASSLANDS PROJECT_ is a 2016 series of 10 short documentary films about small rural communities in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, directed by Scott Parker and produced by David Christensen for the National Film Board of Canada (NFB).


Development and production

Christensen, head of the NFB's Northwest Studio in Edmonton, had developed the idea for a series of short films that would tell the stories of small communities in Canada's southern Prairie grasslands. To direct the project, he hired Alberta filmmaker Scott Parker, with whom he had previously worked on the NFB's _Stories from Our Land_ project.[1] In February 2015, Christensen and Parker travelled to rural communities for a series of 10 public meetings to identify the key themes and concerns of local residents.[2][3]

Parker stated in May 2016 interview that he worked every day for six or seven months, shooting, travelling as well as editing. On one occasion, he made an 800-kilometre round trip to screen one of the films for a participant. Altogether, he calculated that he travelled 30,000 km. in the summer of 2015 to complete the films.[4]

The Alberta films were shot in or nearby Coutts, Magrath and Foremost. Saskatchewan’s locations were Eastend, Val Marie, Gravelbourg, Wood Mountain, Rockglen—as well as Radville, for the short film _Generations_, about the passing on of a family farm in nearby Ceylon, Saskatchewan.[5][6][7]
