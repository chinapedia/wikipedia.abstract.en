Family

Hope-Johnstone is the son of Major Percy Wentworth Hope-Johnstone (d. 1983) and his second wife Margaret Hunter-Arundell. He was educated at Stowe School and RAC Cirencester.[1]

In 1969, he married Susan, the daughter of Walter John Macdonald Ross, by whom he has one son and one daughter:[2]

-   Lady Julia Claire Hope-Johnstone (b. 1974), married Andrew Lindsay Curtis Barnard and has issue

In 1983, he succeeded his father as chief of the Clan Johnstone, hereditary steward of Annandale and hereditary keeper of Lochmaben Castle. Hope-Johnstone continued to prosecute the family claim to the earldom of Annandale and Hartfell, his father being the heir of the eldest daughter of the second earl. Previous claims, based on letters patent of 1661, had been rejected as their remainder only encompassed heirs male general; however, Hope-Johnstone was able to produce a royal charter of 1662 which extended the remainder. This was recognized by the Committee for Privileges as a creation of an earldom in its own right, and he was summoned to the House of Lords in 1986 as Earl of Annandale and Hartfell. [3]The title granted under the 1661 Letters Patent remains vacant as at 2017.
