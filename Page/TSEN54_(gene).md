TRNA SPLICING ENDONUCLEASE SUBUNIT 54 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TSEN54 gene. [1]


Function

This gene encodes a subunit of the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, which catalyzes the removal of introns from precursor tRNAs. The complex is also implicated in pre-mRNA 3-prime end processing.


Clinical significance

Mutations in this gene result in pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2.
