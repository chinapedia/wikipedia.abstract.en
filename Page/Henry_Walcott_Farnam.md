HENRY WALCOTT FARNAM (November 6, 1853 â€“ September 5, 1933) was an American economist. He was professor of political economy at Yale University from 1880 to 1918. In 1911, he served as president of the American Economic Association.

The son of railroad executive Henry Farnam, he attended Yale University graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1874, and then studied towards a M.A. in Roman law and economics in 1876. Like many American economists of the late 19th century, Farnam then went to Germany to study under the leading figures of the German historical school. Farnam earned a PhD from the University of Strasbourg in 1878.[1]
