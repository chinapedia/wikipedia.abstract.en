50 THINGS THAT MADE THE MODERN ECONOMY is a British radio show and podcast that airs on the BBC World Service. It is presented by economist and journalist Tim Harford. The first episode of the first series was broadcast on 5 November 2016.

Harford explained his motivation "to paint a picture of economic change by telling the stories of the ideas, people, and tools that had far-reaching consequences". He was fascinated by the many unexpected outcomes, such as "the impact of the fridge on global politics, or of the gramophone on income inequality."[1]

The first series was subsequently released by Harford as a book titled _Fifty Things That Made The Modern Economy._ It was published in the UK by Little, Brown Books, and as _Fifty Inventions That Shaped The Modern Economy_ in the US by Riverhead Books. The hardcover and eBook editions were released on 6 July 2017 in the UK and on 29 August 2017 in the US. A paperback edition was released in 2 August 2018.

A public call was made for suggestions of a "51st thing" in August 2017. Harford chose his six favourite submissions for an online vote from late September to 6 October 2017.[2] The winning item was announced as the credit card in an episode released on 28 October 2017. A special bonus episode on Santa Claus was broadcast on Monday 24 December 2018.

A second series began broadcasting on 30 March 2019.
