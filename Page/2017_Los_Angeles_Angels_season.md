The 2017 LOS ANGELES ANGELS SEASON was the 57th season of the Los Angeles Angels franchise and the 52nd in Anaheim (all of them at Angel Stadium). The Angels began the season on April 3 against the Oakland Athletics and finished the season on October 1 against the Seattle Mariners. They improved upon their record from last season, but still failed to make the playoffs for the third consecutive season, finishing 5 games behind the Minnesota Twins for the second wild card spot.


Offseason and spring training

In the first trade of the MLB offseason on November 3, 2016, the Angels acquired Cameron Maybin for Minor League pitcher Victor Alcantara.[1] Jesse Chavez signed with the team on November 12.[2] On December 10, the Angels traded Minor League pitchers Austin Adams and Kyle McGowin to the Washington Nationals for infielder Danny Espinosa.[3] The Milwaukee Brewers sent catcher Martin Maldonado to the Angels for Jett Bandy on December 13.[4] The Angels then signed Ben Revere, an outfielder, on December 23.[5] The Angels' first signing of 2017 was infielder Luis Valbuena, formerly of the Houston Astros, who signed a 2-year, $15 million deal on January 24.[6] On February 4, first baseman Dustin Ackley was signed to a minor league contract with an offer to attend Spring Training.[7] Pitcher Yusmeiro Petit also inked a minor league deal with a Spring Training invitation days later; he went on to make the Opening Day roster.[8]

The Angels ended spring training with a 21–14 win–loss record, excluding a tie game that did not count toward the standings. Their .600 winning percentage was the best in the Cactus League.[9]
