The COTTAGE PARK YACHT CLUB is a private yacht club located in Winthrop, Massachusetts, on Boston Harbor.[1]


History

In 1902, when the Boston Steam Ship Company ceased its ferry service operations from Boston to the Cottage Park Hotel in Winthrop, a group of local businessmen met at the hotel to explore the possibility of purchasing the ferry dock to start a Yacht Club. They finally purchased the head pier and ticket office to be used as a clubhouse and the Cottage Park Yacht Club was born.[2]
