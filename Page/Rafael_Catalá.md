RAFAEL CATALÁ POLO (born 21 June 1961) is a Spanish politician and member of the People's Party. He has been Minister of Justice and First Notary of the Kingdom since September 2014, and was additionally interim Minister of Public Works between 19 July 2016 and 4 November 2016.[1] Before this, he served as the 4th Secretary of State for Justice between 2002 and 2004 and as the 8th Secretary of State for Infrastructure, Transport and Housing from 2011 to 2014.

On 16 May 2017, the Congress of Deputies passed a motion of censure against Catalá as minister of justice. This was as a result of the maneuvers that have taken place within the fiscal ministry aimed at obstructing certain judicial cases against corruption and of the minister's own actions in relation to these cases. He is the first minister of democracy rejected by the full Congress.

Together with the Minister, José Manuel Maza, the Attorney General and Manuel Moix, the Anti-corruption Prosecutor, were rejected.
