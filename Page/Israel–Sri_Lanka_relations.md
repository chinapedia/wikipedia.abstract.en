ISRAEL–SRI LANKA RELATIONS are the official relations between Israel and Sri Lanka. Relations between Israel and Sri Lanka were bitter during the rule of left wing leader Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike; several Zionist lobbies threatened to boycott Sri Lankan tea after she expelled Israeli diplomats from Sri Lanka. [1] Relations between Sri Lanka and Israel started warming up after the right wing president J.R. Jayewardene re-established ties with Israel. Diplomatic ties with Israel got suspended again under president Ranasingha Premadasa. Sri Lankan government announced that they will resume diplomatic relations with Israel once it recognizes the Palestine Liberation Organization as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. [2] Diplomatic ties between the two nations got restored in 2000. [3] Sri Lanka supports a two-state solution for the Israel-Palestine conflict and the Sri Lankan president Maithripala Sirisena has assured the support for Palestinian independence. [4] [5]

Israel has helped Sri Lanka to defeat the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam organization and provided weapons to the country, including IAI Kfir Fighter Jet, the Super Dvora Mk II-class patrol boat and the Gabriel missile. [6]
