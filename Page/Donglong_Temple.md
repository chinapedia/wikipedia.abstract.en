The DONGLONG TEMPLE () is a temple in Donggang Township, Pingtung County, Taiwan.


History

The temple was originally built in 1706 in the fishing village of Yanpu, across the river from Donggang. However, it was then later destroyed by a flood in 1790 which led to a relocation of the temple to Donggang in 1790. Then again, it was destroyed by another flood in 1877. Reconstruction work at the current site started in 1884 and was completed in 1887.[1]


Activities

The temple organizes the Donggang King Boat Ceremony every three years on the 2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th year of the Chinese calendar.[2]
