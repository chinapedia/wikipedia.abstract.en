_AMERICAN BOYFRIEND: A SUBURBAN LOVE STORY_ is the second studio album by American recording artist Kevin Abstract, released on November 18, 2016.[1]


Background

On January 15, 2015, Kevin Abstract informed fans via his Twitter page that his record was to be titled _Death of a Supermodel_ and that it would be released later in the year.[2] This album was then later discarded, however. Abstract then announced that he was working on a different album, _They Shoot Horses,_ a part of the DEATH OF A SUPERMODEL trilogy. In November, the first single from _They Shoot Horses_, "Echo" was released, along with a music video directed by Tyler Mitchell.

At the end of June, 2016, Kevin announced that he had changed the title of his upcoming album to _American Boyfriend: A Suburban Love Story_ and that it would still be coming later in the year.

The album's second single "Empty" was released on September 20, 2016, alongside a self-directed music video.[3]

The album's release date was confirmed as November 18 on October 24. The album's artwork, designed by Tyler Mitchell and Henock "HK" Sileshi, and track listing were released on October 31.

The album's third single, "Yellow" was premiered by Zane Lowe on Beats One on November 2,[4] followed by "Miserable America", premiered by Shane Powers on Dash Radio the next day.[5]


Reception

_American Boyfriend_: _A Suburban Love Story_ received generally positive reviews upon release. Ryan Bassil of _Noisey_ said, "it's one of the most nuanced and touching documentations of the gloriously testing period that forms the experience of growing up and becoming yourself."[6] David Turner of _Pitchfork_ said, "_American Boyfriend_ can feel a bit scattered and unsure, but it’s an album seeking love in a world now primed to find new angles for hate. For that reason alone, it feels welcome."[7]
