Reception

_Cyber War Versus Cyber Realities: Cyber Conflict in the International System_

Francis C. Domingo praised the book in _Journal of Information Technology & Politics_ as a groundbreaking empirical work that provided multiple significant contributions to the literature in international relations.[7] Joe Burton, reviewing for H-Net, declared it to be an essential contribution to the cyber security literature, one that took a meticulous and quantitative approach to dispel the hyperbole of mis-characterization, overstatement, and outright fear-mongering around the locus of cyber-attacks.[8] Julien Nocetti, in _International Affairs_ viewed it as a comprehensive and sobering book.[9] John E. Gudgel, reviewing for _Small Wars & Insurgencies_, saw the book as providing a new perspective on cyber conflict and praised the authors' construction of a database of cyber incidents and disputes between countries -- the Dyadic Cyber Incident and Dispute Dataset (DCID), as one of the first viable attempts to quantify the impact of cyber actions.[10] Overall, he concluded that the authors had build a strong case for cyber policy.[11] Courteney J O’Connor, reviewing for _Political Studies Review_, extensively praised the book and their construction of a data-set, for the purpose.[12] He considered it to be a well-researched, accessible and referenced text, that brought much needed scrutiny and development to the field of theory around the domain of state-based cyber interactions.[13][14]

_Russia’s Coercive Diplomacy: Energy, Cyber, and Maritime Policy as New Sources of Power_

David W. Rivera, reviewing the book for _Perspectives on Politics_, judged that it had its moments of brilliance as well as weaknesses.[15] Whilst Rivera praised the authors' knowledge of Russia's foreign policy and found the chapters on cyber warfare and the multilateral diplomacy surrounding ownership of the Arctic Ocean to be excellent, he noted the book to be outdated in light of recent political developments and lacking in an optimal treatment about the _efficacy_ of coercion as a diplomatic tool.[16] He concluded:- "_Russia’s Coercive Diplomacy_ is an impressive piece of social science in many ways, but it is also a work that falls between two stools."[17]

_Cyber Strategy: The Evolving Character of Power and Coercion_

The book was subject to mixed reviews[18] Giampiero Giacomello of _Perspectives on Politics_ deemed it an original, well researched, and well-presented book but remarked on its failure to present any unexpected or new information on the subject.[19] He also praised the remarkable literature review of cyberspace present in the book.[20]
