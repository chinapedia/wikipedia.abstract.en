Plot

A King (M. K. Radha) is accused by his people of shielding his younger brother (V. Gopalakrishnan), who is after women. Touched to the quick, the king abandons his throne and walks out with his Queen (G. Varalakshmi) and children. He wanders in the woods, looking for peace. The family gets separated. The King becomes mentally deranged, while his wife loses the children and works as a maid in a house. The children are rescued by some people including a leader of a gang of thieves. The brother meets the King in the woods, apologises for what had happened and promises to cure him of his mental illness. He meets a young woman (Kumari Rajamani), who has a magic cave with herbs that can cure his brother. He goes in search of it, but the woman, unable to seduce the repentant brother, converts him into a dog (Tiger). However, he succeeds in curing the King and dies in his arms. The blind King is saved by a Princess (M. N. Rajam), who falls in love with him. She soon realises that he is still thinking of his first Queen. After interesting twists, the King and the Queens are united with the children and the Princess dies accidentally.[6]
