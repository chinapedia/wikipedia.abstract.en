In physics, the ELECTRONVOLT[1][2] (symbol EV, also written ELECTRON-VOLT and ELECTRON VOLT) is a unit of energy equal to exactly joules (symbol J) in SI units.

Historically, the electronvolt was devised as a standard unit of measure through its usefulness in electrostatic particle accelerator sciences, because a particle with electric charge _q_ has an energy after passing through the potential _V_; if _q_ is quoted in integer units of the elementary charge and the potential in volts, one gets an energy in eV.

Like the elementary charge on which it is based, it is not an independent quantity but is equal to . It is a common unit of energy within physics, widely used in solid state, atomic, nuclear, and particle physics. It is commonly used with the metric prefixes milli-, kilo-, mega-, giga-, tera-, peta- or exa- (meV, keV, MeV, GeV, TeV, PeV and EeV respectively). In some older documents, and in the name Bevatron, the symbol BeV is used, which stands for billion (10⁹) electronvolts; it is equivalent to the GeV.

Definition

An electronvolt is the amount of kinetic energy gained or lost by a single electron accelerating from rest through an electric potential difference of one volt in vacuum. Hence, it has a value of one volt, , multiplied by the electron's elementary charge _e_, Therefore, one electronvolt is equal to

The electronvolt, as opposed to the volt, is not an SI unit. The electronvolt (eV) is a unit of energy whereas the volt (V) is the derived SI unit of electric potential. The SI unit for energy is the joule (J).


Mass

By mass–energy equivalence, the electronvolt is also a unit of mass. It is common in particle physics, where units of mass and energy are often interchanged, to express mass in units of eV/_c_², where _c_ is the speed of light in vacuum (from [[Mass–energy_equivalence|{(2.99\ 792\ 458 \times 10^{8}\; \text{m}/\text{s})^2} = 1.782\ 661\ 92 \times 10^{-36}\; \text{kg}.

For example, an electron and a positron, each with a mass of , can annihilate to yield of energy. The proton has a mass of . In general, the masses of all hadrons are of the order of , which makes the GeV (gigaelectronvolt) a convenient unit of mass for particle physics:

     = .

The unified atomic mass unit (u), almost exactly 1 gram divided by the Avogadro number, is almost the mass of a hydrogen atom, which is mostly the mass of the proton. To convert to megaelectronvolts, use the formula:

    1 u =  = .


Momentum

In high-energy physics, the electronvolt is often used as a unit of momentum. A potential difference of 1 volt causes an electron to gain an amount of energy (i.e., ). This gives rise to usage of eV (and keV, MeV, GeV or TeV) as units of momentum, for the energy supplied results in acceleration of the particle.

The dimensions of momentum units are . The dimensions of energy units are . Then, dividing the units of energy (such as eV) by a fundamental constant that has units of velocity (), facilitates the required conversion of using energy units to describe momentum. In the field of high-energy particle physics, the fundamental velocity unit is the speed of light in vacuum _c_.

By dividing energy in eV by the speed of light, one can describe the momentum of an electron in units of eV/_c_.[3] [4]

The fundamental velocity constant _c_ is often _dropped_ from the units of momentum by way of defining units of length such that the value of _c_ is unity. For example, if the momentum _p_ of an electron is said to be , then the conversion to MKS can be achieved by:

$$p = 1\; \text{GeV}/c = \frac{(1 \times 10^{9}) \cdot (1.602\ 176\ 634 \times 10^{-19} \; \text{C}) \cdot (1 \; \text{V})}{(2.99\ 792\ 458 \times 10^{8}\; \text{m}/\text{s})} = 5.344\ 286 \times 10^{-19}\; \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}/\text{s}.$$


Distance

In particle physics, a system of "natural units" in which the speed of light in vacuum _c_ and the reduced Planck constant _ħ_ are dimensionless and equal to unity is widely used: . In these units, both distances and times are expressed in inverse energy units (while energy and mass are expressed in the same units, see mass–energy equivalence). In particular, particle scattering lengths are often presented in units of inverse particle masses.

Outside this system of units, the conversion factors between electronvolt, second, and nanometer are the following:

$$\hbar = {{h}\over{2\pi}} = 1.054\ 571\ 817\ 646\times 10^{-34}\ \mbox{J s} = 6.582\ 119\ 569\ 509\times 10^{-16}\ \mbox{eV s}.$$

The above relations also allow expressing the mean lifetime _τ_ of an unstable particle (in seconds) in terms of its decay width _Γ_ (in eV) via . For example, the B⁰ meson has a lifetime of 1.530(9) picoseconds, mean decay length is , or a decay width of .

Conversely, the tiny meson mass differences responsible for meson oscillations are often expressed in the more convenient inverse picoseconds.

Energy in electronvolts is sometimes expressed through the wavelength of light with photons of the same energy: 1 eV = 8065.544005(49) cm^(−1).


Temperature

In certain fields, such as plasma physics, it is convenient to use the electronvolt as a unit of temperature. The conversion to the Kelvin scale is defined by using _k__(B), the Boltzmann constant:

$${1 \over k_{\text{B}}} = {1.602\ 176\ 634 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV} \over 1.380\ 649 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J/K}} = 11\ 604.518\ 12 \text{ K/eV}.$$

For example, a typical magnetic confinement fusion plasma is , or 170 MK.

As an approximation: _k__(B)_T_ is about (≈ ) at a temperature of .


Properties

Colors_in_eV.svg EV_to_nm_vis.png The energy _E_, frequency _v_, and wavelength λ of a photon are related by

$$E=h\nu=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
$=\frac{(4.135\ 667\ 516\times 10^{-15}\,\mbox{eV}\,\mbox{s})(299\ 792\ 458\,\mbox{m/s})}{\lambda}$

where _h_ is the Planck constant, _c_ is the speed of light. This reduces to

_E_(eV) = 4.135 667 516 feVs ⋅ _ν_ (PHz)
$=\frac{1\ 239.841\ 93\,\mbox{eV}\,\mbox{nm}}{\lambda\ \mbox{(nm)}}.$[5] A photon with a wavelength of (green light) would have an energy of approximately . Similarly, would correspond to an infrared photon of wavelength or frequency .


Scattering experiments

In a low-energy nuclear scattering experiment, it is conventional to refer to the nuclear recoil energy in units of eVr, keVr, etc. This distinguishes the nuclear recoil energy from the "electron equivalent" recoil energy (eVee, keVee, etc.) measured by scintillation light. For example, the yield of a phototube is measured in phe/keVee (photoelectrons per keV electron-equivalent energy). The relationship between eV, eVr, and eVee depends on the medium the scattering takes place in, and must be established empirically for each material.


Energy comparisons

Light_spectrum.svg varies only with the frequency of the photon, related by speed of light constant. This contrasts with a massive particle of which the energy depends on its velocity and rest mass.[6][7][8]
