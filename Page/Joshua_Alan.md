JOSHUA ALAN (born November 28, 1984) is an American singer-songwriter and musician, and was the singer for RATT during the American Made 2016 tour. He was born in Tampa, Florida, and grew up in Hampton, Georgia, a small town approximately 40 miles south of Atlanta.


Music career

Showing a very deep interest in music, Josh's mother brought home an acoustic guitar when he was 6 years old. He immediately began learning songs he heard on the radio by ear. Other instruments he plays include piano, drums, bass guitar, banjo, and mandolin. In 2010, he moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, to expand his musical career. After filtering through several local bands, Josh found his niche in 2014 when he joined up with the Sin City Sinners, leading the vocals for the band that included members Brent Muscat (Faster Pussycat), Scott Griffin (RATT and L.A. Guns), Michael “Doc” Ellis (RATT, Love/Hate, and Todd Kerns and the Anti-Stars), and Blas Elias (Slaughter). In March 2015, RATT drummer Bobby Blotzer guested with the Sinners. Blotzer asked Josh and fellow Sinners' members Doc and Scott to join him in forming a new version of RATT. Josh toured with Blotzer's version of RATT while continuing as the singer for the Sin City Sinners. February 14, 2016, the Sinners released the album _Let It Burn_. On February 19, 2016, Josh announced his departure from the Sin City Sinners in order to work full-time with RATT.[1] During this time, he toured world-wide with RATT as lead vocalist for the American Made tour, performing throughout the United States, in Canada, and the U.K.[2]

On January 23, 2017, Josh resigned from RATT to pursue his own musical career.[3]
