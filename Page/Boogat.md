BOOGAT is a Canadian-Mexican musician from Montreal, Quebec,[1] whose style blends hip hop with Latin music styles such as cumbia and reggaeton. He won the Juno Award for World Music Album of the Year for his album _Neo-Reconquista_ at the Juno Awards of 2016 and the ADISQ Awards of 2016.

Of Paraguayan and Mexican descent,[2] he was born in Quebec City to immigrant parents and raised in the Beauport borough of the city, then moved to Montreal in 2001 where his career took off.[3]

Performing initially in French, Boogat switched to Spanish after playing with the Latin music group Roberto Lopez Project and Electro producer Poirier. He released his first full-length Spanish album _El Dorado Sunset_ in 2013.[4] The album won two Prix Félix for Best World Music Album and Producer of the Year at ADISQ 2013.[5]

_Neo-Reconquista_, which includes collaborations with La Yegros, Sonido Pesado and Pierre Kwenders, was released in 2015.[6] Exclaim! gave the album an 8/10, noting that Boogat has "long moved past being known simply as a "Spanish-language rapper from Quebec" and who has committed to a more textured artistic evolution and genre-agnostic growth".

_San Cristóbal Baile Inn_, which includes collaborations with Andrés Oddone, Frikstailers, Miss Bolivia, Niña Dioz and Lemon Bucket Orkestra, was released in 2017.
