"INVICTUS" is a short Victorian poem by the English poet William Ernest Henley (1849–1903). It was written in 1875 and published in 1888 in his first volume of poems, _Book of Verses_, in the section _Life and Death (Echoes) It shows how Henley never lost hope and kept faith in himself and faced the struggles unafraid._.[1]


Title

Originally, the poem was published with no title.[2] The second edition of Henley's _Book of Verses_ added a dedication "To R. T. H. B."—a reference to Robert Thomas Hamilton Bruce (1846–1899), a successful Scottish flour merchant, baker, and literary patron.[3] The 1900 edition of Henley's _Poems_, published after Bruce's death, altered the dedication to "I. M. R. T. Hamilton Bruce (1846–1899)" (I. M. standing for "in memoriam").[4]

The poem was reprinted in nineteenth-century newspapers under a variety of titles, including "Myself",[5] "Song of a Strong Soul",[6] "My Soul",[7] "Clear Grit",[8] "Master of His Fate",[9] "Captain of My Soul",[10] "Urbs Fortitudinis",[11] and "De Profundis".[12]

The established title "Invictus", Latin for "unconquered",[13] was added by editor Arthur Quiller-Couch when the poem was included in _The Oxford Book of English Verse_ (1900).[14][15]


Poem


Importance

]] When Henley was 16 years old, his left leg required amputation due to complications arising from tuberculosis.[16] In the early 1870s, after seeking treatment for problems with his other leg at Margate, he was told that it would require a similar procedure. In August 1873 he chose instead to travel to Edinburgh to enlist the services of the distinguished English surgeon Joseph Lister,[17][18] who was able to save Henley's remaining leg after multiple surgical interventions on the foot.[19] While recovering in the infirmary, he was moved to write the verses that became "Invictus". A memorable evocation of Victorian stoicism—the "stiff upper lip" of self-discipline and fortitude in adversity, which popular culture rendered into a British character trait—"Invictus" remains a cultural touchstone.[20]
