The KESPA CUP (Hangul: 케스파컵) is an annual eSports event organized by KeSPA, the Korean eSports Association. As of the 2018 edition, the tournament is organized for _League of Legends_. Until 2016, the tournament was also organized for _StarCraft II_.


History

The first KeSPA cup was hosted in 2005 as a tournament to allow professional _StarCraft_ teams to play against amateur teams. Events were also held for _Special Force_, _Kartrider_, and _FreeStyle Street Basketball_. The second event was held in 2007 at Sejong University and also included _WarCraft III_ and _Counter-Strike_.[1]

In 2014, seven years since the last event, KeSPA Cup was brought back for its modern iteration and it has been held every year since. _StarCraft II_ was the only game that had a tournament in the relaunch of the initiative and it featured 16 of the year's best players playing for 8 million South Korean won.[2] The following year, two tournaments for StarCraft II were held, the first in May and the second in July. League of Legends was added as one of the events in 2015.[3]

In 2016, Alex "Neeb" Sunderhaft became the first non-Korean _StarCraft_ player to win a major Korean tournament in sixteen years after winning the 2016 KeSPA Cup. The previous non-Korean champion was Guillaume Patry, who won the first OnGameNet StarLeague in 2000.[4]
