Description

The exterior is preceded by a wide staircase that leads to the temple. The facade is divided into two terraces: the first has set the entry; the second is characterized by tall windows that form the backdrop to the titular statue of the Madonna, which appeared in 1846 in La Salette in France, which juts out like a high canopy of reinforced concrete. The church is flanked by a bell tower, among the highest of Rome (the Quercioli the extent to 52 meters). The interior has a central plan with brick walls that converge sinuously to the only altar. According to the Quercioli "Our Lady of La Salette by many is considered a sacred architecture cornerstone of our days. Â» (Quercioli M., op.cit. P.375)
