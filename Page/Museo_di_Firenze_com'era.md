MUSEO DI FIRENZE COM'ERA ("Museum of Florence as it was") was a history and archaeology museum, one of the civic museums of the city of Florence.

The museum was located on Via dell'Oriuolo in a former convent of the Oblates. It closed permanently in October 2010 to make space for the enlargement of the Biblioteca delle Oblate. Some of its exhibits will be incorporated into a new City museum portraying Florence through the ages, to be housed in Palazzo Vecchio.[1]

The museum's collections included the 14 surviving paintings of Medici villas by Giusto Utens. These were transferred in 2014 to a new permanent gallery at Petraia Villa Medici.[2]
