History

English Language School "Geo Milev" offers a historical tradition of excellence in preparing young students in foreign language studies since the beginning of the 20th century. The building was constructed in 1908 by the Italian architect professor Mariano Pernigoni for the purposes of the French Catholic School with a boarding house „Notre dame de sion“.[6] The aims of the school, managed by the religious order of Notre Dame de Sion, with divisions in 24 countries around the world, were solid education, proper behavior and forming a character in the spirit of the Christian virtues. Teachers at the French Catholic School were Catholic nuns. The education of the girls was carried out in French and organized into small classes with up to 10 students, but varied in ethnic and multicultural composition – besides wealthy Bulgarians, there were also Jews, Turks, Armenians, Czechs, Austrians, and Belgian students. With the Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944, the country entered the Soviet sphere of influence and the school was closed down until 1963, when it resumed its activities as the nowadays known ENGLISH LANGUAGE SCHOOL „GEO MILEV“. At present, the high school admits students in 4 classes with intensive studies of English and a second foreign language - French, German or Russian.
