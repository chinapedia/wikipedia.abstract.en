_PORTRAIT OF MARGARETE BRÖMSEN_ is a painting by the German Baroque painter Michael Conrad Hirt, painted in 1642 and now in St. Anne's Museum.[1] It is considered a wedding portrait, but a pendant of her husband, Diedrich von Brömsen, is unknown.


Painting

This painting is inscribed with _MARGRETA.BRÖMSEN NATA . A:1626.30 NOVEMB NUPTA. A:1641.29.NOVEMB: MORTUA. A:1642.16.APRIL_, which reports Margarete Brömsen's birth date (30 November 1626), the marriage date (29 November 1641), and the death date (16 April 1642).[2] She is wearing a lace cap and a wide lace collar over a white dress edged with gold trim with a gold chain. In her right hand she holds a carnation and in her gloved left hand she holds another glove. Margarete Brömsen was the wealthy daughter of the Lübeck mayor Anton Kohler. The visible amount of gold in her dress shows an ostentatious display that may be the result of the 9 October 1641 confirmation of nobility rights for the families of Warendorp, Wickede, Brömsen, Luneburg, Kerkring, and Stiten by Emperor Ferdinand III. The privileges are referred to as the _Zirkelgesellschaft_ (Circle company).

Since the dates on the painting report that she died only 5 months after her wedding, Margarete Brömsen was possibly painted during pregnancy and could have died in childbirth. Considering the fact that a pendant is unknown and marriage pendants were often made in the year after the wedding, then this painting could be a commemorative posthumous portrait. Deathbed portraits were common for rich families at the time, and for children in the Netherlands, sometimes the deceased was posed to look alive. Other portraits Hirt made of her contemporaries were:

Legacy

20,000_Years_of_Fashion_by_Boucher.jpg'' with details of illustrations]] This portrait was selected by Yvonne Deslandres for her book _20,000 Years of Fashion_ to illustrate the backward fashion of German provincial weddings, and the unusual cap was featured on the cover.[3]

In the 1990s this painting enjoyed some notoriety as the headdress was considered to be the model for the headdress of the wedding costume design by Eiko Ishioka for the role of Lucy Westenra portrayed by Sadie Frost in _Bram Stoker's Dracula_.[4][5]
