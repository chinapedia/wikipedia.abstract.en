Academic Expertise - Economics & Legal Scholarship

Buchanan's research focuses on the long-term tax and spending patterns of the federal government.[3] Buchanan and his co-author, Michael C. Dorf of Cornell Law School, are leading academic experts on the U.S. debt ceiling, especially its constitutional implications. They are often cited, both individually and together, in notable publications.[4][5][6][7]

Buchanan has also written extensively on the fiscal health and intergenerational implications of the U.S. Social Security system, the debt and the deficit, and other topics. His latest work, _Social Security is Fair to All Generations: Demystifying the Trust Fund, Solvency, and the Promise to Younger Americans_, was published by the Cornell Journal of Law & Public Policy in 2018, refutes claims that the Social Security system unfairly transferred wealth from younger generations to Baby Boomers.

He has also become a frequent speaker abroad, having been invited as a guest lecturer and visiting scholar at universities and other educational organizations in Australia, Austria, Canada, Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, England, New Zealand, Spain, and Sweden.

He served on the faculty at Rutgers University Law School, and was a visiting professor at New York University School of Law and a visiting scholar at Cornell Law School. Currently, Buchanan teaches at The George Washington University Law School in Washington, D.C., specializing in tax policy and tax law.[8]
