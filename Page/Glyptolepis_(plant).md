_GLYPTOLEPIS_ is an extinct morphogenus of female conifer cones from the Triassic. It was established in 1872 by the French botanist Wilhelm Philippe Schimper.[1][2][3] The morphogenus is characterized by having bract scale complexes with elongated seed scale stalks. The seed scales each contain two recurved ovules and are distinctively flattened with five or six lobes.[4][5][6] The name is derived from Ancient Greek γλυπτό (_glyptó_, "sculpture" or "carved") and λεπίς (_lepís_, "scale").

_Glyptolepis_ is classified under the extinct conifer order Voltziales, but its placement within the Voltziales families is currently unknown.[7] Although numerous fossil cones have been assigned to the genus in the past, a review by Axsmith and Taylor (1997) have concluded that only two species are valid for the genus, and all other species were assigned in error. The species included under _Glyptolepis_ are:[8][9]

-   _Glyptolepis keuperiana_ Schimper
-   _Glyptolepis richteri_ Axsmith & Taylor
