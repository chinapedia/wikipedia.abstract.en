Background

Bella is a brand of hygienic products for women – the market leader in Central and Eastern Europe, rapidly conquering the markets of Western Europe and Asia. Under the sign of Bella sold a wide range of products: sanitary napkins, panty liners, tampons and other feminine hygiene products. The range of hygiene products for women was founded in 1976, when in _Toruń Plant Materials Opatrunkowych_ began production of sanitary napkins called _Donna_. From those distant days, the quality of products continues to grow. There was also a modification of the name – Donna pads were marked with the name Bella Donna, which in Italian means "beautiful woman" and introduced the name Bella.
