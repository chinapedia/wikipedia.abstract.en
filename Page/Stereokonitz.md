_STEREOKONITZ_ is an album by American jazz saxophonist Lee Konitz recorded in Italy in 1968 and released on the Italian RCA label.[1][2]


Critical reception

Ken Dryden of Allmusic said "Tommaso's charts delve into bop and cool, with Konitz primarily playing the Varitone (a form of electronic saxophone that was experimented with briefly and abandoned by reed players in the late '60s), though he does play some alto sax and also makes a rare appearance on flute (doubling on it in "Take Seven"). While the music from this 1968 session is enjoyable, even though the sound quality of the Varitone pales when compared to a regular saxophone, this remains one of Lee Konitz's more obscure recordings from the '60s".[3]
