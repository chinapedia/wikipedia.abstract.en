POSSUM TROT CREEK is a stream in Crawford and Iron counties in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] It is a tributary of Huzzah Creek.

The stream headwaters arise in the northwest corner of Iron County just northwest of Viburnum (at ) and the stream flows northwest to its confluence with Huzzah Creek in Crawford County (at ).[2][3] Mill Rock Creek enters the Huzzah just downstream from Possum Trot Creek.[4]

Possum Trot Creek, also called Possum Creek, was named for the fact it was a favorite hunting ground of opossums by early settlers.[5]
