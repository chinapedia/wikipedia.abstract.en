BALDR (also BALDER, BALDUR) is a god in Norse mythology, and a son of the god Odin and the goddess Frigg. He has numerous brothers, such as Thor and Váli.

During the 12th century, Danish accounts by Saxo Grammaticus and other Danish Latin chroniclers recorded a euhemerized account of his story. Compiled in Iceland during the 13th century, but based on much older Old Norse poetry, the _Poetic Edda_ and the _Prose Edda_ contain numerous references to the death of Baldr as both a great tragedy to the Æsir and a harbinger of Ragnarök.

According to _Gylfaginning_, a book of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda, Baldr's wife is Nanna and their son is Forseti. Baldr had the greatest ship ever built, Hringhorni, and there is no place more beautiful than his hall, Breidablik.


Name

Jacob Grimm, in his _Teutonic Mythology_ (ch. 11), identifies Old Norse _Baldr_ with the Old High German _Baldere_ (2nd Merseburg Charm, Thuringia), _Palter_ (theonym, Bavaria), _Paltar_ (personal name) and with Old English _bealdor, baldor_ "lord, prince, king" (used always with a genitive plural, as in _gumena baldor_ "lord of men", _wigena baldor_ "lord of warriors", et cetera). Old Norse shows this usage of the word as an honorific in a few cases, as in _baldur î brynju_ (Sæm. 272b) and _herbaldr_ (Sæm. 218b), epithets of heroes in general.

Grimm traces the etymology of the name to *_balþaz_, whence Gothic _balþs_, Old English _bald_, Old High German _pald_, all meaning "bold, brave".[1]

But the interpretation of Baldr as "the brave god" may be secondary. Baltic (cf. Lithuanian _baltas_, Latvian _balts_) has a word meaning "the white, the good", and Grimm speculates that the name may originate as a Baltic loan into Proto-Germanic. In continental Saxon and Anglo-Saxon tradition, the son of Woden is called not _Bealdor_ but _Baldag_ (Saxon) and _Bældæg, Beldeg_ (Anglo-Saxon), which shows association with "day", possibly with Day personified as a deity. This, as Grimm points out, would agree with the meaning "shining one, white one, a god" derived from the meaning of Baltic _baltas_, further adducing Slavic _Belobog_ and German _Berhta_.[2]

Grimm's etymology is endorsed by modern research. According to Rudolf Simek, the original name for Baldr must be understood as 'shining day'.[3]


Attestations

Merseburg Incantation

One of the two Merseburg Incantations names _Baldere_, but also mentions a figure named _Phol_, considered to be a byname for Baldr (as in Scandinavian _Falr_, _Fjalarr_; (in Saxo) _Balderus_ : _Fjallerus_).[4]

_Poetic Edda_

.]]

In the Poetic Edda the tale of Baldr's death is referred to rather than recounted at length. Among the visions which the Völva sees and describes in the prophecy known as the _Völuspá_ is one of the fatal mistletoe, the birth of Váli and the weeping of Frigg (stanzas 31–33). Yet looking far into the future the Völva sees a brighter vision of a new world, when both Höðr and Baldr will come back (stanza 62). The Eddic poem _Baldr's Dreams_ mentions that Baldr has bad dreams which the gods then discuss. Odin rides to Hel and awakens a seeress, who tells him Höðr will kill Baldr but Vali will avenge him (stanzas 9, 11).

_Prose Edda_

In _Gylfaginning_, Baldur is described as follows:

|     _Annar sonur Óðins er Baldur, og er frá honum gott að segja. Hann er svá fagr álitum ok bjartr svá at lýsir af honum, ok eitt gras er svá hvítt at jafnat er til Baldrs brár. Þat er allra grasa hvítast, ok þar eptir máttu marka fegrð hans bæði á hár og á líki. Hann er vitrastr ása ok fegrst talaðr ok líknsamastr. En sú náttúra fylgir honum at engi má haldask dómr hans. Hann býr þar sem heita Breiðablik, þat er á himni. Í þeim stað má ekki vera óhreint[.]_[5] |     The second son of Odin is Baldur, and good things are to be said of him. He is best, and all praise him; he is so fair of feature, and so bright, that light shines from him. A certain herb is so white that it is likened to Baldr's brow; of all grasses it is whitest, and by it thou mayest judge his fairness, both in hair and in body. He is the wisest of the Æsir, and the fairest-spoken and most gracious; and that quality attends him, that none may gainsay his judgments. He dwells in the place called Breidablik, which is in heaven; in that place may nothing unclean be[.] — _Brodeur's translation_[6] |  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--+

Apart from this description, Baldr is known primarily for the story of his death, which is seen as the first in a chain of events that will ultimately lead to the destruction of the gods at Ragnarök. According to _Völuspá_, Baldr will be reborn in the new world.

He had a dream of his own death and his mother had the same dreams. Since dreams were usually prophetic, this depressed him, so his mother Frigg made every object on earth vow never to hurt Baldr. All objects made this vow except mistletoe[7]—a detail which has traditionally been explained with the idea that it was too unimportant and nonthreatening to bother asking it to make the vow, but which Merrill Kaplan has instead argued echoes the fact that young people were not eligible to swear legal oaths, which could make them a threat later in life.[8]

.]] When Loki, the mischief-maker, heard of this, he made a magical spear from this plant (in some later versions, an arrow). He hurried to the place where the gods were indulging in their new pastime of hurling objects at Baldr, which would bounce off without harming him. Loki gave the spear to Baldr's brother, the blind god Höðr, who then inadvertently killed his brother with it (other versions suggest that Loki guided the arrow himself). For this act, Odin and the giantess Rindr gave birth to Váli who grew to adulthood within a day and slew Höðr.[9]

Baldr was ceremonially burnt upon his ship, Hringhorni, the largest of all ships. As he was carried to the ship, Odin whispered in his ear. This was to be a key riddle asked by Odin (in disguise) of the giant Vafthrudnir (and which was unanswerable) in the poem _Vafthrudnismal_. The riddle also appears in the riddles of Gestumblindi in _Hervarar saga_.[10]

The dwarf Litr was kicked by Thor into the funeral fire and burnt alive. Nanna, Baldr's wife, also threw herself on the funeral fire to await Ragnarök when she would be reunited with her husband (alternatively, she died of grief). Baldr's horse with all its trappings was also burned on the pyre. The ship was set to sea by Hyrrokin, a giantess, who came riding on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and all the earth shook.

Upon Frigg's entreaties, delivered through the messenger Hermod, Hel promised to release Baldr from the underworld if all objects alive and dead would weep for him. All did, except a giantess, Þökk (often presumed to be the god Loki in disguise), who refused to mourn the slain god. Thus Baldr had to remain in the underworld, not to emerge until after Ragnarök, when he and his brother Höðr would be reconciled and rule the new earth together with Thor's sons.

_Gesta Danorum_

.]]

Writing during the end of the 12th century, the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus tells the story of Baldr (recorded as _Balderus_) in a form that professes to be historical. According to him, Balderus and Høtherus were rival suitors for the hand of Nanna, daughter of Gewar, King of Norway. Balderus was a demigod and common steel could not wound his sacred body. The two rivals encountered each other in a terrific battle. Though Odin and Thor and the other gods fought for Balderus, he was defeated and fled away, and Høtherus married the princess.

Nevertheless, Balderus took heart of grace and again met Høtherus in a stricken field. But he fared even worse than before. Høtherus dealt him a deadly wound with a magic sword, named Mistletoe,[11] which he had received from Mimir, the satyr of the woods; after lingering three days in pain Balderus died of his injury and was buried with royal honours in a barrow.

_Chronicon Lethrense_ and _Annales Lundenses_

There are also two lesser known Danish Latin chronicles, the _Chronicon Lethrense_ and the _Annales Lundenses_ of which the latter is included in the former. These two sources provide a second euhemerized account of Höðr's slaying of Baldr.

It relates that Hother was the king of the Saxons and son of Hothbrodd and Hadding. Hother first slew Othen's (i.e. Odin) son Balder in battle and then chased Othen and Thor. Finally, Othen's son Both killed Hother. Hother, Balder, Othen and Thor were incorrectly considered to be gods.

Utrecht Inscription

A Latin votive inscription from Utrecht, from the 3rd or 4th century C.E., has been theorized as containing the dative form _Baldruo_,[12] pointing to a Latin nominative singular *_Baldruus_, which some have identified with the Norse/Germanic god,[13] although both the reading and this interpretation have been questioned.[14][15]

Anglo Saxon Chronicles

In the Anglo Saxon Chronicles Baldr is named as the ancestor of the monarchy of Kent, Bernicia, Deira, and Wessex through his supposed son Brond.[16]


Eponyms

Plants

(Matricaria perforata'')]] As referenced in _Gylfaginning_, in Sweden and Norway, the scentless mayweed (_Matricaria perforata_) and the similar sea mayweed (_Matricaria maritima_) are both called _baldursbrá_ "Balder's brow" and regionally in northern England (_baldeyebrow_).[17] In Iceland only the former is found.[18] In Germany lily-of-the-valley is known as _weisser Baldrian_; variations using or influenced by reflexes of _Phol_ include _Faltrian_ (upper Austria), Villum_fallum_ (Salzburg), and _Fildron_ or _Faldron_ (Tyrol).

Toponyms

There are a few old place names in Scandinavia that contain the name _Baldr_. The most certain and notable one is the (former) parish name Balleshol in Hedmark county, Norway: "a Balldrshole" 1356 (where the last element is _hóll_ m "mound; small hill"). Others may be (in Norse forms) _Baldrsberg_ in Vestfold county, _Baldrsheimr_ in Hordaland county _Baldrsnes_ in Sør-Trøndelag county—and (very uncertain) the Balsfjorden fjord and Balsfjord municipality in Troms county.

In Copenhagen, there is also a Baldersgade, or "Balder's Street". A street in downtown Reykjavík is called Baldursgata (Baldur's Street).

In Sweden there is a Baldersgatan (Balder's Street) in Stockholm. There is also Baldersnäs (Balder's isthmus), Baldersvik (Balder's bay), Balders udde (Balder's headland) and Baldersberg (Balder's mountain) at various places.

[1] "_Baldrs_ would in strictness appear to have no connexion with the Goth. _balþs_ (bold, audax), nor _Paltar_ with the OHG. _pald_, nor _Baldr_ with the ON. _ballr_ 'dangerous, dire'. As a rule, the Gothic _ld_ is represented by ON. _ld_ and OHG. _lt_: the Gothic _lþ_ by ON. _ll_ and OHG. _ld_. But the OS. and AS. have _ld_ in both cases, and even in Gothic, ON. and OHG. a root will sometimes appear in both forms in the same language; so that a close connexion between _balþs_ and _Baldrs_, _pald_ and Paltar, is possible after all."

[2] "_Bæl-dæg_ itself is white-god, light-god, he that shines as sky and light and day, the kindly _Bièlbôgh, Bèlbôgh_ of the Slav system. It is in perfect accord with this explanation of _Bæl-dæg_, that the Anglo-Saxon tale of ancestry assigns to him a son Brond, of whom the Edda is silent, _brond, brand_, ON. _brandr_ (fire brand or blade of a sword), signifying _jubar, fax, titio_. Bældæg therefore, as regards his name, would agree with _Berhta_, the bright goddess.
