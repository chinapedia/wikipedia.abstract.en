EDWARD DAFYDD (died 1690), also known as EDWARD DAVID, was a 17th-century Welsh poet from Margam, Glamorganshire.


Prominence

By some he was considered the most prominent Glamorganshire bard of the 17th century. According to Iolo Morganwg, he was tutored by Llywelyn Si√¥n, who dwelt in Laleston, a neighbouring parish. None of his work is thought to have been produced after 1665.[1]

Dafydd was believed to have been admitted as graduate of Gorsedd Morganwg in 1620. In 1660, he served as its president. He died in 1690.[2]
