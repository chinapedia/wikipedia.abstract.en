"DUST MY SHOULDERS OFF" is a song by Chinese singer and songwriter Jane Zhang. It features American rapper and producer Timbaland, and was released on October 14, 2016, through Montage Records.[1]


Critical reception

Jennifer Dill of _E! Online_ said "The song tells the story of someone who may be having a rough day but who quickly decides to 'dust her shoulders off' in swaggy fashion. It features a catchy beat and a heartening don't-sweat-the-small-stuff vibe."[2] PopCrush's Bradley Stern stated "The fresh and breezy, feel-good ode to sh-sh-shaking off the blues, gliding across folk-y harmonies recalling Oh Land and Timba and Jim Beanz’s knocking hip-hop beats, really doesn’t sound like anything on radio right now. {{'}}_The world keeps spinning, life goes on and on / I won’t cry for long_{{'}} she confidently croons across the quirky and carefree production, shrugging off all of life’s little inconveniences. It's no secret that breaking into the American market in a big way is still an all-but-impossible feat for any Asian act — from any country. (Sad, but true.) We're inching there at a snail's pace with acts like Utada and CL, and BTS just notched the highest Korean-language debut on the _Billboard_ 200 yet this week, but to see Jane riding high on the Top 10 out of nowhere is an absolute unexpected delight: it's not only a massive victory for C-Pop, but for the Asian music market as a whole. Here's hoping this is only the start of Jane's US success story."[3]
