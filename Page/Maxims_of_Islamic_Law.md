The MAXIMS OF ISLAMIC LAW were established after representatives of all schools of thought regarding Muslim Jurisprudence came together to reach a consensus.[1] Maxims refer to a body of abstract rules that were produced after a detailed study of the fiqh. Theyâ€™re theoretical guidelines corresponding to different areas of fiqh, which may be dealing with anything from evidence to matrimonial law.[2] The fiqh is Islamic jurisprudence,through the human interpretation of Islamic law.


The five Normative Maxims of Islamic law are

-   Al-umuru bi-maqasidiha: Acts are judged by the intention behind them
-   Ad-dararu yuzal: Harm must be eliminated
-   Al-yaqinu la yazulu bish-shakk: Certainty is not overruled by doubt
-   Al-'addatu muhakkamatun: Custom is the basis of judgement
-   Al-mashaqqatu tujlab at-taysir: Hardship begets facility[3]
