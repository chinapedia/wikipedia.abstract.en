Early life

Beth Marie Sherburn was born in Wordsley. From 1995 to 2002 she attended the Straits Primary School. It was here that she realised she wanted to pursue a career in music, after being offered the opportunity by her headmaster to give a rendition of Celine Dion's "Falling into You" at a nearby secondary school.[5] She remembers, "I was such a quiet girl back then, the music definitely brought me out of my shell".[6]

From 2002 to 2009 Sherburn attended secondary school at Ellowes Hall School. During her time there, she became involved in school choirs and musical productions, playing lead roles in _Les Misérables_, _Fiddler on the Roof_, _The Sound of Music_ and _Oliver!_, in addition to performing in Disneyland Paris.[7]

Sherburn took lessons in singing and piano, and reached ABRSM Grades 7 and 5 respectively. She was eleven when she entered her first singing competition, touring the UK with the Gospel Youth Choir and Let's Sing Choir, and performing at UK concert halls including the Royal Albert Hall, Birmingham Symphony Hall, Barclaycard Arena, Sheffield Arena and the Manchester Arena, supporting Katherine Jenkins and Heather Small.[8]

In 2008, Sherburn performed as "the little cabin boy" alongside Matthew Kelly and George Costigan in a musical production of _Don Quixote_, directed by Chris Bond.[9] She also performed at Birmingham Symphony Hall, giving a rendition of Barbra Streisand's "How Do You Keep The Music Playing?". After the performance, a UK record producer approached Sherburn and invited her to record at his studios in Bath.[10] The following year, Sherburn travelled to Los Angeles, Norway, and Poland, to develop her songwriting ability. It was in Norway that she began to record demos, and began writing and working with the Walt Disney Company.

Sherburn won the National Songwriters' Competition. Robin Gibb, of the Bee Gees, was on the judging panel, and remarked that Sherburn's songwriting reminded him of when he used to write songs with his brothers. Sherburn performed her song "Starbucks Town" as part of this competition.[11]

Between 2010 and 2012, Sherburn worked with British guitarist and songwriter K. K. Downing of Judas Priest.[12]


Career

2012–2013: Early career

In 2012, Sherburn released a dance cover of Duran Duran's "Ordinary World", which she created with producer John McLaughlin. It charted at No. 8 in the UK Club Charts.[13] Shortly after, she released "Overload", produced by Judd Mahoney, with a radio edit being mixed by The Alias.

Sherburn sang with her band at an event before Prince Andrew in 2013, performing a mixture of her own original material and cover songs.[14]

2014–2015: "Joker", The Saturdays and charity work

Lil Wayne is featured on her debut single, "Joker", which was released in 2014. The accompanying music video was directed by Carly Cussen. The track itself was played on Capital FM and various BBC radio stations, and was mentioned in UK magazines such as OK!, NOW and Music Weekly.[15]

She performed at a Shopcade pop-up event at London Fashion Week and Pride London, where she headlined the main stage performing alongside Pixie Lott, Conor Maynard, Anastacia, Foxes and Katy B.[16]

Later the same year, Sherburn flew to Poland to perform alongside DJ and producer, Leon Lour. Here, she sang "Use That Body", "Stamp on It" and "Joker". Sherburn supported The Saturdays on their Greatest Hits Live! tour later in 2014.[17]

Sherburn performed at several further events in 2014 including the British motorcycle Grand Prix, the Inspiration Awards for Women, and the Breakthrough Cup.[18][19]

BethSherburn_IanMcManus.jpg In 2015 Sherburn began partaking in a number of events for charity, beginning with an abseil down Fort Dunlop in Birmingham in March to raise money for Red Nose Day. She overcame her fear of heights and successfully completed the abseil, which was filmed live by the BBC.[20] In June of the same year, Sherburn joined other celebrities including Belinda Fenty (The Island), Stevi Ritchie (The X Factor) and Richard Burr (The Great British Bake Off) for the Santander Cycles bicycle race at Jupiter London Nocturne around Smithfield Market. Sherburn has raised a total of over £30,000 for charity to date.

In December 2015, Sherburn released a Christmas single called "Snow Angels", co-written with Eaton. All money raised from the single was donated to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.[21] Sherburn performed the single at the Dot Com Children's Foundation Fundraising Ball held at Mansion House, accompanied by a dance by Strictly Come Dancing performers, Kristina Rihanoff and Robin Windsor.[22]

2016–present: "YOLO" and touring

In 2016, Sherburn performed her first headline show, at the Hare and Hounds in Birmingham.[23] She released her second single, "YOLO", which she created with producer Ciaron Bell. "I was really happy with this song", Sherburn remarks. "One word sums this up to me: young! It feels like you're on a rollercoaster whilst listening to YOLO – there's so much going on, but that's what life's all about. YOLO relates to everyone. YOLO is about creating amazing memories with friends, finding love and having fun!"[24] The track was remixed by The Wideboys.

In July, Sherburn performed with her band for MPs from the Conservative Party for a summer marquee. She covered a number of British songs, as well as singing some of her own material. Later that year, she performed songs from her as-yet-unreleased album at The Jazz House. In November 2016, Sherburn sang at the Genting Arena in Birmingham at the launch for Free Radio, as part of a line-up which included Little Mix, Olly Murs and Louisa Johnson. Sherburn supported Go West's concert at the Robin 2 in December that year, performing songs from her upcoming album, as well as covers of artists such as David Bowie and Sia.
