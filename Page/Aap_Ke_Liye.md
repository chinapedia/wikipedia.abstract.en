Plot

Shaheer is a sophisticated rich business man but his property becomes the reason of his divorce, and that’s where the story begins. Shaheer’s own sister – along with her husband creates problems in his life because she is after his property. Washma who is a colleague to him comes in his life and falls in love with him. Although she belongs to a very middle-class family but they get along and eventually marry each other. But this class difference and the past remains a problem in their relationship. "'Shaheer will be older than Washma with much more experience in life but in few matters Washma seems more sensible than him. Basically Shaheer is simple and can trust others easily. Although Washma is too young but she has an eye and sense to judge others.' Samina Peerzada just played the role of a very _majbur aurat_ in the play Beqasoor but in this play her character will have more room for performance and the viewers will get to see her in a character which has more to offer than Sadaf of Beqasoor. Talking about her character Faiza Iftikhar said, 'It is a sort of negative character but not evil. There is also _nand bhabi taakra_ but not in a typical way.'"[3]
