Kilver_Court_(geograph_3147706).jpg KILVER COURT is an historic house and gardens in Shepton Mallet in the English county of Somerset. The River Sheppey powered textile mills and it later became a factory, the headquarters of the Showerings brewing business (later part of Allied Domecq), and then the headquarters of a leather-goods manufacturer, Mulberry. It is now used as a shopping centre.


History

Numbers 26, 26B and 27 Kilver street was a country house built around 1650 and since converted into offices and shops. They form a Grade II listed building.[1] It was originally owned by the Whiting family which included Richard Whiting, who used it as their country house close to the mills used in woollen manufacturing, later converting to silk throwers and then lace production[2]

The 19th century dovecote, known as the "Round House" and its adjacent gate piers and gates are also listed.[3][4][5]

Over the course of the 20th century the site has been a factory, the headquarters of the Showerings brewing business (later part of Allied Domecq), and then the headquarters of a leather-goods manufacturer, Mulberry.[6]

It has been used as a venue for the Shepton Mallet Digital Arts Festival.


Gardens

1910 to 1918, for his lace workers.

[8] He used the old mill ponds as boating lakes;[9] and also built a pub and schoolhouse. [10] They became known as Jardineâ€™s Park and included fruit and vegetable plots which provided food for the workers.[11][12][13]

The current layout is a reproduction of a 1960s Chelsea Flower Show medal winning garden designed by George Whitelegg and includes a rockery and parterre.[14] The area adjacent to the river includes hostas, day lilies and candelabra primulas.[15]


Shopping
