The WHITE-THROATED TOUCANET (_Aulacorhynchus albivitta_) is a near-passerine bird found in the Andes from western Venezuela, through Colombia to northern Ecuador.


Taxonomy and systematics

The white-throated toucanet was originally described in the genus _Pteroglossus_. Although not accepted yet by all authorities, the white-throated toucanet was split from the emerald toucanet to form a separate species.[1] The SANTA MARTA TOUCANET and the GREY-THROATED TOUCANET were both formerly considered as a separate species (_Aulacorhynchus lautus_ and _Aulacorhynchus griseigularis_ respectively) until lumped as a subspecies of the white-throated toucanet in 2016.[2] Alternate names for the white-throated toucanet include the ANDEAN TOUCANET, GREYISH-THROATED TOUCANET, NORTH ANDEAN TOUCANET, NORTHERN ANDEAN TOUCANET and SOUTHERN EMERALD TOUCANET.

Subspecies

Four subspecies are recognized:[3]

-   Santa Marta toucanet (_A. a. lautus_) - Bangs, 1898: Originally described as a separate species. Found in the Santa Marta mountains of northern Colombia
-   Grey-throated toucanet (_A. a. griseigularis_) - Chapman, 1915: Originally described as a separate species. Found in northern western Andes and western slope of central Andes (western and central Colombia)
-   (_A. a. phaeolaemus_) - Gould, 1874: Originally described as a separate species. Found on western slope of western Andes (western Colombia)
-   (_A. a. albivitta_) - (Boissonneau, 1840): Found on eastern slope of Central Andes, Eastern Andes (central, eastern Colombia), western Venezuela, eastern Ecuador


Description

Like other toucans, the white-throated toucanet is brightly marked and has a large bill. The adult is long and weight can range from .[4][5] The sexes are alike in appearance, although the female generally is smaller and slightly shorter-billed. It is, as other members of the genus _Aulacorhynchus_, mainly green. The vent and tail-tip are rufous. The bill is black with yellow to the upper mandible and a white band at the base of the bill. Some white-throated toucanets have a rufous patch near the base of the lower mandible. The throat of the Santa Marta toucanet is pale grey-blue and white or grey-blue in the other subspecies. The eye-ring is very dark, almost appearing blackish from a distance. The legs are dull greyish and the iris is dark.
