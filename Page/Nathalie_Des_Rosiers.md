NATHALIE DES ROSIERS (born 1959) is a lawyer, academic and politician in Ontario, Canada. She is a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario who was first elected in 2016. She represents the riding of Ottawa—Vanier and served in the cabinet of Kathleen Wynne.


Background

She was born in Montreal, studied law at the Université de Montréal and received a LLM from Harvard University. Des Rosiers practised law in London, Ontario with Lerners LLP. She also was a law professor at the University of Western Ontario. She then served as dean of the civil law section at the University of Ottawa. She was president of the Law Commission of Canada from 2004 to 2008. Des Rosiers served as general counsel for the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) from 2009 to 2013.[1][2]

During the 2010 G20 Toronto summit, Des Rosiers uncovered a provision invoked by the provincial government which greatly expanded police powers near a security fence on the perimeter of the summit's location. She brought this issue to the attention of the Canadian press and ensured that CCLA volunteers monitored the Toronto police for civil liberties violations during the conference.[3] She also helped to discourage the practice of "carding", where police stop people who are not suspected of any criminal activity, ask for their identification and record that information for later review.[4]

Honours

Des Rosiers was inducted into the Order of Ontario in 2012, and was inducted as a Member of the Order of Canada in 2013 for her work in civil rights and Francophone advocacy. She was named one of Canada's 25 most influential lawyers by _Canadian Lawyer_ in 2011 and in 2012.[5]


Politics

She was chosen as Liberal candidate for a November 2016 by-election to be held in the Ontario riding of Ottawa—Vanier following the resignation of Madeleine Meilleur.[6] She defeated Progressive Conservative challenger and former Ontario ombudsman Andre Marin.

Des Rosiers served as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Energy and Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.[7] She was later appointed Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry. She was re-elected in the 2018 general election.

She announced on May 16, 2019 that she would resign her seat in the legislature at an unspecified date later in 2019 to become a Principal of Massey College at the University of Toronto. She takes office August 1, 2019.[8][9]
