Approximately 30 homes were evacuated and two minor injuries were reported.[2]

Over a dozen homes were evacuated in the Moccasin Ranch Estates subdivision during the first hours of the fire.[3] Pacific Gas and Electric also reported a number of power outages due to the fire. The fire briefly threatened the Hetch Hetchy Regional Water System headquarters, but normal water operations continued throughout the fire.[4]
