The BODENTAL (slov. Boden/kärntn. Slov. Póden) is a remote mountain valley in the Karavanks in the south of Carinthia, Austria. Situated at just over 1,000 metres above sea level, the valley extends southwesterly and can be reached by road or walking trail from the Loiblpass Road. The area is part of the cadastral community of Windisch Bleiberg and since the beginning of 1973 is part of the municipality of Ferlach. The valley is drained via the Bodenbach, which flows over the Tschauko waterfall in the Tscheppa Gorge.

Having one of the most beautiful valley closures of the Limestone Alps, the formerly agricultural 4 km-long mountain valley has developed into a popular leisure area. In summer there is hiking – for example in the nature reserve or to the Klagenfurter Hütte mountain hut. In winter, the valley is one of the few winter sport regions of the Karavanks with ski slope[1], cross-country skiing, winter hiking and sleigh riding.
