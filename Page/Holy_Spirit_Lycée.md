History

In 1952 the Jesuit College was located on Kiriri Hill in eastern Bujumbura, under the name Usumbura Interracial College. Since 1955 it has been named for the Holy Spirit. In 1987 it was taken over by the Burundian government and moved to Kamenge, a northern zone of Bujumbura. In 1990 it was returned to the Jesuits and took its present name. It remains in Kamenge but, following with redivision of the city into new administrative units, it is designated as being in the zone of Gihosha. It operates under the designation of public schools under Catholic management. Teaching is in French language while languages taught include the native Kirundi as well as Swahili and English.

Past rectors include Guillaume Ndayishimiye (1990-2000 and 2011-2016), Ignace Samurenzi (2000-2001 and 2003-2011), Robert Albertijn (2001-2003 ) and Bernard Karerwa(2016- ).
