HINDI CINEMA, often known as BOLLYWOOD and formerly as _Bombay cinema_,[1] is the Indian Hindi-language film industry based in Mumbai (formerly Bombay). The term is a portmanteau of "Bombay" and "Hollywood". The industry is related to Tamil film industry (_Kollywood_), Telugu film industry (_Tollywood_) and other industries, making up Indian Cinema – the world's largest.[2][3]

Indian cinema is the world's largest film industry in film production, with an annual output of 1,986 feature films in 2017. Bollywood is its largest film producer, with 364 Hindi films produced in 2017.[4] Bollywood represents 43 percent of Indian net box-office revenue; Tamil and Telugu cinema represent 36 percent, and the remaining regional cinema constituted 21 percent in 2014.[5] Bollywood is one of the largest centres of film production in the world.[6][7][8] In 2001 ticket sales, Indian cinema (including Bollywood) reportedly sold an estimated 3.6 billion tickets worldwide, compared to Hollywood's 2.6 billion tickets sold.[9][10][11] Bollywood films tend to use a colloquial dialect of Hindi-Urdu (or Hindustani), mutually intelligible by Hindi and Urdu speakers,[12][13][14] and modern Bollywood films increasingly incorporate elements of Hinglish.[15]

The most popular commercial genre in Bollywood since the 1970s has been the masala film, which freely mixes different genres including action, comedy, romance, drama and melodrama along with musical numbers.[16][17][18][19] Masala films generally fall under the musical film genre, of which Indian cinema has been the largest producer since the 1960s when it exceeded the American film industry's total musical output after musical films declined in the West; the first Indian musical talkie was _Alam Ara_ (1931), several years after the first Hollywood musical talkie _The Jazz Singer_ (1927). Alongside commercial masala films, there also exist Bollywood art films known as parallel cinema, which tend to avoid the use of musical numbers. In more recent times, the distinction between commercial masala and parallel cinema has been gradually blurring, as an increasing number of successful commercial films avoid the use of musical numbers, such as _Dangal_ (2016), the highest-grossing Indian film of all time.


Etymology

"Bollywood" is a portmanteau derived from Bombay (the former name for Mumbai) and Hollywood, California, the centre of the American film industry.[20] Unlike Hollywood, Bollywood is not a physical place; its name is criticised by some film journalists and critics, who believe it implies that the industry is a poor cousin of Hollywood.[21][22]

According to OxfordDictionaries.com, the word "Bollywood" originated during the 1970s,[23] when Indian cinema overtook Hollywood in film production. A number of journalists have been credited by newspapers with coining the word.[24] According to a 2004 article in _The Hindu_, journalist Bevinda Collaco coined the word;[25] a _Telegraph_ article the following year report that Amit Khanna was its creator.[26]

According to Madhava Prasad, author of _Surviving Bollywood_, the term "Bollywood" was preceded by "Tollywood", which then referred to the cinema of West Bengal. The Bengali film industry, based in Tollygunge, Calcutta, was referred to as "Tollywood" in a 1932 _American Cinematographer_ article.[27]


History

Early history (1910s–1940s)

Dadasaheb Phalke's silent _Raja Harishchandra_ (1913) is the first feature film made in India. By the 1930s, the industry was producing over 200 films per year.[28] The first Indian sound film, Ardeshir Irani's _Alam Ara_ (1931), was commercially successful.[29] With a great demand for talkies and musicals, Bollywood and the other regional film industries quickly switched to sound films.

The 1930s and 1940s were tumultuous times; India was buffeted by the Great Depression, World War II, the Indian independence movement, and the violence of the Partition. Although most Bollywood films were unabashedly escapist, a number of filmmakers tackled tough social issues or used the struggle for Indian independence as a backdrop for their films.[30] Irani made the first Hindi colour film, _Kisan Kanya_, in 1937. The following year, he made a colour version of _Mother India_. However, colour did not become a popular feature until the late 1950s. At this time, lavish romantic musicals and melodramas were cinematic staples.

Before the 1947 partition of India, which divided the country into the Republic of India and Pakistan, the Bombay film industry (now called Bollywood) was closely linked to the Lahore film industry (now the Lollywood industry of Pakistani cinema); both produced films in Hindi-Urdu (or Hindustani), the _lingua franca_ of northern and central India.[31] Another centre of Hindi-Urdu film production was the Bengali film industry in Calcutta, Bengal Presidency (now Kolkata, West Bengal), which produced Hindi-Urdu films and local Bengali language films.[32][33]

Many actors, filmmakers and musicians from the Lahore industry migrated to the Bombay industry during the 1940s, including actors K.L. Saigal, Prithviraj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar and Dev Anand and singers Mohammed Rafi, Noorjahan, and Shamshad Begum. Around the same time, filmmakers and actors from the Calcutta film industry began migrating to Bombay; as a result, Bombay became the center of Hindi-Urdu film production in the Republic of India after partition. For decades after partition, the Bombay industry was dominated by actors, filmmakers and musicians from Bengal, Punjab (particularly the present-day Pakistani Punjab),[34] and the North-West Frontier Province (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa).[35]

Golden Age (late 1940s–1960s)

The period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s, after India's independence, is regarded by film historians as the Golden Age of Hindi cinema.[36][37][38] Some of the most critically acclaimed Hindi films of all time were produced during this time. Examples include _Pyaasa_ (1957) and _Kaagaz Ke Phool_ (1959), directed by Guru Dutt and written by Abrar Alvi; _Awaara_ (1951) and _Shree 420_ (1955), directed by Raj Kapoor and written by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas, and _Aan_ (1952), directed by Mehboob Khan and starring Dilip Kumar. The films explored social themes, primarily dealing with working-class life in India (particularly urban life) in the first two examples. _Awaara_ presented the city as both nightmare and dream, and _Pyaasa_ critiqued the unreality of urban life.[39]

Mehboob Khan's _Mother India_ (1957), a remake of his earlier _Aurat_ (1940), was the first Indian film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film; it lost by a single vote.[40] _Mother India_ defined conventional Hindi cinema for decades.[41][42][43] It spawned a genre of dacoit films, in turn defined by _Gunga Jumna_ (1961).[44] Written and produced by Dilip Kumar, _Gunga Jumna_ was a dacoit crime drama about two brothers on opposite sides of the law (a theme which became common in Indian films during the 1970s).[45] Some of the best-known epic films of Hindi cinema were also produced at this time, such as K. Asif's _Mughal-e-Azam_ (1960).[46] Other acclaimed mainstream Hindi filmmakers during this period included Kamal Amrohi and Vijay Bhatt.

, Raj Kapoor and Dilip Kumar in _Andaz_ (1949). Kapoor and Kumar are among the greatest and most influential movie stars in the history of Indian cinema,[47][48] and Nargis is one of its greatest actresses.[49]]]

Well-known actors at the time included Dilip Kumar, Pradeep Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand, and Guru Dutt; actresses included Suraiya, Nargis, Sumitra Devi, Madhubala, Meena Kumari, Waheeda Rehman, Nutan, Sadhana, Mala Sinha and Vyjayanthimala.[50] The three most popular male Indian actors of the 1950s and 1960s were Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, and Dev Anand, each with a unique acting style. Kapoor adopted Charlie Chaplin's tramp; Anand modeled himself on suave Hollywood stars like Gregory Peck and Cary Grant, and Kumar pioneered a form of method acting which predated Hollywood method actors such as Marlon Brando. Kumar, who was described as "the ultimate method actor" by Satyajit Ray and is considered one of India's greatest actors, inspired future generations of Indian actors. Much like Brando's influence on Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, Kumar had a similar influence on Amitabh Bachchan, Naseeruddin Shah, Shah Rukh Khan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui.[51][52]

While commercial Hindi cinema was thriving, the 1950s also saw the emergence of a parallel cinema movement.[53] Although the movement (emphasising social realism} was led by Bengali cinema, it also began gaining prominence in Hindi cinema. Early examples of parallel cinema include _Dharti Ke Lal_ (1946), directed by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and based on the Bengal famine of 1943,;[54] _Neecha Nagar_ (1946) directed by Chetan Anand and written by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas,[55] and Bimal Roy's _Do Bigha Zamin_ (1953). Their critical acclaim and the latter's commercial success paved the way for Indian neorealism[56] and the Indian New Wave (synonymous with parallel cinema).[57] Internationally acclaimed Hindi filmmakers involved in the movement included Mani Kaul, Kumar Shahani, Ketan Mehta, Govind Nihalani, Shyam Benegal, and Vijaya Mehta.[58]

in 2010. The first Indian actor to be called a "superstar", he starred in 15 consecutive hit films from 1969 to 1971.]] After the social-realist film _Neecha Nagar_ received the Palme d'Or at the inaugural 1946 Cannes Film Festival,[59] Hindi films were frequently in competition for Cannes' top prize during the 1950s and early 1960s and some won major prizes at the festival.[60] Guru Dutt, overlooked during his lifetime, received belated international recognition during the 1980s.[61][62] Film critics polled by the British magazine _Sight & Sound_ included several of Dutt's films in a 2002 list of greatest films,[63] and Time's All-Time 100 Movies lists _Pyaasa_ as one of the greatest films of all time.[64]

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the industry was dominated by musical romance films with romantic-hero leads; the most popular star was Rajesh Khanna.[65] Other actors during this period include Shammi Kapoor and Shashi Kapoor, the younger brothers of Raj Kapoor, Jeetendra and Sanjeev Kumar; actresses include Sharmila Tagore, Mumtaz, Saira Banu, Helen, and Asha Parekh.

Classic Bollywood (1970s–1980s)

By 1970, Hindi cinema was thematically stagnant[66] and dominated by musical romance films.[67] The arrival of screenwriting duo Salim-Javed (Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar) was a paradigm shift, revitalising the industry.[68] They began the genre of gritty, violent, Bombay underworld crime films early in the decade with films such as _Zanjeer_ (1973) and _Deewaar_ (1975).[69][70] Salim-Javed reinterpreted the rural themes of Mehboob Khan's _Mother India_ (1957) and Dilip Kumar's _Gunga Jumna_ (1961) in a contemporary urban context, reflecting the socio-economic and socio-political climate of 1970s India[71][72] and channeling mass discontent, disillusionment[73] and the unprecedented growth of slums[74] with anti-establishment themes and those involving urban poverty, corruption and crime.[75][76] Their "angry young man", personified by Amitabh Bachchan,[77] reinterpreted Dilip Kumar's performance in _Gunga Jumna_ in a contemporary urban context[78][79] and voice of the anguish of the urban poor.[80]

By the mid-1970s, romantic confections had given way to gritty, violent crime films and action films about gangsters (the Bombay underworld]]) and bandits (dacoits). Salim-Javed's writing and Amitabh Bachchan's acting popularised the trend with films such as _Zanjeer_ and (particularly) _Deewaar_, a crime film inspired by _Gunga Jumna_[81] which pitted "a policeman against his brother, a gang leader based on real-life smuggler Haji Mastan" (Bachchan); according to Danny Boyle, _Deewaar_ was "absolutely key to Indian cinema".[82] In addition to Bachchan, other actors who rode the crest of the trend (which lasted into the early 1990s) include Feroz Khan,[83] Mithun Chakraborty, Naseeruddin Shah, Jackie Shroff, Sanjay Dutt, Anil Kapoor and Sunny Deol. Actresses from the era include Hema Malini, Jaya Bachchan, Raakhee, Shabana Azmi, Zeenat Aman, Parveen Babi, Rekha, Dimple Kapadia, Smita Patil, Jaya Prada and Padmini Kolhapure.[84]

in 2014. The most successful Indian actor in the 1970s and 1980s, he is considered one of India's greatest and most influential movie stars.[85][86][87][88][89]]] The name "Bollywood" was coined during the 1970s,[90][91] when the conventions of commercial Bollywood films were defined.[92] Key to this was the masala film, which combines a number of genres (action, comedy, romance, drama, melodrama, and musical). The masala film was pioneered early in the decade by filmmaker Nasir Hussain,[93] and the Salim-Javed screenwriting duo,[94] pioneering the Bollywood-blockbuster format.[95] _Yaadon Ki Baarat_ (1973), directed by Hussain and written by Salim-Javed, has been identified as the first masala film and the first quintessentially Bollywood film.[96][97] Salim-Javed wrote more successful masala films during the 1970s and 1980s.[98] Masala films made Amitabh Bachchan the biggest Bollywood star of the period. A landmark of the genre was _Amar Akbar Anthony_ (1977),[99][100] directed by Manmohan Desai and written by Kader Khan, and Desai continued successfully exploiting the genre.

Both genres (masala and violent-crime films) are represented by the blockbuster _Sholay_ (1975), written by Salim-Javed and starring Amitabh Bachchan. It combined the dacoit film conventions of _Mother India_ and _Gunga Jumna_ with spaghetti Westerns, spawning the Dacoit Western (also known as the curry Western) which was popular during the 1970s.[101]

Some Hindi filmmakers, such as Shyam Benegal, Mani Kaul, Kumar Shahani, Ketan Mehta, Govind Nihalani and Vijaya Mehta, continued to produce realistic parallel cinema throughout the 1970s.[102][103] Although the art film bent of the Film Finance Corporation was criticised during a 1976 Committee on Public Undertakings investigation which accused the corporation of not doing enough to encourage commercial cinema, the decade saw the rise of commercial cinema with films such as _Sholay_ (1975) which consolidated Amitabh Bachchan's position as a star. The devotional classic _Jai Santoshi Ma_ was also released that year.[104]

By 1983, the Bombay film industry was generating an estimated annual revenue of (7 billion,[105] million|long=no}}),[106] equivalent to ( crore}}, 111.33 billion) when adjusted for inflation. The most internationally acclaimed Hindi film of the 1980s was Mira Nair's _Salaam Bombay!_ (1988), which won the Camera d'Or at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

New Bollywood (1990s–present)

Hindi cinema experienced another period of stagnation during the late 1980s with a box-office decline due to increasing violence, a decline in musical quality, and a rise in video piracy; middle-class family audiences began abandoning the cinema. The turning point came with _Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak_ (1988), directed by Mansoor Khan, written and produced by his father Nasir Hussain and starring his cousin, Aamir Khan, and Juhi Chawla. Its blend of youthfulness, family entertainment, emotional intelligence and strong melodies lured audiences back to the big screen.[107][108] It formed a new template for Bollywood musical romance films which defined 1990s Hindi cinema.[109]

Known since the 1990s as "New Bollywood",[110] contemporary Bollywood is linked to economic liberalization in India during the early 1990s.[111] Early in the decade, the pendulum swung back toward family-centered romantic musicals. _Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak_ was followed by blockbusters such as _Maine Pyar Kiya_ (1989), _Chandni_ (1989), _Hum Aapke Hain Kaun_ (1994), _Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge_ (1995), _Raja Hindustani_ (1996), _Dil To Pagal Hai_ (1997), _Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha_ (1998) and _Kuch Kuch Hota Hai_ (1998). A new generation of popular actors emerged, such as Aamir Khan, Aditya Pancholi, Ajay Devgan, Akshay Kumar, Salman Khan (Salim Khan's son), and Shahrukh Khan; actresses included Madhuri Dixit, Sridevi, Juhi Chawla, Meenakshi Seshadri, Manisha Koirala, Kajol, and Karisma Kapoor.[112] Action and comedy films were also successful, with actors like Govinda, Sunny Deol, Sunil Shetty, Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgan, who (with Akshay Kumar) became popular for performing dangerous stunts in his well-known _Khiladi_ series and other action films.[113][114] Other actresses during this time included Raveena Tandon, Twinkle Khanna, Sonali Bendre, Sushmita Sen, Mahima Chaudhary and Shilpa Shetty.

The decade marked the entrance of new performers in art and independent films, some of which were commercially successful; the most influential example was _Satya_ (1998), directed by Ram Gopal Varma and written by Anurag Kashyap. Its critical and commercial success led to the emergence of a genre known as Mumbai noir:[115] urban films reflecting the city's social problems.[116] This led to a resurgence of parallel cinema by the end of the decade.[117] The films featured actors like Nana Patekar and Manoj Bajpai and actresses such as Manisha Koirala, Tabu, Pooja Bhatt and Urmila Matondkar, whose performances were praised by critics.

Since the 1990s, the biggest Bollywood stars have been Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgan and the Three Khans: Aamir, Shah Rukh, and Salman,[118][119] who have starred in most of the top ten highest-grossing Bollywood films. The Khans have had successful careers since the late 1980s,[120] and have dominated the Indian box office for three decades.[121][122] Shah Rukh Khan was the most successful Indian actor for most of the 1990s and 2000s, and Aamir Khan has been the most successful Indian actor since the mid 2000s;[123] according to _Forbes_, he was "arguably the world's biggest movie star" in 2017 due to his popularity in India and China.[124]

The 2000s saw increased Bollywood recognition worldwide due to growing (and prospering) NRI and Desi communities overseas. The growth of the Indian economy and a demand for quality entertainment in this era led the country's film industry to new heights in production values, cinematography and screenwriting as well as technical advances in areas such as special effects and animation.[125] Some of the largest production houses, among them Yash Raj Films and Dharma Productions were the producers of new modern films.[126] Some popular films of the decade were _Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai_ (2000), _Gadar: Ek Prem Katha_ (2001), _Lagaan_ (2001), _Koi... Mil Gaya_ (2003), _Munna Bhai M.B.B.S._ (2003), _Rang De Basanti_ (2006), _Lage Raho Munna Bhai_ (2006), _Dhoom 2_ (2006), _Krrish_ (2006) and _Jab We Met_ (2007) among others. This decade also saw the rise of popular actors and movie stars like Arjun Rampal, Hrithik Roshan, Abhishek Bachchan, Vivek Oberoi, Shahid Kapoor and John Abraham, as well as actresses like Aishwarya Rai, Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta, Ameesha Patel, Lara Dutta, Bipasha Basu, Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra and Katrina Kaif.

During the 2010s, the industry saw established stars such as Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar and Shahrukh Khan making big-budget masala films like _Dabangg_ (2010), _Ek Tha Tiger_ (2012), _Rowdy Rathore_ (2012), _Chennai Express_ (2013), _Kick_ (2014) and _Happy New Year_ (2014) with much-younger actresses. Although the films were often not praised by critics, they were commercially successful. Aamir Khan has been credited with redefining and modernising the masala film, which originated with his uncle Nasir Hussain's _Yaadon Ki Baarat_ (in which he first appeared) with his distinct brand of socially conscious cinema.[131] His films blur the distinction between commercial masala films and realistic parallel cinema, combining the entertainment and production values of the former with the believable narratives and strong messages of the latter and earning commercial success and critical acclaim in India and overseas.[132]

Most stars from the 2000s continued successful careers into the next decade, and the 2010s saw a new generation of popular actors such as Ranbir Kapoor, Ranveer Singh, Varun Dhawan, Ayushmann Khurana, Rajkumar Rao, Sushant Singh Rajput, Vicky Kaushal, Aditya Roy Kapur, Sidharth Malhotra, Arjun Kapoor and Tiger Shroff. Actresses include Vidya Balan, Kangana Ranaut, Deepika Padukone, Sonam Kapoor, Anushka Sharma, Sonakshi Sinha, Jacqueline Fernandez, Shraddha Kapoor and Alia Bhatt, with Balan and Ranaut widely recognised for successful female-centred films such as _The Dirty Picture_ (2011), _Kahaani_ (2012), _Queen_ (2014), and _Tanu Weds Manu Returns_ (2015). Kareena Kapoor and Bipasha Basu are among the few actresses from the 2000s who have worked for 15 years in the industry.


Influences on Bollywood

Moti Gokulsing and Wimal Dissanayake identify six major influences which have shaped Indian popular cinema:[133]

-   The branching structures of ancient Indian epics, like the _Mahabharata_ and _Ramayana_. Indian popular films often have plots which branch off into sub-plots.
-   Ancient Sanskrit drama, with its stylised nature and emphasis on spectacle in which music, dance and gesture combine "to create a vibrant artistic unit with dance and mime being central to the dramatic experience." Matthew Jones of De Montfort University also identifies the Sanskrit concept of _rasa_, or "the emotions felt by the audience as a result of the actor’s presentation", as crucial to Bollywood films.[134]
-   Traditional folk theater, which became popular around the 10th century with the decline of Sanskrit theater. Its regional traditions include the Jatra of Bengal, the Ramlila of Uttar Pradesh, and the Terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu.
-   Parsi theatre, which "blended realism and fantasy, music and dance, narrative and spectacle, earthy dialogue and ingenuity of stage presentation, integrating them into a dramatic discourse of melodrama. The Parsi plays contained crude humour, melodious songs and music, sensationalism and dazzling stagecraft."
-   Hollywood, where musicals were popular from the 1920s to the 1950s.
-   Western musical television (particularly MTV), which has had an increasing influence since the 1990s. Its pace, camera angles, dance sequences and music may be seen in 2000s Indian films. An early example of this approach was Mani Ratnam's _Bombay_ (1995).

Sharmistha Gooptu identifies Indo-Persian-Islamic culture as a major influence. During the early 20th century, Urdu was the lingua franca of popular cultural performance across northern India and established in popular performance art traditions such as nautch dancing, Urdu poetry, and Parsi theater. Urdu and related Hindi dialects were the most widely understood across northern India, and Hindustani became the standard language of early Indian talkies. Films based on "Persianate adventure-romances" led to a popular genre of "_Arabian Nights_ cinema".[135]

Scholars Chaudhuri Diptakirti and Rachel Dwyer and screenwriter Javed Akhtar identify Urdu literature as a major influence on Hindi cinema.[136][137][138] Most of the screenwriters and scriptwriters of classic Hindi cinema came from Urdu literary backgrounds,[139][140] from Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and Akhtar ul Iman to Salim-Javed and Rahi Masoom Raza; a handful came from other Indian literary traditions, such as Bengali and Hindi literature.[141] Most of Hindi cinema's classic scriptwriters wrote primarily in Urdu, including Salim-Javed, Gulzar, Rajinder Singh Bedi, Inder Raj Anand, Rahi Masoom Raza and Wajahat Mirza.[142] Urdu poetry and the ghazal tradition strongly influenced filmi (Bollywood lyrics).[143][144] Javed Akhtar was also greatly influenced by Urdu novels by Pakistani author Ibn-e-Safi, such as the _Jasoosi Dunya_ and _Imran_ series of detective novels;[145] they inspired, for example, famous Bollywood characters such as Gabbar Singh in _Sholay_ (1975) and Mogambo in _Mr. India_ (1987).[146]

Todd Stadtman identifies several foreign influences on 1970s commercial Bollywood masala films, including New Hollywood, Italian exploitation films, and Hong Kong martial arts cinema.[147] After the success of Bruce Lee films (such as _Enter the Dragon_) in India,[148] _Deewaar_ (1975) and other Bollywood films incorporated fight scenes inspired by 1970s martial arts films from Hong Kong cinema until the 1990s.[149] Bollywood action scenes emulated Hong Kong rather than Hollywood, emphasising acrobatics and stunts and combining kung fu (as perceived by Indians) with Indian martial arts such as pehlwani.[150]


Influence of Bollywood

India

Perhaps Bollywood's greatest influence has been on India's national identity, where (with the rest of Indian cinema) it has become part of the "Indian story".[151] In India, Bollywood is often associated with India's national identity. According to economist and Bollywood biographer Meghnad Desai, "Cinema actually has been the most vibrant medium for telling India its own story, the story of its struggle for independence, its constant struggle to achieve national integration and to emerge as a global presence".[152]

Scholar Brigitte Schulze has written that Indian films, most notably Mehboob Khan's _Mother India_ (1957), played a key role in shaping the Republic of India's national identity in the early years after independence from the British Raj; the film conveyed a sense of Indian nationalism to urban and rural citizens alike.[153] Bollywood has long influenced Indian society and culture as the biggest entertainment industry; many of the country's musical, dancing, wedding and fashion trends are Bollywood-inspired. Bollywood fashion trendsetters have included Madhubala in _Mughal-e-Azam_ (1960) and Madhuri Dixit in _Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!_ (1994).[154]

Bollywood has also had a socio-political impact on Indian society, reflecting Indian politics.[155] In classic 1970s Bollywood films, Bombay underworld crime films written by Salim-Javed and starring Amitabh Bachchan such as _Zanjeer_ (1973) and _Deewaar_ (1975) reflected the socio-economic and socio-political realities of contemporary India. They channeled growing popular discontent and disillusionment and state failure to ensure welfare and well-being at a time of inflation, shortages, loss of confidence in public institutions, increasing crime[156] and the unprecedented growth of slums.[157] Salim-Javed and Bachchan's films dealt with urban poverty, corruption and organised crime;[158] they were perceived by audiences as anti-establishment, often with an "angry young man" protagonist presented as a vigilante or anti-hero[159] whose suppressed rage voiced the anguish of the urban poor.[160]

Overseas

Bollywood has been a significant form of soft power for India, increasing its influence and changing overseas perceptions of India.[161][162] In Germany, Indian stereotypes included bullock carts, beggars, sacred cows, corrupt politicians, and catastrophes before Bollywood and the IT industry transformed global perceptions of India.[163] According to author Roopa Swaminathan, "Bollywood cinema is one of the strongest global cultural ambassadors of a new India."[164][165] Its role in expanding India's global influence is comparable to Hollywood's similar role with American influence.[166]

During the 2000s, Bollywood began influencing musical films in the Western world and was instrumental role in reviving the American musical film. Baz Luhrmann said that his musical film, _Moulin Rouge!_ (2001), was inspired by Bollywood musicals;[167] the film incorporated a Bollywood-style dance scene with a song from the film _China Gate_. The critical and financial success of _Moulin Rouge!_ began a renaissance of Western musical films such as _Chicago_, _Rent_, and _Dreamgirls_.[168]

Indian film composer A. R. Rahman wrote the music for Andrew Lloyd Webber's _Bombay Dreams_, and a musical version of _Hum Aapke Hain Koun_ was staged in London's West End. The Bollywood sports film _Lagaan_ (2001) was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and two other Bollywood films (2002's _Devdas_ and 2006's _Rang De Basanti_) were nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language.

Danny Boyle's _Slumdog Millionaire_ (2008), which won four Golden Globes and eight Academy Awards, was inspired by Bollywood films[169][170] and is considered an "homage to Hindi commercial cinema".[171] It was also inspired by Mumbai-underworld crime films, such as _Deewaar_ (1975), _Satya_ (1998), _Company_ (2002) and _Black Friday_ (2007).[172] _Deewaar_ had a Hong Kong remake, _The Brothers_ (1979),[173] which inspired John Woo's internationally acclaimed breakthrough _A Better Tomorrow_ (1986);[174][175] the latter was a template for Hong Kong action cinema's heroic bloodshed genre.[176][177] "Angry young man" 1970s epics such as _Deewaar_ and _Amar Akbar Anthony_ (1977) also resemble the heroic-bloodshed genre of 1980s Hong Kong action cinema.[178]

The influence of _filmi_ may be seen in popular music worldwide. Technopop pioneers Haruomi Hosono and Ryuichi Sakamoto of the Yellow Magic Orchestra produced a 1978 electronic album, _Cochin Moon_, based on an experimental fusion of electronic music and Bollywood-inspired Indian music.[179] Truth Hurts' 2002 song "Addictive", produced by DJ Quik and Dr. Dre, was lifted from Lata Mangeshkar's "Thoda Resham Lagta Hai" in _Jyoti_ (1981).[180] The Black Eyed Peas' Grammy Award winning 2005 song "Don't Phunk with My Heart" was inspired by two 1970s Bollywood songs: "Ye Mera Dil Yaar Ka Diwana" from _Don_ (1978) and "Ae Nujawan Hai Sub" from _Apradh_ (1972).[181] Both songs were composed by Kalyanji Anandji, sung by Asha Bhosle, and featured the dancer Helen.[182]

The Kronos Quartet re-recorded several R. D. Burman compositions sung by Asha Bhosle for their 2005 album, _You've Stolen My Heart: Songs from R.D. Burman's Bollywood_, which was nominated for Best Contemporary World Music Album at the 2006 Grammy Awards. _Filmi_ music composed by A. R. Rahman (who received two Academy Awards for the _Slumdog Millionaire_ soundtrack) has frequently been sampled by other musicians, including the Singaporean artist Kelly Poon, the French rap group La Caution and the American artist Ciara. Many Asian Underground artists, particularly those among the overseas Indian diaspora, have also been inspired by Bollywood music.

Bollywood films are primarily musicals, and are expected to have catchy song-and-dance numbers woven into the script. A film's success often depends on the quality of such musical numbers.[183] A film's music is often released before the film itself, increasing its audience.

Indian audiences expect value for money, and a good film is generally referred to as _paisa vasool_, (literally "money's worth").[184] Songs, dances, love triangles, comedy and dare-devil thrills are combined in a three-hour show (with an intermission). These are called _masala films_, after the Hindi word for a spice mixture. Like _masalas_, they are a mixture of action, comedy and romance; most have heroes who can fight off villains single-handedly. Bollywood plots have tended to be melodramatic, frequently using formulaic ingredients such as star-crossed lovers, angry parents, love triangles, family ties, sacrifice, political corruption, kidnapping, villains, kind-hearted courtesans, long-lost relatives and siblings, reversals of fortune and serendipity.

Parallel cinema films, in and outside Bollywood, tended to be less popular at the box office. A large Indian diaspora in English-speaking countries and increased Western influence in India have nudged Bollywood films closer to Hollywood.[185]

According to film critic Lata Khubchandani, "Our earliest films ... had liberal doses of sex and kissing scenes in them. Strangely, it was after Independence the censor board came into being and so did all the strictures."[186] Although Bollywood plots feature Westernised urbanites dating and dancing in clubs rather than pre-arranged marriages, traditional Indian culture continues to exist outside the industry and is an element of resistance by some to Western influences.[187] Bollywood plays a major role, however, in Indian fashion.[188] Studies have indicated that some people, unaware that changing fashion in Bollywood films is often influenced by globalisation, consider the clothes worn by Bollywood actors as authentically Indian.[189]

Bollywood employs people from throughout India. It attracts thousands of aspiring actors and actresses hoping for a break in the industry. Models and beauty contestants, television actors, stage actors and ordinary people come to Mumbai with the hope of becoming a star. As in Hollywood, very few succeed. Since many Bollywood films are shot abroad, many foreign extras are employed.[190]

Very few non-Indian actors are able to make a mark in Bollywood, although many have tried. There have been exceptions, however, and the hit film _Rang De Basanti_ starred the English Alice Patten. _Kisna_, _Lagaan_, and _The Rising: Ballad of Mangal Pandey_ also featured foreign actors, and Australian-born actress Emma Brown Garett has starred in a few Indian films.

Bollywood can be insular, and relatives of film-industry figures have an edge in obtaining coveted roles in films or being part of a film crew. However, industry connections are no guarantee of a long career: competition is fierce, and film-industry scions will falter if they do not succeed at the box office. Stars such as Dilip Kumar, Dharmendra, Amitabh Bachchan, Rajesh Khanna, Rishi Kapoor, Anil Kapoor, Sunny Deol, Sridevi, Madhuri Dixit and Shah Rukh Khan lacked show-business connections.


Dialogues and lyrics

Film scripts (known as dialogues in Indian English) and their song lyrics are often written by different people. Scripts are usually written in an unadorned Hindi-Urdu, known as Hindustani, which would be understood by the largest possible audience.[191] Bollywood films tend to use a colloquial dialect of Hindi-Urdu, mutually intelligible by Hindi and Urdu speakers.[192] Most of the classic scriptwriters of what is known as Hindi cinema, including Salim-Javed, Gulzar, Rajinder Singh Bedi, Inder Raj Anand, Rahi Masoom Raza and Wajahat Mirza, primarily wrote in Urdu. Salim-Javed wrote in Urdu script, which was then transcribed by an assistant into Devanagari script so Hindi readers could read the Urdu dialogues.[193] During the 1970s, the Urdu writers and screenwriters Krishan Chander and Ismat Chughtai said that "more than seventy-five per cent of films are made in Urdu" but were categorised as Hindi films by the government.[194] Urdu poetry has strongly influenced Bollywood songs, whose lyrics also draw from the ghazal tradition.[195]

Some films have used regional dialects to evoke a village setting, or archaic Urdu in medieval historical films. In her book, _The Cinematic ImagiNation_, Jyotika Virdi wrote about the presence of Urdu in Hindi films: "Urdu is often used in film titles, screenplay, lyrics, the language of love, war, and martyrdom." Virdi notes that although Urdu was widely used in classic Hindi cinema decades after partition because it was widely taught in pre-partition India, its use has declined in modern Hindi cinema: "The extent of Urdu used in commercial Hindi cinema has not been stable ... the decline of Urdu is mirrored in Hindi films ... It is true that many Urdu words have survived and have become part of Hindi cinema's popular vocabulary. But that is as far as it goes ... For the most part, popular Hindi cinema has forsaken the florid Urdu that was part of its extravagance and retained a 'residual' Urdu".[196] However, Urdu continues to be used in Bollywood films for dialogues and (particularly) songs.[197]

Contemporary mainstream films also use English; according to the article "Bollywood Audiences Editorial", "English has begun to challenge the ideological work done by Urdu."[198] Some film scripts are first written in Latin script.[199] Characters may shift from one language to the other to evoke a particular atmosphere (for example, English in a business setting and Hindi in an informal one). The blend of Hindi, Urdu and English sometimes heard in modern Bollywood films, known as Hinglish, has become increasingly common.[200]

Cinematic language (in dialogues or lyrics) is often melodramatic, invoking God, family, mother, duty, and self-sacrifice. Song lyrics are often about love. Bollywood song lyrics (especially in older films) frequently use the poetic vocabulary of court Urdu, with a number of Persian loanwords.[201] Another source for love lyrics in films such as _Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baje_ and _Lagaan_ is the long Hindu tradition of poetry about the loves of Krishna, Radha, and the gopis.

Music directors often prefer working with certain lyricists, and the lyricist and composer may be seen as a team. This phenomenon has been compared to the pairs of American composers and songwriters who created classic Broadway musicals.


Sound

Sound in early Bollywood films was usually not recorded on location (sync sound). It was usually created (or re-created) in the studio,[202] with the actors speaking their lines in the studio and sound effects added later; this created synchronisation problems.[203] Commercial Indian films are known for their lack of ambient sound, and the Arriflex 3 camera necessitated dubbing. _Lagaan_ (2001) was filmed with sync sound,[204] and several Bollywood films have recorded on-location sound since then.


Female makeup artists

In 1955, the Bollywood Cine Costume Make-Up Artist & Hair Dressers' Association (CCMAA) ruled that female makeup artists were barred from membership.[205] The Supreme Court of India ruled in 2014 that the ban violated Indian constitutional guarantees under Article 14 (right to equality), 19(1)(g) (freedom to work) and Article 21 (right to liberty).[206] According to the court, the ban had no "rationale nexus" to the cause sought to be achieved and was "unacceptable, impermissible and inconsistent" with the constitutional rights guaranteed to India's citizens.[207] The court also found illegal the rule which mandated that for any artist to work in the industry, they must have lived for five years in the state where they intend to work.[208] In 2015, it was announced that Charu Khurana was the first woman registered by the Cine Costume Make-Up Artist & Hair Dressers' Association.[209]


Song and dance

Bollywood film music is called _filmi_ (from the Hindi "of films"). Bollywood songs were introduced with Ardeshir Irani's _Alam Ara_ (1931) song, "De De Khuda Ke Naam pay pyaare".[210] Bollywood songs are generally pre-recorded by professional playback singers, with the actors then lip syncing the words to the song on-screen (often while dancing). Although most actors are good dancers, few are also singers; a notable exception was Kishore Kumar, who starred in several major films during the 1950s while having a rewarding career as a playback singer. K. L. Saigal, Suraiyya, and Noor Jehan were known as singers and actors, and some actors in the last thirty years have sung one or more songs themselves.

Songs can make and break a film, determining whether it will be a flop or a hit: "Few films without successful musical tracks, and even fewer without any songs and dances, succeed".[211] Globalization has changed Bollywood music, with lyrics an increasing mix of Hindi and English. Global trends such as salsa, pop and hip hop have influenced the music heard in Bollywood films.[212]

Playback singers are featured in the opening credits, and have fans who will see an otherwise-lackluster film to hear their favourites. Notable Bollywood singers are Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Geeta Dutt, Shamshad Begum, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Sadhana Sargam and Alka Yagnik (female), and K. L. Saigal, Talat Mahmood, Mukesh, Mohammed Rafi, Manna Dey, Hemant Kumar, Kishore Kumar, Kumar Sanu, Udit Narayan and Sonu Nigam (male). Kishore Kumar and Mohammed Rafi have been considered the finest singers of Bollywood songs, followed by Lata Mangeshkar (who has recorded thousands of songs for Indian films in her six-decade career). Composers of film music, known as music directors, are also well-known. Remixing of film songs with modern rhythms is common, and producers may release remixed versions of some of their films' songs with the films' soundtrack albums.

Dancing in Bollywood films, especially older films, is modeled on Indian dance: classical dance, dances of north-Indian courtesans (tawaif) or folk dances. In modern films, Indian dance blends with Western dance styles as seen on MTV or in Broadway musicals; Western pop and classical-dance numbers are commonly seen side-by-side in the same film. The hero (or heroine) often performs with a troupe of supporting dancers. Many song-and-dance routines in Indian films contain unrealistically-quick shifts of location or changes of costume between verses of a song. If the hero and heroine dance and sing a duet, it is often staged in natural surroundings or architecturally-grand settings.

Songs typically comment on the action taking place in the film. A song may be worked into the plot, so a character has a reason to sing. It may externalise a character's thoughts, or presage an event in the film (such as two characters falling in love). The songs are often referred to as a "dream sequence", with things happening which would not normally happen in the real world. Song and dance scenes were often filmed in Kashmir but, due to political unrest in Kashmir since the end of the 1980s,[213] they have been shot in western Europe (particularly Switzerland and Austria).[214][215]

Contemporary Bollywood dancers include Madhuri Dixit, Hrithik Roshan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Sridevi, Meenakshi Seshadri, Malaika Arora Khan, Shahid Kapoor and Tiger Shroff.[216] Older dancers include Helen[217] (known for her cabaret numbers), Madhubala, Vyjanthimala, Padmini, Hema Malini, Mumtaz, Cuckoo Moray,[218] Parveen Babi[219] , Waheeda Rahman,[220] Meena Kumari,[221] and Shammi Kapoor.[222]

Bollywood producers have been releasing a film's soundtrack (as tapes or CDs) before the film's release, hoping that the music will attract audiences; a soundtrack is often more popular than its film. Some producers also release music videos, usually (but not always) with a song from the film.


Finances

Bollywood films are multi-million dollar productions, with the most expensive productions costing up to 1 billion (about US$20 million). The science-fiction film _Ra.One_ was made on a budget of 1.35 billion (about $27 million), making it the most expensive Bollywood film of all time.[223] Sets, costumes, special effects and cinematography were less than world-class, with some notable exceptions, until the mid-to-late 1990s. As Western films and television are more widely distributed in India, there is increased pressure for Bollywood films to reach the same production levels (particularly in action and special effects). Recent Bollywood films, like _Krrish_ (2006), have employed international technicians such as Hong Kong-based action choreographer Tony Ching. The increasing accessibility of professional action and special effects, coupled with rising film budgets, have seen an increase in action and science-fiction films.

Since overseas scenes are attractive at the box office, Mumbai film crews are filming in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Indian producers have also obtained funding for big-budget films shot in India, such as _Lagaan_ and _Devdas_.

Funding for Bollywood films often comes from private distributors and a few large studios. Although Indian banks and financial institutions had been forbidden from lending to film studios, the ban has been lifted.[224] Finances are not regulated; some funding comes from illegitimate sources such as the Mumbai underworld, which is known to influence several prominent film personalities. Mumbai organised-crime hitmen shot Rakesh Roshan, a film director and father of star Hrithik Roshan, in January 2000. In 2001, the Central Bureau of Investigation seized all prints of _Chori Chori Chupke Chupke_ after the film was found to be funded by members of the Mumbai underworld.[225]

Another problem facing Bollywood is widespread copyright infringement of its films. Often, bootleg DVD copies of movies are available before they are released in cinemas. Manufacturing of bootleg DVD, VCD, and VHS copies of the latest movie titles is an established small-scale industry in parts of south and southeast Asia. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) estimates that the Bollywood industry loses $100 million annually from unlicensed home videos and DVDs. In addition to the homegrown market, demand for these copies is large amongst portions of the Indian diaspora. Bootleg copies are the only way people in Pakistan can watch Bollywood movies, since the Pakistani government has banned their sale, distribution and telecast. Films are frequently broadcast without compensation by small cable-TV companies in India and other parts of South Asia. Small convenience stores, run by members of the Indian diaspora in the US and the UK, regularly stock tapes and DVDs of dubious provenance; consumer copying adds to the problem. The availability of illegal copies of movies on the Internet also contributes to industry losses.

Satellite TV, television and imported foreign films are making inroads into the domestic Indian entertainment market. In the past, most Bollywood films could make money; now, fewer do. Most Bollywood producers make money, however, recouping their investments from many sources of revenue (including the sale of ancillary rights). There are increasing returns from theatres in Western countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, where Bollywood is slowly being noticed. As more Indians migrate to these countries, they form a growing market for upscale Indian films. In 2002, Bollywood sold 3.6 billion tickets and had a total revenue (including theatre tickets, DVDs and television) of $1.3 billion; Hollywood films sold 2.6 billion tickets, and had a total revenue of $51 billion.


Advertising

A number of Indian artists hand-painted movie billboards and posters. M. F. Husain painted film posters early in his career; human labour was found to be cheaper than printing and distributing publicity material.[226] Most of the large, ubiquitous billboards in India's major cities are now created with computer-printed vinyl. Old hand-painted posters, once considered ephemera, are collectible folk art.[227][228][229][230]

Releasing film music, or music videos, before a film's release may be considered a form of advertising. A popular tune is believed to help attract audiences.[231] Bollywood publicists use the Internet as a venue for advertising. Most bigger-budget films have a websites on which audiences can view trailers, stills and information on the story, cast, and crew.[232] Bollywood is also used to advertise other products. Product placement, used in Hollywood, is also common in Bollywood.[233]


International filming

Bollywood's increasing use of international settings such as Switzerland, London, Paris, New York, Mexico, Brazil and Singapore does not necessarily represent the people and cultures of those locales. Contrary to these spaces and geographies being filmed as they are, they are actually Indianised by adding Bollywood actors and Hindi speaking extras to them. While immersing in Bollywood films, viewers get to see their local experiences duplicated in different locations around the world.

According to Shakuntala Rao, "Media representation can depict India's shifting relation with the world economy, but must retain its 'Indianness' in moments of dynamic hybridity";[234] "Indianness" (cultural identity) poses a problem with Bollywood's popularity among varied diaspora audiences, but gives its domestic audience a sense of uniqueness from other immigrant groups.[235]


Awards

The Filmfare Awards are some of the most prominent awards given to Hindi films in India.[236] The Indian screen magazine _Filmfare_ began the awards in 1954 (recognising the best films of 1953), and they were originally known as the Clare Awards after the magazine's editor. Modeled on the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' poll-based merit format, individuals may vote in separate categories. A dual voting system was developed in 1956.[237]

The National Film Awards were also introduced in 1954. The Indian government has sponsored the awards, given by its Directorate of Film Festivals (DFF), since 1973. The DFF screens Bollywood films, films from the other regional movie industries, and independent/art films. The awards are made at an annual ceremony presided over by the president of India. Unlike the Filmfare Awards, which are chosen by the public and a committee of experts, the National Film Awards are decided by a government panel.[238]

Other awards ceremonies for Hindi films in India are the Screen Awards (begun in 1995) and the Stardust Awards, which began in 2003. The International Indian Film Academy Awards (begun in 2000) and the Zee Cine Awards, begun in 1998, are held abroad in a different country each year.


Global markets

In addition to their popularity among the Indian diaspora from Nigeria and Senegal to Egypt and Russia, generations of non-Indians have grown up with Bollywood.[239] Indian cinema's early contacts with other regions made inroads into the Soviet Union, the Middle East, Southeast Asia,[240] and China.[241] Bollywood entered the consciousness of Western audiences and producers during the late 20th century,[242][243] and Western actors now seek roles in Bollywood films.[244]

Asia-Pacific

South Asia

Bollywood films are also popular in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal, where Hindi-Urdu is widely understood. Many Pakistanis understand Hindi, due to its linguistic similarity to Urdu.[245] Although Pakistan banned the import of Bollywood films in 1965, trade in unlicensed DVDs[246] and illegal cable broadcasts ensured their continued popularity. Exceptions to the ban were made for a few films, such as the colorized re-release of _Mughal-e-Azam_ and _Taj Mahal_ in 2006. Early in 2008, the Pakistani government permitted the import of 16 films.[247] More easing followed in 2009 and 2010. Although it is opposed by nationalists and representatives of Pakistan's small film industry, it is embraced by cinema owners who are making a profit after years of low receipts.[248] The most popular actors in Pakistan are the three Khans of Bollywood: Salman, Shah Rukh, and Aamir. The most popular actress is Madhuri Dixit;[249] at India-Pakistan cricket matches during the 1990s, Pakistani fans chanted "_Madhuri dedo, Kashmir lelo!_" ("Give Madhuri, take Kashmir!")[250] Bollywood films in Nepal earn more than Nepali films, and Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar and Shah Rukh Khan are popular in the country.

The films are also popular in Afghanistan due to its proximity to the Indian subcontinent and their cultural similarities, particularly in music. Popular actors include Shah Rukh Khan, Ajay Devgan, Sunny Deol, Aishwarya Rai, Preity Zinta, and Madhuri Dixit.[251] A number of Bollywood films were filmed in Afghanistan and some dealt with the country, including _Dharmatma_, _Kabul Express_, _Khuda Gawah_ and _Escape From Taliban_.[252][253]

Southeast Asia

Bollywood films are popular in Southeast Asia, particularly in maritime Southeast Asia. The three Khans are very popular in the Malay world, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. The films are also fairly popular in Thailand.[254]

India has cultural ties with Indonesia, and Bollywood films were introduced to the country at the end of World War II in 1945. The "angry young man" films of Amitabh Bachchan and Salim-Javed were popular during the 1970s and 1980s before Bollywood's popularity began gradually declining in the 1980s and 1990s. It experienced an Indonesian revival with the release of Shah Rukh Khan's _Kuch Kuch Hota Hai_ (1998) in 2001, which was a bigger box-office success in the country than _Titanic_ (1997). Bollywood has had a strong presence in Indonesia since then, particularly Shah Rukh Khan films such as _Mohabbatein_ (2000), _Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..._ (2001), _Kal Ho Naa Ho_, _Chalte Chalte_ and _Koi... Mil Gaya_ (all 2003), and _Veer-Zaara_ (2004).[255]

East Asia

Some Bollywood films have been widely appreciated in China, Japan, and South Korea. Several Hindi films have been commercially successful in Japan, including Mehboob Khan's _Aan_ (1952, starring Dilip Kumar) and Aziz Mirza's _Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman_ (1992, starring Shah Rukh Khan). The latter sparked a two-year boom in Indian films after its 1997 release,[256] with _Dil Se.._ (1998) a beneficiary of the boom.[257] The highest-grossing Hindi film in Japan is _3 Idiots_ (2009), starring Aamir Khan,[258] which received a Japanese Academy Award nomination.[259] The film was also a critical and commercial success in South Korea.[260]

_Dr. Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani_, _Awaara_, and _Do Bigha Zamin_ were successful in China during the 1940s and 1950s, and remain popular with their original audience. Few Indian films were commercially successful in the country during the 1970s and 1980s, among them Tahir Hussain's _Caravan_, _Noorie_ and _Disco Dancer_.[261][262] Indian film stars popular in China included Raj Kapoor, Nargis,[263] and Mithun Chakraborty.[264] Hindi films declined significantly in popularity in China during the 1980s.[265] Films by Aamir Khan have recently been successful,[266][267][268] and _Lagaan_ was the first Indian film with a nationwide Chinese release in 2011.[269][270] Chinese filmmaker He Ping was impressed by _Lagaan_ (particularly its soundtrack), and hired its composer A. R. Rahman to score his _Warriors of Heaven and Earth_ (2003).[271]

When _3 Idiots_ was released in China, China was the world's 15th-largest film market (partly due to its widespread pirate DVD distribution at the time). The pirate market introduced the film to Chinese audiences, however, and it became a cult hit. According to the Douban film-review site, _3 Idiots_ is China's 12th-most-popular film of all time; only one domestic Chinese film (_Farewell My Concubine_) ranks higher, and Aamir Khan acquired a large Chinese fan base as a result.[272] After _3 Idiots_, several of Khan's other films (including 2007's _Taare Zameen Par_ and 2008's _Ghajini_) also developed cult followings.[273] China became the world's second-largest film market (after the United States) by 2013, paving the way for Khan's box-office success with _Dhoom 3_ (2013), _PK_ (2014), and _Dangal_ (2016).[274] The latter is the 16th-highest-grossing film in China,[275] the fifth-highest-grossing non-English language film worldwide,[276] and the highest-grossing non-English foreign film in any market.[277][278][279] Several Khan films, including _Taare Zameen Par_, _3 Idiots_, and _Dangal_, are highly rated on Douban.[280][281] His next film, _Secret Superstar_ (2017, starring Zaira Wasim), broke _Dangal_{{'}}s record for the highest-grossing opening weekend by an Indian film and cemented Khan's status[282] as "a king of the Chinese box office";[283][284] _Secret Superstar_ was China's highest-grossing foreign film of 2018 to date.[285] Khan has become a household name in China,[286] with his success described as a form of Indian soft power[287] improving China–India relations despite political tensions.[288][289][290] With Bollywood competing with Hollywood in the Chinese market,[291] the success of Khan's films has driven up the price for Chinese distributors of Indian film imports.[292] Salman Khan's _Bajrangi Bhaijaan_ and Irrfan Khan's _Hindi Medium_ were also Chinese hits in early 2018.[293]

Oceania

Although Bollywood is less successful on some Pacific islands such as New Guinea, it ranks second to Hollywood in Fiji (with its large Indian minority), Australia and New Zealand.[294] Australia also has a large South Asian diaspora, and Bollywood is popular amongst non-Asians in the country as well.[295] Since 1997, the country has been a backdrop for an increasing number of Bollywood films.[296] Indian filmmakers, attracted to Australia's diverse locations and landscapes, initially used the country as a setting for song-and-dance scenes;[297] however, Australian locations now figure in Bollywood film plots.[298] Hindi films shot in Australia usually incorporate Australian culture. Yash Raj Films' _Salaam Namaste_ (2005), the first Indian film shot entirely in Australia, was the most successful Bollywood film of 2005 in that country.[299] It was followed by the box-office successes _Heyy Babyy_, (2007) _Chak De! India_ (2007), and _Singh Is Kinng_ (2008).[300] Prime Minister John Howard said during a visit to India after the release of _Salaam Namaste_ that he wanted to encourage Indian filmmaking in Australia to increase tourism, and he appointed Steve Waugh as tourism ambassador to India.[301] Australian actress Tania Zaetta, who appeared in _Salaam Namaste_ and several other Bollywood films, was eager to expand her career in Bollywood.[302]

Eastern Europe and Central Asia

Bollywood films are popular in the former Soviet Union (Russia, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia),[303] and have been dubbed into Russian. Indian films were more popular in the Soviet Union than Hollywood films[304][305] and, sometimes, domestic Soviet films.[306] The first Indian film released in the Soviet Union was _Dharti Ke Lal_ (1946), directed by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and based on the Bengal famine of 1943, in 1949.[307] Three hundred Indian films were released in the Soviet Union after that;[308] most were Bollywood films with higher average audience figures than domestic Soviet productions.[309][310] Fifty Indian films had over 20 million viewers, compared to 41 Hollywood films.[311][312] Some, such as _Awaara_ (1951) and _Disco Dancer_ (1982), had more than 60 million viewers[313][314] and established actors Raj Kapoor, Nargis,[315] Rishi Kapoor[316] and Mithun Chakraborty in the country.[317]

According to diplomat Ashok Sharma, who served in the Commonwealth of Independent States,

After the collapse of the Soviet film-distribution system, Hollywood filled the void in the Russian film market and Bollywood's market share shrank.[318] A 2007 Russia Today report noted a renewed interest in Bollywood by young Russians.[319]

In Poland, Shah Rukh Khan has a large following. He was introduced to Polish audiences with the 2005 release of _Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..._ (2001) and his other films, including _Dil Se.._ (1998), _Main Hoon Na_ (2004) and _Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna_ (2006), became hits in the country. Bollywood films are often covered in _Gazeta Wyborcza_, formerly Poland's largest newspaper.[320][321]

Middle East and North Africa

Hindi films have become popular in Arab countries,[322] and imported Indian films are usually subtitled in Arabic when they are released. Bollywood has progressed in Israel since the early 2000s, with channels dedicated to Indian films on cable television;[323] MBC Bollywood and Zee Aflam show Hindi movies and serials.[324]

In Egypt, Bollywood films were popular during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1987, however, they were restricted to a handful of films by the Egyptian government.[325][326] Amitabh Bachchan has remained popular in the country[327] and Indian tourists visiting Egypt are asked, "Do you know Amitabh Bachchan?"[328]

Bollywood movies are regularly screened in Dubai cinemas, and Bollywood is becoming popular in Turkey; _Barfi!_ was the first Hindi film to have a wide theatrical release in that country.[329] Bollywood also has viewers in Central Asia (particularly Uzbekistan[330] and Tajikistan).[331]

South America

Bollywood films are not influential in most of South America, although its culture and dance is recognised. Due to significant South Asian diaspora communities in Suriname[332] and Guyana, however, Hindi-language movies are popular.[333] In 2006, _Dhoom 2_ became the first Bollywood film to be shot in Rio de Janeiro.[334] In January 2012, it was announced that UTV Motion Pictures would begin releasing films in Peru with _Guzaarish_.[335]

Africa

Hindi films were originally distributed to some parts of Africa by Lebanese businessmen, and _Mother India_ (1957) continued to be screened in Nigeria decades after its release. Indian movies have influenced Hausa clothing, songs have been covered by Hausa singers, and stories have influenced Nigerian novelists. Stickers of Indian films and stars decorate taxis and buses in Nigeria's Northern Region, and posters of Indian films hang on the walls of tailoring shops and mechanics' garages. Unlike Europe and North America, where Indian films cater to the expatriate marke, Bollywood films became popular in West Africa despite the lack of a significant Indian audience. One possible explanation is cultural similarity: the wearing of turbans, animals in markets; porters carrying large bundles, and traditional wedding celebrations. Within Muslim culture, Indian movies were said to show "respect" toward women; Hollywood movies were seen as having "no shame". In Indian movies, women are modestly dressed; men and women rarely kiss and there is no nudity, so the films are said to "have culture" which Hollywood lacks. The latter "don't base themselves on the problems of the people"; Indian films are based on socialist values and the reality of developing countries emerging from years of colonialism. Indian movies permitted a new youth culture without "becoming Western."[336] The first Indian film shot in Mauritius was _Souten_, starring Rajesh Khanna, in 1983.[337]

In South Africa, film imports from India were watched by black and Indian audiences.[338] Several Bollywood figures have travelled to Africa for films and off-camera projects. _Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav_ (2005) was filmed in South Africa.[339] _Dil Jo Bhi Kahey..._ (2005) was also filmed almost entirely in Mauritius, which has a large ethnic-Indian population.

Bollywood, however, seems to be diminishing in popularity in Africa. New Bollywood films are more sexually explicit and violent. Nigerian viewers observed that older films (from the 1950s and 1960s) had more culture and were less Westernised.[340] The old days of India avidly "advocating decolonization ... and India's policy was wholly influenced by his missionary zeal to end racial domination and discrimination in the African territories" were replaced.[341] The emergence of Nollywood (West Africa's film industry) has also contributed to the declining popularity of Bollywood films, as sexualised Indian films became more like American films.

Kishore Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan have been popular in Egypt and Somalia.[342] In Ethiopia, Bollywood movies are shown with Hollywood productions in town square theatres such as the Cinema Ethiopia in Addis Ababa.[343] Less-commercial Bollywood films are also screened elsewhere in North Africa.[344]

Western Europe and North America

]] The first Indian film to be released in the Western world and receive mainstream attention was _Aan_ (1952), directed by Mehboob Khan and starring Dilip Kumar and Nimmi. It was subtitled in 17 languages and released in 28 countries,[345] including the United Kingdom,[346] the United States, and France.[347] _Aan_ was praised in the contemporary British press, and _The Times_ compared it favourably to Hollywood productions.[348] Mehboob Khan's later Academy Award-nominated _Mother India_ (1957) was a success in overseas markets, including Europe,[349] Russia, the Eastern Bloc, French territories, and Latin America.[350]

Many Bollywood films have been commercially successful in the United Kingdom. The most successful Indian actor at the UK box office has been Shah Rukh Khan, whose popularity in British Asian communities played a key role in introducing Bollywood to the UK[351] with films such as _Darr_ (1993),[352] _Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge_ (1995),[353] and _Kuch Kuch Hota Hai_ (1998).[354] _Dil Se_ (1998) was the first Indian film to enter the UK top ten.[355] A number of Indian films, such as _Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge_ and _Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham_ (2001), have been set in London.

Bollywood is also appreciated in France, Germany, the Netherlands,[356] and Scandinavia. Bollywood films are dubbed in German and shown regularly on the German television channel RTL II.[357] Germany is the second-largest European market for Indian films, after the United Kingdom. The most recognised Indian actor in Germany is Shah Rukh Khan, who has had box-office success in the country with films such as _Don 2_ (2011)[358] and _Om Shanti Om_ (2007).[359] He has a large German fan base,[360] particularly in Berlin (where the tabloid _Die Tageszeitung_ compared his popularity to that of the pope).[361]

Films such as _The Guru_ (2002) and _Marigold: An Adventure in India_ (2007) attempted to popularise Bollywood for Hollywood.


Plagiarism

Pressured by rushed production schedules and small budgets, some Bollywood writers and musicians have been known to plagiarise. Ideas, plot lines, tunes or riffs have been copied from other Indian film industries or foreign films (including Hollywood and other Asian films) without acknowledging the source.[365]

Before the 1990s, plagiarism occurred with impunity. Copyright enforcement was lax in India, and few actors or directors saw an official contract.[366] The Hindi film industry was not widely known to non-Indian audiences (except in the Soviet states), who would be unaware that their material had been copied. Audiences may not have been aware of plagiarism, since many in India were unfamiliar with foreign films and music.[367] Although copyright enforcement in India is still somewhat lenient, Bollywood and other film industries are more aware of each other and Indian audiences are more familiar with foreign movies and music. Organisations such as the India EU Film Initiative seek to foster a community between filmmakers and industry professionals in India and the European Union.[368]

A commonly-reported justification for plagiarism in Bollywood is that cautious producers want to remake popular Hollywood films in an Indian context. Although screenwriters generally produce original scripts, many are rejected due to uncertainty about whether a film will be successful.[369] Poorly-paid screenwriters have also been criticised for a lack of creativity.[370] Some filmmakers see plagiarism in Bollywood as an integral part of globalisation, with which Western (particularly American) culture is embedding itself into Indian culture.[371] Vikram Bhatt, director of _Raaz_ (a remake of _What Lies Beneath_ starring Bipasha Basu) and _Kasoor_ (a remake of _Jagged Edge_), has spoken about the influence of American culture and Bollywood's desire to produce box-office hits based along the same lines: "Financially, I would be more secure knowing that a particular piece of work has already done well at the box office. Copying is endemic everywhere in India. Our TV shows are adaptations of American programmes. We want their films, their cars, their planes, their Diet Cokes and also their attitude. The American way of life is creeping into our culture."[372] According to Mahesh Bhatt, "If you hide the source, you're a genius. There's no such thing as originality in the creative sphere".[373]

Although very few cases of film-copyright violations have been taken to court because of a slow legal process,[374] the makers of _Partner_ (2007) and _Zinda_ (2005) were targeted by the owners and distributors of the original films: _Hitch_ and _Oldboy_.[375][376] The American studio 20th Century Fox brought Mumbai-based B. R. Films to court over the latter's forthcoming _Banda Yeh Bindaas Hai_, which Fox alleged was an illegal remake of _My Cousin Vinny_. B. R. Films eventually settled out of court for about $200,000, paving the way for its film's release.[377] Some studios comply with copyright law; in 2008, Orion Pictures secured the rights to remake Hollywood's _Wedding Crashers_.[378]

Music

One of the most frequently plagiarised musicians was the Pakistani Qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. His music began influencing Bollywood during the late 1980s, peaking in the 1990s; many Indian music directors plagiarised Khan's music to produce hit _filmi_ songs.[379][380][381] Vedpal's "Yeh Jo Halka Halka Suroor Hai" in _Souten Ki Beti_ (1989) and Anu Malik's "Mera Piya Ghar Aaya" in _Yaarana_ (1995) are based on Khan's songs.[382] Viju Shah's hit, "Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast Mast" in _Mohra_ (1994), was plagiarised from Khan's popular Qawwali song "Dam Mast Qalandar".[383] Several Nadeem-Shravan songs are based on Khan's songs, including "Kisika Yaar Na Bichde" in _Shreemaan Aashique_ (1993), "Kitna Pyara Tujhe Rab Ne Banaya" in _Raja Hindustani_ (1996), "Mujhe Ek Pal Chain Na Awe" in _Judaai_ (1997),[384] and "Bheed Me Tanhai Me" in _Tumsa Nahin Dekha: A Love Story_ (2004).[385] Other Bollywood songs based on Khan's music include K. K. Mahajan's "Zamaana Deewana Ho Gaya" in _Zamaana Deewana_ (1995) and Laxmikant-Pyarelal's "Wada Karke Sajan Nahi Aaya" in _Barsaat Ki Raat_ (1998), among others.[386]

A number of Bollywood songs were also copied from other Pakistani musicians. The earliest example was "Moam Ki Gurrya" in _Baaghon Main Bahaar Aayi_ (1972), copied from Bakhshi Wazir's "Jadon Holi Jayi" in the Pakistani film _Utt Khuda Da Wair_ (1970). Bollywood hits were copied from Pakistani composer M. Ashraf; _Police Public_ (1990) copied "Main Jis Din Bhula Doon" from _Khushboo_ (1979), _Kal Ki Awaz_ (1992) copied "Kisi Meherban Ne Aa Ke" from _Shama_ (1974), and Laxmikant–Pyarelal's "Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai" in _Khalnayak_ (1993) copied "Raat De Bara Baje" from the Pakistani films _Do Badan_ (1974) and _Zabardast_ (1989).[387] In _Beqabu_ (1996), Anu Malik copied "Yaariyan" from a 1993 song by the Pakistani band Vital Signs with singer Junaid Jamshed. Pritam copied "Aahun Aahun" in _Love Aaj Kal_ (2009) from Shaukat Ali's "Kadi Te Has" (1984); "Janambhoomi Pe" in _Agnipankh_ (2004) from Abrar-ul-Haq's "Bheega Bheega Sa" (1998), and "Akhiya Na" in _Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena_ (2005) from Waris Baig's "Challa" (2004). Nadeem–Shravan copied "Tuu Meri Zindagi Hain" in _Aashiqui_ (1990) from a 1976 song by Pakistani singer Tassawar Khanum; "Tumhein Apna Banaane Ki" in _Sadak_ (1991) from the ghazal song "Chale To" (1983) by Pakistani singer Musarrat Nazir, and "O Rabba" in _Zamaana Deewana_ (1995) from M. Ashraf's "Chahe Duniya" in Naheed Akhtar's Pakistani film _Naukar_ (1975).[388][389]

Bollywood soundtracks also plagiarised Guinean singer Mory Kanté, particularly his 1987 album _Akwaba Beach_. His song, "Tama", inspired two Bollywood songs: Bappi Lahiri's "Tamma Tamma" in _Thanedaar_ (1990) and "Jumma Chumma" in Laxmikant-Pyarelal's soundtrack for _Hum_ (1991). The latter also featured "Ek Doosre Se", which copied Kanté's "Inch Allah".[390] His song "Yé ké yé ké" was used as background music in the 1990 Bollywood film _Agneepath_, inspired the Bollywood song "Tamma Tamma" in _Thanedaar_, and was copied by Mani Sharma's "Pellikala Vachesindhe" in the 1997 Telugu film _Preminchukundam Raa_.[391]
