Background

In 2014, Mabey co-founded Art+Feminism with Siân Evans, Michael Mandiberg, and Laurel Ptak.[4] in response to the fact that only about 10% of the editors of Wikipedia were female. The 2014 event had 600 volunteers and the 2015 event had double that number at 1300 with events hosted all over the world.[5] _Foreign Policy_ magazine listed Mabey as one of the 100 Leading Global Thinkers of 2014.[6] In 2016, Art+Feminism had over 2,500 participants.[7]
