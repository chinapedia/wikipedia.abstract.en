JAGRAN FILM FESTIVAL (JFF) is perhaps the world's largest travelling film festival rooted in India, conducted since 2010.[1][2][3][4] The festival is a Jagran Prakashan Group initiative aimed at promoting the appreciation of the cinematic art beyond the major metropolitan cities of India to smaller towns. The seventh edition started in Delhi, travelling through Kanpur, Lucknow, Allahabad, Varanasi, Agra, Meerut, Dehradun, Hisar, Ludhiana, Patna, Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Raipur, Indore, and Bhopal, and culminated in Mumbai. The 8th edition offers prize money in various competitive film sections such as Jagran Shorts ( a competitive section for international short films), World Panorama ( a competitive section for international feature films), the Indian Showcase (a competitive section for Indian feature films) and Cinema of the Sellers ( a competitive section for advertising and public service advertising films)...
