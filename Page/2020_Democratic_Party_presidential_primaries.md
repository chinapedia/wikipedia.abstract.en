The 2020 DEMOCRATIC PARTY PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES AND CAUCUSES will be a series of electoral contests organized by the Democratic Party to select the approximately 3,768 pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention, who by pledged votes shall elect the Democratic nominee for President of the United States in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[1] The elections are scheduled to take place from February to June 2020, within all fifty U.S. states, the District of Columbia, five U.S. territories, and Democrats Abroad.

Independently of the result of primaries and caucuses, the Democratic Party will, from its group of party leaders and elected officials, also appoint 764 unpledged delegates (superdelegates) to participate in its national convention. In contrast to all previous election cycles, superdelegates will no longer have the right to cast decisive votes at the convention's first ballot for the presidential nomination (limiting their voting rights to either non-decisive votes on the first ballot or decisive votes for subsequent ballots on a contested convention).[2][3][4]

Twenty-seven major candidates have entered the race for the 2020 Democratic Party presidential nomination. Two of them, Richard Ojeda and Eric Swalwell, have opted to withdraw so far. This is the largest field of presidential candidates for any political party in the post-reform era of American history, exceeding the field of 17 major candidates that sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.[5]


Background

After Hillary Clinton's loss in the previous election, many felt the Democratic Party lacked a clear leader.[6] There remained divisions in the party following the 2016 primaries which pitted Clinton against Bernie Sanders.[7][8] Between the 2016 election and the 2018 midterm elections, Senate Democrats have generally shifted to the political left in relation to college tuition, healthcare, and immigration.[9][10]

Soon after the 2016 general election, the division between Clinton and Sanders supporters was highlighted in the 2017 Democratic National Committee chairmanship election between Tom Perez and Keith Ellison.[11] Perez was narrowly elected Chairman and subsequently appointed Ellison as the Deputy Chair, a largely ceremonial role.[12][13] Several candidates began releasing serious policy proposals early in 2019 resulting in the "invisible primary" being more visible than in previous elections. The number of candidates running for the presidency is the largest in "modern history".[14]

Reforms since 2016

On August 25, 2018, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) members passed reforms to the Democratic Party's primary process in order to increase participation[15] and ensure transparency.[16] State parties are encouraged to use a government-run primary whenever available and increase the accessibility of their primary through same-day or automatic registration and same-day party switching. Caucuses are required to have absentee voting, or to otherwise allow those who cannot participate in person to be included.[17]

The new reforms also regulate how the Democratic National Convention shall handle the outcome of primaries and caucuses for three potential scenarios:[18][19]

1.  IF A SINGLE CANDIDATE WINS AT LEAST 2,267 PLEDGED DELEGATES: Superdelegates will be allowed to vote at first ballot, as their influence can not overturn the majority of pledged delegates.
2.  IF A SINGLE CANDIDATE WINS 1,885-2,266 PLEDGED DELEGATES: Superdelegates will be barred from voting at first ballot, which solely will be decided by the will of pledged delegates.
3.  IF NO CANDIDATE WILL WIN MORE THAN 1,884 PLEDGED DELEGATES: This will result in a contested convention, where superdelegates are barred from voting at the first formal ballot, but regain their right to vote for their preferred presidential nominee for all subsequent ballots needed until the delegates reach a majority.

The reforms mandate that superdelegates refrain from voting on the first presidential nominating ballot, unless a candidate via the outcome of primaries and caucuses already has gained enough votes (more than 50% of all delegate votes) among only the elected pledged delegates. The prohibition for superdelegates to vote at the first ballot for the last two mentioned scenarios, does not preclude superdelegates from publicly endorsing a candidate of their choosing before the convention.[20]

In a contested convention where no majority of minimum 1,885 pledged delegate votes is found for a single candidate in the first ballot, all superdelegates will then regain their right to vote on any subsequent ballot necessary in order for a presidential candidate to be nominated (raising the majority needed for such to 2,267 votes).[21][22]


Candidates

Declared candidates

In addition to having filed with the Federal Election Commission to run for president in the Democratic Party primary in 2020 and having confirmed this by an official campaign announcement (while still campaigning actively as of today), the 25 major candidates have either: (a) held public office, (b) been included in a minimum of five independent national polls, or (c) received substantial media coverage.[23][24][25][26][27][28]

Major candidates for the Democratic nomination have included a former vice president (Biden), one former cabinet secretary (Castro), two governors (Bullock and Inslee), one former governor (Hickenlooper), seven U.S. senators (Bennet, Booker, Gillibrand, Harris, Klobuchar, Sanders, Warren), one former U.S. senator (Gravel), four representatives (Gabbard, Moulton, Swalwell, Ryan), three former representatives (Delaney, O'Rourke, Sestak), one former state senator (Ojeda), three mayors (Buttigieg, de Blasio, Messam), and three candidates who have never held elected office (Steyer, Williamson, Yang).

2017

John_Delaney_(46743402692).jpgIn the weeks following the election of Donald Trump in the 2016 election, media speculation regarding potential candidates for the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries began to circulate. As the Senate began confirmation hearings for members of the cabinet, speculation centered on the prospects of the "hell-no caucus", six senators who went on to vote against the majority of Trump's nominees. According to Politico, the members of the "hell-no caucus" were Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, Jeff Merkley and Elizabeth Warren.[181][182] Other speculation centred on then-Vice-President Joe Biden, making a third presidential bid following failed attempts in 1988 and 2008. Biden had previously served as U.S. senator from Delaware (1973-2009).[183]

On July 28, 2017, U.S. representative John Delaney became the first major Democrat to announce their candidacy in an op-ed in The Washington Post.[184] On November 6, 2017, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang became the second major Democrat to announce their candidacy.[185]

2018

In August 2018, Democratic Party officials and television networks begin discussions as to the nature and scheduling of the following year's debates and the nomination process.[186] In December 2018, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced the preliminary schedule for 12 official DNC-sanctioned debates, set to begin in June 2019, with six debates in 2019 and the remaining six during the first four months of 2020. Following these announcements, there was a general consensus that debates would have a greater, influential role in the primaries.

-   Northern Mariana Islands caucuses (previously held on March 12, 2016)
-   Wyoming caucuses (previously held on April 9, 2016): The state party initially via its draft plan proposed a party-run caucus for March 2020,[266][267] then shortly considered moving it to April 18,[268] but may have the option of replacing it with a party-run primary (as a government-run primary is not an option in the state).

The 57 states, districts, territories, or other constituencies with elections of pledged delegates to decide the Democratic presidential nominee, currently plan to hold the first major determining step for these elections via 49 primaries and 6 caucuses (Iowa, Nevada and four territories),[270] while two states (Wyoming and Maine) have not yet decided their election format - as their state parties currently consider approving last minute changes to their earlier drafted state delegate selection plans.[271] The number of states holding caucuses decreased from 14 in the 2016 nomination process to so far only two in 2020.[272]


National convention

The 2020 Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on July 13–16, 2020.[273][274][275]

In addition to Milwaukee, the DNC also considered bids from three other cities: Houston, Texas;[276] Miami Beach, Florida;[277] and Denver, Colorado. Denver, though, was immediately withdrawn from consideration by representatives for the city, who cited scheduling conflicts.[278]


Endorsements


Campaign finance

This is an overview of the money being raised and spent by each campaign for the entire period running from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2019, as it was reported to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Total raised are the sum of all individual contributions (large and small), loans from the candidate, and transfers from other campaign committees. The last column, Cash On Hand (COH), has been calculated by subtracting the "spent" amount from the "raised" amount, thereby showing the remaining cash each campaign had available for its future spending as of June 30, 2019.
