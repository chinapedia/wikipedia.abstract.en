KARL FAZER MILK CHOCOLATE, commonly known as FAZER BLUE (), is a Finnish brand of milk chocolate owned by the Fazer corporation.[1][2] The common name derives from the iconic blue color of its wrapper, which is a registered trademark of the Fazer corporation.[3]

Fazer Blue is often measured to be the most sold confectionery in Finland. It also regularly polls as the most respected brand among Finns, particularly in polls conducted by the magazine _Markkinointi & Mainonta_ and the polling organization Taloustutkimus OY.[4]

The chocolate is widely considered a part of Finnish cultural heritage and cuisine.[5] It owes its unique taste to the use of fresh milk in production, as opposed to powdered and condensed milk commonly used in chocolate manufacturing. Compared to other chocolates, Fazer Blue also has a relatively high milk concentration.[6]

The chocolate is sold in various forms and amounts, ranging from slabs to boxes of confectionery pieces.


History

The chocolate was brought to market in 1922. According to the Fazer corporation, the Swiss recipe was a gift to the Fazer family from an Englishman.[7][8] The recipe has remained unchanged since.

In 2001, the Fazer Blue color, Pantone C 280 , became Finland's first color trademark.[9] At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Karl Fazer Milk Chocolate sponsored the Finnish sailing team.
