The FIFTH SEASON of _THE AMAZING RACE CANADA_ is a reality game show based on the American series _The Amazing Race_. It features teams of two, each with a pre-existing relationship. The grand prize includes: a cash payout, a "once-in-a-lifetime" trip for two around the world, and a 2018 Chevrolet Equinox "True North Edition" for each.[1] For the fifth year in a row, Jon Montgomery returned as the host.

The season premiered on July 4, 2017, with the season finale airing on September 12. Dating couple Sam Lambert and Paul Mitskopoulos were the winners of this season.


Production

Development and filming

Signal_Hill_and_Cabot_Tower,_St._John's,_Newfoundland,_Canada.jpg, overlooking the city of St. John's, served as the Starting Line of the fifth season of _The Amazing Race Canada_.]] On October 12, 2016, CTV announced that the show was renewed for the fifth season.[2]

This season featured the addition of several real-time interactive features during the airing of each episode, including trivia, polls, and a national leaderboard. Additionally, viewers were able to explore locations seen throughout the race through virtual 360 degree views, including this season's starting line: Signal Hill National Historic Site in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador[3]

Included among the 360-degree view videos on CTV's official YouTube page was of a game of underwater hockey being played in the swimming pool at the Centre Sportif de Gatineau in Gatineau, Quebec.[4] This is the only 360-degree location to never be seen nor mentioned on air, so it is unknown whether this was originally intended to be a task during Leg 6's visit to Gatineau, or was simply unaired.

To mark the occasion of 2017 being the 150th anniversary of the Confederation of Canada, some legs featured a specially-themed task that is identified as such.

According to executive producer John Brunton, an overseas visit to Kenya was originally planned, but was scrapped due to safety concerns.[5]

Sam and Paul were the local Pit Stop greeters of Leg 6, Season 6, at Ireland Park in their hometown of Toronto.

Casting

Casting began on October 12, 2016, and as in the previous four seasons, an online site was used for submission of applications and audition videos. Casting closed on December 1, 2016. The cast includes former _Canada's Next Top Model_, cycle 3 contestant Ebonie Finley-Roberge, who placed 8th.[6][7]

Programming

Similar to previous seasons, a special season-end reunion/recap again titled _After The Race_, again hosted by the cast of _The Social_, aired immediately after the season finale with all teams present – minus Ebonie who was unable to attend – to review the season as a whole.

Marketing

Trip sponsor Hotels.com, outerwear sponsor Mountain Equipment Co-op, and Mentos discontinued their sponsorship; Chevrolet continued sponsoring the show along with multiple previous seasons' sponsor, Bank of Montreal (BMO). New sponsors for this season are trip sponsor Sinorama, Canadian Tire's Woods brand as outerwear/outfitter sponsor, and the Campbell Soup Company.[8]

As additional marketing for _Race_ sponsor Chevrolet, following each episode, a special series by previous season winners Steph LeClair and Kristen McKenzie entitled _Backseat Drivers_ (a reference to the Roadblock clue in leg 6 of their season) was featured in the bonus videos. In these roughly two-and-a-half-minute clips, Steph & Kristen discussed the events of the previous episode while driving a differing Chevrolet vehicle, sometimes then stopping to pick up a team from a previous season and discuss what's changed in their lives since their respective _Race_. The feature teams included: Hal & Joanne and Holly & Brett from Season 1, Rex & Bob from Season 2, Brent & Sean and Hamilton & Michaelia from Season 3, Frankie & Amy from Season 4, and this year's winners Sam & Paul for the finale installment.[9][10]

During the Pit Stop, all teams were moved to Miraflores Locks on the banks of the Panama Canal to begin this leg of the _Race_. This leg's Detour was a choice between The Cart or The Horse, both located – including the Speed Bump – at the Aulie Family Farm outside the town of Rouleau, southwest of Regina. For their Speed Bump, Karen & Bert had to use pitchforks to clean out manure-covered hay from a horse stall in the stable, then lay down fresh hay in its place before they could continue with the Detour. In The Cart, teams had to maneuver a self-propelled grain auger to a grain cart, locate the auger's screw conveyor power switch, then shovel of Canadian-developed canola seed into the auger's mouth and convey it into the grain cart to receive their next clue. In The Horse, teams had to lead an auction for a Clydesdale horse. One team member was the auctioneer who had to memorize and recite the horse's story to bidders, and call out asking prices. The other team member was the bid catcher who had to relay bids to their partner both verbally and with hand signals. They received their next clue once selling the horse for a price of at least C$6,000.

For this leg's Roadblock, teams travelled to Grandpa's Garden in the hamlet of Caron, west of Moose Jaw, where one team member had to dress as a beekeeper and search the honeycombs of a hive of 20,000 honey bees for the one queen bee and correctly point her out to a judge to receive their next clue.

Additional tasks

-   Teams travelled to Douglas Park Elementary School. As part of the _Grant a Wish_ campaign from _Race_ sponsor _BMO_, teams had to squeeze a full pitcher of orange juice from oranges and serve the juice to a lunchroom of children to receive their next clue from wish recipient Leanne, whose wish is for every child to receive a healthy breakfast.
-   After the Detour, teams travelled into Rouleau to the Dog River Hotel, one of the locations from the CTV sitcom _Corner Gas_, which was filmed in and around the community. Outside in a parking space was the Double U-Turn board.
-   Teams then travelled to the city of Moose Jaw's Crescent Park. Following an example photograph, teams had to correctly arrange – graphics forward and cans right-side up – 250 cans of _Race_ sponsor Campbell Soup Company's _Chunky_ soup on a provided base into a maple leaf shape to receive their next clue from Christopher, the _Amazing Race Canada Superfan Contest_ winner.

Additional information

-   Upon arriving in Regina, teams found 2017 Chevrolet Cruzes in the airport parking lot that would serve as their transportation for this leg, with a choice between either a sedan or a hatchback model.

Leg 10 (Saskatchewan → Ontario)

Crokicurl_2017_01_26.jpg, a combination of two iconic Canadian pastimes – crokinole and curling]] AIRDATE: September 5, 2017

-   Regina (Regina International Airport) to Sault Ste. Marie, ONTARIO (Sault Ste. Marie Airport)

-   Sault Ste. Marie (Agawa Canyon Railway) __
-   Sault Ste. Marie (Mockin'bird Hill Pioneer Farm _or_ Kinsmen Park)

-   Sault Ste. Marie (John Rhodes Community Centre) (_Face Off_)
-   Sault Ste. Marie (Mill Market – Entomica)

-   Sault Ste. Marie (Bellevue Park – Topsail Island)

This leg's Detour was a choice between Alpac-It or I'll Cast It. In Alpac-It, teams travelled to the Mockin'bird Hill Pioneer Farm, where they had to lead two alpacas through an obstacle course of nine obstacles, without knocking any down, in a time of three minutes or less to receive their next clue. In I'll Cast It, teams travelled to Kinsmen Park, where they put on hip waders and entered Kinsmen Lake. Here, each team member had to cast their rod to hit three floating targets by fly fishing to receive their next clue.

For this leg's Roadblock, teams travelled to Entomica in Mill Market. The team member not performing the Roadblock had to insert their head into a plexiglass box, after which four species of live giant cockroaches were dropped on them. The team member who was performing the Roadblock then had to count the correct number of each species to receive their next clue.

Additional tasks

-   At a designated rail crossing, teams boarded the Agawa Canyon Tour train to ride it through the Algoma Highlands and Agawa Canyon. In one coach car, they found the titles and critiques of 14 works by the Canadian artists known as the Group of Seven, and prints of the corresponding works in the next coach car. They then had to memorize and, in the front baggage car, correctly identify all 14 to receive the clue for the Detour from the conductor. However, the task must be completed within the 30 minute travel time, otherwise they must remain on the train and wait for the round trip to complete before they can try again.
-   After the Detour, teams travelled to the John Rhodes Community Centre Pool, where they found the final Face Off of the season. On a circular curling sheet, teams competed against each other in Crokicurl – a recently developed[12] game that is a cross between curling and the Canadian-created board game crokinole. Each ring has a specific point value. Across from their partner, each team member took turns throwing six curling stones, attempting to knock out their opponent's stones while keeping theirs in place to score the most points. If the opposing stone is in play, it must be hit. If a stone lands in the direct centre, or "button", it is worth 20 points and the stone is removed from play. After all stones are thrown, the team with the higher score received the clue for the Roadblock. The team who arrived earlier had the choice of taking their turn first or second. The last team remaining at the Face Off had to turn over an hourglass and wait out a time penalty before moving on.

Additional information

-   Upon arriving in Sault Ste. Marie, teams found their next clue inside 2017 Chevrolet Colorado ZR-2s in the airport parking lot that would serve as their transportation for this leg.

Leg 11 (Ontario → Quebec)

Montmorency_Falls,_bridge,_Quebec_City.jpg had one team member climb down a cargo net suspended from the pedestrian bridge over Montmorency Falls]] AIRDATE: September 12, 2017

-   Sault Ste. Marie (Sault Ste. Marie Airport) to Quebec City, QUEBEC (Québec City Jean Lesage International Airport)

-   Quebec City (Québec City Jean Lesage International Airport – Airport Control Tower)
-   Quebec City (Montmorency Falls)

-   Quebec City (Saint-Roch – Place de Bordeaux)
-   Quebec City (Carnaval de Québec Warehouse)
-   Quebec City (Le Musée du chocolat Érico)
-   Quebec City (Édifice Marie-Guyart – Observatoire de la Capitale)

-   Quebec City (Morrin Centre)
-   Sainte-Famille, Île d'Orléans (Parc des Ancêtres)

In the first Roadblock of this leg, one team member had to attach a harness and a climb down a cargo net suspended from the pedestrian bridge over the waterfall to retrieve their next clue, then climb back up to reunite with their partner.

In the final Roadblock of the race, the team member who did not perform the first Roadblock had to pull themselves up the side of the 31-storey Édifice Marie-Guyart, Quebec City's tallest building, to the rooftop. Once there, they had to search the city to spot a yellow and red _Race_ flag on the roof of their next destination, the Morrin Centre, then take the elevator back down to reunite with their partner.

Additional tasks

-   Upon arrival in Quebec City, teams had to search outside the airport for their next clue, which was near the control tower.
-   After the first Roadblock, teams travelled to the Place de Bordeaux plaza in the Saint-Roch neighbourhood of Old Quebec. With one team member as driver and the other as dispatcher, teams chose a bike rickshaw. Using only a location list, map with street names and places written in French, and walkie-talkies, the dispatcher had to give the driver directions through the streets of Old Quebec to pick up three passengers carrying a card colour-coded to each team, and transport them to their proper destination, after which each would give the card to the driver. After returning to Place de Bordeaux with all three cards, they received their next clue.
-   Teams then had to travel to the storage warehouse of the Quebec Winter Carnival to search among the many figures of _Bonhomme_, the famous snowman mascot of the festival, to find their next clue, which was a box of chocolates wrapped in yellow and red ribbon, from Érico Chocolatier, their next destination. Written on the bottom of the box was "trade in for next clue".
-   Once there, teams exchanged the box for a giant chocolate egg to break open for the second Roadblock clue inside.
-   After spotting it in the second Roadblock, teams travelled to the Morrin Centre for the final challenge in the library. Teams found a bag containing over 150 puzzle pieces forming a large map of Canada, and 10 cards referencing challenges throughout the race, 6 of which were the _150 Challenges_. Once the puzzle was fully assembled in a tabletop frame, they then had to place only the 6 correct 150 Challenge cards over the city in which they took place to receive their final clue.
