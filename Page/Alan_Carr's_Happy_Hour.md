Production

In October 2016, it was announced that Channel 4 had commissioned a new pre-watershed show titled _Alan Carr: Happy Hour_,[2] a spin-off to _Alan Carr: Chatty Man_, which was cancelled on 9 October 2016 due to low ratings battled against BBC One's _The Graham Norton Show_, which got higher ratings. _Happy Hour_ was to be similar to _Chatty Man_, however without interviews with celebrities or alcohol, as Channel 4 wanted to attract a younger audience. There would also be audience surprises and games.

The show aired on Fridays at 8 pm on Channel 4.
