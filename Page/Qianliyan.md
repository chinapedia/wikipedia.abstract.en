QIANLIYAN is a Chinese sea and door god. He usually appears with Shunfeng'er as a guardian of the temples of the sea goddess Mazu.


Name

The name "Qianliyan" literally means "He of the Thousand-Mile" or "League Eyes" but may be taken more generally as "Hawkeye", "Lynx-Eyed",[1] "Far-Seeing",[2] or even "All-Seeing"[3] or "Clairvoyant"[4] as a distance of 1,000 li was idiomatic in Chinese for any great distance.[5] It also appears as [6] and [7] His partner Shunfeng'er's name similarly means "Sharp-Eared" or "All-Hearing".

Under the Ming, Qianliyan was also known as LILOU.


History

Qianliyan is first attested in the early-16th century novel _Journey to the West_, where he appears as the personified form of the Taoist Jade Emperor's eyes[8] and one of his lieutenants. There is, however, an earlier depiction of him in the caves of Shimen _Shíménshān_) in Sichuan which has been dated to the Southern Song.[9] The Chinese folk tale about the Ten Brothers also probably long predates its first publication during the Ming Dynasty; in it, the eldest two brothers have powers just like those of Qianliyan and Shunfeng'er.[10]

Qianliyan next appeared as a lieutenant of the Emperor of Flowering Brightness _Huáguāng Dàdì_) in Yu Xiangdou's _Journey to the South_ and as a character in Xu Zhonglin's _Creation of the Gods_.[11] He was confused with the door god Shenshu _Shēnshū_) and, particularly, gradually conflated with the earlier sea god Zhaobao Qilang _Zhāobǎo Qīláng_) as he was supplanted by the cult of Mazu.


Religion stories

Qianliyan's sharp vision is employed to help protect sailors at night and during fog and other inclement weather.[12] In some accounts, he is capable of seeing everything in the world.[13]

Qianliyan is most often portrayed as a demon defeated and tamed or befriended by the sea goddess Mazu. By one account, he and Shunfeng'er appeared off Meizhou Island during a storm and were defeated by Mazu's magical silk scarf, which blew clouds of sand into their eyes and ears. After their submission, they pledged their loyalty when she kindly healed them of the damage she had caused them.[14] In another, the two were Song generals who competed for her hand at Peach Blossom Mountain _Táohuā Shān_) but were both defeated by her kung fu.[15] In another, the two were the brothers Gao Ming and Gao Jue. Ruthless generals, they fell at Peach Blossom Mountain and subsequently haunted it as demons. They appeared to Mazu when she traveled nearby and challenged her to battle, with the loser to do the winner's bidding. They intended to have her marry them both but were defeated by her magic and became her servants.[16][17] In still another, the Gao brothers were bandits during the Shang before they began to haunt the mountain.[18]

In still another account, the pair were originally warriors or guards of King Zhou of Shang.[19] In this version of the story, they are sometimes said to have already possessed their superhuman powers and to have used them to foil the first moves towards rebellion by the Zhou. Ji Fa's advisor Jiang Ziya is made out to have been a Taoist adept, however, who uses the esoteric knowledge he received from the Primordial Lord of Heaven on to defeat them. Their powers fail them when he covers them in the blood of a black dog and Ji Fa is able to triumph at Muye and finally establish himself as the Martial King of Zhou ("King Wu").[20]

Worship

Qianliyan most often appears as a door god at Mazuist temples[21] or as a guardian beside Mazu at her altars[22] or on her yellow paper charms. He is separately worshipped in some villages and by mariners for assistance avoiding danger. During the 8-day, annual pilgrimages from Dajia to Beigang, Mazu's idol is accompanied by figures of Qianliyan and Shunfeng'er played by masked men on stilts.[23]

In art

Qianliyan typically appears as a green-skinned demon shielding his eyes from the sun's glare.[24] This was not his original position: The Southern Song statue mentioned above and another in the Nanhai Longwang Temple _Nánhǎi Lóngwáng Miào_) in eastern Guangzhou in Guangdong give him three eyes but do not have either of his hands raised to his brow. He apparently picked up the pose from the earlier Zhaobao Qilang as that god's followers came to worship Mazu. Qianliyan also occasionally appears with three heads and six arms.[25] He usually appears to the right of his companion Shunfeng'er. He sometimes appears as the red demon, in which case he usually has two horns and yellow sapphire eyes.
