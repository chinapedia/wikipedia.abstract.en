Biography

He was the younger son of , a general of the Imperial Russian Army then of the Polish Army.[1] In 1927 Borys graduated in Bydgoszcz. He finished the Polish Naval Academy in 1930. He served on the torpedo boat ORP Podhalanin then on the submarines ORP Żbik, ORP Ryś and finally . He completed a course of naval artillery and the submarine navigation course.[2]

At the outbreak of war he was the executive officer on the ORP _Wilk_.[3] After unsuccessful patrols in the Baltic Sea, _Wilk_ passed the Danish straits (Øresund) on 14/15 September and arrived at Scotland. During the long months the crew has nothing to be proud of. Moral was low.[4] On 13 April 1940 he became the commanding officer of _Wilk_. On 20 June 1940 at 0.25 am, the ORP _Wilk_ rammed an unidentified object at position . It is probable that it was a German u-boat U-102 or U-122 (both disappeared in June or July). Some suggested, that it might have been an Allied Dutch submarine O13, also lost at sea around that time. According to newest analysis of Wilk's damages the object was most likely a buoy.[5] H.R. Bachmann and Jerzy Pertek noted that in the _Wilk_'s ship's logbook there is no mention of ramming an u-boat.[6]

At the same time, when it became clear that ORP Orzeł was definitely lost, the Royal Navy decided to lease an U-class submarine to Polish Navy. The vessel was named ORP Sokół. On 19 January 1941 Karnicki became its commander.[7] He patrolled the Bay of Biscay off the French port of Brest. Then he was moved to Malta and participated in the attack of Pylos after which the general Władysław Sikorski decorated him with the Virtuti Militari Cross (he took it off his own breast).[8]

_ORP Sokół_ and the other Polish submarine operating in the Mediterranean gained the name of _Terrible Twins_ because of their achievements. After the war ended Karnicki remained in exile in England where he died on 15 February 1985. The urn with his ashes was brought home by his wife and daughters. He has been buried in the Polish Naval Cemetery in Gdynia.[9]
