was the 28th Emperor of Japan,[1] according to the traditional order of succession.[2]

No firm dates can be assigned to this Emperor's life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 536–539.[3]


Legendary narrative

Keitai is considered to have ruled the country during the early-6th century, but there is a paucity of information about him. There is insufficient material available for further verification and study.

When Emperor Ankan died, he had no offspring; and succession passed to his youngest brother , who will come to be known as Emperor Senka. Emperor Senka was elderly at the time of his enthronement; and his reign is said to have endured for only three years.

Senka's contemporary title would not have been _tennō_, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning "the great king who rules all under heaven". Alternatively, Senka might have been referred to as or the "Great King of Yamato".

During this reign, Soga no Iname[4] is believed to have been the first verifiable _Omi_ (also _Ōomi_, "Great Minister").

The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (_misasagi_) at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Senka's mausoleum.[5] It is formally named _Musa no Tsukisaka no e no misasagi_;[6] however, the actual sites of the graves of the early Emperors remain problematic, according to some historians and archaeologists.
