_VERTICORDIA_ SECT. _CATOCALYPTA_ is one of eleven sections in the subgenus _Verticordia_. It includes seven species of plants in the genus _Verticordia_. Plants in this section are small, bushy shrubs which grow to a height of up to , have thick, fleshy, leaves which are triangular in cross-section. The flowers are arranged in open, corymb-like heads of relatively large flowers. Importantly, their sepals have down-turned, tufts of hair which surround the floral cup.[1]

In 1843, Johannes Conrad Schauer described _Verticordia_ subg. _Catocalypta_ and published the description in _Monographia Myrtacearum Xerocarpicarum_.[2][3] In 1856, Carl Meissner relegated the subgenus to a section.[4] Schauer did not provide an etymology for _Catocalypta_ but in Ancient Greek, _kato_ means "down below"[5] and _kalyptos_ means "covered",[6] probably referring to the tufts of hair covering the floral cup.[7]

When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991 he retained Meissner's description.[8][9]

The type species for this section is _Verticordia insignis_ and the other six species are _V. roei_, _V. inclusa_, _V. apecta_, _V. habrantha_, _V. lehmannii_ and _V. pritzelii_.[10]
