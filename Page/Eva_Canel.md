AGAR EVA INFANZÓN CANEL (January 30, 1857; Coaña, Asturias, Spain - May 2, 1932; Havana, Cuba), best known by her pseudonym Eva Canel, was a writer and journalist, originally from Spain who settled in Cuba.


Biography

Daughter of Doctor Pedro Infanzón and Epifanía Canel y Uría, Eva Agar was born on January 30, 1857 in Coaña, Asturias, Spain. When she was three years old her father died in a shipwreck caused by pirates and she moved to Madrid with her mother. When she was fifteen, she began to work as an actress in the theater, where she met Eloy Perillan y Buxo, the director of the satirical magazine _La Broma_, whom she married that same year. In 1874, the censors exiled her husband for publishing a pamphlet and he left to Bolivia, leaving her as director of the magazine. A year later, Eva traveled to South America to reunite with her husband and collaborate on _El Ferrocarril_, the magazine that he directed in _La Paz_. In January 1875⁴, the couple moved to Buenos Aires and founded _El Petróleo_, where she began to dedicate herself to journalism full-time. In 1876, they decided to move again, this time to Lima, Peru, where they founded _Las Noticias_ and collaborated with various newspapers such as _El Comercio_ and _El Perú Ilustrado_. It was then that the couple's only child was born, whom they baptized with the same name as his father.

Due to the War of the Pacific between Peru and Chile, Eva and her family returned to Spain once again, settling in Barcelona. Nonetheless, Perillán ended up moving to Cuba, where he died on March 1, 1889, and Eva moved to the island a short time later. There, she tried to find work in two Cuban newspapers, _Diario de la Marina_ and _Unión Constitucional_, but their respective directors refused to hire her. Because of this, in 1891 she founded her own weekly, named _La Cotorra,_ which was characterized by political satire. After spending eight years in Cuba and the Cuban war of Independence ended, Eva returned to Spain, moving back to Madrid. Nonetheless, in 1899, she returned to Buenos Aires, where she began her literary peak, writing three novels, giving a number of conferences and collaborating with various newspapers⁵. Additionally, she became the owner of a printing press and founded the magazines _Kosmos_, in 1904 and _Vida Española_, in 1907³.

On July 15, 1905, she gave a lecture at the gala in the Teatro Español, during the festivities for the inauguration of the Hospital of Charity. Jaime Serralta presented the prestigious writer who spoke on "Charity" and was given a standing ovation.

In 1914, Eva began a trip through Latin America, but fell ill upon arriving in Panama, and although she initially decided to go to a clinic in the United States, she ended up returning to Cuba, where she received assistance from her friend Antonio Díaz Blanco. There she continued her journalism and literary work until 1924 when her health deteriorated and she began to have nervous breakdowns and memory loss. Finally, on May 2, 1932, she died and was buried in her hometown.
