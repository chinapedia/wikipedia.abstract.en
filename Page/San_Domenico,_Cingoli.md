History

13275-madonna-of-the-rosary-lorenzo-lotto.jpg The convent of the Dominican order is documented since the 13th century; its buildings have undergone many reconstructions. The church has a single nave with a semicircular apse. In the 16th century, seven chapels, patronized by local aristocracy were added, as well as the bell tower.

In 1727, the former church was razed, and a new Baroque style building was erected by the architects Arcangelo Vici, and his son Andrea. The nave has an oval layout with niches at the four corners. The main altar shelters the _Madonna del Rosario_ painted by Lorenzo Lotto, and commissioned in 1539 by the local Confraternity of Rosary.[1]
