ROBERT JAMES RITCHIE (born January 17, 1971), known professionally as KID ROCK, is an American singer-songwriter, rapper, musician, record producer, and actor. In a career spanning over 20 years, Rock's musical style has alternated between rock, hip hop, and country. A self-taught multi-instrumentalist who can play every instrument in his backing band, Twisted Brown Trucker, he has overseen his own production on nine of his eleven studio albums.

Kid Rock started his professional music career as a self-taught rapper and DJ, releasing his debut album _Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast_ in 1990 on the major record label Jive; his subsequent independent releases _The Polyfuze Method_ and _Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp_ saw him developing a more distinctive style which was fully realized on his 1998 album _Devil Without a Cause_; this and his subsequent album _Cocky_ were noted for blending elements of hip hop, country, rock and heavy metal. Starting with his 2010 album _Born Free_, the country music style has dominated his musical direction, and since 2007's _Rock n Roll Jesus_ until 2017's _Sweet Southern Sugar_, he has not recorded any rap-influenced tracks.


Early life

He was born as Robert James Ritchie on January 17, 1971 in Romeo, Michigan, to father William Ritchie, owner of multiple car dealerships, and mother Susan Ritchie.[1][2][3] Ritchie's father owned a six-acre estate where Ritchie grew up,[4][5] regularly helping his family pick apples and caring for their horses.[6]

In the 1980s, Ritchie became interested in hip hop, began to breakdance and taught himself how to rap and DJ, while performing in talent shows in and around Detroit.[7][8] A self-taught musician, Ritchie is reported to play every instrument in his backing band, according to CBS.[9]


Career

Early career, signing with Jive Records and _Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast_ (1988–1990)

Kid Rock began his professional music career as a member of the hip hop music group The Beast Crew in the late 1980s.[10] During this time, he met rapper D-Nice. That relationship would eventually lead him becoming the opening act at local shows for Boogie Down Productions.[11]

During this time, Kid Rock began a professional association with producer Mike E. Clark, who, after some initial skepticism with the idea of a "white" rapper, found himself impressed with Kid Rock's energetic and well-received performance where the artist, using his own turntables and equipment, actually prepared his own beats to demonstrate his skills for Clark.[12]

In 1988, Clark produced a series of demos with the talented musician and that eventually led to offers from six major record labels, including Atlantic and CBS Records.[13][14]

In 1989, Kid Rock became a shareholder in an independent record label that was formed by Alvin Williams and Earl Blunt of EB-Bran Productions, called "Top Dog" Records. Later, that investment would become a 25% ownership stake.[15]

With the help of D-Nice, Kid Rock signed with Jive Records at the age of 17, releasing his debut studio album, _Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast_ in 1990.[16][17][18] According to Kid Rock, the contract with Jive resulted in animosity from fellow rapper Vanilla Ice, who Kid Rock claimed felt that he should have been signed with Jive instead of Kid Rock.[19]

The album made Kid Rock one of the two biggest rap stars in Detroit in 1990, along with local independent rapper Esham.[20][21] To promote the album, Kid Rock toured nationally with Ice Cube, D-Nice, Yo-Yos and Too Short; Detroit artist Champtown served as Kid Rock's DJ on this tour.[22][23] During instore promotions for the album, Kid Rock met and developed a friendship with local rapper Eminem, who frequently challenged Kid Rock to rap battles.[24]

Ultimately, unfavorable comparisons to Vanilla Ice led to Jive dropping Kid Rock, according to Mike E. Clark.[25]

Signing with Continuum Records and _The Polyfuze Method_ (1992–1995)

In 1992, Kid Rock signed with local independent record label Continuum.[26] Around this time, Kid Rock met local hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse through Mike E. Clark, who was producing the duo.[27] While ICP member Violent J disliked Kid Rock's music, he wanted the rapper to appear on ICP's debut album, _Carnival of Carnage_, believing the appearance would gain ICP notice, since Kid Rock was a nationally successful artist.[28] Noting that local rapper Esham was paid $500 to appear on ICP's album, Violent J claims that Kid Rock demanded $600 to record his guest appearance, alleging that Esham and Kid Rock had a feud over who was the bigger rapper.[29] Kid Rock showed up to record the song "Is That You?" intoxicated, but re-recorded his vocals and record scratching the following day.[30]

In 1993, Kid Rock recorded his second studio album, _The Polyfuze Method_, with producer Mike E. Clark, who worked with Kid Rock to help give the album more of a rock-oriented sound than his debut.[31]

Kid Rock also began releasing his "Bootleg" cassette series to keep local interest in his music.[32]

Later in the year, Kid Rock recorded the EP _Fire It Up_ at White Room Studios in downtown Detroit, run by brothers Michael and Andrew Nehra, who were forming the rock-soul band Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise.[33] The EP featured the heavy rock song "I Am the Bullgod" and a cover of Hank Williams Jr.'s country song "A Country Boy Can Survive".[34]

By 1994, Kid Rock's live performances had mostly been backed by DJs Blackman and Uncle Kracker, but Kid Rock soon began to utilize more and more live instrumentation into his performances, and formed the rock band Twisted Brown Trucker.[35][36]

After breaking up with his girlfriend, Kid Rock moved engineer Bob Ebeling into his apartment.[37] During a recording session with Mike E. Clark, the producer discovered that Kid Rock could sing when he recorded a reworked cover of Billy Joel's "It's Still Rock and Roll to Me", entitled "It's Still East Detroit to Me", which Clark claims led him to encourage Kid Rock to sing more.[38]

During this time, Kid Rock developed animosity towards other Detroit artists, including Insane Clown Posse; according to Mike E. Clark, who worked with both artists, Kid Rock was frustrated with ICP's local success, as Kid Rock disliked ICP's music, and wanted to become more successful than ICP.[39]

Through extensive promoting, including distributing tapes on consignment to local stores and giving away free samplers of his music, Kid Rock developed a following among an audience which DJ Uncle Kracker described as "white kids who dropped acid and liked listening to gangsta rap"; this following included local rapper Joe C, who had been attending Kid Rock concerts as a fan, but upon meeting Kid Rock, was invited to perform on stage as Kid Rock's hype man.[40]

_Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp_ and local breakthrough (1996)

Kid Rock's stage presence became honed with the addition of a light show, pyrotechnics, dancers and a light-up backdrop bearing the name "Kid Rock", and 1996 saw the release of his most rock-oriented album to date, _Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp_; the album's title came from Bob Eberling, who told a sleepless, alcoholic, drug-using Kid Rock, "Dude, you are the early-morning, stoned pimp."[41] According to Kid Rock, who distributed the album himself, _Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp_ sold 14,000 copies.[42]

Kid Rock developed his stage persona, performing dressed in 1970s pimp clothing with a real, possibly loaded, gun down the front of his pants.[43]

Though Kid Rock became known for frequent partying, and using drugs and alcohol, he was predominately focused on increasing his success and fame, placing himself as a businessman first; the result of this drive led to increased success locally.[44]

Signing with Atlantic Records, _Devil Without a Cause_ and national success (1997–2000)

Kid Rock's attorney, Tommy Valentino, increased his stature by helping him get articles written about Kid Rock and Twisted Brown Trucker in major publications, including the Beastie Boys' _Grand Royal_ magazine, but though his management tried to interest local record labels in his music, they told his management team that they were not interested in signing a white rapper, to which Valentino told them, "He's not a white rapper. He's a rock star and everything in between."[45]

In 1997, Jason Flom, head of Lava Records, attended one of Kid Rock's performances, and met with Kid Rock, who later gave him a demo containing the songs "Somebody's Gotta Feel This" and "I Got One for Ya", which led to Kid Rock signing with Atlantic Records.[46][47] As part of his recording deal, Kid Rock received $150,000 from the label.[48]

By this time, Kid Rock had fully developed his stage persona and musical style and wanted to make a "redneck, shit-kicking rock 'n' roll rap" album, resulting in his fourth studio album, _Devil Without a Cause_, recorded at the White Room in Detroit and mixed at the Mix Room in Los Angeles.[49]

Through extensive promoting, including appearances on MTV (including a performance alongside Aerosmith and Run-DMC) and performing at Woodstock 1999, _Devil Without a Cause_ sold 14 million copies, the album's success spurred by Kid Rock's breakthrough hit single "Bawitdaba".[50][51][52]

In 2000, Kid Rock was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist, despite having been active in the music industry for over 10 years.[53] Kid Rock's success, however, was marked by tragedy, with the death of friend and collaborator Joe C.[54][55]

In May 2000, Kid Rock released the compilation album " The History Of Rock", behind the single "American Bad Ass". The song sampled Metallica's 1991 song "Sad But True",peaking at No 20 on the mainstream rock chart. Kid Rock would join Metallica on their 2000 Summer Sanitiurm Tour along with Korn and System Of A Down. Kid Rock and Jonathan Davis filled in on vocals for an injured James Hetfield in Atlanta on July 7, 2000. Kid Rock performed American Bad Ass along with the Metallica classics Sad But True, Nothing Else Matters, Fuel and Enter Sandman along with covers of Turn The Page and Fortunate Son. The History Of Rock was certified double platinum and Kid Rock embarked on 2000's History Of Rock and 2001's American Bad Ass Tour's. American Bad Ass was nominated for the 2001 Grammy's Best Hard Rock Performance,losing out to Rage Against The Machine's "Guerilla Radio". His song with Robert Bradley " Higher" was featured in a tv spot for Gatorade.

Politics and views

Regarding political issues, Ritchie is a Republican,[213] although he has routinely proclaimed himself as libertarian philosophically,[214][215][216] stating he has socially liberal views on abortion and gay marriage, but fiscally conservative views on economics.[217] Ritchie met President Donald Trump in the White House.[218] Ritchie has advocated legalizing and taxing marijuana, cocaine and heroin.[219] Ritchie has also stated, "I don't think crazy people should have guns."[220] Ritchie was a vocal supporter of American military involvement in the Iraq War.[221] Ritchie has met Presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump while in office.[222][223][224] Regarding his political views, Ritchie said, "I have friends everywhere. Democrat, Republican, this that and the other. [...] We're all human beings first, Americans second, let's find some common ground and get along," while also stating in the same interview that he wanted "to bodyslam some Democrats."[225]

Ritchie supported Bill Clinton and George W. Bush during their presidencies.[226][227] In 2008, Ritchie supported newly elected President Barack Obama, saying that the president's election was "a great thing for black people."[228] In 2012, Ritchie campaigned for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney; the candidate used Ritchie's song "Born Free" as his campaign theme.[229][230][231][232][233][234] In 2015, Ritchie publicly endorsed Ben Carson for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 election.[235] In February 2016, he voiced approval for Donald Trump's campaign for the same office.[236] In September, Kid Rock was criticized for allegedly saying "fuck Colin Kaepernick" during a live performance of his song "Born Free".[237] In December, Kid Rock sparked controversy for selling vulgar T-shirts supporting Trump at concerts, including one showing a map of the United States which labelled the states which had voted against Trump as "Dumbfuckistan".[238]

On July 12, 2017, Ritchie shared a photo of a "Kid Rock for US Senate" yard sign on Twitter. He also launched a website at kidrockforsenate.com, which sold merchandise bearing that inscription.[239] Several weeks later, he wrote a post on his blog stating that he was still "exploring my candidacy", and that, whether or not he ran, he wanted to register people to vote, because "although people are unhappy with the government, too few are even registered to vote or do anything about it." He added that he wanted "to help working class people in Michigan and America all while still calling out these jackass lawyers who call themselves politicians."[240] His statements sparked media speculation that he would try to run on the Republican ticket against sitting Michigan senator Debbie Stabenow, as well as enthusiasm from some prominent Republicans, including former New York Governor George Pataki, who wrote on Twitter, "Kid Rock is exactly the kind of candidate the GOP needs right now."[241] In an October 2017 interview with Howard Stern, Ritchie put an end to the speculation, saying that he had never intended to run for Senate, adding rhetorically, "Who couldn't figure that out?".[242] He later clarified that the campaign was a joke that he had started after a Michigan state legislator encouraged him to run for Senate. He expressed surprise at the interest his potential candidacy had received, but also disappointment that some opposed to his candidacy had brought up his previous use of the Confederate flag to label him a racist.[243] He donated the $122,000 he had raised by selling "Kid Rock for U.S. Senate" merchandise to a voter registration group.[244]
