REGIMENT VRYSTAAT was an armoured regiment of the South African Army. As a reserve unit, it had a status roughly equivalent to that of a British Army Reserve or United States Army National Guard unit. Formed from 2 Regiment President Steyn which had been formed in 1975, when 1 Regiment President Steyn was converted to tanks and 2 Regiment President Steyn formed with armored cars. It was part of the South African Army Armour Formation.


History

Origin

Originally designated 2 Regiment President Steyn on 1 August 1975, Regiment Vrystaat was only formed the following year by the transfer of excess personnel from Regiment President Steyn.[1] At the same time a decision was taken to redesignate the unit.

Border War

The regiment conducted its first border operations in 1976. The regiment was at that stage one of very few conventional armoured car regiments in South Africa and acted as backup reserve for South African forces leaving Angola in that period.

Regiment Vrystaat conducted further border duty in 1977 and 1978.[2]

The regiment supported Operations Hooper and Packer with 20 Ratel Drivers in 1988.

Affiliations

Regiment Vrystaat was assigned to 73 Motorised Brigade of 7 Division and then to 9 Division by 1991.

Reamalgamation

By 2000, the two regiments re-amalgamated and became a single regiment once again.
