HENRY SCROPE, 6TH BARON SCROPE OF BOLTON (_c_. 1468â€“1506) was the only son and heir of John Scrope, 5th Baron Scrope of Bolton.[1] He inherited his father's lands and title at the age of about thirty, but, unlike his father, was never summoned to parliament in that right. He had married, around 1480,[2] Elizabeth Percy, a daughter of Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, and in 1498 Scrope and his wife were admitted to the City of York's Guild of Corpus Christi.[3]

Dead by 1506, Scrope was buried in Wensley, North Yorkshire; his wife, who was interred alongside him on her death, was still alive in May 1512. Their son was Henry Scrope, who inherited on his father's death.[4]
