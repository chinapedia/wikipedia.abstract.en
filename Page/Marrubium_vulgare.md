_MARRUBIUM VULGARE_ (WHITE HOREHOUND or COMMON HOREHOUND) is a flowering plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae), native to Europe, northern Africa, and southwestern and central Asia. It is also widely naturalized in many places, including most of North and South America.

It is a grey-leaved herbaceous perennial plant, and grows to tall. The leaves are long with a densely crinkled surface, and are covered in downy hairs. The flowers are white, borne in clusters on the upper part of the main stem.


Etymology

The Oxford English Dictionary derives the word from two Old English forms: "hoar" ("white," "light-colored," as in "hoarfrost") and "hune" a word of unknown origin designating a class of herbs or plants. The second element was altered by folk etymology.


Medicinal usage

Historical

De_medicina_V00117_00000006.tif edition of 1528]] Horehound has been mentioned in conjunction with medicinal use dating at least back to the 1st century BC, where it appeared as a remedy for respiratory ailments in the treatise _De Medicina_ by Roman encyclopaedist Aulus Cornelius Celsus.[1] The Roman agricultural writer Columella lists it as a remedy for expelling worms in farm animals in his important first-century work _On Agriculture_.[2] Since then, horehound has appeared for similar purposes in numerous herbals over the centuries, such as _The Herball, or, Generall historie of plantes_ by John Gerard, and _Every Man His Own Doctor: or, The Poor Planter’s Physician_ by Dr. John Tennent.[3]

Modern

_M.vulgare_ has been promoted widely on the internet for its supposed therapeutic puproses, and there has been preliminary research into its medicinal properties.[4] Nevertheless there is no good evidence that it has any value as a medicine.[5] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not endorse the plant for use as medicine, but has declared it to be a generally safe food additive.[6]


Horehound candy

Horehound_candy_drops.jpg Horehound drops are bittersweet hard candies made with sugar and an extract of _M.vulgare_. They are dark-colored, dissolve in the mouth, and have a flavor that has been compared to menthol and root beer. Like other products derived from _M.vulgare_, they are sometimes used as an unproven folk treatment for coughs and other ailments.[7][8]


Drinks

_M.vulgare_ is used to make beverages such as horehound beer, horehound tea (similar to the Maghrebi mint tea), and the rock and rye cocktail.[9]


As an invasive weed

Horehound was introduced to southern Australia in the 19th century as a medicinal herb. It became a weed of native grasslands and pastures where it was introduced with settlers’ livestock, and was first declared under noxious weeds legislation. It now appears to have reached its full potential distribution.

In New Zealand efforts are being made to control its spread with biocontrol measures using the horehound clearwing moth _Chamaesphecia mysiniformis_ and the horehound plume moth _Wheeleria spilodactylus_ that could eat their way through many plants.[10]

It occupies disturbed or overgrazed ground, and is favoured by grazing because it is highly unpalatable to livestock. It may persist in native vegetation that has been grazed.


As biocontrol

_Marrubium vulgare_ is also used as a natural grasshopper repellent in agriculture.


In astrology

According to John Gower in Book 7 of the _Confessio Amantis_, this plant was the herb of the fourth star of Nectanebus' astrology, Capella. Gower uses the older name, Alhaiot (VII:1338).
