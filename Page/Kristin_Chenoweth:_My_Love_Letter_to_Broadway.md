_KRISTIN CHENOWETH: MY LOVE LETTER TO BROADWAY_ is a 2016 musical revue / concert, written for and starring American singer and actress Kristin Chenoweth. The show was directed by Richard Jay-Alexander, with musical direction by Mary Mitchell Campbell, and produced by James L. Nederlander. The show was a limited engagement of 12 performances at Broadway's Lunt-Fontanne Theatre from November 2 through 13, 2016.[1][2]


Production

Chenoweth describes the concert as, "an intimate evening of romance, glamour and laughter."[3] The production is a limited engagement from November 2 to November 13, 2016.[4] It features a selection of songs performed by Chenoweth during her career, songs from her latest Great American Songbook-themed album _The Art of Elegance_, favorite Broadway standards, and others. "Chenoweth claims that no two shows in this 12-performance engagement will be alike", with the show featuring guest appearances by different youth choirs and other special guests.[5] The show is directed by Richard Jay-Alexander, who has directed some of Chenoweth's concerts and tours since 2012. Chenoweth's friend Mary Mitchell Campbell serves as musical director, and costumes are designed by Christian Siriano.[6][7]

Reception

Charles Isherwood of _The New York Times_ reviewed the show, writing:

  Chenoweth's appeal is in her perky wholesomeness and golly-gee enthusiasm ... which never feel manufactured. She has lost none of the girlish glow she possessed when she first rose to Broadway stardom. ... Nor does her singing ever feel mannered, although her bright lyric soprano is a superbly trained instrument. ... [H]er voice bloomed and soared almost effortlessly, in a wide range of repertoire, much but not all drawn from Broadway shows. ... [I]n a duet with a surprise guest, the opera star Renée Fleming, on "Over the Rainbow"... Fleming cast an amused eye at Ms. Chenoweth's ... magenta sequined leotard ... and admired her courage for wearing "hot pants."... Chenoweth also brought a reflective quality to [several songs]. ... The band, though numbering just five, sounded plenty plush. ... Chenoweth's lively, natural humor was on ample display. ... Whether singing or delivering her often self-deprecating patter, Ms. Chenoweth always radiates a pleasure in performing that carries across the proverbial footlights ... she's like a singing ray of sunshine.[34]
