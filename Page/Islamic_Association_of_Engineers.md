The ISLAMIC ASSOCIATION OF ENGINEERS () is a civic[1] and professional association in Iran founded in 1957.[2]

The organization is a platform for Islamic modernist activists and a forum for debating key issues among them. It holds regular meetings, lectures and research and turns them into books.[3]

Mehdi Bazargan and Ezzatollah Sahabi were among its founders.[4] Alongside Islamic Association of Students, the organization was active against outreach of Marxist ideology before Iranian Revolution[5] and was one of the professional bodies that served as a platform for religious activism, playing an important role in shaping the Islamic ideology of the revolution.[6] Ali Shariati was among occasional lecturers at the organization.[7] A number of leading members in the association held government portfolios during Interim Government of Iran.[8]
