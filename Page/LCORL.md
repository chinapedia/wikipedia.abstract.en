LIGAND DEPENDENT NUCLEAR RECEPTOR COREPRESSOR LIKE is a protein that in humans is encoded by the LCORL gene. [1]


Function

This gene encodes a transcription factor that appears to function in spermatogenesis. Polymorphisms in this gene are associated with measures of skeletal frame size and adult height. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
