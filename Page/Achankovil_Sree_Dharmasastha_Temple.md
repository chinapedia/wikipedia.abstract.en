ACHANKOVIL SASTHA TEMPLE is a Hindu temple and one of the 108 Sasthalayas, located in Pathanapuram tehsil of Kollam district in the Indian state of Kerala.

Ayyappa, the Mahavaidya

Lord Ayyappa / Aiyanar presides there in the form of _grihastha_ (householder) and the idol faces east. It is believed to installed by Lord Parasurama himself. The _pratishta_ of Lord Ayyappa here is quite unique from that of other Sastha shrines in Kerala. The idol is known as _Rudraksha sila_. He is depicted as a _grihasthashrami_ (one who leads a married life) along with his two consorts _Poorna_ and _Pushkala_.[3] The temple is famed for curing poisonous Snakebites and thus Ayyappa is often portraited as a _Mahavaidya_ (great physician). The right palm of the idol always keeps _Chandanam_ (Sandalwood) and _Theertham_ (sacred water) which is thought to have medicinal properties.
