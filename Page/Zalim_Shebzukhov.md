ZALIM BORISOVICH SHEBZUKHOV (; October 6, 1986 – August 17, 2016), was an Islamist from Kabardino-Balkaria, Russia and the fourth leader of the Caucasus Emirate militant group.[1]


Biography

Zalim was imprisoned for two years, after his arrest on December 7, 2007. On June 24, 2009 he was released.

Shortly after, Zalim joined the Caucasus Emirate.

On April 16, 2015 the National Anti-Terrorist Committee announced his death during a special operation in Nalchik, but soon after the committee informed the media that they were mistaken and it was another militant (Zaur Prokopchuk) that was killed during that action.

On November 10, 2015 Russian special forces announced the death of top federal fugitive Robert Zankishiev, who led the militants of Kabardino-Balkaria. On December 28, 2015 Zalim replaced Robert as head of Kabardino-Balkaria's terrorist organization and soon his organization became part of Caucasus Emirate.

For a long time his fate and his location were unknown until Saint Petersburg Police received information that Zalim might be hiding in the city. Zalim was killed by Russian security forces during a raid in his apartment in Saint-Petersburg, in August 2016.[2]
