ASLERD, the ASSOCIATION FOR SMART LEARNING ECOSYSTEM AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT, is an interdisciplinary, democratic, professional association open to institutions and individuals. It was founded in 2015 by academics, researchers and scholars, mostly from European Institutions, with the intention of developing the work previously carried out by the Observatory on Smart City Learning (2012-2015). ASLERD is registered as a not-for-profit organisation under Italian law.


Mission

The mission of the association is to support learning ecosystems to develop their people centered smartness towards becoming incubators of social innovation and engines of sustainable regional development.


Vision

ASLERD has adopted a more people centered vision of ecosystem "smartness"[1] that integrates the Maslow's hierarchy of needs[2] and the Flow (psychology) theory:[3] "Ecosystems are smart when individuals that take part in the local processes achieve a high level of skills and, at the same time, are also strongly motivated and engaged by continuous and adequate challenges, provided that their primary needs are reasonably satisfied."

Unlike the most popular models[4][5] used to benchmark the performance of smart cities, in the ASLERD vision the ecosystem "smartness" is not determined by infrastructural or process and product indicators but emerges, bottom-up, from the opinions of all categories of players involved in the learning processes, as it has been shown in the case studies concerning European Campuses[6][7] and Rome's Schools.[8] In such vision the development of people centred ecosystem "smartness" is considered as a continual process that needs to be supported by participatory approaches, co-design practices and technologies.


Timişoara Declaration

At the first ASLERD conference, held in Timişoara, (Romania) a document, _Better Learning for a Better World - Through People Centered Smart Learning Ecosystems_, also known as The Timişoara Declaration, was signed on 19 May 2016 by representatives of some of the most prominent European Associations involved in the development of the Technology Enhanced Learning and of the Distance Education, including EADTU,[9] EATEL, EDEN and IAFES[10] The Timişoara Declaration recognizes:

-   the leading role of design as driver of innovation at both organisational and didactic levels and of fostering the acquisition of a metadesign attitude by the students to prepare them as future citizens
-   the need for a fully interoperable tech-sphere and phygital[11] environments
-   the social relevance of alternating school and work (Alternance Schemes and Dual Education[12]) to restore learning ecosystems to their central place and to foster cooperation between students, teachers, families and territorial stakeholders
-   the need to unlock the full potential of open forms of education
-   the need for new models to benchmark the "smartness" of people centered learning ecosystems and territories
-   that technologies are smart not because they are capable of replacing human reasoning but, rather because they can help towards achieving a people centred smartness, through streamlining mundane organisational tasks, and enhancing the skills of all actors involved in learning processes


Activities

The association supports good quality research on Smart Learning Ecosystems and their relevance for social innovation and regional development by fostering networking and supporting projects at regional, national and international level (mainly European). The actions develop mainly in three ways:

-   Relations between Learning Ecosystems and Regional Development

    to include: understanding and models, social innovation & capital, capacity building, cultural issues, sustainability.

-   Competence Development

    to include: taxonomies of horizontal competences and interplay with digital competences,[13] educative visions, frameworks and methodologies to foster their acquisition, smart citizenship.

-   Supporting Technologies

    to foster: interoperability of data and services, safety and security, privacy, trust and mediation,[14][15][16]

ASLERD supports the development of Smart Learning Ecosystems by:

-   promoting the transfer of competences, methodologies and technologies from laboratories to learning ecosystems (schools and other formal and informal learning ecosystems)
-   offering free access to lectures, workshops, round tables
-   promoting high-quality open access multidisciplinary publications

European dimension

The European relevance of the ASLERD vision, and previously that of the Observatory on Smart City Learning, was first recognized in 2013 with the inclusion of _People Centered Smart Cities through Smart City Learning_ among the _Grand challenges of the XXI century in Technology Enhanced Learning_.[17] Recently ASLERD organized a session on _"Smart Learning Ecosystems for social innovation and territorial development_ at "ICT2015: Innovate, Connect, Transform" (Lisbon, Portugal) promoted by the European Commission - DG Connect. ASLERD is also committed to producing further analysis and collaboration among European Associations as outlined in the Timisoara declaration. SLERD 2017 has been supported by European Platform for Adult Learning (EPALE) - Erasmus+.

Conference and workshops

Members of the association, and previously of the Observatory on Smart City Learning, have been promoting ASLERD vision by organizing workshops and panels all over the world:

-   _Learning with and from Smart Cities_ - SCiLearn 2012 @ICWL2012 (Sinaia, Romania)

-   _Alternate Schemes: Models, Criticalities and Opportunities_ panel (organized in collaboration with CKBG and RUIAP) @EMEM 2017 Free University of Bozen-Bolzano

Since 2016 the association organizes its own annual conference: SLERD. The first edition of the series, SLERD 2016 was organized by the Politehnica University of Timișoara (Romania). SLERD 2017 took take place in Aveiro, Portugal, organized by the University of Aveiro and SLERD 2018 in Aalborg, Denmark organized by the University of Aalborg. SLERD 2019 will take place in Rome, Italy, May 22-24, co-organized by the University of Rome Tor Vergata, the ITD of the National Research Council (Italy) and the Quasar University of Rome.

Publications

ASLERD is supporting the publication of a high-quality peer-reviewed online open access multidisciplinary journal - IxD&A - indexed among others, by SCOPUS, ESCI (Emerging Sources Citation Index - Web of Science) and DOAJ. Members of the association, and previously of the Observatory on Smart City Learning, have promoted several special issues published by the IxD&A journal IxD&A Open Archive :

-   _Smart City Learning: Vision and Practical Implementations_ (N.16&17)
-   _People Centered Smart Territories_ (N. 20)

-   _Citizen, Territory and Technologies: Smart Learning Contexts and Practices_ (N. 35)

From 2017 onwards, the proceedings of the annual SLERD conference will be published by Springer Science in the series _Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies_.

-   2017: _Citizen, Territory and Technologies: Smart Learning Contexts and Practices_ [18]
-   2018: ''The Interplay of Data, Technology, Place and People for Smart Learning" [19]

Support to Schools

ASLERD is strongly involved in supporting secondary schools in improving their smartness. Since its foundation, the association has been successfully implementing actions aimed at disseminating design and evaluation literacies, fostering participatory evaluation, co-design and the increase of the social capital and experimenting with new approaches and strategies for Alternate Schemes.
