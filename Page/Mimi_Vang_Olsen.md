MIMI VANG OLSEN is a New York-born painter specializing in pet portraits in The Village since the early 1970s. Her work has brought her international recognition and celebrity clientele.[1]

It is estimated that Vang Olsen has painted close to 400 pet and family portraits over her decades-long career. “I approach it as if it were a formal portrait of a person or a piece of fruit,” Vang Olsen said. “It could be a still life. And by analyzing the pet’s personality, dog or cat, you can figure out how to do a beautiful portrait.”[2]

Vang Olsen's artwork can be seen in most card stores, with profits from calendars and cards going to The Humane Society of New York.[3]
