The OUR LADY OF CARMEL CATHEDRAL [1] ( ) also called CARTAGO CATHEDRAL[2] is a religious building belonging to the Catholic Church and is located in the city of Cartago in the homonymous canton of the Central American country of Costa Rica. Not to be confused with a church of the same name in the city of Cartago in Colombia.

The temple follows the Roman or Latin rite and is the seat of the diocese of Cartago in Costa Rica (D_ioecesis Carthaginensis in Costa Rica_) that was created in May 2005 by the then Pope Benedict XVI through the bull "Saepe contingit". This is one of the 2 most important churches of the town with the Basilica of Our Lady of the Angels (_Basílica de Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles_).[3]

Its history dates back to the parish church which was built between 1954 and 1960[4] being the local priest for that moment Enrique Bolaños. Currently it is under the pastoral responsibility of the Bishop José Francisco Ulloa Rojas.
