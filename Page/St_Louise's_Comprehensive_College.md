ST. LOUISE'S COMPREHENSIVE COLLEGE (Irish: Colaiste Naoimh Labhaoise) is a comprehensive high school located in the Upper Falls Road, Belfast.


History

ST. LOUISE'S was established in 1958. The religious order the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul was asked by the Catholic Church to take responsibility for this school. Shortly afterwards Sister Genevieve (Mary) O'Farrell was appointed Principal, a position she held for the next 25 years. Under her tenure the school grew in size from 1,000 to 2,400 students becoming the largest single-sex school in Europe.[1] It has begun to accept boys as well as girls.


Academics

ST. LOUISE'S offers instruction in a wide range of subjects.[2] It offers technical and vocational courses alongside a large suite of academic subjects.

In 2006 it was recognised as one of the first Specialist Colleges in Northern Ireland with particular expertise in Performing Arts and Media.

In 2013 it was ranked the top, non-selective school in Northern Ireland at 5A* - C and has been the highest performing Belfast school for several years in a row.

At ‘A’Level, its value added scores have placed it in the top ten percent of schools across Britain for several years in succession. 75.5% of its students who sat the A-level exams were awarded three A*-C grades.[3] It is one of the few schools in Northern Ireland which has City and Guilds affiliation.
