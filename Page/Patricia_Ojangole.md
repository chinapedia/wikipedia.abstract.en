Controversy

On 30 November 2012, Ojangole was appointed as Chief Executive Officer at UDB. On 10 February 2014 a Magistrate in the Anti-Corruption Court ordered the arrest of Patricia Ojangole on two counts:[5] (1) Alleged conflict of interest by her participation in the process that culminated in her selection as CEO and (2) Alleged victimization of a whistleblower. For several months, the case wound through Uganda's legal system.[6]


Exonerated

On 30 June 2014, Judge Lawrence Gidudu of the Anti Corruption Court acquitted and discharged Ojangole of all the charges against her due to lack of incriminating evidence. The judge noted that "the prosecution evidence was in support of Ms. Ojangole and therefore he had no option but to acquit".[7] She continues to serve as the CEO at UDB.[8]
