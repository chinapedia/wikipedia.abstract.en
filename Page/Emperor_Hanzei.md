The _Nihongi_ records that the country enjoyed peace during this Emperor's reign.[9]

The description of Hanzei in the _Kojiki_ is daunting as he is described as standing over nine feet tall and have enormous teeth all the same size. He is said to have ruled from the palace of Shibagaki at Tajihi in Kawachi (present-day Matsubara, Osaka); and he is said to have died peacefully in his palace.[10]
