He vowed to investigate corrupt politicians but no prosecution happened during his time in office.

During the last months in office, Llalla met his German counterpart, Harald Range, to assess the cooperation between German and Albania judicial authorities, focusing on the matter of terrorism and recruitment of foreign fighters.[3]

Corruption and money laundering scandal

In 2017 the US Ambassador to Tirana, Donald Lu, accused Llalla of being an "enemy of the Justice Reform" – the flagship reform program that Albania is implementing, aiming to clean up the notoriously corrupt justice system.

In February 2018 the US State Department announced that the then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had designated Adriatik Llalla and his family as corrupt foreign officials, thereby banning them from entering the country.[4][5]

Later in April, Prosecution accused him of refusing to declare his assets, money laundering, and other financial crimes. The court seized "moveable and real estate assets" worth 98.7 million leks ($915,000). The property includes an apartment in the northwestern seaside city of Durrës and more than of land.[6]
