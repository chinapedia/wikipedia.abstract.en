CANNABIS IN BENIN is illegal. The country is not a major drug producer or consumer, but increasingly serves as a transshipment point for drugs produced elsewhere. Cannabis is the only drug produced locally in Benin, though mostly on a small scale.[1][2]


History

The _Encyclopedia of Drug Policy_ noted in 2011 that over the past two decades, sale of cannabis had increasingly fallen under the control of organized crime syndicates operating regionally, particularly from Nigeria.[3] Porto-Novo emerged as a particular transit point, given its proximity to Nigeria which allowed collaboration with Yoruba smugglers.[4]


Enforcement

In 2006, Benin seized 82 kilograms of cannabis.[5]
