_LOVERS UNDER THE RAIN_ is a 1986 Taiwanese television drama series based on Chiung Yao's 1964 romance novel _Fire and Rain_. Mainly set in 1960s Taipei, the story follows a young girl Lu Yi-ping as she plotted revenge against her father—formerly a warlord in Northeast China who had 9 wives before fleeing the Chinese Communist Revolution for Taiwan—and his entire household, including her kind half-sister Lu Ru-ping.

The second Chiung Yao adaptation starring Leanne Liu and Chin Han after the highly successful _How Many Red Sunsets_ (1985), this drama proved even a bigger hit, capturing over 42% of the Taiwanese audiences.[1]
