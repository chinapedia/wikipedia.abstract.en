BAYPORT-BLUE POINT UNION-FREE SCHOOL DISTRICT is a public school district that serves the hamlets of Bayport, New York and Blue Point, New York. It consists of Bayport-Blue Point High School, James Wilson Young Middle School, and three elementary schools, Academy Street Elementary, Blue Point Elementary, and Sylvan Avenue Elementary.[1]


History

The Bayport-Blue Point School District dates back to 1927, and originally consisted of two separate school districts: Bayport School District (Founded 1927) and Blue Point School District (Founded 1929), each containing one school: Bayport School District contained Bayport School (Now Bayport-Blue Point High School), and Blue Point School District contained Blue Point School (Now Blue Point Elementary Schools). Academy Street School was established in 1954 as a primary school within the Bayport School District, and Bayport School became Bayport High School. In 1959, a merger of the two districts was announced. It resulted in Bayport High School being expanded and renamed Bayport-Blue Point High School, and Academy Street and Blue Point both becoming elementary schools. The merger was completed in 1961, forming Bayport-Blue Point Union-Free School District. The district continued to expand, opening Sylvan Avenue Elementary School in 1965, and James Wilson Young Middle School in 1975.

2003 Bond Referendum

During the 2002-2003 school year, Bayport-Blue Point School District passed a $35.5 million bond referendum giving improvements to schools across the district. Construction began during the 2003-2004 school year, and was completed in time for the 2006-2007 school year. The improvements included a brand-new auditorium, a new front entrance, 10 brand-new classrooms, and renovation/expansion of the gymnasium at Bayport-Blue Point High School. Also included in the bond were a cafeteria and 6-classroom addition at Academy Street.
