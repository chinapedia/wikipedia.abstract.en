ITHACA BUS STATION, also referred to as ITHACA BUS TERMINAL, is an intercity bus station in Ithaca, the county seat and only city in Tompkins County, New York. The station, located west of North Fulton Street between West Seneca Street and West State Street, had been a train station of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad until 1942.[1] The station building accommodates waiting area with seats, ticketing and package express office, and restrooms.
The station closed in October 2018 due to construction, retirement of the station operators, and changing infrastructure in the area. Buses are now boarding downtown for the time being until long term plans are made.[2]
