_HYLAEUS FACILIS_ is a species of bee, also known by the common name EASY YELLOW-FACED BEE.[1] It is endemic to Hawaii and known from only two populations.[2] In September 2016, along with six other Hawaiian _Hylaeus_ species,[3] _H. facilis_ was listed for protection under the United States Endangered Species Act. This marked a first listing for any bee species in the US.[4]


Description

_Hylaeus facilis_ is of medium size with smoky wings. Males have a large lower facial oval yellow spot with a yellow stripe near the eyes whereas females are completely black.[5]


Distribution and habitat

_Hylaeus facilis_ is now known only, in two populations of unknown size, from a coastal habitat on Molokai and a lowland wet forest on Oahu. Threats to the species include habitat degradation by nonnative animals and plants, predation by nonnative insects, fires and climate change.[6]
