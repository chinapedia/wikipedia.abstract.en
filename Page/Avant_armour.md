Avant_armour_upper_section.JPG THE AVANT ARMOUR, in the R. L. Scott collection in Glasgow, is one of the oldest near-complete armours in the world. It is in almost perfect condition. It is named after the repeating inscription on the breastplate - _avant_, meaning "forward!". The armour was made in about 1440-45 for a member of the Matchs family of Churburg Castle.[1]

The Avant armour was made in Milan, one of medieval Europe's most famous armour-making cities. This armour is perfectly formed and beautiful to look at. Like all armours of this quality, the Avant armour is also covered in armourer's marks - 51 in total - the signatures of the skilled craftsmen who made it. The armour would have provided excellent protection.
