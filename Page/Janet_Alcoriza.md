JANET ALCORIZA (born JANET RIESENFELD and also known as RAQUEL ROJAS) was an American screenwriter and actress of Austrian and Scots-Irish descent who spent most of her career in Mexico.[1][2] She contributed to more than 50 films from 1945 to 1987, and early in her career was associated with Luis Buñuel.


Biography

Her father, Vienna-born composer Hugo Riesenfeld, emigrated to the United States in 1907, where he met and married Mabel Dunning.[3] The couple had Janet in 1918 in New York City.[4]

When she was a girl, she fell in love with acting when she observed performances at the theater her father operated.[5] She took lessons from her father's dancing teacher, and she later spent time in Mexico and Spain, which aided her in becoming fluent in Spanish.[6] She later wrote about her experiences in Spain (which was at war at the time) in an autobiographical book.[7]

Janet was married to Mexican screenwriter and director Luis Alcoriza.
