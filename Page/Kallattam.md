Release

The film had a theatrical release on 30 September 2016 and received mixed reviews. The critic from The New Indian Express wrote "what is appreciable is that the director has stayed focused on his plot", stating "there is no forced-in romantic angle nor is there a mundane comic track" and "another positive aspect of the film is its viewing time - Itâ€™s appreciable that the director has managed to limit his story-telling to just about 97 minutes", concluding that "_Kallaattam_ is at the most a stepping stone for a debutant maker".[6] The Deccan Chronicle wrote "_Kallattam_ is very touching and emotive in parts", "but the plot meanders along aimlessly and the characters are very disjointed" and "one is rarely given a chance to get into the film and live the scenes as and when they develop".[7]
