KUNLUN VOLCANIC GROUP, also known as ASHIKULE, is a volcanic field in northwestern Tibet. Eight other volcanic fields are also in the area. The field is within a basin that also contains three lakes.

Volcanism in the field has produced lavas and cones, with rocks having varying compositions dominated by trachyandesite. Volcanism in the field may be influenced by faults in the area.

The dates obtained from the field range from 5.0 ± 0.6 million years ago to 74,000 ± 4,000 years ago. An eruption of Ashi volcano was observed in 1951, making this one of China's youngest volcanoes.


Geological context

The Tibetan Plateau formed through the collision of India with Eurasia. -rich volcanic activity in the Tibetan Plateau has been occurring since 50 million years ago. After 8 million years ago, this volcanism occurred mainly in northwestern Tibet. It is not clear why volcanism occurs in the Tibetan plateau considering that the area is dominated by the collision between continents rather than subduction, which happens in other volcanically active areas. Southward subduction of the Asian Plate and the northward one of the Indian Plate have been found. Mélange from these subducting plates forms the source material of the magmas of the volcanic fields in northwestern Tibet, although isotope data suggest that the Ashikule magma may not derive from subduction. Magma generation in Ashikule could have been affected by garnet or garnet-containing crustal layers. More generally, the crust beneath northern and central Tibet is suspected to be partially molten between of depth.

Rocks younger than 350,000 years have been found in the Tengchong system in the southeast and the Ashikule plateau in the northwestern part of Tibet.[1] These are also the only volcanic systems with Holocene activity in Tibet. The volcanic areas of northwestern Tibet for the most part are situated at over altitude and are poorly accessible.

The Ashikule volcanic field is one among nine in northwestern Tibet, other volcanic fields are Dahongliutan, Heishibei, Kangxiwa, Keliya, Pulu, Qitaidaban, Quanshuigou and Tianshuihai. Some of these volcanic centres are occasionally grouped with Ashikule in the Yutian-Yumen volcanic zone.[2] A pronounced seismic velocity anomaly in southern Tarim may be associated with the volcanism at Ashikule,[3] and a seismically imaged gap between the Tarim block and the Indian Plate below the crust may be a pathway for mantle upwelling that feeds the Ashikule volcanoes.


Geography

The Ashikule volcanic field is located in the Kunlun Shan, south of Yutian County, Xinjiang.[4] It is one of the highest volcanic regions in the world. It occupies the southern parts of a large pull apart basin, the Ashikule Basin in the western Kunlun. This basin covers a surface area of at an altitude of , sloping southeastward. East-west stretching of the crust may play a role in volcanic activity there. The numerous strike slip faults in the area could be involved too, whereas subduction of the Tarim Basin beneath the Kunlun is unlikely. The Altyn Tagh fault crosses the field in east-northeast to south-southwest direction.


Geomorphology

There are 14 principal volcanoes in Ashikule, formed by lava, pumice and pyroclastics. Spatter cones and volcanoes of Quaternary age are in the Ashikule area, for a total amount of over 70 cones.[5] Over 20 volcanoes have been found in the eastern part of the field, they reach heights of several .[6] It features perfectly preserved cinder cones.[7] Silicic lava domes are also found. The Ashikule basin is covered by of lava from this field. Various kinds of rock coatings have developed on these lavas, some of biogenic origin.[8]

Xi Shan is the westernmost volcano with a diameter of and a height of With a summit height of and a height of above base, Dahei Shan volcano is the highest volcano at Ashikule and features a V-shaped crater. high Wuluke cone north of Wukule lake features a crater lake. Migong Shan is east of Wuluke volcano. Yueya Shan has a high secondary cone within its wide crater; Maoniu Shan volcano is located nearby and they are surrounded by even smaller centres. Heilong Shan is a long volcanic ridge on the terraces of the Akesu River and to the east of it is the horseshoe-shaped Mati Shan and the high Dong Shan.

The trachyandesitic Ashi volcano, also known as Ka-er-daxi or Vulkan,[9] (,) is south of Ashikule lake in a lava plateau, at an altitude of . The wide cone features an uneroded high cone with a deep crater breached to the south. Lava flows from Ashi extend both north and south and cover a surface area of , reaching as far as lake Ashikule.

There are three salt lakes in the area, Ashikule (also called Ashi or Aqqikkol), Shagesikule, and Wulukekule (also called Wuluke or Ulugkol).[10] Ashi is long and Urukele . deep Ashikule covers a surface area of and formed when a valley was dammed by lava.[11] Wulukekule and Ashikule are separated from each other by lava. Between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago Ashikule and Shagesikule were one lake.[12] Playas of the same name are found in the area and are a source of mineral dust. The basin is in the area of the upper Keriya River.[13]


Composition

The field is dominated by trachyandesite and trachydacite,[14] ranging from tephrite over trachyandesite to trachyte and rhyolite.[15] Ashi volcano has erupted trachyandesite. Phenocrysts in the rocks contain clinopyroxene, olivine, orthopyroxene and phlogopite. Xenoliths of gneiss are found in the rocks of Ashi volcano.

Ashikule and Tengchong have high ratios of to in their composition. isotope data indicate that in comparison with the volcanoes of the Tengchong area, Ashikule volcanoes formed by slower melting of rocks. The magmas of Ashikule probably did not form under the influence of water metasomatism. The ultimate source rocks may be mafic-ultramafic rocks. The magma of Ashi volcano formed by the mixing of trachyandesitic magma with a more silicic component.

The conditions in the magma chamber of Ashi volcano have been estimated. There are two populations of rocks, one formed at temperatures of at a depth of , the other at temperatures of at a depth of .


Climate

The Ashikule basin is one of the driest areas of Tibet.

Discrepancies between dates obtained by surface exposure dating and potassium-argon dating on some rocks have been interpreted as being due to lava flows being covered by snow and ice in the past. From this it has been inferred that the Ashikule field was covered by glaciers during the Last Glacial Maximum, when temperatures decreased by .[16]


Geochronology

Some ages are 5.0 ± 0.6 and 2.7 ± 1.8 million years ago and were obtained by argon-argon dating. Xi Shan volcano formed 2.8 million years ago. Mati Shan and a volcanic episode north of Ashikule occurred 1.63-1.21 million years ago. Most volcanoes formed 670,000 - 500,000 years ago, two other minor episodes occurred 440,000 - 280,000 and 200,000 - 120,000 years ago. Gaotaishan volcano is one million years and Binhushan volcano 370,000 years old. The youngest date was obtained by thermoluminescence dating, 74,000 ± 4,000 years ago.

The latest eruption was on 27 May 1951,[17] at Ashi volcano as was reported by the newspaper Xinjiang Daily. The report claimed that soldiers building a road heard roaring and saw a column of smoke, which continued for several days. A volcanic ash layer from this eruption has been found in the Changce Ice Cap.[18]

Another unconfirmed report claims an eruption took place in the 19th century.[19] Presently, the field is dormant. Fumarolic activity has been observed in the northern side of the crater of Ashi volcano. It is one of the few active volcanic regions in China.

The magnitude 7.2 2008 Yutian earthquake took place south of the volcanic field, at the intersection of two major faults, the Karakax fault and the Altyn-Tagh fault. Other earthquakes occurred in 2012 and 2014. Volcanic activity may also be related to the Longmu-Gozha fault system.[20]
