, a fan convention in Israel, October 2005]] TIMOTHY THOMAS "TIM" POWERS (born February 29, 1952)[1] is an American science fiction and fantasy author. Powers has won the World Fantasy Award twice for his critically acclaimed novels _Last Call_ and _Declare_. His 1987 novel _On Stranger Tides_ served as inspiration for the _Monkey Island_ franchise of video games and was optioned for adaptation into the fourth _Pirates of the Caribbean_ film.

Most of Powers' novels are "secret histories". He uses actual, documented historical events featuring famous people, but shows another view of them in which occult or supernatural factors heavily influence the motivations and actions of the characters.

Typically, Powers strictly adheres to established historical facts. He reads extensively on a given subject, and the plot develops as he notes inconsistencies, gaps and curious data; regarding his 2001 novel _Declare_, he stated,[2]


Life and career

Powers was born in Buffalo, New York but has lived in California since 1959.[3] He studied English Literature at Cal State Fullerton, and earned his B.A. in 1976.[4] It was there that he first met James Blaylock and K. W. Jeter, both of whom remained close friends and occasional collaborators; the trio have half-seriously referred to themselves as "steampunks"[5] in contrast to the prevailing cyberpunk genre of the 1980s. Powers and Blaylock invented the poet William Ashbless while they were at Cal State Fullerton.[6]

Another friend Powers first met during this period was noted science fiction writer Philip K. Dick;[7] the character named "David" in Dick's novel _VALIS_ is based on Powers. When _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_ was retitled _Blade Runner_ to tie-in with the movie based on the novel, Dick dedicated it to Tim and Serena Powers.

Powers' first major novel was _The Drawing of the Dark_ (1979),[8] but the novel that earned him wide praise was _The Anubis Gates_, which won the Philip K. Dick Award, and has since been published in many other languages.

Powers also teaches part-time in his role as Writer in Residence for the Orange County High School of the Arts and California School of the Arts in San Gabriel Valley in the Creative Writing Conservatory, as well as Chapman University, where Blaylock teaches. He also taught part-time at the University of Redlands.

Powers and his wife, Serena Batsford Powers, currently live in Muscoy, California. He has frequently served as a mentor author as part of the Clarion science fiction/fantasy writer's workshop.[9]
