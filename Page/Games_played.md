GAMES PLAYED (most often abbreviated as G or GP) is a statistic used in team sports to indicate the total number of games in which a player has participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective of whatever portion of the game is contested.


Baseball

In baseball, the statistic applies also to players who, prior to a game, are included on a starting lineup card or are announced as _ex ante_ substitutes, whether or not they play,[1] although, in Major League Baseball, the application of this statistic does not extend to consecutive games played streaks. A starting pitcher, then, may be credited with a game played even as he is not credited with a game started or an inning pitched.
