MAX LAMB (born 1980) is a British designer[1] who combines traditional - if not prehistoric - design methods with digital design. He is known for employing highly unusual approaches to using natural materials, including pouring pewter onto sand,[2] and volcanic rock. He is also known for his strenuous and lengthy methods of production through his many YouTube videos.

Lamb was born in Cornwall[3] in 1980 and became interested in design at a young age. He was raised by the countryside so nature was important to him. He attended Amersham & Wycombe College for art and design in 2000 where he received several awards. He also received a City and Guilds Photography Certificate in 2000. He later attended Northumbria University, receiving a degree in Three Dimensional Design. In 2006 he achieved his master's degree in design products from the Royal College of Art.[4] A year later he started teaching Industrial Design at Ecole Cantonale d'Art de Lausanne in Switzerland, and he has also taught at the Royal College of Art.


Works

Lamb works with a diverse range of materials including but not limited to stone, wood, metal, plastic, as well as "Marmoreal", a terrazzo-like composite material that he himself invented.[5][6] He is known for his innovative approach and use of natural materials within his designs. An example of this experimentation is his triangular pewter stool, which he created by digging the form of the stool into the sand and pouring liquid pewter into the sand form. He has also made a pewter stool that combines hexagonal shapes. Another example of natural elements used in his art work is his nano-crystalline copper dishware collection.

Lamb often uses traditional techniques to achieve innovative contemporary solutions. His _Urushi Series_ is a collection of seating, tables and cabinets finished with Urushi lacquer from Waijima, Japan. The structure of each piece is obtained by cleaving chestnut with green-woodworking techniques in order to preserve the natural appearance of the wood. Urushi lacquer is then applied following traditional Japanese methods.[7]

Lamb's respect for natural materials, specifically wood, is evident in the project 'My Grandfather's Tree by Max Lamb'. Shown for the first time at Somerset House (London, UK) in 2015, the project was a compilation of 131 logs installed and arranged in the same order the tree was meticulously cut. Originally the work formed a 187 years old Ash tree from Monckton Walk Farm (Yorkshire) . As the tree started getting rotten, the designer decided to give it a new history; this resulted in a collection of 'general purpose' logs that respect the tree's life by revealing its growth rings, knots, branches and crotches.[8]

The designer's extensive practice was epitomized in an exhibition entitled "Exercises in Seating" (2015) where he arranged in a circle 40 uniquely designed chairs that he made using various materials and techniques spanning the course of nearly ten years; the exhibition was held in Milan, Italy, during the city's renowned design week.[9][10][11]
