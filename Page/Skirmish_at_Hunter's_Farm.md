The SKIRMISH AT HUNTER'S FARM was a battle of the American Civil War fought between the Union Army and pro-Confederate Missouri State Guard at Hunter's Farm near Belmont in Mississippi County, Missouri on September 26, 1861.[1][2][3] A reconnaissance party of cavalry sent out by Brigadier General Ulysses S Grant succeeded in surprising a detachment of Brigadier General's Jeff Thompson's command.[4]

Captain Stewart, in command of a squadron of Union cavalry, left Norfolk, Missouri in the morning, consisting of a small detachment of his own company, Captain Langen's company, and Captain Pfaff's company. They engaged the cavalry of the Missouri State Guard at the Hunter farm, near the edge of the timber, surrounded and captured a portion of them. Captain Stewart returned at 5 o'clock p.m. with 4 prisoners, 4 horses and reported some 10 or 12 killed, several wounded; 1 horse lost.[5]
