_ARTWORKS_ is an album by saxophonist Art Pepper recorded in 1979 at the sessions that produced _So in Love_ but not released on the Galaxy label until 1984.[1][2][3]


Reception

The AllMusic review by Scott Yanow noted "The performances on this Galaxy LP are essentially outtakes and leftovers from Art Pepper's 1979 sessions for Artists House, but the quality is quite high. "Body and Soul" and "You Go to My Head" are particularly special, for they are unaccompanied alto solos, and on "Anthropology," Pepper has a rare outing on clarinet".[4]
