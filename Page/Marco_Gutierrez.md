MARCO GUTIERREZ is a Mexican-American right-wing political activist and the co-founder of Latinos for Trump, an online organization dedicated to promoting the candidacy of Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[1][2] In July 2016, Gutierrez said that this group had 20,000 members.[3] He gained significant media attention in September 2016 when he said on MSNBC that the spread of Latino culture in the United States, if it was not stopped, would lead to "taco trucks on every corner."[4] Subsequently, the _New York Daily News_ reported that he and his wife, Jennifer, had filed for personal bankruptcy fourteen times and that he had had his real estate license revoked.[5] He has also argued that Trump's plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border is both physical and symbolic, and has praised Trump's leadership abilities.[6]
