Since 2015 GRATWEIN-STRASSENGEL is a market town in the Graz-Umgebung District of Styria, Austria. The town took effect as part of the Styria municipal structural reform,[1] from the end of 2014 with the merging of the former municipalities Gratwein, Judendorf-Straßengel, Eisbach and Gschnaidt. The merger made the market town population to be the 6th-largest in Styria.[2]

A petition by the mayor of Eisbach, to the constitutional court, against the merger was not successful.[3] Likewise a petition from the town Gschnaidt was not successful.[4]

History

069_Gratwein,_gez._von_A.J._Wonsiedler_-_J.F.Kaiser_Lithografirte_Ansichten_der_Steiermark_1830.jpg The local communities as autonomous entities came into existence after the abolition of the landlords in 1850.

Judendorf Straßengel

Steiermark_Maria_Strassengel_2.jpg.]] Around 860, in one of the oldest documents of Austria, the churchhill of Straßengel is called "_ad Strazinolun_". Probably the name derives from the Slavic "_straza_", which could refer to a watchtower located here.

On June 11, 1147 Margrave Otakar III dedicated the monastery Rein to several towns Rotz, Straßengel and Judendorf. These areas were managed by monks from the Rein abbey.

Settlements with the label "Judendorf" are usually located along old trade routes crossing the Alps. In their neighborhood, the city and market foundations were established later. It is assumed that these Jewish villages are the settlements of Jewish merchants who were intensively involved in the merchandise trade in the early Middle Ages.

After the abolition of the landlords, Judendorf, Straßengel, Rötz, Hundsdorf and Kugelberg were included in the market town of Gratwein, established in 1849.

With the opening of the section Mürzzuschlag-Graz of the k.k. privileged Southern Railway on October 21, 1844, the Gratwein/Gratkorn Basin also joined the "industrial revolution". As a result, Jewish businesses settled in Judendorf, including a cement factory.

The Judendorf and Straßengel people, however, owed their economic boom to the fact that the upper class of Graz had seized this area already in the year 1850. Especially based on economic activity was the development of a hotel (1889), a cold-water sanatorium (1894), and the "Styrian Park Sanatorium Dr. Feiler" (1901). At the time, as one of the most famous spa resorts of the monarchy, Judendorf-Straßengel finally obtained the separation from Gratwein, and in 1909 constituted itself as an independent local community.

The upswing came to an abrupt end with the collapse of the monarchy and the associated loss of the economic backlands. The congregation would soon have sunk into insignificance, if the health insurance of the Austrian federal railway would not have taken over the former Feiler Park Sanatorium.

After the Second World War, Judendorf-Straßengel developed more and more into a residential community, and in 1981, 86% of the workforce worked in the home-community. After the insurance company of Austria railways in 1989 abolished parts of its special hospital. Through intensive efforts, the tradition of Judendorf-Straßengel as a health resort and as a place of rest and recreation also continued. Consequently, in the first special department of the Psychiatric Hospital "Park Residence", a retirement home, and on the site of the last disused part, a modern rehabilitation center was built with a focus on neurology, orthopedics, oncology and children's rehabilitation.[7]

In 2009 the main square was completely redesigned around the former community center and inaugurated on the occasion of the 100th anniversary.[8]

Eisbach

North of the village Rein was in the Neolithic Age (Neolithic) in Lasinja-Culture, a mining site for silex (siliceous rock as chert, quartz, etc.). From there, tools (hand axes, blades, scrapers, etc.) were won. Workpieces of this mining site were spread to a distance of away.[9]

Since the 12th century, the Stift Rein has been a characteristic feature of the community. In Eisbach and in its surroundings, there were a number of mining operations, as for mercury and lignite.[10]
