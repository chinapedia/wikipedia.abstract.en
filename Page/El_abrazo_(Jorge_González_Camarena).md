El_abrazo_(Jorge_González_Camarena).jpg _EL ABRAZO_ (in English _The Embrace_) is a work by Mexican artist Jorge González Camarena, painted in 1980. The author gave the painting to his son Jorge González Camarena Barre de Saint-Leu. In October 2013 the work was sold to Carlos Slim Foundation. It is part of the permanent collection of Museo Soumaya in Mexico City.


_La fusión de dos culturas_

The painting is an easel version of the mural _La fusión de dos culturas_ (In English, _The Fusion of Two Cultures_), previously entitled by the author: _La Conquista_ (_The Conquest_). The mural is preserved in the collection of the Museo Nacional de Historia, in México City.


Background

The painting was made in 1980, twenty years after the mural work. It is 2 m wide and 1.4 m tall. Although it was previously thought that it was an oil painting on canvas, tests revealed that the artist used acrylics.[1]

In comparison with the mural, on this version the artist suppressed the horse, leaving both the guerrero águila (Eagle Warrior) and the Spanish conquistador kneeling face to face, embracing and killing each other.[2]


Interpretation

The title is a metaphor for how the conquest was perceived: the artist shows two cultures embracing and merging, while the two traditions collide and destroy each other.
