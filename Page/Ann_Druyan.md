ANN DRUYAN ( ;[1] born June 13, 1949) is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning American writer, producer, and director specializing in the communication of science. She co-wrote the 1980 PBS documentary series _Cosmos_, hosted by Carl Sagan, whom she married in 1981. She is the creator, producer, and writer of the 2014 sequel, _Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey_ and its upcoming new season, _Cosmos: Possible Worlds_. She is credited with directing episodes of both series as well.

She was the Creative Director of NASA's Voyager Interstellar Message Project, the golden discs affixed to both the _Voyager 1_ and _Voyager 2_ spacecraft.[2] Druyan's role on the project was discussed on the July 8, 2018 60 Minutes segment "The Little Spacecraft That Could."[3] In the segment, Druyan explained her insistence Chuck Berry's "Johnny B. Goode" be included on the Golden Record, saying, "..._Johnny B. Goode_, rock and roll, was the music of motion, of moving, getting to someplace you've never been before, and the odds are against you, but you want to go. That was Voyager." The segment also discussed Sagan's suggestion, in 1990, that Voyager 1 turns its cameras back towards Earth to take a series of photographs showing the planets of our solar system. The shots, showing Earth from a distance of 3.7 billion miles as a small point of bluish light, became the basis for Sagan's famous "Pale Blue Dot" passage, first published in _Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space_. (1994)

Druyan and Sagan's working and resulting romantic relationship has been the subject of numerous treatments in popular culture, including the Radiolab episode "Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan's Ultimate Mix Tape"[4] and a segment of the Comedy Central program _Drunk History_'s episode, "Space."[5] In 2015, it was announced Warner Brothers was in development on a drama about Sagan and Druyan's relationship, to be produced by producer Lynda Obst and Druyan[6].

The asteroids 2709 (Sagan) and 4970 (Druyan) are in perpetual wedding ring orbit around the Sun[7].


Early life

Druyan was born in Queens, New York, the daughter of Pearl A. () and Harry Druyan, who co-owned a knitwear firm.[8][9][10] Druyan's early interest in math and science was, in her word, "derailed" when a junior high school teacher ridiculed a question she asked about the universality of pi. "I raised my hand and said, 'You mean this applies to every circle in the universe?', and the teacher told me not to ask stupid questions. And there I was having this religious experience, and she made me feel like such a fool. I was completely flummoxed from then on until after college." Druyan characterized her three years at New York University as "disastrous," and it wasn't until after she left school without graduating that she discovered the pre-Socratic philosophers and began her educating herself, thus leading to a renewed interest in science[11].


Career as an author

Druyan's first novel, _A Famous Broken Heart_, was published in 1977.

Druyan co-wrote six _New York Times_ best-sellers with Carl Sagan, including: _Comet_,[12] _Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors_,[13] and _The Demon-Haunted World_.[14][15] She is co-author, along with Carl Sagan, F. D. Drake, Timothy Ferris, Jon Lomberg and Linda Salzman Sagan, of _Murmurs Of Earth : The Voyager Interstellar Record_.[16] She also wrote the updated introduction to Sagan's book _The Cosmic Connection_, and the epilogue of _Billions and Billions_. She wrote the introduction to, and edited _The Varieties of Scientific Experience_, published from Sagan's 1985 Gifford lectures, .

In 2019, Druyan will publish _Cosmos: Possible Worlds_ (National Geographic Books), a companion volume to the television series of the same name.


Work in science

As creative director of NASA's Voyager Interstellar Message Project, Druyan worked with a team to design a complex message, including music and images, for possible alien civilizations. These golden phonograph records affixed to the _Voyager 1_ and _Voyager 2_ spacecraft are now beyond the outermost planets of the solar system and _Voyager 1_ has entered interstellar space. Both records have a projected shelf life of one billion years.[17][18]

Druyan is a fellow of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims for the Paranormal (CSICOP).[19]

Druyan served as program director of the first solar sail deep space mission, Cosmos 1, launched on a Russian ICBM in 2005.[20]

Druyan is involved in multiple Breakthrough Initiatives. With Frank Drake, Druyan is the co-chair of Breakthrough Message,[21] and she is also a member of Breakthrough Starshot.[22]

She is a member of the advisory board of The Carl Sagan Institute.[23]

The attraction is narrated by Tom Hanks.[25] Druyan and Soter also co-wrote _The Search for Life: Are We Alone_, narrated by Harrison Ford, which also debuted at the Hayden's Rose Center[26].

In 2000, Druyan co-founded Cosmos Studios, Inc, with Joseph Firmage.[27] As CEO of Cosmos Studios, Druyan produces science-based entertainment for all media. In addition to _Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey,_ Cosmos Studios has produced _Cosmic Africa_,[28] _Lost Dinosaurs of Egypt_,[29] and the Emmy-nominated[30] documentary _Cosmic Journey: The Voyager Interstellar Mission and Message_.[31] In 2009, she distributed a series of podcasts called _At Home in the Cosmos with Annie Druyan_ in which she described her works, the life of her husband, Carl Sagan, and their marriage.

Druyan was one of the three writers of the TV series _Cosmos: A Personal Voyage_, along with Carl Sagan and Steven Soter. Druyan is credited, with Carl Sagan, as the co-creator and co-producer of the 1997 feature film _Contact_.[32]

In 2011, it was announced that Druyan would executive produce, co-write, and be one of the episodic directors for a sequel to _Cosmos: A Personal Voyage_, to be called _Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey_, which began airing in March 2014.[33][34] Episodes premiered on Fox and also aired on National Geographic Channel on the following night.[35] At the time of its release, Fox gave the series the largest global rollout of a television series ever, debuting it in 180 countries. The premiere episode was shown across nine of Fox's cable properties in addition to the broadcast network in a "roadblock" style premiere. The series went on to become the most-watched series ever for National Geographic Channel International, with at least some part of the 13-episode series watched by 135 million people, including 45 million in the U.S.[36]


Activism

Druyan has for many years been a vocal advocate for nuclear disarmament. She was arrested three times at the Mercury, Nevada nuclear test site during Mikhail Gorbachev's unilateral moratorium on underground nuclear testing, with which President Ronald Reagan refused to cooperate. This included an arrest in June 1986, when Druyan crossed a white painted line indicating the test site's boundary; Sagan, who attended the same protest with Druyan, was not arrested.[37]

In the early 1990s, Druyan worked with Sagan and then-Senator Al Gore, Jr. and a host of religious and scientific leaders to bring the scientific and religious worlds together in a unified effort to preserve the environment, resulting in the _Declaration of the 'Mission to Washington._'[38]

Druyan served as a founding director of the Children's Health Fund until the spring of 2004, a project that provides mobile pediatric care to homeless and disadvantaged children in more than half a dozen cities. She currently serves a member of their Advisory Board[39].

In November 2007, Druyan was awarded the title of "Humanist Laureate" by the International Academy of Humanism[43].


Religious and philosophical views

In an interview with Joel Achenbach of _The Washington Post_, Druyan stated that her early interest in science stemmed from a fascination with Karl Marx. Achenbach commented that "She had, at the time, rather vaporous standards of evidence," a reference to her belief in the ancient astronauts of Erich von DÃ¤niken and the theories of Immanuel Velikovsky pertaining to the Solar System.[44] Druyan freely acknowledged her past views and also said that they after marrying Carl Sagan.
