Geography

Location

The Hochsimmer rises within the High Eifel (East Eifel) around 1.7 km west-northwest of the village of Ettringen. Flowing past its western foot roughly from north to south is part of the middle reaches of the Rhine tributary, the Nette. Through its valley runs the Landesstraße 83, which links Weibern to the northwest with Mayen to the southeast. At the eastern foot of the hill is the L 82 road to Bell, and, at its southern foot is the village of St. Johann.

Height and summits

The Hochsimmer has two domed summits or _kuppen_: the West Top () is high and the East Top () is high. About 600 metres southwest of the summit is the Kleiner Simmer ().


Towers

On the east top of the Hochsimmer stands the 18-metre-high Hochsimmer Tower, an observation tower built in 1909 and 1911. From its viewing platform there is a view of the Eastern High Eifel, the Middle Rhine Basin and of Ettringen; in good visibility, even Cologne Cathedral may be seen. About 30 metres northwest of the viewing tower is a transmission tower.
