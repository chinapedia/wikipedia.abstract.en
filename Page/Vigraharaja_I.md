VIGRAHARĀJA I (r. c. 734-759 CE ) was an Indian king from the Chahamana dynasty. He ruled parts of present-day Rajasthan in north-western India. He is also known as Vigrahanṛpa.

Vigraharaja succeeded his father Ajayaraja I as the Chahamana ruler. The _Prithviraja Vijaya_ praises him using conventional eulogies, which indicates that he achieved military successes.

According to _Prithviraja Vijaya_, Vigraharaja had two sons: Chandraraja and Gopendraraja. He was succeeded by Chandraraja, who in turn was succeeded by Gopendraraja. The later _Hammira Mahakavya_ mentions Chandraraja ("Shri Chandra") as the son of Vigraharaja's ancestor Naradeva.
