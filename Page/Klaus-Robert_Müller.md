KLAUS-ROBERT MÜLLER (born 1964 in Karlsruhe, Germany) is a German physicist and computer scientist, most noted for his work in Machine Learning and Brain-Computer Interfaces.


Career

Klaus-Robert Müller received his Diplom in mathematical physics and Ph.D. in theoretical computer science from the University of Karlsruhe. Following his Ph.D. he went to Berlin as a postdoctoral fellow at Fraunhofer FIRST (now part of Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems), where he started building up the Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA) group.

From 1994 to 1995 he was a research fellow at Shun'ichi Amaris lab at the University of Tokyo.

1999 Müller became an associate professor for neuroinformatics at the University of Potsdam, transitioning to the full professorship for Neural Networks and Time Series Analysis in 2003. Since 2006 he holds the chair for Machine Learning at the Technical University Berlin.

Since 2012 he holds a distinguished professorship at Korea University in Seoul. He co-founded and is co-director of the Berlin Big Data Center (BBDC) of the Technical University Berlin.


Research

He has contributed extensively to several major interests of Machine Learning, including Support Vector Machines and Kernel methods, and Neural Networks.[1] He pioneered applying new methods of pattern recognition in domains like Brain-Computer Interfaces, using them for patients suffering from Locked-in syndrome.

His present research interest include the application of time-series analysis and machine learning methods to domains such as the analysis of biomedical data (brain-computer interfacing, genomic data analysis, medical data mining), atomistic simulations and computational chemistry.[2]


Honours and awards

Klaus-Robert Müller was elected a fellow of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in 2012.

His work was honoured with several awards, including:

-   2014 Science Prize of Berlin 2014 by the Governing Mayor of Berlin[3]
-   2014 European Research Council Panel Consolidator Grants[4]
-   1999 Olympus Award for Pattern Recognition[5]
