Early on while pursuing her acting career, Carden also worked as a nanny for Bill Hader.[20][21]

Carden had a recurring role on the Comedy Central series _Broad City_,[22] a series created by fellow UCB alumnae Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson.[23] Carden has also appeared on _Inside Amy Schumer_ and _Crazy Ex-Girlfriend_.[24] She also had a small role in the movie _Other People_.[25]

In 2016, she began starring as Janet in the NBC comedy _The Good Place_.[26] The show stars Kristen Bell and Ted Danson.[27] Carden's character is a live virtual assistant.[28][29][30] In addition to working on _The Good Place_, Carden has a recurring role in the HBO series _Barry_, starring Hader, which premiered in 2018.[31][32] Along with her fellow cast members of _Barry_, Carden was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series in 2019.[33]
