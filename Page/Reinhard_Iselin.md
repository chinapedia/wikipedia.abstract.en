REINHARD ISELIN (4 August 1714 – 10 April 1781) was a Danish merchant, shipowner and industrialist who founded REINHARD ISELIN & CO. in Copenhagen in 1749. The company completed 65 expeditions to the Danish West Indies. Iselin was also active in the Danish Asiatic Company where he served on the board of directors from 1759 to 1769. He owned Iselingen and Rosenfeldt at Vordingborg. He was raised to the peerage with rank of baron in 1776 but the title died with him since both his sons died as infants.


Early life and education

Born in Basel, Iselin was the son of brazier Johan Ludvig Iselin (1676–1745) and his second wife Margaretha Schrotberger (died 1755). Iselin completed an apprenticeship before travelling first to Cologne and then Copenhagen in 1740,


Shipping

In Copenhagen, Iselin initially worked for Fabritius & Wever, a trading house owned by Michael Fabritius.

In 1749 he established his own trading house under the name Reinhard Iselin & Co. which soon grew to be one of the most important in Copenhagen. Iselin was involved in many of the chartered companies of the time and served as director of the Danish Asiatic Company from 1759 to 1769. He was also active in the Danish Africa Company which was founded at the initiative of Count Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff. He belonged to the circle of merchants that Bernstorff relied on for state loans.[1]

A stroke forced Icelin to reture from the company in 1777. It was then continued by his wife until her death. The firm owned four ships in 1779. Iselin & Co. completed a total of 65 expeditions to the Danish West Indies.[2]
