_The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part_ (2019)

Before the critical acclaim and blockbuster success of _The Lego Movie_, talks for a sequel were already in motion. On February 3, 2014, Jared Stern and Michelle Morgan were tasked to write a screenplay.[1] On February 21, 2014, the studio scheduled the sequel for a May 26, 2017, release.[2] On March 12, 2014, _Deadline_ reported that the first film's animation co-director Chris McKay would direct the sequel with Phil Lord and Christopher Miller as producers.[3] Warner Bros. did not invite co-producer of the first film, Village Roadshow Pictures, to return as a participant in the sequel, due to Warner Bros. having now more confidence in the film and trying to keep as much profit as possible for itself.[4] On April 10, 2014, McKay expressed that he would like to introduce more women in the sequel than men.[5] On July 28, 2014, it was reported that on the internet, Chris Pratt expressed interest in reprising his role as Emmet for the sequel.[6] It was also reported that Will Arnett might return as Batman, but had not decided yet.

In October 2014, Warner Bros. scheduled _The Lego Batman Movie_ for 2017, and _The Lego Movie 2_ for 2018.[7] By October 25, 2014, Lord and Miller had signed on to write _The Lego Movie 2_.[8] The writers have implied that the sequel will take place four years after the events of _The Lego Movie_.[9] In February 2015, Warner Bros. announced that the title of the sequel had been changed to _The Lego Movie Sequel_, and that Rob Schrab, co-writer of _Monster House_ replaced McKay as director since McKay went to direct _The Lego Batman Movie_.[10] According to an interview at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, the sequel will focus on Emmet and his sister, taking place in "weird, dystopian version of Bricksburg."[11] On April 20, 2015, Warner Bros. scheduled _The Lego Movie Sequel_ for a May 18, 2018 release date.[12] On June 17, 2016, the film's release was delayed until February 8, 2019.[13] By July 2016, Raphael Bob-Waksberg had been hired to do rewrites of the script.[14] By February 2017, Schrab had been replaced by Mike Mitchell, reportedly due to "creative differences".[15] On September 6, 2017, it was announced that production of _The Lego Movie Sequel_ would begin in Canada on October 2, 2017.[16][17] It was also announced that Lord and Miller have returned to re-rewrite the script to tackle with gender issues on how a girl plays vs. how a boy plays.[18]

On March 23, 2018, it was confirmed that Tiffany Haddish was cast in the film as a new lead character while returning actors would be Pratt as regular guy turned Master Builder Emmet Brickowski, Elizabeth Banks as Wyldstyle, Arnett as Batman, Channing Tatum as Superman and Jonah Hill as Green Lantern.[19] On May 21, 2018, Warner Bros. officially renamed the film _The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part_ along with releasing the first teaser poster.[20][21]

During an interview with Moviefone on February 7, 2019, Pratt expressed his idea for a potential third film in the series.
