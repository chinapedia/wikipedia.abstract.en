Musical}} '' was a hit musical in 1866.]] MUSICAL THEATRE is a form of theatrical performance that combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting and dance. The story and emotional content of a musical – humor, pathos, love, anger – are communicated through words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, MUSICALS.

Although music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century, with many structural elements established by the works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in America. These were followed by the numerous Edwardian musical comedies and the musical theatre works of American creators like George M. Cohan at the turn of the 20th century. The Princess Theatre musicals (1915–1918) and other smart shows like _Of Thee I Sing_ (1931) were artistic steps forward beyond revues and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as _Show Boat_ (1927) and _Oklahoma!_ (1943). Some of the most famous musicals through the decades that followed include _West Side Story_ (1957), _The Fantasticks_ (1960), _Hair_ (1967), _A Chorus Line_ (1975), _Les Misérables_ (1985), _The Phantom of the Opera_ (1986), _Rent_ (1996), _The Producers_ (2001), _Wicked_ (2003) and _Hamilton_ (2015).

Musicals are performed around the world. They may be presented in large venues, such as big-budget Broadway or West End productions in New York City or London. Alternatively, musicals may be staged in smaller venues, such as fringe theatre, Off-Broadway, Off-Off-Broadway, regional theatre, or community theatre productions, or on tour. Musicals are often presented by amateur and school groups in churches, schools and other performance spaces. In addition to the United States and Britain, there are vibrant musical theatre scenes in continental Europe, Asia, Australasia, Canada and Latin America.


Definitions and scope

Book musicals

'' (1893) was one of the first hit musicals]] Since the 20th century, the "book musical" has been defined as a musical play where songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that is able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter. The three main components of a book musical are its _music_, _lyrics_ and _book_. The book or script of a musical refers to the story, character development and dramatic structure, including the spoken dialogue and stage directions, but it can also refer to the dialogue and lyrics together, which are sometimes referred to as the _libretto_ (Italian for "little book"). The music and lyrics together form the _score_ of a musical and include songs, incidental music and musical scenes, which are "theatrical sequence[s] set to music, often combining song with spoken dialogue."[1] The interpretation of a musical is the responsibility of its creative team, which includes a director, a musical director, usually a choreographer and sometimes an orchestrator. A musical's production is also creatively characterized by technical aspects, such as set design, costumes, stage properties (props), lighting and sound. The creative team, designs and interpretations generally change from the original production to succeeding productions. Some production elements, however, may be retained from the original production, for example, Bob Fosse's choreography in _Chicago_.

There is no fixed length for a musical. While it can range from a short one-act entertainment to several acts and several hours in length (or even a multi-evening presentation), most musicals range from one and a half to three hours. Musicals are usually presented in two acts, with one short intermission, and the first act is frequently longer than the second. The first act generally introduces nearly all of the characters and most of the music and often ends with the introduction of a dramatic conflict or plot complication while the second act may introduce a few new songs but usually contains reprises of important musical themes and resolves the conflict or complication. A book musical is usually built around four to six main theme tunes that are reprised later in the show, although it sometimes consists of a series of songs not directly musically related. Spoken dialogue is generally interspersed between musical numbers, although "sung dialogue" or recitative may be used, especially in so-called "sung-through" musicals such as _Jesus Christ Superstar_, _Falsettos_, _Les Misérables_, _Evita_ and _Hamilton_. Several shorter musicals on Broadway and in the West End have been presented in one act in recent decades.

Moments of greatest dramatic intensity in a book musical are often performed in song. Proverbially, "when the emotion becomes too strong for speech, you sing; when it becomes too strong for song, you dance."[2] In a book musical, a song is ideally crafted to suit the character (or characters) and their situation within the story; although there have been times in the history of the musical (e.g. from the 1890s to the 1920s) when this integration between music and story has been tenuous. As _The New York Times_ critic Ben Brantley described the ideal of song in theatre when reviewing the 2008 revival of _Gypsy_: "There is no separation at all between song and character, which is what happens in those uncommon moments when musicals reach upward to achieve their ideal reasons to be."[3] Typically, many fewer words are sung in a five-minute song than are spoken in a five-minute block of dialogue. Therefore, there is less time to develop drama in a musical than in a straight play of equivalent length, since a musical usually devotes more time to music than to dialogue. Within the compressed nature of a musical, the writers must develop the characters and the plot.

The material presented in a musical may be original, or it may be adapted from novels (_Wicked_ and _Man of La Mancha_), plays (_Hello, Dolly!_ and _Carousel_), classic legends (_Camelot_), historical events (_Evita_) or films (_The Producers_ and _Billy Elliot_). On the other hand, many successful musical theatre works have been adapted for musical films, such as _West Side Story_, _My Fair Lady_, _The Sound of Music_, _Oliver!_ and _Chicago_.

Comparisons with opera

]] Musical theatre is closely related to the theatrical form of opera, but the two are usually distinguished by weighing a number of factors. First, musicals generally have a greater focus on spoken dialogue. Some musicals, however, are entirely accompanied and sung-through, while some operas, such as _Die Zauberflöte_, and most operettas, have some unaccompanied dialogue. Second, musicals also usually include more dancing as an essential part of the storytelling, particularly by the principal performers as well as the chorus. Third, musicals often use various genres of popular music or at least popular singing and musical styles.[4]

Finally, musicals usually avoid certain operatic conventions. In particular, a musical is almost always performed in the language of its audience. Musicals produced on Broadway or in the West End, for instance, are invariably sung in English, even if they were originally written in another language. While an opera singer is primarily a singer and only secondarily an actor (and rarely needs to dance), a musical theatre performer is often an actor first but must also be a singer and dancer. Someone who is equally accomplished at all three is referred to as a "triple threat". Composers of music for musicals often consider the vocal demands of roles with musical theatre performers in mind. Today, large theatres that stage musicals generally use microphones and amplification of the actors' singing voices in a way that would generally be disapproved of in an operatic context.[5]

Some works (e.g. by George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim) have been made into both "musical theatre" and "operatic" productions.[6][7] Similarly, some older operettas or light operas (such as _The Pirates of Penzance_ by Gilbert and Sullivan) have been produced in modern adaptations that treat them as musicals. For some works, production styles are almost as important as the work's musical or dramatic content in defining into which art form the piece falls.[8] Sondheim said, "I really think that when something plays Broadway it's a musical, and when it plays in an opera house it's opera. That's it. It's the terrain, the countryside, the expectations of the audience that make it one thing or another."[9] There remains an overlap in form between lighter operatic forms and more musically complex or ambitious musicals. In practice, it is often difficult to distinguish among the various kinds of musical theatre, including "musical play", "musical comedy", "operetta" and "light opera".[10]

Like opera, the singing in musical theatre is generally accompanied by an instrumental ensemble called a pit orchestra, located in a lowered area in front of the stage. While opera typically uses a conventional symphony orchestra, musicals are generally orchestrated for ensembles ranging from 27 players down to only a few players. Rock musicals usually employ a small group of mostly rock instruments,[11] and some musicals may call for only a piano or two instruments.[12] The music in musicals uses a range of "styles and influences including operetta, classical techniques, folk music, jazz [and] local or historical styles [that] are appropriate to the setting."[13] Musicals may begin with an overture played by the orchestra that "weav[es] together excerpts of the score's famous melodies."[14]

Eastern traditions and other forms

There are various Eastern traditions of theatre that include music, such as Chinese opera, Taiwanese opera, Japanese Noh and Indian musical theatre, including Sanskrit drama, Indian classical dance, Parsi theatre and Yakshagana.[15] India has, since the 20th century, produced numerous musical films, referred to as "Bollywood" musicals, and in Japan a series of 2.5D musicals based on popular anime and manga comics has developed in recent decades.

Shorter or simplified "junior" versions of many musicals are available for schools and youth groups, and very short works created or adapted for performance by children are sometimes called minimusicals.[16][17]


History

Early antecedents of musical theatre

The antecedents of musical theatre in Europe can be traced back to the theatre of ancient Greece, where music and dance were included in stage comedies and tragedies during the 5th century BCE.[18] The music from the ancient forms is lost, however, and they had little influence on later development of musical theatre.[19] In the 12th and 13th centuries, religious dramas taught the liturgy. Groups of actors would use outdoor Pageant wagons (stages on wheels) to tell each part of the story. Poetic forms sometimes alternated with the prose dialogues, and liturgical chants gave way to new melodies.

In England, Elizabethan and Jacobean plays frequently included music,[20] and short musical plays began to be included in an evenings' dramatic entertainments.[21] Court masques developed during the Tudor period that involved music, dancing, singing and acting, often with expensive costumes and a complex stage design.[22][23] These developed into sung plays that are recognizable as English operas, the first usually being thought of as _The Siege of Rhodes_ (1656).[24] In France, meanwhile, Molière turned several of his farcical comedies into musical entertainments with songs (music provided by Jean-Baptiste Lully) and dance in the late 17th century. These influenced a brief period of English opera[25] by composers such as John Blow[26] and Henry Purcell.[27]

From the 18th century, the most popular forms of musical theatre in Britain were ballad operas, like John Gay's _The Beggar's Opera_, that included lyrics written to the tunes of popular songs of the day (often spoofing opera), and later pantomime, which developed from commedia dell'arte, and comic opera with mostly romantic plot lines, like Michael Balfe's _The Bohemian Girl_ (1845). Meanwhile, on the continent, singspiel, comédie en vaudeville, opéra comique, zarzuela and other forms of light musical entertainment were emerging. _The Beggar's Opera_ was the first recorded long-running play of any kind, running for 62 successive performances in 1728. It would take almost a century afterwards before any play broke 100 performances, but the record soon reached 150 in the late 1820s.[28] Other musical theatre forms developed in England by the 19th century, such as music hall, melodrama and burletta, which were popularized partly because most London theatres were licensed only as music halls and not allowed to present plays without music.

Colonial America did not have a significant theatre presence until 1752, when London entrepreneur William Hallam sent a company of actors to the colonies managed by his brother Lewis.[29] In New York in the summer of 1753, they performed ballad-operas, such as _The Beggar's Opera_, and ballad-farces.[30] By the 1840s, P. T. Barnum was operating an entertainment complex in lower Manhattan.[31] Other early musical theatre in America consisted of British forms, such as burletta and pantomime,[32] but what a piece was called did not necessarily define what it was. The 1852 Broadway extravaganza _The Magic Deer_ advertised itself as "A Serio Comico Tragico Operatical Historical Extravaganzical Burletical Tale of Enchantment."[33] Theatre in New York moved from downtown gradually to midtown from around 1850, and did not arrive in the Times Square area until the 1920s and 1930s. New York runs lagged far behind those in London, but Laura Keene's "musical burletta" _Seven Sisters_ (1860) shattered previous New York musical theatre record, with a run of 253 performances.[34]

1850s to 1880s

Around 1850, the French composer Hervé was experimenting with a form of comic musical theatre he called opérette.[35] The best known composers of operetta were Jacques Offenbach from the 1850s to the 1870s and Johann Strauss II in the 1870s and 1880s.[36] Offenbach's fertile melodies, combined with his librettists' witty satire, formed a model for the musical theatre that followed.[37] Adaptations of the French operettas (played in mostly bad, risqué translations), musical burlesques, music hall, pantomime and burletta dominated the London musical stage into the 1870s.[38]

In America, mid-18th century musical theatre entertainments included crude variety revue, which eventually developed into vaudeville, minstrel shows, which soon crossed the Atlantic to Britain, and Victorian burlesque, first popularized in the US by British troupes.[39] A hugely successful musical that premiered in New York in 1866, _The Black Crook_, was an original musical theatre piece that conformed to many of the modern definitions of a musical, including dance and original music that helped to tell the story. The spectacular production, famous for its skimpy costumes, ran for a record-breaking 474 performances.[40] The same year, _The Black Domino/Between You, Me and the Post_ was the first show to call itself a "musical comedy." Comedians Edward Harrigan and Tony Hart produced and starred in musicals on Broadway between 1878 (_The Mulligan Guard Picnic_) and 1885. These musical comedies featured characters and situations taken from the everyday life of New York's lower classes and represented a significant step forward towards a more legitimate theatrical form. They starred high quality singers (Lillian Russell, Vivienne Segal and Fay Templeton) instead of the ladies of questionable repute who had starred in earlier musical forms.

As transportation improved, poverty in London and New York diminished, and street lighting made for safer travel at night, the number of patrons for the growing number of theatres increased enormously. Plays ran longer, leading to better profits and improved production values, and men began to bring their families to the theatre. The first musical theatre piece to exceed 500 consecutive performances was the French operetta _The Chimes of Normandy_ in 1878.[41] English comic opera adopted many of the successful ideas of European operetta, none more successfully than the series of more than a dozen long-running Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas, including _H.M.S. Pinafore_ (1878) and _The Mikado_ (1885).[42] These were sensations on both sides of the Atlantic and in Australia and helped to raise the standard for what was considered a successful show.[43] These shows were designed for family audiences, a marked contrast from the risqué burlesques, bawdy music hall shows and French operettas that sometimes drew a crowd seeking less wholesome entertainment.[44] Only a few 19th-century musical pieces exceeded the run of _The Mikado_, such as _Dorothy_, which opened in 1886 and set a new record with a run of 931 performances. Gilbert and Sullivan's influence on later musical theatre was profound, creating examples of how to "integrate" musicals so that the lyrics and dialogue advanced a coherent story.[45][46] Their works were admired and copied by early authors and composers of musicals in Britain[47][48] and America.[49][50]

1890s to the new century

' _The Geisha_]] _A Trip to Chinatown_ (1891) was Broadway's long-run champion (until _Irene_ in 1919), running for 657 performances, but New York runs continued to be relatively short, with a few exceptions, compared with London runs, until the 1920s.[51] Gilbert and Sullivan were both pirated and imitated in New York by productions such as Reginald De Koven's _Robin Hood_ (1891) and John Philip Sousa's _El Capitan_ (1896). _A Trip to Coontown_ (1898) was the first musical comedy entirely produced and performed by African Americans on Broadway (largely inspired by the routines of the minstrel shows), followed by ragtime-tinged shows. Hundreds of musical comedies were staged on Broadway in the 1890s and early 20th century, composed of songs written in New York's Tin Pan Alley, including those by George M. Cohan, who worked to create an American style distinct from the Gilbert and Sullivan works. The most successful New York shows were often followed by extensive national tours.[52]

Meanwhile, musicals took over the London stage in the Gay Nineties, led by producer George Edwardes, who perceived that audiences wanted a new alternative to the Savoy-style comic operas and their intellectual, political, absurdist satire. He experimented with a modern-dress, family-friendly musical theatre style, with breezy, popular songs, snappy, romantic banter, and stylish spectacle at the Gaiety and his other theatres. These drew on the traditions of comic opera and used elements of burlesque and of the Harrigan and Hart pieces. He replaced the bawdy women of burlesque with his "respectable" corps of Gaiety Girls to complete the musical and visual fun. The success of the first of these, _In Town_ (1892) and _A Gaiety Girl_ (1893) set the style for the next three decades. The plots were generally light, romantic "poor maiden loves aristocrat and wins him against all odds" shows, with music by Ivan Caryll, Sidney Jones and Lionel Monckton. These shows were immediately widely copied in America, and Edwardian musical comedy swept away the earlier musical forms of comic opera and operetta. _The Geisha_ (1896) was one of the most successful in the 1890s, running for more than two years and achieving great international success.

_The Belle of New York_ (1898) became the first American musical to run for over a year in London. The British musical comedy _Florodora_ (1899) was a popular success on both sides of the Atlantic, as was _A Chinese Honeymoon_ (1901), which ran for a record-setting 1,074 performances in London and 376 in New York. After the turn of the 20th century, Seymour Hicks joined forces with Edwardes and American producer Charles Frohman to create another decade of popular shows. Other enduring Edwardian musical comedy hits included _The Arcadians_ (1909) and _The Quaker Girl_ (1910).[53]

Early 20th century

]] Virtually eliminated from the English-speaking stage by competition from the ubiquitous Edwardian musical comedies, operettas returned to London and Broadway in 1907 with _The Merry Widow_, and adaptations of continental operettas became direct competitors with musicals. Franz Lehár and Oscar Straus composed new operettas that were popular in English until World War I.[54] In America, Victor Herbert produced a string of enduring operettas including _The Fortune Teller_ (1898), _Babes in Toyland_ (1903), _Mlle. Modiste_ (1905), _The Red Mill_ (1906) and _Naughty Marietta_ (1910).

In the 1910s, the team of P. G. Wodehouse, Guy Bolton and Jerome Kern, following in the footsteps of Gilbert and Sullivan, created the "Princess Theatre shows" and paved the way for Kern's later work by showing that a musical could combine light, popular entertainment with continuity between its story and songs.[55] Historian Gerald Bordman wrote:

The theatre-going public needed escapist entertainment during the dark times of World War I, and they flocked to the theatre. The 1919 hit musical _Irene_ ran for 670 performances, a Broadway record that held until 1938.[56] The British theatre public supported far longer runs like that of _The Maid of the Mountains_ (1,352 performances) and especially _Chu Chin Chow_. Its run of 2,238 performances was more than twice as long as any previous musical, setting a record that stood for nearly forty years.[57] Revues like _The Bing Boys Are Here_ in Britain, and those of Florenz Ziegfeld and his imitators in America, were also extraordinarily popular.[58]

'', 1920]] The musicals of the Roaring Twenties, borrowing from vaudeville, music hall and other light entertainments, tended to emphasize big dance routines and popular songs at the expense of plot. Typical of the decade were lighthearted productions like _Sally_, _Lady, Be Good_, _No, No, Nanette_, _Oh, Kay!_ and _Funny Face_. Despite forgettable stories, these musicals featured stars such as Marilyn Miller and Fred Astaire and produced dozens of enduring popular songs by Kern, George and Ira Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter and Rodgers and Hart. Popular music was dominated by musical theatre standards, such as "Fascinating Rhythm", "Tea for Two" and "Someone to Watch Over Me". Many shows were revues, series of sketches and songs with little or no connection between them. The best-known of these were the annual _Ziegfeld Follies_, spectacular song-and-dance revues on Broadway featuring extravagant sets, elaborate costumes and beautiful chorus girls.[59] These spectacles also raised production values, and mounting a musical generally became more expensive.[60] _Shuffle Along_ (1921), an all-African American show was a hit on Broadway.[61] A new generation of composers of operettas also emerged in the 1920s, such as Rudolf Friml and Sigmund Romberg, to create a series of popular Broadway hits.[62]

In London, writer-stars such as Ivor Novello and Noël Coward became popular, but the primacy of British musical theatre from the 19th century through 1920 was gradually replaced by American innovation, especially after World War I, as Kern and other Tin Pan Alley composers began to bring new musical styles such as ragtime and jazz to the theatres, and the Shubert Brothers took control of the Broadway theatres. Musical theatre writer Andrew Lamb notes, "The operatic and theatrical styles of nineteenth-century social structures were replaced by a musical style more aptly suited to twentieth-century society and its vernacular idiom. It was from America that the more direct style emerged, and in America that it was able to flourish in a developing society less hidebound by nineteenth-century tradition."[63] In France, _comédie musicale_ was written between in the early decades of the century for such stars as Yvonne Printemps.[64]

_Show Boat_ and the Great Depression

Progressing far beyond the comparatively frivolous musicals and sentimental operettas of the decade, Broadway's _Show Boat_ (1927), represented an even more complete integration of book and score than the Princess Theatre musicals, with dramatic themes told through the music, dialogue, setting and movement. This was accomplished by combining the lyricism of Kern's music with the skillful libretto of Oscar Hammerstein II. One historian wrote, "Here we come to a completely new genre – the musical play as distinguished from musical comedy. Now ... everything else was subservient to that play. Now ... came complete integration of song, humor and production numbers into a single and inextricable artistic entity."[65]

]] As the Great Depression set in during the post-Broadway national tour of _Show Boat_, the public turned back to mostly light, escapist song-and-dance entertainment.[66] Audiences on both sides of the Atlantic had little money to spend on entertainment, and only a few stage shows anywhere exceeded a run of 500 performances during the decade. The revue _The Band Wagon_ (1931) starred dancing partners Fred Astaire and his sister Adele, while Porter's _Anything Goes_ (1934) confirmed Ethel Merman's position as the First Lady of musical theatre, a title she maintained for many years. Coward and Novello continued to deliver old fashioned, sentimental musicals, such as _The Dancing Years_, while Rodgers and Hart returned from Hollywood to create a series of successful Broadway shows, including _On Your Toes_ (1936, with Ray Bolger, the first Broadway musical to make dramatic use of classical dance), _Babes in Arms_ (1937) and _The Boys from Syracuse_ (1938). Porter added _DuBarry Was a Lady_ (1939). The longest-running piece of musical theatre of the 1930s was _Hellzapoppin_ (1938), a revue with audience participation, which played for 1,404 performances, setting a new Broadway record.[67]

Still, a few creative teams began to build on _Show Boat_{{'}}s innovations. _Of Thee I Sing_ (1931), a political satire by the Gershwins, was the first musical awarded the Pulitzer Prize.[68][69] _As Thousands Cheer_ (1933), a revue by Irving Berlin and Moss Hart in which each song or sketch was based on a newspaper headline, marked the first Broadway show in which an African-American, Ethel Waters, starred alongside white actors. Waters' numbers included "Supper Time", a woman's lament for her husband who has been lynched.[70] The Gershwins' _Porgy and Bess_ (1935) featured an all African-American cast and blended operatic, folk and jazz idioms. _The Cradle Will Rock_ (1937), directed by Orson Welles, was a highly political pro-union piece that, despite the controversy surrounding it, ran for 108 performances.[71] Rodgers and Hart's _I'd Rather Be Right_ (1937) was a political satire with George M. Cohan as President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Kurt Weill's _Knickerbocker Holiday_ depicted New York City's early history while good-naturedly satirizing Roosevelt's good intentions.

The motion picture mounted a challenge to the stage. Silent films had presented only limited competition, but by the end of the 1920s, films like _The Jazz Singer_ could be presented with synchronized sound. "Talkie" films at low prices effectively killed off vaudeville by the early 1930s.[72] Despite the economic woes of the 1930s and the competition from film, the musical survived. In fact, it continued to evolve thematically beyond the gags and showgirls musicals of the _Gay Nineties_ and _Roaring Twenties_ and the sentimental romance of operetta, adding technical expertise and the fast-paced staging and naturalistic dialogue style led by director George Abbott.[73]

The Golden Age (1940s to 1960s)

(left and right) and Irving Berlin (center)]]

1940s

The 1940s would begin with more hits from Porter, Irving Berlin, Rodgers and Hart, Weill and Gershwin, some with runs over 500 performances as the economy rebounded, but artistic change was in the air.

Rodgers and Hammerstein's _Oklahoma!_ (1943) completed the revolution begun by _Show Boat_, by tightly integrating all the aspects of musical theatre, with a cohesive plot, songs that furthered the action of the story, and featured dream ballets and other dances that advanced the plot and developed the characters, rather than using dance as an excuse to parade scantily clad women across the stage. Rodgers and Hammerstein hired ballet choreographer Agnes de Mille, who used everyday motions to help the characters express their ideas. It defied musical conventions by raising its first act curtain not on a bevy of chorus girls, but rather on a woman churning butter, with an off-stage voice singing the opening lines of _Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'_ unaccompanied. It drew rave reviews, set off a box-office frenzy and received a Pulitzer Prize.[74] Brooks Atkinson wrote in _The New York Times_ that the show's opening number changed the history of musical theater: "After a verse like that, sung to a buoyant melody, the banalities of the old musical stage became intolerable."[75] It was the first "blockbuster" Broadway show, running a total of 2,212 performances, and was made into a hit film. It remains one of the most frequently produced of the team's projects. William A. Everett and Paul R. Laird wrote that this was a "show, that, like _Show Boat_, became a milestone, so that later historians writing about important moments in twentieth-century theatre would begin to identify eras according to their relationship to _Oklahoma!_"

"After _Oklahoma!_, Rodgers and Hammerstein were the most important contributors to the musical-play form... The examples they set in creating vital plays, often rich with social thought, provided the necessary encouragement for other gifted writers to create musical plays of their own".[76] The two collaborators created an extraordinary collection of some of musical theatre's best loved and most enduring classics, including _Carousel_ (1945), _South Pacific_ (1949), _The King and I_ (1951) and _The Sound of Music_ (1959). Some of these musicals treat more serious subject matter than most earlier shows: the villain in _Oklahoma!_ is a suspected murderer and psychopath with a fondness for lewd post cards; _Carousel_ deals with spousal abuse, thievery, suicide and the afterlife; _South Pacific_ explores miscegenation even more thoroughly than _Show Boat_; and the hero of _The King and I_ dies onstage.

The show's creativity stimulated Rodgers and Hammerstein's contemporaries and ushered in the "Golden Age" of American musical theatre.[77] Americana was displayed on Broadway during the "Golden Age", as the wartime cycle of shows began to arrive. An example of this is _On the Town_ (1944), written by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, composed by Leonard Bernstein and choreographed by Jerome Robbins. The story is set during wartime and concerns three sailors who are on a 24-hour shore leave in New York City, during which each falls in love. The show also gives the impression of a country with an uncertain future, as the sailors and their women also have. Irving Berlin used sharpshooter Annie Oakley's career as a basis for his _Annie Get Your Gun_ (1946, 1,147 performances); Burton Lane, E. Y. Harburg and Fred Saidy combined political satire with Irish whimsy for their fantasy _Finian's Rainbow_ (1947, 725 performances); and Cole Porter found inspiration in William Shakespeare's _The Taming of the Shrew_ for _Kiss Me, Kate_ (1948, 1,077 performances). The American musicals overwhelmed the old-fashioned British Coward/Novello-style shows, one of the last big successes of which was Novello's _Perchance to Dream_ (1945, 1,021 performances). The formula for the Golden Age musicals reflected one or more of four widely held perceptions of the "American dream": That stability and worth derives from a love relationship sanctioned and restricted by Protestant ideals of marriage; that a married couple should make a moral home with children away from the city in a suburb or small town; that the woman's function was as homemaker and mother; and that Americans incorporate an independent and pioneering spirit or that their success is self-made.

1950s

]] The 1950s were crucial to the development of the American musical.[78] Damon Runyon's eclectic characters were at the core of Frank Loesser's and Abe Burrows' _Guys and Dolls_, (1950, 1,200 performances); and the Gold Rush was the setting for Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's _Paint Your Wagon_ (1951). The relatively brief seven-month run of that show didn't discourage Lerner and Loewe from collaborating again, this time on _My Fair Lady_ (1956), an adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's _Pygmalion_ starring Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews, which at 2,717 performances held the long-run record for many years. Popular Hollywood films were made of all of these musicals. This surpassed the run of two hits by British creators: _The Boy Friend_ (1954), which ran for 2,078 performances in London and marked Andrews' American debut, was very briefly the third longest-running musical in West End or Broadway history (after _Chu Chin Chow_ and _Oklahoma!_), until _Salad Days_ (1954) surpassed its run and became the new long-run record holder, with 2,283 performances.[79]

Another record was set by _The Threepenny Opera_, which ran for 2,707 performances, becoming the longest-running off-Broadway musical until _The Fantasticks_. The production also broke ground by showing that musicals could be profitable off-Broadway in a small-scale, small orchestra format. This was confirmed in 1959 when a revival of Jerome Kern and P. G. Wodehouse's _Leave It to Jane_ ran for more than two years. The 1959–1960 Off-Broadway season included a dozen musicals and revues including _Little Mary Sunshine_, _The Fantasticks_ and _Ernest in Love_, a musical adaptation of Oscar Wilde's 1895 hit _The Importance of Being Earnest_.[80]

, 1971]] _West Side Story_ (1957) transported _Romeo and Juliet_ to modern day New York City and converted the feuding Montague and Capulet families into opposing ethnic gangs, the Jets and the Sharks. The book was adapted by Arthur Laurents, with music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by newcomer Stephen Sondheim. It was embraced by the critics, but failed to be a popular choice for the "blue-haired matinee ladies", who preferred the small town River City, Iowa of Meredith Willson's _The Music Man_ to the alleys of Manhattan's Upper West Side. Apparently Tony Award voters were of a similar mind, since they favored the former over the latter. _West Side Story_ had a respectable run of 732 performances (1,040 in the West End), while _The Music Man_ ran nearly twice as long, with 1,375 performances. However, the 1961 film of _West Side Story_ was extremely successful.[81] Laurents and Sondheim teamed up again for _Gypsy_ (1959, 702 performances), with Jule Styne providing the music for a backstage story about the most driven stage mother of all-time, stripper Gypsy Rose Lee's mother Rose. The original production ran for 702 performances, and was given four subsequent revivals, with Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daly, Bernadette Peters and Patti LuPone later tackling the role made famous by Ethel Merman.

Although directors and choreographers have had a major influence on musical theatre style since at least the 19th century,[82] George Abbott and his collaborators and successors took a central role in integrating movement and dance fully into musical theatre productions in the Golden Age.[83] Abbott introduced ballet as a story-telling device in _On Your Toes_ in 1936, which was followed by Agnes de Mille's ballet and choreography in _Oklahoma!_.[84] After Abbott collaborated with Jerome Robbins in _On the Town_ and other shows, Robbins combined the roles of director and choreographer, emphasizing the story-telling power of dance in _West Side Story_, _A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum_ (1962) and _Fiddler on the Roof_ (1964). Bob Fosse choreographed for Abbott in _The Pajama Game_ (1956) and _Damn Yankees_ (1957), injecting playful sexuality into those hits. He was later the director-choreographer for _Sweet Charity_ (1968), _Pippin_ (1972) and _Chicago_ (1975). Other notable director-choreographers have included Gower Champion, Tommy Tune, Michael Bennett, Gillian Lynne and Susan Stroman. Prominent directors have included Hal Prince, who also got his start with Abbott,[85] and Trevor Nunn.[86]

During the Golden Age, automotive companies and other large corporations began to hire Broadway talent to write corporate musicals, private shows only seen by their employees or customers.[87][88] The 1950s ended with Rodgers and Hammerstein's last hit, _The Sound of Music_, which also became another hit for Mary Martin. It ran for 1,443 performances and shared the Tony Award for Best Musical. Together with its extremely successful 1965 film version, it has become one of the most popular musicals in history.

1960s

In 1960, _The Fantasticks_ was first produced off-Broadway. This intimate allegorical show would quietly run for over 40 years at the Sullivan Street Theatre in Greenwich Village, becoming by far the longest-running musical in history. Its authors produced other innovative works in the 1960s, such as _Celebration_ and _I Do! I Do!_, the first two-character Broadway musical. The 1960s would see a number of blockbusters, like _Fiddler on the Roof_ (1964; 3,242 performances), _Hello, Dolly!_ (1964; 2,844 performances), _Funny Girl_ (1964; 1,348 performances) and _Man of La Mancha_ (1965; 2,328 performances), and some more risqué pieces like _Cabaret_, before ending with the emergence of the rock musical. Two men had considerable impact on musical theatre history beginning in this decade: Stephen Sondheim and Jerry Herman.

(shown in 2008) has starred in five Sondheim musicals]] The first project for which Sondheim wrote both music and lyrics was _A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum_ (1962, 964 performances), with a book based on the works of Plautus by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart, starring Zero Mostel. Sondheim moved the musical beyond its concentration on the romantic plots typical of earlier eras; his work tended to be darker, exploring the grittier sides of life both present and past. Other early Sondheim works include _Anyone Can Whistle_ (1964, which ran only nine performances, despite having stars Lee Remick and Angela Lansbury), and the successful _Company_ (1970), _Follies_ (1971) and _A Little Night Music_ (1973). Later, Sondheim found inspiration in unlikely sources: the opening of Japan to Western trade for _Pacific Overtures_ (1976), a legendary murderous barber seeking revenge in the Industrial Age of London for _Sweeney Todd_ (1979), the paintings of Georges Seurat for _Sunday in the Park with George_ (1984), fairy tales for _Into the Woods_ (1987), and a collection of presidential assassins in _Assassins_ (1990).

While some critics have argued that some of Sondheim's musicals lack commercial appeal, others have praised their lyrical sophistication and musical complexity, as well as the interplay of lyrics and music in his shows. Some of Sondheim's notable innovations include a show presented in reverse (_Merrily We Roll Along_) and the above-mentioned _Anyone Can Whistle_, in which the first act ends with the cast informing the audience that they are mad.

Jerry Herman played a significant role in American musical theatre, beginning with his first Broadway production, _Milk and Honey_ (1961, 563 performances), about the founding of the state of Israel, and continuing with the blockbuster hits _Hello, Dolly!_ (1964, 2,844 performances), _Mame_ (1966, 1,508 performances), and _La Cage aux Folles_ (1983, 1,761 performances). Even his less successful shows like _Dear World_ (1969) and _Mack and Mabel_ (1974) have had memorable scores (_Mack and Mabel_ was later reworked into a London hit). Writing both words and music, many of Herman's show tunes have become popular standards, including "Hello, Dolly!", "We Need a Little Christmas", "I Am What I Am", "Mame", "The Best of Times", "Before the Parade Passes By", "Put On Your Sunday Clothes", "It Only Takes a Moment", "Bosom Buddies" and "I Won't Send Roses", recorded by such artists as Louis Armstrong, Eydie Gormé, Barbra Streisand, Petula Clark and Bernadette Peters. Herman's songbook has been the subject of two popular musical revues, _Jerry's Girls_ (Broadway, 1985) and _Showtune_ (off-Broadway, 2003).

The musical started to diverge from the relatively narrow confines of the 1950s. Rock music would be used in several Broadway musicals, beginning with _Hair_, which featured not only rock music but also nudity and controversial opinions about the Vietnam War, race relations and other social issues.[89]

Social themes

After _Show Boat_ and _Porgy and Bess_, and as the struggle in America and elsewhere for minorities' civil rights progressed, Hammerstein, Harold Arlen, Yip Harburg and others were emboldened to write more musicals and operas that aimed to normalize societal toleration of minorities and urged racial harmony. Early Golden Age works that focused on racial tolerance included _Finian's Rainbow_ and _South Pacific_. Towards the end of the Golden Age, several shows tackled Jewish subjects and issues, such as _Fiddler on the Roof_, _Milk and Honey_, _Blitz!_ and later _Rags_. The original concept that became _West Side Story_ was set in the Lower East Side during Easter-Passover celebrations; the rival gangs were to be Jewish and Italian Catholic. The creative team later decided that the Polish (white) vs. Puerto Rican conflict was fresher.[90]

Tolerance as an important theme in musicals has continued in recent decades. The final expression of _West Side Story_ left a message of racial tolerance. By the end of the 1960s, musicals became racially integrated, with black and white cast members even covering each other's roles, as they did in _Hair_.[91] Homosexuality has also been explored in musicals, starting with _Hair_, and even more overtly in _La Cage aux Folles_, _Falsettos_, _Rent_, _Hedwig and the Angry Inch_ and other shows in recent decades. _Parade_ is a sensitive exploration of both anti-Semitism and historical American racism, and _Ragtime_ similarly explores the experience of immigrants and minorities in America.

1970s to present

1970s

'']] After the success of _Hair_, rock musicals flourished in the 1970s, with _Jesus Christ Superstar_, _Godspell_, _The Rocky Horror Show_, _Evita_ and _Two Gentlemen of Verona_. Some of those began with "concept albums" and then moved to film or stage, such as _Tommy_. Others had no dialogue or were otherwise reminiscent of opera, with dramatic, emotional themes; these sometimes started as concept albums and were referred to as rock operas. Shows like _Raisin_, _Dreamgirls_, _Purlie_ and _The Wiz_ brought a significant African-American influence to Broadway. More varied musical genres and styles were incorporated into musicals both on and especially off-Broadway. At the same time, Stephen Sondheim found success with some of his musicals, as mentioned above.

In 1975, the dance musical _A Chorus Line_ emerged from recorded group therapy-style sessions Michael Bennett conducted with "gypsies" – those who sing and dance in support of the leading players – from the Broadway community. From hundreds of hours of tapes, James Kirkwood Jr. and Nick Dante fashioned a book about an audition for a musical, incorporating many real-life stories from the sessions; some who attended the sessions eventually played variations of themselves or each other in the show. With music by Marvin Hamlisch and lyrics by Edward Kleban, _A Chorus Line_ first opened at Joseph Papp's Public Theater in lower Manhattan. What initially had been planned as a limited engagement eventually moved to the Shubert Theatre on Broadway[92] for a run of 6,137 performances, becoming the longest-running production in Broadway history up to that time. The show swept the Tony Awards and won the Pulitzer Prize, and its hit song, _What I Did for Love_, became a standard.[93]

Broadway audiences welcomed musicals that varied from the golden age style and substance. John Kander and Fred Ebb explored the rise of Nazism in Germany in _Cabaret_, and murder and the media in Prohibition-era _Chicago_, which relied on old vaudeville techniques. _Pippin_, by Stephen Schwartz, was set in the days of Charlemagne. Federico Fellini's autobiographical film _8½_ became Maury Yeston's _Nine_. At the end of the decade, _Evita_ and _Sweeney Todd_ were precursors of the darker, big budget musicals of the 1980s that depended on dramatic stories, sweeping scores and spectacular effects. At the same time, old-fashioned values were still embraced in such hits as _Annie_, _42nd Street_, _My One and Only_, and popular revivals of _No, No, Nanette_ and _Irene_. Although many film versions of musicals were made in the 1970s, few were critical or box office successes, with the notable exceptions of _Fiddler on the Roof_, _Cabaret_ and _Grease_.[94]

1980s

]] The 1980s saw the influence of European "megamusicals", or "pop operas", on Broadway, in the West End and elsewhere. These typically featured a pop-influenced score, had large casts and sets and were identified by their notable effects – a falling chandelier (in _The Phantom of the Opera_), a helicopter landing on stage (in _Miss Saigon_) – and big budgets. Many were based on novels or other works of literature. The most important writers of mega-musicals include the French team of Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil, responsible for _Les Misérables_, whose London production became the longest-running musical in West End and Broadway history. The team, in collaboration with Richard Maltby Jr., produced another hit with _Miss Saigon_, which was inspired by the Puccini opera _Madama Butterfly_.

The British composer Andrew Lloyd Webber saw similar success with _Evita_, based on the life of Argentina's Eva Perón; _Cats_, derived from the poems of T. S. Eliot (both of which musicals originally starred Elaine Paige); _Starlight Express_, performed on roller skates; _The Phantom of the Opera_, derived from the Gaston Leroux novel, "Le Fantôme de l'Opéra"; and _Sunset Boulevard_ (from the classic film of the same name). These works ran (or are still running) for decades in both New York and London and had extraordinary international and touring success. The megamusicals' huge budgets redefined expectations for financial success on Broadway and in the West End. In earlier years, it was possible for a show to be considered a hit after a run of several hundred performances, but with multimillion-dollar production costs, a show must run for years simply to turn a profit.

1990s

]] In the 1990s, a new generation of theatrical composers emerged, including Jason Robert Brown and Michael John LaChiusa, who began with productions Off-Broadway. The most conspicuous success of these artists was Jonathan Larson's show _Rent_ (1996), a rock musical (based on the opera _La bohème_) about a struggling community of artists in Manhattan. While the cost of tickets to Broadway and West End musicals was escalating beyond the budget of many theatregoers, _Rent_ was marketed to increase the popularity of musicals among a younger audience. It featured a young cast and a heavily rock-influenced score; the musical became a hit. Its young fans, many of them students, calling themselves RENTheads], camped out at the Nederlander Theatre in hopes of winning the lottery for $20 front row tickets, and some saw the show dozens of times. Other shows on Broadway followed _Rent_'s lead by offering heavily discounted day-of-performance or standing-room tickets, although often the discounts are offered only to students.[95]

The 1990s also saw the influence of large corporations on the production of musicals. The most important has been Disney Theatrical Productions, which began adapting some of Disney's animated film musicals for the stage, starting with _Beauty and the Beast_ (1994), _The Lion King_ (1997) and _Aida_ (2000), the latter two with music by Elton John. _The Lion King_ is the highest-grossing musical in Broadway history.[96] _The Who's Tommy_ (1993), a theatrical adaptation of the rock opera _Tommy_, achieved a healthy run of 899 performances but was criticized for sanitizing the story and "musical theatre-izing" the rock music.[97]

Despite the growing number of large-scale musicals in the 1980s and 1990s, a number of lower-budget, smaller-scale musicals managed to find critical and financial success, such as _Falsettoland_ and _Little Shop of Horrors_, _Bat Boy: The Musical_ and _Blood Brothers_. The topics of these pieces vary widely, and the music ranges from rock to pop, but they often are produced off-Broadway, or for smaller London theatres, and some of these stagings have been regarded as imaginative and innovative.[98]

2000s–2010s

Trends

In the new century, familiarity has been embraced by producers and investors anxious to guarantee that they recoup their considerable investments. Some took (usually modest-budget) chances on new and creative material, such as _Urinetown_ (2001), _Avenue Q_ (2003), _The Light in the Piazza_ (2005), _Spring Awakening_ (2006), _In the Heights_ (2007), _Next to Normal_ (2009), _American Idiot_ (2010) and _The Book of Mormon_ (2011). _Hamilton_ (2015), transformed "under-dramatized American history" into an unusual hip-hop inflected hit.[99] In 2011, Sondheim argued that of all forms of "contemporary pop music", rap was "the closest to traditional musical theatre" and was "one pathway to the future."[100]

However, most major-market 21st-century productions have taken a safe route, with revivals of familiar fare, such as _Fiddler on the Roof_, _A Chorus Line_, _South Pacific_, _Gypsy_, _Hair_, _West Side Story_ and _Grease_, or with adaptations of other proven material, such as literature (_The Scarlet Pimpernel_, _Wicked_ and _Fun Home_), hoping that the shows would have a built-in audience as a result. This trend is especially persistent with film adaptations, including (_The Producers_, _Spamalot_, _Hairspray_, _Legally Blonde_, _The Color Purple_, _Xanadu_, _Billy Elliot_, _Shrek_, _Waitress_ and _Groundhog Day_).[101] Some critics have argued that the reuse of film plots, especially those from Disney (such as _Mary Poppins_ and _The Little Mermaid_), equate the Broadway and West End musical to a tourist attraction, rather than a creative outlet.[102]

'' meets President Obama in 2015]] Today, it is less likely that a sole producer, such as David Merrick or Cameron Mackintosh, backs a production. Corporate sponsors dominate Broadway, and often alliances are formed to stage musicals, which require an investment of $10 million or more. In 2002, the credits for _Thoroughly Modern Millie_ listed ten producers, and among those names were entities composed of several individuals.[103] Typically, off-Broadway and regional theatres tend to produce smaller and therefore less expensive musicals, and development of new musicals has increasingly taken place outside of New York and London or in smaller venues. For example, _Spring Awakening_, _Fun Home_ and _Hamilton_ were developed Off-Broadway before being launched on Broadway.

Several musicals returned to the spectacle format that was so successful in the 1980s, recalling extravaganzas that have been presented at times, throughout theatre history, since the ancient Romans staged mock sea battles. Examples include the musical adaptations of _Lord of the Rings_ (2007), _Gone with the Wind_ (2008) and _Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark_ (2011). These musicals involved songwriters with little theatrical experience, and the expensive productions generally lost money. Conversely, _The Drowsy Chaperone_, _Avenue Q_, _The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee_, _Xanadu_ and _Fun Home_, among others, have been presented in smaller-scale productions, mostly uninterrupted by an intermission, with short running times, and enjoyed financial success. In 2013, _Time_ magazine reported that a trend Off-Broadway has been "immersive" theatre, citing shows such as _Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812_ (2012) and _Here Lies Love_ (2013) in which the staging takes place around and within the audience.[104] The shows set a joint record, each receiving 11 nominations for Lucille Lortel Awards,[105] and feature contemporary scores.[106][107]

In 2013, Cyndi Lauper was the "first female composer to win the [Tony for] Best Score without a male collaborator" for writing the music and lyrics for _Kinky Boots_. In 2015, for the first time, an all-female writing team, Lisa Kron and Jeanine Tesori, won the Tony Award for Best Original Score (and Best Book for Kron) for _Fun Home_,[108] although work by male songwriters continues to be produced more often.[109]

Jukebox musicals

Another trend has been to create a minimal plot to fit a collection of songs that have already been hits. Following the earlier success of _Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story_, these have included _Movin' Out_ (2002, based on the tunes of Billy Joel), _Jersey Boys_ (2006, The Four Seasons), _Rock of Ages_ (2009, featuring classic rock of the 1980s) and many others. This style is often referred to as the "jukebox musical".[110] Similar but more plot-driven musicals have been built around the canon of a particular pop group including _Mamma Mia!_ (1999, based on the songs of ABBA), _Our House_ (2002, based on the songs of Madness) and _We Will Rock You_ (2002, based on the songs of Queen).

Film and TV musicals

Live-action film musicals were nearly dead in the 1980s and early 1990s, with exceptions of _Victor/Victoria_, _Little Shop of Horrors_ and the 1996 film of _Evita_.[111] In the new century, Baz Luhrmann began a revival of the film musical with _Moulin Rouge!_ (2001). This was followed by _Chicago_ (2002); _Phantom of the Opera_ (2004); _Rent_ (2005); _Dreamgirls_ (2006); _Hairspray_, _Enchanted_ and _Sweeney Todd_ (all in 2007); _Mamma Mia!_ (2008); _Nine_ (2009); _Les Misérables_ and _Pitch Perfect_ (both in 2012), _Into The Woods_ and _The Last Five Years_ (2014) and _La La Land_ (2016), among others. Dr. Seuss's _How the Grinch Stole Christmas!_ (2000) and _The Cat in the Hat_ (2003), turned children's books into live-action film musicals. After the immense success of Disney and other houses with animated film musicals beginning with _The Little Mermaid_ in 1989 and running throughout the 1990s (including some more adult-themed films, like _South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut_ (1999)), fewer animated film musicals were released in the first decade of the 21st century.[112] The genre made a comeback beginning in 2010 with _Tangled_ (2010), _Rio_ (2011) and _Frozen_ (2013). In Asia, India continues to produce numerous "Bollywood" film musicals, and Japan produces "Anime" and "Manga" film musicals.

Made for TV musical films were popular in the 1990s, such as _Gypsy_ (1993), _Cinderella_ (1997) and _Annie_ (1999). Several made for TV musicals in the first decade of the 21st century were adaptations of the stage version, such as _South Pacific_ (2001), _The Music Man_ (2003) and _Once Upon a Mattress_ (2005), and a televised version of the stage musical _Legally Blonde_ in 2007. Additionally, several musicals were filmed on stage and broadcast on Public Television, for example _Contact_ in 2002 and _Kiss Me, Kate_ and _Oklahoma!_ in 2003. The made-for-TV musical _High School Musical_ (2006), and its several sequels, enjoyed particular success and were adapted for stage musicals and other media.

In 2013, NBC began a series of live television broadcasts of musicals with _The Sound of Music Live!_[113] Although the production received mixed reviews, it was a ratings success.[114] Further broadcasts have included _Peter Pan Live!_ (NBC 2014), _The Wiz Live!_ (NBC 2015),[115] a UK broadcast, _The Sound of Music Live_ (ITV 2015)[116] _Grease: Live_ (Fox 2016),[117][118] _A Christmas Story Live!_ (Fox, 2017),[119] and _Rent: Live_ (Fox 2019).[120]

Some television shows have set episodes as a musical. Examples include episodes of _Ally McBeal_, _Xena: Warrior Princess_ ("The Bitter Suite" and "Lyre, Lyre, Heart's On Fire"), _Psych_ ("Psych: The Musical"), _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ ("Once More, with Feeling"), _That's So Raven_, _Daria_, _Dexter's Laboratory_, _The Powerpuff Girls_, _The Flash_, _Once Upon a Time_, _Oz_, _Scrubs_ (one episode was written by the creators of _Avenue Q_), _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_ ("Mayhem of the Music Meister") and _That '70s Show_ (the 100th episode, "That '70s Musical"). Others have included scenes where characters suddenly begin singing and dancing in a musical-theatre style during an episode, such as in several episodes of _The Simpsons_, _30 Rock_, _Hannah Montana_, _South Park_, _Bob's Burgers_ and _Family Guy_. The television series _Cop Rock_ extensively used the musical format, as do the series _Flight of the Conchords_, _Glee_, _Smash_ and _Crazy Ex-Girlfriend_.

There have also been musicals made for the internet, including _Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog,_ about a low-rent super-villain played by Neil Patrick Harris. It was written during the WGA writer's strike.[121] Since 2006, reality TV shows have been used to help market musical revivals by holding a talent competition to cast (usually female) leads. Examples of these are _How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?_, _Grease: You're the One That I Want!,_ _Any Dream Will Do,_ _Legally Blonde: The Musical – The Search for Elle Woods,_ _I'd Do Anything_ and _Over the Rainbow._


International musicals

in a 1930 performance of "Parisette"]] The U.S. and Britain were the most active sources of book musicals from the 19th century through much of the 20th century (although Europe produced various forms of popular light opera and operetta, for example Spanish Zarzuela, during that period and even earlier). However, the light musical stage in other countries has become more active in recent decades.

Musicals from other English-speaking countries (notably Australia and Canada) often do well locally and occasionally even reach Broadway or the West End (e.g., _The Boy from Oz_ and _The Drowsy Chaperone_). South Africa has an active musical theatre scene, with revues like _African Footprint_ and _Umoja_ and book musicals, such as _Kat and the Kings_ and _Sarafina!_ touring internationally. Locally, musicals like _Vere_, _Love and Green Onions_, _Over the Rainbow: the all-new all-gay... extravaganza_ and _Bangbroek Mountain_ and _In Briefs – a queer little Musical_ have been produced successfully.

Successful musicals from continental Europe include shows from (among other countries) Germany (_Elixier_ and _Ludwig II_), Austria (_Tanz der Vampire_, _Elisabeth_, _Mozart!_ and _Rebecca_), Czech Republic (_Dracula_), France (_Notre-Dame de Paris_, _Les Misérables_, _Roméo et Juliette_ and _Mozart, l'opéra rock_) and Spain (_Hoy no me puedo levantar_ and _The Musical Sancho Panza_).

Japan has recently seen the growth of an indigenous form of musical theatre, both animated and live action, mostly based on Anime and Manga, such as _Kiki's Delivery Service_ and _Tenimyu_. The popular _Sailor Moon_ metaseries has had twenty-nine Sailor Moon musicals, spanning thirteen years. Beginning in 1914, a series of popular revues have been performed by the all-female Takarazuka Revue, which currently fields five performing troupes. Elsewhere in Asia, the Indian Bollywood musical, mostly in the form of motion pictures, is tremendously successful.[122]

Beginning with a 2002 tour of _Les Misérables_, various Western musicals have been imported to mainland China and staged in English.[123] Attempts at localizing Western productions in China began in 2008 when _Fame_ was produced in Mandarin with a full Chinese cast at the Central Academy of Drama in Beijing.[124] Since then, other western productions have been staged in China in Mandarin with a Chinese cast. The first Chinese production in the style of Western musical theatre was _The Gold Sand_ in 2005.[125] In addition, Li Dun, a well-known Chinese producer, produced _Butterflies_, based on a classic Chinese love tragedy, in 2007 as well as _Love U Teresa_ in 2011.[126]


Amateur and school productions

' teen _Thoroughly Modern Millie_, 2009]] Musicals are often presented by amateur and school groups in churches, schools and other performance spaces.[127][128] Although amateur theatre has existed for centuries, even in the New World,[129] François Cellier and Cunningham Bridgeman wrote, in 1914, that prior to the late 19th century, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals. After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies licensed to perform the Savoy operas, professionals recognized that the amateur societies "support the culture of music and the drama. They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites."[130] The National Operatic and Dramatic Association was founded in the UK in 1899. It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 amateur dramatic societies were producing Gilbert and Sullivan works in Britain that year.[131] Similarly, more than 100 community theatres were founded in the US in the early 20th century. This number has grown to an estimated 18,000 in the US.[132] The Educational Theater Association in the US has nearly 5,000 member schools.[133]

'' on Broadway]] The Broadway League announced that in the 2007–08 season, 12.27 million tickets were purchased for Broadway shows for a gross sale amount of almost a billion dollars.[134] The League further reported that during the 2006–07 season, approximately 65% of Broadway tickets were purchased by tourists, and that foreign tourists were 16% of attendees.[135] The Society of London Theatre reported that 2007 set a record for attendance in London. Total attendees in the major commercial and grant-aided theatres in Central London were 13.6 million, and total ticket revenues were £469.7 million.[136] Also, the international musicals scene has been particularly active in recent years. Stephen Sondheim commented in the year 2000:

However, noting the success in recent decades of original material, and creative re-imaginings of film, plays and literature, theatre historian John Kenrick countered:

  Is the Musical dead? ... Absolutely not! Changing? Always! The musical has been changing ever since Offenbach did his first rewrite in the 1850s. And change is the clearest sign that the musical is still a living, growing genre. Will we ever return to the so-called 'golden age', with musicals at the center of popular culture? Probably not. Public taste has undergone fundamental changes, and the commercial arts can only flow where the paying public allows.[137]
