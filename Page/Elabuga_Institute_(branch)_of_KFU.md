ELABUGA INSTITUTE (BRANCH) OF KFU (Kazan (Volga region) Federal University) is a state educational institution of higher professional education of the Russian Federation.


History

Elabuga Institute of KFU was established on the foundation of Elabuga State Pedagogical University in 2011.[1]

Its history goes back to the 19th century and can be divided into several periods: the pre-Soviet time period, the Soviet time period, and the modern period.

Pre-Soviet period

A new educational institution was established in Vaytskaya Province in 1898. The Elabuga merchant Glafira F. Stakheeva subscribed to the building of the Diocesan School for Girls in memory of her husband.

  Thinking about the needs of the Orthodox clergy of the Prikamskiy Territory I made up my mind to try and solicit for a theological seminary to be established in Elabuga since it is a main town for 5 districts and 3 provinces – Vaytskaya Province, Ufa Province, and Kazan Province....[2]

Elabuzhskoe_eparhialnoe_zhenskoe_uchilishe,_1890-e.jpg The idea of G. F. Stakheeva, in general, received the approval of the Eparchy Assembly, nevertheless the Holy Synod gave permission for the foundation not of a seminary but of the Eparchy School for girls. The building was designed by a first grade architect of the Vyatka province I. A. Charushin. The building was constructed by an architect and artist A. I. Gorokhov. The construction of the building lasted for four years and was finished by August 15, 1903.[3]

The girls of the Eparchy School were taught the basic sciences, religion, etiquette, foreign languages and music. After graduation girls received the status of a home teacher. Attendance of extra classes of the departments of history, physics and mathematics allowed the graduates to become Church school teachers or Eparchy school teachers. Before the October Revolution the Eparchy School has prepared several hundreds of teachers.[4]

Soviet period

In 1918, the Eparchy School was closed, the same year the Tatar teacher's seminary was opened here. Later, by the decision of the People's Commissariat, Yelabuga Tatar teachers' seminary was transformed into a three-year teacher training courses for the representatives of different national and ethnic groups. Since that time the Russian as well as Mari, Udmurt and Tatar pedagogical courses functioned there.

In August 1923 the Board of Tatar pedagogical courses renamed them into Yelabuga Tatar Pedagogical College. The structure of it constantly expanded and in 1930 it became the Russian-Tatar Pedagogical College (Tekhnicum)

Simultaneously primary school teachers were trained in the college where in 1931–1932 correspondence department was opened.

In 1935 a library department was established within the college which later (in 1937) separated as an independent school.

In 1936–1937 Yelabuga Tatar Pedagogical College was transformed into the Teacher Training College.

In 1939, according to the Decree of the USSR Government the Teachers' Training Institute was founded on the basis of the former Pedagogical College aimed at preparation of qualified middle school teachers.

The students from the nearest 12 districts of the Udmurt and Tatar ASSR were admitted into four faculties: history, physics and mathematics, philology, natural geography.

During World War II, Voronezh University, some laboratories of Leningrad University as well as a branch of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR were evacuated to Yelabuga. They all were housed in the building of Yelabuga Teachers' Training Institute

22 professors, 25 associate professors worked at the institute during the war. During this period such famous figures of sciences as academician V. I. Smirnov, academician V. A. Fok, future academician V. A. Ambartsumyan, professor V. V. Mavrodin, professor S. I. Kovalyov and others worked here. The first Tatar female — Candidate of Philology M. G. Faizulina began to work in Elabuga in 1941.

During the post war years the teachers' institutes lost their value in connection with a broad development of secondary education and increase of requirements to the level of teachers' qualification. The Elabuga state teacher training institute was formed on the basis of the Elabuga teachers' institute by the resolution of Council of Ministers of RSFSR of August 19, 1952.

Since April 1, 1953, the enrollment of students on two faculties was announced: physical-mathematical and philological. 150 students were accepted for the first course. The next year the correspondence department was opened where 200 students were accepted.

The institute quickly grew, forming the new faculties: pedagogics and techniques of primary education (1959), foreign languages (1965), technical (1975) – the unique faculty during this period in the Volga region – and some others.

Since December, 1973 the 8-month preparatory department was opened at the institute, the main objective of which consisted in preparation working and rural youth for admission to the institute. Thanks to it in 1973 ESTI was regarded by the Ministry of national education of RSFSR as the higher educational institution of the second category, and in 1986 — the first category.

In 1982, for achievements in teacher training ESTI was handed the challenge Red Banner of the Ministry of Education of the USSR and the Central Committee of trade union educators, higher education and research institutions.[5]

Present

In 2003 the higher educational institution received the new status and was transformed to the Elabuga state pedagogical university.

The structure of university included 2 institutes (the Institute of additional professional education and the Institute of technology, economy and service), 9 faculties (history and law, Russian philology and journalism, physical and mathematical, foreign languages, Tatar and comparative philology, biological, psychology and pedagogics, physical culture, natural humanities); the postgraduate courses were opened on several specialties.

On February 2, 2011, ESTU was attached to the Kazan (Volga) federal university[6]

Till January 22, 2013, the official abbreviated name of higher educational institution was FSAEI HPE of KFU branch in Elabuga.[7] The Elabuga institute of KFU continues pedagogical traditions and is one of the leading scientific and educational centers in Lower Kama.
