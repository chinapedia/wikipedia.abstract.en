DUNBAR ROVERS FC is a semi-professional Australian association football club that plays in First Grade, Under 20s and Under 18s of the National Premier Leagues New South Wales 3 competition.[1] The club also participates in the NPL boys youth competitions (Under 13, 14, 15, 16) and has teams in Girls Conference League (Under 14, 15, 17).

Dunbar is one of the only elite level football clubs in NSW offering fee free football. They have been recognised by a number of bodies for doing this such as The Australian Sports Foundation.[2][3]

This has been achieved through fostering community relations to gain sponsors for their players to cover all necessary costs. It also means that they don't pay their first graders unlike other clubs.[4]

This move by the club has created a knock on effect with other clubs such as Western Sydney Wanderers also making their academies fee free.[5]
