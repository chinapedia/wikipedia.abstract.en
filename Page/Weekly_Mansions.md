_WEEKLY MANSIONS_ is the thirty-fifth studio album by Omar Rodríguez-López as a solo artist, released on 4 November 2016. It is his ninth release in the 12 album series initiated by Ipecac Recordings.[1]

Co-written between Omar and his brother Marcel, _Weekly Mansions_ is described as "an eclectic exploration of neo-electro-dance".[2] This is one of the few Rodriguez-Lopez's albums to not feature any guitar whatsoever. The title likely references the Japanese hotel chain where the bulk of this album was recorded.

"Metallic Sweating for the Rich" contains the original track used as the outro to "Piedras y Ansiedad" from 2010's _Tychozorente_. "Disheartening Envelope" is an extended version of "Células Hermosas", previously released on _Octopus Kool Aid_, elements of which were present throughout _Tychozorente_ as well. "Want, Need, Scream in a Dream" is an extended version of an intro to The Mars Volta's song from _Noctourniquet_ - "Zed And Two Naughts".

"Science Urges" was uploaded in advance as the album's single.
