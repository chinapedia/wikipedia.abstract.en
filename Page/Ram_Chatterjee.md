RAM CHATTERJEE (1922â€“1986) was an Indian politician. He won the Tarakeswar constituency seat in the 1967, 1969, 1971, 1977 and 1982 elections.[1]


Before politics

Born in 1922 in Chinsurah, Chatterjee grew up amidst poverty.[2] His father died during his school years, and he had to leave school before finishing Class VII.[3] During a long period Chatterjee was unemployed.[4] He lived in Chinsurah and Chandannagar.[5] As of 1949 he was leading a gang of _goondas_ in Chandannagar, running extortion and protection rackets.[6] Chatterjee was unofficially protected by the Council of Administration of Chandannagar, a fact that allowed him to continue his operations.[7]


1950 riots

Chatterjee was hired at the Eastern Railways.[8] He was involved in the 1950 communal riots, and during the riots he started a grouping called 'Bhabani Dal' in Chandannagar.[9] These were the largest incidents of communal violence in Chandannagar.[10] Chatterjee was arrested on March 31, 1950 under the Preventive Detention Act. He was released after three weeks of custody.[11] On September 1, 1951 he was again arrested under the Preventive Detention Act.[12] He remained in detention until July 28, 1952.[13]


In Forward Bloc

Upon his release Chatterjee joined the Forward Bloc (Marxist Group).[14] He was arrested in January 1953, and was released on June 22, 1953.[15] Chatterjee belonged to the group of FB(MG) leaders that were expelled from the party after having supported the Communist Party of India candidate in the 1953 Calcutta South East by-election.[16] Along with the other expellees, he formed the Marxist Forward Bloc in April the following year.[17]

Chatterjee took part in the 1958 food movement.[18] He was arrested on September 15, 1958 and was detained for a week.[19]


United Front

In 1969 Chatterjee was named Minister for Sports in the second United Front government formed in West Bengal.[20] On June 22, 1969 Chatterjee charged into the exclusive Calcutta Swimming Club, an institution predominately serving Europeans, along with about a hundred Santhal tribals.[21][22][23][24]

Chatterjee lost his assembly seat in the 1972 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election.[25]


Left Front

Chatterjee regained his Tarakeswar seat in the 1977 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election.[26] Chatterjee was named Minister of State Home (Civil Defense) Department in the Left Front government formed in West Bengal in 1977.[27][28]

Chatterjee died in 1986.[29][30] His widow contested the Tarakeswar seat after his death.[31] After Chatterjee's death his party suffered an internal feud and was severely weakened in its Hooghly District bastion.[32] It would take another 10 years before the MFB had a minister in the West Bengal government.[33]
