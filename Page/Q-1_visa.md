The Q-1 VISA is a non-immigrant visa which allows travel to United States to participate in a cultural exchange program. The purpose of the program is to allow for practical training and employment, and the sharing of history, culture, and traditions.[1]

Roughly 2,000 Q-1 visas have been issued in each fiscal year from 2014 to 2018.[2]

Participants must be 18 years or older and be able to communicate effectively regarding elements of their culture.[3] The duration of stay may be up to 15 months, and participants must then remain outside the US for a period of one year before they may be admitted under a different visa type.[4]

The Q-1 visa is similar to the J-1 visa, except that J-1 cultural exchange programs must be designated by the US Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.[5]
