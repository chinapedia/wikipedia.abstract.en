JANUSZ ANDRZEJ ZAJDEL (15 August 1938 – 19 July 1985) was a Polish science fiction author, second in popularity in Poland to Stanisław Lem.[1][2] His major genres were social science fiction and dystopia. His main recurring theme involved the gloomy prospects for a space environment into which mankind carried totalitarian ideas and habits: Red Space Republics, or Space Labor Camps, or both. His heroes desperately try to find meaning in the world around them.

His works include five social-science fiction novels: _Cylinder van Troffa_ (_Van Troff's Cylinder_, 1980); _Limes inferior_ (_The Lower Limit_, 1982); _Cała prawda o planecie Ksi_ (_The Whole Truth about Planet Xi_, 1983); _Wyjście z cienia_ (_Coming out of the Shadow_, 1983); and _Paradyzja_ (_Paradise: World in Orbit_, 1984).[3]

The Polish science fiction fandom award was named after him: the Janusz A. Zajdel Award. He was a trustee of World SF.[4]


Life

Janusz Zajdel was born 15 August 1938 in Warsaw, Poland.[5] He studied physics at the University of Warsaw. After graduating, he worked many years as a radiological engineer and an expert on nuclear physics at the Central Laboratory of Radiological Protection in Poland.[6] He published a number of academic works, handbooks of safety regulations, and educational texts.[7][8]

In his spare time, he popularized science by writing science fiction.[9] With his brother, he started a column in a Polish magazine for young people interested in science and engineering, __ (_Young Technician_), in which they proposed various futuristic gadgets.[10] In 1961 _Młody Technik_ published Zajdel's science-fiction debut, the short story "_Tau Ceti_" ().[11] Other stories by him soon appeared in several other Polish magazines.[12]

His science-fiction book-writing career began in 1965 with the publication of a short-story anthology, _Jad mantezji_ (_The Venom of Mantesia_), which included stories from _Młody Technik_ and some others that had already appeared a year earlier in another anthology.[13][14] By 1982 he had published four more collections: _Przejście przez lustro_ (Through the Mirror, 1975); _Iluzyt_ (1976); _Feniks_ (The Phoenix, 1981); and _Ogon diabła_ (The Devil's Tail, 1982).[15]

His first novel, _Lalande 21185_, appeared in 1966, a year after his first short-story anthology, and was geared toward young adults.[16] His first serious science-fiction novel was a "first contact"-type SF mystery, __ (Right of Return, 1975); but it was his novels of the late 1970s and early 1980s — _Cylinder van Troffa_ (Van Troff's Cylinder, 1980); _Limes inferior_ (The Lower Limit, 1982); _Cała prawda o planecie Ksi_ (The Whole Truth about Planet Xi, 1983); __ (Out of the Shadows, 1983); and _Paradyzja_ (Paradise: World in Orbit, 1984) — that earned him a reputation as one of the most important Polish science-fiction writers.[17][18]

He was an active member of Polish and international science fiction fandom, and a Trustee of World SF.[19][20] In the 1980s he was an active supporter of the Polish Solidarity movement.[21]

On 19 July 1985 he died of lung cancer, after three years' struggle against the disease.[22][23]


Themes

Zajdel's early works, from the 1960s and early 1970s, focuses on scientific inventions and their role in space exploration, alien contact or artificial intelligence.[24][25] As his writing career continued, however, his stories evolved to focus on the social aspects and often negative consequences of those inventions.[26] Over time, a theme became increasingly visible in his works - a concern over dangers inherent in attempts to control the human society.[27] He is also condemning human ignorance, warning against xenophobia, and asking philosophical questions about the nature of the universe, happiness and human destiny.[28] Zajdel's works from his second period - late 1970s and 1980s - and represent the genres of social and dystopian fiction.[29] In his works, he envisions totalitarian states and societies living under extreme forms of mass surveillance.[30]

His works are also recognized as being a critique of the totalitarian, communist state, a reality of his life in People's Republic of Poland. Science fiction genre, with its outer-worldly, clearly fictional, and often allegorical setting and invented jargon was able to debate fundamentals of such systems with frankness that more mainstream literature would not be allowed to.[31]


Importance

Zajdel has been described as the second science fiction writer in popularity in Poland after Stanisław Lem. [32] He has also been described as the writer who replaced Lem as the "top Polish SF writer", after "Lem vacated [this position] earlier of his own volition".[33]

He is recognized as an originator of the social science fiction genre in Polish science fiction, known in Poland as the sociological speculative fiction (_fantastyka socjologiczna_).[34][35][36] He has been an inspiration to a number of younger Polish science fiction authors such as Maciej Parowski and Marek Oramus.[37]

His works have been translated into Belorussian, Bulgarian, Czech, Esperanto, Finnish, German, Hungarian, Russian and Slovenian.[38] Almost none of his works have been translated into English; the only exception is the short story _Wyjątkowo trudny teren_ ("Particularly Difficult Territory") that Zajdel wrote for the English language _Tales from the Planet Earth_ anthology edited by Frederik Pohl and Elizabeth Anne Hull.[39]


Recognition

In 1973 Zajdel received an honorary award Magnum Trophaeum from the _Młody Technik_ (_Young Technician_) magazine for long-term cooperation.[40] In 1980 Zajdel was recipient of the Polish Ministry of Culture and Arts Award for _Van Troff's Cylinder_.[41] Zajdel also received the Golden Sepulka Award two times: for _Limes Inferior_ (1982 novel; 1983 award) and _Wyjście z cienia_ ("Out of the Shadow") (1983 novel; 1984 award).[42]

In 1984 Polish fantasy and science fiction fandom (associated with the Polish SF convention Polcon) decided to establish an annual award, initially named _Sfinks_ ("Sphynx"). Janusz A. Zajdel became the first winner of this award, for his 1984 novel _Paradyzja_. He won the award posthumously in 1985, shortly after his death, at which time it was decided to rename the award after him, and it became known as the Janusz A. Zajdel Award.[43][44]

Frederik Pohl dedicated the anthology _Tales From The Planet Earth_ to Zajdel and A. Bertram Chandler.[45] This book also contains the English translation of one of Zajdel's short stories, _Particularly Difficult Territory_. It is his only work to have been translated into English to date (as of August 2015).[46]
