ROBERT TABER is an American activist, journalist, and scholar.

Taber traveled to Cuba in the late 1950s as a CBS investigative journalist, accompanying Fidel Castro, Ché Guevara, and their troops, who forced Cuban leader Fulgencio Batista to flee the country. He wrote _M-26: Biography of a Revolution_ (first published by Lyle Stuart in 1961 (ASIN B001P76O1G) about this experience.[1][2]

Batista, who had amassed a personal fortune, first fled to the Dominican Republic then ruled by dictator Rafael Trujillo, who had been a previous military ally of Batista. Batista eventually found political asylum in Portugal, then under the rule of the extreme right-wing António de Oliveira Salazar.

Taber founded the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPFCC), characterized on the record of 1961 United States Senate hearings "as serving to glorify the Castro government and acting as its publicity agent".[3][4]

Taber's best known work is _The War of the Flea: The Classic Study of Guerrilla Warfare_ (/), about "guerrilla insurgencies and their relationship to state power". The book was first published in 1965, and has since been reissued. Its premise has been applied by political writers, strategists and pundits to such embattled locales as Cuba, China, Algeria, Indochina, Northern Ireland, Israel, Cyprus, the Philippines, Malaya, and Greece, among others.[5]
