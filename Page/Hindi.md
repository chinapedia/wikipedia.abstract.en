HINDI (Devanagari: हिन्दी, IAST: _Hindī_), or MODERN STANDARD HINDI (Devanagari: मानक हिन्दी, IAST: _Mānak Hindī_) is a standardised and Sanskritised register[1] of the Hindustani language. Hindi, written in the Devanagari script, is one of the official languages of India, along with the English language.[2] It is one of the 22 scheduled languages of the Republic of India.[3] However, it is not the national language of India because no language was given such a status in the Indian constitution.[4][5]

Hindi is the _lingua franca_ of the _Hindi belt_, and to a lesser extent other parts of India (usually in a simplified or pidginized variety such as Bazaar Hindustani or Haflong Hindi).[6][7] Outside India, several other languages are recognized officially as "Hindi" but do not refer to the Standard Hindi language described here and instead descend from other dialects of Hindustani, such as Awadhi and Bhojpuri. Such languages include _Fiji Hindi_, which is official in Fiji,[8] and Caribbean Hindustani, which is a recognized language in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname.[9][10][11][12] Apart from specialized vocabulary, spoken Hindi is mutually intelligible with standard Urdu, another recognized register of Hindustani.

As a linguistic variety, Hindi is the fourth most-spoken first language in the world, after Mandarin, Spanish and English.[13] Alongside Urdu as Hindustani, it is the third most-spoken language in the world, after Mandarin and English.[14]


Etymology

The term _Hindī_ originally was used to refer to inhabitants of the region east of the Indus. It was borrowed from Classical Persian _Hindī_ (Iranian Persian _Hendi_), meaning "Indian", from the proper noun _Hind_ "India".[15]

The name _Hindavī_ was used by Amir Khusrow in his poetry.[16][17]


History

Like other Indo-Aryan languages, Hindi is a direct descendant of an early form of Vedic Sanskrit, through Sauraseni Prakrit and Śauraseni Apabhraṃśa (from Sanskrit _apabhraṃśa_ "corrupted"), which emerged in the 7th century CE.[18]

Before the standardization of Hindi on the Khariboli dialect, various dialects and languages of the Hindi belt attained prominence through literary standardization, such as Avadhi and Braj Bhasha. Early Hindi literature came about in the 12th and 13th centuries CE. This body of work included the early Rajasthani epics such as renditions of the Dhola Maru, the _Prithviraj Raso_ in Braj Bhasha, and the works of Amir Khusrow in the Khariboli of Delhi.[19][20]

Modern Standard Hindi is based on the Khariboli dialect,[21] the vernacular of Delhi and the surrounding region, which came to replace earlier prestige dialects such as Awadhi, Maithili (sometimes regarded as separate from the Hindi dialect continuum) and Braj. _Urdu_ – another form of Hindustani – acquired linguistic prestige in the later Mughal period (1800s), and underwent significant Persian influence. Modern Hindi and its literary tradition evolved towards the end of the 18th century.[22] In the late 19th century, a movement to further develop Hindi as a standardised form of Hindustani separate from Urdu took form.[23] In 1881, Bihar accepted Hindi as its sole official language, replacing Urdu, and thus became the first state of India to adopt Hindi.[24] Modern Standard Hindi is one of the youngest Indian languages in this regard.

After independence, the government of India instituted the following conventions:

-   standardisation of grammar: In 1954, the Government of India set up a committee to prepare a grammar of Hindi; The committee's report was released in 1958 as _A Basic Grammar of Modern Hindi_.
-   standardisation of the orthography, using the Devanagari script, by the Central Hindi Directorate of the Ministry of Education and Culture to bring about uniformity in writing, to improve the shape of some Devanagari characters, and introducing diacritics to express sounds from other languages.

On 14 September 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India adopted Hindi written in the Devanagari script as the official language of the Republic of India replacing Urdu's previous usage in British India.[25][26][27] To this end, several stalwarts rallied and lobbied pan-India in favor of Hindi, most notably Beohar Rajendra Simha along with Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, Kaka Kalelkar, Maithili Sharan Gupt and Seth Govind Das who even debated in Parliament on this issue. As such, on the 50th birthday of Beohar Rajendra Simha on 14 September 1949, the efforts came to fruition following the adoption of Hindi as the official language.[28] Now, it is celebrated as Hindi Day.[29]

Use outside the Hindi Belt

In Northeast India a pidgin known as Haflong Hindi has developed as a _lingua franca_ for the people living in Haflong, Assam who speak other languages natively.[30] In Arunachal Pradesh, Hindi emerged as a lingua franca among locals who speak over 50 dialects natively.[31]


Status

India

Part XVII of the Indian Constitution deals with the official language of the Indian Commonwealth. Under Article 343, the official languages of the Union has been prescribed, which includes Hindi in Devanagari script and English:

  (1) The official language of the Union shall be Hindi in Devanagari script. The form of numerals to be used for the official purposes of the Union shall be the international form of Indian numerals.[32]
  (2) Notwithstanding anything in clause (1), for a period of fifteen years from the commencement of this Constitution, the English language shall continue to be used for all the official purposes of the Union for which it was being used immediately before such commencement: Provided that the President may, during the said period, by order authorize the use of the Hindi language in addition to the English language and of the Devanagari form of numerals in addition to the international form of Indian numerals for any of the official purposes of the Union.[33]

Article 351 of the Indian constitution states

  It shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure its enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule, and by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages.

It was envisioned that Hindi would become the sole working language of the Union Government by 1965 (per directives in Article 344 (2) and Article 351),[34] with state governments being free to function in the language of their own choice. However, widespread resistance to the imposition of Hindi on non-native speakers, especially in South India (such as the those in Tamil Nadu) led to the passage of the Official Languages Act of 1963, which provided for the continued use of English indefinitely for all official purposes, although the constitutional directive for the Union Government to encourage the spread of Hindi was retained and has strongly influenced its policies.[35]

Article 344 (2b) stipulates that official language commission shall be constituted every ten years to recommend steps for progressive use of Hindi language and imposing restrictions on the use of the English language by the union government. In practice, the official language commissions are constantly endeavouring to promote Hindi but not imposing restrictions on English in official use by the union government.

At the state level, Hindi is the official language of the following Indian states: Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal.[36][37][38] Each may also designate a "co-official language"; in Uttar Pradesh, for instance, depending on the political formation in power, this language is generally Urdu. Similarly, Hindi is accorded the status of official language in the following Union Territories: National Capital Territory, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

National language status for Hindi is a long-debated theme.[39] In 2010, the Gujarat High Court clarified that Hindi is not the national language of India because the constitution does not mention it as such.[40][41][42]

Outside India

Outside Asia, the Awadhi language (A Hindi dialect) with influence from Bhojpuri, Bihari languages, Fijian and English is spoken in Fiji.[43][44] It is an official language in Fiji as per the 1997 Constitution of Fiji,[45] where it referred to it as "Hindustani", however in the 2013 Constitution of Fiji, it is simply called "Fiji Hindi".[46] It is spoken by 380,000 people in Fiji.[47]

Hindi is also spoken by a large population of Madheshis (people having roots in north-India but have migrated to Nepal over hundreds of years) of Nepal. Hindi is quite easy to understand for many Pakistanis, who speak Urdu, which, like Hindi, is part of Hindustani. Apart from this, Hindi is spoken by the large Indian diaspora which hails from, or has its origin from the "Hindi Belt" of India. A substantially large North Indian diaspora lives in countries like the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, South Africa, Fiji and Mauritius, where it is natively spoken at home and among their own Hindustani-speaking communities. Outside India, Hindi speakers are 8 million in Nepal; 863,077 in United States of America;[48][49] 450,170 in Mauritius; 380,000 in Fiji;[50] 250,292 in South Africa; 150,000 in Suriname;[51] 100,000 in Uganda; 45,800 in United Kingdom;[52] 20,000 in New Zealand; 20,000 in Germany; 26,000 in Trinidad and Tobago;[53] 3,000 in Singapore.


Comparison with Modern Standard Urdu

Linguistically, Hindi and Urdu are two registers of the same language and are mutually intelligible.[54] Hindi is written in the Devanagari script and uses more Sanskrit words, whereas Urdu is written in the Perso-Arabic script and uses more Arabic and Persian words. Hindi is the most commonly used official language in India. Urdu is the national language and _lingua franca_ of Pakistan and is one of 22 official languages of India.

The comparison of Hindi and Urdu as separate languages is largely motivated by politics, namely the Indo-Pakistani rivalry.[55]


Script

Hindi is written in the Devanagari script, an abugida. Devanagari consists of 11 vowels and 33 consonants and is written from left to right. Unlike for Sanskrit, Devanagari is not entirely phonetic for Hindi, especially failing to mark schwa dropping in spoken Standard Hindi.[56]

Romanization

The Government of India uses Hunterian transliteration as its official system of writing Hindi in the Latin script. Various other systems also exist, such as IAST, ITRANS and ISO 15919.


Vocabulary

Traditionally, Hindi words are divided into five principal categories according to their etymology:

-   TATSAM (तत्सम "same as that") words: These are words which are spelled the same in Hindi as in Sanskrit (except for the absence of final case inflections).[57] They include words inherited from Sanskrit via Prakrit which have survived without modification (e.g. Hindi नाम _nām_ / Sanskrit नाम _nāma_, "name"; Hindi कर्म _karm_ / Sanskrit कर्म _karma_, "deed, action; karma"),[58] as well as forms borrowed directly from Sanskrit in more modern times (e.g. प्रार्थना _prārthanā_, "prayer").[59] Pronunciation, however, conforms to Hindi norms and may differ from that of classical Sanskrit. Amongst nouns, the _tatsam_ word could be the Sanskrit non-inflected word-stem, or it could be the nominative singular form in the Sanskrit nominal declension.
-   ARDHATATSAM (अर्धतत्सम "semi-tatsama") words: Such words are typically earlier loanwords from Sanskrit which have undergone sound changes subsequent to being borrowed. (e.g. Hindi सूरज _sūraj_ from Sanskrit सूर्य _sūrya_)
-   TADBHAV (तद्भव "born of that") words: These are native Hindi words derived from Sanskrit after undergoing phonological rules (e.g. Sanskrit कर्म _karma_, "deed" becomes Sauraseni Prakrit कम्म _kamma_, and eventually Hindi काम _kām_, "work") and are spelled differently from Sanskrit.[60]
-   DESHAJ (देशज) words: These are words that were not borrowings but do not derive from attested Indo-Aryan words either. Belonging to this category are onomatopoetic words or ones borrowed from local non-Indo-Aryan languages.
-   VIDESHĪ (विदेशी "foreign") words: These include all loanwords from non-indigenous languages. The most frequent source languages in this category are Persian, Arabic, English and Portuguese. Examples are कमेटी _kameṭī_ from English _committee_ and साबुन _sābun_ "soap" from Arabic.

Hindi also makes extensive use of loan translation (calqueing) and occasionally phono-semantic matching of English.[61]

Prakrit

Hindi has naturally inherited a large portion of its vocabulary from Śaurasenī Prākṛt, in the form of _tadbhava_ words. This process usually involves compensatory lengthening of vowels preceding consonant clusters in Prakrit, e.g. Sanskrit _tīkṣṇa_ > Prakrit _tikkha_ > Hindi _tīkhā_.

Sanskrit

Much of Modern Standard Hindi's vocabulary is borrowed from Sanskrit as _tatsam_ borrowings, especially in technical and academic fields. The formal Hindi standard, from which much of the Persian, Arabic and English vocabulary has been replaced by neologisms compounding _tatsam_ words, is called _Śuddh Hindi_ (pure Hindi), and is viewed as a more prestigious dialect over other more colloquial forms of Hindi.

Excessive use of _tatsam_ words sometimes creates problems for native speakers. They may have Sanskrit consonant clusters which do not exist in native Hindi, causing difficulties in pronunciation.[62]

As a part of the process of Sanskritization, new words are coined using Sanskrit components to be used as replacements for supposedly foreign vocabulary. Usually these neologisms are calques of English words already adopted into spoken Hindi. Some terms such as _dūrbhāṣ_ "telephone", literally "far-speech" and _dūrdarśan_ "television", literally "far-sight" have even gained some currency in formal Hindi in the place of the English borrowings _(ṭeli)fon_ and _ṭīvī_.[63]

Persian

Hindi also features significant Persian influence, standardised from spoken Hindustani.[64] Early borrowings, beginning in the mid-12th century, were specific to Islam (e.g. _Muhammad_, _islām_) and so Persian was simply an intermediary for Arabic. Later, under the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire, Persian became the primary administrative language in the Hindi heartland. Persian borrowings reached a heyday in the 17th century, pervading all aspects of life. Even grammatical constructs, namely the izafat, were assimilated into Hindi.[65]

Post-Partition the Indian government advocated for a policy of Sanskritization leading to a marginalization of the Persian element in Hindi. However, many Persian words (e.g. _muśkil_ "difficult", _bas_ "enough", _havā_ "air", _x(a)yāl_ "thought") have remained entrenched in Modern Standard Hindi, and a larger amount are still used in Urdu poetry written in the Devanagari script.

Arabic

Arabic also shows influence in Hindi, often via Persian but sometimes directly.[66]


Media

Literature

Hindi literature is broadly divided into four prominent forms or styles, being _Bhakti_ (devotional – Kabir, Raskhan); _Śṛṇgār_ (beauty – Keshav, Bihari); _Vīgāthā_ (epic); and _Ādhunik_ (modern).

Medieval Hindi literature is marked by the influence of Bhakti movement and the composition of long, epic poems. It was primarily written in other varieties of Hindi, particularly Avadhi and Braj Bhasha, but to a degree also in Khariboli, the basis for Modern Standard Hindi. During the British Raj, Hindustani became the prestige dialect.

_Chandrakanta_, written by Devaki Nandan Khatri in 1888, is considered the first authentic work of prose in modern Hindi.[67] The person who brought realism in the Hindi prose literature was Munshi Premchand, who is considered as the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement. Literary, or _Sāhityik_, Hindi was popularised by the writings of Swami Dayananda Saraswati, Bhartendu Harishchandra and others. The rising numbers of newspapers and magazines made Hindustani popular with the educated people.

The _Dvivedī Yug_ ("Age of Dwivedi") in Hindi literature lasted from 1900 to 1918. It is named after Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, who played a major role in establishing Modern Standard Hindi in poetry and broadening the acceptable subjects of Hindi poetry from the traditional ones of religion and romantic love.

In the 20th century, Hindi literature saw a romantic upsurge. This is known as _Chāyāvād_ (_shadow-ism_) and the literary figures belonging to this school are known as _Chāyāvādī_. Jaishankar Prasad, Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala', Mahadevi Varma and Sumitranandan Pant, are the four major _Chāyāvādī_ poets.

_Uttar Ādhunik_ is the post-modernist period of Hindi literature, marked by a questioning of early trends that copied the West as well as the excessive ornamentation of the _Chāyāvādī_ movement, and by a return to simple language and natural themes.

Internet

The Hindi Wikipedia was the first Indian-language wiki to reach 100,000 articles. Hindi literature, music, and film have all been disseminated via the internet. In 2015, Google reported a 94% increase in Hindi-content consumption year-on-year, adding that 21% of users in India prefer content in Hindi.[68]

Many Hindi newspapers also offer digital editions.
