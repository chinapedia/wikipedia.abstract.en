The LAW SOCIETY OF SASKATCHEWAN is the governing body for lawyers in the Province of Saskatchewan, Canada.


History

The Law Society of Saskatchewan was established in 1907, by the _Legal Professions Act_, following the establishment of the Province of Saskatchewan in 1905. Prior to 1907, lawyers in the province were governed by the 1885 _Legal Profession Ordinance_ of the North-West Territories, of which the successor provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan had been a part.[1]

The Society has generated national interest, since the 1980s, in relation to its regulatory actions against prominent Saskatchewan lawyer Anthony Merchant.

On the occasion of its centenary, the Law Society published _A Century of Integrity: The Law Society of Saskatchewan 1907 to 2007_, by lawyer Iain Mentiplay, Q.C.[2] Mentiplay had been the secretary-treasurer of the Law Society from 1979 to 1991, and then senior counsel and complaints officer from 1992 until his retirement in 1999.[3]
