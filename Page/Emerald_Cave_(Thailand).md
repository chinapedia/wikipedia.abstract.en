EMERALD CAVE (, THAM MORAKOT) is a cave located on the west coast of Koh Muk (also known as Koh Mook) Island, - The paradise island of Koh Muk and emerald cave are part of the Trang Provence, Southern Thailand.

The cave has a narrow 20m long tunnel. The cave can be entered either by swimming or by using a kayak. It is best to see the cave at mid tide, because at low tide there will be no water, hence no 'emerald' on the beach inside.

Outside the cave, there is a lagoon which is surrounded by tropical plants and a beach. The name of the cave is derived from the phenomenon that occurs, when the sun shines on the water, which reflects colored light all over the caveâ€™s wall. This can only be seen between 10.00 am and 2.00 pm.
