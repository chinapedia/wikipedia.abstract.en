WANG JUN YI (Chinese: 王俊懿, born in 1974) is a contemporary Chinese jade sculptor and carving master[1][2][3] who was awarded the title of “Chinese Jade Carving Master” in 2006.[4] He is known for incorporating gold, silver and titanium alloy into jade.[5]

His works have featured at the Louvre,[6] the National Museum of China,[7] the 2010 Beijing Jewellery Show,[8] the Art Institute of Tsinghua[9] and have been the subject of significant auctions at auction houses such as Christie's[10] and Tian Cheng International.[11][12][13]


Life and career

Wang was born in 1974 in Guilin in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.[14] He graduated from a jewellery art school at the age of 16[15] and began sculpting jade around the age of 19.[16]

In 2011, Wang worked with Italian designer Fulvio Maria Scavia to incorporate jade into European jewellery.[17]

In 2012, Wang was the first jade artist to open a solo exhibition at the National Museum of China.[18]

In October 2014, Wang embarked on an international tour[19] which included a special exhibition of 50 of Wang's jadeite artworks at the Louvre from 30 October to 3 November 2014. His works featured as part of a promotion of diplomatic relations and culture between China and France.[20][21][22]


Jade-Carving Philosophy and Style

Wang's aim is to give jade a new look, popularity and appeal[23] by challenging the norms of jade art which, for example, have tended to incorporate traditional elements such as the Chinese zodiac.

Wang's emphasis lies not on how good a material jade is, but on how one might achieve better artistic design with jade.[24]

Wang attributes his emotional connection with jade to the fact that, when Wang was a child, his mother would hide her jade bracelet from Wang by keeping it locked in a drawer. This caused Wang to believe that jade was 'mysterious and forbidden'. This, he says, created in him a hope that one day he would be able to play freely with jade.[25]


Notable Jade Works

Some of Wang's signature works include:

-   Ice Butterflies, a combination of 13 jade pieces resembling butterflies and melting ice.[26][27]
-   Transforming into Butterfly, a butterfly held together by metal threads.[28]
-   The Nile, used for the Louvre exhibition as it resembled the pyramid shape of the museum.[29]
-   The Unlimited Power of Buddhism, a one-meter tall work that combined jade with titanium.[30]
-   "A carved jadeite praying mantis, agate and diamond clip brooch" described by Christie's as a 'very personal interpretation of a universe of _taotie_ masks, dragon and phoenix, salamander and bats emerging from the contrasting qualities and tones of the raw materials' which sold for US$24,799 on 1 June 2005.[31]
-   "Icy lavender jadeite 'miniature buddha' and diamond pendent necklace"[32]

Wang has also announced his intention to make 200 jade butterflies to represent all the countries in the world.[33]
