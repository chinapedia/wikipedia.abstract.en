, also known as was the 16th Emperor of Japan,[1] according to the traditional order of succession.[2]

No firm dates can be assigned to this Emperor's life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 313 to 399.[3]


Legendary narrative

Nintoku is regarded by historians as a "legendary Emperor" of the 5th century.[4] The reign of Emperor Kinmei (A.D.  – 571), the 29th Emperor,[5] is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates;[6] however, the conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kanmu (737–806), the 50th sovereign of the Yamato dynasty.[7]

According to the _Nihon Shoki_, he was the fourth son of Emperor Ōjin and his mother was Nakatsuhime no Mikoto, a great-granddaughter of Emperor Keikō. He was also the father of Emperors Richū, Hanzei, and Ingyō. His name was .

Nintoku's contemporary title would not have been _tennō_, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning "the great king who rules all under heaven". Alternatively, Nintoku might have been referred to as or the "Great King of Yamato".


Events of Nintoku's life

Although the _Nihon Shoki_ states that Nintoku ruled from 313 to 399, modern research suggests those dates are likely inaccurate.[8]

The achievements of Nintoku's reign which are noted in the _Nihon Shoki_ include:

-   constructed a thorn field bank called Naniwa no Horie to prevent a flood in Kawachi plains and for development. It is assumed that this was Japan's first large-scale engineering works undertaking
-   established a thorn field estate under the direct control of the Imperial Court (_mamuta no miyake_)
-   constructed a Yokono bank (horizontal parcel, Ikuno-ku, Osaka-shi)[9]

Nintoku's tomb

NintokuTomb.jpg К_душам.jpg

Daisen Kofun (the largest tomb in Japan) in Sakai, Osaka, is considered to be his final resting place. The actual site of Nintoku's grave is not known.[10]

The Nintoku-ryo tumulus is one of almost 50 tumuli collectively known as "Mozu Kofungun" clustered around the city, and covers the largest area of any tomb in the world. Built in the middle of the 5th century by an estimated 2,000 men working daily for almost 16 years, the Nintoku tumulus, at 486 meters long and with a mound 35 meters high, is twice as long as the base of the famous Great Pyramid of Pharaoh Khufu (Cheops) in Giza.[11]

The Imperial tomb of Nintoku's consort, Iwa-no hime no Mikoto, is said to be located in Saki-cho, Nara City.[12] Both _kofun_-type Imperial tombs are characterized by a keyhole-shaped island located within a wide, water-filled moat. Imperial tombs and mausolea are cultural properties; but they are guarded and administered by the Imperial Household Agency (IHA), which is the government department responsible for all matters relating to the Emperor and his family. According to the IHA, the tombs are more than a mere repository for historical artifacts; they are sacred religious sites. IHA construes each of the Imperial grave sites as sanctuaries for the spirits of the ancestors of the Imperial House.[13]

Nintoku is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (_misasagi_) at Osaka. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as his mausoleum. It is formally named _Mozu no Mimihara no naka no misasagi_.[14]
