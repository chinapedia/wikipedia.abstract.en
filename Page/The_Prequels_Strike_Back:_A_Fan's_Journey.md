The film contains dozens of interviews from film scholars,[1] critics,[2] academics,[3] and _Star Wars_ fans. Notable interviews include film director Kevin Smith, film critic Chris Gore, actor Christian Simpson, music journalist Doug Adams, and Founding Curator of the Joseph Campbell Archives, Dr. Jonathan Young.[4]

Crowdfunded with a modest budget, production took place over a year as interviews were conducted across the country.[5][6][7][8]

Reviews of the film were generally positive by fans and critics alike. Chris Agar of ScreenRant noted the film "is a great watch for Star Wars fans and serves as a refreshing discussion on the prequels,"[12] while Richard Whittaker of _The Austin Chronicle_ praised the film's deconstruction of George Lucas.[13] Geeks of Doom's review noted: "You might be surprised at what you learn, and what you may have missed this entire time."[14] The Star Wars Prequels Appreciation Society called the film "thoughtful," though it doubted the film would change the minds of "hellbent" fans.[15] Many cite the film as playing a significant role in rethinking the legacy of the prequel films.[16]
