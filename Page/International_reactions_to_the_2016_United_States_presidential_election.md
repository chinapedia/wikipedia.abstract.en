"not to be affected by the radicalism of their president, [otherwise they would] suffer from the international isolation because of the reckless policies which is unacceptable to every mind and every religion."

He further criticized Trump's alleged ignorance of Europe in recalling one of his statements at a mid-June rally in Atlanta in which he described Belgium as "a beautiful city".

Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, whose organization Trump has said was "obsolete" during the campaign, said:[208]

  US leadership is as important as ever. Our Alliance has brought together America's closest friends in times of peace and of conflict for almost 70 years. A strong NATO is good for the United States, and good for Europe. We face a challenging new security environment, including hybrid warfare, cyber attacks, the threat of terrorism. NATO has responded with determination to the new security situation. But we have more work to do. And I look forward to meeting Mr. Trump soon, and welcoming him to Brussels for the NATO Summit next year to discuss the way forward.

He added: "NATO's security guarantee is a treaty commitment and all allies have made a solemn commitment to defend each other and this is something which is absolute and unconditioned." He reminded that NATO was part of Operation Enduring Freedom and that NATO "is important both for collective defence in Europe and to provide help and play a role in the fight against international terrorism."[209]


Financial markets

The Mexican peso rallied in the day before the election on speculation Trump would lose over his alleged anti-Mexican comments, while the stock markets of the world also rallied on speculation Clinton would win.[210] The price of gold, in turn, dropped after days of increasing for the same reason.[211]

After the result, the U.S. dollar and stock markets initially sank, especially in the Asia–Pacific region which was open as the result came in. In like measure, traditional safe haven assets such as sovereign bonds and gold were higher. The Mexican peso fell about 13%. Dow Jones futures also fell about 3%.[212] The day after the election, however, the Dow Jones rose 257 points despite the "knee-jerk reaction" of the night before.[213] The Dow Jones continued to rise over the week,[214] and on November 10 it reached a record high,[215] experiencing its best week since 2011.[216] Japan's Nikkei fell by over 6.1%. The price of oil also fell by 2.4%.[217] However, unlike most other global markets, Russia's MICEX rose after the result.[218]

Media

On November 10 the _Toronto Star_ reported that the website of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada crashed when it was flooded with a large increase in traffic on election night. The increase in traffic was said to be 5 times larger than normal, and the percent of requests coming from the United States increased from the normal ten percent to fifty percent of all requests.[220]

North Korea's _Rodong Sinmun_ wrote: "It has burdened the new administration with the difficulty of facing the Juche nuclear state," referring to the North Korean state ideology often translated as "self-reliance." The article did not mention Trump by name, but declared "it was high time" that the U.S. took action to resolve tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The editorial maintained that North Korea would never give up its nuclear weapons and referred to comments made last month by U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who called efforts to denuclearize North Korea a "lost cause." The publication declared Washington plans "an outdated illusion."[221]


Academia

"Oraib Rantawi, head of Al Quds Centre for Political Studies, said Jordan is one of the 'very few' countries that are not worried about who is the US President, as the Kingdom has maintained 'a very stable and wise relationship' with the US administration regardless of who has been in the Oval Office."[222] Mauritian economist Rajiv Seervansingh suggested a Donald Trump administration would have both a direct and an indirect impact on the Mauritian economy and stated:

  Nothing as such will change with Donald Trump being the President of the USA. We mostly deal with the USA via the AGOA. There is no direct threat to our economy. Exportations through the AGOA will continue. We still need to figure out Trump's political and economic policies. If the President-elect decides to scrap the various deals on imports, it will have a negative impact on international trade. Then Mauritius might be affected by this. If the dollar depreciates, exports will suffer as exporters will get less revenue.[223]


Religious

Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury of the Church of England and symbolic head of the Anglican Communion, called for "reconciliation" and he also pledged to "pray for all the people of the United States."[224] Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, offered "heartfelt congratulations" to Trump and a hope that he would bring change to American domestic and foreign policy.[225]
