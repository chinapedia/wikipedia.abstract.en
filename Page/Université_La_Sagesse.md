Universite-la-Sagesse-logo.png The UNIVERSITÉ LA SAGESSE (in Arabic جامعة الحكمة), also known by the accronym ULS is an established academic institute in Lebanon. The university was established according to decree 1947 in 1999.[1] But the university's Higher College of Law goes back to 1875.

The university is associated with Collège de la Sagesse, a Lebanese educational institution founded in 1875[2] that ran a Higher Institute of Law now incorporated in the university. Sagesse also includes a wide network of Lebanese Maronite elementary and secondary schools many of them continuing to study at the university.

But the university runs independently from the Sagesse school programme although it is similarly supervised by the Maronite Catholic Archeparchy of Beirut.
