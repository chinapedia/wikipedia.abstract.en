_BOTH MEMBERS OF THIS CLUB_ is an oil painting by George Bellows. It hangs in the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC. It dates to 1909 and measures .

The Gallery writes, "_Both Members of This Club_ was inspired by the fights Bellows attended at Tom Sharkey's Athletic Club in New York. At the time, public boxing matches were illegal in the city. Private organizations like Sharkey's made prospective fighters temporary members of the "club" on the night of the event to circumvent the law."[1]
