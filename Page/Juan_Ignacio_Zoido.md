The 2012 Andalusian Parliamentary Elections, where the People's Party achieved a plurality of seats for the first time in the history of the autonomous community but failed to secure the presidency, meant a major crisis in the regional branch of the Party. In July that year Zoido, whose condition as mayor of Andalusia's capital and biggest city gave him a big name, was chosen regional chairman of the party at the XIII Regional Congress.[6]

Zoido sought reelection in the 2015 elections, but the PP failed to achieve a majority of the council, and an agreement of the Socialist Party, Participa Sevilla (a list supported by Podemos) and United Left, ousted Zoido.
