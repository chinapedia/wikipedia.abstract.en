The XUDABAO NUCLEAR POWER PLANT is a nuclear power station under construction in Xudabao Village, Haibin County, Xingcheng, Huludao, on the coast of Liaoning Province, in northeast China. It was initially planned to have six 1000-MW AP1000 light water reactors[1], but currently only the first two are still planned and the further 2 units will be VVER-1200s.[2]

China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) owns 70% of the project, along with Datang International Power Generation Co. (20%), and State Development and Investment Corporation (10%). China Nuclear Power Engineering Company (CNPEC) is the general contractor for the project, which is expected to cost some CNY 110 billion ($16 billion).

Work on the site began in 2010, but was suspended for several years after the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. In 2014, the National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA) granted approval for the first two units. In 2016, China Nuclear Industry 22 Construction Company (CNI22), a subsidiary of China Nuclear Engineering and Construction Corporation (CNECC) signed an EPC contract for the first two units.[3]

China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) and Atomstroyexport signed the detailed contract for the construction of two VVER-1200s (Xudabao 3 and 4) on 7 March 2019. Construction of Xudabao 3 will start in October 2021. Commercial operation of both units is expected in 2028.[4]
