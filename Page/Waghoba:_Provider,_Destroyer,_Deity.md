Story

Malaika Vaz travels through the contrast between human emotion and tiger based on a series on incidents which took place in a newly developed sanctuary Umred Karhandla Wildlife Sanctuary, Maharastra, India. The film shows the ground reality of Human Animal Conflict from loss of property and life to social disruptions.

The story moves through three faces, where Waghoba or the tiger goddess is considered as the provider, who becomes the destroyer and finally becomes the Deity. The story ends with showing how changes in the environmental relationship in the society can change the mindset of people and reduce Human Animal Conflict.[4] The film gives an idea how people are choose to be the messengers between common man and Waghoba and the respect people has towards tiger in India.
