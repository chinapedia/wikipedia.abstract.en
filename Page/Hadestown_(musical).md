_HADESTOWN_ is a musical based on the 2010 concept album of the same name by Anaïs Mitchell. It premiered Off-Broadway at New York Theatre Workshop on May 6, 2016 and ran through July 31. Following productions in Edmonton and London, the show premiered in previews on Broadway in March 2019. The show was developed for the stage and directed by Rachel Chavkin.

Like the original concept album, _Hadestown_ tells a version of the ancient Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, where Orpheus goes to the underworld to rescue his fiancée Eurydice.

The Broadway production opened to critical acclaim and received numerous awards and nominations. At the 73rd Tony Awards, _Hadestown_ received a total of 14 nominations (the most for the evening) and won eight of them, including Best Musical.


Synopsis

Act I

In a Great Depression-era inspired post-apocalyptic setting, the musical opens with Hermes, the narrator, entering to introduce each of the characters ("Road to Hell"), followed by the three Fates describing the harsh weather of the setting ("Any Way the Wind Blows"). Orpheus, Hermes's ward, and Eurydice emerge and introduce themselves to each other, and Orpheus asks Eurydice to marry him with some encouragement from Hermes ("Come Home With Me"). Eurydice is doubtful, since they both live in poverty and she wants a life of stability. Orpheus, a musician, persuades her by telling her that he is writing a song that will make spring come again, and they will no longer have to struggle ("Wedding Song").

After an interlude in which Orpheus tells the story of Hades and Persephone ("Epic I"), Persephone enters to celebrate the summertime with Orpheus and Eurydice ("Livin' it Up on Top"). Orpheus makes a toast to Persephone and expresses hope for his future with Eurydice, who reflects on her growing love for Orpheus despite her independence ("All I've Ever Known"). The two promise to stay with each other no matter what hardships they face.

Winter comes, and along with it a train to bring Persephone back to Hadestown – Hades' underground factory – against her wishes. Orpheus and Eurydice watch as Persephone voices her misery at having to return to the factory, while the Fates appear to praise Hadestown's riches. Despite hearing about Hades' harsh treatment of his workers, Eurydice is intrigued ("Way Down Hadestown"). As winter progresses, Orpheus continues to write music while Eurydice urges him to work so they can have food and shelter ("A Gathering Storm"/"Epic II"). At the same time, Hades and Persephone fight about the decline of their own relationship ("Chant").

Hades leaves the factory to find someone who will appreciate the safety and comfort of Hadestown. He comes across Eurydice and asks her to join him in Hadestown ("Hey Little Songbird"). The Fates arrive, and urge Eurydice to put her survival first ("When the Chips are Down"). With Orpheus away working on his music, Eurydice chooses survival and decides to follow Hades to the factory ("Gone, I'm Gone"). When Orpheus returns to look for Eurydice, Hermes tells him that she's gone to Hadestown and tells Orpheus how to get there without the use of Hades' train ("Wait For Me"). Eurydice arrives at Hadestown, and begins her work on the wall surrounding it ("Why We Build the Wall").

Act II

Following an entr'acte where Persephone introduces herself and the band ("Our Lady Of The Underground"), we see Eurydice realizing the true consequences of her choice to come to Hadestown: she can never leave unless Hades chooses to let her go ("Way Down Hadestown (Reprise)"). After signing her contract with Hades, she sings of her regrets ("Flowers").

Orpheus, having made his way to Hadestown following Hermes' directions, finds Eurydice and begs her to come home and marry him. Eurydice and the Fates tell Orpheus that she legally belongs to Hades and can't return without his permission ("Come Home With Me (Reprise)"). Hades arrives, and Orpheus confronts him. Hades asserts that he does own Eurydice, and attempts to chase Orpheus off his property ("Papers"). The Fates surround an exhausted Orpheus and tell him to give up on saving Eurydice ("Nothing Changes"). Orpheus sings of his despair at losing Eurydice, which Persephone overhears ("If It's True"). Touched by Orpheus' music, Persephone tells Hades to let Eurydice go ("How Long"). Hades bitterly offers Orpheus a chance to sing for him ("Chant (Reprise)"). Orpheus sings a version of the song he'd been writing when Eurydice left, reminding Hades of his love for Persephone ("Epic III"). Orpheus and Eurydice affirm their love for each other and once again promise to stay with each other ("Promises"). Hades is affected more by Orpheus' song than he had expected, and the Fates explain his dilemma: if he keeps Eurydice captive, she becomes a martyr, but if he lets her go, then he loses his authoritarian control over the factory – his workers, having heard Orpheus' music, have begun to agitate for their own freedom ("Word to the Wise"). He decides to leave their fate in Orpheus' hands: the couple can leave together, but Orpheus has to lead them out. If he turns to see if Eurydice is following him, she will belong to Hades forever ("His Kiss, the Riot").

Hermes explains Hades' decision to Orpheus and Eurydice. While Hades and Persephone promise to give their relationship another try the next time she returns to Hadestown, Orpheus begins the walk out of Hadestown with Eurydice following him ("Wait for Me (Reprise)"). Orpheus makes it right up until the very end of the journey, when he is overcome with doubt and turns to look for Eurydice – only to see that she's been right behind him all along, thus condemning her to stay in Hadestown forever ("Doubt Comes In").

Hermes, now somber, reflects on the story’s ending; yet he does so via a reprise of the first song, and so begins to tell the story again. In explanation, he remarks that no matter how many times they sing it, people always hope for a happier ending—and that this is the value of continuing to sing the tale, and of Orpheus’s gifts: "[to] make you see how the world could be/in spite of the way that it is.” Thus, he says, the story is indeed “a love song/for anyone who tries" ("Road to Hell (Reprise)"). The show closes with Persephone raising a toast to Orpheus, reiterating the theme of hope despite unhappy circumstances: "Some birds sing when the sun is bright/my praise is not for them/but the one who sings in the dead of night/I raise my cup to him" ("I Raise My Cup").

Production history

_Hadestown_ was performed as a stage production in Anaïs Mitchell's home state of Vermont several times in 2006 and 2007 prior to the 2010 album release.[1] Mitchell described the first incarnation of the show as "a D.I.Y. theatre project." The creative team included primary orchestrator/arranger Michael Chorney and original director/designer Ben T. Matchstick, as well as a cast drawn from local artists in Vermont.[2][3]

In her search for a director, Mitchell sought out Rachel Chavkin in 2012 after watching a production of _Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812_ directed by Chavkin. In the transition from concept album to stage musical, Mitchell wrote an additional 15 songs and added dialogue to clarify the story line and deepen characterization.The 15 new songs were developed after Mitchell and Chavkin discussed gaps in the album's story line. Michael Chorney created the primary orchestrations and arrangements, with Todd Sickafoose contributing additional/co-arrangements and orchestrations.[4] _Hadestown_ premiered at New York Theatre Workshop for an initial run from May 3 through July 3, 2016, but was later extended due to popular demand through July 31. The production starred Damon Daunno as Orpheus, Nabiyah Be as Eurydice, Amber Gray as Persephone, Patrick Page as Hades, Chris Sullivan as Hermes, and Lulu Fall, Jessie Shelton, and Shaina Taub as the Fates.[5][6]

On October 14, 2016, an EP was released featuring four songs from the musical, recorded live on June 28 and 29, 2016.[7] A full live album was released on October 6, 2017.[8]

_Hadestown_ was presented in an intended pre-Broadway run as part of the 2017-18 season at Citadel Theatre in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Rachel Chavkin once again served as director, with performances scheduled for November 11 - December 3, 2017, with Amber Gray and Patrick Page reprising their roles from NYTW. The production was presented in collaboration with Mara Isaacs and Dale Franzen, who produced the Off-Broadway run.[9] The NYTW production was also featured in the award-winning documentary series _Working in the Theatre_ produced by the American Theatre Wing.[10]

Ahead of a 2019 Broadway transfer, _Hadestown_ was performed in the Olivier Theatre of the National Theatre in London. Making its UK debut, it ran from November 2, 2018 to January 26, 2019.[11] The production team included Rachel Hauck for scenic design, Michael Krass for costume design, Bradley King for lighting design, Nevin Steinberg and Jessica Paz for sound design, David Neumann for choreography, and Liam Robinson for musical direction.[12] Patrick Page, Amber Gray, and Reeve Carney reprised their performances in the National Theatre production, joined by Eva Noblezada, André De Shields (who had participated in some early workshops of the production),[13] Carly Mercedes Dyer, Rosie Fletcher, and Gloria Onitiri.[14]

_Hadestown_ opened on Broadway at the Walter Kerr Theatre, with previews beginning on March 22, 2019 and opening night set for April 17, 2019.[15] Page, Gray, De Shields, Carney, and Noblezada reprise their performances for the Broadway production, and are joined by Jewelle Blackman, Yvette Gonzales-Nacer, and Kay Trinidad.[16] The production team also reunites Hauck for scenic design, Krass for costume design, King for lighting design, Steinberg and Jessica Paz for sound design, Neumann for choreography, and Robinson for musical direction.

Reception

_Hadestown_ received generally positive critical reviews. _The New York Times_ described the Off-Broadway production as "inventive" and "gorgeously sung," praising its simplicity and intimacy.[23] _The Hollywood Reporter_ described the added dialogue as "wince-inducing" but favored its high energy and immersive staging.[24] Several reviews drew parallels linking the song "Why We Build the Wall" with Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, though the song predates the campaign.[25][26]

The production opened on Broadway on April 17, 2019 to mainly positive critical reception.[27]
