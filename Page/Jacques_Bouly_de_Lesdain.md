Count JACQUES BOULY DE LESDAIN (1880-1975) was a French aristocrat, lawyer and diplomat. He was the author of several travel books about Asia and political books about Germany. He was the political editor of _L'Illustration_ and he organised anti-Freemasonry conferences during World War II.


Early life

Jacques Bouly de Lesdain was born on 4 October 1880.[1] He was a count.[2] He graduated from Sciences Po and received a bachelor's degree in Laws.[3]


Career

Bouly de Lesdain was a lawyer and diplomat.[4] He was the author of books about Mongolia and Tibet, based on his travelling experiences.[5] For example, he had led an expedition in the Gobi Desert in 1902.[6] He also published several books about Germany, including _La Seconde paix_, a 1931 treatise in which he called for closer Franco-German relations under the pseudonym of "Esdalin".[7] By the 1930s, he joined the Dunkirk chapter of the Action Française.[8]

Bouly de Lesdain joined _L'Illustration_ as a contributor based in Basel, Switzerland, in 1939.[9] During World War II, he supported Germany and met Otto Abetz several times.[10] He complained that his antisemitic articles were turned down for publication by _L'Illustration_.[11] However, he subsequently became its political editor.[12]

Bouly de Lesdain co-organised an anti-Freemasonry conference with Jean Rivière in October 1940 at the Petit Palais.[13] It was attended by more than a million visitors,[14] and later shown in Rouen, Bordeaux, Lille and Nancy until the summer of 1942, when it was shown in Berlin, Germany.[15] Meanwhile, Bouly de Lesdain organised another conference, Exposition de la France européenne, held at the Grand Palais from 31 May to 31 October 1941.[16] By then, he openly criticised Marshal Philippe Pétain for failing to take a hard line on racial policy,[17] and he was engaged in "active collaborationism".[18] In August 1944, he fled to the Sigmaringen Castle with members of the Vichy government, and he was the director of their radio communications.[19]


Personal life and death

Bouly de Lesdain married Martha Mailey, an American explorer he met in the Gobi Desert in 1902; they divorced in 1926.[20] He died in 1975.[21]
