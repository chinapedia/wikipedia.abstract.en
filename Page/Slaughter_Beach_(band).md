Musical style and Influences

Slaughter Beach's music has been described as a mixture between Lo-fi, Indie and Pop music.[8] According to indie music and rap blog Pigeons and Planes "Slaughter Beach draws on rock influences like Beach House, Girls (band), MGMT, and The Strokes to create a sound that expands upon today’s prevailing sounds and brings a little grunginess back into the fold".[9]
