_THE SOLDIERS_ (German: Die Soldaten) is a 1776 comedy by Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz written from his own experiences during his service under Friedrich Graf Kleist von Nollendorf.[1] It was influential on Georg BÃ¼chner in his attempt to write the drama _Woyzeck_ (left incomplete 1837), although that is set at a lower social strata. The play is the source of two operas: _Soldaten_ by Manfred Gurlitt (1930) and _Die Soldaten_ by Bernd Alois Zimmermann (1965).
