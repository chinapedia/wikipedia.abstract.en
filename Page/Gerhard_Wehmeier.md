Teaching

Wehmeier began teaching Old Testament at the United Theological College, Bangalore from 1973 during the Principalship of J. R. Chandran. Wehmeier's students who specialized in Old Testament during that period include,

-   1972-1974, S. J. Theodore of the Church of South India, Diocese of Karimnagar,
-   1972-1975, N. K. Achumi of the Bible Society of India,
-   1975-1977, R. Daniel Premkumar of the Church of South India Synod,
-   1976-1978, D. Dhanaraj of the Karnataka Theological College,
-   1977-1979, J. Bhaskar Jeyaraj of the South Asia Institute of Advanced Christian Studies.

When Wehmeier joined the seminary in 1973, John Sadananda, the present Master of the Senate of Serampore College (University) was still a graduate student who benefited from the Old Testament scholarship of Wehmeier and his other two colleagues, G. M. Butterworth and E. C. John and the three of them led the Old Testament studies in Bangalore while John D. W. Watts[7] and G. Babu Rao[8] led the Old Testament studies in Serampore College, Serampore for nearly half a decade.

After Wehmeier returned to Germany in 1978 to take up responsibilities with his home Church, the Evangelical Church of Hesse Electorate-Waldeck, he continued to be involved in matters relating to ministerial support for students pursuing seminary studies in India. It was Wehmeier who made possible[9] the overseas research studies of Daniel Sadananda, a New Testament Scholar and current President of the United Theological College, Bangalore Society.
