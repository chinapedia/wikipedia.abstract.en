History

In the 1960s, the increase of serious criminal cases such as kidnapping, aircraft hijacking, piracy and bombing became a serious problem in Japan. The kidnapping case of Yoshinobu Murakoshi, a four-year-old child, raised significant questions to solve these kind of cases. In this case, Hachibē Hiratsuka, a detective assigned to the case, was able to apprehend the suspect, but it was too late to save the victim.

It became clear that traditional criminal investigation systems were sluggish and outdated for these new-style, rapid-tempo, and sometimes lethal cases. As a response to these problems, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department (TMPD) established the SIT unit within their Criminal Investigation Bureau in 1964. These detectives were well acquainted with new technology and special tactics to track and capture the criminals quickly and accurately.

At the beginning, the name "SIT" came from an acronym of its romanized Japanese unit name, , but later, the origin of its name as an acronym of its English name, Special Investigation Team, was added afterwards by misunderstanding from an officer who is fluent in English.

This idea achieved a great success that in 1970, the National Police Agency (NPA) requested the establishment of these kind of units for other Prefectural Police forces throughout Japan. These detectives also became responsible for intervening and rescuing when hostages were in danger. In 1992, TMPD strengthened the SWAT capability by incorporating several SAT operators into its SIT.


Organization

Structure

All unit are established in the of each Prefectural police headquarters (PPHs). These units are generally local-based, so organizations (including their unit names) and equipment are varied. Among them, the Special Investigations Team (SIT) of the TMPD and the Martial Arts Attack Team (MAAT) of the Osaka PPH are the first units to be ccreated, so in hostage cases in rural areas, the NPA order these units to dispatch advisers to the relevant Prefectural Police.[1]

In the First Criminal Investigation Division of the TMPD, the following units are assigned for special criminal investigation activities:[2]

Of all these units, Units One and Two are in charge of hostage cases and especially known as "SIT". As of the early 2000s, there were over 60 detectives in total for these seven units, and about 30 detectives with Unit One and Two alone. On the contrary, some rural PPHs assign only one or two detectives to these offices, so in case of SWAT operations, these units can be reinforced by detectives of , first responders for initial criminal investigations.

Capabilities

For manhunt missions, detectives of these units are well acquainted with many technique and technology such as telephone tapping, stakeout, surveillance, and crisis negotiation. And in order to restrain violent criminals quickly, they also have tactical capabilities. In addition to standard service handguns (.38 Special caliber revolvers such as New Nambu M60, or .32 ACP caliber semi-automatic pistols such as SIG Sauer P230), some units are equipped with large 9×19mm Parabellum caliber semi-automatic pistols (Beretta 92 Vertec, for example) and pistol-caliber carbines (Heckler & Koch MP5SFK, semi-automatic variant of MP5K with foldable stock). They also use non-lethal weapons such as FN 303 or BGL-65.

Counter-terrorism operations are the affairs of the operators of the Security Divisions, such as Special Assault Teams (SAT) or Anti-firearms squads, so these SWAT-capable detectives are mandated for critical incidents except terrorism. However, in some rural but well-versed Prefectural Police like Aomori, these detectives can form a counter-terrorism task force together with uniformed officers and riot specialists.[3]
