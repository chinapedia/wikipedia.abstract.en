Star_Trek_ENT_logo.svg _Star Trek: Enterprise_ is an American science fiction television series that originally aired on the UPN network from September 26, 2001 to May 13, 2005.[1] Until the episode "Extinction" towards the start of the third season, the series was called simply _Enterprise_ without the _Star Trek_ prefix.[2] The series aired for 98 episodes across four seasons, centring on the adventures of the 22nd century starship _Enterprise_. They are the first deep space explorers in Starfleet,[3] using the first Warp 5 equipped vessel.[4] It was set within the universe of the _Star Trek_ franchise, with the series placed earlier in the chronology than _Star Trek: The Original Series_.[5]

Following the end of _Star Trek: Voyager_, executive producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga entered immediately into production on _Enterprise_ in line with feedback from the studio.[6] They remained sole executive producers and show runners until the fourth season when Manny Coto took the lead on the show. He had joined the crew as co-producer during the third season.[7] The pilot, "Broken Bow", was watched by 12.5 million viewers on the first broadcast on UPN.[8] After the first few weeks of episodes, the ratings were considered to be solid enough and the expectation was that the series would run for seven seasons in the same manner as _The Next Generation_, _Deep Space Nine_ and _Voyager_.[9] However, the viewing figures began to decrease towards the end of the season.[10] Changes were made for the third season, with the introduction of the season-long Xindi storyline. This improved the reviews that the series was receiving, but the ratings continued to decrease. Critics began to talk of giving _Star Trek_ a break from television and suggesting that the decline was caused by overall franchise fatigue. UPN cut the 26 episode order for the third season to 24, meaning that if 24 episodes were created for the fourth season as well then they would have the 100 episodes needed for syndication.[11] However, it was cancelled two episodes short of this target.[12]
