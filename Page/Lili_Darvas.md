She was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play in 1971 for her performance in _Les Blancs_. She received critical acclaim for her performance in the 1971 film _Love_, for which she was given a special award at the Cannes Film Festival and a runner-up mention by the National Society of Film Critics. Her additional film appearances include _Meet Me in Las Vegas_ (1956) and the 1960 remake of _Cimarron_.


Life and career

Darvas was born in Budapest in 1902, the daughter of Berta (née Freiberger) and Alexander Darvas.[3] She studied at the Budapest Lyceum, and had her professional acting debut when she was 20.[4]

In 1925 she married the playwright Franz Molnar, and became a member of Max Reinhardt's theater group, learning German and joining the Theater in der Josefstadt, from 1925 until the Anschluss in 1938, when they were forced to flee. Her peers during this time included Luise Rainer and Lotte Lenya. She was the first "Olympic" as the daughter "Vivie" in George Bernard Shaw's _Mrs. Warren's Profession_ or Genia Hofreiter in Arthur Schnitzler's _The Vast Domain_. Her husband accompanied her on her tours to Berlin, Vienna and Salzburg. In 1926 she played in Molnar's _Játék kastélyban_ and _Riviera_. The former piece was performed on all the major European stages in the same year performed on Broadway. In 1927 she played Titania in Reinhardt's production of _A Midsummer Night's Dream_.[5]

In New York theater directors and publishers bombarded the couple with offers and invitations. They were even received by President Calvin Coolidge at the White House, and Molnár's 50th birthday was celebrated lavishly.

Darvas received American citizenship in 1944. Because of the subsequent long periods of separation and Darvas' travelling, the couple separated amicably, but remained married and friends until Molnár's death in 1952.

She played Granny Bayles in The Twilight Zone episode "Long Distance Call" (Season 2 - Episode 22) in 1961. In 1970 she was in Károly Makk's Hungarian film _Love_ (Szerelem).
