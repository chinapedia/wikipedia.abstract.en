SHARON PINCOTT is an Australian author and specialist in the field of African elephant behavior. She has studied the social structure and population dynamics of a single clan of wild elephants extensively and is an advocate for ending ivory trade and promoting conservation.


Background

Pincott grew up in the small town of Grantham, Queensland in the Lockyer Valley Region in Australia's east. She originally worked in the field of Information Technology (IT) and progressed to the position of National Director of IT for Ernst & Young Australia based in Sydney.[1]


Zimbabwe-focused work

Pincott worked alone, on a full-time voluntary basis,[2][3] for 13 years (2001-2014) with the clan of wild, free-roaming, elephants known as the Presidential Elephants of Zimbabwe on land bordering the Main Camp entrance to Hwange National Park. She acquired a reputation for being able to "talk to the elephants".[4]

In 2009, eight years after arriving in Zimbabwe, Pincott was appointed South Africa _Getaway_ magazine's 'Elephant Ambassador in Africa' "in recognition of her courageous work with wildlife in Hwange".[5] Pincott subsequently came to the attention of Natural History Unit Africa and became the subject of the documentary titled _All the President's Elephants_.[6]

This _All the President's Elephants_ documentary[7] was filmed with Pincott in Hwange in 2011.[8][9][10] It is the story of Pincott's life, work and intimate relationship with the Presidential Elephants of Zimbabwe, showcasing these Hwange elephants and some of the problems they face. It includes her wire snare removal work with colleagues called in to dart injured elephants using a tranquillizer gun. It also features Pincott's work successfully recommending and encouraging President Robert Mugabe to reaffirm his commitment to this clan of elephants, in an effort to secure their future.

Her elephant conservation work has been profiled in _National Geographic_,[15] BBC Wildlife[16] and _Africa Geographic_.[17] She has been interviewed by writers for _Intrepid Explorer_ magazine, South Africa[18] _The Zimbabwean_ newspaper,[19] _The Sydney Morning Herald_,[20] and _Travel Africa_ magazine.[21]


Author

She has published three books: _The Elephants and I_ (Jacana Media, South Africa 2009), _Battle for the President's Elephants_ (Jacana Media, South Africa 2012) and _Elephant Dawn_ (first published by Allen & Unwin, Australia 2016, and then by Jacana Media, South Africa 2016). She is also the author of two earlier elephant works self-published in Zimbabwe, _In An Elephant's Rumble_ (2004, ) and _A Year Less Ordinary_ (2006, ).


Ivory trade

For World Wildlife Day 2017 Pincott collaborated with the International Fund for Animal Welfare in an attempt to help bring an end to the Ivory trade.[22] On International Women's Day 2017 Pincott was acknowledged by associates of the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland, Australia, as "blazing a trail for elephants as well as women working in conservation".[23] In late March 2017, almost 3 years after leaving her Hwange elephant work, Pincott was still being acknowledged by the Zimbabwe press for her "profound dedication to the Presidential Elephants", in a country increasingly known for hostility towards conservationists who speak out against wildlife-related corruption.[24] In May 2017, after a male big-game hunter was crushed to death in Hwange when an adult female elephant, felled by gunfire, landed on him, Pincott reasoned in an interview that it was "likely" to be a known Presidential Elephant female that was shot in this hunting party incident, and highlighted the ongoing ineffectuality of Mugabe's Presidential Decree.[25]


Health

In 2017 Pincott revealed that she was suffering from rare, incurable, autoimmune connective tissue disease believed by medical researchers to be both environment- and stress-related.[26]
