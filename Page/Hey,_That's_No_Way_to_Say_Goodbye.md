"HEY, THAT'S NO WAY TO SAY GOODBYE" is a song by Leonard Cohen. It was first released in November 1967, in a version by Judy Collins on her album _Wildflowers_.[1] The following month, Cohen's own version was issued on his debut album _Songs of Leonard Cohen_.

Cohen wrote the song when staying at the Penn Terminal Hotel on 34th Street in New York City in 1966. He wrote:

  The room is too hot. I can't open the windows. I am in the midst of a bitter quarrel with a blonde woman. The song is half-written in pencil but it protects us as we manoeuvre, each of us, for unconditional victory. I am in the wrong room. I am with the wrong woman.[2]

It was covered in 1969 by Roberta Flack on her debut album _First Take_, and has been recorded by many other singers.[3] Feist, Ariel Engle and Daniela Gesundheit performed the song at the 2017 _Tower of Song: A Memorial Tribute to Leonard Cohen_ concert[4]
