CURTSY, previously known as NIMBLE, is a peer-to-peer app for renting dresses.[1] It allows people to offer dresses for rental by location, style, color, occasion or rating. Owners and renters of the dresses coordinate an exchange location, while Curtsy manages payment and the transaction. The application includes a blog about current fashion.[2] Curtsy was designed by Sara Kiparizoska and William Ault, both students at the University of Mississippi, where Curtsy was first launched in 2015.[3] The founders of the company include David Oates, Curtsy's current CEO William Ault, and lead developer Eli Allen.[4] Curtsy is located in San Francisco, CA with an office in Oxford, Mississippi.[5]
