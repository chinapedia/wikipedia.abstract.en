Description

_Eucalyptus flindersii_ is a mallee, rarely a small tree, and typically grows to a height of and usually has smooth, dull, grey bark that sheds in flakes to reveal a paler layer, sometimes with rough bark at the base of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section, and leaves that are petiolate, egg-shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves are the same dull to slightly glossy, green to blue-green colour on both sides, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole wide. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of three or seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a rounded to conical operculum. Flowering occurs between August and October and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody hemispherical to conical capsule long and wide with the valves protruding above the rim of the fruit.[2][3][4][5][6]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus flindersii_ was first formally described in 1980 by Clifford Boomsma in the _Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens_ from a specimen collected by Roger Callen on Mount Hack in the Flinders Ranges.[7][8][9] The specific epithet (_flindersii_) honours Captain Matthew Flinders, after whom the Flinders Ranges, where this species occurs, was named.[10]


Distribution and habitat

The South Australian grey mallee grows on slopes and between rocks in open woodland, mainly in the Flinders Ranges but with outliers to the south near Yunta and Quorn.[11][12]
