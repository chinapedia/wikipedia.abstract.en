The 2017 NEW YORK METS SEASON was the franchise's 56th season and the team's ninth season at Citi Field. The Mets opened the season on April 3 against the Atlanta Braves and finished the season on October 1 against the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park. On September 19, the Mets were eliminated from postseason contention.[1]

Just two years removed from a World Series appearance, the Mets had high expectations.[2][3] However, the season was a major disappointment with injuries to key players, poor performances from players such as Yoenis Cespedes, Matt Harvey, and Robert Gsellman, and by controversy within the organization and around players.[4][5] The Mets thus finished in the 4th place in their division, missed the playoffs for the first time since 2014, and equaled their worst record since 2009. Manager Terry Collins announced his retirement following the final game of the season.


Offseason

On November 14, 2016, second baseman Neil Walker accepted the qualifying offer, returning to the New York Mets for $17.2 million.

On October 29, 2016, Yoenis Cespedes re-signed with the Mets for $110 million for 4 years. This is the Mets second biggest free agent signing in their history.

On January 27, 2017, Jerry Blevins re-signed with the Mets for a one-year deal with option for 2018.

Fernando Salas re-signed with the Mets for a one-year deal.
