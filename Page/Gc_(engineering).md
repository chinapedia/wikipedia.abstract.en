In engineering and physics, _G__(C) is a unit conversion factor used to convert mass to force or vice versa.[1] It is defined as

$$g_\text{c} = \frac{ma}{F}$$

In unit systems where force is a derived unit, like in SI units, _g__(c) is equal to 1. In unit systems where force is a primary unit, like in English units, _g__(c) is not equal to 1, and is required to obtain correct results.[2]


Motivations

According to Newton's law of motion, the force _F_ is proportional to the product of mass _m_ and acceleration _a_:

_F_ ∝ _m__a_
or

_F_ = _K__m__a_

If _F_ = 1 lbf, _m_ = 1 lb, and _a_ = , then

$$1~\text{lbf} = K \cdot 1~\text{lb} \cdot 32.2~\frac{\text{ft}}{\text{s}^2}$$
Leading to

$$K = \frac{1~\text{lbf}}{1~\text{lb} \cdot 32.2~\frac{\text{ft}}{\text{s}^2}} = 0.03106~\frac{\text{lbf} \cdot \text{s}^2}{\text{lb} \cdot \text{ft}}$$

_g__(c) is defined as the reciprocal of the constant _K_

$$g_\text{c} = \frac{1}{K} = 32.2~\frac{\text{lb} \cdot\text{ft}}{\text{lbf} \cdot \text{s}^2}$$
or equivalently, as

$$g_\text{c} = \frac{ma}{F}$$
