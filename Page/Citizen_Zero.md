CITIZEN ZERO is an American hard rock band from Detroit, Michigan. Founded in Rochester Hills in 2010 by siblings Greg (bass), John (drums), and Matt Dudley (guitar) and vocalist Josh LeMay (FMR Mayyle) the band caught the ear of Kid Rock's recording engineer Al Sutton, who worked with them in Rustbelt Studios and recorded their eponymous 2011 debut EP. In 2012, Matt Dudley died, forcing the band to recruit new guitarist Sammy Boller to finish up their second EP, 2012's _Life Explodes_. In 2013, Citizen Zero won a Detroit Music Award for Outstanding Rock/Pop Recording. In 2016 Citizen Zero secured a deal with Wind-Up Records and released debut studio album, _State of Mind_. Their debut single "Go (Let Me Save You)" peaked at #17 on the mainstream rock chart.
