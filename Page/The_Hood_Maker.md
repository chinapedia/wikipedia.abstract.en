"THE HOOD MAKER" is a short story by Philip K. Dick, originally published in the June 1955 issue of the magazine _Imagination_.[1][2] It was adapted by Matthew Graham into an episode for the 2017 TV series, _Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams_.


Plot

The Free Union, a repressive regime, uses people with telepathic powers called "teeps" to root out and eliminate its political opponents. Walter Franklin, a government appointee, is caught up in a struggle between the teeps and ordinary humans when he receives a hood which blocks his thoughts from being read. He is accused of subversion, called "deviation" by a teep named Abdul and forced to flee. When he meets the titular "hood maker", James Cutter, he learns a secret that could put an end to the teeps' plans to seize power.[3]


TV adaptation

The story was loosely adapted by Matthew Graham for _Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams_, which aired on September 18, 2017 on Channel4 in the UK.[4]

The whole emphasis is different.[5] The Free Union, a repressive regime, uses people with telepathic powers called "teeps" to root out and eliminate its political opponents. The telepaths are unhappy and oppressed, and the entire society is run down and violent. All telepaths have skin markings on their face for unexplained reasons.

Agent Ross, a police detective, is given a telepathic woman as a partner. He also learns that someone is distributing hoods which block telepathy.
