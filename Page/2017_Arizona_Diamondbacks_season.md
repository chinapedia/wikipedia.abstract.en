The 2017 ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS SEASON was the franchise's 20th season in Major League Baseball and their 20th season at Chase Field and in Phoenix, Arizona. They began the season on April 2 at home against the San Francisco Giants. The Diamondbacks finished the season 93–69 to finish in second place in the National League West Division, 11 games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers. They also flipped their record from the previous year, in which they went 69-93.

On September 24, the Diamondbacks clinched a Wild Card berth with losses by the Milwaukee Brewers and the St. Louis Cardinals. They also clinched home field for the Wild Card game after a 3–2 walk-off victory over the Miami Marlins. This marked the first trip to the playoffs for the Diamondbacks since 2011. In the Wild Card Game, they defeated the Colorado Rockies to advance the National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. They were swept by the Dodgers three games to none.


Offseason and spring training

During their pre-season spring training, the Diamondbacks participated in the Cactus League, finishing with a 15–15 win–loss record.[1] They also played two tied games that were not included in the standings.[2]


Regular season

Facing the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 4, Diamondbacks outfielder J. D. Martinez became the 18th player in MLB history to hit four home runs in a game. This performance meant that the Diamondbacks became the first team ever to have had a 20-strikeout game in nine innings (Randy Johnson, 2001), a perfect game (Johnson again, 2004) and a four-homer game (Martinez).[3]

Playoffs

Making it to the playoffs for the first time since 2011, the Diamondbacks played their first series as a Wild Card team by playing against the Colorado Rockies on October 4, 2017. That night, Archie Bradley became the first relief pitcher and sixth pitcher in MLB history to record a triple in a postseason game. The play was considered a major highlight in their first Wild Card game in franchise history, winning 11–8 that night at home. The Diamondbacks also became the first team to record 4 triples in a single playoff game since the Boston Americans in the 1903 World Series. They subsequently lost to the Dodgers in the NLDS.
