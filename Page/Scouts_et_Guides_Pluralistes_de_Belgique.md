LES SCOUTS ET GUIDES PLURALISTES DE BELGIQUE is a coeducational, nonreligious Scouting movement in French-speaking Belgium. This movement, known until 1992 as Fédération des Éclaireuses et Éclaireurs is the francophone branch after the split of the Boy-Scouts et Girl-Guides de Belgique (BSB-GGB) in 1966. Pluralist Scouts are officially recognized by the French Community in Wallonia-Brussels and are active members of the Council of the Conseil de la Jeunesse d’Expression française and the Confédération des Organisations de Jeunesse indépendantes et pluralistes (COJ).


Branches

From 5 to 21 years old, young people are divided into different branches:

-   Castors (Beavers) , from 5 to 8 years old
-   Louveteaux (Cubs) , 8 to 12 years old
-   Guides et scouts (Guides and Scouts) , 12 to 15 years old
-   Pionniers (Pioneers) , 15 to 18 years old
-   Clan , from 18 to 21 years old


Uniform

The uniform of the pluralist Scouts is composed of a scarf with the colors of its unit and a gray shirt. Girls and boys wear the same uniform. For the bottom in general there is no set rule, but some troops insist on wearing shorts.
