Reception

Balaji Balasubramaniam gave the film a rating of 1.5 stars out of 4, stating : "Sundari Neeyum Sundaran Naanum also falls victim to the trend with its duets and fights. But many of the jokes manage to be funny and this makes the overall viewing experience less painful that expected".[8] Sify said that the film is a "waste of time".[9]
