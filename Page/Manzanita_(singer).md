MVC-674F.JPG JOSÉ MANUEL ORTEGA HEREDIA (Madrid, 7 February 1956 - Alhaurín de la Torre, Málaga, 6 December 2004) was a Spanish singer and guitarist.[1]

In 1978, with producer José Luis de Carlos, he recorded his first solo album, _Poco ruido y mucho duende_, in a very personal style with flamenco nuances. The theme _Verde_, adapted from a poem by Lorca, was a great success. In 1980, he recorded his second LP _Espíritu sin nombre_ with the palmero Daniel Barba de las Arenas. With his third album, in 1981, _Talco y bronce_, he surpassed half a million copies in Spain with the singles _Un ramito de violetas_ and _Por tu ausencia_. They were followed by _Cuando la noche te envuelve_ (1982), _La quiero a morir_ (1983) and _Mal de amores_ (1984).

In 1986, he released _Echando sentencias_, including Arab and Indian instruments. In 1988 he launched _En voz baja a las rosas_, with adaptations of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, Góngora and Lorca. In 1993 he made testimony to his faith in the album _Quédate con Cristo_. After a long silence, in which he only sang for the Evangelical Church, he returned in 1998 with the album _Por tu ausencia_, a live recording of greatest hits and new songs that became a gold record. In 1999 he repeated the gold record with the soundtrack of the film _Sobreviviré_.

In 2000 he recorded _Dímelo_, a new gold record, and in 2002 _Gitano cubano_, accompanied by Raimundo Amador, Lolita and Cuban singers Lucrecia and David Montes.

In 2004 he died in his house as a result of a heart attack.
