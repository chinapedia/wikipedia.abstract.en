_VAMPIRE EXPERT_ is 1995 Hong Kong television series produced by ATV and starring Lam Ching-ying.[1] The two-season series served as a transition from film to television for the 1980s Hong Kong Chinese vampire film franchise.[2][3] A third season was planned, but due to the poor health and subsequent death of lead actor Lam Ching-ying, the series was cancelled in 1996.[4][5]

Development

Following the popularity of various Chinese vampire films in the 1980s,[6] Hong Kong television network ATV World made plans to create a similar television series starring Lam Ching-ying, who was a familiar face in the genre and often typecast.[7] Lam signed on to the film for HK$1 million, and filming started in early 1996.[8]
