_DET SOVANDE FOLKET_ (, _The Sleeping People_) is a book written in 1993 by Fredrik Reinfeldt, later Prime Minister of Sweden, and published by the Moderate Youth League. Written when the early 1990s banking crisis was deepest, the book argues for abandoning the general welfare state in Sweden, for sharp tax cuts, and for the rollback of the state's involvement in education, law, culture, and the media:

  _The Swedes are mentally handicapped and indoctrinated to believe that politicians can create and guarantee welfare._[1][2][3][4]

In the first chapter the author presents a dystopian vision of the future. Later chapters detail the Moderates' plan of action, its implementation in daily life, and its moral basis. The last chapter presents examples from real life.

After Reinfeldt became the leader of the Moderate Party in 2003, and Prime Minister in 2006, the book was often referred to by political opponents.

Social Democratic leader Mona Sahlin at the 2009 party congress recommended reading the book, not as a book to be inspired by, but to understand the bourgeois ideology.

In 2013 a theater group adapted _Det sovande folket_ to the stage, which renewed discussion of the book.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]


Criticism

In 2014, Folkbladet published an article criticizing Reinfeldt for having denied authorship of the book[17]. The book has been criticized for falsifying Swedish history[18]. The extreme right-wing Nordfront criticized Reinfeldt for his "_svenskfientlighet_" (swede-phobia) in the book[19].
