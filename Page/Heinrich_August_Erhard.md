Erhard,_August_Heinrich.jpg HEINRICH AUGUST ERHARD (13 February 1793, in Erfurt – 22 June 1851, in Münster) was a German physician, archivist and historian.

From 1809 he studied medicine, history and philology at the University of Göttingen, receiving his doctorates in medicine (1812) and philosophy (1813) from the University of Erfurt. After graduation, he worked as a physician in Erfurt (1813–16), as a military doctor (1815), as an assistant librarian (from 1816) and as a teacher at the Evangelical Gymnasium (Erfurt).[1][2]

From 1822 to 1827 he served as librarian at the former university library in Erfurt. In 1824 he became an archivist at the provincial archives in Magdeburg while still maintaining his function at the Erfurt library. In 1831 he was appointed director of the provincial archives in Münster. After his death in 1851, he was succeeded at Münster by Roger Wilmans.[3]

He was the editor of numerous articles in the _Archiv für Geschichte und Alterthumskunde Westphalens_ ("Archive for History and Archaeology of Westphalia") and the _Zeitschrift für vaterländische Geschichte und Altertumskunde_ ("Journal of Patriotic History and Archaeology").[4]
