_CALADENIA BICALLIATA_ is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is native to the south-west of Western Australia and coastal areas of South Australia. It has a single erect, hairy leaf and one or two cream-coloured flowers. There are two subspecies differing in the size and colour of the flowers.


Description

_Caladenia bicalliata_ is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and wide. The inflorescence is a raceme, high with up to three flowers, each flower long and wide. The dorsal sepal is erect and abruptly narrows about one-third of its length from the base. The lateral sepals and petals are cream or greenish-cream and are much shorter than those of the similar _C. abbreviata_ and _C. evanescens_. The dorsal sepals and petals have reddish-brown or pale yellow tips, depending on subspecies. The labellum is white, sometimes with red stripes and has two rows of white calli along its centre. Flowering occurs between August and early October but the flowers are only open for a day or two or may not open at all.[1][2]


Taxonomy and naming

_Caladenia bicalliata_ was first formally described by Richard Rogers in 1909 from a specimen collected at Kingscote on Kangaroo Island. The description was published in _Transactions, proceedings and report, Royal Society of South Australia_.[3][4] The specific epithet (_bicalliata_) refers to the two rows of calli on the labellum of this species.[5]

There are two subspecies:

-   _Caladenia bicalliata_ subsp. _bicalliata_;
-   _Caladenia bicalliata_ subsp. _cleistogama_.


Distribution and habitat

This spider orchid occurs in a narrow coastal strip, growing in calcareous soil between Kalbarri and Esperance in Western Australia and along the south-east coast but sometimes up to inland in South Australia.[6][7][8][9]


Conservation

_Caladenia bicalliata_ is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[10]
