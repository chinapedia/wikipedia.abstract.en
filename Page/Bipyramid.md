bipiramide5.jpgs and elastics. An extra axial straw is added which doesn't exist in the simple polyhedron]] An _n_-gonal BIPYRAMID or DIPYRAMID is a polyhedron formed by joining an _n_-gonal pyramid and its mirror image base-to-base. An _n_-gonal bipyramid has 2_n_ triangle faces, 3_n_ edges, and 2 + _n_ vertices.

The referenced _n_-gon in the name of the bipyramids is not an external face but an internal one, existing on the primary symmetry plane which connects the two pyramid halves.


Right, oblique and concave bipyramids

A RIGHT BIPYRAMID has two points above and below the centroid of its base. Nonright bipyramids are called OBLIQUE BIPYRAMIDS. A REGULAR BIPYRAMID has a regular polygon internal face and is usually implied to be a _right bipyramid_. A right bipyramid can be represented as for internal polygon P, and a regular _n_-bipyramid

A CONCAVE BIPYRAMID has a concave interior polygon.

The face-transitive regular bipyramids are the dual polyhedra of the uniform prisms and will generally have isosceles triangle faces.

A bipyramid can be projected on a sphere or globe as _n_ equally spaced lines of longitude going from pole to pole, and bisected by a line around the equator.

Bipyramid faces, projected as spherical triangles, represent the fundamental domains in the dihedral symmetry D_(_n_h). Indeed, an n-tonal bipyramid can be seen as the Kleetope of the respective n-gonal dihedron.


Volume

The volume of a bipyramid is _V_ =_Bh_ where _B_ is the area of the base and _h_ the height from the base to the apex. This works for any location of the apex, provided that _h_ is measured as the perpendicular distance from the plane which contains the base.

The volume of a bipyramid whose base is a regular _n_-sided polygon with side length _s_ and whose height is _h_ is therefore:

$$V = \frac{n}{6}hs^2 \cot\frac{\pi}{n}.$$


Equilateral triangle bipyramids

Only three kinds of bipyramids can have all edges of the same length (which implies that all faces are equilateral triangles, and thus the bipyramid is a deltahedron): the triangular, tetragonal, and pentagonal bipyramids. The tetragonal bipyramid with identical edges, or regular octahedron, counts among the Platonic solids, while the triangular and pentagonal bipyramids with identical edges count among the Johnson solids (J₁₂ and J₁₃).

+--------------------------+------------------+--------------------------+


Kaleidoscopic symmetry

If the base is regular and the line through the apexes intersects the base at its center, the symmetry group of the _n_-gonal bipyramid has dihedral symmetry D_(_n_h) of order 4_n_, except in the case of a regular octahedron, which has the larger octahedral symmetry group O_(h) of order 48, which has three versions of D_(4h) as subgroups. The rotation group is D_(_n_) of order 2_n_, except in the case of a regular octahedron, which has the larger symmetry group O of order 24, which has three versions of D₄ as subgroups.

The digonal faces of a spherical 2_n_-bipyramid represents the fundamental domains of dihedral symmetry in three dimensions: D_(_n_h), [_n_,2], (*_n_22), order 4_n_. The reflection domains can be shown as alternately colored triangles as mirror images.

  D_(1h)                             D_(2h)                            D_(3h)                               D_(4h)                               D_(5h)                               D_(6h)                                 ...

Right regular bipyramids

Asymmetric right bipyramids

An ASYMMETRIC RIGHT BIPYRAMID joins two unequal height pyramids. An _inverted_ form can also have both pyramids on the same side. A regular _n_-gonal asymmetry right pyramid has symmetry C_(_n_)v, order 2_n_. The dual polyhedron of an asymmetric bipyramid is a frustum.

Scalenohedron

A SCALENOHEDRON is topologically identical to a 2_n_-bipyramid, but contains congruent scalene triangles.[1]

There are two types. In one type the 2_n_ vertices around the center alternate in rings above and below the center. In the other type, the 2_n_ vertices are on the same plane, but alternate in two radii.

The first has 2-fold rotation axes mid-edge around the sides, reflection planes through the vertices, and n-fold rotation symmetry on its axis, representing symmetry D_(_n_d), [2⁺,2_n_], (2*_n_), order 2_n_. In crystallography, 8-sided and 12-sided scalenohedra exist.[2] All of these forms are isohedra.

The second has symmetry D_(_n_), [2,_n_], (*_nn_2), order 2_n_.

The smallest scalenohedron has 8 faces and is topologically identical to the regular octahedron. The second type is a _rhombic bipyramid_. The first type has 6 vertices can be represented as (0,0,±1), (±1,0,_z_), (0,±1,−_z_), where _z_ is a parameter between 0 and 1, creating a regular octahedron at _z_ = 0, and becoming a disphenoid with merged coplanar faces at _z_ = 1. For _z_ > 1, it becomes concave.

  _z_ = 0.1                _z_ = 0.25                _z_ = 0.5                _z_ = 0.95                _z_ = 1.5

Star bipyramids

Self-intersecting bipyramids exist with a star polygon central figure, defined by triangular faces connecting each polygon edge to these two points. A {p/q} bipyramid has Coxeter diagram .

[TABLE]

isohedral even-sided stars can also be made with zig-zag offplane vertices, in-out isotoxal forms, or both, like this {8/3} form:

4-polytopes with bipyramid cells

The dual of the rectification of each convex regular 4-polytopes is a cell-transitive 4-polytope with bipyramidal cells. In the following, the apex vertex of the bipyramid is A and an equator vertex is E. The distance between adjacent vertices on the equator EE = 1, the apex to equator edge is AE and the distance between the apices is AA. The bipyramid 4-polytope will have _V__(A) vertices where the apices of _N__(A) bipyramids meet. It will have _V__(E) vertices where the type E vertices of _N__(E) bipyramids meet. _N__(AE) bipyramids meet along each type AE edge. _N__(EE) bipyramids meet along each type EE edge. _C__(AE) is the cosine of the dihedral angle along an AE edge. _C__(EE) is the cosine of the dihedral angle along an EE edge. As cells must fit around an edge,

    * The rectified 16-cell is the regular 24-cell and vertices are all equivalent – octahedra are regular bipyramids.
    ** Given numerically due to more complex form.


Higher dimensions

In general, a _bipyramid_ can be seen as an _n_-polytope constructed with a (_n_ − 1)-polytope in a hyperplane with two points in opposite directions, equal distance perpendicular from the hyperplane. If the (_n_ − 1)-polytope is a regular polytope, it will have identical pyramids facets. An example is the 16-cell, which is an octahedral bipyramid, and more generally an _n_-orthoplex is an (_n_ − 1)-orthoplex bypyramid.

A two-dimensional bipyramid is a square.
