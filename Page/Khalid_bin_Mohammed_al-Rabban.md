Al- Rabban is the founder, chairman, and managing director of the Al Rabban Holding Company, holding company, that is, a company that owns enough voting stock in other companies to control their corporate policies and management. This company features a diversified portfolio of companies and partnerships.[1][2] Al Rabban Holding Company is a family-run holding company that was founded in 1970 when Mr. Khalid Al Rabban took over the Rabban Contracting and Trading Co. (WLL) and initiated a growth strategy that carefully selects strategic partnerships with international industry leaders to add value and diversify the holding and advance Qatari growth.[3][4][5] The companies managed by Al Rabban Holding include Rabban Readymix Company, Rayyan Mineral Water Company, Al Sarh Real Estate, Rabban Services Company, Rabban Contracting and Trading Company, Arabian Falcon Transport Company, Rabban Stefanutti Stocks, Rabban Hospitality, and Al Tayer Stocks. The holding company has interests in contracting, cement, general sponsorship and trading.[6]

He is also the founding chairman and managing director of the Qatar Primary Materials Company (QPMC).[7] QPMC is a Qatari company that specializes in establishing and developing sources of raw materials, focuses on the efficiencies of material handling operations, and provides a strategic reserve of primary materials. The firm has seen some controversy, especially with respect to its leadership, environmental impact, and work-related accidents.[8] QPMC was founded in 2006 by instruction of the Government of Qatar through an Emri decree to provide efficient port service at the gabbro berths, as well as developing them to increase their capacity and ability to manage larger quantities of raw materials imported to facilitate trade.[9][10] In addition to its tainted leadership, QPMC faces a number of environmental challenges. The company has struggled to keep its carbon footprint levels low. Additionally, the firm has faced a number of operational challenges in the aggregate supply chain, especially with regard to occupational hazards and harmful work-zone accidents that have occurred under its watch.[11][12]

Al Rabban was also the vice president and an initial donor of the Taliaa Club Qatar.[13] Taliaa Club Qatar was is a Qatari cultural club that was founded in 1959 with the goals of the club based in foundations and principles of a sports club, but acted more as a political club or party.[14][15] In 1961, tanks raided the club after Friday prayers, and members were taken to prison. Members were placed in isolation and were restricted from receiving any visitors in prison. Among those arrested was Khalid bin Mohammad al-Rabban, who spent 21 days in prison, and decided to go on a hunger strike.[16] After the intervention of a few relatives of the members, they were released from prison. Some members who were imprisoned referred to those who assisted in their release as servants of God.[17] It is believed this arrest occurred because of controversial publications and plays that inspired the use of violence regarding the Arabs in Palestine in a violent struggle, the use of missiles, he political struggle between nationalists and leftists in Iraq during the reign of Abd al-Karim Qasim.[18][19] The club also stated in its document of statues that it would interfere in religious and political matters.[20] He also helped establish the Qatari Popular Committee to Support the Palestinian Intifada.[21] This was a committee established in Doha sometime between 1988 and 1994 of 70 wealthy Qatari businessmen to lend financial support to Palestinians during the first Intifada uprising. The committee raised millions of Qatari riyals and partnered with numerous pro-Palestinian organizations including the Palestinian Cooperation foundation.[22][23]
