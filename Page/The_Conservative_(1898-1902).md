Conservative_ne.jpg _THE CONSERVATIVE_ was a weekly newspaper devoted to the discussion of political, economic, and sociological questions published in Nebraska City, Nebraska by Julius Sterling Morton.


History

_The Conservative_ was first issued on July 14, 1898 by the Morton Printing Company.[1] The publication was not dedicated to news but acted as a journal of political discussion. During the last two years of publishing Morton would use _The Conservative_ as a forum through which to disagree and criticize his rival Nebraska Democrat William Jennings Bryan and his publication _The Commoner_. In the first issue of _The Conservative_ the letter from the editor stated that the paper would be a defender of the individual and critical of big government. In addition, the paper also served as a platform where Morton campaigned for the formation of a third Conservative party that he believed was necessary to realign the environment of American politics.

Issued every Thursday _The Conservative_ was printed in a magazine style three column format that ranged from ten to twenty printed pages per issue.[2] Although the paper was only published for four years _The Conservative_ included many notable contributors like Robert W. Furnas, Carl Shurz and Dr. George L. Miller.[3]

Morton would remain at the helm of the paper until poor health would force him to turn over editorship to his son, Paul Morton, on April 24, 1902. The last issue of _The Conservative_ was published on May 29, 1902 and consisted mainly of tributes to the deceased Julius Sterling Morton.
