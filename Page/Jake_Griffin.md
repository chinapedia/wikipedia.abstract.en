Racing career

Early years

Racing in his early years at a Quincy, Illinois track, Griffin earned the name "Fireball" and raced late models and modifieds.[3]

ARCA Racing Series

Griffin dipped his toe into ARCA racing with Venturini Motorsports in 2016.[4] Running the Central Illinois SuperChevyStores.com 100 at the Illinois State Fairgrounds Racetrack, he qualified third in the No. 55 Chevrolet and finished ninth.[5]

Gander Outdoors Truck Series

Breaking into the series in 2015 with MB Motorsports,[6] Griffin dropped out of the Kroger 200 with handling problems to finish 26th. The MB partnership came about through a mutual friendship between team owner Mike Mittler and Jake's father Danny Griffin, which was formed by working in NASCAR together in 2004.[7] Six races later, he crashed out of the race at Iowa Speedway to finish 27th.[8] Attempting the Mudsummer Classic with Mike Affarano Motorsports, he failed to qualify after finishing fourth in the last chance qualifier.[9] In 2016, Griffin ran at Iowa again with MB, finishing one lap down in 21st. He retired with engine problems at Gateway Motorsports Park, and signed on with Red Horse Racing to run at Eldora Speedway. Qualifying 11th by way of heat race, Griffin made up seven spots during the race to finish fourth.[10][11]

After not competing in NASCAR in 2017 and 2018, Griffin returned to the Truck Series for the 2019 Eldora race with Mike Affarano Motorsports.[12]


Personal life

Griffin works closely with the organization People Against Distracted Driving after meeting the founder online.[13]
