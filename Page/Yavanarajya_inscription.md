The YAVANARAJYA INSCRIPTION, also called the MAGHERA INSCRIPTION, was discovered in a village near Mathura, India in 1988.[1] The Sanskrit inscription, carved on a block of red sandstone, is dated to the 1st century BCE, and is currently located at the Mathura Museum in Mathura.[2][3] The inscription notes the donation of a water well and tank to the community in 1st century BCE, built by a Brahmin.[4]

The inscription was published and analysed by French indologist Gérard Fussman in 1993.[5] The inscription is in Brahmi script, and is significant because it mentions that it was made in Year 116 of the _Yavanarajya_ ("Kingdom of the Yavanas"). It may mean that Mathura was a part of a Yavana dominion, possibly Indo-Greek, at the time the inscription was created.[6]


Inscription

The Yavanarajya inscription is in Brahmi script and describes a dedication for a well and a tank in Mathura on "The last day of year 116 of Yavana dominion (_Yavanarajya_)". Although the term "Yavanas" can sometimes mean "westerners" in general, the Yavanas mentioned in the inscription probably refer to the Indo-Greeks, as the Indo-Scythians or the Indo-Parthians are never associated with the word Yavana in the inscriptions of Mathura.[7] The date mentioned on the stone was the Hindu festival day of Holi, according to the Hindu calendar.[8][9]

Date

The year 116 probably refers to the Yavana era (), thought to begin in 186-185 BCE.[10] The inscription would thus have a date of 70 or 69 BCE.[11][12] Some other authors have also suggested the date is counted in the Maues era (circa 80 BCE) or the Azes era (circa 57 BCE).[13]

Interpretation

MenandrosCoin.jpg.]] The Yavanarajya inscription, states Sonya Rhie Quintanilla, mentions year 116 of the _yavana hegemony_ (_yavanarajya_), attesting to the 2nd-century BCE Indo-Greek presence. This makes the inscription unique in that it mentions the Indo-Greeks, and it "may confirm" the numismatic and literary evidence about Mathura being under the Indo-Greeks in that era.[15] It is unclear whether the Indo-Greeks were still present at the time the inscription was engraved, states Quintanilla. She states that the inscription's mention of a family of "Brahmin merchants" is significant as well and the foreign rule must have had a lasting impression on them.[16]

Quintanilla states that the nearly contemporaneous coinage of Menander I (165-135 BCE) and his successors found in the Mathura region, in combination with this inscription, suggests the hypothesis that there was a tributary style relationship between the Indo-Greek suzerains and the Mitra dynasty that ruled that region at the time.[17]
