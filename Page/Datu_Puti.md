DATU PUTI is a condiment brand owned by Nutri-Asia, Inc. (formerly known as Southeast Asia Foods, Inc.). Datu Puti was first introduced as a vinegar product in 1975 by Hernan Reyes. Eventually, soy sauce and fish sauce under the Datu Puti brand were introduced in the 1990s.[1] An oyster sauce product was also introduced.[2]


Branding

Datu Puti is a combination of the surname of Reyes' mother (DÃ¡tu), and the Filipino translation of the color white ("puti"), which is a primary color of the traditional palm or _sukang paombong_. The logo used for the brand features the image of a datu.[3]

The _Mukhasim_ (a portmanteau of Filipino words _mukha_; , and _asim_; ) marketing campaign was instrumental to the brand's recognition. The campaign was launched in the early 1980s which featured the comedian Conrado "Pugak" Piring, making a facial expression of having consumed something sour, dubbed as the "mukhasim" face.[4]


Market share

In August 2011, it was reported the Datu Puti is the Philippine market leader in vinegar. In the same report, the brand also leads in Luzon when it comes to soy sauce.[5]
