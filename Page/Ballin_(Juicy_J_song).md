"BALLIN" is a song by American rapper Juicy J that was released as a single on September 28, 2016. It features a guest appearance from fellow rapper Kanye West.


Background

On 23rd September 2016, five days belong the single was released, Juicy announced via Twitter that a viewing party would be available on TIDAL, which was streamed two days before its release.[1] The track was supposed to be part of Juicy's fourth studio album _Rubba Band Business_, but didn't end up on the tracklist when the album was released in December 2017.[2]


Composition

For both the intro and outro of "Ballin", a sample of "I'm Not Gonna Give Up" by Eddie Holman is used.[3] West's feature is minimal, since he only sings the chorus and Juicy J raps all of the verses.[4]


Music video

On September 29, 2016, one day after the song's release, the official music video for it was released.[5] This video was recorded with the two rappers being in a warehouse together.[6]
