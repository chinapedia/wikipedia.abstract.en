is a series of go-kart-style racing video games developed and published by Nintendo as spin-offs from its trademark Super Mario series. The first in the series, _Super Mario Kart_, was launched in 1992 on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to critical and commercial success.[1]

With six _Mario Kart_ games released on home consoles, three on portable handheld consoles, four arcade games co-developed with Namco and one for mobile phones on the way[2], the _MARIO KART_ series includes a total of fourteen entries. The latest game in the main series, _Mario Kart 8 Deluxe_, was released on Nintendo Switch in April 2017. The series has sold over 100 million copies worldwide to date.


History

The first title in the _Mario Kart_ series, _Super Mario Kart,_ was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. The development of the first game was overseen by Shigeru Miyamoto, the Japanese video game designer who created the original _Super Mario Bros._, as well as many other successful games for Nintendo. Darran Jones of NowGamer suggests that the original success of _Super Mario Kart_ was the result of including characters previously seen in _Mario Bros._ games, while also being a new type of racing game.[3]


Gameplay

''.]] In the _Mario Kart_ series, players compete in go-kart races, controlling one of a selection of characters, typically from the _Mario_ franchise. Up to twelve characters can compete in each race, the exact number varies between games.

One of the features of the series is the use of various power-up items obtained by driving into item boxes laid out on the course. These power-ups include mushrooms to give players a speed boost, Koopa Shells to be thrown at opponents, banana peels, and fake item boxes that can be laid on the course as hazards. The type of weapon received from an item box is influenced by the player's current position in the race.[4] For example, players lagging far behind may receive more powerful items while the leader may only receive small defensive items. Called rubber banding, this gameplay mechanism allows other players or computers a realistic chance to catch up to the leading player. They can also perform driving techniques during the race such as mini-turbos, slipstreams, and rocket starts.

As the series has progressed, each new installment has introduced new gameplay elements, such as new circuits, items, modes, and playable characters.[5] These changes include :

-   _Mario Kart 64_ introduces 4-player racing and 3D graphics.[6] This game also introduced Wario and Donkey Kong as playable characters, as well as seven new items: the Fake Item Box, Triple Red Shell, Triple Green Shell, Triple Mushroom, Banana Bunch, Golden Mushroom, and the infamous blue shell. In addition to the three Grand Prix engine classes, Mirror mode is introduced (tracks are flipped laterally) in 100cc.
-   _Mario Kart: Super Circuit_ introduces the ability to unlock all of the _Super Mario Kart_ tracks, as both games use the same mode 7 principle.
-   _Mario Kart: Double Dash_ features co-operative LAN play and two-player karts.[7] It also introduces eleven new playable characters (Princess Daisy, Birdo, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Paratroopa, Diddy Kong, Bowser Jr., Waluigi, Toadette, Petey Piranha, and King Boo). The game also features special items that are specific to each character, a feature that was previously accessible only to computer-controlled drivers in the original game. Finally, this game introduced unlockable characters and karts to the series. Mirror mode is bumped up to 150cc.
-   _Mario Kart DS_ features dual-screen play and introduces online multiplayer (via Wi-Fi) & retro battle arenas. Shy Guy (exclusive to DS Download Play), Dry Bones, and R.O.B. are introduced as playable characters. _DS_ was also the first _Mario Kart_ game to feature retro tracks from all previous titles of the series, as well as the only entry in the series to feature mission mode. It also introduces two new items: the Blooper and Bullet Bill.
-   _Mario Kart Wii_ introduces motion controls, performing tricks, 12-player racing, and motorbikes.[8] Six new playable characters were introduced : Baby Peach, Baby Daisy, Rosalina, Funky Kong, Dry Bowser, and two outfits for Mii characters. It also introduced three new items: the Mega Mushroom, Thunder Cloud, and POW Block.
-   _Mario Kart 7_ features stereoscopic 3D graphics, introduces hang gliding and submersible karts, as well as an alternate first-person perspective and kart customization.[9] Introduces Metal Mario, Lakitu, Wiggler, and Honey Queen as new playable characters. It is also the first _Mario Kart_ game after _Mario Kart: Double Dash_ not to feature Waluigi as a playable character.
-   _Mario Kart 8_ introduces 200cc mode, anti-gravity racing, ATVs, uploading highlights to YouTube via Mario Kart TV (exclusive to the Wii U version), up to four local players in Grand Prix races, downloadable content, and is the first in the series to boast HD graphics. _Mario Kart 8_ introduces the 7 Koopalings, Baby Rosalina, Pink Gold Peach, Tanooki Mario, Cat Peach, Villager and Isabelle from _Animal Crossing_, and Link from _The Legend of Zelda_ as new playable characters.[10] The Nintendo Switch version, _Mario Kart 8 Deluxe_, also adds the Inkling Girl and Inkling Boy from _Splatoon_ as playable characters for the first time in the series, as well as a new battle mode, "Renegade Roundup", which plays similarly to a game of tag.

Characters

_Mario Kart_ mainly features characters from the _Mario_ franchise. The _Mario Kart Arcade GP_ series features Bandai Namco characters such as Pac-Man.[11] The DLC for _Mario Kart 8_ added Link from _The Legend of Zelda_, and Villager and Isabelle from _Animal Crossing_.[12] _Mario Kart 8 Deluxe_ features 42 characters, including the Inklings from _Splatoon_.[13]

Courses

Many course themes recur throughout the series. Most are based on existing areas in the _Mario_ franchise (Bowser's Castle being among the most prominent), but there are a number of courses that have not appeared elsewhere, yet still belong in the Mushroom Kingdom, such as Rainbow Road.[14] Each game in the series (following the original game) includes at least 16 original courses and up to 6 original battle arenas.[15] Each game's tracks are divided into four "cups", or groups in which the player has to have the highest overall placing to win. Most courses can be done in three laps, except in the original game where all circuits required 5 laps to complete. The first game to feature courses from previous games was _Mario Kart: Super Circuit_, which contained all of the tracks from the original Super NES game. Starting with _Mario Kart DS_, each entry in the series has featured 16 "nitro" (brand new courses introduced for said game) and 16 "retro" tracks (reappearing courses from previous _Mario Kart_ games), spread across four cups each with four races. In _Mario Kart 8_, 16 additional tracks are available across two downloadable packages, eight for each package downloaded, including seven retro courses, four original courses, and five courses based on other Nintendo franchises, including _Excitebike_, _F-Zero_, _The Legend of Zelda_, and _Animal Crossing_.[16]

Modes of play

Each installment features a variety of different modes. The following four modes recur most often in the series:

-   GRAND PRIX – Players compete in various "cups," of four courses each (five in _Super Mario Kart_) with difficulty levels based on the size of the engine, larger engines meaning faster speeds. Before _Mario Kart 8_ there were four difficulties: 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, and 150cc Mirror (courses that see their circuits flipped horizontally). _Mario Kart 8_ added a fifth difficulty level: 200cc. Players earn points according to their finishing position in each race and the top three players with the most points overall will receive a trophy.
-   TIME TRIALS – The player races alone in order to finish any course in the fastest time possible. The best time is then saved as a ghost, which the player can race against in later trials. Since _Mario Kart: Double Dash_, a new function called Staff Ghosts is introduced, Staff Ghosts are members of the Nintendo team that set staff times for players to try and beat. Upon success, players will unlock Expert Staff Ghosts, which only appeared in _Mario Kart Wii_ and _Mario Kart 7_, which unlock characters, vehicles, or stamps once beaten, in addition to viewing ghost data.
-   VS RACE – Multiple human players race against each other on any course with customized rules such as team racing and item frequency. The mode also includes single-player VS races and CPU controlled players to compete in VS races as well since _Mario Kart DS_ (except for _Mario Kart 7_). _Super Circuit_, however, features a Quick Run mode, which shares similarities with VS mode.
-   BATTLE – Multiple human players use in-game offensive items (shells, etc) to battle each other in a closed arena. Each player starts with three balloons and loses a balloon with every hit sustained; the last player possessing at least one balloon wins. Different battle types were added as the series progressed, as well as single-player battles with CPU controlled players. Starting with _Mario Kart Wii_, there is a time limit for each battle. For _Mario Kart 8_, the battles take place on race courses. _Mario Kart 8 Deluxe_ reintroduces dedicated arenas.
-   ONLINE MULTIPLAYER – Players are able to compete in races and battles through online services, such as Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, Nintendo Network, and Nintendo Switch Online. Players can also share Time Trial ghosts, and participate in tournaments. In races and battles, players are matched by VR (VS Rating) and BR (Battle Rating) respectively, which is a number between 0 and 99,999 (only 9,999 in _Mario Kart Wii_). Players gain or lose points based on their performance in a race or battle. The game attempts to match players with a similar rating.

Rental go-kart dispute

, Tokyo]] In September 2016, Nintendo filed an objection against the Japanese company MariCar, which rents go-karts modified for use on public roads in Tokyo along with costumes resembling Nintendo characters.[41] MariCar's English website warned customers not to throw "banana peels" or "red turtle shells".[42] The service is popular with tourists.[43]

Nintendo argued that the MariCar name was "intended to be mistaken for or confused with" _Mario Kart_, citing games commonly known by abbreviations in Japan, such as _Pokémon_ (for _Pocket Monsters_) and Sumabura (_Super Smash Bros._). In January 2017, the Japan Patent Office dismissed the objection, ruling that MariCar was not widely recognized as an abbreviation of _Mario Kart_.[44]

In February 2017, Nintendo sued MariCar over copyright infringement for renting unauthorized costumes of Nintendo characters and using their pictures to promote its business.[45] In September 2018, MariCar was ordered to stop using the characters and pay Nintendo ¥10 million in damages.[46]
