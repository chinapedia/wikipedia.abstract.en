YK-11 is a synthetic steroidal selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM).[1][2] It is a gene-selective partial agonist of the androgen receptor (AR) and does not induce the physical interaction between the NTD/AF1 and LBD/AF2 (known as the N/C interaction), which is required for full transactivation of the AR.[3][4] The drug has anabolic activity _in vitro_ in C2C12 myoblasts and shows greater potency than dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in this regard.[5]
