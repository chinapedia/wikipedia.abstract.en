_THE GOOD FIGHT_ is an American legal web television series produced for CBS's streaming service CBS All Access. It is CBS All Access's first original scripted series.[1] The series—created by Robert King, Michelle King, and Phil Alden Robinson—is a spin-off and sequel to _The Good Wife_, which was created by the Kings. The first season contains 10 episodes,[2] and premiered on February 19, 2017, with the first episode airing on CBS and the following nine episodes on CBS All Access.[3] The series was initially planned to air in May 2017, but was moved up after production delays forced CBS to postpone the premiere of the new series _Star Trek: Discovery_.[4]

The series follows Christine Baranski as Diane Lockhart, as she loses her employment after an enormous financial scam destroys the reputation of her goddaughter Maia (Rose Leslie) and Diane's savings, leading them to join Lucca Quinn (Cush Jumbo) at one of Chicago's preeminent law firms. The series stars Baranski, Leslie, Jumbo, Erica Tazel, Sarah Steele, Justin Bartha, Delroy Lindo, Nyambi Nyambi, Michael Boatman, and Audra McDonald, and features Paul Guilfoyle and Bernadette Peters in recurring roles. It is executive produced by Robert King, Michelle King, Ridley Scott, David W. Zucker, Liz Glotzer, Brooke Kennedy and Alison Scott, with Phil Alden Robinson producing and co-writing the first episode.[5]

_The Good Fight_'s second season premiered on March 4, 2018, and its third season premiered on March 14, 2019.

On April 23, 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season.[6]

Starting on June 16, 2019, all 10 episodes of the first season began to air on CBS.[7]


Premise

A year after the finale of The Good Wife, an enormous financial scam destroys the reputation of young lawyer Maia and wipes out the savings of her mentor, Diane Lockhart. The two are forced out of Lockhart, Deckler, Gussman, Lee, Lyman, Gilbert-Lurie, Kagan, Tannebaum, & Associates and join Diane's former employee Lucca Quinn at Reddick, Boseman, & Kolstad, a prestigious African American–owned firm making waves by taking on Illinois police brutality cases. In season two, Diane becomes a name partner at the firm, which takes the name Reddick, Boseman & Lockhart.

The show primarily deals with the storylines of its three female leads – Diane, Lucca, and Maia – and contains considerable political and social commentary, exploring topical issues such as the alt-right, the Me Too movement, online harassment, and fake news. As well as starting again in a new firm with its own office politics to deal with, longtime Democrat Diane must navigate a world she hardly recognizes, becoming increasingly troubled by Trump-era politics and the actions of his administration. Lucca Quinn, a former employee of Diane's, has found firm footing at Reddick, Boseman & Lockhart and is a rising star on the partner track, balancing her dedication to her work and a romantic entanglement with US Attorney Colin Morello, a frequent opposing counsel. Meanwhile, Maia, Diane's goddaughter, is trying to get her legal career off to a good start, while coming under pressure from the FBI over alleged involvement with her father's Ponzi scheme.

Like _The Good Wife_, the show makes use of an extensive cast of supporting characters, including a recurring stable of opposing counsel, clients, police officers, FBI agents, judges, and politicians. Many are played by well-known guest stars.

Development

The_Good_Fight_poster.jpg In February 2016, Michelle and Robert King, when asked about a spin-off, stated that there was a possibility for a spin-off series.[31] In May 2016, CBS was in final negotiations to set up a spin-off featuring Christine Baranski reprising her role as Diane Lockhart, but which would air on CBS All Access instead of the network.[32] The spin-off was officially ordered to series on May 18, with Cush Jumbo returning as well.[33] In September 2016, it was confirmed that the 10 episode spin-off would premiere in February 2017, with the story picking up a year after the final episode of the original series and seeing Diane pushed out of her firm after a financial scam involving her mentee wipes out her savings, resulting in her move to Lucca Quinn's firm.[34] The series was initially planned to air in May 2017, but was moved to February 2017 after production delays forced CBS to postpone the premiere of the new series, _Star Trek: Discovery_.[35] After months of speculation, CBS revealed the title for the spin-off series, which was revealed to be _The Good Fight_, on October 31, 2016.[36] It was announced that _The Good Fight_ would premiere on February 19, 2017.[37] CBS released the first trailer for the spinoff on December 18, 2016, featuring footage from the premiere and later episodes.[38]

On March 15, 2017, CBS All Access renewed the show for a second season with an increased episode count of 13,[39][40] which premiered on March 4, 2018.[41] On May 2, 2018, the series was renewed for a third season.[42] In January 2019, it was announced that season 3 is set to premiere on the streaming platform on March 14, 2019.[43]

On April 23, 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season.[44]

Beginning with the season 2 finale, and more prominently in season 3, episodes have increasingly featured animated music video segments written by Jonathan Coulton and produced by Head Gear Animation, that discuss subjects relevant to an episode. Coulton had been involved in the Kings' previous series _BrainDead_, which featured musical recaps performed by the singer. The segments have drawn comparisons to the series _Schoolhouse Rock!_, albeit discussing topics such as the impeachment process, non-disclosure agreements, and Russian trolls. Coulton remarked he shared the Kings' "sensibility of really liking to mess with the form itself and poke through the fourth wall a little bit", and has received a relative amount of creative freedom in regards to the content of these interludes.[45][46] However, CBS requested the removal of a segment from a season 3 episode that discussed censorship in China. The network agreed to allow the inclusion of a placard informing viewers of the removed content.[47][48]

Casting

ROMY_2012_04_Christine_Baranski_crop.JPG plays the lead role of Diane Lockhart.]] In May 2016, CBS was in final negotiations with Christine Baranski to reprise her role as Diane Lockhart and Cush Jumbo to reprise her role as well.[49] After the series was picked up, it was announced that Jumbo would reprise her role as Lucca Quinn.[50] _Deadline_ announced on September 17, 2016 that Sarah Steele had been added to the cast, returning as Marissa Gold and appearing as Diane Lockhart's secretary-turned-investigator.[51] On October 12, 2016, it was announced that former _Game of Thrones_ star Rose Leslie had been cast to play a lead in the show, the role of Diane's goddaughter Maia who joins Diane's firm just after passing the bar.[52]

The day after, _The Hollywood Reporter_ announced that Delroy Lindo had been cast as "Robert" Boseman, an attorney who starts poaching Diane's associates and clients.[53] The first name of Lindo's character was changed to "Adrian".[54] _Deadline_ reported on October 27, 2016 that the show had added Paul Guilfoyle and Bernadette Peters for recurring roles as Maia's parents. Guilfoyle would play Maia's father Henry, a wildly successful financial advisor who is phenomenally wealthy and universally loved. Peters' character Lenore was described as a woman who came from a tough working-class background and is a natively brilliant financial whiz.[55] It was announced on October 31, 2016 that _Justified_ alum Erica Tazel had joined the cast as a series regular.[56]

On November 7, 2016, it was announced that Gary Cole would be reprising his role as Diane's husband Kurt McVeigh.[57] It was confirmed on November 11, 2016, that Zach Grenier, Jerry Adler, and Carrie Preston would be returning as guest stars, reprising their roles of David Lee, Howard Lyman, and Elsbeth Tascioni respectively.[58][59] On November 18, 2016, it was announced that Justin Bartha had been added as a series regular as Colin, a rising star in the US Attorney's office and love interest to Lucca.[60] On August 1, 2017, it was announced that Audra McDonald had been added to the main cast for season 2 as Liz Lawrence, reprising her role from _The Good Wife_ season 4, and that Michael Boatman and Nyambi Nyambi had been promoted to main cast.[61] On November 7, 2018, it was reported that Michael Sheen had joined the main cast for season 3.[62]


International broadcast

On February 8, 2017, the series was picked up in Canada by Corus Entertainment to air on their cable channel, W Network; the American broadcast premiere of the series would be simulcast by Corus' broadcast system Global.[63]

On March 2, 2017, Channel 4 confirmed it had acquired the UK broadcast rights for the series for its More4 channel following the success of progenitor series _The Good Wife_ on that same channel.[64] The series debuted on More4 on March 30, 2017.

HBO began airing all 10 episodes of the first season on June 1, 2017, in various European territories, while India's Zee Entertainment Enterprises obtained exclusive pay-TV rights to _The Good Fight_ for its English-language general entertainment channel Zee Café, which was also the Indian home of _The Good Wife_.[65]


Reception

Critical response

_The Good Fight_ has received widespread critical acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes awarded the first season with a rating of 98% based on reviews from 54 critics and an average rating of 8.18/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "An auspicious beginning for CBS All Access, _The Good Fight_ solidly follows its predecessor while allowing for new storytelling styles, a wider narrative scope, and a chance for its lead to explore new territory with a relatable human struggle."[66] On Metacritic, the first season received a score of 80 based on reviews from 25 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[67]

The _Los Angeles Times_ suggested that _Good Fight_ creators Robert and Michelle King "still had the _Good Wife_ magic" and though _Good Wife_ "had already [run] its course" after seasons 6 and 7 had received mediocre reviews, "they just needed a clean slate" to allow them to continue to mine more stories from that fictional universe.[68] In addition, unlike _Good Wife_ which was centered around "romantic tension" and got bogged down in Alicia Florrick's (Julianna Margulies) love life, _Good Fight_ was considered "refreshing for steering the story the other way" as relationships are "not the plot points that drive the story".[69] _Good Fight_ is regarded as a rare successful example of a TV series spin-off, as other contemporary TV series are either reboots or remakes.[70]

Writing for Vox.com, Emily VanDerWerff praised the show's deft use of political themes, commenting that while _The Good Wife_ was a commentary on "liberal hypocrisy" and the nature of moral compromise, _The Good Fight_ stands out as a much more earnest "defense of liberal values", giving the show a compelling "reason to exist".[71]

The second season has a 96% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 9.43/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Angry but still fun, _The Good Fight_ confidently elaborates on current political events with its deftly fictionalized plots."[72] On Metacritic, the second season received a score of 70 based on reviews from 5 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[73]

The third season has a 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "_The Good Fight_{{'s}} third season pulls no punches, doubling down on the social commentary while maintaining the show's sensational delights to create one of the best dramas on TV."[74] On Metacritic, the third season received a score of 83 based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[75]
