It is not possible for a modular graph to contain a cycle of odd length. For, if is a shortest odd cycle in a graph, is a vertex of , and is the edge of the cycle farthest from , there could be no median , for the only vertices on the shortest path are and themselves, but neither can belong to a shortest path from to the other without shortcutting and creating a shorter odd cycle. Therefore, every modular graph is a bipartite graph.[3]

The modular graphs contain as a special case the median graphs, in which every triple of vertices has a unique median;[4] median graphs are related to distributive lattices in the same way that modular graphs are related to modular lattices. However, the modular graphs also include other graphs such as the complete bipartite graphs where the medians are not unique: when the three vertices , , and all belong to one side of the bipartition of a complete bipartite graph, every vertex on the other side is a median.[5] Every chordal bipartite graph (a class of graphs that includes the complete bipartite graphs and the bipartite distance-hereditary graphs) is modular.[6]
