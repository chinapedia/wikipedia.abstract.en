In organic chemistry, hydrocarbons (compounds composed of carbon and hydrogen) are divided into two classes: aromatic compounds and ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS (; G. _aleiphar_, fat, oil), also known as non-aromatic compounds. Aliphatics can be cyclic, but if a unique type of especially stable cyclic bond exists in the molecule, called a benzene ring, then it is considered to be an aromatic compound.[1] Aliphatic compounds can be saturated, like hexane, or unsaturated, like hexene and hexyne. Open-chain compounds (whether straight or branched) contain no rings of any type, and are thus aliphatic.


Structure

Aliphatic compounds can be saturated, joined by single bonds (alkanes), or unsaturated, with double bonds (alkenes) or triple bonds (alkynes). Besides hydrogen, other elements can be bound to the carbon chain, the most common being oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine.

The least complex aliphatic compound is methane (CH₄).


Properties

Most aliphatic compounds are flammable, allowing the use of hydrocarbons as fuel, such as methane in Bunsen burners and as liquefied natural gas (LNG), and ethyne (acetylene) in welding.


Examples of Aliphatic Compounds / Non-Aromatic

The most important aliphatic compounds are:

-   n-, iso- and cyclo-alkANes (saturated hydrocarbons)
-   n-, iso- and cyclo-alkENes and -alkYNes (unsaturated hydrocarbons).

Important examples of low-molecular aliphatic compounds can be found in the list below (sorted by the number of carbon-atoms):
