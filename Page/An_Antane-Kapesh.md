AN ANTANE KAPESH (1926-2004), who also went by the French name ANNE(-MARIE) ANDRÉ, was an Innu writer and activist from Schefferville, Quebec. She was a chief at Schefferville (Matimekosh) from 1965-1967.[1]

In 1976, she published the autobiographical book _Je suis une maudite sauvagesse/Eukuan nin matshimanitu innu-iskueu_ ("I am a damned savage woman") in a bilingual French-Innu edition. This book, which deals with topics such as loss of hunting territory, the residential school system and police brutality, may have been the first French-language book published by a First Nations woman in Quebec. The publication of books such as this, containing Innu text, has also been cited as an important factor in the cultural revival of the language; an Innu-language press (Éditions Innu) was soon founded and existed until 1993.[2]

Kapesh followed this book with another, _Tante nana etutamin mitassi? / Qu'as-tu fait de mon pays?_ ("What have you done with my country?") in 1979, told from the perspective of a fictionalized child. Although her writings would be an inspiration to subsequent Innu writers, they were not well received at the time of publication. According to the publisher, Bernard Assiniwi, _Je suis une maudite sauvagesse_ brought on a negative reaction from the reading public and subsequent planned volumes in the series were canceled.[3]
