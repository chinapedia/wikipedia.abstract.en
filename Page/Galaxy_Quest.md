_GALAXY QUEST_ is a 1999 American science fiction action comedy film directed by Dean Parisot and written by David Howard and Robert Gordon. A parody of science-fiction films and series, especially _Star Trek_ and its fandom, the film stars Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell, and Daryl Mitchell. The film depicts the cast of a defunct cult television series called _Galaxy Quest_ who are suddenly visited by actual aliens who believe the series to be an accurate documentary, and become involved in a very real intergalactic conflict.

The film was a modest box office success and was positively received by critics: it won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (an award previously won by the original _Star Trek_ series in the 1960s) and the Nebula Award for Best Script, and was also nominated for 10 Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film, Best Director for Parisot, Best Actress for Weaver, and Best Supporting Actor for Rickman, with Allen winning Best Actor.[1][2]

_Galaxy Quest_ went on to achieve cult status through the years, especially from _Star Trek_ fans for its affectionate parody, but also to more mainstream audiences as a comedy film in its own right.[3][4][5] Several former cast and crew members of _Star Trek_ also went on to praise the film.[6] It was included in _Reader's Digest_{{'}}s list of The Top 100+ Funniest Movies of All Time in 2012, while _Star Trek_ fans voted it the seventh best _Star Trek_ film of all time in 2013.[7][8][9][10][11]


Plot

The cast members of the canceled space-adventure television series _Galaxy Quest_ spend most of their days attending fan conventions and promotional stunts. Though the series' former lead star Jason Nesmith thrives on the attention, the other cast members resent him and – to varying degrees – the state of their careers.

During a convention, Jason is approached by a group calling themselves Thermians, led by Mathesar, who request his help; believing this to be for a promotional appearance, he agrees to be picked up the next morning. Jason is hung over when he is picked up and doesn't grasp that he's been transported to a working recreation of the bridge of the NSEA _Protector_, the starship from _Galaxy Quest_. Believing that he's play acting, he gives half-hearted orders as captain, directing them to attack his enemy General Sarris, temporarily defeating him. When the Thermians transport him back to Earth, he realizes that it was real. He attempts to relate his adventure to the other cast members, but is rebuffed. When the Thermian Laliari appears and requests Jason's help further, he convinces the cast to join him.

Once aboard the _Protector_, the group learns that the Thermians received transmissions of _Galaxy Quest_ in space, and thought they were historical documentaries. Inspired by the crew's adventures, the Thermians restructured their society to reflect the virtues of the show, including manufacturing a functioning replica of the _Protector_. When Sarris attacks the ship, the group flees through a field of magnetic mines. Though they escape Sarris, the ship's beryllium sphere, its source of power, is damaged. They detect beryllium on a nearby planet, and the humans travel to the surface to retrieve a new sphere. After a series of mishaps, they are successful, but in their absence Sarris takes over the _Protector_. Jason confesses to Sarris that he is not the ship's commander, and shows him the "historical documents" of _Galaxy Quest_; Sarris realizes what they truly are and forces Jason to explain them to a heartbroken Mathesar. Sarris orders the _Protector's_ self-destruct activated and returns to his ship, leaving the crew to die.

The humans formulate a plan to abort the self-destruct and defeat Sarris' men left on the ship. With the aid of a _Galaxy Quest_ fan on Earth named Brandon – using a genuine Thermian communicator Jason had accidentally swapped for Brandon's prop – and his network of friends who possess intimate knowledge of the show, Jason and Gwen make their way to the ship's core and shut down the self-destruct sequence, while Alexander leads the Thermians in fighting back against Sarris' forces. The humans take back command of the _Protector_ and fly to confront Sarris. With their renewed confidence in their abilities, the crew flies through the minefield again but evade the mines, causing them to drag behind the ship. The _Protector_ flies straight at Sarris' ship, maneuvering away at the last second, tricking him into flying into the mines and obliterating his ship.

The _Protector_ travels to Earth to return the humans home, but Sarris, who escaped his vessel's destruction, ambushes them and fatally wounds several crew members. Jason activates the "Omega 13", a secret superweapon on the _Protector_ that had never been used and never had its capabilities explained; the device causes a thirteen second time warp to the past, giving Jason and Mathesar the chance to disarm Sarris before he attacks. The _Protector_{{'}}s bridge splits from the main vessel to fly to Earth with the humans, while the main section departs with Mathesar leading the Thermians. With Brandon acting as a beacon, the _Protector_ bridge crashes at the _Galaxy Quest_ convention, where the crowd assumes it was a publicity stunt. As the humans climb out, Sarris revives and Jason shoots him, blasting him into atoms, and the cast basks in the adoration of Brandon, his pals, and their fans.

Some time later, _Galaxy Quest_ is revived as a sequel series, _Galaxy Quest: The Journey Continues_, with the crew reprising their roles.

Production

Writing

The original script by David Howard was titled _Captain Starshine_ and written on spec. Producer Mark Johnson, who had a first look deal with DreamWorks, did not like it, but was still fascinated with its concept featuring space aliens who misconstrue old episodes of a television series. Johnson purchased the script and had Bob Gordon rewrite it into _Galaxy Quest_.[12] A fan of _Star Trek_, Gordon was hesitant, believing _Galaxy Quest_ "could be a great idea or it could be a terrible idea" and initially turned it down. He submitted his first draft to DreamWorks in 1998, which was immediately greenlit.

Rickman's character was originally supposed to have been knighted by Elizabeth II before the events of the film. Rickman requested this to be changed, as he felt that it would not fit Dane's sentiment of lack of recognition; the character is still credited as "Sir Alexander Dane" in the credits, although all mentions of being a knight have been removed from the film.[13][14]

The Thermians' native planet, Klaatu Nebula, is a reference to the name of the alien visitor in the classic _The Day the Earth Stood Still_ (1951).[15]

The name of Rockwell's character, Guy Fleegman, is a homage to Guy Vardaman, a little-known _Star Trek_ actor who worked extensively on _Star Trek_ as either a stand-in or in minor roles.[16]

The romantic relationship between Fred Kwan and the alien Laliari comes from a suggestion of Steven Spielberg, one of the owners of DreamWorks, impressed by Missi Pyle while visiting the set, to expand Missi Pyle's role in the film.[17][18]

Crew and casting

Since early in the production, Mark Johnson wanted Dean Parisot, who had directed _Home Fries_, another film he produced, to direct _Galaxy Quest_; however, DreamWorks favored Harold Ramis because of his experience. Ramis was hired in November 1998,[19] but departed in February 1999 because of casting difficulties. He wanted Alec Baldwin for the lead role, but Baldwin turned it down. Steve Martin and Kevin Kline were considered, though Kline turned it down for family reasons. Ramis did not agree with the casting of Tim Allen as Jason Nesmith, and Parisot took over as director within three weeks. After seeing the film, Ramis said he was ultimately impressed with Allen's performance.[20] About his role, Allen stated that he based his performance on Yul Brynner instead of William Shatner.[21]

Linda DeScenna, production designer of the film, was interested in the project because it would not have the same aesthetics as other 1990s science fiction films, and "it didn't have to be real, hi-tech and vacuformed".[22] The design of the Thermian station was influenced by the works of artist Roger Dean, especially his cover art for the Yes live album _Yessongs_ (1973).[23]

The makers of the film wanted only "science fiction virgins" who had never worked in this genre to audition for Gwen DeMarco's role. Famous for science fiction roles such as Ellen Ripley in the _Alien_ films and Dana Barrett in the _Ghostbusters_ films, Weaver auditioned nonetheless because she wanted to work with both Allen and Rickman, and because she "fell in love with the script", calling it "that great sort of _Wizard of Oz_ story of these people feeling so incomplete in the beginning, and then during the course of this adventure, they come out almost like the heroes they pretended to be in the first place";[24] she was surprised when discovering she actually got the role.[25]

Tony Shalhoub originally auditioned for Guy Fleegman, but Sam Rockwell won the role, and Shalhoub was cast as Fred Kwan instead.[26] Justin Long said he was nervous auditioning as an unknown actor at the time, competing against Kieran Culkin, Eddie Kaye Thomas and Tom Everett Scott for the role of Brandon. Paul Rudd auditioned for a role, while David Alan Grier was the second choice for Tommy Webber.[27] The film was Justin Long's acting debut, and Rainn Wilson's film debut (his only previous credit was the soap opera _One Life to Live_).[28]

According to casting director Debra Zane, finding an actress to play the role of Laliari was very hard, as they had "a difficult time finding a woman who could be Thermian in the same way as actors Enrico Colantoni, Rainn Wilson and Jed Rees". Ultimately, when she auditioned Missi Pyle, she was so impressed that she sent the audition tape directly to Parisot, with a note stating "If this is not Laliari, I will resign from the CSA."[29] Steven Spielberg later asked for Laliari's role to be expanded after being impressed by her performance as well.[30] Jennifer Coolidge was the second choice for the role.[31]

Both Allen and Rockwell almost dropped out of the film; Allen had to choose between _Galaxy Quest_ and _Bicentennial Man_ and chose the first, with his _Bicentennial Man_ role going to Robin Williams instead, while Rockwell almost backed out of the film after obtaining a lead role in an independent film; Kevin Spacey convinced him otherwise.[32][33]

Filming

Scenes on the barren planet where the crew stops to obtain a new beryllium sphere and Captain Nesmith battles a rock monster were filmed at Goblin Valley State Park in Utah.[34] At the time, access to the park was partly by dirt road; fees paid by the production company were used to upgrade the entire access road to asphalt pavement.

According to Weaver, Allen hectored her to sign a piece of the Nostromo, the spaceship from _Alien_, in which she had starred; she ultimately did, writing "Stolen by Tim Allen; Love, Sigourney Weaver," which she claims upset him greatly.[35]

During the period of filming, the entire cast attended a 20th-anniversary screening of _Alien_. After filming wrapped, Weaver kept the wig she wore for the role.[36]

Post-production

In theaters, the first 20 minutes of the film were presented in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, before changing to a wider 2.35:1 ratio when the spaceship lands on Thermia to maximise the effect on viewers.[37][38] David Newman composed the music score.

The film originally received an "R" rating, according to _Galaxy Quest_ producer Lindsey Collins and Sigourney Weaver,[39] before being recut. Shalhoub did not remember any darker version of the film.[40] There were numerous edits in the film that show some lines were changed in post-production. In one scene, Gwen DeMarco's line "Well, screw that!" is clearly dubbed over "Well, fuck that!"[41][42][43][44][45] According to Parisot, that line got a huge laugh.[46] There is more profanity found in the shooting script.[47]

Promotion

Before the release of the movie, a promotional mockumentary video titled _Galaxy Quest: 20th Anniversary, The Journey Continues_, aired on E!, presenting the _Galaxy Quest_ television series as an actual cult series, and the upcoming film as a documentary about the making of the series, presenting it in a similar way to _Star Trek_; it featured fake interviews of the series' cast (portrayed by the actors of the actual film), "Questerians", and critics.[48]

Relation to _Star Trek_

_Galaxy Quest_ is an acknowledged homage to _Star Trek_; therefore a variety of elements in the former correspond to those of the latter. The television program within the film, _Galaxy Quest_, is set on the starship NSEA _Protector_, an instrument of the National Space Exploration Administration, which are parodies of the USS _Enterprise_ (NCC-1701) and Starfleet respectively. The prefix of the _Protector_{{'}}s registration number NTE-3120 ostensibly alludes to some sort of similar space federation, but in reality stands for "Not The Enterprise", according to visual effects co-supervisor Bill George in a 2000 interview with _Cinefex_ magazine.[49]

This homage also extended to the original marketing of the movie, including a promotional website[50] intentionally designed to look like a poorly constructed fan website, with "screen captures" and poor HTML coding. The homage even parodied the effect that _Star Trek_ had on the social lives of its cast members, such as how Alexander Dane (played by Alan Rickman) has been typecast after his success on the _Galaxy Quest_ television series; this reflects the lamentations of Leonard Nimoy, who had been typecast after his performance as Spock.

Additionally, the time between the original _Galaxy Quest_ series and its sequel, _Galaxy Quest: The Journey Continues_ is 17 years, the same amount of time that elapsed between the original _Star Trek_ series and _Star Trek: The Next Generation_.

The film's visual effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic, which had a long history with _Star Trek_.


Reception

Box office

The film was financially successful. It earned US$7,012,630 in its opening weekend, and its total U.S. domestic tally stands at US$71,583,916; in total it has grossed US$90,683,916 worldwide.[51]

Critical reception

_Galaxy Quest_ received positive reviews from critics, both as a parody of _Star Trek_, and as a comedy film of its own. On Rotten Tomatoes, it received an approval rating of 90% based on 116 reviews and an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Intelligent and humorous satire with an excellent cast; no previous Trekkie knowledge needed to enjoy this one."[52] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 70 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[53]

_The New York Times_{{'}}s Lawrence Van Gelder called it "an amiable comedy that simultaneously manages to spoof these popular futuristic space adventures and replicate the very elements that have made them so durable".[54] Roger Ebert praised the ability of the film to spoof the "illogic of the TV show".[55] _The Village Voice_ offered a lukewarm review, noting that "the many eight- to 11-year-olds in the audience seemed completely enthralled".[56]

Impact and legacy

The film proved quite popular with _Star Trek_ fans. At the 2013 Star Trek Convention in Las Vegas, _Galaxy Quest_ received enough support in a _Star Trek_ Film Ranking to be included with the twelve Star Trek films that had been released at the time on the voting ballot. The fans at the convention ranked it the seventh best _Star Trek_ film.[60][61]

Harold Ramis, who was originally supposed to direct the film but left following disagreements over the casting choices, notably Allen as the lead, was ultimately impressed with Allen's performance.[62] Tim Allen later stated that he and William Shatner were "now friends because of this movie".[63]

The novella _Rabbit Remembered_ (2000) by John Updike mentions the character of Laliari from the film.[64]

Reaction from _Star Trek_ actors

Several actors who have had roles on various _Star Trek_ television series and films have commented on _Galaxy Quest_ in light of their own experiences with the franchise and its fandom.

Merchandising and tie-ins

-   In November 1999, _Galaxy Quest_ was novelized by science fiction writer Terry Bisson,[65] who stayed very close to the plot of the film.
-   In December 1999, the US entertainment channel E! featured a mockumentary entitled _Galaxy Quest: 20th Anniversary, The Journey Continues_, concerning the making of the _Galaxy Quest_ television series.
-   In 2008, IDW Publishing released a comic book sequel to the movie entitled _Galaxy Quest: Global Warning_. In January 2015, IDW launched an ongoing series set several years after the events of the film.
-   On May 12, 2009, a Deluxe Edition Blu-ray was released.[66]

Proposed sequel or television series

Talks of a sequel have been going on since the film's release in 1999, but only began gaining traction in 2014 when Allen mentioned that there was a script. Stars Weaver and Rockwell mentioned they were interested in returning.[67] However, Colantoni has stated that he would prefer for there not to be a sequel, lest it tarnish the characters from the first film. He said, "to make something up, just because we love those characters, and turn it into a sequel—then it becomes the awful sequel".[68]

In April 2015, Paramount Television, along with the movie's co-writer Gordon, director Parisot, and executive producers Johnson and Bernstein, announced they were looking to develop a television series based on _Galaxy Quest_. The move was considered in a similar vein as Paramount's revivals of _Minority Report_ and _School of Rock_ as television series.[69] In August 2015, it was announced that Amazon Studios would be developing it.[70]

In January 2016, after the unexpected death of Alan Rickman from pancreatic cancer, Tim Allen commented in _The Hollywood Reporter_ about the franchise's chance of a revival:

Speaking to the Nerdist podcast in April 2016, Sam Rockwell revealed that the cast had been about ready to sign on for a follow up with Amazon, but that Rickman's death, together with Allen's television schedule, had proved to be obstacles, and that he believed that Rickman's death meant the project would never happen.[71]

However, the plans were revived in August 2017, with the announcement that Paul Scheer would be writing the series.[72] Speaking to _Galaxy_Quest//Film_, Scheer said that in his first drafts submitted to Amazon in November 2017, he wanted to created a serialized adventure that starts where the film ends, but leads into the cultural shift in _Star Trek_ that has occurred since 1999; he said "I really wanted to capture the difference between the original cast of _Star Trek_ and the J. J. Abrams cast of _Star Trek_." To that end, Scheer's initial scripts called for two separate cast sets that would come together by the end of the first season of the show, though he did not confirm if this included any of the original film's cast.[73]

Following the dismissal of Amy Powell as president of Paramount Television in July 2018, Scheer stated that the _Galaxy Quest_ series had been put on hold while Paramount's management was being re-established, but anticipated the show would continue forward after that. Scheer further said that they were making the series to allow the introduction of new characters while extending the setting, similar to what _Star Wars: The Force Awakens_ did for _A New Hope_.[74]
