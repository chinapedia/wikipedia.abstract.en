This is a LIST OF THE BIRD SPECIES RECORDED IN ARUBA. The avifauna of Aruba has 219 confirmed species, of which four have been introduced by humans and 91 are rare or vagrants (including two species introduced elsewhere in the region). Two have been extirpated. None are endemic. One additional species is hypothetical (see below).

Except as an entry is cited otherwise, the list of species is that of the South American Classification Committee (SACC) of the American Ornithological Society.[1] The list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families, and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) are also those of the SACC.[2]

The following tags have been used to highlight certain categories of occurrence.

-   (V) VAGRANT - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Aruba
-   (I) INTRODUCED - a species introduced to Aruba as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions
-   (H) HYPOTHETICAL - a species recorded but with "no tangible evidence" according to the SACC
