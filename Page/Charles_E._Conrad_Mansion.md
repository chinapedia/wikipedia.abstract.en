The CHARLES E. CONRAD MANSION is a historical Victorian era shingle-style Norman mansion located in Kalispell, Montana. It was designed by the noted Spokane, Washington, architect Kirtland Cutter. It was the home of Charles E. Conrad, a late 19th century shipping magnate and early pioneer of Kalispell. In addition to shipping, over the course of his career Conrad was involved in a number of different businesses including real estate, banking, cattle ranching, and mining.[1]


Style and construction

The style of the architecture is a revivalist version of the vernacular farmhouse style of the architecture of Normandy in France, rather than the version of Romanesque architecture called "Norman architecture". Construction of the home began in 1892 and it was completed in November 1895.[2]
