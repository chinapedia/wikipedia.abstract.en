The MAIN NATIONAL LIBERATION COMMITTEE FOR SERBIA[1] () was the body of the "National Liberation Movement" (the Yugoslav Communists and Yugoslav Partisans) in German-occupied Serbia, recognized within the movement as the civilian government in Serbia. It was established in October or November 1941, active during the Republic of Užice, a short-lived liberated territory in western Serbia in the second half of 1941, and in 1944–45 during the liberation of Yugoslavia.

According to V. Vinterhalter, the "Main National Liberation Committee for Serbia" was established on 16 October in liberated Užice.[2] A letter issued by Tito on 16 November stresses that a "Central Committee for all of the liberated territory ... had now been established" in Užice. The organization was thus called the CENTRAL COMMITTEE FOR LIBERATED TERRITORY (_Centralni odbor za oslobođenu teritoriju_). The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CK KPJ) appointed the Committee on 17 November. Its establishment had been initiated by the leadership of the National Liberation Movement for Serbia, with consent of the National Liberation Movement of Yugoslavia (_NOP Jugoslavije_, the war-time KPJ). The President was Dragojlo Dudić, and Secretary was Petar Stambolić. The organization did not hold any official assemblies. The organization became defunct with the renewed German occupation, only to resurface in November 1944 as the "Main National Liberation Committee for Serbia" ().
