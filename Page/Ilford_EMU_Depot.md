History

Until a remodel, as part of Crossrail works, in 2016 Ilford had four sheds, the first two of which were opened in 1949 for DC EMUs, and converted to AC in 1960. These were a six-track with four through-roads shed, and a three-road dead-ended shed. The third building is the largest, opened in 1960 for AC EMUs, being a sixteen-road dead-ended shed. The fourth building is a one-track through-road shed which was opened around 2000.[3]

Around 1987, the depot's allocation included classes 302, 305, 306, 307, 308 and 315 EMUs.[4]

Until 1947 the Fairlop Loop ran, via the northern perimeter of the yard, from Ilford railway station to Woodford tube station
