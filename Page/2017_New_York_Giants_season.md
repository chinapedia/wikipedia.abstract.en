The 2017 NEW YORK GIANTS SEASON was the franchise's 93rd season in the National Football League, the eighth playing their home games at MetLife Stadium and the second and final under head coach Ben McAdoo. Coming fresh off an 11–5 season from one year ago, the Giants had high hopes of a Super Bowl championship and were an expected playoff contender by many critics. However, things quickly fell apart after key injuries and controversial decisions towards the team. A disastrous and unexpected 0–5 start to their season (their second in 5 years), coupled with major injuries to the team, including star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., had the Giants suffer to a franchise worst 3–13 record. By Week 10, after losing to the previously winless 49ers, the Giants were standing at 1–8, their worst record since 1980. The Giants were officially eliminated from playoff contention on November 26, 2017 when the Falcons defeated the Buccaneers 34–20, the Panthers defeated the Jets 35–27 and the Eagles defeated the Bears 31–3.

On November 28, it was announced that Geno Smith was to start against the Raiders, which snapped Eli Manning's 210 consecutive games started streak, the longest in the NFL at the time. It started controversy, with present and former teammates, opponents, fans, executives, and television and radio show hosts coming into Manning's defense. The benching of Eli also led to speculation he would possibly join the Jacksonville Jaguars, which would reunite him with former Giants coach Tom Coughlin, whom works for the team as their executive vice president of football operations. With that move, the Giants became the last team in the NFL to have started an African-American quarterback in at least one game.[1] After a 24–17 loss to the Raiders in Week 13, with the Giants standing at 2–10, both Ben McAdoo and general manager Jerry Reese were fired, leaving Steve Spagnuolo as the interim head coach and Kevin Abrams as the interim general manager. These were the first mid-season staff firings since the 1976 season.[2] Manning was then renamed the starter for the Week 14 game against the Cowboys.

A 30–10 loss to the Dallas Cowboys in Week 14 dropped the Giants to 2–11 surpassing the most losses in the Eli Manning era with 10 losses (2004, 2014, and 2015). With a 34-29 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 15, the Giants tied the record of losses they set before (12) falling to 2–12, but after a 23–0 loss to the Cardinals in Week 16, the Giants fell to 2–13, setting a new record for most losses in a single season in franchise history, eclipsing the previous record of 12, done five times in franchise history: 1966, 1974, 1980, 1983 and 2003 and the worst under a 16-game schedule format. The Giants at the end defeated the Washington Redskins ultimately finish the season at 3–13.

The Giants 3–13 record was their worst record in a 16-game season in franchise history, their worst winning percentage since 1974, the worst record in the Eli Manning era, their worst record since 2003, finished last place in the NFC East for the first time since 2003, and second-worst in the league behind the Cleveland Browns. The Giants also went 1–11 against the NFC in 2017 and 1–5 against the NFC East. In the process, the Giants acquired the 2nd pick of the 2018 NFL Draft.

On December 29, 2017, Dave Gettleman was hired as the new general manager for the team. Gettleman quickly address the offensive line issues which led to the release of offensive tackle Bobby Hart and the benching of 2015 1st rounder Ereck Flowers. Flowers started all games to this point being the only consistent starter on the offensive line.

NOTES

-   The Giants' original fourth-round selection was moved to the back of the fourth round, after all of the compensatory selections, but no more than 12 picks after where their pick would have been positioned, as part of the punishment for illegal use of a walkie-talkie on their sideline during week 14 of the season.

Regular season

The Giants came into their season fresh from their 2016 campaign when they went 11-5. However, with key injuries and course starter controversies, and a disastrous 0-5 start, the Giants fell apart and finished their campaign at a disappointing 3-13 record. After a 31-21 loss to the previously winless San Francisco 49ers, the Giants were at 1-8, their worst record since going 1-9 in 1980. After losing to the Washington Redskins on Thanksgiving Day in Week 12, the Giants were mathematically eliminated from playoff contention three days later after the Panthers defeated the Jets 35-27 and their rival Eagles defeated the Bears 31-3.

Quarterback Eli Manning's benching snapped a record 210 games started by Manning, with Geno Smith playing as starter against the Raiders. After a 24-17 loss to the Raiders, it was revealed that both head coach Ben McAdoo and GM Jerry Reese were relieved of their duties with the Giants, with Steve Spagnuolo and Kevin Abrams as the interim head coach and GM, accounted for the first mid-season staff firings since the 1976 season; Manning was back in starting position in Week 14 against the Cowboys. In a 34-29 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 15, the Giants tied their record of losses they set five times before, but after a 23-0 loss to the Cardinals, the Giants were shutout for the first time since Week 6 of the 2014 season and broke the record for losses in franchise history previously set by the Giants teams of 1966, 1974, 1980, 1983 and 2003 where they have lost only twelve games each. The Giants close out the season 3-13, the worst record in 16 games and at the bottom of the NFC East for the first time since 2003.

Game summaries

Week 1: at Dallas Cowboys

Odell Beckham was declared out before the game due to his ankle injury. The loss of Beckham was too steep for the Giants to overcome who barely mustered 200 yards. The Cowboys set the pace early and were on the field for 47 plays in the first half. The loss dropped the Giants to 0-1. They are 1-9 in Week 1 games against the Cowboys, with their only win coming in 2016.

Week 2: vs. Detroit Lions

Even with a limited Odell Beckham Jr. the Giants struggled mightily against the Lions. Rookie tight end Evan Engram scored his first career touchdown. However, an 88-yard punt return touchdown sealed the Giants fate. With the loss, the Giants dropped to 0-2.

Week 3: at Philadelphia Eagles

A huge rally in the 4th quarter was overshadowed by rookie kicker Jake Elliott when he kicked a game winning 61-yard field goal to drop the Giants to 0-3 and their fourth straight loss in Philadelphia. It was the longest game winning field goal as time expired since 2006.

Week 4: at Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Just like in Philadelphia, the Giants were beaten by a game winning field goal to drop to 0-4.

Week 5: vs. Los Angeles Chargers

The Giants suffered a ton of injuries throughout the game including star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. It was later revealed he fractured his fibula. The Giants blew a 4th quarter lead and dropped to 0–5 for the first time since 2013. This was their fourth straight loss to the Chargers as Eli Manning's Giants never beat the team that drafted him 1st overall and sent him to the Giants in exchange for Philip Rivers in the 2004 Draft.

Week 6: at Denver Broncos

With numerous injuries in the receiving core from the Week 5 game and against a heavily favored Broncos team, the Giants pulled a massive upset to snap a 5-game losing streak and defeat Denver for the first time since 2005. This is also Manning's first career win in Denver. Janoris Jenkins returned a Trevor Siemian interception for a touchdown in the win, his first as a member of the Giants and Orleans Darkwa had his first 100-yard game.

Week 7: vs. Seattle Seahawks

This game was the first time the Giants played an intraconference game on CBS since the 1993 season finale on January 2, 1994 against the Cowboys (before Fox took over the NFC contract in the 1994 season). The Giants defense played well in the first half, aided by an NFL record 10 play goal line stand, but unraveled in the second half as they tired out. They couldn't be saved by their weak wide receiving corps, along with a struggling run game that sealed their fate. With the loss, the Giants fell to 1-6 and lost to the Seahawks for the 4th straight time.

Week 9: vs. Los Angeles Rams

A bunch of miscues and 3 turnovers from the offense led the Rams dominate the entire game. The Giants allowed 51 points, the most points allowed at home since 1964 against the Cleveland Browns. The loss also dropped the Giants 1-7. This was the first loss to the Rams since 2001 and their first home loss to the Rams since 2000. This was also the most points the Giants allowed since they lost 52–49 to the Saints in 2015.

Despite all the miscues, Eli Manning became the 7th quarterback in NFL history to reach 50,000 career passing yards.

Week 10: at San Francisco 49ers

Attempting to get their second win of the season, the Giants were upset by the previously winless 49ers. Their defense was porous, allowing over 450 yards of offense. Despite Eli Manning finishing with a 113.9 passer rating, the Giants only had 13 points until a meaningless 4th quarter drive. The Giants dropped 1-8, their worst start since 1980.

Despite the loss, Eli Manning had his 208th consecutive start at quarterback, tying his brother Peyton Manning for 2nd in NFL history in that regard.

Week 11: vs. Kansas City Chiefs

Attempting to stop a 3-game losing streak, the Giants returned home to host the Kansas City Chiefs led by Alex Smith and Kareem Hunt. In a defensive battle, the Giants picked off the Chiefs 3 times and Roger Lewis made a 4th and 6 catch in the red zone to set up Aldrick Rosas kicked the game winning field goal in OT to improve the Giants to 2-8. This was the Giants first home win of the season.

Eli Manning made his 209th consecutive start at quarterback, passing Peyton Manning for 2nd in NFL history, only trailing Brett Favre (297).

Week 12: at Washington Redskins

NFL ON THANKSGIVING DAY The Giants offense struggled the entire game and was held to only one first down in the second half. The Giants dropped to 2-9 and were eliminated from playoff contention on the following Sunday after the Panthers defeated the Jets 35-27 and the Eagles defeated the Bears 31-3.

As he would be benched the next week, Eli Manning's streak of 210 consecutive starts by a quarterback is currently second in NFL history. As of the end of the 2017 season, Philip Rivers is the current quarterback iron man and is expected to finish the regular season with over 200 consecutive starts. The current NFL iron man across all positions is punter Shane Lechler, with over 250 consecutive games played.

Week 13: at Oakland Raiders

For the first time since November 2004, Eli Manning did not start the game in favor of Geno Smith in a moved that was universally panned by the football community. Present and former teammates, opponents, fans, executives, TV and radio show hosts quickly came to Manning's defense. It was also the first time a Manning did not start in an NFL game since Week 17 of the 1997 NFL season. An attempted comeback fell short dropping the Giants to 2-10, their worst record since 1976. Geno completed 21-34 passes for 212 yards and 1 touchdown and lost 2 redzone fumbles. The following day, the Giants announced that Head Coach Ben McAdoo and General Manager Jerry Reese had been relieved of their duties.

Week 14: vs. Dallas Cowboys

With Eli Manning back in the starting position, both the Giants and Cowboys were tied up at 10 heading into the 4th quarter until Dallas scored 20 unanswered points and shutout the struggling Giants offense in the 2nd half to drop the Giants to 2-11. This is the first time the Giants lost more than 10 games in a season since 2003 and first under the Eli Manning era.

Week 15: vs. Philadelphia Eagles

Poor special team mishaps and an attempted comeback that fell 6-yards short led the Eagles to win in a thriller of a game to drop the Giants to 2-12 despite the Giants going up 20-7 at one point and, tying their worst record since 1974. They also got swept by the Eagles which allowed them to clinch a first round bye, and the loss dropped the Giants to 0-5 in the division. Despite their miscues, the Giants dominated on offense going for just under 500 yards and Eli Manning had his best performance this season. With a Redskins 20-15 win over the Cardinals, the Giants secured a fourth place finish in the NFC East for the first time since 2003.

The Giants are now 4-14 against the Eagles despite leading the series 84-82-2.

Week 16: at Arizona Cardinals

Shutout for the first time since October 2014, the Giants offense couldn't get into the end zone and their only chance at points came on a missed field goal by Aldrick Rosas. The Giants dropped to 2-13 and clinched their worst record in franchise history.

Week 17: vs. Washington Redskins

The Giants defense only allowed 10 points and got 3 interceptions from Kirk Cousins along with sacking him 3 times. The Giants also had a surging run game with over 250 yards on the ground. Orleans Darkwa set a new career high with 154 yards. The Giants defeated the Redskins 18-10 to improve to 3-13. With the Colts beating the Texans that day, the Giants locked in the #2 pick in the 2018 NFL Draft.

This was the Giants' only win against a division rival or an NFC team during the season.
