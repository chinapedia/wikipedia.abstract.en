_SWORDIGO_ is a 2012 action-adventure platform game created by Finnish indie studio Touch Foo. The game is similar to _Zelda II: The Adventure of Link_, _Metroid_, and _Castlevania: Symphony of the Night_.[1]

Since its official release, the game has passed through several stages of polishing and has received many new updates for both platforms.


Gameplay

_Swordigo_ is a side-scrolling action-adventure game in which the player can run, jump, swing their sword, and use magic spells. By defeating enemies, the player will gain experience; upon leveling up, they can choose to upgrade one of their attributes (health, attack power, or magic.) They will also find new items and equipment that will make them more powerful and grant new abilities (bombs blow up certain walls, magic bolts activate buttons and hit enemies, etc.), additionally being able to buy items from shops using money reaped from defeated enemies, cutting plants, destroying boxes, and breaking vases. The player can bring up a map at any time, which keeps track of their location and the areas they have already visited; they will also find portals that will allow them to quickly backtrack to previous areas.


Plot

The player character awakens in the middle of the night feeling strange. He goes outside for a bit of fresh air, when a man tells him that his mentor went into the woods and has not come back. After visiting the woods, and seeing his master dead, he learns the first spell - Magic Bolt. After learning this spell, he is attacked and shot by a unique "Corruptor". The player is sent to the healer's house after that. The Elder tells him that he must find the Mageblade, and defeat the Corruptors.

After traveling the inhabited plains, the player is told by the same unique Corruptor that it shattered the Mageblade. After the battle in the Chamber, the rest of the game is spent looking for shards of the Mageblade, with four in total.

After collecting the shards, the player goes to the Chambers of Power to reassemble the blade again. Once this happens, the hero goes to the World's End Keep (the final area) to fight the center of evil corruption: the Master of Chaos.
