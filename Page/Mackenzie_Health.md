Funding

The MACKENZIE HEALTH FOUNDATION is the fundraising foundation for Mackenzie Health, responsible for obtaining donations from private donors. Established in 1977, it is responsible for acquiring the local funding for capital projects, for example the 10% of construction costs for Mackenzie Vaughan Hospital, as well as all funding for other capital projects and ancillary operational costs. Capital projects funded include the acquisition of medical and diagnostic equipment, for example a magnetic resonance imaging scanner.

Donors can specify their donation to be allocated to a specific purpose.

The MACKENZIE HEALTH VOLUNTEER ASSOCIATION is a community fundraising association that raises funds via community events, for example its annual dance held since 1993. The dance has raised over $500,000 since its inception, and has partially funded the acquisition of surgical equipment and a digital mammography unit, and the establishment of the Intensive Care Unit and the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
