]] A TROLL is a class of being in Norse mythology and Scandinavian folklore. In Old Norse sources, beings described as trolls dwell in isolated rocks, mountains, or caves, live together in small family units, and are rarely helpful to human beings.

Later, in Scandinavian folklore, trolls became beings in their own right, where they live far from human habitation, are not Christianized, and are considered dangerous to human beings. Depending on the source, their appearance varies greatly; trolls may be ugly and slow-witted, or look and behave exactly like human beings, with no particularly grotesque characteristic about them.

Trolls are sometimes associated with particular landmarks, which at times may be explained as formed from a troll exposed to sunlight. Trolls are depicted in a variety of media in modern popular culture.


Etymology

The Old Norse nouns _troll_ and _tröll_ (variously meaning "fiend, demon, werewolf, jötunn") and Middle High German _troll, trolle_ "fiend" (according to philologist Vladimir Orel likely borrowed from Old Norse) developed from Proto-Germanic neuter noun *_trullan_. The origin of the Proto-Germanic word is unknown.[1] Additionally, the Old Norse verb _trylla_ 'to enchant, to turn into a troll' and the Middle High German verb _trüllen_ "to flutter" both developed from the Proto-Germanic verb *_trulljanan_, a derivative of *_trullan_.[2]


Norse mythology

In Norse mythology, _troll_, like _thurs_, is a term applied to _jötnar_ and is mentioned throughout the Old Norse corpus. In Old Norse sources, trolls are said to dwell in isolated mountains, rocks, and caves, sometimes live together (usually as father-and-daughter or mother-and-son), and are rarely described as helpful or friendly.[3] The _Prose Edda_ book _Skáldskaparmál_ describes an encounter between an unnamed troll woman and the 9th-century skald Bragi Boddason. According to the section, Bragi was driving through "a certain forest" late one evening when a troll woman aggressively asked him who he was, in the process describing herself:

Bragi responds in turn, describing himself and his abilities as a skillful skald, before the scenario ends.[7]

There is much confusion and overlap in the use of Old Norse terms _jötunn_, _troll_, _þurs_, and _risi_, which describe various beings. Lotte Motz theorized that these were originally four distinct classes of beings: lords of nature (_jötunn_), mythical magicians (_troll_), hostile monsters (_þurs_), and heroic and courtly beings (_risi_), the last class being the youngest addition. On the other hand, Ármann Jakobson is critical of Motz's interpretation and calls this theory "unsupported by any convincing evidence".[8] Ármann highlights that the term is used to denote various beings, such as a jötunn or mountain-dweller, a witch, an abnormally strong or large or ugly person, an evil spirit, a ghost, a _blámaðr_, a magical boar, a heathen demi-god, a demon, a brunnmigi, or a berserker.[9]


Scandinavian folklore

, 1906.]] Later in Scandinavian folklore, trolls become defined as a particular type of being.[10] Numerous tales are recorded about trolls in which they are frequently described as being extremely old, very strong, but slow and dim-witted, and are at times described as man-eaters and as turning to stone upon contact with sunlight.[11] However, trolls are also attested as looking much the same as human beings, without any particularly hideous appearance about them, but living far away from human habitation and generally having "some form of social organization"—unlike the _rå_ and _näck_, who are attested as "solitary beings". According to John Lindow, what sets them apart is that they are not Christian, and those who encounter them do not know them. Therefore, trolls were in the end dangerous, regardless of how well they might get along with Christian society, and trolls display a habit of _bergtagning_ ('kidnapping'; literally "mountain-taking") and overrunning a farm or estate.[12]

Lindow states that the etymology of the word "troll" remains uncertain, though he defines trolls in later Swedish folklore as "nature beings" and as "all-purpose otherworldly being[s], equivalent, for example, to fairies in Anglo-Celtic traditions". They "therefore appear in various migratory legends where collective nature-beings are called for". Lindow notes that trolls are sometimes swapped out for cats and "little people" in the folklore record.[13]

A Scandinavian folk belief that lightning frightens away trolls and jötnar appears in numerous Scandinavian folktales, and may be a late reflection of the god Thor's role in fighting such beings. In connection, the lack of trolls and jötnar in modern Scandinavia is sometimes explained as a result of the "accuracy and efficiency of the lightning strokes".[14] Additionally, the absence of trolls in regions of Scandinavia is described in folklore as being a "consequence of the constant din of the church-bells". This ring caused the trolls to leave for other lands, although not without some resistance; numerous traditions relate how trolls destroyed a church under construction or hurled boulders and stones at completed churches. Large local stones are sometimes described as the product of a troll's toss.[15] Additionally, into the 20th century, the origins of particular Scandinavian landmarks, such as particular stones, are ascribed to trolls who may, for example, have turned to stone upon exposure to sunlight.[16] '', by John Bauer, 1913.]] Lindow compares the trolls of the Swedish folk tradition to Grendel, the supernatural mead hall invader in the Old English poem _Beowulf_, and notes that "just as the poem _Beowulf_ emphasizes not the harrying of Grendel but the cleansing of the hall of Beowulf, so the modern tales stress the moment when the trolls are driven off."[17]

Smaller trolls are attested as living in burial mounds and in mountains in Scandinavian folk tradition.[18] In Denmark, these creatures are recorded as _troldfolk_ ("troll-folk"), _bjergtrolde_ ("mountain-trolls"), or _bjergfolk_ ("mountain-folk") and in Norway also as _troldfolk_ ("troll-folk") and _tusser_.[19] Trolls may be described as small, human-like beings or as tall as men depending on the region of origin of the story.[20]

In Norwegian tradition, similar tales may be told about the larger trolls and the Huldrefolk ("hidden-folk"), yet a distinction is made between the two. The use of the word _trow_ in Orkney and Shetland, to mean beings which are very like the Huldrefolk in Norway, may suggest a common origin for the terms. The word _troll_ may have been used by pagan Norse settlers in Orkney and Shetland as a collective term for supernatural beings who should be respected and avoided rather than worshiped. _Troll_ could later have become specialized as a description of the larger, more menacing Jötunn-kind whereas _Huldrefolk_ may have developed as the term for smaller trolls.[21]

John Arnott MacCulloch posited a connection between the Old Norse vættir and trolls, suggesting that both concepts may derive from spirits of the dead.[22]
