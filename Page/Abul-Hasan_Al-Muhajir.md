ABUL-HASAN AL-MUHAJIR is the kunya of an anonymous Islamic militant, serving as the official spokesman of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant since 5 December 2016.


History

Abul-Hasan is the successor of Abu Mohammad al-Adnani, who was killed while visiting the Aleppo frontlines in Syria in August 2016.[1]

Abul-Hasan is believed to be a foreign fighter due to his kunya identifying him as "al-Muhajir" meaning "the emigrant". His true identity remains unknown as the Islamic State did not reveal any information about him.

Speculation about identity

In an article published in _The Atlantic_, journalist Graeme Wood postulates that Abul-Hasan Al-Muhajir is Texas-born John Georgelas, also known as Yahya Abu Hassan, though he later cast doubt on his theory.[4] Italian media has also speculated that he studied at the Black Swan Rock School of Music in Luserna San Giovanni.[5]
