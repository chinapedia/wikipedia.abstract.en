The 1959 BOWLING GREEN FALCONS FOOTBALL TEAM was an American football team that represented Bowling Green State University in the Mid-American Conference (MAC) during the 1959 college football season. In their fifth season under head coach Doyt Perry, the Falcons compiled a perfect 9–0 record (6–0 against MAC opponents), won the MAC championship, and outscored all opponents by a combined total of 274 to 83.[1] The team was voted by the United Press International Board of Coaches as the 1959 national small college champion.[2] The team was inducted as a group into the Bowling Green Hall of Fame in 2013.[3]

The team's statistical leaders were Bob Colburn with 788 passing yards, Chuck Comer with 361 rushing yards, and Bernie Casey with 264 receiving yards.[4] Colburn and tackle Bob Zimpfer were selected by the UPI as first-team All-Ohio players.[5] Colburn received the team's Most Valuable Player award.[6] Jack Harbaugh, who later gained fame as a football coach, set a school record with three interceptions in a 1959 game against Delaware.[7]
