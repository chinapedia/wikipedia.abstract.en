Political career

PAS STANCE ON OPPOSITION PACT

On 20 October 2016, Hashim Jasin emphasized that the Islamist party PAS will not collaborate with other political parties to topple the current Prime Minister Najib Razak’s government as this would not benefit him or the party. He mentioned that previous attempts in the past had proven failed. In the early 90’s, PAS joined forces with Parti Melayu Semangat 46 (S46) led by Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, then teaming up with Democratic Action Party (DAP) & People's Justice Party (PKR) to form Barisan Alternatif (BA) in 1998 and subsequently Pakatan Rakyat (PR) in 2008. Hashim stressed that PAS would like to take charge of the opposition pact, rather than follow.[3]

BETTER TO BE WITH UMNO THAN WITH ‘ANTI-ISLAM’ DAP

On February 6, 2017, PAS top leader Hashim Jasin said the party will choose ‘oppressive’ Umno over ‘anti-Islam’ DAP anytime. He said PAS was cooperating with Umno and Barisan Nasional (BN) because the Malay-based party can still be relied on compared to other “anti-Islam” parties. He said PAS’ approach was in line with the “mature politics” advocated by Prophet Muhammad.[4]


Controversy

In 2013, when Hashim Jasin was the then Perlis PAS commissioner, it was exposed that he owned a Porsche Cayman. He explained that the car was belongs to his son which was bought with approximate price RM100,000 from England using the Approved Permit which was reserved to him as a state assemblyman.[5]

In 2016, Hashim Jasin said that PAS unlikely to receive RM90 million, since he is driving a Proton Saga and lives in a home worth only RM60,000. He said that if PAS had RM100 million, he could have even built three swimming pools.[6]
