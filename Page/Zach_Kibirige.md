Personal life

Zach Kibirige is the son of Dr Mohammed Kibirige, a retired consultant paediatrician who worked at James Cook University Hospital. Dr Kibirige set up the charity ABC – Aids-Free Birthright for Children[6] – to use transmission interrupting drugs in pregnant women with HIV. The project has had a phenomenal success in Uganda since 2008, with 1,007 children now born HIV-free to mothers with the virus [7]

On 9 August 2016 he was cleared by a jury, of charges of rape, by a unanimous verdict at Newcastle Crown Court.[8] Following the verdict Newcastle Falcons released the following statement:

“Newcastle Falcons have welcomed the not-guilty verdict in the trial of Zach Kibirige. The club have been aware of the allegations hanging over Zach since his initial arrest (he faced charges of sexual assault). This has been an extremely stressful time for Zach, and his hugely promising rugby career has effectively been put on hold during this very difficult period. The club are satisfied that their faith in Zach has been borne out by the verdict in his trial. Zach remains an important member of the club’s playing staff and is available for all rugby and non-rugby-related duties. Newcastle Falcons will be making no further comment on this matter.”[9]
