Flogstaskriket.jpg, Uppsala]] ELVAVRÅLET (Swedish: the eleven roar) is a student tradition where students at universities and colleges at a certain time every evening/night in student residential areas (22:00 or 23:00, on Lappkärrsberget only Tuesdays) open their windows, go out onto balconies or up to the rooftops and scream out their anxiety due to exams and stress.

The roar is also called _the Delphi roar_ (after the student residential area Delphi in Lund), _the Flogsta roar_[1][2] (after the neighborhood Flogsta in Uppsala), _the Lappkärr cry_ (after the neighborhood Lappkärrsberget in Stockholm), _the Ten cry_, _the Tuesday scream_ or _Anxiety scream_. On some days there are more roars than others, and sometimes even vuvuzelas are used. The phenomenon has been known since the 1970s, and has also been the subject of academic papers and discussions on the radio.
