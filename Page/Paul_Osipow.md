PAUL OSIPOW (born 1939) is an artist from Finland. He studied in Academy of Fine Arts and Vapaa taidekoulu in Helsinki and in University of Texas, Austin, USA [1]

Osipow made his breakthrough in Finnish art world in 1960, and his career has continued for decades. He used to paint with acrylic, but changed to oil paintings.[2] Osipow became first famous with his pop-art paintings.[3] Osipowâ€™s exhibitions in the 1990s revealed his gradual movement away from a pure geometric expression to one more painterly and unrestricted, inspired by the pioneers of modern painting and with extensive samplings from late impressionism, cubism and fauvism.[4]

He received the Swedish Prince Eugen Medal in 1989.[5]
