BAÍA DO INFERNO (Portuguese for "bay of hell", also: _Baía de Santa Clara_) is a bay on the southwest coast of the island of Santiago in Cape Verde in the Atlantic Ocean. The bay is completely within the municipality of Santa Catarina. It is a large and relatively sheltered bay, characterised by steep cliffs, more than 400 m high in some places.[1] The nearest settlement is Entre Picos de Reda, 3 km inland. Rincão lies 4 km north along the coast, Porto Mosquito 6 km southeast.


Wildlife

The bay forms a part of the Important Bird Area "Coastal cliffs between Porto Mosquito and Baia do Inferno", which covers 160 ha and about 8 km of coastline. The site has been identified as an IBA by BirdLife International because the cliffs support 25–30 breeding pairs of red-billed tropicbirds. It also supports the largest colony of brown booby in Cape Verde.[2] The adjacent marine area (13 km², maximum depth 244 m) has also been identified as an IBA, because of its importance for the red-billed tropicbird.[3]
