DORIS DAY (born DORIS MARY KAPPELHOFF; April 3, 1922 – May 13, 2019 ) was an American actress, singer, and animal welfare activist. She began her career as a big band singer in 1939, achieving commercial success in 1945 with two No. 1 recordings, "Sentimental Journey" and "My Dreams Are Getting Better All the Time" with Les Brown & His Band of Renown. During the war troops referred to her as "the American V-2" She left Brown to embark on a solo career and recorded more than 650 songs from 1947 to 1967.

Day's film career began during the latter part of the Golden Age of Hollywood with the film _Romance on the High Seas_ (1948), leading to a 20-year career as a motion picture actress. She starred in films of many genres, including musicals, comedies, dramas and thrillers. She played the title role in _Calamity Jane_ (1953) and starred in Alfred Hitchcock's _The Man Who Knew Too Much_ (1956) with James Stewart. Her best-known films are those in which she co-starred with Rock Hudson, chief among them 1959's _Pillow Talk_, for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She also worked with James Garner on both _Move Over, Darling_ (1963) and _The Thrill of It All_ (1963), and starred alongside Clark Gable, Cary Grant, James Cagney, David Niven, Jack Lemmon, Frank Sinatra, Richard Widmark, Kirk Douglas, Lauren Bacall and Rod Taylor in various movies. After ending her film career in 1968, only briefly removed from the height of her popularity, she starred in her own sitcom _The Doris Day Show_ (1968–1973).

Day became one of the biggest film stars in the early 1960s, and as of 2012 was one of eight performers to have been the top box-office earner in the United States four times.[1][2] In 2011, she released her 29th studio album _My Heart_ which contained new material and became a UK Top 10 album. She received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and a Legend Award from the Society of Singers. In 1960, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress,[3] and was given the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in motion pictures in 1989. In 2004, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom; this was followed in 2011 by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association's Career Achievement Award.


Early life

Doris Mary Kappelhoff was born on April 3, 1922, in Cincinnati, Ohio,[4] the daughter of Alma Sophia (_née_ Welz; 1895–1976) and William Joseph Kappelhoff (1892–1967). Her mother was a homemaker, and her father was a music teacher and choirmaster.[5] Her grandparents were all German.[6][7][8] For most of her life, Day reportedly believed she had been born in 1924 and reported her age accordingly; it was not until her 95th birthday – when the Associated Press found her birth certificate, showing a 1922 date of birth – that she learned otherwise.[9]

The youngest of three siblings, she had two older brothers: Richard (who died before her birth) and Paul, two to three years older. Due to her father's alleged infidelity, her parents separated.[10][11] She developed an early interest in dance, and in the mid-1930s formed a dance duo with Jerry Doherty that performed locally in Cincinnati.[12] A car accident on October 13, 1937, injured her right leg and curtailed her prospects as a professional dancer.[13][14]


Career

Early career (1938–1947)

While recovering from her car accident, Doris started to sing along with the radio and discovered a talent she did not know she had. "During this long, boring period, I used to while away a lot of time listening to the radio, sometimes singing along with the likes of Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Tommy Dorsey, and Glenn Miller", she told A. E. Hotchner, one of her biographers. "But the one radio voice I listened to above others belonged to Ella Fitzgerald. There was a quality to her voice that fascinated me, and I'd sing along with her, trying to catch the subtle ways she shaded her voice, the casual yet clean way she sang the words."

Observing her daughter sing rekindled Alma's interest in show business, and she decided Doris must have singing lessons. She engaged a teacher, Grace Raine. After three lessons, Raine told Alma that young Doris had "tremendous potential"; Raine was so impressed that she gave Doris three lessons a week for the price of one. Years later, Day said that Raine had the biggest effect on her singing style and career.

During the eight months she was taking singing lessons, Doris had her first professional jobs as a vocalist, on the WLW radio program _Carlin's Carnival_, and in a local restaurant, Charlie Yee's Shanghai Inn. During her radio performances, Doris first caught the attention of Barney Rapp, who was looking for a female vocalist and asked if she would like to audition for the job. According to Rapp, he had auditioned about 200 singers when Doris got the job.

While working for Rapp in 1939, she adopted the stage surname "Day", at Rapp's suggestion.[15] Rapp felt that "Kappelhoff" was too long for marquees, and he admired her rendition of the song "Day After Day". After working with Rapp, Day worked with bandleaders Jimmy James,[16] Bob Crosby,[17] and Les Brown.[18] In 1941, Day appeared as a singer in three Soundies with the Les Brown band.[19]

While working with Brown, Day recorded her first hit recording, "Sentimental Journey", released in early 1945. It soon became an anthem of the desire of World War II demobilizing troops to return home.[20][21] The song continues to be associated with Day, and she re-recorded it on several occasions, including a version in her 1971 television special. During 1945–46, Day (as vocalist with the Les Brown Band) had six other top ten hits on the _Billboard_ chart: "My Dreams Are Getting Better All the Time", {{"'}}Tain't Me", "Till The End of Time", "You Won't Be Satisfied (Until You Break My Heart)", "The Whole World is Singing My Song", and "I Got the Sun in the Mornin{{'"}}.[22] Les Brown said, "As a singer Doris belongs in the company of Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra." (Aljean Harmetz (2019). "Wholesome Box-Office Star and Golden Voice of 'Que Sera, Sera' ". "The New York Times." p. 1 )

Early film career (1948–1954)

in _Starlift_ (1951)]] While singing with the Les Brown band and for nearly two years on Bob Hope's weekly radio program,[23] she toured extensively across the United States.

Her performance of the song "Embraceable You" impressed songwriter Jule Styne and his partner, Sammy Cahn, and they recommended her for a role in _Romance on the High Seas_ (1948). Day got the part after auditioning for director Michael Curtiz.[24] She was shocked at being offered the role in the film, and admitted to Curtiz that she was a singer without acting experience. But he said he liked that "she was honest", not afraid to admit it, and he wanted someone who "looked like the All-American Girl". Day was the discovery of which Curtiz was most proud during his career.[25]

The film provided her with a hit recording as a soloist, "It's Magic", which followed by two months her first hit ("Love Somebody" in 1948) recorded as a duet with Buddy Clark.[26] Day recorded "Someone Like You", before the 1949 film _My Dream Is Yours_, which featured the song.[27]

In 1950, U.S. servicemen in Korea voted her their favorite star. She continued to make minor and frequently nostalgic period musicals such as _On Moonlight Bay_, _By the Light of the Silvery Moon_, and _Tea For Two_ for Warner Brothers.[28][29] in _Calamity Jane_ (1953)]] Her most commercially successful film for Warner was _I'll See You in My Dreams_ (1951), which broke box-office records of 20 years. The film is a musical biography of lyricist Gus Kahn. It was Day's fourth film directed by Curtiz.[30] Day appeared as the title character in the comedic western-themed musical, _Calamity Jane_ (1953).[31] A song from the film, "Secret Love", won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and became Day's fourth No. 1 hit single in the United States.[32]

Between 1950 and 1953, the albums from six of her movie musicals charted in the Top 10, three of them at No. 1. After filming _Lucky Me_ with Bob Cummings and _Young at Heart_ with Frank Sinatra (both 1954), Day chose not to renew her contract with Warner Brothers.[33]

During this period, Day also had her own radio program, _The Doris Day Show_. It was broadcast on CBS in 1952–1953.[34]

Breakthrough (1955–1958)

'' (1955)]] Having become primarily recognized as a musical-comedy actress, Day gradually took on more dramatic roles to broaden her range. Her dramatic star turn as singer Ruth Etting in _Love Me or Leave Me_ (1955), with top billing above James Cagney, received critical and commercial success, becoming Day's biggest hit thus far.[35] Cagney said she had "the ability to project the simple, direct statement of a simple, direct idea without cluttering it", comparing her to Laurette Taylor's Broadway performance in _The Glass Menagerie_ (1945), one of the greatest performances by an American actor.[36] Day said it was her best film performance. Producer Joe Pasternak said, "I was stunned that Doris did not get an Oscar nomination."[37] The soundtrack album from that movie was a No. 1 hit.[38][39]

Day starred in Alfred Hitchcock's suspense film _The Man Who Knew Too Much_ (1956) with James Stewart. She sang two songs in the film, "Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)" which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song,[40] and "We'll Love Again". The film was Day's 10th movie to be in the Top 10 at the box office. In 1956, Day played the title role in the thriller/noir _Julie_ with Louis Jourdan.[41]

After three successive dramatic films, Day returned to her musical/comedic roots in 1957's _The Pajama Game_ with John Raitt. The film was based on the Broadway play of the same name.[42] She worked with Paramount Pictures for the comedy _Teacher's Pet_ (1958), alongside Clark Gable and Gig Young.[43] She co-starred with Richard Widmark and Gig Young in the romantic comedy film _The Tunnel of Love_ (1958),[44] but found scant success opposite Jack Lemmon in _It Happened to Jane_ (1959).

_Billboard_{{'s}} annual nationwide poll of disc jockeys had ranked Day as the No. 1 female vocalist nine times in ten years (1949 through 1958), but her success and popularity as a singer was now being overshadowed by her box-office appeal.[45]

Box-office success (1959–1968)

'' (1960)]] In 1959, Day entered her most successful phase as a film actress with a series of romantic comedies.[46][47] This success began with _Pillow Talk_ (1959), co-starring Rock Hudson who became a lifelong friend, and Tony Randall. Day received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress.[48] It was the only Oscar nomination she received in her career.[49] Day, Hudson, and Randall made two more films together, _Lover Come Back_ (1961) and _Send Me No Flowers_ (1964).[50]

In 1960, she starred with David Niven and Janis Paige in the hit _Please Don't Eat the Daisies_. In 1962, Day appeared with Cary Grant in the comedy _That Touch of Mink_, the first film in history ever to gross $1 million at Radio City Music Hall.[51] During 1960 and the 1962 to 1964 period, she ranked number one at the box office, the second woman to be number one four times, an accomplished equalled by no other actress except Shirley Temple.[52] She set a record that has yet to be equaled, receiving seven consecutive Laurel Awards as the top female box office star.[53]

Day teamed up with James Garner starting with _The Thrill of It All_, followed by _Move Over, Darling_ (both 1963).[54] The film's theme song, "Move Over Darling", co-written by her son, reached in the UK.[55] In between these comedic roles, Day co-starred with Rex Harrison in the movie thriller _Midnight Lace_ (1960), an updating of the classic stage thriller _Gaslight_.[56]

By the late 1960s, the sexual revolution of the baby boomer generation had refocused public attitudes about sex. Times changed, but Day's films did not. Day's next film _Do Not Disturb_ (1965) was popular with audiences, but her popularity soon waned. Critics and comics dubbed Day "The World's Oldest Virgin",[57][58] and audiences began to shy away from her films. As a result, she slipped from the list of top box-office stars, last appearing in the top ten in 1966 with the hit film _The Glass Bottom Boat_. One of the roles she turned down was that of "Mrs. Robinson" in _The Graduate_, a role that eventually went to Anne Bancroft.[59] In her published memoirs, Day said she had rejected the part on moral grounds: she found the script "vulgar and offensive".[60]

She starred in the western film _The Ballad of Josie_ (1967). That same year, Day recorded _The Love Album_, although it was not released until 1994.[61] The following year (1968), she starred in the comedy film _Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?_ which centers on the Northeast blackout of November 9, 1965. Her final feature, the comedy _With Six You Get Eggroll_, was released in 1968.[62]

From 1959 to 1970, Day received nine Laurel Award nominations (and won four times) for best female performance in eight comedies and one drama. From 1959 through 1969, she received six Golden Globe nominations for best female performance in three comedies, one drama (_Midnight Lace_), one musical (_Jumbo_), and her television series.[63]

Bankruptcy and television career

'']] After her third husband Martin Melcher died on April 20, 1968, a shocked Day discovered that Melcher and his business partner and "adviser" Jerome Bernard Rosenthal had squandered her earnings, leaving her deeply in debt.[64] Rosenthal had been her attorney since 1949, when he represented her in her uncontested divorce action against her second husband, saxophonist George W. Weidler. Day filed suit against Rosenthal in February 1969, won a successful decision in 1974, but did not receive compensation until a settlement in 1979.[65]

Day also learned to her displeasure that Melcher had committed her to a television series, which became _The Doris Day Show_.

Day hated the idea of performing on television, but felt obligated to do it.[66] The first episode of _The Doris Day Show_ aired on September 24, 1968,[67] and, from 1968 to 1973, employed "Que Sera, Sera" as its theme song. Day persevered (she needed the work to help pay off her debts), but only after CBS ceded creative control to her and her son. The successful show enjoyed a five-year run,[68] and functioned as a curtain raiser for the popular _Carol Burnett Show_. It is remembered today for its abrupt season-to-season changes in casting and premise. on the TV special _Doris Day Today_
(CBS, February 19, 1975)[69]]] By the end of its run in 1973, public tastes had changed, as had those of the television industry, and her firmly established persona was regarded as passé. She largely retired from acting after _The Doris Day Show_, but did complete two television specials, _The Doris Mary Anne Kappelhoff Special_ (1971)[70] and _Doris Day Today_ (1975),[71] and was a guest on various shows in the 1970s.

In the 1985–86 season, Day hosted her own television talk show, _Doris Day's Best Friends_, on CBN.[72][73] The network canceled the show after 26 episodes, despite the worldwide publicity it received. Much of that attention came from the episode featuring Rock Hudson, in which Hudson was showing the first public symptoms of AIDS including severe weight loss and admitted fatigue; Hudson would die from the syndrome a year later.[74] Ms.Day said, "He was very sick. But I just brushed that off and I came out and put my arms around him and said, 'Am I glad to see you.[75]

1980s and 1990s

Day's husband and agent, Martin Melcher, had Beverly Hills lawyer Jerome Rosenthal handle his wife's money since the 1940s.[76] "During that period, Rosenthal committed breaches of professional ethics that are difficult to exaggerate", as one court put it.[77]

In October 1985, the California Supreme Court rejected Rosenthal's appeal of the multimillion-dollar judgment against him for legal malpractice, and upheld conclusions of a trial court and a Court of Appeal[78] that Rosenthal acted improperly.[79] In April 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the lower court's judgment. In June 1987, Rosenthal filed a $30 million lawsuit against lawyers he claimed cheated him out of millions of dollars in real estate investments. He named Day as a co-defendant, describing her as an "unwilling, involuntary plaintiff whose consent cannot be obtained". Rosenthal claimed that millions of dollars Day lost were in real estate sold after Melcher died in 1968, in which Rosenthal asserted that the attorneys gave Day bad advice, telling her to sell, at a loss, three hotels, in Palo Alto, California, Dallas, Texas, and Atlanta, Georgia, plus some oil leases in Kentucky and Ohio.[80] He claimed he had made the investments under a long-term plan, and did not intend to sell them until they appreciated in value. Two of the hotels sold in 1970 for about $7 million, and their estimated worth in 1986 was $50 million.[81]

Terry Melcher stated that his adoptive father's premature death saved Day from financial ruin. It remains unresolved whether Martin Melcher had himself also been duped.[82] Day stated publicly that she believed her husband innocent of any deliberate wrongdoing, stating that he "simply trusted the wrong person".[83] According to Day's autobiography, as told to A. E. Hotchner, the usually athletic and healthy Martin Melcher had an enlarged heart. Most of the interviews on the subject given to Hotchner (and included in Day's autobiography) paint an unflattering portrait of Melcher. Author David Kaufman asserts that one of Day's costars, actor Louis Jourdan, maintained that Day herself disliked her husband,[84] but Day's public statements regarding Melcher appear to contradict that assertion.

Day was scheduled to present, along with Patrick Swayze and Marvin Hamlisch, the Best Original Score Oscar at the 61st Academy Awards in March 1989 but she suffered a deep leg cut and was unable to attend.[85] She had been walking through the gardens of her hotel when she cut her leg on a sprinkler. The cut required stitches.[86]

Day was inducted into the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame in 1981 and received the Cecil B. DeMille Award for career achievement in 1989.[87] In 1994, Day's _Greatest Hits_ album became another entry into the British charts.[88] Her cover of "Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps" was included in the soundtrack of the Australian film _Strictly Ballroom._[89]

2000s

Day participated in interviews and celebrations of her birthday with an annual Doris Day music marathon.[90] In July 2008, she appeared on the Southern California radio show of longtime friend and newscaster George Putnam.[91]

Day turned down a tribute offer from the American Film Institute and from the Kennedy Center Honors because they require attendance in person. In 2004, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush for her achievements in the entertainment industry and for her work on behalf of animals.[92] President Bush stated:

Columnist Liz Smith and film critic Rex Reed mounted vigorous campaigns to gather support for an Honorary Academy Award for Day to herald her film career and her status as the top female box-office star of all time.[93] According to the Hollywood Reporter in 2015, the Academy offered her the Honorary Oscar multiple times, but she declined as she saw the film industry as a part of her past life.[94] Day received a Grammy for Lifetime Achievement in Music in 2008, albeit again in absentia.[95]

She received three Grammy Hall of Fame Awards, in 1998, 1999 and 2012, for her recordings of "Sentimental Journey", "Secret Love", and "Que Sera, Sera", respectively.[96] Day was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2007,[97] and in 2010 received the first Legend Award ever presented by the Society of Singers.[98]

2010s

Day, aged 89, released _My Heart_ in the United Kingdom on September 5, 2011, her first new album in nearly two decades since the release of _The Love Album_, which, although recorded in 1967, was not released until 1994.[99] The album is a compilation of previously unreleased recordings produced by Day's son, Terry Melcher, before his death in 2004. Tracks include the 1970s Joe Cocker hit "You Are So Beautiful", the Beach Boys' "Disney Girls" and jazz standards such as "My Buddy", which Day originally sang in her 1951 film _I'll See You in My Dreams_.[100][101]

After the disc was released in the United States it soon climbed to No. 12 on Amazon's bestseller list, and helped raise funds for the Doris Day Animal League.[102] Day became the oldest artist to score a UK Top 10 with an album featuring new material.[103]

In January 2012, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association presented Day with a Lifetime Achievement Award.[104][105]

In April 2014, Day made an unexpected public appearance to attend the annual Doris Day Animal Foundation benefit. The benefit raises money for her Animal Foundation.[106]

Clint Eastwood offered Day a role in a film he was planning to direct in 2015.[107] Although she reportedly was in talks with Eastwood, her neighbor in Carmel, about a role in the film, she eventually declined.[108]

Day granted ABC a telephone interview on her birthday in 2016, which was accompanied by photos of her life and career.[109]

In a rare interview with _The Hollywood Reporter_ on April 4, 2019, the day after her 97th birthday, Day talked about her work on the Doris Day Animal Foundation, founded in 1978. On the question of what her favorite film was, she answered _Calamity Jane_: "I was such a tomboy growing up, and she was such a fun character to play. Of course, the music was wonderful, too—'Secret Love,' especially, is such a beautiful song."[110] To commemorate her birthday, her fans gather each year to take part in a three-day party in her hometown of Carmel, California, in late March. The event is also a fundraiser for her Animal Foundation. In 2019, during the event, there was a special screening of her 1959 film _Pillow Talk_ to celebrate its 60th anniversary. About the film, Day stated in the same interview that she "had such fun working with my pal, Rock. We laughed our way through three films we made together and remained great friends. I miss him."[111]


Personal life

After her retirement from films, Day lived in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. She had many pets and adopted stray animals.[112] She was a lifelong Republican.[113] Her only child was music producer and songwriter Terry Melcher, who had a hit in the 1960s with "Hey Little Cobra" under the name the Rip Chords; he died of melanoma in November 2004.[114] Day owned a hotel in Carmel-by-the-Sea called the Cypress Inn which she originally co-owned with her son.[115]

Marriages

Day was married four times.[116] From March 1941 to February 1943 she was married to trombonist Al Jorden, (a violent schizophrenic who later committed suicide) whom she met in Barney Rapp's Band.[117] They had a son Terrence Paul "Terry" Jorden (1942-2004), whom Jorden attempted to kill by beating Doris when she refused to have an abortion. Her second marriage was to George William Weidler from March 30, 1946, to May 31, 1949, a saxophonist and the brother of actress Virginia Weidler.[118] Weidler and Day met again several years later during a brief reconciliation, and he introduced her to Christian Science.[119]

Day married Martin Melcher on April 3, 1951, her 29th birthday, and this marriage lasted until his death in April 1968.[120] Melcher adopted Day's son Terry, who became a successful musician and record producer under the name Terry Melcher.[121] Martin Melcher produced many of Day's movies. They were both Christian Scientists, resulting in her not seeing a doctor for some time for symptoms which suggested cancer.[122]

Day's fourth marriage was to Barry Comden (1935–2009) from April 14, 1976, until April 2, 1982.[123] He was the _maître d'hôtel_ at one of Day's favorite restaurants. He knew of her great love of dogs and endeared himself to her by giving her a bag of meat scraps and bones on her way out of the restaurant. He later complained that she cared more for her "animal friends" than she did for him.[124]

Death

Day died on May 13, 2019, at the age of 97, after having contracted pneumonia. Her death was announced by her charity, the Doris Day Animal Foundation.[125][126][127] Per Day's requests, the Foundation announced that there would be no funeral services, gravesites, or other public memorials.[128][129][130] She was survived by her only grandchild, Ryan Melcher.


Animal welfare activism

Day's interest in animal welfare and related issues apparently dated to her teen years. While recovering from an automobile accident, she took her dog Tiny for a walk without a leash. Tiny ran into the street and was killed by a passing car. Day later expressed guilt and loneliness about Tiny's untimely death. In 1971, she co-founded Actors and Others for Animals, and appeared in a series of newspaper advertisements denouncing the wearing of fur, alongside Mary Tyler Moore, Angie Dickinson, and Jayne Meadows.

In 1978, Day founded the Doris Day Pet Foundation, now the Doris Day Animal Foundation (DDAF).[131] A non-profit 501(c)(3) grant-giving public charity, DDAF funds other non-profit causes throughout the US that share DDAF's mission of helping animals and the people who love them. The DDAF continues to operate independently.[132]

To complement the Doris Day Animal Foundation, Day formed the Doris Day Animal League (DDAL) in 1987, a national non-profit citizen's lobbying organization whose mission is to reduce pain and suffering and protect animals through legislative initiatives.[133] Day actively lobbied the United States Congress in support of legislation designed to safeguard animal welfare on a number of occasions and in 1995 she originated the annual Spay Day USA.[134] The DDAL merged into The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) in 2006.[135] The HSUS now manages World Spay Day, the annual one-day spay/neuter event that Day originated.[136]

A facility bearing her name, the Doris Day Horse Rescue and Adoption Center, which helps abused and neglected horses, opened in 2011 in Murchison, Texas, on the grounds of an animal sanctuary started by her late friend, author Cleveland Amory.[137] Day contributed $250,000 towards the founding of the center.[138]
