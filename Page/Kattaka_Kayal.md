KATTAKA KAYAL (Malayalam: കട്ടക കായല്‍) or KATTAKAYAL is a freshwater lake in Kollam city in the Kerala state of India. The lake connects Vattakayal, a 36-acre freshwater lake in Maruthadi, with Ashtamudi Lake in the city.[1][2][3]


History

Kattak Kayal is a part of Ashtamudi Lake and Vattakayal in Kollam. The two-km long stream was once the lifeline for most of the commercial activities at Sakthikulangara. Its width was 90 to 120 meters before 50 years. Three boat jetties were there along the course of Kattaka Kayal then and huge cargo vessels berthing for loading and unloading seafood items were a common view of Quilon city those days. It was home for more than 20 species of edible fish including Karimeen and Poomeen.[4][5]


Revival Program

A revival program for Vattakayal and Kattaka Kayal has been launched at Kollam on 1 November 2016 by V. Rajendrababu, Mayor of Kollam Municipal Corporation.[6] _Kattakayal Punarjeevana Padhadi_ is an initiative of the Shakthikulangara-based cultural organisation Sagara Samskarika Sangham.[7] The main aim of this program is to revive both the lakes through various phases that includes cleaning of the lake and awareness campaigns.[8]
