The book was released on 6 September 2016, a day after Gunaratne's retirement. The Sinhala and English versions of the book were released on the same day. It covers several incidents that occurred during the Sri Lankan Civil War, including the killing of Velupillai Prabhakaran.

'Road to Nandikadal' is the best selling book of the 2016 Colombo International Book Fair.[1]

Major General Kamal Gunaratne was the Commanding Officer of the 53 Division in Sri Lanka Army, that is believed to have killed the LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran. According to Mangala Samaraweera, the foreign minister of Sri Lanka, it is filled with inaccuracies and contradictions and was soon used by Pro-LTTE groups and even circulated in Geneva Human Rights Council sessions as it contains claims of war crimes by the Government. The book says the government forces set fire to homes and buses in Jaffna during the “1983 referendum" even though the referendum was held in 1982. Further the book states that Prabhakaran was wearing military camouflaged of the LTTE and had his LTTE identity card and dog tag when the body was brought before him even though in 2009 in an interview he claimed that the body was found in civilian clothing and it was his troops who dressed Prabhakaran in LTTE military uniform.[2]
