DARYLE LAMONT JENKINS (born July 22, 1968) is an American political activist, best known for founding One People's Project, an organization based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Jenkins serves as its Executive Director.


Early life

Jenkins was born in Newark, New Jersey and raised in nearby Somerset, New Jersey. He graduated from Franklin High School and served in the United States Air Force.[1] Upon returning from the service, he became a part of the punk rock scene, producing two public access programs about the scene as well as political activism, which caused some conflict with his position as a reporter and an editor for local newspapers.[2]


Career

Jenkins has been documenting and writing about right wing individuals and organizations since 1988, while he was still serving in the Air Force as a police officer.[3] In 2000, he founded One People's Project out of a counter-protest to a rally in Morristown, New Jersey by Richard Barrett of the Nationalist Movement,[4] and the organization gained a reputation of publicly documenting hate groups, and their activities, a practice known today as doxing.[5] In addition, Jenkins has also gained a reputation for helping neo-Nazis leave those circles behind,[6] among them Bryon Widner, whose story was featured in the documentary _Erasing Hate_ which has been turned into a feature-length motion picture titled _Skin_ starring Jamie Bell, Danielle Macdonald, Vera Farmiga and Mike Colter playing Jenkins. The movie made its world premiere at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival,[7][8] and was released on June 27, 2019 through DirecTV Cinema before being released on July 26, 2019, by A24.[9]

While One People's Project and Jenkins had gained some notoriety over the years, it was not until real estate tycoon Donald Trump's campaign for the presidency and eventual victory that put him, the organization and the entire Antifa movement into the spotlight.[10][11] Jenkins has appeared on numerous television news programs, articles and documentaries, notably _The Montel Williams Show_, _A Current Affair_, the Rachel Maddow Show and on AM Joy with Joy Reid. In 2018, the documentary _Alt-Right: Age of Rage_, which features Jenkins confronting White Nationalist Richard Spencer, premiered at South by Southwest.[12]
