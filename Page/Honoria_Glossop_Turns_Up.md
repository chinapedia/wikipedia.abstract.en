Trying to sort things out, Bertie manages to get Blair Eggleston to break off his engagement with Honoria Glossop who now wants to marry Bertie. Meanwhile Bingo marries the waitress, who turns out to be the real Rosie M. Banks, so she and Lord Bittlesham are also after Bertie who decides the best thing is to take the next ship to London. But so do all the others and, confronted by all of them on board, he and Jeeves jump ship.
