ALEXANDER CROW (died 1586/7) was born in Yorkshire[1] around 1550.[2] He took up an early trade as a shoemaker,[3] but in his twenties he travelled to Rheims, France, and trained as a priest at Duoay College, being ordained in 1584.[4]

He returned to the north of England to continue his mission, until he was arrested in South Duffield[5] whilst baptising a baby.[6] Taken to York, he was hanged, drawn and quartered on 30 November 1586 or 1587.[7] Sources conflict as to the year of his death, whether it was 1586 or a year later, 'being about the year of thirty five,'[8]

One of the Eighty-five martyrs of England and Wales, he was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 22 November 1987.[9]
