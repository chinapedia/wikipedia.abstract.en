NEON DREAMS is a Canadian duo consisting of Frank Kadillac and Adrian Morris.

The band got recognition from rapper Waka Flocka Flame in January 2015.[1] They remixed Waka Flocka Flame's tracks “50k” and “Hard In The Paint” which led to their debut album “The Last of Us”. The first track, “Love Experts” on the group's debut EP “The Last of Us” released on September 4, 2015, was the group's breakthrough single. It was debuted on Bell Media stations across Canada and quickly picked up by other Top-40 stations nationwide. It climbed its way onto Billboard’s CHR Top 40 chart and iTunes’ Top 10 electronic chart.


Background

Musical style

The band reflects a diverse musical style combining EDM with live instrumental and vocals.[2] They create a unique form of pop music taking influence from Rock, Hip-Hop and Electro.[3]


Career

NeonDreams_MarchingBands.jpg The band emerged in 2013[4] consisting of lead vocalist Frank Kadillac, DJ/vocalist Corey LeRue, guitarist Matt Gats, and drummer Adrian Morris.[5] They met in high school where Corey was a DJ, following in his father’s footsteps, while the other members were originally into rock.[6] Their own sound evolved into electronic with pop and rock elements as they began writing and performing. Since then they have toured and shared the stage with artists such as, Diplo, Down With Webster, DVBBS and Waka Flocka Flame.[7]

The band released their 7-song EP _To You_ on August 26, 2016,[8] with lead single “Marching Bands” featuring Toronto hip-hop legend Kardinal Offishall.[9][10] The single boosted their career, pushing the band on a cross Canada tour.


Controversies

On February 16, 2018, the band left the Hedley tour, where they had been openers.[11] This was due to sexual assault allegations against Hedley's lead singer, Jacob Hoggard. Hoggard was later charged with three counts of sexual assault. [12]
