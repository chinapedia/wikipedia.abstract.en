depicts Narcissus gazing at his own reflection.]] In Greek mythology, NARCISSUS (; Ancient Greek: Νάρκισσος _Nárkissos_) was a hunter from Thespiae in Boeotia who was known for his beauty. According to Tzetzes, he was a Laconian hunter who loved everything beautiful.[1] Narcissus was proud, in that he disdained those who loved him, causing some to commit suicide to prove their unrelenting devotion to his striking beauty. Narcissus is the origin of the term _narcissism_, a fixation with oneself and one's physical appearance or public perception.


Etymology

The name is of uncertain etymology. According to R. S. P. Beekes, "[t]he suffix [-ισσος] clearly points to a Pre-Greek word."[2] The word narcissus has come to be used for the daffodil, but there is no clarity on whether the flower is named for the myth, or the myth for the flower, or if there is any true connection at all. Pliny the Elder wrote that the plant was named for its fragrance (_ναρκάω_ narkao, "I grow numb") not the youth.


Family

Narcissus was the son of the river god Cephissus and nymph Liriope.[3]


Mythology

Several versions of the myth have survived from ancient sources. The classic version is by Ovid, found in book 3 of his _Metamorphoses_ (completed 8 AD); this is the story of Echo and Narcissus. One day Narcissus was walking in the woods when Echo, an Oread (mountain nymph) saw him, fell deeply in love, and followed him. Narcissus sensed he was being followed and shouted "Who's there?". Echo repeated "Who's there?" She eventually revealed her identity and attempted to embrace him. He stepped away and told her to leave him alone. She was heartbroken and spent the rest of her life in lonely glens until nothing but an echo sound remained of her. Nemesis (as an aspect of Aphrodite[4]), the goddess of revenge, noticed this behaviour after learning the story and decided to punish Narcissus. Once, during the summer, he was getting thirsty after hunting, and the goddess lured him to a pool where he leaned upon the water and saw himself in the bloom of youth. Narcissus did not realize it was merely his own reflection and fell deeply in love with it, as if it was somebody else. Unable to leave the allure of his image, he eventually realized that his love could not be reciprocated and he melted away from the fire of passion burning inside him, eventually turning into a gold and white flower.[5][6]

An earlier version ascribed to the poet Parthenius of Nicaea, composed around 50 BC, was recently rediscovered among the Oxyrhynchus papyri at Oxford.[7] Unlike Ovid's version, it ended with Narcissus who lost his will to live and committed suicide. A version by Conon, a contemporary of Ovid, also ends in suicide (_Narrations,_ 24). In it, a young man named Ameinias fell in love with Narcissus, who had already spurned his male suitors. Narcissus also spurned him and gave him a sword. Ameinias committed suicide at Narcissus's doorstep. He had prayed to the gods to give Narcissus a lesson for all the pain he provoked. Narcissus walked by a pool of water and decided to drink some. He saw his reflection, became entranced by it, and killed himself because he could not have his object of desire.[8] A century later the travel writer Pausanias recorded a novel variant of the story, in which Narcissus falls in love with his twin sister rather than himself (_Guide to Greece_, 9.31.7).[9][10] In all versions, his body disappears and all that is left is a narcissus flower.


Psychology

In 1898 Havelock Ellis, an English sexologist, used the term "narcissus-like" in reference to excessive masturbation, whereby the person becomes his or her own sex object.[11]

In 1899, Paul Näcke was the first person to use the term "narcissism" in a study of sexual perversions.

Otto Rank, in 1911, published the first psychoanalytical paper specifically concerned with narcissism, linking it to vanity and self-admiration.[12]

Sigmund Freud published a paper exclusively devoted to narcissism in 1914, called "On Narcissism: An Introduction".[13]

One of the personality disorders is called narcissistic personality disorder.


Influence on culture

The myth of Narcissus has inspired artists for at least two thousand years, even before the Roman poet Ovid featured a version in book III of his _Metamorphoses_. This was followed in more recent centuries by other poets (e.g. Keats and Alfred Edward Housman) and painters (Caravaggio, Poussin, Turner, Dalí (see _Metamorphosis of Narcissus_), and Waterhouse).

Literature

]] ]] In Stendhal's novel _Le Rouge et le Noir_ (1830), there is a classic narcissist in the character of Mathilde. Says Prince Korasoff to Julien Sorel, the protagonist, with respect to his beloved girl:

  She looks at herself instead of looking at you, and so doesn't know you. During the two or three little outbursts of passion she has allowed herself in your favor, she has, by a great effort of imagination, seen in you the hero of her dreams, and not yourself as you really are.
  (Page 401, 1953 Penguin Edition, trans. Margaret R.B. Shaw).

The myth had a decided influence on English Victorian homoerotic culture, via André Gide's study of the myth, _Le Traité du Narcisse_ ('The Treatise of the Narcissus', 1891), and the only novel by Oscar Wilde, _The Picture of Dorian Gray_.

Paulo Coelho's _The Alchemist_ also starts with a story about Narcissus, found (we are told) by the alchemist in a book brought by someone in the caravan. The alchemist's (and Coelho's) source was very probably Hesketh Pearson's _The Life of Oscar Wilde_ (1946) in which this story is recorded (Penguin edition, p. 217) as one of Wilde's inspired inventions. This version of the Narcissus story is based on Wilde's "The Disciple" from his "Poems in Prose (Wilde)".

Author and poet Rainer Maria Rilke visits the character and symbolism of Narcissus in several of his poems.

Seamus Heaney references Narcissus in his poem "Personal Helicon"[14] from his first collection "Death of a Naturalist":

  "To stare, big-eyed Narcissus, into some spring
  Is beneath all adult dignity."

In Rick Riordan's _Heroes of Olympus series,_ Narcissus appears as a minor antagonist in the third book _The Mark of Athena_.

In the fantasy series _Harry Potter_, Narcissa Malfoy, a minor antagonist, is named for Narcissus.

William Faulkner's character "Narcissa" in _Sanctuary_, sister of Horace Benbow, was also named after Narcissus. Throughout the novel, she allows the arrogant, pompous pressures of high-class society to overrule the unconditional love that she should have for her brother.

Hermann Hesse's character "Narcissus" in "Narcissus and Goldmund" shares several of mythical Narcissus' traits, although his narcissism is based on his intellect rather than his physical beauty.

A. E. Housman refers to the 'Greek Lad', Narcissus, in his poem _Look not in my Eyes_ from _A Shropshire Lad_ set to music by several English composers including George Butterworth. At the end of the poem stands a jonquil, a variety of daffodil, Narcissus Jonquilla, which like Narcissus looks sadly down into the water.

Herman Melville references the myth of Narcissus in his novel Moby-Dick, in which Ishmael explains the myth as "the key to it all," referring to the greater theme of finding the essence of Truth through the physical world.

On Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen's A Fada Oriana, the eponymous protagonist is punished with mortality for abandoning her duties in order to stare at herself in the surface of a river.

Joseph Conrad's novel The Nigger of the 'Narcissus' features a merchant ship named _Narcissus_. An incident involving the ship, and the difficult decisions made by the crew, explore themes involving self-interest vs. altruism and humanitarianism.

Film and television

In the TV series Boardwalk Empire, a Dr. Narcisse (Valentin Narcisse) is introduced as a condescending intellectual.

Scottish-Canadian animator Norman McLaren finished his career with a short film named _Narcissus_, re-telling the Greek legend through ballet.

Narcissus appears in the Disney adaptation of _Hercules_. In the film, he is portrayed as an Olympian god with purple skin.

In the film Bab'Aziz, directed by Nacer Khemir, a Narcissus like character was portrayed by an ancient prince who sat by a pond for days after days and looked at the reflection of his own soul. He was referred to as 'The prince who contemplated his soul'.

_Pink Narcissus_ is an artistic film by James Bidgood about the fantasies of a hustler.

The escape craft Ripley boards in the 1979 Ridley Scott film Alien is called the Narcissus.

Narcissus is the name of Laurel and Hardy's goat in their 1940 film _Saps At Sea_.

The Neon Demon, a 2016 psychological horror film by Nicolas Winding Refn, is loosely based on the story of Narcissus.

Narcissus is the name of the host club in the 2018 Japanese drama Todome no Kiss. The lead character, Otaro Dojima (Kento Yamazaki), works in the nightclub as a sought-after host under the stage name Eight and just like Narcissus, he is narcissist and disregards the feelings of others; he uses women for money and power.

Music

National Medal Of Arts recipient Morten Lauridsen wrote a choral work entitled "Dirait-on" based on the poem by Rainer Maria Rilke.

"Narcissus" is a popular melody from "Water Scenes" by American composer Ethelbert Nevin.

"Supper's Ready" by Genesis (ca. 1972), a near-23-minute epic song laden with religious and mythological imagery, refers to the myth of Narcissus as follows: _A young figure sits still by the pool / He's been stamped "Human Bacon" by some butchery tool / (He is you) / Social Security took care of this lad. / We watch in reverence, as Narcissus is turned to a flower. / A flower?_. The movement is titled "How Dare I Be So Beautiful?".

Progressive metal band Threshold referenced the myth with an 11-minute epic titled "Narcissus", the closing track on their album _Hypothetical_. Greek metal band Septic Flesh recorded a song about Narcissus (called "Narcissus") on their album _Communion_.

The cerebral rock band "Glass Wave" retells the Narcissus story from the perspective of the nymph Echo in their song "Echo," from their self-titled album "Glass Wave" (2010).

"Narcissus in a Red Dress" by The Like was released on _The Like EP_ and their album _Release Me_. The Canadian band Hedley has written a song about Narcissus (called "Narcissist"). One line goes _He falls in love with his reflection in the glass / He can't resist who's staring back_

In 2010, Swedish electronic artist pacific! released "Narcissus" an album and ballet staged in Gothenburg.[15] In 1994, composer Mark Applebaum composed Narcissus: Strata/Panacea for marimba solo. This work comprised one movement of the larger Janus Cycle, for mixed instrumentation.[16] In 1987, Thea Musgrave was commissioned by a consortium of four flutists for a solo work. She composed Narcissus for flute and digital delay.[17] German composer Matthias Pintscher composed his first cello concerto based on this mythology figure, titled "Reflections on Narcissus".
