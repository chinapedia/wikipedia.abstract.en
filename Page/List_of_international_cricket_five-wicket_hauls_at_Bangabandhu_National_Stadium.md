The Bangabandhu National Stadium, also known as the Dhaka Stadium is located in Dhaka, is a sports ground in Bangladesh that has hosted international cricket matches along with provincial games. The venue was the home of the men's and currently Bangladesh national football team. It hosted its last international cricket match on 1 March 2005, until International Cricket status was shifted to Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium.

In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a "five-for" or "fifer")[1][2] refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement.[3]

The first bowler to take a five-wicket haul in a Test match at Dhaka Stadium was Ghulam Ahmed for India against Pakistan way back in 1955; he finished the innings with bowling figures of five wickets for 109 runs. The best figures in Test cricket at this venue are 7 wickets for 77 runs, taken by Pakistan's Danish Kaneria against Bangladesh in 2002. Pakistan's Fazal Mahmood has the most Test fifers with three at Dhaka Stadium. Until its closure in 2005 by ICC, there have been 31 Test match five-wicket hauls at this ground.[4]

The first ODI fifer at the ground was taken by Indian Arshad Ayub in 1988 where he took five wickets for 25 runs against Pakistan. Best bowling figures of six for 35 runs against Bangladesh was taken by Pakistani pacer Abdul Razzaq in 2002. Until its last ODI in 2005, a total of six fifers has been taken at the venue.[5]
