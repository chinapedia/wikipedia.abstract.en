Critical reception

Ronald McCuaig in _The Bulletin_ noted "The masterpiece of Fitzgerald's book is 'The Wind at Your Door', for those who like what you might call representational poetry the finest poem he has written. In the meditative and metaphysical pieces and suites which precede it he is as good as ever he was; there is the same sharp acquisitive eye for image."[3]

In his review of the poetry collection in _The Sydney Morning Herald_ Gustav Cross opined: "Directness, lucidity and a beautifully exact dramatic or logical construction mean much more to Mr Fitzgerald than richness of verbal texture. As in 'The Wind at Your Door,' the poet is most concerned to find a pattern of meaning underlying the chaos and senseless violence around us."[4]
