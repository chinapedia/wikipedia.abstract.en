The SCENIC RIM LOCAL HERITAGE REGISTER is a heritage register containing a list of culturally-significant places within the Scenic Rim Region, Queensland, Australia. Under Section 113 of the Queensland Heritage Act 1992, all local government authorities in Queensland must maintain a local heritage register.[1]

On 29 July 2014, the Scenic Rim Council established a local heritage register with 54 places of local cultural significance based on the critieria of the Australia ICOMOS Burra Charter 1999.[2]
