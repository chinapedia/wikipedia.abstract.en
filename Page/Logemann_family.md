The LOGEMANN FAMILY is a Brazilian family of northern German descent. They operate as a family enterprise, and have a full stake in Grupo SLC, a conglomerate of agroindustrial companies, one of them being SLC Agrícola , an agricultural company and land-holding corporation with properties totalling around , which ranks the Logemann Family as the 53rd largest private landowner globally.[1]

The family, after selling their John Deere stake in 1999, heavily invested in cotton, which placed them at the very top of global production.[2]

All family members live in Porto Alegre, the capital of Brazil's southern-most state Rio Grande do Sul. According to _Forbes_ in 2014, the family shares a 3 billion-dollar empire divided between 19 blood members.[3]

The family has kept away from media attention, valuing discretion above all else.


Business Activities

The Logemann family began its business activities with Frederico Jorge Logemann, who founded Schneider & Logemann Cia LDTA. This company had a humble shop that repaired and manufactured agricultural tools for the village. Upon development, the company began producing their own threshers.[4] Jorge Antonio Dahne Logemann then took control upon his father's death, and began development of automotive harvesting machines, being the first of the Southern Hemisphere to ever produce one. Mr. Jorge Logemann then founded SLC Agrícola in 1977 (now the family's main business) and in 1979 he merged SLC with John Deere for a Joint venture in Brazil.[5] In 1987, Mr. Jorge Antonio Logemann passes away, and his two sons Eduardo and Jorge Luis took leadership of the family's businesses. In 1999, Eduardo and Jorge sell SLC & John Deere back to the John Deere group, and exit the business of tool and machine fabrication.[6] In 2007, the family issues shares of SLC Agricola in B3 (stock exchange), which allowed SLC Agrícola to become one of the 10 most important company of Rio Grande do Sul.[7] In 2017, the family sold one of their businesses, Ferramentas Gerias, to Grupo OVD for an undisclosed amount.[8]
