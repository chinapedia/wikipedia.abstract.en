Formation and early years

Brothers Jim Sangster and Johnny Sangster grew up in Seattle, Washington, but spent summers on Lopez Island, Washington, where their parents have resided since 1988. The brothers attended a year of high school on the island, where they formed their first bands, performing at the high school and the American Legion hall.[3]

In 1984, Johnny relocated to Denmark, where he led the Copenhagen-based The Sharing Patrol until 1997. Returning to Seattle in 1997, he connected with Egg Studios owner Conrad Uno, who enlisted Johnny’s engineering assistance.[4]

After recording 4 albums with The Model Rockets, John Ramberg had begun work on a solo album with drummer Bill Rieflin (R.E.M., Ministry, The Minus 5). In 2006, those sessions, with the contribution of the Sangster brothers, evolved into the formation of the group The Tripwires.[5]


Releases

The first The Tripwires album _Makes You Look Around_ was released in 2007 on the Paisley Pop label and featured support from Scott McCaughey and technical help from Kurt Bloch. Reviewers praised the album, calling it melodic but powerful pop, bright and propulsive, filled with melodic hooks.[6]

A second album, _House to House,_ was released in 2009 on the Spark & Shine label, featuring production by Johnny Sangster and engineering by Sangster and Jon Erwie. The album was described in reviews as explosive power pop.[7]

In 2014, a third album _Get Young_ was released, this time on the Folc Records label. It was recorded by Jack Endino (Nirvana, Soundgarden, Mark Lanegan, Afghan Whigs) and produced by Johnny Sangster. The album was released via Bandcamp.[8] Reviews were positive, citing similarities to Squeeze and Elvis Costello, and describing the music as pub rock for a new generation.[9]

A 2017 EP _Fat City Let's Go!_ was released on ten-inch vinyl and digitally via Folc/Bandcamp.[10] The EP cover features art by Jeremy Eaton.[11]
