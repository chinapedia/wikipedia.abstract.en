JOHN WINSLOW IRVING (born JOHN WALLACE BLUNT JR.; March 2, 1942)[1] is an American novelist and screenwriter.

Irving achieved critical and popular acclaim after the international success of _The World According to Garp_ in 1978. Many of Irving's novels, including _The Cider House Rules_ (1985), _A Prayer for Owen Meany_ (1989), and _A Widow for One Year_ (1998) have been bestsellers. He won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay in the 72nd Academy Awards (1999) for his script of _The Cider House Rules_.[2]

Five of his novels have been adapted into films (_Garp_, _Hotel_, _Meany_, _Cider_, _Widow_). Several of Irving's books (_Garp_, _Meany_, _Widow_) and short stories have been set in and around Phillips Exeter Academy in the town of Exeter, New Hampshire.


Early life

Irving was born John Wallace Blunt, Jr. in Exeter, New Hampshire, the son of Helen Frances (née Winslow) and John Wallace Blunt, Sr., a writer and executive recruiter;[3][4] but the couple separated during pregnancy.[5] Irving grew up in Exeter with a stepfather who was a Phillips Exeter Academy faculty member. His name is Colin Franklin Newell Irving. His uncle, Hammy Bissell, was also part of the faculty. John Irving was in the Phillips Exeter wrestling program as a student athlete and as an assistant coach, and wrestling features prominently in his books, stories, and life. While a student at Exeter, Irving was taught by author and Christian theologian Frederick Buechner, whom he quoted in an epigraph in _A Prayer for Owen Meany_.

Irving's biological father, whom he never met, had been a pilot in the Army Air Forces and, during World War II, was shot down over Burma in July 1943,[6] but somehow survived. (The incident was incorporated into his novel _The Cider House Rules_.) Irving did not find out about his father's heroism until 1981, when he was almost 40 years old.[7]


Career

Irving's career began at the age of 26 with the publication of his first novel, _Setting Free the Bears_ (1968). The novel was reasonably well reviewed but failed to gain a large readership. In the late 1960s, he studied with Kurt Vonnegut at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop.[8] His second and third novels, _The Water-Method Man_ (1972) and _The 158-Pound Marriage_ (1974), were similarly received. In 1975, Irving accepted a position as assistant professor of English at Mount Holyoke College.[9]

Frustrated at the lack of promotion his novels were receiving from his first publisher, Random House, Irving offered his fourth novel, _The World According to Garp_ (1978), to Dutton, which promised him stronger commitment to marketing. The novel became an international bestseller and cultural phenomenon. It was a finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction in 1979 (which ultimately went to Tim O'Brien for _Going After Cacciato_)[10] and its first paperback edition won the Award the next year.[11][12] _Garp_ was later made into a film directed by George Roy Hill and starring Robin Williams in the title role and Glenn Close as his mother; it garnered several Academy Award nominations, including nominations for Close and John Lithgow. Irving makes a brief Cameo appearance in the film as an official in one of Garp's high school wrestling matches. John_Irving.jpeg _The World According to Garp_ was among three books recommended to the Pulitzer Advisory Board for consideration for the 1979 Award in Fiction in the Pulitzer Jury Committee report, although the award was given to _The Stories of John Cheever_ (1978).[13]

_Garp_ transformed Irving from an obscure, academic literary writer to a household name, and his subsequent books were bestsellers. The next was _The Hotel New Hampshire_ (1981), which sold well despite mixed reviews from critics. Like _Garp_, the novel was quickly made into a film, this time directed by Tony Richardson and starring Jodie Foster, Rob Lowe, and Beau Bridges. "Interior Space", a short story originally published in _Fiction_ magazine in 1980, later appeared in the 1981 O. Henry Prize Stories collection.[14]

In 1985, Irving published _The Cider House Rules_. An epic set in a Maine orphanage, the novel's central topic is abortion. Many drew parallels between the novel and Charles Dickens' _Oliver Twist_ (1838). Irving's next novel was _A Prayer for Owen Meany_ (1989), another New England family epic about religion set in a New England boarding school and in Toronto, Ontario. The novel was influenced by _The Tin Drum_ (1959) by Günter Grass,[15] and the plot contains further allusions to _The Scarlet Letter_ (1850) by Nathaniel Hawthorne and the works of Dickens. In _Owen Meany,_ Irving for the first time examined the consequences of the Vietnam War—particularly mandatory conscription, which Irving avoided because he was a married father when of age for the draft.[16] _Owen Meany_ became Irving's best selling book since _Garp._

Irving returned to Random House for his next book, _A Son of the Circus_ (1995). Arguably his most complicated and difficult book, and a departure from many of the themes and location settings in his previous novels, it was dismissed by critics[17] but became a national bestseller on the strength of Irving's reputation for fashioning literate, engrossing page-turners. Irving returned in 1998 with _A Widow for One Year_, which was named a _New York Times_ Notable Book.[18]

In 1999, after nearly 10 years in development, Irving's screenplay for _The Cider House Rules_ was made into a film directed by Lasse Hallström, starring Michael Caine, Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, and Delroy Lindo. Irving also made a cameo appearance as the disapproving stationmaster. The film was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and earned Irving an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.[19]

Soon afterward, Irving wrote _My Movie Business_, a memoir about his involvement in creating the film version of _The Cider House Rules_. After its publication in 1999, Irving appeared on the CBC Television program _Hot Type_ to promote the book. During the interview, Irving criticized bestselling American author Tom Wolfe, saying Wolfe "can't write", and that Wolfe's writing makes Irving gag.[20] Wolfe appeared on _Hot Type_ later that year, calling Irving, Norman Mailer, and John Updike his "three stooges" who were panicked by his newest novel, _A Man in Full_ (1998).

Irving's 10th book, _The Fourth Hand_ (2001), also became a bestseller. In 2004, _A Sound Like Someone Trying Not to Make a Sound_, a children's picture book originally included in _A Widow for One Year_, was published with illustrations by Tatjana Hauptmann. Irving's 11th novel, _Until I Find You_, was released on July 12, 2005.

On June 28, 2005, _The New York Times_ published an article revealing that _Until I Find You_ (2005) contains two specifically personal elements about his life that he had never before discussed publicly: his sexual abuse at age 11 by an older woman, and the recent entrance in his life of his biological father's family.[21]

In his 12th novel, _Last Night in Twisted River_, published in 2009, Irving's central character is a novelist with, as critic Boyd Tonkin puts it, "a career that teasingly follows Irving's own".[22]

Irving has had four novels reach number one on the bestseller list of _The New York Times_: _The Hotel New Hampshire_ (September 27, 1981), which stayed number one for seven weeks, and was in the top 15 for over 27 weeks; _The Cider House Rules_ (June 16, 1985); _A Widow for One Year_ (June 14, 1998); and _The Fourth Hand_ (July 29, 2001).


Other projects

JohnIrving1989.jpg Since the publication of _Garp_ made him independently wealthy, Irving has sporadically accepted short-term teaching positions (including one at his _alma mater_, the Iowa Writers' Workshop) and served as an assistant coach on his sons' high school wrestling teams. (Irving was inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame as an "Outstanding American" in 1992.[23][24]) In addition to his novels, he has also published _Trying to Save Piggy Sneed_ (1996), a collection of his writings including a brief memoir and unpublished short fiction, _My Movie Business_, an account of the protracted process of bringing _The Cider House Rules_ to the big screen, and _The Imaginary Girlfriend_, a short memoir focusing on writing and wrestling. In 2010, Irving revealed that he and Tod "Kip" Williams, director and writer of _The Door in the Floor_ (2004), were co-writing a screenplay for an adaptation of _A Widow for One Year_ (1998).


Recent

In 2002, his four most highly regarded novels, _The World According to Garp_, _The Cider House Rules_, _A Prayer for Owen Meany_, and _A Widow for One Year_, have been published in Modern Library editions.[25] _Owen Meany_ was adapted into the 1998 film _Simon Birch_ (Irving required that the title and character names be changed because the screenplay's story was "markedly different" from that of the novel; Irving is on record as having enjoyed the film, however[26]). In 2004, a portion of _A Widow for One Year_ was adapted into _The Door in the Floor_, starring Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger.

In a _New York Magazine_ interview in 2009, Irving stated that he had begun work on a new novel, his 13th, based in part on a speech from Shakespeare's _Richard II._ Simon & Schuster published the novel, titled _In One Person_ (2012), taking over from Random House. _In One Person_ has a first-person viewpoint, Irving's first such narrative since _A Prayer for Owen Meany_ (Irving decided to change the first-person narrative of _Until I Find You_ to third person less than a year before publication).[27] _In One Person_ features a 60-year-old, bisexual protagonist named William, looking back on his life in the 1950s and '60s. The novel shares a similar theme and concern with _The World According to Garp_, which was Irving says, in part about "people who hate you for your sexual differences."[28]

He won a Lambda Literary Award in 2013 in the Bisexual Fiction category for _In One Person_, and was also awarded the organization's Bridge Builder Award to honor him as an ally of the LGBT community.[29]

On June 10, 2013, Irving announced his next novel, his 14th, titled _Avenue of Mysteries_, named after a street in Mexico City.[30] In an interview the previous year, he had revealed the last line of the book: "Not every collision course comes as a surprise."[31]

On December 19, 2014, Irving posted a message on the Facebook page devoted to him and his work that he had "finished 'Avenue of Mysteries.' It is a shorter novel for me, comparable in length to 'In One Person.'"[32] Irving speculated that "if everything remains on schedule, the English-language editions should be published in fall 2015." Simon & Schuster published the book in November, 2015.[33]

On November 3, 2015, Irving revealed that he'd been approached by HBO and Warner Brothers to reconstruct _The World According to Garp_ as a miniseries. He described the project as being in the early stages.[34]

According to the byline of a self-penned, February 20, 2017 essay for The Hollywood Reporter, Irving completed his teleplay for the five-part series based on _The World According to Garp_, and he is currently working on his fifteenth novel.

On June 28, 2017, Irving revealed in a long letter to fans on Facebook that his new novel will be, primarily, a ghost story.[35] "...I have a history of being interested in ghosts. And here come the ghosts again. In my new novel, my fifteenth, the ghosts are more prominent than before; the novel begins and ends with them. Like _A Widow for One Year_, this novel is constructed as a play in three acts. I'm calling Act I 'Early Signs.' I began writing it on New Year's Eve—not a bad night to start a ghost story."

On August 1, 2017, an update about Irving's fifteenth, in-progress, novel, was posted to his Facebook page: "It's been 45 years since John Irving published _The Water-Method Man_. While his second novel is regarded as a purely comic tale, and John's current project is a darker contemplation of life's disruptive forces, the two novels bear some resemblance to one another. John Irving is once again experimenting with framed narratives and writing about the evolution of a writer—like Bogus Trumper, one who writes screenplays. This time, we see the main character—Adam Brewster—mature, from childhood and early adolescence, to become a writer like Garp, or Ruth Cole, or Juan Diego, as if writing were an inevitability given the fateful circumstances of his life. And, along the way, despite the darkness, there are points of humor. John's work in progress may ultimately be his funniest novel since _The Water-Method Man_."

In an interview with Mike Kilen for _The Des Moines Register_, published on October 26, 2017, Irving revealed that the title of his new novel-in-progress is _Darkness As a Bride_.[36] The title comes from lines in Shakespeare's play, _Measure for Measure:_ "If I must die, / I will encounter darkness as a bride, / and hug it in mine arms."

In July 2018, the Dayton Literary Peace Prize announced Irving would be the recipient of the 2018 Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award at its annual gala October 28, 2018, in Dayton, Ohio.[37][38]
