_OXYCHEILINUS MENTALIS_ (MENTAL WRASSE) is a species of wrasse found in the Western Indian Ocean, in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.[1]

It has been known to change its colouration to match species of non-predatory parrotfish and surgeonfish. It then swims with these harmless model species and predates upon passing fish. This is a form of aggressive mimicry.[2] Without a model fish, the mental wrasse has a redish pink colour.
