The 1955 BOWLING GREEN FALCONS FOOTBALL TEAM was an American football team that represented Bowling Green State University in the Mid-American Conference (MAC) during the 1955 college football season. In their first season under head coach Doyt Perry, the Falcons compiled a 7–1–1 record (4–1–1 against MAC opponents), shut out five opponents, finished in second place in the MAC, and outscored all opponents by a combined total of 224 to 53. The team's only loss was by a 7-0 score against MAC champion Miami.[1]

Bo Schembechler was an assistant coach on Perry's staff during the 1955 season.[2] Schembechler later said, "I don't believe I can name a coach, anywhere, anytime, anyhow, who did it better than Doyt Perry."[3]

The team's statistical leaders were Jim Bryan with 499 passing yards, Carlos Jackson with 505 rushing yards, and Jack Hecker with 556 receiving yards.[4] Jack Hecker was the team captain.[5] Carlos Jackson received the team's Most Valuable Player award.[6] The team established a team record (later tied by the 1957 team) by allowing only eight touchdowns in the entire season.[7]
