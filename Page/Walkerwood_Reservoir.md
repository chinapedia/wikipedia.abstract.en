Walkerwood_Reservoir_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1399979.jpg Walkerwood_Reservoir_-_panoramio.jpg WALKERWOOD RESERVOIR is the lowest reservoir of a series of four in the Brushes valley above Stalybridge in Greater Manchester,[1] built in the 19th century to provide a supply of safe drinking water. It is owned and operated by United Utilities. The reservoir dam consists of a clay core within an earth embankment. The embankment was originally protected from erosion with stone pitching. At a later stage these were overlain with in-situ concrete slabs, which in turn have deteriorated over the years. [2]

The revetment was increasing vulnerable to wave action so has been strengthened by filling existing holes in the concrete with lean sand asphalt (LSA) and overlaying with open stone asphalt (OSA).[3]
