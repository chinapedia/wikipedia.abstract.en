JACKSON PAGE (born 8 August 2001 in Ebbw Vale, Blaenau Gwent) is a Welsh snooker player. He is the current European U-21 champion[1] and the former Under-18 World Snooker Champion and in 2017 also became the Under-18 European Snooker Champion.[2][3]


Career

In February 2016, Page entered the 2016 EBSA European Under-18 Snooker Championship as the number 13 seed, he managed to advance to the final where he was defeated 5–2 by fellow countryman Tyler Rees.[4][5] Later that year in August, Page competed in the 2016 IBSF World Under-18 Snooker Championship where he once again advanced to the final and defeated the number 1 seed Yun Fung Tam 5–4. As a result, Page was awarded with a place in the qualifying rounds for the 2017 World Snooker Championship.[6]

Page was awarded a wildcard entry in to the 2017 Welsh Open. In the first round he beat Jason Weston 4–3 on a re-spotted black.[7] He then progressed to the third round by defeating John Astley by the same scoreline, before losing 4–0 to Judd Trump.[8] In the qualifiers for the World Championship he was edged out 10–9 on the final pink by Martin O'Donnell in the first round.[9] A fourth and fifth round showing in the two Q School events saw him finish fifth on the Order of Merit. A top four placing would have seen him join the professional tour.[10] He entered Q School in May 2018 in a bid to win a full-time place on the snooker professional tour.[11] He suffered a surprise defeat to Ben Hancorn in round 2 of event one.[12]
