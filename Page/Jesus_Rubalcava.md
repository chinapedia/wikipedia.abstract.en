Controversies

Debbie Lesko, by stating that he "wanted to punch her in the throat," after the passage of Lesko’s school voucher expansion bill. The post was deleted after local news outlets reported on it and Rubalcava subsequently made a formal apology to Lesko on the floor of the Arizona House of Representatives.[4]

In May 2017, an audit by Arizona's Clean Elections Commission, found that Rubalcava spent $9,200 in publicly funded campaign money that could not be determined as campaign related.[5]
