History

The company traces its founding to the George Hyman Construction Company which as an excavation only company in 1906 in Washington, DC where business boomed as it initially had the only steam shovel in Washington.[6] In 1923 the company began doing actual construction with its first contract for Wheatley Junior High School. The company was involved in numerous military construction projects during World War II.[7]

Hyman died in 1959 and was succeeded by his nephew Benjamin Rome.[8]

In 1969 A. James Clark bought the company from the Hyman family[9] and oversaw major growth including one of its earliest projects L'Enfant Plaza in Washington. Clark formed separate company 1977 for non-union projects in the Washington area (Hyman legally could not bid on such projects).[10] In 1995 Clark merged construction companies of Hyman, Shirley Contracting Company, Guy F. Atkinson Construction and OMNI to form Clark Construction.[11]

In 2016 a year after Clark died, the construction firm management bought the company from its parent Clark Enterprises leaving the parent to concentrate on its private equity, financial and real estate markets.[12]


Controversies

In June 2018, three black employees employed as elevator operators by a Clark Construction subcontractor in San Francisco alleged that they were targeted at work with racial slurs, including verbal abuse, written abuse on walls, and black dolls hung from nooses. It was reported that the employees were planning on suing Clark Construction.[13][14]
