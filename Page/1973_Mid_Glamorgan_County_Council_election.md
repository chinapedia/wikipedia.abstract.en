The first election to Mid Glamorgan County Council and was held in April 1973.[1] It was followed by the 1977 election.

The new authority was established following the division of the former Glamorgan County Council into three new authorities.


Candidates

The Labour Party fielded candidates in every ward. A significant proportion of seats were contested by the Conservative Party and Plaid Cymru with fewer candidates fielded by the Liberal Party.

Numerous members of the former Glamorgan County Council stood for election, notably for Labour. These included Alfred Bowen (Bridgend) and Bertie Rowland (Caerphilly).

Fred Riddiford, former Labour councilor for Aberaman on the former Glamorgan authority, contested the seat for Plaid Cymru.
