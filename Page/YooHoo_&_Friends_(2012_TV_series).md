_YOOHOO & FRIENDS_ is an American animated children's television adaptation of the 2009 Korean TV series of the same name, created by David Feiss. It is the second TV series based on the _YooHoo & Friends_ franchise. Changes to the original series were made to better fit western television,[1] such as the series' premise, a story about a group of humans who are turned into animals by Father Time. The series debuted on Cartoon Network in Latin America on January 8, 2012.[2]


Plot

_YooHoo & Friends_ is about five executives who worked for Nasty Corporation. When Mother Nature notices that they've been slowly destroying the world, she pressures Father Time to stop them from polluting the Earth by turning them into five animals. Together, Lemmee the sourpuss, Roodee the inventor, Pammee the princess, optimistic Chewoo, and their leader YooHoo save the world from all of the environmental disasters they caused as their former human-selves, in return for the gemstones Father Time planted in the locations they visit. When all of the gems are found, the Furry 5 are able to make a wish to become human again.

Each episode also includes a narration from Father Time as he goes back to certain times from the past and fixes them.


Characters

Main

-   Father Time (voiced by Flavor Flav) controls time and acts as the narrator of the series, introducing each episode.

Production

David Feiss stated in an interview that he was contacted by Konnie Kwak, the president of Toonzone Studios, to make the original _YooHoo & Friends_ series into something he could sell to western television. He then approached it similarly to Woody Allen's _What's Up, Tiger Lily?_, where "a foreign language film is re-dubbed in English with an entirely different story, it could be funny." He rewrote dialogue and created 4 minutes of new animation per episode. Feiss has also said that he moved to a house across from Flavor Flav, the voice of Father Time and he agreed to be on the show.[3]

Kwak once saw _YooHoo & Friends_ stuffed toys and thought "they looked pretty cute. The toys had already inspired a 52-episode animated series for younger kids, which aired in South Korea and had received many prestigious awards in that country. But like many Korean properties, it doesn't translate well overseas. So [they planned] to repurpose the episodes to broaden the market." The team had prepared the adaptation for a six to 12-year-old demographic.[4]

Eventually, the series wasn't renewed for another season, causing Toonzone Studios to take legal action against Aurora World over the contractual rights of the series.[5] Aurora World ended up breaking the deal with Toonzone and licensed its franchise to its new distributor, Lawless Entertainment, in June 2014.[6]

The series also premiered on ABC Me in Australia on February 15, 2012,[9] and on Pop in the United Kingdom in the same year.[10] The series' distributor, Moonscoop US, originally planned for the show to air on French and German-speaking territories across Europe, "with hopes to reach televisions in next summer,"[11] but this never happened.
