SO'OTALA FA'ASO'O (born 2 October 1994) is a New Zealand-born, Samoan rugby union player who currently plays as a loose forward for Brive in France's domestic Top 14.[1][2]


Senior career

Fa'aso'o has had something of a nomadic career which started in 2013 with his local province, Auckland. He made 2 appearances for them before shifting south the following season to join Manawatu. He didn't manage to make the field for them so was forced to drop down to New Zealand's Heartland Championship with Wairarapa Bush in 2015. Solid performances there saw him earn another shot at Mitre 10 Cup rugby with the Pukekohe-based Counties Manukau in 2016 where he played all 11 games as the Steelers reached the Premiership Semi-Finals before going down to eventual winners .[3]

His appearances in New Zealand brought him to the attention of French-side Racing 92 who announced in November 2016 that they had signed Fa'aso'o on a contract until the end of the 2016â€“17 Top 14 season.[4]


International

Fa'aso'o was a member of the Samoa Under 20 side which competed in the 2014 IRB Junior World Championship in New Zealand, making 3 appearances and scoring 1 try.[5]
