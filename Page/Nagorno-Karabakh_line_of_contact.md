The Nagorno-Karabakh LINE OF CONTACT (, _shp’man gits_, ) is a militarized separation barrier that separates the Armenian forces (namely the Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army) and the Azerbaijan Armed Forces in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. It was formed in the aftermath of the May 1994 ceasefire that ended the Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988–94).[1] The mountain range of Murovdag (Mrav) is the northern part of the line of contact and is essentially a natural border between the two forces.[2][3] The length of the line of contact is not well-defined. According to various sources it ranges from [4] to .[5]

The line of contact was, immediately after the ceasefire, a "relatively quiet zone with barbed wire and lightly armed soldiers sitting in trenches", according to Thomas de Waal. There was also a relatively large no-man’s land after the ceasefire which was several kilometers wide in some places. It was reduced to a few hundred meters in most areas of the line of contact due to Azerbaijani redeployments into the former neutral zone.[6] By contrast, in 2016, there were around 20,000 men on each side of the heavily militarized line of contact.[7] Since the ceasefire the line of contact has become a heavily militarized, fortified and mined no-man's-land and a buffer zone of trenches.[8][9][10] According to de Waal, it is the "most militarised zone in the wider Europe,"[11] and one of the three most militarized zones in the world (along with Kashmir and Korea).[12] The trenches along the line of contact have been extensively compared to those of World War I.[13][14][15]

The line of contact is regularly monitored by a group of six OSCE observers, headed by Andrzej Kasprzyk of Poland.[16] There are exchanges of fire virtually on a daily basis.[17] There have been occasional significant violations of the ceasefire,[18] usually characterized by low-intensity fighting.[19] Significant fighting occurred in April 2016,[20] when for the first time since the ceasefire the line of contact was shifted, though not significantly.[21]


Terminology

Some Armenian analysts, including Ara Papian encourage the Armenian side to avoid the term "line of contact", instead calling it a "state border" between Artsakh and Azerbaijan.[22][23] Independent journalist and author Tatul Hakobyan writes of it as a state border of Azerbaijan and Artsakh and notes it is called the "line of contact" in international lexicon.[24]
