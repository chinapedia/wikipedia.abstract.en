He won a Pulitzer Prize and received Tony nominations for his plays _Glengarry Glen Ross_ (1984) and _Speed-the-Plow_ (1988). He first gained critical acclaim for a trio of off-Broadway 70s plays: _The Duck Variations,_ _Sexual Perversity in Chicago,_ and _American Buffalo._[1] His plays _Race_ and _The Penitent_, respectively, opened on Broadway in 2009 and previewed off-Broadway in 2017.

Feature films that Mamet both wrote and directed include _House of Games_ (1987), _Homicide_ (1991), _The Spanish Prisoner_ (1997), _Heist_ (2001), and _Redbelt_ (2008).

Mamet himself wrote the screenplay for the 1992 adaptation of _Glengarry Glen Ross_, and wrote and directed the 1994 adaptation of his play _Oleanna_ (1992). He was the executive producer and frequent writer for the TV show _The Unit_ (2006–2009).

Mamet's books include: _The Old Religion_ (1997), a novel about the lynching of Leo Frank; _Five Cities of Refuge: Weekly Reflections on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy_ (2004), a Torah commentary with Rabbi Lawrence Kushner; _The Wicked Son_ (2006), a study of Jewish self-hatred and antisemitism; _Bambi vs. Godzilla_, a commentary on the movie business; _The Secret Knowledge: On the Dismantling of American Culture_ (2011), a commentary on cultural and political issues; and _Three War Stories_ (2013), a trio of novellas about the physical and psychological effects of war.


Early Life

Mamet was born in 1947 in Chicago to Lenore June (née Silver), a teacher, and Bernard Morris Mamet, a labor attorney. Mamet's father was the son of Polish Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants.[2][3] One of his earliest jobs was as a busboy at Chicago's London House and The Second City. He also worked as an actor, editor for _Oui_ magazine and as a cab-driver.[4] He was educated at the progressive Francis W. Parker School and at Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont. At the Chicago Public Library Foundation 20th anniversary fundraiser in 2006, though, Mamet announced "My alma mater is the Chicago Public Library. I got what little educational foundation I got in the third-floor reading room, under the tutelage of a Coca-Cola sign".[5]

After a move to Chicago's North Side, Mamet encountered theater director Robert Sickinger, and began to work occasionally at Sickinger's Hull House Theatre. This represented the beginning of Mamet's lifelong involvement with the theater.[6]


Career

Theater

Mamet is a founding member of the Atlantic Theater Company; he first gained acclaim for a trio of off-Broadway plays in 1976, _The Duck Variations,_ _Sexual Perversity in Chicago,_ and _American Buffalo._[7] He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1984 for _Glengarry Glen Ross,_ which received its first Broadway revival in the summer of 2005. His play _Race_, which opened on Broadway on December 6, 2009 and featured James Spader, David Alan Grier, Kerry Washington, and Richard Thomas in the cast, received mixed reviews.[8] His play _The Anarchist_, starring Patti LuPone and Debra Winger, in her Broadway debut, opened on Broadway on November 13, 2012 in previews and was scheduled to close on December 16, 2012.[9] His 2017 play _The Penitent_ previewed off-Broadway on February 8, 2017.

In 2002, Mamet was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.[10] Mamet later received the PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award for Grand Master of American Theater in 2010.

In 2017, Mamet released an online class for writers entitled _David Mamet teaches dramatic writing_.[11]

It was announced in 2019 that David Mamet will return to the London West End with his new play Bitter Wheat starring John Malkovich.[12]

Film

Mamet first film work was as a screenwriter, later directing his own scripts.

Mamet's first produced screenplay was the 1981 production of _The Postman Always Rings Twice_, based on James M. Cain's novel. He received an Academy Award nomination one year later for _The Verdict_, written in the late 1970s. He also wrote the screenplay for _The Untouchables_ (1987), _Hoffa_ (1992), _The Edge_ (1997), _Wag the Dog_ (1997), _Ronin_ (1998), and _Hannibal_ (2001).

In 1987, Mamet made his film directing debut with his screenplay _House of Games_, which won Best Film and Best Screenplay awards at the 1987 Venice Film Festival and the Film of the Year in 1989 from the London Film Critics' Circle Awards. The film starred his then-wife, Lindsay Crouse, and many longtime stage associates and friends, including fellow Goddard College graduates.[13] Mamet was quoted as saying, "It was my first film as a director and I needed support, so I stacked the deck." After _House of Games_, Mamet later wrote and directed two more films focusing on the world of con artists, _The Spanish Prisoner_ (1997) and _Heist_ (2001).

Other films that Mamet both wrote and directed include: _Things Change_ (1988), _Homicide_ (1991) (nominated for the Palme d'Or at 1991 Cannes Film Festival and won a "Screenwriter of the Year" award for Mamet from the London Film Critics' Circle Awards), _Oleanna_ (1994), _The Winslow Boy_ (1999), _State and Main_ (2000), _Spartan_ (2004), _Redbelt_ (2008), and the 2013 bio-pic TV movie _Phil Spector_.

A feature-length film, a thriller titled _Blackbird_, was intended for release in 2015, but is still in development.[14][15]

When Mamet adapted his play for the 1992 film _Glengarry Glen Ross_, he wrote an additional part (including the monologue "Coffee's for closers") for Alec Baldwin.

Mamet continues to work with an informal repertory company for his films, including Crouse, William H. Macy, Joe Mantegna, and Rebecca Pidgeon, as well as the aforementioned school friends.

Mamet did a rewrite of the script for _Ronin_ under the pseudonym "Richard Weisz" and turned in an early version of a script for _Malcolm X_ which was rejected by director Spike Lee.[16] In 2000, Mamet directed a film version of _Catastrophe,_ a one-act play by Samuel Beckett featuring Harold Pinter and John Gielgud (in his final screen performance). In 2008, he directed and wrote the mixed martial arts movie _Redbelt,_ about a martial arts instructor tricked into fighting in a professional bout.

In _On Directing Film,_ Mamet asserts that directors should focus on getting the point of a scene across, rather than simply following a protagonist, or adding visually beautiful or intriguing shots. Films should create order from disorder in search of the objective.

Books

In 1990 Mamet published _The Hero Pony_, a 55-page collection of poetry. He has also published a series of short plays, monologues and four novels, _The Village_ (1994), _The Old Religion_ (1997), _Wilson: A Consideration of the Sources_ (2000), and _Chicago_ (2018). He has written several non-fiction texts, and children's stories, including "True and False: Heresy and Common Sense for the Actor"(1997). In 2004 he published a lauded version of the classical Faust story, _Faustus_, however, when the play was staged in San Francisco during the spring of 2004, it was not well received by critics.[17] On May 1, 2010, Mamet released a graphic novel _The Trials of Roderick Spode (The Human Ant)_.

On June 2, 2011, _The Secret Knowledge: On the Dismantling of American Culture_, Mamet's book detailing his conversion from modern liberalism to "a reformed liberal" was released.[18]

Mamet published _Three War Stories_, a collection of novellas, on November 11, 2013. In an interview with Newsmax TV, Mamet said he wanted to write about war, despite never having served. Moreover, the book allowed Mamet to free characters that had occupied his mind for years. On the subject of characters as a reason for writing, Mamet told the host, "You want to get these guys out of your head. You just want them to stop talking to you."[19]

Television and radio

Mamet wrote the "Wasted Weekend" episode of _Hill Street Blues_ that aired in 1987. His then-wife, Lindsay Crouse, appeared in numerous episodes (including that one) as Officer McBride. Mamet is also the creator, producer and frequent writer of the television series _The Unit_, where he wrote a well-circulated memo to the writing staff. He directed a third-season episode of _The Shield_ with Shawn Ryan. In 2007, Mamet directed two television commercials for Ford Motor Company. The two 30-second ads featured the Ford Edge and were filmed in Mamet's signature style of fast-paced dialogue and clear, simple imagery. Mamet's sister, Lynn, is a producer and writer for television shows, such as _The Unit_ and _Law & Order_.

Mamet has contributed several dramas to BBC Radio through Jarvis & Ayres Productions, including an adaptation of _Glengarry Glen Ross_ for BBC Radio 3 and new dramas for BBC Radio 4. The comedy _Keep Your Pantheon (or On the Whole I'd Rather Be in Mesopotamia)_ was aired in 2007.

Other media and political views

Since May 2005 he has been a contributing blogger at _The Huffington Post_, drawing satirical cartoons with themes including political strife in Israel.[20] In a 2008 essay at _The Village Voice_ titled "Why I Am No Longer a 'Brain-Dead Liberal"[21] he revealed that he had gradually rejected so-called political correctness and progressivism and embraced conservatism. Mamet has spoken in interviews of changes in his views,[22] highlighting his agreement with free market theorists such as Friedrich Hayek[23] the historian Paul Johnson, and economist Thomas Sowell, whom Mamet called "one of our greatest minds".

During promotion of a book, Mamet said British people had "a taint of anti-semitism," claiming they "want to give [Israel] away to some people whose claim is rather dubious."[24] In the same interview, Mamet went on to say that "there are famous dramatists and novelists [in the UK] whose works are full of anti-Semitic filth." He refused to give examples because of British libel laws (the interview was conducted in New York City for the _Financial Times_).[25][26] He is known for his pro-Israel positions; in his book _The Secret Knowledge_ he claimed that "Israelis would like to live in peace within their borders; the Arabs would like to kill them all."[27]

Mamet wrote an article for the November 2012 issue of _The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles_ imploring fellow Jewish Americans to vote for Republican nominee Mitt Romney.[28][29]

In an essay for _Newsweek_, published on 29 January 2013, Mamet argued against gun control laws: "It was intended to guard us against this inevitable decay of government that the Constitution was written. Its purpose was and is not to enthrone a Government superior to an imperfect and confused electorate, but to protect us from such a government."[30]

Mamet has described the NFL anthem protests as “absolutely f***ing despicable”.[31]


Critical reception to Mamet

'Mamet speak'

Mamet's style of writing dialogue, marked by a cynical, street-smart edge, precisely crafted for effect, is so distinctive that it has come to be called _Mamet speak._[32] Mamet himself has criticized his (and other writers') tendency to write "pretty" at the expense of sound, logical plots.[33] When asked how he developed his style for writing dialogue, Mamet said, "In my family, in the days prior to television, we liked to while away the evenings by making ourselves miserable, based solely on our ability to speak the language viciously. That's probably where my ability was honed."[34]

One instance of Mamet's dialogue style can be found in _Glengarry Glen Ross_, in which two down-on-their-luck real estate salesmen are considering stealing from their employer's office. George Aaronow and Dave Moss equivocate on the meaning of "talk" and "speak", turning language and meaning to deceptive purposes:

    MOSS No. What do you mean? Have I talked to him about _this_ [Pause]
    AARONOW Yes. I mean are you actually _talking_ about this, or are we just...
    MOSS No, we're just...
    AARONOW We're just _"talking"_ about it.
    MOSS We're just _speaking_ about it. [Pause] As an _idea._
    AARONOW As an idea.
    MOSS Yes.
    AARONOW We're not actually _talking_ about it.
    MOSS No.
    AARONOW Talking about it as a...
    MOSS _No._
    AARONOW As a _robbery._
    MOSS As a "robbery?" No.

Mamet dedicated _Glengarry Glen Ross_ to Harold Pinter, who was instrumental in its being first staged at the Royal National Theatre, (London) in 1983, and whom Mamet has acknowledged as an influence on its success, and on his other work.[35]

Mamet and gender issues

Mamet's plays have frequently sparked debate and controversy.[36] During a staging of _Oleanna_ in 1992, in which a post-secondary student accuses her professor of sexual harassment, a critic reported that the play divided the audience by gender and recounted "couples emerged screaming at each other".[37]

Arthur Holmberg in his 2014 book _David Mamet and Male Friendship_, has reconsidered the gender issue in many of Mamet's plays throughout his career by asserting a prominent and recurrent reversed sexual orientation of portrayed male gender preferences.[38]


Personal life

Mamet and actress Lindsay Crouse married in 1977 and divorced in 1990. The couple have two children, Willa and Zosia. Willa is a professional photographer and Zosia is an actress. Mamet has been married to actress and singer-songwriter Rebecca Pidgeon since 1991. They live together in Santa Monica, California.[39] They have two children, Clara and Noah.

Mamet is a Reform Jew and strongly pro-Israel.[40]


Archive

The papers of David Mamet were sold to the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin in 2007 and first opened for research in 2009.[41] The growing collection consists mainly of manuscripts and related production materials for most of his plays, films, and other writings, but also includes his personal journals from 1966 to 2005. In 2015, the Ransom Center secured a second major addition to Mamet's papers that include more recent works. Additional materials relating to Mamet and his career can be found in the Ransom Center's collections of Robert De Niro, Mel Gussow, Tom Stoppard, Sam Shepard, Paul Schrader, Don DeLillo, and John Russell Brown.
