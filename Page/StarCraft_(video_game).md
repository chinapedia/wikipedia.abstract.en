_STARCRAFT_ is a military science fiction real-time strategy video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment for Microsoft Windows personal computers on March 31, 1998.[1] The game spawned the StarCraft franchise, and became the first game of the video game series. A Classic Mac OS version was released in 1999, and a Nintendo 64 adaptation, co-developed with Mass Media, was released in 2000.[2]

Blizzard started work on the game shortly after _Warcraft II_, another real-time strategy game, was released in 1995. The first incarnation debuted at the 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo, where it was unfavorably compared to _Warcraft II_. As a result, the project was entirely overhauled before being showcased to the public in early 1997, at which time it received a far more positive response. The game's multiplayer is particularly popular in South Korea, as of 2006, where players and teams participate in professional competitions, earn sponsorships, and compete in televised tournaments.[3]

Set in a fictitious future timeline during the 25th century CE in a distant part of the Milky Way galaxy known as the _Koprulu Sector_, the game revolves around three intelligent species fighting for dominance: the Terrans are humans exiled from Earth who are now skilled at adapting to any situation; the Zerg are a race of insectoid aliens in pursuit of genetic perfection and obsessed with assimilating other races; the Protoss are a humanoid species with advanced technology and psionic abilities who are attempting to preserve their civilization and strict philosophy about their way of life from the Zerg.

Many journalists of the industry have praised _StarCraft_ as one of the most important,[4] and one of the greatest video games of all time.[5] The game is also said to have raised the bar for developing real-time strategy (RTS) games.[6] With more than 11 million copies sold worldwide by February 2009, _StarCraft_ became one of the best-selling games for the personal computer.[7] It has been praised for pioneering the use of unique _factions_ in RTS gameplay,[8] and for having a compelling story.[9]

_StarCraft_ has had its storyline adapted and expanded through a series of novels published between 2000 and 2016, the expansion pack _StarCraft: Brood War_, and two officially authorized add-ons, _Insurrection_ and _Retribution_. A sequel, _StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty_, was released in July 2010, which generated two expansion packs and a campaign pack between 2013 and 2016, while a remastered edition of the original and its expansion pack was released in August 2017. The original game, along with the expansion, was released for free in April 2017.[10]


Gameplay

]]

Blizzard Entertainment's use of three distinct races in _StarCraft_ is widely credited with revolutionizing the real-time strategy genre.[11] All units are unique to their respective races and while rough comparisons can be drawn between certain types of units in the technology tree, every unit performs differently and requires different tactics for a player to succeed.

The psionic and technologically adept Protoss have access to powerful units and machinery and advanced technologies such as energy shields and localized warp capabilities, powered by their psionic traits. However, their forces have lengthy and expensive manufacturing processes, encouraging players to follow a strategy of the quality of their units over the quantity.[12] The insectoid Zerg possess entirely organic units and structures, which can be produced quickly and at a far cheaper cost to resources, but are accordingly weaker, relying on sheer numbers and speed to overwhelm enemies.[13] The humanoid Terrans provide a middle ground between the other two races, providing units that are versatile and flexible. They have access to a range of more ballistic military technologies and machinery, such as tanks and nuclear weapons.[14]

Although each race is unique in its composition, no race has an innate advantage over the other. Each species is balanced out so that while they have different strengths, powers, and abilities their overall strength is the same. The balance stays complete via infrequent patches (game updates) provided by Blizzard.[15]

_StarCraft_ features artificial intelligence which scales in difficulty, although the player cannot change the difficulty level in the single-player campaigns. Each campaign starts with enemy factions running easy AI modes, scaling through the course of the campaign to the hardest AI modes. In the level editor provided with the game, a designer has access to four levels of AI difficulties: "easy", "medium", "hard" and "insane", each setting differing in the units and technologies allowed to an AI faction and the extent of the AI's tactical and strategic planning.[16] The single-player campaign consists of thirty missions, split into ten for each race.

Resource management

Each race relies on two resources to sustain their game economies and to build their forces: minerals and vespene gas. Minerals are needed for all units and structures, and are obtained by using a worker unit to harvest the resource directly from mineral nodes scattered around the battlefield. Players require vespene gas to construct advanced units and buildings, and acquire it by constructing a gas extraction building on top of a geyser and using worker units to extract the gas from it.[17] In addition, players need to regulate the supplies for their forces to ensure that they can construct the number of units they need. Although the nature of the supply differs between the races—Terrans use physical supplies held in depots,[18] Protoss use psionic energy channeled from their homeworld via pylons,[19] and Zerg are regulated by the number of controlling overlord units present[20]—the supply mechanic essentially works in exactly the same way for each race (just with differing impacts on gameplay), allowing players to create new units when there are sufficient resources to sustain them.

Base construction

Protoss and Zerg building construction is limited to specific locations: Protoss buildings need to be linked to a power grid[21] while almost every Zerg structure must be placed on a carpet of biomass, called "creep", that is produced by certain structures.[22] Terran buildings are far less limited, with certain primary base structures possessing the ability to take off and fly slowly to a new location.[23] Terran buildings, however, require the worker unit to continue construction on the building until it is completed. Also, once a Terran building has taken a certain amount of damage, it will catch fire and can eventually burn to the ground without further enemy action if repairs are not performed by a worker unit. The Protoss, by contrast, only require a worker unit to begin the process of transporting a building to the theater of operations via warp, and their buildings' shields (but not their structure) are regenerative. The Zerg worker unit physically transforms into the structure created, which is capable of slowly healing itself.

Multiplayer

Multiplayer on _StarCraft_ is powered through Blizzard Entertainment's Battle.net Internet service. Through this, a maximum of eight players can compete in a variety of game modes, including simply destroying all other players (which may be competitive, as in Ladder play, or non-ranked, as in melee play), to king of the hill and capture the flag objective-based games. In addition, the game incorporates a variety of specialized scenarios for different types of game, such as simulating a football game, using the Terran hoverbike unit to conduct a bike race, or hosting a Zerg hunting competition.[24] _StarCraft_ is also one of the few games that include a spawn installation, which allows for limited multiplayer. It must be installed from a disc, and requires a product key to work just as the full version does. However, one product key can support up to eight spawned installations with access to Battle.net. Limitations of a spawned installation include the inability to play single-player missions, create multiplayer games or use the campaign editor.[25] Newer releases of the game available through Battle.net or discs that include the Windows Vista label don't support the spawn installation.[26]


Synopsis

Setting

_StarCraft_ takes place in a science fiction universe created by Chris Metzen and James Phinney for Blizzard Entertainment. According to the story presented in the game's manual, the overpopulation of Earth in the early 24th century has caused the international governing body, known as United Powers League (which was later succeeded by United Earth Directorate), to exile certain members of the human race, such as criminals, the cybernetically enhanced and genetic mutants to colonize the far reaches of the galaxy.[27] An attempt to colonize a nearby solar system goes wrong, resulting in humanity's arrival in the Koprulu Sector. In the distant Koprulu Sector of the galaxy, the exiles form several governments, but quickly fall into conflict with each other. One government, the Confederacy of Man, eventually emerges as the strongest faction, but its oppressive nature and brutal methods of suppressing dissidents stir up major rebel opposition in the form of a terrorist group called the Sons of Korhal. Just prior to the beginning of the game, in December 2499, an alien race possessing advanced technology and psionic power, the Protoss, makes first contact with humanity by destroying a Confederate colony world without any prior warning. Soon after this, the Terrans discover that a second alien race, the insectoid Zerg, has been stealthily infesting the surface of several of the Terran colonies, and that the Protoss are destroying the planets to prevent the Zerg from spreading. With the Confederacy threatened by two alien races and internal rebellion, it begins to crumble.[28]

Characters

The player assumes the role of three nameless characters over the course of the game. In the first act, the player acts as the Confederate magistrate of an outlying colony world of Mar Sara, threatened by both the Zerg and the Protoss, and is forced through events to join the rebel Sons of Korhal under its leader Arcturus Mengsk. Mengsk's campaign is accompanied by Jim Raynor, a morally conscious law enforcement officer from Mar Sara, and Sarah Kerrigan, a psychic assassin and Mengsk's second-in-command. The second episode of the game sees the player as a cerebrate, a commander within the Zerg Swarm. The player is ruled over by the Zerg Overmind — the manifestation of the collective consciousness of the Swarm and the game's primary antagonist — and is given advice from other cerebrates of higher rank and status while accomplishing the objectives of the Swarm. In the final part of _StarCraft_, the player is a newly appointed Executor within the Protoss military reporting to Aldaris, a representative of the Protoss government. Aldaris is at odds with Tassadar — the former occupant of the player's position — over his association with Zeratul, a member of a heretical group known as dark templar.[29]

Story

often takes place in menued screens, with only the characters' faces shown, and their captioned voices heard.]] The story of _StarCraft_ is presented through its instruction manual, the briefings to each mission and conversations within the missions themselves, along with the use of cinematic cutscenes at key points. The game itself is split into three episodes, one for the player to command each race. In the first segment of the game, the player and Jim Raynor are attempting to control the colony of Mar Sara in the wake of the Zerg attacks on other Terran worlds. After the Confederacy arrests Raynor for destroying Confederate property, despite the fact that it had been infested by the Zerg, the player joins Arcturus Mengsk and the Sons of Korhal.[30] Raynor, who is freed by Mengsk's troops, also joins and frequently accompanies the player on missions. Mengsk then begins to use Confederate technology captured on Mar Sara to lure the Zerg to Confederate installations and further his own goals.[31] After forcing Confederate general Edmund Duke to join him, Mengsk sacrifices his own second-in-command, Sarah Kerrigan, to ensure the destruction of the Confederacy by luring the Zerg to the Confederate capital Tarsonis.[32] Raynor is outraged by Mengsk's true aims of obtaining power at any cost and deserts, taking with him a small army of the former colonial militia of Mar Sara. Mengsk reorganizes what remains of the Terran population into the Terran Dominion, crowning himself as emperor.[33]

The second campaign reveals that Kerrigan was not killed by the Zerg, but rather is captured and infested in an effort to incorporate her psionic traits into the Zerg gene pool. She emerges with far more psionic powers and physical strength, her DNA completely altered.[34] Meanwhile, the Protoss commander Tassadar discovers that the Zerg's cerebrates cannot be killed by conventional means, but that they can be harmed by the powers wielded by the heretical dark templar. Tassadar allies himself with the dark templar prelate Zeratul, who assassinates Zasz, one of the Zerg's cerebrates in their hive clusters on Char.[35] The cerebrate's death results in its forces running amok through the Zerg hives, but briefly links the minds of Zeratul and the Zerg Overmind, allowing the Overmind to finally learn the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur, which the Overmind has been seeking for millennia. The main Zerg swarm promptly invades Aiur while Kerrigan is dispatched to deal with Tassadar and despite heavy Protoss resistance, the Overmind is able to embed itself into the crust of the planet.[36]

The final episode of the game sees Aldaris and the Protoss government branding Tassadar a traitor and a heretic for conspiring with the dark templar. The player (later hinted to be Artanis) initially serves Aldaris in defending Aiur from the Zerg invasion, but while on a mission to arrest Tassadar, the player joins him instead.[37] A Protoss civil war erupts, pitting Tassadar, Zeratul, and their allies against the Protoss establishment. The dark templar prove their worth when they use their energies to slay two more of the Zerg cerebrates on Aiur, and the Conclave reconciles with them.[38] Aided by Raynor's forces—who sided with Tassadar back on Char—the Protoss break through the Overmind's weakened defenses and destroy the Overmind's outer shell, but take heavy casualties in the process. Tassadar channels his own psionic energies in combination with those of the dark templar through the hull of his command ship and crashes it into the Overmind, sacrificing himself in order to destroy it.[39]


Development

Blizzard Entertainment began development on _StarCraft_ in 1995, shortly after the release of highly successful _Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness_.[40] Using the _Tides of Darkness_ game engine as a base, _StarCraft_ made its debut at E3 1996.[41] The version of the game displayed, assembled by the team's lead programmer Bob Fitch, received a rather weak response from the convention and was criticized by many for being "_Warcraft_ in space."[42] As a consequence the entire project was overhauled, bringing the focus onto creating three distinct species. Bill Roper, one of the game's producers, stated this would be a major departure from the _Warcraft_ approach, comparing its two equal sides to those of chess and stating that _StarCraft_ would allow players to "develop very unique strategies based on which species is being played, and will require players to think of different strategies to combat the other two species."[43] The hand-drawn graphics seen in the E3 version were also replaced with rendered graphics.[44] In early 1997, the new version of _StarCraft_ was unveiled, receiving a far more positive response.

of _StarCraft_]] However, the game was still marred by technical difficulties, so Bob Fitch completely redesigned the _Warcraft II_ engine within two months to ensure that many of the features desired by the designers, such as the abilities for units to burrow and cloak, could be implemented.[45] Later improvements to the game included pre-rendered sprites and backgrounds, constructed using 3D Studio Max. An isometric in-game view was also adopted, in contrast to _Warcraft II_{{'}}s 3/4s birdseye perspective. In addition, the game utilized high quality music, composed by Blizzard's resident composers, and professional voice actors were hired.[46]

Despite the progress, _StarCraft_ was slow to emerge. The continual delays inspired a group of _StarCraft_ fans on the official forums who labeled themselves "Operation: Can't Wait Any Longer" to write a series of fictional stories in which the members of Operation CWAL attempted to retrieve the beta version of _StarCraft_ from Blizzard's headquarters in Irvine, California.[47] To pay homage to their presence on the forums and enthusiasm for the game, Blizzard Entertainment later incorporated the group's name into _StarCraft_ as a cheat code to speed up the production of units[48] and gave the group thanks in the game's credits.[49] The game was released for Windows on March 31, 1998,[50] with the Classic Mac OS version following a year later in 1999.[51] Development on a Nintendo 64 version, _StarCraft 64_, began in 1999, converted from PC by Mass Media Interactive Entertainment—a subsidiary of THQ[52]—and published by Nintendo.[53] _StarCraft 64_ was released on June 13, 2000 in the USA and Europe.[54] It was also released in Australia on May 25, 2001.

Music

The musical score to _StarCraft_ was composed by Blizzard Entertainment's composers. Glenn Stafford composed the Terran and Protoss in-game themes, while Derek Duke, who was a contracted composer at the time, wrote all the in-game music for the Zerg. The cinematic scores were composed by Stafford and Hayes. Hayes also collaborated with Stafford on one of the Protoss in-game tracks. Tracy W. Bush provided additional support in composing.[55] The musical score of the game was received well by reviewers, who have described it as "appropriately melodic and dark"[56] and "impressive",[57] with one reviewer noting that some of the music owed much of its inspiration to Jerry Goldsmith's score for the film _Alien_.[58] The first official game soundtrack, _StarCraft: Game Music Vol. 1_, was released in 2000, comprising tracks from both _StarCraft_ and _Brood War_, as well as a sizable portion of remix tracks and music inspired by _StarCraft_, created by several South Korean disc jockeys. The soundtrack was distributed by Net Vision Entertainment.[59] In September 2008, Blizzard Entertainment announced that a second soundtrack, _StarCraft Original Soundtrack_, had been released on iTunes. This soundtrack consisted entirely of the original music from _StarCraft_ and _Brood War_, both from in-game themes to music used in the cinematic cut scenes.[60]


Expansions and versions

Computer expansions

Before the release of _StarCraft_, Blizzard Entertainment released a free-to-download game demo entitled _Loomings_, comprising three missions and a tutorial.[61] The prequel was made available for the full game in October 1999 as a custom map campaign, adding two extra missions and hosting it on Battle.net.[62] In addition, the full release of _StarCraft_ included a secondary campaign entitled _Enslavers_. Consisting of five missions played as both the Terrans and the Protoss, _Enslavers_ is set in the second campaign in _StarCraft_ and follows the story of a Terran smuggler who manages to take control of a Zerg cerebrate and is pursued by both the Protoss and Terran Dominion. _Enslavers_ acts as an exemplar single-player campaign for the game's level editor, highlighting how to use the features of the program.[63]

'' had a lower resolution and a redesigned interface for the Nintendo 64's gamepad.]] _StarCraft_{{'}}s first expansion, INSURRECTION, was released for Windows on July 31, 1998.[64] The expansion was developed by Aztech New Media and authorized by Blizzard Entertainment.[65] Its story focused on a separate Confederate colony alluded to in the manual to _StarCraft_, following a group of Terran colonists and a Protoss fleet in their fight against the Zerg and a rising local insurgency. _Insurrection_ was not received well, being criticized by reviewers for lacking the quality of the original game.[66] _Insurrection_ was followed within a few months by a second expansion, RETRIBUTION. Developed by Stardock, published by WizardWorks and authorized by Blizzard Entertainment,[67] _Retribution_ follows all three races attempting to seize control of a powerful crystal on a Terran Dominion colony. The expansion was not received with critical support, instead being regarded as average but at least challenging.[68] After the release of _Retribution_, Blizzard Entertainment announced a new official expansion pack that would continue on the story of _StarCraft_. _StarCraft: Brood War_ was consequently created, developed jointly by Blizzard Entertainment and Saffire Corporation. _Brood War_ continues the story of _StarCraft_ from days after its conclusion, and was released for both Windows and Mac to critical praise[69][70] on November 30, 1998 in the US and in March 1999 in Europe.[71]

Before Insurrection, an unauthorized expansion pack, called Stellar Forces, was published by Micro Star but was recalled weeks later when Blizzard won the court case against it. It consisted of 22 single player maps and 32 multi-player maps which are considered to be rather plain.[72][73]

Nintendo 64 version

In 2000, _StarCraft 64_ was released In North America for the Nintendo 64, co-developed by Blizzard Entertainment and Mass Media Inc. and published by Nintendo. The game featured all of the missions from both _StarCraft_ and the expansion _Brood War_, as well as some exclusive missions, such as two different tutorials and a new secret mission, _Resurrection IV_.[74] Blizzard Entertainment had previously considered a PlayStation port of the game, but it was decided that the game would instead be released on the Nintendo 64.[75] _Resurrection IV_ is set after the conclusion of _Brood War_, and follows Jim Raynor embarking on a mission to rescue the _Brood War_ character Alexei Stukov, a vice admiral from Earth who has been captured by the Zerg. The _Brood War_ missions required the use of a Nintendo 64 memory Expansion Pak to run.[76] In addition, _StarCraft 64_ features a split screen cooperative mode, also requiring the expansion pak, allowing two players to control one force in-game.[77] _StarCraft 64_ lacked the online multiplayer capabilities and speech in mission briefings. In addition, cut scenes were shortened.[78]


Cultural impact

Reception

_StarCraft_ was released internationally on March 31, 1998 and became the best-selling PC game for that year, selling over 1.5 million copies worldwide.[79] In the United States, it was best-selling computer game of 1998, with 746,365 units sold.[80] It was the country's 14th best-selling release of the period between 1993 and 1999, selling 916,000 copies.[81] By April 1999, South Korean players had purchased almost 300,000 units of the game.[82] _StarCraft_{{'}}s worldwide sales reached 4 million units by July 2001; South Korea accounted for 50% of these copies.[83] By May 2007, _StarCraft_ had sold over 9.5 million copies across the globe, with 4.5 million of these being sold in South Korea.[84] Since the initial release of _StarCraft_, Blizzard Entertainment reported that its Battle.net online multiplayer service grew by 800 percent.[85]

Generally, _StarCraft_ was received positively by critics, with many contemporary reviewers noting that while the game may not have deviated significantly from the status quo of most real-time strategy games, it was one of the best to have applied the formula.[86][87] In addition, _StarCraft_{{'}}s pioneering use of three distinct, unique and balanced races over two equal sides was praised by critics,[88] with GameSpot commenting that this helped the game to "avoid the problem that has plagued every other game in the genre".[89] Many critics also praised the strength of the story accompanying the game, with some reviewers being impressed by how well the story was folded into the gameplay.[90] The game's voice acting in particular was praised; GameSpot later hailed the voice work in the game as one of the ten best in the industry at the time.[91] Equally, the multiplayer aspects of the game were positively received. _StarCraft_ has received multiple awards, including being named as one of the best games of all time by GameSpot, IGN, and _Game Informer_.[92][93][94][95] According to Blizzard Entertainment _StarCraft_ has won 37 awards, and has received a star on the floor of the Metreon as part of the Walk of Game in San Francisco in early 2006.[96]

_Next Generation_ reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that "The quality of the play balancing and the elegance of the design mean that _StarCraft_ sets a new high watermark for all realtime strategy games."[97]

Although at the time _StarCraft_{{'}}s graphics and audio were praised by critics,[98] later reviews have noted that the graphics do not compare to more modern games.[99] The capacity for the game's artificial intelligence to navigate units to waypoints also faced some heavy criticism, with _PC Zone_ stating that the inability for developers to make an effective pathfinding system was "the single most infuriating element of the real-time strategy genre".[100] In addition, several reviewers expressed concern over some familiarities between the unit structures of each race, as well as over the potential imbalance of players using rushing tactics early in multiplayer games.[101] Blizzard Entertainment has strived to balance rush tactics in later updates. The Nintendo 64 version of the game was not received as positively by reviewers, and was criticized for poor graphics in comparison to the PC version. However, critics did praise the game and Mass Media for using effective controls on the gamepad and maintaining the high quality audio.[102][103][104]

_Starcraft_ won the Origins Awards for Best Strategy Computer Game of 1998.[105]

In 1998, _PC Gamer_ declared it the 5th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it "a strategy game that continues to evolve and surprise many months after its release, and that currently represents the state of the genre's art".[106]

Legacy

GameSpot described _StarCraft_ as "The defining game of its genre. It is the standard by which all real-time strategy games are judged."[107] IGN stated that _StarCraft_ "is hands down one of the best, if not the best, real-time strategy games ever created."[108] _StarCraft_ is frequently included in the industry's best games rankings, for example it ranked 37 in _Edge_{{'}}s top 100 games of all time.[109] _StarCraft_ has even been taken into space, as Daniel Barry took a copy of the game with him on the Space Shuttle mission STS-96 in 1999.[110] _StarCraft_{{'}}s popularity resulted in _Guinness World Records_ awarding the game four world records, including "Best Selling PC Strategy Game," "Largest Income in Professional Gaming," and "Largest Audience for a Game Competition" when 120,000 fans turned out to watch the final of the SKY proleague season 2005 in Busan, South Korea.[111] Researchers have shown that the audience for watching _StarCraft_ games is diverse and that _StarCraft_ uses instances of information asymmetry to make the game more entertaining for spectators.[112] In addition, _StarCraft_ has been the subject of an academic course; the University of California, Berkeley offered a student-run introductory course on theory and strategy in spring 2009.[113][114]

After its release, _StarCraft_ rapidly grew in popularity in South Korea, eventually making its way to become the country's national e-sport after establishing a successful pro-gaming scene.[115] Professional gamers in South Korea are media celebrities, and _StarCraft_ games are broadcast over three television channels dedicated to the professional gaming scene.[116] Professional gamers in South Korea have gained television contracts, sponsorships, and tournament prizes, allowing one of the most famous players, Lim "BoxeR" Yo-hwan,[117] to gain a fan club of over half a million people.[118] One player, Lee Yun-yeol, reported earnings in 2005 of .[119]

_StarCraft_ was part of the United States Air Force's Air and Space Basic Course, used to teach newly active officers about crisis planning under stress and joint service teamwork.[120] Other efforts to make more 'realistic' current-day battle software led to distractions when simulated hardware didn't align with the real hardware active duty officers knew about. The science fiction setting allowed students to focus on the battle tactics.

The annual Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment hosts a competition for AIs playing the game. As of 2015, humans still win.[121]

In 2014, an unofficial version for the Pandora handheld and the ARM architecture became available by static recompilation and reverse engineering of the original x86 version.[122][123]

Merchandise

The storyline of _StarCraft_ has been adapted into several novels. The first novel, _Uprising_, which was written by Blizzard employee Micky Neilson and published in December 2000, acts as a prequel to the events of _StarCraft_.[124] Other novels—_Liberty's Crusade_ by Jeff Grubb[125] and Aaron Rosenberg's _Queen of Blades_[126]—retell the story of the game from different perspectives. At BlizzCon 2007, _StarCraft_ creator Chris Metzen stated that he hoped to novelize the entirety of _StarCraft_ and its expansion _Brood War_ into a definitive text-based story. Later novels, such as Gabriel Mesta's _Shadow of the Xel'Naga_[127] and Christie Golden's _The Dark Templar Saga_,[128] further expand the storyline, creating the setting for _StarCraft II_.

A number of action figures and collectable statues based upon the characters and units in _StarCraft_ have been produced by ToyCom.[129] A number of model kits, made by Academy Hobby Model Kits, were also produced, displaying 1/30 scale versions of the marine[130] and the hydralisk.[131] In addition, Blizzard Entertainment teamed up with Fantasy Flight Games to create a board game with detailed sculptures of game characters.[132] Blizzard Entertainment also licensed Wizards of the Coast to produce an Alternity based game entitled _StarCraft Adventures_.


Remaster

A remastered edition of the game, _StarCraft: Remastered_, released August 14, 2017, preserves the gameplay of the original while adding support for ultra-high-definition graphics, Blizzard's modern online features, and re-recorded audio (soundtrack and sound effects).[133][134]
