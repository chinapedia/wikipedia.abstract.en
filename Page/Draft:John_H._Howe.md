JOHN HOMER HOWE (September 12, 1822â€“April 3, 1873) was an American jurist who served as Chief Justice of the Territorial Wyoming Supreme Court from April 6, 1869 to October 14, 1871.

Born in Riga, New York.[1]

When the Territory of Wyoming extended the right to vote to women in 1870, Howe, as chief justice, interpreted this to mean that women could also serve on juries, and encouraged them to do so.[2][3] Howe's efforts resulted in the first "mixed" juries, containing both men and women, which Howe argued would have a "civilizing" effect on proceedings, and give women greater power to address legal wrongs against them.[4] Howe's efforts were resisted by male lawyers, and ultimately his successor in office reversed this policy.[5]

Howe died in Laredo, Texas and was interred in Kewanee, Illinois.[6]
