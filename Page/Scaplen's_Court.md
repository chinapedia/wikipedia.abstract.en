SCAPLEN'S COURT is a fifteenth century Grade I listed house in Poole, Dorset, England, adjacent to the Poole Museum. The house is now used as a museum focusing on life in Poole between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries, and includes a Victorian schoolroom and kitchen.[1][2]


History

Scaplen's Court was originally built in the late fifteenth century as a house for a rich merchant, and the style of the house was indicative of the prosperity of Poole at the time.[3][4] The house was originally L-shaped, and was built of Purbeck and Bath stone, and cobbles from Poole Quay.[5] The history of the house is uncertain, but a doorway in the courtyard display the Poole shield of arms.[6] It is believed that a maid named Agnes Beard was murdered at the house in 1598, and there are suggestions that her ghost haunts the house.[7] It has also been suggested by local historians that the building may have been Poole's _Old Town House_, the first guildhall in the town, and that in the seventeenth century it was known as the _George's Inn_, and was occupied by the Roundheads during the English Civil War.[8][9] During the eighteenth century, the house was acquired by John Scaplen, after whom the building is now named.[10] In 1927, the Society of Poole Men bought the house for £16,000 and spent £430 on renovating the property.[11][12] During the renovation, a shilling from the time of Mary I was found at the house.[13] The building was opened to the public for the first time in 1929.[14] In 1931, the house obtained a map believed to be the oldest map of Poole, which dated from 1643.[15] The museum became a Grade I listed building in 1954,[16] and was restored in 1986.[17] In 2006/7, the museum was used to dry an Iron Age boat that had been recovered from Poole Harbour in 1964; the boat is now on display at the nearby Poole Museum.[18]
