ILYA PETROVICH KOPALIN (1900-1976) was a Russian film director remembered for his documentaries. His most famous footage is that of Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt at the Yalta Conference and that of Yuri Gargarin's space flight.


Life

He was born the son of a peasant[1] on 2 August 1900 in the village of Pavlovskaya, Zvenigorod on the outskirts of Moscow.[2] In his youth he worked in a factory in Moscow. After October 1917 he trained first as a land surveyor then as a pilot. A chance meeting with Dziga Vertov led him instantly into an interest in the cinema. Aged 24 he went to work for Vertov as a camera-man, working on films such as Kinoglaz,[3] but later would work independently. His early films look at country life and agriculture in the newly created USSR.[4]

His work gained him six Stalin Prizes and the Order of Lenin. He died in Moscow on 12 June 1976.
