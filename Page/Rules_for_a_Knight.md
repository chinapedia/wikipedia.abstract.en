13. Generosity – Thomas and Richard encounter people in great poverty, and marvel at the generosity of a starving young boy who shares Hawke's offering of bread with his siblings. Thomas's grandfather is offered a promotion to Bishop, but rejects it in favor of staying with his land and its people.

14. Discipline – A wealthy relative of Thomas's begins to offer gifts to the knights of the area. Thomas's grandfather forces him to return each gift. It is later discovered that their wealthy relative had been planning to raise an army. Each knight who had accepted his gifts felt a sense of loyalty to him, and fought in battle for him. Thomas and his grandfather do not fight, but Sir Richard is killed in battle.

15. Dedication – Thomas recounts the famous battle of Caal, in which the people of Caal escaped thanks to the ingenuity of their knights.

16. Speech – Thomas's grandfather teaches him the value of limited speech.

17. Faith – Thomas remembers a woman who went mad with grief after the loss of her son. Thomas's grandfather designed a task for her so that she might learnt he sorrow of others, allowing her to regain her mind.

18. Equality – Thomas remembers the first time he heard "The Ballad of the Forty-Four-Pointed Red Deer."

19. Love – Thomas recalls falling in love with the Duchess of York, who used him to gain favor with a prince. Distraught, Thomas becomes distracted, and accidentally causes a fire in his house. After his grandfather is injured, he sends for a healer. The healer has died, but her daughter aides Thomas. Thomas falls very slowly in love with healer's daughter, and eventually marries her. He then wishes his children the kind of relationship he has had with their mother.

20. Death – Thomas recounts his grandfather's last days and then ends his letter to his children.

The Ballad of the Forty-Four-Pointed Red Deer – The song mentioned in section 18 is printed in full. Although it is described in section 18 as being very ancient, it was in fact written by Hawke for the book. It tells the story of a buck who negotiates the freedom of all animals from the tyranny of a human king, sacrificing himself in the process.


Development

The original idea for the book came to Hawke about a decade before its publication. It began as rules for his own children and house, and over the years grew into _Rules for a Knight._ When speaking on the subject in a _New Yorker_ interview, Hawke said, "So we started saying, well, what are the rules of our house? And you start with the really mundane, like eight-o’clock bedtime, all that kind of stuff. And then, invariably, you start asking yourself, well, what do we really believe in?" In the same interview, Hawke discussed the motif of knights and chivalry, saying, ""I’ve just always loved the idea of knighthood. It makes being a good person cool. Or, aspiring to be a good person cool."[1]

Real life inspiration

Hawke has stated that he took some elements of the book's fables from his own life, specifically the fable for Cooperation, which was based on his experiences with River Phoenix.[2]

Inspiration from other fables

The very first fable in _Rules for a Knight_, on the subject of solitude, is a retelling of the Native American fable of _The Two Wolves_.[3]

Several of the fables related in the book bear great resemblance to other classic fables. The fable of forgiveness that Hawke relates in Forgiveness contains a similar situation and nearly identical closing phrase as the Buddhist/Taoist fable of The Two Monks and the Woman.[4]

The tale related in Faith is also very similar to the Buddhist story of Kisa Gotami.[5]


Adaptations

An audiobook of _Rules for a Knight_ has been recorded. It is narrated by actor Alessandro Nivola and runs 2 hrs 15 min. It was published by Brilliance Audio in 2015.[6]


Reception

The book has received mixed to positive reviews. Michael Lindgren of _The Washington Post_ said of Hawke's work, "those who are able to separate the book's wisdom from its author might find a certain charm in its formulations." Lindgren concluded that "It is hard to summon up much irritation with Hawke in his latest literary effort."[7] _Kirkus Reviews_ gave an unfavorable review of _Rules for a Knight_, calling the book "Just the thing for those who want their New Age nostrums wrapped in medieval kit." The review also took issue with the historical accuracy of the book in its descriptions of knights and life in 15th century Cornwall.[8] Carrie R. Wheadon of the website Common Sense Media gave a more favorable review, calling the book "a small philosophical gem," that "... invites family discussion on which values are most important and why."[9]

_Rules for a Knight_ appeared on the New York Times Bestseller list at #12 during the week of December 6, 2015. It remained for two weeks.[10] The book holds a rating of four out of five stars on Goodreads.com.[11]
