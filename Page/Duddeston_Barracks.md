DUDDESTON BARRACKS was a military installation in Great Brook Street, Duddeston, Birmingham, England.


History

The barracks were commissioned as part of the response to the Priestley Riots; they were designed by John Rawsthorne and completed in 1793.[1] Although intended for cavalry regiments, they were used by the Royal Horse Artillery from 1878[2] and became the home of 1st South Midland Field Ambulance during the First World War.[3] The barracks were demolished in 1932 and the site is now occupied by the maisonettes of the Ashcroft Estate.[4]
