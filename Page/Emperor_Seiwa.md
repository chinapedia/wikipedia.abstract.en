was the 56th emperor of Japan,[1] according to the traditional order of succession.[2]

Seiwa's reign spanned the years from 858 through 876.[3]


Traditional narrative

Seiwa was the fourth son of Emperor Montoku. His mother was Empress Dowager Fujiwara no Akirakeiko (明子), also called the Somedono empress 染殿后). Seiwa's mother was the daughter of Fujiwara no Yoshifusa (藤原良房), who was regent and great minister of the council of state.[4] He was the younger half-brother of Imperial Prince Koretaka (惟喬親王; 844–897)

Imina

Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his _imina_)[5] was ,[6] the first member of the Imperial house to be personally named "-hito" 仁. One meaning of the character 仁 is the Confucian concept of ren. Later it has been a tradition to name the personal name of all male members of the Imperial family this way.

He was also known as emperor as _Mizunoo-no-mikado_[7] or _Minoo-tei_.[8]

Events of Seiwa's life

Originally under the guardianship of his maternal grandfather Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, he displaced Imperial Prince Koretaka (惟喬親王) as Crown Prince. Upon the death of his father in 858, Emperor Montoku, he became Emperor at the age of 9, but the real power was held by his grandfather, Yoshifusa.

-   7 OCTOBER 858 (_Ten'an 2, 27th day of the 8th month_) : In the 8th year of Montoku_-tennō_ 's reign (文徳天皇8年), the emperor abdicated;[9] and the succession (_senso_) was received by his son. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Seiwa is said to have acceded to the throne (_sokui_).[10]
-   15 DECEMBER 858 (_Ten'an 2, 7th day of the 11th month_) : The emperor's official announcement of his enthronement at age 9 was accompanied by the appointment of his grandfather as regent (_sesshō_). This is the first time that this high honor has been accorded to a member of the Fujiwara family, and it is also the first example in Japan of the accession of an heir who is too young to be emperor. The proclamation of the beginning of Seiwa's reign was made at the Kotaijingu at Ise Province and at all the tombs of the imperial family.[11]
-   859 (_Jōgan 1, 1st month_): All New Year's festivities were suspended because of the period of national mourning for the death of Emperor Montoku.[12]
-   859 (_Jōgan 1_): Construction began on the Iwashimizu Shrine near Heian-kyō. This shrine honors Hachiman, the Shinto war god.[13]
-   869 (_Jōgan 10_): Yōzei was born, and he was named Seiwa's heir in the following year.[14]
-   876 (_Jōgan 17, 11th month_): In the 18th year of Seiwa_-tennō_ 's reign (清和天皇18年), the emperor ceded his throne to his five-year-old son, which meant that the young child received the succession (_senso_). Shortly thereafter, Emperor Yōzei formally acceded to the throne (_sokui_).[15]
-   878 (_Gangyō 2_): Seiwa became a Buddhist priest. His new priestly name was Soshin.[16]
-   7 JANUARY 881 (_Gangyō 4, 4th day of the 12th month_) : Former-Emperor Seiwa died at age 28.[17]


Mausoleum

The actual site of Seiwa's grave is known.[18] The emperor is traditionally venerated at the _misasagi_ memorial shrine in the Ukyō-ku ward of Kyoto. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Seiwa's mausoleum. It is formally named the or Seiwa Tennō Ryō.[19][20] From the site of his tomb the Emperor Seiwa is sometimes referred to as the .[21] The _kami_ of Emperor Seiwa is venerated at the Seiwatennō-sha in close proximity to the mausoleum.[22][23]

-   _Daijō-daijin_, Fujiwara no Yoshifusa.[26]
