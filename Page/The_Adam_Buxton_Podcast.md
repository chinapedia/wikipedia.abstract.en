THE ADAM BUXTON PODCAST is a podcast created by and starring English comedian, writer and actor Adam Buxton. The first episode was released on 15 September 2015 and debuted at number one in the British iTunes Podcast Chart.[1]

The podcasts are usually just over an hour in duration and have been released on an irregular basis.[2] Episodes usually begin with an introduction from Buxton as he walks through the Norfolk countryside with his pet dog, a black whippet cross poodle called Rosie,[3] before segueing into a previously recorded conversation with the week's guest. The conversation's tone is dependent on the guest but the theme is usually humorous and anecdotal. The podcast is interspersed with self-composed jingles and finishes with a return to Buxton's walk with Rosie before a sign off. Buxton's occasional refrain "my wife" is heard first in episode 12 at 1 hour 6'45".
