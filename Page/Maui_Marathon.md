The MAUI OCEANFRONT MARATHON is a marathon located in Maui, Hawaii. It is traditionally held in September.

Established in 1971, the event is notable as one of the oldest marathon races in the United States. It is the second most prestigious marathon event in the state of Hawaii behind only the Honolulu Marathon.

It is the longest recurring running event in the state of Hawaii.

The award-winning course was recognized by Runner's World as one of the Top 10 Most Scenic Marathons in the United States. In the Ultimate Guide to Marathons, the Maui Marathon was recognized as the #10 destination marathon in North America. [1]

In addition to the Marathon, competitors have the option of running in the half-marathon, 10k, 5k, or mile run events.
