In metric geometry, ASYMPTOTIC DIMENSION of a metric space is a large-scale analog of Lebesgue covering dimension. The notion of asymptotic dimension was introduced my Mikhail Gromov in his 1993 monograph _Asymptotic invariants of infinite groups_[1] in the context of geometric group theory, as a quasi-isometry invariant of finitely generated groups. As shown by Guoliang Yu, finitely generated groups of finite homotopy type with finite asymptotic dimension satisfy the Novikov conjecture.[2] Asymptotic dimension has important applications in geometric analysis and index theory.


Formal definition

Let X be a metric space and n‚ÄÑ‚â•‚ÄÑ0 be an integer. We say that asdim(X)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑn if for every R‚ÄÑ‚â•‚ÄÑ1 there exists a uniformly bounded cover ùí∞ of X such that every closed R-ball in X intersects at most n‚ÄÖ+‚ÄÖ1 subsets from ùí∞. Here 'uniformly bounded' means that sup_(U‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑùí∞)diam(U)‚ÄÑ<‚ÄÑ‚àû.

We then define the _asymptotic dimension_ asdim(X) as the smallest integer n‚ÄÑ‚â•‚ÄÑ0 such that asdim(X)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑn, if at least one such n exists, and define asdim(X)‚ÄÑ:=‚ÄÑ‚àû otherwise.

Also, one says that a family (X_(i))_(i‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑI) of metric spaces satisfies asdim(X)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑn _uniformly_ if for every R‚ÄÑ‚â•‚ÄÑ1 and every i‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑI there exists a cover ùí∞_(i) of X_(i) by sets of diameter at most D(R)‚ÄÑ<‚ÄÑ‚àû (independent of i) such that every closed R-ball in X_(i) intersects at most n‚ÄÖ+‚ÄÖ1 subsets from ùí∞_(i).


Examples

-   If X is a metric space of bounded diameter then asdim(X)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ0.
-   asdim(‚Ñù)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑasdim(‚Ñ§)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1.
-   asdim(‚Ñù^(n))‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑn.
-   asdim(‚Ñç^(n))‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑn.


Properties

-   If Y‚ÄÑ‚äÜ‚ÄÑX is a subspace of a metric space X, then asdim(Y)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑasdim(X).
-   For any metric spaces X and Y one has asdim(X‚ÄÖ√ó‚ÄÖY)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑasdim(X)‚ÄÖ+‚ÄÖasdim(Y).
-   If A,‚ÄÜB‚ÄÑ‚äÜ‚ÄÑX then asdim(A‚ÄÖ‚à™‚ÄÖB)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑmax‚ÄÜ{asdim(A),‚ÄÜasdim(B)}.
-   If f‚ÄÑ:‚ÄÑY‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑX is a coarse embedding (e.g. a quasi-isometric embedding), then asdim(Y)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑasdim(X).
-   If X and Y are coarsely equivalent metric spaces (e.g. quasi-isometric metric spaces), then asdim(X)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑasdim(Y).
-   If X is a real tree then asdim(X)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑ1.
-   Let f‚ÄÑ:‚ÄÑX‚ÄÑ‚Üí‚ÄÑY be a Lipschitz map from a geodesic metric space X to a metric space Y . Suppose that for every r‚ÄÑ>‚ÄÑ0 the set family {f^(‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖ1)(B_(r)(y))}_(y‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑY) satisfies the inequality asdim‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑn uniformly. Then asdim(X)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑasdim(Y)‚ÄÖ+‚ÄÖn. See[3]
-   If X is a metric space with asdim(X)‚ÄÑ<‚ÄÑ‚àû then X admits a coarse (uniform) embedding into a Hilbert space.[4]
-   If X is a metric space of bounded geometry with asdim(X)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑn then X admits a coarse embedding into a product of n‚ÄÖ+‚ÄÖ1 locally finite simplicial trees.Alexander Dranishnikov, _On hypersphericity of manifolds with finite asymptotic dimension._

Asymptotic dimension in geometric group theory

Asymptotic dimension achieved particular prominence in geometric group theory after a 1998 paper of Guoliang Yu[5] , which proved that if G is a finitely generated group of finite homotopy type (that is with a classifying space of the homotopy type of a finite CW-complex) such that asdim(G)‚ÄÑ<‚ÄÑ‚àû, then G satisfies the Novikov conjecture. As was subsequently shown,[6] finitely generated groups with finite asymptotic dimension are _topologically amenable_, i.e. satisfy Guoliang Yu's _Property A_ introduced in[7] and equivalent to the exactness of the reduced C*-algebra of the group.

-   If G is a word-hyperbolic group then asdim(G)‚ÄÑ<‚ÄÑ‚àû.[8]
-   If G is relatively hyperbolic with respect to subgroups H‚ÇÅ,‚ÄÜ‚Ä¶,‚ÄÜH_(k) each of which has finite asymptotic dimension then asdim(G)‚ÄÑ<‚ÄÑ‚àû.[9]
-   asdim(‚Ñ§^(n))‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑn.
-   If H‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑG, where H,‚ÄÜG are finitely generated, then asdim(H)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑasdim(G).
-   For Thompson's group F we have asdim(F)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ‚àû since F contains subgroups isomorphic to ‚Ñ§^(n) for arbitrarily large n.
-   If G is the fundamental group of a finite graph of groups ùî∏ with underlying graph A and finitely generated vertex groups, then[10]

.

-   Mapping class groups of orientable finite type surfaces have finite asymptotic dimension.[11]
-   Let G be a connected Lie group and let Œì‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑG be a finitely generated discrete subgroup. Then asdim(Œì)‚ÄÑ<‚ÄÑ‚àû.[12]
-   It is not known if Out(F_(n)) has finite asymptotic dimension for n‚ÄÑ>‚ÄÑ2.[13]
