DREAMCAR (styled DREAMCAR) is an American new wave supergroup from Los Angeles, California.[1]


Background and musical style

When news first broke of Davey Havok working with No Doubt members, many believed he would be replacing Gwen Stefani as the singer of that band. In an interview, Havok clarified this wasn’t the case at all. "I'm not singing for No Doubt", he said. He did admit that the band "have a lot of great songs. We have songs that are fully complete. And, it's just a great time. It's really fun. I think people will really like it."[2] Havok also stated the band's overall style has an "'80s vibe".[3]

Speaking to _Billboard_ back in May 2016, drummer Adrian Young said of Dreamcar, "It doesn’t sound like anything, it actually doesn’t sound like AFI or No Doubt. And sometimes I'm not objective enough to really understand it. And I ask my wife or friends, I play them a snippet and I go, 'Does this sound like either one of these bands?' And they’re like, 'No.' And I think that's a good thing."[4]

Tony Kanal was "beyond stoked for people to hear" the debut record from his new project, Dreamcar, which features his No Doubt bandmates, Young and Tom Dumont, as well as AFI frontman Havok. "I can't stop listening to it, so that's always a good sign for me," he said, while noting the band has been in the "final stages" of wrapping up the album. "When I've worked on something that I can't stop listening to—and that I want to get in my car and listen to—it always makes me feel really good. You have this excitement to share it with everybody." Although he's hesitant to give specifics as to what Dreamcar sounds like, he does allow the album is "very inspired by all the '80s stuff that we love. I would definitely say it's a rock record", and says the entire music-making process was very organic and unforced. "There was never really a conversation about what type of music we were making", he says. "We were just making music, and it just worked."[5]

Four teaser trailers have been uploaded to the band's YouTube account, each video giving fans a taste of what is to come.[6]

Dreamcar's first single "Kill for Candy" premiered on March 2, 2017. Dumont revealed on Twitter that a music video for the track is in the works. Their self-titled debut album was released on May 12, 2017.[7]
