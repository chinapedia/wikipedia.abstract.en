CHARLIE CLARK is a Canadian politician who was elected Mayor of Saskatoon in the 2016 Saskatchewan municipal elections.[1]

Prior to his election to the mayoralty, Clark served on Saskatoon City Council for ten years as councillor for Ward 6, and worked for the non-profit Core Neighbourhood Development Council and Quint Development Corporation as a mediator.[2] He defeated incumbent mayor Don Atchison after a tight race during which Atchison maintained a narrow lead in public opinion polling, while both Clark and third-place finisher Kelley Moore traded the second-place position, throughout the campaign.[3] He received a late-campaign endorsement from comedian and actor Zach Galifianakis, whose wife is Clark's stepmother's niece.[4]
