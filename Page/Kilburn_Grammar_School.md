KILBURN GRAMMAR SCHOOL, in north-west London, was founded in 1897, and ceased to exist in 1967. Its history is detailed in a book by Richard E Brock.[1] It was founded by the Rev. Dr. H G Bonavia Hunt, vicar of St Paul's, Kilburn, at a time when there was no general state provision for secondary education. The new boys' school opened in one room at 1 Willesden Lane in January 1898, then occupied two rooms at the Polytechnic Institute at Priory Park Road, moving again in 1899 to a house at 28 Cavendish Road.

In April 1900, the school began moving to its new purpose-built premises at Salusbury Road. In July 1900 the Hampstead and Highgate Express[2] reported that the school's hall was opened by Bishop Mandell Creighton. Old boys of the school are still known as 'Old Creightonians'. In 1907, the school was purchased jointly by the Urban District of Willesden and the County of Middlesex to become the first state secondary school in the borough, run by the higher education committee made up of representatives of both local authorities.

In 1964, London's local government was reorganised. The County of Middlesex was abolished along with the Borough of Willesden, and a new London Borough of Brent was created, which had sole responsibility for education. An early decision by the new authority was to close the grammar school (and others) and create a new boys' school, Kilburn Senior High School. This had a comprehensive intake at 13, and started in September 1967. While the existing (14+) pupils completed their traditional grammar school education on the premises, by the early 1970s, nothing remained of the old school except the buildings and a diminishing number of teachers who had stayed on.

In 1973, KSHS merged with the girls' school on the opposite side of the road to form Brondesbury and Kilburn High School, also comprehensive. In 1989, this school in turn merged with others and moved to a different site to form Queen's Park Community School. The former Edwardian grammar school premises in Salusbury Road were sold by the borough in 1989 and are now occupied by the Islamia Girls' School (fee-paying) and Islamia Primary School (voluntary-aided).

Kilburn Grammar School's old boys' association was established in 1919, and is celebrating its centenary in 2019.[3] It currently has around 400 members, all of whom attended or taught at the school before its closure.
