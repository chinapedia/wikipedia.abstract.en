The organization Foreign Policy Interrupted (FPI) was launched in 2014 to address the disparity between female and male foreign policy expert representation in the media.[1] According to the Op-Ed Project, in 2011, women authored only 19 percent of op-eds in _The Wall Street Journal_, 22 percent in _The New York Times_, and 24 percent in the _Los Angeles Times_. In collaboration with Media Matters for America, FPI conducted an analysis of foreign policy guests on major news programs. In 2014, 22 percent of guests were women, and trained female foreign policy experts received less coverage than that.[2]

To increase the number of female voices in foreign policy journalism, FPI designed a fellowship program, which includes media training and meaningful mentoring at partnering media institutions, including _Foreign Affairs_ and _Foreign Policy_.[3] In addition, FPI publishes a weekly newsletter that highlights foreign policy articles authored by women and interviews of female foreign policy experts.

FPI is led by co-founders Elmira Bayrasli and Lauren Bohn.
