In the episode, Louise comes down with the flu and has a _Wizard of Oz_-esque fever dream involving a disfigured Kuchi Kopi and her toys, who have the voices of her family.


Plot

Louise comes down with the flu and falls into a wild fever dream filled with familiar faces, zany musical numbers and a crazy adventure.


Reception

Alasdair Wilkins of _The A.V. Club_ gave the episode an A-, saying, "“Flu-ouise” could have hit its themes and character beats harder in its fantasy sequences, but that would have likely meant drawing even closer visual parallels between the toys and Louise’s family, or using their actions as more obvious allegories for Louise’s frustrations with their failures. The episode doesn’t go down this more obvious route, instead casting the other Belchers in a more broadly drawn fantastical adventure. It’s not as tightly focused on Louise learning a specific lesson or working through her issues as it could have been, which—whatever weaknesses that might entail—does mean the episode can throw in delightful, generally Belcher-like character bits like the bear building a sun deck to relax, the octopus drinking heavily with all her pals, and the two final toys trying and adorably failing to be threatening. I’m critiquing “Flu-ouise” for not being tightly focused, yet its looseness is part of its charm. This show either can’t lose or can’t win, I guess, depending on how you want to see it. Either way, this is a damn good premiere."[1]

The episode received a 1.1 rating and was watched by a total of 2.60 million people.[2]
