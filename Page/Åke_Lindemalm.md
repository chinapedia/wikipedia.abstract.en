Career

Lindemalm was born in Lima, Sweden, the son of district medical officer Oskar Lindemalm and his wife Augusta (née Florén).[1] He passed _studentexamen_ at Högre Allmänna Läroverket in Uppsala in 1928[2] and became an acting sub-lieutenant (_fänrik_) in the Swedish Navy in 1931. He was a training officer for the Cabin Boy Corps (_Skeppsgossekåren_) on the full-rigged ship _af Chapman_ from 1936 to 1937.[3] Lindemalm became an officer cadet in 1938 and spent two and a half years ashore at the Royal Swedish Naval Academy and on a long trip to South America with the seaplane cruiser as well as aboard different cadet ships to form the cadets to prospective officers in the course of 1941.[4] During World War II he served as captain of various submarines.[5] Lindemalm was a teacher at the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College from 1948 to 1951. Lindemalm was promoted to commander of the 2nd rank in 1949 and was commanding officer of the 1st Submarine Flotilla in 1951.[6]

Lindemalm then served at the Operations Department of the Naval Staff from 1952 to 1955 and was promoted to commander of the 1st rank in 1953.[7] He was captain of the cruiser from 1955 to 1956[8] and was promoted to captain the following year. Lindemalm was flag captain from 1957 to 1959 and inspector of the submarine and helicopter service from 1959 to 1961 when he was promoted to rear admiral. He was acting Chief of the Naval Staff from 1960 to 1961 when he was promoted to vice admiral.[9] He was appointed Chief of the Navy in 1961 and for economic reasons had to proceed with the reduction of the number of ships and coastal artillery pieces, which his predecessor had begun. However, submarines which was ordered was of high technical quality, the Swedish Coastal Artillery transition to medium and light pieces was started and the helicopter's increased importance for naval warfare was continued by Lindemalm. He was promoted to admiral upon his retirement in 1970.[10]
