LYNK & CO is a Chinese-Swedish automotive brand owned by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group. Founded in 2016, its cars will be positioned between those of the Geely brand and Swedish brand Volvo, which was purchased by Geely in 2010. The focus of the brand is on internet connectivity and innovative purchasing models in certain markets, targeting the young professional demographic.[1]

The name Lynk is meant to evoke connectivity and communication. The Chinese name of the brand is Lingke (领克), a transliteration of Lynk that has given meanings, where 领 means "to lead with open mind, in style design and cutting-edge technologies" while 克 means "to amend with innovations in trilateral space between human, vehicle and environment for better traffic".[2]


Models

Lynk & Co has announced three models intended for production, all based on the Compact Modular Architecture (CMA) platform developed by Volvo. The first product announced by Lynk & Co was the crossover 01, the production version first shown at the 2017 Auto Shanghai show.[3] Production of the 01 began first in China in 2017, and is expected to start at Volvo's plant in Ghent, Belgium in 2019.[4][5] A concept of the second model, the 03 sedan, was first shown along with the production 01 in Shanghai.[6][7] The third model, also based on the platform shared with the Volvo XC40, is the 02. Smaller than the 01, it is also a crossover.[8][9] Current models are as follows:

-   Lynk & Co 01
-   Lynk & Co 02
-   Lynk & Co 03

Lynk & Co will launch the Lynk & Co 04 and 05 in 2019, according to An Conghui, President and CEO of Geely Auto Group. Besides, the Lynk & Co 02 PHEV and the 03 PHEV will also hit the market in 2019.[10] The brand has so far rolled out four models, namely, the Lynk & Co 01, 02, 03 and the Lynk & Co 01 PHEV (January 2019). As the product planning reveals, all outgoing models will have their PHEV version.


Sales model

Lynk & Co is planning to use a direct-to-consumer sales model in most markets, including the United States. This method is very uncommon, especially in the United States, where dealerships have been used as the primary method of selling automobiles to consumers. Tesla has had recent success selling direct to consumers, which Geely acknowledges.[11]

Instead of building its cars as trim levels, a method of building variations common used in the industry, each car will be ordered by the buyer and customized using equipment packages, though variations will be limited.[12]

Lynk & Co reported sales of 120,414 vehicles in China for 2018. The first full year the brand was on the market. The marque has opened 221 retail outlets in China.[13][14]
