Hermann_Czech.jpg HERMANN CZECH (born 10 November 1936) is an Austrian architect. He was born and lives in Vienna, where he has a private practice.


Education and teaching positions

Hermann Czech studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna and in the master classes of Ernst Plischke at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. In 1958 and 1959 he participated in the seminars of Konrad Wachsmann at the Summer Academy in Salzburg.

From 1974 to 1980 he was an assistant to Hans Hollein and Johannes Spalt at the University of Applied Arts Vienna. He has been a guest professor at that university (1985/86) and a visiting professor at Harvard University (1988/89 and 1993/94), ETH Zurich (2004–07) and the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna (2011–12).


Work

Czech has been influenced by the Viennese architects Adolf Loos and Josef Frank, and by the theoretical work of Konrad Wachsmann. His work is noted for a strong emphasis on context, a sophisticated and often ironic use of architectural elements, and an interest in rules and underlying order rather than sculptural form.
