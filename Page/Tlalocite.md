TLALOCITE is a rare and complex tellurate mineral with the formula Cu₁₀Zn₆(TeO₄)₂(TeO₃)(OH)₂₅Cl · 27 H₂O. It has a Mohs hardness of 1, and a cyan color. It was named after Tlaloc, the Aztec god of rain, in allusion to the high amount of water contained within the crystal structure.[1][2] It is not to be confused with quetzalcoatlite, which often looks similar in color and habit.


Occurrence

Tlalocite was first identified in the Bambollite mine (La Oriental), Moctezuma, Municipio de Moctezuma, Sonora, Mexico and it was approved by the IMA in 1974. It often occurs together with tenorite, azurite, malachite and tlapallite. It is found in partially oxidized portions of tellurium-bearing hydrothermal veins.[3][4]
