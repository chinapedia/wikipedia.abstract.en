OLD PRUSSIAN is an extinct Baltic language once spoken by the Old Prussians, the Baltic peoples of the Prussian region. The language is called Old Prussian to avoid confusion with the German dialects of Low Prussian and High Prussian and with the adjective _Prussian_ as it relates to the later German state. Old Prussian began to be written down in the Latin alphabet in about the 13th century, and a small amount of literature in the language survives.


Original territory

In addition to Prussia proper, the original territory of the Old Prussians might have included eastern parts of Pomerelia (some parts of the region east of the Vistula River). The language might have also been spoken much further east and south in what became Polesia and part of Podlasie, with the conquests by Rus and Poles starting in the 10th century and the German colonisation of the area that began in the 12th century.


Relation to other languages

Old Prussian was closely related to the other extinct Western Baltic languages, namely Curonian, Galindian[1] and Sudovian. It is related to the Eastern Baltic languages such as Lithuanian and Latvian, and more distantly related to Slavic. Compare the words for "land": Old Prussian __, (), and .

Old Prussian contained loanwords from Slavic languages (e.g., Old Prussian __ "hound", like Lithuanian __ and Latvian __, comes from Slavic (compare , ; ; )), as well as a few borrowings from Germanic, including from Gothic (e.g., Old Prussian __ "awl" as with Lithuanian __, Latvian __) and from Scandinavian languages.[2]

  "For a time, therefore, the Protestants had to be cautious in Poland proper, but they found a sure refuge in Prussia, where Lutheranism was already the established religion, and where the newly erected University of Königsberg became a seminary for Polish ministers and preachers."

Ccel.org, Christianity in Poland

  "Albert of Brandenburg, Grand Master of the German Order in Prussia, called as preacher to Konigsberg Johann Briesaman (q.v.), Luther's follower (1525); and changed the territory of the order into a hereditary grand duchy under Polish protection. From these borderlands the movement penetrated Little Poland which was the nucleus for the extensive kingdom. [...] In the mean time the movement proceeded likewise among the nobles of Great Poland; here the type was Lutheran, instead of Reformed, as in Little Poland. Before the Reformation the Hussite refugees had found asylum here; now the Bohemian and Moravian brethren, soon to be known as the Unity of the Brethren (q.v.), were expelled from their home countries and, on their way to Prussia (1547), about 400 settled in Posen under the protection of the Gorka, Leszynski, and Ostrorog families."

Lithuania, France, Scotland,[3] England,[4] and Austria (see Salzburg Protestants) found refuge in Prussia during the Protestant Reformation and thereafter. Such immigration caused a slow decline in the use of Old Prussian, as the Prussians adopted the languages of their more recently arrived co-citizens, particularly German. Baltic Old Prussian probably ceased to be spoken around the beginning of the 18th century due to many of its remaining speakers dying in the famines and bubonic plague epidemics which harrowed the East Prussian countryside and towns from 1709 until 1711.[5] The Germanic regional dialect of Low German spoken in Prussia (or East Prussia), called Low Prussian (cf. High Prussian, also a Germanic language), preserved a number of Baltic Prussian words, such as __, from the Old Prussian __, for _shoe_ in contrast to common Low German __ (standard German __).

Before the 1930s, when Nazi Germany began a program of Germanisation, one could find Old Prussian river- and place-names there, such as __ and __. [6]

A list of monuments of Old Prussian

The_epigram_of_Basel_-_oldest_known_inscription_in_Prussian_language_and_Baltic_language_in_general,_middle_of_14th_c.jpg

-   Prussian-language geographical names within the territory of (Baltic) Prussia. Georg Gerullis undertook the first basic study of these names in __ ("The Old Prussian Place-names"), written and published with the help of Walter de Gruyter, in 1922.
-   Prussian personal names.[7]
-   Separate words found in various historical documents.
-   Vernacularisms in the former German dialects of East and West Prussia, as well as words of Old Curonian origin in Latvian, and West-Baltic vernacularisms in Lithuanian and Belarusian.
-   The so-called Basel Epigram, the oldest written Prussian sentence (1369).[8][9] It reads:

    This jocular inscription was most probably made by a Prussian student studying in Prague (Charles University); found by Stephen McCluskey (1974) in manuscript MS F.V.2 (book of physics __ by Nicholas Oresme), fol. 63r, stored in the Basel University library.

-   Various fragmentary texts:
    Recorded in several versions by Hieronymus Maletius in Sudovian Nook in the middle of the 16th century, as noted by Vytautas Mažiulis, are:
    1.  __ ("Run, run, devils!")
    2.  __ ("Hello our friend!")
    3.  __ – a drinking toast, reconstructed as __ ("A healthy one after a healthy one, one after another!")
    4.  __ ("A carter drives here, a carter drives here!")
    5.  __ – also recorded as __, __, __ ("Oh my dear holy fire!")
-   A manuscript fragment of the first words of the in Prussian, from the beginning of the 15th century: __.
-   100 words (in _strongly_ varying versions) of the Vocabulary by a friar Simon Grunau, a historian of the Teutonic Knights, written in his __. Apart from those words Grunau also recorded an expression __ ("This (is) our lord, our lord").
-   The so-called Elbing Vocabulary, which consists of 802 thematically sorted words and their German equivalents. Peter Holcwesscher from Marienburg copied the manuscript around 1400; the original dates from the beginning of the 14th or the end of the 13th century. It was found in 1825 by Fr Neumann among other manuscripts acquired by him from the heritage of the Elbing merchant A. Grübnau; it was thus dubbed the __.
-   The three Catechisms[10] printed in in 1545, 1545, and 1561 respectively. The first two consist of only 6 pages of text in Old Prussian – the second one being a correction of the first into another Old Prussian dialect. The third catechism, or _Enchiridion_, consists of 132 pages of text, and is a translation of Luther's Small Catechism by a German cleric called Abel Will, with his Prussian assistant Paul Megott. Will himself knew little or no Old Prussian, and his Prussian interpreter was probably illiterate, but according to Will spoke Old Prussian quite well. The text itself is mainly a word-for-word translation, and Will phonetically recorded Megott's oral translation. Because of this, Enchiridion exhibits many irregularities, such as the lack of case agreement in phrases involving an article and a noun, which followed word-for-word German originals as opposed to native Old Prussian syntax.
-   Commonly thought of as Prussian, but probably actually Lithuanian (at least the adage, however, has been argued to be genuinely West Baltic, only an otherwise unattested dialect

):

*# An adage of 1583, __: the form __ in the second instance corresponds to Lithuanian future tense __ ("will give")

*# __ ("Strike! Strike!")


Grammar

With other monuments being merely word lists, the grammar of Old Prussian is reconstructed chiefly on the basis of the three Catechisms. There is no consensus on the number of cases that Old Prussian had, and at least four can be determined with certainty: nominative, genitive, accusative and dative, with different desinences. There are traces of a vocative case, such as in the phrase __ "O God the Lord", reflecting the inherited PIE vocative ending *__. There was a definite article (__ m., __ f.); three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter, and two numbers: singular and plural. Declensional classes were __-stems, __-stems (feminine), __-stems (feminine), __-stems, __-stems, __/__-stems, __/__-stems and consonant-stems. Present, future and past tense are attested, as well as optative forms (imperative, permissive), infinitive, and four participles (active/passive present/past).


Revived Old Prussian

A few linguists and philologists are involved in reviving a reconstructed form of the language from Luther's catechisms, the Elbing Vocabulary, place names, and Prussian loanwords in the Low Prussian dialect of German. Several dozen people use the language in Lithuania, Kaliningrad, and Poland, including a few children who are natively bilingual. The Prusaspirā Society has published their translation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's _The Little Prince_. The book was translated by Piotr Szatkowski (Pīteris Šātkis) and released in 2015.[11] The other efforts of Baltic Prussian societies include the development of online dictionaries, learning apps and games. There also have been several attempts to produce music with lyrics written in the revived Baltic Prussian language, most notably in the Kaliningrad Oblast by Romowe Rikoito[12], Kellan and Āustras Laīwan, but also in Lithuania by Kūlgrinda in their 2005 album _Prūsų Giesmės_ (Prussian Hymns),[13] and in Latvia by Rasa Ensemble in 1988[14] and Valdis Muktupāvels in his 2005 oratorio "Pārcēlātājs Pontifex" featuring several parts sung in Prussian.[15]

Important in this revival was Vytautas Mažiulis, who died on 11 April 2009, and his pupil Letas Palmaitis, leader of the experiment and author of the website _Prussian Reconstructions_.[16] Two late contributors were Prāncis Arellis (Pranciškus Erelis), Lithuania, and Dailūns Russinis (Dailonis Rusiņš), Latvia. After them, Twankstas Glabbis from Kaliningrad oblast and Nērtiks Pamedīns from East-Prussia, now Polish Warmia-Mazuria actively joined.
