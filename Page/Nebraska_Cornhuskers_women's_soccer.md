Along with Walker, the coaching staff is made up of two assistant coaches (Ian Bridge and Marty Everging), a Volunteer Coach (Zach Lind), and the Soccer Secretary (Cathy Robertson).


History

The first year for the Women's Soccer Team was 1994.

In 1994, Nebraska, a Big Eight School, was the first to add Women's Soccer as a varsity sport. The success of coach Walker and the Huskers was established in 1996 when they had a breakthrough season. The Huskers entered the NCAA Tournament and advanced to the NCAA quarterfinals. Walker led the team to a 19-0 season and a Big 12 Title. This winning streak continued to 21-0 by receiving two additional wins at the Big 12 Conference Soccer Championship in St. Louis. The Huskers entered the NCAA Tournament with the longest streak of wins, all while remaining unbeaten and the only untied team in the country. These wins put the Huskers Women's Soccer team in the record book and also established a fan base.[3]

Their 2016 season they had 27 players on the Roster. Players come from all over the United States. Some come from Texas, California, Chicago and Kansas. They also have one player from Brazil as well.[4]

In the 15-year history of the conference, Nebraska accomplished a league best, 106-47-15 with a .631 percentage of wins. The team, as a whole, has an astonishing track record of wins, but it doesn't stop there. The number of individual wins is just as impressive. The Women's Team has won 70 individual all-conference selections and 33 All-Big 12 Tournament awards.[5][6]

Over the past 22 years, 12 of the Women have won a total of 18 NSCAA All-American certificates from the National Coaches Association of America. Some players have even gone on to compete at international levels, while many have continued professional careers as well.[7]

She is third in the big ten with 11 goals.[9] The women's goalie, Aubrei Corder was named Big Ten defensive player as well as the Big Ten freshman of the week. She earned her third shutout against the Rutgers. Corder has played in every single game in the 2016 season.[10]

Stadium

The Huskers play In Barbara Hibner Soccer Stadium. Built in 2015 the 2500 person capacity stadium is part of the Nebraska Soccer and Tennis Complex. The Stadium is named after former Women's Athletic Director Barbara Hibner. Hibner was an integral part in adding women's soccer to the university.[12] Previously the women's soccer team had, since its creation, played at Nebraska Soccer field. The new Stadium has an increased capacity and permanent lights.[13] Long time Husker soccer coach John Walker said of the stadium "This is phenomenal. Everything is first class. There’s nothing cookie-cutter about it.” [14]The new stadium led to an increase in attendance; the 2015 season boasted an average attendance of 1381, 13th nationally.[15]

They used to play in the inside of Ed Weir Track and Field Stadium. This was one of the smallest fields in the Big Ten Conference.[16] Ed Weir stadium was built in 1975.[17] Though Ed Weir stadium was on campus and Hibner is not, Hibner stadium is still nearby (near Nebraska's Innovation Campus) and also has free parking.[18]

As for 2016 news, the Huskers finished their season with an 11-6-5 record. The team hasn't had this number of wins since back in 2013. The Huskers lost in the second round of the NCAA Tournament at Dick Dlesk Soccer Stadium (WVU) on November 18 to the UCLA Bruins.[19]
