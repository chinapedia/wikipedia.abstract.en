The LEAGUE 1 PROMOTION FINAL, previously known as the CHAMPIONSHIP 1 GRAND FINAL, is the title deciding game in League 1 rugby.


History

Since 1998 the Super League title has been determined by a final and this was expanded to the Championship where a grand final was contested between 2003 and 2014. League 1 had always had a team being promoted automatically along with a playoff system with another team being promoted.

In 2014 the Rugby Football League introduced the Championship 1 Grand Final which was contested by the top five teams and was won by Hunslet who were promoted.

in 2015 the league was expanded and the format was changed. The grand final was renamed the League 1 Promotion Final and is played at the home of the league leaders, not a neutral venue.


Structure

The top two teams qualify for the promotion final which is played at the home of the league leaders. The loser goes on to play in the League 1 Play-offs playing at home to 5th, 3rd plays 4th and the winners of these two games play in the playoff final.
