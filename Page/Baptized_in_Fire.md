Critical reception

Adrian Marcano from _Inverse_ named it as the fourth best song from the album and wrote that it "goes extra hard with a deep bassy twang that we hear on a lot of records that Travis is on".[4] Noisey wrote: "The brooding track finds both artists showcasing their signature, crawling harmonies".[5]
