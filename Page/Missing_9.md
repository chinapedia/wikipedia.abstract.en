Synopsis

A plane that carries 47 passengers unexpectedly crashed and caused a widespread panic in South Korea due to also carrying 9 influential figures in the entertainment industry on board. They are personnel of the company, Legend Entertainment; celebrities Seo Joon-oh, Choi Tae-oh, Lee Yeol, Ha Ji-ah, Yoon Soo-hee, President Hwang Jae-guk, Secretary Tae Ho-Hang, Manager Jung Ki-joon and Stylist Ra Bong-hee. After 4 whole months, Bong-hee found herself unconscious by the sea in China, where she was successfully rescued and is the first survivor of the plane crash found. She was subsequently transported back to South Korea, where she had to provide limited aid to Investigation Commission of the plane crash incident due to her short-term memory loss. During the period of time when Bong-hee tries to regain her memory, almost all of the 9 people return to South Korea successfully, turning out to have survived the plane crash as well. However, Bong-hee and the rest have to now fight against one of the survivors who is responsible for the murders that occurred back in the island the survivors were living on and also the Head of the Investigation Commission, Jo Hee-kyung, who is only concerned about public sentiment instead of the truth.[9][10][11][12]
