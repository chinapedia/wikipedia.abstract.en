ADDIS ABABA CITY F.C. (Also known as Addis Abeba Kenema) is an Ethiopian football club based in Addis Ababa. They currently play in the Ethiopian Higher League, the 2nd tier of football in Ethiopia.


History

The club was promoted to the Ethiopian Premier League, the top tier of football in Ethiopia, after the end of the 2015-16 season. However, the success was short lived as a poor 2016-17 campaign saw the club being relegated back to the Ethiopian Higher League.[1]


Controversy and Disputes

During the 2016-17 season the club was accused of mistreatment after allegedly refusing to facilitate two Cameroon players way back to Cameroon after aborted trials.[2]
