OKAMATAPATI is a settlement in the Otjozondjupa Region of Namibia, situated south of Grootfontein and north of Otjinene.[1] The name _Okamatapati_ is derived from _Omutapati_, the Otjiherero name for the Mouse-eared combretum, a shrub that is common in the area.[2]

Herero people were resettled to this area, then known as Hereroland, in the 1960s. The _Odendaal Plan_ declared several bantustans, one for each tribe, and forced Blacks to vacate all other areas of then-South-West Africa. Okamatapati was situated at the western edge of the Herero area. An affluent community developed who soon elected their own tribal chiefs.[3]

The _Okamatapati Farmers Association_ was founded in 1983. It ran the first _Okamatapati Show_, an agricultural show for cattle farmers, in 1986. The show has been run for the 28th time in 2016 but is no longer conducted in Okamatapati. In 2012 it moved to Windhoek and became part of the Windhoek Show. Except a one-time stint at the Grootfontein Show in 2014 it is now held annually in Windhoek.[4]

The main economic activity is cattle farming, particularly weaner production, which is supported by the occurrence of _Terminalia sericea_, a deciduous tree that the animals feed on during the dry season. Devil's claw is also harvested here.[5]
