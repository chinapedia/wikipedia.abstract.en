SAN NICOLA DI BARAGGIOLA is a Roman Catholic church located in the neighborhood of Baraggiola (o Barazzola), in the town limits of Borgomanero, province of Novara, Piedmont, Italy.


History

A structure at the site is documented by the 10th century. In the 12th century, the church was linked to Augustinian eremitic monks, with an adjacent monastery. The spare-appearing church has a single nave and ends in a semicircular apse.[1] The tall 10th-century bell-tower, which doubled as watch-tower, is a Romanesque structure with mullioned windows.[2]
