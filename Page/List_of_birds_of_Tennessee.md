This LIST OF BIRDS OF TENNESSEE includes species documented in the U.S. state of Tennessee and accepted by the Tennessee Bird Records Committee (TBRC) of the Tennessee Ornithological Society. As of April 2014, 408 species are on the official list.[1] Of them, 95 are considered accidental and 13 are labeled provisional as defined below. Five species were introduced to North America, two are extinct, and two have been extirpated. Between when the official list was published in 2014 and June 2019, an additional 22 species have been reported through eBird but not yet evaluated by the TBRC.[2]

This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the _Check-list of North American Birds_, 7th edition through the 59th Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS).[3][4] Common and scientific names are also those of the _Check-list_.

Unless otherwise noted, all species listed below are considered to occur regularly in Tennessee as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. These tags are used to annotate some species:

-   (A) ACCIDENTAL – a "very rare and unpredictable vagrant" per the TBRC
-   (P) PROVISIONAL – "less than 3 accepted records within the state without photographs or a specimen" per the TBRC
-   (E) EXTINCT – a recent species that no longer exists
-   (Exp) EXTIRPATED – a species which formerly occurred in Tennessee
-   (I) INTRODUCED – a species established solely as result of direct or indirect human intervention; synonymous with non-native and non-indigenous
