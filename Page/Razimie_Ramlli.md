Soldadu MUHAMMAD RAZIMIE BIN RAMLLI (born 6 August 1990) is a Bruneian international footballer who plays for Singapore Premier League side DPMM FC and the Brunei national football team as a striker.[1]


Club career

Razimie is a soldier with the Royal Brunei Armed Forces who began playing with its sports council's football department in 2015, scoring 12 goals in his debut season.[2] He won the Brunei Super League twice in a row and also the 2015 Brunei FA Cup.

On 29 September 2017, Razimie scored a hat-trick in the 4-1 win over title contenders Kota Ranger FC, who were unbeaten before the match took place.[3]

Razimie moved to Brunei's sole professional team DPMM FC in February 2019, reuniting him with his ABDB strike partner Abdul Azizi Ali Rahman.[4] He made his debut in the home fixture against Geylang International on 9 March as a late substitute, scoring a 90th minute goal to seal a 3–0 win for his team.[5]


International career

After another solid season in 2016, Razimie was selected for the Brunei national team in October for the 2016 AFF Suzuki Cup qualification matches and the 2016 AFC Solidarity Cup.[6] He, along with Baharin Hamidon, was a surprise addition to the squad that usually relies heavily on Brunei DPMM FC and Tabuan Muda players. He made his debut on 21 October against Laos and scored the final goal of the game in a 4-3 defeat.[7] He made one further appearance at the Solidarity Cup held two weeks later in Malaysia.

In April 2018, he was selected as an overage player for the Brunei under-21 team competing for the 2018 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy held in his home country.[8] He came on in the second half of the opening game which ended 0-1 against Timor-Leste. Later that year, he appeared for the full national team as a second-half substitute in a 1-0 win against Timor-Leste at the Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium on 8 September.[9]

The following year, Razimie was selected for the Wasps' two-legged 2022 World Cup qualification in June.[10] He started in both games and scored twice in the second leg at home for a 2–1 win over Mongolia. His goals were not enough to put Brunei through as Brunei lost 2–3 on aggregate.[11]
