KEVIN DALE ROBERTS (born January 16, 1966)[1] is an attorney who formerly served as a one-term member of the Texas House of Representatives for District 126 in Harris County.[2][3] He resides in Spring, Texas.


Early life

A fourth generation Texan, Roberts was reared by his grandparents in his native Amarillo. As a 14-year-old, he got his first job delivering prescriptions for a local retail drugstore. Paying his own way through Texas Tech University in Lubbock, he became the first college graduate in his family.


2016 Election

Roberts ran without opposition in the Republican legislative primary on March 1, 2016, after the Republican incumbent, Patricia Harless, did not seek re-election. In the general election on November 8, 2016, Roberts received 58 percent of the ballots casted defeating Democrat, Joy Dawson-Thomas, and Libertarian Party candidate, Eric Moquin.


2018 Election

Upon the announcement of incumbent U.S. Representative Ted Poeâ€™s retirement effective in January 2019, Roberts announced his candidacy for the seat against a crowded field of nine other challengers. After placing first in the March 6th primary with 33 percent of the vote, Roberts was defeated by retired United States Navy SEAL Dan Crenshaw in the Republican run-off primary on May 22. He obtained 30.2 percent of the vote, compared to Crenshaw's 69.8 percent. Crenshaw then won the seat in the general election on November 6, 2018. A negative super PAC, funded by Roberts' brother-in-law, Mark Lanier, ran ads opposing Crenshaw's candidacy for the nomination.[4] The day following the run-off election, Roberts posted an apology for anyone offended during the campaign before removing all of his political social media accounts.


Personal life

Roberts is the Executive Director for the Lanier Law Firm in Houston, Texas.
