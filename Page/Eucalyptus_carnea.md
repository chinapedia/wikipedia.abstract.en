_EUCALYPTUS CARNEA_, known as the THICK-LEAVED MAHOGANY[1] or BROAD-LEAVED WHITE MAHOGANY,[2] is species of tree that is endemic to coastal areas of eastern Australia. It has rough, stringy bark from the trunk to the thinnest branches, lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, white flowers and cup-shaped to hemispherical fruit.[3][4]Eucalyptus_carnea_buds.jpgEucalyptus_carnea_flowers.jpgEucalyptus_carnea_fruit.jpg


Description

_Eucalyptus carnea_ is a tree that grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough grey or brownish, stringy or fibrous bark from the trunk to the thinnest branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves arranged in opposite pairs, lance-shaped to curved, long, wide and a different shade on either side. Adult leaves are lance-shaped or curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The leaves are bluish green on one side and a lighter green on the other. The flowers are borne in groups of seven, nine or eleven in leaf axils on a sometimes branched peduncle, long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to spindle-shaped, long and wide with a conical to slightly beaked operculum. Flowering mainly occurs from September to November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical or shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves about level with the rim.[5][6]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus carnea_ was first formally described by the botanist Richard Thomas Baker in 1906 from specimens collected near the Richmond River by William Baeuerlen, (previously known as Wilhelm BÃ¤uerlen). The description was published in _Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales_.[7][8][9] The specific epithet (_carnea_) is a Latin word meaning "of flesh",[10] possibly referring to the colour of the heartwood.[11]

_Eucalyptus carnea_ is part of the white mahogany group as recognised by Ken Hill. Others in the group include _E. acmenoides_, _E. mediocris_, _E. apothalassica_, _E. helidonica_, _E. latisinensis_, _E. psammitica_ and _E. umbra_.[12]


Distribution and habitat

Thick-leaved mahogany grows in forest in shallow soil between Gympie in Queensland and the Hunter River in New South Wales.[13][14]
