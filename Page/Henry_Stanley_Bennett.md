HENRY STANLEY BENNETT, FBA (1889-1972) was an English literary historian.[1] Known as STANLEY BENNETT, publishing as H. S. BENNETT, Bennett was an authority on mediaeval England, publishing _Life on the English Manor_ in 1937, and subsequently writing extensively on literature of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.


Education and Family

Bennett was educated initially at St Mark's College in Chelsea, and upon graduation became a schoolmaster at a London elementary school. After being invalided during the final stages of the Great War, he returned to England and gained admission to study at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.[2]

In 1920 Bennett married the literary critic Joan Frankau.[3] Their son, Christopher S. Bennett, was a contemporary of the writer Simon Raven at King's College, Cambridge; he went into the Treasury, and disappeared (possibly intentionally, given a work dispute and his hosting of several parties prior to his departure) in September 1966 whilst on a walking tour of the Savoy Alps.[4] Their daughter Margaret (born 1924) married in 1948 the librarian Philip Gaskell.[5]
