Sharna Liguz, also known as SSHH LIGUZ, is an Australian artist and singer currently living in London, UK. She is a part of the music duo _Sshh_ with musician Zak Starkey.[1]


Early life

Sshh Liguz was born on September 10, 1984 in Bondi, New South Wales, Australia,[2] where she grew up with an interest in entertainment and the arts. As a teenager, she wrote reviews and hosted a radio show[3] before attending Bradfield College of the Arts and eventually the National Art School.[4] In school, Liguz began playing with various bands in Australia, and became more interested in performing than attending art classes with their strict structure. Liguz dropped out of art school and moved to England looking for her next path.[5] Liguz eventually met musician Zak Starkey at a show,[6] and they began making music together.[7] They began collaborating when Starkey was touring as the drummer for Oasis. Starkey sent Sshh a guitar riff which she added on to, leading to their first song recorded over the phone.[8] They started releasing material in 2006 under the name Pengu!ns, with Starkey on drums, Sshh on vocals, Shane Devany on guitar, and Tatia Starkey on bass. The project name comes from the lyric ‘Penguins start your engines’ from their song ‘Jet Engines.’[9] The group began playing live together in 2008,[10] and in 2011, the touring Pengu!ns lineup consisted solely of Sshh and Starkey as a duo.[11] They now both reside in London, UK.


_Sshh_

The duo continued making music together in London with Zak on guitar and Liguz on vocals under the name Sshh. They were asked to do a SiriusXM series discussing their musical influences. Instead of simply discussing individual songs, the duo decided to take a different approach to the series by inviting original members of the rhythm sections of the influential bands to play with them and record.[12] The effort resulted in Issues, the duo's debut album of cover songs which benefits the Teen Cancer Program.[13]

The duo have not set a release date for the album, but have released the track list with the names of collaborating artists:[14]
