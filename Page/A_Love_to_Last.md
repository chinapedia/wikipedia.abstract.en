Cast and characters

Main cast

-   Bea Alonzo as Andrea "Andeng" Agoncillo-Noble, Anton's second wife and stepmother of Chloe, Lucas, and Kitty. She is about 18 years younger than Anton, but is matured beyond her years. Despite the age difference, she falls in love and marries Anton. She embraces her role as step mother of three children and supportive wife of a successful and ambitious man, whose first marriage failed because of his ambition. A career woman herself, she successfully balances her priorities, and brings much happiness into Anton's life and his family's. Her biggest challenge is Grace, her husband's ex-wife, who is obsessed and determined to destroy their marriage, pushing Andrea's fears of infidelity and insecurities about her place in Anton's heart. This causes friction in their marriage. At some point, she almost gives up. But a chance conversation with an ex-fiancé opens her eyes to the important piece she was giving up, and that was the family she built with her husband and his children.
-   Ian Veneracion as Antonio "Anton" Noble IV. Devastated after Grace leaves him and their children, he picks up the pieces of his family's broken hearts. To fill the vacuum left by Grace's departure, he becomes a hands on Dad, restacks his priorities, and places his career and business second to his children's needs. Because of Anton's nurturing, the children adjust to a happy single parent household. After their annulment, he becomes the country's most eligible bachelor, but no one captures his heart except Andrea. Despite various challenges from their individual families, their relationship prevails and is finally accepted by everyone, except Grace Silverio, his haughty, self-serving, self-centered ex-wife. Anton is determined to protect his second marriage from Grace's manipulations and obsession to reclaim him. He's a kind hearted man, who finds it difficult to put his ex in her place, although he tries to many times. Despite all, Grace’s manipulative tactic wears down Andrea, succeeding in breaking up the marriage, but he never gives up. Just when he and his children were taking off on their private plane to HK to fulfill a long promised vacation with his children, Andrea returns. They happily reconcile and the series ends with Andrea giving him the news of her pending pregnancy.
-   Iza Calzado as Grace Silverio, Anton's ex-wife and mother of Chloe, Lucas, and Kitty who she abandoned three years ago. Grace is a spoiled heiress who feels she needs to be free from the domineering and controlling personality of her husband. In reality, she has someone in LA. Despite Anton's pleas to return to Manila, and the risk of losing custody of her children, she insists on an annulment. She leaves behind a 15 year old, 13 year old and a 5 year old. Three years later, after two failed relationships, Grace decides to return home to reclaim her husband and children. She realizes that she is still in love with him and tries everything to drive a wedge between Anton and Andrea and her children, in the hope that she can win him back. Her obsession becomes a major concern for her children. Her last ditched effort to win Anton by confessing that she loves and wants him back fails. Anton rejects her, but she steals a passionate kiss which is unfortunately witnessed by Andrea. Anton's rejection, and Chloe's reprimand accusing her of destroying their family a second time, drives grace to commit suicide. She survives and returns to the US to heal. Anton promises her that the children would spend summers with her.
-   Julia Barretto as Chloe Silverio Noble. Anton and Grace's eldest child who fills the role of "mother-figure" to her siblings when Grace leaves them. She is in a relationship with Fort, but actually likes Tupe. She eventually chooses Tupe, but Fort remains her best friend. Chloe's priority is to ensure her family remains intact and her father's happiness is more important than her own mother's. She is happy about Andrea's relationship with her father, and she is instrumental in Lucas' change of heart for Andrea. She struggles with her father's disciplinary actions regarding her relationship with Tupe. Andrea successfully bridges this challenge. Chloe also sees through her mother's antics towards Andrea. She asks her mother to back off. Grace's obsession remains a big concern for the children, and Chloe has taken it upon herself to communicate their dismay to their mother. They love and respect their mother, but they are very clear they value the importance of Andrea in their lives. They love their stepmother very much and want to make sure their mother does not destroy the family they had built with her.
-   Ronnie Alonte as Christopher "Tupe" Dimayuga. Chloe's boyfriend. He is a brilliant scholar, who interned at Anton's company, and earned the respect of his colleagues and teachers. Unfortunately, his lack of maturity to handle first love and its responsibilities, has driven him into situations that made him lose his scholarship and employment. Chloe loves him deeply, tries hard to understand him, and struggles to preserve their relationship, even if she was forbidden by her father to embark into a boyfriend relationship with him. Unfortunately, their disobedience has caused various conflicts and heartaches for both. As Tupe drives the relationship towards a downward spiral because of his immature decisions, Chloe is understanding now what it takes to keep a relationship. She is opening her eyes to the large maturity gap that exists in her relationship with Tupe. After seeing the experience of her mom and dads failed marriage, and the separation of her dad and step mom, she broke up with Tupe.

-   Hannah Lopez Vito as Katherine "Kitty" Silverio Noble. Anton and Grace's youngest child who is supportive of her father's relationship with Andrea.
