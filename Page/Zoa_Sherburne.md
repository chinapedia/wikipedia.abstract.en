ZOA SHERBURNE (30 September 1912 â€“ 10 October 1995) was an American author, most known for her young adult fiction.[1]


Early life

Sherburne was born in Seattle, Washington and began writing in elementary school.[2] At 10, she started writing poetry.[3] Her local newspaper, the _Ballard Tribune_, published a column of her poetry called "The Gremlin's Say."[4] She started writing short stories, poems, and plays.[5]


Career

Sherburne went on to be a very prolific writer, publishing over 300 short stories in magazines.[6][7] In the 1950s, upon her agent's suggestion, she began writing books as they noticed that short stories began to be less-published due to television's rising popularity.[8][9] She went on to publish thirteen novels, which together have been translated into over 27 languages.[10] One of her books, _Stranger in the House_, about a family dealing with the return of their mother from a mental institution, became a movie: _Memories Never Die_ (1982).[11] Her novels often dealt with girls in difficult circumstances: coping with a mother's alcoholism (_Jennifer_), with the remarriage of a parent (_Almost April_ and _The Girl in the Mirror_), with an unexpected pregnancy (_Too Bad About the Haines Girl_), with guilt over a hit-and-run (_Leslie_). In her time slip story _Why Have the Birds Stopped Singing?_ the stigma of epilepsy is added to the usual cultural disorientation, and in her paranormal tale _The Girl Who Knew Tomorrow_, the young psychic girl finds fame a mixed blessing. For _Jennifer_, she received the Children's Book Award for 1959.[12]
