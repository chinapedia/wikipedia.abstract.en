HAUT-MADAWASKA is a rural community in Madawaska County within the province of New Brunswick, Canada. It is located in the New Brunswick Panhandle and was formed in 2017 through the amalgamation of four villages with five local service districts and a portion of a sixth local service district.


History

In a 2016 plebiscite, the residents of five local service districts (the parishes of Baker Brook, Clair, Lac Baker, Saint-François, and Saint-Hilaire), part of a sixth local service district (the parish of Madawaska) and four villages (Baker Brook, Clair, Saint-François de Madawaska and Saint-Hilaire) voted 493 to 299 in favour of incorporating a new rural community under the name of Haut-Madawaska.[1] The incorporation took effect July 1, 2017.[2] The plebiscite was the second in as many years. In 2015, a similar plebiscite was held that also included a fifth village, Lac Baker. The residents of all communities involved voted in favour of incorporation as a rural community with the exception of Lac Baker's residents, thereby defeating the proposal.[3]
