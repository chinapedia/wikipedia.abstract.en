BHR PARTNERS is a private investment fund founded in 2014 by Chinese and American partners to make investments outside of China.


History

BHR was founded in 2013[1] by Chinese asset managers Bohai Industrial Investment Fund Management Co. and Harvest Fund Management Co. and U.S. investment and advisory firms Rosemont Seneca Partners and Thornton Group LLC.[2] The company website in 2016 reported that Bohai Capital managed the RMB20 Billion and Harvest ranks among China's largest mutual fund management companies. The website said the company has "the support of Bank of China, China Development Bank Capital, and other major Chinese financial institutions.[3]

The firm set out in 2014 to raise $1.5 billion for investments, some in dollars and some in yuan. The yuan investments were to be converted to U.S. dollars through Shanghai Free-Trade Zone, facilitating offshore investment for Chinese investors. Rosemont Seneca is a Washington, D.C.-based investment and advisory firm run by Hunter Biden, the son of U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.[4] Thornton Group is a Boston-based cross-border investment advisory firm. The U.S. partners as a pair and the two Chinese partners each own a 30% stake in the joint management firm.[5]
