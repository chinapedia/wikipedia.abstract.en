Walker started singing when he was two or three years old, and began performing in public when he was four.[2] When he was ten, he was invited on stage to perform with The Oak Ridge Boys, and when he was eleven, he sang with The Oak Ridge Boys on The Nashville Network's Nashville Now as well as on the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon.[3]

He works at the Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant as a Material Inventory Coordinator while pursuing a music career.[4]


Music career

In 1998, Walker formed a band, The Trinity Mountain Boys, and began to perform at bluegrass festivals.[5] In 2001, he joined the Georgia-based group Lost Horizon.[6] He was signed to Rounder Records, and released his debut album, _Highway of Dreams_, in 2006.

2016: _Call Me Old-Fashioned_

Walker's second album, _Call Me Old-Fashioned_, was produced by Rory Feek and recorded at the Joey + Rory studio out on their farm. Walker had known Joey and Rory Feek since 2007, and he was asked by Rory Feek to sing the hymn "Leave It There" at the funeral of Joey Feek in accordance with her wishes.[9] Bill Gaither of the Gaither Music Group, who was also at the funeral service, heard Walker's performance and signed Walker to his label.[10] The album includes a posthumous duet with Joey Feek, "In The Time That You Gave Me", using vocals she recorded before her death.[11] The album was released on September 23, 2016,[12] and debuted at No. 9 on the Top Country Albums chart.[13]
