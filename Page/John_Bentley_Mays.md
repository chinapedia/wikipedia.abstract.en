JOHN BENTLEY MAYS (June 22, 1941 â€“ September 16, 2016) was a Canadian journalist and writer.[1] Best known as an art and architecture columnist for _The Globe and Mail_, he also published a novel and several non-fiction books.

Mays was born in rural Louisiana in 1941.[2] Both his parents died when he was a child, his father in a car accident and his mother of cancer, and he was raised thereafter by relatives in Shreveport.[3] He studied medieval literature and literary criticism at the University of Rochester, and moved to Toronto in 1969 to accept a teaching job at York University.[4] He married Margaret Cannon in 1971,[5] and published his first novel, _The Spiral Stair_, in 1978.[6] He joined _The Globe and Mail_ in 1980.[7]

In 1994 he published _Emerald City: Toronto Visited_, a collection of essays about Toronto architecture and history.[8] The following year he published _In the Jaws of the Black Dogs_, a memoir of his lifelong struggle with clinical depression.[9] In the book, he also came out as bisexual by orientation,[10] although he noted that for personal and religious reasons he had chosen to remain monogamously married to his wife rather than exploring his attractions to men.[11]

In 1997 he published _Power in the Blood_, a memoir about exploring his family history after the death of his aunt Vandalia in 1990.[12] The book was shortlisted for that year's Viacom Writers' Trust Prize for Nonfiction.[13] The following year he left _The Globe and Mail_ to become a general arts and culture journalist for the _National Post_, remaining with that paper until 2001.[14]

In 2002 he published _Arrivals: Stories from the History of Ontario_, a book about Ontario history.[15] The book won the Joseph Brant Award from the Ontario Historical Society. He was a freelance writer for a variety of publications in this era, until rejoining _The Globe and Mail_ in 2008 as an architecture columnist.[16] Over the course of his career in journalism, he won awards from both the National Newspaper Awards and the National Magazine Awards.[17] He also taught courses and gave guest lectures on architecture at OCAD University and the University of Toronto.[18]

Mays died of a heart attack on September 16, 2016 in Toronto, just two weeks after having completed writing his second novel.[19]
