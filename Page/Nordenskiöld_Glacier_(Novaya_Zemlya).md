The NORDENSKIÖLD GLACIER (; _Lednik Nordenshel'da_) is a group of four glaciers in Novaya Zemlya, Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia.[1]

This glacier group was named after Arctic explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld.


Geography

The Nordenskiöld Glacier group is located on the eastern side of northern Severny Island of Novaya Zemlya. Flowing from the Severny Island ice cap, it is composed of four roughly north-south oriented tidewater glaciers:

-   Vershinsky Glacier _(Lednik Vershinskogo)_, the soutwesternmost
-   Rozhdestvensky Glacier _(Lednik Rozhdestvenskogo)_
-   Novopashenny Glacier _(Lednik Novopashennogo)_, also known as _Lednik Sredniy_[2]
-   Roze Glacier _(Lednik Roze)_, the northeasternmost

Their fronts have widths of over 3 km in average and their terminuses are in the Kara Sea between Cape Opasnyy and Cape Middendorff.[3]
