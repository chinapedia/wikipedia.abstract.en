Balkåkragongen_(Montelius,_Sveriges_hednatid_(1877)_sid_151_fig_215).jpg Balkåkra_skiva.jpg The BALKÅKRA RITUAL OBJECT is an item from the Bronze Age found in Balkåkra in Sweden in 1847. Its use and purpose remain unknown.


History

The object was found in a bog in Balkåkra socken close to Ystad in Scania, Sweden in 1847. It has been dated to 1500 – 1300 BC, i.e. early Nordic Bronze Age. A similar item was discovered in 1913 not far from Sopron in Hungary. It has been suggested that the object found in Balkåkra may have been imported from present-day Hungary and not produced locally.[1][2]


Description

The item consists of a round frame made of bronze perforated with holes and carried by ten wheels. A flat and loose bronze plate placed on top of it. The plate is decorated with zig-zag patterns.[3] The diameter of the plate is and is slightly concave.[4]


Interpretation

It is not known what purpose the item served, but it has been assumed that it had a ritual use. Suggestions have been made that it could have been a gong, a drum, a throne or a burning glass.[5][6]
