ALFRED WILLIAM "FRED" HURLL CVO CBE (1905â€“1991) served as the General Secretary and then Chief Executive Commissioner of The Boy Scouts Association.[1]

As General Secretary of The Boy Scouts Association, Hurll visited post-war Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and France in October 1945 with T. Glad Bincham. They were able to make valuable first-hand contacts with the leaders of the Scout Movement in these countries, and to learn more of how Scouting had played a part during the occupation, and how it proposed to meet the future. In Luxembourg, they were received by Robert Schaffner, the Scout Commissioner, who had been elected mayor of the ruined town of Echternach the day before, and was already drawing up plans for its reconstruction.[2]

Hurll and John Frederick Colquhoun, the Boy Scouts Association Commissioner for Relations, were the organizers of the 1st World Scout Indaba (a gathering of Scout Leaders from around the world) which took place at Gilwell Park for a week in July, 1952.[3]

In 1957, Hurll was Deputy Camp Chief at the 9th World Scout Jamboree which was held at Sutton Park, Birmingham, England.

In 1966 Hurll was cited as being confident that the movement could reach one million members by 1975.[4]

In 1969, Hurll was awarded the 54th _Bronze Wolf_, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting.
