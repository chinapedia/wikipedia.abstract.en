POLITICS OF SURINAME take place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic, whereby the president of Suriname is the head of state and head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. The executive power is dependent on the parliament. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.


Executive branch

The executive branch is headed by the president, who is elected by a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly or, failing that twice, by a majority of the People's Assembly for a 5-year term. If at least two-thirds of the National Assembly cannot agree to vote for one presidential candidate, a People's Assembly is formed from all National Assembly delegates and regional and municipal representatives who were elected by popular vote in the most recent national election. The Vice President, normally elected at the same time as the president, is elected for a 5-year term, the same way as the president.[1] As head of government, the president appoints a cabinet of ministers who are led in their day-to-day activities by the Vice President. There is no constitutional provision for removal or replacement of the president unless he resigns.

A 15-member State Advisory Council advises the president in the conduct of policy. Eleven of the 15 council seats are allotted by proportional representation of all political parties represented in the National Assembly. The president chairs the council, and two seats are allotted to representatives of labor, and two are to employers' organizations. The Cabinet of Ministers appointed by the president. |President |Dési Bouterse |NDP |12 August 2015 |- |Vice President |Michael Ashwin Adhin |NDP |12 August 2015 |- |Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries |Soeresh Algoe |NDP |12 August 2015 |- |Minister of Defense |Ronnie Benschop |NDP |12 August 2015 |- |Minister of Education, Science & Culture |Robert Peneux |NDP |12 August 2015 |- |Minister of Finance |Gilmore Hoefdraad |NDP |12 August 2015 |- |Minister of Foreign Affairs |Niermala Badrising |NDP |12 August 2015 |- |Minister of Public Health |Patrick Pengel |NDP |12 August 2015 |- |Minister of Home Affairs |Mohamed Noersalim |Group Sapoen/Chitan |12 August 2015 |- |Minister of Justice & Police |Jennifer van Dijk-Silos |NDP |12 August 2015 |- |Minister of Labour |Soewarto Moestadja |NDP |4 September 2015 |- |Minister of Natural Resources |Regilio Dodson |DOE |12 August 2015 |- |Minister of Physical Planning, Land, and Forestry Management |Steven Relyveld |NDP |12 August 2015 |- |Minister of Public Works & Traffic |Siegfried Wolff |NDP |12 August 2015 |- |Minister of Regional Development |Andre Dikan |BEP |12 August 2015 |- |Minister of Sport & Youth Affairs |Faizal Abdoelgafoer |NDP |12 August 2015 |- |Minister of Trade & Industry |Sieglien Burleson |NDP |12 August 2015 |- |Minister of Transport, Communication & Tourism |Andojo Rusland |NDP |12 August 2015 |- |Minister of Welfare |Joan Dogojo |NDP |4 September 2015 |}
