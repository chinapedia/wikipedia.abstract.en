TOLD SLANT is an indie-pop band from Brooklyn. It is led by Felix Walworth. Walworth is also involved in other projects, including Gabby's World, Florist, and Bellows.[1][2] David Anthony, writing for The A.V. Club praised Walworth for their ability to produce "simple, heartbreaking songs".[3]


History

Told Slant was formed at Bard High School Early College where Walworth met Kalb and started playing music together.[4] Told Slant released _Still Water_ in 2012, and their sophomore album _Going By_ in 2016. Walworth writes and records all of the parts to the songs, bringing in other members for live performances. [5] Told Slant was scheduled to play at the 2017 South by Southwest festival but canceled over fears that the festival would aid in deporting foreign artists.[6]
