WVNC-LD, virtual and UHF digital channel 45, is a low-powered NBC-affiliated television station licensed to Watertown, New York, United States. The station is owned by SagamoreHill Broadcasting. WVNC-LD's studios are located at Public Square in downtown Watertown, and its transmitter is located along NY 126/State Street on Champion Hill.[1][2] The station can also be seen on Charter Spectrum channel 6.


History

Although the channel 45 frequency has never been used in Watertown before 2015, the adjacent channel 46 was the home of WLOT-LP, Watertown's UPN affiliate, until its owner died in 2007 and the station shut down.

On August 28, 2016, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the transfer of control of a low-power digital television license in Watertown, W45EI-D, from Sunrise, Florida-based DTV America Corporation to SagamoreHill Broadcasting.[3] The new owners promptly renamed the station WVNC-LD and signed it to an affiliation deal with NBC, giving the Watertown area its first full-time NBC affiliate. The new station signed-on December 1, 2016. Prior to WVNC-LD's sign-on, North Country cable systems piped in either WSTM-TV in Syracuse or WPTZ in Plattsburgh, depending on the location. WWNY-TV previously had a secondary affiliation with the network until 1995.[4] Both the Plattsburgh and Syracuse NBC stations are still available on cable along with the Watertown NBC station.
