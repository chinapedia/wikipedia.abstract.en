WILLIAM SMILLIE (c. 1810 – 11 Dec 1852) was an appointed member of the first Legislative Council of South Australia, serving from March 1840 to February 1851.


History

Smillie was a son of Matthew Smillie (c. 1781 – 12 March 1847), a solicitor of Leith, Scotland and his wife Elizabeth Corse Smillie, née Nairne (c. 1791 – 17 October 1861).[1] Smillie was a partner in his father's legal practice. He became fascinated with the newly founded colony of South Australia, and published a series of articles in the _Stirling Advertiser_, reprinted as a book _The Great South Land_ in 1838.

He and his parents subsequently emigrated on the _Indus_, arriving in South Australia in January 1839. His father purchased three sections in the vicinity of Mount Barker, which he subdivided, establishing the township of Nairne[2] which he named in honour of his wife.[3] They established a home, "The Vallies" or "The Valleys" in the area. In 1840 Smillie was appointed advocate-general, which position until 1857 was linked to a seat on the Legislative Council, succeeding Robert Bernard.

Smillie was plagued with poor health. In 1849 he took three months' leave of absence in Tasmania, in the hope of some improvement. William Bartley acted in his absence.[4] His health further failing, in June 1851 Smillie took eighteen months' leave of absence, holidaying in St. Thomas in the West Indies, where he experienced some improvement.[5] Charles Mann (the first incumbent) acted in his absence for a month or two, followed by Richard Davies Hanson. He died in Paris, _en route_ to Italy, and was buried in Scotland.

  He was distinguished by his general amiableness and cultivated mind, and by the interest he took, not only in his professional duties, but in all that related to the well-being of the colony[6]
