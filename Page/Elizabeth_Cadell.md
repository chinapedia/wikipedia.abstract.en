ELIZABETH VIOLET CADELL (née Vandyke) (November 10, 1903 – October 9, 1989)[1] was a 20th-century British writer. Born and raised in CALCUTTA, she was educated in England.[2] In 1928, she married H. D. R. M. Cadell; they had two children.[3] She spent her last years in Portugal.[4] Cadell sometimes used the pseudonym, Harriet Ainsworth.[5]


Writing

In _Last Straw for Harriet_ (1947)_,_ Cadell writes a "social comedy of the first order, hilarious, gay and given just the right touch," according to _The Courier-Journal_.[6] Her second novel, _Gay Pursuit_ (1948), tells the story of an American woman who marries into a British family who live in Devonshire.[7][8] _Kirkus Reviews_ described the book as light entertainment.[9] The movie rights for _Gay Pursuit_ were purchased by Twentieth Century Fox for $27,000 in 1948 with Rex Harrison meant to be the main star.[10][11] Later, it was decided that Harrison was "too old" to play the lead.[12] Gene Tierney was also meant to star in the picture.[13] Her next novel, _River Lodge_ (1948), which was called "a pleasant, gay book which grips the attention from start to finish," by _The Age_.[14] _Iris in Winter_ (1949) was considered a light, fun read by the _Oakland Tribune_.[15]

In 1950, she published the humorous ghost story, _Brimstone in the Garden_.[16] Elsa J. Radcliffe wrote in _Gothic Novels of the Twentieth Century_ (1979) that the ghost in the novel was "one of the most amusing ghosts it has been my pleasure to meet."[17] Cadell's next novel, _Enter Mrs. Belchamber_ (1951), told the story of a young man who needs to rely on the help of the "grim" Mrs. Belchamber.[18] _Spring Green_ (1953) was called by _The Observer_ an "unexpectedly good light romance of gentry, and Americans, love and mystery, in a remote English village."[19] The _Marshfield News-Herald_ called _Crystal Clear_ (1953), a book that "belongs in the category of English feminine comedy."[20] _Around the Rugged Rock_ (1954) is set in Andalusia and is a light comedic romance.[21] _Money to Burn_ (1955) was reviewed by Virginia Jones for the _Paducah Sun_, who said, "If you want to start the New Year off in a spirit of utter good humor, read "Money to Burn."[22] Jones later reviewed _The Lark Shall Sing_ (1955) and described it as a fun, easy read.[23] This novel was adapted for an episode of NBC Matinee Theater in 1956.[24] _Shadows on the Water_ (1957) is a murder mystery set in Lisbon.[25]

In 1960, her novel _The Yellow Brick Road_ was chosen by the American Library Association as an "Interesting Adult Book of 1960 for Young People."[26] _The Yellow Brick Road_ is a story that has both suspense and fantasy elements.[27] In 1961, she wrote _Six Impossible Things_ which centered on the Wayne family who had already been featured in other stories by her.[28] _The Corner Shop_ (1967) had "intriguing" reviews, according to Ann Matthews in the _Medina County Gazette_.[29] _The Baltimore Sun_ praised _The Corner Shop_ for its "brisk pace" and "crisp dialogue."[30] _The Golden Collar_ (1969) is another entertaining romantic story that _Kirkus Reviews_ calls a "proper treat."[31]

In _The Past Tense of Love_ (1970), a young woman is reunited with her long lost mother in France.[32] Marcia M. Baker in _The Cincinnati Enquirer_, wrote that _The Past Tense of Love_ was "Good for reading while under a hairdryer, or on the beach, or in a hammock."[33] Cadell's twenty-fifth novel, _The Friendly Air_, was published in 1971 and was set in Portugal.[34] A review in _The Daily News-Journal_ called _The Friendly Air_ an "engaging, fascinating, moving and romantically-mysterious" book.[35] _Home for the Wedding_ (1972) was reviewed by _The Morning Call_ who called it "formula fiction by a veteran author who specializes in love stories."[36] _Library Journal_ found the plot of _The Fledgling_ to be "implausible, but absorbing and entertaining."[37]

_Library Journal_ found _The Marrying Kind_ (1980) to be a "witty tale" set in both England and Paris.[38] _A Lion In the Way_ (1982) is set in India and was recommended for most library collections by _Library Journal_.[39] _Library Journal_ called _The Waiting Game_ (1985) a "deftly plotted story of misdirected love and unrealized relationships."[40]
