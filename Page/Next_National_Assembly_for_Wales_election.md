The NEXT NATIONAL ASSEMBLY FOR WALES ELECTION is due to be held on Thursday 6 May 2021[1] to elect 60 members to the Welsh Assembly. It would be the sixth general election since the assembly was established in 1999.

Six parties had AMs in the fifth Assembly: Welsh Labour led by First Minister Mark Drakeford, Welsh Conservatives led by Paul Davies, Plaid Cymru led by Adam Price, the Brexit Party led by Mark Reckless, UKIP Wales led by Gareth Bennett, and the Welsh Liberal Democrats led by Jane Dodds.


Electoral system

In elections for the National Assembly for Wales, each voter has two votes in the additional member system. The first vote is for a candidate to become the Assembly Member for the voter's constituency, elected by the first past the post system. The second vote is for a regional closed party list of candidates. Additional member seats are allocated from the lists by the D'Hondt method, with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation. The overall result is approximately proportional.

In accordance to the Wales Act 2014, a candidate is allowed to stand in both a constituency, as well as a regional list. However, holding a dual mandate with the House of Commons is illegal, meaning an Assembly Member cannot also be an MP.

The following, previously incumbent AMs, will not run for re-election:
