KENNETH MCFAUL (born 1948) is a politician from Northern Ireland.

McFaul was a member of the Protestant Unionist Party and a founder of their successor group the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).[1] He represented the party as a member of the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention for East Antrim and was a member of Carrickfergus Borough Council from 1973 to 1985, serving as Mayor from 1981 to 1983.[2] He was an unsuccessful candidate in the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly election.[3] He left the DUP in 1984 after missing out to Jim Allister in the race to be the party's general election candidate for East Antrim the previous year.[4]

McFaul would later return to politics with the Traditional Unionist Voice, and was a candidate for the party in the 2014 election to the newly established Mid and East Antrim District Council.[5] He was not elected to the body.[6]
