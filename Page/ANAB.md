ANSI NATIONAL ACCREDITATION BOARD (ANAB) accreditation and training services provider in the area of management systems[1], personnel and product certification bodies, laboratories, inspection bodies, forensic service providers, proficiency testing and reference material producers.

Accreditation is a form of attestation utilized to demonstrate competence by various types of organizations such as government departments, universities, manufacturers and other public and privately held organizations/ companies.[2][3]

ANAB is a signatory to the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC).[4] [5]


History

ANSI acquired full interests in the ANAB on December 28, 2018. Since 2005 ANAB had been owned equally by ANSI and ASQ; the purchase resulted in ANAB becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of ANSI, registered as a separate legal entity and renamed from ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board, LLC (ANAB) to the ANSI National Accreditation Board (ANAB). Currently, ANAB is headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with field offices in Alexandria, VA, Washington DC, Cary NC, and Fort Wayne, IN.[6] The organization is led by a Board of Directors, and an Accreditation Council made up of experts from various organizations and fields.[7]

In 2005, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the American Society for Quality (ASQ) jointly renamed "ANSI-RAB NAP" to "ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board" and that become the official name of the organization.[8]

ANSI National Accreditation Board (ANAB)'s formation dates back to 1990 when it started as the "Registrar Accreditation Board (RAB)".[9] In 1991, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and RAB reached an agreement to operate the American National Accreditation Program for Registrars of Quality Systems.[10][11] The American Society for Quality (ASQ) also liaised with RAB and ANSI leading to the formation of a new partnership known as "ANSI-RAB NAP".[12]

In 2015, ANAB was at the center of a suspension of DNA testing at the Washington, D.C., Department of Forensics lab because of errors in DNA analysis.[13][14] In 2016, ANAB merged operations with the Laboratory Accreditation Bureau (LAB) and the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors Lab Accreditation Board (ASCLD/LAB).[15] The same year, the North Carolina State Crime Lab used ANAB's expertise to address a backlog of more than 5,000 untested DNA test kits.[16]


Services

[18][19] The accreditation services provide confidence for customers in the systems and accuracy represented in the products and services they purchase.[20][21][22][23][24]

ANAB also works with industries in the healthcare, aerospace, forestry, and security segments.[25][26][27][28]

It equally conducts training courses related to the accreditation programs offered.[29][30]


Criticism

Some standards implementation consultants have been critical of ANAB accreditation services. They maintain that ANAB and other accreditation bodies are more interested in ensuring the ongoing market of certifications, irrespective of how well or how poorly the ISO 9001 standard is written.[31]
