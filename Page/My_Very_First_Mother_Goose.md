Reception

The _School Library Journal_ wrote "Such a spirit of fun and pleasure emanates from every page of this big, handsome volume that although there are many distinguished entries in the nursery-rhyme book field, this one is sure to add special joy to any collection."[1] _Kirkus Reviews_ concluded "There's little point in pretending that even prodigious collections of nursery rhymes can do without this one--it's a must."[2] and _Publishers Weekly_ in a star review called it an "exuberant anthology" and wrote " A collaboration that both freshens and preserves the past, this volume deserves a prominent place not just in the nursery room but on the shelves of all who treasure illustrated books."[3]

While discussing various Mother Goose books, _Horn Book_ called _My First Mother Goose_ a "lap-friendly charmer" and "a fine place to begin,"[4] Parents' Choice awarded it a 1996 Gold Award and stated "The rhythmical mixture makes a generous volume distinctive; it's simultaneously pungent, sweet and salty. Rosemary Wells' watercolors have uproarious good humor and unfailing tenderness."[5]
