Born in Huelva, Andalusia, Quiles had youth stints at Recreativo de Huelva and Celta de Vigo.[1] On 24 July 2014 he moved to Córdoba CF, being assigned to the reserves in Segunda División B.[2]

Quiles made his senior debut on 7 September 2014, coming on as a late substitute in a 1–0 home win against Granada CF B. The following 30 January, he was loaned to fellow league team Marbella FC until June.[3]

Returning from loan, Quiles scored a career-best 22 goals during the 2015–16 campaign, as his side achieved promotion from Tercera División. He made his professional debut on 20 November 2016, coming on as a late substitute for Alejandro Alfaro in a 1–1 away draw against CD Mirandés for the Segunda División championship.[4]

On 4 July 2017, Quiles was definitely promoted to the main squad ahead of the 2017–18 season.[5] On 1 August, however, he was loaned to third-tier club UCAM Murcia CF for one year.[6]

Quiles was recalled on 31 January 2018,[7] but appeared mainly for the B's during the remainder of the campaign. On 23 August, he moved to his first team Recreativo on a one-year loan deal.[8]
