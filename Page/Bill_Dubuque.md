BILL DUBUQUE is an American screenwriter known for such films as _The Accountant_,[1] _A Family Man_,[2] _The Judge_,[3] and the television series _Ozark_.[4] In 2017 he scripted an upcoming DC Extended Universe Nightwing film[5][6] and has been connected to an _Accountant_ sequel.[7][8]


Biography

Dubuque was born in St. Louis, Missouri, spending time working on the Lake of the Ozarks as a teen.[9][10] He still lives in St. Louis, with his wife and three children,[11] with whom he still frequently visits the Lake of the Ozarks.[12]

Before starting as a screenwriter in 2008, Dubuque worked as a recruitment headhunter.[13][14] He was approached by producer Mark Williams with the rough idea for _The Accountant_, which Dubuque developed into a script named to the 2011 Black List of the best unproduced screenplays in Hollywood,[15][16] including doing research to develop the protagonist (played by Ben Affleck) to have high-functioning autism;[17] the film was credited by Autism Speaks for its portrayal of the disorder.[18] The first screenplay of his to be produced, 2012's _The Judge_, led to Dubuque being recognized as one of _Variety_{{'}}s 10 screenwriters to watch[19] and named to the 2012 Black List with 20 mentions.[20][21]

In 2015, Dubuque successfully pitched an action-adventure called _The Real McCoy_ to Universal Pictures, with Chris Pratt attached to star;[22] the film is still in production.[23] Another collaboration with Mark Williams, _A Family Man_, was released in 2016;[24] with a working title of _The Headhunter's Calling_, the script was based on Dubuque's previous work in recruitment.[25] Dubuque's teenage experiences at an Ozarks resort[26] led him to work again with producer Mark Williams[27] and male lead Jason Bateman[28] on developing the series _Ozark_, which was released on Netflix in 2017 and quickly renewed for a second season,[29] as well as earning the writing team a Writers Guild of America Award nomination.[30]
