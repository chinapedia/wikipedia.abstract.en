LARS CHITTKA, FLS, FRES, FSB (born April 1963) is a German zoologist, ethologist and ecologist distinguished for his work on the evolution of sensory systems and cognition, using insect-flower interactions as a model.


Life and career

Born in Germany, Chittka studied Biology at the Georg-August-Universität Göttingen and the Free University of Berlin.[1][2] He obtained his PhD degree under the supervision of Randolf Menzel at the Free University of Berlin. Chittka is a recipient of the Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award[3] and an Advanced Fellowship from the European Research Council (ERC).[4] He is also an elected Fellow of the Linnean Society (FLS), the Royal Entomological Society (FRES) as well as the Royal Society of Biology (FSB).[5] He received the Lesley Goodman Award of the Royal Entomological Society in 2006.[6] Lars Chittka has been an Editor of Biology’s foremost open access journal PLoS Biology since 2004,[7] and has also been on the Editorial Board of Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B (2010-2012) and the Quarterly Review of Biology (2004-2010);[8] he is a member of the Faculty of 1000,[9] and was a Panel Chairman for the European Research Council (2010-2013).[10] He is also the founder of the Research Centre for Psychology at Queen Mary University of London,[11] where he is a Professor of Sensory and Behavioural Ecology.[12]


Research achievements

Chittka has carried out extensive work on the behaviour, cognition and ecology of bumblebees and honeybees, and their interactions with flowers.[13][14][15] He developed perceptual models of animal colour vision, allowing the derivation of optimal receiver systems as well as a quantification of the evolutionary pressures shaping flower signals. Chittka also made fundamental contributions to the understanding of animal cognition and its fitness benefits in the economy of nature. He explored phenomena such as numerosity, speed-accuracy trade-offs, false memories and social learning in bees.[16] His discoveries have made a substantial impact on the understanding of animal intelligence and its neural-computational underpinnings. He has published over 180 peer-reviewed articles,[17][18] many of them highly cited.[19]
