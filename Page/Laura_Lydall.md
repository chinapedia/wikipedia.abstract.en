Laura stated that she is passionate about supporting and raising awareness of domestic violence as several friends have had traumatic experiences.[5] Laura helped raise over $237,000 for the Be Positive Foundation which is a children’s cancer charity.

Television

Laura is an ambassador for Australian car servicing franchise Ultra Tune. She stars with fellow ambassador Parnia Porsche in several of their television adverts in Australia. The adverts caused huge controversy in Australia as they featured the girls in ‘unexpected situations’ which were deemed to be sexist by critics.[6][7] Their advert was the most complained about advert in Australia in 2016.[8]

Laura was interviewed by Neil Mitchell on 3AW and defended the adverts, stating that they were simply ‘a bit of fun’.[9] Both Laura Lydall and Parnia Porsche wrote an open letter to The Age newspaper in response to the controversy and stated that ‘We feel upset that you are publicly bullying and vilifying us on the basis of our appearance. It’s just plain wrong and unfair, Emma and Michael. Surely as independent strong women, we are allowed to choose without fear of prejudice or hurtful judgments about what we wear, how we look and the form of work we choose?’[10]

Laura featured in the series Cruise Mode on Network Ten in 2016, starring Charli Robinson and Shannon Noll.[11]

In October 2018 Laura filmed alongside Charlie Sheen for the 7th installment of the 'Unexpected Situations' ad series for Ultra Tune.[12]
