_THE CHOIR_ is an American dramedy web series created by Issa Rae[1] for the "faith and family focussed" YouTube channel "Alright TV".[2] The series, which premiered on YouTube on August 29, 2013, is "a comedic series about the personal, spiritual and often controversial dynamics of a revered church choir".[3][4]

The series follows the group of African-American choir members in the United Church of Holy Christ in Fellowship, whose declining congregation forces the group to try to come up with a plan to survive. In the course of the drama, romance, intrigue, and political dealings throughout the story, the series explores the everyday life and nuances of the black church, and the relatable human struggles and experiences of its members.[5] Evette Dione, writing for Bustle, counted _The Choir_ among the "5 Best Web Series for People of Color" in December 2013.[6]

In the first episode, the choir performs a gospel version of Janet Jackson's "Any Time, Any Place"; Jessie, the young lead singer, decides to "sex up" the performance, to the consternation of some of the congregation, other choir members, and the pastor.[7][8]
