JOE FOURNIER (born 23 January 1983) is an English entrepreneur. Fournier set up his own fitness business before selling to a FTSE100 company. He subsequently moved into the nightclub industry and then boxing.


Early life

Fournier was born in Hammersmith, London. He moved with his parents to Monaco where he spent a few formative years, before returning to Isleworth, London where he lived with his mother. Fournier attended Lycée Français Charles De Gaulle de Londres in Kensington then American Community School.

After his parents' divorce Fournier moved to Hounslow with his mother and attended Ashton House primary and then Isleworth & Syon School. When living with his mother Fournier "went from having a chauffeur driven car to school every day, to taking the bus."[1]

Fournier experienced racial tensions in London saying, “My whole life, everyone judged me. Growing up during one of the most racially tense times in London, people constantly attacked my family and me for being outsiders, for being poor and French-Italian. I never had the right clothes or the right shoes.[2]

Fournier studied human biology and sports science at St Mary's University. He now lives in Notting Hill, west London but spends half his year in Miami, Florida, USA.[3]


Basketball

At school Fournier took up basketball and was selected for the England Basketball team. He captained the national team 43 times and played in France, Italy and the Middle East.[4]


Business

After being forced to retire from basketball due to a scaphoid injury, Fournier set up his own gym where he acted as "a trainer, PR, and cleaner, all-in-one."[5]

Fournier grew the gym business and gained recognition as a personal trainer with a roster of celebrity clients.[6] Fournier wrote _Red Carpet Workout_ in 2008 of which he said:

_"Growing up, I was street-smart but got a D in English, so publishing a book made my mum and my family proud. I get royalties from it and got quite a bit up front too, about £30,000, which I split with my agent and the ghostwriter."_[7]

Fournier sold his fitness business and studios to a FTSE 100 company in 2012.[8] He made his money by owning the freehold to his gyms having moved into real estate almost by mistake. “It wasn’t the gyms that brought the fortune, it was that I held the Freehold leases to the properties," he explains. "I ended up selling all 14 locations to a FTSE 100 company and that was my first real kill.”[9]

Fournier invested in nightclubs, opening and owning Whisky Mist, The Rose Club, Bonbonniere London and Streaky Gin. Most recently he opened Bonbonniere Mikonos. Fournier invested in nightclubs stating, "It's really difficult to get people to do lunges and eat salad, but it was easy getting people get pissed, drink gin and tonic, party, and eat pizza."[10]

Fournier's businesses make around "£20-30million a year" and he is valued upwards of a hundred million pounds.[11]


Boxing

In 2015 Fournier took up boxing professionally.[12] He is signed to Hayemaker Promotions.[13] His record currently stands as won 8 lost 0 all by knockout.[14] He made his debut in the light heavyweight division against Jorge Burgos in the Dominican Republic. He defeated Manuel Regalado and Pedro Sencion before appearing on the undercard of David Haye-Arnold Gjergjaj on May 21, 2016 at the O2 Arena, London. Fournier defeated Bela Juhasz inside two rounds after Juhasz "was hurt by a right hand" before "folding under a barrage of punches."[15]

Fournier then fought in Belgium beating Mustapha Stini. Fournier, had "no real problems" defeating Stini.[16]

Fournier won the vacant WBA international light heavyweight belt by defeating Wilmer Mejia in the eighth round in the Dominican Republic. Fournier moved up to 11th in the rankings thanks to this victory against his first southpaw opponent. Fournier used the victory to reiterate his desire to fight fellow countryman Callum Smith saying, “I will buy him a jet plane or a house if he fights me!”[17]


The Duke

Fournier was paid £200,000 by friend Nick Gold to change his ring name from "The Bulldog" to "The Duke". The moniker came when Fournier split up with his girlfriend over her friendship with the Duke of Seville. Gold wanted Fournier to be called "The Duke" so that he'd get angry every time he stepped in the ring.


Personal life

Fournier went to school with Mo Farah and classes him as one of his closest friends.[18] Fournier has a network of celebrity friends and clients having acted as a personal trainer to many. He cites 50 Cent, Jamie Foxx, Adriana Lima, Lucas Podolski and Chipmunk as friends.[19]


Charity work

Fournier supports Caudwell Children and runs the Joe Fournier Foundation. The latter pays for coaching and after-school clubs in Hounslow.[20]
