History and profile

_Il Verri_ was started by Luciano Anceschi in Milan in 1956.[1][2][3] The magazine is published on a quarterly basis.[4] Its headquarters is in Milan.[5][6] However, in 1973 it temporarily moved to Bologna.[7]

In the early 1960s _Il Verri_ began to cover the writings of neo avant garde authors, including Umberto Eco, Edoardo Sanguineti, Antonio Porta and Nanni Balestrini.[8] They were part of a literary circle called Gruppo 63.[9] The magazine played a significant role for Umberto Eco in shaping his theories.[10] Luciano Erba and Alfredo Giuliani were also among the contributors.[11][12]

From its start in 1956 _Il Verri_ has been instrumental in making some approaches familiar in Italy such as phenomenology, structuralism and semiology.[13] The magazine also covers poems and in 1961 Luciano Anceschi collected them in a book.[14]
