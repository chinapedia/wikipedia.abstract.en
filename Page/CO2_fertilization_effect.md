The FERTILIZATION EFFECT or CARBON FERTILIZATION EFFECT is the increased rate of photosynthesis in plants that results from increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The effect varies depending on the plant species, the temperature, and the availability of water and nutrients.[1] However, enhanced rates of photosynthesis in plants due to fertilization are only partially transferred to enhanced plant growth and any hypothesized CO₂ fertilization response is unlikely to significantly reduce the human-made increases in atmospheric CO₂ concentration over the next century.[2]

From a quarter to half of Earth's vegetated lands has shown significant greening over the last 35 years largely due to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.[3]

One related trend may be what has been termed "Arctic greening". Scientists have found that as northern portions of the planet warm up and total atmospheric carbon dioxide increases, there has been an increase in plant growth in these regions.[4]

Studies led by Trevor Keenan from the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) show that, from 2002 to 2014, plants appear to have gone into overdrive, starting to pull more carbon dioxide out of the air than they have done before. The result was that the rate at which carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere did not increase during this time period, although previously, it had grown considerably in concert with growing greenhouse gas emissions. Keenan concluded “Unfortunately, this increase is nowhere near enough to stop climate change.”[5]


Decreases in minerals and impacts on human nutrition

Empirical evidence shows that increasing levels of result in lower concentrations of many minerals in plants tissues. Doubling levels results in an 8% decline, on average, in the concentration of minerals.[6] Declines in magnesium, calcium, potassium, iron, zinc and other minerals in crops can worsen the quality of human nutrition. Researchers report that the levels expected in the second half of this century will likely reduce the levels of zinc, iron, and protein in wheat, rice, peas, and soybeans. Some two billion people live in countries where citizens receive more than 60 percent of their zinc or iron from these types of crops. Deficiencies of these nutrients already cause an estimated loss of 63 million life-years annually.[7][8]
