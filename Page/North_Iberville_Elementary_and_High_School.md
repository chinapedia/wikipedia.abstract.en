NORTH IBERVILLE ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOL was a K-12 school in Rosedale, Louisiana. It was a part of the Iberville Parish School Board. North Iberville Elementary School remains in operation.

North Iberville High School closed in 2009 despite a parental movement to keep the school open. Students were rezoned to Plaquemine High School. Parents and Rosedale community members sued the parish to try to keep the school open. In 2015 Rosedale community members made plans to start C.S. King College Preparatory Academy, a grade 7-12 charter school.[1]
