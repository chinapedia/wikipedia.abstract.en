MONTY PYTHON (also collectively known as the PYTHONS)[1][2] are a British surreal comedy group who created the sketch comedy television show _Monty Python's Flying Circus_, which first aired on the BBC in 1969. Forty-five episodes were made over four series. The Python phenomenon developed from the television series into something larger in scope and impact, including touring stage shows, films, numerous albums, several books, and musicals. The Pythons' influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles' influence on music.[3][4][5] Regarded as enduring icons of 1970s pop culture, their sketch show has been referred to as being “an important moment in the evolution of television comedy".[6]

Broadcast by the BBC between 1969 and 1974, _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ was conceived, written, and performed by its members Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin. Loosely structured as a sketch show, but with an innovative stream-of-consciousness approach, aided by Gilliam's animation, it pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in style and content.[7][8] A self-contained comedy team responsible for both writing and performing their work, the Pythons had creative control which allowed them to experiment with form and content, discarding rules of television comedy. Following their television work, they began making films, which include _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ (1975), _Life of Brian_ (1979) and _The Meaning of Life_ (1983). Their influence on British comedy has been apparent for years, while in North America, it has coloured the work of cult performers from the early editions of _Saturday Night Live_ through to more recent absurdist trends in television comedy. "Pythonesque" has entered the English lexicon as a result.

In a 2005 poll of over 300 comics, comedy writers, producers and directors throughout the English-speaking world to find "The Comedian's Comedian", three of the six Pythons members were voted to be among the top 50 greatest comedians ever: Cleese at No. 2, Idle at No. 21, and Palin at No. 30.[9][10]


Before _Flying Circus_

Jones and Palin met at Oxford University, where they performed together with the Oxford Revue. Chapman and Cleese met at Cambridge University. Idle was also at Cambridge, but started a year after Chapman and Cleese. Cleese met Gilliam in New York City while on tour with the Cambridge University Footlights revue _Cambridge Circus_ (originally entitled _A Clump of Plinths_). Chapman, Cleese, and Idle were members of the Footlights, which at that time also included the future _Goodies_ (Tim Brooke-Taylor, Bill Oddie, and Graeme Garden), and Jonathan Lynn (co-writer of _Yes Minister_ and _Yes, Prime Minister_).[11] During Idle's presidency of the club, feminist writer Germaine Greer and broadcaster Clive James were members. Recordings of Footlights' revues (called "Smokers") at Pembroke College include sketches and performances by Cleese and Idle, which, along with tapes of Idle's performances in some of the drama society's theatrical productions, are kept in the archives of the Pembroke Players.[12]

The six Python members appeared in or wrote these shows before _Flying Circus_:

-   _I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again_ (radio) (1964–1973) [Cleese: cast member and writer] – [Idle and Chapman: writers]
-   _The Frost Report_ (1966–1967) [Cleese: cast member and writer] – [Idle: writer of Frost's monologues] – [Chapman, Palin and Jones: writers]
-   _At Last the 1948 Show_ (1967) [Chapman and Cleese: writers and cast members] – [Idle: guest star and writer]
-   _Twice a Fortnight_ (1967) [Palin and Jones: cast members and writers]
-   _Do Not Adjust Your Set_ (1967–1969) [Idle, Jones, and Palin: cast members and writers] – [Gilliam: animation]
    + Bonzo Dog Band: musical interludes
-   _We Have Ways of Making You Laugh_ (1968) [Idle: cast member and writer] – [Gilliam: animation]
-   _How to Irritate People_ (1968) [Cleese and Chapman: cast members & writers] – [Palin: cast member]
-   _The Complete and Utter History of Britain_ (1969) [Palin and Jones: cast members and writers]
-   _Doctor in the House_ (1969) [Cleese and Chapman: writers]

The BBC’s satirical television show, _The Frost Report_, broadcast from March 1966 to December 1967, is credited as first uniting the British Pythons and providing an environment in which they could develop their particular styles.[13]

Following the success of _Do Not Adjust Your Set_, broadcast on ITV in the UK from December 1967 to May 1969, Thames Television offered Gilliam, Idle, Jones, and Palin their own late-night adult comedy series together. At the same time, Chapman and Cleese were offered a show by the BBC, which had been impressed by their work on _The Frost Report_ and _At Last the 1948 Show_. Cleese was reluctant to do a two-man show for various reasons, including Chapman's supposedly difficult and erratic personality. Cleese had fond memories of working with Palin on _How to Irritate People_ and invited him to join the team. With no studio available at Thames until summer 1970 for the late-night show, Palin agreed to join Cleese and Chapman, and suggested the involvement of his writing partner Jones and colleague Idle—who in turn wanted Gilliam to provide animations for the projected series. Much has been made of the fact that the Monty Python troupe is the result of Cleese's desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.[14]

By contrast, according to John Cleese's autobiography, the origins of _Monty Python_ lay in the admiration that writing partners Cleese and Chapman had for the new type of comedy being done on _Do Not Adjust Your Set_; as a result, a meeting was initiated by Cleese between Chapman, Idle, Jones, Palin, and himself at which it was agreed to pool their writing and performing efforts and jointly seek production sponsorship.[15] According to their official website, the group was born from a Kashmir tandoori restaurant in Hampstead in 1969.[16]


_Monty Python's Flying Circus_

Development of the series

The Pythons had a definite idea about what they wanted to do with the series. They were admirers of the work of Peter Cook, Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller, and Dudley Moore on _Beyond the Fringe_, and had worked on _Frost_, which was similar in style.[17] They enjoyed Cook and Moore's sketch show _Not Only... But Also_. One problem the Pythons perceived with these programmes was that though the body of the sketch would be strong, the writers would often struggle to then find a punchline funny enough to end on, and this would detract from the overall sketch quality. They decided that they would simply not bother to "cap" their sketches in the traditional manner, and early episodes of the _Flying Circus_ series make great play of this abandonment of the punchline (one scene has Cleese turn to Idle, as the sketch descends into chaos, and remark that "This is the silliest sketch I've ever been in"—they all resolve not to carry on and simply walk off the set).[18] However, as they began assembling material for the show, the Pythons watched one of their collective heroes, Spike Milligan, recording his groundbreaking series _Q5_ (1969). Not only was the programme more irreverent and anarchic than any previous television comedy, but Milligan also would often "give up" on sketches halfway through and wander off set (often muttering "Did I write this?"). It was clear that their new series would now seem less original, and Jones in particular became determined the Pythons should innovate.

After much debate, Jones remembered an animation Gilliam had created for _Do Not Adjust Your Set_ called "Beware of the Elephants", which had intrigued him with its stream-of-consciousness style. Jones felt it would be a good concept to apply to the series: allowing sketches to blend into one another. Palin had been equally fascinated by another of Gilliam's efforts, entitled "Christmas Cards", and agreed that it represented "a way of doing things differently". Since Cleese, Chapman, and Idle were less concerned with the overall flow of the programme, Jones, Palin, and Gilliam became largely responsible for the presentation style of the _Flying Circus_ series, in which disparate sketches are linked to give each episode the appearance of a single stream-of-consciousness (often using a Gilliam animation to move from the closing image of one sketch to the opening scene of another).

Writing started at 9 am and finished at 5 pm. Typically, Cleese and Chapman worked as one pair isolated from the others, as did Jones and Palin, while Idle wrote alone. After a few days, they would join together with Gilliam, critique their scripts, and exchange ideas. Their approach to writing was democratic. If the majority found an idea humorous, it was included in the show. The casting of roles for the sketches was a similarly unselfish process, since each member viewed himself primarily as a "writer", rather than an actor eager for screen time. When the themes for sketches were chosen, Gilliam had a free hand in bridging them with animations, using a camera, scissors, and airbrush.

While the show was a collaborative process, different factions within Python were responsible for elements of the team's humour. In general, the work of the Oxford-educated members (Jones and Palin) was more visual, and more fanciful conceptually (e.g., the arrival of the Spanish Inquisition in a suburban front room), while the Cambridge graduates' sketches tended to be more verbal and more aggressive (for example, Cleese and Chapman's many "confrontation" sketches, where one character intimidates or hurls abuse, or Idle's characters with bizarre verbal quirks, such as "The Man Who Speaks In Anagrams"). Cleese confirmed that "most of the sketches with heavy abuse were Graham's and mine, anything that started with a slow pan across countryside and impressive music was Mike and Terry's, and anything that got utterly involved with words and disappeared up any personal orifice was Eric's".[19] Gilliam's animations, meanwhile, ranged from the whimsical to the savage (the cartoon format allowing him to create some astonishingly violent scenes without fear of censorship).

Several names for the show were considered before _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ was settled upon. Some were _Owl Stretching Time_, _The Toad Elevating Moment_, _A Horse, a Spoon and a Bucket_, _Vaseline Review_, and _Bun, Wackett, Buzzard, Stubble and Boot_. _Flying Circus_ stuck when the BBC explained it had printed that name in its schedules and was not prepared to amend it. Many variations on the name in front of this title then came and went (popular legend holds that the BBC considered _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ to be a ridiculous name, at which point the group threatened to change their name every week until the BBC relented). _Gwen Dibley's Flying Circus_ was named after a woman Palin had read about in the newspaper, thinking it would be amusing if she were to discover she had her own TV show. _Baron Von Took's Flying Circus_ was considered as an affectionate tribute to Barry Took, the man who had brought them together. _Arthur Megapode's Flying Circus_ was suggested, then discarded. The name _Baron Von Took's Flying Circus_ had the form of _Baron Manfred von Richthofen's Flying Circus_ of WWI fame, and the new group was forming in a time when the Royal Guardsmen's 1966 song "Snoopy vs. the Red Baron" had peaked. The term 'flying circus' was also another name for the popular entertainment of the 1920s known as barnstorming, where multiple performers collaborated with their stunts to perform a combined set of acts.

Differing, somewhat confusing accounts are given of the origins of the Python name, although the members agree that its only "significance" was that they thought it sounded funny. In the 1998 documentary _Live at Aspen_ during the US Comedy Arts Festival, where the troupe was awarded the AFI Star Award by the American Film Institute, the group implied that "Monty" was selected (Eric Idle's idea) as a gently mocking tribute to Field Marshal Lord Montgomery, a legendary British general of World War II; requiring a "slippery-sounding" surname, they settled on "Python". On other occasions, Idle has claimed that the name "Monty" was that of a popular and rotund fellow who drank in his local pub; people would often walk in and ask the barman, "Has Monty been in yet?", forcing the name to become stuck in his mind. The name Monty Python was later described by the BBC as being "envisaged by the team as the perfect name for a sleazy entertainment agent".[20]

Style of the show

_Flying Circus_ popularised innovative formal techniques, such as the cold open, in which an episode began without the traditional opening titles or announcements.[21] An example of this is the "It's" man: Palin, outfitted in Robinson Crusoe garb, making a tortuous journey across various terrains, before finally approaching the camera to state, "It's ...", only to be then cut off by the title sequence and theme music. On several occasions, the cold open lasted until mid-show, after which the regular opening titles ran. Occasionally, the Pythons tricked viewers by rolling the closing credits halfway through the show, usually continuing the joke by fading to the familiar globe logo used for BBC continuity, over which Cleese would parody the clipped tones of a BBC announcer. On one occasion, the credits ran directly after the opening titles.

Because of their dislike of finishing with punchlines, they experimented with ending the sketches by cutting abruptly to another scene or animation, walking offstage, addressing the camera (breaking the fourth wall), or introducing a totally unrelated event or character. A classic example of this approach was the use of Chapman's "anti-silliness" character of "the Colonel", who walked into several sketches and ordered them to be stopped because things were becoming "far too silly".

Another favourite way of ending sketches was to drop a cartoonish "16-ton weight" prop on one of the characters when the sketch seemed to be losing momentum, or a knight in full armour (played by Terry Gilliam) would wander on-set and hit characters over the head with a rubber chicken,[22] before cutting to the next scene. Yet another way of changing scenes was when John Cleese, usually outfitted in a dinner suit, would come in as a radio commentator and, in a rather pompous manner, make the formal and determined announcement "And now for something completely different.", which later became the title of the first Monty Python film.

The Python theme music is the Band of the Grenadier Guards' rendition of John Philip Sousa's "The Liberty Bell" which was first published in 1893.[23] Under the Berne Convention's "country of origin" concept, the composition was subject to United States copyright law which states that any work first published prior to 1923 was in the public domain due to copyright expiration.[24] This enabled Gilliam to co-opt the march for the series without having to make any royalty payments.[25]

The use of Gilliam's surreal, collage stop motion animations was another innovative intertextual element of the Python style. Many of the images Gilliam used were lifted from famous works of art, and from Victorian illustrations and engravings. The giant foot which crushes the show's title at the end of the opening credits is in fact the foot of Cupid, cut from a reproduction of the Renaissance masterpiece _Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time_ by Bronzino. This foot, and Gilliam's style in general, are visual trademarks of the programme.

The Pythons used the British tradition of cross-dressing comedy by donning frocks and makeup and playing female roles themselves while speaking in falsetto.[26] Jones specialised in playing the working-class housewife, with Palin and Idle in being generally more posh. The other members played female roles more sparsely. Generally speaking, female roles were played by women only when the scene specifically required that the character be sexually attractive (although sometimes they used Idle for this). The troupe later turned to Carol Cleveland, who co-starred in numerous episodes after 1970. In some episodes, and later in _Monty Python's Life of Brian_, they took the idea one step further by playing women who impersonated men (in the stoning scene).

Many sketches are well-known and widely quoted. "Dead Parrot sketch", "The Lumberjack Song", "Spam" (which led to the coining of the term email spam),[27] "Nudge Nudge", "The Spanish Inquisition", "Upper Class Twit of the Year", "Cheese Shop", and "The Ministry of Silly Walks" are just a few examples.

Introduction to North America and the World

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) added _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ to its national September 1970 fall line-up.[28] They aired the 13 episodes of series 1, which had first run on the BBC the previous autumn (October 1969 to January 1970), as well as the first six episodes of series 2 only a few weeks after they first appeared on the BBC (September to November 1970).[29] The CBC dropped the show when it returned to regular programming after the Christmas 1970 break, choosing to not place the remaining seven episodes of series 2 on the January 1971 CBC schedule.[30] Within a week, the CBC received hundreds of calls complaining of the cancellation, and more than 100 people staged a demonstration at the CBC's Montreal studios. The show eventually returned, becoming a fixture on the network during the first half of the 1970s.[31]

Time-Life Films had the rights to distribute all BBC-TV programmes in the United States; however, they decided that British comedy simply would not work in America, so it would not be worth the investment to convert the Python episodes from the European PAL standard to the American NTSC standard.

Sketches from _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ were introduced to American audiences in August 1972, with the release of the Python film _And Now for Something Completely Different_, featuring sketches from series 1 and 2 of the television show. This 1972 release met limited box office success.

In the summer of 1974, Ron Devillier, the programme director for nonprofit PBS television station KERA in Dallas, Texas, started airing episodes of _Monty Python's Flying Circus_. Ratings shot through the roof, providing an encouraging sign to the other 100 PBS stations that had signed up to begin airing the show in October 1974—exactly five years after their BBC debut. There was also cross-promotion from FM radio stations across the country, whose airing of tracks from the Python LPs had already introduced American audiences to this bizarre brand of comedy. The popularity on PBS resulted in the 1974 re-release of the 1972 _...Completely Different_ film, with much greater box office success.

The ability to show _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ under the American NTSC standard had been made possible by the commercial actions of American television producer Greg Garrison. Garrison produced the NBC series _The Dean Martin Comedy World_, which ran during the summer of 1974. The concept was to show clips from comedy shows produced in other countries, including tape of the Python sketches "Bicycle Repairman" and "The Dull Life of a Stockbroker". Payment for use of these two sketches was enough to allow Time-Life Films to convert the entire Python library to NTSC standard, allowing for the sale to the PBS network stations which then brought the entire show to US audiences.

In 1975, ABC broadcast two 90-minute _Monty Python_ specials, each with three shows, but cut out a total of 24 minutes from each, in part to make time for commercials, and in part to avoid upsetting their audience. As the judge observed in _Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc._, where Monty Python sued for damages caused by broadcast of the mutilated version, "According to the network, appellants should have anticipated that most of the excised material contained scatological references inappropriate for American television and that these scenes would be replaced with commercials, which presumably are more palatable to the American public." Monty Python won the case.[32]

With the popularity of Python throughout the rest of the 1970s and through most of the 1980s, PBS stations looked at other British comedies, leading to UK shows such as _Are You Being Served?_ gaining a US audience, and leading, over time, to many PBS stations having a "British Comedy Night" which airs many popular UK comedies.[33]

In 1976 _Monty Python_ became the top rated show in Japan. The literal translation of the Japanese title was _The Gay Dragon Boys Show_,[34]

Cleese departs; the circus closes

Having considered the possibility at the end of the second season, Cleese left the _Flying Circus_ at the end of the third. He later explained that he felt he no longer had anything fresh to offer the show, and claimed that only two Cleese- and Chapman-penned sketches in the third series ("Dennis Moore" and the "Cheese Shop") were truly original, and that the others were bits and pieces from previous work cobbled together in slightly different contexts.[35] He was also finding Chapman, who was at that point in the full throes of alcoholism, difficult to work with. According to an interview with Idle, "It was on an Air Canada flight on the way to Toronto, when John (Cleese) turned to all of us and said 'I want out.' Why? I don't know. He gets bored more easily than the rest of us. He's a difficult man, not easy to be friendly with. He's so funny because he never wanted to be liked. That gives him a certain fascinating, arrogant freedom."[36] Jones noted his reticence in 2012, "He was good at it, when he did it he was professional, but he’d rather not have done it. The others all loved it, but he got more and more pissed off about having to come out and do filming, and the one that really swung it, in my view, was when we had to do the day on the Newhaven lifeboat."[37]

The rest of the group carried on for one more "half" season before calling a halt to the programme in 1974. The name _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ appears in the opening animation for season four, but in the end credits, the show is listed as simply "Monty Python". Although Cleese left the show, he was credited as a writer for three of the six episodes, largely concentrated in the "Michael Ellis" episode, which had begun life as one of the many drafts of the "Holy Grail" motion picture. When a new direction for "Grail" was decided upon, the subplot of Arthur and his knights wandering around a strange department store in modern times was lifted out and recycled as the aforementioned TV episode. Songwriter Neil Innes contributed to some sketches, including "Appeal on Behalf of Very Rich People".[38]

While the first three seasons contained 13 episodes each, the fourth ended after just six. Extremely keen to keep the now massively popular show going, the BBC had offered the troupe a full 13 episodes, but the truncated troupe (now under the unspoken 'leadership' of Terry Jones) had come to a common agreement while writing the fourth series that there was only enough material, and more importantly only enough enthusiasm, to shoot the six that were made.


Life beyond the _Flying Circus_

Filmography

_And Now for Something Completely Different_ (1971)

The Pythons' first feature film was directed by Ian MacNaughton, reprising his role from the television series. It consisted of sketches from the first two seasons of the _Flying Circus_, reshot on a low budget (and often slightly edited) for cinema release. Material selected for the film includes: "Dead Parrot", "The Lumberjack Song", "Upper Class Twit of the Year", "Hell's Grannies" , "Self-Defence Class", "How Not to Be Seen", and "Nudge Nudge". Financed by _Playboy_{{'}}s UK executive Victor Lownes, it was intended as a way of breaking Monty Python into America, and although it was ultimately unsuccessful in this, the film did good business in the UK, this being in the era before home video would make the original material much more accessible. The group did not consider the film a success.

_Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ (1975)

In 1974, between production on the third and fourth seasons, the group decided to embark on their first "proper" feature film, containing entirely new material. _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ was based on Arthurian legend and was directed by Jones and Gilliam. Again, the latter also contributed linking animations (and put together the opening credits). Along with the rest of the Pythons, Jones and Gilliam performed several roles in the film, but Chapman took the lead as King Arthur. Cleese returned to the group for the film, feeling that they were once again breaking new ground. _Holy Grail_ was filmed on location, in picturesque rural areas of Scotland, with a budget of only £229,000; the money was raised in part with investments from rock groups such as Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, and Led Zeppelin—and UK music industry entrepreneur Tony Stratton-Smith (founder and owner of the Charisma Records label, for which the Pythons recorded their comedy albums).[39]

The backers of the film wanted to cut the famous Black Knight scene (in which the Black Knight loses his limbs in a duel), but it was eventually kept in the movie.[40]

_Monty Python's Life of Brian_ (1979)

Following the success of _Holy Grail_, reporters asked for the title of the next Python film, despite the fact that the team had not even begun to consider a third one. Eventually, Idle flippantly replied "Jesus Christ – Lust for Glory", which became the group's stock answer once they realised that it shut reporters up. However, they soon began to seriously consider a film lampooning the New Testament era in the same way _Holy Grail_ had lampooned Arthurian legend. Despite them all sharing a distrust of organised religion, they agreed not to mock Jesus or his teachings directly. They also mentioned that they could not think of anything legitimate to make fun of about him. Instead, they decided to write a satire on credulity and hypocrisy among the followers of someone who had been mistaken for the "Messiah", but who had no desire to be followed as such. Chapman was cast in the lead role of Brian.

The focus therefore shifted to a separate individual born at the same time, in a neighbouring stable. When Jesus appears in the film (first, as a baby in the stable, and then later on the Mount, speaking the Beatitudes), he is played straight (by actor Kenneth Colley) and portrayed with respect. The comedy begins when members of the crowd mishear his statements of peace, love, and tolerance ("I think he said, 'Blessed are the cheesemakers{{'"}}).

Directing duties were handled solely by Jones, having amicably agreed with Gilliam that Jones' approach to film-making was better suited for Python's general performing style. _Holy Grail's_ production had often been stilted by their differences behind the camera. Gilliam again contributed two animated sequences (one being the opening credits) and took charge of set design. The film was shot on location in Tunisia, the finances being provided this time by former Beatle George Harrison, who together with Denis O'Brien formed the production company Hand-Made Films for the movie.[41] Harrison had a cameo role as the "owner of the Mount".[42]

Despite its subject matter attracting controversy, particularly upon its initial release, it has (together with its predecessor) been ranked among the greatest comedy films. A Channel 4 poll in 2005 ranked _Holy Grail_ in sixth place, with _Life of Brian_ at the top.[43]

_Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl_ (1982)

Filmed at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles during preparations for _The Meaning of Life_, this was a concert film (directed by Terry Hughes) in which the Pythons performed sketches from the television series in front of an audience. The released film also incorporated footage from the German television specials (the inclusion of which gives Ian MacNaughton his first on-screen credit for Python since the end of _Flying Circus_) and live performances of several songs from the troupe's then-current _Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album_.

_Monty Python's The Meaning of Life_ (1983)

The Pythons' final film returned to something structurally closer to the style of _Flying Circus_. A series of sketches loosely follows the ages of man from birth to death. Directed again by Jones solo, _The Meaning of Life_ is embellished with some of the group's most bizarre and disturbing moments, as well as various elaborate musical numbers. The film is by far their darkest work, containing a great deal of black humour, garnished by some spectacular violence (including an operation to remove a liver from a living patient without anaesthetic and the morbidly obese Mr. Creosote exploding over several restaurant patrons). At the time of its release, the Pythons confessed their aim was to offend "absolutely everyone".

Besides the opening credits and the fish sequence, Gilliam, by now an established live-action director, no longer wanted to produce any linking cartoons, offering instead to direct one sketch, "The Crimson Permanent Assurance". Under his helm, though, the segment grew so ambitious and tangential that it was cut from the movie and used as a supporting feature in its own right. (Television screenings also use it as a prologue.) This was the last project on which all six Pythons collaborated, except for the 1989 compilation _Parrot Sketch Not Included,_ where they are all seen sitting in a closet for four seconds. This was the last time Chapman appeared on screen with the Pythons.

_Secret Policeman's Ball_ benefit shows

Members of Python contributed their services to charitable endeavours and causes—sometimes as an ensemble, at other times as individuals. The cause that has been the most frequent and consistent beneficiary has been the human rights work of Amnesty International. Between 1976 and 1981, the troupe or its members appeared in four major fund-raisers for Amnesty—known collectively as the _Secret Policeman's Ball_ shows—which were turned into multiple films, TV shows, videos, record albums, and books. These benefit shows and their many spin-offs raised considerable sums of money for Amnesty, raised public and media awareness of the human rights cause, and influenced many other members of the entertainment community (especially rock musicians) to become involved in political and social issues.[44] Among the many musicians who have publicly attributed their activism—and the organisation of their own benefit events—to the inspiration of the work in this field of Monty Python are U2, Bob Geldof, Pete Townshend, and Sting.[45] The shows are credited by Amnesty with helping the organisation develop public awareness in the US, where one of the spin-off films was a major success.

Cleese and Jones had an involvement (as performer, writer or director) in all four Amnesty benefit shows, Palin in three, Chapman in two, and Gilliam in one. Idle did not participate in the Amnesty shows. Notwithstanding Idle's lack of participation, the other five members (together with "Associate Pythons" Carol Cleveland and Neil Innes) all appeared together in the first _Secret Policeman's Ball_ benefit—the 1976 _A Poke in the Eye_—where they performed several Python sketches. In this first show, they were collectively billed as _Monty Python_. (Peter Cook deputised for the errant Idle in a courtroom sketch.) In the next three shows, the participating Python members performed many Python sketches, but were billed under their individual names rather than under the collective Python banner. After a six-year break, Amnesty resumed producing _Secret Policeman's Ball_ benefit shows in 1987 (sometimes with, and sometimes without, variants of the iconic title) and by 2006 had presented a total of 12 such shows. The shows since 1987 have featured newer generations of British comedic performers, including many who have attributed their participation in the show to their desire to emulate the Python's pioneering work for Amnesty. (Cleese and Palin made a brief cameo appearance in the 1989 Amnesty show; apart from that, the Pythons have not appeared in shows after the first four.)

Going solo

at Neal's Yard, London. In 1976 Palin and Gilliam bought offices here as studios and editing suites for Python films and solo projects.]] Each member has pursued various film, television, and stage projects since the break-up of the group, but often continued to work with one another. Many of these collaborations were very successful, most notably _A Fish Called Wanda_ (1988), written by Cleese, in which he starred along with Palin. The pair also appeared in _Time Bandits_ (1981), a film directed by Gilliam, who wrote it together with Palin. Gilliam directed _Jabberwocky_ (1977), and also directed and co-wrote _Brazil_ (1985), which featured Palin, and _The Adventures of Baron Munchausen_ (1988), which featured Idle. _Yellowbeard_ (1983) was co-written by Chapman and featured Chapman, Idle, and Cleese, as well as many other English comedians including Peter Cook, Spike Milligan, and Marty Feldman.

Palin and Jones wrote the comedic TV series _Ripping Yarns_ (1976–79), starring Palin. Jones also appeared in the pilot episode and Cleese appeared in a nonspeaking part in the episode "Golden Gordon". Jones' film _Erik the Viking_ also has Cleese playing a small part.

In 1996, Terry Jones wrote and directed an adaptation of Kenneth Grahame's novel _The Wind in the Willows_. It featured four members of Monty Python: Jones as Mr. Toad, Idle as Ratty, Cleese as Mr. Toad's lawyer, and Palin as the Sun. Gilliam was considered for the voice of the river.

In terms of numbers of productions, Cleese has the most prolific solo career, having appeared in dozens of films, several TV shows or series (including _Cheers_, _3rd Rock from the Sun_, Q's assistant in the James Bond movies, and _Will & Grace_), many direct-to-video productions, some video games, and a number of commercials.[46] His BBC sitcom _Fawlty Towers_ (written by and starring Cleese together with his then-wife Connie Booth) is the only comedy series to rank higher than the _Flying Circus_ on the BFI TV 100's list, topping the whole poll.

Idle enjoyed critical success with _Rutland Weekend Television_ in the mid-1970s, out of which came the Beatles parody the Rutles (responsible for the cult mockumentary _All You Need Is Cash_), and as an actor in _Nuns on the Run_ (1990) with Robbie Coltrane. In 1976, Idle directed music videos for George Harrison songs "This Song" and "Crackerbox Palace", the latter of which also featured cameo appearances from Neil Innes and John Cleese. Idle has had success with Python songs: "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life" went to no. 3 in the UK singles chart in 1991. The song had been revived by Simon Mayo on BBC Radio 1, and was consequently released as a single that year. The theatrical phenomenon of the Python musical _Spamalot_ has made Idle the most financially successful of the troupe after Python. Written by Idle (and featuring a pre-recorded cameo of Cleese as the voice of God), it has proved to be an enormous hit on Broadway, London's West End, and Las Vegas.[47] This was followed by _Not the Messiah_, which repurposes _The Life of Brian_ as an oratorio. For the work's 2007 premiere at the Luminato festival in Toronto (which commissioned the work), Idle himself sang the "baritone-ish" part.

After _Python_ reunions

Since _The Meaning of Life_, their last project as a team, the Pythons have often been the subject of reunion rumours.[48] The final reunion of all six members occurred during the _Parrot Sketch Not Included – 20 Years of Monty Python_ special. The death of Chapman in 1989 (on the eve of their 20th anniversary) put an end to the speculation of any further reunions. Several occasions since 1989 have occurred when the surviving five members have gathered together for appearances—albeit not formal reunions. In 1996, Jones, Idle, Cleese, and Palin were featured in a film adaptation of _The Wind in the Willows_, which was later renamed _Mr. Toad's Wild Ride_.

In 1998 during the US Comedy Arts Festival, where the troupe was awarded the AFI Star Award by the American Film Institute, the five remaining members, along with what was purported to be Chapman's ashes, were reunited on stage for the first time in 18 years.[49] The occasion was in the form of an interview called _Monty Python Live at Aspen_, (hosted by Robert Klein, with an appearance by Eddie Izzard) in which the team looked back at some of their work and performed a few new sketches. On 9 October 1999, to commemorate 30 years since the first _Flying Circus_ television broadcast, BBC2 devoted an evening to Python programmes, including a documentary charting the history of the team, interspersed with new sketches by the Monty Python team filmed especially for the event. The program appears, with a few omissions, on the DVD _The Life of Python_. Idle's involvement in the special is limited, yet the final sketch marks the only time since 1989 that all surviving members of the troupe appear in one sketch, albeit not in the same room.

The surviving Pythons had agreed in principle to perform a live tour of America in 1999. Several shows were to be linked with Q&A meetings in various cities. Although all had said yes, Palin later changed his mind, much to the annoyance of Idle, who had begun work organising the tour. This led to Idle refusing to take part in the new material shot for the BBC anniversary evening. In 2002, four of the surviving members, bar Cleese, performed "The Lumberjack Song" and "Sit on My Face" for George Harrison's memorial concert. The reunion also included regular supporting contributors Neil Innes and Carol Cleveland, with a special appearance from Tom Hanks.

In an interview to publicise the DVD release of _The Meaning of Life_, Cleese said a further reunion was unlikely. "It is absolutely impossible to get even a majority of us together in a room, and I'm not joking," Cleese said. He said that the problem was one of busyness rather than one of bad feelings.[50] A sketch appears on the same DVD spoofing the impossibility of a full reunion, bringing the members "together" in a deliberately unconvincing fashion with modern bluescreen/greenscreen techniques.

Idle has responded to queries about a Python reunion by adapting a line used by George Harrison in response to queries about a possible Beatles reunion. When asked in November 1989 about such a possibility, Harrison responded: "As far as I'm concerned, there won't be a Beatles reunion as long as John Lennon remains dead."[51] Idle's version of this was that he expected to see a proper Python reunion, "just as soon as Graham Chapman comes back from the dead", but added, "we're talking to his agent about terms."[52]

_The Pythons Autobiography by the Pythons_ (2003), compiled from interviews with the surviving members, reveals that a series of disputes in 1998, over a possible sequel to _Holy Grail_ that had been conceived by Idle, may have resulted in the group's permanent split. Cleese's feeling was that _The Meaning of Life_ had been personally difficult and ultimately mediocre, and did not wish to be involved in another Python project for a variety of reasons (not least amongst them was the absence of Chapman, whose straight man-like central roles in the _Grail_ and _Brian_ films had been considered to be an essential anchoring performance). Apparently, Idle was angry with Cleese for refusing to do the film, which most of the remaining Pythons thought reasonably promising (the basic plot would have taken on a self-referential tone, featuring them in their main 'knight' guises from _Holy Grail_, mulling over the possibilities of reforming their posse). The book also reveals that a secondary option around this point was the possibility of revitalising the Python brand with a new stage tour, perhaps with the promise of new material. This idea had also met with Cleese's refusal, this time with the backing of other members.

March 2005 had a full, if nonperforming, reunion of the surviving cast members at the premiere of Idle's musical _Spamalot_, based on _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_. It opened in Chicago and has since played in New York on Broadway, London, and numerous other major cities across the world. In 2004, it was nominated for 14 Tony Awards and won three: Best Musical, Best Direction of a Musical for Mike Nichols, and Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical for Sara Ramirez, who played the Lady of the Lake, a character specially added for the musical. Cleese played the voice of God, played in the film by Chapman.

Owing in part to the success of _Spamalot_, PBS announced on 13 July 2005 that it would begin to re-air the entire run of _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ and new one-hour specials focusing on each member of the group, called _Monty Python's Personal Best_.[53] Each episode was written and produced by the individual being honoured, with the five remaining Pythons collaborating on Chapman's programme, the only one of the editions to take on a serious tone with its new material. at the premiere of _The Seventh Python_ in 2009]] In 2009, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the first episode of _Monty Python's Flying Circus_, a six-part documentary entitled _Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)_ was released, featuring interviews with the surviving members of the team, as well as archive interviews with Graham Chapman and numerous excerpts from the television series and films.

Also in commemoration of the 40th anniversary, Idle, Palin, Jones, and Gilliam appeared in a production of _Not the Messiah_ at the Royal Albert Hall. The European premiere was held on 23 October 2009.[54] An official 40th anniversary Monty Python reunion event took place in New York City on 15 October 2009, where the team received a Special Award from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.[55]

In June 2011, it was announced that _A Liar's Autobiography_, an animated 3D movie based on the memoir of Graham Chapman, was in the making. The book _A Liar's Autobiography_ was published in 1980 and details Chapman's journey through medical school, alcoholism, acknowledgement of his gay identity, and the tolls of surreal comedy. Asked what was true in a deliberately fanciful account by Chapman of his life, Terry Jones joked: "Nothing ... it's all a downright, absolute, blackguardly lie." The film uses Chapman's own voice – from a reading of his autobiography shortly before he died of cancer – and entertainment channel Epix announced the film’s release in early 2012 in both 2D and 3D formats. Produced and directed by London-based Bill Jones, Ben Timlett, and Jeff Simpson, the new film has 15 animation companies working on chapters that will range from three to 12 minutes in length, each in a different style. John Cleese recorded dialogue which was matched with Chapman's voice. Michael Palin voiced Chapman's father and Terry Jones voiced his mother. Terry Gilliam voiced Graham's psychiatrist. They all play various other roles. Among the original Python group, only Eric Idle was not involved.[56]

On 26 January 2012, Terry Jones announced that the five surviving Pythons would reunite in a sci-fi comedy film called _Absolutely Anything_.[57] The film would combine computer-generated imagery and live action. It would be directed by Jones based on a script by Jones and Gavin Scott. The plot revolves around a teacher who discovers aliens (voiced by the Pythons) have given him magical powers to do "absolutely anything".[58] Eric Idle responded via Twitter that he would not, in fact, be participating,[59] although he was later added to the cast.[60]

_Monty Python Live (Mostly): One Down, Five to Go_

, London, in July 2014]]

In 2013, the Pythons lost a legal case to Mark Forstater, the film producer of _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_, over royalties for the derivative work _Spamalot_. They owed a combined £800,000 in legal fees and back royalties to Forstater. They proposed a reunion show to pay their legal bill.[61]

On 19 November 2013, a new reunion was reported, following months of "secret talks".[62] The original plan was for a live, one-off stage show at the O₂ Arena in London on 1 July 2014, with "some of Monty Python's greatest hits, with modern, topical, Pythonesque twists" according to a press release.[63][64][65] The tickets for this show went on sale in November 2013 and sold out in just 43 seconds.[66] Nine additional shows were added, all of them at the O2, the last on 20 July. They have said that their reunion was inspired by _South Park_ creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who are massive Monty Python fans.[67]

Michael Palin stated that the final reunion show on 20 July would be the last time that the troupe would perform together. The event was first shown live from the UK nationwide and was titled _Monty Python Live (Mostly)_ and was later reshown at select theatres in recorded form in August.[68][69]


Python members

Graham Chapman was originally a medical student, joining the Footlights at Cambridge. He completed his medical training and was legally entitled to practice as a doctor. Chapman is best remembered for the lead roles in _Holy Grail_, as King Arthur, and _Life of Brian_, as Brian Cohen. He died of metastatic throat cancer on 4 October 1989. At Chapman's memorial service, Cleese delivered an irreverent eulogy that included all the euphemisms for being dead from the "Dead Parrot" sketch, which they had written. Chapman's comedic fictional memoir, _A Liar's Autobiography_, was adapted into an animated 3D movie in 2012.

John Cleese is the oldest Python. He met his future Python writing partner, Chapman, in Cambridge. Outside of Python, he is best known for setting up the Video Arts group and for the sitcom _Fawlty Towers_ (co-written with Connie Booth, whom Cleese met during work on Python and to whom he was married for a decade). Cleese has also co-authored several books on psychology and wrote the screenplay for the award-winning _A Fish Called Wanda_, in which he starred with Michael Palin.

Terry Gilliam, an American by birth, is the only member of the troupe of non-British origin.[70] He started off as an animator and strip cartoonist for Harvey Kurtzman's _Help!_ magazine, one issue of which featured Cleese. Moving from the US to England, he animated features for _Do Not Adjust Your Set_ and was then asked by its makers to join them on their next project: _Monty Python's Flying Circus_. He co-directed _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ and directed short segments of other Python films (for instance "The Crimson Permanent Assurance", the short film that appears before _The Meaning of Life_).

When Monty Python was first formed, two writing partnerships were already in place: Cleese and Chapman, Jones and Palin. That left two in their own corners: Gilliam, operating solo due to the nature of his work, and Eric Idle. Regular themes in Idle's contributions were elaborate wordplay and musical numbers. After _Flying Circus_, he hosted _Saturday Night Live_ four times in the first five seasons. Idle's initially successful solo career faltered in the 1990s with the failures of his 1993 film _Splitting Heirs_ (written, produced by, and starring him) and 1998's _An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn_ (in which he starred), which was awarded five Razzies, including 'Worst Picture of the Year'. He revived his career by returning to the source of his worldwide fame, adapting Monty Python material for other media. He also wrote the Broadway musical _Spamalot_, based on the _Holy Grail_ movie. He also wrote _Not the Messiah_, an oratorio derived from the _Life of Brian_.

Terry Jones has been described by other members of the team as the "heart" of the operation. Jones had a lead role in maintaining the group's unity and creative independence. Python biographer George Perry has commented that should "[you] speak to him on subjects as diverse as fossil fuels, or Rupert Bear, or mercenaries in the Middle Ages or Modern China ... in a moment you will find yourself hopelessly out of your depth, floored by his knowledge." Many others agree that Jones is characterised by his irrepressible, good-natured enthusiasm. However, Jones' passion often led to prolonged arguments with other group members—in particular Cleese—with Jones often unwilling to back down. Since his major contributions were largely behind the scenes (direction, writing), and he often deferred to the other members of the group as an actor, Jones' importance to Python was often under-rated. However, he does have the legacy of delivering possibly the most famous line in all of Python, as Brian's mother Mandy in _Life of Brian_, "He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!", a line voted the funniest in film history on two occasions.[71][72]

Sir Michael Palin attended Oxford, where he met his Python writing partner Jones. The two also wrote the series _Ripping Yarns_ together. Palin and Jones originally wrote face-to-face, but soon found it was more productive to write apart and then come together to review what the other had written. Therefore, Jones and Palin's sketches tended to be more focused than that of the others, taking one bizarre situation, sticking to it, and building on it. After _Flying Circus_, Palin hosted _Saturday Night Live_ four times in the first 10 seasons. His comedy output began to decrease in amount following the increasing success of his travel documentaries for the BBC. Palin released a book of diaries from the Python years entitled _Michael Palin Diaries 1969–1979_, published in 2007. Palin was appointed a K.C.M.G. in the 2019 New Year Honours, which were announced by Buckingham Palace in December 2018.

Associate Pythons

Several people have been accorded unofficial "associate Python" status over the years. Occasionally such people have been referred to as the 'seventh Python', in a style reminiscent of George Martin (or other associates of the Beatles) being dubbed "the Fifth Beatle". The two collaborators with the most meaningful and plentiful contributions have been Neil Innes and Carol Cleveland. Both were present and presented as Associate Pythons at the official Monty Python 25th-anniversary celebrations held in Los Angeles in July 1994. (in 2009), commonly called “Python girl”, or “Seventh Python”.[73]]] Neil Innes is the only non-Python besides Douglas Adams to be credited with writing material for _Flying Circus_. He appeared in sketches and the Python films, as well as performing some of his songs in _Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl_. He was also a regular stand-in for absent team members on the rare occasions when they recreated sketches. For example, he took the place of Cleese at the Concert for George. Gilliam once noted that if anyone qualified for the title of the seventh Python, it would certainly be Innes. He was one of the creative talents in the off-beat Bonzo Dog Band. He would later portray Ron Nasty of the Rutles and write all of the Rutles' compositions for _All You Need Is Cash_ (1978), a mockumentary film co-directed by Idle. By 2005, a falling out had occurred between Idle and Innes over additional Rutles projects, the results being Innes' critically acclaimed Rutles "reunion" album _The Rutles: Archaeology_ and Idle's straight-to-DVD _The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch_, each undertaken without the other's participation. According to an interview with Idle in the _Chicago Tribune_ in May 2005, his attitude is that Innes and he go back "too far. And no further." Innes has remained silent on the dispute.

Carol Cleveland was the most important female performer in the Monty Python ensemble, commonly referred to as "the female Python". She was originally hired by producer/director John Howard Davies for just the first five episodes of the _Flying Circus_. The Pythons then pushed to make Cleveland a permanent recurring performer after producer/director Ian MacNaughton brought in several other actresses who were not as good as she was.[74] Cleveland went on to appear in about two-thirds of the episodes, as well as in all of the Python films, and in most of their stage shows, as well.

Other contributors

Cleese's first wife, Connie Booth, appeared as various characters in all four series of _Flying Circus_. Her most significant role was the "best girl" of the eponymous Lumberjack in "The Lumberjack Song", though this role was sometimes played by Carol Cleveland. Booth appeared in a total of six sketches and also played one-off characters in Python feature films _And Now for Something Completely Different_ and _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_.

Douglas Adams was "discovered" by Chapman when a version of _Footlights Revue_ (a 1974 BBC2 television show featuring some of Adams' early work) was performed live in London's West End. In Cleese's absence from the final TV series, the two formed a brief writing partnership, with Adams earning a writing credit in one episode for a sketch called "Patient Abuse". In the sketch, a man who had been stabbed by a nurse arrives at his doctor's office bleeding profusely from the stomach, when the doctor makes him fill in numerous senseless forms before he can administer treatment. He also had two cameo appearances in this season. Firstly, in the episode "The Light Entertainment War", Adams shows up in a surgeon's mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to the on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while Palin narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another, and never actually gets started. Secondly, at the beginning of "Mr. Neutron", Adams is dressed in a "pepperpot" outfit and loads a missile onto a cart being driven by Terry Jones, who is calling out for scrap metal ("Any old iron ..."). Adams and Chapman also subsequently attempted a few non-Python projects, including _Out of the Trees._ He also contributed to a sketch on the soundtrack album for _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_.

Other than Carol Cleveland, the only other non-Python to make a significant number of appearances in the _Flying Circus_ was Ian Davidson. He appeared in the first two series of the show, and played over 10 roles. While Davidson is primarily known as a scriptwriter, it is not known if he had any contribution toward the writing of the sketches, as he is only credited as a performer. In total, Davidson is credited as appearing in eight episodes of the show, which is more than any other male actor who was not a Python. Despite this, Davidson did not appear in any Python-related media subsequent to series 2, though footage of him was shown on the documentary _Python Night – 30 Years of Monty Python_.

Stand-up comedian Eddie Izzard, a devoted fan of the group, has occasionally stood in for absent members. When the BBC held a "Python Night" in 1999 to celebrate 30 years of the first broadcast of _Flying Circus_, the Pythons recorded some new material with Izzard standing in for Idle, who had declined to partake in person (he taped a solo contribution from the US). Izzard hosted _The Life of Python_ (1999), a history of the group that was part of Python Night and appeared with them at a festival/tribute in Aspen, Colorado, in 1998 (released on DVD as _Live at Aspen_). Izzard has said that Monty Python was a significant influence on his style of comedy and Cleese has referred to him as "the lost Python".[75]

Series director of _Flying Cirus_, Ian MacNaughton, is also regularly associated with the group and made a few on-screen appearances in the show and in the film _And Now for Something Completely Different_. Apart from Neil Innes, others to contribute musically included Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers. They made appearances in songs such as "The Lumberjack Song" as a backup choir. In addition, various other contributors and performers for the Pythons included John Howard Davies, John Hughman, Lyn Ashley, Bob Raymond, John Young, Rita Davies, Stanley Mason, Maureen Flanagan, and David Ballantyne.

Cultural influence and legacy

By the time of Monty Python's 25th anniversary, in 1994, the point was already being made that "the five surviving members had with the passing years begun to occupy an institutional position in the edifice of British social culture that they had once had so much fun trying to demolish".[76] A similar point is made in a 2006 book on the relationship between Python and philosophy: "It is remarkable, after all, not only that the utterly bizarre _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ was sponsored by the BBC in the first place, but that Monty Python itself grew into an institution of enormous cultural influence."[77]

-   Matt Groening, creator and co-developer of the animated sitcom _The Simpsons_, names Monty Python as an influence and pays tribute through a couch gag used in seasons five and six.[78]
-   Also the episode "Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)," from Season 7, has a parody series called _Pardon My Zinger_ which Waylon Smithers watches at 3 pm on Comedy Central. It includes an opening "rank-out" which could be similar to Monty Python.
-   In the same season, the episode "22 Short Films About Springfield" can be depicted as modeled after _Monty Python's Flying Circus._ The episode's main plot is a series of interconnected segments featuring people of Springfield. This is similar to some of the themed episodes to "Flying Circus" such as "Sex and Violence" from season 1 and "The Spanish Inquisition" from season 2. Segments of this nature include:
    -   Lisa getting gum in her hair and the battle to remove the hair.
    -   Principal Skinner's luncheon with Superintendent Chalmers
    -   Bumblebee Man Destroying his house after arriving home from work.
    -   Smithers getting stung by a bee and the need to head to the emergency room which leads to a scene from a medical review board.

Comedy stylists

Monty Python has been named as being influential to the comedy stylings of a great many additional people including: Sacha Baron Cohen,[79] David Cross,[80] Noel Fielding, Seth MacFarlane,[81] Seth Meyers,[82] Trey Parker,[83] Matt Stone,[84] and Vic and Bob.[85]

Places

In space

-   Seven asteroids are named after Monty Python or its members: 9617 Grahamchapman, 9618 Johncleese, 9619 Terrygilliam, 9620 Ericidle, 9621 Michaelpalin, 9622 Terryjones, and 13681 Monty Python.
-   In 2010, the commercial space company SpaceX launched a wheel of cheese into low earth orbit and returned it safely to the earth. Elon Musk, CEO and CTO of SpaceX, claimed this was done as a tribute to Monty Python.[86]

Terrestrial

-   After John Cleese spoke negatively about the town of Palmerston North in New Zealand, recommending it as a good place to commit suicide, the town renamed a compost heap "Mt. Cleese".[87]

"Pythonesque"

Amongst the more visible cultural influences of Monty Python is the inclusion of terms either directly from, or derived from, Monty Python, into the lexicon of the English language.

-   The most obvious of these is the term 'pythonesque', which has become a byword in surreal humour, and is included in standard dictionaries.[88][89] Terry Jones commented on his disappointment at the existence of such a term, claiming the initial aim of Monty Python was to create something new and impossible to categorise, and "the fact that Pythonesque is now a word in the _Oxford English Dictionary_ shows the extent to which we failed".[90]
-   The term has been applied to animations similar to those constructed by Gilliam (e.g., the cut-out style of _South Park_, whose creators have often acknowledged a debt to Python, including contributing material to the aforementioned 30th-anniversary theme night).[91]
-   _Good Eats_ creator Alton Brown cited Python as one of the influences that shaped how he created the series, as well as how he authors the script for each episode.[92] Later episodes included Gilliam-style animations to illustrate key points.

TV

The Japanese anime series, _Girls und Panzer_, featured the special episode, "Survival War!", which referenced the 'Spam' sketch.[93]

Things named after Monty Python

Beyond a dictionary definition, Python terms have entered the lexicon in other ways.

-   The term "spam" in reference to bulk, unsolicited email is derived from the programme's 1970 "Spam" sketch.[94]
-   The Python programming language by Guido van Rossum is named after the troupe, and Monty Python references are often found in sample code created for that language. The default integrated development environment of the programming language is named IDLE, an alternative one is named eric, both in honour of Eric Idle. Additionally, a 2001 April Fool's Day joke by van Rossum and Larry Wall involving the merger of Python with Perl was dubbed "Parrot" after the Dead Parrot sketch. The name "Parrot" was later used for a project to develop a virtual machine for running bytecode for interpreted languages such as Perl and Python. Its package index is also known as the "Cheese Shop"[95] after the sketch of the same name. There is also a python refactoring tool called bicyclerepair named after Bicycle Repair Man sketch.[96]
-   In 1985, a fossil of a previously unknown species of gigantic prehistoric snake from the Miocene was discovered in Riversleigh, Queensland, Australia. The Australian palaeontologist who discovered the fossil snake was a Monty Python fan, and he gave the snake the taxonomic name of _Montypythonoides riversleighensis_ in honour of the Monty Python team.[97]
-   In 2006, Ben & Jerry's, known for their "celebrity flavours", introduced to the line-up "Vermonty Python", a coffee liqueur ice cream with a chocolate cookie crumb swirl and fudge cows. The name "Minty Python" had been suggested before in 1996 in a contest to select the quintessential British ice cream flavour.[98][99]
-   In 1999, in connection with the group's 30th anniversary, a beer named "Holy Grail Ale" was released by the Black Sheep Brewery in North Yorkshire.
-   The endangered Bemaraha woolly lemur (_Avahi cleesei_) is named after John Cleese.[100][101]
-   Geneticists discovered a mutant gene which caused mutant flies to live twice as long as normal ones. They dubbed the gene "Indy," which is an acronym for the line of dialogue: "I'm not dead yet!", from the film _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_.[102]
-   The band Toad the Wet Sprocket took its name from the Rock Notes[103] sketch on the comedy album, Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album.[104]

World records

On St George's Day, 23 April 2007, the cast and creators of _Spamalot_ gathered in Trafalgar Square under the tutelage of the two Terrys (Jones and Gilliam) to set a new record for the world's largest coconut orchestra. They led 5,567 people "clip-clopping" in time to the Python classic, "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life", for the _Guinness World Records_ attempt.[105]

Theatre

_Monty Python's Flying Circus_ : Between 1974 and 1980 (Live at the Hollywood Bowl was released in 1982, but was performed in 1980), the Pythons made three sketch-based stage shows, comprising mainly material from the original television series.
_Monty Python's Spamalot_ : Written by Idle and directed by Mike Nichols, with music and lyrics by John Du Prez and Idle, it starred Hank Azaria, Tim Curry, and David Hyde Pierce; _Spamalot_ is a musical adaptation of the film _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_. It ran in Chicago from 21 December 2004 to 23 January 2005, and began performances on Broadway on 17 March 2005. It won three Tony Awards. It was one of eight UK musicals commemorated on Royal Mail stamps, issued in February 2011.[106]
_Not the Messiah_ : the Toronto Symphony Orchestra commissioned Idle and John Du Prez to write the music and lyrics of an oratorio based on _Monty Python's Life of Brian_. Entitled _Not the Messiah_, it had its world premiere as part of Luminato, a "festival of arts and creativity" taking place 1–10 June 2007 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. _Not the Messiah_ was conducted by Peter Oundjian, Music Director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, who is Idle's cousin. It was performed by a narrator, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, with guest soloists and choir. According to Idle, "It will be funnier than Handel, though not as good".
_Monty Python Live_: One Down, Five to Go : (1–5, 15–16, 18–20 July 2014) The Pythons have stated this is the last live reunion of the remaining members of Monty Python. Held at London's O2 arena, tickets for the first night's show sold out in 43 seconds. The set list included a mix of live performances of their most popular sketches, clips from their shows, and elaborate dance numbers. Each night featured a different celebrity "victim" of the "Blackmail" sketch.
