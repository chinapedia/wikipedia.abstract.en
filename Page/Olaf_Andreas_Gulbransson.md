OLAF ANDREAS GULBRANSSON (23 January 1916, Munich – 18 July 1961) was a German architect of Norwegian descent, particularly active in church architecture. He was the son of the Norwegian-born artist and painter Olaf Gulbransson (1873–1958) and his third wife Grete Jehly (1882–1934) – his mother was half-sister to the writer Norman Douglas.

He designed a conference hall for the Evangelische Akademie Tutzing.
