Reception

In its review of _The Call of the Wolves_, _Booklist_ wrote "The taut story line, compelling illustrations, and recently renewed interest in wolves make this fictionalized account valuable."[1] and the _School Library Journal_ wrote "The exquisite ice-blue pages portray the majestic arctic wilderness in a wintry, snowy, half-light. Weatherby's animals spring to life, and he adeptly captures the movement, the stillness, the danger, and the calm of the text. Like Yoshida's _Young Lions_ (Philomel, 1989), this should help generate appreciation for animals in the wild, and is also concerned with issues of separation and connection."[2] _Kirkus Reviews_ calls it "a realistic story".[3]
