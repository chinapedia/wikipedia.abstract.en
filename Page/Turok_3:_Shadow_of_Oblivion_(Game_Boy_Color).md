_TUROK 3: SHADOW OF OBLIVION_ is an action video game developed by Bit Managers and published by Acclaim Entertainment. It was released for the Game Boy Color handheld game console in 2000 alongside its Nintendo 64 counterpart. Although the game is set in the same fictional universe as its counterpart, it features a different storyline.


Gameplay

_Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion_ is an action game that is presented from a top-down perspective.[1] To progress through the game, the player must control Turok through a series of levels while wiping out a large number of enemies using different types of weaponry.[2] Some levels have keys that the player need to find to access locked areas and progress further through that level, while others require the player to control a vehicle and destroy structures.[3] The game employs a password system to prevent the loss of progress.[4] Although the game is set in the same fictional universe as its Nintendo 64 counterpart, it features a different storyline. The story follows Turok as he aids peaceful Dinosoids to stop a rebel Dinosoid sect from reawakening an ages-old war.[5]


Development

_Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion_ was developed by the Spanish video game company Bit Managers and published by Acclaim Entertainment. The game uses the same engine as Bit Manager's previous _Turok_ game, _Turok: Rage Wars_, which allows for multidirectional scrolling.[6] The music of the game was composed by Alberto Jose González, who also produced the music of the previous Game Boy Color _Turok_ games.[7]


Reception

_Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion_ received generally favorable reviews from critics. Craig Harris of IGN considered it to be the best _Turok_ game on the Game Boy Color system due to its smooth animations, responsive controls and old-school design,[8] while the Spanish official Nintendo magazine, _Nintendo Acción_, highlighted its variety of environments and non-stop action.[9] In a mixed review, _Planet Game Boy_ magazine praised the vehicular sections, but criticized the unexciting on-foot action.[10]

Writing for GameSpot, Frank Provo praised its balanced gameplay, concluding that "the vehicular and top-down levels give the game an activity-oriented feel, while the side-scrolling missions deliver the tried and true formula of bloodshed and mayhem the series' fans crave."[11] _Nintendo Power_ criticized its lack of challenge and short length, saying that it is possible to complete the game in just one hour.[12]
