GASTROENTEROLOGY[1] is the branch of medicine focused on the digestive system and its disorders.

Diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract, which include the organs from mouth into anus, along the alimentary canal, are the focus of this speciality. Physicians practicing in this field are called GASTROENTEROLOGISTS. They have usually completed about eight years of pre-medical and medical education, a year-long internship (if this is not a part of the residency), three years of an internal medicine residency, and two to three years in the gastroenterology fellowship. Gastroenterologists perform a number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures including colonoscopy, endoscopy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic ultrasound and liver biopsy. Some gastroenterology trainees will complete a "fourth-year" (although this is often their seventh year of graduate medical education) in transplant hepatology, advanced endoscopy, inflammatory bowel disease, motility or other topics.

HEPATOLOGY, or HEPATOBILIARY MEDICINE, encompasses the study of the liver, pancreas, and biliary tree, while PROCTOLOGY encompasses the fields of anus and rectum diseases. They are traditionally considered sub-specialties of gastroenterology.


History

Bozzini_Lichtleiter.jpg]]

Citing from Egyptian papyri, John F. Nunn identified significant knowledge of gastrointestinal diseases among practicing physicians during the periods of the pharaohs. Irynakhty, of the tenth dynasty, c. 2125 B.C., was a court physician specializing in gastroenterology, sleeping, and proctology.[2]

Among ancient Greeks, Hippocrates attributed digestion to concoction. Galen's concept of the stomach having four _faculties_ was widely accepted up to modernity in the seventeenth century.

Eighteenth century:

-   Italian Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729–99) was among early physicians to disregard Galen's theories, and in 1780 he gave experimental proof on the action of gastric juice on foodstuffs.
-   In 1767, German Johann von Zimmermann wrote an important work on dysentery.
-   In 1777, Maximilian Stoll of Vienna described cancer of the gallbladder.Edgardo Rivera, MD

Nineteenth century:

-   In 1805, Philipp Bozzini made the first attempt to observe inside the living human body using a tube he named _Lichtleiter_ (light-guiding instrument) to examine the urinary tract, the rectum, and the pharynx. This is the earliest description of endoscopy.[4][5]
-   Charles Emile Troisier described enlargement of lymph nodes in abdominal cancer.[6]
-   In 1823, William Prout discovered that stomach juices contain hydrochloric acid.[7]
-   In 1833, William Beaumont published _Experiments and Observations on the Gastric Juice and the Physiology of Digestion_ following years of experimenting on test subject Alexis St. Martin.
-   In 1868, Adolf Kussmaul, a well-known German physician, developed the gastroscope. He perfected the technique on a sword swallower.
-   In 1871, at the society of physicians in Vienna, Carl Stoerk demonstrated an esophagoscope made of two telescopic metal tubes, initially devised by Waldenburg in 1870.
-   In 1876, Karl Wilhelm von Kupffer described the properties of some liver cells now called Kupffer cell.
-   In 1883, Hugo Kronecker and Samuel James Meltzer studied oesophageal manometry in humans.

McClendon_pH-probe.png pH-probe]] Twentieth century:

-   In 1915, Jesse McClendon tested acidity of human stomach _in situ_.[8]
-   In 1921-22, Walter Alvarez did the first electrogastrography research.[9]
-   Rudolf Schindler described many important diseases involving the human digestive system during World War I in his illustrated textbook and is portrayed by some as the "father of gastroscopy". He and Georg Wolf developed a semiflexible gastroscope in 1932.
-   In 1932, Burrill Bernard Crohn described Crohn's disease.
-   In 1957, Basil Hirschowitz introduced the first prototype of a fibreoptic gastroscope.

Twenty-first century:

-   In 2005, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren of Australia were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of _Helicobacter pylori_ (1982/1983) and its role in peptic ulcer disease. James Leavitt assisted in their research, but the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously so he was not included in the award.
