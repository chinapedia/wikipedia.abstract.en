GOOSEBERRY is an unincorporated community in Morrow County, Oregon, United States. Gooseberry lies along Ioneâ€“Gooseberry Road near its intersection with Oregon Route 206 between Heppner to the east and Condon to the west.[1]

Cattlemen began referring to the location as _Gooseberry Spring_ as early as 1872. Its name came from a large wild gooseberry bush near the spring. A Gooseberry post office operated in the community from 1884 through 1918.[2]
