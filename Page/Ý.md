Ý (Ý) is a letter of Old Norse, Icelandic, Kazakh, Vietnamese,and Faroese alphabets, as well as in Turkmen language. In Czech and Slovak languages it represents a long form of the vowel _y_. Originally, the letter Ý was formed from the letter Y and an acute accent.

In Icelandic, Ý is the 29th letter of the alphabet, between Y and Þ. It is read as /i/ (short) or /iː/ (long).[1]

In Turkmen, Ý represents the consonant /j/, as opposed to Y, which represents the vowel sound /ɯ/.

In Kazakh, Ý is the 29th letter of the Latin alphabet and represents /w/ (or /ʊw/ or /ʉw/).


Other uses

In Vietnamese, Ý means "Italy". The word is a shortened form of _Ý Đại Lợi_, which comes from Chinese 意大利 (_Yìdàlì_ in Mandarin, a phonetic rendering of the country's name).

Ý does not exist in Modern Spanish, but the accented letter ý can be found in the proper name Aýna, a village in Spain. Nevertheless, it was used in Early Modern Spanish.
