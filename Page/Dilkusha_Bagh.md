DILKUSHA BAGH (, literally _The Engaging Garden_ or _The Charming Garden_) is an old Date Orchard in Bhakkar District of Punjab, Pakistan. It is believed to be a Mughal garden built by Humayun or Akbar. However Humayun never visited the area. On his retreat to Iran, he went to another Bakhar in Sindh to seek help from Mahmood Khan, but this route was rejected by Major Henry Raverty as the possible retreat of Humayun.[1]


History

Very little is recorded about this orchard, but the Official District Record states: According to another tradition, Princess Mehr-un-Nissa was also born in Bhakkar during the Migration of Mirza Ghiyas Beg and his Wife Asmat Begum (The Mother of Mehr-un-Nissa).

One of the later works from the 18th century gives an idea about the Orchard as there were no other major orchards except Dilkusha Bagh in the 18th Century. The Imperial Gazetteer of India mentions the Orchards of Bhakkar as follows:
