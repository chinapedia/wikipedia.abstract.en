ALEYNA TILKI (born 28 March 2000) is a Turkish singer.[1]


Life and career

Tilki was born in Konya, on March 28, 2000, to a Russian father from Konya and a Turkish mother from Trabzon.[2] She was a semi-finalist on the sixth season of _Yetenek Sizsiniz Türkiye_ (Turkish version of the _Got Talent_ series). She caught public attention because of her _Gesi Bağları_ cover on the show.[3][4][5] She achieved national recognition after the release of her song "Cevapsız Çınlama"[6] along with its music video, which has more than 430 million views on YouTube. It is considered the most viewed Turkish music video on YouTube.[7] The song went up to No. 2 on the Turkey's Trending List.[8] Aleyna Tilki released her first solo single "Sen Olsan Bari" in July 2017 which became number 1 in Turkey's charts.[9] The music video currently has over 390 million views on YouTube.

During the first months of her career, Tilki took stage at alcohol-serving venues which brought criticism from the government due to her being under age.[10] During her concert in Diyarbakır in November 2016, two hand-made sound bombs were exploded in the venue.[11]

Tilki temporarily left Turkey in order to complete English language training and settled in Los Angeles in November 2017.[12]
