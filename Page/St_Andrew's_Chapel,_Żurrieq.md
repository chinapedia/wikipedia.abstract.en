St Andrew's was first mentioned in the reports recounting the visit of Bishop Pietro Dusina in 1575. However, the chapel was rebuilt in 1634 as mentioned in other pastoral visits. The chapel was deconsecrated in 1658 by Bishop Balaguer. The church remained in disuse until 1690 when the chapel became the property of the parish church of St Catherine. [1]
