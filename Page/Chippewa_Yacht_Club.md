The CHIPPEWA YACHT CLUB is a private yacht club located in Chippewa Lake, Ohio (United States).


History

The ownership of Chippewa Lake Park and the lake changed hands in 1968. Until that time the CYC lease agreement was with Chippewa Lake Park. Parker Beach owner of Chippewa Lake Park and lake viewed the Club as an asset and was most supportive of CYC from its inception. Since 1971 efforts have been ongoing to find a permanent home on the lake.

The Medina County Parks District purchased the lake in 2007 and have been very supportive of the Club. The clubhouse grounds are continuing to be leased from the current owner of the land.

In May of 2018, Chippewa Yacht Club was used for principal photography filming for _The Last Summer_ starring K.J. Apa, Maia Mitchell, and Norman Johnson Jr.
