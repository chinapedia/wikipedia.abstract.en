Plot

In North Africa, US Marine sniper Mike Stevens and his spotter Tommy Madison are on a secret mission to assassinate a dangerous terrorist leader attending a Bedouin wedding. Mike botches the assassination attempt, hesitating when the target's son steps in the way. Due to a glare off the sniper scope, Mike and Tommy are discovered by the enemy and attacked. However, a sandstorm forces the enemy to retreat, leaving Mike and Tommy behind. Seeking an immediate evacuation, the two are instructed to find their way to a village where they can be picked up once the sandstorm stops.

However, en route to the village, Tommy steps on a land mine which blows off his legs. Moments later, Mike also steps on a mine, but realizes he has done so and avoids stepping off it. Tommy, in agony, shoots himself in the head, not wanting to return home to his wife and child in his current condition.

Now alone, Mike contacts his superior via transmitter, who tells him that he will have to hold out for a few days before he can be rescued. Exposed to the harsh environment of the desert, Stevens battles both the psychological and physical tolls of the treacherous situation he is trapped in, recalling memories or imagining appearances of Tommy, his girlfriend, his parents, and moments from when he was a young boy.

Mike is visited several times by the Berber, who long ago lost one of his legs as well as his only daughter to a landmine he had intended to take and sell to enemy soldiers. The Berber, who speaks some English, urges Mike to step off the mine and move forward with life. He insists that Mike is a lucky man, after surviving a night attack by desert dogs while simultaneously managing to keep his foot on the mine.

Mike is later attacked by enemy insurgents, who had traced him to his current location, but is able to fight them off. Mike then reluctantly decides to accept the Berber's advice, having grown weary of his predicament. He steps off the landmine – only for it not to explode. He digs and discovers that what he had assumed to be an explosive was actually just a tin can with a little toy soldier inside of it. He sets off a flare and is finally rescued. Back in the United States, he reunites with his girlfriend, to whom he finally proposes.

Production

In 2012, Fabio Guaglione and Fabio Resinaro pitched to Peter Safran the scriptment for _Mine_.[1]

Armie Hammer joined the cast of the film on April 30, 2014.[2] Guaglione was at first against Hammer's casting, because of his previous "charming" roles and once said to producer Peter Safran that "if [Armie Hammer] stars, the movie's dead".[3] However, Safran convinced him by telling him of Hammer's collaborations with famous directors such as David Fincher, Clint Eastwood, and Guy Ritchie, and organizing a meeting with the actor.[4] For the role of US Marine Tommy Madison, Guaglione and Resinaro considered over 50 American actors, including Rami Malek, Adam Brody and Chris Zylka, before choosing British actor Tom Cullen.[5]

The movie was shot in Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands.[6] The directors dedicated the film in memory of their location manager, Nikolai Semjevski (1975 - 2015).
