PARADISE is an unincorporated community in Clay County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]


History

In 1832, the US Government deeded of land at this location to Mr. Pleasant Gentry. The land was sold in 1850 to John Gosney, who surveyed the land. The developing town was named "Gosneyville". Gosneyville was renamed "Paradise" _circa_ 1884.[2]

A post office called Paradise was established in 1858, and remained in operation until 1907.[3] The community was so named for the many churches in town relative to its small size.[4]
