The male has dark palps with white squamose hairs on front.[3] The tibial apophysis has a fine, long, pointed, hook-shaped process. The male has a long palpal bulb. The cephalothorax is black with a metallic sheen and has white hairs, towards the front bright and on some individuals there are 1-2 bright pairs of spots to the rear. Legs light yellow, with black longitudinal stripes, although some individuals may have uniformly dark legs. The opisthosoma is grey-black, again with a metallic sheen and white hairs.[4]

Habitat and ecology

_Heliophanus cupreus_ has been collected from a wide variety of habitat types such as woodlands, grasslands, raised bogs, coastal cliffs and shingle beaches, as well as disturbed habitats such as wastelands and quarries. Within its varied habitats, _Heliophanus cupreus_ is commonly encountered in the drier locations. It is occasionally observed to be active on the surface but is more commonly found within the litter. In northern Great Britain _Heliophanus cupreus_ seems to require sunny conditions. When resting, _Heliophanus cupreus_ may be found in a silken cell placed either under stones or within the litter. The adults of both sexes are found mainly in May, June and July and females may persist into the autumn.[6]


Distribution

_Heliophanus cupreus_ has a Palearctic distribution,[7] being found throughout Europe except Iceland.[8] In Great Britain it has a scattered distribution as far north as central Scotland where it is normally a coastal species.[9]
