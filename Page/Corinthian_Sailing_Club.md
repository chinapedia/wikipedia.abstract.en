The CORINTHIAN SAILING CLUB is a private yacht club located in Dallas, Texas, on the shore of White Rock Lake (United States).[1]


History

CSC was formally incorporated in June 1939 by Tom Nash, Frank Parker and Wilfred Bruce. In the beginning Snipes were the primary boats at CSC, although CSC members were also racing Seagulls and Lightnings in the early 1040s. The Snipe owners were members of Fleet 1 and participated in races with Snipe sailors from the Dallas Sailing Club (DSC) and the White Rock Sailing Club (WRSC). Lightning Fleet 35 was organized in 1940, the Y flyer fleet in the 1950s, Rebel Fleet 24 in 1960, and Flying Scot Fleet 23 followed in the early 1960s. Lone Star 13 and Corinthian fleets were chartered as Fleet Number 1 by their classes, as had the Snipe earlier.[2]
