WILDERNESS is an unincorporated community in Oregon County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]


History

A post office called Wilderness was established in 1882, and remained in operation until 1954.[2] The community derives its name from a region originally called "Irish Wilderness", a former Irish colony which was abandoned on account of Civil War violence.[3]
