_MOTHER GOOSE'S LITTLE TREASURES_ is a 2007 children's picture book by Iona Opie. It is a collection of nursery rhymes, some little known, chosen by Opie from the Mother Goose oeuvre.


Contents

_Little Treasures_ contains 22 nursery rhymes:

    Here comes Solomon
    The leaves are green
    Intery, mintery
    Handy Spandy
    Rosy apple
    Mrs. Whirly
    Parcel post
    Sing, sing
    In and out the windows
    Little fatty doctor
    Oats and beans and barley
    Wee melodie man
    Chick chick chick chick
    What the goose thinketh
    Mother, may I?
    Little old dog sits under a chair
    Uncle John
    Cockle shells
    Going to Kentucky
    The moon shines bright
    My maid Mary
    Before it gets dark.


Reception

In a star review, Booklist wrote "This gem, comprising 22 tidbits from little-known nursery rhymes, shines with the charm of old-time rhymes and with Wells' beloved animal and child characters, set down in her signature style." and concludes "this third Opie-Wells treasury of treasures is likely to become a staple in children's collections."[1] and the School Library Journal found "The very nature of this book makes it a less-essential purchase than this team's _My Very First Mother Goose_ (1996) or _Here Comes Mother Goose_ (1999, both Candlewick), so possibly only larger collections or libraries with lots of Rosemary Wells fans will want it."[2]

Kirkus Reviews wrote "The pictures may suggest scenarios for some of the more abstract lines here, but young goslings will still benefit most not by trying to make sense of the gnomic verses, but just listening to the rhythms of sound and language in them."[3] Publishers Weekly stated "this is less a title for Everytoddler than one for lovers of rhyme and verse."[4] while The New York Times, commenting on Opie's introduction, found her "more the Jungian than the scientist." and that "Wells’s pictures for Opie’s collection don’t go far enough in the originality direction."[5]
