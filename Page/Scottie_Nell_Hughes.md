SCOTTIE NELL HUGHES (born June 21, 1980) is an American journalist, news anchor and political commentator. She was a paid CNN commentator during the 2016 presidential election, often speaking in support of presidential candidate Donald Trump.[1][2][3][4]

Hughes joined RT America as a full-time anchor in September 2018.[5]


Biography

Hughes graduated with a broadcast communications/political science degree from the University of Tennessee at Martin.[6] Her first network TV appearance was on CNN's _Piers Morgan Live_, where she defended the right to keep and bear arms; her brother Cliff had been shot and killed, before she was born.[7]

Hughes began her career as an executive producer on the _Steve Gill Show_ in Nashville, Tennessee.[8] With an established radio career, she went on to take producing positions with _The Rusty Humphries Show_, _The Michael Berry Show_, _The Mark Skoda Show_, and many others. She also was in the first group of radio talk show hosts sent by the Department of Defense to travel to the front lines of Operation Enduring Freedom in Iraq and Kuwait, as well as the detention facilities at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba.[9] She was news director of the Tea Party News Network[10] and served as a political commentator for CNN until her contact expired in January 2017.

On September 18, 2017, Hughes sued Fox News asserting she had been raped by Fox Business Network host Charles Payne. He denied the accusation.[11] Hughes said the subsequent two-year sexual relationship with Payne was coerced and that she believed it would help her obtain a permanent position at the network, and for the duration of the relationship, she kept an apartment near Fox's Manhattan headquarters.[12] Her appearances were drastically reduced after she ended the relationship in 2015 and reported Payne to Fox.[13] According to Hughes, she was fired in retaliation.[14] The suit was settled after a federal judge dismissed most of Hughes' claims, including ones asserting discrimination against Fox News and a cause of action asserting gender-motivated violence against Payne. .[15]

She wrote the _2014 Roar: The New Conservative Woman Speaks Out_.[16]


Controversies

In a live interview broadcast on CNN the day before the 2016 presidential election, she confused the word "Molotov" with mazel tov, a Jewish expression of congratulations or good luck when she stated that a video by rap music artist and Hillary Clinton supporter Jay-Z begins "with a crowd throwing mazel tov cocktails."[17] Six months later, comedian Samantha Bee poked fun at what Hughes called her "silly verbal stumble" and "slip-of-the-tongue" on Not the White House Correspondents' Dinner. Hughes responded by demanding an apology, claiming Bee "attacked my intelligence with a cheap 'brain damage' insult".[18]
