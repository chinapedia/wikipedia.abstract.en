WILLISTON BASIN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT is an airport under construction near Williston, a city in the U.S. state of North Dakota. It is located roughly northwest of the city. Williston Basin Airport will have two runways and a terminal building. It is being built to replace Sloulin Field International Airport, which currently serves Williston and has experienced difficulty dealing with the increase in air traffic to Williston amid the North Dakota oil boom. The project is expected to be completed by late 2019.


History

The airport currently serving Williston, North Dakota, is Sloulin Field International Airport. Sloulin Field Airport has dealt with design concerns, constraints on expansion, and the need for runway works. In addition, the airport has had difficulty coping with a significant rise in air traffic amid the North Dakota oil boom.[1]

In 2011, officials began to consider either making renovations to Sloulin Field or building a new airport.[2] The cost of refurbishments is less than that of constructing a new airport; however, officials determined that building a new airport was the cheaper option. Not having to limit air service to Williston during construction at Sloulin Field would save revenue, and the city would gain from decommissioning the old airport and selling the land.[3] The total cost of the project is $240 million, which will be paid by the FAA, the state of North Dakota, and the city of Williston.[4]

A groundbreaking ceremony took place on October 10, 2016, with several members of the state government in attendance.[5] Procedural and weather-related problems delayed the start of construction to mid-2017.[6]


Infrastructure

The airport will have two runways. Runway 14/32 will be the primary runway and have dimensions , while runway 4/22 will be the crosswind runway and measure .[7]

The terminal will occupy and have four gates, three of which will have jet bridges.[8] It will be able to handle 350,000 passengers annually.[9]


Access

Williston Basin International Airport is located about northwest of Williston.[10] A road will be built to connect the airport to the U.S. Route 85 truck bypass.[11][12]
