Олександрівський_костел._Київ.JPG The CO-CATHEDRAL OF ST. ALEXANDER [1] ( ) also called CATHEDRAL OF ST. ALEXANDER OF KIEV is the name given to a religious building affiliated with the Catholic Church located in the city of Kiev in Ukraine.[2][3]

The church was built between 1817 and 1842 in a cruciform plan, with a dome at the intersection of the aisles in the style of classicism. The church is located on the former site of a Polish merchant and near the Independence Square.

To commemorate the visit of Russian Tsar Alexander I in Kiev the Polish owner Antoni Sawicki built with the consent of the authorities a church in the place.

The first wooden church burned down in 1823, and the new brick church was not completed until 1842. After 1905 the tsarist authorities eased restrictions to make them work other than Russian Orthodox churches. In Soviet times there was installed a planetarium. After the fall of communism was renovated and became the co-cathedral of the Diocese of Kiev-Žytomyr (_Dioecesis Kioviensis-Zytomeriensis_, Єпархія Київ-Житомир)
