Writing and composition

Despite Cameron's musical persona of that of a struggling entertainer, he notes that the album's lyrics are in part influenced by his own life and those of his friends and family: "It’s based on a sense of self-pity that can be generated inside someone from inactivity and/or high ambition. [...] We’re expecting a lot of ourselves in terms of work, rate, and degrees of success, so it’s just our way of commenting on the vast feeling of sadness you can experience if you don’t match those expectations with work. The songs are all based on things that have happened to me or [live saxophonist] Roy, or our friends and family, of what just altered them to fit into this one singular world where these stories trail on or mark the other."[2]
