JOHN ENGMAN (1949â€“1996) was an American poet from Minneapolis, Minnesota.[1]

He published several books of poems, most notably _Keeping Still, Mountain_ (Galileo Press, 1984)[2] and _Temporary Help: Poems_ (1998).[3] He has five poems included in the anthology _New American Poets of the 90s_ (1991): "Mushroom Clouds," "Atlantis," "Another Word for Blue," "Staff," and "One Minute of Night Sky."[4]

He received a Loft-McKnight Writers Award in 1983 and taught courses at the University of Minnesota and St. Olaf College.[5] A writing prize is awarded annually in his memory by his alma mater, Augsburg College in Minneapolis, MN.

Engman died at age 47 of a brain aneurysm. His obituary in the _Minneapolis Star Tribune_ called him "an important poetic and literary voice in the Twin Cities, using as a major theme 'the wry predicament of the quickly aging youth in a foreboding adult world.'"[6]
