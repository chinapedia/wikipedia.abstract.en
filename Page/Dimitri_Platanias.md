DIMITRI PLATANIAS (born 4 December 1970) is a Greek baritone who has had an active international career since 2007, excelling particularly in the roles of Verdi and the Italian Verismo.


Early life and education

Born in Kalamata, he first studied classical guitar and singing at the Kalamata Municipal Conservatory and went on to attend The Greek National University in Athens, graduating in English Language and English Literature. He was persuaded to relinquish the classical guitar for a career in singing, and in 2000 was awarded the Alexandra Triandi Scholarship by the Friends of Music Foundation in Athens.
