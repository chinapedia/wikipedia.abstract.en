PAOLO AGOSTINO (or AGOSTINI; AUGUSTINUS in Latin; c. 1583 â€“ 1629) was an Italian composer and organist of the early Baroque era. He was born perhaps at Vallerano, near Viterbo. He studied under Giovanni Bernardino Nanino, according to the dedication in the third and fourth books of his masses. Subsequently, he married Nanino's daughter.

He held a series of positions as organist and _maestro di cappella_ (choirmaster) between 1607 and 1626, when he succeeded Vincenzo Ugolini as _maestro_ of the Cappella Giulia's choir in St. Peter's Basilica.

All of his surviving works are sacred music, and most are written in the _prima pratica_, the conservative polyphonic style of the late 16th century, although some of his motets use some of the new concertato style. He was a highly sophisticated contrapuntist, often using strict canonic techniques; in addition, he used colorful sonorities, changes of meter between sections, and colorful chromaticism, showing an acquaintanceship with contemporary secular practice as well as the work of the Venetian School. An _Agnus Dei_ for eight voices is especially admired and was used as an example in Padre Martini's _Saggio di Contrappunto_.
