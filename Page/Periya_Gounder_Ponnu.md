Sarathkumar) is an educated blacksmith and lives with his widow mother (Manorama), he is the future husband of Manjula as per the village custom. But Periya Samy doesn't want to get married to a man who belongs to a poor family, so he refuses Thangamuthu and Manjula's marriage.

Periya Samy slowly falls in love with the village belle Jillu (Jillu) and she becomes his secret mistress. He even accepts to marry his daughter with his mistress's rowdy brother (Vijayaraj).
