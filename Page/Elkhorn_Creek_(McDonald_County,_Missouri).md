ELKHORN CREEK is a stream in McDonald County in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] It is a tributary of Indian Creek.[2]

The stream headwaters arise at just east of Missouri Route 76 south of Longview. It flows southwest past Bethpage and then west-northwest to its confluence with Indian Creek south of McNatt at .[3][4]

Some say Elkhorn Creek was named for elk in the area, while others believe the name is a transfer from a creek of the same name in Letcher County, Kentucky.[5]
