G*POWER is a free-to use software used to calculate statistical power. The program offers the ability to calculate power for a wide variety of statistical tests including t-tests, F-tests, and chi-square-tests, among others. Additionally, the user must determine which of the many contexts this test is being used, such as a one-way ANOVA versus a multi-way ANOVA. In order to calculate power, the user must know four of five variables: either number of groups, number of observations, effect size, significance level (α), or power (1-β). G*Power has a built-in tool for determining effect size if it cannot be estimated from prior literature or is not easily calculable.
