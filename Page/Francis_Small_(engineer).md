ARTHUR FRANCIS SMALL (born 26 February 1946) is a retired New Zealand engineer. He served as the national president of Scouting New Zealand, as well as the vice-chairman of the Asia-Pacific Regional Scout Committee.[1]

Small was born in 1946,[2][3] He studied civil engineering at the University of Auckland, completing a Master of Engineering degree in 1969,[4] and a PhD in 1971.[5] His doctoral thesis, supervised by Arved Raudkivi, was titled _Hydroelastic excitation of cylinders_.[6]

Joining the New Zealand Railways Department in 1964, Small rose to become managing director of New Zealand Rail and its successor, Tranz Rail.[7] He retired from Tranz Rail in 2000 and was replaced, as managing director, by Michael Beard in May of that year.[8] Small was then vice-chairman for some time.[9] For his services to the transport industry and the community, he was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2000 New Year Honours.[10]

In 1999, Small was appointed by the National Government as one of three people on the high-profile INCIS inquiry into the failed computer system that had been ordered by New Zealand Police in the 1990s. Early in 2000 after a change to the Labour Government, the other two members were dispensed with and Small conducted the enquiry by himself.[11][12] Small's report on INCIS was published in November 2000.[13]

Small is a Distinguished Fellow of the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand (IPENZ) and was the group's president in 1996–97.[14][15] In 2013, he received the individual award from the Railway Technical Society of Australasia for outstanding service to New Zealand's rail industry.[16] In 2015, he funded the Francis Small Scholarship at the University of Auckland, available to civil, electrical, mechanical or chemical engineering students.[17]

In 1999, Small was awarded the 278th Bronze Wolf, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world scouting.[18]
