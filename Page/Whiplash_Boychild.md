_WHIPLASH BOYCHILD_ is the solo debut album by Scottish musician and singer-songwriter Chris Connelly, who is best known for his work for bands such as Ministry, The Revolting Cocks, and Pigface.[1] It was released in 1991 through Wax Trax! Records. The album also features session contributions from drummer William Rieflin,[2] and bass guitarist Stuart Zechman, who later reunited with Connelly on his next album, _Phenobarb Bambalam_ (1992).[3]

The record stylistically differs from Wax Trax!'s industrial music-indebted catalogue, incorporating influences from Scott Walker, David Bowie and Marc Bolan, as well as experimenting with avant-garde song structures.[4][5] It takes its title from a lyric from the Velvet Underground song, "Venus in Furs".[6]


Critical reception

AllMusic critic Ned Raggett considered the record as "a commanding and often quite surprising solo effort of equal power and delicacy," and wrote: "Compared with Marc Almond's splashy theatrics, Connelly is a little more abstract and restrained, approaching his material with a certain calm." Raggett also thought that the album's production was "remarkably clear, without ever being sterile or losing the impact of the music."[7] Ira Robbins of _Trouser Press_ gave the album a positive review, stating: "An ambitious lyricist who doesn't quite have poetry within his reach, Connelly is an able, mannered singer with some intriguing ideas."[8]
