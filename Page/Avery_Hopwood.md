JAMES AVERY HOPWOOD (May 28, 1882 – July 1, 1928) was an American playwright of the Jazz Age. He had four plays running simultaneously on Broadway in 1920.


Early life

Hopwood was born to James and Jule Hopwood on May 28, 1882, in Cleveland, Ohio.[1] He graduated from Cleveland's West High School in 1900.[2] In 1901, he began attending the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. However, his family experienced financial difficulties, so for his second year he transferred to Adelbert College. He returned to the University of Michigan in the fall of 1903, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1905.[3]


Career

Hopwood started out as a journalist for a Cleveland newspaper as its New York correspondent, but within a year had a play, _Clothes_ (1906), produced on Broadway. He became known as "The Playboy Playwright"[4] and specialized in comedies and farces, some of them with material considered risqué at the time. One play, _The Demi-Virgin_ in 1921, prompted a court case because of its suggestive subject matter, including a risque game of cards, "Stripping Cupid", where a bevy of showgirls teased the audience in their lingerie. The case was dismissed.

His many plays included _Nobody's Widow_ (1910), starring Blanche Bates; _Fair and Warmer_ (1915), starring Madge Kennedy (filmed in 1919); _The Gold Diggers_ (1919), starring Ina Claire (filmed in 1923 as _The Gold Diggers_, in 1928 as _Gold Diggers of Broadway_ and also as _Gold Diggers of 1933_); _Ladies' Night_, 1920, starring Charlie Ruggles (filmed in 1928); the famous mystery play _The Bat_ (with Mary Roberts Rinehart), 1920 (filmed in 1926 as _The Bat_, in 1930 as _The Bat Whispers,_ and in 1959 as _The Bat_); _Getting Gertie's Garter_ (with Wilson Collison), 1921, starring Hazel Dawn (filmed in 1927 and 1945); _The Demi-Virgin_, 1921, also starring Dawn; _The Alarm Clock_, 1923; _The Best People_ (with David Gray), 1924 (filmed in 1925 and as _Fast and Loose_ in 1930), the song-farce _Naughty Cinderella_, 1925, starring Irene Bordoni and _The Garden of Eden_ in 1927 (filmed in 1928 as _The Garden of Eden_).

Hopwood was asked to write the third act of Mary Roberts Rinehart's play _The Bat_.[5] Hopwood collaborated with Rinehart to then work on the last act of the play in Sewickley and sometimes in New York.[6]

The early sound film _The Bat Whispers_ played an influence on Bob Kane's Batman because the inspiration for Batman's costume came from the "mysterious Bat" character portrayed in the movie from 1930.[7]


Personal life

, 1924]] In 1906, Hopwood was introduced to writer and photographer Carl Van Vechten. The two became close friends and were sometimes sexual partners.[8] In the 1920s Hopwood had a tumultuous and abusive romantic relationship with fellow Cleveland-born playwright John Floyd.[9] Although Hopwood announced to the press in 1924 that he was engaged to vaudeville dancer and choreographer Rosa Rolanda, Van Vechten confirmed in later years that it was a publicity stunt. Rolanda would later marry caricaturist Miguel Covarrubias.

On July 1, 1928, at Juan-les-Pins on the French Riviera, Hopwood was accidentally drowned.[10] He was buried in Riverside Cemetery, Cleveland.[11] His mother, Jule Hopwood, inherited a large trust from him, but he had not made arrangements for the disposition of other items, including literary rights. While she was working through the legal issues with his estate, Jule Hopwood fell ill and died on March 1, 1929. She was buried next to her son.[12]


Legacy

Hopwood's plays were very successful commercially, but did not have the lasting literary significance he hoped to achieve.[13]

Hopwood Award

The terms of Hopwood's will left a substantial portion of his estate to his alma mater, the University of Michigan for the establishment of the Avery Hopwood and Jule Hopwood Creative Writing Awards. The bequest stipulated: "It is especially desired that students competing for prizes shall be allowed the widest possible latitude, and that the new, the unusual, and the radical shall be especially encouraged." Famous Hopwood award winners include Robert Hayden, Marge Piercy, Arthur Miller, Betty Smith, Lawrence Kasdan, John Ciardi, Mary Gaitskill, Edmund White, Nancy Willard, Frank O'Hara, and Steve Hamilton.

_The Great Bordello_

Throughout his life, Hopwood worked on a novel that he hoped would "expose" the strictures the commercial theater machine imposed on playwrights, but the manuscript was never published. Jack Sharrar recovered the manuscript for this novel in 1982 during his research for _Avery Hopwood, His Life and Plays_. The novel was published in July 2011 by Mondial Books (New York) as _The Great Bordello_.
