AEHOBAK (), also called KOREAN ZUCCHINI or KOREAN COURGETTE,[1][2] is an edible, green to yellow-green summer squash. Although nearly all summer squashes are varieties of _Cucurbita pepo_,[3] aehobak belongs to the species _Cucurbita moschata_.[4] Commonly used in Korean cuisine, an _aehobak_ has the shape of zucchini, but with thinner, smoother skin, and more delicate flesh.[5] It is usually sold in shrink-wrapped plastic.[6]

Cultivars of Korean zucchini include 'Seoulmadi', 'Bulam-sacheol', and 'Miso'.[7][8][9]


Culinary use

In Korean cuisine, the squash is used either fresh or dried. Fresh aehobak can be pan-fried, either julienned in batter into _buchimgae_ or sliced and egg-washed as _jeon_. It is often made into _namul_-_banchan_ (seasoned vegetable side dish), usually seasoned with salted shrimps and stir-fried. Sometimes, aehobak features as the main ingredient in stew dishes such as _jijimi_ and _mureum_. Dried aehobak, called _hobak-goji_, can be prepared by slicing the squash thinly and sun-drying the slices. It is soaked before cooking, then usually stir-fried to make a _bokkeum_ or _namul_.

The squash is also used in royal court dishes such as _seon_, and more recently in _wolgwa-chae_, replacing the Oriental pickling melon.
