]] HADDOCKS' EYES is a song sung by The White Knight from Lewis Carroll's _Through the Looking-Glass_, chapter VIII.

"Haddocks' Eyes" is an example used to elaborate on the symbolic status of the concept of "name": a name as identification marker may be assigned to anything, including another name, thus introducing different levels of symbolization. It was discussed in several works on logic and philosophy.[1]


Naming

The White Knight explains to Alice a confusing nomenclature for the song.

-   The song's NAME is CALLED _Haddocks' Eyes_
-   The song's NAME is _The Aged Aged Man_
-   The song is CALLED _Ways and Means_
-   The song IS _A-sitting on a Gate_

The complicated terminology distinguishing between 'the song, what the song is called, the name of the song, and what the name of the song is called' both uses and mentions the use–mention distinction.[2]


The song

The White Knight sings the song to a tune he claims as his own invention, but which Alice recognises as "I give thee all, I can no more". By the time Alice heard it, she was already tired of poetry.

The song parodies the plot, but not the style or metre, of "Resolution and Independence" by William Wordsworth.[3][4]

    I'll tell thee everything I can:
        There's little to relate.
    I saw an aged aged man,
        A-sitting on a gate.
    "Who are you, aged man?" I said,
        "And how is it you live?"
    And his answer trickled through my head,
        Like water through a sieve.

    

    He said "I look for butterflies
        That sleep among the wheat:
    I make them into mutton-pies,
        And sell them in the street.
    I sell them unto men," he said,
        "Who sail on stormy seas;
    And that's the way I get my bread –
        A trifle, if you please."

    

    But I was thinking of a plan
        To dye one's whiskers green,
    And always use so large a fan
        That they could not be seen.
    So, having no reply to give
        To what the old man said,
    I cried "Come, tell me how you live!"
        And thumped him on the head.

    

    His accents mild took up the tale:
        He said "I go my ways,
    And when I find a mountain-rill,
        I set it in a blaze;
    And thence they make a stuff they call
        Rowlands' Macassar-Oil –
    Yet twopence-halfpenny is all
        They give me for my toil."

    

    But I was thinking of a way
        To feed oneself on batter,
    And so go on from day to day
        Getting a little fatter.
    I shook him well from side to side,
        Until his face was blue:
    "Come, tell me how you live," I cried,
        "And what it is you do!"

    

    He said "I hunt for haddocks' eyes
        Among the heather bright,
    And work them into waistcoat-buttons
        In the silent night.
    And these I do not sell for gold
        Or coin of silvery shine,
    But for a copper halfpenny,
        And that will purchase nine.

    

    "I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,
        Or set limed twigs for crabs:
    I sometimes search the grassy knolls
        For wheels of Hansom-cabs.
    And that's the way" (he gave a wink)
        "By which I get my wealth--
    And very gladly will I drink
        Your Honour's noble health."

    

    I heard him then, for I had just
        Completed my design
    To keep the Menai bridge from rust
        By boiling it in wine.
    I thanked him much for telling me
        The way he got his wealth,
    But chiefly for his wish that he
        Might drink my noble health.

    

    And now, if e'er by chance I put
        My fingers into glue,
    Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot
        Into a left-hand shoe,

    

    Or if I drop upon my toe
        A very heavy weight,
    I weep, for it reminds me so
    Of that old man I used to know--
    Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow
    Whose hair was whiter than the snow,
    Whose face was very like a crow,
    With eyes, like cinders, all aglow,
    Who seemed distracted with his woe,
    Who rocked his body to and fro,
    And muttered mumblingly and low,
    As if his mouth were full of dough,
    Who snorted like a buffalo--
    That summer evening long ago,
        A-sitting on a gate.


Upon the Lonely Moor

Like "Jabberwocky," another poem published in _Through the Looking Glass,_ "Haddocks’ Eyes" appears to have been revised over the course of many years. In 1856, Carroll published the following poem anonymously under the name _Upon the Lonely Moor_. It bears an obvious resemblance to "Haddocks' Eyes."

    I met an aged, aged man
    Upon the lonely moor:
    I knew I was a gentleman,
    And he was but a boor.
    So I stopped and roughly questioned him,
    "Come, tell me how you live!"
    But his words impressed my ear no more
    Than if it were a sieve.

    He said, "I look for soap-bubbles,
    That lie among the wheat,
    And bake them into mutton-pies,
    And sell them in the street.
    I sell them unto men," he said,
    "Who sail on stormy seas;
    And that's the way I get my bread –
    A trifle, if you please."

    But I was thinking of a way
    To multiply by ten,
    And always, in the answer, get
    The question back again.
    I did not hear a word he said,
    But kicked that old man calm,
    And said, "Come, tell me how you live!"
    And pinched him in the arm.

    His accents mild took up the tale:
    He said, "I go my ways,
    And when I find a mountain-rill,
    I set it in a blaze.
    And thence they make a stuff they call
    Rowland's Macassar Oil;
    But fourpence-halfpenny is all
    They give me for my toil."

    But I was thinking of a plan
    To paint one's gaiters green,
    So much the color of the grass
    That they could ne'er be seen.
    I gave his ear a sudden box,
    And questioned him again,
    And tweaked his grey and reverend locks,
    And put him into pain.

    He said, "I hunt for haddock's eyes
    Among the heather bright,
    And work them into waistcoat-buttons
    In the silent night.
    And these I do not sell for gold,
    Or coin or silver-mine,
    But for a copper-halfpenny,
    And that will purchase nine.

    "I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,
    Or set limed twigs for crabs;
    I sometimes search the flowery knolls
    For wheels of hansom cabs.
    And that's the way" (he gave a wink)
    "I get my living here,
    And very gladly will I drink
    Your Honour's health in beer."

    I heard him then, for I had just
    Completed my design
    To keep the Menai bridge from rust
    By boiling it in wine.
    I duly thanked him, ere I went,
    For all his stories queer,
    But chiefly for his kind intent
    To drink my health in beer.

    And now if e'er by chance I put
    My fingers into glue,
    Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot
    Into a left-hand shoe;
    Or if a statement I aver
    Of which I am not sure,
    I think of that strange wanderer
    Upon the lonely moor.
