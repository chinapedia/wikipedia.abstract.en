Production

The film had a wrestling match between Dara Singh and King Kong. The producer said while the shooting of the match was in progress, he noticed blood oozing from King Kong's mouth. He was concerned and shouted, "cut, cut". But the wrestler King Kong wanted the blood to be seen in the film. King Kong almost hit the producer, but Dara Singh intervened and told him that he is the producer of the film, the producer reminisced in an interview later.

The producer said he had to burn copies of the film due to lack of storage facilities.[5] However, it appears some copies have survived.


Reception

_The Indian Express_ wrote, "Anjali Devi, Nageswara Rao and Baby Uma give a convincing display of a devoted wife, a distraught husband a love-lorn child".[6]
