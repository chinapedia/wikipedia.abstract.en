History

The municipality of Bjelland was created on 1 January 1902 when the old municipality of Bjelland og Grindum was split into Bjelland (population: 907) and Grindheim (population: 909). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Bjelland municipality was dissolved. The majority of Bjelland (population: 535) was merged with the municipalities of Laudal, Øyslebø, and a small part of Finsland to create the new municipality of Marnardal. At the same time, the Ågedal and Midtbø area of Bjelland (population: 96) was transferred to the municipality of Audnedal.[2]
