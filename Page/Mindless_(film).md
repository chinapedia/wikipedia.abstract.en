2007 was yet another positive year for the emerging Estonian cinema. At the end of 2006, celebrated theatre director Elmo Nuganen's comedy, Mindless (Meeletu), proved popular with audiences. In it, a millionaire decides to give up his fortune in order to settle for a simple life in the country. Audiences were drawn to the film's emphasis on a society polarised by haves and have-nots.

The film was made in the summer of 2006. It was released in Estonian cinemas on 5 October 2006.[2]
