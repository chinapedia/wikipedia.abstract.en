has the bright orange color characteristic of the dichromate anion.]] In chemistry, a SALT is a chemical compound consisting of an assembly of cations and anions.[1] Salts are composed of related numbers of cations (positively charged ions) and anions (negative ions) so that the product is electrically neutral (without a net charge). These component ions can be inorganic, such as chloride (Cl^(−)), or organic, such as acetate (); and can be monatomic, such as fluoride (F^(−)), or polyatomic, such as sulfate ().


Types of salts

Salts can be classified in a variety of ways. Salts that produce hydroxide ions when dissolved in water are called _alkali salts_. Salts that produce acidic solutions are _acid salts_. _Neutral salts_ are those salts that are neither acidic nor basic. Zwitterions contain an anionic and a cationic centres in the same molecule, but are not considered to be salts. Examples of zwitterions include amino acids, many metabolites, peptides, and proteins.[2]

Color

Solid salts tend to be transparent as illustrated by sodium chloride. In many cases, the apparent opacity or transparency are only related to the difference in size of the individual monocrystals. Since light reflects from the grain boundaries (boundaries between crystallites), larger crystals tend to be transparent, while the polycrystalline aggregates look like white powders.

Salts exist in many different colors, which arise either from the anions or cations. For example:

-   sodium chromate is yellow by virtue of the chromate ion
-   potassium dichromate is orange by virtue of the dichromate ion
-   cobalt nitrate is red owing to the chromophore of hydrated cobalt(II) ([Co(H₂O)₆]²⁺).
-   copper sulfate is blue because of the copper(II) chromophore
-   potassium permanganate has the violet color of permanganate anion.
-   nickel chloride is typically green of [NiCl₂(H₂O)₄]
-   sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate are colorless or white because the constituent cations and anions do not absorb in the visible part of the spectrum

Few minerals are salts because they would be solubilized by water. Similarly inorganic pigments tend not to be salts, because insolubility is required for fastness. Some organic dyes are salts, but they are virtually insoluble in water.

Taste

Different salts can elicit all five basic tastes, e.g., salty (sodium chloride), sweet (lead diacetate, which will cause lead poisoning if ingested), sour (potassium bitartrate), bitter (magnesium sulfate), and umami or savory (monosodium glutamate).

Odor

Salts of strong acids and strong bases ("strong salts") are non-volatile and often odorless, whereas salts of either weak acids or weak bases ("weak salts") may smell like the conjugate acid (e.g., acetates like acetic acid (vinegar) and cyanides like hydrogen cyanide (almonds)) or the conjugate base (e.g., ammonium salts like ammonia) of the component ions. That slow, partial decomposition is usually accelerated by the presence of water, since hydrolysis is the other half of the reversible reaction equation of formation of weak salts.

Solubility

Many ionic compounds exhibit significant solubility in water or other polar solvents. Unlike molecular compounds, salts dissociate in solution into anionic and cationic components. The lattice energy, the cohesive forces between these ions within a solid, determines the solubility. The solubility is dependent on how well each ion interacts with the solvent, so certain patterns become apparent. For example, salts of sodium, potassium and ammonium are usually soluble in water. Notable exceptions include ammonium hexachloroplatinate and potassium cobaltinitrite. Most nitrates and many sulfates are water-soluble. Exceptions include barium sulfate, calcium sulfate (sparingly soluble), and lead(II) sulfate, where the 2+/2− pairing leads to high lattice energies. For similar reasons, most alkali metal carbonates are not soluble in water. Some soluble carbonate salts are: sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and ammonium carbonate.

Conductivity

Salts are characteristically insulators. Molten salts or solutions of salts conduct electricity. For this reason, liquified (molten) salts and solutions containing dissolved salts (e.g., sodium chloride in water) are called electrolytes.

Melting point

Salts characteristically have high melting points. For example, sodium chloride melts at 801 °C. Some salts with low lattice energies are liquid at or near room temperature. These include molten salts, which are usually mixtures of salts, and ionic liquids, which usually contain organic cations. These liquids exhibit unusual properties as solvents.


Nomenclature

The name of a salt starts with the name of the cation (e.g., _sodium_ or _ammonium_) followed by the name of the anion (e.g., _chloride_ or _acetate_). Salts are often referred to only by the name of the cation (e.g., _sodium salt_ or _ammonium salt_) or by the name of the anion (e.g., _chloride salt_ or _acetate salt_).

Common salt-forming cations include:

-   Ammonium
-   Calcium
-   Iron and
-   Magnesium
-   Potassium
-   Pyridinium
-   Quaternary ammonium , R being an alkyl group or an aryl group
-   Sodium
-   Copper

Common salt-forming anions (parent acids in parentheses where available) include:

-   Acetate (acetic acid)
-   Carbonate (carbonic acid)
-   Chloride (hydrochloric acid)
-   Citrate (citric acid)
-   Cyanide (hydrocyanic acid)
-   Fluoride (hydrofluoric acid)
-   Nitrate (nitric acid)
-   Nitrite (nitrous acid)
-   Oxide
-   Phosphate (phosphoric acid)
-   Sulfate (sulfuric acid)

Salts with varying number of hydrogen atoms, with respect to the parent acid, replaced by cations can be referred to as _monobasic_, _dibasic_ or _tribasic_ salts (_polybasic_ salts refer to those with more than one hydrogen atom replaced):

-   Sodium phosphate monobasic (NaH₂PO₄)
-   Sodium phosphate dibasic (Na₂HPO₄)
-   Sodium phosphate tribasic (Na₃PO₄)


Formation

Salts are formed by a chemical reaction between:

-   A base and an acid, e.g., NH₃ + HCl → NH₄Cl
-   A metal and an acid, e.g., Mg + H₂SO₄ → MgSO₄ + H₂
-   A metal and a non-metal, e.g., Ca + Cl₂ → CaCl₂
-   A base and an acid anhydride, e.g., 2 NaOH + Cl₂O → 2 NaClO + H₂O
-   An acid and a base anhydride, e.g., 2 HNO₃ + Na₂O → 2 NaNO₃ + H₂O
-   Salts can also form if solutions of different salts are mixed, their ions recombine, and the new salt is insoluble and precipitates (see: solubility equilibrium), for example:

        Pb(NO₃)₂ + Na₂SO₄ → PbSO₄↓ + 2 NaNO₃


Strong salt

Strong salts or strong electrolyte salts are chemical salts composed of strong electrolytes. These ionic compounds dissociate completely in water. They are generally odourless and nonvolatile.

Strong salts start with Na__, K__, NH₄__, or they end with __NO₃, __ClO₄, or __CH₃COO. Most group 1 and 2 metals form strong salts. Strong salts are especially useful when creating conductive compounds as their constituent ions allow for greater conductivity.[4]


Weak salts

Weak salts or "weak electrolyte salts" are, as the name suggests, composed of weak electrolytes. They are generally more volatile than strong salts. They may be similar in odor to the acid or base they are derived from. For example, sodium acetate, NaCH₃COO, smells similar to acetic acid CH₃COOH.
