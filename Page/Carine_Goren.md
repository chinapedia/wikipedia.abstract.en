CARINE GOREN (; born 1974)[1][2] is an Israeli pastry chef, bestselling cookbook author, and television personality. She began her culinary career at age 26 as a recipe writer and editor at the Israeli food magazine _Al Hashulchan_ (Around the Table), and in 2006 published her first dessert cookbook, _Sweet Secrets_. As of 2016 she has published five cookbooks, including one for children, and is the host of her own television baking show, also called _Sweet Secrets_. In 2016, she became a judge on the new Israeli reality television show _Bake-Off Israel_. She has an avid fan base and was the most googled person in Israel in 2015.[3]


Early life

Growing up in Haifa, she was one of two daughters of a driving instructor and a stay-at-home mother.[4] Karin graduated from the Hebrew Reali School in 1992. She earned a B.A. in communication at the University of Haifa and married her high school sweetheart, Ronen Goren, at age 24.[5] The couple moved to Karmiel, where they both studied computers, but Carine felt dissatisfied and sought out courses in different arts and crafts.[6]

At age 26, she was fired from her job as a webmaster and used her severance pay to take a 12-week pastry-making course.[7] Deciding that pastry-making was her vocation, she began buying cookbooks and experimenting with dessert-making while working as a computer programmer for the Israeli food magazine _Al Hashulchan_ (_Around the Table_).[8] She brought her homemade desserts to share with her co-workers and was soon promoted to writer and editor, producing three dessert cookbooks for the publication.[9] In 2004 she began writing a weekly food supplement for _Maariv_.[10] She spent a year and a half as a recipe developer for cakes, cookies, and fancy baked goods at the Lehem Erez restaurant and coffee shop in Herzliya under the tutelage of Erez Komarovsky.[11]


Cookbooks

Goren self-published her first dessert cookbook, _Sweet Secrets_, in 2006.[12][13] Like her later books, the cookbook includes a DVD showing her demonstrating several recipes.[14] The success of the Hebrew-language cookbook led to a demand from overseas readers, and an English-language version of _Sweet Secrets_ was made available by mail order in 2010.[15] She later published _Sweet Secrets 2_ (2011) and several other titles, including a children's baking book.

Targeted to the home baker, Goren's recipes call for "simple" ingredients found in any neighborhood supermarket.[16] A _Haaretz_ reviewer opined that the success of her books, which spend months on bestseller lists, is due to her appeal to the "typical Israeli baker".[17] Recipes call for readily-available ingredients such as "tahina, toffee candies, halva and marshmallows", and feature baking equipment found in every housewares store.[18] Goren's recipes are often recirculated in newspaper cooking columns and online blogs.[19][20][21][22] She was the most googled person in Israel in 2015.[23]


Television personality

In 2007 Goren launched her own television baking show, _Sweet Secrets_, on Channel 2.[24] She previously hosted 15 episodes of _Guide to Baking with Carine Goren_ on Channel 10.[25][26]

In April 2016 she appeared as a judge in the first season of the reality television series _Bake-Off Israel_, a local version of _The Great British Bake Off_.[27]


Personal life

She met her husband, Ronen Goren, in high school; they married in 1998.[28] Like her, Ronen initially pursued a career in computers but became bored with it and became a professional chef instead.[29] He left his career to manage her brand, including her cookbooks, television show, website, and fan forum.[30] They reside in Herzliya.[31]
