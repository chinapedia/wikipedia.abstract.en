"GET A HAIRCUT" is a rock song by George Thorogood and the Destroyers. It was released as a single from the 1992 album _Haircut_.

The song was written by Bill Birch and David Avery. Thorogood recalls being at a club in Australia called the Black Marlin watching some of the performers. He liked "Get A Haircut", asked them who wrote it and decided to cover it.[1] Thorogood began playing the song in 1970, but only decided to record it in 1992 because he had trouble getting the riff down in the studio.[2]

It peaked at number 2 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks on August 28, 1992.[3] "Get a Haircut" was the No. 1 most played song in Canada on FM radio.[4] "Get a Haircut" has since become one of George Thorogood's signature songs, and has become a staple of classic rock radio.
