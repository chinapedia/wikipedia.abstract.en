SARINA BREWER is a Minneapolis-based American artist known for her avant-garde taxidermy sculpture and her role in the popularization of taxidermy-related contemporary art.[1] Brewer is one of the individuals responsible for the formation of the genre of Rogue Taxidermy,[2][3] a variety of mixed media art.[4][5] A primary directive throughout her career has been the use of ethically procured animal materials.[6]


Early life

Brewer's parents, also artists, raised her in an environment centered around wildlife and family pets. Her art arose from an interest in biology and nature.[7] She studied at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design (MCAD), earning a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1993.[8] During her formative years at MCAD she worked primarily with found objects, most of which were mummified animal remains.[9] Her early works were shrines to the animals they incorporated[10] and often involved the gold leafing of animal mummies,[11] a technique still utilized in her current body of work.[12] Her work with the remains of animals evolved into taxidermy over the years[13] and she is self-taught in this realm.[14] She states her work is an extension of her childhood belief in reincarnation and that her taxidermy sculptures serve as symbolic bodies for transmigrating animal spirits.[15][16][17] She describes the art she has created throughout her career as an hommage to the animals she uses.[18] Brewer is a conservationist and former wildlife rehabilitator[19] who volunteered in the biology department at the Science Museum of Minnesota for over a decade.[20]


Career

To form her own movement and break off from conventional taxidermy and its traditions, Brewer and two colleagues coined the term Rogue Taxidermy.[21] In 2004, Brewer and two fellow Minneapolis artists established The Minnesota Association of Rogue Taxidermists (MART),[22][23] an international collective of artists who use taxidermy-related materials (both organic and synthetic)[24] as the common thread to unite their respective styles of mixed-media sculpture.[25] The work of Brewer and the other founders of MART dramatically changed the way taxidermy materials are used.[26] The pioneering[27] work of Brewer and her fellow co-founders gained worldwide attention[28][29] in 2005 after they appeared on the front page of the New York Times art section[30] following their inaugural gallery exhibition. The article featured Brewer's taxidermy sculpture titled _Goth Griffin_.[31] Positive response from other artists following the exhibition led to the formation of the collective.[32] Public interest in the genre gave rise to an art movement.[33][34][35] Taxidermy art (a term used interchangeably with Rogue Taxidermy)[36] is a trend that started in Minnesota with the work of Brewer and fellow MART co-founders[37][38] and now has an international following.[39][40] An influx of people working within the genre has led to a taxidermy revival in recent years.[41]

Brewer maintains an ethical stance against traditional taxidermy culture.[42] She does not kill animals for the purpose of creating art[43][44] and she is noted as a trendsetter in this arena.[45][46] Her work is made from recycled animal components[47] salvaged from ethical sources such as natural deaths and road kill.[48][49] She brought this policy with her when she helped construct MART. Brewer and her fellow co-founders incorporated this precept into the group's ethics charter, to which members of the collective were required to adhere. MART's "no-harm-no-waste" approach was one of the genre's founding elements[50][51] and the use of ethically sourced materials has since become a tenet associated with the art movement[52] and broadened the art form to appeal to people who previously opposed taxidermy for moral reasons.[53]

Brewer is regarded as an influential figure within the genre[54][55] which has been noted for being largely female-driven,[56][57] and she is acknowledged for playing a role in the shaping of it aesthetically as well as ethically.[58][59] She has exhibited across the United States and has received international recognition.[60][61] Her work has been included in Midwestern, West Coast, East Coast, and European venues.[62] Among notable venues are the Los Angeles Art Show[63] and The Natural History Museum of Geneva.[64]
