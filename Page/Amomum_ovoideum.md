_AMOMUM OVOIDEUM_ is a widespread shade-demanding rhizomatous herb of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) native to Southeast Asia. It is perennial, producing leafy stems up to 3.0 m tall from a subterranean, long, and much-branched rhizome. The plant bears fruits up to 2Â cm long, covered by slender, soft, red spines. When dried, the fruit produces cardamom seedpods similar to other cardamom spice plants.


Distribution

_A. ovoideum_ is associated with dense and semidense forest habitats in Southeast Asia and is found growing in the wild in Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[1][2]

The habitat of _A. ovoideum_ is mainly lowland evergreen and deciduous forests, but also in evergreen montane forests; it has been observed growing at 30 to 1,550 m above sea level.[3]

In northern Laos, it is one of the most commonly found _Amomum_ species along with _A. villosum_, and is locally known as "green cardamom".[4] In Cambodia, it is known as _krakao_ and in Thailand as _reo daeng_.[5]


Uses

_A. ovoideum_ is considered a nontimber forest product in most of its range. In Laos and Cambodia, the fruits and seeds are collected and used both in traditional medicine and cooking.[6] In traditional Cambodian medicine, it is used to treat respiratory problems and digestive disorders.[7]

Generally, the plant is mostly harvested for its fruits and seeds on a seasonal basis only. In some areas, however, the entire plant is harvested; the rhizome is consumed and leaves are occasionally used for temporary shelters.[8] The whole plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine, such as _post partum_ saunas.[9]


Conservation

_A. ovoideum_ is generally not considered as a threatened species. However, several activities in larger parts of its range strain it and it is a species in decline.

Deforestation for expanding agriculture is the major threat for _A. ovoideum_. Logging in part of its range is reducing the crucial shade needed for it to thrive. The direct harvest of the plant, usually only comprises the fruit and seeds, but occasionally the whole plant is harvested. Some threat may exist from the overcollection of seeds, causing a loss in genetic variability.[10]

In Southeast Asia, herbal medicines and culinary plants are in high local demand and important for the local economies. This has led to a general overharvest of wild plants in the region. With the addition of a heavy deforestation (present and past) in all of Southeast Asia, a strain has been put on many wild-growing medicinal and aromatic plants. In the 2000s, this situation led to a large-scale project of introducing sustainable wild harvesting by the FairWild Foundation, known as the ISSC-MAP system. This project also comprises _A. ovoidenum_ in Cambodia. Local wild-harvesters and producers benefits by learning improved techniques, which in turn enhance product quality and market value.[11][12]
