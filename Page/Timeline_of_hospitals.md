  Ancient times        In ancient cultures, religion and medicine are linked. Ancient Egyptian temples are the earliest documented institutions aiming to provide healthcare. In ancient Greece, temples dedicated to the healer-god Asclepius, known as _Asclepieia_, function as centers of medical advice, prognosis, and healing.[1][2] Around 100 BCE, the Romans construct buildings called _valetudinaria_ for the care of sick slaves, gladiators, and soldiers.[3] Healthcare facilities also appear early in India.
  Middle Ages          From the 6th to the 10th century, in Europe, the infirmary becomes an established part of every monastery under the influence of the Benedictine Order. Beyond the 10th century, monastic infirmaries continue to expand, and public hospitals are also opened. City authorities, the church and private sources finance these facilities.[4] The primary function of medieval hospitals is to worship to God. Most hospitals contain one chapel, at least one clergyman, and inmates that are expected to help with prayer.[5][6]
  Islamic Golden Age   Many hospitals were developed during the early Islamic era. The idea of the hospital as a place for the care of sick people is taken from the early Caliphs.[7] Compared to contemporaneous Christian institutions, which were poor and sick relief facilities offered by some monasteries, the Islamic hospital was a more elaborate institution with a wider range of functions. Islamic hospitals tended to be large, urban structures, and were largely secular institutions, many open to all. The Islamic hospital served several purposes, as a center of medical treatment, a home for patients recovering from illness or accidents, an insane asylum, and a retirement home with basic maintenance needs for the aged and infirm.[8]
  18th century         The voluntary hospital movement begins in some parts of Europe.[9] The earliest contemporary hospitals begin to appear in China in the form of missionary hospitals run by western churches.[10]
  19th century         Hospitals and the medical profession become more professionalized, with a reorganization of hospital management along more bureaucratic and administrative lines. By the end of the century, the modern hospital begins to take shape with a proliferation of a variety of public and private hospital systems.[11]
  20th century         Middle-class patients enter the hospitals. Outpatient departments expand. Technological transformation of hospitals accelerate.[12]
  1950s                The role of hospitals evolves to centered health systems. Large hospitals start to be built.[13] Computer technology in medicine begins with the rise of the computers.[14]
  1970s                District general hospitals rise as local, secondary and tertiary hospitals.[15]
  1980s                Magnetic resonance imaging is introduced.
  1990s                Acute care hospitals (active short-stay care) and ambulatory surgery centers (expansion of both day admissions and minimally invasive surgery) consolidate.[16]
  2000s                Computing is generalized in hospitals. Robotics start to develop. Modern private hospitals begin to appear in some developing countries.[17]
