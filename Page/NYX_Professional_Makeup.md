NYX PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP () is a cosmetics company that is a subsidiary of L'Oréal. The company was founded in Los Angeles by Toni Ko in 1999. It was named after Nyx, the Greek goddess of the night.[1] NYX Professional Makeup is certified and acknowledged by Peta as a cruelty-free brand[2], and they offer a wide range of vegan-friendly products.[3] NYX products are sold in over 70 countries at thousands of retailers, ranging from specialty beauty and fashion stores to freestanding shops and the brand's own website.[4]


History

Founder Toni Ko's family moved to the United States from South Korea when she was thirteen. At age 25, she founded NYX Cosmetics in her 600 square foot building in California, using a $250,000 loan from her parents.[5] The first products developed and sold were jumbo eye pencils,[6] which brought in revenue of $2 million within the first year.[7] The products were initially sold only to beauty professionals before Ko expanded sale to mass-market outlets.[8] The products were marketed as having "department store quality" while being sold at "drugstore prices."[9] NYX is often considered a digitally native brand that continuously makes effective use of impactful social media and grassroots marketing tactics to promote their products[10], such as partnering with independent YouTube makeup artists and vloggers.[11]

Sales of NYX products increased during the economic slowdown in 2008, when consumers shopping for cosmetics at prices below those in high-end stores found similar NYX products at mass market outlets such as Sephora. Sales in 2014 were $120 million.[12] Ulta Beauty carries mass market NYX products.[13]


L'Oréal Acquisition

In 2014, Ko sold NYX to the international beauty company L'Oréal for $500 million.[14] The sale had a five-year non-compete clause[15]

NYX Cosmetics continues under other management as a part of L'Oréal, and now provides products including lipstick, lip gloss, and mineral foundation.[16] In September 2015, L'Oréal introduced brick-and-mortar stores devoted to NYX cosmetics.[17] NYX currently operates standalone stores in Australia, Austria, Armenia,Belgium, Canada, Estonia, France, Germany, India, Latvia, Lithuania, Spain, the UK, and the USA. In 2016, NYX reported annual sales growth of 4.7 percent and launched NYX Professional Makeup.[18]


Masterclass Program

In September 2018, NYX launched Masterclass, an exclusive online educational content library featuring a group of professional makeup artists and top beauty vloggers. The program aims to provide consumers of all skill sets with accessible, professional-grade makeup education.[19]


Partnerships

On March 6, 2019, NYX announced their first exclusive cosmetics sponsorship of the 2019 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The partnership will provide guests access to innovative digital beauty experiences on the festival grounds, ranging from an interactive beauty bar and touch up area fully equipped with glitter makeup and a glitter fountain, to a massive lip and tongue slide.[20]
