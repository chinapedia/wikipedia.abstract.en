A CLITIC (, backformed from Greek "leaning" or "enclitic") is a morpheme in morphology and syntax that has syntactic characteristics of a word, but depends phonologically on another word or phrase. In this sense, it is syntactically independent but phonologically dependent—always attached to a host.[1] The term derives from the Greek for _leaning_.[2] A clitic is pronounced like an affix, but plays a syntactic role at the phrase level. In other words, clitics have the _form_ of affixes, but the distribution of function words. For example, the contracted forms of the auxiliary verbs in _I'm_ and _we've_ are clitics.

Clitics can belong to any grammatical category, although they are commonly pronouns, determiners, or adpositions. Note that orthography is not always a good guide for distinguishing clitics from affixes: clitics may be written as separate words, but sometimes they are joined to the word they depend on (like the Latin clitic _-que_, meaning "and"), or separated by special characters such as hyphens or apostrophes (like the English clitic _’s_ in "it's" for "it has" or "it is").


Classification

Clitics fall into various categories depending on their position in relation to the word they connect to.[3]

Proclitic

A proclitic appears before its host.[4] It is common in Romance languages. For example, in French, there is "il S'est réveillé" ("he woke up"), or "je T'aime" ("I love you").

Enclitic

An enclitic appears after its host.[5]

-   Latin: Senatus _Populus_QUE Romanus



        "Senate _people_-AND Roman" = "The Senate and people of Rome"

-   Ancient Greek: _ánthrōpoí_ (TE) _theoí_ TE



        "_people_ (AND) _gods_ AND" = "(both) men and gods"

-   Sanskrit: _naro gajaś_ _'ca_ 'नरो गजश्च' i.e. "naraḥ gajaḥ ca" "नरः गजः च" with sandhi,:::"_the man the elephant and_" = "the man and the elephant"
-   Sanskrit: NamasTE < _namaḥ_ + _te_, (Devanagari: नमः + ते = नमस्ते), with sandhi change _namaḥ_ > _namas_.



        "_bowing to you_"

-   Czech: _Nevím, chtělo-LI BY SE MI SI TO TAM VŠAK také vyzkoušet_.



        "HOWEVER (_VŠAK_), I do not know (_nevím_), IF (_-LI_) IT WOULD (_BY_) want (_chtělo SE_) to try (_vyzkoušet SI_) IT (_TO_) TO ME (_MI_) THERE (_TAM_) as well (_také_)." (= However, I'm not sure if I would like to try it there as well.)

-   Tamil: _idhu en poo_ = இது என் பூ (This is my flower). With enclitic VĒ, which indicates certainty, this sentence becomes



        idhu en pooVĒ = இது என் பூவே (This is _certainly_ my flower)

-   Telugu: _idi nā puvvu_ = ఇది నా పువ్వు (This is my flower). With enclitic Ē, which indicates certainty, this sentence becomes



        Idi nā puvvĒ = ఇది నా పువ్వే (This is _certainly_ my flower)

Mesoclitic

A mesoclitic appears between the stem of the host and other affixes. For example, in Portuguese, _conquistar-SE-á_ ("it will be conquered"), _dá-LO-ei_ ("I will give it"), _matá-LA-ia_ ("he/she/it would kill her"). These are found much more often in writing than in speech. It is even possible to use two pronouns inside the verb, as in _dar-NO-LO-á_ ("he/she/it will give it to us"), or _dar-TA-ei_ (_ta_ = _te_ + _a_, "I will give it/her to you"). As in other Romance languages, the Portuguese synthetic future tense comes from the merging of the infinitive and the corresponding finite forms of the verb _haver_ (from Latin _habēre_), which explains the possibility of separating it from the infinitive.

Endoclitic

The endoclitic splits apart the root and is inserted between the two pieces. Endoclitics defy the Lexical Integrity Hypothesis (or Lexicalist hypothesis) and so were long thought impossible. However, evidence from the Udi language suggests that they exist.[6] Endoclitics are also found in Pashto[7] and are reported to exist in Degema.[8]


Distinction

One important distinction divides the broad term 'clitics' into two categories, simple clitics and special clitics.[9] This distinction is, however, disputed.[10]

Simple clitics

Simple clitics are free morphemes, meaning they can stand alone in a phrase or sentence. They are unaccented and thus phonologically dependent upon a nearby word. They only derive meaning from this "host".[11]

Special clitics

Special clitics are morphemes that are bound to the word they are dependent upon, meaning they exist as a part of their host. This form, which is unaccented, represents a variant of a free form that does carry stress. While the two variants carry similar meaning and phonological makeup, the special clitic is bound to a host word and unaccented.[12]


Properties

Some clitics can be understood as elements undergoing a historical process of grammaticalization:[13]

lexical item → clitic → affix[14]

According to this model from Judith Klavans, an autonomous lexical item in a particular context loses the properties of a fully independent word over time and acquires the properties of a morphological affix (prefix, suffix, infix, etc.). At any intermediate stage of this evolutionary process, the element in question can be described as a "clitic". As a result, this term ends up being applied to a highly heterogeneous class of elements, presenting different combinations of word-like and affix-like properties.[15]

Prosody

One characteristic shared by many clitics is a lack of prosodic independence. A clitic attaches to an adjacent word, known as its _host_. Orthographic conventions treat clitics in different ways: Some are written as separate words, some are written as one word with their hosts, and some are attached to their hosts, but set off by punctuation (a hyphen or an apostrophe, for example).

Comparison with affixes

Although the term "clitic" can be used descriptively to refer to any element whose grammatical status is somewhere in between a typical word and a typical affix, linguists have proposed various definitions of "clitic" as a technical term. One common approach is to treat clitics as words that are prosodically deficient: they cannot appear without a host, and they can only form an accentual unit in combination with their host. The term "POSTLEXICAL CLITIC" is used for this narrower sense of the term.[16]

Given this basic definition, further criteria are needed to establish a dividing line between postlexical clitics and morphological affixes, since both are characterized by a lack of prosodic autonomy. There is no natural, clear-cut boundary between the two categories (since from a historical point of view, a given form can move gradually from one to the other by morphologization). However, by identifying clusters of observable properties that are associated with core examples of clitics on the one hand, and core examples of affixes on the other, one can pick out a battery of tests that provide an empirical foundation for a clitic/affix distinction.

An affix syntactically and phonologically attaches to a base morpheme of a limited part of speech, such as a verb, to form a new word. A clitic syntactically functions above the word level, on the phrase or clause level, and attaches only phonetically to the first, last, or only word in the phrase or clause, whichever part of speech the word belongs to.[17] The results of applying these criteria sometimes reveal that elements that have traditionally been called "clitics" actually have the status of affixes (e.g., the Romance pronominal clitics discussed below).[18]

Zwicky and Pullum postulated five characteristics that distinguish clitics from affixes:[19]

1.  Clitics do not select their hosts. That is, they are "promiscuous", attaching to whichever word happens to be in the right place. Affixes do select their host: They only attach to the word they are connected to semantically, and generally attach to a particular part of speech.
2.  Clitics do not exhibit arbitrary gaps. Affixes, on the other hand, are often lexicalized and may simply not occur with certain words. (English plural -s, for example, does not occur with "child".)
3.  Clitics do not exhibit morphophonological idiosyncrasies. That is, they follow the morphophonological rules of the rest of the language. Affixes may be irregular in this regard.
4.  Clitics do not exhibit semantic idiosyncrasies. That is, the meaning of the phrase-plus-clitic is predictable from the meanings of the phrase and the clitic. Affixes may have irregular meanings.
5.  Clitics can attach to material already containing clitics (and affixes). Affixes can attach to other affixes, but not to material containing clitics.

An example of differing analyses by different linguists is the discussion of the possessive ('s) in English, some linguists treating it as an affix, while others treat it as a special clitic.[20]

Comparison with words

Similar to the discussion above, clitics must be distinguishable from words. Linguists have proposed a number of tests to differentiate between the two categories. Some tests, specifically, are based upon the understanding that when comparing the two, clitics resemble affixes, while words resemble syntactic phrases. Clitics and words resemble different categories, in the sense that they share certain properties. Six such tests are described below. These, of course, are not the only ways to differentiate between words and clitics.[21]

1.  If a morpheme is bound to a word and can never occur in complete isolation, then it is likely a clitic. In contrast, a word is not bound and can appear on its own.
2.  If the addition of a morpheme to a word prevents further affixation, then it is likely a clitic.
3.  If a morpheme combines with single words to convey a further degree of meaning, then it is likely a clitic. A word combines with a group of words or phrases to denote further meaning.
4.  If a morpheme must be in a certain order with respect to other morphemes within the construction, then it is likely a clitic. Independent words enjoy free ordering with respect to other words, within the confines of the word order of the language.
5.  If a morpheme’s allowable behavior is determined by one principle, it is likely a clitic. For example, "a" proceeds indefinite nouns in English. Words can rarely be described with one such description.
6.  In general, words are more morphologically complex than clitics. Clitics are rarely composed of more than one morpheme.[22]

Word order

Clitics do not always appear next to the word or phrase that they are associated with grammatically. They may be subject to global word order constraints that act on the entire sentence. Many Indo-European languages, for example, obey WACKERNAGEL'S LAW (named after Jacob Wackernagel), which requires clitics to appear in "second position", after the first syntactic phrase or the first stressed word in a clause:[23]

-   Latin had three enclitics that appeared in second or third position of a clause: _enim_ 'indeed, for', _autem_ 'but, moreover', _vero_ 'however'. For example, _quis enim potest negare?_ (from Martial's epigram LXIV, literally "who indeed can deny [her riches]?"). Spevak (2010) reports that in her corpus of Caesar, Cicero and Sallust, these three words appear in such position in 100% of the cases.[24]


Indo-European languages

Germanic languages

English

English enclitics include the contracted versions of auxiliary verbs, as in _I'm_ and _we've_.[25] Some also regard the possessive marker, as in _The Queen of England's crown_ as an enclitic, rather than a (phrasal) genitival inflection.[26]

Some consider the English articles _a, an, the_ and the infinitive marker _to_ proclitics.[27]

The negative marker _n’t_ as in _couldn’t_ etc. is typically considered a clitic that developed from the lexical item _not_. Linguists Arnold Zwicky and Geoffrey Pullum argue, however, that the form has the properties of an affix rather than a syntactically independent clitic.[28]

Other Germanic languages

-   Old Norse: The definite article was the enclitic _-inn_, _-in_, _-itt_ (masculine, feminine and neuter nominative singular), as in _álfrinn_ "the elf", _gjǫfin_ "the gift", and _tréit_ "the tree", an abbreviated form of the independent pronoun _hinn_, cognate of the German pronoun _jener_. It was fully declined for gender, case and number. Since both the noun and enclitic were declined, this led to "double declension". The situation remains similar in modern Faroese and Icelandic, but in Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, the enclitics have become endings. Old Norse had also some enclitics of personal pronouns that were attached to verbs. These were _-sk_ (from _sik_), _-mk_ (from _mik_), _-k_ (from _ek_), and _-ðu_ / _-du_ / _-tu_ (from _þú_). These could even be stacked up, e.g. "fásktu" (from Hávamál, stanza 116).
-   Dutch: _'t_ definite article of neuter nouns and third person singular neuter pronoun, _'k_ first person pronoun, _je_ second person singular pronoun, _ie_ third person masculine singular pronoun, _ze_ third person plural pronoun
-   Plautdietsch: _"Deit'a't vondoag?"_: "Will he do it today?"
-   Gothic: Sentence clitics appear in second position in accordance with Wackernagel's Law, including _-u_ (yes-no question), _-uh_ "and", _þan_ "then", _ƕa_ "anything", for example _ab-U þus silbin_ "of thyself?". Multiple clitics can be stacked up, and split a preverb from the rest of the verb if the preverb comes at the beginning of the clause, e.g. _diz-UH-ÞAN-sat ijōs_ "and then he seized them (fem.)", _ga-U-ǶA-sēƕi_ "whether he saw anything".

Romance languages

In Romance languages, some feel the object personal pronoun forms are clitics. Others consider them affixes, as they only attach to the verb they are the object of.[29] There is no general agreement on the issue.[30] For the Spanish object pronouns, for example:

-   _LO_' ATAMOS'' ("it''' tied-1PL" = "we tied it" or "we tied him"; can only occur with the verb it is the object of)
-   _dáMELO_ ("give ME IT")

Colloquial European Portuguese allows object suffixes before the conditional and future suffixes of the verbs:[31]

-   _Ela levá-LO-ia_ ("_She take-IT-would_" – "She would take it").
-   _Eles dar-NO-LO-ão_ ("_They give-US-IT-will_" – "They will give it to us").

Colloquial Portuguese of Brazil and Portugal and Spanish of the former Gran Colombia allow SER to be conjugated as a verbal clitic adverbial adjunct to emphasize the importance of the phrase compared to its context, or with the meaning of "really" or "in truth":[32]

-   _Ele estava ERA gordo_ ("_He was WAS fat_" – "He was very fat").
-   _Ele ligou É para Paula_ ("_He phoned IS Paula_" – "He phoned Paula (_with emphasis_)").

Note that this clitic form is only for the verb SER and is restricted to only third-person singular conjugations. It is not used as a verb in the grammar of the sentence but introduces prepositional phrases and adds emphasis. It does not need to concord with the tense of the main verb, as in the second example, and can be usually removed from the sentence without affecting the simple meaning.

Proto-Indo-European

In the Indo-European languages, some clitics can be traced back to Proto-Indo-European: for example, *__ is the original form of Sanskrit _च_ (_-ca_), Greek _τε_ (_-te_), and Latin _-que_.

-   Latin: _-que_ "and", _-ve_ "or", _-ne_ (yes-no question)
-   Greek: _τε_ "and", _δέ_ "but", _γάρ_ "for" (in a logical argument), _οὖν_ "therefore"

Slavic languages

-   Russian: ли (yes-no question), же (emphasis), то (emphasis), не "not" (proclitic), бы (subjunctive)
-   Czech: special clitics: weak personal and reflexive pronouns (_mu_, "him"), certain auxiliary verbs (_by_, "would"), and various short particles and adverbs (_tu_, "here"; _ale_, "though"). "_Nepodařilo BY SE MI MU TO dát_" "I would not succeed in giving it to him". In addition there are various simple clitics including short prepositions.
-   Polish: _-by_ (conditional mood particle), _się_ (reflexive, also modifies meaning of certain verbs), _no_ and _-że_ (emphasis), _-m, -ś, -śmy, -ście_ (personal auxiliary), _mi, ci, cię, go, mu_ &c. (unstressed personal pronouns in oblique cases)
-   Croatian: the reflexive pronoun forms _si_ and _se_, _li_ (yes-no question), unstressed present and aorist tense forms of _biti_ ("to be"; _sam, si, je, smo, ste, su_; and _bih, bi, bi, bismo, biste, bi_, for the respective tense), unstressed personal pronouns in genitive (_me, te, ga, je, nas, vas, ih_), dative (_mi, ti, mu, joj, nam, vam, im_) and accusative (_me, te, ga (nj), je (ju), nas, vas, ih_), and unstressed present tense of _htjeti_ ("want/will"; _ću, ćeš, će, ćemo, ćete, će_)

In Croatian these clitics follow the first stressed word in the sentence or clause in most cases, which may have been inherited from Proto-Indo-European (see Wackernagel's Law), even though many of the modern clitics became cliticised much more recently in the language (e.g. auxiliary verbs or the accusative forms of pronouns). In subordinate clauses and questions, they follow the connector and/or the question word respectively.

Examples (clitics – _sam_ "I am", _biste_ "you would (pl.)", _mi_ "to me", _vam_ "to you (pl.)", _ih_ "them"):

-   _Pokažite MI IH._ "Show (pl.) them to me."
-   _Pokazao SAM VAM IH jučer._ "I showed them to you (pl.) yesterday."
-   _Sve SAM VAM IH (jučer) pokazao. / Sve SAM VAM IH pokazao (jučer)._ "I showed all of them to you (yesterday)." (focus on "all")
-   _Jučer SAM VAM IH (sve) pokazao._ "I showed (all of) them to you yesterday." (focus on "yesterday")
-   _Znam da SAM VAM IH već pokazao._ "I know that I have already shown them to you."
-   _Zašto SAM VAM IH jučer pokazao?_ "Why did I show them to you yesterday?"
-   _Zar SAM VAM IH jučer pokazao?_ "Did I (really) show them to you yesterday?"
-   _Kad BISTE MI IH sada dali..._ "If you (pl.) gave them to me now..." (lit. If you-would to-me them now give-PARTICIPLE...)
-   _Što SAM god vidio..._ "Whatever I saw..." (lit. What I-am ever see-PARTICIPLE...)

In certain rural dialects this rule is (or was until recently) very strict, whereas elsewhere various exceptions occur. These include phrases containing conjunctions (e. g. _Ivan i Ana_ "Ivan and Ana"), nouns with a genitival attribute (e. g. _vrh brda_ "the top of the hill"), proper names and titles and the like (e. g. _(gospođa) Ivana Marić_ "(Mrs) Ivana Marić", _grad Zagreb_ "the city (of) Zagreb"), and in many local varieties clitics are hardly ever inserted into any phrases (e. g. _moj najbolji prijatelj_ "my best friend", _sutra ujutro_ "tomorrow morning"). In cases like these, clitics normally follow the initial phrase, although some Standard grammar handbooks recommend that they should be placed immediately after the verb (many native speakers find this unnatural).

Examples:

-   _Ja SMO i on otišli u grad._ "He and I went to town." (lit. I are and him gone to town) – this is dialectal.
-   _Ja i on SMO otišli u grad._ – commonly heard
-   _Ja i on otišli SMO u grad._ – prescribed by some Standard grammars

-   _Moja MU JE starija sestra to rekla._ "My elder sister told him that." (lit. my to-him is elder sister that say-PARTICIPLE) – standard and usual in many dialects
-   _Moja starija sestra MU JE to rekla._ – common in many dialects

Clitics are however never inserted after the negative particle _ne_, which always precedes the verb in Croatian, or after prefixes (earlier preverbs), and the interrogative particle _li_ always immediately follows the verb. Colloquial interrogative particles such as _da li_, _dal_, _jel_ appear in sentence-initial position and are followed by clitics (if there are any).

Examples:

-   _Ne vidim TE._ "I don't (or can't) see you."
-   _Dovedite IH._ "Bring them (over here)!" (a prefixed verb: _do+vedite_)
-   _Vidiš LI ME?_ "Do/can you see me?"
-   _Vidiš LI sestru?_ "Do you see the sister?" (It is impossible to say, e. g. **Sestru li vidiš?, although _Sestru vidiš._ "It's the sister that you see." is natural)
-   _Jel (ME) vidiš?_ "Do/Can you see (me)?" (colloquial)


Other languages

-   Arabic: Suffixes standing for direct object pronouns and/or indirect object pronouns (as found in Indo-European languages) are suffixed to verbs, possessive determiners are suffixed to nouns, and pronouns are suffixed to particles.
-   Finnish: Finnish has seven clitics, which change according to the vowel harmony: _-kO_ (_-ko ~ -kö_), _-kA_ (_-ka ~ -kä_), _-kin_, _-kAAn_ (_-kaan ~ -kään_), _-pA_ (_-pa_ ~ _-pä_), _-hAn_ (_-han ~ -hän_) and _-s_. One word can have multiple clitics attached to it: _onKOHAN?_ "I WONDER IF it is?"
    -   _-kO_ attached to a verb makes it a question: _Katsot televisiota_ "You are watching television" → _KatsotKO televisiota?_ "Are you watching television?"
    -   _-kA_ gives the host word a colloquial tone: _miten_ ~ _mitenKÄ_ ("how"). When attached to a negative verb it corresponds with "and": _En pidä mansikoista enKÄ mustikoista_ "I don't like strawberries NOR blueberries". It can also make a negative verb stronger: _EnKÄ tule!_ "I DEFINITELY won't come!"
    -   _-kin_ is a focus particle, often used instead of _myös_ ("also" / "as well"): _MinäKIN olin siellä_ "I was there TOO". Depending on the context when attached to a verb it can also express that something happened according to the plan or as a surprise and not according to the plan. It can also make exclamations stronger. It can be attached to several words in the same sentence, changing the focus of the host word, but can only appear once per sentence: _MinäKIN olin siellä_ ("I was there TOO"), _Minä olinKIN siellä_ ("SURPRISINGLY I WAS there"), _Minä olin sielläKIN_ ("I was THERE TOO")
    -   _-kAAn_ is also a focus particle and it corresponds with _-kin_ in negative sentences: _MinäKÄÄN en ollut siellä_ "I wasn't there EITHER". Like _-kin_ it can be attached to several host words in the same sentence. The only word it cannot be attached to is a negative verb. In questions it acts as a confirmation, like the word _again_ in English: _Missä sanoitKAAN asuvasi?_ "Where did you say you lived AGAIN?"
    -   _-pA_ is a tone particle which can either add an arguing or patronising tone, or strengthen the host word: _MinäPÄ tiedän paremmin!_ "Well I know better!", _OnPA kaunis kissa!_ "WOW what a beautiful cat!"
    -   _-hAn_ is also a tone particle. In interrogative sentences it can make the question more polite and not as pressing: _OnkoHAN isäsi kotona?_ "(I WONDER) Is your dad home?" In command phrases it makes the command softer: _TuleHAN tänne_ "Come here YOU". It can also make a sentence more explanatory, make a claim more self-evident, express that something happened according to one's expectations, or that something came as a surprise etc. _Pekka tuntee minut, onHAN hän minun opettajani_ "Pekka knows me, he is my teacher AFTER ALL", _KaikkiHAN niin tekevät_ "Everyone do so AFTER ALL", _MaijaHAN se siinä!_ "Oh but it is Maija!" _Luulin, ettette osaisi, mutta teHÄN puhutte suomea hyvin_ "I thought you wouldn't be able to, but you speak Finnish well"
    -   _-s_ is a tone particle as well. It can also be used as a mitigating or softening phrase like _-hAn_: _AnnikoS se on?_ "OH BUT isn't it Anni?", _TuleS tänne_ "Come here YOU", _MiksikäS ei?_ "WELL why not?", _PaljonkoS kello on?_ "I WONDER what time it is?"
-   Ganda: _-nga_ attached to a verb to form the progressive; _-wo_ 'in' (also attached to a verb)
-   Georgian: _-o_ (2nd and 3rd person speakers) and _-metki_ (1st person speakers) is added to the end of a sentence to show reported speech. Examples: _K'atsma miutxra, xval gnaxe-o_ = The man told me that he would see you tomorrow (Literally, "The man told me, tomorrow I see you [reported]") vs. _K'atss vutxari, xval gnaxe-metki =_ I told the man that I would see you tomorrow (Literally, "To man I told, tomorrow I see you [first person reported]).
-   Hungarian: the marker of indirect questions is _-e:_ _Nem tudja még, jön-E._ "He doesn't know yet IF he'll come." This clitic can also mark direct questions with a falling intonation. _Is_ ("as well") and _se_ ("not... either") also function as clitics: although written separately, they are pronounced together with the preceding word, without stress: _Ő is jön._ "He'll come too." _Ő sem jön._ "He won't come, either."
-   Japanese: all particles, such as the genitive postposition の (_no_) and the topic marker は (_wa_).
-   Korean: The copula 이다 (_ida_) and the adjectival 하다 (_hada_), as well as some nominal and verbal particles (e.g. 는, _neun_).

However, alternative analysis suggests that the nominal particles do not function as clitics, but as phrasal affixes.[33]

-   Somali: pronominal clitics, either subject or object clitics, are required in Somali. These exist as simple clitics postponed to the noun they apply to. Lexical arguments can be omitted from sentences, but pronominal clitics cannot be.[34]
