The BAY LEAF is an aromatic leaf commonly used in cooking. It can be used whole, or as dried and ground.


Sources

It comes from several plants such as:

-   Bay laurel (_Laurus nobilis_, Lauraceae). Fresh or dried bay leaves are used in cooking for their distinctive flavour and fragrance. The leaves should be removed from the cooked food before eating (see Safety section below). The leaves are often used to flavour soups, stews, braises and _pâtés_ in Mediterranean and Latin American cuisine. The fresh leaves are very mild and do not develop their full flavour until several weeks after picking and drying.[1]
-   California bay leaf – the leaf of the California bay tree (_Umbellularia californica_, Lauraceae), also known as California laurel, Oregon myrtle, and pepperwood, is similar to the Mediterranean bay laurel, but has a stronger flavour.
-   Indian bay leaf or malabathrum (_Cinnamomum tamala_, Lauraceae) differs in that bay laurel leaves are shorter and light to medium green in colour, with one large vein down the length of the leaf, while tejpat (_Cinnamonum tamala_) leaves are about twice as long and wider, usually olive green in colour, and with three veins down the length of the leaf and is culinarily quite different, having a fragrance and taste similar to cinnamon (cassia) bark, but milder.
-   Indonesian bay leaf or Indonesian laurel (_salam_ leaf, _Syzygium polyanthum_, Myrtaceae) is not commonly found outside Indonesia; this herb is applied to meat and, less often, to vegetables.[2]
-   West Indian bay leaf, the leaf of the West Indian bay tree (_Pimenta racemosa_, Myrtaceae), used culinarily and to produce the cologne called bay rum.
-   Mexican bay leaf (_Litsea glaucescens_, Lauraceae).


Chemical constituents

The leaves contain about 1.3% essential oils (ol. lauri folii), consisting of 45% eucalyptol, 12% other terpenes, 8-12% terpinyl acetate, 3–4% sesquiterpenes, 3% methyleugenol, and other α- and β-pinenes, phellandrene, linalool, geraniol, terpineol, and contain lauric acid also.


Taste and aroma

If eaten whole, bay leaves (_Laurus nobilis_) are pungent and have a sharp, bitter taste. As with many spices and flavourings, the fragrance of the bay leaf is more noticeable than its taste. When dried, the fragrance is herbal, slightly floral, and somewhat similar to oregano and thyme. Myrcene, which is a component of many essential oils used in perfumery, can be extracted from the bay leaf. They also contain eugenol.[3]


Uses

In Indian and Pakistani cuisine, bay laurel leaves are sometimes used in place of Indian bay leaf, although they have a different flavour. They are most often used in rice dishes like _biryani_ and as an ingredient in _garam masala_. Bay (laurel) leaves are frequently packaged as _tejpatta_ (the Hindi term for Indian bay leaf), creating confusion between the two herbs.

In the Philippines, dried bay laurel leaves are used in several Filipino dishes such as menudo, beef pares, and adobo.

Bay leaves were used for flavouring by the ancient Greeks.[4] They are a fixture in the cooking of many European cuisines (particularly those of the Mediterranean), as well as in the Americas. They are used in soups, stews, meat, seafood, vegetable dishes, and sauces. The leaves also flavour many classic French dishes. The leaves are most often used whole (sometimes in a _bouquet garni_) and removed before serving (they can be abrasive in the digestive tract). Thai and Laotian cuisine employs bay leaf (Thai name _bai kra wan_) in a few Arab-influenced dishes, notably massaman curry.[5]

Bay leaves can also be crushed or ground before cooking. Crushed bay leaves impart more fragrance than whole leaves, but are more difficult to remove, and thus they are often used in a muslin bag or tea infuser. Ground bay laurel may be substituted for whole leaves, and does not need to be removed, but it is much stronger.

Bay leaves are also used in the making of jerk chicken in the Caribbean Islands. The bay leaves are soaked and placed on the cool side of the grill. Pimento sticks are placed on top of the leaves and the chicken is placed on top and smoked.

Bay leaves can also be used scattered in a pantry to repel meal moths,[6] flies,[7] cockroaches,[8] mice, and silverfish.

Bay leaves have been used in entomology as the active ingredient in killing jars. The crushed, fresh, young leaves are put into the jar under a layer of paper. The vapors they release kill insects slowly but effectively, and keep the specimens relaxed and easy to mount. The leaves discourage the growth of molds. They are not effective for killing large beetles and similar specimens, but insects that have been killed in a cyanide killing jar can be transferred to a laurel jar to await mounting.[9] There is confusion in the literature about whether _Laurus nobilis_ is a source of cyanide to any practical extent, but there is no evidence that cyanide is relevant to its value in killing jars. It certainly is rich in various essential oil components that could incapacitate insects in high concentrations; such compounds include 1,8-cineole, alpha-terpinyl acetate, and methyl eugenol.[10] It also is unclear to what extent the alleged effect of cyanide released by the crushed leaves has been mis-attributed to _Laurus nobilis_ in confusion with the unrelated _Prunus laurocerasus_, the so-called cherry laurel, which certainly does contain dangerous concentrations of cyanogenic glycocides[11] together with the enzymes to generate the hydrogen cyanide from the glycocides if the leaf is physically damaged.[12]


Safety

Some members of the laurel family, as well as the unrelated but visually similar mountain laurel and cherry laurel, have leaves that are poisonous to humans and livestock.[13] While these plants are not sold anywhere for culinary use, their visual similarity to bay leaves has led to the oft-repeated belief that bay leaves should be removed from food after cooking because they are poisonous. This is not true; bay leaves may be eaten without toxic effect. However, they remain unpleasantly stiff even after thorough cooking, and if swallowed whole or in large pieces, they may pose a risk of harming the digestive tract or causing choking.[14] Thus, most recipes that use bay leaves will recommend their removal after the cooking process has finished.[15]

Canadian food and drug regulations

The Canadian government requires that the bay leaves contain no more than 4.5% total ash material with a maximum of 0.5% of which is insoluble in hydrochloric acid. To be considered dried it has to contain 7% moisture or less. The oil content cannot be less than 1 milliliter per 100 grams of the spice. [16]
