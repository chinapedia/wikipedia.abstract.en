The vegetation is mainly dense submontane and montane rainforest. Near the cave there is secondary growth forest in an advanced state of regeneration, mainly the _Myrtaceae_, _Fabaceae_ and _Rubiaceae_ families. The canopy is about high with emergents up to . On the slopes and higher up the forest is gradually replaced by herbaceous-shrubby fields. In a 2009 survey 154 species of trees were identified.

Birds of prey, larger mammals and fish are present in smaller numbers.
