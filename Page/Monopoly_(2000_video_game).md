_MONOPOLY_ is a 2000 computer game based on the board game _Monopoly_, released for Microsoft Windows & Macintosh. Developed by Artech Studios and published by MacSoft, this title was one of many inspired by the property dealing board games. A remastered version of the game entitled _Monopoly New Edition_ (also known as _MONOPOLY 3_[1]) was released on September 30, 2002, and published by Infogrames. A PlayStation Portable version was released in 2008.


Gameplay

The game contains very similar gameplay to the board game it is based on, with various physical tasks being replaced by automation and digital representations. It features a 1920s-style theme called Monopoly Song.[2]


Critical reception

Bill Stiteler of AppleLinks.com praised the game's customisation options, and ability to accommodate player-player and player-NPC games, though criticised its computer-animated graphics and voiceovers.[3] Mac Gamer reviewer Danilo Campos thought it was a solid adaption of the board game, but that it didn't make the physical version obsolete.[4] Richard Hallas of Inside Mac Games described the game's graphics as "spectacular", though noted the AI can sometimes interrupt a human player's move by making trades and offers.[5]

Meristation said _Monopoly New Edition_ praised the interface and customisation while describing the artificial intelligence as "artificial obstinacy".[6] Jeuxvideo.com thought the graphics were "simple", the gameplay "lack[ed] originality", its replayability was "limited", and the music was mostly "repetitive".[7] Impulse Gamer said it lacked the excitement of the board game and could become quite repetitive.[8] Computer Shopper said the title had the perfect mix of 3D graphics, animation, and sound.[9] Dan Adams of IGN wrote that the game lacked in imagination and creativity.[10] Game Over Online disliked the realistic looking design to the game.[11]

Greg Miller of IGN said the PSP version wasn't groundbreaking, but that it was enjoyable and fun.[12] PlayStation LifeStyle thought the game was simple yet fun.[13]
