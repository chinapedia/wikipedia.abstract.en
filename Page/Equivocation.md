In logic, EQUIVOCATION ('calling two different things by the same name') is an informal fallacy resulting from the use of a particular word/expression in multiple senses throughout an argument leading to a false conclusion.[1][2] Abbott and Costello's "Who's on first?" routine is a well known example of equivocation.[3][4]

It is a type of ambiguity that stems from a phrase having two distinct meanings, not from the grammar or structure of the sentence.[5]

Some examples of equivocation in syllogisms (a logical chain of reasoning) are below:

-   Since only man [human] is rational,

    and no woman is a man [male],
    Therefore, no woman is rational.[6]

-   A feather is light [not heavy].

    What is light [bright] cannot be dark.
    Therefore, a feather cannot be dark.

In the above example, distinct meanings of the word "light" are implied in contexts of the first and second statements.

-   All jackasses have long ears.

    Carl is a jackass.
    Therefore, Carl has long ears.

Here, the equivocation is the metaphorical use of "jackass" to imply a simple-minded or obnoxious person instead of a male donkey.
