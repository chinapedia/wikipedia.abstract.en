The CHON AIKE FORMATION is an extensive geological formation, present in the Deseado Massif in north-central Santa Cruz Province, Patagonia, Argentina. It covers an area of approximately and consists of rhyolitic volcanic rocks, particularly ignimbrites and lavas, with smaller amounts of agglomerates and tuffs.[1] Within dacitic rocks, plant fossils have been found.[2]


Description

The Chon Aike Formation forms part of the Chon Aike Province, also known as the Tobífera Series, a large igneous province that covers .[3]

The northern part of the formation, Río Pinturas, has been dated to the Late Jurassic (140–160 ), while the western and eastern sections have been dated to 162 ± 11 Ma and 168 ± 2 Ma respectively, indicating Middle Jurassic eruptions. Fossil flora, however, suggests a Middle to Late Jurassic age. (See La Matilde Formation.)[4]

During the break-up of Gondwana around 180–165 Ma, the opening of the Weddell Sea lead to extension along the western margin of the South American Plate, resulting in intra-plate volcanism in the Chon Aike area and rifting in the Magallanes Basin.[5] The Chon Aike volcanism was probably related to the subduction of the Pacific Phoenix and Farallon plates.[6]
