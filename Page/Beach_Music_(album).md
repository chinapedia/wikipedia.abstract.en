Critical reception

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, _Beach Music_ received an average score of 73, based on 18 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[2] AllMusic critic Marcy Donelson said, "Despite its experimental elements and trippy sensibility, _Beach Music_ is relentlessly intimate, moving, and hard to shake—a notable trait for a young if experienced recording artist."[3] _Spin_{{'}}s Sasha Geffen wrote, "Alex G has always found power in the broken and uncertain. He’s just gotten a lot braver about spinning that chaos into beauty."[4] The magazine later named it the tenth best album of 2015.[5] Sam Shepherd of _MusicOMH_ said, "_Beach Music_ will almost certainly push Alex G into the wider consciousness, and rightly so."[6] _The Guardian_{{'}}s Kate Hutchinson thought the album sounds "familiar, yet impossibly charming."

Sophie Weiner of _Rolling Stone_ stated, "By the time you've gotten used to _Beach Music_{{'}}s relaxed melancholy, it's become a much-needed refuge."[7] Writing for _The New York Times_, Jon Pareles said, "Alex G's narrators have often been traumatized, druggie, lovesick or inscrutable, and moving up the indie-rock circuit hasn't made his new songs any more outgoing. Just the opposite: They are more cryptic and withdrawn."[8] Stephen Jenkins of _The Line of Best Fit_ wrote, "Whether it haunts you, puts you in a dreamlike state, or simply makes you hum along, _Beach Music_ is an album which should be listened to without hesitation."[9] _Consequence of Sound_ writer Adam Kivel said, "_Beach Music_ feels like the work of an artist a few steps ahead of his audience, jumping to answer their expectations of a DIY darling taking on the trappings of a label."[10] _Pitchfork_{{'}}s Pat Healy said, "Complicated arrangements and gorgeous melodies reveal themselves to you as rewards for your patience. Over time, even the alien voices begin to sound natural, even inviting."[11]
