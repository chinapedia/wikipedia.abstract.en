Etienne_Pariset.jpg ÉTIENNE PARISET (5 August 1770, in Grand – 3 July 1847, in Paris) was a French physician and psychiatrist.

In 1805 he received medical doctorate in Paris with the thesis _Dissertation sur les hémorrhagies utérines_ ("Dissertation on uterine hemorrhages").[1] In 1814 he joined Bicêtre Hospital as a physician, where in 1819 he was named head of department for mental illness. In 1822 he was appointed perpetual secretary at the Académie Nationale de Médecine, a position he maintained up until his death. From January 1826, he was associated with the Salpêtrière Hospital, where he succeeded Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol as physician for the insane.[2][3]

In 1819–22 he distinguished himself in his work combatting yellow fever in Spain, and from 1828 onward, conducted research of infectious diseases in Syria and Egypt. In the latter country, he became good friends with archaeologist Jean-François Champollion.[4][5] Père-Lachaise_-_Division_27_-_Pariset_01.jpg - Division 27.]] In 1819 he became part of the _Commission pour l'amélioration du sort des aliénés_ (Commission for improving the lot of the insane), whose members included Esquirol, Philippe Pinel and Antoine-Athanase Royer-Collard. In 1845 he was a founding member of the Société Protectrice des Animaux (SPA), serving as its first president up until his death in 1847.[6][7][8]
