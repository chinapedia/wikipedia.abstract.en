RADAR (aka RadaR Rock Band) is a Washington, D.C. based indie pop-rock and dance band which formed in 2014. The group features singer and songwriter, Charles Maven (synthesizer, keyboard), Robzie Trulove (drums, percussion), Jay (guitar) and Joey Garcia (bass guitar). They say the name, RadaR, hearkens to actual Radars and how they function, stating that "people send frequencies into the world through every action they take and thought they have, leading to finding and being found by others on the same wavelength".[1] With the release of their first single, "Give Up on the Now" in May 2015, the band quickly began to garner traction, with over 15,000 views in weeks, hitting local Maryland radio stations including, 98 Rock, and various festivals, namely Baltimore's large Pride parade (opening for Crystal Waters and CeCe Peniston) and DC's Art All Night Event Jim Kaponey of the Chicagoist said of them, "it's just this sort of unexpected, totally under the radar (no pun intended) gem that makes music writing so rewarding..." in his blog.[2] New York's The Deli Magazine[3] Performer Mag[4] and Chicago's Faronheit[5] among others have been covering RadaR. The band has been recognized by the Songwriters Association of Washington with a finalist award for their single, "Any" in 2017[6], and Silver award of Rock/Alternative for their single, "Rage" in 2018.[7]
