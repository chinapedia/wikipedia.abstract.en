SIR PIZZA is a United States chain of pizza restaurants. Wendell Swartz opened the original restaurant in Lafayette, Indiana, in 1957 under the name of PIZZA KING. Sir Pizza was incorporated in 1965. In 1966, Robert Swartz, Wendell's brother, expanded Pizza King outside of Indiana under the name of "Sir Pizza".[1] In Indiana, they are franchised under the _Pizza King_ name, one of two chains in Indiana using that name.

Sir Pizza franchise rights have been sold in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Michigan, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania.[2]


Food and Advertising

Various Sir Pizza franchises market the pizza with the phrase "Good to the Very Edge",[3] which purports to reference the lack of a traditional crust in Sir Pizza pizzas. Specifically the pizza pies are "virtually flat with cheese, sauce, and toppings loaded all the way to the very edge."[4] Sir Pizza is unique in that it does not use more typical sliced pepperoni, rather the topping is ground into crumbles that are spread over the entire pizza, similar to sausage.[5]
