C. P. REGHUNADHAN NAIR is an Indian polymer scientist who served as the deputy director of the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (ISRO).


Biography

Nair took his Masters in Applied Chemistry from Cochin University of Science and Technology in 1979 and Doctorate in Macromolecular Materials from Louis Pasteur University, Strasbourg, France in 1989.

He worked at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (ISRO) from 1980 in different capacities, and retired as Scientist-H and Deputy Director in 2016. He was French Government Fellow for the period 1985-89 and CNRS visiting scientist in 1993 in France. As of 2016, he was UGC visiting professor at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) for a short while in year 2016 and currently KSCSTE emeritus Scientist in the same university.

He has published over 200 original research papers (including one full article in _Nature_ Group) and authored 7 books ( 3 in Malayalam) and 20 book chapters, in addition to more than 140 conference papers and 40 popular science articles. He is the inventor for 20 patents.He is the sole inventor for "FORMULE UNIQUE", the herbal mosquito repellent formulation being marketed in Kerala (India)

Nair's research has been mainly in fundamental polymer science. His areas of research include materials for space, polymer chemistry and propellants. He has also specialized in mission-oriented research and was an authority in chemical-related matters in ISRO. He was associated with the major programs of ISRO such as SRE, Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan, GSLV, GSLVmkIII. He was also the focal point for nanotechnology for space applications in VSSC. He has also worked to popularize chemistry through lectures and articles in periodicals and newspapers.His recent revelation on the usage of calcium carbide for artificial ripening of mangoes attracted a lot of debate.

He was president of the Society for Polymer Science, India, and the Indian Space Scientists' Association.


Awards

He is a recipient of Prof. Sukumar Maity Polymer Foundation Award for the period 1999-2000 and Prof. Santappa Silver Jubilee Award for the period for 2005- 2006 for outstanding Contributions to Polymer Science. The team led by Nair won the national innovation award of the Govt of India, petroleum ministry for the year 2014-15. He has received the ISRO individual merit award and the Dalmia-HEMSI award for the best propellant researcher.

He was awarded the Emeritus scientist fellowship by Kerala State Council for Science, technology and environment and work in this capacity at Cochin University of Science and technology, Cochin, India.
