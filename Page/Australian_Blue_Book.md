The 1942 (first) edition was edited by A. Moorehead,[1][2][3][4] and the 1946â€“48 (second) edition by W. J. Beckett [5][6] another part of the book was a supplement published in 1950.[7][8] Beckett was involved in a court case at one point.[9][10][11]

The book was published in Sydney, and contained comprehensive photographs of people in administrative positions, as well as material from Australians involved in the second World War. It had extensive listings of all the local government areas in Australia at the time, with names of officials and descriptions of the areas.

It was not related in any way to the other titles with state names, such as the _Western Australian Blue Book_ of the 1890s.[12]
