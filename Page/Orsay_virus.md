The ORSAY VIRUS is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that infects _Caenorhabditis elegans_ nematode. It resembles nodaviruses (family _Nodaviridae_), but has yet to be formally classified.[1]

Orsay virus has a (+)ssRNA genome consisting of two segments, termed RNA1 and RNA2. The RNA1 segment encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of 982 amino acids.[2] The RNA2 segment has two open reading frames (ORFs) that code for a capsid protein and a non-structural protein with unknown function.[3] The virus is composed of two structural domains, a shell (S) and a protrusion (P) domain.

The Orsay virus was discovered in 2011 in _Caenorhabditis elegans_ nematodes in rotting fruit in Orsay, France. Just before the time of the discovery, standardized methods were developed for the wild isolation of nematodes. Using these methods, _Caenorhabditis briggsae_ and _C. elegans_ nematodes were found that displayed abnormalities in the intestines, such as extensive convolutions of the apical intestinal border.[4] The lysate of infected nematodes was added to healthy nematodes, which led to infection. Since for the lysate a filter was used that only allows virus particles to penetrate, this suggested that a virus was the cause of the intestinal abnormalities. Electron microscopy showing viral particles confirmed the role of a virus.[5]

On infection of a susceptible nematode, the viral particles are mainly localized to intestinal cells.[6] The small structure of the Orsay virus, its resemblance to the well-studied nodaviruses and its tropism to intestinal cells of _C. elegans_, together with its lack of infectivity for humans, make the Orsay virus a useful virus for studying host–virus interactions.
