BMW () is a German multinational company which produces automobiles and motorcycles. The company was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines, which it produced from 1917 until 1918 and again from 1933 to 1945.

Automobiles are marketed under the brands BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce, and motorcycles are marketed under the brand BMW Motorrad. In 2015, BMW was the world's twelfth largest producer of motor vehicles, with 2,279,503 vehicles produced.[1]

BMW is headquartered in Munich and produces motor vehicles in Germany, Brazil, China, India, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

The registered company name is "Bayerische Motoren Werke AG". The Quandt family are long-term shareholders of the company, with the remaining shares owned by public float.

BMW has significant motorsport history, especially in touring cars, Formula 1, sports cars and the Isle of Man TT.


History

BMW AG originated with three other manufacturing companies, Rapp Motorenwerke and Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFw) in Bavaria, and Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach in Thuringia. The company is now known as BMW or Bayerische Motoren Werke. Aircraft engine manufacturer Rapp Motorenwerke became Bayerische Motorenwerke in 1916. The engine manufacturer, which built proprietary industrial engines after World War I, was then bought by the owner of BFw who then merged BFw into BMW and moved the engine works onto BFw's premises. BFw's motorcycle sideline was improved upon by BMW and became an integral part of their business. Souvenirs_from_BMW_Museum_Munich.jpg Museum souvenirs]] The initial products were exhibited in 1922 in Munich plant. These souvenirs were not intended for sale. It was resulted with the historical exhibition which was organized in 1966.[2] BMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1929 when it purchased Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which, at the time, built Austin Sevens under licence under the Dixi marque.[3] BMW's team of engineers progressively developed their cars from small Seven-based cars into six-cylinder luxury cars and, in 1936, began production of the BMW 328 sports car. Aircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director Franz Josef Popp, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production, with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture stopped altogether.

After the war, BMW survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles until 1948, when it restarted motorcycle production. Meanwhile, BMW's factory in Eisenach fell in the Soviet occupation zone and the Soviets restarted production of pre-war BMW motorcycles and automobiles there. This continued until 1955, after which they concentrated on cars based on pre-war DKW designs. BMW began building cars in Bavaria in 1952 with the BMW 501 luxury saloon. Sales of their luxury saloons were too small to be profitable, so BMW supplemented this with building Isettas under licence. Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars caused the BMW board to consider selling the operation to Daimler-Benz. However, Herbert Quandt was convinced to purchase a controlling interest in BMW and to invest in its future.

Quandt's investment, along with profits from the BMW 700, brought about the BMW New Class and BMW New Six. These new products, along with the absorption of Hans Glas GmbH, gave BMW a sure footing on which to expand. BMW grew in strength, eventually acquiring the Rover Group for the Mini brand before selling it to the Phoenix Group, and the license to build automobiles under the Rolls-Royce marque.


Branding

Company name

The name BMW is an abbreviation for _Bayerische Motoren Werke_ (). This name is grammatically incorrect, (in German, compound words must not contain spaces), which is why the name's grammatically correct form _Bayerische Motorenwerke_ () has been used in several publications and advertisements in the past.[4][5] _Bayerische Motorenwerke_ translates into English as _Bavarian Motor Works_.[6] The suffix AG, short for Aktiengesellschaft, signifies an incorporated entity which is owned by shareholders.

The terms Beemer, Bimmer and Bee-em are sometimes used slang for BMW in the English language[7][8] and are sometimes used interchangeably for cars and motorcycles.[9][10][11]

Logo

The circular blue and white BMW logo or roundel evolved from the circular Rapp Motorenwerke company logo, from which the BMW company grew, combined with the blue and white colors of the flag of Bavaria.[12] The BMW logo still used today was created in 1917, albeit with various minor styling changes.[13]

The origin of the logo is often thought to be a portrayal of the movement of an aircraft propeller with the white blades cutting through a blue sky. However, this portrayal was first used in a BMW advertisement in 1929 – twelve years after the logo was created – so this is not the origin of the logo itself.[14]

Slogan

The slogan ’The Ultimate Driving Machine’ was first used in North America in 1974.[15][16] In 2010, this long-lived campaign was mostly supplanted by a campaign intended to make the brand more approachable and to better appeal to women, ’Joy’. By 2012 BMW had returned to ’The Ultimate Driving Machine’.[17]

April Fools' Day pranks

BMW has garnered a reputation in Britain over the years for its April Fools pranks, which are printed in the press there every year. In 2010, they ran an advertisement in _The Guardian_ announcing that customers would be able to order BMWs with different coloured badges to show their affiliation with the political party they supported.[18]


Finances

For the fiscal year 2017, BMW reported earnings of EUR 8.620 billion, with an annual revenue of EUR 98.678 billion, an increase of 4.8% over the previous fiscal cycle.[19] BMW's shares traded at over €77 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at US 55.3 billion in November 2018.[20]

Motorcycles

R32-pn.jpg motorcycle, the first BMW motor vehicle.]] 2015_R1200RT_right.jpg]] BMW began production of motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after World War I.[21] Its motorcycle brand is now known as BMW Motorrad. Their first successful motorcycle after the failed Helios and Flink, was the "R32" in 1923, though production originally began in 1921.[22] This had a "boxer" twin engine, in which a cylinder projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the R Series.

The entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.

During the Second World War, BMW produced the BMW R75 motorcycle with a sidecar attached. Having a unique design copied by the Zündapp KS750, its sidecar wheel was also motor-driven. Combined with a lockable differential, this made the vehicle very capable off-road, an equivalent in many ways to the jeep.

In 1982, came the K Series, shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven F and G series with single and parallel twin Rotax engines.

In the early 1990s, BMW updated the airhead Boxer engine which became known as the oilhead. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170 cc and enhanced performance to for the R1200GS, compared to of the previous R1150GS. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing , respectively.

In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing , derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.

BMW introduced anti-lock brakes on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of electronic stability control, or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.

BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an Earles fork, front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called swinging arm). Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.

BMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.

In September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the technology to help improve road safety. [23] The design of the bike was inspired by the company's BMW R1200 GS model. [24]

The BMW i is a sub-brand of BMW founded in 2011 to design and manufacture plug-in electric vehicles.[26][27] The sub-brand initial plans called for the release of two vehicles; series production of the BMW i3 all-electric car began in September 2013,[28] and the market launch took place in November 2013 with the first retail deliveries in Germany.[29] The BMW i8 sports plug-in hybrid car was launched in Germany in June 2014.[30]

In 2014, BMW developed a prototype of street lights equipped with power sockets to charge electric cars, called _Light and Charge_.[31] Two of these charging facilities were installed at BMW's headquarters in Munich.[32] In 2015, BMW in cooperation with SCHERM Group has started deploying electric trucks on European roads, making it the first company to ever do so. The truck itself is manufactured by the Terberg Group, one of the world's largest independent specialist vehicle suppliers.[33][34][35]

Combined sales of the BMW i brand models reached the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016.[36] Two years after its introduction, the BMW i3 ranked as the world's third best selling all-electric car in history.[37] Global sales of the BMW i3 achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.[38]

In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which will be given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand. The new designation will be used first on the plug-in hybrid variants of the latest BMW 7 Series.[39] Global sales of all BMW plug-in electrified models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, consisting of more than 60,000 BMW i3s, over 10,000 BMW i8s, and about 30,000 from combined sales of all BMW iPerformance plug-in hybrid models.[40]

, four BMW electrified models have been released, the BMW X5 xDrive40e iPerformance, BMW 225xe iPerformance Active Tourer, BMW 330e iPerformance, and the BMW 740e iPerformance.[41] The BMW 530e iPerformance is scheduled to be released in Europe March 2017 as part of the upcoming seventh generation BMW 5 Series lineup.[42] Global sales of all plug-in electrified models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, consisting of more than 60,000 i3s, over 10,000 i8s, and about 30,000 from combined sales of all BMW iPerformance plug-in hybrid models.[43] Combined global sales of BMW's electrified models totaled more than 62,000 units in 2016,[44] and 103,080 in 2017, including MINI brand electrified vehicles.[45] Cumulative global sales of BMW Group’s electrified vehicles passed the 250,000 unit milestone in April 2018.[46]

Involvement in the arts

Art Cars

In 1975, sculptor Alexander Calder was commissioned to paint the BMW 3.0 CSL racing car driven by Hervé Poulain at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, which became the first in the series of BMW Art Cars. Since Calder's work of art, many other renowned artists throughout the world have created BMW Art Cars, including David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, and Andy Warhol.[49] To date, a total of 19 BMW Art Cars, based on both racing and regular production vehicles, have been created.

Architecture

4_cilindros_y_museo_BMW,_Múnich,_Alemania_2012-04-28,_DD_02.JPG The global BMW Headquarters in Munich represents the cylinder head of a 4-cylinder engine. It was designed by Karl Schwanzer and was completed in 1972. The building has become a European icon[50] and was declared a protected historic building in 1999. The main tower consists of four vertical cylinders standing next to and across from each other. Each cylinder is divided horizontally in its center by a mold in the facade. Notably, these cylinders do not stand on the ground; they are suspended on a central support tower.

BMW Museum is a futuristic cauldron-shaped building, which was also designed by Karl Schwanzer and opened in 1972.[51] The interior has a spiral theme and the roof is a 40-metre diameter BMW logo.

BMW Welt, the company's exhibition space in Munich, was designed by Coop Himmelb(l)au and opened in 2007. It includes a showroom and lifting platforms where a customer's new car is theatrically unveiled to the customer.[52]

Film

In 2001 and 2002, BMW produced a series of 8 short films called The Hire, which had plots based around BMW models being driven to extremes by Clive Owen.[53] The directors for The Hire included Guy Ritchie, John Woo, John Frankenheimer and Ang Lee. In 2016, a ninth film in the series was released.

The 2006 "BMW Performance Series" was a marketing event geared to attract black car buyers. It consisted of seven concerts by jazz musician Mike Phillips, and screenings of films by black filmmakers.[54][55]

Visual arts

BMW was the principal sponsor of the 1998 _The Art of the Motorcycle_ exhibition at various Guggenheim museums, though the financial relationship between BMW and the Guggenheim Foundation was criticised in many quarters.[56][57]

In 2012, BMW began sponsoring Independent Collectors production of the _BMW Art Guide_, which is the first global guide to private and publicly accessible collections of contemporary art worldwide.[58] The fourth edition, released in 2016, features 256 collections from 43 countries.[59]

Major issues/recalls

In November 2016, BMW recalled 136,000 2007–2012 model year U.S. cars for fuel pump wiring problems possibly resulting in fuel leak and engine stalling or restarting issues.[69]

In May 2017, ABC News reported on an investigation, in which they found dozens of instances of parked BMW cars catching fire, including some parked in home garages.[70]

In November 2017, BMW recalled roughly a million cars and SUVs for fire risk. One recall was for 672,000 3 Series cars from model years 2006–11 with climate control system electronic components at risk of overheating. The second recall was for 740,000 six-cylinder models (328i, 525i), at risk of crankcase heating short-circuit; some Series 3 cars were subject to both recalls.[71]

In August 2018, the government of South Korea announced the ban of BMW vehicles on the country's roads after 39 of the manufacturer's cars caught fire.[72] In response, BMW recalled 106,000 diesel vehicles in South Korea with a defective exhaust gas recirculation module, then expanded the recall to 324,000 more cars in Europe.[73]

In August 6, 2018, it has been reported that the rate of such accident is 0.10% in South Korea, and about 0.12% worldwide, which is about one problem in 1000 vehicles. According to JTBC (a South Korean TV channel), BMW Korea was fully aware of this problem and they had reported to BMW's headquarters,[74] which gave rise to an issue of the company's lack of response toward this problem. Eventually, the owners of BMW vehicles have sued BMW staffs of violation of vehicle management law, questioning their defect concealment of vehicles [75]

Since 1999, BMW has been named the world's most sustainable automotive company every year by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[98] The BMW Group is one of three automotive companies to be featured every year in the index.[99] In 2001, the BMW Group committed itself to the United Nations Environment Programme, the UN Global Compact and the Cleaner Production Declaration. It was also the first company in the automotive industry to appoint an environmental officer, in 1973.[100] BMW is a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.[101]

In 2012, BMW was the highest automotive company in the Carbon Disclosure Project's Global 500 list, with a score of 99 out of 100.[102][103] The BMW Group was rated the most sustainable DAX 30 company by Sustainalytics in 2012.[104]

Overseas subsidiaries

Production facilities

The first BMW production facility in China was opened in 2004, as a result of a joint venture between BMW and Brilliance Auto.[110][111] The plant was opened in the Shenyang industrial area and produces 3 Series and 5 Series models for the Chinese market.[112][113] In 2012, a second factory was opened in Shenyang.[114]

Between January and November 2014, BMW sold 415,200 vehicles in China, through a network of over 440 BMW stores and 100 Mini stores.[115]

Hungary

On 31 July 2018, BMW announced to build 1 billion euro car factory in Hungary. The plant, to be built near Debrecen, will have a production capacity of 150,000 cars a year.[116]

South Africa

BMWs have been assembled in South Africa since 1968,[118] when Praetor Monteerders’ plant was opened in Rosslyn, near Pretoria. BMW initially bought shares in the company, before fully acquiring it in 1975; in so doing, the company became _BMW South Africa_, the first wholly owned subsidiary of BMW to be established outside Germany. Unlike United States manufacturers, such as Ford and GM, which divested from the country in the 1980s, BMW retained full ownership of its operations in South Africa.

Following the end of apartheid in 1994, and the lowering of import tariffs, BMW South Africa ended local production of the 5 Series and 7 Series, in order to concentrate on production of the 3 Series for the export market. South African–built BMWs are now exported to right hand drive markets including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, as well as Sub-Saharan Africa. Since 1997, BMW South Africa has produced vehicles in left-hand drive for export to Taiwan, the United States and Iran, as well as South America.

Three unique models that BMW Motorsport created for the South African market were the E23 M745i (1983), which used the M88 engine from the BMW M1, the BMW 333i (1986), which added a six-cylinder 3.2-litre M30 engine to the E30,[119] and the E30 BMW 325is (1989) which was powered by an Alpina-derived 2.7-litre engine.

BMWs with a VIN starting with "NC0" are manufactured in South Africa.
