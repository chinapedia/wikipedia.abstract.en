EZRI KONSA NGOYO (born 23 October 1997) is an English professional footballer who plays as a central defender for Aston Villa. He came to prominence at Charlton Athletic and is an England U21 international.


Club career

Charlton Athletic

A central defender, Konsa began his career with Senrab and joined Charlton Athletic at the age of 11.[1] He began a scholarship in July 2014 and progressed sufficiently to sign a "long term" professional contract on 11 December 2015.[2][3] Eight days later, he received his maiden call into the first team squad for a Championship match versus Burnley and remained an unused substitute during the 4–0 defeat.[4] Konsa was an unused substitute on one further occasion during the 2015–16 season,[5] which culminated in the Addicks' relegation to League One.[6]

Konsa broke into the first team squad during the 2016–17 pre-season and made his professional debut with a start in a 1–0 EFL Cup first round defeat to Cheltenham Town on 9 August 2016.[7][8] He was a regular throughout the 2016–17 season and finished the campaign with 39 appearances.[9] He also showed his versatility by deputising in midfield and at full back.[10] For his efforts, Konsa was named the club's Young Player of the Year.[11] He signed a new three-year contract in March 2017 and was again a regular during the 2017–18 season,[12] making 47 appearances as Charlton reached the League One play-off semi-finals.[13][14] He departed Charlton Athletic in June 2018,[15] having made 86 appearances during two-and-a-half seasons as a professional at The Valley.[16]

Brentford

On 12 June 2018, Konsa moved across London to join Championship club Brentford on a three-year contract, with a one-year option, for an undisclosed fee,[17] reported to be £2.5 million.[18] He was a first-choice in central defence throughout the 2018–19 season and he scored the first senior goal of his career in a 3–0 victory over Preston North End on the final day.[19]

Aston Villa

On 11 July 2019, Konsa moved to newly promoted Premier League club Aston Villa, for an undisclosed fee[20]. The move reunited Konsa with Dean Smith, who signed him for Brentford one year earlier, and Richard O'Kelly.


International career

U21

Konsa was named in the U21 squad for the 2018 Toulon Tournament and made two appearances.[21][22] He was an unused substitute during the 2–1 victory over Mexico in the Final.[23] Konsa scored his first international goal on his fourth cap, in a 7–0 2019 European U21 Championship qualifying win over Andorra on 11 October 2018.[24] He was named in the squad for the tournament finals,[25] but made just one appearance, as a substitute in the Young Lions' dead rubber final group stage match.[26]


Personal life

Konsa was born to a Congolese (DRC) father and an Angolan mother.[27] He attended Harris Academy Greenwich and is a Tottenham Hotspur supporter.[28][29]
