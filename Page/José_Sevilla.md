Political and economic views

Savings banks

In an interview on Bankia's restructuring in August 2015, he stated: "The first thing we did when we came here was to change all the board members. Our challenge was to change the corporate governance, change the board with no link at all to politicians, to technocrats," he said. "For us, no politicians on the board was a must. We don’t want to have any political influence. We analysed the CVs of board candidates looking for political connections. If we found it, it was 'No’."

Sevilla stated that market discipline was not something many savings banks knew or cared about. "It was not clear who were the owners of these entities. They were not listed, they did not have shares. The traditional owners of the cajas were the depositors. Their status was very unclear." He continued: "The boards of these entities didn’t feel any special responsibility, they were growing and didn’t perceive any difficulty and were not aware of the potential consequences of their actions, or their inaction."[5]
