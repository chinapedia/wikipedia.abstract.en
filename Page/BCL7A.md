B-CELL CLL/LYMPHOMA 7 PROTEIN FAMILY MEMBER A is a protein that in humans is encoded by the BCL7A gene. [1]


Function

This gene is directly involved, with Myc and IgH, in a three-way gene translocation in a Burkitt lymphoma cell line. As a result of the gene translocation, the N-terminal region of the gene product is disrupted, which is thought to be related to the pathogenesis of a subset of high-grade B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The N-terminal segment involved in the translocation includes the region that shares a strong sequence similarity with those of BCL7B and BCL7C. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
