WILLIAM PIETZ (born 1951) is an intellectual historian and political activist. His account of the colonial origins of the concept of fetishism has been characterized as "brilliant"[1] and "fundamental".[2] David Graeber has characterised Pietz as "one of those rarest of people – an independent scholar whose ideas have had a profound effect on the academy".[3]


Life

Pietz completed his PhD at the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1988.[4] He has taught at Pitzer College, the University of California at Santa Cruz and Georgetown University.[5]
