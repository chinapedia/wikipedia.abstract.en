FASIL KENEMA SPORT CLUB (Amharic: ፋሲል ከነማ ) is an Ethiopian Sport club based in Gondar, Ethiopia. They are a member of the Ethiopian Football Federation and play in the Ethiopian Premier League, the top division of football in Ethiopia.


History

Fasil Kenema Sport Club is one of the oldest organized sport teams in Ethiopia. Established in 1960 (Ethiopian Calendar) in the historic city of Gondar, Fasil Kenema served as the first and only sport club for many years. The club is named after the 17th century Ethiopian Emperor Fasilides who ruled Ethiopia from its then capital city Gondar. Having played for many years in the second division of Ethiopian football, the Ethiopian Higher League, the club earned its first promotion to the Premier League after the 2006-07 season (2000 E.C.). However, the club's stay in the top tier of Ethiopian football would be shortlived as the club was relegated back to the Higher League after their inaugural 2007-08 season. It would take the club a further 8 years to reach the Premier League again by virtue of becoming champions of the 2015-16 (2008 E.C.) Ethiopian Higher League.

In 2018 the club hired a new manager Webetu Abate.

Premier League

In their inaugural campaign during the 2007-08 season, Fasil Kenema struggled to keep pace with most of the clubs which resulted in them being relegated at seasons end.

Currently the team is enjoying its second stint in the Ethiopian Premier League having promoted to the league after the 2015-16 season.[1] Fasil Kenema was able to place in 6th place in the 2016-2017 Premier League Season securing their stay in the top tier.

Fasil Kenema were involved in one of the more infamous plays of the 2017-18 Season, when during a game against Welwalo Adigrat they became the beneficiaries of an bizarre own goal by the Welwalo Adigrat goalkeeper. The goal was crucial as it turned out to be the winner, handing Fasil Kenema all 3 points.[2]

Fasil Kenema plays their home matches at Fasiledes Stadium in Gondar, Ethiopia.[3] Named after the cities founder, Emperor Fasiledes, it has served the club since its creation in 1960 E.C.
