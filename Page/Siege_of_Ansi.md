The SIEGE OF ANSI was a battle between Goguryeo and Tang forces in Ansi, a fortress in the Liaodong Peninsula, and a part of the First campaign in the Goguryeo–Tang War. The confrontation had lasted for about 3 months from 20 June 645 to 18 September 645.[1]


Background

On the 1st of April 645, under the pretext of marching to camp Huaiyuan, Tang forces led by Li Shiji suddenly turned to invade Goguryeo. They attacked several castles including Shin and Geonan, etc. to throw the defense system of Goguryeo into disarray. The plan failed, and Li Shiji, instead arrayed all Tang forces to besiege Gaemo on 15 April. Gaemo fell on 25 April. Simultaneously, naval forces led by Zhang Liang had landed in Liaodong Peninsula and went on to capture Bisa on the 2nd of May. Meanwhile, Emperor Taizong of Tang joined the forces and they captured Yodong and Baegam one after another. They had decided to attack Ansi and invaded the fortress on 20 June. In response, Yeon Gaesomun, Generalissimo of Goguryeo, sent about 150,000 forces with Go yeon-su and Go hye-jin to rescue Ansi.[2]

The battle to rescue Ansi

150,000 Goguryeo forces, which were led by general Go Yeonsu and general Go Hyezin, were sent to rescue Ansi. On 20 July, the two sides descended into battle. Tang Dynasty sent Li Shiji leading 15,000 infantry and cavalry to fight Goguryeo Army directly. But Tang general Zhangsun Wuji led 11,000 elite cavalry across the canyon from the north of the mountain to hit the rear of Goguryeo forces. In the battle, Taizong personally led 4,000 infantry and cavalry to fight. Tang army came out victorious in the end, decimating the Goguryeo forces. At least 20,000 Goguryeo soldiers were killed and 36,800 Goguryeo soldiers including their generals Go Yeonsu and Go Hyezin, surrendered. Tang army captured 50,000 horses, over 50,000 cattle, and over 10,000 iron armors. [3] After the battle Tang had succeeded in isolating Ansi fortress from other Goguryeo territory.

Assault on the Ansi fortress

Tang first attacked Ansi Fortress with several siege weapons including catapult and battering ram. However Goguryeo repelled the attacks and repaired the ramparts each time. As a result, Taizong was furious and Li Shi asked permission to massacre all the men and women if the fortress was captured, which was granted. After Anshi people heard this, they defended the fortress more tenaciously, the Tang Army's assaults were repelled several times. When the Ansi fortress attack came to a standstill, Tang was in a hurry. So Tang Army attacked the west side of the fortress as many as six or seven times per day.[4] One night, hundreds of Goguryeo soldiers climbed out of the fortress and attempted to attack the Tang Army. When Taizong heard about it, he called up soldiers to make an emergency joint attack which killed dozens of Goguryeo soldiers, and the rest fled back to the fortress. Under the leadership of Tang's prince Li Daozong, Tang force attempted to build a rampart in the southeastern corner of the fortress, gradually approaching the wall. Meanwhile, the external wall was constantly raised by the garrison. Li Daozong was injured in the battle. The Tang used 50,000 laborers and soldiers to build the rampart and the top of the rampart was only a few feet away from the fortress.[5] It overlooked the city downward. Fu Fuai, one commander of the Tang Army, stationed his troops on the top of the rampart. However, Fu Fuai left the camp privately and the rampart suddenly fell, and Goguryeo army occupied the rampart. Taizong was very angry and put Fu Fuai to death. After that, Tang tried to regain the rampart for 3 days but failed. On the 3rd day the Goguryeo army reinforcements arrived and Taizong had still not captured the Ansi Fortress. In addition, the weather was getting colder and food ran out. So Tang unavoidably ordered retreat.[6] Tang Taizong's retreat was difficult and many of his soldiers died.[7] Taizong himself tended to the injuries of his Turkic generals Qibi Heli and Ashina Simo, who were both wounded during the campaign against Goguryeo.[8]


Aftermath

Tang Dynasty estimated that about 2,000 Tang soldiers were killed during the 3 month long battle period and Tang Army lost plenty of war horses estimate 8,000. Taizong thought he could not win the war meanwhile feeling deeply sorry in the end.[9] In 645, Emperor Taizong founded the Minzhong Temple, the oldest temple in Beijing, to commemorate his soldiers who died in Goguryeo.[10][11][12][13]

Emperor Taizong prepared another invasion in 648, but died, possibly due to an illness he contracted during his Goguryeo campaigns.[14]
