This is a LIST OF TASK FORCES OF THE ROYAL NAVY a task force can be described as a temporary grouping of naval units under one commander, formed for the purpose of carrying out a specific operation or mission[1] they vary in size but usually comprise two or more task groups.


History

The concept of a naval task force is as old as navies the assembly of ships for naval operations was referred to as fleets, divisions, or on the smaller scale, squadrons, and flotillas. before World War II ships were collected into divisions derived from the Royal Navy's "division" of the line of battle in which one squadron usually remained under the direct command of the Admiral of the Fleet, one squadron was commanded by a Vice Admiral, and one by a Rear Admiral, each of the three squadrons flying different coloured flags, hence the terms flagship and flag officer. The flag of the Fleet Admiral's squadron was red, the Vice Admiral's was white and the Rear Admiral's blue. (The names "Vice" (possibly from advanced) and "Rear" might have derived from sailing positions within the line at the moment of engagement.) the term came into extensive use around the beginning in 1939, a task force can be assembled using ships from different divisions and squadrons, without requiring a formal and permanent fleet reorganization, and can be easily dissolved following completion of the operational task they can be formed by a sole navy or as part of a joint operation involving naval forces from more than one country.
