The PHILADELPHIA 76ERS TRAINING COMPLEX AND CORPORATE OFFICES is a 125,000-square-foot Training Complex and office building, which is the largest in the NBA. The Complex houses the team training center and corporate offices. It was opened in September 2016.[1]

Previously, the team practiced at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, in Bala Cynwyd, while business-side operations were located at The Navy Yard, in South Philadelphia. This is the first completely owned training complex the organization has ever had. And the design was key to have the practice facility and operations in the same complex.
