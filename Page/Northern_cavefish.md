The NORTHERN CAVEFISH or NORTHERN BLINDFISH, _Amblyopsis spelaea_, is found in caves through Kentucky and southern Indiana. It is listed as a threatened species in the United States and the IUCN lists the species as near threatened.

During a 2013 study of _Amblyopsis spelaea_, scientists found that the species was divided into two distinct evolutionary lineages: one north of the Ohio River, in Indiana, and one south of the river, in Kentucky. The southern population retained the name _A. spelaea_ and the northern was re-designated _Amblyopsis hoosieri_ in a 2014 paper published in the journal _ZooKeys_.[1][2] Neither species is found north of the White River, flowing east to west south of Bedford, Indiana.
