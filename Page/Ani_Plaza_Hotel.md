After the collapse of the USSR, _Ani Hotel_ was privatized in 1998, and after a major renovation it was reopened as ANI PLAZA HOTEL in 1999. It is named after the medieval Armenian city of Ani, one of the historical capitals of the Armenian nation.

As of 2016, with 260 guestrooms,[1] Ani Plaza is the largest hotel in Armenia.[2]


History

During the 1960s, there were only 3 hotels (_Yerevan_, _Armenia_ and _Sevan_) serving the city of Yerevan. The state-governed _Intourist_ agency was the regulating body of the hotels and tourism within the Soviet Union. A permission was granted from the central government in Moscow to build 4 new hotels in Yerevan through the efforts of _Iliya Gevorgov_, who was the director of the _Intourist_ agency branch in the Armenian SSR.

The first of the 4 hotels to be constructed was the Ani Hotel. The newly-opened Sayat-Nova Avenue was chosen as the site of the hotel. The design was composed by an architectural group included Eduard Safaryan, Phoenix Darbinyan and Felix Hakobyan. The trio had previously designed many of the residential buildings at the nearby Abovyan Street.

The construction of the hotel was launched in 1964 and completed by the end of 1969. The project was directed by Albert Sargsyan 1964-65), Victor Virabyan (1965-67) and Karlen Gharibyan (1967–69). In 1970, the hotel was officially opened at the 50th anniversary of the Sovietization of Armenia.

Following the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide in 1965, Armenian nationalism had a widespread revival among the young Armenians within the Soviet-ruled Armenia. Thus, the hotel was named after the ancient city of Ani[3] (currently in Turkey), which served as the capital of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia between 961 and 1045. The royal emblem of the Bagratuni dynasty was placed at the entrance to the hotel.

At the time of its inauguration, Ani Hotel became the tallest building of the city, and the largest hotel in Yerevan. The total cost of the hotel summed 5 million Soviet rubles. Upon its opening, Ani Hotel was awarded a diploma by the Architects Union of the USSR as the best structure of 1970.

The Russian jazz singer Larisa Dolina has performed several times in the hotel. In 1988, the hotel was acquired by the _Ani Enterprises_ company headed by an American-Armenian businessman.[4] In 1993, Cher stayed in Ani Hotel when she arrived in Armenia for her humanitarian mission, taking food and medical supplies to the war-torn nation.

Following the economical crisis of Armenia during the 1990s, the hotel was fully redeveloped in 1998. After large-scale renovation works, the hotel was reopened on 20 September 1999 as the 4-star ANI PLAZA HOTEL,[5] with the presence of then-president Robert Kocharyan.

In 2015, "Ani Enterprises" was acquired by the Armenian businessman Genik Karapetyan.[6]
