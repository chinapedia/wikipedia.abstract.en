CLINTON HIGH SCHOOL (CHS) is a public high school located in Clinton, South Carolina, United States. It is the lone high school in Laurens County School District 56.


History

Clinton High School was originally housed on North Adair Street; it opened in 1956. In late 2008, construction started on a new building on Highway 72; it opened in August 2010. The North Adair Street building was partially remodeled and opened in the fall of 2015 as Clinton Middle School, replacing Bell Street Middle School as District 56's lone middle school.


Athletics

Clinton High School, nicknamed the Red Devils, is a member of South Carolina's AAA high school classification, competing in Region III. The Red Devils' main rivals are the Laurens Raiders; their annual season-opening rivalry football game attracts some 10,000 spectators each year. Clinton hosts football games off-campus at Richardson Field at Wilder Stadium (located on campus at the old high school building), as they have since 1975. As of 2018, Wilder Stadium also hosts men's and women's soccer matches; until its discontinuation following the 2017 season, the stadium also hosted women's lacrosse. The Clinton High School Gymnasium hosts men's and women's basketball, as well as volleyball; baseball and softball also play in new on-campus stadiums.

Region

The Red Devils compete in South Carolina's Region III–AAA, alongside Newberry, Woodruff, Mid-Carolina, Emerald, and Union County, the latter two of which are new for the 2018–19 school year. Two schools departed the region following the conclusion of the 2017–18 school year: Chapman and Broome.
