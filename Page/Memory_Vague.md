_MEMORY VAGUE_ is a 2009 audio-visual project by Oneohtrix Point Never, the alias of electronic musician Daniel Lopatin. It was released as a limited-edition DVD-R by Root Strata on June 1, 2009.[1]


Background

_Memory Vague_ compiles music videos sourced from YouTube videos and edited by Lopatin in Windows Movie Maker.[2] It collects several videos previously uploaded to YouTube via Lopatin's sunsetcorp channel, including the profile-raising videos "Angel" and "Nobody Here."[3] The DVD features several of Lopatin's "eccojams": audio-visual pieces which typically sample micro-excerpts of 80's sources and "slow them down narcotically" with effects such as echo and pitch shifting added in a manner reminiscent of chopped and screwed styles.[4][5]
