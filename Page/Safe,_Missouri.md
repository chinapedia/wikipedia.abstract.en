SAFE is an unincorporated community in southeastern Maries County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] The community is located on Missouri Route H on a hill just west of and above the Bourbeuse River.[2] The community is approximately six miles north-northeast of St. James.[3]


History

A post office called Safe was established in 1886, and remained in operation until 1958.[4] According to one tradition, the community was named for the generosity of the proprietor of a local gristmill who allowed safekeeping of customer's grain.[5] Another tradition maintains the name is an acronym of the surnames of four first settlers, namely Shinkle, Aufderheide, Fann, and Essman.[6]
