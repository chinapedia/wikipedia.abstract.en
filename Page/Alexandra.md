ALEXANDRA (Greek: ) is the feminine form of the given name Alexander (Greek: , _Alexandros_).[1] Etymologically, the name is a compound of the Greek verb (_alexein_) "to defend" and (_anēr_) "man" (GEN _andros_). Thus it may be roughly translated as "defender of man" or "protector of man".[2][3][4] The name was one of the titles or epithets given to the Greek goddess Hera and as such is usually taken to mean "one who comes to save warriors". The earliest attested form of the name is the Mycenaean Greek , _a-re-ka-sa-da-ra_, written in the Linear B syllabic script.[5]
