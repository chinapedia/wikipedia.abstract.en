Mogadishu1936.jpg MOGADISCIO CIRCUIT (called even "_Circuito di Mogadiscio_" in Italian language) was a car race done in the main streets of Mogadiscio,[1] that was created in 1938 Italian Somalia.


History

Alfa_Romeo_12C_(1936).jpg The main Italian newspaper of Mogadiscio and the Italian colonies, _Il Littoriale_,[2] reported that on mid-August 1938 was done the first car race circuit of Mogadiscio.

Indeed, on August 15 the Governor Francesco Saveno flagged the start of a car race followed by many thousands in the "Corso Vittorio Emanuele" (actual "Somalia Boulevard") of Somalia's capital, where there were the main stands. On Mogadiscio streets many Somalis enjoyed enthusiastically to the first car race in their country.

It was followed even by a motorcycle race, done with 250 cc and 350 cc category and won respectively by Girotto on Benelli and by Pontiggia on Guzzi.

The car race was similar (even if smaller) to those done in other Italian colonies: the Circuito Asmara in Italian Eritrea and the worldwide famous Tripoli Grand Prix in Italian Libya. The "Circuito di Mogadiscio" was repeated in 1939, but the edition of 1940 was not done because of the beginning of World War II.

The most important category was dominated by the Alfa Romeo 1750, a race car built under Enzo Ferrari supervision that won in many other circuits (like the Christmas Asmara circuit of 1938). Circuito_Asmara_1950.JPG According to Gianluca Gabrielli there were 7 stands (2 stands only for the autochthonous population) and the magazine/newspaper "Corriere della Somalia" reported that in 1938 more than 10,000 spectators enjoyed the two sets of races (cars and motorcycles)[3]

Those race cars were also promoted by the Italian government to increase the image of Italy (inside the colonial populations and in the world) as a technologically country with state-of-the-art mechanical industry. Indeed, Italian Mogadiscio in 1938 was the second manufacturing city -after Italian Asmara- in the Eastern Africa's Italian Empire. The triangle Mogadiscio-Genale-Villabruzzi was the most developed area of the Italian colony, with one of the biggest vehicles concentration (per inhabitants) of all Africa: nearly 3000 vehicles in 1939.[4]

Motorcycle races after World War II

After World War II the "Circuito Mogadiscio" was done only with motorcycles races and was called _Gran Premio Motociclistico della Somalia_ (GP Motorcycle of Somalia). It was celebrated from 1950 until 1954, when the Italian government obtained the "Somalia Trusteeship" from the UN. The race was done on the coastal streets of Mogadiscio, near the port and on "Lungomare Corni", and was more than one mile long.

Attilio Di Nunzio won the 500cc category from 1950 to 1952 with his self-improved Guzzi.[5]
