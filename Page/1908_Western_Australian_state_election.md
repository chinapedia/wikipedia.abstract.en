Elections were held in the Australian state of Western Australia in late 1908 to elect 50 members to the state's Legislative Assembly. The main polling day was 11 September, although five remote electorates went to the polls at later dates.

The governing Ministerialists (led by the premier, Newton Moore) lost five seats, but retained a majority government. The Labour Party, led by Thomas Bath, gained eight seats for a total of 22, equalling their record set at the 1904 election. For the first time, no independents were elected.
