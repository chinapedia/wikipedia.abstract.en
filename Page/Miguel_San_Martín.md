ALEJANDRO MIGUEL SAN MARTÍN[1] (January 6, 1959) is an Argentine engineer of NASA[2] and a science educator.[3] He is best known for his work as Chief Engineer for the Guidance, Navigation, and Control system in the latest missions to Mars.[4][5] His best known contribution is the Sky Crane system, of which he is coinventor, used in the _Curiosity_ mission for the descent of the rover.[6]

In addition to his work as an engineer, he is dedicated to giving presentations about the work he does with his team at NASA. He has participated as a speaker at various events such as Campus Party, Robotics Day,[7] Real Talks Atlanta[8][9] and TEDx Río de la Plata,[10] among other conferences.[11][12] He is featured in the NASA video "_Curiosity_{{'s}} Seven Minutes of Terror" along with other _Curiosity_ engineers.[13]


Early life and career

In various interviews he said that he decided to be a space engineer on a winter's night in 1976 at his parents’ farm, while he listened to the BBC on short wave reporting the arrival of the _Viking_ mission to Mars.[16]

He started working for the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1985,[17] where he participated in the _Magellan_ mission to Venus and _Cassini_ mission to Saturn. Later in the _Pathfinder_ mission he was named Chief Engineer for the Guidance, Navigation, and Control system, which landed _Sojourner_ rover. In the same role he was part of the _Spirit_ and _Opportunity_ missions in 2004.[18] He helped to develop the Sky Crane system which landed _Curiosity_ on Mars as part of the Mars Science Laboratory mission, and with his team at JPL he also worked on the software for the landing.[19][20]

He is a member of the NASA National Engineering and Safety Center.[21]

In February 2019, he was elected as member of the National Academy of Engineering.[22]
