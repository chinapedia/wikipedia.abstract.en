_HEROES_ is a live album by pianist Gil Evans and saxophonist Lee Konitz recorded in New York in 1980 and released on the French Verve label.[1][2][3]


Critical reception

The Allmusic review stated "Since Evans was far from a virtuoso and at best played "arranger's piano" (particularly at this late stage in his life), his accompaniment behind Konitz is quite sparse ... overall this is a rather uneventful and often dull release that can easily be passed by".[4]
