_VERTICORDIA_ SECT. _PLATANDRA_ is one of eleven sections in the subgenus _Verticordia_. It includes two species of plants in the genus _Verticordia_. Plants in this section resemble _V. pritzelii_ in section _Catocalypta_ but differ in they do not have tufts of hair on their sepals. The anthers are flattened and the hairs on the style are forked.[1] When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991 he formally described this section, publishing the description in the journal Nuytsia.[2][3]

When George published his review of the genus in 1991, there was only one species in the section, _V. gracilis_ but in 2010 he described _V. setacea_ and included that species in section _Platandra_.[4][5]

The name _Platandra_ is derived from the Ancient Greek words _platy-_ meaning "flattened" and _-andros_ meaning "male" referring to the flattened anthers.[6]

The type species for this section is _Verticordia gracilis_ and the other species is _V. setacea_.[7][8]
