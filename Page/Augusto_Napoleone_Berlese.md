Augusto_Napoleone_Berlese.jpg AUGUSTO NAPOLEONE BERLESE (21 October 1864, in Padua – 26 January 1903, in Milan) was an Italian botanist and mycologist. He was the brother of entomologist Antonio Berlese 1863–1927, with whom he founded the journal _Rivista di patologia vegetale_ in 1892.[1]

He studied natural sciences at the University of Padua, where following graduation, he worked for several years as a botanical assistant (1885–1889). Later on, he taught classes at the viticulture school in Avellino (from 1892), and at the universities of Camerino (from 1895) and Sassari (from 1899). In 1901 he was appointed professor of phytopathology at the agricultural college in Milan.[2]

The mycological genus _Berlesiella_ (family Herpotrichiellaceae) was named in his honor by Pier Andrea Saccardo.[3][4]
