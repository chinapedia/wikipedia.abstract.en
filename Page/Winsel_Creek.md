WINSEL CREEK (also called WINDSELL CREEK) is a stream in Crawford and Franklin Counties in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] It is a tributary of Spring Creek in Franklin County.[2]

The stream headwaters arise in northern Crawford County just west of Sullivan (at [3]). The stream flows northeast past the north side of Sullivan and crosses under I-44 north of Oak Grove then turns to the northwest and crosses under I-44 again. The stream meanders to the northwest to its confluence with Spring Creek (at[4]).[5][6]

Windsel derives its name from a local pioneer citizen named Windsell.[7]
