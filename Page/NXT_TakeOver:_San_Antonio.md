Production

Background

The NXT TakeOver series of professional wrestling shows started on May 29, 2014, as the WWE developmental league NXT held their second WWE Network exclusive live broadcast billed as NXT TakeOver.[2] In subsequent months, the "TakeOver" moniker became the brand used for all of their NXT live specials.[3][4][5] NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn was the first TakeOver show held outside of Full Sail University.[6] NXT TakeOver: San Antonio was the thirteenth show held under the NXT TakeOver banner, the first to be held in January, and the first of 2017.

Storylines

The card included five matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by WWE's writers.[7][8] Storylines were produced on the _NXT_ television program.

On the December 14, 2016 episode of _NXT_, Bobby Roode defeated Oney Lorcan to qualify for a #1 contender's fatal 4-way match along with Tye Dillinger, Andrade Cien Almas and Roderick Strong.[9] The following week, Roode defeated Dillinger, Almas and Strong to earn a match for the NXT Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura at TakeOver: San Antonio.[10]

At TakeOver: Toronto on November 19, 2016, DIY defeated The Revival in a two-out-of-three falls match to win the NXT Tag Team Championship. Also on that night, The Authors of Pain defeated TM-61 to win Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic.[11] A title match between the two teams was scheduled for TakeOver: San Antonio.[12]

On the January 11, 2017 episode of _NXT_, it was shown that Billie Kay and Peyton Royce had attacked Asuka earlier in the day. After Kay and Royce defeated Sarah Bridges and Macey Evans, Asuka came down and attacked both. However, both Kay and Royce overpowered Asuka. Nikki Cross then seemingly came to Asuka's aide, however, she attacked Asuka after running Kay and Royce off. The following week, a fatal 4-way match for the NXT Women's Championship between the four women was scheduled for TakeOver: San Antonio.[13]
