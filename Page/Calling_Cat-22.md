_CALLING CAT-22_[1] is a flash animation comedy series created by Matthew Schwartz through Turner Studios for the Cartoon Network Wedgies series, produced by Steve Patrick, and directed by Jai Anthony-Lewis Husband; writing honors were shared by Schwartz and Patrick. The series theme was performed by electronic pop duo Nova Social. The series debuted on June 1, 2008 on the Cartoon Network channel in the intervals of _The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack_. The cartoon series consists of five two-and-a-half-minute episodes: “Hydrant,” “Bones,” “Flying Discs,” “Stink,” and “Sniff.”

In form, the series is a parody of spy thrillers of the James Bond variety, in which the eponymous Cat-22, an agent for a secret organization of cats directed by Gato Primo (voiced by Garrett Fisher),[2] seeks to discover the mysteries associated with the life of dogs (who, despite their oblivious imbecility in the series, are treated by the cats like agents of a hostile superpower or enemy agency).

Each episode's plot follows a set formula. 22,[3] (a rail-thin black cat in a stereotypical "men-in-black"-style secret agent suit) is found relaxing in some foreign venue, until given a briefcase containing an assignment by Agent Andrew (a short, stout black cat with a poncy English accent); the briefcase conveys a communication from Gato Primo to investigate some (usually disgusting) feature of canine life, invariably concluding with a _Mission: Impossible_-like warning from Gato that "[This briefcase will self-destruct..." and 22's subsequent resulting injury. Thereupon, 22 is seen in "disguise" (a brown beanie with doggie ears), attempting to gain information from his moronic canine friend, Guthrie (David Markus) (and, on occasion, the brutal bulldog, Percy); invariably, complications follow, involving comic injury and humiliation, which are generally only heightened by Gato's attempts to extract him from the situation. Typically, Andrew generally reappears at the end of the episode to reassure 22 that he will soon be back on assignment, whereupon 22 attempts to escape (often resulting in further injury).

[1] The title is a pun on Joseph Heller's novel, _Catch-22_, referring to the impossibility of the title character's avoiding humiliation in each episode.

[2] The name "Gato Primo" comes from Matt Schwartz's original sketch for the character. In the series itself, Gato Primo's name appears only as "Gato." It is possible that "Gato Primo" may be his title or code name as chief of the organization, and the organization itself may be called "Gato." Strictly speaking, "Gato Primo" is Spanish for "Cat Cousin," but it may simply be a mistake for "Primer Gato," which would mean "first cat" or "Cat Number One" (or even "Cat-1").

[3] He is called "Cat-22" by Gato once (in "Hydrant") and simply "22" thereafter.
