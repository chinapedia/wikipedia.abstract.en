The NEVA TOWERS (), formerly the RENAISSANCE MOSCOW TOWERS (), is a complex of two skyscrapers located on plots 17 and 18 of the Moscow International Business Center (MIBC) in Moscow, Russia.[1] Tower 1 will be 296.9 meters (974 feet) tall and have 65 floors while Tower 2 will be 345 meters tall and have 79 floors. The complex is currently under construction and is expected to be completed in two stages: first stage to be commissioned in mid-2019 and the second stage to be completed in late 2020.[2]


History

Origins

Plots 17 and 18 of the MIBC were to be used originally for the Russia Tower, a supertall skyscraper designed by Norman Foster, but the Great Recession and issues with investors forced development of the project to be cancelled.[3] On 2014, ownership of half of the plot was transferred to Turkish company Rönesans Holding.[4]

As general contractor, Rönesans Holding hired ST Towers LLC to develop a new complex, the Renaissance Moscow Towers, later renamed the Neva Towers.[5] The project would also be developed by the SPEECH Architectural Bureau in partnership with American companies HOK and FXCollaborative, with public spaces designed by Hirsch Bedner Associates.[6] The management of the complex claimed to receive a LEED Gold certificate.[7]

Construction

Sales of the apartments in the complex opened in September 2016.[8] Investments for the complex exceeded $1 billion later in November 2016.[9]

On 15 October 2018, Tower 2 of the Neva Towers was architecturally topped out when work on the 79th floor was completed. Construction of the first stage of the project is 70% completed.[10]


Design

The plots Neva Towers are to be built on have a total area of 2.41 hectares. The total area of the complex will be 349.2 thousand square meters. The complex will be composed of a single four-story stylobate where the two towers would be build on top on. Tower 2 will be a 79-story residential skyscraper with a height of 345 meters. Tower 1 will be a 65-story skyscraper with a height of 296.9 meters with office space proposed on the 28th floor. In the complex would be a private park with an area of seven thousand square meters. In addition, the complex would have a hotel and a fitness center with a swimming pool located on Tower 2. There is also a parking lot with a planned capacity of 2,040 cars for workers and residents of the complex. Stone plates of light stone are to be used to decorate the skyscrapers.[11][12][13][14]
