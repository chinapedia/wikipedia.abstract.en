_AUREOLARIA PEDICULARIA_, the FERNLEAF YELLOW FALSE FOXGLOVE,[1] FERN-LEAVED FALSE FOXGLOVE, or FERNLEAF FALSE FOXGLOVE, is a parasitic plant and part of the Orobanchaceae family. _Aureolaria pedicularia_ is native to parts of the eastern US, the Midwest, and adjacent Canada. This plant is known for its distinct leaf shape and overall plant size. The common names for _Aureolaria pedicularia_ come from its fern-like leaves.


Introduction

_Aureolaria pedicularia_ is a plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. Some common names for this plant include: fern-leaved false foxglove and fernleaf false foxglove.[2] _Aureolaria pedicularia_ is a hemiparasitic plant that gets some of its nutrients from a plant host. This hosts are perennial trees of the genus _Quercus_ (oaks). _Aureolaria pedicularia_ is recognized by its yellow petal color and distinctive fern-like leaves.[3]


Description

_Aureolaria pedicularia_ is a member of the genus _Aureolaria_.[4] This plant has an average height from 1 foot to 4 feet, depending on the season.[5] _Aureolaria pedicularia_ is a root hemiparasite meaning it attaches to the roots of its hosts. _Aureolaria pedicularia_ selectively parasitizes oaks (_Quercus_). _Aureolaria pedicularia_ gets its nutrients from oak (Fagaceae). The part of the roots from the parasite (_Aureolaria pedicularia)_ that take the nutrients from the oak selectively parasitize the favored hosts (oak).[6][7]

Morphology

_Aureolaria pedicularia_ has flowers with yellow petals. The leaves are simple, meaning they do not separate into leaflets. The leaf arrangement is opposite. There are two leaves at each attachment of a leaf on the stem or branch on the flower. The edges of the leaf blades have lobes. The flowers of _Aureolaria pedicularia_ are bilateral. Each flower has five fused petals that form a tube. _Aureolaria pedicularia_ also has four stamens. The fruit type for this flower is dry and splits open when it is ripe. The fruit type is a capsule. The fruit size is about 10–13 mm in length.[8]


Taxonomy

_Aureolaria pedicularia_ is in the family Orobanchaceae. This family is made up of 190 genera and 4,000 temperate species. Many species in the Scrophulariaceae family, including _Aureolaria pedicularia,_ are partial root parasites.[9] Partial root parasites get their nutrients from another living plant.[10] Species in the genus _Aureolaria_ are also known as the false foxglove.[11] Species in this genus are widespread over much of eastern North America. All members of this genus are root parasites. Observation was first presented by the noted American botanist Asa Gray.[12]

There are about 21 synonyms for _Aureolaria pedicularia._ The subspecies are _Aureolaria pedicularia var. carolinensis_ Pennell and _Aureolaria pedicularia_ _var. ambigens_ Fernald.[13] These subspecies are distinguished by physical characteristics such as glandular hairs on the leaves and other traits such as the size.[14] The distribution and nativism for the various varieties for _Aureolaria pedicularia_ need addition study.[15]

Two of the most common varieties of_Aureolaria pedicularia_'s are _A. pedicularia var. intercedens_ Pennell and _A. pedicularia var. pedicularia_. In North America, _A. pedicularia var. intercedens_ is known from Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Also in North America, _A. pedicularia var. pedicularia_ is known from Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont.[16]

Taxonomic history

Rafinesque published _Pantenis pedicularis (_or _Aureolaria)_ and based it on _Gerardia pedicularia_ L. (1753). Rafinesque did not officially establish the binomial name _Aureolaria pedicularia_ but he did use it as an alternative for the taxon _Pantenis pedicularis._[17]


Distribution and habitat

Habitats for _Aureolaria pedicularia_ include terrestrial locations such as cliffs, balds, ledges, forests, grasslands, ridges, rocky slopes, and woodlands.[18] This plant lives in partly shady areas to sunny areas. The soil typical for this plant is dry and sandy soil. _Aureolaria pedicularia_ is most commonly found in open oak woods and savannas. The bloom season is from the months of May to October.[19]

The overall US distribution for _Aureolaria pedicularia_ is throughout most of eastern North America the Great Lake states and parts of the mid-west[20]


Uses

_Aureolaria pedicularia_ was used by the Cherokee as a drug for antidiarrheal purposes.[21] Also, _Aureolaria pedicularia_ is commonly used as a food-plant by deer.[22]


Conservation

In the state of Maine, the status for the presence of the plant _Aureolaria pedicularia_ is considered uncommon. In the state of Vermont, it is extremely rare.[23] In the state of Minnesota, this plant is considered threatened.[24] One of the factors that contribute to the endangerment of _Aureolaria pedicularia_ is the consumption of this plant by young larvae of deer. Overgrazing by deer of _Aureolaria pedicularia_ may be a threat.[25] Forest fires are also a threat to this species.[26][27] Another factor that affects the population of _Aureolaria pedicularia_ is the availability of its favored host, since it is a root parasite. This parasite plant uses the roots of oaks (Quercus) as a site for attachment. Without its host, _Aureolaria pedicularia_ is not able to survive naturally because it depends on its hosts for its nutrients including sugars and proteins.[28]
