Charles keeps getting nightmares of his Vietnam days on how he killed an innocent civilian boy in one of the operations and this keeps haunting him. On the other hand, Ada s on her mission to find her father and is helped by a local guy Yen who becomes her guide and guardian in the new country. She engages in a sexual relationship with an older man, Hoang Vu who is an artist by profession. Jon indulges in the nightlife of Vietnam and Ada keeps getting closer to her father as she travels across the country. Charles discovers author Dang Tho's novel chronicling wartime and this helps him find some peace.


Publication and development

The book is author David Bergen's fifth novel.[1] Although generally called a war novel, the author states that he "[doesn't] see _The Time in Between_ as a war novel".[2] The book was released as Audio book by Blackstone Audio in December 2005 and was narrated by Anna Fields, better known as Kate Fleming.[3]


Reviews and reception

_Kirkus reviews_ called the novel a "beautifully composed, unflinching and harrowing story".[4] Nicholas Dinka in their _Quill & Quire_ review mentions that the novel has "much decency and intelligence" and both the stories of the novel are "entirely plausible" but criticises for "remarkable dourness of its prose".[5] While Dennis Lythgoe of _Deseret News_ noted that "Bergen's book lives and breathes the Vietnam experience";[6] Ron Charles in his _The Washington Post_ review mentioned that "Bergen's ability to dramatize trauma-induced disaffection is undeniable; whether readers will want to sink down that hole with his characters is less clear".[7] Irene Wanner of _The Seattle Times_ appreciated the novel for its writing.[8]

The novel won the Scotiabank Giller Prize in 2005 while being nominated along with _Luck_ (by Joan Barfoot), _Sweetness in the Belly_ (by Camilla Gibb), _Alligator_ (by Lisa Moore), and _A Wall of Light_ (by Edeet Ravel). The judges Warren Cariou, Elizabeth Hay, and Richard B. Wright noted "_The Time in Between_ explores our need to understand the relationship between love and duty....[] This is a subtle and elegantly written novel by an author in complete command of his talent".[9] It also won the McNally Robinson Book of the Year Award in 2005. Berger had earlier won the award in 1996 for _A Year of Lesser_ and later again won in 2009 for _The Retreat_.[10] Dan Zigmond of _SFGate_ reviews the novel as "a rich and rewarding novel".[11]
