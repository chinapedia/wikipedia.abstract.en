Fabled_diamond_mines.jpg region. Published in 1725]] The {{'}}GOLCONDA DIAMONDS{{'}} are Indian diamonds mined in a specific geographic area within the historic Golconda Sultanate (present day Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states of India). Diamonds from these mines were transported to the city of Hyderabad to be cut, polished, evaluated and sold. Golconda established itself as a diamond trading center and, until the end of the 19th century, the Golconda market was the primary source of the finest and largest diamonds in the world. Thus, the legendary name 'Golconda Diamond' became synonymous with Golconda itself.

One of the most popular diamond mines was Kollur Mine (presently in Guntur district). There were also other mines around the River Krishna in South India. Along with diamonds, the region also became a trade center for metalware, pearls, spices and textiles. According to The New Indian Express (22 October 2016), "the Hyderabad based historian, Muhammad Safiullah says such was the trade that the estimated output from all mines in Golconda was estimated to be around 12 million carats".


History

Earlier, Golconda sultanate was located in between the two major sea ports of India, Surat and Machilipatnam. The town was developed as a trade center and, under the patronage of the Qutb Shahi rulers, a thriving market particularly of diamonds was developed nearby the Golconda fort, the work force involved in the diamond trading was up to 100,000 people. The medieval diamond trade drew travelers from around the world and the ruling patrons constructed facilities and provided security for traders to stay and do business, particularly those travelling from Europe and central Asia. According to Manu S. Pillai, (The Hindu, 05 November 2016), Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, renowned French traveller and jeweller, claimed to have seen a flat diamond called the Great Table diamond kept in a dungeon in Golconda.[1][2][3][4][5] Jean de Thévenot and François Bernier were also French traders in 'Golconda Diamonds'.[6][7][8]
