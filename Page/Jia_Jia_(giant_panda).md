JIA JIA was a female giant panda who resided at Ocean Park Hong Kong. At the time of her death, she was the oldest giant panda in captivity.[1]

Jia Jia was born in the wilderness of Sichuan province and was rescued[2] in Qingchuan County around the age of two. She was housed in Wolong National Nature Reserve before being transferred to Hong Kong in 1999, as a gesture to the territory following the British handover. At the time of her death, she had high blood pressure, arthritis and cataracts.[3][4]
