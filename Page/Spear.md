A_spear_and_a_series_of_javelins..png wood.]]

A SPEAR is a pole weapon consisting of a shaft, usually of wood, with a pointed head. The head may be simply the sharpened end of the shaft itself, as is the case with fire hardened spears, or it may be made of a more durable material fastened to the shaft, such as flint, obsidian, iron, steel or bronze. The most common design for hunting or combat spears since ancient times has incorporated a metal spearhead shaped like a triangle, lozenge, or leaf. The heads of fishing spears usually feature barbs or serrated edges.

The word _spear_ comes from the Old English _spere_, from the Proto-Germanic _speri_, from a Proto-Indo-European root _*sper-_ "spear, pole". Spears can be divided into two broad categories: those designed for thrusting in melee combat and those designed for throwing (usually referred to as javelins).

The spear has been used throughout human history both as a hunting and fishing tool and as a weapon. Along with the axe, knife and club, it is one of the earliest and most important tools developed by early humans. As a weapon, it may be wielded with either one hand or two. It was used in virtually every conflict up until the modern era, where even then it continues on in the form of the bayonet, and is probably the most commonly used weapon in history.[1]


Origins

Spear manufacture and use is not confined to humans. It is also practiced by the western chimpanzee. Chimpanzees near Kédougou, Senegal have been observed to create spears by breaking straight limbs off trees, stripping them of their bark and side branches, and sharpening one end with their teeth. They then used the weapons to hunt galagos sleeping in hollows.[2]

Prehistory

Clacton_Spear_02.jpg]] Mesa_Verde_spear_and_knife.jpg]]

Archaeological evidence found in present-day Germany documents that wooden spears have been used for hunting since at least 400,000 years ago,[3] and a 2012 study suggests that _Homo heidelbergensis_ may have developed the technology about 500,000 years ago.[4] Wood does not preserve well, however, and Craig Stanford, a primatologist and professor of anthropology at the University of Southern California, has suggested that the discovery of spear use by chimpanzees probably means that early humans used wooden spears as well, perhaps, five million years ago.[5]

Neanderthals were constructing stone spear heads from as early as 300,000 BP and by 250,000 years ago, wooden spears were made with fire-hardened points.

From circa 200,000 BCE onwards, Middle Paleolithic humans began to make complex stone blades with flaked edges which were used as spear heads. These stone heads could be fixed to the spear shaft by gum or resin or by bindings made of animal sinew, leather strips or vegetable matter. During this period, a clear difference remained between spears designed to be thrown and those designed to be used in hand-to-hand combat. By the Magdalenian period (c. 15,000-9500 BCE), spear-throwers similar to the later atlatl were in use.[6]

Greeks

Warrior_spear_CdM_Paris_DeRidder299.jpg The spear is the main weapon of the warriors of Homer's Iliad. The use of both a single thrusting spear and two throwing spears are mentioned. It has been suggested that two styles of combat are being described; an early style, with thrusting spears, dating to the Mycenaean period in which the Iliad is set, and, anachronistically, a later style, with throwing spears, from Homer's own Archaic period.[7]

In the 7th century BCE, the Greeks evolved a new close-order infantry formation, the phalanx.[8] The key to this formation was the hoplite, who was equipped with a large, circular, bronze-faced shield (aspis) and a spear with an iron head and bronze butt-spike (doru).[9] The hoplite phalanx dominated warfare among the Greek City States from the 7th into the 4th century BCE.

The 4th century saw major changes. One was the greater use of peltasts, light infantry armed with spear and javelins.[10] The other was the development of the sarissa, a two-handed pike in length, by the Macedonians under Phillip of Macedon and Alexander the Great.[11] The pike phalanx, supported by peltasts and cavalry, became the dominant mode of warfare among the Greeks from the late 4th century onward[12] until Greek military systems were supplanted by the Roman legions.

Romans

Roman_soldier_175_aC_in_northern_province.jpg'']] In the pre-Marian Roman armies, the first two lines of battle, the _hastati_ and _principes_, often fought with a sword called a _gladius_ and _pila_, heavy javelins that were specifically designed to be thrown at an enemy to pierce and foul a target's shield. Originally the _principes_ were armed with a short spear called a _hasta_, but these gradually fell out of use, eventually being replaced by the gladius. The third line, the _triarii_, continued to use the _hasta_.

From the late 2nd century BCE, all legionaries were equipped with the _pilum_. The _pilum_ continued to be the standard legionary spear until the end of the 2nd century CE. _Auxilia_, however, were equipped with a simple hasta and, perhaps, throwing spears. During the 3rd century CE, although the _pilum_ continued to be used, legionaries usually were equipped with other forms of throwing and thrusting spear, similar to _auxilia_ of the previous century. By the 4th century, the _pilum_ had effectively disappeared from common use.[13]

In the late period of the Roman Empire, the spear became more often used because of its anti-cavalry capacities as the barbarian invasions were often conducted by people with a developed culture of cavalry in warfare.

Post-classical history

Muslim world

Muslim warriors used a spear that was called an _az-zaġāyah_. Berbers pronounced it _zaġāya_, but the English term, derived from the Old French via Berber, is "assegai". It is a pole weapon used for throwing or hurling, usually a light spear or javelin made of hard wood and pointed with a forged iron tip.The _az-zaġāyah_ played an important role during the Islamic conquest as well as during later periods, well into the 20th century. A longer pole _az-zaġāyah_ was being used as a hunting weapon from horseback. The _az-zaġāyah_ was widely used. It existed in various forms in areas stretching from Southern Africa to the Indian subcontinent, although these places already had their own variants of the spear. This javelin was the weapon of choice during the _Fulani jihad_ as well as during the Mahdist War in Sudan. It is still being used by Sikh _Nihang_ in the Punjab as well as certain wandering Sufi ascetics _(Derwishes)_.

Europe

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the spear and shield continued to be used by nearly all Western European cultures. Since a medieval spear required only a small amount of steel along the sharpened edges (most of the spear-tip was wrought iron), it was an economical weapon. Quick to manufacture, and needing less smithing skill than a sword, it remained the main weapon of the common soldier. The Vikings, for instance, although often portrayed with axe or sword in hand, were armed mostly with spears,[14] as were their Anglo-Saxon, Irish, or continental contemporaries.

Infantry

Assyrian_soldier_holding_a_spear_and_wearing_a_helmet._Detail_of_a_basalt_relief_from_the_palace_of_Tiglath-pileser_III_at_Hadatu,_Syria._744-727_BCE._Ancient_Orient_Museum,_Istanbul.jpg Broadly speaking, spears were either designed to be used in melee, or to be thrown. Within this simple classification, there was a remarkable range of types. For example, M.J. Swanton identified thirty different spearhead categories and sub-categories in Early Saxon England.[15] Most medieval spearheads were generally leaf-shaped. Notable types of Early medieval spears include the _angon_, a throwing spear with a long head similar to the Roman _pilum_, used by the Franks and Anglo-Saxons, and the winged (or lugged) spear, which had two prominent wings at the base of the spearhead, either to prevent the spear penetrating too far into an enemy or to aid in spear fencing.[16] Originally a Frankish weapon, the winged spear also was popular with the Vikings. It would become the ancestor of later medieval polearms, such as the _partisan_ and _spetum_.

The thrusting spear also has the advantage of reach, being considerably longer than other weapon types. Exact spear lengths are hard to deduce as few spear shafts survive archaeologically but would seem to have been the norm. Some nations were noted for their long spears, including the Scots and the Flemish. Spears usually were used in tightly ordered formations, such as the shieldwall or the schiltron. To resist cavalry, spear shafts could be planted against the ground.[17] William Wallace drew up his schiltrons in a circle at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298 to deter charging cavalry,[18] it was a widespread tactic sometimes known as the "crown" formation.[19]

Throwing spears became rarer as the Middle Ages drew on, but survived in the hands of specialists such as the Catalan Almogavars.[20] They were commonly used in Ireland until the end of the 16th century.[21]

Spears began to lose fashion among the infantry during the 14th century, being replaced by pole weapons that combined the thrusting properties of the spear with the cutting properties of the axe, such as the halberd. Where spears were retained they grew in length, eventually evolving into pikes, which would be a dominant infantry weapon in the 16th and 17th centuries.[22]

Cavalry

Cavalry spears were originally the same as infantry spears and were often used with two hands or held with one hand overhead. In the 12th century, after the adoption of stirrups and a high-cantled saddle, the spear became a decidedly more powerful weapon. A mounted knight would secure the lance by holding it with one hand and tucking it under the armpit (the _couched lance_ technique)[23] This allowed all the momentum of the horse and knight to be focused on the weapon's tip, whilst still retaining accuracy and control. This use of the spear spurred the development of the lance as a distinct weapon that was perfected in the medieval sport of jousting.[24]

In the 14th century, tactical developments meant that knights and men-at-arms often fought on foot. This led to the practice of shortening the lance to about .) to make it more manageable.[25] As dismounting became commonplace, specialist pole weapons such as the pollaxe were adopted by knights and this practice ceased.[26]

Asia

Chinese

Bronze_spearheads,_Shang_Dynasty.JPG spear heads]] Spears were used first as hunting weapons amongst the ancient Chinese. They became popular as infantry weapons during the Warring States and Qin era, when spearmen were used as especially highly disciplined soldiers in organized group attacks. When used in formation fighting, spearmen would line up their large rectangular or circular shields in a shieldwall manner. The Qin also employed long spears (more akin to a pike) in formations similar to Swiss pikemen in order to ward off cavalry. The Han Empire would use similar tactics as its Qin predecessors. Halberds, polearms, and dagger axes were also common weapons during this time.

Spears were also common weaponry for Warring States, Qin, and Han era cavalry units. During these eras, the spear would develop into a longer lance-like weapon used for cavalry charges.

There are many words in Chinese that would be classified as a spear in English. The _Mao_ is the predecessor of the _Qiang_. The first bronze _Mao_ appeared in the Shang dynasty. This weapon was less prominent on the battlefield than the _ge_ (dagger-axe). In some archaeological examples two tiny holes or ears can be found in the blade of the spearhead near the socket, these holes were presumably used to attach tassels, much like modern day wushu spears. Spear_Jinsha.JPG Chinese_pirate_spear_hmsL4.jpg

In the early Shang, the _Mao_ appeared to have a relatively short shaft as well as a relatively narrow shaft as opposed to _Mao_ in the later Shang and Western Zhou period. Some _Mao_ from this era are heavily decorated as is evidenced by a Warring States period _Mao_ from the Ba Shu area.[27]

In the Han dynasty the _Mao_ and the _Ji_ (戟 _Ji_ can be loosely defined as a halberd) rose to prominence in the military. Interesting to note is that the amount of iron Mao-heads found exceeds the number of bronze heads. By the end of the Han dynasty (Eastern Han) the process of replacement of the iron _Mao_ had been completed and the bronze _Mao_ had been rendered completely obsolete. After the Han dynasty toward the Sui and Tang dynasties the _Mao_ used by cavalry were fitted with much longer shafts, as is mentioned above. During this era, the use of the _Shuo_ (矟) was widespread among the footmen. The _Shuo_ can be likened to a pike or simply a long spear.[28]

After the Tang dynasty, the popularity of the _Mao_ declined and was replaced by the _Qiang_ (枪). The Tang dynasty divided the _Qiang_ in four categories: "一曰漆枪， 二曰木枪， 三曰白杆枪， 四曰扑头枪。” Roughly translated the four categories are: Qi (a kind of wood) Spears, Wooden Spears, Bai Gan (A kind of wood) Spears and Pu Tou Qiang. The Qiang that were produced in the Song and Ming dynasties consisted of four major parts: Spearhead, Shaft, End Spike and Tassel. The types of Qiang that exist are many. Among the types there are cavalry Qiang that were the length of one _zhang_ (eleven feet and nine inches or 3.58 m), Litte-Flower Spears (Xiao Hua Qiang 小花枪) that are the length of one person and their arm extended above his head, double hooked spears, single hooked spears, ringed spears and many more.[29]

There is some confusion as to how to distinguish the _Qiang_ from the _Mao_, as they are obviously very similar. Some people say that a _Mao_ is longer than a _Qiang_, others say that the main difference is between the stiffness of the shaft, where the _Qiang_ would be flexible and the _Mao_ would be stiff. Scholars seem to lean toward the latter explanation more than the former. Because of the difference in the construction of the _Mao_ and the _Qiang_, the usage is also different, though there is no definitive answer as to what exactly the differences are between the _Mao_ and the _Qiang_.[30]

Indian society

Maratha_Soldier.jpg soldier with spear by James Forbes, 1813.]] Spears in the Indian society were used both in missile and non-missile form, both by cavalry and foot-soldiers. Mounted spear-fighting was practiced using with a ten-foot, ball-tipped wooden lance called a _bothati_, the end of which was covered in dye so that hits may be confirmed. Spears were constructed from a variety of materials such as the _sang_ made completely of steel, and the _ballam_ which had a bamboo shaft. The Rajputs wielded a type of spear for infantrymen which had a club integrated into the spearhead, and a pointed butt end. Other spears had forked blades, several spear-points, and numerous other innovations. One particular spear unique to India was the _vita_ or corded lance. Used by the Maratha army, it had a rope connecting the spear with the user's wrist, allowing the weapon to be thrown and pulled back. The _Vel_ is a type of spear or lance, originated in Southern India, primarily used by Tamils.[31][32]

Japan

Estampe-p1000685.jpg print of a samurai general holding a yari in his right hand]] The hoko spear was used in ancient Japan sometime between the Yayoi period and the Heian period, but it became unpopular as early samurai often acted as horseback archers. Medieval Japan employed spears again for infantrymen to use, but it was not until the 11th century in that samurai began to prefer spears over bows. Several polearms were used in the Japanese theatres; the naginata was a glaive-like weapon with a long, curved blade popularly among the samurai and the Buddhist warrior-monks, often used against cavalry; the yari was a longer polearm, with a straight-bladed spearhead, which became the weapon of choice of both the samurai and the ashigaru (footmen) during the Warring States Era, The horseback samurai used shorter yari for his single-armed combat, on the other hand, ashigaru infantries used long yari (similar with European pike) for their massed combat formation.

Korea

Philippines

Native-Warrior.jpg Filipino spears (sibat) were used as both a weapon and a tool throughout the Philippines. It is also called a _bangkaw_ (after the Bankaw Revolt.), _sumbling_ or _palupad_ in the islands of Visayas and Mindanao. Sibat are typically made from rattan, either with a sharpened tip or a head made from metal. These heads may either be single-edged, double-edged or barbed. Styles vary according to function and origin. For example, a sibat designed for fishing may not be the same as those used for hunting.

The spear was used as the primary weapon in expeditions and battles against neighbouring island kingdoms and it became famous during the 1521 Battle of Mactan, where the chieftain Lapu Lapu of Cebu fought against Spanish forces led by Ferdinand Magellan who was subsequently killed.

Vietnam

The Vietnamese people used spears similar to that of the Chinese, but also used punji spears Giao1.JPG spear heads]]

North America

Mesoamerica

A_smoky_day_at_the_Sugar_Bowl--Hupa.jpg man with his spear – _by Edward Sheriff Curtis, dated 1923_]] As advanced metallurgy was largely unknown in pre-Columbian America outside of Western Mexico and South America, most weapons in Meso-America were made of wood or obsidian. This didn't mean that they were less lethal, as obsidian may be sharpened to become many times sharper than steel.[33] Meso-American spears varied greatly in shape and size. While the Aztecs preferred the sword-like macuahuitl for fighting,[34] the advantage of a far-reaching thrusting weapon was recognised, and a large portion of the army would carry the tepoztopilli into battle.[35] The tepoztopilli was a pole-arm, and to judge from depictions in various Aztec codices, it was roughly the height of a man, with a broad wooden head about twice the length of the users' palm or shorter, edged with razor-sharp obsidian blades which were deeply set in grooves carved into the head, and cemented in place with bitumen or plant resin as an adhesive. The tepoztopilli was able both to thrust and slash effectively.

Throwing spears also were used extensively in Meso-American warfare, usually with the help of an atlatl.[36] Throwing spears were typically shorter and more stream-lined than the tepoztopilli, and some had obsidian edges for greater penetration.

Native American

Spear_Case,_late_19th_century,_26.792.jpg]] Typically, most spears made by Native Americans were created with materials surrounded by their communities. Usually, the shaft of the spears were made with a wooden stick while the head of the spear was fashioned from arrowheads, pieces of metal such as copper, or a bone that had been sharpened. Spears were a preferred weapon by many since it was inexpensive to create, could more easily be taught to others, and could be made quickly and in large quantities.

Native Americans used the Buffalo Pound method to kill buffalo, which required a hunter to dress as a buffalo and lure one into a ravine where other hunters were hiding. Once the buffalo appeared, the other hunters would kill him with spears. A variation of this technique, called the Buffalo Jump was when a runner would lead the animals towards a cliff. As the buffalo got close to the cliff, other members of the tribe would jump out from behind rocks or trees and scare the buffalo over the cliff. Other hunters would be waiting at the bottom of the cliff to spear the animal to death.[37]

Modern history

Europe

Pikeniere_Wallenstein-Festspiele_Memmingen.jpg

The development of both the long, two-handed pike and gunpowder in Renaissance Europe saw an ever-increasing focus on integrated infantry tactics.[38] Those infantry not armed with these weapons carried variations on the pole-arm, including the halberd and the bill. Ultimately, the spear proper was rendered obsolete on the battlefield. Its last flowering was the half-pike or spontoon,[39] a shortened version of the pike carried by officers and NCOs. While originally a weapon, this came to be seen more as a badge of office, or _leading staff_ by which troops were directed.[40] The half-pike, sometimes known as a boarding pike, was also used as a weapon on board ships until the 19th century.[41]

At the start of the Renaissance, cavalry remained predominantly lance-armed; gendarmes with the heavy knightly lance and lighter cavalry with a variety of lighter lances. By the 1540s, however, pistol-armed cavalry called reiters were beginning to make their mark. Cavalry armed with pistols and other lighter firearms, along with a sword, had virtually replaced lance armed cavalry in Western Europe by the beginning of the 17th century.[42]


Hunting

Spear_fishing_Peru_cropped.jpg with a multi-pronged spear]]

One of the earliest forms of killing prey for humans, hunting game with a spear and spear fishing continues to this day as both a means of catching food and as a cultural activity. Some of the most common prey for early humans were mega fauna such as mammoths which were hunted with various kinds of spear. One theory for the Quaternary extinction event was that most of these animals were hunted to extinction by humans with spears. Even after the invention of other hunting weapons such as the bow the spear continued to be used, either as a projectile weapon or used in the hand as was common in boar hunting.

Types

Boar_Spear_MET_14.25.305_006jan2015.jpg

-   Barred spears: A barred spear has a crossbar beneath the blade, to prevent too deep a penetration of the spear into an animal. The bar may be forged as part of the spearhead or may be more loosely tied by means of loops below the blade. Barred spears are known from the Bronze Age, but the first historical record of their use in Europe is found in the writings of Xenophon in the 5th century BC.[43] Examples also are shown in Roman art. In the Middle Ages, a winged or lugged war-spear was developed (see above), but the later Middle Ages saw the development of specialised types, such as the boar-spear and the bear-spear.[44] The boar-spear could be used both on foot or horseback.

-   Harpoon
-   Trident

Modern revival

Spear hunting fell out of favour in most of Europe in the 18th century, but continued in Germany, enjoying a revival in the 1930s.[45] Spear hunting is still practiced in the USA.[46] Animals taken are primarily wild boar and deer, although trophy animals such as cats and big game as large as a Cape Buffalo are hunted with spears. Alligator are hunted in Florida with a type of harpoon.


In myth and legend

Symbolism

Odin_rides_to_Hel.jpg, carrying the spear Gungnir on his ride to Hel]] Like many weapons, a spear may also be a symbol of power. In the Chinese martial arts community, the Chinese spear (Qiang 槍) is popularly known as the "king of weapons".

The Celts would symbolically destroy a dead warrior's spear either to prevent its use by another or as a sacrificial offering.

In classical Greek mythology Zeus' bolts of lightning may be interpreted as a symbolic spear. Some would carry that interpretation to the spear that frequently is associated with Athena, interpreting her spear as a symbolic connection to some of Zeus' power beyond the Aegis once he rose to replacing other deities in the pantheon. Athena was depicted with a spear prior to that change in myths, however. Chiron's wedding-gift to Peleus when he married the nymph Thetis in classical Greek mythology, was an ashen spear as the nature of ashwood with its straight grain made it an ideal choice of wood for a spear.

The Romans and their early enemies would force prisoners to walk underneath a 'yoke of spears', which humiliated them. The yoke would consist of three spears, two upright with a third tied between them at a height which made the prisoners stoop.[47] It has been surmised that this was because such a ritual involved the prisoners' warrior status being taken away. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the arrangement has a magical origin, a way to trap evil spirits.[48] The word _subjugate_ has its origins in this practice (from Latin _sub_ = under, _jugum_=a yoke).[49] Gombak_Selangor_Batu-Caves-01.jpg, holding his primary weapon, the _Vel_. - located in the Batu Caves, Malaysia.]] In Norse Mythology, the God Odin's spear (named Gungnir) was made by the sons of Ivaldi. It had the special property that it never missed its mark. During the War with the Vanir, Odin symbolically threw Gungnir into the Vanir host. This practice of symbolically casting a spear into the enemy ranks at the start of a fight was sometimes used in historic clashes, to seek Odin's support in the coming battle.[50] In Wagner's opera _Siegfried_, the haft of Gungnir is said to be from the "World-Tree" Yggdrasil.[51]

Other spears of religious significance are the Holy Lance[52] and the Lúin of Celtchar,[53] believed by some to have vast mystical powers.

Sir James George Frazer in _The Golden Bough_[54] noted the phallic nature of the spear and suggested that in the Arthurian Legends the spear or lance functioned as a symbol of male fertility, paired with the Grail (as a symbol of female fertility).

The Hindu god Murugan, known as "God of war" is worshipped by Tamils in the form of the spear called _Vel_, which is the primary weapon of the God.[55]

The term _spear_ is also used (in a somewhat archaic manner) to describe the male line of a family, as opposed to the distaff or female line.
