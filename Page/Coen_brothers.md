Ethan Cohen}} Joel Cohen}}

JOEL COEN (born November 29, 1954) and ETHAN COEN (born September 21, 1957),[1][2] collectively referred to as THE COEN BROTHERS (), are American filmmakers. Their films span many genres and styles, which they frequently subvert or parody.[3] Their most acclaimed works include _Miller's Crossing_ (1990), _Barton Fink_ (1991), _Fargo_ (1996), _The Big Lebowski_ (1998), _No Country for Old Men_ (2007), _True Grit_ (2010), _Inside Llewyn Davis_ (2013), _and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs_ (2018).

The brothers write, direct and produce their films jointly, although until _The Ladykillers_ (2004) Joel received sole credit for directing and Ethan for producing. They often alternate top billing for their screenplays while sharing editing credits under the alias RODERICK JAYNES. They have been nominated for 13 Academy Awards together, and individually for one award each, winning Best Original Screenplay for _Fargo_ and Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay for _No Country for Old Men_. The duo also won the Palme d'Or for _Barton Fink_ (1991).

The Coens have written a number of films they did not direct, including the biographical war drama _Unbroken_ (2014), the historical legal thriller _Bridge of Spies_ (2015), and lesser-known, commercially unsuccessful comedies such as _Crimewave_ (1985), _The Naked Man_ (1998) and _Gambit_ (2012). Ethan is also a writer of short stories, theater and poetry.

Known for many distinctive stylistic trademarks including genre hybridity,[4] the brothers' films _No Country for Old Men_, _A Serious Man_ and _Inside Llewyn Davis_ have been ranked in the BBC's 2016 poll of the greatest motion pictures since 2000.[5]


Background

Early life

Joel and Ethan Coen were born and raised in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.[6] Their mother, Rena (née Neumann), was an art historian at St. Cloud State University,[7] and their father, Edward Coen, was an economist at the University of Minnesota.

Their family is Jewish.[8]

When they were children, Joel saved money from mowing lawns to buy a Vivitar Super 8 camera. Together, the brothers remade movies they saw on television, with their neighborhood friend Mark Zimering ("Zeimers") as the star.[9] Their first attempt was a romp entitled _Henry Kissinger, Man on the Go_. Cornel Wilde's _The Naked Prey_ (1965) became their _Zeimers in Zambia_, which also featured Ethan as a native with a spear.[10]

Joel Coen has said: "In regards to whether our background influences our film making ... who knows? We don't think about it ... There's no doubt that our Jewish heritage affects how we see things."[11]

Education

Joel and Ethan graduated from St. Louis Park High School in 1973 and 1976, respectively, and from Bard College at Simon's Rock in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.[12] Joel then spent four years in the undergraduate film program at New York University, where he made a 30-minute thesis film called _Soundings_. Ethan went on to Princeton University and earned an undergraduate degree in philosophy in 1979.[13] His senior thesis was a 41-page essay, "Two Views of Wittgenstein's Later Philosophy".[14]

Personal lives

Joel has been married to actress Frances McDormand since 1984. They adopted a son from Paraguay named Pedro McDormand Coen.[15] McDormand has acted in several Coen Brothers films, including a minor appearance in _Miller's Crossing_, a supporting role in _Raising Arizona,_ lead roles in _Blood Simple_ and _The Man Who Wasn't There_, her Academy Award-winning role in _Fargo_, and her starring role in _Burn After Reading_. She also did a voice-over in _Barton Fink_.

Ethan married film editor Tricia Cooke in 1990. They have two children: daughter Dusty and son Buster Jacob, who goes to Vassar College.[16]

Both couples live in New York.[17]


Career

1980s

After graduating from New York University, Joel worked as a production assistant on a variety of industrial films and music videos. He developed a talent for film editing and met Sam Raimi while assisting Edna Ruth Paul in editing Raimi's first feature film, _The Evil Dead_ (1981).[18]

In 1984 the brothers wrote and directed _Blood Simple_, their first commercial film together. Set in Texas, the film tells the tale of a shifty, sleazy bar owner who hires a private detective to kill his wife and her lover. The film contains elements that point to their future direction: distinctive homages to genre movies (in this case noir and horror), plot twists layered over a simple story, dark humor, and _mise-en-scène_. The film starred Frances McDormand, who went on to feature in many of the Coen brothers' films (and marry Joel). Upon release the film received much praise and won awards for Joel's direction at both the Sundance and Independent Spirit awards.[19]

Their next project was _Crimewave_ (1985), directed by Sam Raimi and written by the Coens and Raimi. Joel and Raimi also made cameo appearances in _Spies Like Us_ (1985).

The brothers' next film was _Raising Arizona_ (1987), the story of an unlikely married couple: ex-convict H.I. (Nicolas Cage) and police officer Ed (Holly Hunter), who long for a baby but are unable to conceive. When a local furniture tycoon (Trey Wilson) appears on television with his newly born quintuplets and jokes that they "are more than we can handle", H.I. steals one of the quintuplets to bring up as their own. The film featured Frances McDormand, John Goodman, William Forsythe, Sam McMurray, and Randall "Tex" Cobb.

1990s

_Miller's Crossing_, released in 1990, starred Albert Finney, Gabriel Byrne, and John Turturro. The film is about feuding gangsters in the Prohibition era, inspired by Dashiell Hammett's novels _Red Harvest_ (1920) and _The Glass Key_ (serialized in 1930).

The following year, they released _Barton Fink_ (1991); set in 1941, in which a New York playwright, the eponymous Barton Fink (played by John Turturro), moves to Los Angeles to write a B-movie. He settles down in his hotel room to commence writing but suffers writer's block until he is invaded by the man next door (John Goodman). _Barton Fink_ was a critical success, earning Oscar nominations and winning three major awards at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival, including the Palme d'Or.[20] It was their first film with cinematographer Roger Deakins, a key collaborator for the next 25 years.

_The Hudsucker Proxy_ (co-written with Raimi) was released in 1994. In it, the board of a large corporation in 1958 New York City appoints a naive schmo as president (Tim Robbins) for underhanded reasons. The film bombed at the box office ($30 million budget, $3 million gross in the USA), even though it featured Paul Newman and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Frances McDormand appears in a brief uncredited role.

The Coens wrote and directed the crime thriller _Fargo_ (1996), set in their home state of Minnesota. Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), who has serious financial problems, has his wife kidnapped so that his wealthy father-in-law will pay the ransom. His plan goes wrong when the kidnappers deviate from the plan and local cop Marge Gunderson (McDormand) starts to investigate. Produced on a small budget of $7 million, _Fargo_ was a critical and commercial success, with particular praise for its dialogue and McDormand's performance. The film received several awards, including a BAFTA award and Cannes award for direction, and two Oscars: a Best Original Screenplay and a Best Actress Oscar for McDormand.[21][22]

In the Coens' next film, the black comedy _The Big Lebowski_ (1998), "The Dude" (Jeff Bridges), a Los Angeles slacker, is used as an unwitting pawn in a kidnapping plot with his bowling buddies (Steve Buscemi and John Goodman). Despite initially receiving mixed reviews and underperforming at the box office, it is now well received by critics,[23] and is regarded as a classic cult film.[24] An annual festival, Lebowski Fest, began in 2002, and many adhere to the philosophy of "Dudeism".[25] _Entertainment Weekly_ ranked it 8th on their Funniest Movies of the Past 25 Years list in 2008.[26]

_Gates of Eden_, a collection of short stories written by Ethan Coen, was published in 1998.[27][28] The same year, Ethan co-wrote the comedy _The Naked Man_, directed by their storyboard artist J. Todd Anderson.[29]

2000s

]] The Coen brothers' next film, _O Brother, Where Art Thou?_ (2000), was another critical and commercial success. The title was borrowed from the Preston Sturges film _Sullivan's Travels_ (1941), whose lead character, movie director John Sullivan, had planned to make a film with that title.[30] Based loosely on Homer's _Odyssey_ (complete with a cyclops, sirens, _et al._), the story is set in Mississippi in the 1930s and follows a trio of escaped convicts who, after absconding from a chain gang, journey home to recover bank-heist loot the leader has buried—but they have no clear perception of where they are going. The film highlighted the comic abilities of George Clooney as the oddball lead character Ulysses Everett McGill, and of Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro, his sidekicks. The film's bluegrass and old-time soundtrack, offbeat humor and digitally desaturated cinematography made it a critical and commercial hit.[31][32] It was the first feature film to use all-digital color grading.[33] The film's soundtrack CD was also successful, spawning a concert and concert/documentary DVD, _Down from the Mountain._

The Coens next produced another noirish thriller, _The Man Who Wasn't There_ (2001). Set in late 1940s California, a laconic chain-smoking barber (played by Billy Bob Thornton) discovers a way to blackmail his wife's lover and use the proceeds to invest in a dry cleaning business.

The Coens directed the 2003 film _Intolerable Cruelty_, starring George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones, a throwback to the romantic comedies of the 1940s. It focuses on hotshot divorce lawyer Miles Massey and a beautiful divorcée whom Massey managed to prevent from receiving any money in her divorce. She vows to get even with him while, at the same time, he becomes smitten with her. _Intolerable Cruelty_ received generally positive reviews, although it is considered one of the duo's weaker films.[34] Also that year, they executive produced and did an uncredited rewrite of the Christmas black comedy _Bad Santa_, which garnered positive reviews.[35]

In 2004, the Coens made _The Ladykillers_, a remake of the Ealing Studios classic.[36] A professor, played by Tom Hanks, assembles a team to rob a casino. They rent a room in an elderly woman's home to plan the heist. When the woman discovers the plot, the gang decides to murder her to ensure her silence. The Coens received some of the most lukewarm reviews of their careers in response to this film.[37]

They directed two short films for two separate anthology films—_Paris, je t'aime_ (_Tuileries_, 2006) starring Steve Buscemi,[38] and _To Each His Own Cinema_ (_World Cinema_, 2007) starring Josh Brolin.[39] Both films received highly positive reviews.[40][41] at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival]] _No Country for Old Men_, released in November 2007, closely follows the 2005 novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy. Vietnam veteran Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), living near the Texas/Mexico border, stumbles upon, and decides to take, two million dollars in drug money. He must then go on the run to avoid those trying to recover the money, including sociopathic killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who confounds both Llewelyn and local sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones). The plotline is a return to noir themes, but in some respects it was a departure for the Coens; with the exception of Stephen Root, none of the stable of regular Coen actors appears in the film. _No Country_ received nearly universal critical praise, garnering a 94% "Fresh" rating at Rotten Tomatoes.[42] It won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, all of which were received by the Coens, as well as Best Supporting Actor received by Bardem. The Coens, as "Roderick Jaynes", were also nominated for Best Editing, but lost. It was the first time since 1961 (when Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise won for _West Side Story_) that two directors received the Academy Award for Best Director at the same time.[43]

In January 2008, Ethan Coen's play _Almost an Evening_ premiered off-broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company Stage 2, opening to mostly enthusiastic reviews. The initial run closed on February 10, 2008, but the same production was moved to a new theatre for a commercial off-Broadway run at the Bleecker Street Theater in New York City. Produced by The Atlantic Theater Company, it ran there from March 2008 through June 1, 2008.[44] and Art Meets Commerce.[45] In May 2009, the Atlantic Theater Company produced Coen's _Offices_, as part of their mainstage season at the Linda Gross Theater.[46]

_Burn After Reading_, a comedy starring Brad Pitt and George Clooney, was released September 12, 2008, and portrays a collision course between a gym instructor, spies and Internet dating. Released to positive reviews, it debuted at #1 in North America.[47]

In 2009, the Coens directed a television commercial titled "Air Freshener" for the Reality Coalition.[48][49]

They next directed _A Serious Man_, released October 2, 2009, a "gentle but dark" period comedy (set in 1967) with a low budget.[50] The film is based loosely on the Coens' childhoods in an academic family in the largely Jewish suburb of Saint Louis Park, Minnesota;[51] it also drew comparisons to the _Book of Job_.[52][53] Filming took place late in the summer of 2008, in the neighborhoods of Roseville and Bloomington, Minnesota, at Normandale Community College, and at St. Olaf College.[54][55] The film was nominated for the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay.[56]

2010s

_True Grit_ (2010) is based on the 1968 novel of the same name by Charles Portis.[57] Filming was done in Texas and New Mexico. Hailee Steinfeld stars as Mattie Ross along with Jeff Bridges as Marshal Rooster Cogburn. Matt Damon and Josh Brolin also appear in the movie.[58] _True Grit_ was nominated for ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture.[59][60]

jury]]

Ethan Coen wrote the one-act comedy _Talking Cure_, which was produced on Broadway in 2011 as part of _Relatively Speaking_, an anthology of three one-act plays by Coen, Elaine May, and Woody Allen.[61]

_Inside Llewyn Davis_ (2013) is a treatise on the 1960s folk music scene in New York City's Greenwich Village, and very loosely based on the life of Dave Van Ronk.[62] The film stars Oscar Isaac, Justin Timberlake and Carey Mulligan.[63] It won the Grand Prix at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, where it was highly praised by critics.[64] They received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Song for "Please Mr. Kennedy", which is heard in the film.[65]

_Fargo_, a television series inspired by their film of the same name, premiered in June 2014 on the FX network. It is created by Noah Hawley and executive produced by the brothers.[66]

The Coens also contributed to the screenplay for _Unbroken_, along with Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson. The film, directed by Angelina Jolie, and based on Laura Hillenbrand's non-fiction book, _Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption_ (2010) which itself was based on the life of Louis Zamperini, was released on December 25, 2014 to average reviews.[67]

The Coens co-wrote, with playwright Matt Charman, the screenplay for the dramatic historical thriller _Bridge of Spies_, about the 1960 U-2 Incident. The film was directed by Steven Spielberg, and released on October 4, 2015 to critical acclaim.[68] They were nominated for the Best Original Screenplay at the 88th Academy Awards.[69]

The Coens directed the film _Hail, Caesar!_, about a "fixer" in 1950s Hollywood trying to discover what happened to a cast member who vanishes during filming. It stars Coen regulars George Clooney, Josh Brolin, Frances McDormand, Scarlett Johansson and Tilda Swinton, as well as Channing Tatum, Ralph Fiennes, Jonah Hill, and Alden Ehrenreich.[70] The film was released on February 5, 2016.

In 2016, the Coens gave to their longtime friend and collaborator John Turturro the right to use his character of Jesus Quintana from _The Big Lebowski_ in his own spin-off, _Going Places_, which he would also write and direct. The Coens have no involvement in the production. In August 2016, the film began principal photography.[71][72]

The Coens first wrote the script for _Suburbicon_ in 1986. The film was eventually directed by George Clooney and began filming in October 2016. It was released by Paramount Pictures in the fall of 2017.[73]

The Coens most recently directed _The Ballad of Buster Scruggs_, a Western anthology starring Tim Blake Nelson, Liam Neeson, and James Franco. It began streaming on Netflix on November 16, 2018, after a brief theatrical run.[74][75][76]

Planned and uncompleted projects

In a 1998 interview with Alex Simon for _Venice_ magazine, the Coens discussed a project called _The Contemplations_, which would be an anthology of short films based on stories in a leather bound book from a "dusty old library".[77] (Though this project may have influenced or evolved into _The Ballad of Buster Scruggs_, which has the same structure.)

In 2001, Joel stated that "a Cold War comedy called _62 Skidoo_ is one I'd like to do someday".[78]

The Coens had hoped to film James Dickey's novel _To the White Sea_.[79] They were due to start production in 2002, with Jeremy Thomas producing and Brad Pitt in the lead role, but it was canceled when the Coens felt that the budget offered was not enough to successfully produce the film.

In 2008, it was announced that the Coen brothers would write and direct an adaptation of Michael Chabon's novel, _The Yiddish Policemen's Union_ (2007). They were to produce the film with Scott Rudin for Columbia Pictures.[80] In the fall of 2012, however, Chabon told _Mother Jones_ that "the Coen brothers wrote a draft of a script and then they seemed to move on", and that the film rights had "lapsed back to me".[81]

In 2009, the Coen brothers stated that they are interested in making a sequel to _Barton Fink_ called _Old Fink_, which would take place in the 1960s, around the same time period as _A Serious Man_. The brothers also stated that they have had talks with John Turturro in reprising his role as Fink, but they were waiting "until he was actually old enough to play the part".[82]

In 2011, the brothers were working on a television project, called _Harve Karbo_, about a quirky Los Angeles private eye for Imagine Television.[83]

In December 2013, the Coens stated in an interview that they are working on a new musical comedy centered around an opera singer, though they have said it is "not a musical per se". In the same interview, they revealed they are also working on a sword and sandals drama film set in ancient Rome.[84]

In August 2015, it was announced that Warner Bros. had optioned the film rights to Ross Macdonald's novel _Black Money_ for the Coen brothers to potentially write and direct.[85]

In October 2016, _The Hollywood Reporter_ reported that the Coens would work on the screenplay[86] for Fox titled _Dark Web_, and based on Joshuah Bearman's two-part _Wired_ article[87] about Ross Ulbricht and his illicit Silk Road online marketplace. The project originated in 2013, with novelist Dennis Lehane on board for the screenplay. Chernin Entertainment will produce.[88]

Production company

The Coen brothers' own film production company, Mike Zoss Productions located in New York City, has been credited on their films from _O Brother, Where Art Thou?_ onwards.[89] It was named after Mike Zoss Drug, an independent pharmacy in St. Louis Park since 1950 that was the brothers' beloved hangout when they were growing up in the Twin Cities. The name was also used for the pharmacy in _No Country for Old Men_.[90] The Mike Zoss logo consists of a crayon drawing of a horse, standing in a field of grass, with its head turned around as it looks back over its hindquarters.


Directing distinctions

Up to 2003, Joel received sole credit for directing and Ethan for producing, due to guild rules that disallowed multiple director credits to prevent dilution of the position's significance. The only exception to this rule is if the co-directors are an "established duo". Now that they were able to share the director credit the Coen brothers have become only the third duo to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director. The first two pairs to achieve this were Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins (who won for _West Side Story_ in 1961), and Warren Beatty and Buck Henry (who were nominated for _Heaven Can Wait_ in 1978).

Only seven other directors have won three Oscars for the same film, a distinction the duo shares with Billy Wilder, James L. Brooks, Francis Ford Coppola, James Cameron, Peter Jackson, Alejandro G. Iñárritu, and Alfonso Cuarón.

With four Academy Award nominations for _No Country for Old Men_ for the duo (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing as Roderick Jaynes), the Coen brothers have tied the record for the most nominations by a single nominee (counting an "established duo" as one nominee) for the same film. Orson Welles set the record in 1941 with _Citizen Kane_ being nominated for Best Picture (though at the time, individual producers were not named as nominees), Director, Best Actor, and Screenplay. Warren Beatty received the same nominations, first for _Heaven Can Wait_ in 1978 and again in 1981 with _Reds_. Alan Menken also then achieved the same feat when he was nominated for Best Score and triple-nominated for Best Song for _Beauty and the Beast_ in 1991. In 2018, Alfonso Cuarón was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography for _Roma_.


Filmography


Collaborators

is their most frequent acting collaborator]] The Coen brothers frequently cast certain actors in their films, most frequently Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, John Goodman, Jon Polito, George Clooney, and John Turturro. They have worked twice with Jeff Bridges, Scarlett Johansson and Tim Blake Nelson and at least three times with Michael Badalucco, Richard Jenkins, Stephen Root, Bruce Campbell, J.K. Simmons, and Josh Brolin.

The Coens similarly tend to collaborate with certain filmmakers as well, especially Roger Deakins, Jess Gonchor, Skip Lievsay, and Mary Zophres. They used cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld on their first three films, through _Miller's Crossing_, until Sonnenfeld left to pursue his own directing career. Deakins has been the Coen brothers' cinematographer for all their subsequent films except _Burn After Reading_, on which they employed Emmanuel Lubezki,[91] and _Inside Llewyn Davis_ and _The Ballad of Buster Scruggs_, on which they employed Bruno Delbonnel.[92]

Sam Raimi is another frequent collaborator. He helped write _The Hudsucker Proxy_, which the Coen brothers directed, and the Coen brothers helped write _Crimewave_, which Raimi directed. Raimi took tips about filming _A Simple Plan_ (1998) from the Coen brothers, who had recently finished _Fargo_. (Both films are set in blindingly white snow, which reflects a lot of light and can make metering for a correct exposure tricky). Raimi has cameo appearances in _Miller's Crossing_ and _The Hudsucker Proxy_. Raimi and the Coens met when Raimi directed _The Evil Dead_ (1981), for which Joel was hired as an assistant editor.[93]

Carter Burwell has scored all of the Coens' films, aside from _Crimewave_ (1985), although T Bone Burnett produced much of the traditional music in _O Brother, Where Art Thou?_ and _The Ladykillers_, and was in charge of archive music for _The Big Lebowski_.[94] Skip Lievsay handles the sound editing for all of the Coens' films.[95]

Most of the Coens' films have been credited to the editor "Roderick Jaynes", an alias which refers collectively to the two Coen brothers.[96] Tricia Cooke, Ethan's wife, was also an editor on three of their films (_The Big Lebowski_, _O Brother, Where Art Thou?_, and _The Man Who Wasn't There_) after working as assistant editor on four of their earlier films (_Miller's Crossing_, _Barton Fink_, _The Hudsucker Proxy_, and _Fargo_). Michael R. Miller edited _Raising Arizona_ and _Miller's Crossing_.
