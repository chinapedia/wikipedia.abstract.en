The majority of Lebanese people came to Denmark in the 1970s and 1980s, either escaping the Lebanese Civil War or for economic reasons.[1] Per 1 October 2016, 26,404 persons in Denmark were of Lebanese origin.[2]

Most Lebanese in Denmark belong to various Christian denominations (Maronite, Greek Orthodox, Melkite Catholic, Protestant), but there is also a sizable number of Muslims (Sunni and Shi'a) and also some Druze.

According to the Danish Institute for Local and Regional Government Research, in the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), Lebanese pupils constituted 10% of the student population in Denmark. They obtained PISA scores of 421 in mathematics (_Matematik_), 428 in reading (_Læsning_), 401 in science (_Naturfag_), and 422 in problem-solving (_Problem-løsning_). Of the most frequent countries of origin for students examined by the PISA, these were among the lowest scores in all categories.[14] As of the 2015 PISA, Lebanese pupils represent 9% of Denmark’s student population. Their scores have decreased in each of the examined PISA categories except math, scoring 399 in science (399 when unadjusted for socioeconomic status), 404 in reading (405 unadjusted), and 434 in mathematics (434 unadjusted). These PISA scores are generally in the lower range of the most frequent countries of origin for students.[15]
