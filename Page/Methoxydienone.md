METHOXYDIENONE, also known as METHOXYGONADIENE, as well as 3-METHOXY-17-DEHYDRO-18-METHYL-19-NOR-Δ^(2,5(10))-TESTOSTERONE or 13Β-ETHYL-3-METHOXYGONA-2,5(10)-DIEN-17-ONE, is a synthetic anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and progestogen of the 19-nortestosterone group related to levonorgestrel which was never marketed.[1] It was synthesized in the 1960s and 1970s by chemist Herchel Smith and his colleagues while they were developing progestins for use in oral contraceptives.[2] The drug is a potent anabolic when administered via injection with an anabolic:androgenic ratio of approximately 54:27 relative to testosterone propionate and 90:625 relative to nandrolone.[3] Methoxydienone is not 17α-alkylated (instead featuring a ketone at the C17 position) and no data exist regarding its oral activity in humans.[4] It has been sold on the Internet as a designer steroid.[5]
