HARRY JOSEPH BRUNT ( – ) was a Canadian cartoonist who made significant humorous contributions during the era of the Canadian Whites. He is the father of Stephen Brunt, a sports columnist for _The Globe and Mail_.[1]


Biography

Born in Chicago in 1918, Brunt's family moved to Simcoe, Ontario, several years later. He became an artist, and started to work for Bell Features around Christmas 1943.

His contributions to the Canadian Whites were generally featurettes of 2–3 pages in length, cartoony and goofy in nature, whose titles heavily drew on alliteration. Titles included _Goofy Gags_, _Barnacle Bull_, _Kernel Korn_, _Professor Punk_, _Loop the Droop_, _Lank the Yank_, and _Buz and his Bus_. The only title that broke the pattern was his final creation, _J. C. Flatbottom_, which may have had an autobiographical character.

After World War II, Brunt settled in the Hamilton area. He drew editorial cartoons for the _Hamilton Spectator_ in the 1950s, and later for the _Georgetown Independent_ in the 1970s. He was also a painter, and an exhibition of his work was held in Georgetown, Ontario in 1973.[2]

Brunt died in 1987 at the McMaster University Medical Centre in Hamilton, after a lengthy illness.
