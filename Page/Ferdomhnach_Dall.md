FERDOMHNACH DALL, Lector of Kildare and harpist, died 1110.

The Annals of Ulster for 1110 list the death of three Irish churchmen, including:

  Ferdomhnach Dall fer leiginn Cille Dara .i.  sui cruitirechta

  Ferdomnach the blind, lector of Cell Dara, i.e. a master of harping

Ferdomhnach held the important post of _fer leiginn_ (lector), an office associated with men such as Áed Ua Forréid (d. 1056) and Áed Ua Crimthainn (fl. 12th century), though it was also understood in the sense of a _man of learning_. He is perhaps the earliest attested Irish musician noted by name, specifically a '' sui cruitirechta_/_a master of harping''.
