This article contains a LIST OF MAYORS OF BILOXI, MISSISSIPPI, UNITED STATES.


History

After receiving its charter in 1838, Biloxi was classified as a township and elected a president and a board of selectmen. On the eve of the American Civil War, these titles were changed to mayor and aldermen and were part-time positions. In 1919, Biloxi voters opted to have a new full-time government with a mayor and two commissioners elected to four-year terms. This system remained in place until voters again amended the city's governing structure in 1978, approving a mayor-council form of government with a city-wide elected mayor and councilmen elected from seven wards in the city, which went into effect at the 1981 elections.
