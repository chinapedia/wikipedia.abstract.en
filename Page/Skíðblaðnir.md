_SKÍÐBLAÐNIR_ (Old Norse 'assembled from thin pieces of wood'[1]), sometimes anglicized as _SKIDBLADNIR_ or _SKITHBLATHNIR_, is the best of ships in Norse mythology. It is attested in the _Poetic Edda_, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and in the _Prose Edda_ and _Heimskringla_, both written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. All sources note that the ship is the finest of ships, and the _Poetic Edda_ and _Prose Edda_ attest that it is owned by the god Freyr, while the euhemerized account in _Heimskringla_ attributes it to the magic of Odin. Both _Heimskringla_ and the _Prose Edda_ attribute to it the ability to be folded up—as cloth may be—into one's pocket when not needed.


Attestations

References to the ship occur in the _Poetic Edda_, the _Prose Edda_, and in _Heimskringla_. The ship is mentioned twice in the _Poetic Edda_ and both incidents therein occur in the poem _Grímnismál_. In _Grímnismál_, Odin (disguised as _Grímnir_), tortured, starved, and thirsty, imparts in the young Agnar cosmological knowledge, including information about the origin of the ship Skíðblaðnir:

_Skíðblaðnir_ is mentioned several times in the _Prose Edda_, where it appears in the books _Gylfaginning_ and _Skáldskaparmál_. The first mention of _Skíðblaðnir_ in the _Poetic Edda_ occurs in chapter 43, where the enthroned figure of High tells Gangleri (king Gylfi in disguise) that the god Odin is an important deity. High quotes the second of the above-mentioned _Grímnismál_ stanzas in support.[4]

The boat is first directly addressed in chapter 43; there Gangleri asks that, if _Skíðblaðnir_ is the best of ships, what there is to know about it, and asks if there is no other ship as good or as large as it. High responds that while _Skíðblaðnir_ is the finest ship and the most ingeniously created, the biggest ship is in fact _Naglfar_, which is owned by Muspell. The Sons of Ivaldi, who High adds are dwarfs, crafted the ship and gave it to Freyr. High continues that the ship is big enough for all of the gods to travel aboard it with wargear and weapons in tow, and that, as soon as its sail is hoisted, the ship finds good wind, and goes wherever it need be. It is made up of so many parts and with such craftsmanship that, when it is not needed at sea, it may be folded up like cloth and placed into one's pocket. Gangleri comments that _Skíðblaðnir_ sounds like a great ship, and that it must have taken a lot of magic to create something like it.[5]

The next mention of the ship occurs in _Skáldskaparmál_ where, in chapter 6, poetic ways of referring to Freyr are provided. Among other names, Freyr is referred to as "possessor of _Skidbladnir_ and of the boar known as Gullinbursti". The first of the two _Grímnismál_ stanzas mentioned above is then provided as reference.[6]

In chapter 35, a myth explaining _Skíðblaðnir_{{'}}s creation is provided. The chapter details that the god Loki once cut off the goddess's Sif's hair in an act of mischief. Sif's husband, Thor, enraged, found Loki, caught hold of him, and threatened to break every last bone in his body. Loki promises to have the Svartálfar make Sif a new head of hair that will grow just as any other. Loki goes to the dwarfs known as Ivaldi's sons, and they made not only Sif a new head of gold hair but also Skíðblaðnir and the spear Gungnir. As the tale continues, Loki risks his neck for the creation of the devastating hammer Mjöllnir, the multiplying ring Draupnir, and the speedy, sky-and-water traveling, bright-bristled boar Gullinbursti. In the end, Loki's wit saves him his head, but results in the stitching together of his lips. The newly created items are doled out by the dwarfs to Sif, Thor, Odin, and Freyr. Freyr is gifted both Gullinbursti and _Skíðblaðnir_, the latter of which is again said to receive fair wind whenever its sail was set, and that it will go wherever it needs to, and that it can be folded up much as cloth and placed in one's pocket at will.[7]

_Skíðblaðnir_ receives a final mention in _Skáldskaparmál_ where, in chapter 75, it appears on a list of ships.[8]

The ship gets a single mention in the _Heimskringla_ book _Ynglinga saga_. In chapter 7, an euhemerized Odin is said to have had various magical abilities, including that "he was also able with mere words to extinguish fires, to calm the sea, and to turn the winds any way he pleased. He had a ship called _Skíthblathnir_ with which he sailed over great seas. It could be folded together like a cloth."[9]
