In business, a RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION is a transaction that takes place between two parties who hold a pre-existing connection prior to the transaction. An example is how a dominant shareholder may benefit from making one of their companies trade to the other at advantageous prices.[1] Related party transactions can be a reason for a Type II agency relationship, as it is not necessarily in the best interest of minority share owners.[2]

In commercial law, special regulations may apply restricting related party transactions, such as Part 2E of the Australian _Corporations Act 2001_, which requires companies to seek approval from its members for such a transaction to take place.[3]
