_YOUNG AT ART_ is a studio album by jazz alto saxophonist Jesse Davis.


Music and recording

On "East of the Sun", "Davis opens with a moving solo that never loses the lyric", then guitarist Peter Bernstein solos.[1] "Brother Roj" is a medium-tempo waltz that is "dedicated to Davis' older brother, Roger, who brought Jesse his first alto sax".[2]


Critical reception

The AllMusic reviewer wrote that the album is "a fine example of high-quality bebop played by some promising young players", comparing Davis with Cannonball Adderley.[3] _The Skanner_'s reviewer, commenting on Davis, wrote that "I feel he hasn't allowed himself to fully reach his current limits. I hope his next release will hear him loosen the ties to the past and step forward in time".[4]
