HAUWA ALI (died 1995) was a Nigerian writer known for her novels exploring the lives of Muslim women and raising questions about Islamic values and women's independence. Her best-known novel, _Destiny_, won the Delta prize for fiction.


Life

She was born in Gusau in northern Nigeria.[1] She taught at the University of Maiduguri[2] and her novels were published in the late 1980s. In 1995 she died of breast cancer.[3]


Writing

Her fiction is written from the point of view of a young unmarried woman, and presents education as "the gateway to a successful, stimulating future".[4]

The central character of her first novel _Destiny_ (Enugu, 1988) is 16-year-old Farida. The story sets up tensions between, on the one hand, education, employment, independence and a husband of Farida’s choice and, on the other, a husband who persuades her relatives he offers financial security, but tries to coerce her to be subservient and agree to all his choices. Her second novel, _Victory_ (Enugu, 1989), continues some of these themes and also introduces questions about inter-cultural marriage.[5]

One critic makes connections between Farida's problems and Islam, suggesting she shows "submissive acceptance of fate".[6] Another argues against this and emphasises her "unwillingness to be discouraged" and her commitment to prayer, seeing her faith as a positive strength.[7] _Destiny_ has been said to belong to a "tradition of Islamic resurgence, while managing to interrogate the consequence of its rigid application".[8] Ali has been described as one of the women writers in 1990s northern Nigeria "giving voice to [their] creative talents " within "walls of religion and culture". [9]

_Destiny_ won the Delta prize for fiction. [10]
