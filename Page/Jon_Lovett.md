Early life and education

Lovett was born to a Reform Jewish family in Woodbury, Long Island[1] that operated a box factory started by his grandfather.[2] He attended Syosset High School. Lovett graduated from Williams College in 2004 with a degree in math.[3] His senior thesis, _Rotating Linkages in a Normed Plane_,[4] led to a publication in American Mathematical Monthly.[5] Lovett was also the 2004 Williams College Class Speaker at his commencement.[6] After graduation, Lovett spent a year working as a stand-up comic in New York.[7]


Political speechwriter

In 2004, Lovett volunteered for John Kerry's presidential campaign. He was asked to write a statement for the candidate, and his work led to an offer of a writing internship.[8] He then briefly worked in Jon Corzine's Senate office.[9]

He was hired in 2005 to assist Sarah Hurwitz as a speechwriter for then-Senator Hillary Clinton,[10] and he continued to write speeches for her through her 2008 presidential campaign.[11]

When Clinton lost the 2008 Democratic primary contest, Lovett won an anonymous contest to write speeches for President Barack Obama in the White House.[12] Lovett wrote speeches in the Obama administration for three years, working closely with Jon Favreau and David Axelrod.[13] Prominent speeches that he wrote include policy speeches on financial reform and don't ask, don't tell,[14] as well as remarks at the White House Correspondents' Dinner.[15]

Lovett officiated the first same-sex marriage in the White House, secretly and counter to the policy of the Obama administration.[16][17][18]


Subsequent career

Before Barack Obama ran for re-election, Lovett moved to California to become a screenwriter.[19][20] Lovett collaborated with Josh Gad and Jason Winer on _1600 Penn_, of which Lovett was a co-creator, executive producer, and writer from 2012 until 2013.[21] Lovett then worked as a writer, producer, and advisor on season three of HBO's _The Newsroom_.[22]

Starting in March 2016, Lovett co-hosted The Ringer's political podcast _Keepin' it 1600_ with former fellow Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Dan Pfeiffer, and Tommy Vietor.[23]

Shortly after the November 2016 election, Lovett, Favreau and Vietor founded their own company, Crooked Media, and launched a new podcast, _Pod Save America_.[24] In March 2017, Lovett began hosting _Lovett or Leave It_, a panel show podcast from Crooked Media, recorded in front of a live audience in Los Angeles.[25] Lovett and Crooked Media have embarked on national and international tours featuring live versions of _Pod Save America_ and _Lovett or Leave It_.[26]
