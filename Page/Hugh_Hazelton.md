HUGH HAZELTON (born 1946) is an American-born writer and translator, living in Canada and specializing in Latin American works and their interactions with Canadian works.[1] He is multilingual and translates French, Spanish, and Portuguese into English.[2]


Life

Hazelton was born in Chicago and moved to Canada, specifically Montreal, Quebec, in 1969.[3] He lived briefly in Newfoundland and British Columbia but decided to make Montreal his permanent residence.[4] He is a professor emeritus in the Faculty of Arts & Science at Concordia University, where he taught for 25 years before retiring in 2012.[5][6] While he was teaching at the University, he and his colleagues developed a number of Spanish translation courses. As well as Spanish Translation, Hazelton taught Latin American civilization and the history of Spanish language.[7] Currently, Concordia offers a Bachelor of Arts in either French to English or English to French translation, and Spanish translation is offered as a minor.[8][9]

Hazelton spent a number of years working as co-director of the Banff International Literary Translation Centre, where each year 15 literary translators from Canada, the United States, and Mexico participate in a residency program.[10][11]


Works

Hazelton has published four books of poetry: _Crossing the Chaco_ (1982)_, Sunwords (_1982)_, Ojo de papel_ (1988), and _Antimatter_ (2003). He self-translated _Antimatter_ into Spanish, with the Spanish name _Antimateria_.[12] His 2007 book entitled _Latinocanadá: A Critical Study of Ten Latin American Writers of Canada_ won the Best Book award from the Canadian Association of Hispanists for the period of 2007–2009.[13]


Translation

Hazelton began his translation career by translating the work of friends in Montreal, and then started translating poetry for literary reviews.[14] He often translates the work of Spanish-language writers who have immigrated to Canada.[15] Hazelton has translated the work of Aquiles Nazoa, José Acquelin, and Alfonso Quijada Urías, among others.[16][17] In 2006, he won the Governor General's Award for French-to-English translation for his translation of Vétiver, a book of poems by Joël Des Rosiers.[18] The book had previously won two literary awards in Quebec: the Grand Prix du livre de Montréal and the Grand prix Québecor du Festival international de la poésie.[19]
