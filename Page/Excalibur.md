EXCALIBUR () is the legendary sword of King Arthur, sometimes also attributed with magical powers or associated with the rightful sovereignty of Britain. Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone (the proof of Arthur's lineage) are sometimes said to be the same weapon, but in most versions they are considered separate. Excalibur was associated with the Arthurian legend very early on. In Welsh, it is called _Caledfwlch_; in Cornish, _Calesvol_; in Breton, _Kaledvoulc'h_; and in Latin, _Caliburnus_.


Forms and etymologies

The name _Excalibur_ ultimately derives from the Welsh _Caledfwlch_ (and Breton _Kaledvoulc'h_, Middle Cornish _Calesvol_) which is a compound of __ "hard" and __ "breach, cleft". Caledfwlch appears in several early Welsh works, including the prose tale _Culhwch and Olwen_. The name was later used in Welsh adaptations of foreign material such as the _Brut_s (chronicles), which were based on Geoffrey of Monmouth. It is often considered to be related to the phonetically similar _Caladbolg_, a sword borne by several figures from Irish mythology, although a borrowing of _Caledfwlch_ from Irish _Caladbolg_ has been considered unlikely by Rachel Bromwich and D. Simon Evans. They suggest instead that both names "may have similarly arisen at a very early date as generic names for a sword"; this sword then became exclusively the property of Arthur in the British tradition.

Geoffrey of Monmouth, in his _Historia Regum Britanniae_ (_The History of the Kings of Britain_, c. 1136), Latinised the name of Arthur's sword as _Caliburnus_ (potentially influenced by the Medieval Latin spelling _calibs_ of Classical Latin _chalybs_, from Greek _chályps_ [_χάλυψ_] "steel"). Most Celticists consider Geoffrey's _Caliburnus_ to be derivative of a lost Old Welsh text in which _bwlch_ (Old Welsh _bulc[h]_) had not yet been lenited to _fwlch_ (Middle Welsh _vwlch_ or _uwlch_). In the late 15th/early 16th-century Middle Cornish play _Beunans Ke_, Arthur's sword is called _Calesvol_, which is etymologically an exact Middle Cornish cognate of the Welsh _Caledfwlch_. It is unclear if the name was borrowed from the Welsh (if so, it must have been an early loan, for phonological reasons), or represents an early, pan-Brittonic traditional name for Arthur's sword.[1]

In Old French sources this then became _Escalibor_, _Excalibor_, and finally the familiar _Excalibur_. Geoffrey Gaimar, in his Old French _L'Estoire des Engleis_ (1134-1140), mentions Arthur and his sword: "this Constantine was the nephew of Arthur, who had the sword Caliburc" ("_Cil Costentin, li niès Artur, Ki out l'espée Caliburc_").[2][3] In Wace's _Roman de Brut_ (c. 1150-1155), an Old French translation and versification of Geoffrey's _Historia_, the sword is called _Calabrum_, _Callibourc_, _Chalabrun_, and _Calabrun_ (with alternate spellings such as _Chalabrum_, _Calibore_, _Callibor_, _Caliborne_, _Calliborc_, and _Escaliborc_, found in various manuscripts of the _Brut_).[4]

In Chrétien de Troyes' late 12th-century Old French _Perceval_, Arthur's knight Gawain carries the sword _Escalibor_ and it is stated, "for at his belt hung Escalibor, the finest sword that there was, which sliced through iron as through wood"[5] (_"Qu'il avoit cainte Escalibor, la meillor espee qui fust, qu'ele trenche fer come fust"_[6]). This statement was probably picked up by the author of the _Estoire Merlin_, or Vulgate Merlin, where the author (who was fond of fanciful folk etymologies) asserts that Escalibor "is a Hebrew name which means in French 'cuts iron, steel, and wood'"[7] ("_c'est non Ebrieu qui dist en franchois trenche fer & achier et fust_"; note that the word for "steel" here, achier, also means "blade" or "sword" and comes from medieval Latin _aciarium_, a derivative of _acies_ "sharp", so there is no direct connection with Latin _chalybs_ in this etymology). It is from this fanciful etymological musing that Thomas Malory got the notion that Excalibur meant "cut steel"[8] ("{{'}}_the name of it,' said the lady, 'is Excalibur, that is as moche to say, as Cut stele_{{'}}").


Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone

In Arthurian romance, a number of explanations are given for Arthur's possession of Excalibur. In Robert de Boron's _Merlin_, the first tale to mention the "sword in the stone" motif, Arthur obtained the British throne by pulling a sword from an anvil sitting atop a stone that appeared in a churchyard on Christmas Eve.[9][10] In this account, as foretold by Merlin, the act could not be performed except by "the true king," meaning the divinely appointed king or true heir of Uther Pendragon. As Malory writes: "_Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil, is rightwise king born._"[11][12] The identity of this sword as Excalibur is made explicit in the later Prose _Merlin_, part of the Lancelot-Grail cycle (the Vulgate Cycle).[13]

However, in the most famous English-language version of the Arthurian tales, Malory's 15th century Morte Darthur, early in his reign Arthur breaks the Sword from the Stone while in combat against King Pellinore, and is given Excalibur by the Lady of the Lake in exchange for a later boon. Similarly, in the Post-Vulgate Cycle, Excalibur was given to Arthur by the Lady of the Lake sometime after he began to reign. In the Vulgate _Mort Artu_, Arthur is at the brink of death and so orders Griflet to throw the sword into the enchanted lake; after two failed attempts (as he felt such a great sword should not be thrown away), Griflet finally complies with the wounded king's request and a hand emerges from the lake to catch it. This tale becomes attached to Bedivere instead of Griflet in Malory and the English tradition. Malory records both versions of the legend in his _Le Morte d'Arthur_, naming both swords as Excalibur.


Other roles and attributes

Welsh stories

In Welsh legends, Arthur's sword is known as _Caledfwlch_. In _Culhwch and Olwen_, it is one of Arthur's most valuable possessions and is used by Arthur's warrior Llenlleawg the Irishman to kill the Irish king Diwrnach while stealing his magical cauldron. Irish mythology mentions a weapon _Caladbolg_, the sword of Fergus mac Róich, which was also known for its incredible power and was carried by some of Ireland's greatest heroes. The name, which can also mean "hard cleft" in Irish, appears in the plural, _caladbuilc_, as a generic term for "great swords" in _Togail Troi_ ("The Destruction of Troy"), a 10th-century Irish translation of the classical tale.[14][15]

Though not named as Caledfwlch, Arthur's sword is described vividly in _The Dream of Rhonabwy_, one of the tales associated with the _Mabinogion_ (as translated by Jeffrey Gantz): "Then they heard Cadwr Earl of Cornwall being summoned, and saw him rise with Arthur's sword in his hand, with a design of two chimeras on the golden hilt; when the sword was unsheathed what was seen from the mouths of the two chimeras was like two flames of fire, so dreadful that it was not easy for anyone to look."

Other versions

Geoffrey's _Historia_ is the first non-Welsh source to speak of the sword. Geoffrey says the sword was forged in Avalon and Latinises the name "Caledfwlch" as _Caliburnus_. When his influential pseudo-history made it to Continental Europe, writers altered the name further until it finally took on the popular form _Excalibur_ (various spellings in the medieval Arthurian romance and chronicle tradition include: _Calabrun_, _Calabrum_, _Calibourne_, _Callibourc_, _Calliborc_, _Calibourch_, _Escaliborc_, and _Escalibor_[16]). The legend was expanded upon in the Vulgate Cycle and in the Post-Vulgate Cycle which emerged in its wake. Both included the work known as the _Prose Merlin_, but the Post-Vulgate authors left out the _Merlin_ continuation from the earlier cycle, choosing to add an original account of Arthur's early days including a new origin for Excalibur.

In several early French works, such as Chrétien de Troyes' _Perceval, the Story of the Grail_ and the Vulgate _Lancelot Proper_ section, Excalibur is used by Gawain, Arthur's nephew and one of his best knights. This is in contrast to later versions, where Excalibur belongs solely to the king. The challenge of drawing a sword from a stone also appears in the later Arthurian stories of Galahad, whose achievement of the task indicates that he is destined to find the Holy Grail.

In many versions, Excalibur's blade was engraved with phrases on opposite sides: "Take me up" and "Cast me away" (or similar). In addition, when Excalibur was first drawn, in the first battle testing Arthur's sovereignty, its blade blinded his enemies. Malory[17] writes: "_thenne he drewe his swerd Excalibur, but it was so breyght in his enemyes eyen that it gaf light lyke thirty torchys._"[18]

Excalibur's scabbard was said to have powers of its own. Loss of blood from injuries, for example, would not kill the bearer. In some tellings, wounds received by one wearing the scabbard did not bleed at all. In the later romance tradition, including _Le Morte d'Arthur_, the scabbard is stolen from Arthur by his half-sister Morgan le Fay in revenge for the death of her beloved Accolon and thrown into a lake, never to be found again. This act later enables the death of Arthur at the Battle of Camlann.


Arthur's other weapons

Excalibur is by no means the only weapon associated with Arthur, nor the only sword. Welsh tradition also knew of a dagger named Carnwennan and a spear named Rhongomyniad that belonged to him. Carnwennan ("little white-hilt") first appears in _Culhwch and Olwen_, where Arthur uses it to slice the witch Orddu in half. Rhongomyniad ("spear" + "striker, slayer") is also mentioned in _Culhwch_, although only in passing; it appears as simply _Ron_ ("spear") in Geoffrey's _Historia_. Geoffrey also names Arthur's shield as _Pridwen_, but in _Culhwch_, _Prydwen_ ("fair face") is the name of Arthur's ship while his shield is named _Wynebgwrthucher_ ("face of evening").

The Alliterative _Morte Arthure_, a Middle English poem, mentions Clarent, a sword of peace meant for knighting and ceremonies as opposed to battle, which Mordred stole and then used to kill Arthur at Camlann.[19] The Prose _Lancelot_ of the Vulgate Cycle mentions a sword called Seure, which belonged to the king but was used by Lancelot in one battle.[20]


Similar weapons

In Welsh mythology, the _Dyrnwyn_ ("White-Hilt"), one of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain, is said to be a powerful sword belonging to Rhydderch Hael,[21] one of the Three Generous Men of Britain mentioned in the Welsh Triads. When drawn by a worthy or well-born man, the entire blade would blaze with fire. Rhydderch was never reluctant to hand the weapon to anyone, hence his nickname Hael "the Generous", but the recipients, as soon as they had learned of its peculiar properties, always rejected the sword.

There are other similar weapons described in other mythologies. In particular, Claíomh Solais, which is an Irish term meaning "Sword of Light", or "Shining Sword", appears in a number of orally transmitted Irish folk-tales.
