QYAMTA or the SEASON OF RESURRECTION is the fourth liturgical season in the East Syriac Rite. The weeks of Great Resurrection begin on Resurrection Sunday and run to the feast of Pentecost.

The East Syriac Church celebrates the Resurrection of Jesus Christ during these seven weeks: Jesusâ€™ victory over death, sin, suffering and Satan. It is the season where they exult in the new life obtained through the Resurrection of the Saviour. The church also commemorates various events happened after resurrection of Christ such as the visits of Jesus to Apostles and the ascension of Jesus. According to Eastern Christianity, the feast of resurrection is the most important and the greatest feast in the liturgical year. Therefore, the season commemorating the resurrection of Christ also gets a prime importance in the church liturgy. The first week of this season is celebrated as the "Week of weeks" as it is the week of resurrection of Christ.

-   FEAST OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
-   Feast of all confessors (Saints) on first Friday of Qyamta
-   New Sunday or St. Thomas Sunday on second Sunday of Qyamta
