THEODOR SEUSS GEISEL ( or ;[1][2][3] March 2, 1904 – September 24, 1991)[4] was an American children's author, political cartoonist, illustrator, poet, animator, screenwriter, and filmmaker. He is known for his work writing and illustrating more than 60 books under the pen name DOCTOR SEUSS ([5] or [6] abbreviated DR. SEUSS). His work includes many of the most popular children's books of all time, selling over 600 million copies and being translated into more than 20 languages by the time of his death.[7]

Geisel adopted the name "Dr. Seuss" as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College and as a graduate student at Lincoln College, Oxford. He left Oxford in 1927 to begin his career as an illustrator and cartoonist for _Vanity Fair_, _Life_, and various other publications. He also worked as an illustrator for advertising campaigns, most notably for FLIT and Standard Oil, and as a political cartoonist for the New York newspaper _PM_. He published his first children's book _And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street_ in 1937. During World War II, he took a brief hiatus from children's literature to illustrate political cartoons, and he also worked in the animation and film department of the United States Army where he wrote, produced or animated many productions – both live-action and animated – including _Design for Death_, which later won the 1947 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.[8]

After the war, Geisel returned to writing children's books, writing classics like _If I Ran the Zoo_ (1950), _Horton Hears a Who!_ (1955), _If I Ran the Circus_ (1956), _The Cat in the Hat_ (1957), _How the Grinch Stole Christmas!_ (1957), and _Green Eggs and Ham_ (1960). He published over 60 books during his career, which have spawned numerous adaptations, including 11 television specials, five feature films, a Broadway musical, and four television series.

Geisel won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958 for _Horton Hatches the Egg_ and again in 1961 for _And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street_. Geisel's birthday, March 2, has been adopted as the annual date for National Read Across America Day, an initiative on reading created by the National Education Association.


Life and career

Early years

Geisel was born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Henrietta (_née_ Seuss) and Theodor Robert Geisel.[9][10] His father managed the family brewery and was later appointed to supervise Springfield's public park system by Mayor John A. Denison[11] after the brewery closed because of Prohibition.[12] Mulberry Street in Springfield, made famous in his first children's book _And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street_, is near his boyhood home on Fairfield Street.[13] The family was of German descent, and Geisel and his sister Marnie experienced anti-German prejudice from other children following the outbreak of World War I in 1914.[14]

Geisel attended Dartmouth College, graduating in 1925.[15] At Dartmouth, he joined the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity[16] and the humor magazine _Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern_, eventually rising to the rank of editor-in-chief.[17] While at Dartmouth, he was caught drinking gin with nine friends in his room.[18] At the time, the possession and consumption of alcohol was illegal under Prohibition laws, which remained in place between 1920 and 1933. As a result of this infraction, Dean Craven Laycock insisted that Geisel resign from all extracurricular activities, including the _Jack-O-Lantern_.[19] To continue working on the magazine without the administration's knowledge, Geisel began signing his work with the pen name "Seuss". He was encouraged in his writing by professor of rhetoric W. Benfield Pressey, whom he described as his "big inspiration for writing" at Dartmouth.[20]

Upon graduating from Dartmouth, he entered Lincoln College, Oxford, intending to earn a D.Phil. in English literature.[21][22] At Oxford, he met Helen Palmer, who encouraged him to give up becoming an English teacher in favor of pursuing drawing as a career.[23] She later recalled that "Ted's notebooks were always filled with these fabulous animals. So I set to work diverting him; here was a man who could draw such pictures; he should be earning a living doing that."[24]

Early career

Geisel left Oxford without earning a degree and returned to the United States in February 1927,[25] where he immediately began submitting writings and drawings to magazines, book publishers, and advertising agencies.[26] Making use of his time in Europe, he pitched a series of cartoons called _Eminent Europeans_ to _Life_ magazine, but the magazine passed on it. His first nationally published cartoon appeared in the July 16, 1927, issue of _The Saturday Evening Post_. This single $25 sale encouraged Geisel to move from Springfield to New York City.[27] Later that year, Geisel accepted a job as writer and illustrator at the humor magazine _Judge_, and he felt financially stable enough to marry Helen.[28] His first cartoon for _Judge_ appeared on October 22, 1927, and the Geisels were married on November 29. Geisel's first work signed "Dr. Seuss" was published in _Judge_ about six months after he started working there.[29]

In early 1928, one of Geisel's cartoons for _Judge_ mentioned Flit, a common bug spray at the time manufactured by Standard Oil of New Jersey.[30] According to Geisel, the wife of an advertising executive in charge of advertising Flit saw Geisel's cartoon at a hairdresser's and urged her husband to sign him.[31] Geisel's first Flit ad appeared on May 31, 1928, and the campaign continued sporadically until 1941. The campaign's catchphrase "Quick, Henry, the Flit!" became a part of popular culture. It spawned a song and was used as a punch line for comedians such as Fred Allen and Jack Benny. As Geisel gained notoriety for the Flit campaign, his work was in demand and began to appear regularly in magazines such as _Life_, _Liberty_, and _Vanity Fair_.[32]

The money Geisel earned from his advertising work and magazine submissions made him wealthier than even his most successful Dartmouth classmates.[33] The increased income allowed the Geisels to move to better quarters and to socialize in higher social circles.[34] They became friends with the wealthy family of banker Frank A. Vanderlip. They also traveled extensively: by 1936, Geisel and his wife had visited 30 countries together. They did not have children, neither kept regular office hours, and they had ample money. Geisel also felt that traveling helped his creativity.[35]

Geisel's success with the Flit campaign led to more advertising work, including for other Standard Oil products like Essomarine boat fuel and Essolube Motor Oil and for other companies like the Ford Motor Company, NBC Radio Network, and Holly Sugar.[36] His first foray into books, _Boners_, a collection of children's sayings that he illustrated, was published by Viking Press in 1931. It topped _The New York Times_ non-fiction bestseller list and led to a sequel, _More Boners_, published the same year. Encouraged by the books' sales and positive critical reception, Geisel wrote and illustrated an ABC book featuring "very strange animals" that failed to interest publishers.[37]

In 1936, Geisel and his wife were returning from an ocean voyage to Europe when the rhythm of the ship's engines inspired the poem that became his first children's book: _And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street_.[38] Based on Geisel's varied accounts, the book was rejected by between 20 and 43 publishers.[39][40] According to Geisel, he was walking home to burn the manuscript when a chance encounter with an old Dartmouth classmate led to its publication by Vanguard Press.[41] Geisel wrote four more books before the US entered World War II. This included _The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins_ in 1938, as well as _The King's Stilts_ and _The Seven Lady Godivas_ in 1939, all of which were in prose, atypically for him. This was followed by _Horton Hatches the Egg_ in 1940, in which Geisel returned to the use of poetry.

World War II-era work

The_Goldbrick.ogv As World War II began, Geisel turned to political cartoons, drawing over 400 in two years as editorial cartoonist for the left-leaning New York City daily newspaper, _PM_.[42] Geisel's political cartoons, later published in _Dr. Seuss Goes to War_, denounced Hitler and Mussolini and were highly critical of non-interventionists ("isolationists"), most notably Charles Lindbergh, who opposed US entry into the war.[43] One cartoon[44] depicted Japanese Americans being handed TNT after a "call from home", while other cartoons deplored the racism at home against Jews and blacks that harmed the war effort. His cartoons were strongly supportive of President Roosevelt's handling of the war, combining the usual exhortations to ration and contribute to the war effort with frequent attacks on Congress[45] (especially the Republican Party),[46] parts of the press (such as the _New York Daily News_, _Chicago Tribune_, and _Washington Times-Herald_),[47] and others for criticism of Roosevelt, criticism of aid to the Soviet Union,[48][49] investigation of suspected Communists,[50] and other offences that he depicted as leading to disunity and helping the Nazis, intentionally or inadvertently.

In 1942, Geisel turned his energies to direct support of the U.S. war effort. First, he worked drawing posters for the Treasury Department and the War Production Board. Then, in 1943, he joined the Army as a Captain and was commander of the Animation Department of the First Motion Picture Unit of the United States Army Air Forces, where he wrote films that included _Your Job in Germany_, a 1945 propaganda film about peace in Europe after World War II; _Our Job in Japan_; and the _Private Snafu_ series of adult army training films. While in the Army, he was awarded the Legion of Merit.[51] _Our Job in Japan_ became the basis for the commercially released film _Design for Death_ (1947), a study of Japanese culture that won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.[52] _Gerald McBoing-Boing_ (1950) was based on an original story by Seuss and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.[53]

Later years

After the war, Geisel and his wife moved to La Jolla, California, where he returned to writing children's books. He published most of his books through Random House in North America and William Collins, Sons (later HarperCollins) internationally. He wrote many, including such favorites as _If I Ran the Zoo_ (1950), _Horton Hears a Who!_ (1955), _If I Ran the Circus_ (1956), _The Cat in the Hat_ (1957), _How the Grinch Stole Christmas!_ (1957), and _Green Eggs and Ham_ (1960). He received numerous awards throughout his career, but he won neither the Caldecott Medal nor the Newbery Medal. Three of his titles from this period were, however, chosen as Caldecott runners-up (now referred to as Caldecott Honor books): _McElligot's Pool_ (1947), _Bartholomew and the Oobleck_ (1949), and _If I Ran the Zoo_ (1950). Dr Seuss also wrote the musical and fantasy film _The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T._, which was released in 1953. The movie was a critical and financial failure, and Geisel never attempted another feature film. During the 1950s, he also published a number of illustrated short stories, mostly in _Redbook_ Magazine. Some of these were later collected (in volumes such as _The Sneetches and Other Stories_) or reworked into independent books (_If I Ran the Zoo_). A number have never been reprinted since their original appearances.

In May 1954, _Life_ magazine published a report on illiteracy among school children which concluded that children were not learning to read because their books were boring. William Ellsworth Spaulding was the director of the education division at Houghton Mifflin (he later became its chairman), and he compiled a list of 348 words that he felt were important for first-graders to recognize. He asked Geisel to cut the list to 250 words and to write a book using only those words.[54] Spaulding challenged Geisel to "bring back a book children can't put down".[55] Nine months later, Geisel completed _The Cat in the Hat_, using 236 of the words given to him. It retained the drawing style, verse rhythms, and all the imaginative power of Geisel's earlier works but, because of its simplified vocabulary, it could be read by beginning readers. _The Cat in the Hat_ and subsequent books written for young children achieved significant international success and they remain very popular today. In 2009, _Green Eggs and Ham_ sold 540,000 copies, _The Cat in the Hat_ sold 452,000 copies, and _One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish_ (1960) sold 409,000 copies—outselling the majority of newly published children's books.[56]

Geisel went on to write many other children's books, both in his new simplified-vocabulary manner (sold as Beginner Books) and in his older, more elaborate style.

In 1956, Dartmouth awarded Geisel with an honorary doctorate, finally legitimizing the "Dr." in his pen name.

On April 28, 1958, Geisel appeared on an episode of the panel game show _To Tell the Truth_.[57]

Geisel's wife Helen had a long struggle with illnesses, including cancer and emotional pain over Geisel's affair with Audrey Stone Dimond. On October 23, 1967, Helen died by suicide; Geisel married Dimond on June 21, 1968.[58] Although he devoted most of his life to writing children's books, Geisel had no children of his own, saying of children: "You have 'em; I'll entertain 'em."[59] Dimond added that Geisel "lived his whole life without children and he was very happy without children."[60] Audrey oversaw Geisel's estate until her death on December 19, 2018, at the age of 97.[61]

Geisel received the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal from the professional children's librarians in 1980, recognizing his "substantial and lasting contributions to children's literature". At the time, it was awarded every five years.[62] He won a special Pulitzer Prize in 1984 citing his "contribution over nearly half a century to the education and enjoyment of America's children and their parents".[63]


Illness, death, and posthumous honors

Geisel died of oral cancer on September 24, 1991 at his home in La Jolla at the age of 87.[64][65] He was cremated and his ashes were scattered. On December 1, 1995, four years after his death, University of California, San Diego's University Library Building was renamed Geisel Library in honor of Geisel and Audrey for the generous contributions that they made to the library and their devotion to improving literacy.[66]

While Geisel was living in La Jolla, the United States Postal Service and others frequently confused him with fellow La Jolla resident Dr. Hans Suess, a noted nuclear physicist.[67]

In 2002, the Dr. Seuss National Memorial Sculpture Garden opened in Springfield, featuring sculptures of Geisel and of many of his characters. In 2008 he was inducted into the California Hall of Fame. On March 2, 2009, the Web search engine Google temporarily changed its logo to commemorate Geisel's birthday (a practice that it often follows for various holidays and events).[68]

In 2004, U.S. children's librarians established the annual Theodor Seuss Geisel Award to recognize "the most distinguished American book for beginning readers published in English in the United States during the preceding year". It should "demonstrate creativity and imagination to engage children in reading" from pre-kindergarten to second grade.[69]

At Geisel's alma mater of Dartmouth, more than 90 percent of incoming first-year students participate in pre-registration Dartmouth Outing Club trips into the New Hampshire wilderness. It is traditional for students returning from the trips to stay overnight at Dartmouth's Moosilauke Ravine Lodge, where they are served green eggs and ham for breakfast in honor of Dr. Seuss. On April 4, 2012, the Dartmouth Medical School was renamed the Audrey and Theodor Geisel School of Medicine in honor of their many years of generosity to the college.[70]

Dr. Seuss's honors include two Academy Awards, two Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal, and the Pulitzer Prize.

Dr. Seuss has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at the 6500 block of Hollywood Boulevard.[71]


Pen names and pronunciations

Geisel's most famous pen name is regularly pronounced ,[72] an anglicized pronunciation inconsistent with his German surname (the standard German pronunciation is ). He himself noted that it rhymed with "voice" (his own pronunciation being ). Alexander Laing, one of his collaborators on the _Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern_,[73] wrote of it:

Geisel switched to the anglicized pronunciation because it "evoked a figure advantageous for an author of children's books to be associated with—Mother Goose"[74] and because most people used this pronunciation. He added the "Doctor (abbreviated Dr.)" to his pen name because his father had always wanted him to practice medicine.[75]

For books that Geisel wrote and others illustrated, he used the pen name "Theo LeSieg", starting with _I Wish That I Had Duck Feet_ published in 1965. "LeSieg" is "Geisel" spelled backward.[76] Geisel also published one book under the name Rosetta Stone, 1975's _Because a Little Bug Went Ka-Choo!!_, a collaboration with Michael K. Frith. Frith and Geisel chose the name in honor of Geisel's second wife Audrey, whose maiden name was Stone.[77]


Political views

Geisel was a liberal Democrat and a supporter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal. His early political cartoons show a passionate opposition to fascism, and he urged action against it both before and after the United States entered World War II. His cartoons portrayed the fear of communism as overstated, finding greater threats in the House Un-American Activities Committee and those who threatened to cut the United States' "life line"[78] to Stalin and the USSR, whom he once depicted as a porter carrying "our war load".[79]

Seuss_cartoon.png Geisel supported the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. His treatment of the Japanese and of Japanese Americans (between whom he often failed to differentiate) has struck many readers as a moral blind spot.[80] On the issue of the Japanese, he is quoted as saying:

After the war, though, Geisel overcame his feelings of animosity, using his book _Horton Hears a Who!_ (1954) as an allegory for the American post-war occupation of Japan,[81] as well as dedicating the book to a Japanese friend, though Ron Lamothe noted in an interview that even that book has a sense of "American chauvinism" and doesn't mention the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.[82]

In 1948, after living and working in Hollywood for years, Geisel moved to La Jolla, California, a predominantly Republican community.[83]

Geisel converted a copy of one of his famous children's books, _Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now!_, into a polemic shortly before the end of the 1972–1974 Watergate scandal, in which United States president Richard Nixon resigned, by replacing the name of the main character everywhere that it occurred.[84] "Richard M. Nixon, Will You Please Go Now!" was published in major newspapers through the column of his friend Art Buchwald.[85]

The line "a person's a person, no matter _how_ small!!" from _Horton Hears a Who!_ has been used widely as a slogan by the pro-life movement in the United States. Geisel and later his widow Audrey objected to this use; according to her attorney, "She doesn't like people to hijack Dr. Seuss characters or material to front their own points of view."[86] In the 1980s Geisel threatened to sue an anti-abortion group for using this phrase on their stationery, according to his biographer, causing them to remove it.[87] The attorney says he never discussed abortion with either of them,[88] and the biographer says Geisel never expressed a public opinion on the subject.[89] After Seuss' death, Audrey gave financial support to Planned Parenthood.[90]

In his books

Geisel made a point of not beginning to write his stories with a moral in mind, stating that "kids can see a moral coming a mile off." He was not against writing about issues, however; he said that "there's an inherent moral in any story",[91] and he remarked that he was "subversive as hell."[92]

Many of Geisel's books express his views on a remarkable variety of social and political issues: _The Lorax_ (1971), about environmentalism and anti-consumerism; _The Sneetches_ (1961), about racial equality; _The Butter Battle Book_ (1984), about the arms race; _Yertle the Turtle_ (1958), about Adolf Hitler and anti-authoritarianism; _How the Grinch Stole Christmas!_ (1957), criticizing the materialism and consumerism of the Christmas season; and _Horton Hears a Who!_ (1954), about anti-isolationism and internationalism.[93][94]


Geisel wrote most of his books in anapestic tetrameter, a poetic meter employed by many poets of the English literary canon. This is often suggested as one of the reasons that Geisel's writing was so well received.[95][96]

Anapestic tetrameter consists of four rhythmic units called anapests, each composed of two weak syllables followed by one strong syllable (the beat); often, the first weak syllable is omitted, or an additional weak syllable is added at the end. An example of this meter can be found in Geisel's "Yertle the Turtle", from _Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories_:

Some books by Geisel that are written mainly in anapestic tetrameter also contain many lines written in amphibrachic tetrameter, such as these from _If I Ran the Circus_:

Geisel also wrote verse in trochaic tetrameter, an arrangement of a strong syllable followed by a weak syllable, with four units per line (for example, the title of _ONE Fish TWO Fish RED Fish BLUE Fish_). Traditionally, English trochaic meter permits the final weak position in the line to be omitted, which allows both masculine and feminine rhymes.

Geisel generally maintained trochaic meter for only brief passages, and for longer stretches typically mixed it with iambic tetrameter, which consists of a weak syllable followed by a strong, and is generally considered easier to write. Thus, for example, the magicians in _Bartholomew and the Oobleck_ make their first appearance chanting in trochees (thus resembling the witches of Shakespeare's _Macbeth_):

They then switch to iambs for the oobleck spell:


Artwork

Geisel's early artwork often employed the shaded texture of pencil drawings or watercolors, but in his children's books of the postwar period, he generally made use of a starker medium—pen and ink—normally using just black, white, and one or two colors. His later books, such as _The Lorax,_ used more colors.

Geisel's style was unique – his figures are often "rounded" and somewhat droopy. This is true, for instance, of the faces of The grinch and the Cat in the Hat. Almost all his buildings and machinery were devoid of straight lines when they were drawn, even when he was representing real objects. For example, _If I Ran the Circus_ shows a droopy hoisting crane and a droopy steam calliope.

Geisel evidently enjoyed drawing architecturally elaborate objects. His endlessly varied but never rectilinear palaces, ramps, platforms, and free-standing stairways are among his most evocative creations. Geisel also drew complex imaginary machines, such as the _Audio-Telly-O-Tally-O-Count_, from _Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book_, or the "most peculiar machine" of Sylvester McMonkey McBean in _The Sneetches_. Geisel also liked drawing outlandish arrangements of feathers or fur: for example, the 500th hat of _Bartholomew Cubbins_, the tail of _Gertrude McFuzz_, and the pet for girls who like to brush and comb, in _One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish_.

Geisel's illustrations often convey motion vividly. He was fond of a sort of "voilà" gesture in which the hand flips outward and the fingers spread slightly backward with the thumb up. This motion is done by Ish in _One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish_ when he creates fish (who perform the gesture with their fins), in the introduction of the various acts of _If I Ran the Circus_, and in the introduction of the "Little Cats" in _The Cat in the Hat Comes Back_. He was also fond of drawing hands with interlocked fingers, making it look as though his characters were twiddling their thumbs.

Geisel also follows the cartoon tradition of showing motion with lines, like in the sweeping lines that accompany Sneelock's final dive in _If I Ran the Circus_. Cartoon lines are also used to illustrate the action of the senses—sight, smell, and hearing—in _The Big Brag,_ and lines even illustrate "thought", as in the moment when the Grinch conceives his awful plan to ruin Christmas.

Recurring images

Geisel's early work in advertising and editorial cartooning helped him to produce "sketches" of things that received more perfect realization later in his children's books. Often, the expressive use to which Geisel put an image later on was quite different from the original.[97] Here are some examples:

-   An editorial cartoon from July 16, 1941[98] depicts a whale resting on the top of a mountain as a parody of American isolationists, especially Charles Lindbergh. This was later rendered (with no apparent political content) as the Wumbus of _On Beyond Zebra_ (1955). Seussian whales (cheerful and balloon-shaped, with long eyelashes) also occur in _McElligot's Pool_, _If I Ran the Circus_, and other books.
-   Another editorial cartoon from 1941[99] shows a long cow with many legs and udders representing the conquered nations of Europe being milked by Adolf Hitler. This later became the Umbus of _On Beyond Zebra_.
-   The tower of turtles in a 1942 editorial cartoon[100] prefigures a similar tower in _Yertle the Turtle_. This theme also appeared in a _Judge_ cartoon as one letter of a hieroglyphic message, and in Geisel's short-lived comic strip _Hejji_. Geisel once stated that Yertle the Turtle was Adolf Hitler.[101]
-   Little cats A, B, and C (as well as the rest of the alphabet) who spring from each other's hats appeared in a Ford Motor Company ad.
-   The connected beards in _Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are?_ appear frequently in Geisel's work, most notably in _Hejji_, which featured two goats joined at the beard, _The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T._, which featured two roller-skating guards joined at the beard, and a political cartoon in which Nazism and the America First movement are portrayed as "the men with the Siamese Beard".
-   Geisel's earliest elephants were for advertising and had somewhat wrinkly ears, much as real elephants do.[102] With _And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street!_ (1937) and _Horton Hatches the Egg_ (1940), the ears became more stylized, somewhat like angel wings and thus appropriate to the saintly Horton. During World War II, the elephant image appeared as an emblem for India in four editorial cartoons.[103] Horton and similar elephants appear frequently in the postwar children's books.
-   While drawing advertisements for FLIT, Geisel became adept at drawing insects with huge stingers,[104] shaped like a gentle S-curve and with a sharp end that included a rearward-pointing barb on its lower side. Their facial expressions depict gleeful malevolence. These insects were later rendered in an editorial cartoon as a swarm of Allied aircraft[105] (1942), and again as the Sneedle of _On Beyond Zebra_, and yet again as the Skritz in _I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew_.
-   There are many examples of creatures who arrange themselves in repeating patterns, such as the "Two and fro walkers, who march in five layers", and the Through-Horns Jumping Deer in _If I Ran the Circus_, and the arrangement of birds which the protagonist of _Oh, the Places You'll Go!_ walks through, as the narrator admonishes him to "... always be dexterous and deft, and never mix up your right foot with your left."


Publications

Geisel wrote more than 60 books over the course of his long career. Most were published under his well-known pseudonym Dr. Seuss, though he also authored more than a dozen books as Theo LeSieg and one as Rosetta Stone. His books have topped many bestseller lists, sold over 600 million copies, and been translated into more than 20 languages.[106] In 2000, _Publishers Weekly_ compiled a list of the best-selling children's books of all time; of the top 100 hardcover books, 16 were written by Geisel, including _Green Eggs and Ham_, at number 4, _The Cat in the Hat_, at number 9, and _One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish_, at number 13.[107] In the years after his death in 1991, two additional books were published based on his sketches and notes: _Hooray for Diffendoofer Day!_ and _Daisy-Head Mayzie_. _My Many Colored Days_ was originally written in 1973 but was posthumously published in 1996. In September 2011, seven stories originally published in magazines during the 1950s were released in a collection titled _The Bippolo Seed and Other Lost Stories_.[108]

Geisel also wrote a pair of books for adults: _The Seven Lady Godivas_ (1939; reprinted 1987), a retelling of the Lady Godiva legend that included nude depictions; and _You're Only Old Once!_ (written in 1986 when Geisel was 82), which chronicles an old man's journey through a clinic. His last book was _Oh, the Places You'll Go!_, which was published the year before his death and became a popular gift for graduating students.[109]

Adaptations

Seuss_Landing.jpg at Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida]] For most of his career, Geisel was reluctant to have his characters marketed in contexts outside of his own books. However, he did permit the creation of several animated cartoons, an art form in which he had gained experience during World War II, and he gradually relaxed his policy as he aged.

The first adaptation of one of Geisel's works was a cartoon version of _Horton Hatches the Egg_, animated at Warner Bros. in 1942 and directed by Bob Clampett. It was presented as part of the Merrie Melodies series and included a number of gags not present in the original narrative, including a fish committing suicide and a Katharine Hepburn imitation by Mayzie.

As part of the Puppetoon theatrical cartoon series for Paramount Pictures, two of Geisel's works were adapted into stop-motion films by George Pal. The first, "The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins", was released in 1943[115] and nominated for an Academy Award for "Short Subject (Cartoon)" the following year.[116] The second, "And to Think I Saw It on Mulberry Street", with a title slightly altered from the book's, was released in 1944.[117]

In 1959, Geisel authorized Revell, the well-known plastic model-making company, to make a series of "animals" that snapped together rather than being glued together, and could be assembled, disassembled, and re-assembled "in thousands" of ways. The series was called the "Dr. Seuss Zoo" and included Gowdy the Dowdy Grackle, Norval the Bashful Blinket, Tingo the Noodle Topped Stroodle, and Roscoe the Many Footed Lion. The basic body parts were the same and all were interchangeable, and so it was possible for children to combine parts from various characters in essentially unlimited ways in creating their own animal characters (Revell encouraged this by selling Gowdy, Norval, and Tingo together in a "Gift Set" as well as individually). Revell also made a conventional glue-together "beginner's kit" of The Cat in the Hat.

In 1966, Geisel authorized eminent cartoon artist Chuck Jones – his friend and former colleague from the war – to make a cartoon version of _How the Grinch Stole Christmas!_ Geisel was credited as a co-producer under his real name Ted Geisel, along with Jones. The cartoon was narrated by Boris Karloff, who also provided the voice of the Grinch. It was very faithful to the original book, and is considered a classic to this day by many. It is often broadcast as an annual Christmas television special. Jones directed an adaptation of _Horton Hears a Who!_ in 1970 and produced an adaptation of _The Cat in the Hat_ in 1971.

From 1972 to 1983, Geisel wrote six animated specials that were produced by DePatie-Freleng: _The Lorax_ (1972); _Dr. Seuss on the Loose_ (1973); _The Hoober-Bloob Highway_ (1975); _Halloween Is Grinch Night_ (1977); _Pontoffel Pock, Where Are You?_ (1980); and _The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat_ (1982). Several of the specials won multiple Emmy Awards.

A Soviet paint-on-glass-animated short film was made in 1986 called _Welcome_, an adaptation of _Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose_. The last adaptation of Geisel's work before he died was _The Butter Battle Book_, a television special based on the book of the same name, directed by Ralph Bakshi.

A television film titled _In Search of Dr. Seuss_ was released in 1994, which adapted many of Seuss's stories. It uses both live-action versions and animated versions of the characters and stories featured; however, the animated portions were merely edited versions of previous animated television specials and, in some cases, re-dubbed as well.

After Geisel died of cancer at the age of 87 in 1991, his widow Audrey Geisel was placed in charge of all licensing matters. She approved a live-action feature-film version of _How the Grinch Stole Christmas_ starring Jim Carrey, as well as a Seuss-themed Broadway musical called _Seussical_, and both premiered in 2000. _The Grinch_ has had limited engagement runs on Broadway during the Christmas season, after premiering in 1998 (under the title _How the Grinch Stole Christmas_) at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, where it has become a Christmas tradition. In 2003, another live-action film was released, this time an adaptation of _The Cat in the Hat_ that featured Mike Myers as the title character. Audrey Geisel spoke critically of the film, especially the casting of Myers as the Cat in the Hat, and stated that she would not allow any further live-action adaptations of Geisel's books.[118] However, a first animated CGI feature film adaptation of _Horton Hears a Who!_ was approved, and was eventually released on March 14, 2008, to positive reviews. A second CGI-animated feature film adaptation of _The Lorax_ was released by Universal on March 2, 2012 (on what would have been Seuss's 108th birthday). A third adaptation of Seuss' story, the CGI-animated feature film, _The Grinch_, was released by Universal on November 9, 2018.

Four television series have been adapted from Geisel's work. The first, _Gerald McBoing-Boing_, was an animated television adaptation of Geisel's 1951 cartoon of the same name and lasted three months between 1956 and 1957. The second, _The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss_, was a mix of live-action and puppetry by Jim Henson Television, the producers of The Muppets. It aired for one season on Nickelodeon in the United States, from 1996 to 1997. The third, _Gerald McBoing-Boing_, is a remake of the 1956 series.[119] Produced in Canada by Cookie Jar Entertainment (now DHX Media) and North America by Classic Media (now DreamWorks Classics), it ran from 2005 to 2007. The fourth, _The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!_, produced by Portfolio Entertainment Inc., began on August 7, 2010, in Canada and September 6, 2010, in the United States and is producing new episodes .

Geisel's books and characters are also featured in Seuss Landing, one of many islands at the Islands of Adventure theme park in Orlando, Florida. In an attempt to match Geisel's visual style, there are reportedly "no straight lines" in Seuss Landing.[120]

_The Hollywood Reporter_ has reported that Warner Animation Group and Dr. Seuss Enterprises have struck a deal to make new animated movies based on the stories of Dr. Seuss. Their first project will be a fully animated version of _The Cat in the Hat_.[121]

[1] How to Mispronounce “Dr. Seuss” _It is true that the middle name of Theodor Geisel — “Seuss,” which was also his mother's maiden name — was pronounced “Zoice” by the family, and by Theodor Geisel himself. So, if you are pronouncing his full given name, saying “Zoice” instead of “Soose” would not be wrong. You'd have to explain the pronunciation to your listener, but you would be pronouncing it as the family did._
