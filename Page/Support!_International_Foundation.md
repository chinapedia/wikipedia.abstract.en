History

Support! International Foundation was founded in 2014 by Joseph Wan. Joseph was inspired to start his own non-government organisation because of his father's successful rise from humble beginnings. He told _South China Morning Post_, "My dad grew up very poor in Hong Kong...His parents could only afford education until secondary school. But my dad really loved learning, and didn’t want to give up so soon. So, he worked hard in factories and construction sites until the age of 23, when he could finally afford just one year at university in the UK. He ventured off to the UK and worked a night job just to get by. Now, he is director of a multinational engineering consultancy. This showed me that education really made a difference, which is why the organisation is so education focused."[2]

It was founded under three pillars:

Mutual learning

Support! International Foundation aims to create a mutual learning environment and help each other become better through their programs. It is a pure student teaching students environment.

Youth leadership

Support! International Foundation has a number of young volunteers, from instructor to leadership roles. They believe that it is their responsibility to give back to the community, and that it is important for young people to use opportunities to grow as individuals, as well as members of society.[3]

Communities

Support! International Foundation aims to help out the people of Hong Kong in need, such as children who are disregarded and not given as many opportunities to flourish.[4]


Programmes

The organisation runs classes for both children and adults in sport, debate, oral and written English, interviewing, counselling etc.[5]

All three programs centralise on the idea of improving the students’ English, both oral and written, through innovative methods of teaching. Digital learning, drama, and arts & crafts are used to make learning more interesting for the children.[8]

Speak! programme

The Speak! programme is hosted at Man Kiu College and is a program focusing on current-events, international relations as well as domestic affairs.

The two programs for the kids focus on building their English skills, as well as sports education. The children participate in hands-on and fun activities, to make their learning enjoyable.[10]

Chun Wo English Development! Program

The Chun Wo English Development! Program is hosted at the Chinese International School. It hosts two programs that entail sports and English. The students, who are cleaners, are put through an intensive course where they immerse themselves in a pure, English-speaking environment. The goal, in the end, is to equip these cleaners with the abilities and skills they need to work in the ever-changing, ever-growing world.[11]

Point Me! Program

The Point Me! Program is hosted at the Islamic Kasim Tuet Memorial College. It hosts a mentorship programme for the secondary school’s students.

International Foundation's core events which challenge students from all background to engage in issues under the strands of social mobility, education and environmental sustainability.
