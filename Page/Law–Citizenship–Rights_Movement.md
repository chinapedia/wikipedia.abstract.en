The LAW–CITIZENSHIP–RIGHTS MOVEMENT (), QMH (from the English transliteration _qiyyam, muwatana, huqouq_), also known as _Teyar El-Qemih_ (from the Arabic acronym), and translated as WHEAT WAVE MOVEMENT, is a democratic secular multi-ethnic political party established in 2015 in northern Syria.[1][2]


Elected representatives

The Law–Citizenship–Rights Movement currently has three members on the General Federal Assembly of the Syrian Democratic Council (SDC), Salih El-Nebwanî, Majid Hebu (also written Macid Hebo) and Haytham Manna who was a co-leader of the assembly.[3] Manna resigned his leadership role from the SDC on 19 March 2016 in protest at the council's announcement of a federal system for Northern Syria, i.e. at the creation of Rojava.[4]
