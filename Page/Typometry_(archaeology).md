TYPOMETRY in archaeology is the measurement and analysis of artifacts by various methods with metric measurements including length, width, surface area, cutting planes, hafting axis and others.[1] Typometric data is taken along with other criteria including typological, functional, and stylistic criteria, in examination of archaeological finds.[2] The use of computers and mathematics in archaeology, and in particular of automated statistical analysis, have participated in the development of this field.[3] In 1953, Albert Spaulding published the first statistical method for typometry.[4]

These methods use the metric system and assume that measurements reflect (or indicate) structural proofs about a tool. Most typometric methods have a topological perspective of orientation, such as length, width, surface area, cutting planes, hafting axis, etc. "
