JEAN-FRANÇOIS STEINER is a French-Jewish writer born on 17 February 1938 in Paris, France. He is best known for his controversial non-fiction novel _Treblinka: The Revolt of an Extermination Camp_ first published in 1966 as _Treblinka: la révolte d'un camp d'extermination_;[1][2] translated a year later by Helen Weaver for Simon & Schuster.[3] Written in the first person, the book blames members of the Jewish _Sonderkommando_ for assisting the German SS in perpetrating a genocide. Following outrage among French, Jewish and foreign academics,[4] Steiner agreed to republish his book (which became a bestseller),[5] by presenting it as a fictional account of the Treblinka extermination camp operation. The book remains very popular in France.[6][7]


_Treblinka_

When asked upon the publication of his book why death camps such as Treblinka had been 'avoided' by his own French contemporaries, Steiner replied: "In Treblinka, as in all the other extermination camps, the Germans had designed 'the machine' (as they referred to the methods of extermination) in such a way that it would almost run itself. It is the Jews who did everything."[8] Professor Samuel Moyn in his _Treblinka Affair_ explained that Steiner claimed to direct his non-fiction novel at the "problem" of the Jews' complicity in a manner reminiscent of parts of Raul Hilberg's _Destruction of the European Jews_ or Hannah Arendt's _Eichmann in Jerusalem_.[9]
