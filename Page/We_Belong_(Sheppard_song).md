Critical reception

Mike Wass from Idolator said "We Belong" has a "ridiculously catchy vocal hooks and boasts a sing-along chorus" and said it sees "Sheppard exploring '80s synth-funk with enough modern flourishes to avoid sounding dated. All in all, it sounds like another huge hit."[4]

Joe DeAndrea from We Got This Covered said "We Belong" is "Ridiculously catchy and practically 80s-esque, the song almost sounds like a poppier and more predictable version of The 1975."[5]

"We Belong" was the most added song to Australian radio in the week of November 7, 2016.
