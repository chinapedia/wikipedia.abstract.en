A SHOCK SITE is a website that is intended to be offensive or disturbing to its viewers. They contain material of high shock value, generally of a pornographic, scatological, racist, sexist, graphically violent, insulting, vulgar, profane, or otherwise provocative nature.[1] Some shock sites display a single picture, animation, video clip or small gallery, and are circulated via email or disguised in posts to discussion sites as a prank.[2] Steven Jones distinguishes these sites from those that collect galleries of shocking content, such as Rotten.com, as the gallery sites must be searched for content.[3]

Some shock sites have also gained their own subcultures and have become internet memes on their own. Goatse.cx featured a page devoted to fan-submitted artwork and tributes to the site's hello.jpg,[4] and a parody of the image was unwittingly shown by a BBC newscast as an alternative for the then-recently unveiled logo for the 2012 Summer Olympics.[5] A 2007 shock video known as _2 Girls 1 Cup_ also quickly became an Internet phenomenon, with videos of reactions, homages, and parodies widely posted on video sharing sites such as YouTube.[6]


Examples

Bestgore.com

BestGore is notorious for its extremely graphic content, such as photos and videos of murders, suicides and violent accidents. It is currently the most visited shock website in the world, with an estimated 15–20 million monthly visits. In July 2013, the website's creator, Slovakian-Canadian Mark Marek, was charged with one count of "corrupting morals", related to his posting of the video of the murder of Lin Jun on his website.[7] He pleaded guilty and was given a six-month conditional sentence.[8]

Goatse.cx

Goatse[9][10] was one of the best-known shock sites, featuring an image of a man stretching his anus with his hands.[11][12] The site featured a page devoted to fan-submitted artwork and tributes to the site,[13][14] and a parody of the image was also shown by a BBC newscast as an alternative for the then recently unveiled logo for the 2012 Summer Olympics.[15][16]

The site was shut down in 2004; however, various mirror sites featuring the image still exist.[17] In 2012, it was resurrected as an e-mail service.[18]

Meatspin

MEATSPIN is a shock site containing a looping video was (set playing to "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record) by Dead or Alive") of a man and a trans woman engaged in sexual activity while the receiving partner's penis spins endlessly. A counter keeps track of how many "spins" the viewer has watched.[19][20] In 2013, a student at Florida State University hacked the wireless network of his campus and redirected all traffic to Meatspin.[21][22] In 2015 consternation followed when a family restaurant played the website in front of some young children.[23][24] In 2016 the website was played on a public digital billboard in Sweden, resulting in international media attention.[25][26][27][28]

Lemonparty

LEMONPARTY.ORG is a shock site that contains an image of three elderly naked men in a bed kissing and having oral sex. The song "If You Wanna Be Happy" by Jimmy Soul formerly played in the background. The image has been mentioned on some television shows, such as in a sketch on _Talkshow with Spike Feresten_,[29] and dialogue on _Archer_, _The Simpsons_,[30] _The Cleveland Show_, _American Dad!_ and _30 Rock_. _30 Rock_ made at least three allusions to a "Lemon party", including when Liz Lemon's father, Dick Lemon, says, "It wouldn't be a Lemon party without old Dick!"[31][32][33] The website has also been described by Jimmy Fallon on the _Opie and Anthony_ radio show,[34] on Chelsea Handler's TV show _Chelsea Lately_,[35] Michael J. Nelson from RiffTrax.com during the RiffTrax for _Avatar_,[36] by Jon Stewart on _The Daily Show_, and _American Dad!_,[37] by Michael Cera and Jonah Hill during promotion for the film _SuperBad_.[38]
