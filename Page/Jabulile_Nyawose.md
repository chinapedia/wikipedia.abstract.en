JABULILE NYAWOSE (? â€“ June 4, 1982) was a trade unionist and anti-apartheid activist in South Africa. Nyawose was killed in exile by a car bomb in an execution sanctioned by the South African government. She was posthumously honored with a silver Order of Luthuli in 2015.


Biography

Nyawose's family were activists and her father was involved in the African National Congress (ANC).[1] Nyawose was married to Petrus Nyawose, and both were very involved with the Black Allied Workers Union (BAWU).[2] The couple had 3 children together, the youngest of which often spent time at the BAWU headquarters.[3][4] Later, in exile, they had a fourth child.[5]

Nyawose was recruited to act as a contact for two cells of the underground ANC, one run by Dhaya Pillay and the other by Shadrack Maphumulo.[6] When Maphumulo was arrested in 1977, Nyawose and others involved worried they would be found out.[7] Nyawose and her family went into exile, first crossing in to Botswana and then moving to Swaziland.[8] They joined the South African Congress of Trade Unions (SACTU) that was active in Swaziland.[9]

On June 4, 1982, Nyawose and her husband were killed when a car bomb exploded outside of their house.[10] Their three children witnessed the explosion and one, Nonzamo, testified about their death for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.[11] The death was found to be sanctioned by the South African Government.[12]

Nyawose was posthumously awarded a silver Order of Luthuli in 2015.[13]
