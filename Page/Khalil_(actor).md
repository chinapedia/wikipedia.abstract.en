KHALIL was an Indian cinema actor of silent and talkie films. He achieved stardom with silent films like _Gul-E-Bakavali_ (1924), _Kulin Kanta_ (1925), and _Lanka Ni Laadi_ (1925) which was a major success commercially. His other successes included _Cinema Queen_ (1925) with Sulochana, _Draupadi_ (1931), and _Daily Mail_ (1930). Khalil is referred to as the "macho hero" and "first-ever star" of Hindi cinema.[1]

Khalil worked from 1920 to 1941, making a transition to Talkies in 1931 with _Draupadi_ directed by B. P. Mishra, and _Daulat Ka Nasha_ directed by Pesi Karani. Both films were produced by Kohinoor and Imperial Films. He shifted to Calcutta from Bombay in 1934, and immediately "made his mark" with the East India Film Company production _Quismat Ki Kasauti_ (1934), directed by Pesi Karani.[2] He also wrote lyrics for films like _Dard-e-Dil_ (1934).[3]


Career

Silent Films

Khalil's first film was _Krishna Sudama_ (1920), a silent film co-produced by Kohinoor Film Company and Imperial Film Company.[4] He joined the Kohinoor Film Company in 1925, along with other known actors of that time like Raja Sandow, Zubeida and Tara.[5] Some of his notable silent films were _Sati Parvati_ (1920), _Mahasati Ansuya_ (1921), _Rukmani Haran_ (1921), _Malti Madhav_ (1922), _Surya Kumari_ (1922) and _Manorama_ (1924).

In 1924, he acted as a "lecherous Maharaja" in _Kulin Kanta_. The film was based on a true incident cited as the Bawla murder case, and depicted the story of the Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar III of Indore and a dancing girl who wanted to escape from the harem.[6]

In 1925, Khalil acted as a shepherd in love with a princess he saves, in Kohinoor Film Company's fantasy production called _Lanka Ni Laadi_, also known as _Fairy Of Ceylon_. The film was directed by Homi Master with story by Mohanlal G. Dave. It co-starred Gohar and Jamna. The film became Gohar's first "major" hit and "grossed more than any other film in 1925".[7]

Talkies

Khalil joined Indian Talkies 1931, and worked in the two films produced by them, _Draupadi_ and _Daulat Ka Nasha_.[8] _Draupadi_, also called _The Daughter Of King Drupad_, was the story of Draupadi from the epic Mahabharata. It was produced by the Imperial Film Company and directed by Bhagwati Prasad Mishra. Khalil played Lord Krishna with actress Ermiline playing Draupadi.[9] _Daulat Ka Nasha_ was directed by Pesi Karani.

He continued to make his mark with films like _Bharat Mata_ (1932), directed by Pesi Karani, _Niti Vijay_ (1932), directed by Moti Gidwani, _Do Rangi Duniya_, directed by Pesi Karani and _Saubhagya Sundari_, directed by Homi Master. All films were produced by Imperial Film Company.[10]

In 1934, Khalil acted in _Mazdoor_, also known as _The Mill_, which was directed by Mohan Dayaram Bhavnani for Ajanta Cinetone. Written by Munshi Premchand, it was one of the first talkies to be banned by British censors in India.

Khalil shifted from Bombay to Calcutta, where he achieved success working again with Karani in East India Films' _Kismet Ki Kasauti_ (1934). With Madan Theatres Ltd. he worked in _Miss Manorama_ (1935) and _Bulbul-e-Iran_ (1936), directed by Faredoon Irani, and in _Miss Parivartan_, directed by Ezra Mir.[11]

In 1937, Khalil acted in _Whose Darling?_, also called _Kiski Pyari?_. He played the second lead to Jal Merchant and Zubeida. The film was written and directed by Akhtar Nawaz. The advertisement in filmindia called it a "Heart-throbbing Rajput story of love, romance and chivalry". The film was produced by Sunrise Film Co. from The Tollywood Studios.


Personal Life And Death

A Muslim by birth, he performed varied roles in films. His initial acting phase had him playing Hindu Gods in mythology films. He portrayed Krishna and Rama several times.[12] Disenchanted by the communalism arising in the film industry, he made a speech against it at the Indian Motion Pictures Congress on 4 May 1939. A section was quoted in his obituary in the cine-mag _Filmindia_ in 1941:

Khalil died on 28 October 1941, in Calcutta, after a short illness. He was thirty-seven years old and left behind "a widow" and "five children".[13]
