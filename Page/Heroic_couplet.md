A HEROIC COUPLET is a traditional form for English poetry, commonly used in epic and narrative poetry, and consisting of a rhyming pair of lines in iambic pentameter. Use of the heroic couplet was pioneered by Geoffrey Chaucer in the _Legend of Good Women_ and the _Canterbury Tales_,[1] and generally considered to have been perfected by John Dryden and Alexander Pope in the Restoration Age and early 18th century respectively.


Example

A frequently-cited example illustrating the use of heroic couplets is this passage from _Cooper's Hill_ by John Denham, part of his description of the Thames:


History

The term "heroic couplet" is sometimes reserved for couplets that are largely _closed_ and self-contained, as opposed to the enjambed couplets of poets like John Donne. The heroic couplet is often identified with the English Baroque works of John Dryden and Alexander Pope, who used the form for their translations of the epics of Virgil and Homer, respectively. Major poems in the closed couplet, apart from the works of Dryden and Pope, are Samuel Johnson's _The Vanity of Human Wishes_, Oliver Goldsmith's _The Deserted Village_, and John Keats's _Lamia_. The form was immensely popular in the 18th century. The looser type of couplet, with occasional enjambment, was one of the standard verse forms in medieval narrative poetry, largely because of the influence of the Canterbury Tales.


Variations

English heroic couplets, especially in Dryden and his followers, are sometimes varied by the use of the occasional alexandrine, or hexameter line, and triplet. Often these two variations are used together to heighten a climax. The breaking of the regular pattern of rhyming pentameter pairs brings about a sense of poetic closure. Here are two examples from Book IV of Dryden's translation of the _Aeneid_.

_Alexandrine_

_Alexandrine and Triplet_


Modern use

Twentieth-century authors have occasionally made use of the heroic couplet, often as an allusion to the works of poets of previous centuries. An example of this is Vladimir Nabokov's novel _Pale Fire_, the second section of which is a 999-line, 4-canto poem largely written in loose heroic couplets with frequent enjambment.[2] Here is an example from the first canto:
