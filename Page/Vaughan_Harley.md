He was the son of the physician George Harley (1829–1896) and Emma Jessie née Muspratt (1835–1919) and brother of Ethel Brilliana Tweedie.

After travelling the world for a couple of years he studied in Paris with Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux, in Leipzig with Carl Ludwig, in Turin with Angelo Mosso, in Vienna, Budapest and Christiania.[2] In 1893 he was invited by Victor Horsley at University College to establish the first department of pathological chemistry in England; in 1896, on Horsley's retirement he was appointed to the professorship.

In 1905 he married a renowned beauty,[3] Mary 'Ming' née Blagden (1869–1936), daughter of the Rev Henry Blagden (1832–1922), Hon.

They had two daughters: Diana Mary 'Dido' Harley (1906–1964) who was the second wife of Brigadier Eric Greville Earle DSO (1893–1965); and Primrose Harley (1908–1978) who married first in 1936 Lt-Col John Alfred Codrington (1898–1991), they divorced in 1942, and in 1952 she married secondly Lanning Roper (1912–1983).

His London practice was at 25 Harley Street. In 1907 he purchased Walton Hall, Warwickshire as a country house; he established a farm there where he explored his deep interest in scientific farming and bred prize-winning shorthorn cattle, Oxford Downs sheep, shire horses and Large Black pigs.

He died at Walton Hall in 1923.
