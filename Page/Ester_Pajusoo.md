She had three older half-siblings from her father's previous marriage. She graduated from secondary school in Tallinn in 1953 and attended the Estonian Drama Theatre's training studio, graduating in 1957. In 1956, she began using the surname Pajusoo after her marriage to Jüri Pajusoo.[2][3]


Stage career

Ester Pajusoo began an engagement at the Estonian Drama Theatre in 1958, the year following her graduation. Pajusoo has been with the theatre ever since. She made her stage debut at the theatre in Bertolt Brecht's _Mr Puntila and his Man Matti_ in 1958. During her years at the theatre, she has performed in a number of stage productions by such international playwrights and authors as: William Shakespeare, Samuel Beckett, Henrik Ibsen, Evgeny Schwartz, Hjalmar Söderberg, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Yukio Mishima, Arthur Miller and Anton Chekhov, among others.

She would not appear in another film until 2006; in the Roman Baskin directed comedy _Vana daami visiit_.
