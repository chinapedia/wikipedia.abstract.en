EDITH ECCLES (born 1910 in Liverpool; died 1977) was a British classical archaeologist who did work at the British School at Athens and worked with Sir Arthur Evans at Knossos on Crete in the 1930s.[1] She studied at Royal Holloway, University of London.[2]


Career

During the 1930s she was a friend of Mercy Money-Coutts who worked and travelled with her in Greece and beyond.[3] She remained active after the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis that ultimately ended her life.[4]

In 1935, Eccles assisted the archaeologist Spyridon Marinatos with excavations at the cave sanctuary of Arkalochori.[5] She maintained a strong professional relationship with Marinatos throughout her life, which is documented through letters published in 2015.[6]

In 1936, Eccles attended Bryn Mawr College as the Mary Paul Collins Fellow in Archaeology. At that time, she worked on illustrations for Arthur Evans's publication of their excavations at Knossos.[7] Eccles studied Greek Archaeology under Mary Hamilton Swindler,[8] whilst researching gems and seal stones of the Late Minoan and Mycenean periods.[9]
