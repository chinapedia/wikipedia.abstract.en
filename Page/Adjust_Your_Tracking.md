_ADJUST YOUR TRACKING: THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE VHS COLLECTION_ is a 2013 American documentary film written and directed by Dan M. Kinem and Levi Peretic. It released on May 24, 2013 and examines the culture of collecting VHS tapes.[1] To raise funding for the film Kinem and Peretic launched a successful Kickstarter campaign that granted any person that donated $10 or more executive producer status, with over eighty participants donating at or above this amount.[2]


Synopsis

The documentary examines the world of VHS collecting and gives particular attention to collectors of VHS horror. Kinem and Peretic interview several collectors, many of whom state that the most sought after VHS tape is the 1987 Blaxpoitation film _Tales from the QuadeaD Zone_ due to its rarity and cult status.[3] Interviewees give their reasons for collecting and discuss forums and other venues they use to communicate with other collectors such as the online group Horror VHS Collectors.


Reception

Critical reception for _Adjust Your Tracking_ has been positive.[4] _LA Weekly_ rated the film favorably and wrote "Just as important, they don't hinge their arguments solely around nostalgia. More than just retrophiles or stubborn contrarians, _AYT_'s talking heads -- many of whom have thousands upon thousands of tapes in their personal collections -- offer a ground-level perspective on how VHS was the first format to "take cinema out of the movie theater" and democratize the very act of watching movies."[5] _Creative Loafing_ and DVD Talk also reviewed the movie, the latter of which stated that it was "definitely one where your mileage will vary with your personal interest, but if it's in your wheelhouse, it's a treat."[6][7]
