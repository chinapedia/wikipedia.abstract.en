KIDS CLUB is a former American children's programming block that aired on TBN from May 22, 1993 to December 17, 2005. The block was aimed at children between the ages of 2 and 12 years, and offered a mix of children's religious and family-oriented programming.


History

Prior to 1993, TBN's Saturday morning children's block had no branding. Commercial breaks during the block primarily featured public service announcements, interstitials encouraging viewers to support Christian television, and TBN promos. On May 22, 1993, TBN rebranded its children's block as _Kids Club_ and introduced two new shows to the block; _Kids Club_ and _Kids Like You_. The public service announcements and "support Christian television" interstitials were replaced with newer interstitials targeted to kids, as well as scenes from the _Kids Club_ TV series.

On March 30, 2002, the _Kids Club_ TV series aired for the final time on the block, but interstitials related to the series continued to air. On December 24, 2005, TBN rebranded its Saturday morning block as _Smile of a Child TV_.
