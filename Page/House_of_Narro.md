The HOUSE OF NARRO is a _Spanish noble_ lineage originally from _Guipuzcoa_, _Basque Country_.[1] From there, it spread to various provinces and Spanish kingdoms, particularly to _Catalonia_, the current _Rioja_, _Avila_ (_Castile and Leon_) and _America_.[2]

It became important during the proliferation of Castile in the 21st century. It was one of the 100 families who were granted the _Segovia_ area.[3] In fact, there are some towns and villages that carry the name such as; _Narros de Salduena_ in _Avile_ who still have the famous castle of Narros, or the municipality of _Narros_, also in _Avile_, that received its name as it was populated by Naharros in the _XIII century_.[4]

Another example is the palace of Narros in _Zarauz_, _Guipuzcoa_, from the 16th century and belonging from the 17th century to the Marquises of Narros. Nowadays the palace is owned by the Dukes of Granada de Ega.


Coat of arms

The shield is divided into two main sections; in golden background two horizontal blue stripes signifying respect, strength, truth and loyalty. The second portion is composed by four silver spears pointing up, being an emblem of the courageous service and devotion to the honor and _chivalry_, holding in front of them a shield made from the same metal, signifying wisdom, sincerity and peace, with a _rampant lion_ in gold tone underlying courage, that of a valiant warrior who serves his country.[5]


Etymology

The Naharro surname in _Basque language_ denotes "_brambles_" or "group of prickly scrambling shrubs". Sources mention that originally was Nyarro, also coming from the _Basque Country_, in which language would mean "aged wine boot".


Historical facts

The origin of this surname is very controversial so that several legends of its history exist. Some sources mention that it was initially written as Nyarro from the _Basque Country_. Other references place it in _Catalonia_, settled in the village of _Nyer_, in the valley of Mantel, belonging to the Coll de Madona, in what is _France_ today.[6]

Following legends, during the 16th and 17th century centuries region two antagonistic groups, the Narro and the Cadells lived in the _Catalan region_, always being in constant struggles. These clashes took place in Sardinia; Valley Urgel is located in _Lleida_, one of the oldest cities in Spain.

Grouped in bands (giving rise to the term "_bandits_"), Narros and Cadells were so famous in Europe, such as Welves and Guivelinos in Milan, the popes and _Medicis_ in _Florence_, or Beumonts and Agramont in _Navarre_.[7] Such was the rivalry between the two sides that in 1592, the _Barcelona Provincial Council_ tried to expel them. In 1605 Catalan authorities tried to reconcile and reach an agreement between them, the Council Hundred (Consell de Cent Iurats) met with them November 10, 1612, on July 11 and November 9, 1613. At that time the head of the Narros was Don Roque Guinart mentioned in the works of _Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra_, _Don Quixote_.[8]

The period of peace ended by a confrontation between a Cadells and Don Juan de Serallonga (Narro) and, in 1633, Fontanella, head of the Cadells, caught Don Roque and hung him himself. With this, some families of the Narro family decided to migrate to other parts of the _Iberian Peninsula_, the _Balearic Islands_ and the _New World_, becoming in some cases the surname Navarro, Nafarro, Najarro, Narros, etc.

In _Mexico_ the descendants of this lineage have excelled in all areas, from business and politics, to the arts.

The 19th century saw writers of the stature of _Manuel Acuña_ and artists like Maria Narro Narro Valdes. Also, Narro entrepreneurs like Francisco Acuña, Antonio Narro Narro Rodriguez and Ignacio Gomez. The _XX century_ was not left behind in outstanding examples as Ignacio Narro Garcia, a leading implementer of the _Free Trade Agreement of Latin America_ (_LAFTA_), _Dr. Jose Narro Robles_, major medical and rector of the maximum house of studies of Mexico (_UNAM_) and current Secretary of Health.


Surname simplification

Don Pedro Alonso of Naharro, born between 1575 and 1585 married Magdalena Bartholome in 1608 in _Hervias_, in what now is known as _La Rioja_. His son, Don Domingo Alonso de Naharro and Bartholome, also from Hervías, was baptized on November 5, 1628. He married Dona Ysabel de Zerezeda . Daughter of Don Diego and Dona Maria Solares Zerezeda. Don Pedro simplifies the surname and leaves it as "Narro".


Immigration to North America

Don Domingo Alonso de Narro and Zerezeda, originally from _Villar de Torre_, was baptized on February 27, 1666. He married Dona Maria Angulo, originally from _Badarán_, both locations currently in _La Rioja_. She was baptized on April 23, 1768 in the parish of her hometown. Daughter of Don Antonio Angulo Pérez and Maria de San Juan, was born on January 24, 1633, in _Badarán_. Don Antonio was the son of Don Juan Angulo and Dona Maria Perez and Maria de San Juan was the daughter of Pedro and Dona Francisca San Juan of Zeballos, all these from in _Badarán_, _Spain_.

His son, Don Francisco Alonso de Narro and Angulo, a native of _Villar de Torre_, was baptized on October 13, 1701 and moves to _New Spain_ (_Mexico_) in 1716. He married Dona Ysabel Martinez Guajardo and Montes de Oca in the parish of _Santiago de Saltillo_ on September 15, 1724.[9]

The marriage of Don Francisco Alonso de Narro y Angulo (some say the "Alonso" was his _surname_ and not a _middle name_) and Dona Maria Ysabel Martinez Guaxardo and Montes de Oca produced three offspring; Dona Maria Rosa, Don Juan Jose Francisco Alonso and Don Joseph Miguel. From them derive all decedents that today live in _Mexico_, US and places further away such as _Switzerland_.[10]
