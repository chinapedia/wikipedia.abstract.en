ELIZA BROWN (1903–1983), or Liza Brown, was a classic female blues singer and recording artist,[1] who also went by the alias Ozie McPherson and after marriage as Ozie Ware.[2] She was active in the late 1920s, when she recorded several tracks for Columbia Records including "Get On Out of Here" and "Stop Laying That Stuff On Me".[3] Little is known about her outside of her recordings.[4] She married entertainer Sonnie Ware.[5]


Career

Brown made eight recordings for Columbia Records in New York City in September and October 1929.[6] Many of her recordings were duets with Ann Johnson, for two of which, "Get On Out of Here" and "Let’s Get it Straight", the Columbia files originally credited Coot and McPherson but the names have been crossed out.[7] "Get On Out of Here" is a mostly spoken word song except for a sung chorus, the lyrics to which are "Now take it on outa here, take it on outa here".[8] The content of the song concerns a humorous fight between two women, played by Brown and Johnson.[9] In November 1928, as Ozie Ware, she recorded a number of songs with Duke Ellington and his orchestra.[10]
