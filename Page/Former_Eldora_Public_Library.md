The FORMER ELDORA PUBLIC LIBRARY is a historic building located in Eldora, Iowa, United States. On December 30, 1901 the Carnegie Foundation agreed to grant the community $10,000 to build a new library building.[1] The Chicago architectural firm of Patton & Miller designed it in the Renaissance Revival style, and it was dedicated on May 11, 1903. The single-story, brick structure is somewhat rare in that its plan is an asymmetrical massing of intersecting gables.[2] The entrance pavilion is located at the intersection of the two masses. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.[3] In 2010 it was included as a contributing property in the Eldora Downtown Historic District in 2010.[4] The library has subsequently moved to a new facility, and this building has been converted for commercial use.
