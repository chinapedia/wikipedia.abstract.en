ABAKAN (; Khakas: or ) is the capital city of the Republic of Khakassia, Russia, located in the central part of Minusinsk Depression, at the confluence of the Yenisei and Abakan Rivers. As of the 2010 Census, it had a population of 165,214[1]—a slight increase over 165,197 recorded during the 2002 Census[2] and a further increase from 154,092 recorded during the 1989 Census.[3]


History

Abakansky _ostrog_ (), also known as ABAKANSK (), was built at the mouth of the Abakan River in 1675.[4] In the 1780s, the _selo_ of UST-ABAKANSKOYE () was established in this area.[5] It was granted town status and given its current name on 30 April 1931.[6]

Chinese exiles

In 1940, Russian construction workers found ancient ruins during the construction of a highway between Abakan and Askiz. When the site was excavated by Soviet archaeologists in 1941–1945, they realized that they had discovered a building absolutely unique for the area: a large (1500 square meters) Chinese-style, likely Han Dynasty era (206 BC–220 AD) palace. The identity of the high-ranking personage who lived luxuriously in Chinese style, far outside of the borders of the Han Empire, has remained a matter for discussion ever since. Russian archaeologist L.A. Yevtyukhova surmised, based on circumstantial evidence, that the palace may have been the residence of Li Ling, a Chinese general who had been defeated by the Xiongnu in 99 BCE, and defected to them as a result.[7] While this opinion has remained popular, other views have been expressed as well. More recently, for example, it was claimed by A.A. Kovalyov as the residence of Lu Fang (盧芳), a Han throne pretender from the Guangwu era.[8]

Lithuanian exiles

In the late 18th and during the 19th century, Lithuanian participants in the 1794, 1830–1831, and 1863 rebellions against Russian rule were exiled to Abakan. A group of camps was established where prisoners were forced to work in the coal mines. After Stalin's death, Lithuanian exiles from the nearby settlements moved in.[9]


Administrative and municipal status

Abakan is the capital of the republic.[10][11] Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the CITY OF ABAKAN—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts[12] As a municipal division, the City of Abakan is incorporated as ABAKAN URBAN OKRUG.[13]


Economy

The city has a river port, industry enterprises, Katanov State University of Khakasia, and three theatres. Furthermore, it has a commercial center that produces footwear, foodstuffs, and metal products.

Transportation

Abakan (together with Tayshet) was a terminal of the major Abakan-Taishet Railway. Now it is an important railway junction.

The city is served by the Abakan International Airport.


Military

The 100th Air Assault Brigade of the Russian Airborne Troops was based in the city until circa  1996.[14]

Russian Government Cup was played here in 1988 and in 2012.


Geography

Climate

Abakan has a borderline humid continental (Köppen climate classification _Dwb_)/cold semi-arid climate (Köppen _BSk_). Temperature differences between seasons are extreme, which is typical for Siberia. Precipitation is concentrated in the summer and is less common because of rain shadow from nearby mountains.
