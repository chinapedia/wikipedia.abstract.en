Bayat took office in November with a slim majority formed of National Unionists and pro-British Democrats-Patriots. But he left office six months later having lost the votes of all Democrats-Patriots and of some dissident National Unionists, and instead having gained a significant minority composed of loyal National Unionists, neutralist Individuals, and pro-Soviet Tudeh-Liberal
