_TUROK: RAGE WARS_ is an action video game developed by Bit Managers and published by Acclaim Entertainment for the Game Boy Color handheld console in 1999. Although the game is set in the same fictional universe as its Nintendo 64 counterpart, it is a different game. The game received generally favorable reviews from critics.


Gameplay

_Turok: Rage Wars_ is an action game that is presented from a top-down perspective.[1] To progress through the game, the player must control Turok through four large worlds while battling enemies with multiple weapons. Each world consist of multiple levels and some levels feature forced scrolling.[2] Weapons can also be upgraded or combined together to produce different effects.[3] The game employs a password system to prevent the loss of progress.[4] Although the game is set in the same fictional universe as its Nintendo 64 counterpart, it features a different storyline. The story of the game follows Turok as he prevents Dinosoids and Bionosaurs from reaching the Earth through dimensional portals.[5]


Development

_Turok: Rage Wars_ was developed by the Spanish video game company Bit Managers and published by Acclaim Entertainment.[6] Unlike Bit Manager's previous _Turok_ game _Turok 2: Seeds of Evil_, which features a 2D side-scrolling engine, _Turok: Rage Wars_ uses an entirely new engine which allows players to move and jump in eight directions.[7] The music of the game was composed by Alberto Jose González, who also produced the music of the previous Game Boy Color _Turok_ games.[8]


Reception

_Turok: Rage Wars_ received generally favorable reviews from critics. Craig Harris of IGN described it as "a decent action game" that is better than its two predecessors and highlighted the game's new perspective, noting that the fact that the player can move in any direction "gives the game a lot more variety than just a simple run and jump game."[9] However, he criticized the weapons for being unbalanced.[10] Nintendo Power praised the game's graphics for details, use of color and quality animations.[11] Similarly, Miguel Lopez of _GameSpot_ felt that "the levels look suitably lush and alive", but also admitted that the enemy characters did not look as great as the game's other elements.[12]

In a very positive review, the Spanish official Nintendo magazine, _Nintendo Acción_, praised its extensive environments and varied arsenal of weapons, but noted that the controls have minor issues when the player moves diagonally.[13] The French official Nintendo magazine praised the variety of the environments, which range from snow to jungles and deserts, but criticized the game's short length, stating that _Turok: Rage Wars_ can be completed in a few hours.[14]
