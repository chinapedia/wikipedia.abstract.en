History

2001-2008

O'Neil family established Encompass Technologies by late 2001.[1]

Understanding the need to diminish informational siloing, O'Neil and Encompass began development on the first industry integration of a cloud based system. By early 2002 this system was implemented, and was redeveloped in 2010 to be supported on iOS and Android systems.

In January 2007, Encompass opened its first international location in Shijiazhuang, China. This location currently employees 90 employees, focusing on Research and Development.

After multiple smaller office locations, Encompass (US location) purchased their first established location in 2008, 324 Jefferson St. Fort Collins, CO.[2]

2009-Present

Encompass purchased a 1.1-acre site, in 2011, a few blocks away from their current headquarters. The site located on Linden Street began construction on a 37,000 square foot building,[3] including Encompass's 16,000 square foot office space, as well as an event space and 11 apartments. The estimated cost was $9 million, and was developed in partnership between Encompass Technologies and [au]workshop.[4]

Encompass became the first cloud-based warehouse management system in 2011.[5]

January 2015, the Fort Collins headquarters transferred to the completed location at 420 Linden st.[6] The location is shared with upstairs apartments and is estimated to generate $1.2 million in additional tax revenue for Fort Collins through 2031.[7] The headquarters currently has over 90 employees.
