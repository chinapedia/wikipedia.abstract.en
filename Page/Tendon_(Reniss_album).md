Critical reception

The popularity of the single and video "La Sauce" and the album _Tendon_ earned her multiple nominations for awards, including winning the 2017 "Best Central African Artist" at the Kunde Awards (Burkina Faso)[2] and the 2017 "Best Female Urban Artist" at the Canal d'Or Awards (Cameroon).[3] Peabody-Award-winning Afropop Worldwide described _Tendon_ as, "a remarkable piece of work...with the kind of ferocious creativity and assertiveness that suggests an international pop luminary in the making."[4] The album is described on iTunes as a "breathtaking introduction to a sonic innovator who's carving out a singular musical path."[5] Dekashu MacViban of Bakwa Magazine calls "La Sauce" "a refreshingly original take on a dominant Cameroonian genre, and Reniss’ version is urban, full of recognizable social commentary and slang."[6] In 2017, "La Sauce" became the fans' and players' unofficial anthem for the Cameroon's Indominable Lions as they rose to win the 2017 AFCON championship.[7][8] Reniss released five music videos from the album, including "Michael Jackson" (2015), "La Sauce" (2016), "Dashiki" (2016), "Manamüh" (2017), and "Pilon" (2017).
