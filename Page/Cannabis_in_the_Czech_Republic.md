Konopí.JPG Cannafest_2014_(15743632911).jpg CANNABIS IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC is illegal for recreational use, but personal possession has been decriminalized since 1 January 2010 and medical cannabis has been legal since 1 April 2013.[1][2]


Decriminalization

Possession of up to 15 grams of dry cannabis for personal use, or cultivation of up to five plants, is classed as a misdemeanor under laws enacted in 2010 (via a non incrimination decree, 467/2009 Coll.).[3][4] On conviction, a fine of up to 15,000CZK is applicable, but fines are typically much lower.[5] Cannabis is easy to obtain at concerts and in bars. However, cannabis remains illegal, and possession of larger amounts can lead to a jail sentence of one year.[6] Trafficking is treated as a major crime, with the maximum penalty set at 18 years.


Medical cannabis

A bill allowing cannabis to be legally available on prescription in pharmacies as a medicine was passed by the Czech Chamber of Deputies on 7 December 2012,[7] with 126 votes for legalisation and 7 against (27 abstained and 46 were absent from the vote).[8] The Czech Senate passed the bill on 30 January 2013. From the total of 81 senators 67 voted for legalisation and 2 voted against (5 senators abstained and 7 were absent from the vote).[9] The bill also stipulated that only imported cannabis would be allowed for sale in the first year "to ensure standards." After that, sales may expand to include registered, domestic production that is strictly monitored.[10]

The law came into effect on 1 April 2013 and since then medical use of cannabis has been legal and regulated in the Czech Republic.[11] The law allows for 180 g of dry matter per month, as prescribed by specialized physicians, and can be obtained using an electronic prescription form.[12]
