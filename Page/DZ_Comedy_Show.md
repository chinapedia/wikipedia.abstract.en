Format

DZ_Comedy_Show.jpg

_DZ Comedy Show_ is widely similar in its format to NBC's _Last Comic Standing_. Télévision Algérienne talent scouts Mohamed Khassani, Nassim Hadouche, Kamel Abdet and Abdelkader Jeriou hold open casting calls in seven wilayas around Algeria: Algiers, Constantine, Annaba, Oran, Sétif, Béjaïa and Ouargla. They select then, from a group of 400 candidats, only 24 comics aged between 16 and 60 years from the callbacks, who will be invited to participate in a semifinal qualifying round in Algiers, where they will perform and compete against each other. During this round, the 14 finalists will be selected and would move forward to the final or live performances round. In this round, the comics would participate in some type of comedic challenge each television week. Challenges could include performing stand-up, participating in a roast or performing comedy on a specific subject. One comic will be eliminated each week from the competition, until there will be only the "Algeria's Comedy Star of the Year".[3][4]
