GIGA ( or ) is a unit prefix in the metric system denoting a factor of a (short-form) billion (10⁹ or {{gaps). It has the symbol G.

_Giga_ is derived from the Greek word , meaning "giant." The _Oxford English Dictionary_ reports the earliest written use of _giga_ in this sense to be in the Reports of the IUPAC 14th Conference in 1947: "The following prefixes to abbreviations for the names of units should be used: G giga 10⁹×."[1]

When referring to information units in computing, such as gigabyte, giga may sometimes mean (2³⁰), although such use is inconsistent, contrary to standards and has been discouraged by the standards organizations.[2][3] The inconsistency is that _gigabit_ is never (or very rarely) used with the binary interpretation of the prefix, while _gigabyte_ is sometimes used this way. The binary prefix _gibi_ has been adopted for 2³⁰, while reserving _giga_ exclusively for the metric definition.


Pronunciation

In English, the initial _g_ of _giga_ can be pronounced (a hard _g_ as in _giggle_), or (a soft _g_ as in _giant_, like a _j_ sound, which shares its Greek root).[4]

This latter pronunciation was formalised within the United States in the 1960s and 1980s with the issue by the US National Bureau of Standards of pronunciation guides for the metric prefixes.[5] A prominent example is found in the pronunciation of _gigawatts_ in the 1985 film _Back to the Future_.

According to the American writer Kevin Self, a German committee member of the International Electrotechnical Commission proposed _giga_ as a prefix for 10⁹ in the 1920s, drawing on a verse (evidently "Anto-logie") by the German humorous poet Christian Morgenstern that appeared in the third (1908) edition of his _Galgenlieder_ (Gallows Songs).[6][7] This suggests that a hard German __ was originally intended as the pronunciation. Self was unable to ascertain when the (soft _g_) pronunciation came into occasional use, but claimed that as of 1995 it had returned to (hard _g_).[8][9]

In 1998, a poll by the phonetician John C. Wells found that 84% of Britons preferred the pronunciation of _gigabyte_ starting with (as in _gig_), 9% with (as in _jig_), 6% with (_guy_), and 1% with (as in _giant_).[10]


Common usage

-   gigahertz—clock rate of a CPU, for instance, 3 GHz =
-   gigabit—bandwidth of a network link, for instance, 1 Gbit/s = .
-   gigabyte—for instance, for hard disk capacity, 120 GB = ;
-   gigayear or gigaannum—one billion (10⁹) years, sometimes abbreviated Gyr, but the preferred usage is Ga.


Binary prefix

The notation can represent 1,073,741,824 (2³⁰) bytes or 1,000,000,000 bytes. Under the IEC 60027-2 A.2 and ISO/IEC 80000 standards, the correct notation of 2³⁰ is _gibi_ (symbol Gi). So, is 1,073,741,824 bytes or . Despite international standards, the use of = 2³⁰ B is widespread. A laptop advertised as having has 8,589,934,592 bytes of memory: , or .
