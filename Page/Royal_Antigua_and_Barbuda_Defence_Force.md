The ROYAL ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA DEFENCE FORCE is the armed forces of Antigua and Barbuda. The RABDF has responsibility for several different roles: internal security, prevention of drug smuggling, the protection and support of fishing rights, prevention of marine pollution, search and rescue, ceremonial duties, assistance to government programs, provision of relief during natural disasters, assistance in the maintenance of essential services, and support of the police in maintaining law and order.

The RABDF is one of the world's smallest militaries, consisting of 245 personnel. It is much better equipped for fulfilling its civil roles as opposed to providing a deterrence against would-be aggressors or in defending the nation during a war.

The RABDF consists of four major units:

-   Antigua and Barbuda Regiment — comprises four line companies and is the infantry unit and fighting arm of the defence force.
-   Service and Support Unit — provides administrative, logistic and engineer support to the rest of the defence force.
-   Coast Guard — the maritime element of the defence force, and is divided into four units:
    -   Commanding Officer's Office
    -   Engineer Unit
    -   Administration Unit
    -   Flotilla — the flotilla is the operational part of the Coast Guard, and consists of the following water-craft:
