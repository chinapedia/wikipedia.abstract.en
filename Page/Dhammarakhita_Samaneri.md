VARANGGHANA VANAVICHAYEN (born in 1946) is the first women to be ordained a Theravada bhikkhuni (Buddhist nun) in Thailand. She was ordained a novice bhikkhuni on 10 February 2002 in Songdhammakalyani Monastery.[1] The ceremony was attended by eight female monks from Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia. It was conducted in Sri Lankan tradition.[2] Upon the ordination she adopted the name of DHAMMARAKHITA SAMANERI. The Abbess of the nunnery was Dhammananda Bhikkhuni (Professor Chatsumarn Kabilasinga), who is also the first Theravada bhikkhuni in Thailand.[3]

Dhammarakhita graduated with a business degree in Australia. As a lay person she worked as a secretary and translator. Before her ordination in 2002 Dhammarakhita had been a _mae chii_ for nine years.[4] Her ordination was surrounded by controversy and heated discussion in Thai media and politics due to the conservative views surrounding female ordination present in the country.[5] The discussion was, however, less fierce than a year earlier when Dhammananda Bhikkhuni was ordained in Sri Lanka. In 2002 many newspapers supported the decision.[6] Dhammarakhita defended her choice saying: "I know that there might be resistance. But I am prepared, knowing that I am doing the right thing."[7] The ordination has not been yet recognised by the Thai Buddhist religious authorities.[8]


Private life

Dhammarakhita has two children. She divorced her husband while being a mae chii in order to fulfil a vow of celibacy, which is required from monks and nuns.[9]
