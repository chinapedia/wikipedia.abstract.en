PILE is an American indie rock band originally from Boston, Massachusetts now based in Nashville, Tennessee. Starting as the solo act of Rick Maguire in the late 2000s, Pile has been a collective since the release of "Magic Isn't Real" in 2010.[1] To date, Pile has released seven full-length albums. In recent years the band has gained increasing popularity, becoming a prominent part of the Boston indie rock scene and frequently touring through both the US and Europe.[2][3] While remaining outside of the mainstream, the band has been repeatedly recognized for captivating a particularly enthusiastic and dedicated fan base.[4][5] Their sound has been described by _The Village Voice_ as a "distinct blend of melted guitars" with "howling-wolf vocals and shred-free guitar harmonies".[6]


History

Pile released its first album _Demonstration_ on July 7, 2007.[7] In 2009, a second album called _Jerk Routine_ was released.[8] In 2010 Pile formed its current line-up as a band and released the album _Magic Isn't Real_.[9] The band released a 7-inch single called "Big Web" in 2011.[10]

After self-releasing three albums and one single, Pile signed with record label Exploding in Sound in October 2011, and released the first album under this label, _Dripping_, on October 23, 2012.[11][12] The band released a new single, "Special Snowflakes", on March 11, 2014.[13] They continued to release a fifth album, their second under Exploding in Sound, called _You're Better Than This_ on March 3, 2015.[14]

On March 31, 2017, they released their sixth album, _A Hairshirt of Purpose._[15]

On April 25, 2018, Pile released the single "Keep the Last Light On", which had previously been released as part of the _Boston Sessions, Vol. 1: Beast_ compilation.

On August 28, 2018, Maguire announced, in an email to Pile's fans, that guitarist Matt Becker had stepped out of the band indefinitely and bass player Matt Connery had stepped out temporarily. Chappy Hull and Alex Molini would be playing guitar and bass on the next album and tour. It was later revealed that Maguire had moved from Boston, and was now living in a house with Hull and Molini in Nashville.
