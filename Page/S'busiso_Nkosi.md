Nkosi made six appearances for the in the 2016 Varsity Shield competition, scoring one try against [10] and two in their 63–30 victory over the [11] as his side won seven of their eight matches in the competition.

In March 2016, Nkosi was included in a South Africa Under-20 training squad,[14] and made the cut to be named in a reduced provisional squad a week later.[15] He was released from the South Africa Under-20's training camp to play two matches for the in the 2016 Currie Cup qualification series – playing off the bench in a 48–18 victory over Namibian side the in his first class debut[16] and starting their 24–16 victory over a fortnight later[17] – before being included in the final South Africa Under-20 squad for the 2016 World Rugby Under 20 Championship tournament to be held in Manchester, England.[18] He started in their opening match in Pool C of the tournament as South Africa came from behind to beat Japan 59–19.[19] He also started their other two pool matches as South Africa were beaten 13–19 by Argentina in their second match,[20] but bounced back to secure a 40-31 bonus-point victory over France in their final pool match[21] to secure a semi-final place as the best runner-up in the competition.
