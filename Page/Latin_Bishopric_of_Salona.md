The LATIN BISHOPRIC OF SALONA was a Roman Catholic diocese centred on Amfissa (medieval Salona), in Central Greece, during the period of Frankish rule there after the Fourth Crusade. The see was suppressed with the conquest of the region by the Ottoman Turks in 1410, but is retained by the Catholic Church as a titular see. It has been vacant since 1964.

The see is attested for the first time in the _Provinciale Romanum_, a list of the sees subordinate to the See of Rome, dating to 1228. It lists Salona as one of the eight suffragan sees of the Latin Archbishopric of Athens. The absence of Salona as a see in previous _Notitiae Episcopatuum_ of the Orthodox Patriarchate of Constantinople has led to the Bishopric of Salona being usually considered a new foundation. Raymond-Joseph Loenertz however suggested that it was actually a replacement of the Greek Orthodox bishopric in nearby Loidoriki, and is followed by Kenneth Setton.
