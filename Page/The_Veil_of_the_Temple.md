_THE VEIL OF THE TEMPLE_ is a piece of choral music by British composer Sir John Tavener. Identified by Tavener as "the supreme achievement of my life",[1] [2] it is set for four choirs, several orchestras and soloists and lasts at least seven hours.[3] It is based on text from a number of religions, and received its world premiere performance at the Temple Church, London in June 2003.[4]


Structure

The piece is split into eight cycles. The first seven follow the same structure, with each cycle being a higher key than the previous.[5] For example, Cycles I to VII open with a soprano solo.[6] This is then followed by a setting of the kyrie in either English or the original Greek. Successive cycles add additional musical complexity and words to each movement, with the result that cycle I takes about 20 minutes to perform, but cycle VII takes 1.5 hours.[7]

Cycles I to VII use the following structure:[8]
