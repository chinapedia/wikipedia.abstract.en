is a Japanese role-playing video game developed by Compile Heart and published by Idea Factory. The game contains key staff from Bandai Namco's _Tales_ series of video games, including character designer Kosuke Fujishima, and scenario writer Takumi Miyajima. The game was released for PlayStation 4 in Japan in July 2016 and in North American and Europe in June 2017.[1] A Windows version was released worldwide in April 2018.


Gameplay

The game plays as a Japanese role-playing game, but also includes visual novel segments where the player must interview characters to identify a potential traitor among the player's party of characters.[2] Similar to gameplay mechanics found in _Ace Attorney_ and _Danganronpa_ games, the player must review statements from characters and try to identify contradictions in their accounts of events.[3]


Story

The game takes place in an alternate history version of Japan in 1929 dealing with the repercussions of a fallen meteorite named the "Black Garnet".[4] The meteorite starts the spread of a disease called "Chimera", which causes people to turn into dangerous and destructive creatures, leading to the death of 3% of the world's population and the infection of many more.[5] The player takes control of the character of Asahi, a member of the "Special Force Valkyrie" ordered to eradicate the Chimera-infected people to stop the spread of the virus.[6][7]


Development

The game was first announced in February 2016 in an issue of _Weekly Famitsu_ under the name _Black Rose Valkyrie_.[8] The game was initially scheduled for release on June 30 in Japan, but was later delayed almost a month to July 21, to improve the game's quality.[9] In November, Idea Factory announced they would be releasing the game in English in North America and Europe in the first half of 2017, under the new name _Dark Rose Valkyrie_.[10] The change in name was largely due to copyright issues in English regions.[11]

The game features staff from Namco Bandai's long-running _Tales_ series, including character designer Kosuke Fujishima, and scenario writer Takumi Miyajima, both of which notably worked together on _Tales of Symphonia_ and _Tales of the Abyss_.[12]

On May 2, 2017 Idea Factory International has announced a limited edition for Dark Rose Valkyrie.[13]


Reception and sale

In the game's debut week in Japan, it was the third best-selling new game, and fourth best-selling overall, selling 12,682 copies at retail.[14]
