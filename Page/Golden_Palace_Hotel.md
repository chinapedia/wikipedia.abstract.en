The Golden Palace Hotel Resort and Spa is located on a hill near Mount Teghenis of the Tsaghkunyats mountain range, approximately 2100 meters above sea level,[4] around 55 km north of the capital Yerevan. The resort is adjacent to the Tsaghkadzor ski resort and the Tsaghkadzor ski lift, on 34/1 Tandzaghbyur Street. The Tsaghkadzor Olympic Sports Complex is also very close to the resort.
