JASON ERIC NASH (born May 23, 1973)[1] is an American actor, writer, director, comedian, podcaster, and YouTube personality. Best known for his channel on Vine, he was also a semi-finalist on _Last Comic Standing_ in 2010.[2] In 2016, Nash co-produced and starred in the movie, _FML_ alongside friend and fellow YouTuber, Brandon Calvillo.


Career

Jason Nash moved to Los Angeles with the aspiration of becoming a comedian. Years into his life in Los Angeles, Nash built a presence on Vine and had over two million followers.[3] This was his first crack at the social media world, before becoming a Youtuber later on in his career. Nash trained with the Upright Citizens Brigade and started his career as a member of the sketch troupe "Price, Nash and Blieden". The trio developed television shows for Fox and NBC and were chosen three times to perform at the Aspen Comedy Festival.[4]

Nash wrote, directed and starred in his Comedy Central web series "Jason Nash Is Married", which was based on his one-man show "In the Land of Tall Buildings and Red Fire Engines".[5] A film version of "Jason Nash Is Married" was released in 2014 starring Busy Philipps.[6] Nash also created the web series "How to Be a Man and The Shaman".[7] In 2016, Nash starred and directed his own screenplay, a road trip comedy film "FML" featuring fellow Vine star Brandon Calvillo.[8]

Nash co-created the long-running podcast "Guys with Feelings" which debuted in 2006.[9] He has developed shows for Fox, NBC,[10] CBS, Oxygen and IFC. He has also acted in various shows including an opening of _House MD_ episode 'The Tyrant', _The Simpsons_, _Drake & Josh._ Nash is currently a YouTube vlogger, and has over 1.6 million subscribers on his main channel.[11] Nash became a Youtube Vlogger after being discovered by fellow Viner, David Dobrik, one night at a comedy club. He began his Youtube career as a character in David Dobrik's vlogs, and soon began to upload his own videos. His first video was uploaded on December 2, 2016.[12]

Nash also runs a weekly podcast named "Views" with fellow YouTube personality David Dobrik. During its debut in 2017, "Views" climbed to #3 on the iTunes charts.[13] Jason Nash and David Dobrik also took their podcast on a live tour across the US in summer of 2018, with their fellow youtube friends, called the "Vlog Squad".[14] They called it the "VIEWS" Tour. This included performances from other Youtubers such as Scotty Sire, live stories and a live Q&A session.[15] Nash has stated that he is focused on Youtube as his career and because of this he uploads multiple times a week. For approximately one year, Nash had a second channel titled "Jason Nash Family" dedicated to his life with his children, Charley and Wyatt.[16] This channel was later shut down by the request of his ex-wife Marney, who requested that the children would not be on the internet in such a drastic way. Because of this, Nash has put all his attention to his main Youtube channel.


Personal life

Nash graduated from Medfield High School in 1991 and then attended college at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. After he left college, he worked as an assistant to Norm Macdonald on _Saturday Night Live_. Nash moved to Hollywood in 2001 when he was cast on the sketch show Random Play for VH1.[17]

Nash was married to Marney Hochman. They have two children, Wyatt and Charley.[18] Hochman and Nash got divorced sometime in 2017. Nash had a relationship with fellow YouTuber Trisha Paytas from 2018 to 2019. They are in a off and on relationship, so it's unclear if they are not together anymore. [19]

In July 2018, Nash addressed his struggle with bipolar disorder in a YouTube video.[20]

In May 2019, David Dobrik became his stepfather when he married Jasonâ€™s mother, Lorraine Nash.[21]
