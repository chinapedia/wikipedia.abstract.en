DEMOCRATIC PROGRESSIVE PARTY OF HONG KONG () was a small localist political party in Hong Kong established by Yeung Ke-cheong (楊繼昌) in 2015. It considered Chinese rule in Hong Kong foreign and promoted the right of Hong Kongers to self-determination.[1]

The party advocated non-violent struggle against what it saw as Chinese colonial rule, in sharp contrast to the more strident localists of Civic Passion and Hong Kong Indigenous.[2] Yeung, the party's chairman, also hosted an online programme critical of other localists, especially Yeung's former mentor Wong Yuk-man, for their militant and populist tendencies.

In the 2016 Hong Kong Legislative Council election, Yeung formed a joint ticket with Hong Kong Localism Power's Jonathan Ho Chi-kwong. Yeung's candidacy was disqualified by the Electoral Affairs Commission as he did not sign both the original and additional confirmation forms to pledge to uphold the Hong Kong Basic Law.[3] He campaigned for Ho who defeated incumbent Wong by a margin of 424 votes.

On 26 March 2017, party chairman Yeung Ke-cheong announced the dissolution of the party.
