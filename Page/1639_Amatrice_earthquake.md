The 1639 AMATRICE EARTHQUAKE[1] occurred on 7 October 1639 near Amatrice,[2] in the upper valley of the river Tronto, at the time part of the Kingdom of Naples, now Italy.


History

Nuova_e_vera_relazione_del_terribile_e_spaventoso_terremoto_successo_nella_Citt√†_della_Matrice_e_suo_Stato.jpg The princes Orsini left the city destroyed by the earthquake,[3] whose shock lasted fifteen minutes and caused about 500 deaths (although many bodies remained under the rubble). Damage was estimated between 400,000 and 1 million scudi of the time.[4]

The next 14 October there was a strong aftershock.[5]

Many inhabitants fled to the countryside, where tents were set up, while others found refuge in the church of San Domenico.[6] Among the buildings destroyed or badly damaged, there were: the princes Orsini's palace[7] (that at the time of the earthquake they were out of town), the Palazzo del Reggimento (Regiment's palace), the church of the Holy Crucifix, and other houses.[8] Rosaries and processions were organized by the people to invoke the end of earthquakes.[9] There were also heavy losses of the cattle (the main source of income at the time), which forced the population to migrate to Rome and Ascoli Piceno.[10]

The effects of the earthquake were described in detail in a report published by Carlo Tiberi in 1639, subsequently revised and updated in a second edition of the same year.
