The 2017 TENNESSEE TITANS SEASON was the franchise's 48th season in the National Football League and the 58th overall. It also marked the franchise's 21st season in the state of Tennessee as well as the second full season under head coach Mike Mularkey. They equaled their record from a year ago, and not only that, with a 15–10 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 17, they clinched their first playoff berth since 2008. In the first round, the Titans rallied from a 21–3 halftime deficit against the Chiefs to win 22–21, winning their first playoff game since 2003. However, they were defeated by the New England Patriots in the Divisional Round by the score of 35–14. Despite making the playoffs and winning a playoff game, this would be Mularkey's final year coaching the Titans, as they parted ways after the season ended. This is also the last season where the Titans wore their uniform design since 1999.

AFC Wild Card Playoffs: at (#4) Kansas City Chiefs

Marcus Mariota became the first quarterback in NFL playoff history to throw a touchdown to himself. In addition, the Titans won their first playoff game since 2003.

AFC Divisional Playoffs: at (#1) New England Patriots

Rookie Corey Davis caught his first career touchdowns. These would not be enough, however, as the top-seeded/defending champion Patriots steamrolled the Titans, 35-14. With the loss, the Titans' season ended, with a record of 10-8. With the Patriots losing to the Eagles three weeks later in Super Bowl LII, the Titans would have the third-longest championship drought of any team in the NFL, going back to 1961 when they were the Houston Oilers.
