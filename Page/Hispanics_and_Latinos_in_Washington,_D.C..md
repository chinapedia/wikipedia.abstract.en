In 2016 the Latino community made up nine percent of Washington, D.C.'s population,[1] and 44.9 percent of non-English-speaking households spoke Spanish.[2] The district’s Latino population has been increasing steadily since the 1980s as its total population has declined. More immigrants from Latin American countries have settled in the district, and there has been an increase in births to Latina mothers compared to other racial and ethnic groups.[3] Latinos living in D.C. are more likely to be immigrants than non-Latinos, and Latino immigrants in the district are predominantly from El Salvador, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic.[4] D.C. Latino households are more likely to consist of a married couple than non-Latino households, and include more children.[5]


Demographics

The population of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the district is 54,749, nine percent of its population.[6] Over 800,000 Latinos live in the Washington metropolitan area. Latinos in the district. have a median household income of nearly $61,000, the highest Latino income in the United States. One-fourth of Hispanic adults in the district have at least a bachelor's degree, nearly double the national Latino rate. However, there is a significant education gap in the population; the number of Hispanic adults with less than a ninth-grade education is about the same as the number with bachelor's and advanced degrees.[7]


Culture

Although the district’s Latino population has historically lived in its northwest quadrant (primarily in Wards 1, 2, and 3),[8] changes in the city’s neighborhoods and housing market have resulted in a demographic shift. The district’s housing boom, which began in 2001 and peaked in 2006, affected Latino neighborhoods; the Latino population has increased along Ward 4's southern border and declined in Wards 2 and 3.[9]

Hispanic plays are performed year-round at the GALA Hispanic Theatre. Cultural programs and events for the Latino community thrive across the city, including frequent concerts by Latin music artists such as Juanes, Shakira, Alejandro Fernández, Juan Gabriel, and Ricky Martin. Latinos are widely represented in the LGBT community. Hispanic television channels include Univision, Telemundo, and Azteca America, and radio stations include El Sol and Radio Viva. Latin music is heard in supermarkets and restaurants. There are about five Spanish-language newspapers, including the _Washington Hispanic_, _El Tiempo Latino_ and _El Pregonero_.

Most government programs and facilities provide services in Spanish. The Washington Metro and Metrobus provide announcements and schedules[10] in English and Spanish.

Bilingual staff may be found in most supermarkets, pharmacies, restaurants, and laundromats. The Latino Federation of Greater Washington is the region's largest group of Latino organizations.

  : Recent Fiesta DC dates

Fiesta DC

Fiesta DC, an annual celebration of Latino heritage held on the third Sunday in September,[17][18] has been held for over 45 years.[19][20][21] The celebration had taken place between the 900 and 1400 blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue. After the construction of Trump Tower at 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue, Fiesta DC organizers moved the festival to the area between 300 and 700 Pennsylvania Avenue. According to Fiesta DC president Maria Patricia Corrales, the move was due to the cost of installing barriers which would preserve the building's parking area.[22] A Parade of the Nations[23][24][25] takes place the day before the festival.
