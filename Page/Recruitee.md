It includes a careers site editor for employer branding, a plugin for sourcing (personnel), job board integration, email and calendar synchronization.

History

In 2011, Perry Oostdam met Pawel Smoczyk on Founder2be, a social network that helps aspiring entrepreneurs find their co-founder. Working remotely from the Netherlands and Poland, they put together their first product - a mobile activation game called GeoRun.[1]

In 2014, Oostdam and Smoczyk pivoted the business and built Recruitee out of their own frustration with the hassles of hiring.[2] They believe hiring should be a team effort, not only for founders and HR alone.[3][4]

After its launch, Recruitee quickly became popular and got an undisclosed amount of seed funding in September 1, 2015. Its board members include Dutch entrepreneurs Robert Pijselman and Luc Brandts.[5]

In November 2015, Recruitee announced a partnership with Rockstart, an accelerator in Amsterdam.[6] Recruitee set up a Talent Pool that let applicants apply to job openings from all startups that are and were affiliated with Rockstart.

Recruitee's current clients include Vice (magazine), Usabilla, and Vlisco.[7]
