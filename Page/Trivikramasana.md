Etymology and origins

The name of this pose comes from Trivikrama, a figure in Hindu mythology whose name means "three strides", and "asana" meaning "posture" or "seat".[1]

The pose is ancient, being one of those depicted in the 13th - 18th century statues of Bharatnatyam dance that decorate the Eastern Gopuram of the Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram.[2]

A pose named Trivikramasana is illustrated in the 19th century _Sritattvanidhi_, but the yoga scholar Norman Sjoman notes that the illustration depicts a different standing balance, Durvasasana.[3]


Description and variations

In the standing pose, one leg is stretched straight up beside the body and the ankle is grasped with one hand. The other arm is stretched straight out sideways.[4]

The reclining form of the pose (supine splits) is _Supta Trivikramasana_.[5][6][7] In _Light on Yoga_, B. K. S. Iyengar marks it as a difficult pose at level 39.[8]
