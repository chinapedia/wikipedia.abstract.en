Plot

The film is a narrative which emerges through five different timelines and geographies within the state of Karnataka, encapsulating the lives of four people with a common friend and their love lives while sending across a strong message relating to the common man. Four individuals, each with their own dreams and aspirations, get framed for crimes they did not commit and land up in jail. First Hakki Gopala (Prem) who is cheated and sent to jail. Second Krishna Rao (Diganth) who is blamed for the murder of his pregnant friend Maria (Priyamani). Third Surya Shetty(Vijay Raghavendra) who is dragged in a false murder case and fourth Mohammed Anwar (Prajwal Devaraj) who is blamed for a bomb blast. They all are linked with their friend Manjunath (Chikkanna). They meet a school teacher Vishwanath (Kashinath) who not only shows them hope but also stirs up a passion towards reform. He reveals that he had a daughter Ramya (Manvitha Harish) who loved the son of MLA Krishnamurthy (Avinash). This angers Krishnamurthy and gets Ramya raped and killed and blames Vishwanath for it. They four decide to help Vishwanath in his objective.

The story takes place in the cities of Bangalore in 1986, followed by 1995 in Mysore, 2000 in Mangalore and 2007 in Bijapur. The present day is depicted in 2017, in the Central Jail of Bellary and ends in the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha premises in Belagavi. It ends on a happy note as Vishwanath is proved innocent , but the four heroes are shot by commandoes in the end.

Where as tear eyed Pushpa(Aindrita Rai), Gopala's girlfriend now grown old, Bhoomika (Bhavana), Surya's girlfriend and Gowri (Deepa Sannidhi),Anwar's girlfriend watch it with utter disbelief.
