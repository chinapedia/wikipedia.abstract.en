_PROBERGROTHIUS ANGOLENSIS_, sometimes known as the WELWITSCHIA BUG, is a species of true bug found in the Namib desert and nearby regions. The species has been recognized under a misattributed name, _Probergrothius sexpunctatus,_ for several decades, but _sexpunctatus_ is a separate species that occurs farther to the north.[1]

They are best known for their association with the unusual plant _Welwitschia mirabilis_, also endemic to the area, but it is in doubt whether they actually serve a role in pollination or only drink _Welwitschia_ sap.[2] In addition, they may spread a fungus, _Aspergillus niger_, in the process, which is harmful to developing seeds.

It is yellowish with four black markings on its wings, while _P. sexpunctatus_ is more reddish, and the anterior spots are separate, so the wings have six black markings.
