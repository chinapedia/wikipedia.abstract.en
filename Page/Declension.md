In linguistics, DECLENSION is the changing of the form of a word, generally to express its syntactic function in the sentence, by way of some inflection. The inflectional change of verbs is called conjugation.

Declensions may apply to nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and articles to indicate number (e.g. singular, dual, plural), case (e.g. nominative case, accusative case, genitive case, dative case), gender (e.g. masculine, neuter, feminine), and a number of other grammatical categories.

Declension occurs in many of the world's languages. Declension is an important aspect of language families like American Indian (such as Quechuan), Indo-European (German, Slavic, Sanskrit, Latin), Bantu (Zulu), Semitic (Modern Standard Arabic), Finno-Ugric (Hungarian, Finnish), Turkic (Turkish).

Old English was an inflectional language, but it has greatly abandoned inflectional changes as it evolved into Modern English. Though traditionally classified as synthetic, Modern English has moved towards an analytic language.


History

It is agreed that Ancient Greeks had a "vague" idea of the forms of a noun in their language. A fragment of Anacreon seems to confirm this idea. Nevertheless, it cannot be concluded that the Ancient Greeks actually knew what the cases were. The Stoics developed many basic notions that today are the rudiments of linguistics. The idea of grammatical cases is also traced back to the Stoics, but it's still not completely clear what the Stoics exactly meant with their notion of cases.[1][2]


Modern English

In Modern English, the system of declensions is very simple compared to some other languages, so much so that the term _declension_ is rarely applied to English in practice. Most nouns in English have distinct singular and plural forms and have distinct plain and possessive forms. Plurality is most commonly shown by the clitic _-s_ (or _-es_), whereas possession is always shown by the clitic _-'s_ (or by just the apostrophe for most plural forms ending in _s_) attached to the noun. Consider, for example, the forms of the noun _girl_:

               Singular   Plural
  ------------ ---------- --------
  PLAIN        girl       girls
  POSSESSIVE   girl's     girls'

Most speakers pronounce all of the forms other than the singular plain form (_girl_) exactly the same (though the elided possessive-indicating _s_ of the plural possessive may be realised as [z] in some speakers' pronunciations, being separated from the plural-indicating _s_ normally by a central vowel such as [ɨ̞]). By contrast, a few nouns are slightly more complex in their forms. For example:

               Singular   Plural
  ------------ ---------- --------
  PLAIN        man        men
  POSSESSIVE   man's      men's

In that example, all four forms are pronounced in a distinct manner.

There can be other derivations from nouns that are not usually considered declensions. For example, the proper noun _Britain_ has the associated descriptive adjective _British_ and the demonym _Briton_. Though these words are clearly related and are generally considered cognates, they are not specifically treated as forms of the same word and thus not declensions.

Pronouns in English have even more complex declensions. For example:

                           Singular   Plural
  ------------------------ ---------- --------
  SUBJECTIVE               I          we
  OBJECTIVE                me         us
  DEPENDENT POSSESSIVE     my         our
  INDEPENDENT POSSESSIVE   mine       ours

Whereas nouns do not distinguish between the subjective (nominative) and objective (oblique) cases, some pronouns do; that is, they decline to reflect their relationship to a verb or preposition, or case. Consider the difference between _he_ (subjective) and _him_ (objective), as in "He saw it" and "It saw him"; similarly, consider _who_, which is subjective, and the objective _whom_ (although it is increasingly common to use _who_ for both).

The one situation where gender is still clearly part of the English language is in the pronouns for the third person singular. Consider the following:

+------------------------+-----------+----------+--------------+----------+
|                        | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter       | Neuter   |
|                        |           |          | (non-person) | (person) |
+========================+===========+==========+==============+==========+
| SUBJECTIVE             | he        | she      | it           | they     |
+------------------------+-----------+----------+--------------+----------+
| OBJECTIVE              | him       | her      | it           | them     |
+------------------------+-----------+----------+--------------+----------+
| DEPENDENT POSSESSIVE   | his       | her      | its          | their    |
+------------------------+-----------+----------+--------------+----------+
| INDEPENDENT POSSESSIVE | his       | hers     | its          | theirs   |
+------------------------+-----------+----------+--------------+----------+

The distinguishing of neuter for persons and non-persons is somewhat peculiar to English. This has existed since the 14th century.[3][4] However, the use of the so-called _singular they_ is often restricted to specific contexts, depending on the dialect or the speaker. It is most typically used to refer to a single person of unknown gender (e.g., "someone left their jacket behind"). Its use has expanded in recent years due to increasing social recognition of persons who do not identify themselves as male or female.[5] Note that the _singular they_ still uses plural verb forms, reflecting its origins.

For nouns, in general, gender is not declined in Modern English, or at best one could argue there are isolated situations certain nouns may be modified to reflect gender, though not in a systematic fashion. Loan words from other languages, particularly Latin and the Romance languages, often preserve their gender-specific forms in English, e.g. _alumnus_ (masculine singular) and _alumna_ (feminine singular). Similarly, names borrowed from other languages show comparable distinctions: _Andrew_ and _Andrea_, _Paul_ and _Paula_, etc. Additionally, suffixes such as _-ess_, _-ette_, and _-er_ are sometimes applied to create overtly gendered versions of nouns, with marking for feminine being much more common than marking for masculine. Many nouns can actually function as members of two genders or even all three, and the gender classes of English nouns are usually determined by their agreement with pronouns, rather than marking on the nouns themselves.

Most adjectives are not declined. However, when used as nouns rather than adjectives, they do decline (e.g., "I'll take the reds", meaning "I'll take the red ones" or as shorthand for "I'll take the red wines"). Also, the demonstrative determiners _this_ and _that_ are declined for number, as _these_ and _those_. Some adjectives borrowed from other languages are, or can be, declined for gender, at least in writing: _blond_ (male) and _blonde_ (female). Adjectives are not declined for case in Modern English, though they were in Old English. The article is never regarded as declined in Modern English, although formally, the words _that_ and possibly _she_ correspond to forms of the predecessor of _the_ (_sē_ m., _þæt_ n., _sēo_ f.) as it was declined in Old English.


Latin

Just as verbs in Latin are conjugated to indicate grammatical information, Latin nouns and adjectives that modify them are declined to signal their roles in sentences. There are five important cases for Latin nouns: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative. Since the vocative case usually takes the same form as the nominative, it is seldom spelt out in grammar books. Yet another case, the locative, is limited to a small number of words.

The usual basic functions of these cases are as follows:

-   Nominative case indicates the subject.
-   Genitive case indicates possession and can be translated with ‘of’.
-   Dative case marks the indirect object and can be translated with ‘to’ or ‘for’.
-   Accusative case marks the direct object.
-   Ablative case is used to modify verbs and can be translated as ‘by’, ‘with’, ‘from’, etc.
-   Vocative case is used to address a person or thing.

The genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative also have important functions to indicate the object of a preposition.

Given below is the declension paradigm of Latin _puer_ ‘boy’ and _puella_ ‘girl’:

  Case         Singular   Plural     Singular   Plural
  ------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- -----------
  Nominative   puer       puerĪ      puellA     puellAE
  Genitive     puerĪ      puerŌRUM   puellAE    puellĀRUM
  Dative       puerŌ      puerĪS     puellAE    puellĪS
  Accusative   puerUM     puerŌS     puellAM    puellĀS
  Ablative     puerŌ      puerĪS     puellĀ     puellĪS

From the provided examples we can see how cases work:

-   _liber puerī_ → the book of the boy (_puerī_ boy=genitive)
-   _puer puellae rosam dat_ → the boy gives the girl a rose (_puer_ boy=nominative; _puellae_ girl=dative; _rosam_ rose=accusative; _dat_ give=third person singular present)


Sanskrit

Sanskrit, another Indo-European language, has eight cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, locative and instrumental.[6] Some do not count vocative as a separate case, despite it having a distinctive ending in the singular, but consider it as a different use of the nominative.[7]

Sanskrit grammatical cases have been analyzed extensively. The grammarian Pāṇini identified six semantic roles or _karaka_, which correspond closely to the eight cases:[8]

-   agent (_kartṛ_, related to the nominative)
-   patient (_karman_, related to the accusative)
-   means (_karaṇa_, related to the instrumental)
-   recipient (_sampradāna_, related to the dative)
-   source (_apādāna_, related to the ablative)
-   locus (_adhikaraṇa_, related to the locative)
-   address (_sambodhana_, related to the vocative)

For example, consider the following sentence:

    {| style="text-align: center;"

| style="padding-right: 1em;" | vṛkṣ-āt | style="padding-right: 1em;" | parṇ-aṁ | style="padding-right: 1em;" | bhūm-au | patati |- |from the tree || a leaf || to the ground || falls |}"a leaf falls from the tree to the ground"

Here _leaf_ is the agent, _tree_ is the source, and _ground_ is the locus. The endings _-aṁ_, _-at_, _-āu_ mark the cases associated with these meanings.
