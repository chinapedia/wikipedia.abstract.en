Dave_Zastudil_2014.JPG This is a season-by-season list of National Football League players who have led the regular season in punting yards.[1]

Record-keeping for punting yards began in 1939, when Parker Hall led the league with 2,369 punting yards, while playing for the Cleveland Rams (now known as the Los Angeles Rams). Hall also became the first player to lead the league in punting yards in consecutive seasons, leading in 1939 and 1940. Since then, Dave Zastudil has set the record for punting yards in a season, when he led the league in 2012, with 5,209 punting yards, while playing with the Arizona Cardinals.[2][3]

John James and Shane Lechler share the record of most seasons leading the league in punting yards, with four each. James led the league in 1974, 1976, 1977, and 1978, while Lechler lead the league in 2003, 2008, 2009, and 2017. James played for the Atlanta Falcons throughout all four of these seasons, whereas Lechler played for the Oakland Raiders in 2003, 2008, and 2009, and then with the Houston Texans in 2017. James is also the only player to have the led the league in three consecutive seasons (1976â€“1978), although many other players have been able to lead the league in two consecutive seasons. Johnny Hekker was the most recent player to accomplish this, leading in 2015, while playing for the St. Louis Rams, and again in 2016, when the team relocated to Los Angeles.
