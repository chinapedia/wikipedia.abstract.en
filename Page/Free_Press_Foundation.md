FREE PRESS FOUNDATION (FPF, ) is one of the largest printing houses in Mongolia. It was first established in 1996 under the name Newspaper Printing House with a grant aid from the Danish International Development Assistance Agency within the framework of the project “Free and Independent Press in Mongolia” implemented in accordance with the agreement between the Government of Mongolia and the Government of Denmark. The Government of Denmark commemorated the Free Press Foundation to the transition to free democratic society system and free open economic market in Mongolia. Between 1996-2005, the Free Press Foundation printed up to 90% of total number of newspaper titles in Mongolia. Presently, it prints over 60% of total number of newspaper titles and over 70% of total circulation of nationally printed newspapers.


History

During a UNDP donor countries’ conference held in Ulaanbaatar in October 1991, Denmark expressed interest in supporting the democratization process in Mongolia. Thus, Mongolia was included into “Support Programme for countries in transition”, financed by the Government of Denmark.[1] DANIDA, the Danish International Development Agency, implemented projects in agriculture, energy, environment protection, education, press and humanitarian sectors of Mongolia. “Free and Independent press of Mongolia” was one of the projects supported by the Government of Denmark. It is one of the longest and successfully implemented projects in Mongolia by DANIDA.[2] The Government of Denmark provided 3 million 725 thousand Danish krone for the construction of independent printing house in Mongolia. The Government of Mongolia invested financing equivalent to 925 thousand DKK.[3]


Status

FPF is a non-government, non-profit and non-membership organization, designed to promote social development. The status of non-profit organization was a logical continuation of the project and its objective. The project implementers have voiced their common opinion that the non-profit status is the best and open model and is the solution for being independent from financial and political interests. That’s why, it needed to register the foundation as a non-government organization to maintain the status of non-profit entity. The best or optimal option was to establish a foundation. According to the Mongolian Law on NGOs, foundations are allowed to conduct economic activities and gain profits from them. Profit is gained from economic activities. However, it doesn’t distribute the profit as a dividend to anybody. It re-invest in the foundation operations and give away as grant aids and donations. There are many foundations in Denmark and Europe with NGO status. The decision to establish NGO has proven to be consistent through the years, and to this day FPF have been operating as NGO adhering to its main line of foundation purpose and objectives.
