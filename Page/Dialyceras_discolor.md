_DIALYCERAS DISCOLOR_ is a tree in the family Sphaerosepalaceae. It is endemic to Madagascar.


Distribution and habitat

_Dialyceras discolor_ is known only from a few locations in the northeastern region of Sava.[1] Its habitat is humid evergreen forests from sea-level to altitude. None of the locations are within protected areas.[2][3]


Threats

_Dialyceras discolor_ is threatened because lemurs, and other animals, disperse the tree's seeds. Threats to these animals would in turn affect the tree's reproduction.[4]
