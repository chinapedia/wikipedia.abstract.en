Plot

In Juban, Tokyo, a middle-school student named Usagi Tsukino befriends Luna, a talking black cat who gives her a magical brooch enabling her to become Sailor Moon: a pretty moon soldier destined to save Earth from the forces of evil. Luna (the black cat) and Usagi assemble a team of fellow Sailor Soldiers to find their princess and the Silver Crystal. They encounter the studious Ami Mizuno, who awakens as Sailor Mercury; Rei Hino, a local shrine maiden who awakens as Sailor Mars; Makoto Kino, a tall transfer student who awakens as Sailor Jupiter; and Minako Aino, a young aspiring idol who awakens as Sailor Venus, accompanied by her talking feline companion Artemis. Additionally, they befriend Mamoru Chiba, a high-school student who assists them on occasion as Tuxedo Mask.

In the first arc, the group battles the Dark Kingdom. Led by Queen Beryl, a team of generals—the —attempt to find the Silver Crystal and free an imprisoned, evil entity called Queen Metaria. Usagi and her team discover that in their previous lives they were members of the ancient Moon Kingdom in a period of time called the Silver Millennium. The Dark Kingdom waged war against them, resulting in the destruction of the Moon Kingdom. Its ruler Queen Serenity later sent her daughter Princess Serenity, her protectors the Sailor Soldiers, their feline advisers Luna and Artemis, and the princess's true love Prince Endymion into the future to be reborn through the power of the Silver Crystal. The team recognizes Usagi as the reincarnated Serenity and Mamoru as Endymion. The Soldiers kill the Four Kings, who turn out to have been Endymion's guardians who defected in their past lives. In a final confrontation with the Dark Kingdom, Minako kills Queen Beryl; she and the other Soldiers then sacrifice their lives in an attempt to destroy Queen Metaria. Using the Silver Crystal, Usagi defeats Metaria and resurrects her friends.

At the beginning of the second arc, Usagi and Mamoru's daughter Chibiusa arrives from the future to find the Silver Crystal. As a result, the Soldiers encounter Wiseman and his Black Moon Clan, who are pursuing her. Chibiusa takes the Soldiers to the future city Crystal Tokyo, where her parents rule as Neo-Queen Serenity and King Endymion. During their journey, they meet Sailor Pluto, guardian of the Time-Space Door. Pluto stops the Clan's ruler Prince Demand from destroying the spacetime continuum, leading to her death. Chibiusa later awakens as a Soldier—Sailor Chibi Moon and helps Usagi kill Wiseman's true form, Death Phantom.

The third arc revolves around a group of lifeforms called the Death Busters, created by Professor Soichi Tomoe, who seek to transport the entity Pharaoh 90 to Earth to merge with the planet. Tomoe's daughter, Hotaru, is possessed by the entity Mistress 9, who must open the dimensional gateway through which Pharaoh 90 must travel. Auto-racer Haruka Tenoh and violinist Michiru Kaioh appear as Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune, who guard the outer rim of the Solar System from external threats. Physics student Setsuna Meioh, Sailor Pluto's reincarnation, joins the protagonists. Usagi obtains the Holy Grail, transforms into Super Sailor Moon, and attempts to use the power of the Grail and the Silver Crystal to destroy Pharaoh 90. This causes Hotaru to awaken as Sailor Saturn, whom Haruka, Michiru, and Setsuna initially perceive as a threat. As the harbinger of death, Hotaru uses her power of destruction to sever Pharaoh 90 from the Earth and instructs Setsuna to use her power over time-space to close the dimensional gateway.

In the fourth arc, Usagi and her friends enter high school and fight against the Dead Moon Circus, led by Queen Nehelenia, the self-proclaimed "rightful ruler" of both Silver Millennium and Earth. Nehelenia invades Elysion, which hosts the Earth's Golden Kingdom, capturing its High Priest Helios and instructing her followers to steal the Silver Crystal. As Prince Endymion, Mamoru is revealed to be the owner of the Golden Crystal, the sacred stone of the Golden Kingdom. Mamoru and the Soldiers combine their powers with those of the Holy Grail, enabling Usagi to transform into Eternal Sailor Moon and kill Nehelenia. Four of Nehelenia's henchmen, the Amazoness Quartet, are revealed to be Sailor Soldiers called the Sailor Quartet, who are destined to become Chibiusa's guardians in the future; they had been awakened prematurely and corrupted by Nehelenia.

In the fifth and final arc, Usagi and her friends are drawn into a battle against Shadow Galactica, a group of false Sailor Soldiers. Their leader, Sailor Galaxia, plans to steal the Sailor Crystals of true Soldiers to take over the galaxy and kill an evil lifeform known as Chaos. When Galaxia kills Mamoru and most of the Sailor Soldiers, she steals their Sailor Crystals. Usagi travels to the Galaxy Cauldron to defeat Galaxia and revive her teammates. Joining Usagi are the Sailor Starlights who come from the planet Kinmoku, their ruler Princess Kakyuu and the infant Sailor Chibichibi, who comes from the distant future. Later, Chibiusa and the Sailor Quartet join Usagi and company. After numerous battles and the death of Galaxia, Sailor Chibichibi reveals her true form as Sailor Cosmos. After defeating Chaos with the Silver Crystal, Usagi revives Mamoru and the Sailor Soldiers, before returning to Earth. The series ends with Usagi and Mamoru's wedding six years later.


Production

Naoko Takeuchi redeveloped _Sailor Moon_ from her 1991 manga serial _Codename: Sailor V_, which was first published on August 20, 1991, and featured Sailor Venus as the main protagonist.[3] Takeuchi wanted to create a story with a theme about girls in outer space. While discussing with her editor Fumio Osano, he suggested the addition of Sailor fuku.[4] When _Codename: Sailor V_ was proposed for adaptation into an anime by Toei Animation, Takeuchi redeveloped the concept so Sailor Venus became a member of a team.[5][6] The resulting manga series became a fusion of the popular magical girl genre and the _Super Sentai_ series, of which Takeuchi was a fan.[7] Recurring motifs include astronomy,[8] astrology, gemology, Greek and Roman mythology,[9] Japanese elemental themes,[10] teen fashions,[11][12] and schoolgirl antics.[13]

Takeuchi said discussions with Kodansha originally envisaged a single story arc;[14] the storyline was developed in meetings a year before serialization began.[15] After completing the arc, Toei and Kodansha asked Takeuchi to continue the series. She wrote four more story arcs,[16] which were often published simultaneously with the five corresponding seasons of the anime adaptation. The anime ran one or two months behind the manga.[17] As a result, the anime follows the storyline of the manga fairly closely, although there are deviations.[18] Takeuchi later said because Toei's production staff were mostly male, she feels the anime has "a slight male perspective."[19]

Takeuchi later said she planned to kill off the protagonists, but Osano rejected the notion and said, "[_Sailor Moon_] is a shōjo manga!" When the anime adaptation was produced, the protagonists were killed in the final battle with the Dark Kingdom, although they were revived. Takeuchi resented that she was unable to do that in her version.[20] Takeuchi also intended for the _Sailor Moon_ anime adaptation to last for one season, but due to the immense popularity, Toei asked Takeuchi to continue the series. At first, she struggled to develop another storyline to extend the series. While discussing with Osano, he suggested the inclusion of Usagi's daughter from the future, Chibiusa.[21]


Media

Manga

Written and illustrated by Naoko Takeuchi, _Sailor Moon_ was serialized in the monthly manga anthology _Nakayoshi_ from December 28, 1991 to February 3, 1997.[22] The side-stories were serialized simultaneously in _RunRun_—another of Kodansha's manga magazines.[23] The 52 individual chapters were published in 18 _tankōbon_ volumes by Kodansha from July 6, 1992, to April 4, 1997.[24][25] In 2003, the chapters were re-released in a collection of 12 _shinzōban_ volumes to coincide with the release of the live-action series.[26] The manga was retitled _Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon_ and included new cover art,[27] and revised dialogue and illustrations. The ten individual short stories were also released in 2 volumes.[28][29] In 2013, the chapters were once again re-released in 10 _kanzenban_ volumes to commemorate the manga's 20th anniversary, which includes digitally remastered artwork, new covers and color artwork from its _Nakayoshi_ run.[30] The books have been enlarged from the typical Japanese manga size to A5.[31][32] The short stories were republished in two volumes, with the order of the stories shuffled. _Codename: Sailor V_ was also included in the third edition.[33]

The _Sailor Moon_ manga was initially licensed for an English release by Mixx (later Tokyopop) in North America. The manga was first published as a serial in _MixxZine_ beginning in 1997, but was later removed from the magazine and made into a separate, monthly comic to finish the first, second and third arcs. At the same time, the fourth and fifth arcs were printed in a secondary magazine called _Smile_.[34] The series was later collected into three-part graphic novels spanning eighteen volumes, which were published from December 1, 1998, to September 18, 2001.[35][36] Tokyopop's license expired in 2005 and its edition went out of print.[37] Daily pages from the Tokyopop version ran in the Japanimation Station, a service accessible to users of America Online.[38] In May 2005, Tokyopop's license to the Sailor Moon manga expired, and its edition went out of print.[39]

In 2011, Kodansha Comics announced it would publish the _Sailor Moon_ manga and the lead-in series _Codename: Sailor V_ in English.[40] It would also re-publish the twelve volumes of _Sailor Moon_ simultaneously with the two-volume edition of _Codename Sailor V_, from September 2011 to July 2013.[41][42][43] The first volume of the two related short stories was published on September 10, 2013;[44] the other was published on November 26.[45] On July 1, 2019, Kondasha Comics released the Eternal editions digitally,[46] following the announcement the day before about the series being released digitally in ten different languages.[47]

The manga has also been licensed in other English-speaking countries. In the United Kingdom, the volumes are distributed by Turnaround Publisher Services.[48] In Australia, the manga is distributed by Penguin Books Australia.[49]

The manga has been licensed in Russia and CIS for distribution by XL-Media publishing company, a subdivision of Eksmo publishing company. The date of release is unknown.[50]

Anime series

_Sailor Moon_

Toei Animation produced an anime television series based on the 52 manga chapters, also titled _Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon_.[51][52] It was directed by Junichi Sato, Kunihiko Ikuhara and Takuya Igarashi.[53] The series premiered in Japan on TV Asahi on March 7, 1992, and ran for 200 episodes until its conclusion on February 8, 1997. Most of the international versions, including the English adaptations, are titled _Sailor Moon_.

_Sailor Moon Crystal_

On July 6, 2012, Kodansha and Toei Animation announced that it would commence production of a new anime adaptation of _Sailor Moon_, called _Sailor Moon Crystal_, for a simultaneous worldwide release in 2013 as part of the series' 20th anniversary celebrations.[54][55][56][57] _Crystal_ premiered on July 5, 2014, and episodes would premiere on the first and third Saturdays of each month.[58] Kotono Mitsuishi reprised her role as Sailor Moon.[59] The first two seasons were released together, covering their corresponding arcs of the manga ("Dark Kingdom" and "Black Moon"). A third season (subtitled "Death Busters" based on the "Infinity" arc on the manga) premiered on April 4, 2016.[60] On January 25, 2017, another sequel was announced.[61]

Films and television specials

Three animated theatrical feature films based on the original _Sailor Moon_ series have been released in Japan. The films are side-stories that do not correlate with the timeline of the original series. A one-hour television special was aired on TV Asahi in Japan on April 8, 1995.[62] In 1997, an article in _Variety_ stated that The Walt Disney Company was interested in acquiring the rights to _Sailor Moon_ as a live action film to be directed by Stanley Tong.[63]

Companion books

There have been numerous companion books to _Sailor Moon_. Kodansha released some of these books for each of the five story arcs, collectively called the _Original Picture Collection_. The books contain cover art, promotional material and other work by Takeuchi. Many of the drawings are accompanied by comments on the way she developed her ideas, created each picture and commentary on the anime interpretation of her story.[64][65][66][67][68] Another picture collection, _Volume Infinity_, was released as a self-published, limited-edition artbook after the end of the series in 1997. This art book includes drawings by Takeuchi and her friends, her staff, and many of the voice actors who worked on the anime. In 1999, Kodansha published the _Materials Collection_; this contained development sketches and notes for nearly every character in the manga, and for some characters that never appeared. Each drawing includes notes by Takeuchi about costume pieces, the mentality of the characters and her feelings about them. It also includes timelines for the story arcs and for the real-life release of products and materials relating to the anime and manga. A short story, _Parallel Sailor Moon_ is also featured, celebrating the year of the rabbit.[69]

Novels

Sailor Moon was also adapted for publication as novels and released in 1998. The first book was written by Stuart J. Levy and the following written by Lianne Sentar.[70]

Stage musicals

In mid-1993, the first musical theater production based on _Sailor Moon_ premiered; Anza Ohyama starred as Sailor Moon. Thirty such musicals in all have been produced, with one in pre-production. The shows' stories include anime-inspired plotlines and original material. Music from the series has been released on about 20 memorial albums.[71] The popularity of the musicals has been cited as a reason behind the production of the live-action television series, _Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon_.[72]

During the original run musicals ran in the winter and summer of each year, with summer musicals staged at the Sunshine Theater in the Ikebukuro area of Tokyo. In the winter, musicals toured to other large cities in Japan, including Osaka, Fukuoka,[73] Nagoya, Shizuoka, Kanazawa, Sendai,[74] Saga, Oita, Yamagata and Fukushima.[75] The final incarnation of the first run, , went on stage in January 2005, following which, Bandai officially put the series on a hiatus.[76] On June 2, 2013, Fumio Osano announced on his Twitter page that the _Sailor Moon_ musicals would begin again in September 2013.[77] The 20th anniversary show _La Reconquista_ ran from September 13 to 23 at Shibuya's AiiA Theater Tokyo, with Satomi Ōkubo as Sailor Moon. Satomi Ōkubo reprised the role in the 2014 production _Petite Étrangère_ which ran from August 21 to September 7, 2014, again at AiiA Theater Tokyo.

Live-action series

Unmade American remake

In 1993, Renaissance-Atlantic Entertainment, Bandai and Toon Makers, Inc. conceptualized their own version of _Sailor Moon_, which was half live-action and half Western-style animation. Toon Makers produced a 17-minute proof of concept presentation video as well as a two-minute music video, both of which were directed by Rocky Sotoloff, for this concept. Renaissance-Atlantic presented the concept to Toei, but it was turned down as their concept would have cost significantly more than simply exporting and dubbing the anime adaptation.[78]

At the 1998 Anime Expo convention in Los Angeles, the music video was shown. It has since been copied numerous times and has been viewed on many streaming video sites. Because of the relatively poor quality of the source video and circulated footage, many anime fans thought that the music video was actually a leaked trailer for the project. Additional copies of the footage have since been uploaded to the Internet and served only to bolster the mistaken assumption, in addition to incorrectly citing the production to Saban Entertainment, who became known for a similar treatment that created the _Power Rangers_ series.[79]

In 1998, Frank Ward, along with his company Renaissance-Atlantic Entertainment, tried to revive the idea of doing a live-action series based on Sailor Moon, this time called _Team Angel_, without the involvement of Toon Makers. A 2-minute reel was produced and sent to Bandai America, but was also rejected.[80]

_Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon_

In 2003, Toei Company produced a Japanese live-action _Sailor Moon_ television series using the new translated English title of _Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon_. Its 49 episodes were broadcast on Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting from October 4, 2003 to September 25, 2004.[81][82] _Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon_ featured Miyuu Sawai as Usagi Tsukino, Rika Izumi (credited as Chisaki Hama) as Ami Mizuno, Keiko Kitagawa as Rei Hino, Mew Azama as Makoto Kino, Ayaka Komatsu as Minako Aino, Jouji Shibue as Mamoru Chiba, Keiko Han reprising her voice role as Luna from the original anime and Kappei Yamaguchi voicing Artemis. The series was an alternate retelling of the Dark Kingdom arc, adding a storyline different from that in the manga and first anime series, with original characters and new plot developments.[83][84] In addition to the main episodes, two direct-to-video releases appeared after the show ended its television broadcast. "Special Act" is set four years after the main storyline ends, and shows the wedding of the two main characters. "Act Zero" is a prequel showing the origins of Sailor V and Tuxedo Mask.[85]

Video games

The _Sailor Moon_ franchise has spawned several video games across various genres and platforms. Most were made by Bandai and its subsidy Angel; others were produced by Banpresto. The early games were side-scrolling fighters; later ones were unique puzzle games, or versus fighting games. _Another Story_ was a turn-based role-playing video game.[86] The only _Sailor Moon_ game produced outside Japan, 3VR New Media's _The 3D Adventures of Sailor Moon_, went on sale in North America in 1997.[87] A video game called _Sailor Moon: La Luna Splende_ (_Sailor Moon: The Shining Moon_) was released on March 16, 2011 for the Nintendo DS.[88]

Tabletop games

The Dyskami Publishing Company released _Sailor Moon Crystal Dice Challenge_, created by James Ernest of Cheapass Games and based on the _Button Men_ tabletop game in 2017, and _Sailor Moon Crystal Truth or Bluff_ in 2018.[89][90][91]

Theme park attractions

A Sailor Moon attraction, "Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon: The Miracle 4-D", exists at Universal Studios Japan.[92]


Reception

_Sailor Moon_ is one of the most popular manga series of all time and continues to enjoy high readership worldwide. More than one million copies of its _tankōbon_ volumes had been sold in Japan by the end of 1995.[93] By the series' 20th anniversary in 2012, the manga had sold over 35 million copies in over fifty countries,[94] and the franchise has generated in worldwide merchandise sales as of 2014.[95] The manga won the Kodansha Manga Award in 1993 for _shōjo_.[96] The English adaptations of both the manga and the anime series became the first successful shōjo title in the United States.[97] The character of Sailor Moon is recognized as one of the most important and popular female superheroes of all time.[98][99][100][101]

_Sailor Moon_ has also become popular internationally. _Sailor Moon_ was broadcast in Spain and France beginning in December 1993; these became the first countries outside Japan to broadcast the series.[102] It was later aired in Russia, South Korea, the Philippines, China, Italy, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong, before North America picked up the franchise for adaptation. In the Philippines, _Sailor Moon_ was one of its carrier network's main draws, helping it to become the third-biggest network in the country.[103] In 2001, the _Sailor Moon_ manga was Tokyopop's best selling property, outselling the next-best selling titles by at least a factor of 1.5.[104] In Diamond Comic Distributors's May 1999 "Graphic Novel and Trade Paperback" category, _Sailor Moon_ Volume 3 was the best-selling comic book in the United States.[105]

In his 2007 book _Manga: The Complete Guide_, Jason Thompson gave the manga series three stars out of four. He enjoyed the blending of _shōnen_ and _shōjo_ styles and said the combat scenes seemed heavily influenced by _Saint Seiya_, but shorter and less bloody. He also said the manga itself appeared similar to _Super Sentai_ television shows. Thompson found the series fun and entertaining, but said the repetitive plot lines were a detriment to the title, which the increasing quality of art could not make up for; even so, he called the series "sweet, effective entertainment."[106] Thompson said although the audience for _Sailor Moon_ is both male and female, Takeuchi does not use excessive fanservice for males, which would run the risk of alienating her female audience. Thompson said fight scenes are not physical and "boil down to their purest form of a clash of wills", which he says "makes thematic sense" for the manga.[107]

Comparing the manga and anime, Sylvain Durand said the manga artwork is "gorgeous", but its storytelling is more compressed and erratic and the anime has more character development. Durand said "the sense of tragedy is greater" in the manga's telling of the "fall of the Silver Millennium," giving more detail about the origins of the Shitennou and on Usagi's final battle with Beryl and Metaria. Durand said the anime omits information that makes the story easy to understand, but judges the anime more "coherent" with a better balance of comedy and tragedy, whereas the manga is "more tragic" and focused on Usagi and Mamoru's romance.[108]

For the week of September 11, 2011, to September 17, 2011, the first volume of the re-released _Sailor Moon_ manga was the best-selling manga on _The New York Times_ Manga Best Sellers list, with the first volume of _Codename: Sailor V_ in second place.[109][110] The first print run of the first volume sold out after four weeks.[111]


Legacy

With their dynamic heroines and action-oriented plots, many attribute the manga and anime series to reinvigorating the magical girl genre. After its success, many similar magical girl series, including _Magic Knight Rayearth_, _Wedding Peach_, _Nurse Angel Ririka SOS_, _Saint Tail_, and _Pretty Cure_, emerged.[112][113] _Sailor Moon_ has been called "the biggest breakthrough" in English-dubbed anime until 1995, when it premiered on YTV,[114] and "the pinnacle of little kid _shōjo_ anime."[115] Cultural anthropologist Matt Thorn said that soon after _Sailor Moon_, _shōjo_ manga started appearing in book shops instead of fandom-dominated comic shops.[116] The series are credited as beginning a wider movement of girls taking up _shōjo_ manga.[117][118] Canadian librarian Gilles Poitras defines a generation of anime fans as those who were introduced to anime by _Sailor Moon_ in the 1990s, saying they were both much younger than other fans and were also mostly female.[119]

Historian Fred Patten credits Takeuchi with popularizing the concept of a _Super Sentai_-like team of magical girls,[120][121] and Paul Gravett credits the series with revitalizing the magical girl genre itself.[122] A reviewer for _THEM Anime Reviews_ also credited the anime series with changing the genre—its heroine must use her powers to fight evil, not simply have fun as previous magical girls had done.[123] The series has also been compared to _Mighty Morphin Power Rangers_,[124][125] _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_,[126][127][128] and _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_.[129] Sailor Moon also influenced the development of _Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir_, _W.I.T.C.H._, _Winx Club_, _LoliRock_, _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_, and _Totally Spies!_.[130]

In western culture, _Sailor Moon_ is sometimes associated with the feminist and Girl Power movements and with empowering its viewers,[131] especially regarding the "credible, charismatic and independent" characterizations of the Sailor Soldiers, which were "interpreted in France as an unambiguously feminist position".[132] Although _Sailor Moon_ is regarded as empowering to women and feminism in concept, through the aggressive nature and strong personalities of the Sailor Soldiers,[133] it is a specific type of feminist concept where "traditional feminine ideals [are] incorporated into characters that act in traditionally male capacities".[134] While the Sailor Soldiers are strong, independent fighters who thwart evil—which is generally a masculine stereotype—they are also ideally feminized in the transformation of the Sailor Soldiers from teenage girls into magical girls, with heavy emphasis on jewelry, make-up and their highly sexualized outfits with cleavage, short skirts, and accentuated waists.[135]

The most notable hyper-feminine features of the Sailor Soldiers—and most other females in Japanese girls' comics—are the girls' thin bodies, long legs, and, in particular, round, orb-like eyes.[136] Eyes are commonly known as the primal source within characters where emotion is evoked—sensitive characters have larger eyes than insensitive ones.[137] Male characters generally have smaller eyes that have no sparkle or shine in them like the eyes of the female characters.[138] The stereotypical role of women in Japanese culture is to undertake romantic and loving feelings;[139] therefore, the prevalence of hyper-feminine qualities like the openness of the female eye in Japanese girls' comics is clearly exhibited in _Sailor Moon_. Thus, _Sailor Moon_ emphasizes a type of feminist model by combining traditional masculine action with traditional female affection and sexuality through the Sailor Soldiers.[140] Its characters are often described with "catty stereotypes", Sailor Moon's character, in particular, being singled out as less than feminist.[141]

In English-speaking countries, _Sailor Moon_ developed a cult following among anime fans and male university students.[142] Patrick Drazen says the Internet was a new medium that fans used to communicate and played a role in the popularity of _Sailor Moon_.[143] Fans could use the Internet to communicate about the series, organize campaigns to return _Sailor Moon_ to U.S. broadcast, to share information about episodes that had not yet aired, or to write fan fiction.[144][145] In 2004, one study said there were 3,335,000 websites about Sailor Moon, compared to 491,000 for Mickey Mouse.[146] Gemma Cox of _Neo_ magazine said part of the series' allure was that fans communicated via the Internet about the differences between the dub and the original version.[147] The _Sailor Moon_ fandom was described in 1997 as being "small and dispersed."[148] In a United States study, twelve children paid rapt attention to the fighting scenes in _Sailor Moon_, although when asked whether they thought _Sailor Moon_ was violent, only two said yes and the other ten described the episodes as "soft" or "cute."[149]
