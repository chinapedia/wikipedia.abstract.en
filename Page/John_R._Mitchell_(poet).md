JOHN R. MITCHELL (1940 â€“ August 17, 2006)[1] was a poet and a professor of English at Augsburg College in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He taught at the college for 36 years, dying at age 66. His work was featured in anthologies, such as _25 Minnesota Writers_ (Nodin Press, 1980), alongside the work of Jon Hassler, Patricia Hampl, and Carol Bly.[2]

Born in Decatur, Alabama, Mitchell received a bachelor's degree from Maryville College in Maryville, Tennessee, and earned his master's degree in English from the University of Tennessee.

He served in the Peace Corps in Liberia.[3] He drew on that experience in his short story, "The Volunteer". [4] His poems were often published in the _North Stone Review_.[5]

A literary prize is awarded in his name annually by Augsburg College, the John R. Mitchell Academy of American Poets Prize.[6]
