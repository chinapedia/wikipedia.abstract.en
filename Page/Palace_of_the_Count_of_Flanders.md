History

The elegant neoclassical residence was built in the late 18th century as the town house of Marquis Paul Arconati-Visconti, the then Mayor of Brussels.[1]

The Count of Flanders bought the residence in 1866, one year before his marriage. He had the palace renovated by his architect Gustave Saintenoy.[2] It features a small inner garden, which leads to the Entry of Honour. Saintenoy also designed the great ball room, but unfortunately this fine room was destroyed in 1921. Following the completion of the renovations, the new Count and Countess made it their family home.[3] King Albert I was born there, and his brother Prince Baudouin died there.

After the death of the Count, his children sold the residence to the Banque de Bruxelles. Inside, the major rooms with fine interiors are kept in the state they were as a royal residence.[4] The palace became a listed monument on 6 September 2001.[5] Cours_des_Comptes_-_panoramio.jpg
