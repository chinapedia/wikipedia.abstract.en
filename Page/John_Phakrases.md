JOHN PHAKRASES (, ) was a Byzantine nobleman and courtier.

Little is known about his life. His unnamed father was _logothetes ton agelon_, and he was possibly the grandson of a namesake 13th-century official who was a friend and correspondent of Patriarch Gregory II of Constantinople. Of his career, it is only known that Phakrases served as _parakoimomenos_ under Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282â€“1328). Maximos Planoudes intended to teach him, and a manuscript names him as the author of a list of offices in verse. Phakrases was married and had children. Their names are unknown, as is that of his wife, on whose death Manuel Gabalas composed a funeral elegy.
