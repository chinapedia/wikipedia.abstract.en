CLIFTONVILLE CURVE is a short railway that links the West Coastway Line to the Brighton Main Line between Hove and Preston Park.[1] It was opened in July 1879.[2][3] The curve includes a tunnel.[4]

The line, which is also known as the Cliftonville Spur,[5] was named in reference to Cliftonville station (now called ) which had opened in 1865.[6] Cliftonville was an area of Hove which was developed speculatively as a "fashionable neighbourhood" in the mid-19th century.[7] Construction of the curve allowed trains to travel between the Brighton Main Line and the West Coastway Line without having to reverse at ,[8] reducing congestion there and shortening journeys.[9]
