History

The name Kafu originates from football star CAFU and BANTON comes from one of the greatest exponents of reggae, _Buju Banton_. This combined forms his stage name Kafu Banton.

During his studies at a school in Ciudad de Col贸n he met a relative of one of the best Panamanian reggae artists, Ernesto Brown (known as Apache Ness), who introduced him to the reggae scene. He then made himself known by participating in different reggae contests and competitions at the national level. In mid-October 1996 he won first place on a contest held in a local nightclub, providing the opportunity to record his first single, _Madman_, under the Spanish Oil production, headed by Rodney " El Chombo" Clark.

Soon he participated in other productions like "Stories of the Crypt 2", and "Stories of the Crypt 3", produced by Oilers Music. These productions caught the greater attention of the public. During this period, in which reggae music was experiencing one of its best moments, Kafu Banton, along with other recognized artists like Apache Ness y Los Sensacionales, Calito Soul, Papachan, Original Dan, and Bigaman created the group "One Love, One Blood".

In 1998 Kafu decided to leave the label Oilers Music, and began to work with producer Pucho Bustamante, under the label Proarsain. Under this new label, Kafu participated in several successful productions like: Creation, Los Dementes, Da'Crew and Sin Censura.
