Production

Filming began June 17, 2016 in Cheongju, South Korea and finished on December 20, 2016. The film reunites Hwang Jung-min with Ryoo Seung-wan, who directed the 2015 hit movie _Veteran_ starring Hwang.[7] Production cost about five times more than the average locally produced film due to the massive lifelike sets.[8] While the island provided the inspiration for the plot, _The Battleship Island_ was not filmed on location. The sets were built in Chuncheon and were designed to resemble the conditions of Hashima Island's community and mines during the 1940s.[9]


Historical accuracy

Right wing Japanese media, such as the daily _Sankei Shimbun_ newspaper, have attacked the film accusing it of distorting historic truth.[10] In response, director Ryoo Seung-wan has asserted that the film has "non-fiction" elements that show "how war can make man a monster", it is not intended to convey anti-Japanese sentiment.[11] However, Japan has acknowledged that Korean and Chinese forced laborers were there during World War II when it applied to UNESCO for World Heritage status for Hashima Island.[12] South Korea had opposed the bid until Japan acknowledged that "large number[s] of Koreans and others [...] were brought against their will and forced to work under harsh conditions in the 1940s at some of the sites [including Hashima island]"[13][14] But after Hashima was given WHS status, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida clarified comments made during the submission process, specifically that "[forced to work under harsh conditions] by the Japanese government representative did not mean forced labor".[15][16] Although UNESCO's World Heritage Committee required that a monitoring mechanism be established to measure the degree to which the victims of Hashima are remembered,[17] the island's official tourism website and tour program - operated by Nagasaki City - does not currently acknowledge this requirement.[18]


Release

_The Battleship Island_ was first promoted at the European Film Market in February 2017 and then at the Cannes Film Festival in May. As of June 2017, it has been sold to 113 countries, including North American countries as well as France, Italy, Russia, Turkey, Malaysia, Taiwan, Indonesia, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand.[19][20] On June 16, 2017, an official press conference was held at the National Museum of Korea to launch the film.[21]

The film has been invited to compete at 2017 Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival of Catalonia in Spain. The film will be shown in the Orbita section for introducing most notable films of the year and honouring a title chosen by the jury composed of audiences. This is the sixth film by director Ryoo Seung-wan to be selected for a screening at this film festival.[22]

Special screenings

On July 28, a special screen was held for UNESCO officials and diplomats in Paris at the headquarters of Metropolitan Filmexport. The aim was to raise awareness of the hidden history of the Hashima Island and how the Koreans were forced into harsh labour at an underground coal mining factory on the island during Japanâ€™s rule of Korea.[23]

On July 25, a special pre-screen was held for foreign diplomats in South Korea.[24][25]

_The New York Times_ noted that the film "vividly conveys the pain of a national wartime trauma whose scars clearly have not healed."[28] Although some aspects of the violence and overly-theatrical storylines were criticized, critics have praised the camera work and Ryoo for his effective use of a large-scale action set.[29][30]
