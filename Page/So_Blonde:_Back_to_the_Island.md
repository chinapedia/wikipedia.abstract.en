_SO BLONDE: BACK TO THE ISLAND_ is a point-and-click adventure game released for the Wii and Nintendo DS in 2010. It is not a sequel or spin-off, but a darker "what if?"[1] scenario based on the 2008 PC game _So Blonde_, which also precedes _Captain Morgane and the Golden Turtle_, which was released in 2012.


Gameplay


Plot

Sunny Blonde is a 17-year-old who has been spoiled by her rich parents. On a cruise with her parents who are celebrating their wedding anniversary, the ship is struck by lightning, and she is knocked overboard.[2]

She finds herself stranded on a beach of a remote “Forgotten Island” in the Caribbean Sea.[3] The dark side of the island, that is, where the pirates under command of Captain One-Eye have their hideout.


Development

_So Blonde: Back to the Island_ was announced to be in development on August 23, 2008, a few months after the release of _So Blonde_. The game was explained to be a "What If..." scenario to find a balance between making _So Blonde_ available to consoles while keeping it interesting for old fans at the same time.[4] Because it follows the original story in broad strokes, _So Blonde: Back to the Island_ reuses models, backgrounds, and art from the original game where applicable.[5]

Voice recording was arranged by MAS Productions and took place in a two-week time span around October 2, 2009.[6] The trailer of the game debuted at Gamescom in 2010.[7]
