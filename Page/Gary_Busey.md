Early life

Busey was born in Goose Creek, Texas, the son of Sadie Virginia (née Arnett), a homemaker, and Delmer Lloyd Busey, a construction design manager.[2] While he was in fourth grade, Busey moved from Goose Creek to Tulsa, where he later attended Bell Junior High School, then attended and graduated from Nathan Hale High School.[3] Busey attended Coffeyville Community college [4] before attending Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg, Kansas on a football scholarship, where he became interested in acting.[5] He then transferred to Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma where he quit school just one class short of graduation.


Career

Early career

and Jack Elam from _The Texas Wheelers_, 1974]] Busey began his show business career as a drummer in The Rubber Band.[6] He appears on several Leon Russell recordings, credited as playing drums under the names "Teddy Jack Eddy"[7] and "Sprunk", a character he created when he was a cast member of a local television comedy show in Tulsa, Oklahoma, called _The Uncanny Film Festival and Camp Meeting_[8] on station KTUL (which starred fellow Tulsan Gailard Sartain as "Dr. Mazeppa Pompazoidi"). For his skits on Uncanny Film Festival, Busey drew on his American Hero, belligerent, know-it-all character. When he told Gailard Sartain his character needed a name, Sartain replied, "Take three: Teddy, Jack and Eddy."[9]

He played in a band called Carp, which released one album on Epic Records in 1969.[10] Busey continued to play several small roles in both film and television during the 1970s. In 1975, as the character "Harvey Daley," he was the last person killed on the series _Gunsmoke_ (in the third-to-last episode, No. 633 – "The Busters").[11]

Rise to prominence

'' in 1976]] In 1974, Busey made his major film debut with a supporting role in Michael Cimino's buddy action caper _Thunderbolt and Lightfoot_, starring Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges.

In 1976, he was hired by Barbra Streisand and her producer-boyfriend Jon Peters to play Bobby Ritchie, road manager to Kris Kristofferson's character in the remake film _A Star is Born_. On the DVD commentary of the film, Streisand says Busey was great and that she had seen him on a TV series and thought he had the right qualities to play the role.

In 1978, he starred as rock legend Buddy Holly in _The Buddy Holly Story_ with Sartain as The Big Bopper. For his performance, Busey received the greatest critical acclaim of his career and the movie earned Busey an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and the National Society of Film Critics' Best Actor award. In the same year he also starred in the small yet acclaimed drama _Straight Time_ and the surfing movie _Big Wednesday_, which is now a minor cult classic.

In the 1980s, Busey's roles included the critically acclaimed western _Barbarosa_, the comedies _D.C. Cab_[12] and _Insignificance_, and the Stephen King adaptation _Silver Bullet_. He played one of the primary antagonists opposite Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the action comedy _Lethal Weapon_.

In the 1990s, he had prominent supporting roles in successful action films such as _Predator 2_, _Point Break_ and _Under Siege_. He also appeared in _Rookie of the Year_, _The Firm_, _Black Sheep_, _Lost Highway_, and _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_.

Busey sang the song "Stay All Night" on _Saturday Night Live_ in March 1979 (season 4, episode 14), and on the _Late Show with David Letterman_ in the 1990s.[13]

2000s–present

In 2002, Busey voiced the character Phil Cassidy in the video game _Grand Theft Auto: Vice City_ and later reprises the role in the prequel _Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories_ in 2006. He received much praise from critics and fans for his portrayal of the outlandish character. In 2003, Busey starred in a Comedy Central reality show, _I'm with Busey_. In 2005, he also voiced himself in an episode of _The Simpsons_[14] and appeared in the popular miniseries _Into the West_. Busey controversially appeared in the 2006 Turkish nationalist film _Valley of the Wolves: Iraq,_ (Kurtlar Vadisi: Irak, in Turkish), which was accused of fascism, anti-Americanism[15] and anti-Semitism.[16]

In 2007, he appeared as himself in a prominent recurring role on HBO's _Entourage_, in which he parodied his eccentric image, ultimately appearing on three episodes of the show.

In 2008, he joined the second season of the reality show _Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew_.[17] Busey returned to reality television in _Celebrity Apprentice 4_, which premiered in March 2011,[18] and appeared again in _Celebrity Apprentice 6_. There, he briefly reprised his role as Buddy Holly by performing "Not Fade Away".

In a series of 2010 YouTube advertisements for Vitamin Water, Busey appeared as Norman Tugwater, a lawyer who defends professional athletes' entitlements to a cut from Fantasy Football team owners.[19]

In 2014, he became a celebrity spokesperson for Amazon Fire TV. That August, he appeared in, and became the first American winner of the fourteenth series of the UK version of _Celebrity Big Brother_.

On September 1, 2015, it was announced that he would be competing on the 21st season of _Dancing with the Stars_. He was paired with professional dancer Anna Trebunskaya.[20] Busey and Trebunskaya made it to Week 4 of competition but were then eliminated and finished in 10th place.[21]


Personal life

In 1971, Busey's wife Judy Helkenberg gave birth to their son, William Jacob "Jake" Busey. Busey and Helkenberg divorced when Jake was 19 years old. Busey has a daughter named Alectra from a previous relationship.[22]

On December 4, 1988, Busey was severely injured in a motorcycle accident in which he was not wearing a helmet. His skull was fractured, and doctors feared he suffered permanent brain damage.[23]

In 1996, Busey publicly announced that he was a Christian, saying: "I am proud to tell Hollywood I am a Christian. For the first time I am now free to be myself."[24][25] Busey cites the motorcycle accident, as well as a 1995 cocaine overdose,[26] as events that strengthened his religious faith.

In 1997, Busey underwent successful surgery to remove a cancerous, plum-sized tumor from his sinus cavity. The growth was found after Busey began suffering nose bleeds.[27]

During the filming of the second season of _Celebrity Rehab_ in 2008, Busey was referred to psychiatrist Dr. Charles Sophy. Sophy suspected that Busey's brain injury has had a greater effect on him than realized. He described it as essentially weakening his mental "filters" and causing him to speak and act impulsively. Sophy recommended Busey take valproic acid (Depakote), with which Busey agreed.[28]

In February 2010, Busey's fiancée Steffanie Sampson gave birth to their son, Luke Sampson Busey.[29]

In 2015, Busey supported Donald Trump's 2016 presidential bid saying, "For the American people, vote for Donald Trump come election night."[30][31] In late 2015, he again expressed support for Trump's candidacy for president.[32]
