WILDLING is an indie rock band from Los Angeles, California signed to Warner Bros. Records. The band was formed in 2014 by members Ryan Levine and Andrew Ampaya, who were originally signed to RCA Records as the band _Test Your Reflex_ from 2004-2009, and also recorded music under the name _No Country_ as well as _Low Shoulder_ (2009-2014).


History

WILDLING is the current name for the musical collaboration involving key members Ryan Levine and Andrew Ampaya. They have been recording music and touring under different band names since 2004.

_Test Your Reflex_ (2004-2009)

The original group was composed of five musicians (Ryan Levine, Andrew Ampaya, Sal Cortez, Ryan Clark, and Augustin Sanchez) of various backgrounds all between the ages of 19-21 at the time. As _Test Your Reflex_, they started out in the rehearsal rooms of a teen center in Thousand Oaks, California. They came together in early 2004.

Having played in various electronic and rock bands since grammar school, lead singer Levine decided he wanted to try something new. Inspired by classic albums like U2's _The Joshua Tree_, Peter Gabriel's _So_ and Joni Mitchell's _Blue_,[1] after experimenting in his garage, Levine gradually developed the sound that would become _Test Your Reflex_.

It started when Levine met drummer Sal Cortez through an ex-girlfriend. The two then began searching for others to join them. After many months they finally found guitarist RC (a.k.a. Ryan Clark), a former guitarist of Los Angeles punk band R.O.H. Then came keyboardist Andrew Ampaya, a classically trained pianist with similar musical influences. With innovative and like-minded bassist Agustin Sanchez joining shortly thereafter, the first and final line up of _Test Your Reflex_ was created.[2]

The band's debut release was _The Burning Hour_ (released April 24, 2007) on RCA Records. The album has been described as having an 80s sound [3] with hints of U2, The Cars, and Simple Minds[4] as well as The Cure[5][6][7] and The Killers.[8]

The band featured on the MySpace Tribute to the Smashing Pumpkins album released on MySpace Records and distributed in the July 2007 issue of SPIN Magazine.[9] They liken themselves to other bands on the Pumpkins tribute, such as The Bravery.[10] All tracks appeared on each band's MySpace page from May 14, 2007. _Test Your Reflex_ opened for The Smashing Pumpkins on July 22, 2007 at The Fillmore in San Francisco. Before that, from March 22, 2007 to May 12, 2007, _Test Your Reflex_ toured the US with the Detroit-based band Electric Six.

Television performances include two appearances with Carson Daly. On June 22, 2007 the band appeared on Last Call with Carson Daly and the following month performed on the Carson Daly show (aired July 12, 2007[11]).

The complete list of media coverage/online releases for _Test Your Reflex_ was as follows:

Their song "Thinking of You" was featured as the background music of a radio commercial for Michelob Golden Light beer, heard in the Twin Cities and other markets in the midwest where the beer is sold.

_No Country_ and _Low Shoulder_ (2009-2014)

With the conclusion of their contract with RCA Records, in 2009, the group changed its name to NO COUNTRY. Also in 2009, two members of the band (Ryan Levine and Sal Cortez) appeared as members of the fictional band _Low Shoulder_ in the 2009 film _Jennifer's Body_. The band performed the songs "Through the Trees" (written by Ryan Levine and Andrew Ampaya) and "One More Night" (written by Ryan Levine) as well as Blondie's "In the Flesh" in the film. The film's soundtrack includes the song "Through the Trees" by _Low Shoulder_.

_Wildling_ (2014-present)

In November 2014, Ryan Levine and Andrew Ampaya formed a new five-member band with the name "Wildling", made up of new members: songwriter and producer Erik Janson on guitar, previous member of indie California beach band Cayucas Casey Wojtalewicz on drums, and Ryan's younger brother Justin Levine on bass.

Wildling performed their first show at The Satellite in Los Angeles. They were immediately invited to headline The Satellite's residency in January 2015, and the next week, they were invited to support Young the Giant, who had attended the show. A few months later they performed in Austin for SXSW, and by summer 2015, they were recording their debut EP. The band has worked with different producers on different songs, including Doug Boehm (French Kicks, Dr. Dog), Caleb Shreve (Phantogram, Bear Hands), Ted Gowans (Tegan & Sara), and Ben Greenspan (Fences).

Ryan sent lead single "Hummingbird," directly to DJ Kat Corbett of KROQ, who added it to the regular rotation on her show, "Locals Only." The debut EP was released in October 2015.

Wildling is signed to Warner Bros. Records.
