History

The company was started in a garage in Gaiwadi, Girgaum - Mumbai by four friends Champaklal Choksey, Chimanlal Choksi, Suryakant Dani and Arvind Vakil in February 1945. During World War II and the Quit India Movement of 1942, a temporary ban on paint imports left only foreign companies and Shalimar Paints in the market. Asian Paints took up the market and reported annual turn over of 23 crore in 1952 but with only 2% PBT margin. By 1967 it became the leading paints manufacturer in the country.[7][8]

The four families together held the majority shares of the company. But disputes started over the global rights in 1990s when the company expanded beyond India. The disputes resulted in Choksey selling their 13.7% shares and exiting in 1997. Champaklal died in July 1997 and his son Atul took over. After failed collaboration talks with the British company Imperial Chemical Industries, Choksey's shares were mutually bought by the remainder three family and Unit Trust of India. , the Choksi, Dani and Vakil families hold a share of 47.81%.[9]


Marketing and advertising

In 1950s the company launched a "washable distemper", which was a balance between the cheap dry distemper that peeled easily and the more expensive plastic emulsions. Promoting their brand Tractor Distemper, the company used "Don't lose your temper, use Tractor Distemper" in their advertisings.[10] In 1954, "Gattu" – a mischievous boy with a paint bucket in his hand – was launched as mascot. Created by R. K. Laxman, the mascot found appeal with the middle-classes.[11]

He was used only in print advertisements and packaging till 1970s and by 1990s was also seen on television advertisements. Gattu helped in bringing the commodity-led business of painters to the actual end users of home-owners.[12] Ogilvy & Mather, the advertising agency associated with Asian Paints, launched marketing strategy by focusing on festive occasions in 1980s with their tag line "Har Ghar Kucch Kehta Hai" (Every home says something). Relating with festivals and important life events like marriages and child birth, the company advertised it as an occasion to paint homes by connecting on emotional level. In 1990s, the advertisements focused on the home exteriors focusing on how the paints could keep the exteriors timeless.[13] The company revamped its corporate identity in 2000s and axed Gattu as their mascot and later changed its "Asian Paints" logo to the shorter "AP" mnemonic.[14]
