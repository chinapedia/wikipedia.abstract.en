The ST. DOMINIC CATHEDRAL [1] ( ) also called COBÁN CATHEDRAL[2] is a religious building that is affiliated with the Catholic Church and is located in the town and municipality of Cobán[3] in Alta Verapaz department of the Central American country of Guatemala.[4]

The church is one of the oldest structures in the region which dates back to 1543 when it was built by Fray Melchor de Los Reyes being rebuilt later in 1741 and 1799. It was built next to a convent that was built in 1551.

The temple follows the Roman or Latin rite and is the mother of the Diocese of Verapaz (_Dioecesis Verae Pacis_) which was created in 1935 by Pope Pius XI by the Bull "quoties in regionibus".

It is under the pastoral responsibility of the Bishop Rodolfo Valenzuela Núñez.
