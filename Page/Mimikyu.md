MIMIKYU (), known in Japan as , is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's _Pokémon_ franchise. It was first introduced in _Pokémon Sun_ and _Moon_. It is referred to as the "Disguise Pokémon", as it disguises itself to look like Pikachu to make friends. Its name is a pun of "mimic you", while also referencing Pikachu.


Design and characteristics

Mimikyu is a small Pokémon, standing at eight inches tall, and is hidden almost entirely underneath a disguise.[1] It has beady black eyes which can be seen through its disguise, and a vague semblance of a foot or lower body can be seen at the hem of its disguise. It will occasionally extend a black appendage from beneath the disguise, which has black eyes, red cheeks, a squiggly black mouth, a lightning bolt-shaped stick that resembles a tail, and ears that are colored black on the top. According to the official Pokémon website, Mimikyu is "dreadfully lonely", and in an effort to emulate the popularity of Pikachu, wears the Pikachu-like costume in order to make friends.[2] Mimikyu is drawn to dark or dimly lit areas, and its health will decline if exposed to sunlight.[3]


Appearances

In the video games

Mimikyu appears in _Pokémon Sun_ and _Moon_ as a dual-type Ghost/Fairy Pokémon,[4] and changes its appearance when hit by an attack. Its special ability, "Disguise", allows it to avoid damage from an enemy attack once during a battle. In _Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon_, Mimikyu was given an exclusive Z-move called _Let's Snuggle Forever_, a Fairy-type move that requires Mimikyu to know the move _Play Rough_ and hold a _Mimikium Z_.[5] Mimikyu can be found on Ula’ula Island in the Abandoned Thrifty Megamart.[6] Mimikyu is one of the Poké Ball Pokémon in _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_, which captures a fighter when summoned. Mimikyu also appears as a Spirit. If its Spirit is equipped, the fighter will start the match with Death's Scythe.

In the anime

Mimikyu appears in the anime _Pokémon: Sun & Moon_, and is encountered by Jessie, James, and Meowth of Team Rocket. Meowth, being able to understand Mimikyu, becomes terrified by unheard horrifying things it says, and when they begin to battle, Mimikyu lifts up its disguise, nearly killing Meowth with the sight of its true form.[7] It later allies with Team Rocket when it sees them fighting Ash Ketchum's Pikachu, expressing its hatred of Pikachu as the reason why it emulates the Pokémon's appearance.[8] It joins Team Rocket in the following episode when Jessie uses James' Luxury Ball, which enables her to capture Mimikyu without the need to weaken it. A shiny Mimikyu is owned by Acerola, which nickname Mimikins. Unlike most Ghost-types, Mimikins is the ghost of a deceased Mimikyu. This allows it to float and pass through solid objects. It is often seen outside of its Poké Ball.

Other appearances

Mimikyu appears in its own music video uploaded to the official Pokémon YouTube channel, rapping a song about itself in Japanese.[9][10]


Merchandise

On October 8, 2018, it was announced that Bandai will release a Mimikyu plush doll in January 2019.[11]


Reception

_Kotaku_ called Mimikyu "Game Freak’s most brilliant and heartbreaking Pokémon that they’ve ever come up with", and noted Mimikyu's large Internet fan following.[12] Catrina Dennis of _Inverse_ also observed this following, writing that "a new, immediate obsession has begun to spread throughout the [Pokémon] fandom surrounding one addition [Mimikyu] that has pulled at players’ heartstrings already".[13] Janine Hawkins of _Paste_ explained the online attention as being a result of the character's design, writing that "fans have embraced the creature expressly because of [its] overt vulnerability ... Mimikyu was designed to emotionally compel us, and they’ve already been a huge success".[14]

_Destructoid_ listed Mimikyu as one of its staff's favorite Alolan Pokémon, stating that it is "probably going to be the star of Gen VII for a lot of people".[15] Allegra Frank of _Polygon_ wrote that Mimikyu "may be one of the most unique, creepiest Pokémon to ever join the series",[16] and Jessica Lachenal of _The Mary Sue_ wrote that "Mimikyu is as mysterious as it is adorable".[17]

Some fans have speculated that Mimikyu is the Pokémon Porygon in disguise, connecting the stress reaction said to occur when one sees Mimikyu's true form with the real-life epileptic seizures experienced by many viewers of a 1997 episode of the _Pokémon_ anime, "Dennō Senshi Porygon".[18][19]
