_WENDY & PETER PAN_ is a play by Ella Hickson, adapted from the play and novel _Peter and Wendy_ by J.M. Barrie. The play is a re-telling of the classic children's story which features Wendy Darling as the protagonist who flies away with Peter Pan to Neverland.

The play received its world premiere for the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-Upon-Avon for Christmas 2013. It later received a revival for Christmas 2015.


Background

Playwright Ella Hickson was commissioned to write a new adaptation of _Peter Pan_ for the Christmas show in Gregory Doran's first season as artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company.

This version of the classic children's story is told through Wendy Darling's perspective as she meets Peter Pan, the boy who never grows up. She and her brothers, John and Michael, fly away with Pan and Tink to Neverland where they meet with the Lost Boys and battle the evil Captain Hook. This feminist re-working of the story prominently discovers some of the darker themes within the original story and introduces some new characters, such as Tom, a fourth child of the Darling family.
