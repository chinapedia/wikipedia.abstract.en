During the Battle of Ligny 16 June 1815 the castle, a formidable redoubt, was garrisoned by a contingent from the 3rd Battalion of the Prussian 27th Regiment. during the first half of the 19th century the castle fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1860. What remains is now a moated manor house with buildings dating from the 17th and 18th centuries.
