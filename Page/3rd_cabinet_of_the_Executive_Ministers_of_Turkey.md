Fevzi_cakmak.png The 3RD CABINET OF EXECUTIVE MINISTERS OF TURKEY (19 May 1921 – 9 July 1922 ) was the third government formed by the nationalists during the Turkish War of Independence. The Republic was not yet proclaimed and the government was called _İcra vekilleri heyeti_ ("cabinet of executive ministers")


Background

The chairman of the cabinet (equivalent to prime minister) was Fevzi Pasha (later named Çakmak) who also acted as the Minister of Defense and later as the Minister of The Chief of staff after 3 August 1921. Both Fevzi Pasha and the other members of the cabinet were elected by the parliament one by one. Since Fevzi Pasha was also the chairman of the previous cabinet, this cabinet was a revision of the former cabinet.
