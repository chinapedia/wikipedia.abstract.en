REDDINGâ€“HILL HOUSE, also known as HILL HOMESTEAD and HOUSE OF SEVEN HILLS, is a historic home located at Keytesville, Chariton County, Missouri.

Additions to the building occurred over a period of about 44 years to about 1876 to become a rambling, ten room, wood frame structure and is considered "an architectural curiosity."[1]

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.[2]
