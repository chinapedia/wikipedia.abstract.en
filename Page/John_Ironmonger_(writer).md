Biography

Life and career

Ironmonger was born in Nairobi, Kenya, and attended St Lawrence College, a boarding school in Ramsgate, Kent, before studying as a Zoologist at Nottingham and Liverpool universities. His PhD thesis was a study of the ecology of freshwater leeches. He lectured for a short while at the University of Ilorin, Nigeria before taking up a career in healthcare computing in the UK. His wife Sue is a former RSPCA farm assessor and former council member of Chester Zoo. The couple believe they may be the only living Europeans to have seen a Javan rhino with a calf.

In 2017 John and Sue Ironmonger moved to Parkgate in Cheshire where they now live. They have two children, Zoe and Jonathan.

Writing

John Ironmonger's first published book was _The Good Zoo Guide_, a critical review of more than 130 UK zoos, safari parks, aquaria and bird gardens, published by Harper Collins in 1994.

His first novel, _The Notable Brain of Maximilian Ponder_, was published by Orion Books in 2012 after a publisher's auction for the manuscript. The novel explores the short and eventful life of a man who sets out to catalogue his own brain.

In 2014 his second novel, _The Coincidence Authority_ (published as _Coincidence_ by Harper Perennial in the USA), told a tale of love and predetermination set in conflict-torn Uganda. This novel in French translation (as _Le Génie des Coincidences_ translated by Christine Barbaste and published by Editions Stock) won Le Prix des Lecteurs (Reader’s Prize) at Littératures Européennes in Cognac (France) in November 2015.[2] The novel won also the prize _Prix Bouchon de cultures_. _Closures Delage cie_ ("Les Bouchages Delage") created the award in the company around 2008 in connection with the guest authors.[3]

John Ironmonger's third novel, _Not Forgetting the Whale_ (_Sans Oublier la Baleine_ in France), is a semi-apocalyptic story set in Cornwall.
