RISTO KÜBAR (born 4 December 1983)[1] is an Estonian stage, voice and film actor.


Early life and studies

Born in the small borough of Kose, he attended school at Kose Secondary School from 1990 until 1999, followed by studies at the Tallinn Old Town Educational College (VHK), graduating in 2002. After graduation from VHK he was accepted to the Estonian Music and Theatre Academy of Dramatic Art (now, the Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre) where he studied in courses under the tutelage of actor and teacher Priit Pedajas, graduating in 2006.[2][3] Among his graduating classmates were Inga Salurand, Lauri Lagle, Mari-Liis Lill, Laura Peterson, Ursula Ratasepp, Britta Vahur, and Sergo Vares.[4]


Theatre

While still a student, Risto Kübar made his stage debut at Estonian Drama Theatre in _Finis nihili_, a play written by Madis Kõiv. This was followed by a role in William Shakespeare's _A Midsummer Night's Dream_. In 2006, just after graduation, he began working at Theatre NO99 in Tallinn, where he made his debut in Anton Chekhov's _The Cherry Orchard_. Kübar has also performed at the Tallinn City Theatre in a production of George Orwell's _Animal Farm_, and the Vanemuine theatre in Tartu, where he played the role of guitarist Jaanus Nõgisto in the rock opera _Ruja_ in 2008;[5] a production based on the Estonian rock band of the same name.[6][7]

He was engaged at Theatre NO99 until 2014; where he was also involved in the international co-production _Three Kingdoms_ by Simon Stephens (directed by Sebastian Nübling). For his performance in _Orpheus Descends_ by Tennessee Williams (directed by Sebastian Nübling), Kübar was voted Young Actor of the Year 2013 by the professional journal Theater Heute. Both productions took him to the Munchner Kammerspiele, where he became a member of the ensemble from 2014 to 2015, under the direction of intendant Johan Simons.

From 2015 until 2018 Kübar was a member of the ensemble of the Belgian theatre NTGent. In 2016 he received an Arlecchino award as Best Actor for his role in the Tommy Wieringa-penned and Philipp Becker-directed _Dit zijn de namen_. Kübar played also in _Die Fremden_, a production of NTGent & Ruhrtriennale, directed by Johan Simons. On 2 September 2016 _Die Fremden_ premiered in the Kohlenmischhalle of the Zeche Auguste Victoria in Marl as part of the Ruhrtriennale 2016. The premiere in Ghent took place on 21 September 2016 in the Floralies Hall.

On the first and second of October 2016, Kübar returned to the Theatre NO99 in a production of the play _Spectacular Lightshows Of Which U Don't See The Effect_. The two-man show, with Belgian actor Benny Claessens, caused some controversy for the amount of nudity and homosexual theme, but garnered positive reviews.[8][9][10]

In February 2018, Kübar made with NTGent, director Florian Fischer and actress Lien Wildemeersch _To name herstory_. An adaptation of 'Don Quixote: which was a dream' (1986) by Kathy Acker. The press called Kübar's idiosyncratic style perfect in its content, inventor of a new language that, despite its bizarre character, communicates immediately with the audience.

Since the 2018-2019 season he has been a member of the Schauspielhaus Bochum ensemble, where he will appear in _Die Jüdin von Toledo_ by Johan Simons and in the co-production with NTGent _Oresteia_ by Milo Rau.


Film

Risto Kübar made his film debut as a voice actor in the 2006 animated short film _Maraton_ for Eesti Joonisfilm. He followed this as a voice extra in the feature-length Heiki Ernits and Janno Põldma-directed Estonian animated children's film _Leiutajateküla Lotte_ (English: _Lotte from Gadgetville_). His most prominent film role to date was a starring role in the 2011 Rainer Sarnet-directed _Idioot_; an adaptation of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's _The Idiot_.[11]


Personal life

On 6 October 2014, Risto Kübar penned an open letter addressed to Estonian lawyer Varro Vooglaid, who is the foundation chairman of SA Family and Defense of Tradition (SAPTK) (Estonian: _Perekonna ja Traditsiooni Kaitseks_). The letter, printed in the daily Estonian newspaper _Postimees_, was a personal and public appeal that took aim at Vooglaid's anti-gay sentiments and opposition towards the gender-neutral civil partnership law passed by the Estonian Parliament; a _cohabitation agreement_ that gives the same legal protections to same-sex couples that are available to opposite-sex couples.[12] In the letter, Kübar publicly came out as gay, making him one of the first well-known Estonian celebrities to do so.[13]

His older brother is sidecar motorcross racer Silver Kübar (et).[14] [15]
