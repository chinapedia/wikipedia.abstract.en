_IL GIORNO DEI RAGAZZI_ was a weekly comic supplement magazine of the Italian newspaper _Il Giorno_, published between 1957 and 1968.


History and profile

The comic magazine debuted on 28 March 1957. It was originally intended as the Italian version of the British children's periodical _Eagle_, of which it published several series such as _Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future_, _Storm Nelson_ and ' _Riders of the Range_. It also presented a significant Italian production, mainly of humorous genre, which included Benito Jacovitti's _Cocco Bill_, _Gionni Galassia_ and _Tom Ficcanaso_, Bruno Bozzetto's comic versions of _West and Soda_ and _VIP my Brother Superman_, Giovanni Manca's _Pier Cloruro de' Lambicchi_, _Poldo e Poldino_ by Andrea Lavezzolo and Giuseppe Perego, _I Naufraghi_ by Pier Carpi and Sergio Zaniboni.[1][2]

In the late 1966 the contract with _Eagle_ expired, and subsequently many series abruptly disappeared; the magazine adopted a bedsheet format in January 1967 and a tabloid format in 1968, but the sales kept to decline, and the magazine finally closed in December 1968, replaced by _Giochi-Quiz_, a puzzle supplement.[3][4]

In 1993 _Il Giorno_ tried to resurrect the brand, creating a weekly comic supplement titled _Il Giorno Ragazzi_. After 22 issues, the supplement was incorporated in the pages of the newspaper, before being eventually dismissed after forty issues.[5]
