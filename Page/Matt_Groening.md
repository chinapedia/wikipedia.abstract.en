MATTHEW ABRAHAM GROENING ( ; born February 15, 1954)[1] is an American cartoonist, writer, producer, animator, and voice actor. He is the creator of the comic strip _Life in Hell_ (1977–2012) and the television series _The Simpsons_ (1989–present), _Futurama_ (1999–2003, 2008–2013), and _Disenchantment_ (2018–present). _The Simpsons_ is the longest-running U.S. primetime-television series in history and the longest-running U.S. animated series and sitcom.

Groening made his first professional cartoon sale of _Life in Hell_ to the avant-garde _Wet_ magazine in 1978. At its peak, the cartoon was carried in 250 weekly newspapers. _Life in Hell_ caught the attention of James L. Brooks. In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation for the Fox variety show _The Tracey Ullman Show_. Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his _Life in Hell_ characters for the show. Fearing the loss of ownership rights, Groening decided to create something new and came up with a cartoon family, the Simpson family, and named the members after his own parents and sisters—while Bart was an anagram of the word "brat". The shorts would be spun off into their own series _The Simpsons_, which has since aired episodes. In 1997, Groening and former _Simpsons_ writer David X. Cohen developed _Futurama_, an animated series about life in the year 3000, which premiered in 1999, running for four years on Fox, then picked up by Comedy Central for additional seasons. Groening developed a new series for Netflix titled _Disenchantment_, which premiered in August 2018.

Groening has won 12 Primetime Emmy Awards, ten for _The Simpsons_ and two for _Futurama_ as well as a British Comedy Award for "outstanding contribution to comedy" in 2004. In 2002, he won the National Cartoonist Society Reuben Award for his work on _Life in Hell_. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 14, 2012.


Early life

Groening was born on February 15, 1954[2][3] in Portland, Oregon,[4] the middle of five children (older brother Mark and sister Patty were born in 1950 and 1952, while the younger sisters Lisa and Maggie in 1956 and 1958, respectively). His Norwegian American mother, Margaret Ruth (née Wiggum; March 23, 1919 – April 22, 2013),[5] was once a teacher, and his German Canadian father, Homer Philip Groening (December 30, 1919 – March 15, 1996),[6] was a filmmaker, advertiser, writer and cartoonist.[7][8] Homer, born in Main Centre, Saskatchewan, Canada, grew up in a Mennonite, Plautdietsch-speaking family.[9]

Matt's grandfather, Abraham Groening, was a professor at Tabor College, a Mennonite Brethren liberal arts college in Hillsboro, Kansas before moving to Albany College (now known as Lewis and Clark College) in Oregon in 1930.[10]

Groening grew up in Portland,[11] and attended Ainsworth Elementary School[12] and Lincoln High School.[13] From 1972 to 1977, Groening attended The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington,[14] a liberal arts school that he described as "a hippie college, with no grades or required classes, that drew every weirdo in the Northwest." He served as the editor of the campus newspaper, _The Cooper Point Journal_, for which he also wrote articles and drew cartoons. He befriended fellow cartoonist Lynda Barry after discovering that she had written a fan letter to Joseph Heller, one of Groening's favorite authors, and had received a reply.[15] Groening has credited Barry with being "probably [his] biggest inspiration."[16] He first became interested in cartoons after watching the Disney animated film _One Hundred and One Dalmatians_,[17] and he has also cited Robert Crumb, Ernie Bushmiller, Ronald Searle [18] and Charles M. Schulz as inspirations.[19]


Career

Early career

In 1977, at the age of 23, Groening moved to Los Angeles to become a writer. He went through what he described as "a series of lousy jobs," including being an extra in the television movie _When Every Day Was the Fourth of July_,[20] busing tables, washing dishes at a nursing home, clerking at the Hollywood Licorice Pizza record store, landscaping in a sewage treatment plant, and chauffeuring and ghostwriting for a retired Western director.[21]

_Life in Hell_

Groening described life in Los Angeles to his friends in the form of the self-published comic book _Life in Hell_, which was loosely inspired by the chapter "How to Go to Hell" in Walter Kaufmann's book _Critique of Religion and Philosophy_.[22] Groening distributed the comic book in the book corner of Licorice Pizza, a record store in which he worked. He made his first professional cartoon sale to the avant-garde _Wet_ magazine in 1978.[23] The strip, titled "Forbidden Words," appeared in the September/October issue of that year.[24]

Groening had gained employment at the _Los Angeles Reader_, a newly formed alternative newspaper, delivering papers, typesetting, editing and answering phones. He showed his cartoons to the editor, James Vowell, who was impressed and eventually gave him a spot in the paper. _Life in Hell_ made its official debut as a comic strip in the _Reader_ on April 25, 1980.[25] Vowell also gave Groening his own weekly music column, "Sound Mix," in 1982. However, the column would rarely actually be about music, as he would often write about his "various enthusiasms, obsessions, pet peeves and problems" instead. In an effort to add more music to the column, he "just made stuff up,"[26] concocting and reviewing fictional bands and nonexistent records. In the following week's column, he would confess to fabricating everything in the previous column and swear that everything in the new column was true. Eventually, he was finally asked to give up the "music" column. Among the fans of the column was Harry Shearer, who would later become a voice on _The Simpsons_.[27]

_Life in Hell_ became popular almost immediately. In November 1984, Deborah Caplan, Groening's then-girlfriend and co-worker at the _Reader_, offered to publish "Love is Hell", a series of relationship-themed _Life in Hell_ strips, in book form. Released a month later, the book was an underground success, selling 22,000 copies in its first two printings. _Work is Hell_ soon followed, also published by Caplan. Soon afterward, Caplan and Groening left and put together the Life in Hell Co., which handled merchandising for _Life in Hell_. Groening also started Acme Features Syndicate, which syndicated _Life in Hell_, Lynda Barry and John Callahan, but now only syndicates _Life in Hell_. At the end of its run, _Life in Hell_ was carried in 250 weekly newspapers and has been anthologized in a series of books, including _School is Hell_, _Childhood is Hell_, _The Big Book of Hell_, and _The Huge Book of Hell_.[28] Although Groening has stated, "I'll never give up the comic strip. It's my foundation,"[29] he announced that the June 16, 2012 strip would mark _Life in Hell_{{'}}s conclusion.[30] After Groening ended the strip, the Center for Cartoon Studies commissioned a poster that was presented to Groening in honor of his work. The poster contained tribute cartoons by 22 of Groening's cartoonist friends who were influenced by _Life in Hell_.[31]

_The Simpsons_

Creation

_Life in Hell_ caught the attention of Hollywood writer-producer and Gracie Films founder James L. Brooks, who had been shown the strip by fellow producer Polly Platt.[32] In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation on an undefined future project,[33] which would turn out to be developing a series of short animated skits, called "bumpers," for the Fox variety show _The Tracey Ullman Show_. Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his _Life in Hell_ characters for the show. Groening feared that he would have to give up his ownership rights, and that the show would fail and would take down his comic strip with it.[34] Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family: Homer, the overweight father; Marge, the slim mother; Bart, the bratty oldest child; Lisa, the intelligent middle child; and Maggie, the baby.[35][36] Groening famously named the main Simpson characters after members of his own family: his parents, Homer and Marge (Margaret or Marjorie in full), and his younger sisters, Lisa and Margaret (Maggie). Claiming that it was a bit too obvious to name a character after himself, he chose the name "Bart," an anagram of brat.[37][38] However, he stresses that aside from some of the sibling rivalry, his family is nothing like the Simpsons. Groening also has an older brother and sister, Mark and Patty, and in a 1995 interview Groening divulged that Mark "is the actual inspiration for Bart."

Maggie Groening has co-written a few _Simpsons_ books featuring her cartoon namesake.[39]

_The Tracey Ullman Show_

The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings.[40] The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette.[41] When Groening originally designed Homer, he put his own initials into the character's hairline and ear: the hairline resembled an 'M', and the right ear resembled a 'G'. Groening decided that this would be too distracting though, and redesigned the ear to look normal. He still draws the ear as a 'G' when he draws pictures of Homer for fans. Marge's distinct beehive hairstyle was inspired by _Bride of Frankenstein_ and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s, although her hair was never blue.[42][43] Bart's original design, which appeared in the first shorts, had spikier hair, and the spikes were of different lengths. The number was later limited to nine spikes, all of the same size.[44] At the time Groening was primarily drawing in black and "not thinking that [Bart] would eventually be drawn in color" gave him spikes that appear to be an extension of his head.[45] Lisa's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no character other than Maggie shares her hairline.[46] While designing Lisa, Groening "couldn't be bothered to even think about girls' hair styles".[47] When designing Lisa and Maggie, he "just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color".[48] Groening storyboarded and scripted every short (now known as _The Simpsons shorts_), which were then animated by a team including David Silverman and Wes Archer, both of whom would later become directors on the series.[49]

The Simpsons shorts first appeared in _The Tracey Ullman Show_ on April 19, 1987. Another family member, Grampa Simpson, was introduced in the later shorts. Years later, during the early seasons of _The Simpsons_, when it came time to give Grampa a first name, Groening says he refused to name him after his own grandfather, Abraham Groening, leaving it to other writers to choose a name. By coincidence, they chose "Abraham", unaware that it was the name of Groening's grandfather.[50]

Half-hour

Although _The Tracey Ullman Show_ was not a big hit, the popularity of the shorts led to a half-hour spin-off in 1989. A team of production companies adapted _The Simpsons_ into a half-hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The team included what is now the Klasky Csupo animation house. James L. Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content.[51] Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called "the mainstream trash" that they were watching.[52] The half-hour series premiered on December 17, 1989 with "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", a Christmas special.[53] "Some Enchanted Evening" was the first full-length episode produced, but it did not broadcast until May 1990, as the last episode of the first season, because of animation problems.[54]

The series quickly became a worldwide phenomenon, to the surprise of many. Groening said: "Nobody thought _The Simpsons_ was going to be a big hit. It sneaked up on everybody." _The Simpsons_ was co-developed by Groening, Brooks, and Sam Simon, a writer-producer with whom Brooks had worked on previous projects. Groening and Simon, however, did not get along and were often in conflict over the show; Groening once described their relationship as "very contentious." Simon eventually left the show in 1993 over creative differences.[55]

Like the main family members, several characters from the show have names that were inspired by people, locations or films. The name "Wiggum" for police chief Chief Wiggum is Groening's mother's maiden name. The names of a few other characters were taken from major street names in Groening's hometown of Portland, Oregon, including Flanders, Lovejoy, Powell, Quimby and Kearney.[56] Despite common fan belief that Sideshow Bob Terwilliger was named after SW Terwilliger Boulevard in Portland, he was actually named after the character Dr. Terwilliker from the film _The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T_.[57]

Although Groening has pitched a number of spin-offs from _The Simpsons_, those attempts have been unsuccessful. In 1994, Groening and other _Simpsons_ producers pitched a live-action spin-off about Krusty the Clown (with Dan Castellaneta playing the lead role), but were unsuccessful in getting it off the ground.[58][59] Groening has also pitched "Young Homer" and a spin-off about the non-Simpsons citizens of Springfield.[60]

In 1995, Groening got into a major disagreement with Brooks and other _Simpsons_ producers over "A Star Is Burns", a crossover episode with _The Critic_, an animated show also produced by Brooks and staffed with many former _Simpsons_ crew members. Groening claimed that he feared viewers would "see it as nothing but a pathetic attempt to advertise _The Critic_ at the expense of _The Simpsons_," and was concerned about the possible implication that he had created or produced _The Critic_. He requested his name be taken off the episode.[61]

Groening is credited with writing or co-writing the episodes "Some Enchanted Evening", "The Telltale Head", "Colonel Homer" and "22 Short Films About Springfield", as well as _The Simpsons Movie_, released in 2007.[62] He has had several cameo appearances in the show, with a speaking role in the episode "My Big Fat Geek Wedding". He currently serves at _The Simpsons_ as an executive producer and creative consultant.

_Futurama_

2009]] After spending a few years researching science fiction, Groening got together with _Simpsons_ writer/producer David X. Cohen (known as David S. Cohen at the time) in 1997 and developed _Futurama_, an animated series about life in the year 3000.[63][64] By the time they pitched the series to Fox in April 1998, Groening and Cohen had composed many characters and storylines; Groening claimed they had gone "overboard" in their discussions.[65] Groening described trying to get the show on the air as "by far the worst experience of [his] grown-up life."[66] The show premiered on March 28, 1999. Groening's writing credits for the show are for the premiere episode, "Space Pilot 3000" (co-written with Cohen), "Rebirth" (story) and "In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela" (story).

After four years on the air, the show was canceled by Fox. In a situation similar to _Family Guy_, however, strong DVD sales and very stable ratings on Adult Swim brought _Futurama_ back to life. When Comedy Central began negotiating for the rights to air _Futurama_ reruns, Fox suggested that there was a possibility of also creating new episodes. When Comedy Central committed to sixteen new episodes, it was decided that four straight-to-DVD films – _Bender's Big Score_ (2007), _The Beast with a Billion Backs_ (2008), _Bender's Game_ (2008) and _Into the Wild Green Yonder_ (2009) – would be produced.[67][68]

Since no new _Futurama_ projects were in production, the movie _Into the Wild Green Yonder_ was designed to stand as the _Futurama_ series finale. However, Groening had expressed a desire to continue the _Futurama_ franchise in some form, including as a theatrical film.[69] In an interview with CNN, Groening said that "we have a great relationship with Comedy Central and we would love to do more episodes for them, but I don't know... We're having discussions and there is some enthusiasm but I can't tell if it's just me".[70] Comedy Central commissioned an additional 26 new episodes, and began airing them in 2010. The show continued in to 2013,[71][72] before Comedy Central announced in April 2013 that they would not be renewing it beyond its seventh season. The final episode aired on September 4, 2013.[73]

_Disenchantment_

On January 15, 2016, it was announced that Groening was in talks with Netflix to develop a new animated series.[74] On July 25, 2017 the series, _Disenchantment_, was ordered by Netflix with a two-season order, totalling 20 episodes.[75]

Other pursuits

In 1994, Groening formed Bongo Comics (named after the character Bongo from _Life in Hell_) with Steve Vance, Cindy Vance and Bill Morrison, which publishes comic books based on _The Simpsons_ and _Futurama_ (including _Futurama Simpsons Infinitely Secret Crossover Crisis_, a crossover between the two), as well as a few original titles. According to Groening, the goal with Bongo is to "[try] to bring humor into the fairly grim comic book market." He also formed Zongo Comics in 1995, an imprint of Bongo that published comics for more mature readers, which included three issues of Mary Fleener's _Fleener_[76] and seven issues of his close friend Gary Panter's _Jimbo_ comics.[77]

Groening is known for his eclectic taste in music. His favorite band is Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention and his favorite album is _Trout Mask Replica_ by Captain Beefheart (which was produced by Zappa).[78] He guest-edited Da Capo Press's _Best Music Writing 2003_[79] and curated a US All Tomorrow's Parties music festival in 2003.[80][81] He illustrated the cover of Frank Zappa's posthumous album _Frank Zappa Plays the Music of Frank Zappa: A Memorial Tribute_ (1996).[82] In May 2010, he curated another edition of All Tomorrow's Parties in Minehead, England. He also plays the drums in the all-author rock and roll band The Rock Bottom Remainders (although he is listed as the cowbell player), whose other members include Dave Barry, Ridley Pearson, Scott Turow, Amy Tan, James McBride, Mitch Albom, Roy Blount Jr., Stephen King, Kathi Kamen Goldmark, Sam Barry and Greg Iles.[83] In July 2013, Groening co-authored _Hard Listening_ (2013) with the rest of the Rock Bottom Remainders (published by Coliloquy, LLC).[84]


Personal life

Groening and Deborah Caplan married in 1986 and had two sons together, Homer (who goes by Will) and Abe,[85] both of whom Groening occasionally portrays as rabbits in _Life in Hell_. The couple divorced in 1999 after thirteen years of marriage. In 2011, Groening married Argentine artist Agustina Picasso after a four-year relationship, and became stepfather to her daughter Camila Costantini.[86] In May 2013, Picasso gave birth to Nathaniel Philip Picasso Groening, named after writer Nathanael West. She joked that "his godfather is SpongeBob's creator Stephen Hillenburg".[87] In 2015 Groening's daughters Luna Margaret and India Mia were born.[88] Matt is the brother-in-law of _Hey Arnold!_ and _Dinosaur Train_ creator, Craig Bartlett, who is married to Groening's sister, Lisa. Arnold used to appear in _Simpsons Illustrated_.[89] On 16 June 2018, he became the father of twins for a second time when his wife gave birth to Sol Matthew and Venus Ruth, announced via Instagram.[90] Groening identifies himself as agnostic[91][92] and a liberal[93] and has often made campaign contributions to Democratic Party candidates.[94] His first cousin, Laurie Monnes Anderson, is a member of the Oregon State Senate representing eastern Multnomah County.[95]


Influences

Matt Groening has stated to have many influences in his life. These include his father, Homer Groening, an independent filmmaker and cartoonist. Other influences included Joseph Heller, Ronald Searle, Charles Schultz, Frank Zappa, Lynda Barry, Charles Burns, and Rocky and Bullwinkle [96]
