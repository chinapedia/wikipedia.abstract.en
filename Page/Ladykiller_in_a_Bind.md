_LADYKILLER IN A BIND_ is a 2016 erotic visual novel by Christine Love. The game's full name is _My Twin Brother Made Me Crossdress as Him and Now I Have to Deal with a Geeky Stalker and a Domme Beauty Who Want Me in a Bind!!_. It is described as "an erotic romantic comedy about social manipulation, crossdressing, and girls tying up other girls".[1]


Gameplay

The player takes the role of an 18-year-old woman, who is manipulated by her twin brother to impersonate him during a senior class cruise, where she is to win a popularity contest. As she interacts with fellow students during the seven days of the cruise, she may in turn manipulate and seduce them, often through BDSM scenes.

Some scenes feature nudity or sex. However, options to skip sex scenes and cover up nude protagonists with Christmas pullovers are available.[2] In January 2017, Christine Love released a patch[3] that changed a scene that had been the subject of much criticism by players and reviewers. In that scene, the player character had been made subject to nonconsensual sexual humiliation by a man.[4]


Distribution

_Ladykiller in a Bind_ is available for Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems.

The game was initially only distributed through Humble Store and was unavailable on Steam due to that platform's policy against "too much" sexual content in games.[5] A grassroots e-mail campaign by others in the video game industry sought to persuade Valve, the company operating Steam, to allow the game – pointing out that _Genital Jousting_, a game about fighting penises, was allowed on the platform. In January 2017, _Ladykiller in a Bind_ became available on Steam after Love managed to contact a person at Valve and explain the game.[6]


Reception

Critical reception

_Ladykiller in a Bind_ received "mixed or average" reviews from game critics. On Metacritic, the game has an average of 73 out of 100 based on 7 reviews.[7]

Reviewing the game in _Polygon_, Allegra Frank appreciated the well-drawn characters and the game's "elegant", "organic" portrayal of non-conventional sexuality, but criticized the "abrupt and disappointing" ending.[8] _Hardcore Gamer_{{'}}s Marcus Estrada noted the high-quality art, writing and soundtrack, as well as the game's "incredible cast of characters".[9]

Writing for _Kill Screen_, Jess Joho highlighted _Ladykiller in a Bind_{{'}}s "incredible accomplishment" of making consent – which is central to the game's erotic scenes – sexy by making "the most titillating parts show nothing more and nothing less than two people consenting, telling each other what they want with an unwavering honesty and understanding". She noted, however, that the focus on consent became at times too explicit.[10]

In _Rock, Paper, Shotgun_, Kate Gray wrote that it was "incredibly refreshing to see a game that’s not aimed by default at guys and straight people", but she criticized the game's narrative for undermining the idea of consensuality by having the protagonist deceive her partners about her gender, and as "irresponsible and damaging" for at times blurring the line between consensual BDSM acts, and forced or transactional sex.[11] After the scene at issue was changed by a patch, Simone de Rochefort and Merritt k at _Polygon_ considered the discussion about it "disheartening" in that it indicated the demand for "an impossible level of precision when dealing with messy topics, especially from queer developers".[12]

Awards

In 2017 the game won the Excellence in Narrative Award at the Independent Games Festival.[13]
