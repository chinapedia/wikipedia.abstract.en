JUN SUNG AHN or AHN JUN-SUNG (; born February 18, 1993), better known by his stage name JUN CURRY AHN, is a Korean-American musician, YouTube video producer and member of BgA. He is a classically trained violinist who is known for his 2012 violin and dance cover performance of Psy's Gangnam Style on his YouTube channel and other K-pop and pop music covers.[1][2][3][4]


Early life

Ahn was born in South Korea and moved to West Windsor, New Jersey in the third grade of elementary school.[5][6][7] He started playing classical violin in fifth grade, performing in competitions and recitals.[8][9] He said he chose the violin because it was versatile and its sounds and characteristics matched his personality.[10] He looks up to his sister as an influence and said, "She is the smartest, most caring, silly person I know, and I always strive to be just like her." He said he had a phase in middle school when he admired his mother's cooking and watched the cooking channel after school, thinking that he would like to be a chef, and enjoys making her spaghetti aglio e olio and his favorite kimchi soup.[11] He describes his father as "the best father, mentor, role model, friend" and his "#1 fan".

Later at college, although he majored in radio/TV/film, and not music, he still joined Northwestern University's orchestra and participated in the Asian-concentrated dance crew, 'Refresh'.[12][13] By his sophomore year in 2012, he no longer studied violin formally, but continued to play,[14] and described himself as a mediocre pianist and a beginning guitarist.[15]

Artistry

He has described his violin style as "slightly playful", because of the enjoyment he has as he plays and listens to music, hoping to share the same with his audience. In 2012, he said because he covers many vocal songs, he tries to use his violin to bring out the same human feel and tones, listening to the song for a few days and playing by ear as he practices for the final recording. Rather than creating a "perfect" music, he finds it important to include his personal feelings and emotions to create a story with the music, that his audience identifies as his own.[47]

He described his YouTube work as building a portfolio, with his passion for film portrayed in his violin playing, and with each video having a cinematic quality.[48]
