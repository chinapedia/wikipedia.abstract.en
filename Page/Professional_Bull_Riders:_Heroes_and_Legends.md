PROFESSIONAL BULL RIDERS HEROES AND LEGENDS Celebration honors four special divisions of the professional bull riding community. Each award recognizes a substantial contribution to the sport.[1]

Professional Bull Riders (PBR) is an international professional bull riding organization based in Pueblo, Colorado.[2][3] It began in 1992, when 21 bull riders pooled $1,000 each to found the organization, which was dedicated to bull riding separate from its traditional inclusion as one of several rodeo events.[4][5] Today, the PBR is one of the top ten fastest growing sports organizations in the world.[6] It sponsors the Unleash the Beast Series, where the top 35 best bull riders in the world compete, along with the best bucking bulls.[7][8]


Professional Bull Riders Champions

Heroes and Legends Celebrations lists the Ring of Honor, Ty Murray Top Hand Award, Brand of Honor, Jim Shoulders Award, and the Sharon Shoulders Award. The List of Professional Bull Riders Champions article presents a list of major champions and honors won by Professional Bull Riders.


Ring of Honor

The PBR Ring of Honor is the equivalent of a Hall of Fame for bull riders.[9][10] The PBR created this award in 1996 to recognize those who have had a "significant and lasting contribution to the sport of professional bull riding".[11] Honorees may be PBR bull riders, but some PRCA bull riders have also been honored, for example, icon Lane Frost.[12] "It is both a physical ring and a fellowship of men."[13] This honor is bestowed upon "select bull riders whose contributions to the sport of bull riding last beyond their success in the competitive arena". The award is "symbolized by a custom-made, gold-and-diamond ring engraved with the honoree's name and the PBR logo". Recipients are honored with this award during a ceremony at the Unleash the Beast Series World Finals near the end of the year.[14]

It was created in 1996 with the inaugural induction of ProRodeo Hall of Fame members Jim Shoulders and Ted Nuce.[15][16]

The Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA), which sanctions traditional rodeo, has the ProRodeo Hall of Fame.[17] The Bull Riding Hall of Fame located in Fort Worth, Texas, is not associated with the PBR.[18]

Brand of Honor

First awarded in 2011 to Little Yellow Jacket, the Brand of Honor is awarded to a bull for superlative performance in the PBR.[19] The PBR recognizes that "there are two great athletes in every ride".[20] Brand of Honor bulls are elite athletes who transcend the sport and few make the cut.[21] In 2016, Bushwacker was awarded the Brand of Honor. This three-time World Champion bucking bull, now retired, is universally considered to be the best in bull riding history.[22][23]
