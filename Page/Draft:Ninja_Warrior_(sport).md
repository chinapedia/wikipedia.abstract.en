NINJASPORT,[1] the sport of NINJA WARRIOR,[2], NINJA WARRIOR SPORT,[3] also called NINJA COMPETITIONS,[4] or NINJATHLETICS,[5] is an obstacle course racing sport, a variant with rock climbing, parkour and gymnastics contributions. It is a spin-off of Japanese obstacle course TV game show "Sasuke" aka "Ninja Warrior". The flagship events are the various unlicensed copies of and officially franchised Ninja Warrior TV shows.[6] Athletes who compete in _ninja warrior competitions_[7] refer to themselves as _ninjas_,[8] though also sometimes call themselves "ninja warriors",[9] "ninja athletes",[10] or "ninjathletes".[11]

The development of the sport has been compared to the rise of rock-climbing gyms, skateboarding parks, and CrossFit.[12] Multiple disciplines of the sport have been shown on-air, including individual competition, team-based competition, head-to-head competition, head-to-head team competition, relay competition, and head-to-head relay competition.[13][14][15][16] The more successful ninja athletes who compete on the TV shows require year round dedication to training to successfully compete.[17] Ninjasport is also promoted to the public to get sedentary youngsters to go out and play in physical activity and away from game consoles; and to fight childhood obesity.[18][19]

Ninjasport is in the category of functional fitness sports, along with CrossFit, and parkour, which are less style conscious that many other sports, but more focused on acquiring skills and abilities. Its naming has been criticized for exploiting Japanese culture, and lack of connection to the ninja, as the bellicose flamboyant competitions in ninjasport are a far cry from the stealthiness expected of ninjas who used stealth for assassination.[20] It has also been noted for its leveling the field, in allowing competitors from all walks of life to compete directly against each other, whether they are international calibre athletes or stay-at-home parents; and inspiring similar to start competing and getting fit. Kareem Abdul Jabbar observes that it fits the American mindset and culture with its individualistic and democratic participation.[21]


Obstacles

Ninjasport feature prominently agility and upper body strength obstacles.[22] Among the favorite obstacles in ninja warrior, are the warped wall and the salmon ladder.[23]


International accreditation

An international sports federation has sprung up to administer ninjasport as a _sport_. "Ninja Sports International" was founded to promote the sport, promote safety, and promote interaction through conferences.[24]


Regional distribution

Outside of the TV show, events and facilities exist.[25][26]

In the United States, a national championships has been established. Regional and local competitions also exist around the USA. Training facilities ("ninja" gyms) also exist across the country.[27][28] Gyms started to appear around 2014, and many stars of American Ninja Warrior have opened their own gyms. A national association of ninja gyms has been established, the _National Ninja League_, with the express goal of confirming ninja warrior as an established sport.[29]

In France, in 2016, a local competition, a ninja gym, have both opened.[30]

In Britain, in 2016, a ninja gym has opened.[31]

In New Zealand, in 2016, a ninja park has opened.[32]

In Hong Kong, in 2018, competitions have been held for the public.[33]

In Australia, the sport has risen rapidly, driven by its TV counterpart, Australian Ninja Warrior, and similarity in rapid popularity of its 1990s TV sport predecessor Australian Gladiators.[34]
