JAMES GOW (1854–1923) was an English scholar, educator, historian, and author, widely recognized for _A Short History of Greek Mathematics_. The history drew highly upon the work of Moritz Cantor,[1] as well as upon pioneering works of Carl Anton Bretschneider, Hermann Hankel, and George Johnston Allman,[2] but included material, e.g., gematria, not discussed by contemporary historians of mathematics.
