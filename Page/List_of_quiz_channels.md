Europe

Belgium

The games started airing as from 2004. In Flanders the main TV channels already banned the games between 2008 and 2010, except vtm and 2BE who stopped in 2011. In Wallonia the games are still broadcast.

The Belgian cabaret Neveneffecten had a TV-show Basta in January 2011 on channel Eén. In their second episode, Basta could prove these games were a fraud. Neveneffecten found a job posting as host for such games and they asked Maxime De Winne to apply for the job and to go undercover. De Winne got the job and was a host for about 4 months and used hidden cameras to record conversations with the management. Neveneffecten also hired a math expert: Gaeten de Weert. After some months, De Weert was able to solve every math puzzle, but noticed the answer of the puzzle is incorrect in 16% of the cases due to miscalculation of the producers. De Weert called the studio during a live game and was able to give the correct answer. He also said the show was a fraud and he was going to publish the solution key on the Internet, which he actually did. The episode was aired on 17 January 2011, vtm and 2BE decided to stop the games as from 20 January 2011.[13][14]

The broadcast did not have effect in Wallonia although De Weert was also able to break the solution keys of the call games on these channels in August 2013.[15] The games are no more aired since March 2014.[16]
