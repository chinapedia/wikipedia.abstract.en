MAXIMATELECOM is a Russian technology company engaged in the development and commercialization of public wireless networks, Wi-Fi network operator in the Moscow Metro.


History

The company was founded in 2004 and for long time was an asset of the Russian systems integrator . In 2013, MaximaTelecom was purchased by a group of private investors headed by Sergey Aslanyan, the former president of the group Sitronics. In July of the same year the company took part in the auction of the Moscow Metro for the right to create Wi-Fi network and signed a contract as the only bidder.[1][2][3][4]


Projects

Moscow Metro

The main contenders for the creation and maintenance of the network in the Moscow metro were cellular operators, members of the 'big three' - MegaFon, Mobile TeleSystems and VimpelCom. Access to the subway infrastructure was interesting for the companies in terms of expanding the coverage area of their own mobile networks and Internet connections. However, operators did not like rates for cabling and placement of base stations, which were significantly increased in 2011.[5] In 2012, two mobile operators launched pilot projects to create Wi-Fi networks that haven’t been developed: MTS created coverage area in the trains of the Circle Line, Vimpelcom — in two trains of Sokolnicheskaya Line.[6]

In December 2012 the Metro held an auction for the right to create a network for the first time. Project Technical requirement presupposed launching of a network for passengers as well as a separate network for internal use; executor of the project received a discount for renting the Moscow subway infrastructure. Companies considered these conditions unattractive and refused to participate in the auction. In the second auction, held in June 2013, the organizer refused to create an internal network and increased preferences for an executor, but the mobile operators were not satisfied with the discount rates. The auction received no bids and it was declared invalid.[7]

Third auction, in July, received the only request from MaximaTelecom. Metro signed a 15-years contract with the only participant at the starting price. According to the contract, the company committed to provide all the rolling stock of Moscow subway with Wi-Fi connection - more than 4,800 cars at that time; the pay-back period was estimated as 7 years at a cost for the project of 1.5 billion rubles.[8][9][10][11][12]

On 1 September 2013 the first network was launched in trains of Kakhovskaya line, on 25 December – in trains of Circle Line. The link-up of Kalininskaya and Sokolnicheskaya line was completed in February and March 2014 respectively.[13][14][15][16] The company planned a simultaneous commissioning of the network on the Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya, Zamoskvoretskaya, Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya and Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya metro lines in October 2014, but on Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya and Zamoskvoretskaya lines network was launched ahead of schedule in July.[17][18][19][20][21] By 1 December 2014 free Wi-Fi was available on all lines of the Moscow Metro.[22] Moreover, the pilot mode network was launched on station platforms Vystavochnaya, Delovoy Tsentr, Ulitsa Starokachalovskaya and Bulvar Dmitriya Donskogo.[23]

More than 900 base stations were installed at 450–900 meters interval to provide coverage over the entire length of the lines. Their signal within the 5 GHz limit is transmitted to fin antennas on the last cars of all 650 trains. From the routers under the antenna the signal is transmitted along the train to all access points in the cars. The network is automatically reconfiguring in case of restructuring the train, adding or detaching cars. Base stations were installed at night, workers laid approximately 2-3 kilometers of cable per shift; the total length of fiber-optic communication lines is more than 880 kilometers.[24][25][26][27] This solution provides access to 70-100 Mbit/s connection (potentially this speed may be increased to 150 Mbit/s using a special software).[28][29] Capacity of the whole network estimates 20 Gbit/s.[30]

In late 2014 – early 2015 the company brought the project in compliance with the requirements of the identification of users, introduced to the _Federal Law № 149-FZ On Information, Information Technologies and Protection of Information_ by a Government Order number 758 of 31 July 2014, that obliged users to log in with a mobile phone number.[31][32] In July 2015, an alternative method of identification — with the account — was introduced.[33] During the year, this option was used by 600 thousand users.[34]

In December 2014 MaximaTelecom offered to the operators of 'the big three' to join the project on the organization of cellular network coverage based on Wi-Fi infrastructure Moscow metro network. The proposition was based on the use of portable base stations (femtocells).[35] Tender documentation was submitted for examination to the city authorities.[36] In May 2016 MaximaTelecom signed a strategic cooperation agreement with MTS, which implies the implementation of a project to provide subway passengers with mobile connection of the operator.[37]

Petersburg Metro

MaximaTelecom is negotiating the development of Wi-Fi networks in trains and stations of the Saint Petersburg Metro with the Government of St. Petersburg. 1 billion rubles is the estimated cost of the project and 1 year is the time of project’s performance. Despite the mutual interest in cooperation, the parties have not reached a compromise on the issue of renting the metro infrastructure: the operator insisted on a nominal fee, but Metro requested about 170 million rubles per year.[38]

As a result, the company refused to participate in the contest, held by the Petersburg metro in November 2015. The contest was declared invalid due to the absence of the applications.[39] Subsequently, the company reported that it is ready to consider participation in the new tender if the conditions are changed.[40]

Since July 2016 the network has again become free.[41][42] In December 2015 AURA wireless network was launched in the Aeroexpress terminal at Paveletsky railway station, in April 2016 — in the terminal at Sheremetyevo airport. The contract between MaximaTelecom and Aeroexpress implies launching the WiFi connection in the remaining terminals in Domodedovo and Vnukovo airports, and at Belorussky and Kievsky railway stations.[43][44] In September 2016 the company will start the monetization of Wi-Fi network in Aeroexpress train.[45]
