HENRY LAWRENCE GARFIELD (born February 13, 1961), better known as HENRY ROLLINS, is an American singer, songwriter, musician, actor, presenter, comedian, and activist.[1][2][3] He currently hosts a weekly radio show on KCRW, is a regular columnist for _Rolling Stone Australia_, and was a regular columnist for _LA Weekly_.[4]

After performing in the short-lived band State of Alert in 1980, Rollins fronted the California hardcore punk band Black Flag from 1981 to 1986. Following the band's breakup, he established the record label and publishing company 2.13.61 to release his spoken word albums, and formed the Rollins Band, which toured with a number of lineups from 1987 to 2003 (and again in 2006).

Rollins has hosted numerous radio shows, such as _Harmony in My Head_ on Indie 103, and television shows such as _The Henry Rollins Show_, _120 Minutes_, and _Jackass_. He had recurring dramatic roles in the second season of _Sons of Anarchy_, in the final seasons of the animated series _The Legend of Korra_ as Zaheer, and has also had roles in several films. He has campaigned for various political causes in the United States, including the promotion of LGBT rights, World Hunger Relief, the West Memphis Three, and an end to all war.


Early life

Rollins was born Henry Lawrence Garfield in Washington, D.C. on February 13, 1961, the only child of Iris and Paul Garfield.[5][6][7][8] His father was of Jewish descent. Rollins' Latvian paternal great-grandfather, Henach Luban, fled to the U.S. from Rēzekne (then part of the Russian Empire) and changed his first name to Henry.[9] When Rollins was three years old, his parents divorced and he was raised by his mother in the affluent Washington neighborhood of Glover Park.[10][11][12][13] As a child and teenager, Rollins was sexually assaulted,[14] and he suffered from depression and low self-esteem.[15] In fourth grade, he was diagnosed with hyperactivity and took Ritalin for several years to focus during school.

Rollins attended The Bullis School, then an all-male preparatory school in Potomac, Maryland.[16] According to Rollins, the school helped him to develop a sense of discipline and a strong work ethic.[17] It was at Bullis that he began writing.[18] In 1987, he said that he had not seen his father since the age of 18,[19] and, in 2019, wrote, "What my father thinks of me, or if he is still alive, I have no idea."[20] After high school, he attended American University in Washington for one semester, but dropped out in December 1979.[21][22] He began working minimum-wage jobs, including a job as a courier for kidney samples at the National Institutes of Health.[23]


Music career

State of Alert

Rollins developed an interest in punk rock after he and his friend Ian MacKaye procured a copy of The Ramones' eponymous debut album; he later described it as "akin to shooting heroin." From 1979 to 1980, Rollins was working as a roadie for Washington bands, including Teen Idles. When the band's singer Nathan Strejcek failed to appear for practice sessions, Rollins convinced the Teen Idles to let him sing. Word of Rollins' ability spread around the punk rock scene in Washington; Bad Brains singer H.R. would sometimes get Rollins on stage to sing with him.[24] In 1980, the Washington punk band the Extorts lost their frontman Lyle Preslar to Minor Threat. Rollins joined the others of the band to form State of Alert (S.O.A.) and became its frontman and vocalist. He put words to the band's five songs and wrote several more. S.O.A. recorded their sole EP, _No Policy_, and released it in 1981 on MacKaye's Dischord Records.[25]

Around April 1981, drummer Simon Jacobsen was replaced by Ivor Hanson. At the time, Hanson's father was a top admiral in the U.S. Navy and his family shared living quarters with the U.S. Vice President in the Naval Observatory. The band held their practices there and would have to be let in by Secret Service agents.[26]

S.O.A. disbanded after a total of a dozen concerts and one EP. Rollins had enjoyed being the band's frontman, and had earned a reputation for fighting in shows. He later said, "I was like nineteen and a young man all full of steam and _loved_ to get in the dust-ups." By this time, Rollins had become the assistant manager of the Georgetown Häagen-Dazs ice cream store; his steady employment had helped to finance the S.O.A. EP.[27]

Black Flag

In 1980, a friend gave Rollins and MacKaye a copy of Black Flag's _Nervous Breakdown_ EP. Rollins soon became a fan of the band, exchanging letters with bassist Chuck Dukowski and later inviting the band to stay in his parents' home when Black Flag toured the East Coast in December 1980.[28] When Black Flag returned to the East Coast in 1981, Rollins attended as many of their concerts as he could. At an impromptu show in a New York bar, Black Flag's vocalist Dez Cadena allowed Rollins to sing "Clocked In", a song Rollins had asked the band to play in light of the fact that he had to drive back to Washington, D.C. to begin work.[29]

Unbeknownst to Rollins, Cadena wanted to switch to guitar, and the band was looking for a new vocalist.[30] The band was impressed with Rollins' singing and stage demeanor, and the next day, after a semi-formal audition at Tu Casa Studio in New York City, they asked him to become their permanent vocalist. Despite some doubts, he accepted, in part because of MacKaye's encouragement. His high level of energy and intense personality suited the band's style, but Rollins' diverse tastes in music were a key factor in his being selected as singer; Black Flag's founder Greg Ginn was growing restless creatively and wanted a singer who was willing to move beyond simple, three-chord punk.[31]

Black_Flag_logo.svg]] After joining Black Flag in 1981, Rollins quit his job at Häagen-Dazs, sold his car, and moved to Los Angeles. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Rollins got the Black Flag logo tattooed on his left biceps[32] and also on the back of his neck, chose the stage name of Rollins, a surname he and MacKaye had used as teenagers.[33] Rollins played his first show with Black Flag on August 21, 1981 at Cuckoo's Nest in Costa Mesa, California.[34] Rollins was in a different environment in Los Angeles; the police soon realized he was a member of Black Flag, and he was hassled as a result. Rollins later said: "That really scared me. It freaked me out that an adult would do that. [...] My little eyes were opened big time."[35]

Before concerts, as the others of the band tuned up, Rollins would stride about the stage dressed only in a pair of black shorts, grinding his teeth; to focus before the show, he would squeeze a pool ball.[36] His stage persona impressed several critics; after a 1982 show in Anacortes, Washington, _Sub Pop_ critic Calvin Johnson wrote: "Henry was incredible. Pacing back and forth, lunging, lurching, growling; it was all real, the most intense emotional experiences I have ever seen."[37]

By 1983, Rollins' stage persona was increasingly alienating him from the rest of Black Flag. During a show in England, Rollins assaulted a member of the audience who attacked Ginn; Ginn later scolded Rollins, calling him a "macho asshole".[38] A legal dispute with Unicorn Records held up further Black Flag releases until 1984, and Ginn was slowing the band's tempo down so that they would remain innovative. In August 1983, guitarist Dez Cadena had left the band; a stalemate lingered between Dukowski and Ginn, who wanted Dukowski to leave, before Ginn fired Dukowski outright.[39] 1984's heavy metal music-influenced _My War_ featured Rollins screaming and wailing throughout many of the songs; the band's members also grew their hair to confuse the band's hardcore punk audience.[40]

Black Flag's change in musical style and appearance alienated many of their original fans, who focused their displeasure on Rollins by punching him in the mouth, stabbing him with pens, or scratching him with their nails, among other methods. He often fought back, dragging audience members on stage and assaulting them. During a Black Flag concert, Rollins repeatedly punched a fan in the face who had continuously reached for his microphone.[41] Rollins became increasingly alienated from the audience; in his tour diary, Rollins wrote "When they spit at me, when they grab at me, they aren't hurting me. When I push out and mangle the flesh of another, it's falling so short of what I really want to do to them."[42] During the Unicorn legal dispute, Rollins had started a weight-lifting program, and by their 1984 tours, he had become visibly well-built; journalist Michael Azerrad later commented that "his powerful physique was a metaphor for the impregnable emotional shield he was developing around himself."[43] Rollins has since replied that "no, the training was just basically a way to push myself."[44]

Rollins Band and solo releases

Along with Haskett, Rollins soon added Andrew Weiss and Sim Cain, both former members of Ginn's side-project Gone, and called the new group Rollins Band. The band toured relentlessly,[47] and their 1987 debut album, _Life Time_, was quickly followed by the outtakes and live collection _Do It_. The band continued to tour throughout 1988; in 1989 another Rollins Band album, _Hard Volume_ was released.[48] Another live album, _Turned On_, and another spoken word release, _Live at McCabe's_, followed in 1990.

In 1991, the Rollins Band signed a distribution deal with Imago Records and appeared at the Lollapalooza festival; both improved the band's presence. However, in December 1991, Rollins and his best friend Joe Cole were accosted by two armed robbers outside Rollins's home. Cole was murdered by a gunshot to the head, Rollins escaped without injury but police suspected him in the murder and detained him for ten hours.[49] Although traumatized by Cole's death, as chronicled in his book _Now Watch Him Die_, Rollins continued to release new material; the spoken-word album _Human Butt_ appeared in 1992 on his own record label, 2.13.61. The Rollins Band released _The End of Silence_, Rollins's first charting album.[50]

The following year, Rollins released a spoken-word double album, _The Boxed Life_.[51] The Rollins Band embarked upon the _End of Silence_ tour; bassist Weiss was fired toward its end, and replaced by funk and jazz bassist Melvin Gibbs. According to critic Steve Huey, 1994 was Rollins's "breakout year".[52] The Rollins Band appeared at Woodstock 94 and released _Weight_, which ranked on the Billboard Top 40. Rollins released _Get in the Van: On the Road with Black Flag_, a double-disc set of him reading from his Black Flag tour diary of the same name; he won the Grammy for Best Spoken Word Recording as a result. Rollins was named 1994's "Man of the Year" by the American men's magazine _Details_ and became a contributing columnist to the magazine. With the increased exposure, Rollins made several appearances on American music channels MTV and VH1 around this time, and made his Hollywood film debut in 1994 in _The Chase_ playing a police officer.[53]

In 1995, the Rollins Band's record label, Imago Records, declared itself bankrupt. Rollins began focusing on his spoken word career. He released _Everything_, a recording of a chapter of his book _Eye Scream_ with free jazz backing, in 1996. He continued to appear in various films, including _Heat_, _Johnny Mnemonic_ and _Lost Highway_. The Rollins Band signed to Dreamworks Records in 1997 and soon released _Come in and Burn_, but it did not receive as much critical acclaim as their previous material. Rollins continued to release spoken-word book readings, releasing _Black Coffee Blues_ in the same year. In 1998, Rollins released _Think Tank_, his first set of non-book-related spoken material in five years.

By 1998, Rollins felt that the relationship with his backing band had run its course, and the line-up disbanded. He had produced a Los Angeles hard rock band called Mother Superior, and invited them to form a new incarnation of the Rollins Band. Their first album, _Get Some Go Again_, was released two years later. The Rollins Band released several more albums, including 2001's _Nice_ and 2003's _Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three_. After 2003, the band became inactive as Rollins focused on radio and television work. During a 2006 appearance on _Tom Green Live!_, Rollins stated that he "may never do music again",[54] a feeling which he reiterated in 2011 when talking to _Trebuchet_ magazine.[55] In an interview with _Culture Brats_, Rollins admitted he had sworn off music for good – "... and I must say that I miss it every day. I just don't know honestly what I could do with it that's different."[56]

In 2014, Rollins admitted a disdain for rehashing old music for the sake of it – "I don't want to play old music. To me, it is fighting battles that are already over and calling yourself a warrior. For me, I see no courage or adventure in doing the old thing over again. If others want to, that's for them. For myself, I have to move on. Life is too short to live in the past. There is a lot to be done."[57] On the same topic, Rollins more recently said in 2016 "For me, music was a time and a place. I never really enjoyed being in a band. It was in me and it needed to come out, like a 25-year exorcism. One day, I woke up, and I didn't have any more lyrics. I just had nothing to contribute to the form, and I was done with band practice and traveling in groups."[58]

Rollins is a guest star on Damian Cowell's 2017 album _Get Yer Dag On!_.

Musical style

As a vocalist, Rollins has adopted a number of styles through the years. He was noted in the Washington, D.C. hardcore scene for what journalist Michael Azerrad described as a "compelling, raspy howl."[59] With State of Alert, Rollins "spat out the lyrics like a bellicose auctioneer."[60] He adopted a similar style after joining Black Flag in 1981. By their album _Damaged_, however, Black Flag began to incorporate a swing beat into their style. Rollins then abandoned his State of Alert "bark" and adopted the band's swing.[61] Rollins later explained: "What I was doing kind of matched the vibe of the music. The music was intense and, well, I was as intense as you needed."[62]

In both incarnations of the Rollins Band, Rollins combined spoken word with his traditional vocal style in songs such as "Liar" (the song begins with a one-minute spoken diatribe by Rollins), barked his way through songs (such as "Tearing" and "Starve"), and employed the loud-quiet dynamic. _Rolling Stone_'s Anthony DeCurtis names Rollins a "screeching hate machine" and his "hallmark" as "the sheets-of-sound assault".[63]

With the Rollins Band, his lyrics focused "almost exclusively on issues relating to personal integrity," according to critic Geoffrey Welchman.[64]

As producer

In the 1980s, Rollins produced an album of acoustic songs for the famed convict Charles Manson titled _Completion_. The record was supposed to be released by SST Records, but the project was canceled because the label received death threats for working with Manson. Only five test presses of _Completion_ were pressed, two of which remain in Rollins' possession.[65]

In 1995, Rollins produced Australian hard rock band the Mark of Cain's third full-length album _Ill at Ease_.[66]

On May 19, 2004, Rollins began hosting a weekly radio show, _Harmony in My Head_, on Indie 103.1 radio in Los Angeles. The show aired every Monday evening, with Rollins playing music ranging from early rock and jump blues to hard rock, blues rock, folk rock, punk rock, heavy metal and rockabilly, and touching on hip hop, jazz, world music, reggae, classical music and more. _Harmony in my Head_ often emphasizes B-sides, live bootlegs and other rarities, and nearly every episode has featured a song either by the Beastie Boys or British group The Fall.

Rollins put the show on a short hiatus to undertake a spoken-word tour in early 2005. Rollins posted playlists and commentary on-line; these lists were expanded with more information and published in book form as _Fanatic!_ through 2.13.61 in November 2005. In late 2005, Rollins announced the show's return and began the first episode by playing the show's namesake Buzzcocks song.

We’ve been working together for over 20 years and are very good friends."[89] The podcast has received positive reviews from _Rolling Stone_ and _The A.V. Club_.[90][91]

: List of voice performances on television

Books and audiobooks

Rollins has written a variety of books, including _Black Coffee Blues_, _Do I Come Here Often?_, _The First Five_ (a compilation of _High Adventure in the Great Outdoors_, _Pissing in the Gene Pool_, _Bang!_, _Art to Choke Hearts_, and _One From None_), _See a Grown Man Cry_, _Now Watch Him Die_, _Smile, You're Traveling_, _Get in the Van_, _Eye Scream_, _Broken Summers_, _Roomanitarian_, and _Solipsist_.

For the audiobook version of the 2006 novel _World War Z_ Rollins voiced the character of T. Sean Collins, a mercenary hired to protect celebrities during a mass panic caused by an onslaught of the undead. Rollins' other audiobook recordings include _3:10 to Yuma_ and his own autobiographical book _Get in the Van_, for which he won a Grammy Award.

Online journalism

In September 2008, Rollins began contributing to the "Politics & Power" blog at the online version of _Vanity Fair_ magazine.[99] Since March 2009, his posts have appeared under their own sub-title, _Straight Talk Espresso_.[100] His posts consistently criticize conservative politicians and pundits, although he does occasionally target those on the left. In August 2010, he began writing a music column for _LA Weekly_ in Los Angeles.[101] In 2012, Rollins began publishing articles with _The Huffington Post_ and alternative news website _WordswithMeaning!_. In the months leading up to the 2012 United States Presidential election, Rollins broadcast a YouTube series called "Capitalism 2012", in which he toured the capital cities of the US states, interviewing people about current issues.

Spoken word

Rollins also has toured all over the world doing spoken word performances and his shows frequently last for over three hours. His spoken word style encompasses stand up comedy, accounts of experiences he's had in the world of music and during his extensive travels around the globe, self-deprecating stories about his own shortcomings, introspective recollections from his own life (such as the death of his friend, Joe Cole), commentaries on society and playful, sometimes vulgar, anecdotes.

Video games

Rollins was a playable character in both _Def Jam: Fight for NY_ and _Def Jam Fight for NY: The Takeover_. Rollins is also the voice of Mace Griffin in _Mace Griffin: Bounty Hunter_.


Campaigning and activism

Henry_Rollins_in_Iraq_with_USO_tour.jpg (USO) tour in Iraq in 2003]] Rollins has become an outspoken human rights activist, most vocally for gay rights. In high school, a gay classmate of Rollins' was bullied by classmates to the point of attempting suicide. Rollins has cited this as the main catalyst of his "anti-homophobia."[102] Rollins frequently speaks out on justice on his spoken word tours and promotes equality, regardless of sexuality.[103] He was the host of the WedRock benefit concert, which raised money for a pro-gay-marriage organization.

During the Iraq War, he started touring with the United Service Organizations to entertain troops overseas while remaining against the war, leading him to once cause a stir at a base in Kyrgyzstan when he told the crowd: "Your commander would never lie to you. That's the vice president's job."[104] Rollins believes it is important that he performs to the troops so that they have multiple points of contact with the other parts of the world, stating that "they can get really cut loose from planet earth."[105] He has made eight tours, including visits to bases in Djibouti, Kuwait, Iraq, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan (twice), Egypt, Turkey, Qatar, Honduras, Japan, Korea and the United Arab Emirates.[106]

He has also been active in the campaign to free the "West Memphis Three"—three young men who were believed by their supporters to have been wrongfully convicted of murder, and who have since been released from prison, but not exonerated. Rollins appears with Public Enemy frontman Chuck D on the Black Flag song "Rise Above" on the benefit album _Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three_, the first time Rollins had performed Black Flag's material since 1986.[107]

Continuing his activism on behalf of US troops and veterans, Rollins joined _Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America_ (IAVA) in 2008 to launch a public service advertisement campaign, CommunityofVeterans.org, which helps veterans coming home from war reintegrate into their communities. In April 2009, Rollins helped IAVA launch the second phase of the campaign which engages the friends and family of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans at SupportYourVet.org.

On December 3, 2009, Rollins wrote of his support for the victims of the Bhopal disaster in India, in an article for _Vanity Fair_[108] 25 years–to the day–after the methyl isocyanate gas leak from the Union Carbide Corporation's pesticide factory exposed more than half a million local people to poisonous gas and resulted in the death of 17,000. He spent time in Bhopal with the people, to listen to their stories. In a later radio interview in February 2010[109] Rollins summed up his approach to activism, "This is where my anger takes me, to places like this, not into abuse but into proactive, clean movement."[110]

Rollins is an advocate for the legalization of cannabis.[111] Rollins has stated he does not personally consume cannabis,[112] but views the issue as an important matter of civil rights,[113] arguing that its illegality is based in "bigotry and racism and financing the prison–industrial complex".[114] Rollins has shared his views on the subject as keynote speaker at the Oregon Marijuana Business Conference and the International Cannabis Business Conference.[115][116][117][118]

In August 2015, Rollins discussed his support for Bernie Sanders as a candidate in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries.[119]


Personal life

Views and relationships

Rollins has said that he does not have religious or spiritual beliefs, though he also does not consider himself an atheist.[120] He has mostly avoided recreational drugs throughout his life, but experimented a few times with alcohol, cannabis, and LSD during his teens and early 20s.[121][122][123] Regarding his diet, Rollins has stated, "I eat fish, that's about it for things that have a pulse. I don't eat beef or whatever else has claws or hooves. I just don't think it's a good idea to put that stuff into my system."[124][125]

Rollins is childless by choice,[126] and says that he has not been in a romantic relationship since his 20s.[127] He considers himself a solitary person, and maintains few deep relationships outside of his professional ones.[128] One of his closest personal friends is musician Ian MacKaye, with whom he has been close since they met as children.[129] He also enjoys a friendship with actor William Shatner, which developed after he performed on Shatner's album _Has Been_.

Rollins also believes that wherever you are going would have been harder to access in the 1980s (especially if you were in a van with American hardcore punk outfit Black Flag).

Murder of Joe Cole

In December 1991, Rollins and his best friend Joe Cole were involved in a shooting when they were assaulted by robbers outside their shared home in Venice Beach, California. Cole died after being shot in the face, but Rollins escaped.[130] The murder remains unsolved. In an April 1992 _Los Angeles Times_ interview, Rollins revealed he kept a plastic container full of soil soaked with Cole's blood: "I dug up all the earth where his head fell—he was shot in the face—and I've got all the dirt here, and so Cole's in the house. I say good morning to him every day. I got his phone, too, so I got a direct line to him. So that feels good."[131]

In a 2001 interview with Howard Stern, Rollins was asked about rumors that he kept Cole's brain in his house. He stated that he only has the soil from the spot where Cole was killed. During the interview, he also speculated that the reason they were targeted may have been because, days prior to the incident, record producer Rick Rubin had requested to hear the newly recorded album _The End of Silence_ and parked his Rolls-Royce outside their house while carrying a cell phone. Because of the notoriety of the neighborhood, Rollins suspected that this would bring trouble because of the implication that there was money in the home. He even wrote in his journal the night of Rubin's visit that his home "is going to get popped".[132][133]

Rollins has included Cole's story in his spoken word performances.[134]
