WINCHMORE HILL CRICKET CLUB is a cricket club in London, United Kingdom. The club was formed in 1880, and play their home games at The Paulin Ground in Winchmore Hill.[1] The club competes in the Middlesex County Cricket League (MCCL), notably winning the Premier League in 2012.[2]


Club History

The club was founded in the Autumn of 1880 as Winchmore Hill Village Cricket Club by John Moore, who was Head Gardener to the Busk family at Ford’s Grove. ‘Village’ was dropped from the name in 1912 when the current club title was adopted.[3]

The pavilion dates back to 1922 and is a former Officer’s Mess from a wartime army camp in Wimbledon. The cost of the pavilion, £1,750, was borne mostly from donations and loans by the President and members.[4]

In the 1950s the West Indies batsman, Allan Rae, played for Winchmore Hill CC whilst completing a Law degree in England. During this time he also scored centuries for the West Indies at Lords and the Oval. In July 1949, a tour match organised by Rae between the West Indies and Winchmore Hill CC was played at The Paulin Ground featuring players such as Learie Constantine and Everton Weekes.[5]

In 2012, Winchmore Hill CC secured their maiden Premier League title in the penultimate game of the season against Ealing Cricket Club.[6]

In 2013, Winchmore Hill CC became part of Winchmore Hill Sports Club in recognition of the multi sport nature of the club.[7] Other sports played at The Paulin Ground include Football, Tennis, Hockey and Table Tennis.

Following the clubs maiden Middlesex Premier League title a period of poor performance followed and the 1st XI was relegated in both the 2013 and 2014 seasons to the Middlesex County Cricket League Division 3. [8]

In 2017, Winchmore Hill CC were champions of Middlesex County Cricket League Division 3 and promoted to the Middlesex County Cricket League Division 2. This was secured with four games to spare. [9]

The club boasts 3 cricket pitches with electronic scoreboards, high quality nets and a multi-use games area (MUGA). The club's first team pitch has consistently been ranked as one of the best pitches in the league.[10]

Winchmore Hill CC has a longstanding link with Kensington Cricket Club in Adelaide, and many of the club's overseas players have played for both clubs.
