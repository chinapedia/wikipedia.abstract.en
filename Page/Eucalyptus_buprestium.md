Description

_Eucalyptus buprestium_ is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth greenish brown and cream-coloured bark that ages to grey and is shed in ribbons. Young plants have dull green, elliptic, sessile leaves arranged in opposite pairs, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, greyish green, narrow lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of between nine and fifteen on a peduncle long, the individual flowers on a pedicel long. The mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum sometimes with a small point on the end. Flowering occurs from September to December, sometimes as late as April and the flowers are white. November and April producing white flowers. The fruit is a woody, almost spherical capsule long and wide, with a small opening enclosing the valves.[3][4][5]


Taxonomy

_Eucalyptus buprestium_ was first formally described by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1862 and the description was published in his book _Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae_.[6][7] The specific epithet (_buprestium_) alludes to the beetle genus _Bupestris_, "referring to the attraction the mallees had for some beetles".[8]

The species is part of the _Eucalyptus_ subgenus series _Diversiformae_, a group of mallees that all have adult leaves held erect, buds with a single unscarred operculum and pyramidal seeds. The other species in this series include _E. erectifolia_, _E. platydisca_, _E.diversifolia_, _E. todtiana_, _E. lateritica_, _E. dolorosa_ and _E. pachyloma_.[9][10]


Distribution

Apple mallee is found on coastal and near-coastal sandplains and ridge tops along the south coast in the Great Southern region of Western Australia between Albany in the west, Mount Barker in the north and Jerramungup in the east where it grows in gravelly sandy-clay soils.[11][12][13]
