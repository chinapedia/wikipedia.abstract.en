The bank is a parastatal under the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment tasked with providing financial assistance for the establishment of large, medium and small projects as well as the expansion, diversification and modernisation of existing enterprises; and rehabilitation of existing ones. In line with the Nigeria Industrial Revolution Plan and Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) released by the Government of Nigeria, the bank focuses on financing industrial projects in key sectors of the economy such as: AGRO AND FOOD PROCESSING, LIGHT MANUFACTURING, GAS AND PETROCHEMICALS, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, SOLID MINERALS and CREATIVE INDUSTRIES (arts and entertainment). BOI also focuses on promoting youth entrepreneurship, women-owned businesses and renewable energy projects.


History

Bank of Industry Limited began operations in 1959 as the Investment Corporation of Nigeria (ICON) Limited. In 1964, ICON Limited was reconstituted to become the Nigerian Industrial Development Bank (NIDB) Limited under the guidance of the World Bank. Initially, International Finance Corporation (IFC) held 75% equity in NIDB and produced the first Managing Director. However, the equity structure was diluted in 1976 as a result of the indigenization decree.[1]

In 2001, the BOI was reconstructed out of the merger of the Nigerian Industrial Development Bank (NIDB), Nigerian Bank for Commerce and Industry (NBCI) and the National Economic Reconstruction Fund (NERFUND). Although the bank's share capital was initially set at ₦50 billion in the wake of NIDB's reconstruction, it was increased to ₦250 billion in 2007.[2] The purpose was to better position BOI in addressing Nigeria's rising economic profile in line with its mandate to provide financial assistance for the establishments of new enterprises, the expansion, diversification and modernisation of existing enterprises, and the rehabilitation of ailing industries.

Over the years, the bank has undergone several transformations and re-engineered its processes to improve service delivery. In 2014, the bank commenced the use of Business Development Service Providers (BDSPs) in order to improve the quality of entrepreneurs and loan applications. The BDSPs are expected to assist MSMEs with structuring their business plans and business models and provide relevant capacity building and training programmes.[3] The bank is also collaborating with the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) and Department for International Development (DFID) to create an institute to accredit BDSPs in Nigeria.

In 2015, the Bank of Industry, alongside The Tony Elumelu Foundation, was awarded the Creative Entrepreneurs Association of Nigeria (CEAN) Creative Industry Award for the 'Highest Support for the Nigerian Creative Industry'.[4]

The bank has played an active role in advocating for stable and reliable energy solutions in Nigeria. In 2011 the bank partnered with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This partnership then led to the development of the BOI-UNDP Solar Energy Programme (SEP), an intervention programme that promotes and supports the expansion of renewable energy services in off-grid rural communities. For its role in the deployment of electrification projects, the bank was presented with the 'Outstanding Sustainable Project Financing' award at the 2017 Karlsruhe Sustainable Finance Awards in Karlsruhe, Germany.[5]

In 2017, the bank was awarded the ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System (QMS) certification by DQS Holding GmbH after successfully completing the ISO 9001:2015 QMS certification programme.[6]


Operations

The bank has been rated among the highest financial institutions in Nigeria with long term national ratings by Moody's (Aa3)[7], Fitch (AA+)[8] and Agusto & Co. (Aa)[9].

In driving economic growth, BOI has continuously focused on improving the access to finance available to SMEs. As such, the bank has several products to support MSME clusters. Some of these include:

-   NollyFund - geared towards the development of the local film industry;
-   Fashion and Beauty Product - set up to support enterprises engaged in Adire (Tie & Dye) and Aso-Oke, clothing design and production, fashion/beauty training institutes, leatherworks (shoes, bags, belts), beauty salons and more;
-   Arts and Craft Product - introduced to support enterprises involved in pottery, brass works, wood designs, fibre crafts, painting etc.

BOI also serves as a key vehicle in managing and disbursing funds meant for intervention in certain sectors. In the past, the bank managed the ₦10 billion Rice Intervention Fund, ₦18 billion National Automotive Council (NAC) Fund, ₦9.6 billion Cement Fund, ₦4.3 billion Cassava Bread Fund and ₦18 billion Rice and Cassava Fund.

The bank has been instrumental in administering the ₦300 billion Power and Aviation Intervention Fund and ₦50 billion Cotton, Textile and Garments Intervention Fund from the CBN, $200 million Nigerian Content Intervention fund (NCI Fund), ₦2.5 billion Nigerian Artisanal and Small-Scale Miners (ASM) Finance Support Fund amongst other funds. BOI also manages and disburses the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Program (GEEP), one of a number of social intervention programmes introduced by the Federal Government of Nigeria. GEEP (also known as MarketMoni) is a ₦140 billion fund aimed at supporting individuals in the informal sector with loans at zero percent interest rate. Through the fund, BOI supports trade cooperatives, women cooperatives, micro-enterprises and trade associations with loans ranging from ₦10,000 to ₦50,000.[10]

Among several initiatives, the bank is widely renowned for giving regular loans to small businesses in Nigeria. The regular loans are given to enterprises or companies that are duly registered with CAC. While the loans are only given to businesses with proven success, exceptions are made for startups with a sound management team that can provide proof of experience in its intended business area. The minimum amount given is ₦5 million and a maximum of ₦500 million. There are several requirement to access each loan depending on amount applied for, the BOI does not give the loans directly to applicants, they give it to the vendors and suppliers of the equipment that the loan application is for. [11]

As part of efforts to expand financing opportunities, BOI began partnerships with several state governments under a matching fund scheme. The MSME matching fund is a 50:50 counterpart funding scheme with State Governments to administer the fund for the establishment of micro, small or medium scale businesses in participating states.[12]


Strategic Partnerships

Collaboration with Nigeria Content Development Management Board

In August 2017, Nigeria Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) launched a $200 million Nigerian Content Intervention Fund (NCI Fund) to be used for developing capacity in the oil and gas industry. The fund was set up to finance projects, programmes and activities which directly increase Nigerian content in the oil and gas industry. The pool of funds will be managed by the BOI to meet the funding needs of indigenous manufacturers, service providers and other key players in the Nigerian Oil and gas Industry. The funds will be deployed towards providing support to indigenous players in the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry to procure fixed assets, refinance existing loans, fund working capital and finance contracts.[13]

Collaboration with Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel Development

In 2017, the Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel Development (FMMSD) set up a ₦2.5 billion Nigerian Artisanal and Small-Scale Miners (ASM) Finance Support Fund and designated BOI as the sole fund manager. The purpose of the ASM Fund is to address the funding requirements of artisanal and small-scale miners while promoting the development of solid minerals potentials of Nigeria. Through the scheme, artisanal miners can access up to ₦10 million while small-scale miners can access up to ₦100 million.[14]

BOI-UNDP Solar Energy Programme

In 2011, BOI and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) launched the Access to Renewable Energy Project. The project was set up to serve as an advocacy and awareness programme to promote and support the expansion of renewable energy services to support households and local enterprises in unserved and underserved communities. To achieve this, BOI and UNDP encouraged stakeholders in the renewable energy space to invest in the Nigerian sector. However, in 2015, the project was refocused to align with BOI's strategy to fund and implement renewable energy projects in collaboration with relevant stakeholders. As a result, the project was renamed to the Solar Energy Programme (SEP) to reflect the change in strategic direction.

The SEP commenced with a Rural Electrification Project which involved the provision of long term financing for the installation of low cost micro-grid and stand-alone solar energy solutions in nominated off-grid rural communities. Between 2015 and 2016, micro-grid and stand-alone solar energy solutions were installed in 6 off-grid rural communities in 6 Nigerian States: Niger State, Osun State, Gombe State, Anambra State, Edo State and Kaduna State.[15] Pre-paid metres, using Pay-As-You-Go models, were installed in each household and microenterprise to accommodate for flexibility of payment and to solve challenges of unpaid bills. The pilot phase was considered a success and also attracted several potential investors across Nigeria.

On the back of this success, BOI and UNDP entered into a cost-sharing agreement to fund the second phase of the project. In 2016, BOI provided $1.4 million debt financing while UNDP provided $600,000 grant to replicate the solar energy solutions in 11 additional off-grid communities across 4 Nigerian States: Niger State, Gombe State, Anambra State and Kaduna State.

In view of the benefits of the SEP, BOI introduced a ₦2 billion Solar Energy commercial product in 2017 to be accessed by various categories of end users both directly through BOI and indirectly.[16]

Through the Solar Energy Programme, the bank aims to power more than 100,000 off-grid households and microenterprises in rural and commercial communities by 2021.[17]

Collaboration with African Development Bank (AfDB) Group

In 2011, the Board of Directors of African Development Bank (AfDB) Group approved $500 million multi-tranche line of credit to assist BOI in financing local SMEs Nigeria. In 2015 and 2017, the bank received $100 million (in two tranches of $50 million each) to fund export-oriented SMEs with the capacity to generate foreign exchange.[18][19] The line of credit would be provided for funding projects aimed at systematic poverty reduction, employment generation and wealth creation through entrepreneurial, social and economic development.[20] As part of the agreement, AfDB required the bank provide technical assistance for capacity building for both BOI and SMEs. To this end, BOI enlisted international companies BDO/GBRW.[21]

Collaboration with Dangote Foundation

In 2011, Bank of Industry and Dangote Foundation entered into a partnership agreement to develop a ₦5 billion fund, with BOI and the Dangote Foundation committing ₦2.5 billion each. The fund will be available to enterprises focused on Agro-processing, Manufacturing and the trading of Made-in-Nigeria goods.[22]


Bottom of Pyramid (BOP) Scheme

Bank of Industry introduced the Bottom of Pyramid Scheme at the beginning of 2017 to provide credit delivery to under-served and under-banked micro-entrepreneurs in the society. The on-lending initiative leverages on the spread and penetration of microfinance banks as channels to stimulate activity among micro-entrepreneurs.[23] The bank proposed ₦5 billion under the first phase of the scheme and has disbursed over ₦3 billion through participating MicroFinance banks.[24] The scheme aligns with the Nigerian government's employment and wealth creation objectives of the National Enterprise Development Programme (NEDEP) and focuses on industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, food products, beverages, solid minerals, services and artisanal activities.[25]


Youth Empowerment Initiatives

Graduate Entrepreneurship Fund (GEF)

The purpose of GEF is to provide funding and capacity building to serving members of the NYSC. At the time of introduction, the interest rate on loans was 9%. However, in 2017, the interest rate was revised to 0% to ensure sustainability of youth businesses and to encourage more youth entrepreneurs under the NYSC scheme.[26]

The GEF scheme is available to serving NYSC members that have successfully passed the Bank's screening process, attended the capacity building programme developed specifically for the prospects under GEF and submitted a bankable business plan.
