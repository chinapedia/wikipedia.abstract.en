HARDEN CASTLE is a 16th century tower house, about west of Hawick, Scottish Borders.[1] It is alternatively known as Harden House or Harden Tower.[2]

The castle is situated strongly, above a deep ravine.[3]


History

The castle, which succeeds an earlier tower which was destroyed about 1590,[4] belonged to the Homes, but was purchased by the Scotts in 1501.[5]

Walter Scott of Harden, known as Auld Wat of Harden, was one of family. He was a Border Reiver, who married Mary, or Marion, Scott, known as ‘The Flower of Yarrow’, the events surrounding her being retold in the ballad The Dowie Dens o Yarrow.[6]

In the 18th century the family moved to Mertoun; the house was used as a farmhouse. It was restored and reoccupied during the 19th century.[7]

It became the seat of Lord Polwarth.[8]


Structure

The castle incorporates a three-storey tower house; it was extended between 1680 and 1690, with internal changes also,[9] and again when it was reoccupied.[10] The additions were added on the north; so they have not changed the appearance of the south front.[11]

The original block was (east to west) by ; the castle was extended east in the refurbishment of 1680.[12]

Internal features include plaster ceilings, and fireplaces.[13]

In the grounds there is a bowling green, possibly dating from the 17th century, to the west of the house. And there is a sundial, originally at Dryburgh House, high, with a square dial stone, a twisted shaft, and a moulded base.[14]

It is a category A listed building.[15]
