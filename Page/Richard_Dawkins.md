.[1] In the run up to the 2017 general election, Dawkins once again endorsed the Liberal Democrats and urged voters to join the party.

In 1998, Dawkins expressed his appreciation for two books connected with the Sokal affair, _Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science_ by Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt and _Intellectual Impostures_ by Sokal and Jean Bricmont. These books are famous for their criticism of postmodernism in US universities (namely in the departments of literary studies, anthropology, and other cultural studies).[2]

Dawkins has voiced his support for the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation that campaigns for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.[3]

Dawkins identifies as a feminist.[4] Dawkins has said that feminism is "enormously important" and "a political movement that deserves to be supported".[5]

Other fields

In his role as professor for public understanding of science, Dawkins has been a critic of pseudoscience and alternative medicine. His 1998 book _Unweaving the Rainbow_ considers John Keats's accusation that by explaining the rainbow, Isaac Newton diminished its beauty; Dawkins argues for the opposite conclusion. He suggests that deep space, the billions of years of life's evolution, and the microscopic workings of biology and heredity contain more beauty and wonder than do "myths" and "pseudoscience".[6] For John Diamond's posthumously published _Snake Oil_, a book devoted to debunking alternative medicine, Dawkins wrote a foreword in which he asserts that alternative medicine is harmful, if only because it distracts patients from more successful conventional treatments and gives people false hopes.[7] Dawkins states that "There is no alternative medicine. There is only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't work." In his 2007 Channel 4 TV film _The Enemies of Reason_, Dawkins concluded that Britain is gripped by "an epidemic of superstitious thinking".[8]

Continuing a long-standing partnership with Channel 4, Dawkins participated in a five-part television series, _Genius of Britain_, along with fellow scientists Stephen Hawking, James Dyson, Paul Nurse, and Jim Al-Khalili. The series was first broadcast in June 2010, and focuses on major, British, scientific achievements throughout history.[9]

In 2014 he joined the global awareness movement Asteroid Day as a "100x Signatory".[10]

Dawkins worked alongside Welsh Musician Jayce Lewis contributing a recorded spoken word for the track 'Exhale' from his 1998 book _Unweaving the Rainbow_ to the Welshman's 3rd full-length album 'Million'.


Awards and recognition

in Frankfurt, 12 October 2007, from Karlheinz Deschner]]

Dawkins was awarded a Doctor of Science degree by the University of Oxford in 1989. He holds honorary doctorates in science from the University of Huddersfield, University of Westminster, Durham University,[11] the University of Hull, the University of Antwerp, the University of Oslo, the University of Aberdeen,[12] Open University, the Vrije Universiteit Brussel,[13] and the University of Valencia.[14] He also holds honorary doctorates of letters from the University of St Andrews and the Australian National University (HonLittD, 1996), and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1997 and a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2001.[15][16] He is one of the patrons of the Oxford University Scientific Society.

In 1987, Dawkins received a Royal Society of Literature award and a _Los Angeles Times_ Literary Prize for his book _The Blind Watchmaker_. In the same year, he received a Sci. Tech Prize for Best Television Documentary Science Programme of the Year for his work on the BBC's _Horizon_ episode _The Blind Watchmaker_.[17]

Other awards include the Zoological Society of London's Silver Medal (1989), the Finlay Innovation Award (1990), the Michael Faraday Award (1990), the Nakayama Prize (1994), the American Humanist Association's Humanist of the Year Award (1996), the fifth International Cosmos Prize (1997), the Kistler Prize (2001), the Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Republic (2001), the 2001 and 2012 Emperor Has No Clothes Award from the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the Bicentennial Kelvin Medal of The Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow (2002),[18] and the Nierenberg Prize for Science in the Public Interest (2009).[19] He was awarded the Deschner Award, named after German anti-clerical author Karlheinz Deschner.[20] The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSICOP) has awarded Dawkins their highest award _In Praise of Reason_ (1992).[21]

Dawkins topped _Prospect_ magazine's 2004 list of the top 100 public British intellectuals, as decided by the readers, receiving twice as many votes as the runner-up.[22][23] He was shortlisted as a candidate in their 2008 follow-up poll.[24] In a poll held by _Prospect_ in 2013, Dawkins was voted the world's top thinker based on 65 names chosen by a largely US and UK-based expert panel.[25]

In 2005, the Hamburg-based Alfred Toepfer Foundation awarded him its Shakespeare Prize in recognition of his "concise and accessible presentation of scientific knowledge". He won the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science for 2006, as well as the Galaxy British Book Awards's Author of the Year Award for 2007.[26] In the same year, he was listed by _Time_ magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2007,[27] and was ranked 20th in _The Daily Telegraph_'s 2007 list of 100 greatest living geniuses.[28]

Since 2003, the Atheist Alliance International has awarded a prize during its annual conference, honouring an outstanding atheist whose work has done the most to raise public awareness of atheism during that year; it is known as the Richard Dawkins Award, in honour of Dawkins's own efforts.[29] In February 2010, Dawkins was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Honorary Board of distinguished achievers.[30]

In 2012, ichthyologists in Sri Lanka honored Dawkins by creating _Dawkinsia_ as a new genus name (members of this genus were formerly members of the genus _Puntius_). Explaining the reasoning behind the genus name, lead researcher Rohan Pethiyagoda was quoted as stating, "Richard Dawkins has, through his writings, helped us understand that the universe is far more beautiful and awe-inspiring than any religion has imagined [...]. We hope that _Dawkinsia_ will serve as a reminder of the elegance and simplicity of evolution, the only rational explanation there is for the unimaginable diversity of life on Earth.[31]


Personal life

Dawkins has been married three times, and has one daughter. On 19 August 1967, Dawkins married fellow ethologist Marian Stamp in the Protestant church in Annestown, County Waterford, Ireland;[32] they divorced in 1984. On 1 June 1984, he married Eve Barham (1951–1999) in Oxford. They had a daughter, Juliet Emma Dawkins (born 1984, Oxford). Dawkins and Barham divorced.[33] In 1992, he married actress Lalla Ward[34] in Kensington and Chelsea, London. Dawkins met her through their mutual friend Douglas Adams,[35] who had worked with her on the BBC's _Doctor Who_. Dawkins and Ward separated in 2016 and they later described the separation as "entirely amicable".[36]

On 6 February 2016, Dawkins suffered a minor hemorrhagic stroke while at home.[37][38] Dawkins reported later that same year that he had almost completely recovered.[39][40]

Other appearances

Dawkins has made many television appearances on news shows providing his political opinions and especially his views as an atheist. He has been interviewed on the radio, often as part of his book tours. He has debated many religious figures. He has made many university speaking appearances, again often in coordination with his book tours. As of 2016, he has over 60 credits in the Internet Movie Database where he appeared as himself.

-   _Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed_ (2008) – as himself, presented as a leading scientific opponent of intelligent design in a film that contends that the mainstream science establishment suppresses academics who believe they see evidence of intelligent design in nature and who criticise evidence supporting Darwinian evolution
-   _Doctor Who_: "The Stolen Earth" (2008) – as himself
-   _The Simpsons_: "Black Eyed, Please" (2013) – appears in Ned Flanders' dream of Hell; provided voice as a demon version of himself[43]
-   _Endless Forms Most Beautiful_ (2015) – by Nightwish: Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish had Dawkins as a guest star on the album.[44][45][46] He provides narration on two tracks: "Shudder Before the Beautiful", in which he opens the album with one of his own quotes, and "The Greatest Show on Earth", inspired by and named after his book _The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution_, and in which he quotes _On the Origin of Species_ by Charles Darwin.[47][48] He subsequently performed his parts live with Nightwish on 19 December 2015 at the Wembley Arena in London; the concert was later released as a part of a live album/DVD titled _Vehicle of Spirit_.


Notes

A. W. D. Hamilton influenced Dawkins and the influence can be seen throughout Dawkins's book _The Selfish Gene_.[49] They became friends at Oxford and following Hamilton's death in 2000, Dawkins wrote his obituary and organised a secular memorial service.[50]

B. The debate ended with the motion "That the doctrine of creation is more valid than the theory of evolution" being defeated by 198 votes to 115.[51][52]
