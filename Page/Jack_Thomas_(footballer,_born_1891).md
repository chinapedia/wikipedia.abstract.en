JOHN WILLIAM THOMAS (1891 – after 1911) was an English professional football inside right who played in the Football League for Newcastle United.[1]


Personal life

Thomas worked as a miner.[2] After the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, he enlisted in the Durham Light Infantry.[3] Thomas was taken prisoner during the Second Battle of Ypres, in 1915 and was sent to Germany, where he was incarcerated with French prisoners and learnt the language.[4] He eventually escaped with four other French prisoners and by using a compass which had been hidden in a cake sent from home, he made it to the neutral Netherlands.[5] Upon his return to Britain, Thomas was interrogated as a possible German spy, but was then sent back to France to work in counter-espionage, by posing as a French dock worker.[6]
