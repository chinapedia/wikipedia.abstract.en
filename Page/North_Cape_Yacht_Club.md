The NORTH CAPE YACHT CLUB is a private yacht club located in La Salle Township, Michigan, on the shore of Western Lake Erie.[1]


History

North Cape Yacht Club was founded in 1962 after several members of the Toledo Yacht Club, frustrated because of the too long trek from Maumee Bay to the racing venue for their Dragons in the open waters of Lake Erie, found a new location where the Dragon fleet could be moored closer to deep-water sailing. The new site was a lakefront property near the mouth of South Otter Creek that was then a duck marsh and the remnants of the old Toledo Beach Amusement Park. The initial lease was signed December 14, 1961, and the club formed. In 1971, the club purchased the previously leased site for $125,000 with the proceeds of bonds sold to its members. Significant expansions of the clubhouse occurred in 1974 and 1984.[2]
