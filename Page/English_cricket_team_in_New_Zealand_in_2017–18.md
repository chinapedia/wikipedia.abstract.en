The England cricket team toured New Zealand between February and April 2018 to play two Test and five One Day International (ODI) matches.[1][2][3] Fixtures in round 7 of New Zealand's 2016–17 Plunket Shield season were played as day/night matches, in preparation for a day/night Test match, which took place at Eden Park.[4][5] In August 2017, New Zealand Cricket confirmed that the Test at Eden Park would be played as a day/night game.[6] In September 2017, the second ODI fixture was moved from McLean Park, Napier to the Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui, after issues in re-turfing the ground.[7]

England won the ODI series 3–2.[8] New Zealand won the Test series 1–0, after the second match ended in a draw.[9] It was New Zealand's first series win against England since August 1999 and their first at home since March 1984.[10]
