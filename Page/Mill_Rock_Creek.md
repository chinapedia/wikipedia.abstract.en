MILL ROCK CREEK is a stream in Crawford and Iron counties in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] It is a tributary of Huzzah Creek.

The stream headwaters arise in the northwest corner of Iron County just north of Viburnum (at ) and the stream flows northwest to its confluence with Huzzah Creek in Crawford County (at ).[2][3] Possum Trot Creek enters the Huzzah just upstream from Mill Rock Creek.[4]

Mill Rock Creek was named for the fact the watercourse was the source of millstones.[5]
