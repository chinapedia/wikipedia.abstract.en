MONKEY CHANTING or MONKEY CHANTS are racist chants and calls targeting black sportsmen. The chants imitate "monkey" or "ape" noises. They may be accompanied with "monkey gestures", an imitation scratching the armpits "in a monkey way".[1] The chants are hinting to the ethnic slurs "macaca" and "monkey" against black Africans.

Monkey chants may also be accompanied with throwing "monkey food" (peanuts, bananas, or banana skins) at the sportsman or the sports field.[2][3]

A number of incidents of this kind have been noted by media as manifestations of racism in association football.
