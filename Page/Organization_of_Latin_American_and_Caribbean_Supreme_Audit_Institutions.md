The ORGANIZATION OF LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN SUPREME AUDIT INSTITUTIONS (OLACEFS) is an international, autonomous, independent, apolitical and permanent organization.[1] Its origins can be traced back to the First Congress of Latin American Supreme Audit Institutions - CLADEFS - held in 1963 in Caracas, Venezuela, in response to the need for a forum for exchanging ideas and experiences relating to government control, and for promoting cooperation and development between supreme audit institutions. At the Congress it was recommended that a Latin American Institute of Fiscal Control be created to carry out specialized research and serve as a center for information, education, coordination and mutual assistance between audit institutions.

Currently OLACEFS is one of INTOSAI’s seven regional working groups.[2]


Origins: Latin American Institute for Auditing Sciences - ILACIF

At the First Latin American Congress of Supreme Audit Institutions in 1963, it was concluded that it would be of mutual advantage for Latin American countries to exchange experiences concerning financial management and oversight, and that by adopting the principles and objectives of regional integration and unity within the scope of their specific activities, governmental management would be improved and in turn communities better served. Convinced of the importance for Latin America - and especially for its respective auditing agencies - of having a Latin American audit institute, participants of the Congress appointed the Chilean delegation to undertake the necessary steps to make this a reality as soon as possible.

It was at the Second Latin American Congress of Supreme Audit Institutions, held on April 9, 1965 in Santiago de Chile, that the Office of the Comptroller General of Chile submitted a draft charter along with a study carried out by the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic of Venezuela. Those Supreme Audit Institutions attending the congress agreed on the creation of the Latin American Institute of Auditing Sciences - ILACIF - and approved its charter.[3] The objective behind the creation of the Institute was to promote specialized scientific research, gather information and provide advice and coordination amongst the continent's regulatory agencies so they could better serve their citizens in the exercise of the powers granted to them by the respective legal systems. The following were signatories to the creation of ILACIF: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Uruguay and Venezuela. Later, the following countries would join: Peru, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay, Antilles and Surinam. The Congress also saw the Office of the Comptroller General of Venezuela designated headquarters of the Institute.


New Institution: Organization of Latin American and Caribbean Supreme Audit Institutions – OLACEFS

Changes to internal rules and organizational structure were recommended by a reforming committee, and at the special session of October 11, 1990, ILACIF's Extraordinary General Assembly, held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, approved the proposed amendments as well as changing the name of the institute to the Organization of Latin American and Caribbean Supreme Audit Institutions (OLACEFS).[4] The term Organization was considered more appropriate for an entity that brought together the highest officials in the field of control and monitoring in Latin America and the Caribbean.

OLACEFS currently undertakes specialized scientific research and carries out activities relating to research, training, specialization, advising and technical assistance. It coordinates and provides the Supreme Audit Institutions, or SAIs, of Latin America and the Caribbean with information, the aim of all the above being to promote their development and improvement.
