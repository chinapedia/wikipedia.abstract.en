JOSEPH LEVITCH (March 16, 1926 – August 20, 2017), better known by his stage name JERRY LEWIS, was an American comedian, actor, singer, filmmaker and humanitarian. Dubbed "The King of Comedy" and "The Total Filmmaker" for eight decades, Lewis appeared in more than 60 film and television productions, performed his comedy routines at nightclubs and concerts and ventured into behind-the-scenes work, as a director, producer and screenwriter following a union between his company, Jerry Lewis Productions and Paramount Pictures. Lewis released several albums as a singer, selling millions of records and throughout his career, he sought to raise awareness for muscular dystrophy, serving as national chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy Association from 1956 until 2011.


Early life and beginnings

Lewis was born on March 16, 1926 in Newark, New Jersey, to Daniel "Danny" Levitch (1902 – 1980), a master of ceremonies and vaudevillian, who performed under the stage name Danny Lewis, from New York whose parents immigrated to the United States from the Russian Empire, and Rachael "Rae" Levitch (née Brodsky; 1903 – 1983), a WOR pianist and Danny's music director from Warsaw.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] Reports as to his birth name are conflicting; in Lewis' 1982 autobiography, he claimed his birth name was Joseph, after his maternal grandfather, but his birth certificate,[10][11] the 1930 U. S. Census, and the 1940 U. S. Census all name him as Jerome.[12][13][14][15]

Lewis said that he ceased using the names Joseph and Joey as an adult to avoid being confused with Joe E. Lewis and Joe Louis.[16] Reports as to the hospital in which he was born conflict as well, with biographer Shawn Levy claiming he was born at Clinton Private Hospital and others claiming Newark Beth Israel Hospital.[17][18][19][20] Other claims of his early life also conflict with accounts made by family members, burial records, and vital records.

He was a "character" even in his teenage years, pulling pranks in his neighborhood including sneaking into kitchens to steal fried chicken and pies. He dropped out of Irvington High School in the tenth grade. By age 15, he had developed his "Record Act" miming lyrics to songs while a phonograph played offstage. He landed a gig at a burlesque house in Buffalo, but his performance fell flat and was unable to book any more shows. Lewis worked as a soda jerk and a theater usher for Suzanne Pleshette's father Gene at the Paramount Theater[21][22][23][24][25] to make ends meet.

A veteran burlesque comedian, Max Coleman, who had worked with Lewis' father years before, persuaded him to try again. Irving Kaye,[26][27][28][29] a Borscht Belt comedian, saw Lewis' mime act at Brown's Hotel in Loch Sheldrake, New York, the following summer, and the audience was so enthusiastic that Kaye became Lewis' manager and guardian for Borscht Belt appearances.[30] During World War II, he was rejected for military service because of a heart murmur.[31]


Career

Performing with Dean Martin

Lewis_and_Martin.jpg in 1950]] Lewis initially gained attention as part of a double act with singer Dean Martin, who served as straight man to Lewis' zany antics as the Martin and Lewis comedy team. They were different from other duo acts of the time because they played to each other and had ad-libbed improvisational segments within their planned routines.

After forming in 1946, they quickly rose to national prominence, first with their popular nightclub act, then as stars of _The Martin and Lewis Show_ on the radio NBC Red Network.[32] The two made appearances on early live television on their June 20, 1948 debut broadcast on _Toast of the Town_ (later renamed as _The Ed Sullivan Show_ on September 25, 1955) on CBS.[33] This was followed by a guest stint on _The Milton Berle Show_, then their appearance on NBC's _Welcome Aboard_ on October 3, 1948.

In 1950, Martin and Lewis signed with NBC to be one of a series of weekly rotating hosts of _The Colgate Comedy Hour_, a live Sunday evening broadcast. Lewis, writer for the team's nightclub act, hired Norman Lear and Ed Simmons as regular writers for their _Comedy Hour_ material.[34][35] Their _Comedy Hour_ shows consisted of stand-up dialogue, song and dance from their nightclub act and movies, backed by Dick Stabile's big band, slapstick and satirical sketch comedy, Martin's solo songs, and Lewis' solo pantomimes or physical numbers.

Martin and Lewis often broke character, ad-libbing and breaking the fourth wall. While not completely capturing the orchestrated mayhem of their nightclub act, the _Comedy Hour_ displayed charismatic energy between the team and established their popularity nationwide. By 1951, with an appearance at the Paramount Theater, they were a cultural phenomenon, attracting crowds rivaled only by Frank Sinatra earlier and later by Elvis Presley and The Beatles. The duo began their film careers at Paramount Pictures as ensemble players, first in _My Friend Irma_ (1949), based on the radio series of the same name, and then its sequel _My Friend Irma Goes West_ (1950).

Soon after, Martin and Lewis starred in their own vehicles in 14 more movies, _At War with the Army_ (1950), _That's My Boy_ (1951), _Sailor Beware_ (1952), _Jumping Jacks_ (1952), _The Stooge_ (1952), _Scared Stiff_ (1953), _The Caddy_ (1953), _Money from Home_ (1953), _Living It Up_ (1954), _3 Ring Circus_ (1954), _You're Never Too Young_ (1955), _Artists and Models_ (1955), _Pardners_ (1956) and _Hollywood or Bust_ (1956). All 16 films were produced by Hal B. Wallis.

They also starred as cameos in Bing Crosby and Bob Hope's film _Road to Bali_ (1952). Hope and Crosby would do the same in Lewis and Martin's _Scared Stiff_ a year later. Attesting to the duo's popularity, DC Comics published _The Adventures of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis_ from 1952 to 1957. In 1954, the team appeared on episode 191 of _What's My Line?_ as mystery guests, appeared on the 27th annual Academy Awards in 1955 and then appeared on _The Steve Allen Show_ and _The Today Show_ in 1956.

The Martin and Lewis films were reliable financial successes for Paramount, and hugely popular with audiences. In later years, both Lewis and Martin admitted frustration, and were critical of Wallis for his formulaic and trite film choices, restricting them to narrow, repetitive roles. As Martin's roles in their films became less important over time, Lewis receiving the majority of critical acclaim, the partnership came under strain.

Martin's participation became an embarrassment in 1954 when _Look_ magazine published a publicity photo of the team for the magazine cover but cropped Martin out.[36] The partnership ended with their final nightclub act on July 24, 1956 (the team's 10th anniversary of their debut as a duo). Both Martin and Lewis went on to highly successful solo careers, and neither would comment on the split nor consider a reunion. However, they would occasionally be seen at the same public events.

Going solo

Late 1950s

After his partnership with Martin ended in 1956, Lewis and his wife Patty took a vacation in Las Vegas to consider the direction of his career. He felt his life was in a crisis state: "I was unable to put one foot in front of the other with any confidence. I was completely unnerved to be alone".[37] While there, he received an urgent request from his friend Sid Luft, who was Judy Garland's husband and manager, saying that she couldn't perform that night in Las Vegas because of strep throat,[38] and asking Lewis to fill in.

Lewis had not sung alone on stage since he was five years old, twenty-five years before, but he appeared before the audience of a thousand nonetheless, delivering jokes and clowning with the audience while Garland sat off-stage, watching. He then sang a rendition of a song he'd learned as a child, "Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody" along with "Come Rain or Come Shine." Lewis recalled, "When I was done, the place exploded. I walked off the stage knowing I could make it on my own".[39]

At his wife's pleading, Lewis used his own money to record the songs on a single.[40] Record company Decca Records heard it, liked it and insisted he record an album for them.[41] The single of _Rock-a-Bye Your Baby_ went to #10 and the album _Jerry Lewis Just Sings_ went to #3 on the _Billboard_ charts, staying near the top for four months and selling a million and a half copies.[42][43]

With the success of that album he recorded the additional albums _More Jerry Lewis_ (an EP of songs from this release was released as _Somebody Loves Me_), and _Jerry Lewis Sings Big Songs For Little People_ (later reissued with fewer tracks as _Jerry Lewis Sings For Children_). Non-album singles were released, and _It All Depends On You_, hit the charts in April and May 1957, but peaked at only #68. Further singles were recorded and released by Lewis into the mid-1960s.

But these were not Lewis's first foray into recording, nor his first appearance on the hit charts. During his partnership with Martin, they made several recordings together, charting at #22 in 1948 with the 1920s chestnut _That Certain Party_ and later mostly re-recording songs highlighted in their films. Also during the time of their partnership, but without Martin, he recorded numerous novelty-comedy numbers for adults as well as records specifically intended for the children's market.

Having proven he could sing and do live shows, he began performing regularly at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, beginning in late 1956, which marked a turning point in his life and career. The Sands signed him for five years, to perform six weeks each year and paid him the same amount they had paid Martin and Lewis as a team.[44] The critics gave him positive reviews: "Jerry was wonderful. He has proved that he can be a success by himself," wrote one.[45] He continued with club performances in Miami, New York, Chicago and Washington.

Such live performances became a staple of his career and over the years he performed at casinos, theaters and state fairs coast-to-coast. In February 1957, he followed Garland at the Palace Theater in New York and Martin called on the phone during this period to wish him the best of luck.[46] "I've never been happier," said Lewis. "I have peace of mind for the first time."[47] Lewis established himself as a solo act on TV starting with the first of six appearances on _What's My Line?_ from 1956 to 1966.

He guest appeared on both _Tonight Starring Jack Paar_ and _The Ed Sullivan Show_ and beginning in January 1957, in a number of solo TV specials for NBC. He starred in his adaptation of "The Jazz Singer" for _Startime_. Lewis hosted the Academy Awards three times, in 1956, 1957 and the 31st Academy Awards in 1959, which ran twenty minutes short, forcing Lewis to improvise to fill time.[48] DC Comics, switching from Martin and Lewis, published a new comic book series titled _The Adventures of Jerry Lewis_, running from 1957 to 1971.

Lewis remained at Paramount and became a comedy star in his own right and his first solo movie was _The Delicate Delinquent_ (1957), marking Lewis' debut as film producer and screenwriter. It originally had been planned as the next Martin and Lewis film. He and Martin had made two films with director Frank Tashlin, whose background as a _Looney Tunes_ cartoon director suited Lewis' brand of humor. After starring in _The Sad Sack_ (1957), Lewis made more films with Tashlin starting with _Rock-A-Bye Baby_ (1958) and _The Geisha Boy_ (1958).

On two occasions after the break up, Martin invited Lewis on stage, in 1958 and 1961, but the split was too serious for the pair to reconcile. Lewis starred in _Don't Give Up The Ship_ (1959) and _Li'l Abner_ (1959). After his contract with Wallis ended, Lewis had several movies under his belt and was eager to flex his creative muscle. He was free to deepen his comedy with pathos, believing, "Funny without pathos is a pie in the face. And a pie in the face is funny, but I wanted more." In 1959, a contract between Paramount and Jerry Lewis Productions was signed specifying a payment of $10 million plus 60% of the profits for 14 films over seven years.[49]

This contract made Lewis the highest paid individual Hollywood talent to date and was unprecedented in that he had unlimited creative control, including final cut and the return of film rights after 30 years. Lewis' clout and box office were so strong (his films had already earned Paramount $100 million in rentals[50]) that Barney Balaban, head of production at Paramount at that time, told the press, "If Jerry wants to burn down the studio I'll give him the match!"[51]

1960s and emergence as director

Jerry_Lewis_1973.JPG He had finished his film contract with Wallis with _Visit to a Small Planet_ (1960) and wrapped up production on his own film _Cinderfella_ (1960), directed by Tashlin. The movie was postponed for a Christmas 1960 release. Paramount Pictures, needing a quickie motion picture for its summer 1960 schedule, held Lewis to his contract to produce one.[52] As a result, he made his debut as film director of and starred in _The Bellboy_ (1960).

Using the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami as his setting — on a small budget, with a very tight shooting schedule — Lewis shot the film during the day and performed at the hotel in the evenings.[53] Bill Richmond collaborated with him on many of the sight gags. Lewis later revealed that Paramount was not happy about financing a "silent movie" and withdrew backing. Lewis used his own funds to cover the movie's $950,000 budget.

Lewis followed "_The Bellboy_" by directing several more movies he co-wrote with Richmond, including _The Ladies Man_ (1961), where Lewis constructed a three-story dollhouse-like set spanning two sound stages. The set was equipped with state of the art lighting and sound, eliminating the need for boom mics in each room.

His next feature _The Errand Boy_ (1961), was one of the earliest films about moviemaking, utilizing all of Paramount's backlot and offices. Lewis then starred in his first special in three years _The Wacky World of Jerry Lewis_. He appeared in an episode of _Celebrity Golf_ followed by a guest spot on an episode of _The Garry Moore Show_. He then starred in Tashlin's _It's Only Money_ (1962).

Lewis took on as guest host on _The Tonight Show_ during the transition from Jack Paar to Johnny Carson in 1962. His appearance on the show scored the highest ratings thus far in late night, surpassing other guest hosts and Paar. The three major networks began a bidding war, wooing Lewis for his own talk show, which debuted the following year. Lewis then directed, co-wrote and starred in the smash hit _The Nutty Professor_ (1963).

A parody of _Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_, it featured him as a socially awkward professor inventing a serum that turns him into a handsome but obnoxious ladies man. It is largely considered to be Lewis' finest and most memorable film and in 2004, it was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". Lewis then appeared in a cameo role in Stanley Kramer's comedy epic _It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World_ (1963).

He starred next in Tashlin's _Who's Minding the Store?_ (1963) and then hosted _The Jerry Lewis Show_, a 13-week lavish, big-budget show for ABC, that aired from September to December in 1963. The show suffered in the ratings, beleaguered by technical and other difficulties, including the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, which left the country in a somber mood. Lewis co-wrote and starred in _The Patsy_ (1964), his satire about the Hollywood star-making industry.

His last film collaboration with Tashlin was _The Disorderly Orderly_ (1964), in which Lewis served as executive producer of. After that, Lewis then directed, co-wrote and appeared in _The Family Jewels_ (1965) about a young heiress who must choose among six uncles, one of whom is up to no good and out to harm the girl's beloved bodyguard who practically raised her. Lewis played all six uncles and the bodyguard.[54] This Diamond Ring, a song sung by Lewis' son Gary Lewis and his band was featured in the film.

In 1965, Lewis was interviewed on _The David Susskind Show_. Lewis' last film for Paramount _Boeing Boeing_ (1965), co-starred him while Tony Curtis was the movie's lead and is based on the French stage play.[55] He received a Golden Globe nomination for this role. Lewis directed and appeared on an episode of _Ben Casey_, an early dramatic role. He also appeared on _The Andy Williams Show_, and _Hullabaloo_ with his son Gary Lewis. In 1966, Paramount changed ownership and the new executives declined to renew Lewis' 1959 profit sharing contract and after 16 years, Lewis left Paramount.

Lewis went on to make and star in _Three on a Couch_ (1966) for Columbia Pictures. He appeared on _The Merv Griffin Show_ alongside Richard Pryor. Lewis starred in _Way...Way Out_ (1966), appeared on _The Sammy Davis Jr. Show_, then had cameos in _Batman_, _Laugh In_, was a panelist on _Password_ and in a pilot for _Sheriff Who_. Lewis returned with a new version of _The Jerry Lewis Show_, this time as a one-hour variety show for NBC, which ran from 1967 to 1969.[56] He would next direct and star in _The Big Mouth_ (1967) and starred on _Run For Your Life_.

Lewis made an appearance on _The Danny Thomas Hour_, starred in the Jerry Paris film _Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River_ (1968) and then appear as a guest on _Playboy After Dark_, surprising friend Sammy Davis Jr. in 1968. Lewis went on to star in and produce _Hook, Line & Sinker_ (1969) and afterwards, guest starred in an episode of _Jimmy Durante Presents the Lennon Sisters Hour_.

1970s

Jerry_Lewis_show.jpg In 1970, Lewis guest appeared on _The Red Skelton Show_, then contributed to some scripts for Filmation's animated show _Will the Real Jerry Lewis Please Sit Down_. He later guest hosted _The Mike Douglas Show_ and then directed an episode of _The Bold Ones_. He made guest appearances on _The Hollywood Palace_, _The Engelbert Humperdinck Show_, _The Irv Kupcinet Show_, _The Linkletter Show_, _The Real Tom Kennedy Show_ and _A Christmas Night with the Stars_.

Lewis then directed and made his first offscreen voice performance as a bandleader in _One More Time_ (1970), a sequel to the 1968 film _Salt and Pepper_, at times turning stars Peter Lawford and Davis Jr. into something of an erstwhile faux Martin and Lewis. His next film was _Which Way to the Front?_ (1970) and then guest star on _The Carol Burnett Show_, _The Rolf Harris Show_ and _The Kraft Music Hall_ in 1971.

Lewis then directed and starred in the partly unreleased _The Day the Clown Cried_ (1972), a drama set in a Nazi concentration camp. Lewis rarely discussed the film, but stated litigation over post-production finances and copyright prevented the film's completion and theatrical release. During his book tour for _Dean and Me_ he also said a factor for the film's burial was that he was not proud of the effort.

Lewis explained his reason for choosing the project and the emotional difficulty of the subject matter in an interview with an Australian documentary film crew.[57] A 31-minute version was shown on the German television station ARD, in the documentary Der Clown. It was later put on DVD and shown at Deutsches Filminstitute

Within historical context, the movie was the earliest attempt by an American motion picture director to address the subject of The Holocaust, preceding by thirteen years Claude Lanzmann's groundbreaking film _Shoah_,[58] and more than twenty years, Steven Spielberg's _Schindler's List_ and _Life is Beautiful_, dealing with similar themes. Significant speculation continues to surround the film. Following this, Lewis would take a break from the movie business for several years.

In 1973, Lewis was a guest on _The Dick Cavett Show_ and _NBC Follies_. He then appeared on _Celebrity Sportsman_ in 1974. Next, Lewis appeared as guest on both _Cher_ and _Dinah!_ in 1975. Lewis then guested on an episode of _Tony Orlando and Dawn_. In September 1976, Sinatra shocked Lewis by bringing Dean Martin on stage during the 11th annual _Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon_.

As Martin and Lewis embraced, the audience cheered and the phones lit up, resulting in one of the telethon's most profitable years. Lewis reported the event was one of the three most memorable of his life. Lewis quipped, "So, you working?", which he stated was a call-back to a remark he'd made to Martin when they first met. Martin, playing drunk, replied that he was "at the Meggum" (meaning the MGM Grand). The reunion made international headlines and is considered one of the most iconic moments in TV history.[59]

Less well known, Lewis returned the surprise the following year by walking onto the Aladdin stage in Las Vegas during Martin and Sinatra's performance. They exchanged jokes for several minutes.[60] Lewis then starred in a revival of _Hellzapoppin_ with co-star Lynn Redgrave, but closed on the road before reaching Broadway.[61] In 1979, he guest hosted as ringmaster of _Circus of the Stars_.

Later years

Jerry_Lewis_-_1981.jpg After 11 years of absence, Lewis returned to the big screen in _Hardly Working_ (1981), which he directed and starred in. Despite being panned by critics, it eventually earned $50 million. In 1982, Lewis was a guest on _Late Night with David Letterman_. In 1983, Lewis co-starred in Martin Scorsese's film _The King of Comedy_, as a late-night TV host, plagued by two obsessive fans, played by Robert De Niro and Sandra Bernhard. He received wide critical acclaim and a BAFTA nomination for this serious dramatic role.

Lewis guest hosted _Saturday Night Live_ and also starred in _Cracking Up_ a.k.a. _Smorgasbord_ (1983) and _Slapstick (Of Another Kind)_ (1984), then starred in two French films, _To Catch a Cop_ a.k.a. _The Defective Detective_ (1984) and _How Did You Get In? We Didn't See You Leave_ (1984), both of which had their distribution under Lewis' control; Lewis stated that they would never be released in American movie theaters and on home media.

He then hosted a syndicated talk show for Metromedia, which was not continued beyond the scheduled five shows. In 1985, Lewis directed an episode of the Showtime series _Brothers_. In 1986, Lewis appeared at the first Comic Relief, where he was the only performer to receive a standing ovation and after that, he was interviewed on _Classic Treasures_. Lewis also starred in the ABC televised movie _Fight For Life_ (1987).

In 1987, 31 years after his first double act with Martin, Lewis performed in Las Vegas with Davis Jr. That same year, he also learned of the death of Martin's son Dean Paul Martin and attended the funeral, which lead to a more substantial reconciliation with Martin. In 1988, Lewis hosted _America's All-Time Favorite Movies_, then was interviewed by Howard Cosell on _Speaking of Everything._ He then starred in five episodes of the CBS program _Wiseguy_.

The filming schedule of the show forced Lewis to miss the Museum of the Moving Image's opening with a retrospective of his work. In 1989, Lewis joined Martin on stage, for what would be Martin's final live performance, at Bally's Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Lewis wheeled out a cake on Martin's 72nd birthday, sang "Happy Birthday" to him and joked, "Why we broke up, I'll never know".[62] Again, their appearance together made headlines. He then appeared in _Cookie_ (1989).

Jerry_Lewis.jpg]] In 1991, Lewis guest starred in and directed an episode of the FOX series _Good Grief_. In 1992, Lewis had a cameo in _Mr. Saturday Night_ (1992), appeared as a guest on _The Arsenio Hall Show_, _The Whoopi Goldberg Show_ and _Inside The Comedy Mind_. Lewis did a three-part retrospective for The Disney Channel entitled _Martin & Lewis: Their Golden Age of Comedy_, using previously unseen kinescopes from his personal archive, highlighting his years as part of a team with Martin and as a soloist.

In 1993, he was the first of a series of 'classic' comedians to guest star in _Mad About You_, playing an eccentric billionaire. He appearanced on _Larry King Live_ many times and co-starred in the film _Arizona Dream_ (1993) as a car salesman uncle to as his nephew. Lewis then starred as the 'Comedy Legend' father of a young comic in _Funny Bones_ (1995).

Lewis' role serves as the metaphorical pivot in 20th Century comedy, from slapstick anarchists to clever storytellers.[63] Both _Arizona Dream_ and _Funny Bones_ were tongue-in-cheek roles for independent films. In 1995, realizing a lifelong ambition, Lewis made his Broadway debut, as a replacement cast member, in a revival of _Damn Yankees_.[64] Playing the devil, he was reportedly paid the highest sum in Broadway history at the time.[65]

He performed in both the national and London runs of the musical. Lewis missed three performances of the live show in four-plus years, one being Martin's funeral. He was then interviewed by James Lipton on _Inside the Actors Studio_. In 1996, Lewis served as executive producer of _The Nutty Professor_ remake, starring Eddie Murphy. Lewis would next appear on the 12th annual American Comedy Awards in 1998.

In 2000, Lewis appeared as a guest on _The Martin Short Show_, then on _Russell Gilbert Live_ and executive produced _The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps_. In 2003, Lewis did guest appearances on _Your World with Neil Cavuto_ and did a guest voice as Professor Frink's father in a _Treehouse of Horror_ episode of _The Simpsons_. He then made a cameo in _Miss Cast Away and the Island Girls_ in 2004. In 2005, Lewis went on make guest appearances on _Late Night with Conan O' Brien_ and _Live with Kelly_.

In 2006, He guest starred in an episode of _Law & Order: Special Victims Unit_ as Munch's uncle. Lewis sang and recorded the duet song "Time After Time" with Dean Martin's daughter, Deana Martin, for her album _Memories Are Made of This_. He then appeared on the 81st Academy Awards in 2009.

Jerry_Lewis_Cannes_2013_2.jpg in 2013]] Lewis made a musical theatre play of _The Nutty Professor_[66][67] at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center in Nashville in 2012. In Brazil, Lewis appeared in _Till Luck Do Us Part 2_ (2013), a sequel to the 2012 film _Till Luck Do Us Part_. In 2014, Lewis was guest on _The Talk_ and on _The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon_. In 2015, Lewis guest appeared on _The World Over with Raymond Arroyo_.

Lewis starred in a small role in _The Trust_ (2016) and a serious lead role in his final film _Max Rose_ (2016), which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival.[68] He was a guest on _WTF with Marc Maron_ and in December, expressed interest in another movie.[69] Lewis' last appearance was in an episode of _Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee_.


Video assist

During production of _The Bellboy_, Lewis pioneered the technique of using video cameras and multiple closed circuit monitors,[70] which allowed him to review his performance instantly. This was necessary since he was acting as well as directing. His techniques and methods of video assist, documented in his book and his USC class, enabled him to complete most of his films on time and under budget since reshoots could take place immediately instead of waiting for the dailies.

_Man in Motion_,[71] a featurette for _Three on a Couch_, features the video system, named "Jerry's Noisy Toy"[72] and shows Lewis receiving the Golden Light Technical Achievement award for its development. Lewis stated he worked with the head of Sony to produce the prototype. While he initiated its practice and use, and was instrumental in its development, he did not hold a patent.[73][74] This practice is now commonplace in filmmaking.


Film class and ventures

Starting in 1967, Lewis taught a film directing class at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles for a number of years. His students included George Lucas, whose friend Steven Spielberg sometimes sat in on classes.[75] Lewis screened Spielberg's early film _Amblin'_ and told his students, "That's what filmmaking is all about."[76] The class covered all topics related to filmmaking, including pre and post production, marketing and distribution and filming comedy with rhythm and timing.[77]

His book _The Total Film Maker_ (1971), was based on 480 hours of his class lectures.[78] Lewis traveled to medical schools for seminars on laughter and healing with Dr. Clifford Kuhn and also did corporate and college lectures, motivational speaking and promoted the pain-treatment company Medtronic.


French critical acclaim

While Lewis was popular in France for his duo films with Dean Martin and his solo comedy films, his reputation and stature increased after the Paramount contract, when he began to exert total control over all aspects of his films. His involvement in directing, writing, editing and art direction coincided with the rise of auteur theory in French intellectual film criticism and the French New Wave movement. He earned consistent praise from French critics in the influential magazines _Cahiers du Cinéma_ and _Positif_, where he was hailed as an ingenious auteur.

His singular _mise-en-scene_, and skill behind the camera, were aligned with Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock and Satyajit Ray. Appreciated too, was the complexity of his also being in front of the camera. The new French criticism viewed cinema as an art form unto itself, and comedy as part of this art. Lewis is then fitted into a historical context and seen as not only worthy of critique, but as an innovator and satirist of his time.[79] Jean-Pierre Coursodon states in a 1975 Film Comment article, "The merit of the French critics, auteurist excesses notwithstanding, was their willingness to look at what Lewis was doing as a filmmaker for what it was, rather than with some preconception of what film comedy should be."

Not yet curricula at universities or art schools, Cinema Studies and Film theory were avant-garde in early 1960s America. Mainstream movie reviewers such as Pauline Kael, were dismissive of auteur theory, and others, seeing only absurdist comedy, criticized Lewis for his ambition and "castigated him for his self-indulgence" and egotism.[80] "The total film-maker, so admired in France, made Hollywood uncomfortable, since the system has always operated otherwise."

Appreciation of Lewis became a misunderstood stereotype about "the French", and it was often the object of jokes in American pop culture.[81] "That Americans can't see Jerry Lewis' genius is bewildering," says N. T. Binh, a French film magazine critic. Such bewilderment was the basis of the book _Why the French Love Jerry Lewis_.[82] In response to the lingering perception that French audiences adored him, Lewis stated in interviews he was more popular in Germany, Japan and Australia.


Activism with MDA

Mda2018logo.png Alongside his film career, Lewis was a world-renowned humanitarian, philanthropist and "number one volunteer" who supported fundraising for research into muscular dystrophy. As early as December 1951, Lewis and Martin made their first appeal for MDA at the finale of _The Colgate Comedy Hour_. In 1952, after another appeal, Lewis hosted New York area telethons until 1959. In 1954, Lewis fought Rocky Marciano in a boxing bout for MDA's fund drive.

In 1956, Lewis began his reign as national chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy Association (formerly, the Muscular Dystrophy Associations of America),[83] then in late 1966, the live annual Labor Day event of _The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon_ (also referred to as _Jerry Lewis Extra Special Special_, _Jerry Lewis Super Show_ and _Jerry Lewis Stars Across America_) debuted in syndication and would air each year. In 1977, Lewis was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the charity.

In its first year, the show raised over $1 million. By 1990, pop culture had shifted its view of disabled individuals and the telethon format. Lewis and the telethon's methods were criticized by disabled-rights activists who believed the show was "designed to evoke pity rather than empower the disabled." [84] The activists said the telethon perpetuated prejudices and stereotypes, that Lewis treated those he claimed to be helping with little respect, and that he used offensive language when describing them.[85]

Lewis rebutted the criticism and defended his methods saying, "If you don't tug at their heartstrings, then you're on the air for nothing." [86] The activist protests represented a very small minority of countless MDA patients and clients who had directly benefitted from Lewis' MDA fundraising. It is not known if the disabled-rights activists raised funds to assist other clients afflicted with Muscular Dystrophy.

In 1998, Lewis' telethon became the first ever to be viewed around the globe via internet simulcast by RealNetworks on MDA's website. He received a Governors Award in 2005, in recognition of his fight for the cause and in 2009, Lewis was presented the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for his efforts for MDA. On August 3, 2011, it was announced that Lewis would no longer host the MDA telethons[87] and that he was no longer associated with the Muscular Dystrophy Association[88]

A tribute to Lewis was held during the 2011 telethon and then on May 1, 2015, it was announced that in view of "the new realities of television viewing and philanthropic giving", the telethon was being discontinued.[89]

In early 2016, Lewis broke a five-year silence by making a surprise online video statement at MDA's brand re-launch event at Carnegie Hall in New York City for the organization on its website in honor of its rebranding marking his first (and as it turned out, his final) appearance in support of MDA since his last telethon in 2010 and the end of his tenure as national chairman in 2011.

In over half a century, Lewis raised an estimated $2.6 billion in donations for the cause.[90] MDA's website states, "Jerry's love, passion and brilliance are woven throughout this organization, which he helped build from the ground up. Lewis courted sponsors for MDA, appeared at openings of MDA care and research centers, addressed meetings of civic organizations, volunteers and the MDA Board of Directors, successfully lobbied Congress for federal neuromuscular disease research funds and made countless phone calls and visits to families served by MDA.

During Lewis' lifetime, MDA-funded scientists discovered the causes of most of the diseases in the Muscular Dystrophy Association's program, developing treatments, therapies and standards of care that have allowed many people living with these diseases to live longer and grow stronger."[91] Over 200 research and treatment facilities were built with donations raised by the Jerry Lewis Telethons.


Other activities

Lewis opened a camera shop in 1950, then in 1969, Lewis agreed to lend his name to "Jerry Lewis Cinemas", offered by National Cinema Corporation as a franchise business opportunity for those interested in theatrical movie exhibition. Jerry Lewis Cinemas stated that their theaters could be operated by a staff of as few as two with the aid of automation and support provided by the franchiser in booking film and other aspects of film exhibition. A forerunner of the smaller rooms typical of later multi-screen complexes, a Jerry Lewis Cinema was billed in franchising ads as a "mini-theatre" with a seating capacity of between 200 and 350.

In addition to Lewis's name, each Jerry Lewis Cinemas bore a sign with a cartoon logo of Lewis in profile.[92] Initially 158 territories were franchised, with a buy-in fee of $10,000 or $15,000 depending on the territory, for what was called an "individual exhibitor". For $50,000, Jerry Lewis Cinemas offered an opportunity known as an "area directorship", in which investors controlled franchising opportunities in a territory as well as their own cinemas.[93] The success of the chain was hampered by a policy of only booking second-run, family-friendly films.

Eventually the policy was changed, and the Jerry Lewis Cinemas were allowed to show more competitive movies. But after a decade the chain failed and both Lewis and National Cinema Corporation declared bankruptcy in 1980.[94] In 1973, Lewis appeared on the 1st annual 20-hour Highway Safety Foundation telethon, hosted by Davis Jr. and Monty Hall. In 1990, Lewis wrote and directed a short film for UNICEF's _How Are The Children?_ anthology exploring the rights of children worldwide. The eight-minute segment, titled _Boy_, was about a young white child in a black world and being subjected to quiet, insidious racism, and outright racist bullying.[95]

In 2010, Lewis met with seven-year-old Lochie Graham, who shared his idea for "Jerry's House", a place for vulnerable and traumatized children. Lewis and Graham entered into a joint partnership for an Australian and a U.S.-based charity and began raising funds to build the facility in Melbourne, Australia.[96][97] On September 12, 2016, Lewis lent his name and star power to Criss Angel's HELP (Heal Every Life Possible) charity event.

Lewis kept a low political profile for many years, having taken advice reportedly given to him by President John F. Kennedy, who told him "Don't get into anything political. Don't do that because they will usurp your energy".[98] Nevertheless, he campaigned and performed on behalf of both JFK and Robert F. Kennedy. Lewis was a supporter of the Civil Rights Movement. For his 1957 NBC special, Lewis held his ground when southern affiliates objected to his stated friendship with Sammy Davis Jr. In a 1971 _Movie Mirror_ magazine article, Lewis came out against the Vietnam War, when his son, Gary, returned from service traumatized. He vowed to leave the country rather than send another of his sons.

Lewis once stated political speeches should not be at the Oscars. "I think we are the most dedicated industry in the world. And I think that we have to present ourselves that night as hard-working, caring and important people to the industry. We need to get more self-respect as an industry".[99] In a 2004 interview with The Guardian, Lewis was asked what he was least proud of, to which he answered, "Politics". Not his politics, but the world's politics – the madness, the destruction, the general lack of respect.

He lamented citizens' lack of pride in their country, stating, "President Bush is my president. I will not say anything negative about the president of the United States. I don't do that. And I don't allow my children to do that. Likewise when I come to England don't you do any jokes about 'Mum' to me. That is the Queen of England, you moron." "Do you know how tough a job it is to be the Queen of England?"[100]

In a December 2015 interview on EWTN's _World Over_ with Raymond Arroyo, Lewis expressed opposition to the United States letting in Syrian refugees, saying "No one has worked harder for the human condition than I have, but they're not part of the human condition if 11 guys in that group of 10,000 are ISIS. How can I take that chance?"[101] In the same interview, he criticized President Barack Obama for not being prepared for ISIS, while expressing support for Donald Trump, saying he would make a good president because he was a good "showman". He also added that he admired Ronald Reagan's presidency.[102][103][104]

In 1998, at the Aspen U.S. Comedy Arts Festival, when asked which women comics he admired, Lewis answered, "I don't like any female comedians." "A woman doing comedy doesn't offend me but sets me back a bit." [105] He later clarified his statements saying, "Seeing a woman project the kind of aggression that you have to project as a comic just rubs me wrong." "I cannot sit and watch a lady diminish her qualities to the lowest common denominator." Lewis explained his attitude as that of an older generation and said women are funny, but not when performing 'broad' or 'crude' humor.

He went on to praise Lucille Ball as "brilliant" and said Carol Burnett is "the greatest female entrepreneur of comedy." On other occasions Lewis expressed admiration for female comedians Totie Fields, Phyllis Diller, Kathleen Freeman, Elayne Boosler, Whoopi Goldberg and Tina Fey. During the 2007 MDA Telethon, Lewis used the word "fag" in a joke, for which he apologized.[106] Lewis used the same word the following year on Australian television.[107] In 2017, Lewis invited the world's most influential minds of comedy to join him at the inaugural Legionnaires of Laughter.


Personal life

Relationships and children

Lewis wed Patti Palmer[108][109][110] (later Lewis, née Esther Grace Calonico[111][112]; born 1922[113]), an Italian American[114] singer with Ted Fio Rito,[115] on October 3, 1944, and the two had six children together, five biological, Gary Levitch (later Lewis)[116][117] (born 1945), Scott (born 1956), Christopher[118] (born 1957), Anthony[119] (born 1959), and Joseph[120][121] (1964 – 2009), and one adopted, Ronald[122] (born 1949). It was an Interfaith marriage; Lewis was Jewish and Palmer was Catholic. Palmer filed for divorce from Lewis in 1980, after 35 years of marriage, citing Lewis' extravagant spending and infidelity on his part, and it was finalized in 1983.[123][124][125] All of Lewis' children and grandchildren from his marriage to Palmer were excluded from inheriting any part of his estate.[126][127] While married to Palmer, Lewis openly pursued relationships with other women and gave unapologetic interviews about his infidelity, revealing his affairs with Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Dietrich to People in 2011.[128] His eldest son, Gary, publicly called his father a "mean and evil person" and said that Lewis never showed him or his siblings any love or care.[129]

Lewis' second wife was Sandra "SanDee" Pitnick,[130] a stewardess who met Lewis after winning a bit part in his film, _Hardly Working_. They were wed on February 13, 1983, in Key Biscayne, Florida[131] and had one child together, an adopted daughter named Danielle (born 1992).[132][133][134][135][136][137][138]

During his marriage to Palmer, Lewis purportedly had an affair with model Lynn Dixon (née Esther Lynn Schaffel, born 1920), by whom he allegedly had an illegitimate daughter, Suzan Minoret[139] (née Uchitel[140]; born 1952).[141][142][143] While Lewis never publicly denied or confirmed his relationship to Minoret, genetic testing performed in 2009 by professionals hired by Inside Edition determined there was more than an 88% likelihood that Minoret was Lewis' daughter.[144][145] She was later adopted by her step-father and mother's second husband, nightclub owner and restaurateur Hy Jason Uchitel.[146][147][148] According to Minoret, she met Lewis as an adult only once and after that meeting, Lewis' agent ordered her to not contact the entertainer again and her requests to visit him in the hospital were denied by staff.[149]

Stalking incident

In February 1994, a man named Gary Benson was revealed to have been stalking Lewis and his family.[150] Benson subsequently served four years in prison.[151]

Illness

Lewis had a number of illnesses and addictions related both to aging and a back injury sustained in a comedic pratfall. The fall has been stated as being either from a piano while performing at the Sands Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip on March 20, 1965,[152][153] or during an appearance on _The Andy Williams Show_.[154] In its aftermath, Lewis became addicted to the painkiller Percodan for thirteen years.[155] He said he had been off the drug since 1978.[156] In April 2002, Lewis had a Medtronic "Synergy" neurostimulator implanted in his back,[157] which helped reduce the discomfort. He was one of the company's leading spokesmen.[158][159] In the 2011 documentary _Method to the Madness of Jerry Lewis,_ Lewis said he had his first heart attack at age 34 while filming _Cinderfella_ in 1960.[160][161] In December 1982, he had another heart attack. En route to San Diego from New York City on a cross-country commercial airline flight on June 11, 2006, he had another.[162]

It was discovered that he had pneumonia, as well as a severely damaged heart. He underwent a cardiac catheterization and two stents were inserted into one of his coronary arteries, which was 90 percent blocked. The surgery resulted in increased blood flow to his heart and allowed him to continue his rebound from earlier lung problems. Having the cardiac catheterization meant canceling several major events from his schedule, but Lewis fully recuperated in a matter of weeks. In 1999, Lewis' Australian tour was cut short when he had to be hospitalized in Darwin with viral meningitis. He was ill for more than five months. It was reported in the Australian press that he had failed to pay his medical bills. However, Lewis maintained that the payment confusion was the fault of his health insurer.

The resulting negative publicity caused him to sue his insurer for US$100 million.[163] Lewis had prostate cancer,[164] type 1 diabetes,[165][166] pulmonary fibrosis,[167] and a decades-long history of cardiovascular disease. Prednisone[168] treatment in the late 1990s for pulmonary fibrosis resulted in weight gain and a noticeable change in his appearance. In September 2001, Lewis was unable to perform at a planned London charity event at the London Palladium. He was the headlining act, and he was introduced but did not appear. He had suddenly become unwell, apparently with heart problems.[169]

He was subsequently taken to the hospital. Some months thereafter, Lewis began an arduous, months-long therapy that weaned him off prednisone and enabled him to return to work. On June 12, 2012, he was treated and released from a hospital after collapsing from hypoglycemia at a New York Friars Club event. This latest health issue forced him to cancel a show in Sydney.[170] In an October 2016 interview with _Inside Edition_, Lewis acknowledged that he might not star in any more films, given his advanced age, while admitting, through tears, that he was afraid of dying, as it would leave his wife and daughter alone.[171] In June 2017, Lewis was hospitalized at a Las Vegas hospital for a urinary tract infection.[172]


Death

Lewis died at his home in Las Vegas, Nevada, at 9:15 a.m. (PDT) on August 20, 2017, at the age of 91.[173] The cause was end-stage cardiac disease and peripheral artery disease.[174] In his will, Lewis left his estate to his second wife of 34 years, SanDee Pitnick, and their daughter, and intentionally excluded his sons from his first marriage as well as their descendants.[175]


Tributes and legacy

For almost two decades, from the late '40s to the mid-'60s, "Lewis was a virtually unprecedented force in American popular culture."[176] Widely acknowledged as a comic genius, Lewis influenced successive generations of comedians, comedy writers, performers and filmmakers.[177] As Lewis was often referenced as the bridge from Vaudeville to modern comedy, Carl Reiner wrote after Lewis' death, "All comedians watch other comedians, and every generation of comedians going back to those who watched Jerry on the _Colgate Comedy Hour_ were influenced by Jerry. They say that mankind goes back to the first guy ... which everyone tries to copy. In comedy that guy was Jerry Lewis."[178]

Lewis "single-handedly created a style of humor that was half anarchy, half excruciation. Even comics who never took a pratfall in their careers owe something to the self-deprecation Jerry introduced into American show business." [179] His self-deprecating humor can be found in Larry David or David Letterman.

Lewis' comedy style was physically uninhibited, expressive, and potentially volatile. He was known especially for his distinctive voice, facial expressions, pratfalls, and physical stunts. His improvisations and ad-libbing, especially in nightclubs and early television, were revolutionary among performers. It was "marked by a raw, edgy energy that would distinguish him within the comedy landscape." [180] Will Sloan, of _Flavorwire_ wrote, "In the late '40s and early '50s, nobody had ever seen a comedian as wild as Jerry Lewis."[181] Placed in the context of the conservative era, his antics were radical and liberating, paving the way for future comedians Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Andy Kaufman, Paul Reubens, and Jim Carrey. Carrey wrote: "Through his comedy, Jerry would stretch the boundaries of reality so far that it was an act of anarchy ... I learned from Jerry",[182] and "I am because he was".[183]

Acting the bumbling and stammering 'everyman', Lewis used tightly choreographed, sophisticated sight gags, physical routines, verbal double-talk and malapropisms. "You cannot help but notice Lewis' incredible sense of control in regards to performing—they may have looked at times like the ravings of a madman but his best work had a genuine grace and finesse behind it that would put most comedic performers of any era to shame."[184] They are "choreographed as exactly as any ballet, each movement and gesture coming on natural beats and conforming to the overall rhythmic form which is headed to a spectacular finale: absolute catastrophe."[185]

Lewis' work, specifically his self-directed films, have warranted steady reappraisal. Richard Brody in _The New Yorker_ said, Lewis was "one of the most original, inventive, ... profound directors of the time."[186] and "one of the most skilled and original comic performers, verbal and physical, ever to appear on screen." Film critic and film curator for the Museum of Modern Art, Dave Kehr wrote in _The New York Times_ of Lewis' "fierce creativity", "the extreme formal sophistication of his direction" and, Lewis was ". ... one of the great American filmmakers."

"Lewis was an explosive experimenter with a dazzling skill, and an audacious, innovatory flair for the technique of the cinema. He knew how to frame and present his own adrenaline-fuelled, instinctive physical comedy for the camera."[187]

Lewis was in the forefront in the transition to independent filmmaking, which came to be known as New Hollywood in the late 1960s. Writing for the _Los Angeles Times_ in 2005, screenwriter David Weddle lauded Lewis' audacity in 1959 "daring to declare his independence from the studio system."[188] Lewis came along to a studio system in which the industry was regularly stratified between players and coaches. The studios tightly controlled the process and they wanted their people directing. Yet Lewis regularly led, often flouting the power structure to do so. Control over material was smart business, and it was also good art. Neither the entrepreneur nor the auteur were common types among actors in mid-20th century Hollywood. But there Lewis was, at a time of strict studio control, doing both. [189]

No other comedic star, with the exceptions of Chaplin and Keaton in the silent era, dared to direct himself. "Not only would Lewis' efforts as a director pave the way for the likes of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen, but it would reveal him to be uncommonly skilled in that area as well." "Most screen comedies until that time were not especially cinematic—they tended to plop down the camera where it could best capture the action and that was it. Lewis, on the other hand, was interested in exploring the possibilities of the medium by utilizing the tools he had at his disposal in formally innovative and oftentimes hilarious ways." [190] "In Lewis' work the way the scene is photographed is an integral part of the joke. His purposeful selection of lenses, for example, expands and contracts space to generate laughs that aren't necessarily inherent in the material, and he often achieves his biggest effects via what he leaves off screen, not just visually but structurally." [191]

As a director, Lewis advanced the film comedy genre with innovations in the areas of fragmented narrative, experimental use of music and sound technology, and near surrealist use of color and art direction.[192][193][194] This prompted his peer, filmmaker Jean Luc Godard to proclaim, "Jerry Lewis ... is the only one in Hollywood doing something different, the only one who isn't falling in with the established categories, the norms, the principles. ... Lewis is the only one today who's making courageous films. He's been able to do it because of his personal genius".[195] Jim Hemphill for _American Cinematheque_ wrote, "They are films of ambitious visual and narrative experimentation, provocative and sometimes conflicted commentaries on masculinity in post-war America, and unsettling self-critiques and analyses of the performer's neuroses."

Intensely personal and original, Lewis' films were groundbreaking in their use of dark humor for psychological exploration.[196] Justin Chang of the _Los Angeles Times_ said, "The idea of comedians getting under the skin and tapping into their deepest, darkest selves is no longer especially novel, but it was far from a universally accepted notion when Lewis first took the spotlight. Few comedians before him had so brazenly turned arrested development into art, or held up such a warped fun house mirror to American identity in its loudest, ugliest, vulgarest excesses. Fewer still had advanced the still-radical notion that comedy doesn't always have to be funny, just fearless, in order to strike a nerve".[197]

Pre 1960, Hollywood comedies were screwball or farce. Lewis, from his earliest 'home movies, such as _How to Smuggle a Hernia Across the Border_, made in his playhouse in the early 1950s, was one of the first to introduce satire as a full-length film. This "sharp eyed" satire continued in his mature work, commenting on the cult of celebrity, the machinery of 'fame', and "the dilemma of being true to oneself while also fitting into polite society." Stephen Dalton in _The Hollywood Reporter_ wrote, Lewis had "an agreeably bitter streak, offering self-lacerating insights into celebrity culture which now look strikingly modern. Even post-modern in places." Speaking of _The King of Comedy_, "More contemporary satirists like Garry Shandling, Steve Coogan and Ricky Gervais owe at least some of their self-deconstructing chops to Lewis' generously unappetizing turn in Scorsese's cult classic."[198]

Lewis was an early master of deconstruction to enhance comedy. From the first _Comedy Hour_s he exposed the artifice of on stage performance by acknowledging the lens, sets, malfunctioning props, failed jokes, and tricks of production. As Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote: Lewis had "the impulse to deconstruct and even demolish the fictional "givens" of any particular sketch, including those that he might have dreamed up himself, a kind of perpetual auto-destruction that becomes an essential part of his filmmaking as he steadily gains more control over the writing and direction of his features."[199] His self directed films abound in behind-the-scene reveals, demystifying movie-making. Daniel Fairfax writes in _Deconstructing Jerry: Lewis as a Director_, "Lewis deconstructs the very functioning of the joke itself". ... quoting Chris Fujiwara, "_The Patsy_ is a film so radical that it makes comedy out of the situation of a comedian who isn't funny."[200] The final scene of _The Patsy_ is famous for revealing to the audience the movie as a movie, and Lewis as actor/director.[201] Lewis wrote in _The Total Filmmaker_, his belief in breaking the fourth wall, actors looking directly into the camera, despite industry norms.[202] More contemporary comedies such as _The Larry Sanders Show_, _Curb Your Enthusiasm_, and _The Office_ continue this method.

Robert DeNiro and Sandra Bernhard (both of whom starred with Lewis in _The King of Comedy_) reflected on his death, Bernhard said, "It was one of the great experiences of my career, he was tough but one of a kind". De Niro said, "Jerry was a pioneer in comedy and film. And he was a friend. I was fortunate to have seen him a few times over the past couple of years. Even at 91, he didn't miss a beat ... or a punchline. You'll be missed."[203] There was also a New York Friars Club roast in honor of Lewis with Sarah Silverman and Amy Schumer.[204][205][206][207] Martin Scorsese recalls working with him on _The King of Comedy_, "It was like watching a virtuoso pianist at the keyboard".[208][209][210][211][212][213][214][215][216] Lewis was the subject of a documentary _Jerry Lewis: Method to the Madness_.[217][218][219][220][221][222][223]

Peter Chelsom, director of _Funny Bones_ wrote, "Working with him was a masterclass in comic acting – and in charm. From the outset he was generous." "There's a very thin line between a talent for being funny and being a great actor. Jerry Lewis epitomised that. Jerry embodied the term "funny bones": a way of differentiating between comedians who _tell_ funny and those who _are_ funny." [224] Director Daniel Noah recalling his relationship with Lewis during production of _Max Rose_ wrote, "He was kind and loving and patient and limitlessly generous with his genius. He was unbelievably complicated and shockingly self-aware."[225]

Actor and comedian Jeffrey Tambor wrote after Lewis' death, "You invented the whole thing. Thank you doesn't even get close."[226]

There have been numerous retrospectives of Lewis' films in the U.S. and abroad, most notably _Jerry Lewis: A Film and Television Retrospective_ at Museum of the Moving Image, the 2013 Viennale, the 2016 Melbourne International Film Festival, _The Innovator: Jerry Lewis at Paramount_, at American Cinematheque in Los Angeles, and _Happy Birthday Mr. Lewis: The Kid Turns 90_, at MOMA. Lewis is one of the few performers to have touched every aspect of 20th Century American entertainment, appearing in vaudeville, burlesque, the 'borsht belt', nightclubs, radio, Classical Hollywood Cinema (The 'Golden Age'), Las Vegas, television: variety, drama, sit-coms and talk shows, Broadway and independent films.

On August 21, 2017, multiple hotel marquees on the Las Vegas Strip honored Lewis with a coordinated video display of images of his career as a Las Vegas performer and resident.[227] From 1949, as part of Martin and Lewis, and from 1956 as a solo, Lewis was a casino showroom headliner, playing numerous dates over the decades. It was also the home for the annual Labor Day MDA telethon.

On June 25, 2019, _The New York Times Magazine_ listed Jerry Lewis among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[228]


In popular culture

Between 1952 and 1971, DC Comics published a 124-issues comic book series with Lewis as one (later, the only) main protagonist, titled _The Adventures of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis_. In _The Simpsons_, the character of Professor Frink is based on Lewis' Julius Kelp from _The Nutty Professor._[229] In _Family Guy,_ Peter recreates Lewis' 'Chairman of the Board' scene from _The Errand Boy_. Comedian, actor and friend of Lewis, Martin Short satirized him on the series _SCTV_ in the sketches "The Nutty Lab Assistant", "Martin Scorsese presents Jerry Lewis Live on the Champs Elysees!", "The Tender Fella", and "Scenes From an Idiots Marriage",[230][231][232] as well as on _Saturday Night Live_{{'}}s "Celebrity Jeopardy!".[233]

Also on _SNL_, the Martin and Lewis reunion on the 1976 MDA Telethon is reported by Chevy Chase on _Weekend Update_.[234] Comedians Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo both parodied Lewis when he hosted SNL in 1983. Piscopo also channeled Jerry Lewis while performing as a 20th-century stand-up comedian in _Star Trek: The Next Generation_; in the second-season episode "The Outrageous Okona", Piscopo's Holodeck character, The Comic, tutors android Lieutenant Commander Data on humor and comedy.[235] Comedian and actor Jim Carrey satirized Lewis on _In Living Color_ in the sketch "Jheri's Kids Telethon".[236] Carrey had an uncredited cameo playing Lewis in the series _Buffalo Bill_ on the episode "Jerry Lewis Week".[237] He also played Lewis, with impersonator Rich Little as Dean Martin, on stage. Actor Sean Hayes portrayed Lewis in the made-for-TV movie _Martin and Lewis_, with Jeremy Northam as Dean Martin.[238] Actor Kevin Bacon plays the Lewis character in the 2005 film _Where The Truth Lies,_ based on a fictionalized version of Martin and Lewis.[239] In the satiric novel, _Funny Men_, about singer/wild comic double act, the character Sigmund "Ziggy" Blissman, is based on Lewis.

John Saleeby, writer for _National Lampoon_ has a humor piece "Ten Things You Should Know About Jerry Lewis".[240] In the animated cartoon _Popeye's 20th Anniversary_, Martin and Lewis are portrayed on the dais.[241] The animated series _Animaniacs_ satirized Lewis in several episodes. In 1998, The MTV animated show _Celebrity Deathmatch_ had a clay-animated fight to the death between Dean Martin and Lewis. In a 1975 re-issue of _MAD Magazine_ the contents of Lewis' wallet is satirized in their on-going feature "Celebrities' Wallets".

Lewis, and Martin & Lewis, as himself or his films, have been referenced by directors and performers of differing genres spanning decades, including, Blake Edwards's _Breakfast at Tiffany's_ (1960), Andy Warhol's Soap Opera (1964), John Frankenheimer's _I Walk the Line_ (1970), Francis Ford Coppola's _The Godfather_ (1972), Randal Kleiser's _Grease_ (1978), Rainer Werner Fassbinder's _In a Year of 13 Moons_ (1978), Quentin Tarantino's Four Rooms (1995), Martin Scorsese's _Gangs of New York_ (2002), Hitchcock (2012), Ben Stiller's _The Secret Life of Walter Mitty_ (2013), Jay Roach's _Trumbo_ (2015), _The Comedians_ (2015), _Baskets_ (2016) and _The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel_ (2017, 2018).

Similarly, varied musicians have mentioned Lewis in song lyrics including, Ice Cube, The Dead Milkmen, Queen Latifah, and Frank Zappa.[242] The hip hop music band Beastie Boys have an unreleased single "The Jerry Lewis", which they mention, and danced to, on stage in Asheville, North Carolina in 2009.[243] In their film _Paul's Boutique — A Visual Companion_, clips from _The Nutty Professor_ play to "The Sounds of Science".[244] In 1986, the comedy radio show _Dr. Demento_ aired a parody of "Rock Me Amadeus", "Rock Me Jerry Lewis".

Apple iOS 10 includes an auto-text emoji for 'professor' with a Lewis lookalike portrayal from _The Nutty Professor_.[245] The word "flaaaven!", with its many variations and rhymes, is a Lewis-ism often used as a misspoken word or a person's mis-pronounced name.[246] In a 2016 episode of the podcast _West Wing Weekly_, Joshua Malina is heard saying "flaven" when trying to remember a character's correct last name. Lewis' signature catchphrase "Hey, Laaady!" is ubiquitously used by comedians and laypersons alike.[247]

Sammy Petrillo bore a coincidental resemblance to Lewis,[248][249] so much so that Lewis at first tried to catch and kill Petrillo's career by signing him to a talent contract and then not giving him any work. When that failed (as Petrillo was under 18 at the time), Lewis tried to blackball Petrillo by pressuring television outlets and then nightclubs,[250] also threatening legal action after Petrillo used his Lewis impersonation in the film _Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla_.[251]
