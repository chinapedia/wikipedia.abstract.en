_PLATFORMS PIECE_ consists of three bronze sculptures of commuters at Brixton railway station, completed by the British artist Kevin Atherton in 1986.

In November 2016, _Platforms Piece_ was given listed status by Historic England, and two of the figures are believed to be the first public sculptural representations of black British people in the UK.[1]
