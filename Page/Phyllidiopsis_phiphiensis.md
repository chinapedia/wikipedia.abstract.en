_PHYLLIDIOPSIS PHIPHIENSIS_ is a species of sea slug, a dorid nudibranch, a shell-less marine gastropod mollusk in the family Phyllidiidae.[1]


Distribution

This species was described from Phi Phi Island, southern Thailand. It has been reported from Myanmar, Sri Lanka and India, Kenya and the Maldives.[2][3]


Description

This nudibranch has a white dorsum with three longitudinal black lines interspersed with two raised ridges. It is a small Phyllidiid, growing to about 15Â mm in length. There are black spots bordering the edge of the mantle. The rhinophores are white. It is similar to _Phyllidiopsis xishaensis_ and _Phyllidiopsis annae_ but has three instead of four longitudinal black lines on the mantle and different coloured rhinophores to _Phyllidiopsis annae_, which are black in that species.[4]


Diet

This species feeds on a sponge belonging to the genus _Gellius_.
