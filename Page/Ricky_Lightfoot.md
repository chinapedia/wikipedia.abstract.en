He has won several of the most prestigious fell races, including the Three Peaks Race,[5] Wasdale,[6] Borrowdale,[7] Ennerdale,[8] the Three Shires[9] and Skiddaw.[10] He won the Lakeland Classics Trophy series in 2007[11] and 2015.[12]

He has also competed domestically on other surfaces, winning the Brampton to Carlisle and Derwentwater 10 road races and the Cumbria Cross Country Championships.[13]

Internationally, Lightfoot won the Zegama-Aizkorri race in 2009[14] and finished third in that season’s Skyrunner World Series.[15] He was also third in the World Long Distance Mountain Running Challenge that year when the event was incorporated into the Kaisermarathon in Söll.[16]

He won the Hammer Trail in Denmark, his first ultramarathon, in 2012.[17] In 2013, he won the IAU Trail World Championships when the competition was held in Llanrwst.[18] Also that year, he won the Trail du Colorado in Réunion[19] and the Otter Trail Run in South Africa.[20]

In 2014, he was victorious at the Dodo Trail in Mauritius[21] and the following year he won the Ultra Skymarathon Madeira.[22]
