DAG DETTER is an investment advisor to governments and investors, as well as an author and speaker on the topic of public commercial assets.[1] He is the former President of Stattum and Director at the Swedish Ministry of Industry, leading the restructuring of the government portfolio of public assets during the reforms 1998-2001.[2][3][4]

Together with Stefan Fölster, he is the author of two books, including _The Public Wealth of Nations : How Management of Public Assets Can Boost or Bust Economic Growth_ (Palgrave, 2015),[5] included in The Economist — Books of the Year 2015[6] and the Financial Times FT’s Best Books of the Year 2015.[7] The book argues that better management of public assets would increase global living standards and improve the fabric of democratic institutions.[8]

In 2017 The Brookings Institution Press published _The Public Wealth of Cities: How to Unlock Hidden Assets to Boost Growth and Prosperity_. This book focuses on the local level of governments and says that while many cities and counties are scrambling to find money to survive, they are sitting on an enormous untapped wealth which could be used to pay not only for infrastructure but also investments in any important social functions.[9] The book states that economic vitality and financial stability to cities could be achieved by focusing on public wealth and shifting attention and resources from short-term spending to longer-term investments.[10]

Detter has also written for _Financial Times_,[11] _Wall Street Journal_,[12] _Project Syndicate_,[13] _Foreign Affairs_,[14] _Foreign Policy_,[15] _International Monetary Fund_,[16] _The World Bank_,[17] _Chicago Tribune_,[18] _Public Finance (magazine)_,[19] and _Toronto Globe & Mail_,[20] as well as the _World Economic Forum_.[21]
