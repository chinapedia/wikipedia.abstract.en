GILBERT CHARLES BOURNE FRS (5 July 1861â€“ 9 March 1933) was a British zoologist.[1][2]

Bourne was the Linacre Professor of Zoology at the University of Oxford from 1906 to 1921.[3]

Apart from his scientific work, Bourne was a keen soldier. He was an officer in the 4th (Militia) Battalion of The King's (Shropshire Light Infantry) from 1882 until 1897, when he resigned as captain and honorary major. On the outbreak of the Second Boer War in South Africa in late 1899, he re-entered the battalion and was appointed to the rank of major on 8 November 1899 and honorary lieutenant-colonel on 28 February 1900,[4] serving as second in command while the battalion was stationed in Ireland. He later saw service during the First world war.[5]
