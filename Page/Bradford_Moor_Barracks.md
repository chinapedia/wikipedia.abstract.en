BRADFORD MOOR BARRACKS was a military installation at Bradford in West Yorkshire, England.


History

The barracks were built between 1843 and 1844 as part of the response to the Chartist riots.[1] In 1873 a system of recruiting areas based on counties was instituted and the barracks became the depot for the 14th Regiment of Foot.[2] In 1878 the 14th Regiment of Foot moved to Imphal Barracks in York[3] but other troops from the barracks were deployed to suppress the riots in Bradford in 1891.[4] During the First World War the barracks were used to accommodate German prisoners of war.[5] By 1931 the barracks had been decommissioned and were in a poor state: they were demolished to make way for a housing scheme.[6]
