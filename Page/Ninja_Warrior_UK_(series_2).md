Final

For the finals of this series, only two of the three stages of obstacles were conducted. Stage 1 required finalists to complete nine obstacles - Quintuple Steps, Pipe Slider, Paddle Boards, Jump Hang, Spider Jump, Warped Wall, Chain Swing, Spinning Bridge, and Invisible Ladder - within three minutes. Of the finalists that took this stage on, only three of them successfully completed the course - Timothy Shieff, Toby Segar and Owen McKenzie.

Stage 2 required the remaining finalists to complete five obstacles - Rope Jungle, Salmon Ladder, Unstable Bridge, Cycle Road, and Wall Lift - within 75 seconds. None managed to complete the course, being defeated by Salmon Ladder, thus the winner was determined by overall progress. Of the three finalists, McKenzie was declared the winner, managing to get further on the obstacle than Shieff and Segar.
