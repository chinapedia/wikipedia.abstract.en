ALIAS JIMMY VALENTINE is an old-time radio crime drama in the United States. It was broadcast on NBC-Blue January 18, 1938 - February 27, 1939.[1]


Format

The concept for _Alias Jimmy Valentine_ came from writer O. Henry in his short story A Retrieved Reformation.[2] That story was adapted into the 1910 play _Alias Jimmy Valentine_ by Paul Armstrong.[3]

The program's stories focused on Lee Randall, described by Jim Cox in his book, _Radio Crime Fighters: More Than 300 Programs from the Golden Age_ as "an ex-con and reformed safecracker [who] applied his talents and enormous underworld contacts to abet the forces of law and order."[4] While doing so, he became an honest bank clerk and fell in love with the daughter of the banker.[5]


Producers

The series was produced by Frank and Anne Hummert, who were described by Jim Cox in his book, _Frank and Anne Hummert's Radio Factory: The Programs and Personalities of Broadcasting's Most Prolific Producers_ as "the most prolific creatives in eight decades of broadcast history."[6] They originated more than 100 radio series, about half of which were soap operas.[7]

Cox wrote that _Alias Jimmy Valentine_ episodes raised "the never-to-be-resolved query: 'Can a protagonist go straight and overcome his impasse?'"[8] That query, Cox wrote, "was true formulaic Hummert."[9]


Personnel

Bert Lytell and James Meighan each played the lead at different times.[10] William Bennett Kilpack[11] and Earle Latimore also appeared on the program.[12]

Dick Joy was the announcer. Doris Halman was the writer.[13] Ford Bond narrated.[14]
