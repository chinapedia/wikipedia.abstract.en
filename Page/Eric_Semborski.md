ERIC SEMBORSKI (born June 1, 1993) is an American ice hockey player who served as an emergency goaltender for the Chicago Blackhawks and Philadelphia Flyers during the 2016–17 NHL season. He was substituted onto the ice, but the move was disallowed by the referee due to the primary goalie not being injured.[1] Semborski also served as an emergency backup goalie for the Blackhawks on December 3, 2016 when Corey Crawford needed an emergency appendectomy.[2] Semborski dressed for the game and sat on the Blackhawks' bench but did not make an actual appearance in the game itself. The Blackhawks later thanked Semborski by gifting him a custom goalie mask, personalized Topps trading card, and a brief video tribute at the United Center.[3]
