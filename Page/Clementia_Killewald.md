CLEMENTIA KILLEWALD OSB (born Elisabeth Killewald, 25 April 1954 – 2 July 2016[1]) was a German Benedictine nun, at Eibingen Abbey: serving first as an organist, then by taking care of the elderly and sick, and finally from 2000 as the abbess. She introduced the life and work of Hildegard of Bingen, the convent's founder, during the 2012 ceremony when Pope Benedict XVI proclaimed Hildegard a Saint and a Doctor of the Church.


Life

Born in Duisburg as the oldest of nine siblings,[2] Elisabeth Killewald grew up in Dinslaken. She received the Abitur from the Lise-Meitner-Gymnasium in Geldern. She studied first church music and flute at the Hochschule für Musik Mainz.[3] She joined the Benedictine Abbey St. Hildegard in Eibingen in 1976, assumed the religious name _Clementia_ (kindness) and made her vows on her 25th birthday, 25 April 1979.[4]

At the abbey, she worked first as an organist and member of the _Choralschola_, then took care of the elderly and sick in the infirmary. In summer of 2000 she was chosen by the convent to succeed Edeltraud Forster as the abbess. She was ordained on 3 October 2000 by Bishop Franz Kamphaus.[5][6]

She resigned for health reasons on 27 May 2016, accepted by Albert Schmidt.[12] She died in Rüdesheim am Rhein on 2 July 2016 after severe illness.[13]
