Previously the event has been held in Saudi Arabia in 2005 and Indonesia in 2013. The second event, originally scheduled to take place in October 2009 in Iran, was later re-scheduled but then cancelled.

The Islamic Solidarity Sports Federation (ISSF) is responsible for the direction and control of the Islamic Solidarity Games.[1]


Bidding

On October 2012, the National Olympic Committee of Azerbaijan submitted its bid for 2017 Islamic Solidarity Games during the 18th Islamic Solidarity Sports Federation meeting held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.[2] Baku was awarded the event during the General Assembly of ISSF in 2013, which was also held in Jeddah.[3]


Participating nations

All 56 members of the Islamic Solidarity Sports Federation participated in the Games. Due to the suspension of the Kuwait Olympic Committee, athletes from Kuwait participated in the Games as Independent ISSF Athletes, under the flag of the Islamic Solidarity Sports Federation. Athletes and coaches will be accredited by the ISSF, they will wear ISSF uniforms and any medals won, will be done so under the ISSF banner and anthem. Along the Kuwait athletes, athletes of Libya and Sudan, were scheduled to compete under ISSF banner, but withdrew hours before the opening ceremony.[4]
