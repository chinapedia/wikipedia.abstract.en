UNTUCKIT LLC (styled as "UNTUCKit" in branding materials) is an American casual men's apparel company established in 2011 and headquartered in New York City. The company focuses on selling casual shirts that are designed not to be tucked into pants, and thus are cut a bit shorter than typical men's dress shirts. The first Untuckit brick-and-mortar store was opened in September 2015, and the company now has 51 stores in various cities across the United States and Canada. Its flagship store is on Fifth Avenue in New York City.


History

Chris Riccobono came up with the idea for Untuckit while working at GE Healthcare.[1] In February 2011, he brought on Aaron Sanandres, a Columbia Business School classmate, to help develop the idea into a standalone business. Through a market survey,[2] they established the length of their shirts to be halfway between the belt and the bottom of the zipper, allowing the front pockets of the pants to be slightly exposed.

Initially running the operation out of the third bedroom in Riccobono's apartment in Hoboken, New Jersey,[3] and shipping out of a local storage unit, Untuckit opened its first store in September 2015 in SoHo, New York (on Prince Street). In 2016, brick-and-mortar stores were opened in Chicago, Illinois,[4] Los Angeles, California,[5] Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, California. The Company opened an additional 20 stores in 2017, including 3 additional stores in New York City and an additional 26 stores in 2018. As of January 2019, the company has a total of 51 stores[6] including their first international store in Canada at Sherway Gardens. The location opened on September 12, 2018.[7]


Products

Casual shirts are Untuckit's core product, although other clothing items are also now available from the company's website and brick-and-mortar stores. The product line includes button-down shirts, polos, tee shirts, henleys, vests, sweatshirts, outerwear, and sports coats.
