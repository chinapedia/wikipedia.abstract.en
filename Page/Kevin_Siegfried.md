He also studied in France and in India, where he received a Stanley Fellowship to study South Indian classical music with Sriram Parasuram.[4] He has received grants and awards from ASCAP, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the New Hampshire State Council on the Arts, among other organizations.

Siegfried is especially noted for his work with the music of the Shakers, which he first encountered in 1995 during a visit to the Shaker village at Pleasant Hill, Kentucky. He has since produced many choral arrangements of Shaker songs,[7] and has composed a cantata, _Angel of Light_, for which they served as a basis.[8] He has been associated for some time with Canterbury Shaker Village in New Hampshire,[9][10][11] and Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village in Maine, as of 2017 the home of the last living Shakers.[12] Siegfried's arrangements of Shaker music have been recorded by the Tudor Choir and the Dale Warland Singers.[13][14][15] He has also written works for the Nashua Symphony Orchestra in Nashua, New Hampshire.[16][17]
