_WOZZECK_ (op. 16) is a 1926 German-language opera in 18 scenes and one epilogue by Manfred Gurlitt after the fragmentary _Woyzeck_ by Georg Büchner. It was premiered 22 April 1926 in Bremen, four months after the better known opera _Wozzeck_ by Alban Berg had been premiered at the Berlin State Opera on 14 December 1925. The two composers were unaware of each other's projects, being among many artists stimulated by the publication of Büchner's play.[1] Berg, unsettled by his publisher Universal Edition also publishing another opera on the same material so quickly reviewed Gurlitt's piano score, and in a letter to Erich Kleiber noted Gurlitt's work's quality and originality, but found the "broth" watered down. This verdict reflects Berg's own Wagnerian influences, while Gurlitt was nearer to the aesthetics of Paul Hindemith and Kurt Weill.[2]

Gurlitt's intelligent, daring response to Buchner's staccato dramaturgy — one gets the impression that Buchner was writing screenplays ninety years ahead of time — was to write a series of musical scenes, separated by silences and not ordered into larger structural units, i.e. acts."

[2] Christopher Hailey _Alban Berg and His World_ 1400836476 2010 p20 "In a letter to Erich Kleiber he wrote, “I've already had a look at the piano vocal score of the Gurlitt Wozzeck. I am objective enough to be able to say that it's not bad or unoriginal—but I'm also objective enough to see that the broth in the kettle of this opera, that is, in the orchestra, is too watered down, even for 'poor folks' [arme Leut'].." ..Gurlitt's opera, with its lean, simplified textures and stylistic heterogeneity, is far less emotionally manipulative and much more in keeping with the aesthetic of the 1920s one hears in the music of such contemporaries as Hindemith or Kurt Weill.
