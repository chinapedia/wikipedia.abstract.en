Amsterdam_Houses_W63_jeh.JPG The AMSTERDAM HOUSES are a housing project in New York City that were established in the borough of Manhattan in 1948. The project consists of 13 buildings with over 1,000 apartment units. It covers a 9-acre expanse of the Upper West Side, and is bordered by West 61st and West 64th Streets, from Amsterdam Avenue to West End Avenue, with a 175-apartment addition that was completed in 1974 on West 65th Street between Amsterdam Avenue and West End Avenue. It is owned and managed by New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA).[1][2]


About

The Amsterdam Houses were created on land that was once tenement buildings and were created for residents to have a higher standard of living. Three playgrounds were built for children of various ages and the development housed a nursery, gymnasium, clinic and a community center. With the opening of Lincoln Center in the 1960s, the neighborhood began to gentrify and saw many older residents retaining their apartments with 70% of heads of households over the age of 62.[3] The demographics living in this development were initially mixed, as it served to house post-war families in affordable housing. Today, mostly black families occupy the Amsterdam Houses.[4]

In 2016, NYCHA announced that a new residential tower, containing entirely affordable units, would be built on the development's open space in the center. The land would be leased to a developer, who would also operate the building, for 99 years, while the land would continue to be owned by NYCHA.[5] After the announcement, the tenant association began working with lawyers and city-wide NYCHA residents to bring about a class action lawsuit and draft a formal response to the proposal.[6][7]
