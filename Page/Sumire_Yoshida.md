History

Sumire started to take an interest in music because of her sister who was 10 years older than her and was a music lover. Her sister was a vocalist in a band. Seeing her sister work hard for the band, she admired her sister's dedication towards her band. Being inspired by her sister, she started learning piano from grade school onward.

In year 2 of her middle school, she bought her first guitar with the pocket money she had saved. She bought an acoustic guitar which cost _¥10,000._ She started an all-female band in year 1 of her high school with five girls from her class including herself. They did covers of songs from the anime_「K-ON!」_and covered songs of bands such as _MAXIMUM THE HORMONE, Hi-STANDARD, GO!GO!7188._ The band only played at cultural festivals so they didn't perform at any other shows.

In second half of year 2 of her high school, she went to Tokyo. While touring Tokyo, someone took a picture of her for a magazine and they wanted her to enter a modeling agency. She accepted the offer and started modelling for CUTiE. There she met her current band mate, Hinako Umemura (drums) between shots and shared their love for music. They formed the band when Hinako Umemura invited her friends Aina Yamauchi (bass guitar) and Ayana Sōgawa (synthesizer) to meet Sumire in 2010.
