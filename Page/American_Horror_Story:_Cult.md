Production

Development

On October 4, 2016, the series was renewed for a seventh cycle, which premiered on September 5, 2017.[1][2][3] Ryan Murphy confirmed that the season will be connected to _Freak Show_, but will be set in modern day.[4] In February 2017, on _Watch What Happens Live_, Murphy announced that the season would revolve around the 2016 U.S. election and suggested that it may feature a character based on President Donald Trump.[5] Murphy has said that the season will be representative of both sides of the political divide. He also said that he will be "illuminating and highlighting" groups of people he believes to be "ignored by the current [Trump] administration and who are afraid and feel terrorized that their lives are going to be taken away."[6]

It was later confirmed that the season would be set in the aftermath of the presidential election, with the first episode taking place on election night.[7][8] Murphy explained it will be about "the fallout of that night, which to many people, from all sides of the camps is a horror story."[9] He also revealed the season would not feature Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, stating "_Horror Story_ is always about allegory, so the election is allegory."[10] In April 2017, Murphy confirmed that archive footage of the election night would be used in the season premiere.[11]

Murphy revealed via Twitter that the details of the seventh season, including the title, would be revealed on July 20.[12] He also teased that the opening sequence of the series would return in this season, following its absence in _Roanoke_.[13]

On July 20, 2017, it was announced at the San Diego Comic-Con that the title of the season would be _Cult_. Murphy also revealed it would be set in Michigan, and confirmed it would consist of a total of 11 episodes, premiering on September 5, 2017. For the first time, the series did not air on Wednesdays but rather on Tuesdays. On August 3, 2017, online posters revealed the names of multiple characters of the season.[14] On August 21, 2017, the opening title sequence of the season was revealed, following its absence in the previous season.[15] That same month, Murphy confirmed that, contrary to the past seasons, _Cult_ would not feature supernatural elements.[16]

Casting

During the Winter 2017 TCA Press Tour, series mainstays Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters were reported to be starring as the leads in the season.[17][18] In March 2017, _Billy on the Street_ host Billy Eichner was announced to be cast in the series, playing a role in the life of Paulson's character.[19][20] His character is slated for appearing in "six or seven" episodes.[21] The next month, it was reported that _Scream Queens_ alum Billie Lourd will also star in the seventh installment of the series.[22][23] In May 2017, Leslie Grossman, who starred in Murphy's series _Popular_, joined the cast of the series,[24] and Angela Bassett hinted she may return in a recurring role.[25] Despite this, Bassett didn't appear, but she did direct the episode "Drink the Kool-Aid". Later that month, it was confirmed via set pictures that Adina Porter and Cheyenne Jackson were also returning.[26][27] In June 2017, Murphy confirmed via his Instagram account that Colton Haynes, whom Murphy worked with previously on second season of _Scream Queens_, was joining the casting for the seventh season.[28] Later that month, set pictures revealed that Alison Pill was joining the cast of the season, seemingly portraying the partner of Sarah Paulson's character.[29] In July 2017, Murphy revealed via his Twitter account that Lena Dunham was joining the season.[30] She is set to play Valerie Solanas, author of the _SCUM Manifesto_ and attempted murder of Andy Warhol, via flashbacks.[31] Murphy also confirmed the returns of Frances Conroy and Mare Winningham. Conroy has appeared in all the seasons except _Hotel_, while Winningham has appeared in _Coven_, _Freak Show_ and _Hotel_.[32] In August 2017, Murphy confirmed the return of Emma Roberts, who appeared in _Coven_ and _Freak Show_,[33] while _Roanoke_ actors Chaz Bono and James Morosini also confirmed their returns.[34] In the seventh episode, _Murder House_, _Coven_ and _Freak Show_ actress alum Jamie Brewer returned to the show.

On June 26, 2017, it was confirmed that Lady Gaga would not return for the seventh season due to other projects.[35] Despite rumors, _Entertainment Weekly_ reported on July 7, 2017, that Vera Farmiga, sister of _American Horror Story_ alum Taissa Farmiga, would not appear in the season.[36] Later that month, it was confirmed by _The Hollywood Reporter_ that Kathy Bates will not appear in _Cult_, after four seasons of regular appearances.[37]

Murphy also revealed via his Instagram account that _Freak Show_ character Twisty the Clown would return in the seventh season, indicating that John Carroll Lynch would reprise his role.[38]

Filming

In February 2017, it was announced the season would begin principal photography in June 2017.[39] By the next month, filming was moved to May 2017.[40] On May 24, 2017, writer and producer John J. Gray confirmed the show started filming.[41]

Edits

On October 7, 2017, it was confirmed that the sixth episode of the season would be edited as a direct result of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting that occurred on October 1, 2017. The episode originally featured a scene lasting 2 minutes and 16 seconds where Leslie Grossman's character Meadow Wilton begins to fire at Evan Peters' character, as well as a crowd, during a campaign speech. The episode was edited to de-emphasize the violence and to mostly have it featured completely off-screen[42] - as a result the opening sequence of the episode was cut in half, several on-screen deaths were removed and two separate close-up shots of the handgun firing were removed.[43]

While only the edited episode was broadcast on FX, the original uncut episode was released via VOD, FXNOW and FX+.[44]


Reception

Critical response

_American Horror Story: Cult_ received mostly positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the season a 74% approval rating, with an average rating of 7.05/10, based on 47 reviews. The site's consensus reads, "_American Horror Story: Cult_ intrigues with timely, over-the-top creepiness - and lots of clowns - despite being hampered by broad political generalizations and occasional holes in the narrative's logic."[45] On Metacritic, the season was given a score of 66 out of 100 based on 24 reviews, indicating "generally positive reviews".[46]

Awards and nominations

In its seventh season, the series has been nominated for 25 awards, 3 of them were won.
