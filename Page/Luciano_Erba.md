Life and career

Born in Milan, in 1947 Erba graduated in French literature at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore.[1][2] A member of the so-called "Linea Lombarda" movement, he debuted as a poet in 1951 with the collection _Linea K._; his style was characterized from a realistic and everyday approach which was at the same time also metaphoric and hermetic.[3][4]

During his career Erba was the recipient of numerous award, including the Viareggio Prize for Poetry in 1980 for _Il prato piu verde_ and _Il nastro di Moebius_, the Bagutta Prize in 1988 for _II tranviere metafisico_, the PEN Award in 1995 for _L'ipotesi circense_.[5]

Erba was lecturer in several universities, including his alma mater. He collaborated as a literary critic to various publications, including _Itinerari_, _La Fiera Letteraria_,_Il Verri_ and _The Western Review_, and was active as a translator from French and English languages.[6][7]
