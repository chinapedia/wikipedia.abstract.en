_MOONIE_ is a pejorative term sometimes used to refer to members of the Unification movement, also known as the Unification Church. It is derived from the name of the movement's founder Sun Myung Moon,[1] and was first used in 1974 by the American media.[2] Members have used the word "Moonie", including: Moon himself,[3] President of the Unification Theological Seminary David Kim,[4] and Moon's aide and president of The Little Angels Children's Folk Ballet of Korea Bo Hi Pak.[5] In the 1980s and 1990s, the Unification Church of the United States undertook an extensive public relations campaign against the use of the word by the news media.[6] Journalistic authorities, including _The New York Times_ and Reuters, now discourage its use in news reporting.[7][8] In other contexts, it is still sometimes used and not always considered pejorative.[9][10]


Background

The word "Moonie" is derived from the name of Sun Myung Moon, the founder and leader of the Unification movement.[11][12][13] Some dictionaries mention that it is considered an offensive word.[14][15] The _Dictionary of the Modern Politics of Japan_ describes it as a colloquial term.[16] Secondary meanings include: "Any blind, unthinking, unquestioning follower of a philosophy".[17][18][19]

The word "Moonie" is also a family name in the United Kingdom. The town of Moonie, Queensland in Australia was founded in 1840.[20] It is also a common nickname in English-speaking countries.[21][22][23] In more recent times, it has also been used to refer to fans of the Japanese anime franchise _Sailor Moon_.[24] In 2009, _The Daily Telegraph_ suggested that the Manchester City football club be nicknamed "The Blue Moonies" for their "evangelical zeal."[25] In 2010, _The New York Times_ noted that the word "Moonie" was being used in Washington D.C. to denote that someone was a "swooning loyalist."[26] The _Denver Post_ reported that supporters of conservative congressional candidate Dan Maes were being called "Maes moonies" for their "almost cultish" devotion to him.[27] In 2016, _The Jerusalem Post_ used the word "moonies" to refer to followers of United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.[28]


History

Early use

The word "Moonie" was first used by the American news media in the 1970s when Sun Myung Moon moved to the United States and came to public notice through a series of public speeches he gave, including at Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1974 and at Yankee Stadium and on the grounds of the Washington Monument in 1976.[29][30][31] It became prevalent and was used by both critics of the Unification movement[32] and movement members themselves.[33] In 1982, a report sponsored in part by Auburn University noted: "In informal interviews with U.C. members have indicated that they do not consider the term 'Moonie' derogatory."[34]

In the 1970s and early 1980s, the word "Moonie" was used by Unification movement members both within the movement and in public[35][36] as a self-designation,[37][38] and "as a badge of honor".[39] Members could be seen on subways in New York wearing T-shirts that read: "I'm a Moonie and I love it".[40] Religious scholar Anson Shupe notes that "on many occasions," he heard "David Kim, President of the Unification Theological Seminary, refer to 'Moonie theology,' the 'Moonie lifestyle,' and so forth matter-of-factly".[41]

The principal aide to Moon, Bo Hi Pak, was quoted by Carlton Sherwood in his book _Inquisition: The Persecution and Prosecution of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon_ as declaring to the United States Congress: "I am a proud Korean – a proud 'Moonie' – and a dedicated anti-Communist and I intend to remain so the rest of my life."[42] Moon himself declared: "In two and a half years the word 'Moonie' shall become an honorable name and we will have demonstrations and victory celebrations from coast to coast."[43]

During the proceedings of United States v. Sun Myung Moon in 1982, federal prosecutors argued that the word "Moonie" be banned during the jury selection process because they said it was considered "a negative term," and prejudicial in nature. Defense counsel for Moon instead asserted use of the word in the jury selection process was necessary to identify the Unification movement and to question jurors about possible prejudice. Judge Gerard L. Goettel denied the prosecution's request, and ruled that the word was appropriately "descriptive."[44][45]

British sociologist Eileen Barker titled her 1984 book, which was based on seven years of first-person study of members of the Unification movement in the United States and Great Britain and has been influential in the field of the sociology of religion, _The Making of a Moonie: Choice or Brainwashing?_.[46]

Response by church members

In 1984, _The Washington Post_ noted, "Members of the Unification Church resent references to them as 'Moonies'", and quoted one church member who said, "Even in quotation marks, it's derogatory".[47] In 1985, the president of the Unification Church of the United States, Mose Durst, said: "In one year, we moved from being a pariah to being part of the mainstream. People recognized that Reverend Moon was abused for his religious beliefs and they rallied around. You rarely hear the word 'Moonie' anymore. We're 'Unificationists.'"[48] In 1987, civil rights activist Ralph Abernathy, who was also the vice president of the Unification Church-affiliated American Freedom Coalition and served on boards of directors for two other related organizations, equated the word "Moonie" with the word "nigger".[49][50][51][52]

In 1989, the _San Francisco Chronicle_ reported that members preferred to be called "Unificationists."[53] _The Washington Post_ reported that "Unification Church members are being advised no longer to accept the designation of 'Moonie,' and to declare any such nomenclature as indicative of a prejudiced view of the church."[54] In 1989, the _Chicago Tribune_ was picketed after referring to members as Moonies.[55][56] Moon directed minister and civil rights leader James Bevel to form a protest by religious officials against the _Chicago Tribune_ because of the newspaper's use of the word. Bevel handed out fliers at the protest which said: "Are the Moonies our new niggers?"[57]

In 1990, a position paper sent from the Unification movement to _The Fresno Bee_ said: "We will fight gratuitous use of the 'Moonie' or 'cult' pejoratives. We will call journalists on every instance of unprofessional reporting. We intend to stop distortions plagiarized from file clippings which propagate from story to story like a computer virus."[58] In 1992, Michael Jenkins (who later became president of the Unification Church of the United States[59]) commented: "Why, after so many years, should we now be taking such a stand to eliminate the term 'Moonie?' For me, it is a sign that the American Unification Church has come of age. We can no longer allow our founder, our members, and allies to be dehumanized and unfairly discriminated against. ... We are now entering a period of our history where our Church development and family orientation are strong enough that we can turn our attention toward ending the widespread misunderstanding about our founder and the Unification movement."[60]

In 1992, Unification movement member Kristopher Esplin told Reuters what is normally done if the word is seen in media sources: "If it's printed in newspapers, we will respond, write to the editor, that sort of thing."[61] On an October 6, 1994 broadcast of _Nightline_, host Ted Koppel stated: "On last night's program ...I used the term 'Moonies'. This is a label which members of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church find demeaning and offensive, and I'd like to apologize for its use."[62]

In its entry on "Unification Church", the 2002 edition of _The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage_ advised: "Unification Church is appropriate in all references to the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity, which was founded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon. Do not use the disparaging _Moonie(s)_".[63] Reuters, in its handbook for journalists, says: "'Moonie' is a pejorative term for members of the Unification Church. We should not use it in copy and avoid it when possible in direct quotations."[64]

In a 1996 article for _The Independent_ about a talk former Prime Minister Edward Heath gave at a Unification movement-sponsored conference, Andrew Brown commented: "The term 'Moonie' has entered the language as meaning a brainwashed, bright-eyed zombie." Brown also quoted William Shaw, a broadcaster who was presenting the Cult Fiction series on BBC Radio Five Live: "Most Moonies embrace a morality which would make them acceptable in the most genteel Anglican social circle."[65] In 2010, _National Public Radio_, in a story on "second generation" members, reported that they "bristle at the term 'Moonie'",[66] while _USA Today_ reported on "the folks who follow Rev. Sun Myung Moon (also known, to their dislike, as the Moonies)."[67]


Research and commentary

A 1992 study by Jeffrey E. Pfeifer of the University of Virginia on "The Psychological Framing of Cults" found that 75.51% (74 of 98) of participating individuals were familiar with the word "Moonies". Dr. Pfeifer sums up his findings by saying:[68]

    Subjects were asked to read a description of a young man who joins a group and is exposed to its indoctrination process. Depending on the condition, subjects were led to believe that the group was either the Moonies, the Marines, or the Catholic Church. Except for the group label, in all three conditions the description of the indoctrination process was identical. Subjects were then asked to evaluate both the group's indoctrination techniques and the individual who joined the group, and to complete a questionnaire regarding their general knowledge of cults. Results indicate that subject ratings are significantly affected by the group label and that general knowledge regarding cults is based primarily on indirect sources.

In the 1995 book _America's Alternative Religions_, published by the State University of New York Press, Baker wrote: "Although they prefer to be called Unificationists, they are referred to in the media and popularly known as 'Moonies'."[69] In the same book, sociologists Anson Shupe and David Bromley, both noted for their studies of new religious movements, also use the word "Moonies" to refer to members of the Unification Church.[70] In his 1998 book _Religion, Mobilization, and Social Action_, Shupe notes that Barker, Bromley, and he himself had used the term in other publications, "and meant no offense".[71]

In his 2000 book _Mystics and Messiahs_, Philip Jenkins likens the term to "smear words such as Shaker, Methodist, Mormon". Jenkins mentions use of the word in book titles including _Life among the Moonies_ and _Escape from the Moonies_, and comments: "These titles further illustrate how the derogatory term 'Moonie' became a standard for members of this denomination, in a way that would have been inconceivable for any of the insulting epithets that could be applied to, say, Catholics or Jews."[72]
