ISA SEDIGH, () also known as SEDIGH ALAM or SADIQ AÊ¿LAM (meaning "the knowledgeable Sadiq"), was minister of education in Iran, and the third president of the University of Tehran.[1]


Early life and education

Isa Sedigh was born in June 1894 in _Hammam Ghebleh_, Tehran. His father Mirza Abdollah Shamloo, also known as Abdollah Sedigh Al-Tojar Isfahani, was a grandson of Mirza Mehdi Khan Astarabadi.[2]

Isa Sedigh finished his undergraduate education in Kamalieh School and Dar ul-Funun. After finishing school, he traveled to France with the first student expedition in 1911. In 1918, he completed his education in Versailles, Yvelines, receiving his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Paris.[3]

In 1930, upon receiving an invitation to study at Teachers College, Columbia University, Sedigh went to United States and, after one year, received his doctorate in Philosophy.[4]


Career

Isa Sedigh was a member of the Socialist Party. He worked in the University of Cambridge as an assistant teacher of professor Edward Granville Browne in Persian literature. After returning to France, he made Persian one of his foreign languages classes, which students could choose as their foreign language course.[5]

While Iran was under attack by the Russian empire, Sedigh wrote many related articles in The Times.

He returned to Iran in 1918; just after his arrival, he was selected as inspector of schools. He worked as the head of the education organization of Gilan Province.[6]

In 1921, he received the title of _Sedigh Alam_ from Ahmad Shah Qajar per Samad Khan Momtaz os-Saltaneh's request.

He was a member of the Iranian constituent assembly when it officially began in 1921.

When Ali-Akbar Davar founded the Radical party, Sedigh was selected as vice president.

During his education in Columbia University, Abdolhossein Teymourtash asked Sedigh to plan the founding of a _Dar ul-Funun_ (university) in Tehran. (Isa used the word _Daneshgah_ (meaning a university) instead of _Dar ul-Funun_ (meaning a complex institute for teaching various courses)) After returning to Iran in 1931, Reza Shah commanded him to found the University of Tehran.[7]

He was selected as minister of education in Mohammad Ali Foroughi's first cabinet on September 21, 1941. Two years later, he was selected again for this position in Ali Soheili's cabinet.
