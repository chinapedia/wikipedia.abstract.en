STEN TURE JENSEN (born April 29, 1956) is a Norwegian editor and investor, originally from Alsvåg in the municipality of Øksnes and living in Oslo.

In 1976, at the age of 20, he was appointed by magazine-owner Leif Hagen to become the editor of Norway's first pornographic magazine, _Aktuell Rapport_.[1] He was the editor of _Alle Menn_ from 1979 to 1984.[2][3] He was later involved in publishing the softcore pornographic magazines _Lek_ and _Cocktail_.[4]

Jensen was one of the creators of the company Media Holding, which was listed on the stock exchanged in 1997. Media Holding created a stock market bubble, earning the founders, including Jensen, large amounts of money. The company was declared bankrupt in 1999[5] but reemerged in 2000, when it turned out that there was still value left in it. Since then, Jensen has worked as a property investor in Thailand.[6] He has also established a legal and auditing firm in Myanmar.[7]
