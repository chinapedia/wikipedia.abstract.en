The ISINYA–SINGIDA HIGH VOLTAGE POWER LINE is a high voltage electricity power line, under construction, connecting the high voltage substation at Isinya, Kenya to another high voltage substation at Singida, Tanzania.[1]


Location

The power line starts at Isinya, in Kajiado County, about south of Nairobi,[2] and runs in a southerly direction for approximately to the border with Tanzania at Namanga.[3]

At Namanga the power line crosses into Tanzania and follows a southerly direction to Arusha, a distance of about from Namanga.[4] From Arusha the line travels in a south-westerly direction for about to end at Singida.[5] According to the African Development Bank, of the line are located in Kenya and are located in Tanzania, for total length of .[6]


Overview

As far back as 2015, Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia began to explore the amount of electricity that can be moved along high voltage power lines linking the three countries. The objective was to exchange electricity between the Eastern Africa Power Pool to which both Kenya and Tanzania belong, and the Southern African Power Pool to which Tanzania ad Zambia belong. Each country would build and maintain the infrastructure within its borders.[7] Kenya and Tanzania sought a joint consultant to advise of the project.[8] A joint Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) in both countries was carried out in 2014, funded by the African Development Bank (AfDB).[9]


Construction in Kenya

In October 2017, Ketraco, the Kenyan electricity transportation monopoly awarded the construction contract for a 400kV substation at Isinya and the 400kV high tension line from Isinya to Namanga, to _North China Power Engineering Company Limited_ (NCPE).[10] The work will be jointly financed by Kenyan government at US$4.25 million and the AfDB which will offer US$22.42 million in loans. Construction is expected to take 22 months.[11]


Construction in Tanzania

The work in Tanzania involves the construction of approximately of double circuit high tension power lines, from Namanga, through Arusha to Singida, a 400kV substation in Arusha and another 400kV substation in Singida. The work is budgeted at US$258.82 million.[12]

The section between Singida and Babati was contracted to _Kalpataru Power Transmission Limited_ of India. The Babati to Arusha section was contracted to _Bouygues Energies & Services_ of France. Kenya is expected to establish a 400kV connection to Ethiopia, while Tanzania is expected to establish a similar 400kV connection to Zambia. This will enable seamless power sales between the four countries.[13]
