JAMIE CARL THOMAS (born 10 January 1997), is an English-born Welsh professional footballer. He has also represented Wales internationally at under-19 level.


Club career

Born in Blackpool, Lancashire, Thomas started his career with local club Blackpool where he spent eight years before transferring to Bolton Wanderers to start his two-year scholarship.[1] In his first year scholar, playing in the under 18 Premier League, Thomas scored 17 goals and in his second year scholar he scored 15 goals. After completing his two-year scholarship, he was rewarded with another one-year extension to his scholarship in May 2015.[2] In April 2016, he was thrown into first-team action featuring as an unused substitute for Championship matches against Cardiff City and Hull City.[3] At the end of the 2015–16 campaign he was released from the club as Bolton were relegated to League One.[4]

Following his release from Bolton, he joined newly promoted Premier League side Burnley on a two-year contract to play for the Development Squad.[5] In July 2016, he was sent out on loan to Scottish Championship side Ayr United on a six-month loan deal,[6] however the loan was cut short in October after Ayr manager Ian McCall deemed that Thomas' game time would be limited.[7] On 11 April 2018, Burnley announced the releasing of the forward to the end of the season 2017/2018.[8]


International career

Despite being born in England, Thomas qualifies to represent Wales through his parentage. In August 2014, he received his first call-up to international duty for the under-19 side, for an international friendly double-header against Montenegro.[9] He went on to start the game and scored on his debut in a 3–1 win, and followed it up with another goal in the reverse fixture which Wales won again 2–1.[10][11] He went on to feature in all of the qualifiers for the 2015 UEFA European Under-19 Championship against Portugal, Denmark and Albania as Wales failed to qualify, scoring twice in six games.[12]
