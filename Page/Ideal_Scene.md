_IDEAL SCENE_ is an album by the American jazz saxophonist Lee Konitz and his Quartet recorded in 1986 and released on the Italian Soul Note label.[1]


Critical reception

The AllMusic review by Scott Yanow states, "The subtle but swinging music is harmonically advanced and full of surprising twists; no predictable bebop here. More than most members of his musical generation, Lee Konitz has continued to keep his music and improvising style fresh and enthusiastic while retaining his own original musical personality through the years".[2]
