It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.[1] At the time of its nomination the district consisted of 57 resources, including 39 contributing buildings, and 18 noncontributing buildings.[2] The district cover's most of the city's central business district, mainly along Grand Avenue, but on some of the intersecting streets as well. In addition to commercial buildings, the district also includes the post office, a theater, and a fraternal lodge. The commercial Romanesque Revival and Neoclassical styles are dominate. The period of significance begins in 1913 when a building boom of more "modern" construction began and ends in 1935. A fire started by fireworks destroyed nearly two full blocks, and affected 70 businesses and professional offices.[3] The architects who designed the new buildings went for a unified approach utilizing a Spanish/Mission influence. The Iowa Legislature passed a law banning the sale of fireworks throughout the state.
