SAND CREEK is a stream in Henry County in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] It is a tributary of Tebo Creek.

The stream headwaters are just east of Missouri Route 13 about two miles south of Shawnee Mound (at ) and the stream flows southeast to cross Missouri Route 52 just west of Calhoun. The stream is impounded as a small lake west of Calhoun. From there the stream flows south then east to its confluence with Tebo Creek (at ).[2][3]

The stream was originally named _Little Tebo Creek_, but was renamed Sand Creek to avoid confusion. The name was chosen due to the presence of a large sand dune or sand bar along its course.[4]
