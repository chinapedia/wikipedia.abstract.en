ASTRONOMICAL YEAR NUMBERING is based on AD/CE year numbering, but follows normal decimal integer numbering more strictly. Thus, it has a year 0; the years before that are designated with negative numbers and the years after that are designated with positive numbers.[1] Astronomers use the Julian calendar for years before 1582, including the year 0, and the Gregorian calendar for years after 1582, as exemplified by Jacques Cassini (1740),[2] Simon Newcomb (1898)[3] and Fred Espenak (2007).[4]

The prefix AD and the suffixes CE, BC or BCE (Common Era, Before Christ or Before Common Era) are dropped.[5] The year 1 BC/BCE is numbered 0, the year 2 BC is numbered −1, and in general the year _n_ BC/BCE is numbered "−(_n_ − 1)"[6] (a negative number equal to 1 − _n_). The numbers of AD/CE years are not changed and are written with either no sign or a positive sign; thus in general _n_ AD/CE is simply _n_ or +_n_.[7] For normal calculation a number zero is often needed, here most notably when calculating the number of years in a period that spans the epoch; the end years need only be subtracted from each other.

The system is so named due to its use in astronomy. Few other disciplines outside history deal with the time before year 1, some exceptions being dendrochronology, archaeology and geology, the latter two of which use 'years before the present'. Although the absolute numerical values of astronomical and historical years only differ by one before year 1, this difference is critical when calculating astronomical events like eclipses or planetary conjunctions to determine when historical events which mention them occurred.


Year zero usage

In his Rudolphine Tables (1627), Johannes Kepler used a prototype of year zero which he labeled _Christi_ (Christ's) between years labeled _Ante Christum_ (Before Christ) and _Post Christum_ (After Christ) on the mean motion tables for the Sun, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury.[8] In 1702, the French astronomer Philippe de la Hire used a year he labeled at the end of years labeled _ante Christum_ (BC), and immediately before years labeled _post Christum_ (AD) on the mean motion pages in his _Tabulæ Astronomicæ_, thus adding the designation _0_ to Kepler's _Christi_.[9] Finally, in 1740 the French astronomer Jacques Cassini , who is traditionally credited with the invention of year zero,[10][11][12] completed the transition in his _Tables astronomiques_, simply labeling this year _0_, which he placed at the end of Julian years labeled _avant Jesus-Christ_ (before Jesus Christ or BC), and immediately before Julian years labeled _après Jesus-Christ_ (after Jesus Christ or AD).[13]

Cassini gave the following reasons for using a year 0:[14]

Fred Espanak of NASA lists 50 phases of the moon within year 0, showing that it is a full year, not an instant in time.[15] Jean Meeus gives the following explanation:[16]


Signed years without year 0

Although he used the usual French terms "avant J.-C." (before Jesus Christ) and "après J.-C." (after Jesus Christ) to label years elsewhere in his book, the Byzantine historian Venance Grumel used negative years (identified by a minus sign, −) to label BC years and unsigned positive years to label AD years in a table. He did so possibly to save space and put no year 0 between them.[17]

Version 1.0 of the XML Schema language, often used to describe data interchanged between computers in XML, includes built-in primitive datatypes DATE and DATETIME. Although these are defined in terms of ISO 8601 which uses the proleptic Gregorian calendar and therefore should include a year 0, the XML Schema specification states that there is no year zero. Version 1.1 of the defining recommendation realigned the specification with ISO 8601 by including a year zero, despite the problems arising from the lack of backward compatibility.[18]
