AMAZONITE, also known as AMAZONSTONE,[1] is a green tectosilicate mineral, a variety of the potassium feldspar called microcline.[2][3] Its chemical formula is (KAlSi₃O₈),[4][5] which is polymorphic to Orthoclase.

Its name is taken from that of the Amazon River, from which certain green stones were formerly obtained, but it is doubtful whether green feldspar occurs in the Amazon area.[6] Although it has been used for over two thousand years, as attested by archaeological finds in Egypt and Mesopotamia, no ancient or medieval authority mentions it. It was first described as a distinct mineral only in the 18th century.[7]

Because of its bright green color, amazonite is occasionally cut and used as a gemstone.[8]


Occurrence

Amazonite is a mineral of limited occurrence. Formerly it was obtained almost exclusively from the area of Miass in the Ilmensky Mountains, 50 miles southwest of Chelyabinsk, Russia, where it occurs in granitic rocks.[9]

Amazonite is now known to occur in various places around the globe. Those places are, among others;

China:

-   Baishitouquan granite intrusion, Hami Prefecture, Xinjiang: found in granite.[10][11]

Libya:

-   Jabal Eghei, Tibesti Mountains: found in granitic rocks.[12]

United States:

-   Colorado:
    -   Deer Trail, Arapahoe County.[13]^(:233)
    -   Custer County.[14]^(:234)
    -   Devils Head, Douglas County.[15]^(:234)
    -   Pine Creek, Douglas County.[16]^(:234)
    -   Crystal Park, El Paso County.[17]^(:234)
    -   Pike's Peak, El Paso County: found in coarse granites or pegmatite.[18]
    -   St. Peter's Dome, El Paso County.[19]^(:234)
    -   Tarryall Mountains, Park County.[20]^(:235)
    -   Crystal Peak, Teller County.[21]^(:235)
-   Virginia:
    -   Morefield Mine, Amelia County: found in pegmatite.[22]
    -   Rutherford Mine, Amelia County.[23]
-   Pennsylvania:
    -   Media, Delaware County.[24]^(:244)
    -   Middletown, Delaware County.[25]^(:244)


Color

For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery.[26] Some people assumed the color was due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors.[27] A 1985 study suggest that the blue-green color results from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar.[28]
