  1980s          Tumor ablation develops.[3]
  1990s          Liver transplantation becomes a standard treatment for certain patients with liver cancer, extending life expectancy for years and sometimes leading to cure.[4]
  2000s          The introduction of sorafenib in considered to mark a new era of liver cancer research and treatments.[5] Obesity is linked to liver cancer deaths.
  Recent years   As of 2010, liver cancer resulted in 754,000 deaths, up from 460,000 in 1990, making it the third leading cause of cancer death after lung and stomach.[6] Current treatment options for liver cancer are surgery, tumor ablation, tumor embolization, radiation therapy, targeted therapy and chemotherapy.[7]
