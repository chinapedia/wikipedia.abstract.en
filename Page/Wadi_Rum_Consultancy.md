The WADI RUM CONSULTANCY of Wadi Rum Organic Farms,[1] is an example of desert greening.[2][3] Begun in 2010, it is located in historic Wadi Rum, in southern Jordan. Overseen by permaculture expert Geoff Lawton, it has established a sustainable agriculture system.

The program has achieved success, primarily, by implementing principles of hydrological and permacultural design.[4][5][6] The results of the consultancy have been documented in photographs, as well as in several videos.[7][8]
