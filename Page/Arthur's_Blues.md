_ARTHUR'S BLUES_ is a live album by saxophonist Art Pepper recorded in 1981 at the Maiden Voyage nightclub in Los Angeles and released on the Galaxy label in 1991.[1][2] The album features tracks that were first released on _The Complete Galaxy Recordings_ box set in 1989.


Reception

The AllMusic review by Stewart Mason noted "the quartet burns through a set of standards and originals that covers Pepper's full range of playing styles ... However, the highlight is the title track, Pepper's last great recording. A 15-minute groove that swings from soulful and funky blues to an intense climax, "Arthur's Blues" puts to rest the rumors that Art Pepper's chops had deserted him in his final years".[3]
