Rajadurai (Vijayakumar) is a wealthy man and highly respected figure in his village. He has a spoiled daughter named Parvathi (Sri Parvathi). Venkatraman (Janagaraj) is a newly appointed Tamil teacher of a college in Rajadurai's village. Unlike other teachers, students like his way of teaching and friendly approach. Parvathi really appreciates Venkatraman and she has private tuitions with the teacher. Venkatraman is married to Gayathri (Srividya), they have a son named Siva (Saravanan).

Siva is a short-tempered person who cannot tolerate injustice. While studying in college, he beat up the minister's son who raped his classmate and was later expelled from the college. Afterwards, his father found him a job in a newspaper company. One day, the company owner (MLA Thangaraj) cut the finger of a poor labourer in front of Siva. Siva, in turn, cut the owner's finger and was sent to jail.

Siva comes back from jail and goes back to his parents. At his arrival, Parvathi clashes with Siva, their bickering continues everytime they meet. Siva later becomes the manager company of Rajadurai's company. Siva and Parvathi slowly fall in love with each other.
