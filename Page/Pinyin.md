HANYU PINYIN (), often abbreviated to PINYIN, is the official romanization system for Standard Chinese in mainland China and to some extent in Taiwan. It is often used to teach Standard Mandarin Chinese, which is normally written using Chinese characters. The system includes four diacritics denoting tones. Pinyin without tone marks is used to spell Chinese names and words in languages written with the Latin alphabet, and also in certain computer input methods to enter Chinese characters.

The pinyin system was developed in the 1950s by many linguists, including Zhou Youguang,[1] based on earlier forms of romanizations of Chinese. It was published by the Chinese government in 1958 and revised several times.[2] The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted pinyin as an international standard in 1982,[3] and was followed by the United Nations in 1986.[4] The system was adopted as the official standard in Taiwan in 2009, where it is used for international events rather than for educational or computer-input purposes.[5][6] But "some cities, businesses, and organizations, notably in the south of Taiwan, did not accept this", so it remains one of several rival romanization systems in use.[7]

The word __ () means 'the spoken language of the Han people', while __ () literally means 'spelled sounds'.[8]

The result is that the decoding systems used in some foreign languages will enable non-native speakers to produce sounds more closely resembling the target language than will the coding/decoding system used by other foreign languages. Native speakers of English will decode pinyin spellings to fairly close approximations of Mandarin except in the case of certain speech sounds that are not ordinarily produced by most native speakers of English: _j_ , _q_ _, x_ , _z_ , _c_ , _zh_ , _ch_ , _sh_ , _h_ , and _r_ exhibiting the greatest discrepancies.

In this system, the correspondence between the Roman letter and the sound is sometimes idiosyncratic, though not necessarily more so than the way the Latin script is employed in other languages. For example, the aspiration distinction between _b_, _d_, _g_ and _p_, _t_, _k_ is similar to that of these syllable-initial consonants English (in which the two sets are however also differentiated by voicing), but not to that of French. Letters _z_ and _c_ also have that distinction, pronounced as and (whilst reminiscent of both of them being used for the phoneme in the German language and Latin script-using Slavic languages respectively). From _s, z, c_ come the digraphs _sh, zh, ch_ by analogy with English _sh, ch_. Although this introduces the novel combination _zh_, it is internally consistent in how the two series are related, and reminds the trained reader that many Chinese people pronounce _sh, zh, ch_ as _s, z, c_ (and English-speakers use _zh_ to represent in foreign languages such as Russian anyway). In the _x, j, q_ series, the pinyin use of _x_ is similar to its use in Portuguese, Galician, Catalan, Basque, and Maltese; and the pinyin _q_ is akin to its value in Albanian; both pinyin and Albanian pronunciations may sound similar to the _ch_ to the untrained ear. Pinyin vowels are pronounced in a similar way to vowels in Romance languages.

The pronunciation and spelling of Chinese words are generally given in terms of initials and finals, which represent the _segmental phonemic_ portion of the language, rather than letter by letter. Initials are initial consonants, while finals are all possible combinations of medials (semivowels coming before the vowel), a nucleus vowel, and coda (final vowel or consonant).


History

Background: romanization of Chinese before 1949

In 1605, the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci published __ () in Beijing.[9] This was the first book to use the Roman alphabet to write the Chinese language. Twenty years later, another Jesuit in China, Nicolas Trigault, issued his __ () at Hangzhou.[10] Neither book had much immediate impact on the way in which Chinese thought about their writing system, and the romanizations they described were intended more for Westerners than for the Chinese.[11]

One of the earliest Chinese thinkers to relate Western alphabets to Chinese was late Ming to early Qing dynasty scholar-official, Fang Yizhi (; 1611–1671).[12]

The first late Qing reformer to propose that China adopt a system of spelling was Song Shu (1862–1910). A student of the great scholars Yu Yue and Zhang Taiyan, Song had been to Japan and observed the stunning effect of the _kana_ syllabaries and Western learning there. This galvanized him into activity on a number of fronts, one of the most important being reform of the script. While Song did not himself actually create a system for spelling Sinitic languages, his discussion proved fertile and led to a proliferation of schemes for phonetic scripts.[13]

Wade–Giles

The Wade–Giles system was produced by Thomas Wade in 1859, and further improved by Herbert Giles in the Chinese–English Dictionary of 1892. It was popular and used in English-language publications outside China until 1979.[14]

Sin Wenz

In the early 1930s, Communist Party of China leaders trained in Moscow introduced a phonetic alphabet using Roman letters which had been developed in the Soviet Oriental Institute of Leningrad and was originally intended to improve literacy in the Russian Far East.[15] This Sin Wenz or "New Writing"[16] was much more linguistically sophisticated than earlier alphabets, but with the major exception that it did not indicate tones of Chinese.[17]

In 1940, several thousand members attended a Border Region Sin Wenz Society convention. Mao Zedong and Zhu De, head of the army, both contributed their calligraphy (in characters) for the masthead of the Sin Wenz Society's new journal. Outside the CCP, other prominent supporters included Dr. Sun Yat-sen's son, Sun Fo; Cai Yuanpei, the country's most prestigious educator; Tao Xingzhi, a leading educational reformer; and Lu Xun. Over thirty journals soon appeared written in Sin Wenz, plus large numbers of translations, biographies (including Lincoln, Franklin, Edison, Ford, and Charlie Chaplin), some contemporary Chinese literature, and a spectrum of textbooks. In 1940, the movement reached an apex when Mao's Border Region Government declared that the Sin Wenz had the same legal status as traditional characters in government and public documents. Many educators and political leaders looked forward to the day when they would be universally accepted and completely replace Chinese characters. Opposition arose, however, because the system was less well adapted to writing regional languages, and therefore would require learning Mandarin. Sin Wenz fell into relative disuse during the following years.[18]

Yale romanization

In 1943, the U.S. military engaged Yale University to develop a romanization of Mandarin Chinese for its pilots flying over China. The resulting system is very close to _pinyin_, but does not use English letters in unfamiliar ways; for example, _pinyin_ X for is written as SY in the Yale system. Medial semivowels are written with Y and W (instead of _pinyin_ I and U), and apical vowels (syllabic consonants) with R or Z. Accent marks are used to indicate tone.

Emergence and history of Hanyu Pinyin

Pinyin was created by Chinese linguists, including Zhou Youguang, as part of a Chinese government project in the 1950s. Zhou is often called "the father of pinyin,"[19][20][21][22] Zhou worked as a banker in New York when he decided to return to China to help rebuild the country after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. He became an economics professor in Shanghai, and in 1955, when China's Ministry of Education created a Committee for the Reform of the Chinese Written Language, Premier Zhou Enlai assigned Zhou Youguang the task of developing a new romanization system, despite the fact that he was not a professional linguist.[23]

_Hanyu Pinyin_ was based on several existing systems: _Gwoyeu Romatzyh_ of 1928, _Latinxua Sin Wenz_ of 1931, and the diacritic markings from _zhuyin_ (bopomofo).[24] "I'm not the father of pinyin," Zhou said years later; "I'm the son of pinyin. It's [the result of] a long tradition from the later years of the Qing dynasty down to today. But we restudied the problem and revisited it and made it more perfect."[25]

A draft was published on February 12, 1956. The first edition of _Hanyu Pinyin_ was approved and adopted at the Fifth Session of the 1st National People's Congress on February 11, 1958. It was then introduced to primary schools as a way to teach Standard Chinese pronunciation and used to improve the literacy rate among adults.[26]

Beginning in the early 1980s, Western publications addressing Mainland China began using the Hanyu Pinyin romanization system instead of earlier romanization systems;[27] this change followed the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and the PRC in 1979.[28] In 2001, the PRC Government issued the _National Common Language Law_, providing a legal basis for applying pinyin.[29] The current specification of the orthographic rules is laid down in the National Standard GB/T 16159-2012.[30]


Initials and finals

Unlike European languages, clusters of letters — initials () and finals () — and not consonant and vowel letters, form the fundamental elements in pinyin (and most other phonetic systems used to describe the Han language). Every Mandarin syllable can be spelled with exactly one initial followed by one final, except for the special syllable _er_ or when a trailing _-r_ is considered part of a syllable (see below, and see erhua). The latter case, though a common practice in some sub-dialects, is rarely used in official publications.

Even though most initials contain a consonant, finals are not always simple vowels, especially in compound finals (), i.e. when a "medial" is placed in front of the final. For example, the medials and are pronounced with such tight openings at the beginning of a final that some native Chinese speakers (especially when singing) pronounce _yī_ (, clothes, officially pronounced ) as and _wéi_ (, to enclose, officially pronounced ) as or . Often these medials are treated as separate from the finals rather than as part of them; this convention is followed in the chart of finals below.

¹ _y_ is pronounced (a labial-palatal approximant) before _u_.
² The letters _w_ and _y_ are not included in the table of initials in the official pinyin system. They are an orthographic convention for the medials _i, u_ and _ü_ when no initial is present. When _i, u_, or _ü_ are finals and no initial is present, they are spelled _yi_, _wu_, and _yu_, respectively.

The conventional lexicographical order (excluding _w_ and _y_), derived from the zhuyin system ("bopomofo"), is:

Finals

In each cell below, the first line indicates IPA, the second indicates pinyin for a standalone (no-initial) form, and the third indicates pinyin for a combination with an initial. Other than finals modified by an _-r_, which are omitted, the following is an exhaustive table of all possible finals.¹[31]

The only syllable-final consonants in Standard Chinese are _-n_ and _-ng_, and _-r_, which are attached as a grammatical suffix. A Chinese syllable ending with any other consonant either is from a non-Mandarin language (a southern Chinese language such as Cantonese, or a minority language of China; possibly reflecting final consonants in Old Chinese), or indicates the use of a non-pinyin romanization system (where final consonants may be used to indicate tones).

¹ is written _er_. For other finals formed by the suffix _-r_, pinyin does not use special orthography; one simply appends _r_ to the final that it is added to, without regard for any sound changes that may take place along the way. For information on sound changes related to final _r_, please see Erhua#Rules.
² _ü_ is written as _u_ after _j, q_, or _x_.
³ _uo_ is written as _o_ after _b, p, m, f,_ or _w_.

Technically, _i, u, ü_ without a following vowel are finals, not medials, and therefore take the tone marks, but they are more concisely displayed as above. In addition, _ê_ () and syllabic nasals _m_ (, ), _n_ (, ), _ng_ (, ) are used as interjections.

The _ü_ sound

An umlaut is placed over the letter _u_ when it occurs after the initials _l_ and _n_ when necessary in order to represent the sound [y]. This is necessary in order to distinguish the front high rounded vowel in _lü_ (e.g. ) from the back high rounded vowel in _lu_ (e.g. ). Tonal markers are added on top of the umlaut, as in _lǘ_.

However, the _ü_ is _not_ used in the other contexts where it could represent a front high rounded vowel, namely after the letters _j_, _q_, _x_, and _y_. For example, the sound of the word / (fish) is transcribed in pinyin simply as _yú_, not as _yǘ_. This practice is opposed to Wade–Giles, which always uses _ü_, and _Tongyong Pinyin_, which always uses _yu_. Whereas Wade–Giles needs of using the umlaut to distinguish between _chü_ (pinyin _ju_) and _chu_ (pinyin _zhu_), this ambiguity does not arise with pinyin, so the more convenient form _ju_ is used instead of _jü_. Genuine ambiguities only happen with _nu_/_nü_ and _lu_/_lü_, which are then distinguished by an umlaut.

Many fonts or output methods do not support an umlaut for _ü_ or cannot place tone marks on top of _ü_. Likewise, using _ü_ in input methods is difficult because it is not present as a simple key on many keyboard layouts. For these reasons _v_ is sometimes used instead by convention. For example, it is common for cellphones to use _v_ instead of _ü_. Additionally, some stores in China use _v_ instead of _ü_ in the transliteration of their names. The drawback is that there are no tone marks for the letter _v_.

This also presents a problem in transcribing names for use on passports, affecting people with names that consist of the sound _lü_ or _nü_, particularly people with the surname (_Lǚ_), a fairly common surname, particularly compared to the surnames (Lù), (Lǔ), (Lú) and (Lù). Previously, the practice varied among different passport issuing offices, with some transcribing as "LV" and "NV" while others used "LU" and "NU". On 10 July 2012, the Ministry of Public Security standardized the practice to use "LYU" and "NYU" in passports.[32][33]

Although _nüe_ written as _nue_, and _lüe_ written as _lue_ are not ambiguous, _nue_ or _lue_ are not correct according to the rules; _nüe_ and _lüe_ should be used instead. However, some Chinese input methods (e.g. Microsoft Pinyin IME) support both _nve_/_lve_ (typing _v_ for _ü_) and _nue_/_lue_.

* Note on _y_ and _w_:

_Y_ and _w_ are equivalent to the semivowel medials _i, u_, and _ü_ (see below). They are spelled differently when there is no initial consonant in order to mark a new syllable: _fanguan_ is _fan-guan_, while _fangwan_ is _fang-wan_ (and equivalent to _*fang-uan)_. With this convention, an apostrophe only needs to be used to mark an initial _a, e_, or _o: Xi'an_ (two syllables: ) vs. _xian_ (one syllable: ). In addition, _y_ and _w_ are added to fully vocalic _i, u_, and _ü_ when these occur without an initial consonant, so that they are written _yi, wu_, and _yu_. Some Mandarin speakers do pronounce a or sound at the beginning of such words—that is, _yi_ or , _wu_ or , _yu_ or ,—so this is an intuitive convention. See below for a few finals which are abbreviated after a consonant plus _w/u_ or _y/i_ medial: _wen_ → C+_un_, _wei_ → C+_ui_, _weng_ → C+_ong_, and _you_ → C+_iu_.

** Note on the apostrophe:

The apostrophe (') () is used before a syllable starting with a vowel (, , or ) in a multiple-syllable word when the syllable does not start the word (which is most commonly realized as ), unless the syllable immediately follows a hyphen or other dash.[35] This usage is done to remove ambiguity that could arise, as in _Xi'an_, which consists of the two syllables ("") (""), compared to such words as (""). (This ambiguity does not occur when tone marks are used: the two tone marks in unambiguously show that the word consists of two syllables. However, even with tone marks, the city is usually spelled with an apostrophe as .) This apostrophe is not used in the Taipei Metro names.[36]

Pronunciation of finals

IPA_vowel_chart_2005.png The following is a list of finals in Standard Chinese, excepting most of those ending with _r_.

To find a given final:

1.  Remove the initial consonant. _Zh_, _ch_, and _sh_ count as initial consonants.
2.  Change initial _w_ to _u_ and initial _y_ to _i_. For _weng_, _wen_, _wei_, _you_, look under _ong_, _un_, _ui_, _iu_.
3.  For _u_ after _j_, _q_, _x_, or _y_, look under _ü_.

Tones

Pinyin_Tone_Chart.svg The pinyin system also uses diacritics to mark the four tones of Mandarin. The diacritic is placed over the letter that represents the syllable nucleus, unless that letter is missing (see below).

Many books printed in China use a mix of fonts, with vowels and tone marks rendered in a different font from the surrounding text, tending to give such pinyin texts a typographically ungainly appearance. This style, most likely rooted in early technical limitations, has led many to believe that pinyin's rules call for this practice, e.g. the use of a Latin alpha (Ɑ) rather than the standard style (A) found in most fonts, or G often written with a single-story Ɡ. The rules of _Hanyu Pinyin_, however, specify no such practice.[37]

1.  The first tone (Flat or High Level Tone) is represented by a macron (ˉ) added to the pinyin vowel:

        ā ē ī ō ū ǖ Ā Ē Ī Ō Ū Ǖ

2.  The second tone (Rising or High-Rising Tone) is denoted by an acute accent (ˊ):

        á é í ó ú ǘ Á É Í Ó Ú Ǘ

3.  The third tone (Falling-Rising or Low Tone) is marked by a caron/háček (ˇ). It is not the rounded breve (˘), though a breve is sometimes substituted due to font limitations.

        ǎ ě ǐ ǒ ǔ ǚ Ǎ Ě Ǐ Ǒ Ǔ Ǚ

4.  The fourth tone (Falling or High-Falling Tone) is represented by a grave accent (ˋ):

        à è ì ò ù ǜ À È Ì Ò Ù Ǜ

5.  The fifth tone (Neutral Tone) is represented by a normal vowel without any accent mark:

        a e i o u ü A E I O U Ü



        In dictionaries, neutral tone may be indicated by a dot preceding the syllable; for example, _·ma_. When a neutral tone syllable has an alternative pronunciation in another tone, a combination of tone marks may be used: _zhī·dào_ ().[38]

These tone marks normally are only used in Mandarin textbooks or in foreign learning texts, but they are essential for correct pronunciation of Mandarin syllables, as exemplified by the following classic example of five characters whose pronunciations differ only in their tones:

+-------------------------+
| Traditional characters: |
+-------------------------+
| Simplified characters:  |
+-------------------------+

The words are "mother", "hemp", "horse", "scold", and a question particle, respectively.

Numerals in place of tone marks

Before the advent of computers, many typewriter fonts did not contain vowels with macron or caron diacritics. Tones were thus represented by placing a tone number at the end of individual syllables. For example, _tóng_ is written _tong²_. The number used for each tone is as the order listed above, except the neutral tone, which is either not numbered, or given the number 0 or 5, e.g. _ma⁵_ for ／, an interrogative marker.

Rules for placing the tone mark

Briefly, the tone mark should always be placed by the order—_a, o, e, i, u, ü_, with the only exception being _iu_, where the tone mark is placed on the _u_ instead. Pinyin tone marks appear primarily above the nucleus of the syllable, for example as in _kuài_, where _k_ is the initial, _u_ the medial, _a_ the nucleus, and _i_ the coda. The exception is syllabic nasals like /m/, where the nucleus of the syllable is a consonant, the diacritic will be carried by a written dummy vowel.

When the nucleus is /ə/ (written _e_ or _o_), and there is both a medial and a coda, the nucleus may be dropped from writing. In this case, when the coda is a consonant _n_ or _ng_, the only vowel left is the medial _i, u_, or _ü_, and so this takes the diacritic. However, when the coda is a vowel, it is the coda rather than the medial which takes the diacritic in the absence of a written nucleus. This occurs with syllables ending in _-ui_ (from _wei_: (wèi → -uì) and in _-iu_ (from _you: yòu → -iù_.) That is, in the absence of a written nucleus the finals have priority for receiving the tone marker, as long as they are vowels: if not, the medial takes the diacritic.

An algorithm to find the correct vowel letter (when there is more than one) is as follows:[39]

1.  If there is an _a_ or an _e_, it will take the tone mark
2.  If there is an _ou_, then the _o_ takes the tone mark
3.  Otherwise, the second vowel takes the tone mark

Worded differently,

1.  If there is an _a, e_, or _o_, it will take the tone mark; in the case of _ao_, the mark goes on the _a_
2.  Otherwise, the vowels are _-iu_ or _-ui_, in which case the second vowel takes the tone mark

If the tone is written over an _i_, the tittle above the _i_ is omitted, as in _yī_.

Phonological intuition

The placement of the tone marker, when more than one of the written letters _a, e, i, o_, and _u_ appears, can also be inferred from the nature of the vowel sound in the medial and final. The rule is that the tone marker goes on the spelled vowel that is not a (near-)semi-vowel. The exception is that, for triphthongs that are spelled with only two vowel letters, both of which are the semi-vowels, the tone marker goes on the second spelled vowel.

Specifically, if the spelling of a diphthong begins with _i_ (as in _ia_) or _u_ (as in _ua_), which serves as a near-semi-vowel, this letter does not take the tone marker. Likewise, if the spelling of a diphthong ends with _o_ or _u_ representing a near-semi-vowel (as in _ao_ or _ou_), this letter does not receive a tone marker. In a triphthong spelled with three of _a, e, i, o_, and _u_ (with _i_ or _u_ replaced by _y_ or _w_ at the start of a syllable), the first and third letters coincide with near-semi-vowels and hence do not receive the tone marker (as in _iao_ or _uai_ or _iou_). But if no letter is written to represent a triphthong's middle (non-semi-vowel) sound (as in _ui_ or _iu_), then the tone marker goes on the final (second) vowel letter.

Using tone colors

In addition to tone number and mark, tone color has been suggested as a visual aid for learning. Although there are no formal standards, there are a number of different color schemes in use.

-   Dummitt's color scheme was one of the first to be used. It is tone 1 - red, tone 2 - orange, tone 3 - green, tone 4 - blue, and neutral tone - black.[40]
-   The Unimelb color scheme is tone 1 - blue, tone 2 - green, tone 3 - purple, tone 4 - red, neutral tone - grey
-   The Hanping color scheme is tone 1 - blue, tone 2 - green, tone 3 - orange, tone 4 - red, neutral tone - grey.[41]
-   The Pleco color scheme is tone 1 - red, tone 2 - green, tone 3 - blue, tone 4 - purple, neutral tone - grey
-   The Thomas color scheme is tone 1 - green, tone 2 - blue, tone 3 - red, tone 4 - black, neutral tone - grey

Third tone exceptions

In spoken Chinese, the third tone is often pronounced as a "half third tone", in which the pitch does not rise. Additionally, when two third tones appear consecutively, such as in (nǐhǎo, hello), the first syllable is pronounced with the second tone — this is called tone sandhi. In pinyin, words like "hello" are still written with two third tones (nǐhǎo).


Orthographic rules

Letters

Pinyin differs from other romanizations in several aspects, such as the following:

-   Syllables starting with _u_ are written as _w_ in place of _u_ (e.g., *_uan_ is written as _wan_). Standalone _u_ is written as _wu_.
-   Syllables starting with _i_ are written as _y_ in place of _i_ (e.g., *_ian_ is written as _yan_). Standalone _i_ is written as _yi_.
-   Syllables starting with _ü_ are written as _yu_ in place of _ü_ (e.g., *_üe_ is written as _yue_).
-   _ü_ is written as _u_ when there is no ambiguity (such as _ju_, _qu_, and _xu_), but written as _ü_ when there are corresponding _u_ syllables (such as _lü_ and _nü_). In such situations where there are corresponding _u_ syllables, it is often replaced with _v_ on a computer, making it easier to type on a standard keyboard.
-   When preceded by a consonant, _iou_, _uei_, and _uen_ are simplified as _iu_, _ui_, and _un_ (which do not represent the actual pronunciation).
-   As in zhuyin, what are actually pronounced as _buo_, _puo_, _muo_, and _fuo_ are given a separate representation: _bo_, _po_, _mo_, and _fo_.
-   The apostrophe (') is used before a syllable starting with a vowel (_a_, _o_, or _e_) in a multiple-syllable word when the syllable does not start the word (which is most commonly realized as ), unless the syllable immediately follows a hyphen or other dash.[42] This is done to remove ambiguity that could arise, as in _Xi'an_, which consists of the two syllables _xi_ () _an_ (), compared to such words as _xian_ (). (This ambiguity does not occur when tone marks are used: The two tone marks in "Xīān" unambiguously show that the word consists of two syllables. However, even with tone marks, the city is usually spelled with an apostrophe as "Xī'ān".)
-   _Eh_ alone is written as _ê_; elsewhere as _e_. Schwa is always written as _e_.
-   _zh_, _ch_, and _sh_ can be abbreviated as _ẑ_, _ĉ_, and _ŝ_ (_z_, _c_, _s_ with a circumflex). However, the shorthands are rarely used due to difficulty of entering them on computers and are confined mainly to Esperanto keyboard layouts. Early drafts and some published material used diacritic hooks below instead: __ (_/_), __, __ (__).[43]
-   _ng_ has the uncommon shorthand of _ŋ_ (which was also used in early drafts).
-   Early drafts also contained the letter _ɥ_ or _ч_, borrowed from the Cyrillic script, in place of later _j_. [44]
-   The letter _v_ is unused (except in spelling foreign languages, languages of minority nationalities, and some dialects), despite a conscious effort to distribute letters more evenly than in Western languages. However, sometimes, for ease of typing into a computer, the _v_ is used to replace a _ü_.

Most of the above are used to avoid ambiguity when writing words of more than one syllable in pinyin. For example, _uenian_ is written as _wenyan_ because it is not clear which syllables make up _uenian_; _uen-ian_, _uen-i-an_, and _u-en-i-an_ are all possible combinations whereas _wenyan_ is unambiguous because _we_, _nya_, etc. do not exist in pinyin. See the pinyin table article for a summary of possible pinyin syllables (not including tones).

Words, capitalization, initialisms and punctuation

Although Chinese characters represent single syllables, Mandarin Chinese is a polysyllabic language. Spacing in pinyin is usually based on words, and not on single syllables. However, there are often ambiguities in partitioning a word. _The Basic Rules of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Orthography_ () were put into effect in 1988 by the National Educational Commission () and the National Language Commission ().[45] These rules became a Guobiao standard in 1996[46] and were updated in 2012.[47]

Numbers and words like _gè_ (, each), _měi_ (, each), _mǒu_ (, any), _běn_ (, this), _gāi_ (, that), _wǒ_ (, my, our) and _nǐ_ (, your) are separated from the measure words following them: _liǎng gè rén_ (, two people), _gè guó_ (, every nation), _měi nián_ (, every year), _mǒu gōngchǎng_ (, a certain factory), _wǒ xiào_ (, our school)
    2.  Numbers up to 100 are written as single words: _sānshísān_ (, thirty-three). Above that, the hundreds, thousands, etc. are written as separate words: _jiǔyì qīwàn èrqiān sānbǎi wǔshíliù_ (, nine hundred million, seventy-two thousand, three hundred fifty-six). Arabic numerals are kept as Arabic numerals: _635 fēnjī_ (, extension 635)
    3.  According to 6.1.5.4, the _dì_ () used in ordinal numerals is followed by a hyphen: _dì-yī_ (, first), _dì-356_ (, 356th). The hyphen should not be used if the word in which _dì_ () and the numeral appear does not refer to an ordinal number in the context. For example: _Dìwǔ_ (, a Chinese compound surname).[48][49] The _chū_ () in front of numbers one to ten is written together with the number: _chūshí_ (, tenth day)
    4.  Numbers representing month and day are hyphenated: _wǔ-sì_ (, May fourth), _yīèr-jiǔ_ (, December ninth)
    5.  Words of approximations such as _duō_ (), _lái_ () and _jǐ_ () are separated from numerals and measure words: _yībǎi duō gè_ (, around a hundred); _shí lái wàn gè_ (, around a hundred thousand); _jǐ jiā rén_ (, a few families)
        1.  _Shíjǐ_ (, more than ten) and _jǐshí_ (, tens) are written together: _shíjǐ gè rén_ (, more than ten people); _jǐshí_ (, tens of steel pipes)
    6.  Approximations with numbers or units that are close together are hyphenated: _sān-wǔ tiān_ (, three to five days), _qiān-bǎi cì_ (, thousands of times)
9.  Other FUNCTION WORDS () are separated from other words
    1.  Adverbs (): _hěn hǎo_ (, very good), _zuì kuài_ (, fastest), _fēicháng dà_ (, extremely big)
    2.  Prepositions (): _zài qiánmiàn_ (, in front)
    3.  Conjunctions (): _nǐ hé wǒ_ (, you and I/me), _Nǐ lái háishi bù lái?_ (, Are you coming or not?)
    4.  "Constructive auxiliaries" () such as _de_ (), _zhī_ () and _suǒ_ (): _mànmàn de zou_ (), go slowly)
        1.  A monosyllabic word can also be written together with _de_ (): _wǒ de shū_ / _wǒde shū_ (, my book)
    5.  Modal auxiliaries at the end of a sentence: _Nǐ zhīdào ma?_ (, Do you know?), _Kuài qù ba!_ (, Go quickly!)
    6.  Exclamations and interjections: _À! Zhēn měi!_ (), Oh, it's so beautiful!)
    7.  Onomatopoeia: _mó dāo huòhuò_ (, honing a knife), _hōnglōng yī shēng_ (, rumbling)
10. CAPITALIZATION
    1.  The first letter of the first word in a sentence is capitalized: _Chūntiān lái le._ (, Spring has arrived.)
    2.  The first letter of each line in a poem is capitalized.
    3.  The first letter of a proper noun is capitalized: _Běijīng_ (, Beijing), _Guójì Shūdiàn_ (, International Bookstore), _Guójiā Yǔyán Wénzì Gōngzuò Wěiyuánhuì_ (, National Language Commission)
        1.  On some occasions, proper nouns can be written in all caps: _BĚIJĪNG_, _GUÓJÌ SHŪDIÀN_, _GUÓJIĀ YǓYÁN WÉNZÌ GŌNGZUÒ WĚIYUÁNHUÌ_
    4.  If a proper noun is written together with a common noun to make a proper noun, it is capitalized. If not, it is not capitalized: _Fójiào_ (, Buddhism), _Tángcháo_ (, Tang dynasty), _jīngjù_ (, Beijing opera), _chuānxiōng_ (, Szechuan lovage)
11. INITIALISMS
    1.  Single words are abbreviated by taking the first letter of each character of the word: _BeǐJīng_ (, Beijing) → _BJ_
    2.  A group of words are abbreviated by taking the first letter of each word in the group: _Guójiā Biāozhǔn_ (, Guobiao standard) → _GB_
    3.  Initials can also be indicated using full stops: _Beǐjīng_ → _B.J._, _guójiā biāozhǔn_ → _G.B._
    4.  When abbreviating names, the surname is written fully (first letter capitalized or in all caps), but only the first letter of each character in the given name is taken, with full stops after each initial: _Lǐ Huá_ () → _Lǐ H._ or _LǏ H._, _Zhūgě Kǒngmíng_ () → _Zhūgě K. M._ or _ZHŪGĚ K. M._
12. LINE WRAPPING
    1.  Words can only be split by the character:
        _guāngmíng_ (, bright) → _guāng-
        míng_, not _gu-
        āngmíng_
    2.  Initials cannot be split:
        _Wáng J. G._ () → _Wáng
        J. G._, not _Wáng J.-
        G._
    3.  Apostrophes are removed in line wrapping:
        _Xī'ān_ (, Xi'an) → _Xī-
        ān_, not _Xī-
        'ān_
    4.  When the original word has a hyphen, the hyphen is added at the beginning of the new line:
        _chēshuǐ-mǎlóng_ (, heavy traffic: "carriage, water, horse, dragon") → _chēshuǐ-
        -mǎlóng_
13. HYPHENATION: In addition to the situations mentioned above, there are four situations where hyphens are used.

    1.  Coordinate and disjunctive compound words, where the two elements are conjoined or opposed, but retain their individual meaning: _gōng-jiàn_ (, bow and arrow), _kuài-màn_ (, speed: "fast-slow"), _shíqī-bā suì_ (, 17–18 years old), _dǎ-mà_ (, beat and scold), _Yīng-Hàn_ (, English-Chinese [dictionary]), _Jīng-Jīn_ (, Beijing-Tianjin), _lù-hǎi-kōngjūn_ (, army-navy-airforce).
    2.  Abbreviated compounds (): _gōnggòng guānxì_ (, public relations) → _gōng-guān_ (, PR), _chángtú diànhuà_ (, long-distance calling) → _cháng-huà_ (, LDC).
        Exceptions are made when the abbreviated term has become established as a word in its own right, as in _chūzhōng_ () for _chūjí zhōngxué_ (, junior high school). Abbreviations of proper-name compounds, however, should always be hyphenated: _Běijīng Dàxué_ (, Peking University) → _Běi-Dà_ (, PKU).
    3.  Four-syllable idioms: _fēngpíng-làngjìng_ (), calm and tranquil: "wind calm, waves down"), _huījīn-rútǔ_ (, spend money like water: "throw gold like dirt"), _zhǐ-bǐ-mò-yàn_ (, paper-brush-ink-inkstone [four coordinate words]). (The AA-BB reduplication above is an instance of this.)[50]
        1.  Other idioms are separated according to the words that make up the idiom: _bēi hēiguō_ (, to be made a scapegoat: "to carry a black pot"), _zhǐ xǔ zhōuguān fànghuǒ, bù xǔ bǎixìng diǎndēng_ (, Gods may do what cattle may not: "only the official is allowed to light the fire; the commoners are not allowed to light a lamp")

14. PUNCTUATION
    1.  The Chinese full stop (。) is changed to a western full stop (.)
    2.  The hyphen is a half-width hyphen (-)
    3.  Ellipsis can be changed from 6 dots (......) to 3 dots (...)
    4.  The enumeration comma (、) is changed to a normal comma (,)
    5.  All other punctuation marks are the same as the ones used in normal texts


Comparison with other orthographies

Pinyin is now used by foreign students learning Chinese as a second language.

Pinyin assigns some Latin letters sound values which are quite different from that of most languages. This has drawn some criticism as it may lead to confusion when uninformed speakers apply either native or English assumed pronunciations to words. However, this problem is not limited only to pinyin, since many languages that use the Latin alphabet natively also assign different values to the same letters. A recent study on Chinese writing and literacy concluded, "By and large, pinyin represents the Chinese sounds better than the Wade–Giles system, and does so with fewer extra marks."[51]

Because Pinyin is purely a representation of the sounds of Mandarin, it completely lacks the semantic cues and contexts inherent in Chinese characters. Pinyin is also unsuitable for transcribing some Chinese spoken languages other than Mandarin, languages which by contrast have traditionally been written with Han characters allowing for written communication which, by its unified semanto-phonetic orthography, could theoretically be readable in any of the various vernaculars of Chinese where a phonetic script would have only localized utility.

Usage

Dajia-shuo-Putonghua-2817.jpg is annotated with pinyin, but without tonal marks.]] Pinyin superseded older romanization systems such as Wade–Giles (1859; modified 1892) and postal romanization, and replaced zhuyin as the method of Chinese phonetic instruction in mainland China. The ISO adopted pinyin as the standard romanization for modern Chinese in 1982 (ISO 7098:1982, superseded by ISO 7098:2015). The United Nations followed suit in 1986.[52][53] It has also been accepted by the government of Singapore, the United States's Library of Congress, the American Library Association, and many other international institutions.[54]

The spelling of Chinese geographical or personal names in pinyin has become the most common way to transcribe them in English. Pinyin has also become the dominant method for entering Chinese text into computers in Mainland China, in contrast to Taiwan; where Bopomofo is most commonly used.

Families outside of Taiwan who speak Mandarin as a mother tongue use pinyin to help children associate characters with spoken words which they already know. Chinese families outside of Taiwan who speak some other language as their mother tongue use the system to teach children Mandarin pronunciation when they learn vocabulary in elementary school.[55][56]

Since 1958, pinyin has been actively used in adult education as well, making it easier for formerly illiterate people to continue with self-study after a short period of pinyin literacy instruction.[57]

Pinyin has become a tool for many foreigners to learn Mandarin pronunciation, and is used to explain both the grammar and spoken Mandarin coupled with Chinese characters (). Books containing both Chinese characters and pinyin are often used by foreign learners of Chinese. Pinyin's role in teaching pronunciation to foreigners and children is similar in some respects to furigana-based books (with hiragana letters written above or next to kanji, directly analogous to zhuyin) in Japanese or fully vocalised texts in Arabic ("vocalised Arabic").

The tone-marking diacritics are commonly omitted in popular news stories and even in scholarly works. This results in some degree of ambiguity as to which words are being represented.

Computer input systems

Simple computer systems, able to display only 7-bit ASCII text (essentially the 26 Latin letters, 10 digits, and punctuation marks), long provided a convincing argument for using unaccented pinyin instead of Chinese characters. Today, however, most computer systems are able to display characters from Chinese and many other writing systems as well, and have them entered with a Latin keyboard using an input method editor. Alternatively, some PDAs, tablet computers, and digitizing tablets allow users to input characters graphically by writing with a stylus, with concurrent online handwriting recognition.

Pinyin with accents can be entered with the use of special keyboard layouts or various character map utilities. X keyboard extension includes a "Hanyu Pinyin (altgr)" layout for AltGr-triggered dead key input of accented characters.[58]

Pinyin in Taiwan

Taiwan (Republic of China) adopted _Tongyong Pinyin_, a modification of _Hanyu Pinyin_, as the official romanization system on the national level between October 2002 and January 2009, when it switched to _Hanyu Pinyin_. _Tongyong Pinyin_ ("common phonetic"), a variant of pinyin developed in Taiwan, was designed to romanize languages and dialects spoken on the island in addition to Mandarin Chinese. The Kuomintang (KMT) party resisted its adoption, preferring the _Hanyu Pinyin_ system used in Mainland China and in general use internationally. Romanization preferences quickly became associated with issues of national identity. Preferences split along party lines: the KMT and its affiliated parties in the pan-blue coalition supported the use of Hanyu Pinyin while the Democratic Progressive Party and its affiliated parties in the pan-green coalition favored the use of Tongyong Pinyin.

_Tongyong Pinyin_ was made the official system in an administrative order that allowed its adoption by local governments to be voluntary. A few localities with governments controlled by the KMT, most notably Taipei, Hsinchu, and Kinmen County, overrode the order and converted to _Hanyu Pinyin_ before the January 1, 2009 national-level switch,[59][60] though with a slightly different capitalization convention than mainland China. Most areas of Taiwan adopted Tongyong Pinyin, consistent with the national policy. After 2009 switch, many street signs in Taiwan today still display _Tongyong Pinyin_ but some, especially in northern Taiwan, display _Hanyu Pinyin_. It is still not unusual to see spellings on street signs and buildings derived from the older Wade–Giles, MPS2 and other systems.

The adoption of _Hanyu Pinyin_ as the official romanization system in Taiwan does not preclude the official retention of earlier spellings. International familiarity has led to the retention of the spelling _Taipei_ ("Taibei" in pinyin systems) and even to its continuation in the name of New Taipei, a municipality created in 2010. Personal names on Taiwanese passports honor the choices of Taiwanese citizens, who often prefer the Wade–Giles romanization of their personal names, though the official online conversion tool lists pinyin before other systems. Transition to Hanyu Pinyin in official use is also necessarily gradual. Universities and other government entities retain earlier spellings in long-established names, and budget restraints preclude widespread replacement of signage and stationery in every area. Primary education in Taiwan continues to teach pronunciation using _zhuyin_ (MPS or Mandarin Phonetic Symbols).

Pinyin for other languages

Pinyin-like systems have been devised for other variants of Chinese. Guangdong Romanization is a set of romanizations devised by the government of Guangdong province for Cantonese, Teochew, Hakka (Moiyen dialect), and Hainanese. All of these are designed to use Latin letters in a similar way to pinyin.

In addition, in accordance to the _Regulation of Phonetic Transcription in Hanyu Pinyin Letters of Place Names in Minority Nationality Languages_ () promulgated in 1976, place names in non-Han languages like Mongolian, Uyghur, and Tibetan are also officially transcribed using pinyin in a system adopted by the State Administration of Surveying and Mapping and Geographical Names Committee known as SASM/GNC romanization. The pinyin letters (26 Roman letters, plus ü and ê) are used to approximate the non-Han language in question as closely as possible. This results in spellings that are different from both the customary spelling of the place name, and the pinyin spelling of the name in Chinese:

_Tongyong Pinyin_ was developed in Taiwan for use in rendering not only Mandarin Chinese, but other languages and dialects spoken on the island such as Taiwanese, Hakka, and aboriginal languages.
