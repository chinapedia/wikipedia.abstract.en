FRANÇOIS ROLAND TRUFFAUT (; 6 February 1932 – 21 October 1984) was a French film director, screenwriter, producer, actor, and film critic. He is widely regarded as one of the founders of the French New Wave.[1] In a film career lasting over a quarter of a century, he remains an icon of the French film industry, having worked on over 25 films. Truffaut's film _The 400 Blows_ came to be a defining film of the French New Wave movement, and was followed by four sequels, _Antoine et Colette_, _Stolen Kisses_, _Bed and Board_, and _Love on the Run_, between 1958 and 1979.

Truffaut's 1973 film _Day for Night_ earned him critical acclaim and several accolades, including the BAFTA Award for Best Film and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. His other notable films include _Shoot the Piano Player_ (1960), _Jules and Jim_ (1961), _The Soft Skin_ (1964), _The Wild Child_ (1970), _Two English Girls_ (1971), _The Last Metro_ (1980), and _The Woman Next Door_ (1981).


Early life

Truffaut was born in Paris on 6 February 1932. His mother was Janine de Montferrand. His mother's future husband, Roland Truffaut, accepted him as an adopted son and gave him his surname. He was passed around to live with various nannies and his grandmother for a number of years. It was his grandmother who instilled in him her love of books and music. He lived with his grandmother until her death, when Truffaut was eight years old. It was only after his grandmother's death that he lived with his parents for the first time.[2] The identity of Truffaut's biological father was unknown, though a private detective agency in 1968 revealed that their inquiry into the matter led to a Roland Levy, a Jewish dentist from Bayonne. Truffaut's mother's family disputed the findings but Truffaut himself believed and embraced them.[3]

Truffaut would often stay with friends and try to be out of the house as much as possible. His best friend throughout his youth and until his death was Robert Lachenay, who was the inspiration for the character René Bigey in _The 400 Blows_ and would work as an assistant on some of Truffaut's films. It was the cinema that offered him the greatest escape from an unsatisfying home life. He was eight years old when he saw his first movie, Abel Gance's _Paradis Perdu_ (_Paradise Lost_) from 1939. It was there that his obsession began. He frequently played truant from school and would sneak into theaters because he didn't have enough money for admission. After being expelled from several schools, at the age of fourteen he decided to become self-taught. Two of his academic goals were to watch three movies a day and read three books a week.[4][5]

Truffaut frequented Henri Langlois' Cinémathèque Française where he was exposed to countless foreign films from around the world. It was here that he became familiar with American cinema and directors such as John Ford, Howard Hawks and Nicholas Ray, as well as those of British director Alfred Hitchcock.[6]


Career

André Bazin

After starting his own film club in 1948, Truffaut met André Bazin, who would have great effect on his professional and personal life. Bazin was a critic and the head of another film society at the time. He became a personal friend of Truffaut's and helped him out of various financial and criminal situations during his formative years.[7]

Truffaut joined the French Army in 1950, aged 18, but spent the next two years trying to escape. Truffaut was arrested for attempting to desert the army and incarcerated in military prison. Bazin used his various political contacts to get Truffaut released and set him up with a job at his newly formed film magazine _Cahiers du cinéma_.

_Cahiers du Cinema_

Over the next few years, Truffaut became a critic (and later editor) at _Cahiers_, where he became notorious for his brutal, unforgiving reviews. He was called "The Gravedigger of French Cinema"[8] and was the only French critic not invited to the Cannes Film Festival in 1958. He supported Bazin in the development of one of the most influential theories of cinema itself, the auteur theory.[9]

In 1954, Truffaut wrote an article in _Cahiers du cinéma_ called "Une Certaine Tendance du Cinéma Français" ("A Certain Trend of French Cinema"),[10] in which he attacked the current state of French films, lambasting certain screenwriters and producers, and listing eight directors he considered incapable of devising the kinds of "vile" and "grotesque" characters and storylines that he declared were characteristic of the mainstream French film industry: Jean Renoir, Robert Bresson, Jean Cocteau, Jacques Becker, Abel Gance, Max Ophuls, Jacques Tati and Roger Leenhardt. The article caused a storm of controversy, and also landed Truffaut an offer to write for the nationally circulated, more widely read cultural weekly _Arts-Lettres-Spectacles_. Truffaut would pen more than 500 film articles for that publication over the next four years.

Truffaut later devised the auteur theory, which stated that the director was the "author" of his work; that great directors such as Renoir or Hitchcock have distinct styles and themes that permeate all of their films. Although his theory was not widely accepted then, it gained some support in the 1960s from American critic Andrew Sarris. In 1967, Truffaut published his book-length interview of Hitchcock, _Hitchcock/Truffaut_ (New York: Simon and Schuster).

Short Films

After having been a critic, Truffaut decided to make films of his own. He started out with the short film _Une Visite_ in 1955 and followed that up with _Les Mistons_ in 1957.

_The 400 Blows_

After seeing Orson Welles' _Touch of Evil_ at the Expo 58, he was inspired to make his feature film directorial debut with _The 400 Blows_, which was released in 1959 to much critical and commercial acclaim. Truffaut received a Best Director award from the Cannes Film Festival, the same festival that had banned him only one year earlier.

The film follows the character of Antoine Doinel through his perilous misadventures in school, an unhappy home life and later reform school. The film is highly autobiographical. Both Truffaut and Doinel were only children of loveless marriages; they both committed petty crimes of theft and truancy from the military. Truffaut cast Jean-Pierre Léaud as Antoine Doinel. Léaud was seen as an ordinary boy of 14 who auditioned for the role after seeing a flyer, but interviews filmed after the film's release (one is included on the Criterion DVD of the film) reveal Léaud's natural sophistication and an instinctive understanding of acting for the camera. Léaud and Truffaut collaborated on several films over the years. Their most noteworthy collaboration was the continuation of the Antoine Doinel character in a series of films called "The Antoine Doinel Cycle".

The primary focus of _The 400 Blows_ is on the life of a young character by the name of Antoine Doinel. This film follows this character through his troubled adolescence. He is caught in between an unstable parental relationship and an isolated youth. The film focuses on the real life events of the director, François Truffaut. From birth Truffaut was thrown into an undesired situation. As he was born out of wedlock, his birth had to remain a secret because of the social stigma associated with illegitimacy. He was registered as "A child born to an unknown father" in the hospital records. He was looked after by a nurse for an extended period of time. His mother eventually married and her husband Roland gave his surname, Truffaut, to François.

Although he was legally accepted as a legitimate child, his parents did not accept him. The Truffauts had another child who died shortly after birth. This experience saddened them greatly and as a result they despised François because of the memory of regret that he represented (Knopf 4). He was an outcast from his earliest years, dismissed as an unwanted child. François was sent to live with his grandparents. It wasn't until François's grandmother's death that his parents took him in, much to the dismay of his own mother. The experiences with his mother were harsh. He recalled being treated badly by her but he found comfort in his father's laughter and overall spirit. The relationship with Roland was more comforting than the one with his own mother. François had a very depressing childhood after moving in with his parents. They would leave him alone whenever they would go on vacations. He even recalled memories of being alone during Christmas. Being left alone forced François into a sense of independence, he would often do various tasks around the house in order to improve it such as painting or changing the electric outlets. Sadly, these kind gestures often resulted in a catastrophic event causing him to get scolded by his mother. His father would mostly laugh them off.

_The 400 Blows_ marked the beginning of the French New Wave movement, which gave directors such as Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol and Jacques Rivette a wider audience. The New Wave dealt with a self-conscious rejection of traditional cinema structure. This was a topic on which Truffaut had been writing for years.

_Shoot the Piano Player_

Following the success of _The 400 Blows_, Truffaut featured disjunctive editing and seemingly random voice-overs in his next film _Shoot the Piano Player_ (1960) starring Charles Aznavour. Truffaut has stated that in the middle of filming, he realized that he hated gangsters. But since gangsters were a main part of the story, he toned up the comical aspect of the characters and made the movie more attuned to his liking.

Even though _Shoot the Piano Player_ was much appreciated by critics, it performed poorly at the box office. While the film focused on two of the French New Wave's favorite elements, American film noir and themselves, Truffaut never again experimented as heavily.

_Jules and Jim_ and _The Soft Skin_

In 1962, Truffaut directed his third movie, _Jules and Jim_, a romantic drama starring Jeanne Moreau. The film was very popular and highly influential.

In 1963, Truffaut was approached to direct an American film called _Bonnie and Clyde_, with a treatment written by _Esquire_ journalists, David Newman and Robert Benton intended to introduce the French New Wave to Hollywood. Although he was interested enough to help in script development, Truffaut ultimately declined, but not before interesting Jean-Luc Godard and American actor and would be producer, Warren Beatty, the latter of whom proceeded with the film with director Arthur Penn.

His fourth movie as director was _The Soft Skin_ (1964) which was not well acclaimed on initial release.

_Fahrenheit 451_

Truffaut's first non-French film was a 1966 adaptation of Ray Bradbury's classic science fiction novel _Fahrenheit 451_, showcasing Truffaut's love of books. His only English-speaking film made on location in England was a great challenge for Truffaut, because he barely spoke English himself. This was also his first film shot in color by genius cinematographer Nicolas Roeg. The larger scale production was difficult for Truffaut, who had worked only with small crews and budgets. The shoot was also strained by a conflict with lead actor Oscar Werner who was unhappy with his character and stormed off set leaving Truffaut to shoot scenes using a body double shot from behind. The film was a commercial failure and Truffaut never worked outside France again. But the film's cult standing has steadily grown and it is considered a classic of the sci-fi genre.

Thrillers and Stolen Kisses

Truffaut worked on projects with varied subjects. _The Bride Wore Black_ (1968), a brutal tale of revenge, is a stylish homage to the films of Alfred Hitchcock (once again starring Jeanne Moreau).

_Stolen Kisses_ (1968) was a continuation of the Antoine Doinel Cycle starring Claude Jade as Antoine's fiancée and later wife Christine Darbon. It was a big hit on the international art circuit. A short time later Claude Jade made her Hollywood debut in Hitchcock's _Topaz_. [11]

_Mississippi Mermaid_ (1969), with Catherine Deneuve and Jean-Paul Belmondo is an identity-bending romantic thriller.

_The Wild Child_ (1970) included Truffaut's acting debut in the lead role of 18th century physician Jean Marc Gaspard Itard.

Doinel marries Christine

_Bed and Board_ (1970) was another Antoine Doinel film, also with Claude Jade from _Stolen kisses_ who is now Léaud's on-screen-wife.

_Two English Girls_ (1971) is the female reflection of the same love story as "Jules et Jim". It is based on a story written by Henri-Pierre Roche, who also wrote _Jules and Jim_. It is about a man who falls equally in love with two sisters, and their love affair over a period of years.

_Such a Gorgeous Kid Like Me_ (1972) was a screwball comedy that was not well received.

_Day for Night_

_Day for Night_ won Truffaut a Best Foreign Film Oscar in 1973.[12] The film is probably his most reflective work. It is the story of a film crew trying to finish their film while dealing with all of the personal and professional problems that accompany making a movie. Truffaut plays the director of the fictional film being made. This film features scenes shown in his previous films. It is considered to be his best film since his earliest work. _Time_ magazine placed it on their list of 100 Best Films of the Century (along with _The 400 Blows_).

In 1975, Truffaut gained more notoriety with _The Story of Adèle H._ Isabelle Adjani in the title role earned a nomination for a Best Actress Oscar.

Truffaut's 1976 film _Small Change_ gained a Golden Globe Nomination for Best Foreign Film.

_The late 70th and the last Doinel_

_The Man Who Loved Women_ (1977), a romantic drama, was a minor hit.

_The Green Room_ (1978) starred Truffaut himself in the lead.

It was a box office flop so he made _Love on the Run_ (1979) starring Jean-Pierre Léaud and Claude Jade as the final movie of the Doinel Cycle.

_The Last Metro_

One of Truffaut's final films gave him an international revival. In 1980, his film _The Last Metro_ garnered twelve César Award nominations with ten wins, including Best Director.

Final films

Truffaut's last film was shot in black and white, giving his career a sense of having bookends. _Confidentially Yours_ is Truffaut's tribute to his favorite director, Alfred Hitchcock. It deals with numerous Hitchcockian themes, such as private guilt versus public innocence, a woman investigating a murder, and anonymous locations.

Some of Truffaut's films feature the character Antoine Doinel, played by the actor Jean-Pierre Léaud. He began his career in _The 400 Blows_ at the age of fourteen, and continued as the favorite actor and "double" of Truffaut. The series continued with _Antoine and Colette_ (a short film in the anthology _Love at Twenty_), _Stolen Kisses_ (in which he falls in love with Christine Darbon alias Claude Jade), _Bed and Board_ about the married couple Antoine and Christine—and, finally, _Love on the Run_, where the couple go through a divorce.

In the last films, Léaud's girlfriend and later wife, Christine Darbon, was played by Truffaut's favorite actress, Claude Jade. During the filming of _Stolen Kisses_, Truffaut himself fell in love with, and was briefly engaged to, Claude Jade.

A keen reader, Truffaut adapted many literary works, including two novels by Henri-Pierre Roché, Ray Bradbury's _Fahrenheit 451_, Henry James' "The Altar of the Dead", filmed as _The Green Room_, and several American detective novels.

Truffaut's other films were from original screenplays, often co-written by the screenwriters Suzanne Schiffman or Jean Gruault. They featured diverse subjects, the sombre _The Story of Adèle H._, inspired by the life of the daughter of Victor Hugo, with Isabelle Adjani; _Day for Night_, shot at the Victorine Studios describing the ups and downs of film-making; and _The Last Metro_, set during the German occupation of France, a film rewarded by ten César Awards.

Known as lifelong cinephile, Truffaut once (according to the 1993 documentary film _François Truffaut: Stolen Portraits_) threw a hitchhiker he had picked up out of his car after learning that the hitchhiker didn't like films.

Truffaut is admired among other filmmakers and several tributes to his work have appeared in other films such as _Almost Famous_, _Face_ and _The Diving Bell and the Butterfly_, as well as novelist Haruki Murakami's _Kafka on the Shore_.

He also acted, appearing in Steven Spielberg's 1977 film _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_, where he played scientist Claude Lacombe.[13]


Attitude towards other filmmakers

Truffaut expressed his admiration for filmmakers such as Luis Buñuel, Ingmar Bergman, Robert Bresson, Roberto Rossellini, and Alfred Hitchcock. Truffaut wrote _Hitchcock/Truffaut_, a book about Hitchcock, based on a lengthy series of interviews.[14]

On Jean Renoir, he said: "I think Renoir is the only filmmaker who's practically infallible, who has never made a mistake on film. And I think if he never made mistakes, it's because he always found solutions based on simplicity—human solutions. He's one film director who never pretended. He never tried to have a style, and if you know his work—which is very comprehensive, since he dealt with all sorts of subjects—when you get stuck, especially as a young filmmaker, you can think of how Renoir would have handled the situation, and you generally find a solution".[15]

In 1973, Jean-Luc Godard accused Truffaut of making a movie that was a "lie" (_Day For Night_), and Truffaut replied with a 20-page letter in which he accused Godard of being a radical-chic hypocrite, a man who believed everyone to be "equal" in theory only. "The Ursula Andress of militancy—like Brando—a piece of shit on a pedestal." The two never spoke or saw each other again.[16] However, as noted by Serge Toubiana and Antoine de Baecque in their biography of Truffaut, Godard tried to reconcile their friendship later on, and after Truffaut's death wrote the introduction to a collection of his letters and a lengthy tribute in his video-essay film _Histoire(s) du cinéma_.[17]


Personal life

Truffaut was married to Madeleine Morgenstern from 1957 to 1965, and they had two daughters, Laura (born 1959) and Eva (born 1961). Madeleine was the daughter of Ignace Morgenstern, managing director of one of France's largest film distribution companies, and was largely responsible for securing funding for Truffaut's first films. He had affairs with many of his leading ladies: in 1968 he was engaged to actress Claude Jade; Truffaut and actress Fanny Ardant lived together from 1981 to 1984 and had a daughter, Joséphine Truffaut (born 28 September 1983).[18][19]

Truffaut was an atheist, although he had great respect for the Catholic Church and even requested a mass for his funeral.[20][21]


Death

Montmartre-Truffaut.JPG, Paris]]In July 1983, Truffaut rented France Gall's and Michel Berger's house outside Honfleur, Normandy (composing for Philippe Labro's film _Rive droite, rive gauche_) when he had his first stroke and was diagnosed with a brain tumor.[22] He was expected to attend his friend Miloš Forman's _Amadeus_ premiere[23] when he died on 21 October 1984, aged 52, at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine in France.[24]

At the time of his death, he still had numerous films in preparation. His goal was to make 30 films and then retire to write books for his remaining days. He was five films short of his personal goal. He is buried in Paris' Montmartre Cemetery.[25]
