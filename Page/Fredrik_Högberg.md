Life and career

From the early 2000 Högberg has worked mainly with works that contains multimedia, like the music film _Brassbones – a brass western_ (2001)[6] and the concertos _Ice Concerto_ (2012)[7] and _The Accordion King_ (2014).[8]

Works like _Dancing with Silent Purpose_ and _Rocky Island Boat Bay_ are examples of Högberg's humorous approach to his musical creation, and his inclination to combine contemporary art music with elements of popular music.[9][10][11]

Högberg's work is sometimes controversial; while working with the _Ice Concerto_ Högberg shot burning pianos being dropped from 40 metres onto the ice of Ångermanälven.[12] He was charged with environmental crimes, which were later dropped.[13][14] 2016 he wrote the music (in collaboration with singer/songwriter Nicolai Dunger) for the critically acclaimed opera Stilla min eld, inspired by the circumstances of Eva Rausings death in Belgravia, London, 2012.[15][16][17][18]

Fredrik Högberg has collaborated with soloists as, among others, Christian Lindberg, Anders Paulsson, Jörgen Sundeqvist, Niklas Sivelöv, Øystein Baadsvik, Ole Edvard Antonsen and Martin Fröst, and many international orchestras and ensembles which has led to several acclaimed works.[19][20][21][22]

Högberg's production is published by Gehrman's musikförlag, Stockholm. His trombone music is published by Edition Tarrodi.[23]

Högberg has won numerous awards and stipends. In 2006 he received one of the biggest grant to-date given to a Swedish composer, €200.000, to develop the first virtual opera house on the internet – iOPERA.[24][25] In 2014 his piano concerto _Ice Concerto_ was nominated to the Nordic Council Music Award.[26]
