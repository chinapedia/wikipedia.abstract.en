_COLLECTIONS_ is an album by vibraphonist Red Norvo, saxophonist Art Pepper, drummer Joe Morello and pianist Gerry Wiggins recorded in early 1957 originally released on the Intro label.[1][2]


Reception

The AllMusic review by Brandon Burke noted: " the most interesting performances on this record are by the similarly young Pepper, who appears on five of the album's ten tracks. Pepper sticks to alto sax on all but the appropriately titled original "Tenor Blooz," and delivers a meatier-than-expected tone for an alto player. Fine performances by both Norvo and Wiggins help make this a timeless West Coast jazz release. No real surprises here, but every track is a gem".[3]
