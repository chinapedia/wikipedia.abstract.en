__ (DIN; in English, the GERMAN INSTITUTE FOR STANDARDIZATION) is the German national organization for standardization and is the German ISO member body. DIN is a German Registered Association (_e.V._) headquartered in Berlin. There are currently around thirty thousand DIN Standards, covering nearly every field of technology.


History

Founded in 1917 as the __ (NADI, "Standardisation Committee of German Industry"), the NADI was renamed __ (DNA, "German Standardisation Committee") in 1926 to reflect that the organization now dealt with standardization issues in many fields; viz., not just for industrial products. In 1975 it was renamed again to __, or 'DIN' and is recognized by the German government as the official national-standards body, representing German interests at the international and European levels.

The acronym, 'DIN' is often incorrectly expanded as __ ("German Industry Standard"). This is largely due to the historic origin of the DIN as "NADI". The NADI indeed published their standards as __ (__). For example, the first published standard was '' (about tapered pins) in 1918. Many people still mistakenly associate DIN with the old __ naming convention.

One of the earliest, and probably the best known, is DIN 476 — the standard that introduced the A-series paper sizes in 1922 — adopted in 1975 as International Standard ISO 216. Common examples in modern technology include DIN and mini-DIN connectors for electronics, and the DIN rail.


DIN standard designation

The designation of a DIN standard shows its origin (# denotes a number):

-   _DIN #_ is used for German standards with primarily domestic significance or designed as a first step toward international status. _E DIN #_ is a draft standard and _DIN V #_ is a preliminary standard.
-   _DIN EN #_ is used for the German edition of European standards.
-   _DIN ISO #_ is used for the German edition of ISO standards.
-   _DIN EN ISO #_ is used if the standard has also been adopted as a European standard.


Examples of DIN standards

-   DIN 476: international paper sizes (now ISO 216 or DIN EN ISO 216)
