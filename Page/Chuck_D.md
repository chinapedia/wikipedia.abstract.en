CARLTON DOUGLAS RIDENHOUR (born August 1, 1960), known professionally as CHUCK D, is an American rapper, author, and producer.[1] As the leader of the rap group Public Enemy, he helped create politically and socially conscious hip hop music in the mid-1980s. _The Source_ ranked him at No. 12 on their list of the Top 50 Hip-Hop Lyricists of All Time.[2] 1991.]]


Early life

Ridenhour was born in Queens, New York.[3] He began writing rhymes after the New York City blackout of 1977.[4] After graduating from Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School, he went to Adelphi University on Long Island to study graphic design, where he met William Drayton (Flavor Flav). He received a B.F.A. from Adelphi in 1984 and later received an honorary doctorate from Adelphi in 2013.

While at Adelphi, Ridenhour co-hosted hip hop radio show the _Super Spectrum Mix Hour_ as Chuck D on Saturday nights at Long Island rock radio station WLIR, designed flyers for local hip-hop events, and drew a cartoon called _Tales of the Skind_ for Adelphi student newspaper _The Delphian_.[5]


Career

Upon hearing Ridenhour's demo track "Public Enemy Number One", fledgling producer/upcoming music-mogul Rick Rubin insisted on signing him to his Def Jam label.[6]

Their major label albums were _Yo! Bum Rush the Show_ (1987), _It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back_ (1988), _Fear of a Black Planet_ (1990), _Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black_ (1991), _Greatest Misses_ (1992), and _Muse Sick-n-Hour Mess Age_ (1994). They also released a full-length album soundtrack for the film _He Got Game_ in 1998. Ridenhour also contributed (as Chuck D) to several episodes of the PBS documentary series _The Blues_. He has appeared as a featured artist on many other songs and albums, having collaborated with artists such as Janet Jackson, Kool Moe Dee, The Dope Poet Society, Run–D.M.C., Ice Cube, Boom Boom Satellites, Rage Against the Machine, Anthrax, John Mellencamp and many others. In 1990, he appeared on "Kool Thing", a song by the alternative rock band Sonic Youth, and along with Flavor Flav, he sang on George Clinton's song "Tweakin'", which appears on his 1989 album _The Cinderella Theory_. In 1993, he executive produced _Got 'Em Running Scared_, an album by Ichiban Records group Chief Groovy Loo and the Chosen Tribe.[7]

Later career

In 1996, Ridenhour released _Autobiography of Mistachuck_ on Mercury Records. Chuck D made a rare appearance at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards, presenting the Video Vanguard Award to the Beastie Boys, whilst commending their musicianship. In November 1998, he settled out of court with Christopher "The Notorious B.I.G." Wallace's estate over the latter's sampling of his voice in the song "Ten Crack Commandments". The specific sampling is Ridenhour counting off the numbers one to nine on the track "Shut 'Em Down".[8] He later described the decision to sue as "stupid."[9]

In September 1999, he launched a multi-format "supersite" on the web site Rapstation.com. A home for the vast global hip hop community, the site boasts a TV and radio station with original programming, many of hip hop's most prominent DJs, celebrity interviews, free MP3 downloads (the first was contributed by multi-platinum rapper Coolio), downloadable ringtones by ToneThis, social commentary, current events, and regular features on turning rap careers into a viable living. Since 2000, he has been one of the most vocal supporters of peer-to-peer file sharing in the music industry.

He loaned his voice to _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_ as DJ Forth Right MC for the radio station Playback FM. In 2000, he collaborated with Public Enemy's Gary G-Whiz and MC Lyte on the theme music to the television show _Dark Angel_. He appeared with Henry Rollins in a cover of Black Flag's "Rise Above" for the album _Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three_. He was also featured on Z-Trip's album _Shifting Gears_ on a track called "Shock and Awe"; a 12-inch of the track was released featuring artwork by Shepard Fairey. In 2008 he contributed a chapter to _Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture_ (The MIT Press, 2008) edited by Paul D. Miller a.k.a. DJ Spooky, and also turned up on The Go! Team's album _Proof of Youth_ on the track "Flashlight Fight." He also fulfilled his childhood dreams of being a sports announcer by performing the play-by-play commentary in the video game _NBA Ballers: Chosen One_ on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

In 2009, Ridenhour wrote the foreword to the book _The Love Ethic: The Reason Why You Can't Find and Keep Beautiful Black Love_ by Kamau and Akilah Butler. He also appeared on Brother Ali's album, _Us_.[10]

In March 2011, Chuck D re-recorded vocals with The Dillinger Escape Plan for a cover of "Fight the Power".

Chuck D duetted with Rock singer Meat Loaf on his 2011 album _Hell in a Handbasket_ on the song "Mad Mad World/The Good God Is a Woman and She Don't Like Ugly".

In 2016 Chuck D joined the band Prophets of Rage along with B-Real and former members of Rage Against the Machine.


Rapping technique and creative process

Chuck D is known for his powerful rapping voice - _How to Rap_ says, _"Chuck D of Public Enemy has a powerful, resonant voice that is often acclaimed as one of the most distinct and impressive in hip-hop"_.[11] Chuck D says this was based on listening to Melle Mel and sportscasters such as Marv Albert.[12]

Chuck D often comes up with a title for a song first[13][14] and that he writes on paper, though he sometimes edits using a computer.[15] He also prefers to not punch in vocals,[16] and he prefers to not overdub vocals.[17]


Politics

Ridenhour is politically active; he co-hosted _Unfiltered_ on Air America Radio, testified before Congress in support of peer-to-peer MP3 sharing, and was involved in a 2004 rap political convention. He has continued to be an activist, publisher, lecturer, and producer.

Addressing the negative views associated with rap music, he co-wrote the essay book _Fight the Power: Rap, Race, and Reality_ with Yusuf Jah. He argues that "music and art and culture is escapism, and escapism sometimes is healthy for people to get away from reality", but sometimes the distinction is blurred and that's when "things could lead a young mind in a direction."[18] He also founded the record company Slam Jamz and acted as narrator in Kareem Adouard's short film _Bling: Consequences and Repercussions_, which examines the role of conflict diamonds in bling fashion. Despite Chuck D and Public Enemy's success, Chuck D claims that popularity or public approval was never a driving motivation behind their work. He is admittedly skeptical of celebrity status, revealing in a 1999 interview with _BOMB Magazine_ that, "The key for the record companies is to just keep making more and more stars, and make the ones who actually challenge our way of life irrelevant. The creation of celebrity has clouded the minds of most people in America, Europe and Asia. It gets people off the path they need to be on as individuals." [19]

In an interview with _Le Monde_ published January 29, 2008,[20] Chuck D stated that rap is devolving so much into a commercial enterprise, that the relationship between the rapper and the record label is that of slave to a master. He believes that nothing has changed for African-Americans since the debut of Public Enemy and, although he thinks that an Obama-Clinton alliance is great, he does not feel that the establishment will allow anything of substance to be accomplished. He stated that French President Nicolas Sarkozy is like any other European elite: he has profited through the murder, rape, and pillaging of those less fortunate and he refuses to allow equal opportunity for those men and women from Africa. In this article, he defended a comment made by Professor Griff in the past that he says was taken out of context by the media. The real statement was a critique of the Israeli government and its treatment of the Palestinian people. Chuck D stated that it is Public Enemy's belief that all human beings are equal.[21]

In an interview with the magazine _N'Digo_ published in June 2008, he spoke of today's mainstream urban music seemingly relishing the addictive euphoria of materialism and sexism, perhaps being the primary cause of many people harboring resentment towards the genre and its future. However, he has expressed hope for its resurrection, saying "It's only going to be dead if it doesn't talk about the messages of life as much as the messages of death and non-movement", citing artists such as NYOil, M.I.A. and The Roots as socially conscious artists who push the envelope creatively. "A lot of cats are out there doing it, on the Web and all over. They're just not placing their career in the hands of some major corporation."[22]

In 2010, Chuck D released a track, "Tear Down That Wall". He said, "I talked about the wall not only just dividing the U.S. and Mexico but the states of California, New Mexico and Texas. But Arizona, it's like, come on. Now they're going to enforce a law that talks about basically racial profiling."[23]

He is on the board of the TransAfrica Forum, a Pan African organization that is focused on African, Caribbean and Latin American issues.
