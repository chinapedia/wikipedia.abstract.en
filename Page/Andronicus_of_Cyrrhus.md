Tower_of_winds.jpg ANDRONICUS OF CYRRHUS or ANDRONICUS CYRRHESTES (, _Andrónikos Kyrrhēstou_), son of Hermias, was a Macedonian astronomer who flourished about 100 BC.


Life

He built a _horologion_ at Athens, the so-called Tower of the Winds, a considerable portion of which still exists. It is octagonal, with figures carved on each side, representing the eight principal winds.[1] In antiquity a bronze figure of Triton on the summit, with a rod in his hand, turned round by the wind, pointed to the quarter from which it blew. From this model is derived the custom of placing weather cockorolls on steeples.
