BOMBAY POTATO (sometimes called BOMBAY ALOO or _aloo_ (_alu_) _Bombay_),[1] is an Indian dry dish prepared using potatoes that are cubed, boiled and then fried, and is flavored with various spices such as cumin, curry, garlic, garam masala, turmeric, mustard seeds, chili powder salt and pepper.[2][3][4][5][6] Onion, tomatoes and tomato sauce are sometimes used as ingredients.[7][8][9] Bombay potato can also be served as a side dish,[10] rather than as a main course.
