Escudo_Maldonado.png BALTASAR MALDONADO, also written as BALTAZAR MALDONADO,[1] (?, Salamanca, Castile - 1552, Bogotá, New Kingdom of Granada) was a Spanish conquistador who first served under Sebastian de Belalcázar in the conquest of Quito and Peru, the foundations of Cali and Popayán, and later in the army of Hernán Pérez de Quesada in the Spanish conquest of the Muisca.[2]

Baltasar Maldonado is known as the conquistador who defeated the last ruling main _cacique_ of the Muisca: Tundama, whom he killed with a large hammer in late December 1539. Subsequently, Baltasar Maldonado took part in the Quest for _El Dorado_ led by Hernán Pérez de Quesada in the southern regions of present-day Colombia. After this failed expedition, where many of the Spanish soldiers died of diseases, poisoned arrows and drowning in the numerous rivers of the Llanos Orientales and western Amazon River basin, Baltasar Maldonado returned to Popayán and Cali and traveled back to Bogotá, the capital of the New Kingdom of Granada where he died in 1552.[3]

The adventures of Baltasar Maldonado during the first half of the 16th century have been described by scholars Juan de Castellanos and Juan Rodríguez Freyle in his work _El Carnero_.[4][5][6]


The Maldonado family

The Maldonado family was a distinguished family in Salamanca, Spain. Notable is Francisco Maldonado, who was a leader in the Revolt of the Comuneros. Various conquistadors and other people involved in the Spanish colonization of the Americas of the Maldonado family are known in history; Rodrigo Arias de Maldonado, conquistador in New Spain, (Francisco) Arias Maldonado, who also served under De Belálcazar and became encomendero of Sora in Boyacá, Juan Maldonado, another conquistador in Colombia and son-in-law of Ortún Velázquez de Velasco, Juan Prieto Maldonado, conquistador in Tunja, Francisco Maldonado Dorado del Hierro, serving under German conquistadors Georg von Speyer and Nikolaus Federmann and later encomendero of Sasaima and Bituima, Diego Carasquilla Maldonado, who became _oídor_ for Santa Fe de Bogotá in Lima, Francisco de Grado Maldonado, son of Isabel Maldonado, was conquistador in Peru.[7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] Another Isabel Maldonado was married to two conquistadors; Pedro Núñez Cabrera and after his death with Miguel Holguín y Figueroa.[16] Alonso Maldonado y Guzmán was the son-in-law of conquistador in Mexico Francisco de Montejo, the Elder.[17]

Spanish conquest

Armenia,_Quindio,_Colombia.jpg and Quimbaya]] Pantano_de_Vargas_-_panoramio.jpg Baltasar Maldonado traveled from Spain to Santo Domingo and later to Santa Marta.[22] He was a soldier in the conquest expedition of Sebastián de Belalcázar who founded San Francisco de Quito on December 6, 1534, and Peru and was sent northwards into the later New Kingdom of Granada with his later brother-in-law Jorge Robledo and Álvaro de Mendoza.[23][24] They reached the central part of the Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes in 1539, where the troops encountered resistance of the Pijao, Quimbaya and other indigenous groups.

He accompanied De Belalcázar on his journey from Popayán, founded on January 13, 1537, towards the Bogotá savanna in the Eastern Ranges where the conquistadors encountered the other two groups; the eastern expedition led by Nikolaus Federmann and the main expedition under command of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada. After the foundation of Bogotá on August 6, 1538, the soldiers participated in the Battle of Tocarema two weeks later to submit the Panche to the west of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense. During this time, Baltasar Maldonado was involved in the conquest of the Central Ranges, and sent east by Jorge Robledo to the Muisca Confederation on the Altiplano.

Conquest of Tundama

Muisca_raft_Legend_of_El_Dorado_Offerings_of_gold.jpg''', formed the motive for expedition leader Hernán Pérez de Quesada to travel to the Llanos Orientales, with Baltasar Maldonado as his main captain. Many soldiers, among which Lázaro Fonte, died of diseases, poisoned arrows shot by the natives and drowning in the many rivers of the flatlands]] While most of the Muisca Confederation was submitted to the Spanish rule; first the _zipa_ of Bacatá in April 1537, then the _zaque_ of Hunza four months later and shortly after the _iraca_ Sugamuxi in Suamox, the northernmost territories were still controlled by the _cacique_ Tundama, whose _bohío_ was built on an island (the _La Tolosa_ hill, north of the present-day town centre) in the lake of the settlement with the same name, today known as Duitama. Tundama was the last _cacique_ of Duitama and the _caciques_ of Cerinza, Chitagoto, Icabuco, Lupacoche, Sátiva, Soatá and Susacón were loyal to him.[25] Tundama, other than the earlier _caciques_ of the Muisca resisted heavily against the European invaders and punished one of his people who suggested to surrender by cutting off their ears and left hand.[26] Tundama declared a "death war" against the Spanish soldiers and gathered an army of 10,000 guecha warriors.[27]

It was Baltasar Maldonado who was the conquistador to defeat Tundama and 4000 other Muisca in December 1539, a struggle that took two weeks, culminating in the Battle of the Vargas Swamp, close to Paipa, where 280 years later the famous Vargas Swamp Battle by Simón Bolívar would be fought.[28][29][30] Tundama was killed by Baltasar Maldonado with a large hammer.[31]

Quest for _El Dorado_

Altiplano_Cundiboyacense.png Caqueta_Topographic_2.png Putumayo_Topographic_2.png The mythical city of gold _El Dorado_ was a common legend in the early days of the conquest of what later would become Colombia; the troops of Gonzalo de Quesada were drawn from the relative safety of the Caribbean coast in Santa Marta towards the heart of the Andes, while around the same time the southern expedition led by De Belalcázar heard similar stories in Quito. After the establishment of the New Kingdom of Granada, Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada left for Spain with De Belalcázar and other soldiers who participated in the conquest and left the reign of the new colony in the hands of his brother, Hernán Pérez de Quesada. Hernán organised an expedition to search for the mythical lands of gold towards the southeast of the Altiplano; the vast flatlands of the Llanos Orientales. The troops left Bogotá in September 1540 and passed through Pasca, that was founded by fellow conquistador Juan de Céspedes, three years earlier.[32]

The conquistadors passed the mountains of the Eastern Ranges and crossed the Guaviare and Papamene Rivers. While crossing one of the many rivers of the Llanos, a horserider of the expedition, Jorge Olmeda, drowned with his horse and an indigenous woman he had taken with him. The Spanish honoured him by naming this the Olmeda River. The soldiers reached La Fragua, a settlement populated by the Choque in the present-day department of Caquetá, where Hernán Pérez de Quesada decided to stay for a while to rest. He sent Baltasar Maldonado ahead to search for other settlements in the area. Maldonado tried to cross a river but he was halted by the indigenous people living there, who shot poisoned arrows at the conquistador, forcing him to retreat. At night, Baltasar Maldonado and his men attempted to defeat the indigenous a second time, this time successfully by ambushing them on a small island in the river. The hurt natives fled and many drowned in the waters. Hernán Pérez de Quesada with the other remaining soldiers joined the troops of Maldonado again in Mocoa, Putumayo to the south. From here, the expedition went back into the Andes to search for food.[33]

Baltasar Maldonado walked for three days, finally encountering a lush valley in Sibundoy, terrain of the Inga and Kamëntsá. This valley was part of the jurisdiction of the earlier founded Popayán and the colleagues of Maldonado from four years earlier lived in the area. Maldonado, however, was unaware of this and returned to his expedition leader Hernán to report the location of the valley. The troops marched back and found the conquistadors, among which Molina, Cepeda and others.[34] From here, the expedition that failed to find _El Dorado_ returned to Cali, formerly founded by De Belalcázar. Baltasar Maldonado, who had spent years in the conquest of Colombian terrain, returned to Bogotá via Pensilvania.[35] He died in the capital in 1552.[36]
