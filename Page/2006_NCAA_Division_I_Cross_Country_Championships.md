The 2006 NCAA DIVISION I CROSS COUNTRY CHAMPIONSHIPS were the 68th annual NCAA Men's Division I Cross Country Championship and the 26th annual NCAA Women's Division I Cross Country Championship to determine the team and individual national champions of NCAA Division I men's and women's collegiate cross country running in the United States. In all, four different titles were contested: men's and women's individual and team championships.[1][2]

Held on November 20, 2006, the combined meet was the third of eight consecutive meets hosted by Indiana State University at the LaVern Gibson Championship Cross Country Course in Terre Haute, Indiana. The distance for the men's race was 10 kilometers (6.21 miles) while the distance for the women's race was 6 kilometers (3.73 miles).

The men's team championship was won by Colorado (94 points), the Buffaloes' third. The women's team championship was again won by Stanford (195 points), the Cardinal's fourth overall, second consecutive, and third in four years.

The two individual champions were, for the men, Josh Rohatinsky (BYU, 30:44.9) and, for the women, Sally Kipyego (Texas Tech, 20:11.1).[3][4]
