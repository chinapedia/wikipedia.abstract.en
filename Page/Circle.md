A CIRCLE is a simple closed shape. It is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre; equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant. The distance between any of the points and the centre is called the radius. This article is about circles in Euclidean geometry, and, in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.

A circle is a simple closed curve that divides the plane into two regions: an interior and an exterior. In everyday use, the term "circle" may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to the whole figure including its interior; in strict technical usage, the circle is only the boundary and the whole figure is called a disc.

A circle may also be defined as a special kind of ellipse in which the two foci are coincident and the eccentricity is 0, or the two-dimensional shape enclosing the most area per unit perimeter squared, using calculus of variations.


Euclid's definition


Terminology

-   Annulus: a ring-shaped object, the region bounded by two concentric circles.
-   Arc: any connected part of a circle. Specifying two end points of an arc and a center allows for two arcs that together make up a full circle.
-   Centre: the point equidistant from all points on the circle.
-   Chord: a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle, thus dividing a circle in two sements.
-   Circumference: the length of one circuit along the circle, or the distance around the circle.
-   Diameter: a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle and that passes through the centre; or the length of such a line segment. This is the largest distance between any two points on the circle. It is a special case of a chord, namely the longest chord for a given circle, and its length is twice the length of a radius.
-   Disc: the region of the plane bounded by a circle.
-   Lens: the region common to (the intersection of) two overlapping discs.
-   Passant: a coplanar straight line that has no point in common with the circle.
-   Radius: a line segment joining the centre of a circle with any single point on the circle itself; or the length of such a segment, which is half (the length of) a diameter.
-   Sector: a region bounded by two radii of equal length with a common center and either of the two possible arcs, determined by this center and the endpoints of the radii.
-   Segment: a region bounded by a chord and one of the arcs connecting the chord's endpoints. The length of the chord imposes a lower boundary on the diameter of possible arcs. Sometimes the term _segment_ is used only for regions not containing the center of the circle to which their arc belongs to.
-   Secant: an extended chord, a coplanar straight line, intersecting a circle in two points.
-   Semicircle: one of the two possible arcs determined by the endpoints of a diameter, taking its midpoint as center. In non-technical common usage it may mean the interior of the two dimensional region bounded by a diameter and one of its arcs, that is technically called a half-disc. A half-disc is a special case of a segment, namely the largest one.
-   Tangent: a coplanar straight line that has one single point in common with a circle ("touches the circle at this point").

All of the specified regions may be considered as _open_, that is, not containing their boundaries, or as _closed_, including their respective boundaries.

History

The word _circle_ derives from the Greek κίρκος/κύκλος (_kirkos/kuklos_), itself a metathesis of the Homeric Greek κρίκος (_krikos_), meaning "hoop" or "ring".[1] The origins of the words _circus_ and _circuit_ are closely related. astronomical drawing.]] The circle has been known since before the beginning of recorded history. Natural circles would have been observed, such as the Moon, Sun, and a short plant stalk blowing in the wind on sand, which forms a circle shape in the sand. The circle is the basis for the wheel, which, with related inventions such as gears, makes much of modern machinery possible. In mathematics, the study of the circle has helped inspire the development of geometry, astronomy and calculus.

Early science, particularly geometry and astrology and astronomy, was connected to the divine for most medieval scholars, and many believed that there was something intrinsically "divine" or "perfect" that could be found in circles.[2][3]

Some highlights in the history of the circle are:

-   1700 BCE – The Rhind papyrus gives a method to find the area of a circular field. The result corresponds to (3.16049...) as an approximate value of .[4]

from inside]]

-   300 BCE – Book 3 of Euclid's _Elements_ deals with the properties of circles.
-   In Plato's Seventh Letter there is a detailed definition and explanation of the circle. Plato explains the perfect circle, and how it is different from any drawing, words, definition or explanation.
-   1880 CE – Lindemann proves that is transcendental, effectively settling the millennia-old problem of squaring the circle.[5]


Analytic results

Length of circumference

The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is (pi), an irrational constant approximately equal to 3.141592654. Thus the length of the circumference _C_ is related to the radius _r_ and diameter _d_ by:

_C_ = 2_π__r_ = _π__d_. 

Area enclosed

As proved by Archimedes, in his Measurement of a Circle, the area enclosed by a circle is equal to that of a triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius,[6] which comes to multiplied by the radius squared:

_A__r__e__a_ = _π__r_². 

Equivalently, denoting diameter by _d_,

$$\mathrm{Area} = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} \approx 0{.}7854d^2,$$

that is, approximately 79% of the circumscribing square (whose side is of length _d_).

The circle is the plane curve enclosing the maximum area for a given arc length. This relates the circle to a problem in the calculus of variations, namely the isoperimetric inequality.

Equations

Cartesian coordinates

EQUATION OF A CIRCLE
In an _x_–_y_ Cartesian coordinate system, the circle with centre coordinates (_a_, _b_) and radius _r_ is the set of all points (_x_, _y_) such that

(_x_−_a_)² + (_y_−_b_)² = _r_².

This equation, known as the Equation of the Circle, follows from the Pythagorean theorem applied to any point on the circle: as shown in the adjacent diagram, the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length |_x_ − _a_| and |_y_ − _b_|. If the circle is centred at the origin (0, 0), then the equation simplifies to

$$x^2 + y^2 = r^2.\!\$$

'''Parametric form '''
The equation can be written in parametric form using the trigonometric functions sine and cosine as

_x_ = _a_ + _r_ cos _t_, 

_y_ = _b_ + _r_ sin _t_ 
where _t_ is a parametric variable in the range 0 to 2, interpreted geometrically as the angle that the ray from (_a_, _b_) to (_x_, _y_) makes with the positive _x_-axis.

An alternative parametrisation of the circle is:

$$x = a + r \frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}.\,$$

$$y = b + r \frac{2t}{1+t^2}\,$$

In this parameterisation, the ratio of _t_ to _r_ can be interpreted geometrically as the stereographic projection of the line passing through the centre parallel to the _x_-axis (see Tangent half-angle substitution). However, this parameterisation works only if _t_ is made to range not only through all reals but also to a point at infinity; otherwise, the bottom-most point of the circle would be omitted.

'''3-point-form '''
The equation of the circle determined by three points (x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂), (x₃, y₃) not on a line is obtained by a conversion of the _3-point-form of a circle's equation_

$$\frac{({\color{green}x}-x_1)({\color{green}x}-x_2)+({\color{red}y}-y_1)({\color{red}y}-y_2)}
             {({\color{red}y}-y_1)({\color{green}x}-x_2)-({\color{red}y}-y_2)({\color{green}x}-x_1)}=
        \frac{(x_3-x_1)(x_3-x_2)+(y_3-y_1)(y_3-y_2)}
             {(y_3-y_1)(x_3-x_2)-(y_3-y_2)(x_3-x_1)}.$$

HOMOGENEOUS FORM
In homogeneous coordinates, each conic section with the equation of a circle has the form

_x_² + _y_² − 2_a__x__z_ − 2_b__y__z_ + _c__z_² = 0. 

It can be proven that a conic section is a circle exactly when it contains (when extended to the complex projective plane) the points _I_(1: _i_: 0) and _J_(1: −_i_: 0). These points are called the circular points at infinity.

Polar coordinates

In polar coordinates, the equation of a circle is:

_r_² − 2_r__r_₀cos (_θ_ − _ϕ_) + _r_₀² = _a_² 

where _a_ is the radius of the circle, (r, θ) is the polar coordinate of a generic point on the circle, and (r₀, ϕ) is the polar coordinate of the centre of the circle (i.e., _r_₀ is the distance from the origin to the centre of the circle, and _φ_ is the anticlockwise angle from the positive _x_-axis to the line connecting the origin to the centre of the circle). For a circle centred on the origin, i.e. _r_₀ = 0, this reduces to simply _a_}}. When _a_}}, or when the origin lies on the circle, the equation becomes

_r_ = 2_a_cos (_θ_ − _ϕ_). 

In the general case, the equation can be solved for _r_, giving

$$r = r_0 \cos(\theta - \phi) \pm \sqrt{a^2 - r_0^2 \sin^2(\theta - \phi)},$$
Note that without the ± sign, the equation would in some cases describe only half a circle.

Complex plane

In the complex plane, a circle with a centre at _c_ and radius _r_ has the equation:

|_z_ − _c_| = _r_ 
.

In parametric form, this can be written:

_z_ = _r__e_^(_i__t_) + _c_
.

The slightly generalised equation

$$pz\overline{z} + gz + \overline{gz} = q$$

for real _p_, _q_ and complex _g_ is sometimes called a generalised circle. This becomes the above equation for a circle with $p = 1,\ g=-\overline{c},\ q=r^2-|c|^2$, since $|z-c|^2 = z\overline{z}-\overline{c}z-c\overline{z}+c\overline{c}$. Not all generalised circles are actually circles: a generalised circle is either a (true) circle or a line.

Tangent lines

The tangent line through a point _P_ on the circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through _P_. If (_x_₁, _y_₁)}} and the circle has centre (_a_, _b_) and radius _r_, then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from (_a_, _b_) to (_x_₁, _y_₁), so it has the form _c_}}. Evaluating at (_x_₁, _y_₁) determines the value of _c_ and the result is that the equation of the tangent is

(_x_₁ − _a_)_x_ + (_y_₁ − _b_)_y_ = (_x_₁ − _a_)_x_₁ + (_y_₁ − _b_)_y_₁ 
or

$$(x_1-a)(x-a)+(y_1-b)(y-b) = r^2.\!\$$

If then the slope of this line is

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x_1-a}{y_1-b}.$$

This can also be found using implicit differentiation.

When the centre of the circle is at the origin then the equation of the tangent line becomes

$$x_1x+y_1y = r^2,\!\$$
and its slope is

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x_1}{y_1}.$$


Properties

-   The circle is the shape with the largest area for a given length of perimeter. (See Isoperimetric inequality.)
-   The circle is a highly symmetric shape: every line through the centre forms a line of reflection symmetry and it has rotational symmetry around the centre for every angle. Its symmetry group is the orthogonal group O(2,_R_). The group of rotations alone is the circle group T.
-   All circles are similar.
    -   A circle's circumference and radius are proportional.
    -   The area enclosed and the square of its radius are proportional.
    -   The constants of proportionality are 2 and , respectively.
-   The circle that is centred at the origin with radius 1 is called the unit circle.
    -   Thought of as a great circle of the unit sphere, it becomes the Riemannian circle.
-   Through any three points, not all on the same line, there lies a unique circle. In Cartesian coordinates, it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points. See circumcircle.

Chord

-   Chords are equidistant from the centre of a circle if and only if they are equal in length.
-   The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector are:
    -   A perpendicular line from the centre of a circle bisects the chord.
    -   The line segment through the centre bisecting a chord is perpendicular to the chord.
-   If a central angle and an inscribed angle of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle.
-   If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal.
-   If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are supplementary.
    -   For a cyclic quadrilateral, the exterior angle is equal to the interior opposite angle.
-   An inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle (see Thales' theorem).
-   The diameter is the longest chord of the circle.
    -   Among all the circles with a chord AB in common, the circle with minimal radius is the one with diameter AB.
-   If the intersection of any two chords divides one chord into lengths _a_ and _b_ and divides the other chord into lengths _c_ and _d_, then _cd_}}.
-   If the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths _a_ and _b_ and divides the other chord into lengths _c_ and _d_, then equals the square of the diameter.[7]
-   The sum of the squared lengths of any two chords intersecting at right angles at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point, and is given by 8_r_ ² – 4_p_ ² (where _r_ is the circle's radius and _p_ is the distance from the centre point to the point of intersection).[8]
-   The distance from a point on the circle to a given chord times the diameter of the circle equals the product of the distances from the point to the ends of the chord.[9]

Tangent

-   A line drawn perpendicular to a radius through the end point of the radius lying on the circle is a tangent to the circle.
-   A line drawn perpendicular to a tangent through the point of contact with a circle passes through the centre of the circle.
-   Two tangents can always be drawn to a circle from any point outside the circle, and these tangents are equal in length.
-   If a tangent at _A_ and a tangent at _B_ intersect at the exterior point _P_, then denoting the centre as _O_, the angles ∠_BOA_ and ∠_BPA_ are supplementary.
-   If _AD_ is tangent to the circle at _A_ and if _AQ_ is a chord of the circle, then arc(_AQ_)}}.

Theorems

-   The chord theorem states that if two chords, _CD_ and _EB_, intersect at _A_, then _AB_ × _AE_}}.
-   If two secants, _AE_ and _AD_, also cut the circle at _B_ and _C_ respectively, then _AB_ × _AE_}}. (Corollary of the chord theorem.)
-   A tangent can be considered a limiting case of a secant whose ends are coincident. If a tangent from an external point _A_ meets the circle at _F_ and a secant from the external point _A_ meets the circle at _C_ and _D_ respectively, then _AC_ × _AD_}}. (Tangent-secant theorem.)
-   The angle between a chord and the tangent at one of its endpoints is equal to one half the angle subtended at the centre of the circle, on the opposite side of the chord (Tangent Chord Angle).
-   If the angle subtended by the chord at the centre is 90 degrees then _r_ }}, where _ℓ_ is the length of the chord and _r_ is the radius of the circle.
-   If two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle _A_ is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs ($\overset{\frown}{DE}$ and $\overset{\frown}{BC}$). That is, 2∠CAB = ∠DOE − ∠BOC where _O_ is the centre of the circle. This is the secant-secant theorem.

Inscribed angles

An inscribed angle (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding central angle (red). Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a diameter is a right angle (since the central angle is 180 degrees).

Sagitta

-   The sagitta (also known as the versine) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the arc of the circle.
-   Given the length _y_ of a chord, and the length _x_ of the sagitta, the Pythagorean theorem can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle that will fit around the two lines:



        $r=\frac{y^2}{8x}+ \frac{x}{2}.$

Another proof of this result, which relies only on two chord properties given above, is as follows. Given a chord of length _y_ and with sagitta of length _x_, since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know it is part of a diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the "missing" part of the diameter is () in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that ( (_y_ / 2)²}}. Solving for _r_, we find the required result.


Compass and straightedge constructions

There are many compass-and-straightedge constructions resulting in circles.

The simplest and most basic is the construction given the centre of the circle and a point on the circle. Place the fixed leg of the compass on the centre point, the movable leg on the point on the circle and rotate the compass.

Construct a circle with a given diameter

-   Construct the midpoint of the diameter.
-   Construct the circle with centre passing through one of the endpoints of the diameter (it will also pass through the other endpoint).

Construct a circle through 3 noncollinear points

-   Name the points , and ,
-   Construct the perpendicular bisector of the segment .
-   Construct the perpendicular bisector of the segment .
-   Label the point of intersection of these two perpendicular bisectors . (They meet because the points are not collinear).
-   Construct the circle with centre passing through one of the points , or (it will also pass through the other two points).


Circle of Apollonius

Apollonius of Perga showed that a circle may also be defined as the set of points in a plane having a constant _ratio_ (other than 1) of distances to two fixed foci, _A_ and _B_.[10][11] (The set of points where the distances are equal is the perpendicular bisector of segment _AB_, a line.) That circle is sometimes said to be drawn _about_ two points.

The proof is in two parts. First, one must prove that, given two foci _A_ and _B_ and a ratio of distances, any point _P_ satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle. Let _C_ be another point, also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment _AB_. By the angle bisector theorem the line segment _PC_ will bisect the interior angle _APB_, since the segments are similar:

$$\frac{AP}{BP} = \frac{AC}{BC}.$$

Analogously, a line segment _PD_ through some point _D_ on _AB_ extended bisects the corresponding exterior angle _BPQ_ where _Q_ is on _AP_ extended. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle _CPD_ is exactly 90 degrees, i.e., a right angle. The set of points _P_ such that angle _CPD_ is a right angle forms a circle, of which _CD_ is a diameter.

Second, see[12] for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio.

Cross-ratios

A closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the cross-ratio of points in the complex plane. If _A_, _B_, and _C_ are as above, then the circle of Apollonius for these three points is the collection of points _P_ for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:

$$|[A,B;C,P]| = 1.\$$

Stated another way, _P_ is a point on the circle of Apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio [_A_,_B_;_C_,_P_] is on the unit circle in the complex plane.

 Generalised circles

If _C_ is the midpoint of the segment _AB_, then the collection of points _P_ satisfying the Apollonius condition

$$\frac{|AP|}{|BP|} = \frac{|AC|}{|BC|}$$

is not a circle, but rather a line.

Thus, if _A_, _B_, and _C_ are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points _P_ satisfying the above equation is called a "generalised circle." It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a line is a generalised circle of infinite radius.


Circles inscribed in or circumscribed about other figures

In every triangle a unique circle, called the incircle, can be inscribed such that it is tangent to each of the three sides of the triangle.[13]

About every triangle a unique circle, called the circumcircle, can be circumscribed such that it goes through each of the triangle's three vertices.[14]

A tangential polygon, such as a tangential quadrilateral, is any convex polygon within which a circle can be inscribed that is tangent to each side of the polygon.[15] Every regular polygon and every triangle is a tangential polygon.

A cyclic polygon is any convex polygon about which a circle can be circumscribed, passing through each vertex. A well-studied example is the cyclic quadrilateral. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a cyclic polygon. A polygon that is both cyclic and tangential is called a bicentric polygon.

A hypocycloid is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle.


Circle as limiting case of other figures

The circle can be viewed as a limiting case of each of various other figures:

-   A Cartesian oval is a set of points such that a weighted sum of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points (foci) is a constant. An ellipse is the case in which the weights are equal. A circle is an ellipse with an eccentricity of zero, meaning that the two foci coincide with each other as the centre of the circle. A circle is also a different special case of a Cartesian oval in which one of the weights is zero.
-   A superellipse has an equation of the form $\left|\frac{x}{a}\right|^n\! + \left|\frac{y}{b}\right|^n\! = 1$ for positive _a_, _b_, and _n_. A supercircle has _a_}}. A circle is the special case of a supercircle in which 2}}.
-   A Cassini oval is a set of points such that the product of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points is a constant. When the two fixed points coincide, a circle results.
-   A curve of constant width is a figure whose width, defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each intersecting its boundary in a single point, is the same regardless of the direction of those two parallel lines. The circle is the simplest example of this type of figure.


Circles in other _p_-norms

s (see also superellipse) in different -norms (every vector from the origin to the unit circle has a length of one, the length being calculated with length-formula of the corresponding ).]] Defining a circle as the set of points with a fixed distance from a point, different shapes can be considered circles under different definitions of distance. In _p_-norm, distance is determined by

$$\left\| x \right\| _p = \left( |x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + \dotsb + |x_n|^p \right) ^{1/p} .$$
In Euclidean geometry, _p_ = 2, giving the familiar

$$\left\| x \right\| _2 = \sqrt{ |x_1|^2 + |x_2|^2 + \dotsb + |x_n|^2 } .$$

In taxicab geometry, _p_ = 1. Taxicab circles are squares with sides oriented at a 45° angle to the coordinate axes. While each side would have length $\sqrt{2}r$ using a Euclidean metric, where _r_ is the circle's radius, its length in taxicab geometry is 2_r_. Thus, a circle's circumference is 8_r_. Thus, the value of a geometric analog to π is 4 in this geometry. The formula for the unit circle in taxicab geometry is |x| + |y| = 1 in Cartesian coordinates and

$$r = \frac{1}{| \sin \theta| + |\cos\theta|}$$

in polar coordinates.

A circle of radius 1 (using this distance) is the von Neumann neighborhood of its center.

A circle of radius _r_ for the Chebyshev distance (L_(∞) metric) on a plane is also a square with side length 2_r_ parallel to the coordinate axes, so planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to planar taxicab distance. However, this equivalence between L₁ and L_(∞) metrics does not generalize to higher dimensions.


Squaring the circle

Squaring the circle is the problem, proposed by ancient geometers, of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge.

In 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, which proves that pi () is a transcendental number, rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients.
