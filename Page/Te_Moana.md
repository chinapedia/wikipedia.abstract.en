McBeth from Pleasant Valley School.[3] The new school was built on the site in 1975 with a combination of Education Board money and the hard work of local residents.[4] The school would celebrate its centenary in 1992, however, like many rural schools declining numbers saw the school close its doors in 2004.[5] The building remains today.
