MOSES HACMON (born 1977) is an Israeli artist best known for his commitment to the study and education about the subject of water. He developed a technique to capture forms in water that are invisible to the naked eye. He is committed to spreading his theory that water is the source of all consciousness. His art can be described as kinetic art, photography, BioArt, liquid photography, flow-tography, nature photography, scientific photography, and motion photography. He is the older brother of Hila Klein (née Hacmon) of h3h3productions.


Education

Moses studied cinematography and fine art at Avni Institute of Art and Design in Tel-Aviv. In 2006 Moses completed his B.Arch with AIA honors award, from SCI arc (Southern California Institute of Architecture). After graduating Moses started intense training in movement and dance with Body Weather Laboratory to explore water in a somatic manner.


Career

Faces_of_Water_at_Joshua_Tree.jpg Hacmon's art emerged from ten years of research on water and he has committed his life to educating people about water. It all center's around his proposition that water is in fact the source of consciousness. In 2013 he discovered the technique he uses to capture images of water that are invisible to the naked eye.^([1]) His work expands on Masaru Emoto's talking about how water's molecular structure reacts to metaphysical stimuli, most notably found in The Hidden Messages in Water. While Emoto could only show the way water is effected by human consciousness in the form of frozen water, Hacmon was able to show these effects on water in its fluid form through photography. He has turned these photographs into installations to display in galleries and educate people about his findings.

Faces of Water

Faces of Water was Hacmon's first project that was released in 2013.[1] It is the debut of his technique that capture's water's invisible forms.[2][3] Wired Magazine says "Hacmon worked out technique involving a special type of film with a layer of liquid [film] that records the movement of the water itself. The film leaves Hacmon with a full-size negative, which he then develops into pictures like the ones here–an analog process from start to finish." [4] The photos show the faces of water, showing it as an architect of nature. Newbery and the Carnegie medal award-winning author Neil Gaiman said about the photos "Immediate thoughts involve not drinking water any longer because it has eyes and is obviously sentient…"[5]

Cymatics

Cymatics is a subset of modal vibrational phenomena, basically a wave. Hacmon employs cymatics in his works that use water to visualize sound waves. He has worked with Mark Dresser, an American double bass player and composer, to link sound to its visualization in water.[6] Using the technique Hacmon developed, they set up performances with Dresser's bass hooked up to the water and created a feedback loop where dresser influenced the water which in turn influenced his laying. The entire performance was improvised, playing on the idea of the natural stream of consciousness not only within a single being but between the water outside of us and the water inside of us.
