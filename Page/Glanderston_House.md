GLANDERSTON HOUSE was a country house and estate in East Renfrewshire, Scotland, to the south of Barrhead. It lies on Glanderston Reservoir.[1] At one time it belonged to the Stewart Kings of Scotland. The de Croc family ceded it to the Earls of Lennox, and a John Mure of Caldwell is documented to have owned the house in 1560.[2]

In 1697-8, a new mansion was built, based around remnants of the old stone tower of 11 x 9 metres and several annexes.[3] It was later purchased by Glasgow tobacco baron Speirs of Elderslie in 1774. In 1860, artist E. A. Walton was born at Glanderston; his family were the last to reside here. By 1909 it had fallen into a dilapidated state, and it was later demolished.[4]
