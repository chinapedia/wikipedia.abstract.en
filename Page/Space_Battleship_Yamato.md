is a Japanese science fiction anime series produced and written by Yoshinobu Nishizaki, directed by manga artist Leiji Matsumoto, and animated by Academy Productions and Group TAC. The series aired in Yomiuri TV from October 6, 1974 to March 30, 1975, totaling up to 26 episodes. It revolves around the character Susumu Kodai (Derek Wildstar) and a crew of people on Earth, tasked in going into space aboard the space warship _Yamato_ in search for the Planet Iscandar in order to reverse the damage done to their planet after it was destroyed by the Gamilians.

It is one of the most influential anime series in Japan due to its theme and story, marking a turn towards more complex serious works and influencing works such as _Mobile Suit Gundam_, _Neon Genesis Evangelion_[1] and _Super Dimension Fortress Macross_ as well as video games such as _Space Invaders_.[2][3] Hideaki Anno has ranked _Yamato_ as his favorite anime[4] and credited it with sparking his interest in anime.[5]

_Yamato_ was the first anime series or movie to win the Seiun Award, a feat not repeated until the film _Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind_ (1984).


Development

Conceived in 1973 by producer Yoshinobu Nishizaki, the project underwent heavy revisions. Originally intended to be an outer-space variation on _Lord of the Flies_, the project at first was titled "Asteroid Ship Icarus" and had a multinational teenage crew journeying through space in a hollowed-out asteroid in search of the planet Iscandar. There was to be much discord among the crew; many of them acting purely out of self-interest and for personal gain. The enemy aliens were originally called Rajendora.[6][7]


Plot

In the year 2199, an alien race known as the Gamilas (Gamilons in the English _Star Blazers_ dub) unleash radioactive meteorite bombs on Earth, rendering the planet's surface uninhabitable.[8] Humanity has retreated into deep underground cities, but the radioactivity is slowly affecting them as well, with humanity's extinction estimated in one year. Earth's space fleet is hopelessly outclassed by the Gamilas and all seems lost until a message capsule from a mysterious crashed spaceship is retrieved on Mars. The capsule yields blueprints for a faster-than-light engine and an offering of help from Queen Starsha of the planet Iscandar in the Large Magellanic Cloud. She says that her planet has a device, the Cosmo-Cleaner D (Cosmo DNA), which can cleanse Earth of its radiation damage.[9]

The inhabitants of Earth secretly build a massive spaceship inside the ruins of the gigantic Japanese battleship _Yamato_ which lies exposed at the former bottom of the ocean location where she was sunk in World War II. This becomes the "Space Battleship Yamato" for which the story is titled. In the English _Star Blazers_ dub, the ship is noted as being the historical _Yamato_, but is then renamed the _Argo_ (after the ship of Jason and the Argonauts).

Using Starsha's blueprints, they equip the new ship with a space warp drive, called the "wave motion engine", and a new, incredibly powerful weapon at the bow called the "Wave Motion Gun". The is capable of converting the vacuum of space into tachyon energy, as well as functioning like a normal rocket engine, and providing essentially infinite power to the ship, it enables the _Yamato_ to "ride" the wave of tachyons and travel faster than light. The , also called the Dimensional Wave Motion Explosive Compression Emitter, is the "trump card" of the Yamato that functions by connecting the Wave Motion Engine to the enormous firing gate at the ship's bow, enabling the tachyon energy power of the engine to be fired in a stream directly forwards. Enormously powerful, it can vaporize a fleet of enemy ships—or a small continent (as seen in the first season, fifth episode)—with one shot; however, it takes a brief but critical period to charge before firing.

A crew of 114 departs for Iscandar in the _Yamato_ to retrieve the radiation-removing device and return to Earth within the one-year deadline. Along the way, they discover the motives of their blue-skinned adversaries: the planet Gamilas, sister planet to Iscandar, is dying; and its leader, Lord Desslar (Desslok in the _Star Blazers_ dub), is trying to irradiate Earth enough for his people to move there, at the expense of the "barbarians" he considers humanity to be.[10]

The first season contained 26 episodes, following the _Yamato_{{'}}s voyage out of the Milky Way Galaxy and back again. A continuing story, it features the declining health of _Yamato_{{'}}s Captain Okita (Avatar in the _Star Blazers_ dub), and the transformation of the brash young orphan Susumu Kodai (Derek Wildstar) into a mature officer, as well as his budding romance with female crewmember Yuki Mori (Nova Forrester). The foreign edits tend to play up the individual characters, while the Japanese original is often more focused on the ship itself.[11] In a speech at the 1995 Anime Expo, series episode director Noboru Ishiguro said low ratings and high production expenses forced producer Yoshinobu Nishizaki to trim down the episode count from the original 39 episodes to only 26. The 13 episodes would have introduced Captain Harlock as a new series character.[12]

Movie edition

The series was condensed into a 130-minute-long movie by combining elements from a few key episodes of the first season. Additional animation was created for the movie (such as the scenes on Iscandar) or recycled from the series' test footage (such as the opening sequence). The movie, which was released in Japan on August 6, 1977, was edited down further and dubbed into English in 1978; entitled _Space Cruiser Yamato_ or simply _Space Cruiser_, it was only given a limited theatrical release in Europe and Latin America, where it was called __ (_Star Patrol_, in Brazilian Portuguese) or __ (_Starship Intrepid_, in Spanish), though it was later released on video in most countries.

Sequels

_Farewell to Space Battleship Yamato_ (1978)

The success of the _Yamato_ movie in Japan eclipsed that of the local release of _Star Wars_, leading to the production of a second movie that would end the story. Also going by the name _ Yamato_, _Farewell to Space Battleship Yamato_, set in the year 2201, shows the _Yamato_ crew going up against the White Comet Empire, a mobile city fortress called Gatlantis, from the Andromeda Galaxy. A titanic space battle results in the crew going out on a suicide mission to save humanity. The film has been considered as a non-canonical, alternate timeline.

_Space Battleship Yamato II_ (1978)

Viewer dissatisfaction with the ending of _Farewell to Space Battleship Yamato_ prompted the production of a second _Yamato_ television season which retconned the film and presented a slightly different plot against Zōdah (Prince Zordar in the _Star Blazers_ dub) and his Comet Empire, and ended without killing off the _Yamato_ or its primary characters. Like _Farewell_, the story is set in the year 2201, and expands the film story to 26 episodes. This second season featured additional plots such as a love story between Teresa (Trelaina) and _Yamato_ crew member Daisuke Shima (Mark Venture), and an onboard antagonism between Kodai and Saito (Knox), leader of a group of space marines.

Footage from _Farewell to Space Battleship Yamato_ was reused in the second season, particularly in the opening titles. The sequence of the _Yamato_ launching from water was also reused in two of the subsequent movies.

_Yamato: The New Voyage_ (1979)

The television movie _Yamato: The New Voyage_ (aka _Yamato: The New Journey_), came next, featuring a new enemy, the Black Nebula Empire. The story opens in late 2201. In the film, later modified into a theatrical movie, Desslar sees his homeworld, Gamilas, destroyed by the grey-skinned aliens, and its twin planet Iscandar next in line for invasion. He finds an eventual ally in the _Yamato_, then on a training mission under deputy captain Kodai.

_Be Forever Yamato_ (1980)

The theatrical movie _Be Forever Yamato_, set in the year 2202, sees the Black Nebula Empire launch a powerful weapon at Earth, a hyperon bomb which will annihilate humanity if they resist a full-scale invasion. The _Yamato_, under new captain, Yamanami, travels to the aliens' home galaxy only to discover what appears to be a future Earth—defeated and ruled by the enemy. Appearing in this film is Sasha, the daughter of Queen Starsha of Iscandar and Mamoru Kodai (Susumu's older brother).

_Space Battleship Yamato III_ (1980)

Following these movies, a third season of the television series was produced, broadcast on Japanese television in 1980. Its date was not mentioned in the broadcast, but design documents, as well as anime industry publications, cited the year 2205. In the story, the Sun is hit by a stray proton missile from a nearby battle between forces of the Galman Empire and Bolar Federation. This missile greatly accelerates nuclear fusion in the Sun, and humanity must either evacuate to a new home or find a means of preventing a supernova. During the course of the story, it is learned that the people of the Galman Empire are actually the forebears of Desslar and the Gamilas race. Desslar and the remnants of his space fleet have found and liberated Galman from the Bolar Federation. Originally conceived as a 52-episode story, funding cuts meant the season had to be truncated to 25 episodes, with a corresponding loss of overall story development. This third season was adapted into English several years after the original _Star Blazers_ run and, to the dissatisfaction of fans, used different voice actors than did the earlier seasons.

_Final Yamato_ (1983)

Premiering in Japanese theaters on March 19, 1983, _Final Yamato_ reunites the crew one more time to combat the threat of the Denguilu, a militaristic alien civilization that intends to use the water planet, Aquarius, to flood Earth and resettle there (having lost their home planet to a galactic collision). Captain Okita, who was found to be in cryogenic sleep since the first season, returns to command the _Yamato_ and sacrifices himself to stop the Denguili's plan. Susumu and Yuki also get married.

The story is set in the year 2203, contradicting earlier assumptions that its predecessor, _Yamato III_, took place in 2205. Having a running time of 165 minutes, Final Yamato holds the record of being the longest animated film ever made, a record which has yet to be surpassed as of 2019.

_Yamato 2520_ (1994)

In the mid-1990s, Nishizaki attempted to create a sequel to _Yamato_, set hundreds of years after the original. _Yamato 2520_ was to chronicle the adventures of the eighteenth starship to bear the name, and its battle against the Seiren Federation. Much of the continuity established in the original series (including the destruction of Earth's moon) is ignored in this sequel.

In place of Leiji Matsumoto, American artist Syd Mead (_∀ Gundam_, _Blade Runner_, _Tron_ and _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_) provided the conceptual art.

Due to the bankruptcy of Nishizaki's company Office Academy (former Academy Productions), and legal disputes with Matsumoto over the ownership of the _Yamato_ copyrights, the series was never finished and only three episodes were produced.

_Space Battleship Great Yamato_ (2000)

is a graphic novel comic created by the animator Leiji Matsumoto.[13][14] For a time it was streaming online.[15] However this has since stopped.

_New Space Battleship Yamato_ (2004, cancelled)

In March 2002, a Tokyo court ruled that Yoshinobu Nishizaki legally owned the _Yamato_ copyrights. Nishizaki and Matsumoto eventually settled, and Nishizaki pushed ahead with developing a new Yamato television series. Project proposals for a 26-episode television series were drawn up in early 2004, but no further work was done with Tohoku Shinsha not backing the project. American series expert Tim Eldred was able to secure a complete package of art, mecha designs, and story outline at an auction over Japanese store Mandarake in April 2014.[16]

Set 20 years after Final Yamato, the series would have shown Susumu Kodai leading a salvage operation for the remains of the Yamato. The ship is rebuilt as the Earth Defense Force builds a second Space Battleship Yamato to combat the Balbard Empire, an alien race that has erected a massive honeycombed cage called Ru Sak Gar, over Earth in a bid to stop the human race's spacefaring efforts. A feature film to be released after the series ended would have featured the original space battleship fighting the Balbards' attempt to launch a black hole at Earth. Kodai, Yuki, and Sanada are the only original series characters who would have returned in the series.

_Great Yamato No. Zero_ (2004)

is the second original animated video based on Space Battleship Yamato[17]

The story begins in 3199, when a mighty enemy attacks the Milky Way from a neighbouring galaxy, and defeats the Milky Way Alliance, reducing them to just six fleets. After the Alliance headquarters is destroyed, and when the collapse of the central Milky Way Alliance is imminent, the Great Yamato "Zero" embarks on a mission to assist the Milky Way Alliance in one last great battle.

_Yamato: Resurrection_ (2009)

Although New Space Battleship Yamato was sent to the discard pile, Nishizaki began work on a new movie titled , set after the original series, while Matsumoto planned a new _Yamato series_. However, additional legal conflicts stalled both projects until August 2008, when Nishizaki announced plans for the release of his film on December 12, 2009.[18][19]

Set 17 years after the events of _Final Yamato_, _Resurrection_ brings together some members of the _Yamato_ crew, who lead Earth's inhabitants to resettle in a far-flung star system after a black hole is discovered, which will destroy the solar system in three months.


Remakes

Live-action film (2010)

Released on December 1, 2010, _Space Battleship Yamato_ is the franchise's first live-action film. Directed by Takashi Yamazaki, the movie stars Takuya Kimura as Susumu Kodai and Meisa Kuroki as Yuki. It was revealed originally that the plot would be based on that of the 1974 series.[20][21] However, an official trailer released during June 2010 on Japanese television has also shown elements from the series' second season (1978).

_Yamato 2199_ (2012)

Debuting in Japanese cinemas on April 7, 2012, _2199_ is a remake of the 1974 series. Yutaka Izubuchi serves as supervising director, with character designs by Nobuteru Yuki, and Junichiro Tamamori and Makoto Kobayashi in charge of mecha and conceptual designs. The series is a joint project of Xebec and AIC. Hideaki Anno designed the new series' opening sequence.[22]

_Yamato 2202_ (2017)

The sequel to the first remake heptalogy, and debuting in Japanese Cinemas on February 25, 2017, _2202_ is a remake of the second series, with Nobuyoshi Habara as director and Harutoshi Fukui as writer. Most of the staff and original cast from the first remake were brought back to the project. It is animated by Xebec.


Timeline(s)

With the retelling of _ Yamato_ as the open-ended _Yamato II_ television series (ending in late 2201), _ Yamato_ was redesignated as a discardable, alternate timeline. The follow-on film, _Yamato: New Journey_, took place in late 2201; and its successor, _Be Forever Yamato_, in early 2202. _Yamato III_ was commonly believed to be set in 2205 (several printed publications used this date, although it was never stated in the show's broadcast). But the following film, _Final Yamato_, was set in 2203. The opening narration of _Final_ mentioned the Bolar/Galman conflict, implying that the date for _Yamato III_ was to be regarded as some time between 2202 and 2203 (making for an unrealistic and compressed timeline).

It is not known if this change was due to the lackluster response to _Yamato III_, the production staff's dissatisfaction with the truncated series (additionally, Nishizaki and Matsumoto had limited involvement with it), or a mere oversight.

In 2220, the ship is rebuilt following the events of _Final Yamato_. The new captain of the ship is Susumu Kodai, who was the main character in the previous movies. This told in _Space Battleship Yamato: Resurrection_ that it is set 17 years after _Final Yamato_.

Space Battleship Yamato arcade game

Space Battleship Yamato was a 1985 Japanese exclusive Laserdisc video game designed by Taito which was based on the television series of the same name.[23][24]


Characters

The _Space Battleship Yamato_ series generally involves themes of brave sacrifice, noble enemies, and respect for heroes lost in the line of duty. This can be seen as early as the second episode of the first season, which recounts the defeat of the original battleship _Yamato_ while sailors and pilots from both sides salute her as she sinks (this scene was cut from the English dub, but later included on the _Star Blazers_ DVD release). The movies spend much time showing the crew visiting monuments to previous missions and recalling the bravery of their fallen comrades. Desslar, the enemy defeated in the first season and left without a home or a people, recognizes that his foes are fighting for the same things he fought for and, eventually, becomes Earth's most important ally.


English title

For many years, English-language releases of the anime bore the title _Space Cruiser Yamato_. This romanization has appeared in Japanese publications because Nishizaki, a sailing enthusiast who owned a cruiser yacht, ordered that this translation be used out of love for his boat. However, in reference to naval nomenclature, it is technically inaccurate, as means "battleship" and not "cruiser" (which in Japanese would be ). Leiji Matsumoto's manga adaptation was titled _Cosmoship Yamato_.[25][26] Today, _Yamato_ releases, including the Voyager Entertainment DVD, are marketed either as _Star Blazers_ or _Space Battleship Yamato_.

_Star Blazers_ (1979) is a heavily edited dubbed version for the United States market produced by Westchester Film Corporation. Voyager Entertainment released DVD volumes and comic adaptations of the anime years later.

[1] "_Yamato_ also caused a paradigm shift in animation. Departing from the usual plot of "good vanquishes evil" so common in children’s programming, it acknowledged the enemy’s necessity in attacking Earth: the Gamilons must relocate, as their home planet is doomed to die. The highly realistic design of "mecha" (meka) — mechanical vessels and weapons — also set the standard for the genre of "mecha-robot anime".
