_PARALOGISTIS OCHRURA_ is a moth of the Scythrididae family. It was described by Meyrick in 1913. It is found in South Africa (Gauteng).[1]

The wingspan is 11–17 mm. The forewings are white, variably speckled with dark grey and with a transverse fascia of blackish irroration near the base, becoming obsolescent near the dorsum. There is a slightly oblique grey fascia mixed with blackish at two-thirds, narrow on the costa and gradually dilated posteriorly to the dorsum, where it is extended vaguely to near the tornus. There is a grey blotch speckled with darker extending along the posterior half of the costa to the apex and a blackish dot above the tornus. The hindwings are grey.[2]

The larvae feed on _Acacia zanzibarica_.[3]
