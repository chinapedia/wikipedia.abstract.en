The NDH CLASS RAILCAR was a type of diesel railcar designed by Commonwealth Engineering and built by the Gloucester Railway Carriage & Wagon Company in England for the Commonwealth Railways, Australia in 1954.[1][2][3]

The first entered service on the narrow gauge on the Central Australia Railway in December 1954. Two were transferred to the North Australia Railway in July 1955 having been transported by road from Alice Springs to Larrimah.[4][5][6][7][8] Following the opening of the Marree line in 1957 some were converted to standard gauge trailer cars. Following the cessation of North Australia Railway services in 1966, these railcars returned south and were also converted.[9] All had been withdrawn by 1977.[10]
