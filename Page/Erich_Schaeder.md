ERICH SCHAEDER (22 December 1861, in Clausthal – 18 February 1936, in Berlin) was a German Protestant theologian.

He studied theology at the universities of Berlin and Greifswald, where in 1891 he qualified as a lecturer. In 1894 he became an associate professor of theology at the University of Königsberg, and later on, served as a full professor at the universities of Kiel (from 1899) and Breslau (from 1918).[1]

Schaeder was a leading advocate of theocentric theology. Through his criticism of 19th-century theological anthropocentrism, he was one of the founders of dialectical theology.[2]
