_SUPERHYPERCUBE_ is a puzzle video game by Kokoromi and Polytron for PlayStation VR. It was released on October 13, 2016.


Development

An early version of the game was distributed as freeware in 2008.[1] The developers were inspired by science fiction films and the Light and Space minimalist art movement.[2] The team canceled Oculus Rift support after revelations that Oculus founder Palmer Luckey had bankrolled an Internet shitposting organization backing Donald Trump's 2016 United States presidential campaign.[3] _SuperHyperCube_ had been previously announced as exclusive for PlayStation VR.[4]
