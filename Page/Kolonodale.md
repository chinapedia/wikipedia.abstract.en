KOLONODALE is a town and the administrative centre of the North Morowali Regency, in Central Sulawesi Province of Indonesia.

Kolonodale was originally the capital of Morowali Regency. In 2004, the plan to shift the Morowali capital southeast from Kolonodale to Bungku left non-Bungku residents, both Protestant and Muslim, feeling further disenfranchised.[1]

On April 12, 2013, North Morowali Regency was established, partitioned from the Morowali Regency, with Kolonodale as its principal town.[2]
