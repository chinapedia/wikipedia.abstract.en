The _BALTIMORE GAZETTE_, also known as the _BALTIMORE DAILY GAZETTE_ and _THE GAZETTE_, was a daily newspaper published in Baltimore, Maryland between 1862 and 1875.[1][2] It broke some high-profile stories including the fact that The Turk, allegedly a chess playing machine, worked because a human chess master was operating it from the inside.

The paper was associated with several high profile figures in publishing and politics, including William Hinson Cole and William Wilkins Glenn.

In 2016, the name was revived in the form of a website which published phony news stories.[3]
