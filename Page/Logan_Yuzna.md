Yuzna starts his film career at the Kingraisin channel, the first music video platform in skateboarding, where Yuzna creates comedy Hip-Hop live action and animated narratives about Skateboarding. Some of these films include "Skaters Paradise" and "All I Need is Red Curbs". Critics have said about Yuzna's work that he "created a genre" especially with his gore parody, "Skaters in Perish". Yuzna released the animation "Where's Stoner at" in 2014; that same year, he accepted an offer from Marvel Animation Studios to join the production team of Marvel's _Avengers Assemble_, working immediately after on Marvel's _Avengers: Ultron Revolution_, and then recruited for a Marvel secret project that was revealed to be Marvel's Spider-Man TV series at New York City Comic-Con 2016.

Yuzna performs in character as the Raisinman in the Kingraisin web series, where he raps and parodies skateboarding and Hip-Hop culture. Some of the episodes have gone viral on the internet, like "Pushin' Mongo". Yuzna started producing instrumentals while living in Barcelona as a teen producer and rapper, featuring his own music in the Raisinman Productions films. Since 2017 Yuzna is part of the Los Angeles improvisational and sketch comedy troupe The Groundlings.

A known skateboarder, Yuzna stars in the 2009 Apple Mac photo campaign, for which he appears skateboarding in Venice Beach, California. Outside of Skateboarding, Yuzna has worked commercially in the arts and fashion industries as a film director in New York Fashion Week, La Biennale di Venezia, and other international events for artists and brands.

Transworld Skateboarding says that "Kingraisin drops Lyrical bangers" in his raps.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]


Recognition

The Kingraisin channel reached worldwide recognition in 2011 when GQ Magazine said Yuzna's rap was "killer" and "needed", and Transworld Skateboarding featured Yuzna as their top YouTuber. Kingraisin's skateboarding narratives are regularly featured in Tony Hawk's RIDE Channel, Thrasher Magazine, Transworld, and SkateBoarder Magazine to name a few. A part of the arts community in Los Angeles, Yuzna is one of the artists interviewed by NPR National Public Radio about Banksy when the street artist reportedly spray-painted prominent walls in Los Angeles during Oscars week. Yuzna is frequently seen at skateboarding events with other skaters, being photographed with Eric Koston at the Spike Jonze Her Oscar celebration in 2014. Yuzna is followed by MTV News for the network's docu-series during the Coachella Music Festival in 2016. Prominent in social media, Yuzna is called a YouTube sensation and becomes the Los Angeles reporter for Empire Magazine, covering events such as The Golden Globe Awards ceremony and red carpet. He has also appeared multiple times as a reporter for Thrasher Magazine's Skateline, portraying the Bob Raisinman character.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33]


Personal life

Logan Yuzna was born in Los Angeles, California, to Cathy and Brian Yuzna. He has 3 siblings, Conan Yuzna, Zoe Yuzna, and Noah Yuzna. Logan grew up on set at his father's Hollywood film productions, and participated as a child actor in the American films Silent Night, Deadly Night, Progeny, Faust: Love of the Damned, and The Dentist 2. At age 11 Logan moved to Barcelona, Spain with his family. He starts skateboarding while living in Barcelona and is named Raisinman, a nickname that would become a character in the Kingraisin universe and, later on, label Yuzna's own production company Raisinman Productions. At age 18, bilingual in both Spanish and English, Yuzna moved back to Los Angeles and studies in Santa Monica College until the institution announces his transfer to UCLA, as published on the cover of their newspaper. In April 2016 Yuzna told MTV that he was romantically involved with actress Diana Lado, while they were both for the network's docu-series surrounding the Coachella music festival. Yuzna has expressed homages to his father's work, artistically and in the media, producing the Brian Yuzna retrospective that showed at the Soho House theater in West Hollywood. Father and son often make appearances together, having been photographed at Hollywood events like the United Nations soiree hosted at producer Brett Ratner's Beverly Hills home in August 2016.[34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43]
