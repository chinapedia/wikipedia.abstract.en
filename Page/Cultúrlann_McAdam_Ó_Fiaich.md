CULTÚRLANN MCADAM Ó FIAICH (AN CHULTÚRLANN) is an Irish language cultural centre in The Gaeltacht Quarter and is located on the Falls Road, Belfast. Opened in 1991, the centre underwent renovation in 2010 and was opened the following year by Irish President Mary McAleese.

The centre is home to an art gallery named after local artist Gerard Dillon, a theatre, restaurant, book shop, offices and conference rooms. In 2011, the centre was estimated to receive over 80,000 visitors per year.[1]


History

1991–2010

Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich was founded in 1991 after the purchase of Broadway Presbyterian Church on Falls Road, Belfast. It is named after 19th century Presbyterian businessman and Gaelic revivalist Robert Shipboy McAdam and 20th century Gaelic scholar Cardinal Tomás Ó Fiaich.[2]

Co-founder Gearóid Ó Cairealláin also founded Raidió Fáilte which aired from the building and Aisling Ghéar, the resident theatre production group.[3] An Chultúrlann was also home to Coláiste Feirste, Northern Ireland's first Irish-medium secondary school with activist Fergus O'Hare serving as principal. The school began with nine pupils.,[4] before the school moved to the nearby Beech Hill House, previously owned by the Riddel family.

In 2010, An Chultúrlann announced a major renovation programme funded by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, Arts Council of Northern Ireland, International Fund for Ireland, Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the Department for Social Development.[5]

2011 – present

The renovated Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich was re-opened by Irish president Mary McAleese on 19 September 2011,[6] to celebrate 20 years since the centre's opening. The extension and renovation cost £1.9million and included the building of an interactive exhibition space and art gallery, named after local artist Gerard Dillon.[7] Also refurbished was An Ceathrú Póilí, an Irish language bookshop within the centre and _Bia_, the restaurant.

BBC Two Northern Ireland aired a documentary on 12 December 2011 to celebrate the reopening.[8]
