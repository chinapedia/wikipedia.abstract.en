GALACTIC TICK DAY is an awareness and education day that celebrates the movement of the Solar System around the Milky Way galaxy.[1][2][3][4]


Galactic tick

The day occurs on a regular interval of 1.7361 years (or 633.7 days),[5] which is called a Galactic tick. The interval is derived from one centi-arcsecond of a Galactic year, which is the Solar System's roughly 225 million year trip around the galactic center.[6] One Galactic tick is only about .0000077 (1/360*60*60*100) percent of a full Galactic year.[7]


Galactic Tick Day

The first Galactic Tick Day took place one Galactic tick after Hans Lippershey filed the patent for the telescope on October 2, 1608.[8] The first observance of the holiday was on September 29, 2016, the 235th Galactic Tick Day.[9] The second observance was on June 26, 2018.[10]
