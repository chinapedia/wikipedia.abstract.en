It spanned White Water Creek for .[1] The Jones County Board of Supervisors received a petition for a bridge at this location in September 1877. While they agreed there was a need, they put off erecting a bridge here until other bridges in the county were completed at major crossings. They finally authorized this bridge in September 1883 and contracted with the Morse Bridge Company of Youngstown, Ohio to erect a single Pratt through truss span here. It was completed in June 1884 for $2,305.[2] The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.[3] It has subsequently been taken down.
