Biography

His father was a parish priest. He graduated from the Roskilde Cathedral School in 1891 and was admitted to the Copenhagen Technical College the following year, where he studied with the artist, . In 1893, he spent one semester at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts with Frederik Vermehren.[1] That same year, he was influenced by an exhibition at Den Frie Udstilling, featuring the works of Van Gogh and Gauguin.

Upon returning home, he provided cartoons for the newspapers _København_ and _Politiken_,[3] but his paintings were rejected by Den Frie Udstilling and the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition. An attempt to find employment at the _Fliegende Blätter_ was also unsuccessful.

During this time, he illustrated and wrote the text for two works; _Omkring Midlet_ (About the Means) and _Dekadent Barbari_ (Decadent Barbarism), which were published posthumously by his friend, Jens Lund.[4] They consist of mostly satirical stories that have been cited as an influence on the works of Robert Storm Petersen.

In 1903, he was unexpectedly dismissed from _Politiken_. He had been intensively involved with the creation of a set of books that would summarize his life and philosophy, and was already overworked, so this new setback precipitated a physical and mental breakdown. He was admitted to Copenhagen Municipal Hospital and died there a few days later, of unspecified causes.[5]

A memorial exhibition was held at Den Frie Udstilling in 1904. Asger Jorn was an admirer of his works and many of them may be seen at the Museum Jorn, Silkeborg.[6]
