TREEBO HOTELS is an Indian budget hotel chain and hospitality service that operates on franchising.[1][2] As of April 2018, Treebo Hotel has over 350 hotels in 80 cities in India.[3][4][5]

It was founded in June 2015 by Sidharth Gupta, Rahul Chaudhary, and Kadam Jeet Jain with the aim of providing high-quality hospitality in the otherwise unorganized and fragmented budget segment of the Indian hospitality industry.[6][7] Treebo Hotels aims to be a budget hotel brand as opposed to competing aggregators and networks like OYO Rooms.[8]

Treebo Hotels is headquartered in Bengaluru, India.[9][10] In mid-2018, online travel agency MakeMyTrip dropped Treebo from their listings which led to a major hit on their revenues. They had to lay off 70-80 employees.[11]

Treebo Hotels losses jumped to Rs 115 Cr in 2018.[12]
