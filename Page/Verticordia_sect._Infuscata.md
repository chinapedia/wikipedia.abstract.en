_VERTICORDIA_ SECT. _INFUSCATA_ is one of eleven sections in the subgenus _Verticordia_. It includes two species of plants in the genus _Verticordia_. Plants in this section are small shrubs with greyish foliage, unusual flowers and an odour of mice. The floral cup has a tuft of hairs around its base, dull purple or cream-coloured flowers with divided sepals and petals with a transparent margin.[1] When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991 he formally described this section, publishing the description in the journal Nuytsia.[2][3] The name _Infuscata_ is derived from the Latin word _fusca_ meaning "dark" or "dusky"[4] referring to the dullish colour of plants in this section.[5]

The type species for this section is _Verticordia oxylepis_ and the other species is _V. longistylis_.[6]
