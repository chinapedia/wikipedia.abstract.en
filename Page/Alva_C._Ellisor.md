ALVA CHRISTINE ELLISOR (1892–1964) was a geologist and one of the first female stratigraphers in North America.[1]


Early life

Alva C. Ellisor was born on April 26, 1892 in Galveston, Texas. At the age of eight, she survived the 1900 Great Galveston Hurricane. She had two infant brothers who were killed in the event.[2] After her secondary education in Galveston’s public schools, Ellisor received a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Geology in University of Texas.[3] After graduating, Ellisor held a teaching position in Ball High School.[4] This was short-lived as she decided to go back to university and study in hopes of becoming a professor. At the same time Ellisor was studying, she was also doing research in the field of geology under the supervision of her instructors, Professor Francis L. Whitney and Professor Hal P. Bybee. Two years later, in 1918, Ellisor began working as a professor at the University of Kansas teaching geology and in 1919 was able to apply her experience while working for the Kansas Geological Survey.[5][6]


Career

In 1920, Ellisor switched professions again and started working for the Humble Oil & Refining Company. She was specifically hired by Wallace Pratt to design a subsurface laboratory which works to show the development of petroleum and natural gas as well as other minerals. This is where she was really able to make a name for herself in the study of petroleum geology as well as making many firsts for women in geology. Ellisor created and opened the laboratory to focus on focusing on Tertiary and Cretaceous time periods. In just a few months after opening the laboratory, she made a major discovery of foraminifera in one of the companies wells at Goose Creek. Her study of foraminifera indicated Oligocene-aged coral reefs on the Damon Mound salt dome in Brazoria County.[7] She was one of the first to see the potential for using foraminifera to correlate rocks from drilling cores.[8] These findings would be the basis of some of her most famous writing for years to come.[9]

Alva C. Ellisor has had a lasting impact in the field of geology as well as paving the way for many women in the field. When she was employed by the Humble Oil & Refining Company to work on a subsurface laboratory, she became the first women to work on one for a company.[10] In her many journals with Joseph A. Cushman, they studied the foraminiferal fauna and discovered fifteen new species and seven new varieties.[11]She was not credited for her discovery in foraminifera in Edgar Owen’s _The Trek of the Oil Finders_, which instead credited J.A Udden, Edwin T. Dumble, Joseph A. Cushman, and Jesse J. Galloway. Yet, the four were convinced of their findings only by the research of Ellisor herself, as well as her co authors Esther Applin and Hedwig Kniker.[12] Ellisor continued to be influential on her own, having her work published by many well known geology organizations in The United States. Of her many achievements, some of her greatest positions in science were being a fellow of the Geological Society of America and being the Vice President for the Houston Geological Society for two years.[13]

Ellisor spent over twenty years working for the Humble Oil & Refining Company until she retired in 1947. Ellisor engaged in acts of philanthropy throughout her career, donating money and her 3000 volume geologic library to the University of Texas.[14] She passed away at the age of seventy-two on September 22, 1964 in Galveston, Texas.[15]
