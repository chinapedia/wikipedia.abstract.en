THE SECRETS were a Toronto punk rock band during the first wave of late 1970s punk. Their line-up consisted of Freddie Pompeii (vocals & harmonica), Chris Haight (guitar), John Hamilton (bass) and Mike Anderson (aka Motor X) on drums.

Most of the band had originally served as the notorious band The Viletones with Pompei as guitarist and Haight on bass behind singer Steven Leckie. When that version of the band broke up in 1978 the band reformed without Leckie, with Pompei moving to vocals and Haight to guitar. John Hamilton, previously a drummer with The Diodes, joined on bass.

Musically the Secrets differed from the Viletones who had been a typically loud, fast and angry punk band of the era. By contrast the Secrets were more of a 1960s garage punk band similar to contemporary bands like the Flaming Groovies, Real Kids and Teenage Head. Their sets included covers of songs like The Isley Brothers "Shout", Roy Orbison's "Pretty Woman", Bo Diddley's "Diddy Wah Diddy", Arthur "Guitar Boogie" Smith's "Guitar Boogie" and "Zoom", a Doo-Wop song by the Collegians.

The band played extensively mostly in Toronto from 1978 to 1979 including an appearance included in _The Last Pogo_ film and soundtrack. They also made a trip to New York to play Max's Kansas City.

They recorded an album, _Success Without College_, in 1979 for Bomb Records. This was followed by a single also on Bomb.

Drug problems brought about the band's demise shortly afterwards.

Their debut album was re-released in 1997 with bonus live tracks.

The band is featured in the documentary _The Last Pogo Jumps Again_.

Mike "Motor X Anderson" died in 2012.
