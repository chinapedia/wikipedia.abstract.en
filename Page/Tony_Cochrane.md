TONY COCHRANE is an Australian businessman, best known for event promotion and sports administration.


Event promotion

Cochrane has been involved in event promotion since the 1970s, and has promoted or produced tours for several international and local artists, including The Rolling Stones, Sammy Davis Jr., Placido Domingo and The Main Event Tour featuring John Farnham, Olivia Newton-John and Anthony Warlow.[1][2] Cochrane once spent a week sleeping on Frank Sinatra's floor in order to convince him to return to tour Australia, despite previously vowing he never would.[3]

Cochrane's theatre credits include _Grease: The Arena Spectacular_ and Australian productions of musicals including _The Sound of Music_, _Annie_ and _Hairspray_, for which he and his fellow producers won a Tony award.[4]


Sports administration

In 1996, Cochrane and three other investors purchased the promotion rights for the Australian Touring Car Championship from IMG for $52,000.[5] In 1997, the series was renamed to V8 Supercars, and expanded to be valued at $330 million when a stake of the sport was sold to Archer Capital in 2011.[6] In 2012, Cochrane retired from his role as executive chairman of V8 Supercars.[7] Cochrane was added to the V8 Supercars Hall of Fame in 2012, becoming the first person to be inducted having not raced in the championship.[8]

In March 2014, Cochrane joined the board of the Gold Coast Suns Australian Football League club, and became chairman in March 2016.[9] In his time as chairman he maintained his reputation for being outspoken and uncompromising, particularly in his relationship with the media.[10] His blunt style has even seen him described as the Donald Trump of the AFL.[11]
