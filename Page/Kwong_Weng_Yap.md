YAP KWONG WENG (born November 11, 1977) is a Singaporean author, business executive and former soldier.[1][2] He is Principal Advisor of KPMG Singapore[3] and co-founder of Triip, a Vietnam-based travel tech company.[4][5]

Between 2014 and 2016 he was the COO of Parami Energy Group in Myanmar, where he managed the group's infrastructure deals, transformation and transparency plans[6] while advocating for the use of clean energy in Myanmar.[7] He has also worked for Jebsen & Jessen (SEA), a regional engineering company as a General Manager who oversaw its expansion into Laos and enhanced its business units in Myanmar. Yap has been named a World Cities Summit Leader in 2014 and a Young Global Leader of the World Economic Forum (2012 to 2017).[8][9]

In May 2016, Yap came to public attention after being featured in an article with the Singapore Straits Times, where he discussed his life and completion of US Navy SEAL training despite suffering from serious injuries.[10] During June of the same year, Marshall Cavendish published _Leap: Journey of a Young Global Leader from Singapore_, a memoir featuring stories of failures and successes in Yap's military training, work stints and world travels.[11] _Kirkus Reviews_ said of _Leap_: "Kwong Weng’s debut memoir recounts a life of remarkable persistence."[12]

On 21 May 2019, Yap was featured by the The Straits Times as a potential political candidate in the Next Singaporean general election. He replied that he does grassroots work "without any specific consideration of candidature".[13]


Background

Early years and education

Born in 1977, Yap grew up in Singapore, and lived in a small 3-room flat in Toa Payoh with his family for over 25 years. He received his secondary education in the now defunct First Toa Payoh Secondary School where he was a member of the National Cadet Corps, and his pre-university education at Jurong Institute, now known as Millennia Institute. At 18, he applied several times to the National University of Singapore (NUS) but was rejected. Instead, Yap decided to join the Singapore Armed Forces Commando Formation while saving up for a college education. The opportunity to pursue tertiary education, however, came many years later.[14]

Yap received a BA in Communication studies with Latin honors at age 30 from the State University of New York at Buffalo[15] with savings earned from the Army. [16] Thereafter, he went on to pursue an MBA from Manchester Business School, and a Master of Public Administration from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy where he received a leadership award in 2012[17] and was profiled as a game changer by NUS magazine published on 1 January 2017.[18] He earned a PhD in crisis management from the University of Glasgow[19] and read peace and conflict studies as a Peace Fellow in Thailand's Chulalongkorn University under a Rotary Foundation Scholarship.[20][21]

Military career

Before entering the private sector, Yap served as a Commando Captain in the Singapore Armed Forces where he was trained as a paratrooper and a ranger. After being commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1998 from Officer Cadet School (Singapore) where he received a Sword of Merit, Yap was posted to 1st Commando Battalion and the Special Forces as a Platoon Commander. In 2001, he went on to attend Class 237 of the United States Navy SEAL selection and training, graduating in February 2002 from the Naval Special Warfare Center in Coronado, California.[22]

Following his return to Singapore, Yap was assigned as an instructor to the Commando Training Wing where he trained rangers in a grueling 65-day program that hones small unit tactics and leadership. He took study leave in 2005 and went back to school as a mature student. He returned to the unit after graduating in 2008 and served as head of leadership development in the Commando Training Institute.[23] That year, comprehensive material on Singapore's Special Forces by Yap was published by Pointer (journal) as a monograph.[24] In 2010, Yap transferred to the Joint Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defence (Singapore) where he worked as an Intelligence analyst who focused on regional counter-terrorism.[25]

Yap served for 13 years and left the SAF in December 2012 for the private sector [26]

Business career

After leaving the military, Yap found it difficult to get work, and applied for many jobs. He wrote to a number of companies requesting interviews but many of these ignored him.[27] In May 2013, Yap was hired as a General Manager of Jebsen & Jessen (SEA). He credits his private sector entry to luck and resilience.

Next in 2014 came a stint as COO of Parami Energy, a Myanmar conglomerate involved in the oil and gas business. He headed the group's transformation and developed transparency plans as international companies entered the country quickly. At the same time, he helped form Triip, a travel tech company in December 2014 that became a successful Asian start-up within a span of two years.

After finding some success with his entrepreneurial ventures in Myanmar, Yap worked as Regional Advisor of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy from April 2017 where he facilitated high-level discussions with business and government leaders in support of the school's wider strategy.

Civil society

Yap is active in community and social initiatives. He was the Secretary-General of the United Nations Association of Singapore (2011 to 2013) where he organized sustainability projects in Singapore and Sarawak with youth groups, civic and academic institutions.[28][29][30] Since 2013, he has been a country chair of non-profit Global Dignity, where he advocates dignity, a fundamental human right, for students in Cambodia.[31] He ran 100km across China's Taklamakan Desert in an ultramarathon to raise awareness for the UN's Millennium Development Goals and gave a TEDx talk on the wider benefits of volunteering.[32][33]


Writing

Yap wrote his first book in 2009, where he developed _Key Perspectives of Special Forces_, a collection of articles by current and former Special Forces set in a monograph with a foreword by Brigadier-General Lam Shiu Tong, former Commander of the Special Operations Task Force. His second book is _Leap: Journey of a Young Global Leader from Singapore_. In August 2016, Teenage Magazine wrote of _Leap_: "the author's proof that humble beginnings in this little red dot can inspire greatness, no matter how young you are".[34] Today, he writes about business and geopolitical issues on Southeast Asia and Myanmar and his articles have appeared in local and regional newspapers. In July 2017, Yap wrote a strong rebuttal via the Straits Times and defended Kishore Mahbubani after Singapore diplomats criticized him for writing an article that discusses Singapore's position as a small state.[35][36]
