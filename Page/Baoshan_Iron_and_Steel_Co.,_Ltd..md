It is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the CSI 300 stock market index.[1]


History

In 2000, the Baosteel Group split, creating the new Baoshan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd., which was listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. It was the largest initial public offering in China up to that time,[2] raising CNY 7.7 billion despite being limited to domestic investors.

In 2004, Baoshan Iron and Steel acquired Meishan Iron and Steel.[3] In October 2012, Baosteel acquired a 71.8% stake in Zhanjiang Iron and Steel from the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government. In the same year, Baosteel invested CNY 8 billion in the third pipeline of the West–East Gas Pipeline, acquiring a 12.8% stake (the pipe was incorporated as a limited company called ). In December 2015, a new company, PetroChina Pipelines (), was formed to manage all three of the West-East pipelines, and existing share capital of the three management companies were converted into the share capital of the new company, giving Baosteel an overall 3.25% stake.[4][5]

In mid-2016, Baosteel Group and China National Petroleum Corporation, both overseen by the SASAC of the State Council, formed a cross ownership arrangement for their listed subsidiaries. After the deal, Baosteel Group held a 0.34% stake in PetroChina, while China National Petroleum Corp. received a 4.86% stake in Baoshan Iron and Steel.[6] On 21–22 September 2016, a merger between Baosteel Group and Wuhan Iron and Steel Group was announced. Baoshan Iron and Steel would take over the listed counterpart from Wuhan Iron and Steel Group in an all-share deal,[7] while all the rights of Wuhan Iron and Steel Group would be transferred to Baosteel Group, as both corporations were supervised by the Central Government's SASAC.
