COOLADDI is a ghost town and locality in the Shire of Murweh, Queensland, Australia.[1][2] The town is west of the city of Brisbane. In 2015, the population was 3 (down from 4 in 2013), all of whom reside at the general store.[3][4]


Geography

The town is in the centre of the locality. The Western railway line passes from east to west through the town and locality; the town was served by the Cooladdi railway station. The Diamantina Developmental Road also passes from east to west through the town and locality.[5]


History

The railway station was originally called _Yarronvale_ after a local pastoral station with the town taking its name from the railway station. However, it was renamed in 1913 to _Cooladdi_, an Aboriginal word meaning _black duck_, to avoid confusion with the pastoral station, which was 15 miles away.[6]

Cooladdi was a railhead for the local pastoral community. At one time, Cooladdi had a school, post office, and police station with a population of about 270 people. As the railway line extended further west, Cooladdi's role and population declined.[7][8]

The Cooladdi State School originally opened on 19 March 1926 as a Provisional School with 9 students under teacher A.W. Marsh. In 1933 a new school building was constructed and the school redesignated as a State School. The school closed on 3 May 1974.[9][10][11]
