The 2016–17 NBB SEASON was the 9th season of the Novo Basquete Brasil, the Brazilian basketball league.[1] Once again this tournament was organized entirely by the Liga Nacional de Basquete (LNB). The NBB also qualified teams for international tournaments such as Liga Sudamericana and FIBA Americas League.

This season fifteen teams played each other in the regular season. At the end of the home and away matches round the top four teams qualified for the quarterfinals of the playoffs automatically, while the teams finishing in the 5th and 12th place participated in the first round of the playoffs to determine the other four teams in the quarterfinals, in a five-match series. This season maintained 15/16's playoff method of best of 5 games, played on the 1-2-1-1 format.

For this season, the last two regular season placed teams were relegated to the Liga Ouro, the NBB second division. Only the Liga Ouro winner received the right to contest NBB in the next year.
