BUNDLE THEORY, originated by the 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume, is the ontological theory about objecthood in which an object consists only of a collection (_bundle_) of properties, relations or tropes.

According to bundle theory, an object consists of its properties and nothing more: thus neither can there be an object without properties nor can one even _conceive_ of such an object; for example, bundle theory claims that thinking of an apple compels one also to think of its color, its shape, the fact that it is a kind of fruit, its cells, its taste, or at least one other of its properties. Thus, the theory asserts that the apple is no more than the collection of its properties. In particular, there is no _substance_ in which the properties are _inherent_.


Arguments for the bundle theory

The difficulty in conceiving of or describing an object without also conceiving of or describing its properties is a common justification for bundle theory, especially among current philosophers in the Anglo-American tradition.

The inability to comprehend any aspect of the thing other than its properties implies, this argument maintains, that one cannot conceive of a _bare particular_ (a _substance_ without properties), an implication that directly opposes substance theory. The conceptual difficulty of _bare particulars_ was illustrated by John Locke when he described a _substance_ by itself, apart from its properties, as _"something, I know not what. [...] The idea then we have, to which we give the general name substance, being nothing but the supposed, but unknown, support of those qualities we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist sine re substante, without something to support them, we call that support substantia; which, according to the true import of the word, is, in plain English, standing under or upholding."_[1]

Whether a _relation_ of an object is one of its properties may complicate such an argument. However, the argument concludes that the conceptual challenge of _bare particulars_ leaves a bundle of properties and nothing more as the only possible conception of an object, thus justifying bundle theory.


Objections to the bundle theory

Bundle theory maintains that properties are _bundled_ together in a collection without describing how they are tied together. For example, bundle theory regards an apple as red, four inches (100 mm) wide, and juicy but lacking an underlying _substance_. The apple is said to be a _bundle of properties_ including redness, being four inches (100 mm) wide, and juiciness.

Critics question how bundle theory accounts for the properties' _compresence_ (the _togetherness_ relation between those properties) without an underlying _substance_. Critics also question how any two given properties are determined to be properties of the same object if there is no _substance_ in which they both _inhere_.

Traditional bundle theory explains the _compresence_ of properties by defining an object as a collection of properties _bound_ together. Thus, different combinations of properties and relations produce different objects. Redness and juiciness, for example, may be found together on top of the table because they are part of a bundle of properties located on the table, one of which is the "looks like an apple" property.

By contrast, substance theory explains the _compresence_ of properties by asserting that the properties are found together because it is the _substance_ that has those properties. In substance theory, a _substance_ is the thing in which properties _inhere_. For example, redness and juiciness are found on top of the table because redness and juiciness _inhere_ in an apple, making the apple red and juicy.

The _bundle theory of substance_ explains _compresence_. Specifically, it maintains that properties' compresence itself engenders a _substance_. Thus, it determines _substancehood_ empirically by the _togetherness_ of properties rather than by a _bare particular_ or by any other non-empirical underlying strata. The _bundle theory of substance_ thus rejects the substance theories of Aristotle, Descartes, and more recently, J. P. Moreland, Jia Hou, Joseph Bridgman, Quentin Smith, and others.


Bundle theory and Buddhism

The Buddhist Madhyamaka philosopher, Chandrakirti, used the aggregate nature of objects to demonstrate the lack of essence in what is known as the sevenfold reasoning. In his work, _Guide to the Middle Way_ (Sanskrit: _Madhyamakāvatāra_), he says:

He goes on to explain what is meant by each of these seven assertions, but briefly in a subsequent commentary he explains that the conventions of the world do not exist essentially when closely analyzed, but exist only through being taken for granted, without being subject to scrutiny that searches for an essence within them.

Another view of the Buddhist theory of the self, especially in early Buddhism, is that the Buddhist theory is essentially an eliminativist theory. According to this understanding, the self can not be reduced to a bundle because there is nothing that answers to the concept of a self. Consequently, the idea of a self must be eliminated.[2]
