The 1922 ALABAMA GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION took place on November 7, 1922, in order to elect the Governor of Alabama. Democratic incumbent Thomas Kilby was term-limited, and could not seek a second consecutive term.


Democratic primary

At the time this election took place, Alabama, as with most other southern states, was solidly Democratic, and the Republican Party had such diminished influence that the Democratic primary was the _de facto_ contest for state offices; after winning the Democratic primary it was a given you would win the general election.
