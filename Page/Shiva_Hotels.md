SHIVA HOTELS is a privately owned United Kingdom based hotel group founded in 2003[1] by former Lehman Brothers derivatives trader Rishi Sachdev.[2]


History

In 2013 the company purchased the Millennium Bridge House hotel from American private equity firm The Carlyle Group, for £87.6m.[3]

In 2014 the company purchased the Kingsway Hall Hotel for £96m.[4]

In February 2015 it was reported that the group had placed two Ramada hotels it owned up for sale for £22m free of any brand tie.[5]

In October 2015 it was reported that the group was developing four unbranded luxury hotels in central London.[6]

In 2016 it acquired the site of the Welbeck Street Car Park for redevelopment as a hotel[7] after Historic England decided not to register the structure as a listed building.[8][9]
