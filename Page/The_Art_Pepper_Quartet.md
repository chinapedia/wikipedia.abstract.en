_THE ART PEPPER QUARTET_ is an album by saxophonist Art Pepper featuring sessions from 1956 recorded for the Tampa label.[1][2] The album was rereleased on CD on Original Jazz Classics with bonus tracks in 1994.


Reception

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow observed: "The quality of the music here is high, if brief -- even with his erratic lifestyle, Pepper never made a bad record ... Fine music, but not essential when one considers how many gems Art Pepper recorded during his rather hectic life".[3]
