AUTISM ROCKS is a United Kingdom-based charitable organization founded by Sanjay Shah[1] to raise awareness about autism through charitable music events. All funds raised by Autism Rocks will go to the Autism Research Trust, which in turn supports research by the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University.

Autism Rocks gained international popularity after organizing an event[2] with late music artist Prince. _The Guardian_ reported[3] that Prince 'love-bombed' the crowd. Artists such as Zayn Malik,[4] Lenny Kravitz,[5] Snoop Dogg and Ricky Martin[6] have also participated.

With the help of the Dubai government, Autism Rocks is building a permanent venue for music events in Dubai, to be called the Autism Rocks Arena,[7] which can accommodate 25,000 people and 6,000 of them are air-conditioned.[8] The construction is expected to be completed by 2017, and the estimated cost of the venue will be a million UAE dirhams.

Autism Rocks is also building the _Autism Rocks Support Centre_.[9][10] The Autism Rocks Support Centre will be one of the first not-for-profit autism centres in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The Autism Rocks Support Centre will offer the following services: applied behavioural analysis (ABA), occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, child social skills, school consultation sessions, and child play therapy sessions.
