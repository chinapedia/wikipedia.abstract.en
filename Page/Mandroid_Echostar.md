History

_MANDROID ECHOSTAR EP_ (2012)
The band finished writing their debut self titled EP in the winter of 2011 and recorded in Sundown Studios, owned and operated by Jordan Valeriote who engineered, mixed and co-produced the EP. The album was mastered at Masterdisk in New York City by Roger Lian. The _Mandroid Echostar EP_ was released on April 22, 2012.

_CITADELS_ (2013)
Mandroid Echostar announced an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign for their second EP, _Citadels_, in March 2013. The band offered merchandise and fan experience packages and eventually raised $7,480 toward the production of the EP. The band once again chose to record at Sundown Studios with Jordan Valeriote in their hometown of Guelph. Recording began on April 15, 2013 and the EP was released on November 13, 2013.

After gaining traction online, the band signed to Distort Records in late 2013.

_CORAL THRONE_ (2016–PRESENT)
In 2014 Mandroid Echostar began writing their debut full length record and first release with Distort Entertainment. The album, _Coral Throne_, was recorded in December 2014 and January 2015 at Vespa Studios in Toronto, with Juno award winning producers, Eric Ratz and Harry Hess. _Coral Throne_ was written as a concept album inspired by the histories of colonialism, cultural genocide, and the clash of organized religion and traditional spirituality.

Throughout the writing process, the band made many notable appearances such as performing in direct support of Megadeth, playing the main stage at Koifest (Kitchener) alongside Every Time I Die and Foxy Shazam, as well as the main stage at Lachie Music Festival (Cayuga Speedway - Hagersville, Ontario) with July Talk and The Trews.

In an attempt to promote _Coral Throne_, Mandroid Echostar embarked on the _Kezia X_ tour across Ontario with Protest the Hero.[4] The album was released on January 15, 2016.[5] Ciccia was featured on the song "Cataract" by Protest the Hero which appeared on their 2016 EP, _Pacific Myth_.

The band has announced that they are currently writing new music, expected to be debuted on tour in 2017.
