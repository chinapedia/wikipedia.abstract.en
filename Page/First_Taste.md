The First Taste}}

_FIRST TASTE_ is the debut album by American band Potliquor released in November 1970.

While First Taste never quite broke onto the _Billboard_ album chart, the magazine did report in mid October/early November 1970 that "Riverboat", a single from the album was being played at the University of Wisconsin radio station[1] and at Queens College in Queens, New York[2] and again in early November that the album was receiving airplay by radio stations run by Southern Methodist University and the University of Minnesota.[3] They also posted a notice later in the month that the GRT Corporation, the corporate owner of Janus Records, was generating "much excitement behind its debut album by Potliquor, _First Taste_" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[4]
