ANDROPHAGI (, literally "man-eaters") was an ancient nation of cannibals north of Scythia (according to Herodotus[1]), probably in the forests between the upper waters of the Dnepr and Don.[2] These people may have assisted the Scythians when King Darius the Great led a Persian invasion into what is now Southern Russia.


Etymology

Historian Marija Gimbutas has hypothesized[3] that "Androphagoi" is a Greek translation of *mard-xwaar "man-eater" in the old North Iranian language of the Scythians. From *mard-xwaar one can derive "Mordva" or "Mordvin", the Russian name of the Finno-Ugrian Erzya and Moksha peoples of east-central European Russia. From Herodotus we can deduce a location for the Androphagoi that is approximately the same as that occupied by the modern Mordvins.


Ancient accounts

Herodotus first wrote of _andropophagi_ in his _Histories_, where he described them as one of several tribes near Scythia. An extra note indicates that the _andropophagi_ are cannibals, as reflected in their name:

Pliny the Elder later wrote in his _Naturalis Historia_ that the same cannibals near Scythia wore the scalps of men on their chest.
