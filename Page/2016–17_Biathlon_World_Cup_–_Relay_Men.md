The 2016–17 BIATHLON WORLD CUP – RELAY MEN started on Sunday 11 December, 2016 in Pokljuka and finished on Sunday 5 March, 2017 in Pyeongchang. The defending team was Norway.

The winning team was Russia.


Competition format

The relay teams consist of four biathletes. Every athlete's leg is skied over three laps for a total of , with two shooting rounds: one prone and one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually from the spare round holders or from bullets deposited by the athlete into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still standing targets, one penalty loop must be taken for each remaining target. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of their position in the race), then for the remainder of the relay, the athletes shoot at the lane corresponding to the position they arrived (arrive at the range in 5th place, shoot at lane five).
