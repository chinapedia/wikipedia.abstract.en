Water is obtained from rock-cut cisterns, and running water in the Wady el Hajeir."[2] They further noted: "There are three caves and a lintel now in use in the village, with a Greek inscription. There are remains of vaults, and the modern houses are built of ancient materials ; several rock-cut cisterns."[3]
