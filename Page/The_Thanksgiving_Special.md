Plot

Mordecai and Rigby accidentally wreck the park’s Thanksgiving dinner by playing football in the house. The other park workers decide to try to replace the meal before their families arrive, refusing to let Mordecai and Rigby help. The duo then sees a commercial on TV advertising a contest to write a Thanksgiving song with the chance of winning a “turducken,” (turkey+duck+chicken.) They decide to enter the contest, but quickly find that writing the song isn’t as easy as they thought. Meanwhile, Benson, Pops, and Skips go to the store for another turkey, and get in a battle over the last one in stock, which is eventually run over in the street. Muscle Man and High-Five Ghost go out for more sides, and get in an endzone dance competition with a football player. Mordecai and Rigby get caught in traffic and get a ride from Margaret’s father in his weather helicopter. They arrive just in time to enter, still very unprepared. The previous entry, which a billionaire paid a group of professional singers to write and perform, is the clear favorite. As they are about to start, Thomas informs them that their families’ flights have been delayed to the following day. They decide to sing about how family and friends are more important than food, and win the contest. However, the billionaire who paid for the previous entry steals the turducken. The rest of the park workers, who saw the song on TV, decide to work with their antagonists to get it back. They catch his blimp, and he reveals that the reason he wants the turducken is because it has a golden wishbone that actually grants wishes, and he wants to end Thanksgiving. Mordecai and Rigby fall out of the blimp, but not before swiping the wishbone. They wish to be safe at home with their families, and break the bone just in time. After appearing back at the house, Thomas informs them he was mistaken about the flights being delayed, and their families are already there and have replaced the dinner.
