_' Henry Leslie Brooke_', (12 September 1910 – 9 November 1967[1]) was a British racing driver from England. He competed in various classes of racing, including non-championship Formula One, the Le Mans 24-hour race and the Monte Carlo Rally, in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.


Racing career

Pre-World War II

Brooke began his career in 1937 with a self-built special based upon a Riley Imp chassis, with an MG engine.[2] He entered several events that season but without much success.[3] However, he continued to develop the car over the subsequent two seasons and in 1939, using a Riley straight-six engine, achieved three podium finishes at Brooklands, together with a second place at Shelsley Walsh[4] and another second place in the International Trophy at Silverstone.[5]

Post-war

Brooke's career was then interrupted by World War II. He resumed thereafter, initially with his _special_, but subsequently purchased an ERA B-type.[6] With this car he won the Grand Prix des Frontières in 1946[7] and hillclimb events.[8]

In 1947, he finished second in the Swedish Winter Grand Prix[9] in February, but retired from the Vallentuna F1 race held later the same month[10] and from the Jersey F1 race held at Saint Helier.[11] Brooke then purchased an ERA E-type which he used to compete in the Reims Grand Prix retiring after five laps after which he shared Fred Ashmore's ERA B-type which also retired after 33 laps.[12] At the Grand Prix d'Albi, Brooke resumed with his own B-type but having qualified sixth,[13] retired after 18 laps with an engine problem.[14] At the Nice Grand Prix, he finished seventh with the B-type having qualified 20th, and last. He achieved the first-ever race finish (fourth) for the E-type in the 1947 British Empire Trophy at Douglas Circuit[15] and at the 1947 French Grand Prix, qualified in eighth position with the same car but retired after only one lap with an engine problem.[16] He later sold the car back to ERA.[17]

In 1948, Brooke began the season with the B-type, retiring from the Jersey F1 race in April,[18] but claiming third-place in the British Empire Trophy in May,[19] followed by fourth place in the inaugural Zandvoort Grand Prix.[20] He then moved to a Maserati 4CLT, entered by Scuderia Ambrosiana and finished 11th in the Grand Prix d'Albi[21] and 11th in the 1948 Italian Grand Prix under his own name,[22] but was forced to retire from the Monza Grand Prix[23] and the Penya Rhin Grand Prix.[24]

In 1949, Brooke finished seventh in the Grand Prix d'Albi with the Maserati,[25] did not progress past the heats at the International Trophy and retired from the 1949 Italian Grand Prix.[26]

Brooke retired from the 1950 San Remo Grand Prix after eight laps. He subsequently reduced his participation in circuit racing and began competing in rallying with a Triumph TR2.[27] He also competed in the Monte Carlo Rally in 1955 when the Standard Motor Company entered several of their Eight and Ten models.[28]

Brooke made an appearance at the 1954 Goodwood F1 race with a Connaught A-type-Lea Francis. However, having set fastest time in qualifying, he failed to start the race.[29]

Personal life

Brooke was awarded the George Medal during World War II for bravery during the Coventry Blitz.[30] He was also joint-principal of Coventry-based Speed Engines Limited, set up in the mid 1950s to build a British F1 engine. The project was short-lived though and only one example was produced.[31]
