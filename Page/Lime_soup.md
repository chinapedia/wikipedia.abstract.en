LIME SOUP is a traditional dish from the Mexican state of Yucatan, which is made of chicken or some other meat such as pork or beef, lime juice and served with tortilla chips. This dish was originally created by the Mayans and with the passage of time has evolved to take its present form.


History

Lime soup is a traditional dish from Yucatan. Traditional Yucatan cuisine has its origins in the Hispanic and Mayan culture. The combination of meat from animals brought from Europe, the spices, and cooking methods and preparation of multiple local ingredients, resulted in many dishes such as the lime soup.[1] The lime soup as it is known was first created in 1946 by the master called Katún (means "warrior" in Mayan language).[2] Today it is considered as one of the most representative soups of Yucatan.[3]


Ingredients

The taste that characterizes this soup depends on the combination of recipes and ingredients. Its unique flavor is recognized throughout Mexico and the world by the predominance of strong seasonal ingredients.[4] The dish is the result of the isolation from the rest of the country. The lime is not the main ingredient, although it is the one that gives the flavor to the soup. This fruit begins its season in the cold months.[5] The soup is accompanied with chicken, tomato, bell pepper, cilantro, tortilla chips.
