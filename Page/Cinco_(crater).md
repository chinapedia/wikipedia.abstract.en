The crater is one of a group of five (hence the name, Spanish for _five_) craters that were collectively called the Cinco craters during the Apollo 16 mission. The craters were designated _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, and _e_, and the largest (_a_) was officially named _Cinco_ after the mission in 1973 by the IAU.[1][2]

On April 21, 1972, the Apollo 16 Apollo Lunar Module _Orion_ landed about 4Â km north of Cinco, northeast of the prominent South Ray crater. The astronauts John Young and Charles Duke explored the area over the course of three EVAs using a Lunar Roving Vehicle, or rover. They drove up Stone Mountain to Station 4, about 80 m west of Cinco crater, on EVA 2. The primary goal of sampling on Stone Mountain was to attempt to sample the Descartes Formation, although it remains unclear if the Descartes was sampled.[3]
