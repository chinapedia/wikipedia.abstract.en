The CUT-UP TECHNIQUE (or _découpé_ in French) is an aleatory literary technique in which a written text is cut up and rearranged to create a new text. The concept can be traced to at least the Dadaists of the 1920s, but was popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by writer William S. Burroughs, and has since been used in a wide variety of contexts.


Technique

The cut-up and the closely associated fold-in are the two main techniques:

-   _Cut-up_ is performed by taking a finished and fully linear text and cutting it in pieces with a few or single words on each piece. The resulting pieces are then rearranged into a new text, such as in poems by Tristan Tzara as described in his short text, _TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM_.[1]
-   _Fold-in_ is the technique of taking two sheets of linear text (with the same linespacing), folding each sheet in half vertically and combining with the other, then reading across the resulting page, such as in _The Third Mind_. It is Burroughs and Gysin's joint development.[2]

William Burroughs cited T. S. Eliot's 1922 poem, _The Waste Land_, and John Dos Passos' _U.S.A._ trilogy, which incorporated newspaper clippings, as early examples of the cut ups he popularized.

Gil J. Wolman developed cut-up techniques as part of his lettrist practice in the early 1950s.

Also in the 1950s, painter and writer Brion Gysin more fully developed the cut-up method after accidentally re-discovering it. He had placed layers of newspapers as a mat to protect a tabletop from being scratched while he cut papers with a razor blade. Upon cutting through the newspapers, Gysin noticed that the sliced layers offered interesting juxtapositions of text and image. He began deliberately cutting newspaper articles into sections, which he randomly rearranged. The book _Minutes to Go_ resulted from his initial cut-up experiment: unedited and unchanged cut-ups which emerged as coherent and meaningful prose. South African poet Sinclair Beiles also used this technique and co-authored _Minutes To Go_.

Gysin introduced Burroughs to the technique at the Beat Hotel. The pair later applied the technique to printed media and audio recordings in an effort to decode the material's implicit content, hypothesizing that such a technique could be used to discover the true meaning of a given text. Burroughs also suggested cut-ups may be effective as a form of divination saying, "When you cut into the present the future leaks out."[3] Burroughs also further developed the "fold-in" technique. In 1977, Burroughs and Gysin published _The Third Mind_, a collection of cut-up writings and essays on the form. Jeff Nuttall's publication _My Own Mag_ was another important outlet for the then-radical technique.

In an interview, Alan Burns noted that for _Europe After The Rain_ (1965) and subsequent novels he used a version of cut-ups: "I did not actually use scissors, but I folded pages, read across columns, and so on, discovering for myself many of the techniques Burroughs and Gysin describe".[4]

Argentine writer Julio Cortázar often used cut ups in his 1963 novel _Hopscotch_.


History in literature

In 1969, poets Howard W. Bergerson and J. A. Lindon developed a cut-up technique known as vocabularyclept poetry, in which a poem is formed by taking all the words of an existing poem and rearranging them, often preserving the metre and stanza lengths.[5] [6][7]

A precedent of the technique occurred during a Dadaist rally in the 1920s in which Tristan Tzara offered to create a poem on the spot by pulling words at random from a hat. Collage, which was popularized roughly contemporaneously with the Surrealist movement, sometimes incorporated texts such as newspapers or brochures. Prior to this event, the technique had been published in an issue of 391 in the poem by Tzara, _dada manifesto on feeble love and bitter love_ under the sub-title, _TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM_.[8][9]

A drama scripted for five voices by performance poet Hedwig Gorski in 1977 originated the idea of creating poetry only for performance instead of for print publication. The "neo-verse drama" titled _Booby, Mama!_ written for "guerilla theater" performances in public places used a combination of newspaper cut-ups that were edited and choreographed for a troupe of non-professional street actors.[10][11]

Kathy Acker, a literary and intermedia artist, sampled external sources and reconfigured them into the creation of shifting versions of her own constructed identity. In her late 1970s novel _Blood and Guts in High School_, Acker explored literary cut-up and appropriation as an integral part of her method.


History in film

Antony Balch and Burroughs created a collaboration film, _The Cut-Ups_[12] that opened in London in 1967. This was part of an abandoned project called _Guerrilla Conditions_ meant as a documentary on Burroughs and filmed throughout 1961–1965. Inspired by Burroughs' and Gysin's technique of cutting up text and rearranging it in random order, Balch had an editor cut his footage for the documentary into little pieces and impose no control over its reassembly.[13] The film opened at Oxford Street's Cinephone cinema and had a disturbing reaction. Many audience members claimed the film made them ill, others demanded their money back, while some just stumbled out of the cinema ranting "it's disgusting".[14] Other cut-up films include _Ghost at n°9 (Paris)_ (1963–72), a posthumously released short film compiled from reels found at Balch's office after his death, and _William Buys a Parrott_ (1982), _Bill and Tony_ (1972), _Towers Open Fire_ (1963) and _The Junky's Christmas_ (1966).[15]


Influence in music

From the early 1970s, David Bowie used cut-ups to create some of his lyrics. Thom Yorke applied a similar method in Radiohead's _Kid A_ (2000) album, writing single lines, putting them into a hat, and drawing them out at random while the band rehearsed the songs. Perhaps indicative of Thom Yorke's influences,[16] instructions for "How to make a Dada poem" appeared on Radiohead's website at this time.

Stephen Mallinder of Cabaret Voltaire reported to _Inpress_ magazine's Andrez Bergen that "I do think the manipulation of sound in our early days – the physical act of cutting up tapes, creating tape loops and all that – has a strong reference to Burroughs and Gysin."[17]
