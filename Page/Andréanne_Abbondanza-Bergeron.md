Works

Andréanne Abbondanza-Bergeron is a sculptor and installation artist. One interest of her work is to point out the disparities between inside and outside, public and private, as they point out to various forms of built and social structures of control, manipulation or power, dictating access or rejection into a specific structure or relationship. In her work, she wants to blend those boundaries and the potential exchange that happens in this new space. What captures her attention is the interrelation between structure and humans in space; each one possessing its own agency while also affecting the other. She approaches sculpture and installation, using it as an inquiry into those social and spatial relations.

Her work _Suspensus_ was presented as part of the exhibition IGNITION 12 [1] at the Leonard & Bina Ellen Art Gallery]

Abbondanza-Bergeron presented her MFA thesis exhibition, dis]JUNCTION [2] in 2016 at the Maison de la Culture Frontenac.

She is the recipient of the 2016 Yvonne L. Bombardier Graduate Scholarship in Visual Arts.[3]
