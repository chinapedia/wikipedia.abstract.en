BORJ RAHAL () is a village in the Tyre District in South Lebanon.


Name

According to E. H. Palmer in 1881, the name _Burj Rahhal_ means "the traveller’s tower".[1]


History

In the 1860s, Ernest Renan found here seven singular constructions in a row, three being open, the rest closed. He was also informed that to the north-east of these there are seven more hidden under ground. The locals call them the Tombs of the Tyrian Kings, _Kubur el Moluk_.[2]

In 1875, Victor Guérin found here a village with 400 Metawileh inhabitants.[3] "Here are seen good cut stones lying here and there, taken from an ancient fort."[4]

He further noted: "Ten minutes to the west of the village I observed three good subterranean magazines contiguous and parallel. Partly cut in the rock and partly constructed of cut stones, they measure ten metres in length by a breadth not greater than a metre and a half. They are covered within by a stony cement, in which are inserted fragments of pottery, and arc surmounted by great inclined slabs forming a triangular roof. These are covered over by a layer of earth, so as to form a platform. Several other similar caves are adjoining them, but they are at the present moment closed. Formerly they probably served as oil and wine- cellars, or stores for corn. The place is called _Kh. Mahatma._"[5]

In 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's _Survey of Western Palestine_ (SWP) described it as: "A large village built of stone, containing 150 Metawileh, on a ridge, surrounded by figs, olives, and arable land. There is a good spring and well near."[6] They further noted: "A few more minutes to the west, Guérin found a ruin called _Kh. Kerry el Meserta_, where he observed the uprights of grooved oil-presses, broken sarcophagi, mill stones, numerous little cubes of mosaic scattered about, and a great cistern extending under a platform. At twenty minutes' march west-south-west of _El Meserta_, he observed a hillock with the remains of a ruined village called _Kh. Halua_. Not far from this place, to the east-north-east, he found a platform surrounded by a wall of large stones, having a great cistern hollowed in the middle. It is called B_ir el Mellaha_."[7]
