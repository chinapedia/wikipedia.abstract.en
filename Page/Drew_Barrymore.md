Early life

Ancestry

Anne_Helm_John_Drew_Barrymore_1964.JPG and Drew's father, John Barrymore, in _Gunsmoke_, 1964|227x227px]] Barrymore was born in Culver City, California, to actor John Barrymore and aspiring actress Jaid (born Ildikó Jaid Makó).[7] Jaid was born in a displaced persons camp in Brannenburg, West Germany, to Hungarian World War II refugees.[8] Barrymore is one of four children and has a half-brother, John,[9] who is also an actor. Her parents divorced in 1984, when she was 9-years-old.[10]

Barrymore was born into an acting family. All of her paternal great-grandparents—Maurice and Georgie Drew Barrymore, Maurice and Mae Costello ( Altschuk)—as well as her paternal grandparents, John Barrymore and Dolores Costello, were actors,[11] with John being arguably the most acclaimed actor of his generation.[12][13] Barrymore is a niece of Diana Barrymore, a grandniece of Lionel Barrymore, Ethel Barrymore, and Helene Costello,[14] and a great-great-granddaughter of Irish-born John and English-born Louisa Lane Drew, all of whom were also actors. She was a great-grandniece of Broadway idol John Drew Jr. and silent film actor, writer, and director Sidney Drew.[15]

Barrymore's godmothers are actress Sophia Loren[16] and Lee Strasberg's widow, Anna Strasberg; Barrymore described her relationship with the latter as one that "would become so important to me as a kid because she was so kind and nurturing."[17] Her godfather is director Steven Spielberg.[18][19][20][21]

Barrymore's first name, Drew, was the maiden name of her paternal great-grandmother Georgie Drew, and her middle name, Blythe, was the surname of the family first used by her great-grandfather Maurice Barrymore.[22] In her 1991 autobiography _Little Girl Lost_, Barrymore recounted early memories of her abusive father, who left the family when Barrymore was 6-months-old. She and her father never had anything resembling a significant relationship and seldom spoke to each other.[23]

Childhood

Barrymore grew up on Poinsettia Place in West Hollywood until the age of 7, when she moved to Sherman Oaks. In her 2015 memoir, _Wildflower_, she says she talks "like a valley girl" because she grew up in Sherman Oaks. She moved back to West Hollywood upon becoming emancipated at 14.[24] Barrymore attended elementary school at Fountain Day School in West Hollywood and Country School.[25]

In the wake of her sudden stardom, Barrymore endured a notoriously troubled childhood. She was a regular at the racy Studio 54 as a young girl, and her nightlife and constant partying became a popular subject with the media. She was placed in rehab at the age of 13,[26][27] and spent 18 months in an institution for the mentally ill.[28] A suicide attempt at 14 put her back in rehab, followed by a three-month stay with singer David Crosby and his wife. The stay was precipitated, Crosby said, because she "needed to be around some people that were committed to sobriety." Barrymore later described this period of her life in her autobiography, _Little Girl Lost._ After a successful juvenile court petition for emancipation, she moved into her own apartment at the age of 15.[29][30]


Career

1980s

President_Reagan_with_Drew_Barrymore_at_a_ceremony_launching_the_Young_Astronauts_program_on_the_south_lawn._October_17,_1984.jpg, October 17, 1984]] Barrymore's professional career began at 11 months, when she auditioned for a dog food commercial. She was nipped by her canine co-star, to which she merely laughed and was hired for the job. After her film debut with a small role in _Altered States_ (1980),[31] she played Gertie in _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial_ (1982), directed by Steven Spielberg. He felt that she had the right imagination for her role after she impressed him with a story that she led a punk rock band.[32] _E.T._ is the highest-grossing film of the 1980s and made her one of the most famous child actors of the time. For her work, she won a Young Artist Award for Best Supporting Actress.[33][34]

In the 1984 horror film adaptation of Stephen King's 1980 novel _Firestarter,_ Barrymore played a girl with pyrokinesis who becomes the target of a secret government agency known as The Shop. The same year, she played a young girl divorcing her famous parents in _Irreconcilable Differences_, for which she was nominated for her first Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress.[35][36] In a review in the _Chicago Sun-Times_, Roger Ebert stated, "Barrymore is the right actress for this role precisely because she approaches it with such grave calm."[37]

Drew_Barrymore_Corey_Feldman_(cropped).jpg at the 61st Academy Awards, March 29, 1989]] Barrymore endured a troubled youth and continued to act intermittently during the decade. She starred in the 1985 anthology horror film _Cat's Eye,_ also written by Stephen King. The film received positive reviews and Barrymore was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Leading Young Actress.[38] She starred alongside Jeff Bridges and Alice Krige in the 1989 romantic comedy _See You in the Morning._ Vincent Canby of _The New York Times_ criticized the "fashionable phoniness" of the film, but positively singled out Barrymore for her performance.[39] After her twelve-day rehab treatment at ASAP,[40] Barrymore starred in _Far from Home_ (1989) as a teenager who gets stranded with her father in the small town in a remote part of the desert. The film went largely unnoticed by audiences and received negative reviews from critics, who dismissed the sexual portrayal of her role.[41]

1990s

In the early 1990s, Barrymore's rebelliousness played itself out on screen and in print. She forged an image as a manipulative teenage seductress, beginning with _Poison Ivy_ (1992), which was a box office failure, but was popular on video and cable.[42][43] Her character "Ivy" was ranked at #6 on the list of the top 26 "bad girls" of all time by _Entertainment Weekly_.[44] In 1992, Barrymore was 17 when she posed nude with her then-fiancé, actor Jamie Walters, for the cover of the July issue of _Interview_ magazine; she also appeared nude in pictures inside the issue.[45]

In the 1992 crime thriller _Guncrazy_, Barrymore starred as a teenager who kills her sexually abusive stepfather after he teaches her how to use a gun.[46] _Variety_ remarked that she "pulls off impressively" her character,[47] and Barrymore was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for her performance. In 1993, she took on the role of the younger sister of a murdered ballerina in _No Place to Hide_ and starred as a writer followed by what is apparently her evil twin in _Doppelganger_. Both thrillers were panned by critics and failed to find an audience.[48][49][50] She appeared in the Western comedy _Bad Girls_ (1994), which follows four former prostitutes on the run following a justifiable homicide and prison escape. Roger Ebert, in his review for the film, wrote for _Chicago Sun-Times_: "What a good idea, to make a Western about four tough women. And what a sad movie."[51]

When Barrymore was 19, she posed nude for the January 1995 issue of _Playboy_.[52][53] Director Steven Spielberg, who is also her godfather, gave her a quilt for her 20th birthday with a note that read, "Cover yourself up."[54] Enclosed were copies of her _Playboy_ pictures; the pictures had been altered by his art department so that she appeared fully clothed.[55] During her appearance on the _Late Show with David Letterman_ in 1995, Barrymore climbed onto David Letterman's desk, flashed her breasts to him and gave him a kiss on the cheek as a birthday present.[56] She modeled in a series of Guess? jeans ads during this time.[57]

Drew_Barrymore_1997.jpg In _Boys on the Side_ (1995), Barrymore played a pregnant girl who wants to escape from her abusive boyfriend.[58] The film went little-seen in theaters but was positively received by critics.[59] In the same year, she briefly appeared in Joel Schumacher's film _Batman Forever_, as Sugar, a moll to Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones).[60][61] In 1996, she made a brief but notable appearance in Wes Craven's slasher _Scream_. Barrymore read the film's script and was interested in being involved, approaching the production team herself to request a role. The producers were quick to take advantage of her unexpected interest, and signed her to play the lead role of Sidney Prescott, but when she was faced with unexpected commitments, she instead played the smaller role of Casey Becker and the lead role was given to Party of Five star Neve Campbell.[62] _Scream_ was released to critical acclaim and made $173 million worldwide.[63][64] By the mid- and late 1990s, Barrymore re-established her image and continued to be a highly bankable star.[65][66]

In _The Wedding Singer_ (1998), Barrymore played Julia Sullivan, the love interest of Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler).[67] _Variety_ found the film to be a "spirited, funny and warm saga" that serves them up "in a new way that enhances their most winning qualities".[68] Budgeted at $18 million, the film grossed $123.3 million internationally.[69] Barrymore starred in two other 1998 film releases, _Home Fries_ and _Ever After_.[70] _Home Fries_ saw her play a pregnant woman unknowingly falling for the stepson of the deceased father of her baby. In the romantic drama _Ever After_, inspired by the fairy tale Cinderella, she took on the leading role; the film, which made $98 million globally,[71] served as a reminder, according to Roger Ebert, of how well "she can hold the screen and involve us in her characters".[72]

Barrymore voiced the title role of an anthropomorphic Jack Russell terrier in the television Christmas special _Olive, the Other Reindeer_, for which she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy.[73] After Barrymore and Nancy Juvonen established Flower Films in 1995,[74] she produced the company's first film, _Never Been Kissed_ (1999), in which she also starred as an insecure copy editor for the _Chicago Sun-Times_ enrolling in high school as part of assigned research. While reviews from critics were mixed, _CNN_ noted: "There are two words which describe why this film works: Drew Barrymore. Her comedic timing and willingness to go all out in her quest for a laugh combine to make _Never Been Kissed_ a gratifying movie-going experience".[75] The film was a commercial success, grossing $84.5 million.[76]

2000s

DrewBarrymoreMusicLyrics.jpg In _Charlie's Angels_ (2000), Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu played the trio of investigators in Los Angeles. The film was a major box office success and helped solidify the standing between Barrymore and the company.[77][78] Barrymore starred in _Riding in Cars with Boys_ (2001), as a teenage mother in a failed marriage with the drug-addicted father (based on Beverly Donofrio's real-life story).[79] When the production of Richard Kelly's _Donnie Darko_ was threatened, Barrymore stepped forward with financing from the company, and played the title character's English teacher. Although the film was less than successful at the box office in the wake of 9/11, it reached cult status after the DVD release, inspiring numerous websites devoted to unraveling the plot twists and meanings.[80]

In 2002, Barrymore starred with Sam Rockwell and Julia Roberts in George Clooney's directorial debut _Confessions of a Dangerous Mind_, based on the autobiography of television producer Chuck Barris.[81] In 2003, she reprised her role as Dylan Sanders in _Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle_,[82][83] and starred with Ben Stiller in _Duplex_. Flower Films and Adam Sandler's Happy Madison Productions produced _50 First Dates_ (2004), in which Barrymore took on the role of woman with short-term memory loss and the love interest of a marine veterinarian (Sandler).[84][85] Summing up Barrymore's appeal, Roger Ebert, in his review for the film, remarked that Barrymore displayed a "smiling, coy sincerity," in what he described as a "ingratiating and lovable" film.[86] _50 First Dates_ was a commercial success; it made US$120.9 million in North America and US$196.4 million worldwide.[87]

In the American adaptation of the 1997 eponymous British remake _Fever Pitch_ (2005), Barrymore played the love interest of an immature school teacher (Jimmy Fallon). The film grossed a modest US$50 million worldwide and was favorably by reviewers who felt it "has enough charm and on-screen chemistry between [Fallon and Barrymore] to make it a solid hit".[88] She and Hugh Grant starred in _Music and Lyrics_, which focuses on the relationship that evolves between a former pop music idol and an aspiring writer as they struggle to compose a song for a reigning pop diva. The romantic comedy, released in February 2007, received largely positive reviews, with _The Washington Post_ finding the two to be "great together" in it.[89] The film was a commercial success, grossing US$145 million globally.[90][91]

Drew_Barrymore_headshot_by_David_Shankbone.jpg Barrymore starred in Curtis Hanson's little-seen poker-themed film _Lucky You_ later in 2007, as an aspiring singer and the subject of affections of a talented poker player,[92][93] and also reunited with _Never Been Kissed_ director Raja Gosnell for the commercial hit _Beverly Hills Chihuahua_ (2008), in which she voiced the titular character, a richly pampered pet who gets dognapped in Mexico and has to escape from an evil Doberman.

In 2009, Barrymore starred in the ensemble comedy _He's Just Not That Into You_, which garnered mixed reviews from critics, who observed her limited time on screen,[94][95][96] while it grossed US$178 million worldwide.[97] She played the lead role of Edith Bouvier Beale, the daughter of Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale (Jessica Lange), in the HBO film _Grey Gardens_, directed by Michael Sucsy and based on the 1975 documentary of the same name. The television film was a huge success, winning five Primetime Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards. _Rolling Stone_ writer Peter Travels found Barrymore to be a "revelation" in her role.[98] Barrymore received a nomination for the 2009 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie. She won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film and won the Screen Actors Guild for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries award.

Barrymore made her directorial debut with the sports dramedy _Whip It_ (2009); she also starred opposite Ellen Page and Marcia Gay Harden in the film, about a high-schooler (Page) who ditches the teen beauty pageant scene so she participate in an Austin roller derby league.[99] Barrymore worked with screenwriter Shauna Cross for months on script revisions, with Barrymore pushing her to "avoid her story's tidier prospects, to make things 'more raw and open ended.'"[100] While the film found limited box office receipts, it was favorably received;[101][102] according to review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, critics agreed that her "directorial debut has enough charm, energy, and good-natured humor to transcend its many cliches".[103][104] For her venture, Barrymore garnered nominations for a Bronze Horse at the Stockholm Film Festival and for the EDA Female Focus Award at the 2009 Alliance of Women Film Journalists. In _Everybody's Fine_, her last 2009 film release, Barrymore played the daughter of a recently widowed retiree (Robert De Niro).[105] The drama flopped at the box office,[106] but Stephen Holden for _The New York Times_ considered Barrymore "as ingenuous as ever" in what he described as a "small role".[107][108]

2010s

The film follows a couple dealing the ups and downs of a long-distance relationship, while commuting between New York City and San Francisco. It garnered generally mixed reviews by critics,[109] who summed it as "timelier and a little more honest than most romantic comedies",[110] and budgeted at US$32 million,[111] the film made US$40 million at the worldwide box office.[112]

On August 2, 2011, Barrymore directed the music video for the song "Our Deal," for the band Best Coast, which features Chloë Grace Moretz, Miranda Cosgrove, Tyler Posey, Donald Glover, Shailene Woodley and Alia Shawkat.[113] Barrymore starred with John Krasinski in the drama _Big Miracle_ (2012), which covers Operation Breakthrough, the 1988 international effort to rescue gray whales from being trapped in ice near Point Barrow, Alaska.[114] The film saw her play Rachel Krameron, based on Greenpeace activist Cindy Lowry.[115] Despite a positive critical reception, the film flopped at the box office.[116]

In _Blended_ (2014), Barrymore played Lauren Reynolds, a recently divorced woman ending up on a family resort with Jim Friedman (Sandler). Film critic James Berardinelli dismissed the "hit-and-miss humor" of the story and wrote that "as [Sandler and Barrymore] are concerned, the third time is definitely not the charm",[117] as part of an overall lukewarm critical response.[118] The film, however, ultimately grossed US$128 million worldwide.[119] She and Toni Collette starred in _Miss You Already_ (2015), as two long-time friends whose relationship is put to the test when one starts a family and the other becomes ill. Reviewers embraced the film, while it received a limited theatrical release.[120][121]

From 2017 to 2019, Barrymore starred in the Netflix television series _Santa Clarita Diet_, portraying a family wife who, after experiencing a physical transformation into a zombie, starts craving human flesh. Along with co-star Timothy Olyphant, Barrymore also served as an executive producer on the single-camera series,[122] which was favorably received upon its premiere;[123][124][125] _Rolling Stone_ felt that "much of [the series' laughs] comes down to the uncrushable Drew Barrymore charm" and furthermore remarked: "The show is a welcome comeback for Barrymore, the eternally beloved grunge-era wild thing—it's not just her big move into TV, but her first high-profile performance anywhere in years. In a way, it circles back to the roles she was doing in the early [90s], playing deadly vixens in flicks like _Guncrazy_ or _Doppelganger_".[126]

Barrymore is set to star in Jamie Babbit's romance film _The Stand-In_.[127]
