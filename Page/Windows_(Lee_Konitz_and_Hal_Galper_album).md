_WINDOWS_ is an album by American jazz saxophonist Lee Konitz and pianist Hal Galper recorded in late 1975 and released on the Danish SteepleChase label.[1][2][3]


Critical reception

Ken Dryden on Allmusic said "Pairing alto saxophonist Lee Konitz with pianist Hal Galper makes for plenty of inspired moments in this 1975 studio date ... both Konitz and Galper listen intensely to one another and react intuitively, as if they had been playing together for a long while".[4]
