HMS _NORTH STAR_ was a Royal Navy Admiralty M-class destroyer constructed and then operational in the First World War. She was sunk in April 1918.[1]

The destroyer was launched on 9 November 1916 and completed in February 1917.[2]


Sinking

The destroyer took part in the Zeebrugge raid in April 1918 and was assigned as an escort ship, along with HMS _Phoebe_ to guard HMS _Vindictive_.[3] She was subsequently sunk on 23 April 1918 by German shore batteries off Zeebrugge harbour, during the raid.[4] According to the official British Admiralty _Statement on the Zeebrugge Raid_, _North Star_ lost her way in the smoke of the raid and emerged into the light of star-shells, whereupon she was sunk by coastal batteries.[5]
