_ADVENTURE IN THE HOPFIELDS_ is a 1954 British children's film directed by John Guillermin starring Mandy Miller.[1] It was made for the Children's Film Foundation.[2]


Plot

After accidentally smashing her mother's prized china dog, little London girl Jenny (Mandy Miller) leaves her mother a note and sets off from home to make the money to buy a new one. Travelling by train, she follows her friend's family to Kent to earn money hop picking in the countryside. After the first day of hop picking, Sam Hines takes her with him to a junk shop where she sees a china dog just like her mother's. Mr. Hines lends her the money to buy it, but the dog is later stolen by two local children - the Reilly boys. Jenny chases after the kids into an old mill, but the thieves lock her in the loft. When lightning strikes the decaying mill and sets it on fire, Ned Reilly returns to rescue Jenny in the nick of time and goes back to the mill to get the china dog.

Critical reception

_TV Guide_ gave the film two out of four stars, noting "An above average children's film, with believable characters and story."[3] and the _Radio Times_ rated it two out of five stars, writing, "In days of yore, the poor folk of South London flocked to Kent and went hop-picking...this exciting tale offers bullying, theft and a climactic lightning storm. A little piece of British social history from the future director of _The Towering Inferno_."[4]
