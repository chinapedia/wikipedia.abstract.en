THOMAS BURGH (1696 – 20 September 1758) was an Anglo-Irish politician.

He was the son of William Burgh and Margaret Parnell. Burgh sat in the Irish House of Commons as the Member of Parliament for Lanesborough between 1727 and his death in 1758.[1]

Burgh married Anne Downes, daughter of Rt. Rev. Dive Downes, Bishop of Cork and Ross and his fourth wife Lady Catherine Fitzgerald, sister of the Earl of Kildare, in 1731. They had eight children, three sons and five daughters. One of their daughters, Margaretta Burgh, married John Foster, 1st Baron Oriel and was created Viscountess Ferrard in 1797. One of his sons, also called Thomas, was the father of Ulysses Burgh, 2nd Baron Downes, who inherited the title by special remainder from his cousin William Downes, 1st Baron Downes, a nephew of Anna Downes.
