"AMICO È" is a 1983 song composed by Dario Baldan Bembo (music), Nini Giacomelli and Sergio Bardotti (lyrics), and performed by Baldan Bembo and Caterina Caselli.[1]

A hymn to friendship, "Amico è" was the ending theme song of the Mike Bongiorno's quiz show _SuperFlash_. The song was also linked to a contest organized by the magazine _TV Sorrisi e Canzoni_, in which the readers should have identified four popular singers hidden among the choirs; in the last episode of the television show it was revealed they were Pupo, Ornella Vanoni, Giuni Russo and Gigliola Cinquetti.[2]

Outside its immediate success, later the song became a widely spread football chant.[3]

In the 1982 album _Spirito della Terra_, Baldan Bembo included a different version of the song titled "Falò" and featuring Riccardo Fogli and Marcella Bella. The song was also covered by numerous artists, including Kikki Danielsson and Kjell Roos in a Swedish version titled "Vem går med dig hem" and Celine Dion in a French version titled "Hymne à l'amitié".[4]
