A HORROR FILM is a film that seeks to elicit fear for entertainment purposes.[1] Initially inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley,[2] horror has existed as a film genre for more than a century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction, and thriller genres.

Horror films often aim to evoke viewers' nightmares, fears, revulsions and terror of the unknown. Plots within the horror genre often involve the intrusion of an evil force, event, or personage into the everyday world. Prevalent elements include ghosts, extraterrestrials, vampires, werewolves, demons, Satanism, evil clowns, gore, torture, vicious animals, evil witches, monsters, zombies, cannibalism, psychopaths, natural, ecological or man-made disasters, and serial killers.[3]

Some sub-genres of horror film include low-budget horror, action horror, comedy horror, body horror,[4] disaster horror, found footage,[5] holiday horror, horror drama, psychological horror,[6] science fiction horror, slasher, supernatural horror, gothic horror, natural horror, zombie horror, first-person horror, and teen horror.


History

1890s–1900s

The first depiction of the supernatural on screen appear in several of the short silent films created by the French pioneer filmmaker Georges Méliès in the late 1890s. The best known of these early supernatural-based works is the 3-minute short film _Le Manoir du Diable_ (1896), known in English as both _The Haunted Castle_ or _The House of the Devil_. The film is sometimes credited as being the first ever horror film.[7] In _The Haunted Castle_, a mischievous devil appears inside a medieval castle where he harasses the visitors. Méliès' other popular horror film is _La Caverne maudite_ (1898), which literally translates to "the accursed cave". The film, also known for its English title _The Cave of the Demons_, tells the story of a woman stumbling over a cave that is populated by the spirits and skeletons of people who died there.[8] Méliès would also make other short films that historians consider now as horror-comedies. _Une nuit terrible_ (1896), which translates to _A Terrible Night_, tells a story of a man who tries to get a good night's sleep but ends up wrestling a giant spider. His other film, _L'auberge ensorcelée_ (1897), or _The Bewitched Inn_, features a story of a hotel guest being pranked and tormented by an unseen presence.[9] Méliès,_Le_château_hanté_(Star_Film_96,_1897).jpg 1897 short film _Le Manoir du diable_, or _The Haunted Castle_]]

In 1897, the American photographer-turned director George Albert Smith created _The X-Ray Fiend_ (1897), a horror-comedy trick film that came out a mere two years after x-rays were invented. The film shows a couple of skeletons courting each other. An audience full of people unaccustomed to seeing moving skeletons on screen would have found it frightening and otherworldly.[10] The next year, Smith created the short film _Photographing a Ghost_ (1898), considered a precursor to the paranormal investigation subgenre. The film portrays three men attempting to photograph a ghost, only to fail time and again as the ghost eludes the men and throws chairs at them.

Le_Spectre_rouge_(1907)_de_Chomón.jpg'', or _Satan at Play_ (1907)]] Japan also made early forays into the horror genre. In 1898, a Japanese film company called Konishi Honten released two horror films both written by Ejiro Hatta. These were _Shinin No Sosei_ (Resurrection of a Corpse), and _Bake Jizo_ (Jizo the Spook)[11] The film _Shinin No Sosei_ told the story of a dead man who comes back to life after having fallen from a coffin that two men were carrying. The writer Hatta played the dead man, while the coffin-bearers were played by Konishi Honten employees. Though there are no records of the cast, crew, or plot of _Bake Jizo_, it was likely based on the Japanese legend of Jizo statues, believed to provide safety and protection to children. The presence of the word bake—which can be translated to "spook," "ghost," or "phantom"—may imply a haunted or possessed statue.[12] (In Japan, Jizō, is a deity who is seen as the guardian of children, and in particular, children who died before their parents. Jizō has been worshiped as the guardian of the souls of _mizuko_, the souls of stillborn, miscarried, or aborted fetuses.) La_casa_hechizada_(1906)_de_Chomón.jpg produced a handful of impressive trick films, including this one; _La casa hechizada_, or _The House of Ghosts_ made in 1908.]]

Spanish filmmaker Segundo de Chomón is also one of the most significant silent film directors in early filmmaking. [13] He was popular for his frequent camera tricks and optical illusions, an innovation that contributed heavily to the popularity of trick films in the period. His famous works include _Satán se divierte_ (1907), which translates to _Satan Having Fun_, or _Satan at Play_; _La casa hechizada_ (1908), or _The House of Ghosts_, considered to be one of the earliest cinematic depictions of a haunted house premise; and _Le spectre rouge_ (1907) or _The Red Spectre_, a collaboration film with French director Ferdinand Zecca about a demonic magician who attempts to perform his act in a mysterious grotto.

The Selig Polyscope Company in the United States produced one of the first film adaptations of a horror-based novel. In 1908, the company produced the film _Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_, directed by Otis Turner and starring Hobart Bosworth in the lead role. The film is, however, now considered a lost film. The story was based on Robert Louis Stevenson's classic gothic novella _Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde_, published 15 years prior, about a man who transforms his personality between two contrasting personas. (The book tells the classic story of a man with an unpredictably dual nature: usually very good, but sometimes shockingly evil as well.)

Georges Méliès also liked adapting the Faust legend into his films. In fact, the French filmmaker produced at least six variations of the German legend of the man who made a pact with the devil. Among his notable Faust films include _Faust aux enfers_ (1903), known primarily for its English title _The Damnation of Faust_, or _Faust in Hell_. It is the filmmaker's third film adaptation of the Faust legend. In it, Méliès took inspiration from Hector Berlioz's Faust opera, but it pays less attention to the story and more to the special effects that represent a tour of hell. The film takes advantage of stage machinery techniques and features special effects such as pyrotechnics, substitution splices, superimpositions on black backgrounds, and dissolves.[14] Méliès then made a sequel to that film called _Damnation du docteur Faust_ (1904), released in the U.S. as _Faust and Marguerite_. This time, the film was based on the opera by Charles Gounod. Méliès' other devil-inspired films in this period include _Les quat'cents farces du diable_ (1906), known in English as _The Merry Frolics of Satan_ or _The 400 Tricks of the Devil_, a tale about an engineer who barters with the Devil for superhuman powers and is forced to face the consequences. Méliès would also make other horror-based short films that aren't inspired by Faust, most notably the fantastical and unsettling _Le papillon fantastique_ (1909), where a magician turns a butterfly woman into a spider beast.

Trick Films

The_Haunted_Curiosity_Shop_(1901).ogv As the 19th century gave way to the 20th, artists and engineers were all pushing the boundaries of film. Artists like Méliès, first achieved fame as a magician. During the time, stage magicians entertained large crowds with illusions and magic tricks, and decked out their sets with elaborate sets, costumes, and characters. While filmmakers like the Lumière brothers were tinkering with motion picture devices and shot documentary-like films, Méliès, and to an extent, Segundo de Chomón as well, were developing magic tricks on film. They created sophisticated sight gags and theatrical special effects to either entertain or scare the audience.[15]

In his autobiography, Méliès recalled a day when he was capturing footage on a Paris street when his camera jammed. Frustrated, he fiddled with the hand crank, fixed the problem, and started shooting again. When he developed the film later, and played it back, he discovered a new trick. The shot started with people walking, children skipping, and a horse-drawn omnibus workers trundling up the street. Then, in the blink of an eye, everything changed. Men turned into women, children were replaced by horses, and – spookiest of all – the omnibus full of workers changed into a hearse. Because of this, Méliès had found a way to perform actual magic with editing, to fool an audience and pull off illusions he’d never been able to do on stage. This was the birth of trick films.[16]

Most of the early films in cinema history consist of continuous shots of short skits and or scenes from everyday life [i.e., _The Kiss_ (1898) or _Train Pulling into a Station_ (1896).] Filmmakers doing trick films attempted to do the impossible on screen; like levitating heads, making people disappear or turning them into skeletons. Trick films were silent films designed to feature innovative special effects. This style of filmmaking was developed by innovators such as Georges Méliès and Segundo de Chomón in their first cinematic experiments. In the first years of film, especially between 1898 and 1908, the trick film was one of the world's most popular film genres. Techniques explored in these trick films included slow motion and fast motion created by varying the camera cranking speed; the editing device called the substitution splice; and various in-camera effects, such as multiple exposure.^([4]) Double exposures, especially, achieved to show faded or ghostly images on screen.

The spectacular nature of trick films lives on especially on horror films. Trick films convey energetic whimsy that make impossible events seem to occur on screen. Trick films are in essence films in which artists use camera techniques to create magic tricks or special effects that feel otherworldly. Other examples of trick films include 1901's _The Big Swallow_ in which a man tries to swallow the audience, and 1901's _The Haunted Curiosity Shop_ in which apparitions appear inside an antiques shop.[17]

1910s

Charles_Ogle_In_Frankenstein_1910.jpg produced the first motion picture adaptation of Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_.]] In 1910, Edison Studios in the United States produced the first filmed version of Mary Shelley's 1818 classic Gothic novel _Frankenstein_, the popular story of a scientist creating a hideous, sapient creature through a scientific experiment. Adapted to the screen for the first time by director J. Searle Dawley, his movie _Frankenstein_ (1910) was deliberately designed to de-emphasize the horrific aspects of the story and focus on the story's mystical and psychological elements.[18] Yet, the macabre nature of its source material made the film synonymous with the horror film genre.[19]

The United States continued producing films based on the 1886 Gothic novella the _Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde_, a classic tale about a doctor or scientist whose evil persona emerges after getting in contact with a magical formula. New York City's Thanhouser Film Corporation's one-reel _Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_ (1912) was directed by Lucius Henderson and stars future director James Cruze in the title role. A year later, _Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_ (1913) came out. This time it was independently produced by IMP (the future Universal Studios) and stars King Baggot as the doctor.[20]

Inferno-_1911,_pluto.jpg'' (1911), based on _Inferno_, the first canticle of Dante Alighieri's _Divine Comedy_.]]

In March 1911, the hour-long Italian silent film epic _L'Inferno_ was screened in the Teatro Mercadante in Naples.[21] The film was adapted from the first part of Dante Alighieri's _Divine Comedy_ and took visual inspiration from Gustave Doré's haunting illustrations. It remains the best adaptation of _The Inferno_ and is regarded by many scholars as the finest film adaptation of any of Dante's works to date. The film became an international success and is arguably the first true blockbuster in all of cinema. _L'Inferno_ was directed by three artists; Francesco Bertolini, Adolfo Padovan, and Giuseppe de Liguoro. Their film is well-remembered for its stunning visualization of the nine circles of Hell and special effects that convey haunting visuals. The film presents a massive Lucifer with wings that stretch out behind him in front of a black void. He is seen devouring the Roman figures Brutus and Gaius in a display of double exposure and scale manipulation. According to critics, _L'Inferno_ is able to capture some of the manic, tortuous, and bizarre imagery and themes of Dante's complex masterwork.[22]

In the 1910s Georges Méliès would continue producing his Faustian films, the most significant of this period was 1912's _Le Chevalier des Neiges_ (_The Knight of the Snows_). It was Méliès' last film with Faustian themes [23] and the last of many films in which the filmmaker appeared as the Devil.[24] The film tells a story of a princess kidnapped by Satan and thrown into a dungeon. Her lover, the brave Knight of the Snows, must then go on a journey to rescue her. Special effects in the film were created with stage machinery, pyrotechnics, substitution splices, superimpositions, and dissolves.[25] It is among a few of the best examples of trick films that Georges Méliès and Segundo de Chomón helped popularized.

In 1912, French director Abel Gance released his short film _Le masque d'horreur_ (_The Mask of Horror_). The film tells a story of a mad sculptor who searches for the perfect realization of "the mask of horror". He places himself in front of a mirror after smearing blood over himself with the glass of an oil lamp. He then swallows a virulent poison to observe the effects of pain.[26]

In 1913, German directors Stellan Rye and Paul Wegener made the silent horror film _Der Student von Prag_ (_The Student of Prague_) loosely based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe. The film tells a story of a student who inadvertently makes a Faustian bargain. In the film, a student asks a stranger to turn him into a rich man. The stranger visits the student later in his dorm room and conjures up pieces of gold and a contract for him to sign. In return, the stranger is granted to take anything he wants from the room. He chooses to take the student's mirror. Upon moving it from the wall, a doppelgänger steps out and causes trouble. (In Western culture, a doppelgänger is a supernatural or ghostly double or look-alike of a specific person. It is usually seen as a harbinger of bad luck.) Cinematographer Guido Seeber utilized groundbreaking camera tricks to create the effect of the doppelgänger by using a mirror double which produces a seamless double exposure. The film was written by Hanns Heinz Ewers, a noted writer of horror and fantasy stories. His involvement with the screenplay lent a much needed air of respectability to the fledgling art form of horror film and German Expressionism[27]

On November 1915 until June 1916, French writer/director Louis Feuillade released a weekly serial entitled _Les Vampires_ where he exploited the power of horror imagery to great effect. Consisting of 10 parts or episodes and roughly 7 hours long if combined, _Les Vampires_ is considered to be one of the longest films ever made. The series tells a story of a criminal gang called the Vampires, who play upon their supernatural name and style to instill fear in the public and the police who desperately want to put a stop to them.[28] Marked as Feuillade's legendary opus, _Les Vampires_ is considered a precursor to movie thrillers. The series is also a close cousin to the surrealist movement.[29]

Der_Golem_1915.jpeg (as the Golem) and Lyda Salmonova (as Jessica), in the 1915 German, partially lost horror film _Der Golem_.]] Paul Wegener followed up the success of _The Student of Prague_ by adapting a story inspired by the ancient Jewish legend of the golem, an anthropomorphic being magically created entirely from clay or mud. Wegener teamed up with Henrik Galeen to create _Der Golem_ (1915). The film, which is still partially lost, tells a story of an antiques dealer who finds a golem, a clay statue, brought to life centuries before. The dealer resurrects the golem as a servant, but the golem falls in love with the antiques dealer's wife. As she does not return his love, the golem commits a series of murders. Wegener made a sequel to the film two years later.This time he teamed up with co-director Rochus Gliese and made _Der Golem und die Tänzerin_ (1917), or _The Golem and the Dancing Girl_ as it is known in English. It is now considered a lost film. Wegener would make a third golem film another three years later to conclude his _Der Golem_ trilogy.

In 1919, Austrian director Richard Oswald released a German silent anthology horror film called _Unheimliche Geschichten_, also known as _Eerie Tales_ or _Uncanny Tales_. In the film, a bookshop closes and the portraits of the Strumpet, Death, and the Devil come to life and amuse themselves by reading stories—about themselves, of course, in various guises and eras. The film is split into five stories: _The Apparition_, _The Hand_, _The Black Cat_ (based on the Edgar Allan Poe short story), _The Suicide Club_ (based on the Robert Louis Stevenson short story collection) and _Der Spuk_ (which translates to _The Spectre_ in English). The film is described as the "critical link between the more conventional German mystery and detective films of the mid 1910s and the groundbreaking fantastic cinema of the early 1920s."[30]

1920s

German Expressionism

The_Cabinet_of_Dr_Caligari_Conrad_Veidt.png is revealed.]] Robert Wiene's 1920 _Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari_ (_The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_) became a worldwide success and had a lasting impact on the film world, particularly for horror. It was not so much the story but the style that made it distinguishable from other films, "_Dr. Caligari_'s settings, some simply painted on canvas backdrops, are weirdly distorted, with caricatures of narrow streets, misshapen walls, odd rhomboid windows, and leaning doorframes. Effects of light and shadow were rendered by painting black lines and patterns directly on the floors and walls of sets."[31] Critic Roger Ebert called it arguably "the first true horror film", and film reviewer Danny Peary called it cinema's first cult film and a precursor to arthouse films. Considered a classic, _The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_ helped draw worldwide attention to the artistic merit of German cinema and had a major influence on American films, particularly in the genres of horror and film noir, introducing techniques such as the twist ending and the unreliable narrator to the language of narrative film. Writing for the book _1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die_, horror film critic Kim Newman called _The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_ "a major early entry in the horror genre, introducing images, themes, characters, and expressions that became fundamental to the likes of Tod Browning's _Dracula_ and James Whales' _Frankenstein_, both from 1931".[32] _The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_ is also a leading example of what a German Expressionist film looks like.

In October 1920, Paul Wegener teamed up with co-director Carl Boese to make the final Golem film entitled _Der Golem, wie er in die Welt kam_, known in English as _The Golem: How He Came into the World_. The final film in the DER GOLEM TRILOGY, _The Golem: How He Came into the World_ (1920) is a prequel to _Der Golem_ from 1915. In this film, Wegener stars as the golem who frightens a young lady with whom he is infatuated. The film is the best known of the series, as it is the only film that is completely preserved. It is also a leading example of early German Expressionism.

F. W. Murnau arguably made The first vampire-themed movie, _Nosferatu_ (1922). It was an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker's gothic horror novel _Dracula_. In _Nosferatu_, Murnau created some of cinema's most lasting and haunting imagery which famously involve shadows of the creeping Count Orlok. This helped popularized the expressionism style in filmmaking. Many expressionist works of this era emphasize a distorted reality, stimulating the human psyche and have influenced the horror film genre. Untitled_(Cesare_-Conrad_Veidt-_Carrying_Jane_-Lil_Dagover-_across_Rooftops)_LACMA_M.82.287.1e.jpg'']]

For most of the 1920s, German filmmakers like Wegener, Murnau, and Wiene would significantly influence later productions not only in horror films but in filmmaking in general. They would become the leading innovators of the GERMAN EXPRESSIONIST movement. The plots and stories of the German Expressionist films often dealt with madness and insanity. Arthur Robison's film, _Schatten – Eine nächtliche Halluzination_ (1923), literally _Shadows – a Nocturnal Hallucination_, also known as _Warning Shadows_ in English, is also one of the leading German Expressionist films. It tells the story of house guests inside a manor given visions of what might happen if the manor's host, the count played by Fritz Kortner, stays jealous and the guests do not reduce their advances towards his beautiful wife. Kortner's bulging eyes and twisted features are facets of a classic Expressionist performance style, as his unnatural feelings contort his face and body into something that appears other than human.[33]

In 1924, German filmmaker Paul Leni made another representative German Expressionist film with _Das Wachsfigurenkabinett_, or _Waxworks_ as it is commonly known. The horror film tells a story of a writer who accepts a job from a wax museum to write a series of stories on different controversial figures including Ivan the Terrible and Jack the Ripper in order to boost business. Although _Waxworks_ is often credited as a horror film, it is an anthology film that goes through several genres including a fantasy adventure, historical film, and horror film through its various episodes. _Waxworks_ contain many elements present in a German Expressionist movie. The film features deep shadows, moving shapes, and warped staircases. The director said of the film, "I have tried to create sets so stylized that they evidence no idea of reality." _Waxworks_ was director Paul Leni’s last film in Germany before heading to Hollywood to make some of the most important horror films of the late silent era.[34]

According to _Wisecrack_'s episode on _How Horror Movies Changed_, "the horror genre blossoms anywhere there was pain and national chaos. So it's more than fitting that the genre's real boom took place in the mega-depressing Post-World War I Germany. During the war (1914–1918), Germany banned all foreign films, inadvertently throwing all film nerds a boom. Combine that embargo with the general despair of the era, you'll see why German Expressionism took place."[35] German Expressionism was a film genre that was "all about coping with economic and social fallout via dream-like horror films, filled with subjective shots, funky angles, high-contrast spooky lighting, and frequently, sympathetic monsters."

Universal Classic Monsters 1920s

PhantomOp.jpg and Mary Philbin in the 1925 film _The Phantom of the Opera_.]] Though the word _horror_ to describe the film genre would not be used until the 1930s (when Universal Pictures began releasing their initial monster films), earlier American productions often relied on horror and gothic themes. Many of these early films were considered dark melodramas because of their stock characters and emotion-heavy plots that focused on romance, violence, suspense, and sentimentality.[36]

In 1923, Universal Pictures started producing films with horror and mostly gothic elements. This would retroactively become the first phase of the studio's Universal Classic Monsters series that would continue for three more decades. Universal Pictures' classic monsters of the 1920's featured hideously deformed characters like Quasimodo, The Phantom, and Gwynplaine.

The first film of the series was _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_ (1923) starring Lon Chaney as the hunchback Quasimodo. The film was adapted from the classic French gothic novel of the same name written by Victor Hugo in 1833, about a horribly deformed bell ringer in the cathedral of Notre-Dame. The film elevated Chaney, already a well-known character actor, to full star status in Hollywood, and also helped set a standard for many later horror films.

Two years later, Chaney stars as The Phantom who haunts the Paris Opera House in 1925's silent horror film, _The Phantom of the Opera_, based on the mystery novel by Gaston Leroux published 15 years earlier. Roger Ebert said the film "creates beneath the opera one of the most grotesque places in the cinema, and Chaney's performance transforms an absurd character into a haunting one."[37] Adrian Warren of PopMatters called the film "terrific: unsettling, beautifully shot and imbued with a dense and shadowy Gothic atmosphere".[38] Included in the book _1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die_, 1925's _The Phantom of the Opera_ is lauded for Lon Chaney's masterful acting, Universal Pictures' incredible set design, and its many masterly moments including the unmasking of the tragic villain's disfigured skullface, so shocking that even the camera is terrified, going briefly out of focus.[39]

In 1927, German director Paul Leni directed his first of two films for Universal Pictures. His silent horror film _The Cat and the Canary_ is the third film in the Universal Classic Monsters series and is considered "the cornerstone of Universal's school of horror."[40] _The Cat and the Canary_ is adapted from John Willard's black comedy play of the same name. The plot revolves around the death of a man and the reading of his will 20 years later. His family inherits his fortunes, but when they spend the night in his haunted mansion they are stalked by a mysterious figure. Meanwhile, a lunatic known as "the Cat" escapes from an asylum and hides in the mansion. The film is part of a genre of COMEDY HORROR films inspired by 1920s Broadway stage plays. Paul Leni's adaptation of Willard's play blended expressionism with humor, a style Leni was notable for and critics recognized as unique. Alfred Hitchcock cited this film as one of his influences[41] and Tony Rayns called it the "definitive haunted house movie."[42]

The-Man-Who-Laughs-(1928)-Gwynplaine.png as Gwynplaine, an inspiration for the 1940 comic book nemesis of Batman, The Joker]] Paul Leni's second film for Universal Pictures was _The Man Who Laughs_ (1928), an adaptation of another Victor Hugo novel. The film, starring Conrad Veidt is known for the bleak carnival freak-like grin on the character Gwynplaine's face. His exaggerated smile was the inspiration for DC Comics' The Joker. (A graphic novel in 2005 exploring the origins of the Joker was also titled _Batman: The Man Who Laughs_ in homage to this film).[43] Film critic Roger Ebert stated, "The Man Who Laughs is a melodrama, at times even a swashbuckler, but so steeped in Expressionist gloom that it plays like a horror film".[44]

The fifth and last film of the Universal Classic Monsters series in the 1920s is _The Last Performance_ (1929). It was directed by Paul Fejos and stars Conrad Veidt and Mary Philbin.Veidt plays a middle-aged magician who is in love with his beautiful young assistant. She, on the other hand, is in love with the magician’s young protege, who turns out to be a bum and a thief. The film received mixed reviews and a 1929 New York Times article even said that _"Dr. Fejos has handled his scenes with no small degree of imagination."_[45]

A Letterboxd reviewer called it a "backstage melodrama with eerie intimations of horror.[46]

Other productions

The trend of inserting an element of macabre into American pre-horror melodramas was popular in the 1920s. Directors known for relying on macabre in their films during the decade were Maurice Tourneur, Rex Ingram, and Tod Browning. Ingram's _The Magician_ (1926) contains one of the first examples of a "mad doctor" and is said to have had a large influence on James Whale's version of _Frankenstein_.[47] _The Unholy Three_ (1925) is an example of Tod Browning's use of macabre and unique style of morbidity; he remade the film in 1930 as a talkie. In 1927, Tod Browning cast Lon Chaney in his horror film _The Unknown_. Chaney played a carnival knife thrower called Alonzo the Armless and Joan Crawford as the scantily clad carnival girl he hopes to marry. Chaney did collaborative scenes with a real-life armless double whose legs and feet were used to manipulate objects such as knives and cigarettes in frame with Chaney's upper body and face.[48]

1928's _The Terror_ by Warner Bros. Pictures was the first all-talking horror film, made using the Vitaphone sound-on-disc system.[49] The film tells a simple story of guests at an old English manor being stalked by a mysterious killer known only as “The Terror”. The plot centered on sound, with much of the ghost's haunting taking place in vis-a-vis creepy organ music, creaky doors and howling winds. The film was poorly received by audiences and critics. John MacCormac, reporting from London for The New York Times upon the film's UK premiere, wrote; ''"The universal opinion of London critics is that _The Terror_ is so bad that it is almost suicidal. They claim that it is monotonous, slow, dragging, fatiguing and boring."''[50]

Haxan_sv_poster.jpg''.]] Other European countries also, contributed to the genre during this period. In Sweden, Victor Sjöström created _Körkarlen_ (_The Phantom Carriage)_ in 1921. This is what the Criterion have to say about the film; "The last person to die on New Year’s Eve before the clock strikes twelve is doomed to take the reins of Death’s chariot and work tirelessly collecting fresh souls for the next year. So says the legend that drives _The Phantom Carriage_ _(Körkarlen)_, directed by the father of Swedish cinema, Victor Sjöström. The story, based on a novel by Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlöf, concerns an alcoholic, abusive ne’er-do-well (Sjöström himself) who is shown the error of his ways, and the pure-of-heart Salvation Army sister who believes in his redemption. This extraordinarily rich and innovative silent classic (which inspired Ingmar Bergman to make movies) is a Dickensian ghost story and a deeply moving morality tale, as well as a showcase for groundbreaking special effects.[51]

In 1922, Danish filmmaker Benjamin Christensen created the Swedish-Danish production _Häxan_ (also known as _The Witches_ or _Witchcraft Through the Ages_), a documentary-style silent horror film based partly on Christensen's study of the Malleus Maleficarum, a 15th-century German guide for inquisitors. _Häxan_ is a study of how superstition and the misunderstanding of diseases and mental illness could lead to the hysteria of the witch-hunts.[2] The film was made as a documentary but contains dramatized sequences that are comparable to horror films.[52] To visualize his subject matter, Christensen fills the frame with every frightening image he can conjure out of the historical records, often freely blending fact and fantasy. There are shocking moments in which we witness a woman giving birth to two enormous demons, see a witches' sabbath, and endure tortures by inquisition judges. The film also features an endless parade of demons of all shapes and sizes, some of whom look more ore less human, whereas others, are almost fully animal-- pigs, twisted birds, cats, and the like..[53]

French filmmaker Jean Epstein produced an influential film, _La Chute de la maison Usher_ (_The Fall of the House of Usher_) in 1928. It is one of multiple films based on the Edgar Allan Poe Gothic short story _The Fall of the House of Usher_. Future director Luis Buñuel co-wrote the screenplay with Epstein, his second film credit, having previously worked as assistant director on Epstein's film Mauprat from 1926. Roger Ebert included the film on his list of "Great Movies" in 2002, calling the great hall of the film as "one of the most haunting spaces in the movies".[54]

_Il mostro di Frankenstein_ (1921), one of a few Italian horror film before the late 1950s, is now considered lost.[55]

1930s

Universal Classic Monsters 1930s

In the 1930s Universal Pictures continued producing films based on Gothic horror. In this decade, the studio assembled several iconic monsters in motion picture history including Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Invisible Man, and The Wolf Man.[56] Each movie starring these monsters would go on to make sequels and each of them would go on to cross-over with one another in a cinematic shared universe. The films would retroactively be classified together as part of the Universal Classic Monsters series.[57]

Universal Pictures created a monopoly on the mainstream horror film, producing stars such as Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff, and grossing large sums of money at the box office in the process. Not only did Universal bring the subgenre of “creature features” into the limelight, they also gave them their golden years, now reflected back on as “The Monsters Golden Era.”[58] In the 1920’s, the studio only put out five features, in the 1930’s however, they produced about 21.

In the year 1930, Universal Pictures released the mystery film _The Cat Creeps_. It was a sound remake of the studio’s earlier film, _The Cat and the Canary_ from three years ago. Simultaneously, Universal also released a Spanish-speaking version of the film called _La Voluntad del Muerto_ _(The Will of the Dead Man)_. The film was directed by George Melford who would later direct the Spanish version of _Dracula_. Both _The Cat Creeps_ and _La Voluntad del Muerto_ are considered lost films.

Dracula_trailer_(1931).webm On February 14, 1931, Universal Pictures premiered their first film adaptation of _Dracula_, the popular story of an ancient vampire who arrives in England where he preys upon a virtuous young girl. The film was based on the 1924 stage play by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston, which in turn was loosely based on the classic 1897 novel by Bram Stoker. February 1931’s _Dracula_ was an English-language vampire-horror film directed by Tod Browning and stars Bela Lugosi as the Count Dracula, the actor's most iconic role. The film was generally well received by critics. _Variety_ praised the film for its "remarkably effective background of creepy atmosphere."[59] _Film Daily_ declared it "a fine melodrama" and also lauded Lugosi's performance, calling it "splendid" and remarking that he had created "one of the most unique and powerful roles of the screen".[60] Kim Newman, writing for the book _1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die_, said that _Dracula_ signaled the "true beginning of the horror film as a distinct genre and the vampire movie as its most popular subgenre.[61]

Two months later on April 24, 1931, Universal Pictures premiered the Spanish-language version of _Dracula_ directed by George Melford. April 1931’s _Drácula_ was filmed at night on the same sets that were being used during the day for the English-language version. Of the cast, only Carlos Villarías (playing Count Dracula) was permitted to see rushes of the English-language film, and he was encouraged to imitate Bela Lugosi's performance. Some long shots of Lugosi as the Count and some alternative takes from the English version were used in this production.[62] In recent years, this version has become more highly praised than Tod Browning’s English-language version.[63] The Spanish crew had the advantage of watching the English dailies when they came in for the evening, and they would devise better camera angles and more effective use of lighting in an attempt to improve upon it.[64] In 2015, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".[65]

Frankenstein's_monster_(Boris_Karloff).jpg as Frankenstein's monster
in the 1935 _Bride of Frankenstein_.]] On November 21, 1931, Universal Pictures released another hit film with _Frankenstein_. The story is about a scientist and his assistant who dig up corpses in the hopes to reanimated them with electricity. The experiment goes awry when Dr. Frankenstein's assistant accidentally gives the creature a murderer’s abnormal brain. 1931’s _Frankenstein_ was based on a 1927 play by Peggy Webling which in turn was based off Mary Shelley’s classic 1818 Gothic novel. The film was directed by James Whale and stars Boris Karloff as Frankenstein’s monster in one of his most iconic roles. A hit with both audiences and critics, the film was followed by multiple sequels and along with the same year’s _Dracula_, has become one of the most famous horror films in history. “Universal’s makeup genius Jack Pierce created the main look of the monster, devising the flattop, the neck terminals, the heavy eyelids, and the elongated scarred hands, while director James Whale outfitted the creature with a shabby suit.”[66]

On February 21, 1932, Universal Pictures released a double-feature. The first one is _Murders in the Rue Morgue_. It stars Bela Lugosi as a lunatic scientist who abducts women and injects them with blood from his ill-tempered caged ape. The film was loosely based on an 1841 short story by Edgar Allan Poe. Universal Pictures would release two more Poe adaptations later in the decade. The second film in the double-feature is the James Whale-directed _The Old Dark House_. It’s a mystery horror story starring Boris Karloff. Five travelers are admitted to a large foreboding old house that belongs to an extremely strange family. The story was based on a 1927 novel by J.B. Priestly.

On December 1932, the studio released _The Mummy_ starring Boris Karloff as the Egyptian monster. The film, based on an original screenplay, is about an ancient Egyptian mummy named Imhotep who is discovered by a team of archaeologists and inadvertently brought back to life through a magic scroll. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 93% score, based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's consensus states: "Relying more on mood and atmosphere than the thrills typical of modern horror fare, Universal's The Mummy sets a masterful template for mummy-themed films to follow.[67] The Mummy character was so popular that it spawned sequels and remakes over the next decades.

The_Mummy,_Boris_Karloff_(1932).jpg Make-up artist Jack Pierce was responsible for the look of the Mummy. After studying photos of ancient mummies, Pierce came up with the look bearing a resemblance to the mummy of Ramesses III. Pierce began transforming Karloff at 11 a.m., applying cotton, collodion and spirit gum to his face; clay to his hair; and wrapping him in linen bandages treated with acid and burnt in an oven, finishing the job at 7 p.m. Karloff finished his scenes by 2 a.m., and another two hours were spent removing the make-up. Boris Karloff found the removal of gum from his face painful, and overall found the day "the most trying ordeal I [had] ever endured".[68] The image of Karloff wrapped in bandages has become one of the most iconic images in the series. Jack Pierce would also come to design the Satanic make-up for Lugosi in the independently produced _White Zombie_ (1932).

In 1933, after the release of _The Mummy_, Universal Pictures released two pictures. The first one was in July. It was a murder-mystery film called _The Secret of the Blue Room_. The plot of the film is that, according to legend, the "blue room" inside a mansion is cursed. Everyone who has ever spent the night there has met with an untimely end. Three men wager that each can survive a night in the forbidding room.[69] In November, the studio premiered another iconic character with Dr. Jack Griffin, aka the Invisible Man in the classic science fiction-horror _The Invisible Man_. The film was directed by James Whale and stars Claude Rains as the titular character. The movie was based on a science fiction novel of the same name by H. G. Wells published in 1897. The film has been described as a "nearly perfect translation of the spirit of the book".[70] It spawned a number of sequels, plus many spinoffs using the idea of an "invisible man" that were largely unrelated to Wells' original story.

Dr._Jack_Griffin.png from _The Invisible Man_.]] _The Invisible Man_ is known for its clever and groundbreaking visual effects by John P. Fulton, John J. Mescall and Frank D. Williams, whose work is often credited for the success of the film.[71] When the Invisible Man had no clothes on, the effect was achieved through the use of wires, but when he had some of his clothes on or was taking his clothes off, the effect was achieved by shooting Claude Rains in a completely black velvet suit against a black velvet background and then combining this shot with another shot of the location the scene took place in using a matte process. Claude Rains was claustrophobic and it was hard to breathe through the suit. Consequently, the work was especially difficult for him, and a double, who was somewhat shorter than Rains, was sometimes used.

In 1934, Universal Pictures released the successful psychological horror film _The Black Cat_. It stars both Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. It was the first of six movies Universal Pictures paired the two iconic actors together. _The Black Cat_ became Universal Pictures' biggest box office hit of the year and is considered by many to be the one that created and popularized the psychological horror subgenre, emphasizing on atmosphere, eerie sounds, the darker side of the human psyche, and emotions like fear and guilt to deliver its scares, something that was not used in the horror genre before. Although it was credited the film was based om Edgar Allan Poe's classic 1841 short story, the film actually has little to do with Poe's story. In the film, American honeymooners in Hungary become trapped in the home of a Satan-worshiping priest when the bride is taken there for medical help following a road accident. The film exploited a sudden public interest in psychiatry.[72] Peter Ruric (better known as pulp writer Paul Cain) wrote the screenplay.[73]

In 1935, Universal Pictures released four pictures from February to July. The first picture they released in 1935 was _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_, a mystery drama film starring Claude Rains. The story revolves around an opium-addicted choirmaster who develops an obsession for a beautiful young girl and will not stop short of murder in order to have her. The film was based on the final novel by Charles Dickens in 1870.

In April 1935, _Bride of Frankenstein_ premiered. The science-fiction/horror film was the first sequel to the 1931 hit _Frankenstein_. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest sequels in cinematic history, with many fans and critics considering it to be an improvement on the original film. As with the original, _Bride of Frankenstein_ was directed by James Whale and stars Boris Karloff as the Monster. In the film, Dr. Frankenstein, goaded by an even madder scientist, builds his monster a mate, often referred to as the Monster's Bride. Makeup artist Jack Pierce returned to create the makeup for the Monster and his Bride. Over the course of filming, Pierce modified the Monster's makeup to indicate that the Monster's injuries were healing as the film progressed.[74] Pierce co-created the Bride's makeup with strong input from Whale, especially regarding the Bride's iconic hair style, which was based on the Egyptian queen Nefertiti. Actress Elsa Lanchester portrayed the Monster's Bride. The bride's conical hairdo, with its white lightning-trace streaks on each side, has become an iconic symbol of both the character and the film.

A month after the release of _Bride of Frankenstein_, Universal Pictures premiered the influential werewolf movie _Werewolf of London_, the first Hollywood mainstream movie to feature a werewolf, a creature of folklore who shape-shifts from a human into a wolf. The film stars Henry Hull as the titular character. In the movie, he is a botanist who gets attacked by a strange animal. The bite causes him to turn into a bloodthirsty monster. Jack Pierce created the make-up for the creature. Screenwriter and journalist Frank Nugent, writing for the _The New York Times_, thought the film was "designed solely to amaze and horrify." He continued by writing, "_Werewolf of London_ goes about its task with commendable thoroughness, sparing no grisly detail and springing from scene to scene with even greater ease than that oft attributed to a daring young aerialist. Granting that the central idea has been used before, the picture still rates the attention of action-and-horror enthusiasts."[75] Six years later, Universal Pictures would release the second werewolf picture, _The Wolf Man_, which would garner greater deal of influence on Hollywood's depiction of the legend of the werewolf.[76]

In July 1935, Universal Pictures paired Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff together for a second time in the studio's third Edgar Allan Poe picture. The film was _The Raven_. The film was not actually a direct adaptation of the classic 1845 poem, but rather inspired from it. In the film, a brilliant surgeon, played by Bela Lugosi, is obsessed with the writer Edgar Allan Poe. He saves the life of a beautiful dancer but goes mad when he can't have her. Meanwhile, Boris Karloff plays a fugitive murderer on the run from the police. 1935's _The Raven_ contains themes of torture, disfigurement, and grisly revenge. The film did not do particularly well at the box office during its initial release, and indirectly led to a temporary ban on horror films in England. At the time, it was beginning to look like the horror genre was no longer economically viable, and paired with the strict production code of the era, American filmmakers struggled to make creative works on screen, and horror eventually went out of vogue. This proved a devastating development at the time for Lugosi, who found himself losing work and struggling to support his family. Universal Pictures changed ownership in 1936, and the new management was less interested in the macabre.

In 1936, Universal Pictures continued to make films for the series. In January, the studio premiered the science fiction melodrama _The Invisible Ray_. The film pairs Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff a third time. In the film, a scientist creates a telescope-like device that captures light waves from the Andromeda Galaxy, giving him a way to view the distant past. He and several colleagues go to Africa to locate a large, unusual meteorite that the light-waves showed fell there a billion years earlier. After discovering that the meteorite is composed of a poisonous unknown element, "Radium X", he begins to glow in the dark, and his touch becomes deadly. These radiation effects also begin to slowly drive him mad. Critics noted the tone of the film to be The tone of the film to be somber, dignified, and tragic. _The Invisible Ray_ is a morality play, particularly given the film's final lines of dialog, uttered nine years before the events of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, by Madame Rukh: "My son, you have broken the first law of science...Janos Rukh is dead, but part of him will go on to eternity, working for humanity".

In May of 1936, Universal Pictures released a sequel to 1931's _Dracula_. The film was called _Dracula's Daughter_ and stars Gloria Holden in the title role. _Dracula's Daughter_ doesn't feature Bela Lugosi or his character, but instead tells the story of Countess Marya Zaleska, the daughter of Count Dracula and herself a vampire. Following Dracula's death, she believes that by destroying his body she will be free of his influence and live normally. When this fails, she turns to a psychiatrist, played by Otto Kruger. He, in turn, has a fiance, Janet. The Countess kidnaps Janet and takes her to Transylvania, leading to a battle between Dr. Garth and the Countess. While not as successful as the original upon its release, the film was generally well-reviewed. In the intervening decades, criticism has been deeply divided. Contemporary critics and scholars have noted the film's strong lesbian overtones, which Universal acknowledged from the start of production and exploited in some early advertising. Universal would completed their initial _Dracula_ trilogy seven years later with _Son of Dracula_. GloriaHolden2DraculasDaughterTrailerScreenshot1936.jpg as the Countess in _Dracula's Daughter_]]

In 1937, Universal Pictures only released one film in the series. The film was _Night Key_, a science fiction crime thriller starring Boris Karloff. In _Night Key_, Karloff plays an elderly inventor of a burglar alarm who attempts to get back at the man who stole the profits to his invention. Later, his device is then subverted by gangsters who threatens him and use his own device to facilitate burglaries. Letterboxd users call the film "a delightfully corny, old-fashioned thriller". and praised the film for Karloff's performance. [77]

In 1938, Universal Pictures did not release any film related to horror, thriller, or science fiction. Instead, they made re-releases of their previous _Dracula_ and _Frankenstein_ films. It was only on January 1939, a full year and a half after the release of _Night Key_ that the studio continued putting out original horror movies. In January 7, 1939, Universal Pictures premiered their 12-part serial _The Phantom Creeps_. It stars Bela Lugosi as a mad scientist who attempts to rule the world by creating various elaborate inventions. In a dramatic fashion, foreign agents and G-Men (government men) try to seize the inventions for themselves. A 78-minute feature film version of the film, cut down from the serial's original 265 minutes, was released for television ten years later. _The Phantom Creeps_ was Universal Pictures' 112th serial and 44th to have sound. The innovation of the scrolling text version of the synopsis at the beginning of each chapter was used for the _Star Wars_ films as the "Star Wars opening crawl".

In January 13, 1939, Universal Pictures released _Son of Frankenstein_, the third entry in the studio's _Frankenstein_ series and the last to feature Boris Karloff as the Monster. It is also the first to feature Bela Lugosi as Ygor. The film is the sequel to James Whale's _Bride of Frankenstein_, and stars top-billed Basil Rathbone, Karloff, Lugosi and Lionel Atwill. _Son of Frankenstein_ was a reaction to the popular re-releases of _Dracula_ and _Frankenstein_ as double-features in 1938. In the film, one of the sons of Frankenstein finds his father's monster in a coma and revives him, only to find out he is controlled by Ygor who is bent on revenge. Universal's declining horror output was revitalized with the enormously successful _Son of Frankenstein_, in which the studio cast both stars (Lugosi and Karloff) again for the fourth time.

In November 1939, Universal Pictures released their last horror film of the 1930's with the historical and quasi-horror film, _Tower of London_. It stars Basil Rathbone as the future King Richard III of England, and Boris Karloff as his fictitious club-footed executioner Mord. Vincent Price, in only his third film, appears as George, Duke of Clarence. _Tower of London_ is based on the traditional depiction of Richard rising to become King of England in 1483 by eliminating everyone ahead of him. Each time Richard accomplishes a murder, he removes one figurine from a dollhouse resembling a throne room. Once he has completed his task, he now needs to defeat the exiled Henry Tudor to retain the throne.

Other productions

Other studios followed Universal's lead. MGM's controversial _Freaks_ (1932), which featured characters played by people who had real deformities, frightened audiences at the time. The studio even disowned the film, and it remained banned, in the United Kingdom, for 30 years.[78] Paramount Pictures' _Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_ (1931) is remembered for its innovative use of photographic filters to create Jekyll's transformation before the camera.[79] And RKO created the highly successful and influential monster movie, _King Kong_ (1933). With the progression of the genre, actors like Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi were beginning to build entire careers in horror.

Early in the decade also, Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer created the horror fantasy film _Vampyr_ (1932) based on elements from J. Sheridan Le Fanu's collection of supernatural stories _In a Glass Darkly_. The German-produced sound film tells the story of Allan Gray, a student of the occult who enters a village under the curse of a vampire. According to the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, _Vampyr_'s "greatness derives partly from Dreyer's handling of the vampire theme in terms of sexuality and eroticism, and partly from its highly distinctive, dreamy look."

1940s

In the 1940s, Val Lewton became a well known figure in early B-horror cinema for making low-budget movies for RKO Pictures, including _I Walked with a Zombie_ (1943), _The Body Snatcher_ (1945), and _Cat People_ (1942), a film deemed by the United States' National Film Registry as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

The decade also sees the continuation of Universal Pictures' consistent releases of horror, suspense and science fiction films. This comes to be later known as the cult classic Universal Classic Monsters series which began in the 1920s and would later dissipate in the 1950s. In this decade Lon Chaney Jr. became the studio's leading monster movie actor supplanting the previous decades' leading stars Karloff and Lugosi by a wide margin in terms of the number of leading roles that he played. Chaney is best known playing Larry Talbot in _The Wolf Man_ (1941) and its sequels and crossover films. He also played Frankenstein's monster in _The Ghost of Frankenstein_ (1942), taking over Boris Karloff in the main role. The _Mummy_ series was also continued with _The Mummy's Tomb_ (1942), _The Mummy's Ghost_ and _The Mummy's Curse_ (both 1944) all starring Chaney Jr. as the Mummy.

Paramount Pictures also made horror films in the 1940s, the most popular of which is _The Uninvited_. The film has been noted by contemporary film scholars as being the first film in history to portray ghosts as legitimate entities rather than illusions or misunderstandings played for comedy. It depicts various supernatural phenomena, including disembodied voices, apparitions, and possession. MGM's best horror genre contribution of the 1940s would be Albert Lewin's _The Picture of Dorian Gray_, which was popularly known for its interesting use of color insert to show Dorian's haunting portrait.

In 1945, Great Britain contributed the anthology horror film _Dead of Night_. In the film house guests tell at least five supernatural tales, the last of which being the most remembered. The film's last story, titled _The Ventriloquist's Dummy_ features a ventriloquist tormented by a malevolent puppet.

The popularity of movie genres of the 1940s were mostly film noir, melodrama and mystery. It would then arguably be a stretch to point out that some mystery and thriller films can be considered horror genre contributions of the decade. These movies include _The Spiral Staircase_ (1946) which tells the story of a serial killer targeting women with "afflictions", like the mute and blind; _The Seventh Victim_ (1943), a horror/film noir story of a woman stumbling upon a Satanic cult while looking for her missing sister; and John Brahm's _The Lodger_ (1944), where a landlady suspects her new lodger to be Jack the Ripper.

_The Queen of Spades_ (1949) is a fantasy/horror film about an elderly countess who strikes a bargain with the devil and exchanges her soul for the ability to always win at cards. Wes Anderson ranked it as the sixth best British film.[80] Martin Scorsese said that _The Queen of Spades_ is a "stunning film" and one of "the few true classics of supernatural cinema."[81] And Dennis Schwartz of Ozus' World Movie Reviews called it "A masterfully filmed surreal atmospheric supernatural tale".[82]

1950s

With advances in technology, the tone of horror films shifted from the Gothic towards contemporary concerns. A popular horror subgenre began to emerge: the Doomsday film.[83] Low-budget productions featured humanity overcoming threats such as alien invasions and deadly mutations to people, plants, and insects. Popular films of this genre include _Creature from the Black Lagoon_ (1954) and _The Blob_ (1958).

1956's science fiction/horror film _Invasion of the Body Snatchers_ concerns an extraterrestrial invasion where aliens are capable of reproducing a duplicate replacement copy of each human. It is considered to be the most popular and most paranoid films from the golden age of American sci-fi cinema.

In the 1950's, television had arrived and the theatrical market was changing. Producers and exhibitors found new, exciting and enticing ways to keep audiences in theaters. This is how Hollywood directors and producers found ample opportunity for audience exploitation through gimmicks. The years 1952 through 1954 is considered the "Golden Era" of 3-D movies. In a three-dimensional stereoscopic film, the audience's brains are tricked into believing the images projected onto a flat cinema screen are coming to life in full three-dimensional glory.[84] Through this way, the audience's fright factor is enhanced. Those who came to see a 3-D movie inside a theater were given the familiar disposable cardboard anaglyph 3D glasses to wear which will allow them to see the images come to life.

Vincent_Price_in_House_on_Haunted_Hill.jpg in _House on Haunted Hill_]] In April 1953, Warner Bros. presented the horror-thriller _House of Wax_, the first 3D feature with stereophonic sound. The film, which stars Vincent Price, tells a story of a disfigured sculptor who repopulates his destroyed wax museum by murdering people and using their wax-coated corpses as displays. _House of Wax_ was the film that typecast Price as a horror icon. A year later, he played a trademark role as a round-the-bend illusionist bent on revenge in the 3D film noir/horror _The Mad Magician_ (1954). After the release of that film, Price would be labeled the "King of 3-D" and would later become the actor to star in the most 3D features. The success of these two films proved that major studios now had a method of getting film-goers back into theaters and away from television sets, which were causing a steady decline in attendance.

Aside from 3-D technology, different forms of promotional gimmicks were used to entice film-goers into seeing the films in theaters. One great example is during the screening of 1958's _The Lost Missile_, a science fiction film in which scientists try to stop a mysterious missile from destroying the Earth. Audiences who saw the film in theaters were given "shock tags" to monitor their vitals during the movie. They were promised that anyone who would get shocked into a comatose state by the film would get a free ride home in a limousine.[85]

Percepto.jpg'', 1959: "Can You Take Percepto?"]] Film director and producer William Castle is considered the King of the film gimmick. After directing a cavalcade of B movies (low-budget commercial films) for Columbia Pictures in the 1940's, Castle set out on the independent route. And to help sell his first self-financed film _Macabre_ (1958), he not only hired girls to stand in as fake nurses outside theater doors just in case anyone needed medical attention, he also passed out a certificate for a $1,000 life insurance policy to each member of the audience in case anyone would happen to die of fright from watching his film. This kind of promotional gimmick would later make him famous.[86] Other gimmicks Castle utilized in his films include _EMERGO_ which was used during the screening of his 1959 classic _House on Haunted Hill_ starring Vincent Price. Throughout the promotion of this film, Castle explained that through EMERGO, “ghosts and skeletons leave the screen and wander throughout the audience, roam around and go back to the screen”. Of course, in actuality, a skeleton with glowing red eyes was attached to wires above the theater in order to swoop in and float above audience members' heads to parallel the action on the screen.[87] Another Castle/Price production was _The Tingler_ (1959) which tells the story of a scientist who discovers a parasite in human beings, called a "tingler", which feeds on fear. In the film, Price breaks the fourth wall and warns the audience that the tingler is in the theater which then prompts the built-in electric buzzers to scare audiences in their theater seats.

The 1950's is also well known for creature feature or giant monster movies. These are usually disaster films that focuses on a group of characters struggling to survive attacks by one or more antagonistic monsters, often abnormally large ones. The monster is often created by a folly of mankind – an experiment gone wrong, the effects of radiation or the destruction of habitat. The monster can also be from outer space, or has been on Earth for a long time with no one ever seeing it, or released (or awakened) from a prison of some sort where it was being held. In monster movies, the monster is usually a villain, but can be a metaphor of humankind's continuous destruction. Warner Bros.' _The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms_ (1953) is considered to be the film which kick-started the 1950's wave of monster movies and the concept of combining nuclear paranoia with the genre.[88] In the film, a beast was awakened from its hibernating state in the frozen ice of the Arctic Circle by an atomic bomb test. It then begins to wreak a path of destruction as it travels southward, eventually arriving at its ancient spawning grounds, which includes New York City. _The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms_ was the first ever live-action film to feature a giant monster awakened/brought about by an atomic bomb detonation, preceding _Godzilla_ by 16 months. The film is also remembered for its influential stop motion model animation created by visual effects creator Ray Harryhausen.

Ray Harryhausen created his own form of stop motion model animation called _Dynamation_. It involved photographing a miniature against a rear-projection screen through a partly masked pane of glass. The masked portion would then be re-exposed to insert foreground elements from the live footage. The effect was to make the creature appear to move in the midst of live action. It could now be seen walking behind a live tree, or be viewed in the middle distance over the shoulder of a live actor — effects difficult to achieve before. [89] Harryhausen's innovative style of special effects in films inspired numerous filmmakers including future fantasy and horror directors Peter Jackson, Tim Burton, and Guillermo del Toro. [90] In the 1963 fantasy film _Jason and the Argonauts_, there is an iconic fight scene that involves skeleton warriors. That scene spurred on numerous homages in many horror films[91] in subsequent years including 1987's _A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors_, 1992's _Army of Darkness_ and 2014's _Game of Thrones_' Season 4 episode entitled _The Children_.[92]

Other notable creature films include _It Came from Beneath the Sea_ (1955), _Tarantula_ (1955), and _The Giant Behemoth_ (1959). Japan's experience with Hiroshima and Nagasaki bore the well-known _Godzilla_ (1954) and its many sequels, featuring mutation from the effects of nuclear radiation. This kickstarted the tokusatsu trend known as Kaiju films, a Japanese film genre that features giant monsters, usually attacking major cities and engaging the military and other monsters in battle. Other films in this genre that isn't about Godzilla include _Rodan_ (1956) and _The Mysterians_ (1957). Besides Kaiju films, Japan was also into ghost cat/feline ghost movies in the 50's. These include _Ghost-Cat of Gojusan-Tsugi_ (1956), and _Black Cat Mansion_ (1958), which tells a story of a samurai tormented by a cat possessed by the spirits of the people she killed.

Filmmakers continued to merge elements of science fiction and horror over the following decades. _The Fly_ is a 1958 American science fiction-horror film starring Vincent Price. The film tells the story of a scientist who is transformed into a grotesque creature after a common house fly enters unseen into a molecular transporter he is experimenting with, resulting in his atoms being combined with those of the insect, which produces a human-fly hybrid. The film was released in CinemaScope with Color by Deluxe by 20th Century Fox. It was followed by two black-and-white sequels, _Return of the Fly_ (1959) and _Curse of the Fly_ (1965). The original film was remade in 1986 by director David Cronenberg.

Attackofthe50ftwoman.jpg Considered a "pulp masterpiece"[93] of the 1950's was _The Incredible Shrinking Man_ (1957), based on Richard Matheson's existentialist novel. The film tells the story of a man, who after getting exposed to a radioactive cloud, gets shrunk in height by several inches. The film conveyed the fears of living in the Atomic Age and the terror of social alienation. It won the first Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and was named in 2009 to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being "culturally, historically or aesthetically" significant.

The independently-produced sci-fi film _Attack of the 50 Foot Woman_ was made in 1958. The storyline concerns the plight of a wealthy heiress whose close encounter with an enormous alien causes her to grow into a giantess, complicating her marriage already troubled by a philandering husband. The film has become a cult classic and is often referenced in popular culture. _Attack of the 50 Foot Woman_ is a variation on other 1950s science fiction films that featured size-changing humans: _The Amazing Colossal Man_ (1957), its sequel _War of the Colossal Beast_ (1958), and _The Incredible Shrinking Man_ (1957).

Dracula_1958_c.jpg starred in numerous British horror films of the era, produced by Hammer Films. Shown here is the 1958 color remake of _Dracula_. It was Lee who fixed the image of the fanged vampire in popular culture.[94][95]]] The United Kingdom began to emerge as a major producer of horror films around this time.[96] The Hammer company focused on the genre for the first time, enjoying huge international success from films involving classic horror characters which were shown in color for the first time.[97] Drawing on Universal's precedent, many films produced were _Frankenstein_ and _Dracula_ remakes, followed by many sequels. Christopher Lee starred in a number of Hammer Horror films, including _The Curse of Frankenstein_ (1957), which Professor Patricia MacCormac called the "first really gory horror film, showing blood and guts in colour".[98] His most influential role was as Count Dracula, with Lee's portrayal becoming the archetypal vampire in popular culture. The academic Christopher Frayling writes of Lee's 1958 film, “_Dracula_ introduced fangs, red contact lenses, décolletage, ready-prepared wooden stakes and – in the celebrated credits sequence – blood being spattered from off-screen over the Count's coffin.”[99] Lee also introduced a dark, brooding sexuality to the character, with Tim Stanley stating, “Lee’s sensuality was subversive in that it hinted that women might quite like having their neck chewed on by a stud”.[100] Other British companies contributed to a boom in horror film production in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and 1970s.

In television, the anthology series _The Twilight Zone_ (1959–1964) has become a staple in horror fiction.[101] Each episode presents a standalone story in which characters find themselves dealing with often disturbing or unusual events, an experience described as entering "the Twilight Zone". Although predominantly science-fiction, the show's paranormal and Kafkaesque events leaned the show towards fantasy and horror. The phrase "twilight zone," is used today to describe surreal experiences.

1960s

Released in May 1960, the British psychological horror thriller film, _Peeping Tom_ (1960) by Michael Powell, is a progenitor of the contemporary "slasher film",[102] though Alfred Hitchcock cemented the subgenre with _Psycho_ released also in the same year.[103] Hitchcock, considered to be the "Master of Suspense" didn't set out to frighten fans the way many other traditional horror filmmakers do. Instead, he helped pioneer the art of psychological suspense. As a result, he managed to frighten his viewers by getting to the root of their deepest fears.[104] One of his most frightening films besides _Psycho_ is _The Birds_ (1963), where a seemingly idyllic town is overrun by violent birds.

France continued the mad scientist theme with the film _Eyes Without a Face_ (1960). The story follows Parisian police in search of the culprit responsible for the deaths of young women whose faces have been mutilated.[105] In Criterion's description of the film, they say it include "images of terror, of gore, [and] of inexplicable beauty".[106]

Meanwhile, Italian horror films became internationally notable thanks to Mario Bava's contributions. His film _La Maschera del Demonio_ (1960), marketed in English as _The Mask of Satan_ then wound up being known as _Black Sunday_ in the United States and _Revenge of the Vampire_ in the United Kingdom. In this film, Bava turned a Russian folk legend into a beguiling fairly tale about a young doctor who finds himself stranded in a haunted community and falls for a woman whose body become possessed by a woman executed for witchcraft. Three years later, Bava went on to make the horror anthology film _Black Sabbath_ (1963) known in Italy as _I tre volti della paura_, literally 'The Three Faces of Fear'.

In the United States, gimmicks continued to be used to entice film-goers into theaters. William Castle's 1960 horror film _13 Ghosts_ was shot in "_Illusion-O_", where audiences were given a “supernatural viewer” that they could wear to see hidden ghosts in the film.[107] In _13 Ghosts_, a family searches for fortune inside the mansion of a reclusive doctor who passed away. They will need to search the house to find the doctor’s fortune, but along with the property they have also inherited the occultist’s collection of thirteen ghosts. In 1961, Castle made _Mr. Sardonicus_. It tells the story of a man whose face becomes frozen in a horrifying grin while robbing his father's grave to obtain a winning lottery ticket. During the promotion of the film, Castle introduced the “punishment poll” where the audiences decide what happens to Mr. Sardonicus in the film. All they had to do was hold up a “thumbs up” ballot if they wanted Mr. Sardonicus go free or "thumbs down" if they want to punish him. Supposedly no audience ever voted for life over death, so the film continues as if the audience’s majority verdict was seriously counted.[108] Also in the same year, William Castle made _Homicidal_, which follows a murderous woman in a small California town. A “fright break” was featured during the film where the audiences are shown a timer over the terrifying climax. The audiences who are too frightened to see the end of the film are given 25 seconds to walk out of the theater and into the “coward's corner” where they could get a full refund of their ticket and a free blood pressure test. [109]

Francis Ford Coppola in his feature debut also used gimmicks in the screenings for his 1963 horror/thriller _Dementia 13_. Before you could see the film inside the theaters, you had to pass a 13 question test that included such questions as “_Did you ever do anything seriously wrong for which you felt little or no guilt?_” and “_Have you ever been hospitalized in a locked mental ward... or other facility for treatment of mental illness?_”. If audiences failed any of the questions they wouldn’t be allowed inside the theater.[110] In _Dementia 13_, a scheming widow hatches a daring plan to get her hands on her late husband's inheritance, unbeknownst to her that she is targeted by an axe-wielding murderer who lurks within the family's estate.

The American International Pictures (AIP), in the early 60s, made a series of films based on stories by Edgar Allan Poe, most of which star Vincent Price, who became well known for his performances in subsequent horror films of the time. His success in _House of Usher_ (1960) led him to do other Poe adaptions like _Tales of Terror_ (1962) and _The Masque of the Red Death_ (1964). Other popular Vincent Price horror films include _House on Haunted Hill_ (1959) and _The Last Man on Earth_ (1964) where Price becomes a reluctant Vampire hunter after becoming the last man on earth.

The British horror film _The Haunting_ (1963) was directed and produced by Robert Wise. It is an adaptation of the 1959 horror novel _The Haunting of Hill House_ by famed horror writer Shirley Jackson. Robert Wise's _The Haunting_ is considered by a great many critics, aficionados, and casual fans of the horror genre to be one of the scariest films of all time. The film is best known for its brilliant use of canted frames, mirror reflections, fish-eye lenses and uncanny sound and image editing.

Roman Polanski made his first film in English with _Repulsion_ (1965), which is considered to be his scariest and most disturbing work. Polanski's "evocations of sexual panic and masterful use of sound puts the audiences' imagination to work in numerous ways".[111] This psychological horror film tells the story of a young withdrawn woman who finds sexual advances repulsive and who, after she is left alone, becomes even more isolated and detached from reality.

Miles_and_Flora_in_The_Innocents.png in _The Innocents_ was whether the children (pictured) were conduits for malicious spirits, or the phenomena was the invention of the protagonist's mind]] Horror films of the 1960s used the supernatural premise to express the horror of the demonic. Jack Clayton's _The Innocents_ (1961) tell the story of a governess who fears that the children she is watching over are possessed by ghosts haunting the estate they are staying. The story was based on Henry James' 1898 horror novella _The Turn of the Screw_. A few years later, Roman Polanski wrote and directed _Rosemary's Baby_ (1968), based on the bestselling horror novel by Ira Levin. The highly influential film tells the story of a pregnant woman who suspects that an evil cult wants to take her baby for use in their rituals. Meanwhile, ghosts were a dominant theme in Japanese horror, in such films as _Kwaidan_, _Onibaba_ (both 1964) and _Kuroneko_ (1968).

Zombies_NightoftheLivingDead.jpgs in Romero's most influential film, the groundbreaking 1968 _Night of the Living Dead_. This was the template for all future zombie films.]]Another influential American horror film of the 60s was George A. Romero's _Night of the Living Dead_ (1968). Produced and directed by Romero on a budget of $114,000, it grossed $30 million internationally. Considered to be the first true zombie movie, the film began to combine psychological insights with gore. Distancing the era from earlier gothic trends, late 1960s films brought horror into everyday life.

Low-budget splatter films from the likes of Herschell Gordon Lewis also gained prominence in the 1960s.[112] It's the precursor to "torture porn" movies that would become popular in the following decades. Some of Lewis' notorious works include _Two Thousand Maniacs!_ (1964) which follows a group of Northern tourists savagely tortured and murdered during a Confederate celebration of a small southern community's centennial; and _Color Me Blood Red_ (1965), a story about a psychotic painter who murders civilians and uses their blood as red paint.

In television, the animated mystery Hanna-Barbera series _Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!_ was broadcast from 1969 to 1970. The series centers on a group of teenagers and their dog who go to abandoned places to solve mysteries involving supposedly supernatural creatures through a series of antics and missteps. The animated series' simple formula had a major impact on future slasher films especially of its portrayal of villains in masks.[113]

1970s–1980s

Suspiria_1977.jpg, right) and Sara (Stefania Casini, left) in _Suspiria_, an Italian supernatural horror film.]] The 1970s began a new age for horror films with the transition from "classic" to modern horror. Horror films started to focus more on aggressiveness and ruthlessness while also focusing more on artistic qualities and societal themes.[114] This era of horror films has been regarded as a "golden age" that transformed the genre by having it "grow up" while showing that horror can be artistic.[115]

The 1970s was an era dominated by American horror films. Unlike the past, which was influenced heavily by European film-makers, Americans breathed a new life into the genre. Modern horror films took the expected roles of characters in the films and changed them.[116]

This era changed the usual setting for horror films, using every-day settings. Along with this came a change from focusing on defeating evil every time to having some instances where good fails before succeeding.[117] The critical and popular success of _Rosemary's Baby_, led to the release of more films with occult themes in the 1970s, such as _The Omen_ (1976), wherein a man realizes that his five-year-old adopted son is the Antichrist. Invincible to human intervention, demons became villains in many horror films with a postmodern style and a dystopian worldview.

_Don't Look Now_ (1973), a independent British-Italian film directed by Nicolas Roeg, was also notable. Its focus on the psychology of grief was unusually strong for a film featuring a supernatural horror plot. Another notable film is _The Wicker Man_ (1973), a British mystery horror film dealing with the practice of ancient pagan rituals in the modern era.

In the 1970s, Italian filmmakers Mario Bava, Riccardo Freda, Antonio Margheriti, and Dario Argento developed giallo horror films that became classics and influenced the genre in other countries. Representative films include: _The Bird with the Crystal Plumage,_Twitch of the Death Nerve'', and _Deep Red_.

The ideas of the 1960s began to influence horror films in the 70s, as the youth involved in the counterculture began exploring the medium. Wes Craven's _The Hills Have Eyes_ (1977) and _The Last House on the Left_ (1972) along with Tobe Hooper's _The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_ (1974)[118] recalled the Vietnam War; while George A. Romero satirized the consumer society in his zombie sequel, _Dawn of the Dead_ (1978). Meanwhile, the subgenre of comedy horror re-emerged in the cinema with _The Abominable Dr. Phibes_ (1971), _Young Frankenstein_ (1974), _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_ (1975), and _An American Werewolf in London_ (1981) among others.

Also in the 1970s, the works of the horror author Stephen King began to be adapted for the screen, beginning with Brian De Palma's adaptation of _Carrie_ (1976), King's first published novel, for which the two female leads (Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie) gained Oscar nominations. Next, was his third published novel, _The Shining_ (1980), directed by Stanley Kubrick, which was a sleeper at the box office. At first, many critics and viewers had negative feedback toward _The Shining_. However, the film is now known as one of Hollywood's most classic horror films.

This psychological horror film has a variety of themes; "evil children", alcoholism, telepathy, and insanity. This type of film is an example of how Hollywood's idea of horror started to evolve. Murder and violence were no longer the main themes of horror films. In the 1970s and 1980s, psychological and supernatural horror started to take over cinema. Another classic Hollywood horror film is Tobe Hooper's _Poltergeist_ (1982). _Poltergeist_ is ranked the 20th scariest movie ever made by the Chicago Film Critics Association. Both _The Shining_ and _Poltergeist_ involve horror being based on real-estate values. The evil and horror throughout the films come from where the movies are taking place.[119][120]

_The Amityville Horror_ is a 1979 supernatural horror film directed by Stuart Rosenberg, based on Jay Anson's 1977 book of the same name. It stars James Brolin and Margot Kidder as a young couple who purchase a home they come to find haunted by combative supernatural forces. _The Changeling_ is a 1980 Canadian supernatural psychological horror film directed by Peter Medak.

Steven Spielberg's shark horror film, _Jaws_ (1975), began a new wave of killer animal stories, such as _Orca_ (1977) and _Up from the Depths_ (1979). _Jaws_ is often credited as being one of the first films to use traditionally B movie elements such as horror and mild gore in a big-budget Hollywood film. In 1979, Don Coscarelli's _Phantasm_ was the first of the Phantasm franchise.

A cycle of slasher films began in the 1970s and 1980s with the creation of _Halloween_ by John Carpenter. "Halloween" was a significant influence on the horror industry and has become one of the quintessential forerunners of commercial horror films, grossing 70 Million usd on a shoestring budget of $300,000–325,000.[121] Its influence and inspiration can still be seen in films today.

Another notable 1970s slasher films are Bob Clark's _Black Christmas_ (1974). _Sleepaway Camp_ (1983) is known for its twist ending, which is considered by some to be one of the most shocking endings among horror films. _My Bloody Valentine_ (1981) is a slasher film dealing with Valentine's Day fiction.

The boom in slasher films provided enough material for numerous comedic spoofs of the genre including _Saturday the 14th_ (1981), _Student Bodies_ (1981), _National Lampoon's Class Reunion_ (1982), and _Hysterical_ (1983).

This subgenre would be mined by dozens of increasingly violent movies throughout the subsequent decades. Sean S. Cunningham made _Friday the 13th_ (1980), Wes Craven directed _A Nightmare on Elm Street_ (1984), and Clive Barker made _Hellraiser_ (1987).

Some films explored urban legends such as "The babysitter and the man upstairs". A notable example is _When a Stranger Calls_ (1979), an American psychological horror film directed by Fred Walton starring Carol Kane and Charles Durning.

_Alien_ (1979), a British-American science-fiction horror film directed by Ridley Scott was very successful, receiving both critical acclaim and being a box office success. John Carpenter's movie _The Thing_ (1982) was also a mix of horror and sci-fi, but it was neither a box-office nor critical hit, but soon became a cult classic. However, nearly 20 years after its release, it was praised for using ahead-of-its-time special effects and paranoia.

The 1980s saw a wave of gory "B movie" horror films – although most of them were poorly reviewed by critics, many became cult classics and later saw success with critics. A significant example is Sam Raimi's _Evil Dead_ movies, which were low-budget gorefests but had a very original plotline which was later praised by critics. In the Philippines, the first _Shake, Rattle & Roll_ (1984) was released. The horror anthology film spawned a franchise of films in the country over the subsequent decades.

_Day of the Dead_ is a 1985 horror film written and directed by George A. Romero and the third film in Romero's _Night of the Living Dead_ series.

Vampire horror was also popular in the 1980s, including cult vampire classics such as _Fright Night_ (1985), _The Lost Boys_ (1987), and _Near Dark_ (also 1987). In 1984, Joe Dante's seminal monster comedy horror _Gremlins_ became a box office hit with critics and audiences, and inspired a trend of "little monster" films such as _Critters_ and _Ghoulies_.[122]

David Cronenberg's films such as _Shivers_ (1975), _Rabid_ (1977), _The Brood_ (1979), _The Dead Zone_ (1983), and _The Fly_ (1986) dealt with "body horror" and "mad scientist" themes.[123]

Several science fiction action horror movies were released in the 1980s, notably _Aliens_ (1986) and _Predator_ (1987). Notable comedy horror films of the 1980s include _Re-Animator_ (1985), and _Night of the Creeps_ (1986).

_Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer_ is a 1986 psychological horror crime film directed and co-written by John McNaughton about the random crime spree of a serial killer who seemingly operates with impunity. _Pumpkinhead_ (1988) is a dark fantasy horror film, which is the directorial debut of special effects artist Stan Winston.

1990s

In the first half of the 1990s, the genre still contained many of the themes from the 1980s. The slasher films, _A Nightmare on Elm Street_, _Friday the 13th_, _Halloween_, and _Child's Play_, all saw sequels in the 1990s, most of which met with varied amounts of success at the box office but all were panned by critics, with the exception of Wes Craven's _New Nightmare_ (1994) and the hugely successful film, _The Silence of the Lambs_ (1991). The latter, which stars Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, is considered a major horror movie of all times.[124] _Misery_ (1990) also deals with a psychopath, and the film received critical acclaim for Kathy Bates's performance as the psychopathic Annie Wilkes.

_New Nightmare_, with _In the Mouth of Madness_ (1995), _The Dark Half_ (1993), and _Candyman_ (1992), were part of a mini-movement of self-reflexive or metafictional horror films. Each film touched upon the relationship between fictional horror and real-world horror. _Candyman_, for example, examined the link between an invented urban legend and the realistic horror of the racism that produced its villain. _In the Mouth of Madness_ took a more literal approach, as its protagonist actually hopped from the real world into a novel created by the madman he was hired to track down. This reflective style became more overt and ironic with the arrival of _Scream_ (1996).

In _Interview with the Vampire_ (1994), the "Theatre de Vampires" (and the film itself, to some degree) invoked the Grand Guignol style, perhaps to further remove the undead performers from humanity, morality and class. The horror movie soon continued its search for new and effective frights. In the 1985 novel, _The Vampire Lestat_, by the author Anne Rice (who penned _Interview with the Vampire_{{'}}s screenplay and the 1976 novel of the same name) suggests that its antihero Lestat inspired and nurtured the Grand Guignol style and theatre.

Two main problems pushed horror backward during this period: firstly, the horror genre wore itself out with the proliferation of nonstop slasher and gore films in the eighties. Secondly, the adolescent audience which feasted on the blood and morbidity of the previous decade grew up, and the replacement audience for films of an imaginative nature were being captured instead by the explosion of science-fiction and fantasy films, courtesy of the special effects possibilities with advances made in computer-generated imagery.[125] Examples of these CGI include movies like _Species_ (1995), _Anaconda_ (1997), _Mimic_ (1997), _Blade_ (1998), _Deep Rising_ (1998), _House on Haunted Hill_ (1999), _Sleepy Hollow_ (1999), and _The Haunting_ (1999).

To re-connect with its audience, horror became more self-mockingly ironic and outright parodic, especially in the latter half of the 1990s. Peter Jackson's _Braindead_ (1992) (known as _Dead Alive_ in the United States) took the splatter film to ridiculous excesses for comic effect. Wes Craven's _Scream_ (written by Kevin Williamson) movies, starting in 1996, featured teenagers who were fully aware of, and often made reference to, the history of horror movies, and mixed ironic humour with the shocks (despite _Scream 2_ and _Scream 3_ utilising less use of the humour of the original, until _Scream 4_ in 2011, and rather more references to horror film conventions). Along with _I Know What You Did Last Summer_ (1997) (also written by Williamson) and _Urban Legend_ (1998), they re-ignited the dormant slasher film genre.

_Event Horizon_ (1997) is a British-American science fiction horror film directed by Paul W. S. Anderson. _The Sixth Sense_ (1999) is a supernatural horror film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, which tells the story of Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a troubled, isolated boy who is able to see and talk to the dead, and an equally troubled child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) who tries to help him.

_House on Haunted Hill_ is a 1999 horror film directed by William Malone which follows a group of strangers who are invited to a party at an abandoned asylum, where they are offered $1 million each by an amusement park mogul if they are able to survive the night. It is a remake of the 1959 film of the same title. Other horror films of the late 1990s include _Cube_ (1997), _The Faculty_ (1998), _Disturbing Behavior_ (1998), _Stir of Echoes_ (1999), _Stigmata_ (1999), and _Existenz_ (1999).

Monster horror was quite popular in the 1990s. _Tremors_ (1990) is the first installment of the _Tremors_ franchise. _Lake Placid_ (1999) is another monster horror film, written by David E. Kelley and directed by Steve Miner.

Another successful horror film is _Ring (film)_, a 1998 Japanese supernatural psychological horror film about a cursed video tape, after the person watches it, the phone rings, and someone tells them that they will die in seven days, directed by Hideo Nakata. Around this period, Japanese horror started becoming popular in English speaking countries.

In South Korea, the success of supernatural horror film Whispering Corridors (1998) by Park Ki-hyung, sparked the explosion of Korean horror.

The film _The Last Broadcast_ (1998) served as inspiration for the highly successful _The Blair Witch Project_ (1999), which popularized the found footage horror subgenre. The theme of witchcraft was also addressed in _The Witches_ (1990), starring Anjelica Huston, and _The Craft_ (1996), a supernatural horror film directed by Andrew Fleming. _Wolf_ is a 1994 romantic horror film following the transformation of a man (Jack Nicholson) into a werewolf.

_Ravenous_ (1999) starring Guy Pearce and directed by Antonia Bird is a "quirky"[126] and gruesome movie based on the real life horror story of the Donner party that got stranded in the Sierra Nevada mountains in 1847 due to snow.[127]

2000s

The decade started with _American Psycho_ (2000) directed by Mary Harron starring Christian Bale as a charismatic serial killer and Manhattan business mogul. The movie was highly controversial when released and remains a cult classic today.[128] _Scary Movie_ (2000), a comedy horror directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans parodied of the horror, slasher, and mystery genres. The film received mixed reviews from critics. By contrast, _Valentine_ (2001) was a conventional horror film. It had some success at the box office, but was derided by critics for being formulaic and relying on foregone horror film conventions. _The Others_ (2001) was hugely successful, winning and being further nominated for many awards. It is a 2001 English-language Spanish gothic supernatural psychological horror film. It was written, directed, and scored by Alejandro Amenábar. It stars Nicole Kidman and Fionnula Flanagan.

Franchise films such as _Jason X_ (2001) and _Freddy vs. Jason_ (2003) also made a stand in theaters. _Final Destination_ (2000) marked a successful revival of teen-centered horror and spawned five installments. _Jeepers Creepers_ series was also successful. Films such as _Hollow Man_ (2000), _Cabin Fever_ (2002), _House of 1000 Corpses_ (2003) (the latter an exploitation horror film written, co-scored and directed by Rob Zombie in his directorial debut) and the previous mentions helped bring the genre back to Restricted ratings in theaters. _Van Helsing_ (2004) and _Underworld_ series had huge box office success, despite mostly negative reviews by critics. _Ginger Snaps_ (2000) is a Canadian film dealing with the tragic transformation of a teenage girl who is bitten by a werewolf. _Signs_ (2002) revived the science fiction alien theme. _28 Days Later_ (2002) is a British post-apocalyptic horror film directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland, it's about a highly contagious virus that devastated Great Britain, four survivors are going for a safe haven in Manchester, a critical and commercial success, the film helped revitalize the zombie horror subgenre and introduced the new concept of fast zombies._The Descent_, a 2005 British adventure horror film written and directed by Neil Marshall was also successful. Another notable film is _Drag Me to Hell_, a 2009 American supernatural horror film co-written and directed by Sam Raimi. _The Strangers_ (2008) deals with unprovoked stranger-on-stranger violence. _The House of the Devil_ (2009) is inspired by the "satanic panic" of the 1980s. _Trick 'r Treat_ is a 2007 anthology horror film written and directed by Michael Dougherty and produced by Bryan Singer. _Black Water_ (2007) is a British-Australian natural horror film. Another natural adventure horror film is _The Ruins_ (2008), which is based on the novel of the same name by Scott Smith.

Several horror film adaptations from comic books and video games were produced. _30 Days of Night_ (2007) is based on the comic book miniseries of the same name. The story focuses on an Alaskan town beset by vampires as it enters into a 30-day long polar night. Comic book adaptations like the _Blade_ series, _Constantine_ (2005), and _Hellboy_ (2004) also became box office successes. The _Resident Evil_ video game franchise was adapted into a film released in March 2002, and several sequels followed. Other video game adaptations like _Doom_ (2005) and _Silent Hill_ (2006) also had moderate box office success.

Some pronounced trends have marked horror films. Films from non-English language countries have become successful. The _Devil's Backbone_ (2001) is such an example. It is a 2001 Spanish-Mexican gothic horror film directed by Guillermo del Toro, and written by del Toro, David Muñoz, and Antonio Trashorras. A French horror film _Brotherhood of the Wolf_ (2001) became the second-highest-grossing French language film in the United States in the last two decades. The Swedish film _Let the Right One In_ (2008) was also successful. _REC_ is a 2007 Spanish zombie horror film, co-written and directed by Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza. _Martyrs_ (2008), a French-Canadian horror film, was controversial upon its release, receiving polarizing reviews. Another notable film is _The Orphanage_ (2007), a Spanish horror film and the debut feature of Spanish filmmaker J. A. Bayona. _A Tale of Two Sisters_ is a 2003 South Korean psychological drama horror film written and directed by Kim Jee-woon. _Shutter_ (2004) is a Thai horror film which focuses on mysterious images seen in developed pictures. _Cold Prey_ is a 2006 Norwegian slasher film directed by Roar Uthaug.

Another trend is the emergence of psychology to scare audiences, rather than gore. _The Others_ (2001) proved to be a successful example of a psychological horror film. A minimalist approach which was equal parts Val Lewton's theory of "less is more", usually employing the low-budget techniques utilized on _The Blair Witch Project_ (1999), has been evident, particularly in the emergence of Asian horror movies which have been remade into successful Americanized versions, such as _The Ring_ (2002), _The Grudge_ (2004), _Dark Water_ (2005), and _Pulse_ (2006). In March 2008, China banned the movies from its market.[129] _Credo_ (2008) and _Triangle_ (2009) are two British psychological horror films. _What Lies Beneath_ (2000) is a supernatural horror film directed by Robert Zemeckis, starring Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer as a couple who experience a strange haunting of their home. _Orphan_ (2009) is a notable psychological horror film. Another psychological horror film is _1408_ (2007), based on Stephen King's 1999 short story of the same name. Two Australian horror films that deal with teenagers are _Lake Mungo_ (2008) and _The Loved Ones_ (2009).

The films _I Am Legend_ (2007), _Quarantine_ (2008), _Zombieland_ (2009), and _28 Days Later_ (2002) featured an update of the apocalyptic and aggressive zombie genre. The latter film spawned a sequel: _28 Weeks Later_ (2007). An updated remake of _Dawn of the Dead_ (2004) soon appeared as well as the zombie comedy _Shaun of the Dead_ (2004) and Spanish -Cuban comedy zombie film _Juan of the Dead_ (2012). This resurgence led George A. Romero to return to his Living Dead series with _Land of the Dead_ (2005), _Diary of the Dead_ (2007) and _Survival of the Dead_ (2009).[130] Cannibals were present in horror films such as _Dahmer_ (2002), _Wrong Turn_ (2003), _Tooth and Nail_ (2007), and _Dying Breed_ (2008). _Jennifer's Body_ (2009) starring Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried, written by Diablo Cody and directly by Karyn Kusama brings a succubus into a suburban American high school.

The Australian film _Wolf Creek_ (2005) written, co-produced, and directed by Greg McLean revolves around three backpackers who find themselves taken captive and after a brief escape, hunted down by Mick Taylor in the Australian outback. The film was ambiguously marketed as being "based on true events"; the plot bore elements reminiscent of the real-life murders of tourists by Ivan Milat in the 1990s, and Bradley Murdoch in 2001; and contained more extreme violence. An extension of this trend was the emergence of a type of horror with emphasis on depictions of torture, suffering, and violent deaths, (variously referred to as "horror porn", "torture porn", "splatterporn" and "gore-nography") with films such as _Ghost Ship_ (2002), _The Collector_ (2009), _Saw_ (2004), _Hostel_ (2005), and their respective sequels, frequently singled out as examples of emergence of this subgenre.[131] In 2010 the _Saw_ film series held the Guinness World Record of the highest-grossing horror franchise in history.[132] Finally, with the arrival of _Paranormal Activity_ (2007), which was well received by critics and an excellent reception at the box office, minimalist horror approach started by _The Blair Witch Project_ was reaffirmed. _Cloverfield_ (2008) is another found footage horror film. _The Mist_ (2007) is a science-fiction horror film based on the 1980 novella of the same name by Stephen King. _Antichrist_ (2009) is an English-language Danish experimental horror film written and directed by Lars von Trier, and starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg. _The Exorcism of Emily Rose_ is a 2005 legal drama horror film directed by Scott Derrickson, loosely based on the story of Anneliese Michel. _The Children_ (2008) is British horror film focusing on the mayhem created by several children. Another 2008 British horror film is _Eden Lake_.

Remakes of earlier horror movies became routine in the 2000s. In addition to the remake of _Dawn of the Dead_ (2004), as well as the remake of both Herschell Gordon Lewis' cult classic, _2001 Maniacs_ (2003), and the remake of Tobe Hooper's classic, _The Texas Chainsaw Massacre_ (2003), there was also the 2007 Rob Zombie-written and -directed remake of John Carpenter's _Halloween_.[133] The film focused more on Michael's backstory than the original did, devoting the first half of the film to Michael's childhood. It was critically panned by most,[134][135] but was a success in its theatrical run, spurring its own sequel. This film helped to start a "reimagining" riot in horror filmmakers. Among the many remakes or "reimaginings" of other popular horror films and franchises are films such as _Thirteen Ghosts_ (2001), _The Texas Chainsaw Massacre_ (2003), _The Hills Have Eyes_ (2006), _Friday the 13th_ (2009),[136] _Children of the Corn_ (2009),[137] _Halloween_ (2007), _Prom Night_ (2008), _The Omen_ (2006), _Carrie_ (2002), _The Wicker Man_ (2006), _Day of the Dead_ (2008), _Night of the Demons_ (2009), _My Bloody Valentine_ (2009), _Willard_ (2003), _Black Christmas (2006)_, _The Amityville Horror_ (2005), _April Fool's Day_ (2008), _The Fog_ (2005), _The Hitcher_ (2007), _It's Alive_ (2009), _When a Stranger Calls_ (2006), and _The Last House on the Left_ (2009).

Horror has become prominent on television with _The Walking Dead_, _American Horror Story_, and _The Strain_, and on online streaming services like Netflix's _Stranger Things_ and _Haunting of Hill House_. Also, many popular horror films have had successful television series made: _Psycho_ spawned _Bates Motel_, _The Silence of the Lambs_ spawned _Hannibal_, and both _Scream_ and _Friday the 13th_ had TV series in development.[139][140]

_You're Next_ (2011) and _The Cabin in the Woods_ (2012) led to a return to the slasher genre; the latter was intended also as a critical satire of torture porn.[141] _The Green Inferno_ (2015) pays homage to the controversial horror film, _Cannibal Holocaust_ (1980).

Get Out received four Oscar nominations (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Original Screenplay) at the 90th Academy Awards, of which Peele won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Peele's sophomore film, _Us_, addresses social class and privilege as it follows a family terrorized by their murderous doppelgängers.

Influences

Influences on society

Horror films' evolution throughout the years has given society a new approach to resourcefully utilize their benefits. The horror film style has changed over time, but, in 1996, _Scream_ set off a "chain of copycats", leading to a new variety of teenage, horror movies.[153] This new approach to horror films began to gradually earn more and more revenue as seen in the progress of _Scream_ movies; the first movie earned $6 million and the third movie earned $101 million.[154] The importance that horror films have gained in the public and producers’ eyes is one obvious effect on our society.

Horror films' income expansion is only the first sign of the influences of horror flicks. The role of women and how women see themselves in the movie industry has been altered by the horror genre. Early horror films such as _My Bloody Valentine_ (1981), _Halloween_ (1978), and _Friday the 13th_ (1980) were produced mostly for male audiences in order to "feed the fantasies of young men".[155] This idea is no longer prevalent in horror films, as women have become not only the main audience and fans of horror films but also the main protagonists of contemporary horror films.[156] Movie makers have also begun to integrate topics more broadly associated with other genres into their films in order to grow audience appeal.[157]

Many early horror films created great social and legal controversy. In the U.S., the Motion Picture Production Code which was implemented in 1930, set moral guidelines for film content, restraining movies containing controversial themes, graphic violence, explicit sexuality and/or nudity. The gradual abandonment of the Code, and its eventual formal repeal in 1968 (when it was replaced by the MPAA film rating system) offered more freedom to the movie industry. Nevertheless, controversy continued to surround horror movies, and many continued to face censorship issues around the world. For example, 1978's _I Spit on Your Grave_, an American rape-and-revenge exploitation horror film written, co-produced, directed, and edited by Meir Zarchi, was received negatively by critics, but it attracted a great deal of national and international attention due to its explicit scenes of rape, murder and prolonged nudity, which led to bans in countries such as Ireland, Norway, Iceland, and West Germany. Many of these countries later removed the ban, but the film remains prohibited in Ireland.[158]

Influences internationally

While horror is only one genre of film, the influence it presents to the international community is large. Horror movies tend to be a vessel for showing eras of audiences issues across the globe visually and in the most effective manner. Jeanne Hall, a film theorist, agrees with the use of horror films in easing the process of understanding issues by making use of their optical elements.[159] The use of horror films to help audiences understand international prior historical events occurs, for example, to depict the horrors of the Vietnam War, the Holocaust and the worldwide AIDS epidemic.[160] However, horror movies do not always present positive endings. In fact, in many occurrences the manipulation of horror presents cultural definitions that are not accurate, yet set an example to which a person relates to that specific cultural from then on in their life.[161]

The visual interpretations of films can be lost in the translation of their elements from one culture to another, like in the adaptation of the Japanese film _Ju on_ into the American film _The Grudge_. The cultural components from Japan were slowly "siphoned away" to make the film more relatable to a western audience.[162] This deterioration that can occur in an international remake happens by over-presenting negative cultural assumptions that, as time passes, sets a common ideal about that particular culture in each individual.[163] Holm's discussion of _The Grudge_ remakes presents this idea by stating, "It is, instead, to note that _The Grudge_ films make use of an un-theorized notion of Japan... that seek to directly represent the country."
