PETER GUMBSCH (born 21 January 1962 in Pforzheim, Germany) is a German physicist and materials scientist. He is the director of the Fraunhofer-Institut für Werkstoffmechanik IWM, (Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials IWM) in Freiburg, Germany and professor for mechanics of materials at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).


'Biography'

Peter Gumbsch received his degree in physics (1988) and his doctoral degree (1991) from the University of Stuttgart. After extended visits at the Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, California, postdoctoral work at the Imperial College, London and the University of Oxford, he returned to the Max-Planck-Institute in Stuttgart as a group leader and established the group “Modeling and Simulation of Thin Film Phenomena”. In 2001 he took the chair for Mechanics of Materials at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology KIT and the position as head of Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials IWM in Freiburg.

Amongst other recognitions, Gumbsch was awarded the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize in 2007. He is a member of the German Council of Science and Humanities (Wissenschaftsrat) since 2015 and in 2016 was elected to the Senate of the Fraunhofer Society. He is married and has three children.


Research

His research activities focus on modelling and simulation of materials, from atomistic, microscopic and mesoscopic approaches to continuum mechanics methods. The main topics are deformation and fracture properties of metallic and ceramic materials as well as friction, wear and lubrication processes (tribology).
