Nottingham played a total of 15 first-class matches, 13 of them between 1826 and 1834 and two in 1848 after the establishment of Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club in 1841.

Teams played under the Nottinghamshire name from 1835 onwards and many of the players listed played for Nottinghamshire teams.
