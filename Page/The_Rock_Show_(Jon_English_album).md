_THE ROCK SHOW_ was a musical theatrical production which toured Australia between 2009 and 2012. Created by Stuart Smith, the production starred Smith, Jon English, Isaac Hayward, Paul Toole, Amy Vee, Andrew Sampford, Joe Kalou, Shaun Tarring, Kita Kerford, Natalya Bing and Jonathan Sora-English. The production was a tribute to rock music from 1965 to 1980, and contained tracks originally recorded by AC/DC, Bob Dylan, The Who, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and David Bowie among many other artists from the time period. English said, "I'm amazingly proud to be a part of this show. People come along to see me, not really knowing what to expect, but invariably leave saying they are just blown away by the world class young talent on stage."[1]

The show was released on DVD in May and on CD/digital download in July 2012.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2012, the album was nominated for ARIA Award for Best Original Soundtrack, Cast or Show Album but lost to _Straight to You – Triple J's Tribute to Nick Cave_.[2]

The production was followed by a series of similar shows including _The Rock Show More,_ _Rock Revolution_ and _Trilogy of Rock._ A fifth version, _The Rock Show - Oz Edition,_ focusing solely on Australian music from the same time period, was to have toured in late 2016 but was cancelled after English died in March of that year.[3]
