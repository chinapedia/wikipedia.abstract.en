" from the 1927 movie "Metropolis". Statue in Babelsberg, Germany.]] Robots and androids have frequently been depicted or described in works of fiction. The word "robot" itself comes from a work of fiction, Karel Čapek's play, _R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)_, written in 1920 and first performed in 1921.

This LIST OF FICTIONAL ROBOTS AND ANDROIDS is chronological, and categorised by medium. It includes all depictions of robots, androids and gynoids in literature, television, and cinema; however, robots that have appeared in more than one form of media are not necessarily listed in each of those media. This list is intended for all fictional computers which are described as existing in a humanlike or mobile form. It shows how the concept has developed in the human imagination through history.

Static computers depicted in fiction are discussed in the separate list of fictional computers.


Theatre

-   _COPPÉLIA_, a life-size dancing doll in the ballet of the same name, choreographed by Marius Petipa with music by Léo Delibes (1870)
-   The word "robot" comes from Karel Čapek's play, _R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)_ written in 1920 in the Czech language and first performed 1921. Performed in New York 1922 and an English edition published in 1923. In the play, the word refers to artificially created life forms.[1] Named robots in the play are MARIUS, SULLA, RADIUS, PRIMUS, HELENA, and DAMON.

Another legend has Hephaestus being commanded by Zeus to create the first woman, Pandora, out of clay.

Podcasts

-   LITTLE BUTTON PUSS, character from Episode #310 of the _Comedy Bang! Bang!_ podcast, played by John Gemberling. Little Button Puss, a.k.a. HPDP69-B, is a promotional robot built by Hewlett-Packard and is the first ever robot created with a fully sentient artificial intelligence, personality, and speaking function. It was designed by HP engineers for the express purpose of sexually pleasing humans. _Comedy Bang! Bang!_ host Scott Aukerman was sent Little Button Puss as part of a promotional advertising campaign for the line of sex-robots. Little Button Puss looks like a metal dog, and has small flesh patches where its genitals are. Elsewhere, it's described as having the appearance of "nickel blue, gun metal". It is verified in the episode that Scott Aukerman lustily removed Little Button Puss's retractable genitals, threw them in a trash can, and then proceeded to use the HPDP69-B for its intended purpose. Afterwards, according to _Comedy Bang! Bang!_ official canon, Aukerman looked back on the incident with shame. A complaint about the HPDP69-B is that, for a sex-robot, "it looks too much like a metal dog". In a brief look into its past, Little Button Puss recounts an old romantic relationship with its long lost love, United Flight 93, who "died in the September 11th attacks".[11]

-   NO-3113 (Pronounced "NOELLE"), a "hug-sized" robot in the Dungeons & Dragons podcast The Adventure Zone, created by Clinton, Justin, Travis, and Griffin McElroy. She is a robot created by the scientist Lucas Miller. She is described as looking pieced together from assorted parts with the sequence "NO-3113" written on her side. She floats above the ground and is able to administer healing shots. Later, she upgrades her body into a gorilla-like robot with four arms. It is later revealed that she is a ghost inhabiting the body of robot and was Lucas' first trial in retrieving a human soul from the Astral Plane and putting it inside a fusebox. Her original identity was Noelle Redcheek - a red-haired halfling girl part of a cider-brewing family business.
