"GOLDEN LADY" is a song by Stevie Wonder for the Tamla (Motown) label, from his 1973 _Innervisions_ album. While it was never released as a single, the album itself peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Top 200.[1] The love song, written by Stevie Wonder contrasts with the other songs on the record that comment upon societal issues within America.[2] Examples include his comments on drug addiction within the song "Too High" and his political commentary on US President Richard Nixon in "He's Misstra Know-It-All".[3]

This song is influenced by the montuno style due to the chord progression and syncopated rhythms found within its chorus. He uses this montuno idea at a later date when he releases the song "Don’t You Worry ‘bout a Thing." It also incorporates a picardy third in the ending of the chorus which typically found within Classical music. The piece also noticeably demonstrates some of Wonder's compositional tendencies, including implementation of a line cliche, half step modulations, rhythmic syncopation and sequencing of the melody.
