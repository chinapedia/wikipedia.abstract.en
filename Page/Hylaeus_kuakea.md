_HYLAEUS KUAKEA_ is a species of bee, also known by the common name HAWAIIAN YELLOW-FACED BEE.[1] It is endemic to Hawaii and known from only two populations.[2] In September 2016, _H. kuakea_ and six other Hawaiian _Hylaeus_ species[3] were listed for protection under the United States Endangered Species Act. This marked a first listing for any bee species in the US.[4]


Description

_Hylaeus kuakea_ is small and colored black. Its wings have a somewhat smoky color. While it has some facial markings similar to some other _Hylaeus_ species, _H. kuakea_ is distinguished by an ivory-colored marking covering its lower face. These characteristics have been observed in male specimens, females have not yet been collected or observed.[5]


Distribution and habitat

_Hylaeus kuakea_ is currently known only from two patches of lowland forest in the Waianae Mountains on Oahu. Threats to the species include habitat degradation by nonnative animals and plants, predation by nonnative insects, fires and climate change.[6]
