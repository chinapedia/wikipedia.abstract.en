NGC 5634 is a globular cluster in the constellation Virgo (constellation), located about 82,000 light years (27 kiloparsecs) away.[1] NGC 5634 has an apparent magnitude of about 10[2] and a diameter of 4 or 5 arcminutes.[3] Its Shapleyâ€“Sawyer Concentration Class is IV,[4] meaning the cluster shows intermediate rich concentrations. with stars 19th magnitude. The star on near the upper right is the eleventh-magnitude UCAC2 29844847. There is also a bright orange giant, HD 127119, about 1.3 arcminutes away from the cluster.

NGC 5634 was likely a member of the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.[5] The galaxy itself is being pulled apart by tidal forces from the Milky Way, similar to how NGC 5634 was pulled from the Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
