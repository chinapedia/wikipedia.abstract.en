Controversies

Al Rabban was implicated in the 2012 Villaggio Mall Fire incident. This mall fire occurred in the Villaggio Mall, killing 19 people, 13 of which were children. Though the fire started in the Nike store, it caused the most damage in Gympanzee daycare center. During the investigation of the incident, the daycare center was discovered to be operating without acquiring the obligatory licensing as a nursery by the ministry of social affairs. Thus, the daycare did not meet the required safety conditions, and could have prevented the casualties had this not been the case. The investigation blamed the May 2012 fire and its damages on "lack of adherence to laws, systems and measures by all concerned parties to different degrees." [17] The owners involved were charged in Qatar, and the prosecution argued that the defendants did not comply with the necessary health and safety requirements, and that it was not licensed to operate.[18]

In 2013, Al Rabban was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter due to negligence, and was sentenced to six years in prison.[19] In his closing statement of the case, which lasted 5 hours, Al Rabban’s defense attorney stated that his client did not have any ownership of the mall, despite his clear shareholder ties to the property.[20] Additionally, the defense lawyers questioned why no one from the U.S. sports firm, Nike, was charged in the appeals hearing, as the fire originated from their store in the mall.[21] Al Rabban was cleared of his charges later on, and the court deferred his sentence his company, the Qatari Company for Real Estate and Commercial Projects.[22] In Al Rabban’s retrial in April 2016, he did not appear in court, and his lawyer notified the court that his absence was due to him travelling.[23]

Another controversy that occurred in Al Rabban’s Landmark complex was his decision to remove the Christmas tree from the premise in 2008. It is unclear whether he threw it away or he chose not to feature it during the holiday season. Nonetheless, he received praise from many religious fundamentalists for his dedication to Allah’s work, and for ‘getting rid of evil’ in the country.[24]

Additionally, Al Rabban is married to the niece of Sheikh Thani bin Abdullah al-Thani, a member of Qatar’s ruling family, the chairman and managing director of Ezdan Real Estate, the head of Tadawul Holding Group’s board, and the founder of Qatari charity RAF.[25][26][27][28] Al-Thani’s $16 billion worth real estate firm is the largest in the MENA region in regards to its market capitalization. His holding company has accumulated capital of over $7.5 billion. He is also a large contributor and leader for prominent Islamic banks in Qatar, including the International Islamic Bank, Qatar Islamic Bank, and Masraf Al Rayan.[29] Al Thani’s charity, a semi-official Qatari government charity has been associated with terrorist organizations and terror financing.[30] In one instance, Shafi Al Ajmi, a designated Al Nusra terrorist financier who boasted of receiving funds to prepare mujahedeen in Syria, asked donors to send money to RAF charity.[31]
