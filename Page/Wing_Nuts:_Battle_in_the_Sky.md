WING NUTS: BATTLE IN THE SKY is a game published by BMG Interactive Enterainment and developed by Rocket Science Games for MS-DOS systems in 1995.


Gameplay

The game is told by FMV cutscenes. It is an FMV rail shooter, like Loadstar, but in 2 missions the player must use bombs and balloons to destroy a bridge.[1]


Plot

The game is set in 1914. The player character is a young pilot whose base was attacked by Germans, out of the blue. To find the source of the planes, he shoots any German planes in sight.[2]


Development

In early 1995, Rocket Science Games' Mike Backes noted that the company was working on a fighter aircraft title set during World War I. He told _Wired_ at the time, "The nice thing about Rocket Science is that we developed all these nifty graphics and great production resources, and now we're starting to look at how storytelling can change."[3] Following the commercial failure of its early action-oriented titles, the developer restructured to focus primarily on the adventure game _Obsidian_, and cancelled several other projects in development. However, company head Peter Barrett confirmed in July that "we still have _Wing Nuts_, a World War I dogfight game, in the works" despite these new plans.[4]


Reception

In 1997, Jeff Sengstack of _NewMedia_ wrote that _Wing Nuts_ "bombed miserably." Its sales by that point were below 20,000 units. He blamed this poor performance on the low quality of the game, which he described as "heavy on eye candy and devoid of game play."[5]

A reviewer for _Next Generation_ described _Wing Nuts_ as "a basic rail-type shooter ... with humor making up for the lack of gameplay." He compared the game to _Loadstar: The Legend of Tully Bodine_, and gave it three out of five stars.[6]
