_OOPERIPATUS CENTUNCULUS_ is a species of velvet worm in the Peripatopsidae family.[1][2]


Taxonomy

_Ooperipatus centunculus_ was described by Reid in 1996, from specimens collected on Mount Donna Buang, Victoria, Australia. The specific name _centunculus_ means cloth of many colours, and refers to this species' striking and variable colouration.[3]


Description

Dorsal colouration is variable and may be tan, greyish blue, olive green, or umber brown. A series of pale diamonds extend across the midline, often surrounded by a darker border. The ventral surface is mottled tan and dark grey. Males have a mean body length of approximately 1.25 mm; females 1.45 mm. The species has been found in coiled _Eucalyptus_ bark and _Lophozonia cunninghamii_ litter. Individuals usually remain flat when disturbed and do not coil.[4]
