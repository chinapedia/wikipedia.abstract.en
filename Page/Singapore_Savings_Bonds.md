SINGAPORE SAVINGS BONDS (SSBs) are a type of Singapore Government Securities that are issued for Singaporeans who want to participate in the Singapore Government Securities (SGSs) market but in smaller denominations.[1][2][3]


Features

SSBs can be purchased in multiples of $500 and comes with 10 year tenure. They are issued monthly and their yield is comparable to SGSs with a similar tenure at the point of issue. Interest on SSBs come with a step-up component each year to encourage investors to hold SSBs for a longer period. Investors are restricted to a maximum holding of $100,000 worth of SSBs at any point of time and $50,000 purchase in an issue.


Risk-Free Investment

SSBs are not transferable but can be resold to the Singapore Government at any point of time with the capital guaranteed. This ensures that investors will only have upside for their investment since they can collect interest regularly and yet redeem their bonds at any point of time.


Alternative to Singapore Fixed Deposits

SSBs are seen as alternatives to Singapore fixed deposits which are offered by banks or finance companies. This is due to the fact that before SSBs were issued, most Singaporeans have no access to the SGS market due to the high minimum denominations and preference for institutional investors. Hence, fixed deposits became the preferred choice for Singaporeans to store their savings as they offer relatively higher interest rates as compared to an average savings account and yet are covered by Singapore's Deposit Insurance up to a maximum of $50,000 for each bank or finance company.

The yields of SSBs are usually lower than the interest rates for Singapore fixed deposits for short holding periods but higher than the interest rates for Singapore fixed deposits for longer holder periods assuming depositors renew their fixed deposits at the current interest rates every time their tenure is up. It is also noted that yields of SSBs and fixed deposit interest rates are highly correlated and usually move in the same direction.
