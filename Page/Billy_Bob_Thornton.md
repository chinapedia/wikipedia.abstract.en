BILLY BOB THORNTON (born August 4, 1955) is an American actor, comedian, filmmaker, singer, songwriter, and musician.

Thornton had his first break when he co-wrote and starred in the 1992 thriller _One False Move_, and received international attention after writing, directing, and starring in the independent drama film _Sling Blade_ (1996), for which he won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. He appeared in several major film roles in the 1990s following _Sling Blade_, including Oliver Stone's neo-noir _U Turn_ (1997), political drama _Primary Colors_ (1998), science fiction disaster film _Armageddon_ (1998), the highest-grossing film of that year, and the crime drama _A Simple Plan_ (1998), which earned him his third Oscar nomination.

In the 2000s, Thornton achieved further success in starring dramas _Monster's Ball_ (2001), _The Man Who Wasn't There_ (2001), and _Friday Night Lights_ (2004); comedies _Bandits_ (2001), _Intolerable Cruelty_ (2003), and _Bad Santa_ (2003); and action films _Eagle Eye_ (2008) and _Faster_ (2010). In 2014, Thornton starred as Lorne Malvo in the first season of the anthology series _Fargo_, earning a nomination for the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or TV Movie at the Emmy Awards and won Best Actor in a Miniseries or TV Film at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards. In 2016, he starred in an Amazon original series, _Goliath,_ which earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama.

Thornton has been vocal about his distaste for celebrity culture, choosing to keep his life out of the public eye. However, the attention of the media has proven unavoidable in certain cases, his marriage to Angelina Jolie being a notable example.[1] Thornton has written a variety of films, usually set in the Southern United States and mainly co-written with Tom Epperson, including _A Family Thing_ (1996) and _The Gift_ (2000). After _Sling Blade_, he directed several other films, including _Daddy and Them_ (2001), _All the Pretty Horses_ (2000), and _Jayne Mansfield's Car_ (2012).

Thornton has received the President's Award from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, a Special Achievement Award from the National Board of Review, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has also been nominated for an Emmy Award, four Golden Globes, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards. In addition to film work, Thornton began a career as a singer-songwriter. He has released four solo albums and is the vocalist of the blues rock band The Boxmasters.


Early life

Billy Bob Thornton[2][3] was born on August 4, 1955,[4] in Hot Springs, Arkansas,[5][6][7] the son of Virginia Roberta (_née_ Faulkner; died July 29, 2017), a self-proclaimed psychic, and William Raymond "Billy Ray" Thornton (November 1929 – August 1974), a high school history teacher and basketball coach.[8] His brother, Jimmy Don (April 1958 – October 1988), wrote a number of songs, two of which ("Island Avenue" and "Emily") Thornton has recorded on his solo albums.[9] He is of part Irish descent.[10] He also has another brother John David Thornton.

Thornton lived in numerous places in Arkansas during his childhood, including Alpine, Malvern, and Mount Holly. He was raised Methodist[11] in an extended family in a shack that had no electricity or plumbing.[12] He graduated from Malvern High School in 1973. A good high school baseball player, he tried out for the Kansas City Royals, but was released after an injury.[13] After a short period laying asphalt for the Arkansas State Transportation Department, he attended Henderson State University to pursue studies in psychology, but dropped out after two semesters.[14]

In the mid-1980s, Thornton settled in Los Angeles, California, to pursue his career as an actor, with future writing partner Tom Epperson.[15] He had a difficult time succeeding as an actor and worked in telemarketing, offshore wind farming,[16] and fast food management between auditioning for acting jobs. He also played the drums and sang with South African rock band Jack Hammer. While working as a waiter for an industry event, he served film director and screenwriter Billy Wilder. He struck up a conversation with Wilder, who advised Thornton to consider a career as a screenwriter.[17]


Career

Acting and filmmaking

BillyBobThorntonPointsSXSW2009_(cropped).jpg in Austin, Texas, on March 11, 2008]] Thornton's first screen role was in 1980's _South of Reno_, where he played a small role as a counter man in a restaurant. He also made an appearance as a pawn store clerk in the 1987 _Matlock_ episode "The Photographer". Another one of his early screen roles was as a cast member on the CBS sitcom Hearts Afire and in 1989 he appeared as a angry heckler in Adam Sandler's debut film _Going Overboard_. His role as the villain in 1992's _One False Move_, which he also co-wrote, brought him to the attention of critics. He also had small roles in the 1990s films _Indecent Proposal_, _On Deadly Ground_, _Bound by Honor_, and _Tombstone_. He went on to write, direct, and star in the 1996 independent film _Sling Blade_.[18] The film, an expansion of the short film _Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade_, introduced the story of a mentally handicapped man imprisoned for a gruesome and seemingly inexplicable murder.

_Sling Blade_ garnered international acclaim. Thornton's screenplay earned him an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, a Writers Guild of America Award, and an Edgar Award, while his performance received Oscar and Screen Actors Guild nominations for Best Actor.[19] In 1998, Thornton portrayed the James Carville-like Richard Jemmons in _Primary Colors_. He adapted the book _All the Pretty Horses_ into a 2000 film of the same name. The negative experience (he was forced to cut more than an hour of footage) led to his decision to never direct another film; a subsequent release, _Daddy and Them_, had been filmed earlier. Also in 2000, an early script which he and Tom Epperson wrote together was made into _The Gift_.

In 2000, Thornton appeared in Travis Tritt's music video for the song "Modern Day Bonnie and Clyde". His screen persona has been described by the press as that of a "tattooed, hirsute man's man".[20] He appeared in several major film roles following the success of _Sling Blade_, including 1998's _Armageddon_ and _A Simple Plan_. In 2001, he directed _Daddy and Them_ while securing starring roles in three Hollywood films: _Monster's Ball_, _Bandits_, and _The Man Who Wasn't There_, for which he received many awards.

Thornton played a malicious mall Santa in 2003's _Bad Santa_, a black comedy that performed well at the box office and established him as a leading comic actor, and in the same year, portrayed a womanizing President of the United States in the British romantic comedy film _Love Actually_. He stated that, following the success of _Bad Santa_, audiences "like to watch him play that kind of guy" and that "casting directors call him up when they need an asshole".[21] He referred to this when he said that "it's kinda that simple... you know how narrow the imagination in this business can be".[22]

In 2004, Thornton played David Crockett in _The Alamo_. Later that year, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on October 7. He appeared in the 2006 comic film _School for Scoundrels_. In the film, he plays a self-help doctor, which was written specifically for him.[23] More recent films include 2007 drama _The Astronaut Farmer_ and the comedy _Mr. Woodcock_, in which he played a sadistic gym teacher. In September 2008, he starred in the action film _Eagle Eye_. He has also expressed an interest in directing another film, possibly a period piece about cave explorer Floyd Collins,[24] based on the book _Trapped! The Story of Floyd Collins_.[25]

In 2014, Thornton starred as sociopathic hitman Lorne Malvo in the FX miniseries _Fargo_, based on the 1996 film of the same name, for which he won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Mini-Series.[26]

On October 30, 2014, on _The Big Bang Theory_, he played a middle-aged urologist who gets excited about every woman who touches him. He showed the boys his collection of film memorabilia.

"Goliath", a television series by Amazon Studios, features Thornton as a formerly brilliant and personable lawyer - now washed out and alcoholic. It premiered on October 13, 2016, on Amazon Video. On February 15, 2017, Amazon announced the series had been renewed for a second season.[27]

In 2017, Thornton starred in the music video _Stand Down_[28] by Kario Salem (musically known as K.O.). It received the award Best Music Video in the Toronto Shorts International Film Festival[29] and has 13 million views on Facebook and counting.

Music

From the time he was 10 years old, Thornton has been in bands. His first performance was on drums at a school PTA meeting where his band played "The Ballad of The Green Berets" instrumentally. Several bands followed, with Thornton's first recording experience coming at Widget Sound in Muscle Shoals, Alabama in 1974. Later in the 1970s, Thornton was the drummer of a blues rock band named _Tres Hombres_. Guitarist Billy Gibbons referred to the band as "The best little cover band in Texas", and Thornton bears a tattoo with the band's name on it.[30]BillyBobThornton.jpg, 2007]]

In 1985, Thornton joined Piet Botha in the South African rock band Jack Hammer, while Botha worked in Los Angeles. Thornton recorded one studio album with Jack Hammer, Death of a Gypsy, which was released in 1986.

In 2001, Thornton released an album titled _Private Radio_ on Lost Highway Records. _The Edge of the World_ (2003), _Hobo_ (2005) and _Beautiful Door_ (2007).

Personal life

Relationships and children

Billy_Bob_Thornton.jpg, 2007]] Thornton has been married six times, with the first five marriages ending in divorce, and he has four children by three women. From 1978 to 1980, he was married to Melissa Lee Gatlin, who in her divorce cited “incompatibility and adultery on his part” and with whom he had a daughter, Amanda (Brumfield),[33] who in 2008 was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the death of her friend's 1-year-old daughter.[34] Thornton married actress Toni Lawrence in 1986; they separated the following year and divorced in 1988. From 1990 to 1992, he was married to actress Cynda Williams, whom he cast in his writing debut, _One False Move_ (1992). In 1993, Thornton married _Playboy_ model Pietra Dawn Cherniak, with whom he had two sons, Harry James and William; the marriage ended in 1997, with Cherniak accusing Thornton of spousal abuse, sometimes in front of his children.[35][36]

Thornton was engaged to be married to actress Laura Dern, whom he dated from 1997 to 1999, but in 2000, he married actress Angelina Jolie, with whom he starred in _Pushing Tin_ (1999) and who was 20 years his junior. The marriage became known for the couple's eccentric displays of affection, which reportedly included wearing vials of each other's blood around their necks; Thornton later clarified that the "vials" were actually two small lockets, each containing only a single drop of blood.[37][38] Thornton and Jolie announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but it was later revealed that Jolie had adopted the child as a single parent.[39][40] They separated in June 2002 and divorced the following year.[41]

In 2003, Thornton began a relationship with makeup effects crew member Connie Angland, with whom he has a daughter named Bella. They reside in Los Angeles, California. Though he once said that he likely would not marry again,[42] saying that he believes marriage "doesn't work" for him,[43] his representatives confirmed that he and Angland were married on October 22, 2014, in Los Angeles.[44]

Health problems

During his early years in Los Angeles, Thornton was admitted to a hospital and diagnosed with myocarditis.[45] He has since said that he follows a vegan diet and is "extremely healthy", eating no junk food as he is allergic to wheat and dairy.[46]

Thornton suffers from OCD.[47] Various idiosyncratic behaviors have been well documented in interviews with Thornton; among these is a phobia of antique furniture, a disorder shared by Dwight Yoakam's character Doyle Hargraves in the Thornton-penned _Sling Blade_ and by Thornton's own character in the 2001 film _Bandits_.[48] Additionally, he has stated that he has a fear of certain types of silverware, a trait assumed by his character in 2001's _Monster's Ball_, in which Grotowski insists on a plastic spoon for his daily bowl of ice cream.[49][50]

In a 2004 interview with _The Independent_, Thornton explained, "It's just that I won't use real silver. You know, like the big, old, heavy-ass forks and knives, I can't do that. It's the same thing as the antique furniture. I just don't like old stuff. I'm creeped out by it, and I have no explanation why ... I don't have a phobia about American antiques, it's mostly French—you know, like the big, old, gold-carved chairs with the velvet cushions. The Louis XIV type. That's what creeps me out. I can spot the imitation antiques a mile off. They have a different vibe. Not as much dust."[51]

Other

Thornton is a baseball fan; his favorite team is the St. Louis Cardinals, and he has said that his childhood dream was to play for them. He narrated _The 2006 World Series Film_, the year-end retrospective DVD chronicling the Cardinals' championship season. He is also a professed fan of the Indianapolis Colts football team.[52]
