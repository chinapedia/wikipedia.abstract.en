CLOUDBRIC is a cloud-based web security provider based in Seoul, South Korea. It offers a WAF, DDoS protection, and SSL solution and protects websites from SQL injection, cross-site scripting, identity theft, website defacement, and application layer DDoS attacks.


History

In early 2015, Cloudbric launched as an in-house venture of Penta Security Systems Inc. with the idea of creating a cloud web security service/web application firewall accessible to all.[1]What first started as an in-house project grew to a global service, and on December 1, 2017, Cloudbric Corporation became its own company. At the time of the spin-off, Cloudbric had acquired 27 IDCs (Internet Data Centers), 50 partnerships, and 8,000 user sign-ups.

In November 2017, Cloudbric launched Cloudbric Labs, a collection of free web security resources and services, available for use and integration for all users across the web. It currently consists of BlackIPedia (an IP reputation service), Threat Index (a database of web vulnerabilities), and WAFER (a WAF evaluator that tests for performance and accuracy).[2]

In May 2018, Cloudbric unveiled plans to launch a reverse ICO initiative. With a working product, Cloudbric plans to build on its web security offerings through the introduction of a decentralized, user-led security platform.[3]


Components

Cloudbric’s pricing model is based on monthly website traffic rather than premium service features, meaning all users have access to Cloudbric’s comprehensive suite of web security services by default. Cloudbric’s WAF operates as a proxy to detect and filter malicious attacks, requiring its customers to change their website's Domain Name System (DNS).

-   WAF – Protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and more; uses a logic-based detection engine[4]
-   DDoS Protection – Layer 3, 4 and 7 DDoS protection
-   SSL – Free SSL to all users, ensuring secure web communication between the web and web server
