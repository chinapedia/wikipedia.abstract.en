CD-R KING (styled as CD-R KING or CD-R KING) is a Filipino retail chain that sells discounted computer parts and gadgets, electronic appliances, and accessories.[1][2][3] CD-R King's branches are often located in malls, where they compete against higher-end electronics retailers.[4][5]


History

CD-R King has initially been known for selling recordable media in bulk at a fraction of the cost since the early 2000s, but has since expanded their line to other products in response to changing market and technological trends over the years, even going so far as to offering goods which have little or nothing to do with optical media or information technology in general, (e.g. ornaments and other such accessories; this prompted the introduction of their branding divisions like STARK for appliances, California ECO-BIKE for electric bicycles,[6] Mobile King for cell phones, and Kenko World for their cell phone accessories and health and beauty products). Most of CD-R King's products are sourced from original design manufacturers from China, Taiwan and other countries, and are sold under their own brand. Many CD-R King-branded products are re-branded versions of the same or similar products sold in parallel by their manufacturers.

It since became the popular gadget store in Metro Manila and spread out to Luzon, then to Cebu City, and later has branches nationwide with more than 350 branches (excluding Kenko World branches) in all major shopping mall chains in the country.

Copyright concerns

The company's operations gained controversy as the Optical Media Board accused CD-R King in 2008 of facilitating copyright infringement through inexpensive media supplied by the company,[7][8] imposing a P1.5 million penalty for failing to produce permits for some of its optical media disc importations.[9]

In 2013, Globe Telecom has signed agreements with several major retailers of gadgets and IT equipment, including CD-R King, in a bid to curb the sale of illegal repeaters or signal boosters in the country. The agreement binds retailers from selling signal boosters that do not comply with the specifications set by the National Telecommunications Commission.[10]


Products

Aside from optical storage media, they also sell cellular phones, electronic gadgets, accessories, appliances, electric bicycles[11] and even health and beauty products.[12]
