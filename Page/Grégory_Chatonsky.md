GRÉGORY CHATONSKY (May 4, 1971) is a French and Canadian Artist who works with interactive installations, networked devices, photographs and sculptures. He explores the relationship between technologies and affectivity creating new forms of fiction.


Early life and education

After completing studies in Visual Arts and Philosophy at La Sorbonne Pantheon-Sorbonne University, Grégory Chatonsky began his master's degree at the ENSBA and at ENST finishing in 1999. In March 2016 he was awarded his PhD from Université du Québec à Montréal for his dissertation: _Esthétique des flux (après le numérique)_.


Work

Grégory Chatonsky is one of the early practitioners of Internet art having founded in 1994 (with Karen Dermineur) incident.net, an Internet art collective exploring the notions of the accidental, the glitch and unpredictability. During this early period of internet he created the website of _Centre Georges Pompidou_. From 1994 to 1997, Chatonsky, researched, wrote the screenplay and produced the CD-ROM, _Mémoires de la Déportation_, about deportations and the Holocaust in France.[1] From the mid-nineties Chatonsky produced films, audios and code-based work for the internet, including _Counter_ (1995), a website that existed solely to count visitors, _2fresh_ (1997), a snippit of HTML script, and _La Vitesse du Silence_ (1999), a netart performance piece.

Produced at the _C³ Center for Culture & Communication Foundation_ (with Reynald Drouhin) and at _Biennale d’art contemporain de Montréal_, _Revenances_ (1999) was an online performance work that invited the viewer to slow down their browsing and consider glitches and pauses as spaces where "ghosts" may interact.[2]

Chatonsky divides his time between France and Canada. He has taught at Le Fresnoy-Studio national des arts contemporains, France, at Université du Québec à Montréal’s School of visual and media art and he is artist-researcher at École Normale Supérieure in Paris on artificial imagination.
