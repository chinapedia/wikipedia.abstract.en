DECODOKU is set of online citizen science games, based on quantum error correction.[1] The project is supported by the NCCR QSIT[2] and the University of Basel, and allows the public to get involved with quantum error correction research.[3][4]

The games present the clues left in a quantum computer when errors occur, and encourage the players to work out how best to correct them. These puzzles are presented in a manner similar to typical casual puzzle games, like 2048, Threes or Sudoku,[5] with the scientific background explained via the project website and YouTube channel.[6] Thus far three games have been released: Decodoku, Decodoku:Puzzles and Decodoku:Colors.
