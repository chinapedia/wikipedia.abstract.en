J. KEITH JOUNG is an American pathologist and molecular biologist who is the Desmond and Ann Heathwood Research Scholar at Massachusetts General Hospital and a Professor of Pathology at Harvard Medical School.[1] He is a leading figure in the field of genome editing and has pioneered the development of designer nucleases and sensitive off-target detection methods.[2]


Education

In 1987, Joung graduated from Harvard College with a bachelor's degree in biochemical sciences.[3] He received an M.D. from Harvard Medical School and a Ph.D. in genetics from Harvard University.[4]


Career

Joung is most well known for his work in genome editing and has contributed to the development of designer nucleases through protein engineering and assays for off-target detection.[5][6][7] In the mid-2000s, Joung's research was focused on creating zinc finger nuclease tools for biological research and gene therapy.[8] He was the leader and founder of the Zinc Finger Consortium and co-authored a study on Oligomerized Pool Engineering (OPEN), a publicly available strategy for rapidly constructing multi-finger arrays.[9][10]

More recently, Joung has contributed to the development of TAL effector, TALENs, and the RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 system. In addition to demonstrating the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in vivo through the zebrafish model,[11] Joung has pioneered the creation of tools such as GUIDE-seq and CIRCLE-seq to detect nuclease off-targets within the genome.[12][13] In 2016, his group became one of the first to report engineered high-fidelity CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases (HF1) with no detectable off-target effects.[14]

Joung is also one of the scientific co-founders of Editas Medicine, along with Jennifer Doudna, Feng Zhang, George Church, and David Liu.[15]
