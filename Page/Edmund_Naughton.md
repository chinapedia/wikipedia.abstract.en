EDMUND NAUGHTON (1926–2013) was an American writer and journalist whose first novel, _McCabe_ (1959), was the basis for the 1971 film _McCabe & Mrs. Miller_. The film, directed by Robert Altman, is now considered a masterpiece. After 1958, Naughton lived in France and England. Between 1959 and 1984, Naughton published six novels in the genres of westerns and of crime fiction. The first two were published in French translation as well as English; the last two were published only in translation.

Naughton was born and raised in New York City and educated in Catholic schools. He received a bachelor's degree from Boston College in 1948,[1] and an M.F.A. degree from Fordham University in 1953. He then became a police reporter for _The Courier-Journal_ in Louisville, Kentucky.[2] As described in a short biographical notice, "he stayed for 5 years on the police beat, which he worked down to an average of an hour & a half's work per day. The rest of the time he spent playing cards and drinking beer with policemen. Once he went on an actual manhunt with them. He wrote _McCabe_ in 1957-1958, largely out of his experience on the police beat, transposing his characters to the West." In 1958 Naughton moved to Paris, France, where he worked for the _International Herald Tribune_, _The New York Times_, and as an English teacher.[3]

_McCabe_, which had been well-reviewed by Nelson C. Nye in _The New York Times_,[4] was translated into French as _La Belle Main_ in 1960,[5] and into German as _Keine Chance für McCabe_ in 1966.[6] He published his second novel, _The Pardner_, in 1971, which was also promptly translated into French (as _Oh! collègue_).[7][8] In association with the 1971 film based on it, _McCabe_ was published in new editions and a new translation into Italian (_I Compari_). The novel was last reprinted as a mass market paperback in 1992.[9]

Naughton published four more novels. _A Case in Madrid_ was published in 1973 and _The Maximum Game_ in 1975.[10][11] Two more novels appeared only in French translation: _Les Cow-boys dehors!_ (1982 - _Wild Horses_) and _Grand Noir et le petit Blanc_ (1984 - _White Man, Black Man_).[12][13] French critic included Naughton in the _Dictionnaire des littératures policières_ (lit. _Dictionary of Crime Literature_). Mesplède writes that Naughton lost his job as a journalist in Louisville following public revelations that he was homosexual, and that this episode motivated his emigration from the United States to Europe.[14]


Film adaptation of _McCabe_

The adaptation of Naughton's novel for the film _McCabe & Mrs. Miller_ gave him wide recognition; the film is considered a masterpiece by prominent critics, and was entered into the U.S. National Film Registry in 2010.[15][16][17][18][19] The story of the adaptation has been told by several film historians.[20][21][22] The rights to _McCabe_ were purchased in 1968 by producer David Foster through Naughton's agent in Paris, Ellen Wright.

Ben Maddow was hired to write a screenplay based on the novel, and there are two versions of his work in the archives of the Margaret Herrick Library. Maddow had made substantial changes to the plot of the novel.[23] In October 1969 Robert Altman had been signed to direct a film adaptation of the novel. Brian McKay was hired to write a second, independent screenplay. A later "shooting screenplay" is available in archives.[24] Only McKay and Altman were listed as screenwriters in the film's credits. Critic Matthew Dessem has compared the actual film with the Maddow and McKay screenplays and with Naughton's novel. Dessem concludes that the structure of the final film is reasonably faithful to Naughton's original novel.[25]
