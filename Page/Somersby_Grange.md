Manor_House,_Somersby_-_geograph.org.uk_-_577346.jpg SOMERSBY GRANGE is a Grade I listed Georgian country house in Somersby, Lincolnshire.[1]

The house was built in 1722 for Robert Burton, the local lord of the manor.[2] It is built in red brick to a rectangular plan with two storeys over a basement and has four square corner towers and a hipped slate roof behind a parapet.[3] The parapet is embattled on the north front above the main entrance, to which a porch was later added.[4] A two-storey extension was added to the east side to provide additional accommodation.[5] Although in the style of Sir John Vanbrugh, the house was probably designed by Robert Alfray.[6]

Adjacent to the house is the rectory, now called Somersby House, where Alfred Lord Tennyson was born and raised.
