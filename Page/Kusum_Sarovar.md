It was constructed by the Jat rulers of the Bharatpur.Maharaja Suraj Mal constructed the sarovar and garden for his queen Kishori Rani.

The building, with cenotaphs of the Bharatpur royal family, was built by Maharaja Jawahir Singh, the king of Bharatpur (1707–1763), in honor of his father MahaRaja Suraj Mall in 1764. Members of his family died during the 18th century fighting the British.[3]

It is named for the Kilakinchita Lila legend about female cow herders (_gopis_) who picked flowers for offerings to the Sun God, Surya Deva for the nearby Surya Deva Temple and met with Krishna and his friend Madhumangala, who vanish and disguise themselves as priests and accept the flowers and sweets at the temple. _Sarovar_ means lake and _kusum_ means flowers.[4]

It is one of the sites of the Krishna forest pilgrimage.[6]

Most imposing chhatri is of Mahara Suraj Mal, flanked on either side by two smaller chhatris of his two wives, _"Maharani Hansiya"_ and _"Maharani Kishori"_.[7] Maharaj Suraj Mal is well known for capturing Red Fort in 1754 CE after defetaing the forces of Mughal king Ahmad Shah Bahadur.[8][9] The architecture and carving is in the pierced stone style and the ceiling of cenotaphs are adorned with the beautiful painting of life of lord Krishna and Maharajs Suraj Mal's court.[10][11]

The principle tomb is 57 square feet in area.[12] On the upper level are three tombs. The main tomb of Maharaja Surajmal has beautiful paintings on its ceiling depicting the pastimes of Krishna and the lotus feet of Krishna engraved on the floor. There are also some paintings of MahaRaja SurajMal in his court. The other tombs are those of his two queens, Kishori and Hansiya.[13] There are beautiful paintings on the ceiling of these two tombs. The lofty terrace upon which they stand is 460 feet in length, with a long shallow pavilion serving as a screen at each end, and nine two-stories kiosks of varying outline to relieve the front. Attached to Rani Hansiya's monument is a smaller one in commemoration of a faithful attendant. Behind is an extensive garden. In front, at the foot of the terrace, below a broad flight of steps, is an artificial lake.[14][15]
