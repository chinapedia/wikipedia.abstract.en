Storylines

Survival of The Fittest (2016) featured professional wrestling matches that involved wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines that played out on ROH's television program, _Ring of Honor Wrestling_. Wrestlers portrayed heroes (faces) or villains (heels) as they followed a series of events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.[3]

Survival of the Fittest is an annual tournament held by ROH. For the 2016 event, the winners from designated tournament matches in Arlington, Texas advanced to a 6-Man Elimination Match the following night in San Antonio, and the winner of that match was declared Survivor of the Fittest, and received a future ROH World Championship match.
