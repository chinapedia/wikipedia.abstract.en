_INVENTING THE INDIAN_ is a 2012 BBC documentary first broadcast on 28 October on BBC 4,[1] exploring the stereotypical view of Native Americans in the United States in cinema and literature.[2]

Presented by Rich Hall and Dallas Goldtooth, a Native American, it uncovers myths about the American Indian and how they live currently. Hall looks at films including _Soldier Blue_, _Stagecoach_ and _A Man Called Horse_, and books including _The Last of the Mohicans_, _Black Elk Speaks_ and _Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee_. It also covered Geronimo and Sitting Bull.[3]


Reception

  Hall tore into the way that white people, such as Kevin Costner, insisted on becoming spokespeople for the pain of Native Americans. As the impassioned and conspicuously white Hall repeated the same sin, Dallas Goldtooth, an activist-comedian from the Dakota tribe, shook his head with mock disapproval. The unstated part of the joke was that Hall is said to be part Cherokee.[4]
