MARIE THÉRÈSE DE NOIRETERRE (1760-1823) was a French miniaturist. She is believed to have been active as a pastellist as well, but only her miniature production is preserved.

She was born in Paris as the niece of the spouse of Claude Bonet. She was a student of Adélaïde Labille-Guiard. She participated in several exhibitions of her miniatures in France and Great Britain.
