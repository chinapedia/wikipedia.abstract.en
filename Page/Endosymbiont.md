Endosymbiosis.PNG]]

An ENDOSYMBIONT or ENDOBIONT[1] is any organism that lives within the body or cells of another organism in a mutualistic relationship with the host body or cell, often but not always to mutual benefit. The term ENDOSYMBIOSIS is from the Greek: ἔνδον _endon_ "within", σύν _syn_ "together" and βίωσις _biosis_ "living"). Examples are nitrogen-fixing bacteria (called rhizobia), which live in root nodules on legume roots, single-cell algae inside reef-building corals, and bacterial endosymbionts that provide essential nutrients to about 10–15% of insects.

There are two types of symbiont transmissions. In horizontal transmission, each new generation acquires free living symbionts from the environment. An example is the nitrogen-fixing bacteria in certain plant roots. Vertical transmission takes place when the symbiont is transferred directly from parent to offspring. There is also a combination of these types, where symbionts are transferred vertically for some generation before a switch of host occurs and new symbions are horizontally acquired from the environment. In vertical transmissions, the symbiont often have a reduced genome and is no longer able to survive on its own. When it enters the new generation depends on the host. In tse-tse flies, it happens during the larval stage, and in some sponges after an eggcell have been fertilized. A symbiont can never evolve into a true organelle before it is present in an individual in all stages of life, instead of being transferred from parent to offspring after the formation of gametes.[2]

Many instances of endosymbiosis are obligate; that is, either the endosymbiont or the host cannot survive without the other, such as the gutless marine worms of the genus _Riftia_, which get nutrition from their endosymbiotic bacteria. The most common examples of obligate endosymbioses are mitochondria and chloroplasts. Some human parasites, e.g. _Wuchereria bancrofti_ and _Mansonella perstans_, thrive in their intermediate insect hosts because of an obligate endosymbiosis with _Wolbachia spp._ They can both be eliminated from said hosts by treatments that target this bacterium. However, not all endosymbioses are obligate and some endosymbioses can be harmful to either of the organisms involved.

Two major types of organelle in eukaryotic cells, mitochondria and plastids such as chloroplasts, originated by symbiogenesis as bacterial endosymbionts.


Bacterial endosymbionts

In phytoplankton

In marine environments, bacterial endosymbionts have more recently been discovered.[3][4][5][6] These endosymbiotic relationships are especially prevalent in oligotrophic or nutrient-poor regions of the ocean like that of the North Atlantic.[7][8][9][10]  In these oligotrophic waters, cell growth of larger phytoplankton like that of diatoms is limited by low nitrate concentrations.[11]  Endosymbiotic bacteria fix nitrogen for their diatom hosts and in turn receive organic carbon from photosynthesis.[12] These symbioses play an important role in global carbon cycling in oligotrophic regions.[13][14][15]

One known symbiosis between the diatom _Hemialus_ spp. and the cyanobacterium _Richelia intracellularis_ has been found in the North Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pacific Ocean.[16][17][18] The _Richelia_ endosymbiont is found within the diatom frustule of _Hemiaulus_ spp., and has a reduced genome likely losing genes related to pathways the host now provides.[19]  Research by Foster et al. (2011) measured nitrogen fixation by the cyanobacterial host _Richelia intracellularis_ well above intracellular requirements, and found the cyanobacterium was likely fixing excess nitrogen for Hemiaulus host cells.[20]  Additionally, both host and symbiont cell growth were much greater than free-living _Richelia intracellularis_ or symbiont-free _Hemiaulus_ spp.[21]  The _Hemaiulus_-_Richelia_ symbiosis is not obligatory especially in areas with excess nitrogen (nitrogen replete).[22]

_Richelia intracellularis_ is also found in _Rhizosolenia_ spp., a diatom found in oligotrophic oceans.[23][24][25] Compared to the _Hemaiulus_ host, the endosymbiosis with _Rhizosolenia_ is much more consistent, and _Richelia intracellularis_ is generally found in _Rhizosolenia_.[26] There are some asymbiotic (occurs without an endosymbiont) Rhizosolenia, however there appears to be mechanisms limiting growth of these organisms in low nutrient conditions.[27] Cell division for both the diatom host and cyanobacterial symbiont can be uncoupled and mechanisms for passing bacterial symbionts to daughter cells during cell division are still relatively unknown.[28]

Other endosymbiosis with nitrogen fixers in open oceans include Calothrix in Chaetocerous spp. and UNCY-A in prymnesiophyte microalga.[29]  The Chaetocerous-Calothrix endosymbiosis is hypothesized to be more recent, as the Calothrix genome is generally intact. While other species like that of the UNCY-A symbiont and Richelia have reduced genomes.[30]  This reduction in genome size occurs within nitrogen metabolism pathways indicating endosymbiont species are generating nitrogen for their hosts and losing the ability to use this nitrogen independently.[31] This endosymbiont reduction in genome size, might be a step that occurred in the evolution of organelles (above).[32]

In marine invertebrates

Extracellular endosymbionts are also represented in all four extant classes of Echinodermata (Crinoidea, Ophiuroidea, Echinoidea, and Holothuroidea). Little is known of the nature of the association (mode of infection, transmission, metabolic requirements, etc.) but phylogenetic analysis indicates that these symbionts belong to the alpha group of the class Proteobacteria, relating them to _Rhizobium_ and _Thiobacillus_. Other studies indicate that these subcuticular bacteria may be both abundant within their hosts and widely distributed among the Echinoderms in general.[33]

Some marine oligochaeta (e.g., _Olavius algarvensis_ and _Inanidrillus spp._) have obligate extracellular endosymbionts that fill the entire body of their host. These marine worms are nutritionally dependent on their symbiotic chemoautotrophic bacteria lacking any digestive or excretory system (no gut, mouth, or nephridia).[34]

The sea slug _Elysia chlorotica_ lives in endosymbiotic relationship with the algae _Vaucheria litorea_, and the jellyfish _Mastigias_ have a similar relationship with an algae.

In vertebrates

The spotted salamander (_Ambystoma maculatum_) lives in a relationship with the algae _Oophila amblystomatis_, which grows in the egg cases.[35]

In plants

Of all the plants, _Azolla_ has the most intimate relationship with a symbiont, as the cyanobacterium is passed on directly from one generation to the next.[36]

In protists

_Mixotricha paradoxa_ is a protozoan that lacks mitochondria. However, spherical bacteria live inside the cell and serve the function of the mitochondria. _Mixotricha_ also has three other species of symbionts that live on the surface of the cell.

_Paramecium bursaria_, a species of ciliate, has a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with green alga called Zoochlorella. The algae live inside the cell, in the cytoplasm.

_Paulinella chromatophora_ is a freshwater amoeboid which has recently (evolutionarily speaking) taken on a cyanobacterium as an endosymbiont.

Many foraminifera are hosts to several types of algae, such as red algae, diatoms, dinoflagellates and chlorophyta.[37] These endosymbionts can be transmitted vertically to the next generation via asexual reproduction of the host, but because the endosymbionts are larger than the foraminiferal gametes, they need to acquire new algae again after sexual reproduction.[38]

Several species of radiolaria have photosynthetic symbionts. In some species the host will sometimes digest algae to keep their population at a constant level.[39]

In 1966, biologist Kwang W. Jeon found that a lab strain of Amoeba proteus had been infected by bacteria that lived inside the cytoplasmic vacuoles. This infection killed all the protists except from a few individuals. After the equivalent of 40 host generations, the two organisms gradually became mutually interdependent. Over many years of study, it has been confirmed that a genetic exchenge between the prokaryotes and protists has occurred.[40][41]

In insects

Scientists classify insect endosymbionts in two broad categories, 'Primary' and 'Secondary'. Primary endosymbionts (sometimes referred to as P-endosymbionts) have been associated with their insect hosts for many millions of years (from 10 to several hundred million years in some cases). They form obligate associations (see below), and display cospeciation with their insect hosts. Secondary endosymbionts exhibit a more recently developed association, are sometimes horizontally transferred between hosts, live in the hemolymph of the insects (not specialized bacteriocytes, see below), and are not obligate.[42]

Among primary endosymbionts of insects, the best-studied are the pea aphid (_Acyrthosiphon pisum_) and its endosymbiont _Buchnera sp._ APS,[43][44][45] the tsetse fly _Glossina morsitans morsitans_ and its endosymbiont _Wigglesworthia glossinidia brevipalpis_ and the endosymbiotic protists in lower termites. As with endosymbiosis in other insects, the symbiosis is obligate in that neither the bacteria nor the insect is viable without the other. Scientists have been unable to cultivate the bacteria in lab conditions outside of the insect. With special nutritionally-enhanced diets, the insects can survive, but are unhealthy, and at best survive only a few generations.

In some insect groups, these endosymbionts live in specialized insect cells called bacteriocytes (also called _mycetocytes_), and are maternally-transmitted, i.e. the mother transmits her endosymbionts to her offspring. In some cases, the bacteria are transmitted in the egg, as in _Buchnera_; in others like _Wigglesworthia_, they are transmitted via milk to the developing insect embryo. In termites, the endosymbionts reside within the hindguts and are transmitted through trophallaxis among colony members.

The primary endosymbionts are thought to help the host either by providing nutrients that the host cannot obtain itself or by metabolizing insect waste products into safer forms. For example, the putative primary role of _Buchnera_ is to synthesize essential amino acids that the aphid cannot acquire from its natural diet of plant sap. Likewise, the primary role of _Wigglesworthia_, it is presumed, is to synthesize vitamins that the tsetse fly does not get from the blood that it eats. In lower termites, the endosymbiotic protists play a major role in the digestion of lignocellulosic materials that constitute a bulk of the termites' diet.

Bacteria benefit from the reduced exposure to predators and competition from other bacterial species, the ample supply of nutrients and relative environmental stability inside the host.

Genome sequencing reveals that obligate bacterial endosymbionts of insects have among the smallest of known bacterial genomes and have lost many genes that are commonly found in closely related bacteria. Several theories have been put forth to explain the loss of genes. It is presumed that some of these genes are not needed in the environment of the host insect cell. A complementary theory suggests that the relatively small numbers of bacteria inside each insect decrease the efficiency of natural selection in 'purging' deleterious mutations and small mutations from the population, resulting in a loss of genes over many millions of years. Research in which a parallel phylogeny of bacteria and insects was inferred supports the belief that the primary endosymbionts are transferred only vertically (i.e., from the mother), and not horizontally (i.e., by escaping the host and entering a new host).[46][47][48]

Attacking obligate bacterial endosymbionts may present a way to control their insect hosts, many of which pests or carriers of human disease. For example, aphids are crop pests and the tsetse fly carries the organism _Trypanosoma brucei_ that causes African sleeping sickness.[49] Other motivations for their study is to understand symbiosis, and to understand how bacteria with severely depleted genomes are able to survive, thus improving our knowledge of genetics and molecular biology.

Less is known about secondary endosymbionts. The pea aphid (_Acyrthosiphon pisum_) is known to contain at least three secondary endosymbionts, _Hamiltonella defensa_, _Regiella insecticola_, and _Serratia symbiotica_. _H. defensa_ aids in defending the insect from parasitoids. _Sodalis glossinidius_ is a secondary endosymbiont of tsetse flies that lives inter- and intracellularly in various host tissues, including the midgut and hemolymph. Phylogenetic studies have not indicated a correlation between evolution of _Sodalis_ and tsetse.[50] Unlike tsetse's P-symbiont _Wigglesworthia_, though, _Sodalis_ has been cultured _in vitro_.[51]


Dinoflagellate endosymbionts

Dinoflagellate endosymbionts of the genus _Symbiodinium_, commonly known as zooxanthellae, are found in corals, mollusks (esp. giant clams, the _Tridacna_), sponges, and foraminifera. These endosymbionts drive the formation of coral reefs by capturing sunlight and providing their hosts with energy for carbonate deposition.[52]

Previously thought to be a single species, molecular phylogenetic evidence over the past couple decades has shown there to be great diversity in _Symbiodinium_. In some cases, there is specificity between host and _Symbiodinium_ clade. More often, however, there is an ecological distribution of _Symbiodinium_, the symbionts switching between hosts with apparent ease. When reefs become environmentally stressed, this distribution of symbionts is related to the observed pattern of coral bleaching and recovery. Thus, the distribution of _Symbiodinium_ on coral reefs and its role in coral bleaching presents one of the most complex and interesting current problems in reef ecology.[53]


Viral endosymbionts

The human genome project found several thousand endogenous retroviruses, endogenous viral elements in the genome that closely resemble and can be derived from retroviruses, organized into 24 families.[54]


Symbiogenesis and organelles

Endosymbiotic_theory.svg Symbiogenesis explains the origins of eukaryotes, whose cells contain two major kinds of organelle, mitochondria and chloroplasts. The theory proposes that these organelles evolved from certain types of bacteria that eukaryotic cells engulfed through endophagocytosis. These cells and the bacteria trapped inside them entered an endosymbiotic relationship, meaning that the bacteria lived within the eukaryotic cells.[55]
