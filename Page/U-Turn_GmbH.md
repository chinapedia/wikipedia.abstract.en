U-TURN GMBH is a German aircraft manufacturer originally based in Villingen-Schwenningen and later in Tuningen. The company specializes in the design and manufacture of paragliders in the form of ready-to-fly aircraft, particularly for aerobatics.[1]

The company was founded by Thomas Vosseler and Ernst Strobl in 2002. One early innovation was offering glider purchase financing through an owners' club.[2]

U-Turn is organized as a Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter Haftung (GmbH), a German Limited liability company.[3]

The company's first product was the U-Turn Infinity, an intermediate glider designed for easy handling and safety.[4] By 2016 they had a full line of gliders for all levels of pilots, plus aerobatics, including a two-place aerobatic glider, the U-Turn Twinforce.[5]
