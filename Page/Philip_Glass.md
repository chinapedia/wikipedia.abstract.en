PHILIP GLASS (born January 31, 1937)[1] is an American composer. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the late 20th century.[2][3][4] Glass's work has been described as _minimal music_, having similar qualities to other "minimalist" composers such as La Monte Young, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley.[5] Glass describes himself as a composer of "music with repetitive structures",[6] which he has helped evolve stylistically.[7][8]

Glass founded the Philip Glass Ensemble, with which he still performs on keyboards. He has written numerous operas and musical theatre works, twelve symphonies, eleven concertos, eight string quartets and various other chamber music, and film scores. Three of his film scores have been nominated for Academy Awards.


Life and work

1937–1964: Beginnings, early education and influences

Glass was born in Baltimore, Maryland,[9][10] the son of Ida (née Gouline) and Benjamin Charles Glass.[11] His family were Jewish emigrants from Lithuania.[12][13] His father owned a record store and his mother was a librarian.[14] In his memoir, Glass recalls that at the end of World War II his mother aided Jewish Holocaust survivors, inviting recent arrivals to America to stay at their home until they could find a job and a place to live.[15] She developed a plan to help them learn English and develop skills so they could find work.[16] His sister, Sheppie, would later do similar work as an active member of the International Rescue Committee.[17]

Glass developed his appreciation of music from his father, discovering later his father's side of the family had many musicians. His cousin Cevia was a classical pianist, while others had been in vaudeville. He learned his family was also related to Al Jolson.[18]

Glass's father often received promotional copies of new recordings at his music store. He spent many hours listening to them, developing his knowledge and taste in music. This openness to modern sounds affected Glass at an early age:

The elder Glass promoted both new recordings and a wide selection of composers to his customers, sometimes convincing them to try something new by allowing them to return records they didn't like.[19] His store soon developed a reputation as Baltimore's leading source of modern music.

Glass built a sizable record collection from the unsold records in his father's store, including modern classical music such as Hindemith, Bartók, Schoenberg,[20] Shostakovich and Western classical music including Beethoven's string quartets and Schubert's [[Piano_Trio_No._1_(Schubert)|B'', based on a play by Austrian playwright and novelist Peter Handke, _Die Spuren der Verirrten_ (2007), premiered at the in April 2013, conducted by Dennis Russell Davies and directed by David Pountney.

On June 28, 2013, Glass's piano piece _Two Movements for Four Pianos_ was premiered at the Museum Kunstpalast, performed by Katia and Marielle Labèque, Maki Namekawa and Dennis Russell Davies.[21]

In May 2015, Glass's Double Concerto for Two Pianos was premiered by Katia and Marielle Labèque, Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

Glass published his memoir, _Words Without Music_, in 2015.[22]

His 11th symphony, commissioned by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz, the Istanbul International Music Festival, and the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, premiered on January 31, 2017, Glass's 80th birthday, at Carnegie Hall, Dennis Russell Davies conducting the Bruckner Orchestra.[23][24] On September 22, 2017 his Piano Concerto No. 3 was premiered by pianist Simone Dinnerstein with the strings of the chamber orchestra A Far Cry at Jordan Hall at the New England Conservatory of Music, Boston, Massachusetts.[25]

Glass's 12th symphony was premiered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic under John Adams at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles on January 10, 2019.[26]


Influences and collaborations

Glass describes himself as a "classicist", pointing out he is trained in harmony and counterpoint and studied such composers as Franz Schubert, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart with Nadia Boulanger.[27] Aside from composing in the Western classical tradition, his music has ties to rock, ambient music, electronic music, and world music. Early admirers of his minimalism include musicians Brian Eno and David Bowie.[28] In the 1990s, Glass composed the aforementioned symphonies _Low_ (1992) and _Heroes_ (1996), thematically derived from the Bowie-Eno collaboration albums _Low_ and _"Heroes"_ composed in late 1970s Berlin.

Glass has collaborated with recording artists such as Paul Simon, Suzanne Vega,[29] Mick Jagger,[30] Leonard Cohen, David Byrne, Uakti, Natalie Merchant,[31] S'Express (Glass remixed their track _Hey Music Lover_ in 1989)[32] and Aphex Twin (yielding an orchestration of _Icct Hedral_ in 1995 on the Donkey Rhubarb EP). Glass's compositional influence extends to musicians such as Mike Oldfield (who included parts from Glass's _North Star_ in _Platinum_), and bands such as Tangerine Dream and Talking Heads. Glass and his sound designer Kurt Munkacsi produced the American post-punk/new wave band Polyrock (1978 to the mid-1980s), as well as the recording of John Moran's _The Manson Family (An Opera)_ in 1991, which featured punk legend Iggy Pop, and a second (unreleased) recording of Moran's work featuring poet Allen Ginsberg.

Glass had begun using the Farfisa portable organ out of convenience,[33] and he has used it in concert.[34] It is featured on several recordings including _North Star_[35] and on "Dance No. 1" and "Dance No. 3".[36][37]

Recording work

In 1970, Glass and Klaus Kertess (owner of the Bykert Gallery) formed a record label named _Chatham Square Productions_ (named after the location of the studio of a Philip Glass Ensemble member Dick Landry).[38] In 1993 Glass formed another record label, Point Music; in 1997, Point Music released _Music for Airports_, a live, instrumental version of Eno's composition of the same name, by Bang on a Can All-Stars. In 2002, Glass and his producer Kurt Munkacsi and artist Don Christensen founded the Orange Mountain Music company, dedicated to "establishing the recording legacy of Philip Glass" and, to date, have released sixty albums of Glass's music.


Music for film

Glass has composed many film scores, starting with the orchestral score for _Koyaanisqatsi_ (1982), and continuing with two biopics, _Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters_ (1985, resulting in the String Quartet No. 3) and _Kundun_ (1997) about the Dalai Lama, for which he received his first Academy Award nomination. In 1968 he composed and conducted the score for director Harrison Engle's minimalist comedy short, _Railroaded,_ played by the Philip Glass Ensemble. This was one of his earliest film efforts.

The year after scoring _Hamburger Hill_ (1987), Glass began a long collaboration with the filmmaker Errol Morris with his music for Morris's celebrated documentaries, including _The Thin Blue Line_ (1988) and _A Brief History of Time_ (1991).[39] He continued composing for the Qatsi trilogy with the scores for _Powaqqatsi_ (1988) and _Naqoyqatsi_ (2002). In 1995 he composed the theme for Reggio's short independent film _Evidence_. He made a cameo appearance—briefly visible performing at the piano—in Peter Weir's _The Truman Show_ (1998), which uses music from _Powaqqatsi_, _Anima Mundi_ and _Mishima_, as well as three original tracks by Glass. In the 1990s, he also composed scores for _Bent_ (1997) and the thriller _Candyman_ (1992) and its sequel, _Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh_ (1995), plus a film adaptation of Joseph Conrad's _The Secret Agent_ (1996).

In 1999, he finished a new soundtrack for the 1931 film _Dracula_. _The Hours_ (2002) earned him a second Academy Award nomination, and was followed by another Morris documentary, _The Fog of War_ (2003). In the mid-2000s Glass provided the scores to films such as _Secret Window_ (2004), _Neverwas_ (2005), _The Illusionist_ and _Notes on a Scandal_, garnering his third Academy Award nomination for the latter. Glass's most recent film scores include _No Reservations_ (Glass makes a brief cameo in the film sitting at an outdoor café), _Cassandra's Dream_ (2007), _Les Regrets_ (2009), _Mr Nice_ (2010), the Brazilian film _Nosso Lar_ (2010) and _Fantastic Four_ (2015, in collaboration with Marco Beltrami). In 2009, Glass composed original theme music for _Transcendent Man_, about the life and ideas of Ray Kurzweil by filmmaker Barry Ptolemy.

In the 2000s Glass's work from the 1980s again became known to wider public through various media. In 2005 his Concerto for Violin and Orchestra (1987) was featured in the surreal French thriller, _La Moustache_, providing a tone intentionally incongruous to the banality of the movie's plot.[40] _Metamorphosis: Metamorphosis One_ from _Solo Piano_ (1989) was featured in the reimagined _Battlestar Galactica_ in the episode "Valley of Darkness"[41] and also in the final episode ("return 0") of _Person of Interest_. In 2008, Rockstar Games released _Grand Theft Auto IV_ featuring Glass's "Pruit Igoe" (from _Koyaanisqatsi_). "Pruit Igoe" and "Prophecies" (also from _Koyaanisqatsi_) were used both in a trailer for _Watchmen_ and in the film itself. _Watchmen_ also included two other Glass pieces in the score: "Something She Has To Do" from _The Hours_ and "Protest" from _Satyagraha_, act 2, scene 3. In 2013 Glass contributed a piano piece "Duet" to the Park Chan-wook film _Stoker_ which is performed diegetically in the film.[42][43] In 2017 Glass scored the National Geographic Films documentary _Jane_ (a documentary on the life of renowned British primatologist Jane Goodall).

Glass's music was featured in two award-winning films by Russian director Andrey Zvyagintsev, _Elena_ (2011) and _Leviathan_ (2014).

For television, Glass composed the theme for _Night Stalker_ (2005).


Personal life, friends and collaborators

Glass has described himself as "a Jewish-Taoist-Hindu-Toltec-Buddhist",[44] and he is a supporter of the Tibetan independence movement. In 1987, he co-founded the Tibet House with Columbia University professor Robert Thurman and the actor Richard Gere at the request of the 14th Dalai Lama.[45] Glass is a vegetarian.[46]

Glass has four children and one granddaughter. Juliet (b. 1968) and Zachary (b. 1971) are his children from his first marriage, to theater director JoAnne Akalaitis (married 1965, divorced 1980). His second marriage was to Luba Burtyk; the two were later divorced.[47] His third wife, the artist Candy Jernigan, died of liver cancer in 1991, aged 39. Cameron is Glass's son with his fourth wife, restaurant manager Holly Critchlow (married in 2001),[48] whom Glass later divorced. Glass lives in New York and in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. He was romantically involved with cellist Wendy Sutter from 2008 until 2010.[49]

Glass is the first cousin once removed of Ira Glass, host of the radio show _This American Life_.[50] Ira interviewed Glass onstage at Chicago's Field Museum; this interview was broadcast on NPR's _Fresh Air_. Ira interviewed Glass a second time at a fundraiser for St. Ann's Warehouse; this interview was given away to public radio listeners as a pledge drive thank you gift in 2010. Ira and Glass recorded a version of the composition Glass wrote to accompany his friend Allen Ginsberg's poem "Wichita Vortex Sutra."

In an interview, Glass said Franz Schubert—with whom he shares a birthday—is his favorite composer.[51] In June 2012, Glass was featured on the cover of issue No. 79 of _The Fader_.[52]

In 1978 Sylvère Lotringer conducted a 14-page interview with Glass in Columbia University's philosophy department publication of Semiotext(e) called _Schizo-Culture: The Event, The Book_.[53]

Glass counts many artists among his friends and collaborators, including visual artists (Richard Serra, Chuck Close, Fredericka Foster), writers (Doris Lessing, David Henry Hwang, Allen Ginsberg), film and theatre directors (including Errol Morris, Robert Wilson, JoAnne Akalaitis, Godfrey Reggio, Paul Schrader, Martin Scorsese, Christopher Hampton, Bernard Rose, and many others), choreographers (Lucinda Childs, Jerome Robbins, Twyla Tharp), and musicians and composers (Ravi Shankar, David Byrne, the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, Foday Musa Suso, Laurie Anderson, Linda Ronstadt, Paul Simon, Pierce Turner, Joan La Barbara, Arthur Russell, David Bowie, Brian Eno, Roberto Carnevale, Patti Smith, Aphex Twin, Lisa Bielawa, Andrew Shapiro, John Moran, Bryce Dessner and Nico Muhly). Among recent collaborators are Glass's fellow New Yorker Woody Allen, Stephen Colbert,[54] and poet and songwriter Leonard Cohen.


Criticism

Justin Davidson of _New York_ magazine has criticized Glass, saying, "Glass never had a good idea he didn't flog to death: He repeats the haunting scale 30 mind-numbing times, until it's long past time to go home."[55] Richard Schickel of _Time_ criticized Glass's score for _The Hours_, saying, "This ultimately proves insufficient to lend meaning to their lives or profundity to a grim and uninvolving film, for which Philip Glass unwittingly provides the perfect score—tuneless, oppressive, droning, painfully self-important."[56]

Michael White of _The Daily Telegraph_ described Glass' _Violin Concerto No. 2_ as being
