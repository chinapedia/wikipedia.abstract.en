DILLIA is an extinct town in Ozark County, in the U.S. state of Missouri. The GNIS classifies it as a populated place.[1] However, the location coordinates place it within the waters of Bull Shoals Lake on the Barren Fork Branch of the Little North Fork White River[2] approximately four miles south-southeast of the Hammond mill site and four miles northeast of Theodosia.

A post office called Dillia was established in 1891, and remained in operation until 1912.[3] The community, also spelled "Dellia", was named after Dellia Kyle, the daughter of an early settler.[4]
