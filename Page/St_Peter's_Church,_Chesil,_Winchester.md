ST PETERâ€™S CHURCH, CHESIL, WINCHESTER, formerly known as ST PETER UPON CHESILLE WITHOUT EASTGATE, is a former parish church of the Church of England in Winchester, Hampshire,[1] and is now the home of Chesil Theatre.[2]

The church comprises elements from the 12th century and later. It is constructed of flint and stone, and the belfry turret, and roofs are hung with tiles.[3]

It fell out of use after the Second World War and was declared structurally unsafe in 1960. It was then acquired by the Chesil Theatre company.


Organ

The church contained a small one-manual pipe organ. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.[4]
