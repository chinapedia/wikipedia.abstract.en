_THE BAMBOO FLUTE_ is a 1992 children's novel by Garry Disher.[1] Set during the depression, it is about a boy who is taught by a swagman to make and play a bamboo flute.


Reception

In a review of _The Bamboo Flute_, _Booklist_ wrote "The author's thesis—aesthetic beauty is a basic need, especially during times of extreme hardship—will not escape the notice of young audiences, and the frequent touches of local color make this a fine choice for reading aloud and for classes studying Australia."[2] _Kirkus Reviews_ described it as "a beautifully written novella" that is "Brief and easily read, a powerfully realized moment in Australia's past."[3] _Publishers Weekly_ wrote "From its exquisite opening line ("There was once music in our lives, but I can feel it slipping away") to the moving finale, this elegantly delineated tale never strikes a false note." and "Disher's spare, evocative, emotionally charged coming-of-age story is reminiscent in style to the work of Paul Fleischman, but his voice is wholly his own, musical and haunting."[4]

_The Bamboo Flute_ has also been reviewed by the _School Library Journal_,[5] and _The Horn Book Magazine_.[6]

It received the 1993 CBCA Book of the Year: Younger Readers Award,[7] and a 1994 International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY) Australia honour.[8]
