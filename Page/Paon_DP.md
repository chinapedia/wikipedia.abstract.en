DP INC. is a video game development company based in Japan. Through a partnership with Nintendo, the company has developed _DK: King of Swing_, _DK: Jungle Climber_ and _Donkey Kong Barrel Blast_. They also developed _Glory of Heracles_, the fifth title of the Glory of Heracles series.

When the company Data East went bankrupt, Paon became composed of former Data East staff and bought the rights to some of their games, including Karnov,[1] Chelnov (sometimes known as Atomic Runner outside Japan),[2] the _Kuuga_ trilogy,[3] and the Glory of Heracles series. In March 2015, PAON Inc. merged with DP Inc. to form PAON DP Inc.[4]
