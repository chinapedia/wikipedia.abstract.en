History

Jimma Aba Buna was founded in 1955 in the southwestern Ethiopian city of Jimma. During the 1960's EC the club was one of the most competitive clubs in the top league of Ethiopian Football.

In 2013 (2006 E.C.) the club was re-established after initially folding years earlier. After the 2015–16 season the club was promoted to the Ethiopian Premier League for the first time after being re-established two years earlier.[2] The following year the club released their manager Dereje Belay mid way through the season instead hiring Gebremedhin Haile to replace him.[3] However, later that season the team was relegated from the top league after only one season.

The club let go of manager Dereje Belay and hired Anteneh Abera as his replacement mid way through their 2017–18 Ethiopian Higher League season.[4] They finished second in group B of the 2017–18 Ethiopian Higher League season by virtue earning a playoff spot against runners up in Group A, Shire Endeselassie (the winner is promoted to the Ethiopian Premier League).
