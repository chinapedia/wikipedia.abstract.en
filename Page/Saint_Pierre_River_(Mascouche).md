Toponymy

On the Christian origin, the place name is known since the beginning of the concession of the Seigneurie des Plaines, circa 1731. The settlers began clearing lots before 1740 along the St. Pierre River, which allowed a winter ice road before the development of roads along the river. This name is attested the first time in 1853 with exact location on the map of Francis Joseph Bouchette. The erection of documents of the parish of Mascouche, 1829-1831, indicate that the St. Pierre River has been designated "Ruisseau de la Plaine". Joseph Bouchette map of 1831 indicates that stream "Riv. St Mary ", echoing the designation appearing in a confession and enumeration of Seigneurie de Terrebonne in 1736.[2]

The place name "Saint Pierre River" was formalized December 5, 1968, at the Bank of place names of Commission de toponymie du Québec (Quebec Geographical Names Board).[3]
