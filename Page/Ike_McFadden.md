Among the company's first released games were "Hulk Hogan's Hulkamania", starring wrestler and actor Hulk Hogan debuted on Sky Vegas in November 2012.[2] Their next game, "The Hoff", featuring actor-singer David Hasselhoff, was released widely in Europe in February 2013.[3][4]

In early 2014, McFadden and Bischoff's online-gaming company announced a deal with actor Dan Aykroyd to launch a Blues Brothers themed online casino game in Europe.[5]

McFadden said in a 2015 interview with IGaming Intelligence, "â€œAs the industry has matured it has become more and more like traditional media, you can have a bigger opening weekend [for a game] and then it may drop off faster in terms of performance, so you have a shorter time period to make the money you are going to make".[6]

In late 2014, MX Digital launched games on Facebook, under the title "MX Casino".[7] Slot-machine-style games playable upon launch as a Facebook app included "socialized" versions of "Hulk Hogan's Hulkamania", as well as a similarly Facebook version for David Hasslehoff's, "The Hoff". Also debuting in October of that year were a several new themed games, featuring Dennis Rodman, James Dean and Chuck Norris.[8]
