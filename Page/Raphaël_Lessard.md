Racing career

Lessard started racing in an old Honda Civic, winning his first race on the day of his twelfth birthday. He then ran Quebec sportsmans and super late models in Canada before moving to America.[2]

His first American racing experience came in the CARS Super Late Model Tour, driving the 2015 season for Toyota Racing Development and David Gilliland Racing.[3] In 2016, at age 15, and in grade 10, he became the second non-American to win the CARS Super Late Model series championship,[4] the other being Mario Gosselin, also a Canadian from Quebec, who accomplished the feat in 1997.[5] It was Lessard's first championship.[6] He won four of ten races during the season, including the season finale at Southern National Motorsports Park.[7] Lessard continued with Toyota and David Gilliland Racing to run late model racing in large events like the Winchester 400, Snowball Derby and various PASS Late Model, CRA Racing Series and ARCA Racing Series events.[8] He was disqualified from an April 2017 PASS race for intentionally wrecking other drivers, illegally passing under yellow, and inappropriate actions by his crew.[9]

He debuted in the ARCA Racing Series in 2017 driving for Venturini Motorsports.[10] He made the top ten in his second start at Winchester Speedway.[11]

On February 15, 2019, it was announced that Lessard will drive three races in the No. 46 Toyota Tundra for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series.[12] Lessard started 7th and finished 14th in his Truck Series debut at Martinsville.[13] In June, he joined DGR-Crosley's No. 17 truck for the Iowa Speedway and Canadian Tire Motorsport Park races.[14]
