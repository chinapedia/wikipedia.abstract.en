CREWE CARRIAGE SIDINGS (alternatively CREWE CARRIAGE DEPOT, and also as CREWE L&NWR)[1][2] is a stabling point located in Crewe, Cheshire, England, on the eastern side of the West Coast Main Line, between that line and the line to Alsager, to the south of Crewe station.[3]


History

The main shed was opened by the London & North Western Railway prior to 1910, as a seven-track through-road shed. By the 1960s, this shed was used by British Rail for stabling multiple units. The three-track bay, closest to the West Coast Main Line, was refurbished after 1996.[4] The second building is a three plus one-track through-road shed, built in 1999.[5]
