The scenes saw kidnap victim Andy Carver (played by Oliver Farnworth) shoot fellow hostage Vinny Ashford (Ian Kelsey), before being killed himself by their captor, Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre). Phelan is then seen to dispose of the bodies in a lake. In its defence, ITV says that the character "has already been established as a villain [and] so his actions, evil though they are, won't have come as a surprise to viewers [but] the programme is always careful to limit the level of violence actually shown to a minimum to convey the drama and tell the story".[286]
