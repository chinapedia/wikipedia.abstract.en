PETER HERMANN HRDLITSCHKA (born November 6, 1955 in Reutlingen, Germany) is a former Canadian competition swimmer. At 2 years of age, Hrdlitschka immigrated, along with his parents Doris and Frank, to Ocean Falls, British Columbia, Canada where, at age 5, his competitive swimming career began with a 3rd-place finish for freestyle. The Hrdlitschka family moved to Vernon, British Columbia in 1965.[1]

In 1970, Hrdlitschka set the Canadian record for boys 13-14 100-metre breaststroke. In 1972, he finished 4th at the Canadian Olympic trials and moved to Vancouver to train with the Canadian Dolphin Swim Club and the National Development Team Program. In 1973, he won bronze for Canada — along with teammates Ian MacKenzie, Bruce Robertson and Brian Phillips — at the World Aquatics Championships in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in the men’s 4 x 100 metre medley relay.

As a senior swimmer with the Master Ducks Swim Club, Hrdlitschka continues to set National records for his age group in the breaststroke.[2]

Hrdlitschka has 3 daughters — Danielle, Cara and Kyla — and a step-daughter, Megan. On March 31, 2012, Hrdlitschka married Sharon Wyse Boileau. The couple live in North Vancouver where Hrdlitschka is President of Ledcor Construction, Canada.[3] Hrdlitschka and Wyse Boileau — now officially Wyse Hrdlitschka — are involved in volunteer and philanthropical efforts on behalf of children.[4][5]
