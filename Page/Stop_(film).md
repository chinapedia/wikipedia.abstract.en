_STOP_ () is a South Korean-Japanese co-production directed by Kim Ki-duk that had its premiere at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic.[1][2]


Plot

A young married couple were exposed to radiation during the meltdown at Japan's Fukushima nuclear reactor. The young woman is pregnant and she and her husband must decide whether or not to keep the baby.
