Academics

Newman originally earned degrees for elementary school teaching from kindergarten to grade 8, however her academic career began by teaching Chinese cooking in the Home-Economics Department at Queens College-CUNY. This involvement in Chinese cuisines in the department led her to continue earn her Masters and Doctorate in home economics.[11]

The subject of her doctoral thesis originated with a discussion with New York University Professor Ruth Linke, and involved comparing the dietary habits of culturally Chinese people in China and versus the United States. Since then, Chinese and Asian cuisines and food habits has been the focus of her academic research.[12]

In 2002, Newman gifted to Stony Brook University a historically significant collection of over 4000 pieces of audio and visual material on Chinese food culture, medicine, and history and Chinese cookbooks.[13] Known as the _Jacqueline M. Newman Chinese Cookbook Collection_, it "...provides a valuable record of the Chinese Diaspora that has carried its rich cuisine to every corner of the globe."[14]

In 2013, Newman is looking to hand over her position as the editor-in-chef for _Flavor and Fortune_.[15]
