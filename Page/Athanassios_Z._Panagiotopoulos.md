ATHANASSIOS Z. PANAGIOTOPOULOS[1] is currently the Susan Dod Brown Professor[2] and Department Chair[3] of the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering of Princeton University.


Education and academic career

Prof. Panagiotopoulos received his undergraduate degree from the National Technical University of Athens in 1982 and a PhD from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1986, both in Chemical Engineering. He was a postdoctoral fellow in physical chemistry at the University of Oxford (1986–87) and a faculty member at Cornell University (1987–97) and the Institute for Physical Science and Technology of the University of Maryland (1997-2000).

Research

Research in the Panagiotopoulos group focuses on development and application of theoretical and computer simulation techniques for the study of properties of fluids and materials. Emphasis is on molecular-based models that explicitly represent the main interactions in a system. These models can be used to predict the behavior of materials at conditions inaccessible to experiment and to gain a fundamental understanding of the microscopic basis for observed macroscopic properties, utilizing large-scale numerical computations. The group emphasizes development of novel simulation algorithms for free energies and phase transitions. An example of such a methodology is Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo,[4] which provides a direct way to obtain coexistence properties of fluids from a single simulation.

Publications and books

Prof. Panagiotopoulos is the author of more than 250 technical papers[5] and of the undergraduate textbook _Essential Thermodynamics: An undergraduate textbook for chemical engineers_[6] (2011).


Awards and achievements

He has received numerous awards and honors, including the AIChE Colburn Award,[7][8] and the Prausnitz Award[9] in applied chemical thermodynamics. He was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Engineering in 2004,[10] as a Fellow to both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences[11] and the American Association for the Advancement of Science[12][13] in 2012, and as a Fellow of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) in 2014.[14]
