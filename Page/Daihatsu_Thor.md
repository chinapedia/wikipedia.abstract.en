The (also called and ) is a mini MPV designed and manufactured by Daihatsu. It is sold by Daihatsu, Toyota and Subaru.[1] It is a five-seater MPV based on the third generation Boon and its rebadged version Toyota Passo, and was introduced on November 9, 2016[2] as the successor to the Coo/Materia and Toyota Ractis. It uses the same 1.0-liter _1KR-FE_ as the Boon/Passo. It is currently sold only in Japan and is not regarded as a kei car due to the exterior dimensions as defined by Japanese government dimension regulations and the engine displacement of 1,000Â cc, which incurs a modest annual road tax obligation. The Tank is exclusive to _Toyopet Store_ and _Netz_, while the Roomy is exclusive to _Toyota Store_ and _Corolla Store_.[3] It sits below the Sienta in Toyota's model line-up.
