The 2017 HORIZON LEAGUE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT (also known as MOTOR CITY MADNESS) was the conference tournament that ended the 2016–17 season of the Horizon League. It was played from March 3 through March 7, 2017 at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit. Regular-season co-champion Green Bay won the tournament and earned the Horizon League's automatic berth into the 2017 NCAA Women's Tournament.


Seeds

All 10 teams participated in the tournament. The top six teams received a bye into the Second Round. This was a change from the previous season where the top two seeds received double byes into the Semifinals.[1] Teams were seeded by record within the conference, with a tiebreaker system to seed teams with identical conference records.
