RODNEY FIRST is a local body ticket in Auckland, New Zealand. It formed in 2015 with a view to gaining a majority on the Rodney Local Board in the 2016 Auckland Council Elections.[1]


History

The ticket was formed in 2015 by sitting Rodney Local Board members Beth Houlbrooke and Phelan Pirrie along with Cameron Brewer a retiring Councillor for Orakei.[2][3] They were joined by athlete Allison Roe,[4] Leigh based farmer Mike Francis and Helensville resident Brent Bailey in 2016 to front a six member team in the 2016 Auckland Council election.

The main goals Rodney First campaigned on were to improve transport and public transport infrastructure, provide a public pool in Warkworth and a multi-sports facility in Huapai, in addition to addressing the pressures of residential growth and environmental improvements to waterways and harbours.[5]
