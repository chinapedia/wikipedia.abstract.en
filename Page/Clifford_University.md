History

Clifford University is established on land that belonged to an Adventist school until it was seized by the government following the country’s 1967–70 civil war. The government returned the land to the church in 2013. It is named after Jesse Clifford - a British missionary who brought Adventism to eastern Nigeria in 1923, serving in Nigeria for eight years.[5]
