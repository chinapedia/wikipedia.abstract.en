CRAIG TURPIE of Stirling, Scotland, is chairman of the World Scout Committee, the main executive body of the World Organization of the Scout Movement.[1][2][3]


Scouting in the UK

Craig Turpie first got involved in Scouting by joining his local Cub Scout Pack in 1983 and followed the youth programme through, achieving both his Queen's Scout Award and Explorer Belt. He became Assistant Area Commissioner for Venture Scouts in Edinburgh, and later the first Area Scout Network Commissioner for Edinburgh. It was at this point that Turpie first became involved with the work of the organisation's Scottish Headquarters and UK Headquarters in a number of different roles.

Turpie was a member of The Scout Association's International Team between 2001 and 2007. He rejoined that team in 2013 for a brief stint as Deputy International Commissioner.

Turpie was appointed UK Commissioner for Programme on 1 April 2014. He held the role until elected chair of the World Scout Committee in 2017.[4]

Then UK Chief Commissioner Wayne Bulpitt, who appointed Turpie to the programme role, said "I'm delighted that Craig has joined our UK leadership team. We'll benefit from his extensive experience and talents as we further develop our youth programme and the support given to leaders delivering it, both of which we know are key to our continued success."
