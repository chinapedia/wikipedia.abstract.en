''' Josephine "Josie" Mary Martin '''(born December 17, 1988), better known by her stage name CANDYLAND, is an American record producer, DJ and musician.[1]

Candyland has been more commonly known as a duo[2] consisting of both Martin and Ethan Davis. But in 2014, Ethan Davis officially left the project, therefore transforming Candyland into a solo act, now carried by Martin alone.[3]


Critical reception

Matthew Meadow of Your EDM describes "Speechless" as having "a fresh groove to it that definitely heats up the dancefloor" with "a strong house vibe that combines with flutes and synths from tropical house, creating a pleasant combination that works for any setting".[4]

EDM Sauce states that the "new Candyland gem brings infectious vocals, punchy basslines, melody-rich flute and synth elements, as well as an overall feel-good vibe".[5]

Alexander Davis of EDMTunes said 'While "Speechless" is a clear departure from banging big room, it still has a refined groove that is sure to ignite the dance floor', going on to comment that "Candyland deftly fuses indie-leaning vocals with strong electronic textures that give the tune a deep groove that will have you moving before you know it".[6]
