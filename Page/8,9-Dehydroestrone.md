8,9-DEHYDROESTRONE, or Δ⁸-ESTRONE, also known as ESTRA-1,3,5(10),8-TETRAEN-3-OL-17-ONE, is a naturally occurring estrogen found in horses which is closely related to equilin, equilenin, and estrone, and, as the 3-sulfate ester sodium salt, is a minor constituent (3.5%) of conjugated estrogens (Premarin).[1][2][3][4] It produces 8,9-dehydro-17β-estradiol as an important active metabolite, analogously to conversion of estrone or estrone sulfate into estradiol.[5][6][7][8] The compound was first described in 1997.[9][10] In addition to 8,9-dehydroestrone and 8,9-dehydro-17β-estradiol, 8,9-dehydro-17α-estradiol is likely also to be present in conjugated estrogens, but has not been identified at this time.[11]
