KIRK LEE HAMMETT (born November 18, 1962) is an American musician who has been lead guitarist and a contributing songwriter for the heavy metal band Metallica since 1983. Before joining Metallica he formed and named the band Exodus. In 2003, Hammett was ranked 11th on _Rolling Stone_'s list of The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.[1] In 2009, Hammett was ranked number 15 in Joel McIver's book _The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists_.[2][3][4]


Early life

Hammett was born on November 18, 1962 in San Francisco, and raised in the town of El Sobrante, California. He is the son of Teofila "Chefela" (née Oyao) and Dennis L. Hammett (a Merchant Marine).[5] His mother is of Filipino descent and his father was of English, German, Scottish and Irish ancestry.[6] He attended De Anza High School in Richmond, California. While attending De Anza High School, he met Les Claypool of Primus, and they remain close friends.

Hammett has a well-known passion for horror movies that stretches back to the late Sixties. After spraining his arm in a fight with his sister at the age of five, Hammett's parents placed him in front of the television. It was during this time that he first watched _The Day of the Triffids_. After that, Hammett found himself drawn to his brother's Frankenstein figures, and soon began spending his milk money on horror magazines. For the better part of the next decade, Hammett dove deep into the horror scene.[7]

Hammett began showing an interest in music after listening to his brother Rick's extensive record collection (which included Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and UFO).[8] He began selling his horror magazines to buy music records[9], which led him to properly picking up the guitar at the age of fifteen. Hammett's first guitar was (in his own words) a "wholly unglamorous" Montgomery Ward catalog special, which was accompanied by a shoebox (with a 4-inch speaker) for an amp.[10] After purchasing a 1978 Fender Stratocaster copy, Hammett attempted to customize his sound with various guitar parts, before eventually buying a 1974 Gibson Flying V. Hammett also took a job at Burger King as a youth, which he quit as soon as he had saved enough money to purchase a Marshall amplifier.


Career

Exodus (1979–1983)

Hammett's musical interests eventually drew him into the fledgling thrash metal genre. In 1979, he formed the band Exodus at the age of sixteen,[11] along with vocalist Paul Baloff, guitarist Gary Holt, bassist Geoff Andrews, and drummer Tom Hunting. Hammett named Exodus after the Leon Uris novel of the same name,[12] and played on the band's _1982 Demo_. Exodus was an influential band in the Bay Area thrash movement.

Metallica (1983–present)

In May 1983, Metallica traveled to Rochester, New York to record its debut album, _Metal Up Your Ass_.[13] Due to the lead guitarist's (Dave Mustaine) substance abuse and violent tendencies, he was fired from the band, and would eventually form the band Megadeth.[14] Hammett received a phone call from Metallica the same afternoon. Even though he had never left California before, Hammett gathered some money together and flew out to New York for an audition. According to James Hetfield: - "The first song we played was "Seek and Destroy", and Kirk pulled off this solo, and it was like ... things are going to be alright!"; so Kirk was instantly asked to join the band.[15] All of this happened prior to the recording of _Kill 'Em All_. At the time, Hammett was taking private lessons from guitar virtuoso Joe Satriani. He was also still a member of Exodus at the time he was offered to join Metallica, and although the offer may have come as a surprise to him, he was already well acquainted with Metallica.[16] While in Exodus, Hammett had shared the stage with Metallica on more than one occasion.[17]

in 2010]] Hammett has written a number of riffs for Metallica since _Ride the Lightning_ (the band's second album). One of his riffs was used on "Enter Sandman" - which went on to become one of Metallica's most popular songs. It was the first track and the first single on the band's self-titled album _Metallica_ (also known as _The Black Album_), and was ranked 399th on _Rolling Stone_'s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.[18] The bridge for "Creeping Death" was originally an Exodus riff that Hammett took with him to Metallica.

In 1986, during the band's European leg of their tour to support _Master of Puppets_, Hammett and bassist Cliff Burton had a dispute over sleeping arrangements on the band's tour bus. The outcome of the dispute was decided by a card draw, which Burton won by picking the Ace of Spades. Once the draw was completed, Burton looked at Hammett and said "I want your bunk", to which Hammett complied, saying that he might be able to sleep better in the front of the bus anyway. In the early hours of the following morning, Metallica's tour bus slid off the road and overturned in Sweden. Burton was thrown through the window of the bus, which fell on top of Burton and subsequently killed him.[19] Hammett has stated in an interview that he once thought that it easily could've been him who was killed instead, since Burton was sleeping in what was considered to be Hammett's bunk. In Kirk's own words "You know to this day I just think, it could have been me or it couldn't have been me but ... its never left me to this day."

Between the end of touring (and promoting) the _Black Album_ and the start of touring in promotion of _Load_, he studied at San Francisco State University, focusing on Film and Asian arts.[20] Hammett went through a "blues period" around this time - which had some influence on Metallica's _Load_ and _Reload_ albums.[21] He also began listening to a lot of jazz music. Hammett described this period of his life as "great education", because he was able to discover where all of his own rock influences had gotten their own guitar licks.[22] However, even though jazz music had a profound effect on his improvisation skills and solos, Hammett felt that he was delving too deep into the genre. Since _Death Magnetic_, Hammett has gone back to being "primarily" a metal guitarist,[23] but some of his experiences of jazz and blues music still remain.[24]

, Texas in 2017]]

Hammett wanted to have guitar solos on Metallica's 2003 album, _St. Anger_, but drummer Lars Ulrich and producer Bob Rock thought that the solos did not sound right in the songs. He later admitted himself, "We tried to put in solos but they sounded like an afterthought so we left them out".[25] Recording for _St. Anger_ was halted in 2001; so that Metallica front-man James Hetfield could enter rehab for alcohol abuse.[26] Due to tensions within the band (which were well-documented in the Metallica documentary _Some Kind of Monster_) at the time, Hammett expressed interest in working on a solo album.[27] According to Hammett, if he ever worked on a solo album, it wouldn't be "super-duty" heavy metal,[28] and may include some classical guitarists.[29] When he was asked about his experiences of recording _St. Anger_, Hammett said:

On April 4, 2009, Hammett, along with Metallica bandmates Lars Ulrich, James Hetfield, and Robert Trujillo and former Metallica bandmates Jason Newsted and the deceased Cliff Burton, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2009, Hammett provided the foreword to British author Joel McIver's book _To Live Is to Die: The Life and Death of Metallica's Cliff Burton_.[30]

In April, 2015, Hammett admitted to losing his phone - which contained 250 new "ideas" for Metallica's upcoming studio release.[31][32] The incident happened about six months prior to the admission (around November 2014).[33] The phone wasn't backed up and Hammett can only remember eight out of the 250 "ideas" he had.[34] On the subject, Hammett said:

Other appearances

He also appeared on the _Kichigai_ E.P. by punk band Septic Death. He played additional lead guitar on the title track.

Hammett can be seen in the background in Primus' "John the Fisherman" video fishing off of Les Claypool's boat. Hammett has been friends with Primus bassist and lead vocalist Les Claypool since childhood. Claypool even auditioned for Metallica after the tragic death of Cliff Burton.[35]

Hammett played guitar on the track "Satan" with Orbital for the _Spawn: The Album_ soundtrack released in July 1997.

Hammett plays a guitar solo on Pansy Division's song Headbanger which appears on the ep "For Those About to Suck Cock" Lookout Records 1996 [36]

In 2005, Hammett was featured playing the guitar roles on the Carlos Santana track "Trinity" alongside steel-pedal guitarist, Robert Randolph. Santana personally asked Hammett to contribute to his then-upcoming album All That I Am.[37] Hammett previously worked with Santana in 2001 at a live show benefit in San Francisco.[38] Metallica had also invited Santana into the studio while recording _St. Anger_.[39]

In 2006, Hammett voiced himself on _The Simpsons_ ("The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer"). He also provided various voices on the Adult Swim show _Metalocalypse_, including a two fingered fan ("The Curse of Dethklok"), The Queen of Denmark ("Happy Dethday"), and a Finnish barkeep ("Dethtroll").

Hammett also appeared as a guest in an episode of _Space Ghost Coast to Coast_ titled "Jacksonville", alongside fellow Metallica member James Hetfield.

He appeared as a guest guitarist on K'Naan's 2006 song "If Rap Gets Jealous" off of the _Troubadour_ album.[40]

After performing a set with Metallica at Bonnaroo in June 2008, Hammett played one song with My Morning Jacket and a couple songs with the annual Superjam collaboration, which also included Les Claypool and members of Gogol Bordello playing primarily Tom Waits songs.

Hammett is one of the main characters in _Guitar Hero: Metallica_, along with the rest of the current line-up of Metallica.

In 2010, Hammett played with Nicolas Abou Chedid on Chedid's solo album.

In 2011, Hammett appeared in an episode of _Jon Benjamin Has a Van_ as an actor and guitarist.


Book

On October 1, 2012, Abrams Image published Hammett's first book, _Too Much Horror Business_ (a collection of photos detailing Hammett's lifelong love of monster movies and horror memorabilia).[41] Hammett has said that the book is "basically" all of the horror memorabilia he has managed to amass over the last 30 years. In an interview with _Guitar World_, Hammett said that he has such a huge horror collection and thought it was the right time to share it with everyone.[42] The 228 page hardcover features more than 300 images of Hammett's horror collection. Among these images are the costumes from the Bela Lugosi movies _White Zombie_ and _The Black Cat_ (which also starred Boris Karloff), original movie posters (ranging from _Nosferatu_ to _Hellraiser_), rare horror-themed toys (including the 'Great Garloo' and 'Frankenstein Tricky Walkers'), movie props (including the 'Dr. Tongue' zombie from George Romero's _Day of the Dead_, original Basil Gogos 'Famous Monsters', and fantasy paintings by the late Frank Frazetta.[43] In addition to the images from Hammett's horror collection, _Too Much Horror Business_ contains three conversations with the guitarist about his childhood, the nature of his horror collection, and the connection between Metallica's music and horror movies.[44] On the book, Hammett has been quoted saying:


Kirk Von Hammett's Fear FestEvil

_Kirk Von Hammett's Fear FestEvil_ is an annual horror convention created by Kirk Hammett. The first annual _Fear FestEvil_ took place at the Regency Ballroom in San Francisco - over a three-day period (from February 6–8, 2014). Hammett was inspired to create his own horror convention after experiencing the enjoyment of making his "crypt" at the ''Orion Music + More" festival.[45] The convention features live music, signings, interactive displays, vending, live talks, and guest appearances.[46] At the 2014 event, guests included Sara Karloff (daughter of actor Boris Karloff), Bela G. Lugosi (son of actor Bela Lugosi),[47] make-up artist Gregory Nicotero (who worked on George A. Romero's Day of the Dead), actor Tom Savini (who portrayed _Sex Machine_ in From Dusk Till Dawn and worked on many of George A. Romero's movies),[48] Heather Langenkamp (who portrayed Nancy in Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street),[49] Kane Hodder (who portrayed Jason Voorhees in the Friday the 13th film series), and Haruo Nakajima (of Godzilla fame).[50] Other guests in attendance included Hammett's former band Exodus, Death Angel, Orchid,[51] Metallica band member Robert Trujillo, Richard Christy, Stephen Perkins,[52] Slash, and Scott Ian.[53] Exodus played on-stage with Carcass on the Friday, whilst Death Division and Orchid played before Death Angel on the Saturday.[54] Hammett joined Exodus and Death Angel on-stage for their encores.[55]

The second annual _Fear FestEvil_ took place between April 10–12, 2015, at the _Rockbar Theater_ in San Jose, California.[56] Meshuggah headlined the event, whilst High on Fire, Blues Pills, Agnostic Front, and Asada Messiah also made appearances. Orchid also made a second appearance at the _Fear FestEvil_.[57] On April 10, VIP's were able to attend the _Dinner and Murder Mystery_ - along with Hammett - at the Winchester Mystery House.[58]


Personal life

Hammett has been married twice. His first marriage to Rebecca lasted three years, having ended in 1990, during the recording of _The Black Album_. Hammett has been married to his second wife Lani since 1998. They have two sons, Angel (b. September 29, 2006), and Vincenzo (b. June 28, 2008). He and his family reside in his hometown of San Francisco.[59]

In addition to playing guitar and collecting horror memorabilia, Hammett's hobbies include reading comic books and surfing.[60]

Substance abuse

At one point in his life, Hammett spent a "lot of money" on drugs.[61][62] Hammett has said that he used drugs because he thought they would be fun. During the Damaged Justice tour, he had a cocaine addiction. Hammett eventually pulled out of the addiction because cocaine made him feel depressed,[63] but relapsed during the _Load_ era.[64] One of the reasons that Hammett spends a lot of money on comic books, is because he finds them to be a more enjoyable (and healthier) alternative to drugs.[65] Hammett has also smoked heroin a few times, but "didn't like it".[66]

Environmentalism and Trump

Even though Metallica chooses to stay away from politics, Hammett expressed his disagreement with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's public pronouncements. In an interview with _Billboard_ magazine, he said, "I'm just waiting to get into a personal Twitter war with him." He stressed the importance of the fight against global warming, which Donald Trump claimed a hoax. He has expressed his alignment to Barack Obama and the Democrats on several occasions.[67]


Equipment and techniques

Hammett is known for always having his picking hand taped to protect his skin due to his habit of palm muting and fast picking during lengthy tours.[68]

Hammett's use of the wah-pedal hadn't been featured in recent Metallica solos, but has seen a resurgence in his solos on the 2008 album _Death Magnetic_, in songs like "The Unforgiven III."

Guitars

Kirk Hammett's tour guitars :

-   ESP M-II "ZORLAC" – This was the starting line for the whole KH series. It features a vertical skull and crossbones as opposed to the horizontal ones featured on today's KH's, and an upside down Jackson Guitars style headstock which is what Hammett originally intended. However, Jackson Guitars threatened lawsuits if this model was ever sold. As a result, the headstock was changed to the typical ESP style, but flipped upside down.[69][70]

On the 25th anniversary of Metallica's debut album _Kill 'Em All_, Hammett appears on the cover of Feb. 2008's _Guitar World_ sporting his new custom ESP. This model is the KH20, the 20th anniversary model from ESP.[85]

In 2014, Hammett purchased the 1959 Les Paul formerly used by Gary Moore and Peter Green; using it on tour when playing the Thin Lizzy cover: "Whiskey in the Jar".[86]

Amplifiers and cabinets

Throughout Metallica's career, Hammett has used a range of different amplifiers. For the first two albums, he used Marshall amplifiers and cabinets, with occasional effects. For the recording of Metallica's third album, _Master of Puppets_ (1986), he and James Hetfield bought a Mesa/Boogie MarkIIC+ amplifier, and used Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier heads. Even when he made his move to Randall Amplifiers in 2007, he still used Mesa/Boogie amplifiers in his setup, and still does to this day. He currently uses two rackmounted Dual Rectifier 2-channel heads in tandem with his Randalls.

In September 2007, Randall Amplifiers announced a partnership with Hammett to design a line of signature amplifiers, heads, combos and preamp modules.[87]

In December 2011, it was announced by Fortin Amps that they would team up with Randall to start a new line of tube amplifiers based on the Fortin Meathead amplifier. Hammett is currently using a prototype of the amplifier that he used for the Big 4 show at Yankee Stadium and for all of the shows in India and Asia, and was recently sent a second prototype.[88]

-   Mesa/Boogie Rackmounted Dual Rectifier (x2)
-   Randall RM100KH Signature Model (modified version of the MTS series RM100) (x1)
-   Randall/Fortin Prototype head (x2)

-   Randall 4x12 Cabinets (x4)
-   Randall/Fortin 4x12 Cabinet

Effects

To avoid problems with pedals being damaged during live performances, Hammett keeps his effect pedals in a rack along with his amplifiers and his guitar technician controls them through a pedalboard sidestage. The pedal controller allows him to change between different effect pedals and amplifiers.

In 2008, Jim Dunlop started working in partnership with Hammett to create a signature Wah-wah pedal, the KH95. It is now available to buy in stores.
