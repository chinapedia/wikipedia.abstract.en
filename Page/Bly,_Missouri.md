BLY is an extinct town in southwest Howell County, in the Ozarks of southern Missouri.[1] The location is on Bennetts Bayou about 3.5 miles southeast of Caulfield.

Bly was named after the horse of an early settler.[2] A post office called Bly was established in 1887, and remained in operation until 1923.[3] In the 1920s, the community was ruined by fire.[4]
