Admiral ROBERT MAN (died 1783) was a Royal Navy officer. He commanded the third-rate HMS _Lancaster_ at the Siege of Louisbourg in June 1758 during the French and Indian War. He went on to become commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands Station, then Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet and finally First Naval Lord.


Naval career

Robert Man was born in 1721 and baptised at St Mary’s, Chatham on 2 July of that year. He is listed in three ships commanded by his father, Captain Robert Man (1675-1745), these being a mixture of the usual fiction and fact. His passing certificate is dated 12 March 1739.[1] Man officially joined the Royal Navy on 17 September 1740.[2] Promoted to post-captain on 22 June 1745, he took command of the fifth-rate HMS _Launceston_ in June 1745, the fifth-rate HMS _Lynn_ in June 1746 and the fourth-rate HMS _Anson_ in February 1755.[3] He went on to command the sloop HMS _Porcupine_ in April 1757, the third-rate HMS _Prince Frederick_ in 1758 and the third-rate HMS _Lancaster_ later that year.[4] He commanded _Lancaster_ at the Siege of Louisbourg in June 1758 during the French and Indian War.[5] He then transferred to the command of the third-rate HMS _Cornwall_ in 1760.[6] Whilst in command of Cornwall, he took on board the orphaned son of his cousin, another Captain Robert Man (1720-1762), and did much to promote his career. The boy, later Admiral Robert Man (1745-1813), was described by Nelson as 'a good man in every sense of the word'.[7]

Man became commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands Station in 1769[8] and established a naval hospital at Antigua.[9]

Promoted to rear admiral on 18 October 1770,[10] Man went on to be commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet in 1774[11] and, having been promoted to vice admiral on 31 March 1775,[12] he joined the Board of Admiralty as First Naval Lord[13] in the North ministry in April 1779.[14] He retired from the Admiralty Board in September 1780[15] and, having been promoted to full admiral on 26 September 1780,[16] died in 1783.[17]
