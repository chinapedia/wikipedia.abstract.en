CHARLES WILLIAM MUMY JR. (; born February 1, 1954[1]) is an American actor, musician, pitchman, instrumentalist, voice actor, author and a figure in the science-fiction community. He came to prominence in the 1960s as a child actor, when he was credited as BILLY MUMY, an era which included appearances in _The Twilight Zone_ and _Alfred Hitchcock Presents_ television shows, as well as co-starring in _Dear Brigitte_, followed by an iconic three-season role as Will Robinson in the 1960s CBS sci-fi series _Lost in Space_.

He later appeared as lonely teenager Sterling North in the Disney film _Rascal_ (1969). He played Teft in the film _Bless the Beasts and Children_ (1971).

In the 1990s, he performed the role of Lennier in all five seasons of the syndicated sci-fi TV series _Babylon 5_, and narrated A&E Network's Emmy Award-winning series _Biography_.

Mumy is also known for his musical career as a guitarist, singer, songwriter and composer: he is an Emmy nominee for original music in _Adventures in Wonderland_ (1991). As a musician Mumy performs as a solo artist, an occasional guest performer, and as half of the duo Barnes & Barnes.


Early life and career

Mumy was born in San Gabriel, California to Charles William Mumy, a cattle rancher, and Muriel Gertrude Mumy (née Gould).[2] He began his professional career at age six, and has worked on more than four hundred television episodes, eighteen films, various commercials, and scores of voice-over projects.[3] He has also worked as a musician, songwriter, recording artist, and writer.[4]


Television and film career

Among Mumy's earliest television roles was six-year-old Willy in the "Donald's Friend" (1960) episode of the NBC-TV family drama series, _National Velvet_, starring Lori Martin. He starred in three episodes of CBS-TV's original _Twilight Zone_: "It's a Good Life" (November 1961), as a child who terrorizes his town with psychic powers (a role he later reprised along with his daughter Liliana in the _It's Still a Good Life_ episode of the second revival series); "In Praise of Pip" (September 1963), as a vision of Jack Klugman's long-neglected dying son; and "Long Distance Call" (March 1961) as Billy Bayles, who talks to his dead grandmother through a toy telephone.

The same year, Mumy starred as little Jackie in the episode "Bang! You're Dead", featuring Marta Kristen, who would later play his sister Judy on _Lost in Space_. Mumy was cast as Mark Murdock in the "Keep an Eye on Santa Claus" (1962) episode of the ABC-TV drama series _Going My Way_, starring Gene Kelly. His fellow guest stars were Cloris Leachman (who played his mother in "It's a Good Life"), Steve Brodie, and Frank McHugh.[5]

At age eight, Mumy appeared in Jack Palance's ABC-TV circus drama _The Greatest Show on Earth_ (1963); he was cast as Miles, a parentless boy, in the _Perry Mason_ episode "The Case of the Shifty Shoebox" (1963); and he portrayed Freddy in the "End of an Image" (1963) episode of NBC-TV's modern Western series _Empire_, starring Richard Egan.

In 1964, he was cast as Richard Kimble's nephew in ABC-TV's _The Fugitive_ episode, "Home Is the Hunted"; as Barry in the NBC-TV medical drama _The Eleventh Hour_ episode "Sunday Father"; as himself three times in the ABC sitcom _The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet_; in the Disney film _For the Love of Willadena_; and as a troubled orphan taken in by the Stephenses in the _Bewitched_ fantasy sitcom episode "A Vision of Sugarplums" (December 1964), on ABC-TV.

Mumy was reportedly the first choice to portray Eddie Munster in the 1964 CBS situation comedy _The Munsters_, but his parents objected to the extensive makeup requirements. The role instead went to Butch Patrick. Mumy appeared in one episode as a friend of Eddie's.

Mumy guest starred in an episode of NBC-TV's _I Dream of Jeannie_, "Whatever Became of Baby Custer?" (1965). That same year, he also appeared in an episode of _Bewitched_ entitled "Junior Executive" (1965), in which he played a young Darrin Stevens.

His parents, played by James Stewart and Glynis Johns, attempt to manage his obsession.[6]

_Lost in Space_ and beyond

While noted for several roles as both a child and adult actor, Mumy is perhaps best known for his iconic television role in a classic 60s science fiction series. From 1965 to 1968, Mumy portrayed Will Robinson in _Lost in Space_, who was the recipient of numerous warnings, (most famously "Danger, Will Robinson") from the show's robot character, voiced by Dick Tufeld.[7]

Mumy was later cast in _Bless the Beasts and Children_ (1971) as Teft, a leader in a group of misfit teenage boys resolved to save a herd of bison from hunters. He also played a musician friend of Cliff DeYoung's character in the TV movie _Sunshine_ (1973), and later reprised the role in _Sunshine Christmas_ and in the TV series _Sunshine_. In 1974, he played Nick Butler in the pilot episode of NBC's _The Rockford Files_ and also made an appearance in a later episode in season 1, as a sidewalk artist. In 1988, he played Ben Matlock's genius nephew, Dr. Irwin Bruckner, on Matlock.

In 1996, Mumy was a writer and co-creator of _Space Cases_, a Nickelodeon television show with themes similar to those of _Lost in Space_. Between 1994–1998 he played the ambassadorial aide Lennier in the syndicated science fiction series _Babylon 5_. In November 1998, he played a Starfleet officer in the _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ episode "The Siege of AR-558", in which he assists in defeating a Jem'Hadar detachment. To Mumy's delight,[8] his character was human this time; while playing Lennier in Babylon 5, he was required to wear prosthetic makeup. He was more recently seen in a 2006 episode of _Crossing Jordan_ and in the Sci Fi original film _A.I. Assault_.[9]

In 2018, Mumy appeared in the pilot episode of the Netflix remake series, _Lost in Space_. His character's name is Dr. Z. Smith, in homage to the character played by Jonathan Harris in the 1965 television series.


Voice acting career

Mumy has narrated over 50 episodes of the Arts & Entertainment Channel's _Biography_ series, as well as hosted and narrated several other documentaries and specials for A & E, Animal Planet network, The Sci-Fi Channel, and E!. His voice acting talents can be heard on animated shows like _Ren and Stimpy_, _Scooby-Doo_, _Batman: The Animated Series_, Steven Spielberg's _Animaniacs_, _Little Wizard Adventures_, _The Oz Kids_ and Disney's _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_ and _Doc McStuffins_. He has done voice over work in national commercials for such businesses as Bud Ice, Farmers Insurance, Ford, Blockbuster, Twix, Oscar Mayer and McDonald's.


Music

Mumy is an accomplished musician who plays the banjo, bass, guitar, harmonica, keyboards, mandolin, and percussion. His various musical credits include songs he has written and recorded with America, performed on tour with Shaun Cassidy, and played with Rick Springfield's band in the film _Hard to Hold_. He created the band The Be Five with other _Babylon 5_ actors.[10]

Mumy has released a number of solo CDs, including _Dying to Be Heard_, _In the Current_, _Pandora's Box_, _After Dreams Come True_, _Los Angeles Times_ and _Ghosts_, as well as nine albums with music partner Robert Haimer as Barnes and Barnes.[11] Their most famous hit is the song "Fish Heads", which _Rolling Stone_ magazine named one of the top 100 videos of all time. He also performs with the Jenerators, a blues-rock band based in Los Angeles featuring Tom Hebenstreit on vocals, electric guitars, and keyboards; Mumy on vocals, acoustic and electric guitars, harmonica, keyboards and percussion; Gary Stockdale on vocals and bass; Miguel Ferrer on vocals, percussion and drums; David Jolliffe on guitar, percussion and vocals; and Chris Ross on drums and percussion. Additionally, Mumy released a Byrds-tribute song, "When Roger Was Jim" (2012). In 2017, along with John Cowsill (The Cowsills) and Vicki Peterson (The Bangles) he founded the band Action Skulls. Their first CD (_Angels Hear_), which also included posthumous contributions from the bassist Rick Rosas, was released on September 27, 2017.[12]

Mumy produces and hosts _The Real Good Radio Hour_, a weekly series on KSAV Internet Radio focusing on various styles of music and the artists who pioneered them.[13]


_Lost in Space_ activities in later years

In 1996, Mumy and his _Lost in Space_ costar Jonathan Harris were reunited at a Walt Disney convention in Orlando, Florida. Mumy worked again with Harris on the retrospective special _Lost In Space: Forever_ (1998), where they reprised their roles in a scene written by Mumy (Harris rewrote his own lines). This occurred the year after the rest of the cast (including both Mumy and Harris) stated in a _TV Guide_ article that the Sci Fi Channel planned to do a _Lost in Space_ marathon while promoting a new movie. Harris was to appear in the planned TV movie, _Lost in Space: The Journey Home_, but died before production was scheduled to start, in 2002, and it was subsequently cancelled. Mumy read the eulogy at Harris' funeral and was asked to narrate an account of his longtime friend's life on A&E _Biography_ that year.

In a 2010 interview on _Blog Talk Radio_'s _Lessons Learned_, Rick Tocquigny was asked if Mumy was a Jonathan Harris fan before they appeared together on _Lost in Space_. Tocquigny said that at age five, Mumy was too young to watch his mentor's show _The Third Man_, which would have been aired late at night, but he was old enough to see _The Bill Dana Show_.[14]

On June 14, 2006, Mumy got to work with Harris one last time, though posthumously. Years before Harris died, he recorded voice work for the animated short _The Bolt Who Screwed Christmas,_ narrating the film and playing the part of The Bolt. As a tribute to Harris, writer-director John Wardlaw added a scene that reunited _Lost in Space_ cast members Mumy, Marta Kristen, and Angela Cartwright as the animated Ratchett family.[15]

In May 2013, 11 years after Harris' death in November 2002, Mumy commented on his connection with his friend and acting mentor offscreen and their onscreen connection while working in character as Will Robinson and Dr. Smith onscreen, in _Lost in Space_. Mumy noted: "I never really had too many uncomfortable moments working with any actor. I was comfortable working with most everybody. It’s just the more that Jonathan and I did together, the more he changed the character. He really changed the character of Dr. Smith himself. He really turned him from a snarling saboteur villain to this bumbling insulting kook. The more he played it for comedy, the more Irwin Allen liked it. The show really went the way that Jonathan led it. But we had great chemistry together, and we never had a bad day. We were always prepared, as was Bobby May who was inside the robot. When we had our work to do—and I think this is a very big reason [for] the way it went—they’d get us done in a couple of takes. Nobody screwed up. It was easier for the crew and it was easier for us, and people seemed to like it."[16]

Mumy attends _Lost in Space_ reunions and shows, and co-authored a 2015 book, _Lost (and Found) in Space_ with Angela Cartwright.[17]


Other work

Mumy and co-author Peter David published the short story, "The Black '59" (1992), in the anthology _Shock Rock_, edited by F. Paul Wilson.[18]


Personal life

Mumy, his wife, Eileen, and their two acting children, Seth (b. 1989) and Liliana (b. 1994), live in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles.[19][20]
