History

On the death of Raj Chandrasinghji of Halvad, his eldest son Prathiraj was, according to custom, holding Wadhwan in maintenance. He was the sister's son of the Chudasama Rao of Bhadli. But Chandrasinghji's other two sons Askaranji and Amarsinghji were sons of Satbhama daughter of Maharaja Sursingji of Jodhpur, and they, with the aid of the Ahmedabad viceroy captured Prathiraj who was carried off a prisoner to Ahmedabad, where he subsequently died. His two sons Sultanji and Rajoji escaping sought refuge at Bhadli. Askaranji now mounted the Halvad _gadi_ but was shortly after assassinated by his brother Amarsinghji who succeeded him. Sultanji and Rajoji now went into outlawry against Amarsinghji, and Sultanji finally conquered the Vankaner Chorasi which is held by his descendants till British period. Rajoji conquered Wadhwan and ruled there. Rajoji had three sons, Sabalsingh who succeeded him at Wadhwan, Udayasingh and Bhavsinghji who went to Haravati. Bhavsinghji had a son Madhavsinghji who had three sons Madavsingh, Arjausingh, and Abhyesingh. Udayasingh killed his brother Sabalsingh and usurped the _gadi_ and was succeeded by his son Bhagatsingh. But Arjausingh and Abhyesingh returned from Haravati and killed Bhagatsingh, and divided the estate, Arjansinghji retaining Wadhwan and Abhyesinghji taking Chuda. Their descendants rule at Wadhwan and Chuda respectively till British period. The celebrated Jalamsingh who founded the chiefdom of Jhalera Patan, was a descendant of Madavsingh.[1]

Chuda was acquired in 1706-07 AD when Kumar Shri Abhaisinhji Madhavsinhji, a younger brother of Thakore Sahib Shri Arjansinhji Madhavsinhji of Wadhwan, became its first Thakur Shri. Abhyesingh was succeeded by Raisinghji in 1747 and he was slain by the Kathis of Paliad in 1768 and was succeeded by Gajsinghji who was also killed by the Paliad Kathis in 1780. He was succeeded by his son Hathisinghji who repulsed the Kathis and ruled till 1820. In his time British Colonel Walker's perpetual settlement was made with the East India Company. He was succeeded by his son Abyesinghji II., who lived till 1826 and was succeeded by his son Raisingliji II., who ruled till 1844, when he was succeeded by his son Becharsinghji.[2]

This branch of the Jhala Rajput clan dynasty ruled 14 villages, covering 202 Square Kilometers km². It yielded 160,000Rs of state revenue in 1921.

During the British raj, it was a third class state under the colonial Eastern Kathiawar Agency.[3]

It ceased to exist on 15 February 1948 by accession to newly independent India's Saurashtra State. The privy purse was fixed at 51,250 Rupees. The Rajput line of nominal Thakurs in continued.
