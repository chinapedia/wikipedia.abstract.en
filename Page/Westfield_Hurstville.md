History

Westfield Hurstville officially opened on 9 October 1978 by then NSW Premier Neville Wran. The centre was first announced in 1975 with a cost of $30 million was hailed as “the start of a new and greater shopping era for St George”. It was a joint venture between the council and Westfield.[2]

The centre featured Coles New World, Waltons (originally located at Southside Plaza at Rockdale), Nock & Kirby, Franklins and Best & Less. It was the first shopping centre in Australia to feature a quiet park on top of the centre. The park was known as Snowy Hill Park which was named after former alderman and mayor of Hurstville, Gordon William 'Snowy' Hill. Hill who served 19 years at the council, being elected mayor in 1962 and 1963. He died on 2 June 1978. The decision to name the park in recognition of Hill's services to the local community was made at a Special Hurstville Municipal Meeting shortly after his death. A pedestrian ramp from Croft's Avenue was constructed to allow pedestrian access to the park from street level. The park was officially opened by Mr Kevin Ryan MLA, former mayor of Hurstville, on 7 April 1979 and was popular for shoppers who wanted a quiet break from shopping. In 1987, the Waltons chain was sold by Alan Bond to the Cookes family in which the remaining stores split into Venture and Norman Ross.[3]

Westfield Hurstville was redeveloped extended across Park Road towards The Avenue with a retail bridge linking both sides of the centre in the 1990s. Grace Bros, Kmart, Greater Union cinema and 125 speciality stores were added to the centre as part of the extension. The celebration of the opening of the redevelopment and the opening of Grace Bros was held on 10 April 1990. The opening of the store was popular with hundreds of locals queuing up to snap up a bargain which took one hour for the store to make $51,000 in sales. The Grace Bros store was originally planned to open in the Southside Plaza at Rockdale, but due to David Jones planning to open a Hurstville store, with a possible site near the current location of Hurstville Library on Queens Road, Grace Bros amended the plan and opened at Hurstville. Venture, which took over Norman Ross, relocated from its original space to the space next to Grace Bros. Snowy Hill park was later converted to the rooftop carpark. After the redevelopment of the centre, shops on Forest Road started to decline after the centre took trade away from the street and the plans for a pedestrian mall on Forest Road, to be known as Forest Road Mall or Hurstville Boulevard, were proposed.

During the 1990s, many high-end stores and stores such as Brashs and Intencity closed. Intencity previously opened in 1995 and was the first in the chain to open on the space vacated by BBC Hardware and part of Waltons until it was taken over by Target in 1997.[4] The Toys "R" Us store (which replaced the two-level Venture store in 1993) shrunk to become a one-level store with the bottom level of the store taken over by Rebel Sport which then was taken over by Aldi. Franklins closed in 2001 and was taken over by Food For Less in 2002 and operated until November 2015 when Woolworths opened at the other end of the centre. Food For Less was taken over by Tong Li Supermarket and a medical centre. Grace Bros (renamed to Myer in 2004) became sole department store until its closure in early 2015. Despite having many variety stores added, the centre was criticized in the 2010s for lack of high-end retailers, department stores and having too many discount and cheap stores. It was also criticized for being run down and in need of redevelopment.[5]


Recent development

In early 2015, Myer made a departure from the centre after deciding to not renew their lease and was followed by Toys "R" Us.[6][7][8] On March 2015, the centre underwent a $100 million redevelopment which was completed by 18 November 2015.[9][10] The centre celebrated the opening of the redevelopment on 19 November 2015. The redevelopment consists of:

-   A full line Woolworths and JB Hi-Fi on the bottom floor of the Myer space

Future

Apartments

Plans for six towers up to 20 storeys high and containing 1249 units could be built above the centre under a planning proposal before Georges River Council. The towers would be approximately 18 to 20 storeys above the existing centre from the top of the roof carpark and each tower would include 456 residential apartments, 793 mixed use units consisting of serviced apartments and student accommodation. There are also requests to increase the floor space of the development. If approved by the council, the planning proposal will go to the Department of Planning for Gateway before being put on exhibition for public comment. The plans are expected to be finalised by March, 2018.[12]
