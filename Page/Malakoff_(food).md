A MALAKOFF is a ball of fried cheese typically found in Western Switzerland, more specifically in the villages of Eysins, Begnins, Bursins, Luins, and Vinzel on the shores of Lake Geneva.[1] Malakoffs are sometimes served as an hors d'oeuvre.[2] The name comes from the Battle of Malakoff, the dish itself having been invented by negus Swiss mercenaries during the siege of Sevastopol.[3]
