The MOUTH OF THE AGUAPEÍ PRIVATE NATURAL HERITAGE RESERVE () is a private natural heritage reserve in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. It protects an area of marshland known as the "Pantanal of São Paulo" where the Aguapeí River enters the Paraná River.


Location

The Mouth of the Aguapeí Private Natural Heritage Reserve (RPPN) is divided between the municipalities of Castilho, São João do Pau d'Alho and Pauliceia in the state of São Paulo. It has an area of . It is located at the mouth of the Aguapeí River on the Paraná River, and the Ilha Comprida. It forms a continuous protected area with the Aguapeí State Park, which is part of the environmental compensation for the Eng Sérgio Motta Dam.

The reserve protects one of the last naturally flooded areas of the state, home to marsh deer and other species typical of this environment. It should reduce sand and clay mining, and strengthen enforcement against hunting the deer for sale of antlers or stuffed heads. The reserve supports environmental education and research.


Environment

The reserve is covered by secondary growth of seasonal semi-deciduous forest, arboreal/shrub/herbaceous formations in the várzea areas, and areas of riparian palms. Vegetation includes the vulnerable _Euterpe edulis_ (_Jussara palmito_). Vulnerable, threatened or endangered fauna include horned screamer (_Anhima cornuta_), wood stork (_Mycteria americana_), black-collared hawk (_Busarellus nigricollis_), jabiru (_Jabiru mycteria_), American pygmy kingfisher (_Chloroceryle aenea_), toco toucan (_Ramphastos toco_), blue-and-yellow macaw (_Ara ararauna_) and South American tapir (_Tapirus terrestris_).

The "Pantanal Paulista Wildlife Refuge", as it was called in earlier discussions, would be part of the proposed Trinational Biodiversity Corridor, which aims to provide forest connections between conservation units in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina in the Upper Paraná ecoregion.
