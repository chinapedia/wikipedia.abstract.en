Critical reception

The reviews for the album have generally been positive and a taste of fresh songs in the Philippine music industry. Chito Bakamo of Wordpress has stated; "The first time I saw Nadine Lustre sa Diary Ng Panget, she is sooooo funny. Tawa ako ng tawa (I laughed so much). Then i heard her sing sa soundtrack, sounds amazing and i fall in love sa kanya (in a big fan level). Now, she got her own album simply titled “Nadine Lustre” and its really worthy. Alam kong lima lang ang tracks nitong album na ito pero she made my head bang (I know that this album only has five tracks, but she made my head bang). To the dance tracks “Para-Paraan” which is so teen pop and “Me & You”, the only English song, to “Mr. Antipatiko” and “Aba Bakit Hindi?” na super kilig ang lyrics (yup call me corny but this song i really like) and “Bahala Na” that gives you na meron talagang forever. Hahaha! Wagi itong album na ito para sa akin." [10]
