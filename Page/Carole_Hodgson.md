CAROLE HODGSON (born 1940 in London) is an English sculptor.


Biography

Hodgson studied at the Wimbledon School of Art from 1957 to 1962 and at the Slade School of Fine Art from 1962 to 1964.[1] She is an Emeritus Professor of Fine Art and Sculpture Kingston University and a fellow of the Royal British Society of Sculptors.[2]

For over 40 years, Hodgson has drawn upon the landscape as the central source of inspiration for her work. Her distinctive vision of the natural world, expressed with precision and clarity in her sculpture and drawings, reflects a finely tuned sensitivity to her surroundings.[3] Her range of materials and subjects are eclectic taking inspiration from and array of subject matter such as the ancient sculptures of Greece, to the Welsh landscapes.[4]

Hodgson has exhibited at the Flowers Gallery, UK since 1973 which culminated in a major retrospective of her work at the gallery in 2015.[5]

To accompany the exhibition, Joan Bakewell wrote:

_We seek the stillness of remote places to soothe our panic at global combust. We find in the deep reaches of rock and ravine a balm to modern anxieties. Hodgson's work both derives from and pays regard to these present sensibilities._[6]

Hodgson’s major public sculptures include the _River Celebration_,[7] commissioned in 1989 for Kingston upon Thames, a bronze sculpture sited on the Old London Road at the Junction of Queen Elizabeth Road. She has had major solo shows in leading museums and galleries in Britain and around the world>[8][9]
