Production and release

_Chaos;Child_ is an adaptation of the video game of the same name, and was produced at the animation studio Silver Link. It was directed by Masato Jinbo, who also was in charge of the series composition, while Kazuyuki Yamayoshi was the chief animation director and handled the adaptation of the character designs for animation. The music was composed by Takeshi Abo and Onoken;[17] the former also composed the music for the _Chaos;Child_ game.[18] The opening theme song, "Uncontrollable", was performed by Kanako Itō, while the ending theme, "Chaos Syndrome", was performed by Konomi Suzuki.[19] The main cast members from the _Chaos;Child_ game reprised their roles for the anime, and were joined by new actors for other characters.[20]

Chiyomaru Shikura, the Representative Director of the _Chaos;Child_ game's development company, had originally wanted to make the anime series two cours long, like the _Steins;Gate_ anime adaptation, but it was determined impossible business-wise, so it was decided to produce it as a one-cours series. Due to this lower episode count, they were unable to adapt the character routes from the game's branching narrative. Shikura mentioned that he had particularly wanted to see the Sumo Sticker giant and the appearance of _Chaos;Head_ protagonist Takumi from Hana's route adapted as part of the _Chaos;Child_ anime.[21]

The series was announced in March 2015,[22] and premiered on AT-X on January 11, 2017 as a one-hour special;[23] the series also airs on Tokyo MX, Sun TV, Chiba TV, TVK, TVS, KBS and BS11.[24] It was simulcast worldwide outside of Asian countries by Funimation and Crunchyroll, with an English dub released starting on January 31, 2017.[25] The series is planned to be released on DVD and Blu-ray in Japan by Kadokawa Corporation in six volumes, between March 24 and August 25, 2017; the first volume will come bundled with an audio drama.[26] The singles for the opening and ending themes were published on January 25 and February 22, 2017, respectively.[27] To coincide with the anime and the release of the spin-off video game _Chaos;Child Love Chu Chu!!_, the _Chaos;Child_ game got a budget-priced re-release in March 2017.[28]

After the conclusion of the 12th and final episode, a 13th episode based on the "Silent Sky" ending of the game was announced, and was shown in Japanese theaters between June 17, 2017 and June 30, 2017.[29]


Reception

Previews

Richard Eisenbeis of Anime Now called the series his most anticipated anime of the season, being curious about how it would handle the adaptation of a branching story into a single one.[30] Bamboo Dong, Paul Jensen, Rebecca Silverman and Theron Martin at Anime News Network reviewed episode 0 and 1 as part of a preview of that anime season. Dong did not expect the anime's ending to be good, but was still interested in how the story would turn out, and appreciated the use of _Chaos;Head_-like visuals and atmosphere. Jensen did not, however, think the atmosphere worked, saying that it seemed like the show was intended to give a feeling of dread, but that it failed to do so, partially due to the large amount of information communicated to the viewer. Silverman thought episode 1, with the exception of some sequences, felt bland, but still worth watching for a few more episodes to get a grasp of what direction the story would take. Martin thought the story moved slightly too fast, resulting in some character motivations being weakly established. He enjoyed the visuals and music, but said that the character design, while attractive, looked unoriginal.[31]

Series reception

Anime Now included _Chaos;Child_ on a list of the five "must-watch" anime of the season, citing the high tension and weirdness of the story and the complexity of the characters.[32]
