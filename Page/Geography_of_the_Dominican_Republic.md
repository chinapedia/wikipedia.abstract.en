The DOMINICAN REPUBLIC (Spanish: _República Dominicana_) is a country in the West Indies that occupies the eastern five-eighths of Hispaniola. It has an area of 48,670 km², including offshore islands. The land border shared with Haiti, which occupies the western three-eighths of the island,[1][2] is 376 km long.[3] The maximum length, east to west, is 390 km from Punta de Agua to Las Lajas, on the border with Haiti. The maximum width, north to south, is 265 km from Cape Isabela to Cape Beata.[4] The capital, Santo Domingo, is located on the south coast.

The Dominican Republic's shores are washed by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and the Caribbean Sea to the south. The Mona Passage, a channel about 130 km wide, separates the country (and Hispaniola) from Puerto Rico.[5]

Climate

of the Dominican Republic]] The country is a tropical, maritime nation. Conditions are ameliorated in many areas by elevation and by the northeast trade winds, which blow steadily from the Atlantic all year long. The annual mean temperature is ; regional mean temperatures range from in the heart of the Cordillera Central (Constanza) to as high as in arid regions. Temperatures rarely rise above , and freezing temperatures only occur in winter in the highest mountains. The average temperature in Santo Domingo in January is , and in July.

The rain season for the northern coast is from November to January. For the rest of the country, the rain season is from May to November. The average annual rainfall is , with extremes of or more in the mountainous northeast (the windward side of the island) and in the southwestern valleys. The western valleys, along the Haitian border, remain relatively dry, with less than of annual precipitation, due to the rain shadow effect caused by the central and northern mountain ranges. The northwestern and southeastern extremes of the country are also arid.

The Dominican Republic is occasionally damaged by tropical storms and hurricanes, which originate in the mid-Atlantic and southeastern Caribbean from June until November (mainly from August to October) each year.


Islands

There are several smaller islands and cays that are part of the Dominican territory. The largest islands are:

1.  _Saona_, close to the southeastern coast of the Hispaniola, in the Caribbean Sea. It has an area of 117 km².[8] Its Taíno name was _Iai_ [9] or _Adamanay_. Columbus named this island as Savona after the Italian city of the same name but the use during years has eliminated the letter _v_.
2.  _Beata_, in the southern coast of the Hispaniola, in the Caribbean Sea. It has an area of 27 km².[10] Its Taíno name is unknown. Columbus named this island as _Madama Beata_.
3.  _Catalina_, very close to the southeastern coast of the Hispaniola, in the Caribbean Sea. It has an area of 9.6 km².[11] Its Taíno name was _Iabanea_[12] but some writers, including poets, say that it was called _Toeya_ or _Toella_. It was discovered by Columbus who named it _Santa Catalina_.


Relief

The Dominican Republic is a country with many mountains, and the highest peaks of the West Indies are found here. The chains of mountains show a direction northwest-southeast, except in the Southern peninsula (in Haiti) where they have a direction west–east. The mountains are separated by valleys with the same general direction.

From north to south, the mountain ranges and valleys are:[13]

-   _Cordillera Septentrional_ (in English, "Northern Range"). It runs parallel to the north coast, with extensions to the northwest, the Tortuga Island, and to the southeast, the Samaná Peninsula (with its _Sierra de Samaná_). Its highest mountain is Diego de Ocampo, close to Santiago, with 1,249 m. There are several small plains between this range and the Atlantic Ocean. Rivers are short and most of them flow to the north.
-   The _Cibao_ Valley (Dominican Republic) is the largest and the most important valley of the country. This long valley stretches from North Haiti, where is called _Plaine du Nord_, to Samaná Bay. It can be divided in two sections: the northwestern part is the _Yaque del Norte Valley_ (or _Línea Noroeste_) and the eastern _Yuna Valley_ (or _Vega Real_, English: _Royal Valley_). The _Vega Real_ is the most fertile area in the country, with a high population density.
-   The _Cordillera Central_ (also called _Sierra del Cibao_) is the island's most rugged and imposing feature and is known in Haiti as the _Massif du Nord_ ("Northern Massif"). The highest mountains of the West Indies are in this range: Pico Duarte, 3,098 m, and others above 3,000 m. Near the center of the island, this range turns southward and is called _Sierra de Ocoa_, finishing near the city of Azua de Compostela, on the Caribbean coast. Another branch, _Cordillera Oriental_ or _Sierra del Seibo_, is separated from the main chain by a karstic region (_Los Haitises_) and with a west–east direction; it is located south of Samaná Bay.
-   The _San Juan Valley_ and _Plain of Azua_ are big valleys south of the _Cordillera Central_ with altitude from 0 to 600 m.
-   The _Sierra de Neiba_, with Mount Neiba the highest mountain with 2,279 m. An extension to the southeast of _Sierra de Neiba_ is the _Sierra Martín García_ (_Loma Busú_, 1,350 m).
-   The _Hoya de Enriquillo_ or _Neiba Valley_ is a remarkable valley, with a west–east direction, of low altitude (on average 50 m with some points below sea level) and with a great salt lake: the _Enriquillo Lake_.
-   The _Sierra de Bahoruco_, called _Massif de la Selle_ in Haiti. This southern group of mountains have a geology very different from the rest of the island.
-   _Llano Costero del Caribe_ (in English, "Caribbean Coastal Plain") is in the southeast of the island (and of the Dominican Republic). It is a large prairie east of Santo Domingo.


Rivers and lakes

The 8 longest rivers of the Dominican Republic are:[14]

1.  _Yaque del Norte_. With 296 km, it is the longest river of the Dominican Republic. Its sources are in the Cordillera Central and flows to the Atlantic Ocean. Its watershed has an area of 7,044 km².
2.  _Yuna_. It is 209 km long. Its sources are in the Cordillera Central and flows to the east into Samaná Bay. Its watershed has an area of 5,498 km².
3.  _Yaque del Sur_. It is 183 km long and its sources are in the Cordillera Central. It flows to the south into the Caribbean Sea. Its watershed has an area of 4,972 km².
4.  _Ozama_. It is 148 km long. Its sources are in Sierra de Yamasá (a branch of the Cordillera Central). It flows into the Caribbean Sea. Its watershed has an area of 2,685 km².
5.  _Camú_. It is 137 km long. Its sources are in the Cordillera Central and flows into the Yuna River. Its watershed has 2,655 km².
6.  _Nizao_. It is 133 km long. Its sources are in the Cordillera Central and flows to the south into the Caribbean Sea. Its watershed has an area of 974 km².
7.  _San Juan_. It is 121 km long. Its sources are in the Cordillera Central and flows to the south into the Yaque del Sur River. Its watershed has an area of 2,005 km².
8.  _Mao_. It is 105 km long. Its sources are in the Cordillera Central and flows to the north into the Yaque del Norte River. Its watershed has an area of 864 km².

The Artibonite River is the longest river of the island but only 68 km are in the Dominican Republic.

The largest lake of the Hispaniola, and of the West Indies, is the _Lake Enriquillo_. It is located in the _Hoya de Enriquillo_ with an area of 265 km². There are three small islands within the lake. It is around 40 meters below sea level and is a saline lake with a higher concentration of salt than the sea water.

Others lakes are _Rincón_ (fresh water, area of 28.2 km²), _Oviedo_ (brackish water, area of 28 km²), _Redonda_, _Limón_.
