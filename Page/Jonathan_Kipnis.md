JONATHAN KIPNIS is the Harrison Distinguished Teaching Professor and Chair of the Department of Neuroscience, and Director of the Center for Brain Immunology and Glia at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. He studies the interaction of the immune system with the nervous system and has been the senior author of a number of landmark papers in this field.[1] His lab currently is studying several diverse topics within this subject, including CNS injury, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers and multiple sclerosis,[2] cognitive and mental disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and Rett syndrome.

Kipnis joined the faculty at UVA in 2007 and was made chair of the Department of Neuroscience in 2016. He earned his Ph.D. from the Weizmann Institute of Science in the lab of Michal Schwartz,[3] and upon graduating in 2004, he received the Prize of Excellence from the Weizmann Institute of Science and a distinguished prize for scientific achievements awarded by the Israeli Parliament, The Knesset.[4]


Discoveries

Meningeal lymphatic vessels

Kipnis is credited with the 2014 discovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels, a recently discovered network of conventional lymphatic vessels located parallel to the dural sinuses and meningeal arteries of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). As a part of the lymphatic system, the meningeal lymphatics are responsible for draining immune cells, small molecules, and excess fluid from the CNS and into the deep cervical lymph nodes.

While it was initially believed that both the brain and meninges were devoid of lymphatic vasculature, the landmark Nature paper by Jonathan Kipnis and his postdoctoral fellow Antoine Louveau was published in 2015. By 2017, this paper was cited nearly 600 times, putting it in the 99th percentile for articles published that year.[5]

His discovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels has attracted attention from many sources, and was touted as a scientific breakthrough in lists such as Scientific American's "Top 10 Science Stories of 2015", Science Magazine's "Breakthrough of the Year", Huffington Post's "Eight Fascinating Things We Learned About the Mind in 2015" and the National Institutes of Health's director Francis Collins year end review.[6][7] Business Insider highlighted this as the biggest discovery ever made in Virginia.[8]

Other discoveries

Other high-profile research has included the 2015 discovery that the immune system directly affects social behavior and that IFN-gamma is necessary for social development.[9][10] This expands upon his work as a graduate student, when he discovered that mice lacking T-cells had cognitive impairments.[11][12]

He is the senior author of a 2015 paper describing how CD4+ T-cells protect and repair neurons after injury to the spinal cord and brain.[13] A collaboration with Kodi Ravichandran characterized the generation of neurons in adult brains and the removal of dead neurons by phagocytic cells.[14]

In 2016, he was the senior author on a paper identifying type 2 innate lymphocytes in the meninges near the lymphatic vessels his lab previously discovered. These cells have previously have been found in the gut, which suggests a link between the brain and the microbiome.[15] In mice, these meningeal ILC2 cells were activated by IL-33 after spinal cord injury.[16]


Grants and awards

His work has been funded by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative,[17] National Institutes of Health, the Hartwell Foundation, and the Cure Alzheimer's Fund.[18] In 2018, he was awarded the NIH's prestigious Director's Pioneer Award and $5.6 million in additional research funding.[19]

He is a Gutenberg Forschungskolleg Fellow and supervises a working group at the University of Mainz.[20] He received the Robert Ader New Investigator Award for 2011 by the PsychoNeuroImmunology Research Society and the 2012 Jordi Folch-Pi award by the American Society for Neurochemistry. He was a MIND Institute Distinguished Lecturer in 2016.[21] He is a section editor of the Journal of Immunology.[22]
