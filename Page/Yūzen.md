Kimono_detail_2.jpg is a Japanese dyeing technique for fabrics.


History

Silk-weaving families can be traced to the 15th century in the famous Nishijin weaving center of Kyoto, where elegant fabrics worn by the emperor and the aristocracy were produced. In the 17th century, designs on textiles were applied using stencils and rice paste, in the _yūzen_ or paste-resist method of dyeing. The _yūzen_ method provided an imitation of aristocratic brocades, which were forbidden to commoners by sumptuary laws.[1]

Moriguchi Kako of Kyoto has continued to create works of art in his _yūzen_-dyed _kimono_, which were so sought after that the contemporary fashion industry designed an industrial method to copy them for use on Western-style clothing. Famous designers, such as Hanae Mori, borrowed extensively from _kimono_ patterns for their couturier collections. By the late 1980s, an elegant, handwoven, dyed _kimono_ had become extremely costly, running to US$25,000 for a formal garment. In Okinawa the famous _yūzen_-dyeing method was especially effective where it was produced in the _bingata_ stencil-dyeing techniques, which produced exquisitely colored, striking designs as artistic national treasures.

Other methods of resist dyeing are _rōketsuzome_ with wax, _katazome_ and _tsutsugaki_ with rice-paste.[2]

_Birodo yūzen_, or _yūzen birodo_, describes velvet dyed and painted using the _yūzen_ process where the pile is cut away in deep and light layers, creating a painterly effect of light and shade.[3] The technique first appeared in the nineteenth century and was described in 1905 by Basil Hall Chamberlain.[4] Although Chamberlain describes the technique under the heading of embroidery, _birodo yūzen_ is not actually embroidered, but uses a cut-velvet technique to reproduce paintings and photographs.[5] Although technically a form of velvet painting, _birodo yūzen_ works are not like the Western and Middle-Eastern velvet paintings which use velvet as a canvas.
