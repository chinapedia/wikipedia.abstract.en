CASTLE ROCK was a historic unincorporated community, post office, and railway station in Morrow County, Oregon, United States.[1] They were named for a low bluff along the Columbia River that was said to look like a castle as seen from the river.[2]

The Castle Rock railroad station opened in 1881, and the post office operated from 1883 to 1926. Lake Umatilla, formed in 1968 behind the John Day Dam on the Columbia, inundated the bluff, the railroad bed and the adjacent highway.[3] The railroad station was subsequently moved to higher elevation about a mile south and renamed _Castle_.[4][5] Castle Rock was above sea level,[6] whereas Castle is at .[7]
