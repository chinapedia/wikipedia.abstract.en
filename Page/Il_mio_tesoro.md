Libretto

Il mio tesoro intanto andate a consolar, E del bel ciglio il pianto cercate di asciugar.

Ditele che i suoi torti a vendicar io vado; Che sol di stragi e morti nunzio vogl'io tornar. My treasure, meanwhile, Go and console. And from her beautiful eyes, the tears, Try to wipe away.

Tell her that the wrongs against her, I'm going to avenge, That only of killing and death As announcer will I return.
