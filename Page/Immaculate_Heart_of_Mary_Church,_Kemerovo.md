History

The priests of the Congregation of the Redemptorists have been active in the area of Kuzbass since 1996, but congregations were held in private apartments. The first Mass was held on December 22, 1996 in a rented room of the house of culture. The parish had to wait ten years before receiving permission to build a church, which was consecrated on September 27, 2009 in honor of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, with the participation of Bishop Joseph Werth, head of the diocese.
