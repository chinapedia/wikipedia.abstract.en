FREDERICK HOWARD WHALLEY (8 October 1898 – 25 April 1976) was an English professional football goalkeeper who played in the Football League for Leeds United, Grimsby Town, Preston North End and Fulham.[1]


Personal life

Whalley enlisted as a reservist in the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment of the British Army in November 1913, whilst working as a cotton spinner.[2] After Britain's declaration of war on Germany in August 1914, he was mobilised and arrived on the Western Front one month later.[3] Whalley saw action through the winter operations of 1914–1915, but was court-martialed in January 1915 for falling asleep at his post.[4] He was sentenced to one year's hard labour and owing to a case of trench foot, he served his sentence in Britain.[5] Whalley returned to the front in January 1916 and was again evacuated after another case of trench foot, before being transferred to the King's Regiment (Liverpool) and then to the Labour Corps in March 1917.[6] He was discharged in December 1918, one month after the Armistice.[7] After his retirement from football in the mid-1920s he became a policeman in Preston and later lived in Eccles.[8]
