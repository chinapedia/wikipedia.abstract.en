SÉBASTIEN MAZÉ (born 8 February 1984) is a French chess grandmaster and coach.

Born in Paris, he learned to play chess from his mother at the age of 8. He achieved the titles of International Master in 2003 and Grandmaster in 2007. He finished second to Russian grandmaster Evgeny Alekseev in the very strong Biel Chess Festival in 2008, and followed it up with fourth place at the French championship (won by Étienne Bacrot). This qualified him from the French Olympiad team in Dresden that year, where he scored 3.5/6.

In 2009 and 2010, he acted as second to Étienne Bacrot in the tournaments at Elista, Dortmund and Nanjing. Since 2011 he has been a contributor to the book series _Chess Evolution_.[1]

He was appointed coach of the French chess team in 2013, leading them to a silver medal at the 2013 European Team Chess Championship in Warsaw.
