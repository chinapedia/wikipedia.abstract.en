RichardBachman.jpg of Kirby McCauley, who was King's literary agent.]] RICHARD BACHMAN is a pen name used by horror fiction author Stephen King.


Origin

At the beginning of Stephen King's career, the general view among publishers was that an author was limited to one book per year, since publishing more would be unacceptable to the public. King therefore wanted to write under another name, in order to increase his publication without over-saturating the market for the King "brand". He convinced his publisher, Signet Books, to print these novels under a pseudonym.[1]

In his introduction to _The Bachman Books,_ King states that adopting the nom de plume Bachman was also an attempt to make sense out of his career and try to answer the question of whether his success was due to talent or luck. He says he deliberately released the Bachman novels with as little marketing presence as possible and did his best to "load the dice against" Bachman. King concludes that he has yet to find an answer to the "talent versus luck" question, as he felt he was outed as Bachman too early to know. The Bachman book _Thinner_ (1984) sold 28,000 copies during its initial run—and then ten times as many when it was revealed that Bachman was, in fact, King.

The pseudonym King originally selected (Gus Pillsbury) is King's maternal grandfather's name, but at the last moment (due to the pseudonym being ousted) King changed it to Richard Bachman. Richard is a tribute to crime author Donald E. Westlake's long-running pseudonym Richard Stark. (The surname Stark _was_ later used in King's novel _The Dark Half,_ in which an author's malevolent pseudonym, "George Stark", comes to life.) Bachman was inspired by Bachman–Turner Overdrive, a rock and roll band King was listening to at the time his publisher asked him to choose a pseudonym on the spot.[2]

King provided biographical details for Bachman, initially in the "about the author" blurbs in the early novels. Known "facts" about Bachman were that he was born in New York, served a four-year stint in the Coast Guard, which he then followed with ten years in the Merchant Marine. Bachman finally settled down in rural central New Hampshire, where he ran a medium-sized dairy farm, writing at night. His fifth novel was dedicated to his wife, Claudia Inez Bachman, who also received credit for the bogus author photo on the book jacket. Other "facts" about the author were revealed in publicity dispatches from Bachman's publishers: the Bachmans had one child, a boy, who died in an unfortunate, Stephen King-ish type accident at the age of six, when he fell through a well and drowned. In 1982, a brain tumour was discovered near the base of Bachman's brain; tricky surgery removed it. After Bachman's true identity was revealed, later publicity dispatches (and _about the author_ blurbs) revealed that Bachman died suddenly in late 1985 of "cancer of the pseudonym, a rare form of schizonomia".


Identification

King dedicated Bachman's early books—_Rage_ (1977), _The Long Walk_ (1979), _Roadwork_ (1981), and _The Running Man_ (1982)—to people close to him. The link between King and his shadow writer was exposed after a Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk, Steve Brown, noted similarities between the writing styles of King and Bachman. Brown located publisher's records at the Library of Congress which included a document naming King as the author of one of Bachman's novels. Brown wrote to King's publishers with a copy of the documents he had uncovered, and asked them what to do. Two weeks later, King telephoned Brown personally and suggested he write an article about how he discovered the truth, allowing himself to be interviewed.[3] At the time of the announcement in 1985, King was working on _Misery,_ which he had planned to release as a Bachman book.[4]


Post-outing

In 1987, the Bachman novel _The Running Man_ inspired the Paul Michael Glaser film of the same name. King insisted that his name not be on the credits, and the screen credit for the film went to Richard Bachman.

King used the "relationship" between himself and Bachman as a concept in his 1989 book _The Dark Half._ In the novel a writer's darker pseudonym takes on a life of its own. King dedicated _The Dark Half_ to "the late Richard Bachman." Originally there were plans to make the book a collaboration between the two, although this was later scrapped.[5]

In 1996, Bachman's _The Regulators_ came out, with the publishers claiming the book's manuscript was found among Bachman's leftover papers by his widow. It was released as a companion novel with King's _Desperation_; the two novels took place in different universes but featured many of the same characters. The two book covers were designed to be placed together to form a single picture. In the foreword by King included with _Desperation_ he said that there may be another Bachman novel left to be "found."

The next Bachman book to be "discovered" was _Blaze._ _Blaze_ was, in fact, an unpublished novel of King's written before _Carrie_ or the creation of Richard Bachman. For its publication King rewrote, edited, and updated the entire novel. It was published in 2007 under the Bachman pseudonym, with a foreword by King under his own name.

King has taken full ownership of the Bachman name on numerous occasions, as with the republication of the first four Bachman titles as _The Bachman Books: Four Early Novels by Stephen King_ in 1985. The introduction, titled "Why I Was Bachman", details the whole Bachman/King story. (In 1996, the collection was reissued with a new King essay, "The Importance of Being Bachman".)

Richard Bachman was also referred to in Stephen King's _The Dark Tower_ series of books. In the fifth book, _Wolves of the Calla,_ the sinister children's book _Charlie the Choo Choo_ is revealed to be written by "Claudia y Inez Bachman." The spelling discrepancy of the added 'y' was later explained as a deus ex machina on the part of "The White" (a force of good throughout King's _Tower_ series) to bring the total number of letters in her name to nineteen, a number prominent in King's series. In the next novel of the series, _Song of Susannah,_ Stephen King briefly discusses his Richard Bachman pseudonym.

After the Heath High School shooting, King announced that he would allow _Rage_ to go out of print, fearing that it might inspire similar tragedies. _Rage_ for a time continued to be available in the United Kingdom in _The Bachman Books_ collection, although the collection now no longer contains _Rage_.[6] In a footnote to the preface of _Blaze,_ dated 30 January 2007, King wrote of _Rage_: "Now out of print, and a good thing." King's other Bachman novels are available in the US in separate volumes.

In 2010, King appeared on the FX television show _Sons of Anarchy_ in a cameo role. His character, named Bachman, performed contract work quietly disposing of deceased bodies.

In issue 29 of the comic adaptation of _The Stand_, Richard (Rich) Bachman appears as one of the top lieutenants of Randall Flagg,[7] replacing the character of Whitney Horgan from the original novel. He is drawn to resemble King.

In the 2013 _Grimm_ episode "Nameless", Richard Bachman being a pseudonym of Stephen King was a plot point. King's novel, _Rage_, had its title page used as a prop for the killer to write a note to the police.
