STANNINGLEY RAILWAY STATION, also called _Stanningley for Farsley_, is a closed railway station in Stanningley, Pudsey, West Yorkshire, England, located about west of Leeds station. It also served Farsley[1] and Pudsey, the latter namely until the Pudsey Loop was built.

It was opened on 1 August 1854 as a station on the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway, later part of the GNR, from Leeds Central station to Bradford Adolphus Street. On 1 April 1878 a branch from Stanningley to Pudsey Greenside was opened which eventually evolved into the Pudsey Loop.[2] Having been renamed into _Stanningley for Farsley_, the station name reverted to _Stanningley_ in 1961. Stanningley railway station closed on 1 January 1968,[3] while the line itself has remained open, with trains of the Calder Valley Line passing the site of the former station.

The goods shed has survived almost intact and is used by a buildersâ€™ merchant,[4] while the station building is used as business premises. In its function as a railway station for Farsley, it has been replaced by New Pudsey railway station which is situated about 1 mile further west.
