Baumann's main aim was to see handball again on the Olympic Programme which he also completed but not able to witness it himself. He died due to heart attack in Basel (Switzerland) on 7 February 1971, one year and a half before the Olympic Handball Tournament in Munich.

After his death and seeing his great contribution to the development of handball worldwide, the IHF Council and Royal Spanish Handball Federation together created an award named Hans Baumann Trophy which would be awarded biannually during IHF Congress to the member federations for their outstanding contribution to the development of Handball in their country or through world. In 2016, the award was re-established and renamed by IHF Council as IHF President's Development Award.
