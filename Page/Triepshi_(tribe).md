TRIEPSHI (; ) is a region in Montenegro above the right northern bank of the Cem river near the Albanian border whose territory is synonymous with the historic Albanian tribe of the same name.[1]


History

Triepshi was first mentioned in 1485 in an Ottoman register of the Sanjak of Scutari.[2] Triepshi is remembered for its resistance to Ottoman incursions in the region, in particular in 1717 when they killed 62 Ottoman soldiers. Ottoman forces are said to have after this disaster left the region until 1862. At this time the Triepshi had good relations with Kuči tribe and the Petrović-Njegoš dynasty, the rulers of Montenegro. The tribesmen often went to Cetinje to bring the heads of Ottomans that they have cut off in battles, and so to receive compensation and presents.[3]

Tripesh was annexed to Montenegro in 1878 at a time of the Congress of Berlin, but the border remained vague for quite a while. Some of the Triepshi fled to Ottoman Albania whereas some stayed in Montenegro.[4]


Ethnography

The Triepshi tribe derives its origin from a man called _Keq Preka_ who fled to what is now Piperi territory in Montenegro and settled there either before the Ottoman invasion or around 1520. He had several sons, _Lazar Keqi_, _Ban Keqi_, _Kaster Keqi_, _Merkota Keqi_, _Vas Keqi_ and _Piper Keqi_. The second son, Ban Keqi, is considered to be direct ancestral father of the Triepshi tribe, whereas his brother Lazar Keqi was the ancestor father of the Hoti tribe, which is thus related to Triepshi. Lazar Keqi settled in Trabojna and Ban Keqi settled in Muzheçk and was buried in Nikmarash. Some members of the tribe derived their origins from Ivan Crnojević, and the old families of Delaj claimed they steemed from Herzegovina.[5]

According to a priest asked by Johann Georg von Hahn, the Hoti and Triepshi were Albanians because they spoke Albanian and were Catholics.[6]
