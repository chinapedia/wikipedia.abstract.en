CRESTED BUTTE COMMUNITY SCHOOL (CBCS) is a K-12 school in Crested Butte, CO serving Crested Butte, Mt. Crested Butte, and many areas of unincorporated Gunnison County.


History

CBCS was originally built in 1997 and was designed by the same architects as the school in Telluride, CO. Plans were made to expand and remodel the building in 2008.[1] Construction for the new portion of the building began in 2009, and would significantly increase the number of classrooms, expand the size of the auditorium space, and improve the athletic facilities.[2] In 2018, enrollment reached an unprecedented level, over 760 students, with more growth projected. Modular classrooms were needed in addition to the renovated building to accommodate the student population.[3]
