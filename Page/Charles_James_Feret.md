He is known among historians of London as the author of an exhaustive three volume history of Fulham, published in 1900.[1]

The son of a haberdasher of French descent, Féret was born in Clerkenwell, London. During his childhood, the family moved west to Earl's Court. After school, he joined the Civil service and worked as a clerk in the India Office. He was of a studious disposition and by 21, he had a British Museum Library reader's ticket. At 26, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. While still at the India Office, and having moved to Fulham with his mother and sister some years earlier, he took up the part-time post of editor at the local paper, _The Fulham Chronicle_, which launched in 1888.[2]

His thousand page illustrated, _Fulham Old and New_, was well supported and was published by subscription by the Leadenhall Press in 1900.

In 1901, Féret not only left _The Chronicle_, but moved to Margate probably for better quality air and became an antique dealer. He never married, but adopted a young girl from an orphanage. After her death, he adopted a second daughter. He died in Margate of a heart attack.[3]
