FRANCISCO MANUEL RUANO BUSÁN (born 16 July 1974) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a right winger, and is the current manager of Betis Deportivo Balompié.


Playing career

Born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Ruano started playing football with UDA Gramenet in 1993, in Segunda División B. The following year, he joined Atlético Madrid: initially assigned to the reserves also in the third division, he made his first-team debut on 4 January 1995 by starting in a 0–0 away draw against CD Mensajero for the Copa del Rey.[1]

Ruano first appeared in La Liga on 15 January 1995, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 1–1 home draw against SD Compostela.[2] In June, after 12 competitive matches, he moved to Real Valladolid.[3]

After only one appearance for the latter, Ruano was loaned to fellow top level club Rayo Vallecano in January 1996.[4] He scored his first professional goal on 14 April of that year, netting the first in a 2–4 loss at RCD Espanyol.[5]

Ruano signed for Segunda División side Levante UD in July 1996, being an undisputed starter during his first and only season. The following year, he returned to the top flight after joining Mérida UD.[6]

In the summer of 1998, Ruano moved to Málaga CF in the second level.[7] He helped the club in their promotion by appearing regularly, but received little playing time in the following years mainly due to injuries.[8]

On 10 December 2002, Ruano was loaned to Córdoba CF until the following June.[9] He cut ties with his parent club in August 2003,[10] and subsequently represented amateurs UE Castelldefels and CF Balaguer, retiring with the latter in 2006 at the age of 31.


Coaching career

Ruano returned to Málaga on 8 June 2011, being appointed manager of the youth setup.[11] On 20 June 2015 he was named coach of Atlético Malagueño, replacing Salva Ballesta.[12]
