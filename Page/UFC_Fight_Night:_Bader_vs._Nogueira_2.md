_UFC FIGHT NIGHT: BADER VS. NOGUEIRA 2_ (also known as _UFC FIGHT NIGHT 100_) was a mixed martial arts event produced by the Ultimate Fighting Championship held on November 19, 2016, at Ginásio do Ibirapuera in São Paulo, Brazil[1]


Background

The event was initially expected to be headlined by a light heavyweight bout between former two-time UFC Light Heavyweight Championship challenger Alexander Gustafsson and Antônio Rogério Nogueira[2] The promotion had previously scheduled the pairing as main event on two other occasions. First in April 2012 at UFC on Fuel TV: Gustafsson vs. Silva and again in March 2014 at UFC Fight Night: Gustafsson vs. Manuwa. On both instances Nogueira pulled out due to injury.[3][4] However on September 30, Gustafsson pulled out of the bout citing an injury of his own. In turn, he was replaced by The Ultimate Fighter: Team Nogueira vs. Team Mir light heavyweight winner Ryan Bader.[5] Bader defeated Nogueira in their previous encounter six years prior at UFC 119 by unanimous decision.[6]

Michael Graves was scheduled to face Sérgio Moraes on the card. However, Graves was removed from the fight on October 3 after he was arrested on a misdemeanor battery charge.[7] He was replaced by Zak Ottow.[8]

Matheus Nicolau was expected to face Ulka Sasaki at the event. However, on November 3, Nicolau was pulled from the bout after USADA revealed a potential anti-doping violation from a sample taken October 13. In turn, Sasaki was pulled from the event entirely and was later rescheduled to face Wilson Reis on February 12, 2017 at UFC 208 [9]
