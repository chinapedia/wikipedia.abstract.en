_SOVETSKAYA LITVA_ (literally: _Soviet Lithuania_; ) was a Russian-language daily newspaper published in the Lithuanian SSR. In tandem with the Lithuanian-language _Tiesa_, it was the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Lithuania, the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR, and the Council of Ministers of the Lithuanian SSR. After the restoration of Lithuania's independence in 1990, the newspaper became an independent daily under the name _ECHO LITVY_ (literally: _Echo of Lithuania_; ). Its circulation was 79,000 copies in 1981, 26,000 copies in 1993, and 12,000 copies in 1997.[1] It discontinued publication in 2001 due to financial difficulties.[2]


History

On 10 July 1940, less than a month after the occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union, the newspaper was established as _Truzhenik_ (_Worker_; ) and was published in Kaunas.[3] It was discontinued on 22 June 1941, the day of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. It was reestablished in Vilnius under the name _Sovetskaya Litva_ on 26 September 1944. It was the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Lithuania, the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR, and the Council of Ministers of the Lithuanian SSR.[4]

On 23 February 1990, _Sovetskaya Litva_ was separated from the Communist Party of Lithuania.[5] When Lithuania regained its independence in March 1990, _Sovetskaya Litva_ was renamed to _Echo Litvy_ on 15 March[6] and remained the official newspaper of the Lithuanian government until 1994. It represented the Supreme Council – Reconstituent Seimas and the Government of Lithuania in 1990–92, and the Seimas and the Government in 1992–94.[7] As the official newspaper, _Echo Litvy_ was obligated to publish adopted and proposed laws which hurt its popularity.[8] The new name _Echo Litvy_ mirrored the Lithuanian-language _Lietuvos aidas_ and there were aborted plans of merging the two dailies.[9] _Echo Litvy_ was the cheapest newspaper in Lithuania.[10]

These changes were not accepted by pro-Soviet activists who in March 1990 – August 1991 published alternative pro-Moscow _Sovetskaya Litva_ and Lithuanian-language _Tarybų Lietuva_.[11] After an order prohibiting the use of the historical name, this alternative newspaper was renamed to _Litva Sovetskaya_ in June 1990.[12] This newspaper was organized by Aleksandras Gelbachas, Vladas Bikuličius, and Žana Naumova. Initially, the newspapers were printed at a press of the Communist Party of Byelorussia in Minsk.[13] After the main newspaper press at Press Palace was seized on 11 January 1991 (see January Events) and Russian specialists who could operate the press arrived in February, the newspapers were printed in Vilnius.[14] The circulation was 15,800 copies in Russian and 22,000 in Lithuanian in 1990, and 40,000 in Russian and 17,600 in Lithuanian in 1991.[15] In total, 131 issues appeared in Russian and 103 in Lithuanian.[16]

_Echo Litvy_ was privatized and became an independent publication. However, it retained its dry tone of an official newspaper and displayed nostalgic tendencies for the Soviet past.[17] It suffered from shrinking readership and financial difficulties and failed to find a wealthy Russian sponsor. During its last year, the circulation was 2,000 copies and 46% of it remained unsold.[18] It discontinued publication on 1 March 2001.[19] The bankruptcy proceedings were started on 12 September 2001 and the company was officially liquidated in May 2003.[20]
