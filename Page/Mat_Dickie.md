MAT DICKIE (born 1981)[1] is an English indie video game designer, developer and author who releases games under the name MDICKIE. He is most notable for his indie professional wrestling games,[2] such as _Wrestling Revolution_ for iOS and Android devices, which received over 100,000 downloads two months after launch.[3] The game later went on to surpass 10 million downloads[4] and its sequel, _Wrestling Revolution 3D,_ went on to compete with WWE 2K games on the mobile and PC market.[5]

Many of Dickie's games are infamous for their awkward controls and poor graphics.[6] He has mentioned that the low resolution and low poly graphics in his games have allowed for better performance, in turn enabling him "to push a lot of boundaries".[7] The indie and low budget nature of Dickie's games have often contributed to their popularity, leading to Dickie describing himself as being "single-handedly responsible for the worst games to ever be enjoyed by millions of people."[8]


Early life

Mat Dickie was born in Brigg, North Lincolnshire in 1981. His parents worked on a small newsstand, where he stayed while they worked, and boredom drove him to express his creativity by producing makeshift toys for himself with the materials available at the place.[9] He attended Brigg Primary School.[10] He became interested in developing games at an early age, often sketching out ideas for games.[11] Some of his works were influenced by games he played as a child, including WWF No Mercy, Super Fire Pro Wrestling and _WWF WrestleFest_.[12]

Dickie also tinkered with Deluxe Paint on his Commodore Amiga until he got his hands on a PC in 1998, which signaled the beginning of his game development career.[13]


Career

PC game development (2000 - 2009)

One day, Dickie was walking through a Woolword's when he stumbled across a copy of DIV Game Studio, a programming language that promised to make game development easy, Mat bought it, and spent the summer of 2000 learning how to use it from the examples. [14]

Dickie released his first game, _Hardy Boyz Stunt Challenge,_ in August 2000. [15]The game had the player play as one of the Hardy Boyz, who were wrestlers in the WWF (later renamed the WWE). The game took two weeks to complete and was posted on a wrestling website where it received 15,000 downloads and positive feedback, which inspired him to continue making video games and to make his own website in November 2000 to host his games.[16][17] He moved to Manchester in 2001 to complete a Bachelor of Science in video games and computers at Salford University.[18][19]

In 2006, Idigicon, who had previously published one of Dickie's games, Boxer's story, contacted him again to make a version of his newest release, Wrestling Encore, for the British professional wrestling promotion One Pro Wrestling; however, legal complications arose due to 1PW not having the video game license to the American professional wrestlers working for them. In order to counteract this issue, 1PW attempted to buy the rights to the whole game off of Dickie instead of the rights to sell the version he had created for the promotion at their live shows, with the added benefit of him getting to meet the wrestlers working for the promotion at the time, including Bret Hart and Jeff Jarrett, Dickie decided to decline this offer. [20]

In 2007, Dickie created his first major non-wrestling game, _Hard Time_, a prison simulator which was named by _Games for Windows_ Magazine as the "Indie Game of the Month".[21] The game was almost released through a subsidiary of THQ. Dickie was also looking forward to develop his wrestling brand with them, however, they felt it was a conflict of interest.[22]

Dickie retired from developing video games in early 2009 after the release of _The You Testament,_ a game based on biblical stories he developed in three months, with PC Gamer calling it the "best worst game ever."[23] Retiring from game development, he became a developer of educational apps, publishing educational resources on TES. [24] Mat had ambitions of enhancing learning and making learning fun, however, he later came to the conclusion that entertainment doesn't have much of a role to play in education. As of 2017, his educational resources have been used in 10,000 classrooms, he was also invited to the 2011 TES awards.[25] He also became an author, writing a book on his game development career and writing others on religion and spirituality as a religious educator.

Mobile game development (2011-2018)

In the beggining of 2012, Dickie was unemployed, about to buy his first and his first child was to be born soon, this motivated him to come out of retirement and move to developing mobile games, releasing _Wrestling Revolution_ as his first major mobile game.[26][27] He also released several 2D remakes of his classic PC games on mobile, such as _Popscene_ in 2014, _Wrecked,_ and _Hard Time_ in 2017.[28] His most successful game to date, _Wrestling Revolution 3D,_ reached 50 million downloads, becoming the first sports game on Google Play to do so.[29]

In July 2018, Dickie once again announced his retirement from full-time game development, citing "frightening intolerance" from digital retailers among other reasons.[30] In an interview, he also cited increasing demands from players after the release of AAA titles such as WWE 2K19. Dickie stated he did not wish to compete directly with WWE games, but intended to provide a "cheaper... lighter... [and] more creative alternative that's always going to be made by one man or a smaller team."[31]
