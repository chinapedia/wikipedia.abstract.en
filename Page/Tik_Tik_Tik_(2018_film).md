Plot

An asteroid strikes the Ennore neighborhood of Chennai. Soon, astronauts predict that another asteroid with an estimated size of 60 square kilometers is going to hit India within six days, an event which could be catastrophic.

The RAW decides to send M. Vasudevan (Jayam Ravi), a trained magician and escape artist, along with his team and a team of scientists to get ahold of a missile in a space center, which they plan to use to destroy the asteroid before it reaches Earth. The military also catches S. Venkat (Ramesh Thilak) and K. Appu (Arjunan), two of Vasu's friends, as per Vasu's instructions. Vasu, Venkat, and Appu are alerted about the asteroid, and they have to steal a nuclear missile from a Chinese space station. The mission is disguised as a satellite maintenance project. Vasu meets M. Swathi (Nivetha Pethuraj) and Col. D. Raguram (Vincent Asokan), two army officials who are going on the mission with them.

Vasu, Swathi, Venkat, Appu, and their captain Raguram go on the space shuttle, Dhruva-1. Just before launch, Vasu's speech channel is directed to an unknown voice, which tells Vasu that he has kidnapped his son Ravi (Aarav Ravi), who will die unless Vasu gives the missile to him. Vasu, who is emotionally attached to his son, agrees. The space shuttle launches. While in flight, Vasu goes unconscious, and Swathi and Venkat take him to the sick bay. There, Vasu wakes up and goes into the wire chamber to cut the wire that controls the liquid hydrogen fuel tank. Vasu actually faked going unconscious due to directions from the unknown voice. Vasu cuts the wire, and as a result, the fuel tank loses much of its fuel. It only has enough fuel for one hour.

Dhruva-1 crash-lands on the moon, where Vasu becomes the first Indian man to step on the moon after pushing Raguram aside. Swathi and Raguram are investigating the problem when Vasu suggests that they request fuel from the target space station. Raguram at first objects, but Swathi convinces him to fly to the space station. The space station astronauts agree to refuel them. However, once Vasu, Swathi, Raguram, Venkat, and Appu go on the space station after Dhruva-1 is done docking, they are immediately arrested. Lee Wei (Aaron Aziz), the captain of the space station, tells them that he knows about the asteroid and that they want to get his missile. However, he outright refuses to give it, saying that they want the asteroid to strike so that China, Lee's native country, can gain more power by signing contracts to rebuild southern India and Sri Lanka. Lee tells his soldiers to release Vasu and the rest of the crew when only the asteroid bypasses the safety line. Once the asteroid bypasses the safety line, there is no chance of diverting it.

Meanwhile, Lt. Gen. Ritika (Rethika Srinivas), a high-ranking official managing the mission, discovers surveillance photos of Vasu cutting the wires and suspects that someone managing the mission caused him to do that, but she is not sure who it is. Chief K. Mahendran (Jayaprakash) is revealed to be the unknown voice telling Vasu to bring him the missile so that he could send it to an international terrorist.

Back at the space station, Vasu attempts to fight against the soldiers before being handcuffed again. The soldiers take the briefcase that he is holding and keep it aside. Venkat, who was hiding in the briefcase, comes out and inserts a USB drive into the space station's computer system. He then surrenders to the soldiers and is taken to the cell. He and Vasu work on downloading a bug into the space station via the USB drive. They and the other crew members learn that Lee's fingerprint and iris are required to unlock the cell that hides the missile.

This causes a major disruption as the lights start flickering intensely. Through this, Vasu is able to obtain Lee's fingerprint and iris scans. He uses them to unlock the cell hiding the nuclear missile. Moments later, he is thrown back into the cell when a soldier reports to Lee that the missile is missing. Lee tortures the crew members until Vasu tells him that the missile is in Dhruva-1.

At that point, he takes off the handcuffs and escapes to Dhruva-1. He tells Swathi through a walkie-talkie to tell Lee that the missile is aimed at China. Lee and the soldiers start panicking. At that time, it is revealed that Vasu did not take the nuclear missile; he used a magic trick involving a mirror to make it look as if the missile was gone. He then proceeds to steal the missile, sounding the alarm and alerting Lee and his soldiers. Swathi, Raguram, Appu, and Venkat all escape to Dhruva-1. Vasu steals the missile and escapes to Dhruva-1 with a low oxygen tank. The crew then settles down and proceeds to fly to the asteroid. On the way, another space shuttle, Dhruva-2, will refuel Dhruva-1 before returning to Earth.

Mahendran then tells Vasu that giving the missile to Dhruva-2 will cause Mahendran to release Ravi. Vasu seemingly gives the missile to Dhruva-2 while docked. Back on Earth, Mahendran, who is alerted about this, lets Ravi go. Dhruva-1 then proceeds to the asteroid. Once they get close to the asteroid, Swathi and Raguram notice that the missile is missing. Mahendran, who has access to the photos of Vasu cutting the wire, tells that it is Vasu's fault, using the photos as evidence. Everyone gets worried, and many mission officials fear that their families will die in the asteroid strike. Once the asteroid seemingly reaches the safety line, the Dhruva-1 crew alerts that the asteroid is actually not at the safety line, and in fact is two minutes away from it. It is revealed that Vasu discussed the unknown voice with the other crew members, and they formulated a plan. The "missile" given to Dhruva-2 was actually a fake duplicate and not the authentic missile. They then proceed to shoot the authentic missile at the asteroid, which destroys the asteroid and saves the world from a catastrophe. Everyone except Mahendran cheers.

At the mission control center, Ritika finds out that Mahendran was threatening to kill Ravi unless he got the missile. Ritika goes to confront Mahendran but is killed by him wielding a golf club. Mahendran cleans up the incident and his clothes. In space, a chunk of the asteroid damages Dhruva-1's left wing, forcing the crew to go in a pod. The pod lands in a river, and on the banks are the mission control officials who cheer for their victory, along with Ravi and his grandfather. Vasu and Ravi meet once again, and Ravi tells Vasu to look in his pocket. Vasu takes out a piece of jewelry that he knew was Mahendran's, and learned that it was Mahendran who kidnapped Ravi

The film then fast-forwards to an awards ceremony. When Vasu gets his award, he gives the piece of jewelry back and whispers to Mahendran, "After all, he's _my_ son." Vasu then walks away with Appu and Venkat while Mahendran commits suicide offscreen.
