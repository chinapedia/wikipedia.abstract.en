William W. Rogers was born on December 25, 1893, in Thorntown, Indiana. After attending local schools, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, in 1914. He subsequently enlisted in the Marine Corps on June 30, 1917, and was assigned to the Headquarters Company, 6th Marine Regiment. Rogers participated first in trench defensive duties near Toulon and subsequently as a corporal in the Battle of Belleau Wood and Battle of Soissons during the summer of 1918.

Second Lieutenant Rogers was transferred to the 82nd Company, 3rd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment and was appointed platoon leader there. He then participated in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and was decorated with the Silver Star for gallantry in action.[1]

At the beginning of October 1918, Rogers and his regiment participated in the Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge. On October 7, Second Lieutenant Rogers volunteered for reconnaissance mission around the small town of Saint-Étienne. After he observed the situation, he was seriously wounded by enemy fire. He was subsequently evacuated to the American Red Cross Hospital No. 1 at Paris and remained there until November 13, 1918. For his repeated gallantry in action, Rogers received his second Silver Star. He was also decorated with the _Croix de guerre 1914–1918_ with Gilt Star by the Government of France.[2]


Interwar period

After his recovery, Rogers rejoined his company and participated in the Allied occupation of the Rhineland with a garrison in the town of Leutesdorf, Germany until the end of July 1919. He returned to the United States on August 6, 1919, and was assigned to Marine Barracks Quantico, Virginia, a few days later.

Rogers was then transferred to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he served with the local Marine recruiting office until the end of March 1924. He was subsequently assigned to the Quartermaster Department for special two-month course. After its completing, Rogers was sent to Nicaragua, where he was appointed quartermaster officer of the Marine detachment within the American Legation Guard at Managua. He returned to the United States in August 1925 and was appointed post quartermaster at Marine Barracks Quantico, Virginia.

He served in this capacity until December 1927, when he was sent within the 2nd Brigade of Marines back to Nicaragua. He was attached to the Guardia Nacional de Nicaragua and participated in the skirmishes with Sandino's Rebels until November 1930, when he was ordered back to the United States. After his return, Rogers was assigned again to Marine Barracks Quantico.

Rogers was transferred to the Marine barracks at Washington Navy Yard in December 1931. While serving there, he attended Army Industrial College in Washington, D.C., where he learned about the resource component of national power. Subsequently, he was sent back to Quantico and assigned to the 7th Marine Regiment.

He was promoted to the rank of major on 24 May 1934 and assigned to the Headquarters Marine Corps in Washington, D.C., where he served for the next two years. After another one-year tour of duty at Quantico Base, Major Rogers was sent to Newport, Rhode Island, where he attended a senior course at Naval War College.

On 14 August 1943, Colonel Rogers joined the staff of the newly created 4th Marine Division under the command of Major General Harry Schmidt. He was appointed 4th Marine Division Chief of Staff on the same date.

The 4th Division went overseas in January 1944 and Rogers participated in combat at Roi-Namur in the Battle of Kwajalein. Despite intense enemy sniper fire, he personally observed the situation at shore and helped coordinate military operations. He was later decorated with the Legion of Merit for his service during this battle.[3]

Rogers later served during the battles at Saipan and Tinian and received another two Legions of Merit for each operation. He also received the Navy Presidential Unit Citation.[4]

Rogers' former superior officer, Major General Harry Schmidt, was promoted to the capacity of Commander of V Amphibious Corps (VAC) in July 1944. Schmidt requested Colonel Rogers for capacity of VAC Chief of Staff. Rogers was subsequently relieved from the 4th Marine Division by Colonel Merton J. Batchelder on 10 August 1944.

Colonel Rogers was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on 15 February 1945 and subsequently participated in the bloody Battle of Iwo Jima. He distinguished himself again and was decorated with the Distinguished Service Medal for "exceptionally meritorious service in a position of great responsibility as Chief of Staff of the V Amphibious Corps Landing Force, prior to and during the assault and seizure of enemy-held Iwo Jima". He also received another Navy Presidential Unit Citation for this battle.

General Rogers simultaneously served as liaison with the headquarters of Walter Krueger's Sixth Army and also participated in the planning of an assault on Japanese homeland (Operation Downfall) and its subsequent occupation. The invasion was cancelled after the unconditional Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945. Nevertheless, Rogers was decorated with the Bronze Star Medal for his part in the planning of the invasion.

He was appointed Commanding General Service Command, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific in December 1945 and was succeeded by Brigadier General Dudley S. Brown within V Amphibious Corps. Rogers was placed on the retired list on 1 December 1946 and also advanced to the rank of major general for having been specially commended in combat.
