Plot

George Bhayankar (Krishnam Raju) is a young & energetic guy who fights for poor & troublesome people. The town's church Father James (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) has always admired Bhayankar's intentions but tries to calm his aggressive behavior. Parallelly, Bhayankar has a sister, Mary (Geetha), who loves Johnny (Suresh), the son of a multi-millionaire Parishudham (Hema Sundar). As she is scared of her brother, Mary used to convene with Father James for counsel. One day, Mary reveals to the Father that she's pregnant and that Johnny has left the town. Here Father consoles Mary and tells that he will explain everything to her parents and brother. Here Lakshmi (Vijayashanthi) Bhayankar's love interest, hears the conversation and misunderstands that Father & Mary are involved in a relationship. Lakshmi reveals it to Bhayankar. In that anger, Bhayankar scolds his sister, blames the Father for his deed and assaults him. So, he gets arrested before leaving Bhayankar takes an oath that he will see the end of the father and on the way, he escapes. Next day Mary dies, hanging to a tree and her body is buried without a post-mortem. At that point in time, Father suspects it as a murder, so, Father contacts his twin brother S.P. John Yugandhar (again Akkineni Nageswara Rao), a powerful police officer and asks him to conduct a post-mortem on the body. Now there is a huge twist in the story, the S.P. starts his investigation and when he exhumes Mary's coffin, shockingly, they find Father James's dead body in it where everyone suspects Bhayankar. Rest of the story is how S.P. breaks out the mystery behind the missing of Mary's dead body and the Father's death.
