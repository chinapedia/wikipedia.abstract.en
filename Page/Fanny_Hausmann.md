FRANZISKA MARIA ELISABETH HAUSSMANN (April 15, 1818 â€“ April 4, 1853) was a Slovenian writer and poet of German origin.[1]

Hausmann is generally hailed as the first female poet to write in Slovene, although that claim has been contested.[2] Most of her work consisted of patriotic poems and love poems.

Hausmann's poems preceded the existence of a national literary magazine, and were subsequently published in weekly newspapers. Her first published poem, "Vojaka izhod" (A Soldier's exit), appeared in _Celske novine_ (Celje News) in 1848, and her other poetry appeared both in that journal and _Slovenija_.[3] Her work was influential with Slovenian populists and also paved the way for more women writers gain entry into the Slovenian literary scene and public sphere.[4]
