The SCOTTISH RALLY CHAMPIONSHIP is a rallying series run throughout Scotland over the course of a year, that comprises seven gravel surface events.[1]

The 2017 season began in the snow-covered forest tracks around Inverness on 18 February, with the season finale taking place around Castle Douglas on 9 September. Driver _Jock Armstrong_ and regular co-driver _Paula Swinscoe_ started the season as defending champions having won the 2016 Championship.[2]

Aberdeen based haulage company _ARR Craib_ sponsored the series for the fifth year in a row.

Following the Grampian Stages in August Euan Thorburn and regular co-driver Paul Beaton were declared champions in their Ford Fiesta R5. With only one event left to run the pair were uncatchable in the points table.[3]
