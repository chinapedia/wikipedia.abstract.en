Murals by Vladimir Ovchinnikov

During four summer seasons (2002-2005), Ovchinnikov, a self-taught artist, made about a hundred paintings[7] on the houses of Borovsk, creating on the dull blank walls of city buildings, boarded-up windows, fences, about 90 different subjects (his famous countrymen, churches, historical events, genre scenes: a girl walking on the pipe of a pipeline, an old woman with a bucket near a downspout, a naked boy knocking at the locked door, a man with a giant cucumber in the hands, an old man in his window reading «Times», etc.). Themes are chosen and selected with the help of his wife. Many of the paintings are accompanied by poems written by Elvira. [8]

Vladimir Ovchinnikov is not only famous for his frescoes, which for many years adorn the walls of houses in Borovsk.

On the wall of one of the shops in the center of Borovsk, a painting of 20 killed people and the image of Alexander Solzhenitsyn was destroyed after only two days. Ovchinnikov's work was destroyed methodically and carefully.[12]
