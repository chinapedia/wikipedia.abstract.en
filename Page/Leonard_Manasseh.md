LEONARD SULLA MANASSEH (21 May 1916 â€“ 5 March 2017) was a British architect, best known for the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu, which he co-designed with Ian Baker.

He was born in Eden Hall, Singapore, which was then the house of his uncle Ezekiel Manasseh, a rice and opium merchant, and is now the residence of the British High Commissioner.[1]

Manasseh's reputation rose with his work at the Festival of Britain, and he formed Leonard Manasseh and Partners with Ian Baker, becoming "one of the leading British architects of the 1960s".[2]

In 1958-60 Rutherford School, Paddington, was built to a design by Manasseh and Baker and in 1964 they designed the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu.[3] In the 1982 Birthday Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.[4]

He turned 100 in May 2016[5] and died in March 2017.[6]

National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C467/27) with Leonard Manasseh in 1998 for its Architects Lives' collection held by the British Library.[7]
