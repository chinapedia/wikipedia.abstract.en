_BATMAN & ROBIN_ is a 1997 American superhero film based on the DC Comics characters Batman and Robin. It is the sequel to the 1995 film _Batman Forever_, the fourth and final installment of Warner Bros.' initial _Batman_ film series and the only one not to feature Tim Burton in any capacity. The film was directed by Joel Schumacher and written by Akiva Goldsman. It stars George Clooney and Chris O'Donnell as the titular characters, alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger, Uma Thurman, Alicia Silverstone, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, and Elle Macpherson. The film tells the story of Batman and Robin as they attempt to prevent Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy from freezing all mankind to death and repopulating the earth with mutant plants, while at the same time struggling to keep their partnership together. It is also to date the only live-action film appearance of Batgirl, portrayed by Alicia Silverstone, who helps the titular characters fight the villains. It is the first time that the Batman franchise uses a camp aesthetic for the style of the movie.

Warner Bros. fast-tracked development for _Batman & Robin_ following the box office success of _Batman Forever_. Schumacher and Goldsman conceived the storyline during pre-production on _A Time to Kill_, while Val Kilmer decided not to reprise the role over scheduling conflicts with _The Saint_. Schumacher had a strong interest in casting William Baldwin in Kilmer's place before George Clooney won the role. Principal photography began in September 1996 and finished in January 1997, two weeks ahead of the shooting schedule.

_Batman & Robin_ premiered in Los Angeles on June 12, 1997, and went into general release on June 20. Making $238.2 million worldwide against a production budget of $160 million,[1] the film was a critical failure and often ranks among the worst films of all time.[2][3] It is also the lowest-grossing live-action _Batman_ film to date.[4] Due to the film's poor reception, Warner Bros. cancelled a sequel, _Batman Unchained_,[5] and rebooted the film series with _Batman Begins_ in 2005. One of the songs recorded for the film, "The End Is the Beginning Is the End" by The Smashing Pumpkins, won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards.[6]

Due to _Batman & Robin_’s overwhelmingly poor reception, the cast & crew most notably Clooney & Schumacher would frequently disown and apologise for the film over the course of years since it’s release.


Plot

Set two years after the defeat of Two-Face and the Riddler, Batman and his new partner, Robin, become defenders of Gotham. They attempt to thwart the villainous Mr. Freeze or Dr. Freeze from robbing diamonds from the natural history museum, but he steals one and flees. Mr. Freeze was originally Dr. Victor Fries, a doctor working to develop a cure for MacGregor's syndrome to heal his terminally ill wife. Fries was forced to wear a cryogenic suit powered by diamonds after becoming unable to live at normal temperatures following a lab accident.

At a Wayne Enterprises lab in Brazil, the botanist Dr. Pamela Isley is working under the deranged Dr. Jason Woodrue, experimenting with the Venom drug. She witnesses Woodrue use the formula to turn the violent, but diminutive, convicted serial murderer Antonio Diego into a hulking monstrosity dubbed "Bane". When Isley threatens to expose Woodrue's experiments, he attempts to kill her by overturning a shelf of various toxins. Despite Woodrue's efforts, Isley is resurrected, transforming into the beautiful and seductive Poison Ivy before exacting revenge; she kills Woodrue with her poisonous kiss, and sets fire to the lab, leaving it to burn down while she escapes with Bane. She finds that Wayne Enterprises funded Woodrue, thus she appropriates Bane as a muscle-bound thug, taking him with her to Gotham City. Meanwhile, Alfred Pennyworth's niece, Barbara Wilson, makes a surprise visit and is invited by Bruce Wayne to stay at Wayne Manor until she goes back to school.

Wayne Enterprises presents a new telescope for Gotham Observatory at a press conference interrupted by Isley. She proposes a project that could help the environment, but Bruce declines her offer, which would kill millions of people. Batman says that this project is in conflict with the main goals of the Wayne Corporation. That night, a charity event is held by Wayne Enterprises with special guests, Batman and Robin, and she decides to use her abilities to seduce them. Mr. Freeze crashes the party and steals a diamond from the event. Although he is captured by Batman and detained in Arkham Asylum, he eventually escapes with the help of Poison Ivy and Bane. Meanwhile, Dick discovers that Barbara has participated in drag races to raise money for Alfred, who is dying of MacGregor's syndrome.

Batman and Robin begin to have crime fighting relationship problems because of Ivy's seductive ability with Robin, but Bruce eventually convinces Dick to trust him. Poison Ivy is then able to contact Robin once more; she kisses him but fails to kill him due to Robin wearing rubber lips. Robin says that the rubber lips are immune to her charms. Meanwhile, Barbara discovers the Batcave, where an AI version of Alfred reveals he has made Barbara her own suit. Barbara dons the suit and becomes Batgirl. Ivy captures Robin, but he gets rescued by Batman, and Batgirl arrives and subdues Ivy to get eaten by her throne plant, before revealing her identity to the pair.

Batman, Robin and Batgirl decide to go after Mr. Freeze together. By the time they get to the observatory where Mr. Freeze and Bane are, Gotham is completely frozen. Batgirl and Robin are attacked by Bane, but they eventually defeat him by kicking apart his venom tubes, stopping the flow of venom to his body. Bane collapses before transforming back to his original diminutive size of Antonio Diego and is left helpless on the ground.

Meanwhile Batman and Mr. Freeze begin to fight each other, with Batman defeating Mr. Freeze. Batgirl and Robin manage to unfreeze Gotham, and Batman shows Freeze a recording of Poison Ivy during her fight with Batgirl, who had informed the latter that she killed Mr. Freeze's wife. However, Batman informs Mr. Freeze that she is still alive, in cryogenic slumber before being moved to Arkham Asylum, waiting for Mr. Freeze to finish his research. Batman proceeds to ask Mr. Freeze for the cure Mr. Freeze has created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome to administer to Alfred, and Mr. Freeze atones for his misunderstanding by giving him the medicine he had developed.

Mr. Freeze is then detained in Arkham Asylum. Poison Ivy is also imprisoned in Arkham Asylum with a vengeful Mr. Freeze as her cellmate (due to his own cell is in the process of being modified for his laboratory needs) and he plans to make Poison Ivy's life a living hell while staying for the attempted murder of his wife. After Alfred is cured, everyone agrees to let Barbara stay at Wayne Manor and fight crime with them.


Cast

-   George Clooney as Bruce Wayne / Batman
    A billionaire industrialist who witnessed his parents' murder as a young boy. At night, Bruce becomes Batman, Gotham City's vigilante protector. Eric Lloyd portrays him as a child in a flashback. Val Kilmer decided not to reprise the role from _Batman Forever_. Director Joel Schumacher admitted he had difficulty working with Kilmer on _Forever_. "He sort of quit," Schumacher said, "and we sort of fired him."[7] Kilmer said he was not aware of the fast track production and was already committed to _The Saint_ (1997).[8] Schumacher cast Clooney in the role because he felt the actor could provide a lighter interpretation of the character than Michael Keaton (in _Batman_ and _Batman Returns_) and Kilmer.[9] The shooting schedule allowed Clooney to simultaneously work on _ER_ without any scheduling conflicts.[10]

    The crime-fighting partner to Batman and legal ward to Bruce Wayne. He has begun to chafe against Batman's authority.
-   Alicia Silverstone as Barbara / Batgirl

Production

Development

WarnerStudio.jpg With the box office success of _Batman Forever_ in June 1995, Warner Bros. immediately commissioned a sequel.[22] They hired director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman to reprise their duties the following August,[23] and decided it was best to fast-track production for a June 1997 target release date, which is a break from the usual 3-year gap between films.[24] Schumacher wanted to homage both the broad camp style of the 1960s television series and the work of Dick Sprang.[25] The storyline of _Batman & Robin_ was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during pre-production on _A Time to Kill_.[26] Portions of Mr. Freeze's backstory were based on the _Batman: The Animated Series_ episode "Heart of Ice", written by Paul Dini.[27] Goldsman, however, expressed concerns about the script during pre-production discussions with Schumacher.[28]

While Chris O'Donnell reprises the role of Robin, Val Kilmer decided not to reprise the role of Batman from _Batman Forever_. Schumacher admitted he had difficulty working with Kilmer on _Forever_. "He sort of quit," Schumacher said, "and we sort of fired him."[29] Schumacher would later go on to say that Kilmer wanted to work on _Island of Doctor Moreau_ because Marlon Brando was cast in the film.[30] Kilmer said he was not aware of the fast-track production and was already committed to _The Saint_ (1997).[31] Schumacher originally had a strong interest in casting William Baldwin in Kilmer's place, but George Clooney was cast instead.[32] Schumacher believed Clooney could provide a lighter interpretation of the character than Michael Keaton (in _Batman_ and _Batman Returns_) and Kilmer.[33][34] The shooting schedule allowed Clooney to simultaneously work on _ER_ without any scheduling conflicts.[35]

Patrick Stewart was considered for the role of Mr. Freeze,[36] before the script was rewritten to accommodate Arnold Schwarzenegger's casting.[37] Schumacher decided that Mr. Freeze must be "big and strong like he was chiseled out of a glacier".[38] Schwarzenegger was paid a $25 million salary for the role.[39][40] To prepare for the role, Schwarzenegger wore a bald cap after declining to shave his head and wore a blue LED in his mouth.[41] His prosthetic makeup and wardrobe took six hours to apply each day.[42] Thurman took the role of Poison Ivy because she liked the femme fatale characterization of the character.[43] Alicia Silverstone was the only choice for the role of Batgirl.[44]

According to Schumacher, during the scene in which the costumes of the Riddler and Two-Face are seen, he originally planned to put Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze escaping from Arkham Asylum while many other villains saw them from their cells.[45] The scene, however, didn't make it in the final film.

Filming

The original start date was August 1996,[46] but principal photography did not begin until September 12, 1996.[47] _Batman & Robin_ finished filming in late January 1997,[48] two weeks ahead of the shooting schedule.[49] The film was mostly shot at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.[50]

When comparing work on _Batman Forever_, O'Donnell explained, "It just felt like everything got a little soft the second time. On _Batman Forever_, I felt like I was making a movie. The second time, I felt like I was making a kid's toy commercial."[51] He also complained of the Robin costume, saying it was more involved and uncomfortable than the one he wore in _Batman Forever_, with a glued-on mask which caused sweat to pool on his face.[52] According to John Glover, who played Dr. Jason Woodrue, "Joel [Schumacher] would sit on a crane with a megaphone and yell before each take, 'Remember, everyone, this is a cartoon'. It was hard to act because that kind of set the tone for the film."[53] Production designer Barbara Ling admitted her influences for the Gotham City design came from "neon-ridden Tokyo and the Machine Age. Gotham is like a World's Fair on ecstasy."[54] Rhythm and Hues and Pacific Data Images created the visual effects sequences, with John Dykstra and Andrew Adamson credited as the visual effects supervisors.[55]

O'Donnell said that despite hanging out with Schwarzenegger a lot off set and during promotion for the film, they never worked a single day together; this was achieved with stand-ins when one of the actors was not available.[56] Stunt coordinator Alex Field taught Silverstone to ride a motorcycle so that she could play Batgirl.[57]

Music

Like _Batman Forever_, the original score for the film was written by Elliot Goldenthal.[58] The soundtrack featured a variety of genres by various bands and performers, showcasing alternative rock on the lead single "The End Is the Beginning Is the End" by The Smashing Pumpkins, on the Goo Goo Dolls' contribution, "Lazy Eye" and with R.E.M.'s song "Revolution". R&B singer R. Kelly also wrote "Gotham City" for the soundtrack, which became the other song featured in the end credits, as well as one of the singles, reaching the top 10 in the United States and in the UK. Eric Benét and Meshell Ndegeocello also contributed R&B songs. Also included was the top 5 second single, "Look into My Eyes" by the hip hop group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Other songs featured included electronic dance elements, including those by Moloko and Arkarna. The soundtrack was released on May 27, 1997, a month before the film.[59][60] "The End Is the Beginning Is the End" by The Smashing Pumpkins, won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards.[61]


Marketing

The _Batman & Robin_ film trailer debuted on the February 19, 1997 episode of _Entertainment Tonight_.[62] Warner Bros. spent $125 million to market and promote the film,[63][64] in addition to its $160 million production budget.[65] The studio also reportedly included toy companies in pre-production meetings, including the design of concept art and character illustrations. Director Joel Schumacher criticized Warner Bros.' strategy for _Batman & Robin_ as being overtly toyetic.

Various Six Flags parks (Six Flags Great Adventure, Six Flags Over Texas, and Six Flags St. Louis) all debuted coasters themed to the film. Six Flags Great Adventure opened Batman & Robin: The Chiller in 1997, and both Six Flags Over Texas and Six Flags St. Louis received Mr. Freeze in 1998.[66] Taco Bell featured a promotional campaign including collectible cups and a contest with a replica of the film's Batmobile as a grand prize. A junior novelization of the screenplay, written by Alan Grant, was published along with the release of the film in 1997.[67]


Reception

Box office

_Batman & Robin_ was released on June 20, 1997 in North America, earning $42,872,605 in its opening weekend,[68] making it the third-highest opening weekend of 1997.[69] The film declined by 63% in its second week.[70] _Batman & Robin_ faced early competition with _Face/Off_ and _Hercules_.[71] Schumacher blamed it on yellow journalism started by Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News and other film websites such as Dark Horizons.[72] The film went on to gross $107.3 million in North America and $130.9 million internationally, coming to a worldwide total of $238.2 million.[73] Warner Bros. acknowledged _Batman & Robin_{{'}}s shortcomings in the domestic market but pointed out success overseas.[74]

Critical reception

On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 10% based on 87 reviews, with an average rating of 3.67/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Joel Schumacher's tongue-in-cheek attitude hits an unbearable limit in _Batman & Robin_, resulting in a frantic and mindless movie that's too jokey to care much for."[75] On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 28 out of 100, based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[76] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale.[77]

Schumacher and producer Peter MacGregor-Scott blamed the negative reception of _Batman & Robin_ on Warner Bros.' decision to fast track production. "There was a lot of pressure from Warner Bros. to make _Batman & Robin_ more family-friendly," Schumacher explained. "We decided to do a less depressing _Batman_ movie and less torture and more heroic. I know I have been criticized a lot for this, but I didn't see the harm in that approach at all."[78] Roger Ebert of the _Chicago Sun-Times_ criticized the toyetic approach and Mr. Freeze's one-liner jokes in his two-star review of the film.[79] Kenneth Turan of the _Los Angeles Times_ believed the film "killed" the _Batman_ film series, and felt _Batman & Robin_ depended too much on visual effects.[80] Desson Howe of _The Washington Post_ largely disapproved of Schumacher's direction and Akiva Goldsman's script.[81] Mick LaSalle, writing in the _San Francisco Chronicle_, said, "George Clooney is the big zero of the film, and should go down in history as the George Lazenby of the series."[82] However, Janet Maslin of _The New York Times_ gave a positive review. She praised Uma Thurman's acting, as well as the production and costume design.[83] Andrew Johnston, writing in _Time Out_ New York, remarked, "It's hard to tell who _B&R_ is intended for. Anyone who knows the character from the comics or the superb animated show on Fox will be alienated. And though Schumacher treats the Adam West version as gospel, that show's campy humor is completely incompatible with these production values. As Mr. Freeze would say, it's sure to leave audiences cold."[84]

_Batman & Robin_ was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film, as well as Best Make-up and Best Costume, but won none. Alicia Silverstone won the Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress. Other nominations at the Razzie Awards included Schumacher (Worst Director), George Clooney and Chris O'Donnell (Worst Screen Couple), Akiva Goldsman (Worst Screenplay), both Chris O'Donnell and Arnold Schwarzenegger (Worst Supporting Actor), Uma Thurman (Worst Supporting Actress), as well as Billy Corgan (Worst Song for "The End Is the Beginning Is the End"). _Batman & Robin_ also received nominations for Worst Picture, Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property. Ultimately, out of 11 nominations, _Batman & Robin_ garnered only one Razzie Award.

Some observers thought Schumacher, a gay man, added possible homoerotic innuendo in the storyline.[85] James Berardinelli questioned the "random amount of rubber nipples and camera angle close-ups of the Dynamic Duo's butts and Bat-crotches."[86] _Los Angeles Times_ wrote that "The addition of nipples and a codpiece to Batman’s costume may be the film’s lasting legacy".[87] Schumacher stated, "I had no idea that putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from Ancient Greek statues, which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically correct."[88] O'Donnell felt "it wasn't so much the nipples that bothered me. It was the codpiece. The press obviously played it up and made it a big deal, especially with Joel directing. I didn't think twice about the controversy, but going back and looking and seeing some of the pictures, it was very unusual."[89] Clooney, who admitted to purposely taking a subtle gay approach to his portrayal, later said "Joel Schumacher told me Batman was gay".[90] Clooney himself has spoken critically of the film, saying, "I think we might have killed the franchise",[91] and called it "a waste of money".[92]


Cancelled sequel and reboot

During the filming of _Batman & Robin_, Warner Bros. was impressed with the dailies, prompting them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher to return as director for a fifth film. However, writer Akiva Goldsman turned down an offer to write the script.[93] In late 1996, Warner Bros. and Schumacher hired Mark Protosevich to write the script for a fifth _Batman_ film. A projected mid-1999 release date was announced.[94] _Los Angeles Times_ described their film as "continuing in the same vein with multiple villains and more silliness". Titled _Batman Unchained_, Protosevich's script had the Scarecrow as the main villain. Through the use of his fear toxin, he resurrects the Joker as a hallucination in Batman's mind. Harley Quinn appeared as a supporting character, written as the Joker's daughter.[95] Clooney, O'Donnell, Silverstone, and Coolio were set to reprise the roles of Batman, Robin, Batgirl, and Scarecrow. It was also hoped that Jack Nicholson would reprise the role of the Joker. However, following the poor critical reception of _Batman & Robin_, Clooney vowed never to reprise his role.[96][97]

Warner Bros. decided to consider a live-action _Batman Beyond_ film and an adaptation of Frank Miller's _Batman: Year One_. Warner would then produce whichever idea suited them the most.[98] Schumacher felt he "owe[d] the Batman culture a real _Batman_ movie. I would go back to the basics and make a dark portrayal of the Dark Knight."[99] He approached Warner Bros. about doing _Batman: Year One_ in mid-1998,[100] but they were more interested in hiring Darren Aronofsky. Aronofsky and Miller developed a _Year One_ script with Aronofsky to direct, but it was ultimately canceled. Christopher Nolan was eventually hired to helm the next _Batman_ film in January 2003, resulting in the rebooted _Batman Begins_ (2005).[101]

In "Legends of the Dark Knight", an episode of _The New Batman Adventures_, three teenagers discuss their ideas about what Batman is really like. They briefly meet a youth called Joel whose idea of Batman reflects characterizations and costumes portrayed within Schumacher's _Batman and Robin_. The teens treat Joel's ideas with utter disdain.[102] In _Watchmen_, director Zack Snyder and comic book artist Dave Gibbons chose to parody the molded muscle and nipple Batsuit design from _Batman & Robin_ for the Ozymandias costume.[103][104] The film is referenced in the _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_ episode "Legends of the Dark Mite!", when Bat-Mite briefly uses his powers to transform Batman's costume into the same suit shown in the Schumacher _Batman_ films, before declaring it "Too icky".[105] The Batman from _Batman & Robin_ later appeared as part of an army of Batmen gathered from across the Multiverse in "Night of the Batmen!", complete with the blue rubber Batsuit. Additionally, there were worries within Warner Bros. surrounding the negative critical reaction to _Batman & Robin_ and how that may come to harm the success of the subsequent direct-to-video animated film _Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero_, which was originally planned for release at around the same time as _Batman & Robin_ but was subsequently delayed.[106] However, _SubZero_ received a far stronger positive response from critics than _Batman & Robin_, with Mr. Freeze's role within it being seen in a much more positive light, returning his popularity as a _Batman_ villain to a level comparable to that reached by him within the two Emmy-winning episodes the character featured in of _Batman: The Animated Series_.[107]
