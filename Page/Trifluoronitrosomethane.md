Trifluoronitrosomethane.png TRIFLUORONITROSOMETHANE (commonly abbreviated TFNM) is a toxic halomethane. Its distinctive deep blue colour is unusual for a gas.


History

Trifluoronitrosomethane was synthesized for the first time in 1936 by Otto Ruff and Manfred Giese at the University of Wrocław.[1] It was created through the fluorination of silver cyanide in the presence of silver nitrate and silver oxide.


Production

Trifluoronitrosomethane can be produced from the reaction of trifluoroiodomethane and nitric oxide under a UV light with a yield of up to 90% in normal pressure. A small amount of mercury is needed as catalyst. The reaction results in the creation of iodine as a by-product.[2][3][4]


Properties

Trifluoronitrosoethylene is also a deep blue gas.[5] Although it is somewhat more kinetically stable due to its fluorine substituents, trifluoronitrosomethane, like other nitroso compounds, has a weak C–N bond of only 39.9 kcal/mol.[6]
