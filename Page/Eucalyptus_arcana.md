_EUCALYPTUS ARCANA_, commonly known as the MALLEE MANNA GUM or CARPENTER ROCKS GUM[1] is a mallee that is endemic to South Australia. It has rough bark from the base of the trunk to the thinnest branches, lance-shaped, sometimes curved leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and hemispherical fruit. It is only known from a single population near Carpenter Rocks.


Description

_Eucalyptus arcana_ is a low, straggly tree, sometimes with several stems, that typically grows to high. It has rough, fibrous, grey to grey-brown bark from the base of the trunk to the larger branches, and smooth, grey to cream bark on the thinnest branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have four-sided stems and glossy elliptic to egg-shaped leaves long and wide with wavy edges. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, the same glossy green on both sides, with a blade that is long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers buds are arranged in groups of seven on a peduncle long, the individual flowers on a pedicel up to long. Mature buds are oval to spindle-shaped, long and wide with an operculum that is shaped like a blunt cone, about equal in length to the floral cup. Flowering occurs in February and the flowers are white. The fruit are hemispherical to cone-shaped, long and wide containing dark brown to black ovoid seeds.[2][3][4][5]


Taxonomy and naming

Mallee manna gum was first formally described in 1998 by Dean Nicolle and Ian Brooker who gave it the name _Eucalyptus splendens_ subsp. _arcana_ and published the description in the _Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens_.[6][7] In 2009 Kevin Rule raised it to species status as _E. arcana_.[8][9] The specific epithet (_arcana_) is a Latin word meaning "shut up", "secret", private" or "mysterious",[10] referring to the species being hidden in dense scrub.[11]


Distribution and habitat

_Eucalyptus arcana_ has a limited range and occurs on low rises in shallow, impoverished, red clay-loam soils over limestone around the coastal town of Carpenter Rocks in south-east South Australia. It is found amongst dense tall shrubland, associated with species including _Eucalyptus obliqua_ and _Eucalyptus ovata_. The populations that Nicolle and Brooker described as _E. splendens_ subsp. _arcana_ occurring near Moonlight Head in south-west Victoria have been assessed as a form of _E. aromaphloia_.[12][13]
