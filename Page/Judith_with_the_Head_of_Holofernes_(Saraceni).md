_JUDITH WITH THE HEAD OF HOLOFERNES_ is a 1610â€“1615 painting by the painter Carlo Saraceni, now held in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.[1]

The painting is typical of Saraceni's first decade in Rome where he became influenced by Caravaggio. His use of candlelight is illustrative of the chiaroscuro used by the tenebrists in this period. Another autograph copy is known in the Dayton Art Institute.

This painting was documented in David Teniers the Younger's catalog _Theatrum Pictorium_ of the art collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in 1659 and again in 1673,[2] but the portrait had already enjoyed notoriety in Teniers' portrayals of the Archduke's art collection:
