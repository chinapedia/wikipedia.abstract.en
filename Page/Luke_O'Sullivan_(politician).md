LUKE O'SULLIVAN is an Australian politician. He was a Nationals member of the Victorian Legislative Council for Northern Victoria from 2016, when he was appointed to a casual vacancy following Damian Drum's resignation, until 2018, when he was defeated.

O'Sullivan served as state director of the National Party from 2005 to 2010, and at the time of his preselection was chief of staff to state Nationals leader Peter Walsh.[1][2] O'Sullivan's appointment was delayed after the Victorian Government refused a joint sitting to appoint him in retaliation for the Legislative Council's vote to suspend Special Minister of State Gavin Jennings from the chamber for six months.[3]
