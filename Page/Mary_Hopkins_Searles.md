Sherwood developed her interest in grand architecture during this marriage. She convinced her husband to build a grand estate in San Francisco to match those of the other railroad tycoons of the era. The house was furnished by Herter Brothers, and was completed in 1880 (two years after Hopkins' 1878 death). The house was later used to house the San Francisco Art Institute. The house was destroyed in a fire resulting from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Sherwood's inheritance from Hopkins his home on Kellogg Terrace in Great Barrington; she prepared it as her summer residence after Hopkins' death.

Sherwood and Searles together built Searles Castle in Great Barrington on the grounds of the Kellogg Terrace home that Sherwood had owned since 1881.

The bulk of her estate passed to Searles, while her adopted son Timothy, who had married Sherwood's niece, received only a small portion, resulting in a prolonged dispute. When Searles died in 1920, he left his inherited estate to the Methuen Memorial Music Hall.
