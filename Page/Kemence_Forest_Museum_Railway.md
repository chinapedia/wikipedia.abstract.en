The KEMENCE FOREST MUSEUM RAILWAY (Hungarian: _Kemencei Erdei Múzeumvasút_) is a narrow gauge railway in northern Hungary.[1][2] It is operated by volunteers during weekends between late March and late October.[3]


History

The forest railway

Kemence_kisvasut2.jpeg The first railway line in Kemence was laid in 1910 between Kemence and Királyháza. The Csarnavölgy line, that is still in operation, was opened in 1913. After the two main lines were opened, several other minor railroads were constructed, most of them serving only some years.

Every line was created to continuously slope in the direction of the village, therefore horses (and later locomotives) were required only to distribute the empty carriages in the morning, and then, when the cars were loaded, they were only needed to be braked by a brakeman, the gravity successfully carried the cars down.[4]

Throughout its history before 2000, the Kemence Forest Railway was never meant to transport passengers. There were no settlements around the railroad, and the forestry was not interested in creating a tourist railway.

Kemence_kisvasut3.jpeg The widespread of forestal roads meant that the railway has a dark future ahead itself. In 1968, the Királyháza line was abandoned. The last remaining Csarnavölgy line survived it with 22 years, officially closing in 1992, however, it had almost no function in its last years. However, the tracks remained, and the forestry didn't sell it.

A disastrous decade

After its abandonment, the conditions were fastly declining. In the last few years, only one locomotive remained viable. The track conditions became poor, with some of the rails being stolen.

New times

Seeing the saddening fate of the railway, volunteers decided to save this unique railway. From 1 January 2000, the Kisvasutak Baráti Köre Egyesület[6] ("Association of Narrow Gauge Railway Friends") loans the track and the properties from the forestry.

This was the first time the Kemence railway – renamed to its current name, Kemence Forest Museum Railway, referring to the museal rolling stock, most of which was saved from other 600 mm gauge railways that ceased to exist – became a tourist railway.

In the first four years, the railway operated in a short, but after the flood, intactly remained 1.8 km section between Kemence and Godóvár-Strand. After restoring three bridges and several stolen sections, the line was extended with another additional 1.8 km, to the now defunct Pityur-rétje station. Feketevölgy station was reached in 2009, and its second platform was built in 2015.


Today

In January 2017, the railway is 4.1 kilometers long, with an additional 3.1 km waiting for renovation.

The passenger cars are mostly locally built.[7]
