_PHYLLIDIA GOSLINERI_ is a species of sea slug, a dorid nudibranch, a shell-less marine gastropod mollusk in the family Phyllidiidae.[1]


Distribution

This rare species was described from Madang, Papua New Guinea.[2] It has also been found at Amami-Ooshima Islands, Japan.[3]


Description

This nudibranch has a cream coloured dorsum with smaller regularly spaced brown spots and larger pale brown blotches. The small brown spots are surrounded by pale fawn colour and the overall aspect is unlike other Phyllidia species, being reminiscent of _Knoutsodonta depressa_, which is camouflaged to look like a bryozoan. The rhinophores are cream. The entire dorsum is covered with small rounded tubercles.[4]


Diet

This species feeds on a sponge.
