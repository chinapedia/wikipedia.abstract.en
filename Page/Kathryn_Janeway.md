KATHRYN JANEWAY is a fictional character in the _Star Trek_ franchise. As the captain of the Starfleet starship USS _Voyager_, she was the lead character on the television series _Star Trek: Voyager_, and later a Starfleet admiral, as seen in the 2002 feature film _Star Trek: Nemesis_. Although other female captains had appeared in previous _Star Trek_ episodes and other media, she is, to date, the only one to serve as the central character of a _Star Trek_ TV series. She has also appeared in other media including books, movies (notably _Nemesis_), and video games. In all of her screen appearances, she was played by actress Kate Mulgrew.


Casting

as Nicole Janeway]] The character was originally named Elizabeth Janeway, after the noted writer of the same name. However, after Geneviève Bujold was cast, she requested the character to be renamed "Nicole Janeway". Bujold, whose experience was mainly in feature films, was unprepared for the schedule demanded by the television series, was unwilling to do news interviews, and dropped out on the second day of filming for the pilot episode "Caretaker".[1] Kate Mulgrew, who had previously auditioned for the role, was brought in. She suggested that the name to be changed to "Kathryn", to which the producers agreed.[2] Actresses Erin Gray and Chelsea Field also auditioned for the role.[3] Field's husband Scott Bakula would later play Captain Jonathan Archer in _Star Trek: Enterprise_.


Fictional character biography

Kathryn Janeway was born on May 20,[4] in Bloomington, Indiana on Earth.[5] She was the daughter of Vice Admiral Janeway and has a sister named Phoebe, who is the artist in the family. Phoebe never chose to join Starfleet and stayed close to home with her mother, Gretchen Janeway. Kathryn Janeway was very close to her father, who taught her to look at the universe with a scientist's eye and she was devastated at his death.[6] Her first mission after graduating the academy was as a science officer on the USS _Al-Batani_, where she served as Chief Science Officer during the Arias mission.[7]

Captain Janeway takes command of the _Intrepid_-class USS _Voyager_ in 2371. Their first mission is to locate and capture a Maquis vessel last seen in the area of space known as the Badlands. While there, the Maquis ship and _Voyager_ are transported against their will into the Delta Quadrant, 70,000 light-years away, by a massive displacement wave. The Maquis ship is destroyed while fighting the Kazon-Ogla, and although _Voyager_ survives, there are numerous casualties. In order to protect the Ocampa, who live on a planet _Voyager_ visits, Janeway destroys the Caretaker Array, the space station that transported the two ships to the Delta Quadrant, which provides energy to the Ocampa's planet, despite the fact that the Array may be the two ships' only chance to return home. In doing this, Janeway strands her ship and crew seven decades' travel from home.[8]

Her first major task is integrating the surviving Maquis and _Voyager_ crews. Chakotay, captain of the Maquis ship, succeeds the deceased Lieutenant Commander Cavit as her first officer. Janeway also grants convicted criminal, former Starfleet officer, and accomplished pilot Tom Paris a field commission, and makes him _Voyager_{{'}}s helmsman.[9]

Janeway's other interactions with her crew include helping the de-assimilated Borg Seven of Nine reclaim her individuality and humanity and advocating for the Doctor's status as a sentient being.[10]

During the course of the TV series, _Voyager_ has contact with the Q Continuum on three occasions, and repeated contact with the Borg. With the intervention of a future/alternate version of herself, Janeway leads her crew in using one of the Borg's transwarp conduits to return her ship to Federation space after having traveled through the Delta Quadrant for seven years.[11]

Later appearances

During a cameo appearance in the film _Star Trek: Nemesis_, now-Admiral Janeway instructs Captain Jean-Luc Picard to travel to Romulus at the invitation of the film's antagonist.[12]

Admiral Janeway also appeared in the Borg Invasion 4-D ride at the Star Trek: The Experience venue in Las Vegas, which closed in 2008. In the ride, Janeway leads _Voyager_ to the rescue of ride participants who are ostensibly trapped first on a space station and later on a shuttlecraft that come under attack by a Borg Cube commanded by the Borg Queen. At the ride's end, Janeway tells the participants, "Congratulations. You've defeated the Borg with one thing the Queen can never assimilate: the human spirit. As long as we have that, resistance will never be futile."

Although Paramount considers only the onscreen, live-action _Trek_ episodes and movies canonical, Janeway has nonetheless continued as a major character in the _Star Trek_ novels that depict the events in the lives of the _Voyager_ characters after the end of that series. In Peter David's 2007 _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ novel, _Before Dishonor_,[13] which is set after the events of _Star Trek: Nemesis_, Janeway is assimilated by a rogue faction of the Borg, and becomes their new Borg Queen. Seven of Nine, with the aid of Ambassador Spock and the _Enterprise_-E crew, manages to communicate with Janeway's consciousness, buried deep within the Queen's mind. During a brief moment of contact, Janeway helps them destroy the Borg cube, with all hands on board. Although Seven manages to escape, Janeway is killed. Her memorial service sees a vast turnout, and a tall gleaming pillar with a light burning atop it is constructed in tribute to her. The Q female appears to Janeway's spirit, and tells her that Q and the Q Continuum had taken an interest in her. Telling her that she has a destiny, Lady Q takes Janeway by the hand, and disappears with her into realms unknown. Writer Peter David explained the book was conceived by Pocket Books editorial as one in which Janeway would die, and that he was brought in to write it in order to give her a reportedly heroic send-off.[14]

In the 2012 _Star Trek: Voyager_ novel _The Eternal Tide_ by Kirsten Beyer, Janeway returns to human life with the help of young Q, who needs her assistance, and by the book's end resumes her admiralship in Starfleet. In the 2014 _Star Trek: Voyager_ novel _Protectors_ by Kirsten Beyer, Janeway goes back to Earth per orders of Starfleet Command; by the end of the book she returns to the Delta Quadrant, taking charge of the starships stationed there. She continues this mission in Beyer's second 2014 _Star Trek: Voyager_ novel, _Acts of Contrition_.

In Cryptic Studios' online role-playing game, _Star Trek Online_, Janeway is briefly mentioned in the background, exploring the Hobus system after the supernova that was the catalyst for the events of the 2009 _Star Trek_ film.[15]


Reception

In 2019, Vulture ranked Captain Katherine Janeway as the number one _Star Trek_ captain by their selection criterion, a combination of competency and managerial style.[16] In particular, they note her ability to overcome great challenges despite being on the other side of the Galaxy and commanding a crew in large part consisting of non-Starfleet personnel.[17] One of her interesting relationships is noted as with the Former Maquis B'Elanna Torres (played by Roxann Dawson), and the Former Borg Seven of Nine (played by Jeri Ryan).[18][19] Space.com rated Janeway as the number three best captain of _Star Trek_.[20] In 2017, _The Washington Post_ ranked Janeway as the third best Captain of _Star Trek_.[21][22]

ScreenRant rated her the fifth best captain of the franchise, noting her ability to command in adverse situations; two praises were that she does not give up easily and tries to maintain crew morale.[23] In a review of female characters from science fiction television and film, Janeway was in the top ten.[24] Captain Janeway was ranked as the 18th best character of all _Star Trek_ by IGN in 2009.[25] In 2016, Captain Janeway was ranked as the 8th most important character of Starfleet within the _Star Trek_ science fiction universe by Wired magazine.[26]

The romance between Janeway and Kashyk in "Counterpoint" was praised by ScreenRant, which they rated as one of the ten best episodes of _Star Trek: Voyager_.[27] In 2018, CBR ranked Janeway as the 4th best Starfleet character of _Star Trek_.[28] In 2017, Screen Rant ranked Katherine Janeway as the 18th most attractive person in the Star Trek universe.[29]

Captain Janeway was rated as one of the top seven time travelers, in the whole Star Trek franchise by _Nerdist_ in 2019, especially for her exploits in "Endgame".[30]
