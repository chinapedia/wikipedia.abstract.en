Works

One of her most famous works is a portrait of Juana de Jesus, which was painted posthumously. Contemporary writer, Francisco Javier Antonio, complimented the likeness, attributing its accuracy to Isabel having met Juana de Jesus multiple times.[3] This work is the only securely attributed painting to Isabel de Cisneros, but unfortunately it has not survived, and there only remains a copy at the convent of Santa Clara, Quito.[4] Juana "looks incredibly Quiteña with a long nose, a subdued smile, a narrow face, and delicate hands."[5]
