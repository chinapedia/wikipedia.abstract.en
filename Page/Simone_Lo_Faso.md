Career

A technical second striker, Lo Faso joined the Palermo youth system at the age of 9.

He made his first team debut with Palermo on 12 August 2016 during a Coppa Italia game against Bari. On 6 November 2016 he also made his Serie A debut on a game against AC Milan, playing a total ten league games during the 2016–17 season.

On August 2017 he left Palermo to join ACF Fiorentina on loan, with the right for the _Viola_ to buy the player permanently by the end of the season. However, he only managed to make two short first team appearances as a substitute throughout the whole 2017–18 Serie A campaign, and being mostly featured as part of the Under-19 team. On April 2018, he suffered a broken fibula which effectively ended his season and led Fiorentina to renounce its transfer rights. He therefore rejoined Palermo for the club's 2018–19 Serie B season.
