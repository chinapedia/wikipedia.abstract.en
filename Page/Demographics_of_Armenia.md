After registering a steady increase during Soviet period, the population of Armenia declined from peak value 3.633 mln in 1992 to 2.986 mln in 2017.[1]

The country's population has declined due to increased emigration since the break-up of the Soviet Union. The rates of emigration and population decline, however, have decreased in recent years, and there has been a moderate influx of Armenians returning to Armenia.

According to 2016 human development report [2] Armenia has the highest inequality-adjusted HDI and the lowest coefficient of human inequality compared to all of its neighbouring countries.


Vital statistics

Life expectancy

During the Soviet period, life expectancy was traditionally high in Armenia and topped all other republics of USSR and most of countries in Eastern Europe in 1978-1980.[3][4]

After a setback during 1986-1996 mostly due to the Spitak Earthquake and the Nagorno-Karabakh War, Armenia regained its position and was consistently among the top three former Soviet republics during 1997-2016, topping the list in 2007.[5]

In 2016 the average life expectancy at birth for males was 71.6 years and for females was 78.3 years, with the average at 75.0 years.[6]

Reproduction indicators

In 2016 natural increase of population comprised 12 366 persons and the crude rate of natural increase made 4.1‰, per 1000 population, decreasing by 0.4 pro mile points compared to the previous year.[8]

After double-digit (in pro mile) crude natural increase rates during 1982-1992 these did not exceed 5.5 after 1998. At regional level slightly better situation is in Yerevan city, where the value of 5.5 is consistently being surpassed since 2009. Particularly weak is natural increase in Tavush and Syunik provinces, not much better off are Lori and Vayots Dzor provinces.[9]

Armenia's Total Fertility Rate at 1.6 was lowest in the region in 2017.[11]

The mean age of mother at birth was 26.8 years and at first birth it was 24.7 years in 2016.[12]

In 2016, infant mortality rate (in the first year of their life) was 8.6 ‰ per 1 000 live births.[13]

A study revealed that population growth rate _changes_ were more favorable in Armenia than in its surrounding countries during 2005-2015.

Structure of the population

Mean age in 2016 : 36.2 years.[14]

36.3% of women who gave birth in 2016 had higher education.[15]Pyramid_armenia.jpgStructure of the population (12.10.2011) (Census):[16]

¹ The numbers of life births and deaths until 1959 were calculated from the birth rate and death rate, respectively

² The high number of deaths in 1988 is related to the Spitak earthquake While in the 19th century the death rate was equal to the rate of other Europeans (excluding England) and lower than the death rate among the Indo-Portuguese, Hindus and Muslims.[24]

³ The population estimate for 2012 has been recalculated on the basis of the 2011 Census.

: POPULATION OF ARMENIA ACCORDING TO ETHNIC GROUP 1926–2011

In 2002 review ethnic minorities included Russians, Assyrians, Ukrainians, Yazidi Kurds, Iranians, Greeks, Georgians, and Belarusians. There were also smaller communities of Vlachs, Mordvins, Ossetians, Udis, and Tats. Minorities of Poles and Caucasus Germans also exist though they are heavily Russified.[27]


Languages

    Armenian 97.7%, Kurdish 1%, Russian 0.9%, and other 0.4% (2001 census).

Armenian is the only official language.

Armenia is a member of the La Francophonie and hosted its annual summit in 2018.[28]

The largest communities of the ethnic Armenian diaspora are fluent in Russian and English.


Religions

Most Armenians are Christian, primarily of Apostolic Church rite. Armenia is considered the first nation to adopt Christianity, which was first preached in Armenia by two Apostles of Jesus, St. Bartholomew and St. Thaddeus in the 1st century. The Armenian Apostolic Church can trace its roots back to the 3rd and 4th centuries. The country formally adopted the Christian faith in 301 A.D. Over 90% of Armenians belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. It is a very ritualistic, conservative church, roughly comparable to the Coptic and Syrian churches. Armenia also has a population of Catholics and evangelical Protestants.

According to the Census of 2011 the religion in Armenia is the following: Christianity 2,862,366 (94.8%) of whom 2,797,187 Armenian Apostolic (92.5%), 29,280 Evangelical, 13,996 Armenian and Roman (Latin) Catholic, 8,695 Jehovah's Witness, 8,587 Eastern Orthodox (Russian, Ukrainian, Georgian, Greek), 2,874 Molokan (non-Orthodox Russians), 1,733 Assyrian Church of the East (Nestorian), 733 Protestant, 241 Mormon, Yazidism (0.8%), Paganism (0.2%), 812 Islam, 5,299 Other Religion (0.2%), 121,587 No Response (4%).[29]


Migration

The estimated number of population net migration is -24.8 thousand persons, according to the Integrated living conditions survey of households of 2016; for urban population -13.8 thousand and for rural population -11.0 thousand persons.[30]

24.9% of households were involved in external and internal migration processes over the period of 2013- 2016. Migration directions were distributed as follows: 12% - internal, 10.5% - Republic of Artsakh, rest (76.4%) - international (of which 89.8% - Russia). Among household members of age 15 and above, who left the place of their permanent residence in 2013-2016 for 3 months and longer and had not returned as of 2016, 11.9% were in Armenia, 13.0% in Artsakh, and 75.1% in other countries, predominantly in the Russian Federation. More than 54% of migrant household members of the age 15 years and above sent money and/ or goods to their families/relatives/friends within the 12 months preceding the survey.[31]


Wealth and poverty

Out of 41 emerging economies Armenia was among only 4, which recorded rising inequality (measured by Gini coefficient) in years 2007-2015.[32]

According to official data 29.4% of population was below poverty line in year 2016. The poverty indicators in Shirak, Lori, Kotayk, Tavush and Armavir provinces are higher than the country average. The highest poverty rate in the country has been recorded in Shirak province, where 46% of the population is below the poverty line. To overcome poverty, Armenia would need AMD 63.2 billion, or an amount equal to 1.2% of GDP, in addition to the resources already allocated for social assistance, assuming that such assistance would be efficiently targeted to the poor only.[33]

In terms of international poverty line corresponding to US$1.25 at 2005 PPP poverty in Armenia went down from 19.3% in year 2001 to 1.5% in year 2008 and remained nearly unchanged until year 2015 moving in range 1.5% - 2.7%.[34]

According to Global Wealth report prepared by Credit Suisse mean wealth per adult in Armenia in 2018 is estimated at $7,583 rising 3.96 times from estimated $1,913 in year 2000. Mean wealth per adult in Armenia surpasses corresponding values for neighboring countries Iran and Azerbaijan, as well as for Ukraine and Belarus.[35][36]
