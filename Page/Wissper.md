Characters

-   WISSPER A 7-year-old girl, born with the magical ability to whisper to animals. She has a loving connection to all creatures. By using the magic word "Sssshhh!..." she can transport herself to anywhere there is an animal in trouble. Wissper is sweet natured, except when animals are behaving badly.
-   PEGGY Peggy is a baby penguin, loveable, cute and mischievous. A great swimmer, erratic waddler and Wissper's best friend Peggy often accompanies Wissper on her amazing adventures.
-   KEV THE CROCODILE Kev is an energetic, confident croc with a surfer-dude attitude. Above all he's enthusiastic - he'd love to be a top surfer, but he never quite hits the crest of a wave.
-   DAN THE PAN Panda Dan is laid back, slow, gentle and Zen-like. Dan can be shy in a crowd and is quite content with his own company. When he talks, it appears not to make much sense, since everything he says seems to come from a fortune cookie. Dan loves to chew on bamboo.
-   STRIPES THE TIGER She is a feisty, sophisticated lady; powerful and happy in her own fur. Stripes is a well spoken mother figure to Wissper when in the animal worlds. She is fierce when she wants to be, but also inclined to want her tummy rubbed!
-   HERBERT THE HORSE An honest, strong and hardworking chap who is at his happiest when working up a sweat in the fields or pulling heavy logs up a grassy slope. He likes nothing better than to have Wissper riding on his back. He has the hairiest feet you have ever seen.
-   GERTIE AND OTIS Gertie the Giraffe is tall, gangly, nervous, jittery and easily frightened. Otis the Oxpecker Bird is Gertie‘s laid back, musical companion. Together best friends, Gertie and Otis are the perfect combination to help when height is needed.
-   MONTY Monty is very lively – chattering, playing and racing. He‘s quick, alert, suspicious, funny and unpredictable. Monty has a huge family and loves acrobatics.
