_IMAGINATION EXPRESS_ is an educational series of interactive storybook generator[1] video games developed by Edmark, and announced on November 14, 1994.[2][3] The titles in the series include _Destination: Castle_ (November 15, 1994)[4]_, Destination: Neighborhood_ (November 15, 1994),[5] _Destination: Rain Forest_ (May 5, 1995)[6]_, Destination: Ocean, Destination: Pyramids, and Destination: Time Trip, USA._


Development

At the launch of the product line, Edmark CEO Sally Narodick commented that "kids love to tell stories", noting the creations that playtesters of the series had already made.[7] A perspective-based piece of technology was added to the game; dubbed "auto-sizing", it meant that the size of an object changed as it was moved by the player toward the foreground or background.[8]


Gameplay

The games, which are targeted at children aged 6â€“12, transport players to learning destinations around the globe, and "inspire them to create interactive on-screen stories and beautiful printed books".[9] The games aim to encourage creative writing and imagination skills.[10] The games included background information, such as the "Destination: Rain Forest's Rain Forest Fact Book".[11] Players can add text, music, and their own narration.[12]


Commercial performance

_Destination: Rain Forest_ was the 5th most popular title in the education category sold across 11 Software Etc. stores in the Washington area in the week ending June 10, 1995.[13]


Critical reception

Chocago Sun-Times deemed the series "high-quality eduware" as well as "clever...mathematics teaching software". The newspaper said the series contained "some of the best software in years to help kids learn how to create stories".[14] Computer Shopper wrote that _Destination: Ocean_ was less effective than it could be because it separated the education and entertainment portions of the game rather than seamlessly integrating them;[15] meanwhile Daily News said _Destination: Ocean_ "provides such a balance".[16] The Washington Post thought _Destination: Rain Forest_ was a "high-class creativity program".[17] Computers in Libraries praised the series for "provid[ing] a host of tools and interactive methods for children to learn how to write their own stories", rather than passively absorbing the work of developers.[18] PC Mag described _Destination: Rain Forest_ as a "creativity tool".[19] School Library Journal noted that recorded sounds could take up a considerable amount of space on a contemporary computer's harddrive.[20]

According to Billboard, the series is "award-winning".[21] _Destination: Rain Forest_ won a Newsweek Editor's Choice Awards for best children's software in 1995.[22] That same year, Imagination Express received the Silver Award for Best Elementary Education Program for Children at the NewMedia INVISION Awards ceremony.[23] The series won one of the four awards at the 1995-1995 Software Awards; Technology & Learning wrote that the series was "sophisticated" and "smart".[24]
