THE NEW YORK GENOME CENTER (NYGC) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit biomedical research organization in New York, New York.[1] It is fundamentally a collaboration of academic, medical and industry centers in New York City, with other partners throughout the country.


Purpose and organization

The center focuses genomic research that leads to scientific advances which are intended to provide new insights and therapies for patients with neurodegenerative disease, neuropsychiatric disease, and cancer, leveraging strengths in whole genome sequencing, genomic analysis, and development of genomic tools. The center's faculty hold joint academic appointments at its member institutions and lead independent research labs at the center.

The center's scientists bring a multidisciplinary and in-depth approach to the field of genomics, conducting research in single cell genomics, gene engineering, population and evolutionary genomics, technology and methods development, statistics, computational biology and bioengineering.[2] In 2017, co-founder Tom Maniatis was recruited when Founding Director Robert B. Darnell retired from the center; Maniatis now serves as Scientific Director and Chief Executive Officer of the New York Genome Center.[3]


Founding

The Center was founded in November 2011 as a collaboration among eleven academic institutions to advance genome research,[4] based on leadership from Tom Maniatis[5] and financial support of $2.5 million from each institution as well as fromf private philanthropists.[6] In November 2012, the center recruited Robert B. Darnell as President and Scientific Director,[7] where he served as CEO and Founding Director, before returning to Rockefeller University and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator[8] in 2017 [9] [10]. NYGC formally opened in a multi-story building at 101 Avenue of the Americas.[11][12] on September 19–20, 2013.[13][14]

The 12 founding institutions (Albert Einstein College of Medicine joined the original 11 institutions on April 2013)[15] were:

-   Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (New York)
-   Columbia University (New York)
-   Cornell University / Weill Cornell Medical College (New York)
-   Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York)
-   Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (New York)
-   New York—Presbyterian Hospital (New York)
-   NYU School of Medicine (New York)
-   Northwell Health (New York)
-   The Jackson Laboratory (Maine)
-   Rockefeller University (New York)
-   Stony Brook University (New York)
-   Albert Einstein College of Medicine (New York)


Funding

The Center's funding sources include US and New York state governments, a contract with 10 medical institutes for central management of clinical data, and charitable foundations.[16] This includes funds pledged by the Simons Foundation and the Carson Family Charitable Trust of up to $100 million from 2016 to 2019.[17][18]

Government funding has included a $55 million grant from New York State to support genomic medicine [19] and a $40 million grant from the National Human Genome Research Institute with Robert B. Darnell as Principal Investigator for establishing a Center for Common Disease Genomics[20], Additionally, the Center and Weill Cornell Medicine received a National Cancer Institute grant to support a joint cancer genomics data center for the research and clinical interpretation of tumors, a part of the ongoing development of The Cancer Genome Atlas .[21] The Center was also awarded a $13.5 million contract to conduct whole genome sequencing and analysis for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's TOPMed program.[22]

In 2017, New York State committed $17 million in capital improvements for the New York Genome Center to house JLABS@NYC, a life sciences incubator set to open in summer 2018.[23]
