DELIA FIALLO (born 4 July 1924) is a Cuban author and screenwriter who lives in Miami, Florida. She is one of the most distinguished representatives of the contemporary romance novel, dabbling in various genres which appear in her literary output.

Due to the contributions she made to the rise of the melodrama genre in the late 1970s and mid–1980s, she is considered to be the "mother of the Latin American telenovela".[1][2] In all, over 80 successful adaptations have been made of her soap operas in different countries and languages.[3]


Biography

Fiallo studied philosophy and literature in Havana, receiving a doctorate in 1948.[4] She began writing radionovelas in Havana in 1949, making her first adaptation to a telenovela with _Soraya_, which was released in Cuba in 1957.[5][6] She left the country, together with her family, in 1966, for exile in Miami, where she would write most of her novels.

She lived for a time in Venezuela, to supervise productions of her works by Venevisión and later Radio Caracas Televisión.[7] Thanks to her compatriot Enrique Cuscó, she was able to contact the owners of the former, who broadcast her first telenovela in that country, 1967's _Lucecita_.[8]

Fiallo has not written an original telenovela since _Cristal_ in 1985, since the last project she worked on, _La Felicidad_, was never completed and she decided to retire. At that time, she sold the rights to her works to Televisa. Their adaptations, as she has declared on several occasions, she has not liked.[9]


Personal life

She has been married to radio director Bernardo Pascual since 1952.[10] She is mother to five children (four girls and one boy), and has 13 grandchildren. She currently resides in Miami, Florida.

By Fiallo's account, she has not visited Venezuela since the election of former President Hugo Chávez in 1998.[11]


Telenovelas

Original

_El ángel perverso_

The protagonist of the original radionovela is Angelina, a wicked woman who impersonates an invalid to retain her husband Gustavo, and finally, after being discovered, is devoid of truth. However, in order to meet the standards of telenovelas, in which the protagonist must be good, Fiallo was forced to introduce a new character into the first teleplay – Lucecita, an illegitimate peasant daughter of Angelina's father. She starts working as a maid in the house and has a love affair with Gustavo.

The story was intended to end after the death of Angelina in an accident, with Gustavo and Lucecita happily married with a daughter, but because of its success, Fiallo wrote an extension in which Gustavo is left with amnesia after an accident, and Angelina's nurse Mirtha (who had secretly been in love with him) takes him and the girl from the country to make him believe she is his wife. Meanwhile Lucecita, without losing hope of finding her husband and daughter, comes to serve at the house of the Aldamas, a family of miserable millionaires who regain their happiness through Lucecita. Five years later, Gustavo, Mirtha, and the girl return, and Lucecita starts working as a maid in their house to be near her daughter. Gustavo, still amnesiac, falls in love with Lucecita not knowing that she is actually his true wife. This version of the story is the one which has remained in all subsequent adaptations, all very successful.
