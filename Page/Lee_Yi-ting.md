LEE YI-TING () is a Taiwanese politician.


Political career

Both Lee and fellow Kuomintang member Kang Shih-ju planned to run in the January 2008 legislative elections, and the party chose to back Lee.[1] He was elected to the Legislative Yuan in January 2008, defeating Democratic Progressive Party incumbent Tu Wen-ching.[2] A few weeks after the election, the Miaoli District Prosecutors Office charged Lee with vote buying.[3] The Taichung bench of the Taiwan High Court upheld the ruling of the Miaoli District Court in December, annulling Lee's electoral victory.[4] By-elections were scheduled for 14 March 2009,[5] and the Kuomintang named Lee's wife Chen Luan-ing as its candidate.[6] She lost to Kang Shih-ju, a candidate who had left the KMT to plan an independent campaign.[7]
