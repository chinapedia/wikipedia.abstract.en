TANZANIAN DRAUGHTS (or simply TZ DRAUGHTS; and DRAFTI in Swahili) is a variant of draughts (checkers) board game played usually in Tanzania. This is the strategy game that is played by two people using pieces on board. The game is very similar to Czech draughts but in this type the player can capture using king or men, there is no priority for that. Apart from that they are completely similar in any way. The game is also somehow similar American checkers[1] and Shashki in case of starting position however rules of playing Tanzanian checkers differ. Like many other kinds of draughts, there is possibility that either player can win the game or draw can be offered but this is based on the negotiations of players or supporters of the game.

Optional rules

The following rules are based on negotiations of players or teams. Not all players obey these rules in TZ draughts gameplay. Therefore they are not necessary.

1.  Some players agree that, if one has three kings and one has only one king, players have to count each move of player who has one king (or sometimes one who has three kings but not both). If number of moves is (usually) 12 depending upon what the players agreed, the draw will be offered. The reason of this agreement is that, it could take long time to end match because the chance of winning is small, though a player with three kings can (if plays perfectly) still win if the main diagonal is under the control of him or her.
2.  Some players agree that, if one has won the game without any player having the king during the game play, the goal to winner is called "supa" (pronounced as the word SUPER) and the one goal is equal to 12 goals.
3.  Some players agree that, the one who loses the game should start the next game.
4.  Some players agree that, after each game no matter whether draw or won, players must exchange their pieces.


Widely accepted laws

While there are currently no notable federations or institutions that standardize rules or laws of Tanzanian checkers, the following laws are accepted countrywide. Most famous, best players in Tanzania follow these conventions. Many of these are already explained in previous sections.

1.  For the first time (match), any one can start the game.
2.  Valid move must be done once, player cannot undo valid move.
3.  The game is draw when each play has one king or two kings with no other pieces.
4.  The game is not draw if one player has three kings and at least one of his or her king is in main diagonal, and another player has one king.
5.  If the above situation occurs, player with single king has to count each of her moves up to 12, if number of counts reach 12, the game is draw.
6.  If one of players has three pieces, two are kings and one is not king but main diagonal is under control of him or her, and if another player has only one piece which is king then a player with one king can decide to promote all three pieces of his opponent as kings and start counting (as explained previous law).
7.  Player who wins the match must start next match. If draw, the next match must be started by player who has not started this draw match.
8.  Full competition consists of two matches if one player won all two matches. However there are additional match called _limboti_ if the first two matches are not all won by single player. In short this offer is possible with the following outcomes of two matches: 0-0, 1-0, 0-1, 1-1 but not 2-0 or 0-2.
9.  If there are more than three people to participate in checkers tournament, then the tournament type must be knockout. The player who eliminated is the one who loses full competition. So the player who won many competitions is regarded as best player of the tournament. The main points of tournament of player is number of opponents eliminated by him or her in all competitions in tournament.
