QUID, INC. is a private software and services company, specializing in text-based data analysis. Quid software can read millions of documents (e.g. news articles, blog posts, company profiles, and patents) and offers insight by organizing that content visually.[1]

Quid clients have historically included technology companies and research teams who use Quid market landscapes to analyze investment trends, gain competitive intelligence, and map innovation.[2] It has since expanded its customer base[3] to serve large corporations in healthcare, consulting, finance, industrials, consumer goods, advertising/marketing, as well as government organizations.

In 2013, Quid was named by _Fast Company_ as one of the World’s Top 10 Most Innovative companies in Big Data.[4] In 2016, World Economic Forum presented Quid with their Technology Pioneers award[5] and IDC (International Data Corporation) named Quid a Top Innovator for the 2016 U.S. Financial Compliance and Risk Analytics Market.[6]

The company is based in San Francisco with offices in New York City and London.[7]

The Press

Quid is often used by publications for its data analysis and visualizations. For example, Fast Company (magazine) leveraged Quid to pick its annual Most Innovative Companies list.[15]

Other examples include Fortune analyzing VC funding trends,[16] The Atlantic reporting coincidences collected by a University of Cambridge professor,[17] VentureBeat analyzing the media’s backlash of Uber,[18] Wired diving into the language used at Presidential party conventions,[19] and more from outlets such as the Economist,[20] the New York Times,[21] Forbes,[22] and the San Francisco Chronicle.[23]


Criticism
