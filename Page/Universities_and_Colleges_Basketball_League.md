The UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES BASKETBALL LEAGUE (UCBL) is a collegiate basketball tournament based in the Philippines, which was established in 2016. The inaugural season of the UCBL officially opened on October 8, 2016 with seven competing schools from Metro Manila and nearby provinces competing in the tournament.[1]

Organized by the Universities and Colleges Athletic League, Inc. (UCAL), headed by the league's president Franklin Evidente, UCBL's mission is to give better opportunities for aspiring players as well as showcase their talents in the hard court. In addition, the league will provide better officiating of the games and to give the players and teams the opportunity to be seen on national television.[2][3]

All games are to be held at the Olivarez College Coliseum in Sucat, Parañaque every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday afternoons, while delayed telecast of the matches are aired on AksyonTV (now 5 Plus) through the TV coverage provided by ESPN5 every 8:00 p.m. to 10 p.m. and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Fridays.

The group of referees from the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas were tapped to officiate the games.[4]
