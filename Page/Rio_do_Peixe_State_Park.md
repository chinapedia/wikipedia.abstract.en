The park would be part of the proposed Trinational Biodiversity Corridor, which aims to provide forest connections between conservation units in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina in the Upper Paraná ecoregion.


Environment

The park protects the margins of the Rio do Peixe, a left tributary of the Paraná River, in a region near its mouth where it meanders through _várzea_ interspersed with permanent or temporary lagoons. Due to its similarity with the Pantanal, this section of the Rio do Peixe is sometimes called the "São Paulo Pantanal". The park is known for its marsh deer (_Blastocerus dichotomus_), the largest deer in South America at up to in length, which is found in marshes with high vegetation from southern Peru and Brazil to Uruguay. The park is rich in bird species, including several threatened with extinction.

It was created as partial compensation for the land flooded by the Companhia Energética de São Paulo (CESP) with the Engenheiro Sérgio Motta Hydroelectric Power Plant on the Paraná River, which would flood of the Lagoa São Paulo Reserve and of the Great Pontal Reserve. Other protected areas created to compensate for the dam were the Rio Ivinhema State Park, the Aguapeí State Park and the Cisalpina Private Natural Heritage Reserve.

The areas of the park were declared of public utility on 22 February 2005. Fishing regulations were published on 2 October 2008, covering conservation areas and their buffer zones in the Paraná River basin. They were the Morro do Diabo State Park, Rio do Peixe State Park, Aguapeí State Park, Mico Leão Preto Ecological Station, Ivinhema State Park, Ilha Grande National Park, Caiuá Ecological Station and Iguaçu National Park. As of 2016 property ownership in the Rio do Peixe State Park had still not been regularized. When the properties have been acquired they will be donated by CESP to the state of São Paulo.

The project would plant seedlings in , allow natural regeneration of and manage forest fragments in . On 15 June 2016 SEMA announced that the state park would start to receive visitors after construction of an access point from the SP-563 highway. The access point would lead to the park headquarters, with a visitor center, administrative offices, workshop and warehouse, and accommodations for visitors, students and researchers. These buildings had not yet been completed due to technical and legal delays.
