GREG GREY CLOUD, is a Crow Creek Nation educator, singer and activist. Grey Cloud is a co-founder of Wica Agli, a non-profit to end violence against women, children, and in general in the community. He is a notable ecologist and defender of Native American rights; gaining national attention when he sang an Honor Song in the Senate after the Keystone XL Pipeline bill was defeated,[1] and in leading the Spirit Riders to protect the Standing Rock Reservation affected by the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.[2][3]


Activism

On November 18, 2014, Grey Cloud met with Senator Tim Johnson and other lawmakers about the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline. After the narrow vote of 59-41 by Senators defeating the measure, Grey Cloud stood and sang a traditional song to honor them. He explained: "I wasn't chanting. It wasn't an outburst. It was a song of honor, honoring the senators, the hard work and courage for standing up and saying no to Big Oil." [4] The action led to his and others in the group being arrested, which in court was later thrown out.[5]

In the fall of 2016, Grey Cloud was at the frontline of the confrontation between Native Americans and their supporters and the police blockade of the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. Further militarization ensued and Grey Cloud, on horseback in regalia and as part of the Spirit Riders, were chased by police in ATVs and shot at with rubber bullets. The attack resulted in injuries to the riders and one horse being killed.[6][7]
