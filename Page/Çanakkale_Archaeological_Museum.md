ÇANAKKALE ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM () was a museum in Çanakkale, Turkey.

Çanakkale is situated on the Anatolian side of the Dardanelles Strait. It is close to famous Troy of the antiquity. The Dardanelles campaign of World War I is known as _Çanakkale Savaşı_ in Turkish.

In 1960, an abandoned church was opened as a museum. In 1984, the museum moved to 100. Yıl street of the city at . [1] However, its contents have been moved to the 2018-established Troy Museum ( or _Truva Müzesi_), close to the excavation site of the ancient Greek city of Troy. It is best to combine a visit to the museum with a visit to Troy itself, Monday generally is a closed day for museums in Turkey, but as during a visit it was very hard to get proper information one should try and get information locally. A minibus, starting at the Minibus station at the bridge over the Çanakkale Çay bridge of the Atatürk Caddesi, provides a regular service to both Troy and the museum. When that bus passed the (former) museum in Çanakkale it seemed closed, but that could not be confirmed.

The following text was found to be correct for the Troy Museum: The main items in the exhibition halls are artifacts from various ruins around Çanakkele such as a Troia, Assos, Apollon, Smintheion, Tenedos and Alexandria Troas. Some of the items are marble sculptures, steles, illumination gadgets, terracota and bronze kitchenware, glassware and ornaments. A colored sarcophagus from the Achaemenid Empire and Polyxena sarcophagus are among the notable items.[2] There are also some ethnographic items.
