POPE ADRIAN III or HADRIAN III (; died July 885) was Pope from 17 May 884 to his death.[1] According to Jean Mabillon, his birth name was Agapitus.[2] He served for little more than a year, during which he worked to help the people of Italy in a very troubled time of famine and war.


Biography

He was born at Rome. He laboured hard to alleviate the misery of the people of Italy, prey to famine and to continuous war.[3] He is also known to have written a letter condemning the Christians of both Muslim-ruled and Christian-ruled parts of Spain for being too friendly with the Jews in these lands.[4]

He died in July 885 at San Cesario sul Panaro (Modena) not long after embarking on a trip to Worms, in modern Germany. The purpose the journey was to attend an Imperial Diet after being summoned by the Frankish King Charles III, the Fat, to settle the succession to the Holy Roman Empire[5] and discuss the rising power of the Saracens.

His death and subsequent burial in the church of San Silvestro Nonantola Abbey near Modena[6] is commemorated in the sculpted reliefs () that frame the doorway of this church. His relics are found near the high altar, and his tomb at once became a popular place of pilgrimage. His cult was confirmed in 1891, and his feast day is 8 July.[7]

[2] According to Reginald L. Poole (1917), "The Names and Numbers of Medieval Popes", _The English Historical Review_, 32 (128), 465–78, at 467, Mabillon has probably confused Adrian III, who succeeded Marinus I, with Agapetus II, who succeeded Marinus II a century later.
