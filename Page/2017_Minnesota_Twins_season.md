The '''2017 Minnesota Twins season ''' was the 57th season for the franchise in the Twin Cities of Minnesota, their eighth season at Target Field and the 117th overall in the American League. The Twins began the season on April 3 at home against the Kansas City Royals and finished the year on October 1 at home against the Detroit Tigers.

On September 27, the Twins clinched the second wild-card berth to become the first team in Major League Baseball history to reach the postseason after losing 100 games the previous season.[1] They lost to the New York Yankees in the Wild Card Game.


Offseason and spring training

The Twins recorded a 16–13 win–loss record in spring training. Three games finished tied and were therefore not included in the standings.[2]
