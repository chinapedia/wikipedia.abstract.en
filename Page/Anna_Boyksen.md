ANNA HELENE BOYKSEN is known as the first female undergraduate engineering student at Technical University of Munich (TUM) (German: Technische Universität München). Anna Boyksen was born on August 11, 1881, in Havendorfersand, in the Grand Duchy of Oldenberg, to Dietrich Anton Boyksen, a merchant, and his wife Mathilde, née Lubben. In her curriculum vitae, Boyksen claimed her nationality as Bavarian and religion as Evangelical.[1]

in 1906, Anna Boyksen was the first woman to enroll in TUM (at the time called THM) in electrical engineering, completing her intermediate exams in 1908.[2] She then went on to pursue studies in economics and law: in 1911, she defended her dissertation, titled "The German Stock Exchange Regulations. A Comparative Representation" (German: "Die deutschen Börsenordnungen. Eine vergleichende Darstellung.[3]"), at the University of Erlangen, under her married name, Anna Helene Koch.


Legacy

THE ANNA BOYKSEN DIVERSITY RESEARCH CENTER at TUM "explores human diversity and the opportunities of diversity for society. Its work focuses on a question often overlooked in Germany: How can the natural, engineering and life sciences benefit from a more diverse community culture?"[4]

The prestigious ANNA BOYKSEN FELLOWSHIP[5] has been offered by the Technical University of Munich - Institute for Advanced Study (TUM-IAS) since 2014.The Fellowship is granted to outstanding international scholars and researchers who wish to probe gender / diversity-related problems in the Natural and Engineering Sciences, in collaboration with TUM researchers. The two-year Fellowship was created to help advance TUM's goal to become "Germany's most attractive university for women"[6] and to foster a productive and durable exchange of ideas and solutions on an international level.
