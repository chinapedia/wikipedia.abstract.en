He currently lives in Adelaide, South Australia where he has held the position of Vice Chancellor of Flinders University since 2015.[1]

On Australia Day 2016 Stirling and his family became Australian citizens.


Career

Stirling holds a Bachelor of Science in Biological Sciences from the University of Edinburgh and completed a PhD in genetics at the University of Glasgow. He was appointed Professor of Genetics at the University of Manchester in 1998, and appointed Education Dean in the Faculty of Life Sciences in 2001. Six years later in 2007 he was promoted to Associate Vice-President eLearning and in 2008 made Vice-President for Teaching and Learning. Stirling moved to Australia where he took up the position of Deputy Vice-Chancellor Academic at Curtin University in 2011. He was later appointed Provost and Senior Deputy Vice-Chancellor there,[2] before accepting the position of Vice-Chancellor of Flinders University in South Australia in 2015.


Honours

During his time at the University of Manchester he was awarded a number of prestigious prizes and awards including the Balfour Lecture Prize from the Genetics Society 1988, the Jenner Research Fellowship from the Lister Institute of Preventative Medicine 1993-1998, a Wolfson Research Fellowship from the Royal Society and the 1997 Fleming Award from the Society for General Microbiology.

A NATO research fellowship at the University of California Berkeley saw Stirling working alongside future Nobel laureate Randy Schekman, describing the experience as an absolute joy.[3]


Strategic vision

Stirling identified student success, international growth and high-impact research as key priorities in his strategic plan _Making a Difference - The 2025 Agenda_[4], released in March 2016. It includes a _vision_ to be internationally recognised as a world leader in research, an innovator in contemporary education, and the source of Australiaâ€™s most enterprising graduates, and a _mission_ of changing lives and changing the world. The plan sets ambitious targets in education and research, setting a course to elevate Flinders University to the top 10 of Australian universities, and the top 1% in the world by 2025, with a clear focus on the impact the University can have for individuals and across society at large. It includes a focus on embedding personal enterprise skills across both the curriculum and the workforce to create career-ready graduates. The document establishes the institution's core values of Integrity, Courage, Innovation and Excellence, along with the underlying ethos of being Student Centred, as qualities informing the university's decision-making and underpinning its culture.


Role in university restructuring

Prior to his appointment in Adelaide, concerns were raised by the National Tertiary Education Union that Stirling could repeat restructuring plans implemented at Curtin with adverse impacts to staff and students.[5] Plans to restructure Flinders University emerged in 2016, during Stirling's second year in the position.[6] In 2017 the University's previous model of four Faculties and 14 Schools was transformed into six Colleges: College of Business Government and Law; College of Education, Psychology and Social Work; College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences; College of Medicine and Public Health; College of Nursing and Health Sciences and College of Science and Engineering. Professional services were restructured to align with the new model. In 2018 Flinders University embarked upon an academic restructure process which sought to increase staff levels and appoint Teaching Specialists, a move opposed by the local branch of the NTEU.[7] It claimed approximately 200 academic staff members could be affected and that the process could cost Flinders University over A$20 million, in addition to the recruitment costs for new staff members. Stirling believed that the restructure would produce improvements in the university's underlying performance, including growth in commencements and research funding.[8] The NTEU lodged several notices of dispute which the University referred to the Fair Work Commission. On 6 December 2018 recommendations[9] handed down by Commissioner Christopher Platt referred to the genuineness of the University's change proposals and stated that the organisational change process should continue with some urgency with the aim of all employees being advised of processes and outcomes as soon as possible.[10] A petition with some 250 signatories was presented to Flinders University Council calling for a review of the restructure process and contents. [11][12][13] The restructure was effectively completed in early 2019.

Stirling has subsequently announced an additional AUD$100m, five year additional investment in research, and matching AUD$100m, five year additional investment in teaching and learning.[14]
