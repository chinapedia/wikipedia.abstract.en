They can play 20 instruments including guitar, bass, trumpet, flute, percussion and saxophone.

Career

Unable to find regular work, Sultana turned to busking on the streets of Melbourne to make a living.[9] From 2008 to 2012, Sultana was the vocalist of the band Mindpilot with Patrick O'Brien, Emily Daye and David Herbert. This band won several Battles of the Bands competitions in Melbourne. The band split in 2012.[10]

In 2016, Sultana shared a video on social media that garnered one million views within five days.[11] In the same year, they won the J Award for Unearthed Artist of the Year and had two tracks voted into the Triple J Hottest 100, 2016: "Jungle" (No. 3) and "Notion" (No. 32). Both are singles from the EP _Notion_. Sultana performed at the Woodford Folk Festival, Southbound, and St Jerome's Laneway Festival.[12] Sultana is managed by Lemon Tree Music with whom they signed in June 2016.[13]

A home recording of the single "Jungle" has gained over 40 million views. Sultana went into the studio with producer Nikita Miltiadou and began working on the EP release _Notion_. In September 2016, they released the EP through their own independent record label, Lonely Lands Records. The EP reached a peak position of number 8 on the ARIA Charts.

Due to the success of _Notion_, Sultana announced a world tour, including hundreds of shows in Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Their father resigned from his job in order to become their roadie. Working with Miltiadou in April 2017, Sultana released "Murder to the Mind", the first single since the release of _Notion_. It reached number 59 on the Australian Singles chart.[14] Not long after the release of "Murder to the Mind", Sultana was diagnosed with laryngitis, and was forced to cancel and postpone shows across Australia.[15]

In a June 2017 interview, Sultana told Fairfax that the debut album is slated for release in April 2018, after which they had planned to tour, record a second album, tour again, and then take a break and return to normal life.[16] On 25 July 2017, Sultana announced the Homecoming Tour. As part of the tour, they visited Adelaide (Entertainment Centre), Sydney (Hordern Pavilion), Fremantle (Arts Centre), Margaret River (3 Oceans Winery), Melbourne (Margaret Court Arena) and Noosa (Noosa Sporting Grounds), with the Pierce Brothers and Willow Beats as supporting acts.[17]

In October 2017, Sultana announced the premiere of a new single "Mystik" on triple j.[18] Also in October, Sultana made a television debut on _Late Night with Seth Meyers_, performing "Jungle".[19] They were nominated for four ARIA Awards: Breakthrough Artist, Best Independent Release, Best Blues and Roots Album and Best Australian Live Act).[20]

Following the Homecoming Tour, Sultana continued work on their debut LP, _Flow State_, released on 31 August 2018.[21]

On 13 June 2018, Sultana sent out a Facebook private message to selected fans, with a video of a sneak peek of a new single titled "Salvation", accompanied by footage in the studio. Sultana announced in June 2018 that the new single would premier on Triple J on 21 June, and was released on 22 June.[22]
