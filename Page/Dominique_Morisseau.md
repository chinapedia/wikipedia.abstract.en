She has authored over nine plays,[1] three of which are part of a cycle titled _The Detroit Projects._[2] Her second play in the series, _Paradise Blue_, is currently in development at Signature Theatre Company[3] She is a recipient of the MacArthur Foundation "Genius Grant" for 2018.


Early life

Morisseau grew up in Detroit, Michigan with her mother and father. Her mother's family is from Mississippi and her father's family is from Haiti.[4] Later, she attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor where she received her BFA in Acting in the year 2000.[5] There she met her husband, J. Keys, who is also from Michigan. J. Keys was born in Detroit but grew up in Southfield on the outskirts of the city. He is a music industry promoter, emcee and hip hop musician.[6] The couple married in 2013.[7][8]


Career

Acting

Morisseau's performance career began as a live poetry speaker, primarily performing for her home town community, Harmonie Park in Detroit. She began her career in the theatre as an actor and received a BFA in Acting from the University of Michigan.[9] After college, she continued acting and worked with several organizations. At the Lark Play Development Center she worked as an actor in a developmental production of _The Mountaintop_ by Katori Hall, workshopping the role of Camae. In 2013, in a production at Actor's Theatre of Louisville, she reprised the role of Camae once more.[10] She continues acting now, but has stated that she would not act in any of her plays' premieres.[11]

Writing

Morisseau began writing plays in college. She has stated that the lack of roles for her at the University of Michigan is what drove her to start writing plays. She wrote _The Blackness Blues: Time to Change the Tune, A Sister’s Story_ at this time.[12] After college, in 2012 through 2013, she received a Playwrights of New York (PoNY) fellowship at the Lark Play Development Center.[13][14] She has also worked as a Teaching Artist with City University of New York's Creative Arts Team. Morisseau has said that music plays a huge part in her work and often informs the work that she is writing. "It's a resource and clue to my work, and music plays a unifier among cultural barriers."[15]

Morisseau was on the list of Top 20 Most Produced Playwrights in America in 2015–16, with 10 productions of her plays being produced nationwide.[16][17]

Morriseau is currently a story editor for the television series _Shameless_ on Showtime.[18]

She wrote the book for the jukebox musical _Ain't Too Proud—The Life and Times of the Temptations_, which is directed by Des McAnuff. The musical opened on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre in March 2019. It has played pre-Broadway engagements at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre (2017), the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles (August to September 2018),[19] and the Kennedy Center (July 2018). This marked Morisseau's Broadway debut,[20] and she received a Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical nomination, the first Black woman to do so.


Work

The Detroit Projects

Morisseau has written a 3 play cycle, titled _The Detroit Projects._ The three plays (in order) are:[21]

_Detroit '67_

This play "explores an explosive and decisive moment in a great American city. The play's compelling characters struggle with racial tension and economic instability."[22] It began its development at the Public Theater in New York where it was workshopped. _Detroit '67_ eventually went on to be featured the Classical Theatre of Harlem with the National Black Theatre. It was nominated for 8 _AUDELCO Theatre Awards,_ and received the 2014 Edward M. Kennedy Prize for Drama Inspired by American History.[23]

_Paradise Blue_

Former musician, Blue, decides to sell his beloved jazz club in order to live out his dreams. He is left with the moral dilemma of leaving his partner, Pumpkin, and his loyal jazz band behind. Morisseau developed this play first at Williamstown Theatre Festival, where it would eventually go on to have its world premiere in July 2015.[24] _Paradise Blue_ continued its development at the McCarter Theatre, New York Theatre Workshop, and the Public Theater. For this play, Morisseau received the L. Arnold Weissberger Award[25] in 2012.

_Skeleton Crew_

The final play in the cycle revolves around a group of auto-plant workers, grappling with the likely possibility of foreclosure and impending unemployment. _Skeleton Crew_ received a developmental production at the Lark Play Development Center.[26] Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, this play had its world premiere at the Off-Broadway Linda Gross Theater with the Atlantic Theatre Company in May 2016. _Skeleton Crew_ also won Morisseau the 2016 Obie Award Special Citation for Collaboration along with director Santiago-Hudson and the Atlantic Theater Company.[27] This play won the Edgerton Foundation New Play Award in 2015.[28]
