In mathematics, specifically commutative algebra, HILBERT'S BASIS THEOREM says that a polynomial ring over a Noetherian ring is Noetherian.


Statement

If R is a ring, let R[X] denote the ring of polynomials in the indeterminate X over R. Hilbert proved that if R is "not too large", in the sense that if R is Noetherian, the same must be true for R[X]. Formally,

  HILBERT'S BASIS THEOREM. If R is a Noetherian ring, then R[X] is a Noetherian ring.

  COROLLARY. If R is a Noetherian ring, then $R[X_1,\dotsc,X_n]$ is a Noetherian ring.

This can be translated into algebraic geometry as follows: every algebraic set over a field can be described as the set of common roots of finitely many polynomial equations. proved the theorem (for the special case of polynomial rings over a field) in the course of his proof of finite generation of rings of invariants.

Hilbert produced an innovative proof by contradiction using mathematical induction; his method does not give an algorithm to produce the finitely many basis polynomials for a given ideal: it only shows that they must exist. One can determine basis polynomials using the method of Gröbner bases.


Proof

    THEOREM. If R is a left (resp. right) Noetherian ring, then the polynomial ring R[X] is also a left (resp. right) Noetherian ring.

REMARK. We will give two proofs, in both only the "left" case is considered; the proof for the right case is similar.

First Proof

Suppose 𝔞 ⊆ R[X] is a non-finitely generated left-ideal. Then by recursion (using the axiom of dependent choice) there is a sequence {f₀, f₁, …} of polynomials such that if 𝔟_(n) is the left ideal generated by f₀, …, f_(n − 1) then f_(n) ∈ 𝔞 \ 𝔟_(n) is of minimal degree. It is clear that {deg (f₀), deg (f₁), …} is a non-decreasing sequence of naturals. Let a_(n) be the leading coefficient of f_(n) and let 𝔟 be the left ideal in R generated by a₀, a₁, …. Since R is Noetherian the chain of ideals

(_a_₀) ⊂ (_a_₀, _a_₁) ⊂ (_a_₀, _a_₁, _a_₂) ⊂ ⋯

must terminate. Thus 𝔟 = (a₀, …, a_(N − 1)) for some integer N. So in particular,

_a__(_N_) = ∑_(_i_ < _N_)_u__(_i_)_a__(_i_),  _u__(_i_) ∈ _R_.

Now consider

_g_ = ∑_(_i_ < _N_)_u__(_i_)_X_^(deg (_f__(_N_)) − deg (_f__(_i_)))_f__(_i_),

whose leading term is equal to that of f_(N); moreover, g ∈ 𝔟_(N). However, f_(N) ∉ 𝔟_(N), which means that f_(N) − g ∈ 𝔞 \ 𝔟_(N) has degree less than f_(N), contradicting the minimality.

Second Proof

Let 𝔞 ⊆ R[X] be a left-ideal. Let 𝔟 be the set of leading coefficients of members of 𝔞. This is obviously a left-ideal over R, and so is finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of 𝔞; say f₀, …, f_(N − 1). Let d be the maximum of the set {deg (f₀), …, deg (f_(N − 1))}, and let 𝔟_(k) be the set of leading coefficients of members of 𝔞, whose degree is  ≤ k. As before, the 𝔟_(k) are left-ideals over R, and so are finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of 𝔞, say

_f_₀^((_k_)), …, _f__(_N_^((_k_)) − 1)^((_k_))

with degrees  ≤ k. Now let 𝔞^(*) ⊆ R[X] be the left-ideal generated by:

{_f__(_i_),_f__(_j_)^((_k_)) : _i_<_N_,_j_<_N_^((_k_)),_k_<_d_}.

We have 𝔞^(*) ⊆ 𝔞 and claim also 𝔞 ⊆ 𝔞^(*). Suppose for the sake of contradiction this is not so. Then let h ∈ 𝔞 \ 𝔞^(*) be of minimal degree, and denote its leading coefficient by a.

    CASE 1: deg (h) ≥ d. Regardless of this condition, we have a ∈ 𝔟, so is a left-linear combination

_a_ = ∑_(_j_)_u__(_j_)_a__(_j_)

    of the coefficients of the f_(j). Consider

_h_₀ ≜ ∑_(_j_)_u__(_j_)_X_^(deg (_h_) − deg (_f__(_j_)))_f__(_j_),

    which has the same leading term as h; moreover h₀ ∈ 𝔞^(*) while h ∉ 𝔞^(*). Therefore h − h₀ ∈ 𝔞 \ 𝔞^(*) and deg (h − h₀) < deg (h), which contradicts minimality.

    CASE 2: deg (h) = k < d. Then a ∈ 𝔟_(k) so is a left-linear combination

_a_ = ∑_(_j_)_u__(_j_)_a__(_j_)^((_k_))

    of the leading coefficients of the f_(j)^((k)). Considering

_h_₀ ≜ ∑_(_j_)_u__(_j_)_X_^(deg (_h_) − deg (_f__(_j_)^((_k_))))_f__(_j_)^((_k_)),

    we yield a similar contradiction as in Case 1.

Thus our claim holds, and 𝔞 = 𝔞^(*) which is finitely generated.

Note that the only reason we had to split into two cases was to ensure that the powers of X multiplying the factors were non-negative in the constructions.


Applications

Let R be a Noetherian commutative ring. Hilbert's basis theorem has some immediate corollaries.

1.  By induction we see that $R[X_0,\dotsc,X_{n-1}]$ will also be Noetherian.
2.  Since any affine variety over R^(n) (i.e. a locus-set of a collection of polynomials) may be written as the locus of an ideal $\mathfrak a\subset R[X_0, \dotsc, X_{n-1}]$ and further as the locus of its generators, it follows that every affine variety is the locus of finitely many polynomials — i.e. the intersection of finitely many hypersurfaces.
3.  If A is a finitely-generated R-algebra, then we know that $A \simeq R[X_0, \dotsc, X_{n-1}] / \mathfrak a$, where 𝔞 is an ideal. The basis theorem implies that 𝔞 must be finitely generated, say $\mathfrak a = (p_0,\dotsc, p_{N-1})$, i.e. A is finitely presented.
