Biography

Early life

Fu enrolled to Secondary School in 1919 and went to Shanghai in 1921 to study French. During this period, he was affected by the May Fourth Movement and by the winter of 1921, he joined the newly founded Communist Party of China.[3] After returning from Russia in 1930, he assisted Zhou Enlai in Shanghai's personnel and military transport work and at the same time participated in the translation of the "Soviet Infantry Fighting Order" and "Soviet Political Work Regulations".[4]

During the Long March in 1935, Fu was responsible for communal distribution and conducting preparatory work for combat.[5] In August, he was elected as an alternate member of the 6th Central Committee.[6] Upon Zhang Guotao's attempt to set up an alternate communist base, Fu classified him as an "alternate member of the Politburo"[7] but refused to work for his branch of the central committee. Following the rendezvous between the 4th Red and 2nd Red Armies in July 1937 he became the director for Central Committee Northwest Organization Department that was based in Shaanbei. He was then appointed as the head of the political department in the Counter-Japanese Military and Political University.[8] HuangKecheng_DengXiaoping_and_Fuzhong.jpg, Deng Xiaoping, Fu Zhong]]
