"MOTHER FUYER" is a jump blues song, written and recorded by Dirty Red in 1947. The single was released by Aladdin Records on a 78 rpm, 10" shellac single record.


Background

The words "mother for you" or "mother fuyer", as minced oaths for "motherfucker", were used in blues and R&B records from the 1930s. Examples include Memphis Minnie's "Dirty Mother For You" (Decca Records, 1935) and Washboard Sam (1935),[1] plus Roosevelt Sykes in 1936,[2] with the slightly amended title of "Dirty Mother For You (Don't You Know)".[3] The singer Stick McGhee, whose recording of "Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee" was a hit in 1949, claimed that he had originally heard the song as "Drinking Wine, Motherfucker".[4][5]


Record

Red Nelson found no reason to be particularly oblique over the title of this jump blues track, which he recorded in 1947.[6] It was released using the nom de disque, DIRTY RED, by Aladdin Records (catalog reference 194A).[7] The effective minced oath seemed to have confused the censors.[8] The dirty blues lyrics included the lines "I got to put this mule to jumpin' in yo' stall, I'm a lovin' muther for ya".[9] The track, which Nelson claimed to be his own on the record label, was clearly a variant of the earlier songs of a similar nature and song title.

Dirty Red's "Mother Fuyer" has been listed on numerous compilation albums, including _The Aladdin Records Story_ (1994).[10] Dirty Red's recording was played on episode two of Bob Dylan's _Theme Time Radio Hour_, when the themed title was 'Mother'.[11]


Cover versions

The song was covered by Chick Willis on his 1972 album _Stoop Down Baby... Let Your Daddy See_,[12] and released as a B-side on a single on La Val Records.[13][14] Willis claimed songwriting credits.

The song was also covered by B.B. King in 1977 and appeared on his album, _King Size_, with King this time claiming ownership of the songwriting.[15] It was also on his subsequent compilation albums, _King of the Blues_ (1992) and _Ladies and Gentlemen... Mr. B.B. King_ (2012).

Magic Slim recorded a live cover version of "Mother Fuyer" for his 1987 album, _Live At B.L.U.E.S._[16]

Mama's Pride recorded the song for their 2006 live album, _A "Live" and Well_.[17]


Other variants

Johnny "Guitar" Watson had a hit in 1977 with "A Real Mother For Ya".[18]

Billy Boy Arnold included a song with the title "Dirty Mother Fuyer", as the opening track on his 1979 album, _Checkin' It Out_.[19]
