Possible causes of Cyberbaiting

Cyber experts say that it can be caused by the new powerful, technical tools that are available to impulsive teens. The perceptions teens have about the internet is also a factor since whatever is done on the internet can be anonymous. Another factor is the mob mentality – nobody feels responsible if it is done in a pack. A North Carolina teacher who had many years of experience teaching in the classroom mentors other teachers says that some teachers are more vulnerable to others. She believes that teachers need to establish who is in control.[3]
