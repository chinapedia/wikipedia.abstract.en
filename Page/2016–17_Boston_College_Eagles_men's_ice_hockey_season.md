The 2016–17 BOSTON COLLEGE EAGLES MEN'S ICE HOCKEY TEAM represented Boston College in the 2016–17 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. The team was coached by Jerry York, '67, his twenty-third season behind the bench at Boston College. The Eagles played their home games at Kelley Rink on the campus of Boston College, competing in Hockey East.

The Eagles competed in three tournaments during the 2016–17 season, the first of which took place during the traditional opening of the college hockey season at the 20th annual Ice Breaker Classic. Played on October 7 and 8 at Magness Arena in Denver, Colorado, the tournament showcased the Eagles playing Air Force in the first round, where they would lose a tight 2-1 match. Boston College faced host Denver in the consolation round, picking up a 3-1 victory for their first win of the season. Air Force would defeat Ohio State in the championship. The Eagles had previously won the ice breaker tournament three times; making their fifth appearance this season. The second tournament of the season took place during the holiday break, where the Eagles made the trip to the PPG Paints Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for their second appearance in the Three Rivers Classic in its fifth annual year. The Eagles fell 3–1 to the Quinnipiac Bobcats in the opening round, but picked up the 3rd-place result against Ferris State in the consolation round, winning the (unofficial) shootout of the (official) 1–1 tie. Boston College previously won the title in their first appearance at the tournament in 2012. For their final tournament of the season, the Eagles played in the 65th Annual Beanpot Tournament at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts on February 6 and 13. Boston College lost to rival Boston University 3–1 in the opening round (suffering their first season sweep against the Terriers since 1994–95), and were defeated by Northeastern 2–4 in the consolation game, marking the first 4th place finish for the Eagles since 1993 and the first of Jerry York's tenure.

The Eagles finished the season 21–15–5, and 13–6–3 in conference play, earning a share of the regular season title (shared with Boston University and UMass Lowell). They advanced to the Championship of the Hockey East tournament, but would fall to the UMass Lowell River Hawks by a score of 4–3. The Eagles failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament, having just missed the mark to earn an at-large bid; the Eagles missed out on the tournament for the first time since 2009.


Previous season recap

The Eagles entered the 2016–17 season following the school's record 25th trip to the Frozen Four in Tampa, Florida, where they would fall to Quinnipiac for the second year in the row. Additionally they fell in the semifinals of the Hockey East Tournament to Beanpot rival, Northeastern, who eventually won the title. The Eagles captured two trophies during the 2015–16 season, winning the Beanpot with a 1–0 OT victory over Boston University, and captured a share of the Hockey East regular season title (shared with Providence) off a strong 28–8–5 record and 15–2–5 in conference play.

Schedule

Regular season

|- !colspan=12 style=""| Exhibition |- !colspan=12 style=""| Regular Season |- !colspan=12 style=""| Hockey East Tournament

-   Preseason polls ranked the Eagles #5 (USCHO) and #9 (USA Today) nationally, and the Hockey East Coaches Poll ranked Boston College 6th in the conference.
-   On December 6, five Eagles were named to preliminary rosters of national teams competing at the 2017 World Juniors, three for the United States (D - Casey Fitzgerald, F - Colin White and G - Joe Woll) and two for Finland (D - Jesper Mattila and F - Julius Mattila).[15] All five would survive cuts to their respective final rosters.
-   During the Eagles trip to Pittsburgh to play in the Three Rivers Classic, the three Eagles representing the United State at the World Juniors won a gold medal after defeating Canada in the championship match in a stunning shootout. Colin White finished the tournament 8th in points scored (8) and 2nd in goals scored (7) while Joe Woll secured two victories for the US in the preliminary round. The Mattila twins would help Finland stave off relegation.
-   The five competing Eagles rejoined the team on January 8 to play at Frozen Fenway against Providence, which was postponed a day later from the 7th due to snowy conditions. Ryan Fitzgerald also made a comeback after healing from injury and missing the holiday tournament in Pittsburgh. The Eagles would win their 3rd victory at Fenway Park all time with a 3-1 defeat of the Friars.
-   On February 25, with a Notre Dame loss to Boston University, the Eagles finished in a three way tie for first place in the conference standings at the end of the season, sharing the title of Regular Season Champs with UMass Lowell and Boston University.
-   The Eagles season came to an end at the Hockey East tournament Championship, where they fell to the River Hawks 4–3. Without an auto-bid into the NCAA tournament, the Eagles would fail to qualify for an at-large bid via the pairwise ranking as the first team out; their first season without competing since 2009. The title game was the 17th appearance for the Eagles and first since 2012.
-   Several Eagles signed with professional teams in the offseason:
    -   Senior Matthew Guadreau with the Bridgeport Sound Tigers of the AHL on a tryout.[16]
    -   Senior Scott Savage with the Cleveland Monsters of the AHL on a tryout.[17]
    -   Senior Ryan Fitzgerald with his drafted team, the Boston Bruins of the NHL.[18]
    -   Senior Austin Cangelosi with the Albany Devils of the AHL.[19]
    -   Sophomore Colin White with his drafted team, the Ottawa Senators of the NHL.[20]
