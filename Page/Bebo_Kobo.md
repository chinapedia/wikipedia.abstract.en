Career

In the 1970's, Kobo was based in Hong Kong, as a clothing manufacturer, working closely with Richard Caring, who owned the Israeli fashion brand Jump. In the 1980s and 1990s, Kobo expanded into Florida and for a time was in partnership with the Nakash brothers in owning the American clothing company Jordache.[9]

In the 1990s, Kobo, Caring, and Elliott Bernerd, head of the British property company Chelsfield, teamed up to acquire London's Camden Market, with Kobo owning a 70% share. In 2014, they sold "a huge swathe" to fellow Israeli, the gambling billionaire Teddy Sagi, for Â£400 million.[10][11] The transaction was handled by PIR Equities, which is the private equity arm of Kobo's eldest son O.D. Kobo.

From 1998-2012, Kobo was the largest single property holder in the Camden area, with 9 acres of freehold property. Prior to purchasing Camden Market and properties, Kobo owned a similar market in Miami, Florida, for a number of years.[12]


Personal life

He is the father of businessman Oded David Kobo,[13] and has five other children.[14]

He is married to Israeli model Miri Bohadana.[15]

In 2015, he bought a 960 sq m house in Arsuf, an "exclusive cliff-top community", for NIS 106 million, as part of a creditors' arrangement for brothers Eliyahu and Moshe Shushan and brothers Gad and Dov Slook.[16][17]
