Starnet}}

A STAR NETWORK is an implementation of a spokeâ€“hub distribution paradigm in computer networks. In a star network, every host is connected to a central hub. In its simplest form, one central hub acts as a conduit to transmit messages.[1] The star network is one of the most common computer network topologies.

The hub and hosts, and the transmission lines between them, form a graph with the topology of a star. Data on a star network passes through the hub before continuing to its destination. The hub manages and controls all functions of the network. It also acts as a repeater for the data flow.

The star topology reduces the impact of a transmission line failure by independently connecting each host to the hub. Each host may thus communicate with all others by transmitting to, and receiving from, the hub. The failure of a transmission line linking any host to the hub will result in the isolation of that host from all others, but the rest of the network will be unaffected.[2]

The star configuration is commonly used with twisted pair cable and optical fibre cable. However, it can also be used with coaxial cable.


Advantages and disadvantages

Advantages

-   If one node or its connection breaks, it does not affect the other computers nor their connections[3]
-   Devices can be added or removed without disturbing the network
-   Works well under heavy load
-   Appropriate for a large network

Disadvantages

-   Expensive due to the number and length of cables needed to wire each host to the central hub[4]
-   The central hub is a single point of failure for the network
