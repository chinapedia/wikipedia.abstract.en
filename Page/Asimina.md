_ASIMINA_ is a genus of small trees or shrubs described as a genus in 1763.[1][2]

_Asimina_ has large simple leaves and large fruit. It is native to eastern North America and collectively referred to as PAWPAW. The genus includes the widespread common pawpaw _Asimina triloba,_ which bears the largest edible fruit indigenous to the continent.[3] Pawpaws are native to 26 states of the U.S. and to Ontario in Canada.[4][5] The common pawpaw is a patch-forming (clonal) understory tree found in well-drained, deep, fertile bottomland and hilly upland habitat. Pawpaws are in the same plant family (Annonaceae) as the custard-apple, cherimoya, sweetsop, soursop, and ylang-ylang;[6] the genus is the only member of that family not confined to the tropics.


Names

Michel_Adanson_(1727-1806).png The genus name _Asimina_ was first described and named by Michel Adanson, a French naturalist of Scottish descent. The name is adapted from the Native American name _assimin_[7] through the French colonial _asiminier._[8]

The common name PAWPAW, also spelled PAW PAW, PAW-PAW, and PAPAW, probably derives from the Spanish _papaya_, perhaps because of the superficial similarity of their fruits.


Description

Asimina_reticulata_flower.jpg Pawpaws are shrubs or small trees to tall. The northern, cold-tolerant common pawpaw (_Asimina triloba_) is deciduous, while the southern species are often evergreen.

The leaves are alternate, obovate, entire, long and broad.

The flowers of pawpaws are produced singly or in clusters of up to eight together; they are large, 4–6 cm across, perfect, with six sepals and petals (three large outer petals, three smaller inner petals). The petal color varies from white to purple or red-brown.

The fruit of the common pawpaw is a large edible berry, long and broad, weighing from , with numerous seeds; it is green when unripe, maturing to yellow or brown. It has a flavor somewhat similar to both banana and mango, varying significantly by cultivar, and has more protein than most fruits.[9]

Ecology

The common pawpaw is native to shady, rich bottom lands, where it often forms a dense undergrowth in the forest, often appearing as a patch or thicket of individual small slender trees.

Pawpaw flowers are insect-pollinated, but fruit production is limited since few if any pollinators are attracted to the flower's faint, or sometimes non-existent scent. The flowers produce an odor similar to that of rotting meat to attract blowflies or carrion beetles for cross pollination.[23] Other insects that are attracted to pawpaw plants include scavenging fruit flies, carrion flies and beetles. Because of difficult pollination, some believe the flowers are self-incompatible.

Pawpaw fruit may be eaten by foxes, opossums, squirrels and raccoons. However, pawpaw leaves and twigs are seldom consumed by rabbits or deer.[24]

The leaves, twigs, and bark of the common pawpaw tree contain natural insecticides known as acetogenins.[25]

Larvae of the zebra swallowtail butterfly feed exclusively on young leaves of the various pawpaw species, but never occur in great numbers on the plants.[26]


Cultivation and uses

Asimina_triloba_red_fern_farm.jpg Wild-collected fruits of the common pawpaw (_Asimina triloba_) have long been a favorite treat throughout the tree's extensive native range in eastern North America.[27] Fresh pawpaw fruits are commonly eaten raw; however, they do not store or ship well unless frozen.[28] The fruit pulp is also often used locally in baked dessert recipes, with pawpaw often substituted in many banana-based recipes.

Pawpaws have never been cultivated for fruit on the scale of apples and peaches, but interest in pawpaw cultivation has increased in recent decades.[29] However, only frozen fruit will store or ship well. Other methods of preservation include dehydration, production of jams or jellies, and pressure canning.

The pawpaw is also gaining in popularity among backyard gardeners because of the tree's distinctive growth habit, the appeal of its fresh fruit, and its relatively low maintenance needs once established. The common pawpaw is also of interest in ecological restoration plantings since this tree grows well in wet soil and has a strong tendency to form well-rooted clonal thickets.

The several other species of _Asimina_ have few economic uses.


History

The earliest documentation of pawpaws is in the 1541 report of the Spanish de Soto expedition, who found Native Americans cultivating it east of the Mississippi River. Chilled pawpaw fruit was a favorite dessert of George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson planted it at his home in Virginia, Monticello. The Lewis and Clark Expedition sometimes subsisted on pawpaws during their travels. The common pawpaw was designated as the Ohio state native fruit in 2009.[30][31]
