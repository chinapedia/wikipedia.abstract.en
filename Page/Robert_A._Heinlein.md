ROBERT ANSON HEINLEIN (;[1][2][3][4] July 7, 1907 – May 8, 1988) was an American science-fiction author, aeronautical engineer, and retired Naval officer. Sometimes called the "dean of science fiction writers",[5] he was among the first to emphasize scientific accuracy in his fiction, and was thus a pioneer of the subgenre of hard science fiction. His published works, both fiction and non-fiction, express admiration for competence and emphasize the value of critical thinking.[6] His work continues to have an influence on the science-fiction genre, and on modern culture more generally.

Heinlein became one of the first American science-fiction writers to break into mainstream magazines such as _The Saturday Evening Post_ in the late 1940s. He was one of the best-selling science-fiction novelists for many decades, and he, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke are often considered the "Big Three" of English-language science fiction authors.[7][8][9] Notable Heinlein works include _Stranger in a Strange Land_,[10] _Starship Troopers_ (which helped mould the space marine and mecha archetypes) and _The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress_.[11] His work sometimes had controversial aspects, such as plural marriage in _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_, militarism in _Starship Troopers_ and technologically competent women characters that were strong and independent,[12] yet often stereotypically feminine – such as _Friday_.

A writer also of numerous science-fiction short stories, Heinlein was one of a group of writers who came to prominence under the editorship (1937–1971) of John W. Campbell at _Astounding Science Fiction_ magazine, though Heinlein denied that Campbell influenced his writing to any great degree.

Heinlein used his science fiction as a way to explore provocative social and political ideas, and to speculate how progress in science and engineering might shape the future of politics, race, religion, and sex.[13] Within the framework of his science-fiction stories, Heinlein repeatedly addressed certain social themes: the importance of individual liberty and self-reliance, the nature of sexual relationships, the obligation individuals owe to their societies, the influence of organized religion on culture and government, and the tendency of society to repress nonconformist thought. He also speculated on the influence of space travel on human cultural practices.

Heinlein was named the first Science Fiction Writers Grand Master in 1974. [14] Four of his novels won Hugo Awards. In addition, fifty years after publication, seven of his works were awarded "Retro Hugos"—awards given retrospectively for works that were published before the Hugo Awards came into existence.[15] In his fiction, Heinlein coined terms that have become part of the English language, including "grok", "waldo", and "speculative fiction", as well as popularizing existing terms like "TANSTAAFL", "pay it forward", and "space marine". He also anticipated mechanical computer-aided design with "Drafting Dan" and described a modern version of a waterbed in his novel _Beyond This Horizon_,[16] though he never patented nor built one. In the first chapter of the novel _Space Cadet_ he anticipated the cell-phone, 35 years before Motorola invented the technology.[17] Several of Heinlein's works have been adapted for film and television.


Life

RAH_1929_Yearbook.png Heinlein, from the 1929 U.S. Naval Academy yearbook]]

Birth, childhood, and early education

Heinlein, born on July 7, 1907 to Rex Ivar Heinlein (an accountant) and Bam Lyle Heinlein, in Butler, Missouri, was the third of seven children. He was a 6th-generation German-American: a family tradition had it that Heinleins fought in every American war starting with the War of Independence.[18]

His childhood was spent in Kansas City, Missouri.[19] The outlook and values of this time and place (in his own words, "The Bible Belt") had a definite influence on his fiction, especially his later works, as he drew heavily upon his childhood in establishing the setting and cultural atmosphere in works like _Time Enough for Love_ and _To Sail Beyond the Sunset_. As a young child, the 1910 appearance of Halley's Comet inspired his life-long interest in astronomy.

When Heinlein graduated from Central High School in Kansas City in 1924, he aspired to a career as an officer in the US Navy. However, he was initially prevented from attending the US Naval Academy at Annapolis because his older brother Rex was a student there, and regulations discouraged multiple family members from attending the Academy simultaneously. He instead matriculated at Kansas City Community College and began vigorously petitioning Kansas Senator James A. Reed for an appointment to the Naval Academy. In part due to the influence of the Pendergast political machine, he was admitted to the Naval Academy in June, 1925.[20]

Navy

Heinlein's experience in the U.S. Navy exerted a strong influence on his character and writing. In 1929, he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, with the equivalent of a Bachelor of Arts degree in Engineering, ranking fifth in his class academically but with a class standing of 20th of 243 due to disciplinary demerits.[21] Shortly after graduation, he was commissioned as an ensign by the U. S. Navy. He advanced to lieutenant, junior grade while serving aboard the new aircraft carrier in 1931, where he worked in radio communications, then in its earlier phases, with the carrier's aircraft. The captain of this carrier was Ernest J. King, who served as the Chief of Naval Operations and Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Fleet during World War II. Heinlein was frequently interviewed during his later years by military historians who asked him about Captain King and his service as the commander of the U.S. Navy's first modern aircraft carrier. Heinlein also served as gunnery officer aboard the destroyer in 1933 and 1934, reaching the rank of lieutenant.[22] His brother, Lawrence Heinlein, served in the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, and the Missouri National Guard, reaching the rank of major general in the National Guard.[23]

Marriages

In 1929, Heinlein married Elinor Curry of Kansas City.[24] However, their marriage only lasted about a year.[25] His second marriage in 1932 to Leslyn MacDonald (1904–1981) lasted for 15 years. MacDonald was, according to the testimony of Heinlein's Navy friend, Rear Admiral Cal Laning, "astonishingly intelligent, widely read, and extremely liberal, though a registered Republican,"[26] while Isaac Asimov later recalled that Heinlein was, at the time, "a flaming liberal".[27] _(See section: Politics of Robert Heinlein.)_

At the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard Heinlein met and befriended a chemical engineer named Virginia "Ginny" Gerstenfeld. After the war, her engagement having fallen through, she moved to UCLA for doctoral studies in chemistry and made contact again.

As his second wife's alcoholism gradually spun out of control,[28] Heinlein moved out and the couple filed for divorce. Heinlein's friendship with Virginia turned into a relationship and on October 21, 1948 — shortly after the decree nisi came through — they married in the town of Raton, New Mexico, shortly after setting up housekeeping in Colorado. They remained married until Heinlein's death.

As Heinlein's increasing success as a writer resolved their initial financial woes, they had a house custom built with various innovative features, later described in an article in _Popular Mechanics_. In 1965, after various chronic health problems of Virginia's were traced back to altitude sickness, they moved to Santa Cruz, California, which is at sea level. They built a new residence in the adjacent village of Bonny Doon, California.[29] Robert and Virginia designed and built their California house themselves, which is in a circular shape.

Ginny undoubtedly served as a model for many of his intelligent, fiercely independent female characters.[30][31] She was a chemist and rocket test engineer, and held a higher rank in the Navy than Heinlein himself. She was also an accomplished college athlete, earning four letters.[32] In 1953–1954, the Heinleins voyaged around the world (mostly via ocean liners and cargo liners, as Ginny detested flying), which Heinlein described in _Tramp Royale_, and which also provided background material for science fiction novels set aboard spaceships on long voyages, such as _Podkayne of Mars_, _Friday_ and Job: A Comedy of Justice, the latter initially being set on a cruise much as detailed in _Tramp Royale_. Ginny acted as the first reader of his manuscripts. Isaac Asimov believed that Heinlein made a swing to the right politically at the same time he married Ginny.

California

In 1934, Heinlein was discharged from the Navy due to pulmonary tuberculosis. During a lengthy hospitalization, and inspired by his own experience while bed-ridden, he developed a design for a waterbed.[33]

After his discharge, Heinlein attended a few weeks of graduate classes in mathematics and physics at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), but he soon quit either because of his health or from a desire to enter politics.[34]

Heinlein supported himself at several occupations, including real estate sales and silver mining, but for some years found money in short supply. Heinlein was active in Upton Sinclair's socialist End Poverty in California movement in the early 1930s. When Sinclair gained the Democratic nomination for Governor of California in 1934, Heinlein worked actively in the campaign. Heinlein himself ran for the California State Assembly in 1938, but was unsuccessful.[35]

Author

While not destitute after the campaign — he had a small disability pension from the Navy — Heinlein turned to writing to pay off his mortgage. His first published story, "Life-Line", was printed in the August 1939 issue of _Astounding Science Fiction_.[36] Originally written for a contest, he sold it to _Astounding_ for significantly more than the contest's first-prize payoff. Another Future History story, "Misfit", followed in November.[37] Some saw Heinlein's talent and stardom from his first story,[38] and he was quickly acknowledged as a leader of the new movement toward "social" science fiction. In California he hosted the Mañana Literary Society, a 1940–41 series of informal gatherings of new authors.[39] He was the guest of honor at Denvention, the 1941 Worldcon, held in Denver. During World War II, he did aeronautical engineering for the U.S. Navy, also recruiting Isaac Asimov and L. Sprague de Camp to work at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Pennsylvania.[40]

As the war wound down in 1945, Heinlein began to re-evaluate his career. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, along with the outbreak of the Cold War, galvanized him to write nonfiction on political topics. In addition, he wanted to break into better-paying markets. He published four influential short stories for _The Saturday Evening Post_ magazine, leading off, in February 1947, with "The Green Hills of Earth". That made him the first science fiction writer to break out of the "pulp ghetto". In 1950, the movie _Destination Moon_ — the documentary-like film for which he had written the story and scenario, co-written the script, and invented many of the effects — won an Academy Award for special effects. Also, he embarked on a series of juvenile novels for the Charles Scribner's Sons publishing company that went from 1947 through 1959, at the rate of one book each autumn, in time for Christmas presents to teenagers. He also wrote for _Boys' Life_ in 1952.

Heinlein had used topical materials throughout his juvenile series beginning in 1947, but in 1958 he interrupted work on _The Heretic_ (the working title of _Stranger in a Strange Land_) to write and publish a book exploring ideas of civic virtue, initially serialized as _Starship Soldiers_. In 1959, his novel (now entitled _Starship Troopers_) was considered by the editors and owners of Scribner's to be too controversial for one of its prestige lines, and it was rejected.[41] Heinlein found another publisher (Putnam), feeling himself released from the constraints of writing novels for children. He had told an interviewer that he did not want to do stories that merely added to categories defined by other works. Rather he wanted to do his own work, stating that: "I want to do my own stuff, my own way".[42] He would go on to write a series of challenging books that redrew the boundaries of science fiction, including _Stranger in a Strange Land_ (1961) and _The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress_ (1966).

Later life and death

Beginning in 1970, Heinlein had a series of health crises, broken by strenuous periods of activity in his hobby of stonemasonry: in a private correspondence, he referred to that as his "usual and favorite occupation between books".[43] The decade began with a life-threatening attack of peritonitis, recovery from which required more than two years, and treatment of which required multiple transfusions of Heinlein's rare blood type, A2 negative. [44] As soon as he was well enough to write again, he began work on _Time Enough for Love_ (1973), which introduced many of the themes found in his later fiction.

In the mid-1970s, Heinlein wrote two articles for the _Britannica Compton Yearbook_.[45] He and Ginny crisscrossed the country helping to reorganize blood donation in the United States in an effort to assist the system which had saved his life.[46] At science fiction conventions to receive his autograph, fans would be asked to co-sign with Heinlein a beautifully embellished pledge form he supplied stating that the recipient agrees that they will donate blood. He was the guest of honor at the Worldcon in 1976 for the third time at MidAmeriCon in Kansas City, Missouri. At that Worldcon, Heinlein hosted a blood drive and donors' reception to thank all those who had helped save lives.

Beginning in 1977 and including an episode while vacationing in Tahiti in early 1978, he had episodes of reversible neurologic dysfunction due to transient ischemic attacks.[47] Over the next few months, he became more and more exhausted, and his health again began to decline. The problem was determined to be a blocked carotid artery, and he had one of the earliest known carotid bypass operations to correct it. Heinlein and Virginia had been smokers,[48] and smoking appears often in his fiction, as do fictitious strikable self-lighting cigarettes.[49]

In 1980 Robert Heinlein was a member of the Citizens Advisory Council on National Space Policy, chaired by Jerry Pournelle, which met at the home of SF writer Larry Niven to write space policy papers for the incoming Reagan Administration. Members included such aerospace industry leaders as former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, General Daniel O. Graham, aerospace engineer Max Hunter and North American Rockwell VP for Space Shuttle development George Merrick. Policy recommendations from the Council included ballistic missile defense concepts which were later transformed into what was called the Strategic Defense Initiative, or "Star Wars" as derided by Senator Ted Kennedy. Heinlein assisted with Council contribution to the Reagan "Star Wars" speech of Spring 1983.

Asked to appear before a Joint Committee of the United States Congress that year, he testified on his belief that spin-offs from space technology were benefiting the infirm and the elderly. Heinlein's surgical treatment re-energized him, and he wrote five novels from 1980 until he died in his sleep from emphysema and heart failure on May 8, 1988.

At that time, he had been putting together the early notes for another _World as Myth_ novel. Several of his other works have been published posthumously. Based on an outline and notes created by Heinlein in 1955, Spider Robinson has written the novel _Variable Star_. Heinlein's posthumously published nonfiction includes a selection of correspondence and notes edited into a somewhat autobiographical examination of his career, published in 1989 under the title _Grumbles from the Grave_ by his wife, Virginia; his book on practical politics written in 1946 published as _Take Back Your Government_; and a travelogue of their first around-the-world tour in 1954, _Tramp Royale_. The novels _Podkayne of Mars_ and _Red Planet_, which were edited against his wishes in their original release, have been reissued in restored editions. _Stranger In a Strange Land_ was originally published in a shorter form, but both the long and short versions are now simultaneously available in print.

Heinlein's archive is housed by the Special Collections department of McHenry Library at the University of California at Santa Cruz. The collection includes manuscript drafts, correspondence, photographs and artifacts. A substantial portion of the archive has been digitized and it is available online through the Robert A. and Virginia Heinlein Archives.[50]


Works

Heinlein published 32 novels, 59 short stories, and 16 collections during his life. Four films, two television series, several episodes of a radio series, and a board game have been derived more or less directly from his work. He wrote a screenplay for one of the films. Heinlein edited an anthology of other writers' SF short stories.

Three nonfiction books and two poems have been published posthumously. _For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs_ was published posthumously in 2003; _Variable Star_, written by Spider Robinson based on an extensive outline by Heinlein, was published in September 2006. Four collections have been published posthumously.[51]

Series

Over the course of his career Heinlein wrote three somewhat overlapping series.

-   Future History series
-   Lazarus Long series
-   The Heinlein juveniles

Early work, 1939–1958

Heinlein began his career as a writer of stories for _Astounding Science Fiction_ magazine, which was edited by John Campbell. The science fiction writer Frederik Pohl has described Heinlein as "that greatest of Campbell-era sf writers".[52] Isaac Asimov said that, from the time of his first story, the science fiction world accepted that Heinlein was the best science fiction writer in existence, adding that he would hold this title through his lifetime.[53]

Alexei and Cory Panshin noted that Heinlein's impact was immediately felt. In 1940, the year after selling 'Life-Line' to Campbell, he wrote three short novels, four novelettes, and seven short stories. They went on to say that "No one ever dominated the science fiction field as Bob did in the first few years of his career."[54] Alexei expresses awe in Heinlein's ability to show readers a world so drastically different from the one we live in now, yet have so many similarities. He says that "We find ourselves not only in a world other than our own, but identifying with a living, breathing individual who is operating within its context, and thinking and acting according to its terms."[55] Two_complete_science_adventure_books_1952win_n7.jpg'' was reprinted in _Two Complete Science-Adventure Books_ in 1952, appearing under the "Anson McDonald" byline even though the book edition had been published under Heinlein's own name four years earlier.]] Galaxy_195109.jpg''.]]

The first novel that Heinlein wrote, _For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs_ (1939), did not see print during his lifetime, but Robert James tracked down the manuscript and it was published in 2003. Though some regard it as a failure as a novel,[56] considering it little more than a disguised lecture on Heinlein's social theories, some readers took a very different view. In a review of it, John Clute wrote:

  I'm not about to suggest that if Heinlein had been able to publish [such works] openly in the pages of _Astounding_ in 1939, SF would have gotten the future right; I would suggest, however, that if Heinlein, and his colleagues, had been able to publish adult SF in _Astounding_ and its fellow journals, then SF might not have done such a grotesquely poor job of prefiguring something of the flavor of actually living here at the onset of 2004.[57]

_For Us, the Living_ was intriguing as a window into the development of Heinlein's radical ideas about man as a social animal, including his interest in free love. The root of many themes found in his later stories can be found in this book. It also contained a large amount of material that could be considered background for his other novels. This included a detailed description of the protagonist's treatment to avoid being banned to Coventry (a lawless land in the Heinlein mythos where unrepentant law-breakers are exiled).[58] Robert_Heinlein_Amazing_5304.jpg

It appears that Heinlein at least attempted to live in a manner consistent with these ideals, even in the 1930s, and had an open relationship in his marriage to his second wife, Leslyn. He was also a nudist;[59] nudism and body taboos are frequently discussed in his work. At the height of the Cold War, he built a bomb shelter under his house, like the one featured in _Farnham's Freehold_.[60]

After _For Us, The Living_, Heinlein began selling (to magazines) first short stories, then novels, set in a Future History, complete with a time line of significant political, cultural, and technological changes. A chart of the future history was published in the May 1941 issue of _Astounding_. Over time, Heinlein wrote many novels and short stories that deviated freely from the Future History on some points, while maintaining consistency in some other areas. The Future History was eventually overtaken by actual events. These discrepancies were explained, after a fashion, in his later World as Myth stories.

Heinlein's first novel published as a book, _Rocket Ship Galileo_, was initially rejected because going to the moon was considered too far-fetched, but he soon found a publisher, Scribner's, that began publishing a Heinlein juvenile once a year for the Christmas season.[61] Eight of these books were illustrated by Clifford Geary in a distinctive white-on-black scratchboard style.[62] Some representative novels of this type are _Have Space Suit—Will Travel_, _Farmer in the Sky_, and _Starman Jones_. Many of these were first published in serial form under other titles, e.g., _Farmer in the Sky_ was published as _Satellite Scout_ in the Boy Scout magazine _Boys' Life_. There has been speculation that Heinlein's intense obsession with his privacy was due at least in part to the apparent contradiction between his unconventional private life and his career as an author of books for children. However, _For Us, The Living_ explicitly discusses the political importance Heinlein attached to privacy as a matter of principle thus negating this line of reasoning.[63]

The novels that Heinlein wrote for a young audience are commonly called "the Heinlein juveniles", and they feature a mixture of adolescent and adult themes. Many of the issues that he takes on in these books have to do with the kinds of problems that adolescents experience. His protagonists are usually intelligent teenagers who have to make their way in the adult society they see around them. On the surface, they are simple tales of adventure, achievement, and dealing with stupid teachers and jealous peers. Heinlein was a vocal proponent of the notion that juvenile readers were far more sophisticated and able to handle more complex or difficult themes than most people realized. His juvenile stories often had a maturity to them that made them readable for adults. _Red Planet_, for example, portrays some subversive themes, including a revolution in which young students are involved; his editor demanded substantial changes in this book's discussion of topics such as the use of weapons by children and the misidentified sex of the Martian character. Heinlein was always aware of the editorial limitations put in place by the editors of his novels and stories, and while he observed those restrictions on the surface, was often successful in introducing ideas not often seen in other authors' juvenile SF.

In 1957, James Blish wrote that one reason for Heinlein's success "has been the high grade of machinery which goes, today as always, into his story-telling. Heinlein seems to have known from the beginning, as if instinctively, technical lessons about fiction which other writers must learn the hard way (or often enough, never learn). He does not always operate the machinery to the best advantage, but he always seems to be aware of it."[64]

1959–1960

Heinlein decisively ended his juvenile novels with _Starship Troopers_ (1959), a controversial work and his personal riposte to leftists calling for President Dwight D. Eisenhower to stop nuclear testing in 1958. "The 'Patrick Henry' ad shocked 'em", he wrote many years later. "_Starship Troopers_ outraged 'em."[65] _Starship Troopers_ is a coming-of-age story about duty, citizenship, and the role of the military in society.[66] The book portrays a society in which suffrage is earned by demonstrated willingness to place society's interests before one's own, at least for a short time and often under onerous circumstances, in government service; in the case of the protagonist, this was military service.

Later, in _Expanded Universe_, Heinlein said that it was his intention in the novel that service could include positions outside strictly military functions such as teachers, police officers, and other government positions. This is presented in the novel as an outgrowth of the failure of unearned suffrage government and as a very successful arrangement. In addition, the franchise was only awarded after leaving the assigned service; thus those serving their terms—in the military, or any other service—were excluded from exercising any franchise. Career military were completely disenfranchised until retirement.

The name _Starship Troopers_ was licensed for an unrelated, B movie script called _Bug Hunt at Outpost Nine_, which was then retitled to benefit from the book's credibility.[67] The resulting film, entitled _Starship Troopers_ (1997), which was written by Ed Neumeier and directed by Paul Verhoeven, had little relationship to the book, beyond the inclusion of character names, the depiction of space marines, and the concept of suffrage earned by military service. Fans of Heinlein were critical of the movie, which they considered a betrayal of Heinlein's philosophy, presenting the society in which the story takes place as fascist.[68]

Likewise, the powered armor technology that is not only central to the book, but became a standard subgenre of science fiction thereafter, is completely absent in the movie, where the characters use World War II-technology weapons and wear light combat gear little more advanced than that.[69] In Verhoeven's movie of the same name, there is no battle armor. Verhoeven commented that he had tried to read the book after he had bought the rights to it, in order to add it to his existing movie. However he read only the first two chapters, finding it too boring to continue. He thought it was a bad book and asked Ed Neumeier to tell him the story because he couldn't read it.[70]

Middle period work, 1961–1973

If_196211.jpg_, with a cover by Virgil Finlay.]] From about 1961 (_Stranger in a Strange Land_) to 1973 (_Time Enough for Love''), Heinlein explored some of his most important themes, such as individualism, libertarianism, and free expression of physical and emotional love. Three novels from this period, _Stranger in a Strange Land_, _The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress_, and _Time Enough for Love_, won the Libertarian Futurist Society's Prometheus Hall of Fame Award, designed to honor classic libertarian fiction.[71] Jeff Riggenbach described _The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress_ as "unquestionably one of the three or four most influential libertarian novels of the last century".[72]

Heinlein did not publish _Stranger in a Strange Land_ until some time after it was written, and the themes of free love and radical individualism are prominently featured in his long-unpublished first novel, _For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs_.

_The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress_ tells of a war of independence waged by the Lunar penal colonies, with significant comments from a major character, Professor La Paz, regarding the threat posed by government to individual freedom.

Although Heinlein had previously written a few short stories in the fantasy genre, during this period he wrote his first fantasy novel, _Glory Road_. In _Stranger in a Strange Land_ and _I Will Fear No Evil_, he began to mix hard science with fantasy, mysticism, and satire of organized religion. Critics William H. Patterson, Jr., and Andrew Thornton believe that this is simply an expression of Heinlein's longstanding philosophical opposition to positivism.[73] Heinlein stated that he was influenced by James Branch Cabell in taking this new literary direction. The penultimate novel of this period, _I Will Fear No Evil_, is according to critic James Gifford "almost universally regarded as a literary failure"[74] and he attributes its shortcomings to Heinlein's near-death from peritonitis.

Later work, 1980–1987

After a seven-year hiatus brought on by poor health, Heinlein produced five new novels in the period from 1980 (_The Number of the Beast_) to 1987 (_To Sail Beyond the Sunset_). These books have a thread of common characters and time and place. They most explicitly communicated Heinlein's philosophies and beliefs, and many long, didactic passages of dialog and exposition deal with government, sex, and religion. These novels are controversial among his readers and one critic, David Langford, has written about them very negatively.[75] Heinlein's four Hugo awards were all for books written before this period.

Most of the novels from this period are recognized by critics as forming an offshoot from the Future History series, and referred to by the term World as Myth.[76]

The tendency toward authorial self-reference begun in _Stranger in a Strange Land_ and _Time Enough for Love_ becomes even more evident in novels such as _The Cat Who Walks Through Walls_, whose first-person protagonist is a disabled military veteran who becomes a writer, and finds love with a female character.[77]

The 1982 novel _Friday_, a more conventional adventure story (borrowing a character and backstory from the earlier short story _Gulf_, also containing suggestions of connection to _The Puppet Masters_) continued a Heinlein theme of expecting what he saw as the continued disintegration of Earth's society, to the point where the title character is strongly encouraged to seek a new life off-planet. It concludes with a traditional Heinlein note, as in _The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress_ or _Time Enough for Love_, that freedom is to be found on the frontiers.

The 1984 novel _Job: A Comedy of Justice_ is a sharp satire of organized religion. Heinlein himself was agnostic.[78][79]

Posthumous publications

Several Heinlein works have been published since his death, including the aforementioned _For Us, The Living_ as well as 1989's _Grumbles from the Grave_, a collection of letters between Heinlein and his editors and agent; 1992's _Tramp Royale_, a travelogue of a southern hemisphere tour the Heinleins took in the 1950s; _Take Back Your Government_, a how-to book about participatory democracy written in 1946; and a tribute volume called _Requiem: Collected Works and Tributes to the Grand Master_, containing some additional short works previously unpublished in book form. _Off the Main Sequence_, published in 2005, includes three short stories never before collected in any Heinlein book (Heinlein called them "stinkeroos").

Spider Robinson, a colleague, friend, and admirer of Heinlein,[80] wrote _Variable Star_, based on an outline and notes for a juvenile novel that Heinlein prepared in 1955. The novel was published as a collaboration, with Heinlein's name above Robinson's on the cover, in 2006.

A complete collection of Heinlein's published work has been published[81] by the Heinlein Prize Trust as the "Virginia Edition", after his wife. See the Complete Works section of Robert A. Heinlein bibliography for details.

On February 1, 2019, Phoenix Pick announced that through a collaboration with the Heinlein Prize Trust, a reconstruction of the full text of an unpublished Heinlein novel had been produced. The reconstructed novel, tentatively entitled _The Pursuit of the Pankera: A Parallel Novel about Parallel Universes_, is an alternative version of _The Number of the Beast_, with the first one-third of _The Pursuit of the Pankera_ mostly the same as the first one-third of _The Number of the Beast_ but the remainder of _The Pursuit of the Pankera_ deviating entirely from _The Number of the Beast_, with a completely different story-line. The newly reconstructed novel pays homage to Edgar Rice Burroughs and E. E. “Doc” Smith. It is currently being edited by Patrick LoBrutto. Some reviewers describe the newly-reconstructed novel as more in line with the style of a traditional Heinlein novel than was 'The Number of the Beast.'[82] Both _The Pursuit of the Pankera_ and a new edition of _The Number of the Beast_ are planned to be published in the fourth quarter of 2019. The new edition of the latter will share the subtitle of _The Pursuit of the Pankera_, hence it will be titled _The Number of the Beast: A Parallel Novel about Parallel Universes_[83][84]

Influences

The primary influence on Heinlein's writing style may have been Rudyard Kipling. Kipling is the first known modern example of "indirect exposition", a writing technique for which Heinlein later became famous.[85] In his famous text on "On the Writing of Speculative Fiction", Heinlein quotes Kipling:

_Stranger in a Strange Land_ originated as a modernized version of Kipling's _The Jungle Book_, his wife suggesting that the child be raised by Martians instead of wolves. Likewise, _Citizen of the Galaxy_ can be seen as a reboot of Kipling's novel _Kim_.[86]

The _Starship Troopers_ idea of needing to serve in the military in order to vote, can be found in Kipling's "The Army of a Dream":

Poul Anderson once said of Kipling's science fiction story "As Easy as A.B.C.", "a wonderful science fiction yarn, showing the same eye for detail that would later distinguish the work of Robert Heinlein".

Heinlein described himself as also being influenced by George Bernard Shaw, having read most of his plays.[87] Shaw is an example of an earlier author who used the competent man, a favorite Heinlein archetype.[88] He denied, though, any direct influence of _Back to Methuselah_ on _Methuselah's Children_.

RAH_5311.jpg Heinlein's books probe a range of ideas about a range of topics such as sex, race, politics, and the military. Many were seen as radical or as ahead of their time in their social criticism. His books have inspired considerable debate about the specifics, and the evolution, of Heinlein's own opinions, and have earned him both lavish praise and a degree of criticism. He has also been accused of contradicting himself on various philosophical questions.[89]

Brian Doherty cites William Patterson, saying that the best way to gain an understanding of Heinlein is as a "full-service iconoclast, the unique individual who decides that things do not have to be, and won't continue, as they are." He says this vision is "at the heart of Heinlein, science fiction, libertarianism, and America. Heinlein imagined how everything about the human world, from our sexual mores to our religion to our automobiles to our government to our plans for cultural survival, might be flawed, even fatally so."[90]

The critic Elizabeth Anne Hull, for her part, has praised Heinlein for his interest in exploring fundamental life questions, especially questions about "political power—our responsibilities to one another" and about "personal freedom, particularly sexual freedom."[91]

Edward R. Murrow hosted a series on CBS Radio called This I Believe, which solicited an Entry from Heinlein that is probably the most enduring and popular of the title: Our Noble, Essential Decency. In it, Heinlein broke with the normal trends, stating that he believed in his neighbors (some of whom he named and described), community, and towns across America that share the same sense of good will and intentions as his own, going on to apply this same philosophy to the US, and humanity in general.

Politics

Heinlein's political positions shifted throughout his life. Heinlein's early political leanings were liberal.[92] In 1934, he worked actively for the Democratic campaign of Upton Sinclair for Governor of California. After Sinclair lost, Heinlein became an anti-Communist Democratic activist. He made an unsuccessful bid for a California State Assembly seat in 1938.[93] Heinlein's first novel, _For Us, The Living_ (written 1939), consists largely of speeches advocating the Social Credit system, and the early story "Misfit" (1939) deals with an organization -"The Cosmic Construction Corps" - that seems to be Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps translated into outer space.[94]

Of this time in his life, Heinlein later said:

Heinlein's fiction of the 1940s and 1950s, however, began to espouse conservative views. After 1945, he came to believe that a strong world government was the only way to avoid mutual nuclear annihilation. His 1949 novel _Space Cadet_ describes a future scenario where a military-controlled global government enforces world peace. Heinlein ceased considering himself a Democrat in 1954.[95]

The Heinleins formed the small "Patrick Henry League" in 1958, and they worked in the 1964 Barry Goldwater Presidential campaign.[96]

That ad was entitled Who Are the Heirs of Patrick Henry?. It started with the famous Henry quotation: "Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!!". It then went on to admit that there was some risk to nuclear testing (albeit less than the "willfully distorted" claims of the test ban advocates), and risk of nuclear war, but that "The alternative is surrender. We accept the risks." Heinlein was among those who in 1968 signed a pro-Vietnam War ad in _Galaxy Science Fiction_.[97]

Heinlein always considered himself a libertarian; in a letter to Judith Merril in 1967 (never sent) he said, "As for libertarian, I've been one all my life, a radical one. You might use the term 'philosophical anarchist' or 'autarchist' about me, but 'libertarian' is easier to define and fits well enough."[98]

_Stranger in a Strange Land_ was embraced by the hippie counterculture, and libertarians have found inspiration in _The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress_. Both groups found resonance with his themes of personal freedom in both thought and action.[99]

Race

Heinlein grew up in the era of racial segregation in the United States and wrote some of his most influential fiction at the height of the civil rights movement. He explicitly made the case for using his fiction not only to predict the future but to educate his readers about the value of racial equality and the importance of racial tolerance.[100] His early novels were very much ahead of their time both in their explicit rejection of racism and in their inclusion of protagonists of color—in the context of science fiction before the 1960s, the mere existence of characters of color was a remarkable novelty, with green occurring more often than brown.[101] For example, his 1948 novel _Space Cadet_ explicitly uses aliens as a metaphor for minorities. In his novel _Star Beast_, the _de facto_ foreign minister of the Terran government is an undersecretary, a Mr. Kiku, who is from Africa.[102] Heinlein explicitly states his skin is "ebony black", and that Kiku is in an arranged marriage that is happy.[103]

In a number of his stories, Heinlein challenges his readers' possible racial preconceptions by introducing a strong, sympathetic character, only to reveal much later that he or she is of African or other ancestry; in several cases, the covers of the books show characters as being light-skinned, when in fact the text states, or at least implies, that they are dark-skinned or of African ancestry.{{#Tag:Ref|The reference in _Tunnel in the Sky_ is subtle and ambiguous, but at least one college instructor who teaches the book reports that some students always ask, "Is he black?" (see[104]).

Critic and Heinlein scholar James Gifford (see bibliography) states: "A very subtle point in the book, one found only by the most careful reading and confirmed by Virginia Heinlein, is that Rod Walker is black. The most telling clues are Rod's comments about Caroline Mshiyeni being similar to his sister, and the 'obvious' (to all of the other characters) pairing of Rod and Caroline."[105]}} Heinlein repeatedly denounced racism in his non-fiction works, including numerous examples in _Expanded Universe_.

Heinlein reveals in _Starship Troopers_ that the novel's protagonist and narrator, Johnny Rico, the formerly disaffected scion of a wealthy family, is Filipino, actually named "Juan Rico" and speaks Tagalog in addition to English.

Race was a central theme in some of Heinlein's fiction. The most prominent and controversial example is _Farnham's Freehold_, which casts a white family into a future in which white people are the slaves of cannibalistic black rulers. In the 1941 novel _Sixth Column_ (also known as _The Day After Tomorrow_), a white resistance movement in the United States defends itself against an invasion by an Asian fascist state (the "Pan-Asians") using a "super-science" technology that allows ray weapons to be tuned to specific races. The book is sprinkled with racist slurs against Asian people, and black and Hispanic people are not mentioned at all. The idea for the story was pushed on Heinlein by editor John W. Campbell, and Heinlein wrote later that he had "had to re-slant it to remove racist aspects of the original story line" and that he did not "consider it to be an artistic success."[106][107] However, the novel prompted a heated debate in the scientific community regarding the plausibility of developing ethnic bioweapons.[108]

Individualism and self-determination

In keeping with his belief in individualism, his work for adults—and sometimes even his work for juveniles—often portrays both the oppressors and the oppressed with considerable ambiguity. Heinlein believed that individualism was incompatible with ignorance. He believed that an appropriate level of adult competence was achieved through a wide-ranging education, whether this occurred in a classroom or not. In his juvenile novels, more than once a character looks with disdain at a student's choice of classwork, saying, "Why didn't you study something useful?"[109] In _Time Enough for Love_, Lazarus Long gives a long list of capabilities that anyone should have, concluding, "Specialization is for insects." The ability of the individual to create himself is explored in stories such as _I Will Fear No Evil_, "{{'}}—All You Zombies—{{'}}", and "By His Bootstraps".

Heinlein claimed to have written _Starship Troopers_ in response to "calls for the unilateral ending of nuclear testing by the United States."[110] Heinlein suggests in the book that the Bugs are a good example of Communism being something that humans cannot successfully adhere to, since humans are strongly defined individuals, whereas the Bugs, being a collective, can all contribute to the whole without consideration of individual desire.[111]

Sexual issues

For Heinlein, personal liberation included sexual liberation, and free love was a major subject of his writing starting in 1939, with _For Us, The Living_. During his early period, Heinlein's writing for younger readers needed to take account of both editorial perceptions of sexuality in his novels, and potential perceptions among the buying public; as critic William H. Patterson has put it, his dilemma was "to sort out what was really objectionable from what was only excessive over-sensitivity to imaginary librarians".[112]

By his middle period, sexual freedom and the elimination of sexual jealousy became a major theme; for instance, in _Stranger in a Strange Land_ (1961), the progressively minded but sexually conservative reporter, Ben Caxton, acts as a dramatic foil for the less parochial characters, Jubal Harshaw and Valentine Michael Smith (Mike). Another of the main characters, Jill, is homophobic.[113]

According to Gary Westfahl,

  "Heinlein is a problematic case for feminists; on the one hand, his works often feature strong female characters and vigorous statements that women are equal to or even superior to men; but these characters and statements often reflect hopelessly stereotypical attitudes about typical female attributes. It is disconcerting, for example, that in _Expanded Universe_ Heinlein calls for a society where all lawyers and politicians are women, essentially on the grounds that they possess a mysterious feminine practicality that men cannot duplicate."[114]

In books written as early as 1956, Heinlein dealt with incest and the sexual nature of children. Many of his books including _Time for the Stars_, _Glory Road_, _Time Enough for Love_, and _The Number of the Beast_ dealt explicitly or implicitly with incest, sexual feelings and relations between adults and children, or both.[115] The treatment of these themes include the romantic relationship and eventual marriage, once the girl becomes an adult via time-travel, of a 30-year-old engineer and an 11-year-old girl in _The Door into Summer_ or the more overt intra-familial incest in _To Sail Beyond the Sunset_ and _Farnham's Freehold_. Heinlein often posed situations where the nominal purpose of sexual taboos was irrelevant to a particular situation, due to future advances in technology. For example, in _Time Enough for Love_ Heinlein describes a brother and sister (Joe and Llita) who were mirror twins, being complementary diploids with entirely disjoint genomes, and thus not at increased risk for unfavorable gene duplication due to consanguinity. In this instance, Llita and Joe were props used to explore the concept of incest, where the usual objection to incest — heightened risk of genetic defect in their children — was not a consideration.[116] Peers such as L. Sprague de Camp and Damon Knight have commented critically on Heinlein's portrayal of incest and pedophilia in a lighthearted and even approving manner.[117]

Philosophy

In _To Sail Beyond the Sunset_, Heinlein has the main character, Maureen, state that the purpose of metaphysics is to ask questions: "Why are we here?" "Where are we going after we die?" (and so on); and that you are not allowed to answer the questions. _Asking_ the questions is the point of metaphysics, but _answering_ them is not, because once you answer this kind of question, you cross the line into religion. Maureen does not state a reason for this; she simply remarks that such questions are "beautiful" but lack answers. Maureen's son/lover Lazarus Long makes a related remark in _Time Enough for Love_. In order for us to answer the "big questions" about the universe, Lazarus states at one point, it would be necessary to stand _outside_ the universe.

During the 1930s and 1940s, Heinlein was deeply interested in Alfred Korzybski's general semantics and attended a number of seminars on the subject. His views on epistemology seem to have flowed from that interest, and his fictional characters continue to express Korzybskian views to the very end of his writing career. Many of his stories, such as _Gulf_, _If This Goes On—_, and _Stranger in a Strange Land_, depend strongly on the premise, related to the well-known Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, that by using a correctly designed language, one can change or improve oneself mentally, or even realize untapped potential (as in the case of Joe in _Gulf_ – whose last name may be Greene, Gilead or Briggs).[118]

When Ayn Rand's novel _The Fountainhead_ was published, Heinlein was very favorably impressed, as quoted in "Grumbles ..." and mentioned John Galt—the hero in Rand's _Atlas Shrugged_—as a heroic archetype in _The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress_. He was also strongly affected by the religious philosopher P. D. Ouspensky.[119] Freudianism and psychoanalysis were at the height of their influence during the peak of Heinlein's career, and stories such as _Time for the Stars_ indulged in psychological theorizing.

However, he was skeptical about Freudianism, especially after a struggle with an editor who insisted on reading Freudian sexual symbolism into his juvenile novels. Heinlein was fascinated by the social credit movement in the 1930s. This is shown in _Beyond This Horizon_ and in his 1938 novel _For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs_, which was finally published in 2003, long after his death.

Pay it forward

The term "pay it forward", though it was already in occasional use as a quotation, was popularized by Robert A. Heinlein in his book _Between Planets_,[120] published in 1951:

Heinlein was a mentor to Ray Bradbury, giving him help and quite possibly passing on the concept, made famous by the publication of a letter from him to Heinlein thanking him.[121] In Bradbury's novel _Dandelion Wine_, published in 1957, when the main character Douglas Spaulding is reflecting on his life being saved by Mr. Jonas, the Junkman:

Bradbury has also advised that writers he has helped thank him by helping other writers.

Heinlein both preached and practiced this philosophy; now the Heinlein Society, a humanitarian organization founded in his name, does so, attributing the philosophy to its various efforts, including Heinlein for Heroes, the Heinlein Society Scholarship Program, and Heinlein Society blood drives.[122] Author Spider Robinson made repeated reference to the doctrine, attributing it to his spiritual mentor Heinlein.[123]


Influence and legacy

The Dean of Science Fiction Writers

Heinlein is usually identified, along with Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, as one of the three masters of science fiction to arise in the so-called Golden Age of science fiction, associated with John W. Campbell and his magazine _Astounding_.[124] In the 1950s he was a leader in bringing science fiction out of the low-paying and less prestigious "pulp ghetto". Most of his works, including short stories, have been continuously in print in many languages since their initial appearance and are still available as new paperbacks decades after his death.

He was at the top of his form during, and himself helped to initiate, the trend toward social science fiction, which went along with a general maturing of the genre away from space opera to a more literary approach touching on such adult issues as politics and human sexuality. In reaction to this trend, hard science fiction began to be distinguished as a separate subgenre, but paradoxically Heinlein is also considered a seminal figure in hard science fiction, due to his extensive knowledge of engineering and the careful scientific research demonstrated in his stories. Heinlein himself stated—with obvious pride—that in the days before pocket calculators, he and his wife Virginia once worked for several days on a mathematical equation describing an Earth-Mars rocket orbit, which was then subsumed in a single sentence of the novel _Space Cadet_.

Writing style

Heinlein is often credited with bringing serious writing techniques to the genre of science fiction.

For example, when writing about fictional worlds, previous authors were often limited by the reader's existing knowledge of a typical "space opera" setting, leading to a relatively low creativity level: The same starships, death rays, and horrifying rubbery aliens becoming ubiquitous. This was necessary unless the author was willing to go into long expositions about the setting of the story, at a time when the word count was at a premium in SF.

But Heinlein utilized a technique called "indirect exposition", perhaps first introduced by Rudyard Kipling in his own science fiction venture, the Aerial Board of Control stories. Kipling had picked this up during his time in India.[125] This technique — mentioning details in a way that lets the reader infer more about the universe than is actually spelled out[126] became a trademark rhetorical technique of both Heinlein and generation of writers influenced by him. Heinlein was significantly influenced by Kipling beyond this, for example quoting him in On the Writing of Speculative Fiction.[127]

Likewise, Heinlein's name is often associated with the competent hero, a character archetype who, though he or she may have flaws and limitations, is a strong, accomplished person able to overcome any soluble problem set in their path. They tend to feel confident overall, have a broad life experience and set of skills, and not give up when the going gets tough. This style influenced not only the writing style of a generation of authors, but even their personal character. Harlan Ellison once said, "Very early in life when I read Robert Heinlein I got the thread that runs through his stories—the notion of the competent man ... I've always held that as my ideal. I've tried to be a very competent man."[128]

While Heinlein used this style, in part, as a role model to the reader, it also has appeal to the self-image of general competence among many science fiction readers, who may see themselves as having technical ability, wide-ranging knowledge, an understanding of science, and great problem-solving skill, all of which feel unappreciated in school and work.

Heinlein's Rules of Writing

When fellow writers, or fans, wrote Heinlein asking for writing advice, he famously gave out his own list of rules for becoming a successful writer:

1.  You must write.
2.  Finish what you start.
3.  You must refrain from rewriting, except to editorial order.
4.  You must put your story on the market.
5.  You must keep it on the market until it has sold.

About which he said:

Heinlein later published an entire article, "On the Writing of Speculative Fiction", which included his rules, and from which the above quote is taken. When he says "anything said above them", he refers to his other guidelines. For example, he describes most stories as fitting into one of a handful of basic categories:

-   The Gadget Story
-   The Human Interest Story
-   Boy Meets Girl
-   The Little Tailor
-   The Man-Who-Learned-Better

In the article, Heinlein credits L. Ron Hubbard as having identified "The Man-Who-Learned-Better".

Influence among writers

Heinlein has had a pervasive influence on other science fiction writers. In a 1953 poll of leading science fiction authors, he was cited more frequently as an influence than any other modern writer.[129] Critic James Gifford writes that

  "Although many other writers have exceeded Heinlein's output, few can claim to match his broad and seminal influence. Scores of science fiction writers from the prewar Golden Age through the present day loudly and enthusiastically credit Heinlein for blazing the trails of their own careers, and shaping their styles and stories."[130]

Heinlein gave Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle extensive advice on a draft manuscript of _The Mote in God's Eye_.[131] He contributed a cover blurb "Possibly the finest science fiction novel I have ever read." Writer David Gerrold, responsible for creating the tribbles in _Star Trek_, also credited Heinlein as the inspiration for his _Dingilliad_ series of novels. Gregory Benford refers to his novel _Jupiter Project_ as a Heinlein tribute. Similarly, Charles Stross says his Hugo Award-nominated novel _Saturn's Children_ is "a space opera and late-period Robert A. Heinlein tribute",[132] referring to Heinlein's _Friday_.[133] The theme and plot of Kameron Hurley's novel, THE LIGHT BRIGADE clearly echo those of Heinlein's STARSHIP TROOPERS.[134]

Words and phrases coined

Outside the science fiction community, several words and phrases coined or adopted by Heinlein have passed into common English usage:

-   Waldo, protagonist in the eponymous short story "Waldo", whose name came to mean mechanical or robot arms in the real world that are akin to the ones used by the character in the story.
-   TANSTAAFL, short for There Ain't No Such Thing as a Free Lunch, an existing term that refers to the fact that things supposedly given free always have some real cost, popularized in _The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress_.
-   Moonbat[135] used in United States politics as a pejorative political epithet referring to progressives or leftists, was originally the name of a space ship in his story _Space Jockey_.
-   Grok, a "Martian" word for understanding a thing so fully as to become one with it, from _Stranger in a Strange Land_.
-   Space marine, an existing term popularized by Heinlein in short stories, the concept then being made famous by _Starship Troopers_, though the term "space marine" is not used in that novel.
-   Speculative fiction, a term Heinlein used for the separation of serious, consistent Science Fiction writing, from the pop "sci fi" of the day, which generally took great artistic license with human knowledge, amounting to being more like space fantasy than _science_ fiction.

Inspiring culture and technology

In 1962, Oberon Zell-Ravenheart (then still using his birth name, Tim Zell) founded the Church of All Worlds, a Neopagan religious organization modeled in many ways (including its name) after the treatment of religion in the novel _Stranger in a Strange Land_. This spiritual path included several ideas from the book, including non-mainstream family structures, social libertarianism, water-sharing rituals, an acceptance of all religious paths by a single tradition, and the use of several terms such as "grok", "Thou art God", and "Never Thirst". Though Heinlein was neither a member nor a promoter of the Church, there was a frequent exchange of correspondence between Zell and Heinlein, and he was a paid subscriber to their magazine, _Green Egg_. This Church still exists as a 501(C)(3) religious organization incorporated in California, with membership worldwide, and it remains an active part of the neopagan community today.[136]

Heinlein was influential in making space exploration seem to the public more like a practical possibility. His stories in publications such as _The Saturday Evening Post_ took a matter-of-fact approach to their outer-space setting, rather than the "gee whiz" tone that had previously been common. The documentary-like film _Destination Moon_ advocated a Space Race with an unspecified foreign power almost a decade before such an idea became commonplace, and was promoted by an unprecedented publicity campaign in print publications. Many of the astronauts and others working in the U.S. space program grew up on a diet of the Heinlein juveniles, best evidenced by the naming of a crater on Mars after him, and a tribute interspersed by the Apollo 15 astronauts into their radio conversations while on the moon.[137]

Heinlein was also a guest commentator for Walter Cronkite during Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin's Apollo 11 moon landing. He remarked to Cronkite during the landing that, "This is the greatest event in human history, up to this time. This is—today is New Year's Day of the Year One."[138] Businessman and entrepreneur Elon Musk says that Heinlein's books have helped inspire his career.[139]

Heinlein Society

The Heinlein Society was founded by Virginia Heinlein on behalf of her husband, to "pay forward" the legacy of the writer to future generations of "Heinlein's Children." The foundation has programs to:

-   "Promote Heinlein blood drives."
-   "Provide educational materials to educators."
-   "Promote scholarly research and overall discussion of the works and ideas of Robert Anson Heinlein."

The Heinlein society also established the Robert A. Heinlein Award in 2003 "for outstanding published works in science fiction and technical writings to inspire the human exploration of space."[140][141]

In popular culture

-   In the 1967 _Star Trek_ television episode "The Trouble with Tribbles", the title creatures in the episode resembled the Martian flat cats in Heinlein's 1952 novel _The Rolling Stones_. Script writer David Gerrold was concerned that he had inadvertently plagiarized the novel which he had read fifteen years before.[142] These concerns were brought up by a research team, who suggested that the rights to the novel should be purchased from Heinlein. One of the producers phoned Heinlein, who only asked for a signed copy of the script and later sent a note to Gerrold after it aired to thank him for the script.[143]
-   In the 2001 novel _The Counterfeit Heinlein_ by Laurence M. Janifer, Heinlein appears indirectly as the purported author of an ancient manuscript, supposedly one of his unpublished stories, "The Stone Pillow".[144]
-   Author John Varley, also a Heinlein fan, coined the term _Heinleiner_ in his novels _Steel Beach_ and _The Golden Globe_. The term is now considered slang for rugged individualists.[145][146]
-   MUSIC
    -   In 1971, progressive rock band Yes released a three-part song called "Starship Trooper" on their album _The Yes Album_. The title was taken from the novel. Lyricist Jon Anderson said he got the idea of a "Starship Trooper being another guardian angel and Mother Earth".
    -   In 1974, Jimmy Webb used the author's title _The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress_ for his song of the same name.[147]
    -   The U2 song "Stranger in a Strange Land" was named for the novel.[148]
    -   Many people have collected the various parts of the Heinlein "song" The Green Hills of Earth – Heinlein used this trope in various stories, the characters occasionally mentioning the song and even quoting lines from it – and put them to music.[149][150][151]


Honors

Robheinlein-6312.jpgous asteroid]] In his lifetime, Heinlein received four Hugo Awards, for _Double Star_, _Starship Troopers_, _Stranger in a Strange Land_, and _The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress_, and was nominated for four Nebula Awards, for _Stranger in a Strange Land_, _Friday_, _Time Enough for Love_, and _Job: A Comedy of Justice_.[152] He was also given seven Retro-Hugos: two for best novel: "Beyond This Horizon" and "Farmer in the Sky"; Three for best novella: :"If This Goes On ...", "Waldo", and "The Man Who Sold the Moon"; one for best novelette: "The Roads Must Roll"; and one for best dramatic presentation: "Destination Moon".[153][154][155]

The Science Fiction Writers of America named Heinlein its first Grand Master in 1974, presented 1975. Officers and past presidents of the Association select a living writer for lifetime achievement (now annually and including fantasy literature).[156][157]

Main-belt asteroid 6312 Robheinlein (1990 RH4), discovered on September 14, 1990 by H. E. Holt, at Palomar was named after him.[158]

There is no lunar feature named explicitly for Heinlein, but in 1994 the International Astronomical Union named Heinlein crater on Mars in his honor.[159][160]

The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Heinlein in 1998, its third class of two deceased and two living writers and editors.[161]

In 2001 the United States Naval Academy created the Robert A. Heinlein Chair In Aerospace Engineering.[162]

In 2016, after an intensive online campaign to win a vote for the opening, Heinlein was inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians.[163] His bronze bust, created by Kansas City sculptor E. Spencer Schubert, is on permanent display in the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City.[164]

The Libertarian Futurist Society has honored five of Heinlein's novels and two short stories with their Hall of Fame award.[165] The first two were given during his lifetime for _The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress_ and _Stranger in a Strange Land_. Five more were awarded posthumously for _Red Planet_, _Methuselah's Children_, _Time Enough for Love_, and the short stories _Requiem_ and _Coventry_.

[35] Heinlein was running as a left-wing Democrat in a conservative district, and he never made it past the Democratic primary because of trickery by his Republican opponent (afterword to _For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs_, 2004 edition, p. 247, and the story "A Bathroom of Her Own"). Also, an unfortunate juxtaposition of events had a Konrad Henlein making headlines in the Sudetenlands.

[45] On Paul Dirac and antimatter, and on blood chemistry. A version of the former, titled _Paul Dirac, Antimatter, and You_, was published in the anthology _Expanded Universe_, and it demonstrates both Heinlein's skill as a popularizer and his lack of depth in physics. An afterword gives a normalization equation and presents it, incorrectly, as being the Dirac equation.

[63] The importance Heinlein attached to privacy was made clear in his fiction, _e.g._, _For Us, the Living_, but also in several well-known examples from his life. He had a falling out with Alexei Panshin, who wrote an important book analyzing Heinlein's fiction; Heinlein stopped cooperating with Panshin because he accused Panshin of "[attempting to] pry into his affairs and to violate his privacy." Heinlein wrote to Panshin's publisher threatening to sue, and stating, "You are warned that only the barest facts of my private life are public knowledge ..." Enter.net. In his 1961 guest of honor speech at Seacon, the Worldcon in Seattle, he advocated building bomb shelters and caching away unregistered weapons, Enter.net and his own house in Colorado Springs included a bomb shelter. Heinlein was a nudist, and built a fence around his house in Santa Cruz to keep out the counterculture types who had learned of his ideas through _Stranger in a Strange Land_. In his later life, Heinlein studiously avoided revealing his early involvement in left-wing politics, Enter.net, and made strenuous efforts to block publication of information he had revealed to prospective biographer Sam Moskowitz.Enter.net

Verhoeven went returned to genre territory, optioning a script from his _Robocop_ collaborator Ed Neumeier entitled _Bug Hunt at Outpost 9_ 9 and refashioning it with elements from Robert Heinlein's _Starship Troopers_. A loose adaptation at best, Verhoeven saw the potential in another science fiction satire and pursued it head-on

[86] "Rudyard Kipling considered as a Science Fiction writer"
But the best way to understand why Kipling has exerted so great an influence over modern science fiction is to read his own work. Begin with _Kim_, the most successful evocation of an alien world ever produced in English. Follow the Grand Trunk Road toward the Northwest Frontier, and watch the parade of cultures that young Kimball O'Hara encounters. Place yourself in his position, that of a half-assimilated stranger in a strange land; and observe carefully the uneven effects of an ancient society's encounter with a technologically advanced culture. SF writers have found Kim so appealing that several have told their own versions of the story: Robert Heinlein's _Citizen of the Galaxy_ and Poul Anderson's _The Game of Empire_ are two of the best.

[125] Rudyard Kipling Invented SF!
Kipling had learned this trick in India. His original Anglo-Indian readership knew the customs and institutions and landscapes of British India at first hand. But when he began writing for a wider British and American audience, he had to provide his new readers with enough information for them to understand what was going on. In his earliest stories and verse he made liberal use of footnotes, but he evolved more subtle methods as his talent matured. A combination of outright exposition, sparingly used, and contextual clues, generously sprinkled through the narrative, offered the needed background. In Kim and other stories of India he uses King James English to indicate that characters are speaking in Hindustani; this is never explained, but it gets the message across subliminally.

[126] The Writer's Writing Guide: Exposition
With indirect exposition, the writer gives the reader the data in subtle but clear ways, thereby allowing the reader to be a partner when it comes to laying the foundation of the story. For instance, the narrator of Mona Simpson's story "Lawns" begins by telling us: "I steal. I've stolen books and money and even letters. Letters are great. I can't tell you the feeling walking down the street with 20 dollars in my purse, stolen earrings in my pocket." With this opening, we learn about the narrator's obsession with theft but, equally important, we learn the narrator's gender. This is done indirectly, by referring to the narrator's purse and the desire for stolen earrings.
