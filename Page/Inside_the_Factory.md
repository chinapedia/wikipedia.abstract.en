He follows the production of Britain’s best-selling lager from raw barley to finished cans. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey is learning how four basic ingredients – water, malted barley, hops and yeast – can be manipulated to make dark, heavy ales, light, fragrant lagers and everything in between. She is also uncovering the secrets of the perfect pint in a scientific study. Historian Ruth Goodman is asking why Burton became the centre of brewing in Britain in the 19th century.

  Gregg Wallace is in Germany, at a historic factory which produces 600,000 pencils a day. He also discovers why pencils are hexagonal. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey is at Manchester University examining the astonishing properties of graphite. She is also investigating the science behind graphology and asking if we can evaluate personality from handwriting style. Historian Ruth Goodman is on the trail of the very earliest pencils in the Lake District.

  Gregg Wallace is in Gateshead at a cheese factory where they produce 3,000 tonnes of spreadable cheese every year. He follows the production of jalapeno chilli flavour cheese from a 28,000 litre delivery of milk to 5,400 squeezy tubes. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey is finding out how bacteria are responsible for the huge variety in smell, taste and appearance of different types of cheese. Historian Ruth Goodman is finding out how cheddar, originally just one of hundreds of regional varieties in the UK, became the predominant hard cheese world wide.
