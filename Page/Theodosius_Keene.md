THEODOSIUS KEENE, born in 1754, was an English architect who conducted most of his work in the south of England between 1770 and 1777.[1]


Life and work

Theodosius was born around 1754 as the son of notable English architect Henry Keene, famous for his Gothic Revival and Neoclassical buildings.[2]

He designed Racton Monument around 1770, a red brick turreted folly in West Sussex, possibly built as a summerhouse for the nearby Stansted Estate.[3][4] Racton Monument stands to this day, albeit a ruin. In 1777 he designed the Maidenhead Guildhall, a replacement for the original medieval building which was constructed around 1430.[5][6] It consisted of a council chamber, assembly room, a corn exchange, a lockup and also held a beer house called the ‘Fighting Cocks Inn’.[7] The guildhall was demolished in February 1963 to make way for the Town Hall.[8][9] It is also believed that in 1794 he completed Radcliffe Observatory, under the direction of James Wyatt, since his father died before finishing the building.
