HIGH SEAS DRIFTNET FISHERIES ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1992 is United States declaration citing an observance of the United Nations international driftnet fishery conservation program to restrict large scale driftnet fishing in high seas or international waters. The Act of Congress acknowledges the United Nations General Assembly Resolutions imposing a global moratorium on all high seas driftnet fishing by December 31, 1992.[1][2][3] In accordance with Title 16 section 1857, the United States federal law 102-582 proclaims the Magnusonâ€“Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act prohibits the application of large scale driftnet fishing within an exclusive economic zone of any sovereign state and the United States.

The 1992 legislation was drafted as House Bill H.R. 2152 and Senate Bill S. 884.[4] The H.R. 2152 bill superseded the S. 884 bill which was passed by the 102nd United States Congressional session and enacted into law by the 41st President of the United States George H.W. Bush on November 2, 1992.[5]
