BOAZ TSABAN (born February 1973) is an Israeli mathematician on the faculty of Bar-Ilan University. His research interests include selection principles within set theory and nonabelian cryptology, within mathematical cryptology.


Biography

Boaz Tsaban grew up in Or Yehuda, a city near Tel Aviv. At the age of 16 he was selected with other high school students to attend the first cycle of a special preparation program in mathematics, at Bar-Ilan University, being admitted to regular mathematics courses at the University a year later. He completed his B.Sc., M.Sc. and Ph.D.[1] degrees with highest distinctions. Two years as a post-doctoral fellow at Hebrew University were followed by a three-year Koshland Fellowship at the Weizmann Institute of Science before he joined the Department of Mathematics, Bar-Ilan University in 2007.


Academic career

In the field of selection principles, Tsaban devised the method of omission of intervals [2] for establishing covering properties of sets of real numbers that have certain combinatorial structures. In nonabelian cryptology he devised the algebraic span method [3] ,[4] that solved a number of computational problems that underlie a number of proposals for nonabelian public-key cryptographic schemes (such as the commutator key exchange).


Awards and recognition

Tsaban's doctoral dissertation, supervised by Hillel Furstenberg, won, with Irit Dinur, the Nessyahu prize[5] for the best Ph.D. in mathematics in Israel in 2003. In 2009 he won the Wolf Foundation Krill Prize[6] for Excellence in Scientific Research.
