PROVIDENCE HOSPITAL was a 408-bed hospital located in the District of Columbia, United States. Founded in 1861, it was the longest continuously operating hospital and the last public hospital in the District. Providence Hospital was a member of Ascension Health, the largest non-profit health care organization in the United States.[1]

Providence Health System consisted of Providence Hospital (the main hospital), as well as several offsite clinics and healthcare facilities: Carroll Manor, Seton House, Perry Family Health Center, and Fort Lincoln Family Medicine Center.

Providence maintained full accreditation by The Joint Commission and was also licensed by the District of Columbia Department of Health.

On October 16, 2017 the obstetrics unit was closed as part of a cost-savings measure.[2] Patients received notice less than two months before the unit closed. Previously, Providence delivered between 1,500 to 2,000 babies a year.[3]

In September 2018, Ascension announced that it would close the main hospital by the end of the year but continue operating its medical office buildings and Carroll Manor. The closing plan became a source of controversy for Ascension Health, the largest non-profit health care system in the United States. The hospital served some of the most disadvantaged residents of the district. [4][5]In December most of the hospitals services ended but under pressure and a lawsuit from the city government, the Emergency Department and ten inpatient beds remained open until April 30, 2019,[6] at which point all remaining services were closed after 158 years of continuous service.
