HANNAH ELIZABETH BRADBURY GOODWIN TALCOTT (n√©e, Hannah Elizabeth Bradbury; better known by her pen name, H. B. GOODWIN or MRS. H. B. GOODWIN, and sometimes as H. E. B. or '''H. B. G. '''; 1827 - June 1, 1893) was a 19th-century American novelist from the U.S. state of Maine.


Early years and education

Hannah Elizabeth Bradbury was born in Chesterville, Maine, but was a resident of Boston, Massachusetts, for many years. She was the daughter of the late Benjamin B. and Elizabeth Lowell Bradbury. Her school life was spent mainly in Farmington Academy.


Career

Before her marriage, she had written many short stories and sketches, which were published in magazines and papers over her initials, H. E. B. Goodwin was a successful teacher of girls in Bangor, Maine, and afterward. she was principal of the Charlestown Female Seminary. The judicious criticism and commendation of her teacher, Prof. Alexander H. Abbott, first stimulated her ambition to be known as an author, but her pen was mainly inspired by her desire to assist in educating young women. For 15 years, Goodwin was associated with the educational work of Wellesley College. She was an active member of its board of trustees and of its executive committee, and also wrote and read to the students of Wellesley many essays on art, the studies for which were made in the great art centers of Europe, where she traveled in England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.

Her first novel was _Madge_ (New York, 1864), and was favorably received. Goodwin regarded it as the least worthy of her books. Her second book, _Sherbrooke_ (New York, 1866'), is a story of New England life. The success of that story was instantaneous. Her third book, _Dr. Howell's Family_ (Boston, 1869), was written during months of great physical pain, and many readers regard it as the author's strongest work. After the publication of that book, Goodwin was for several years an invalid and employed her pen only in writing short stories and sketches and letters from Europe to religious newspapers. _One Among Many_ (Boston, 1884), added to the well earned success of its author and gave new evidence of her ability to represent real life. Another of her well-known stories is _Christine's Fortune_ (Boston), a picture of German life. _Our Party of Four_ (Boston, 1887), describes a tour in Spain. Perhaps to _Dorothy Gray_ the highest praise came from critics and literary friends. She also compiled a volume of essays on art and history. She died on June 1, 1893.
