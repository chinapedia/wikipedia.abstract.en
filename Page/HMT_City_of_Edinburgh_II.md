War service

The Admiralty requisitioned _City of Edinburgh_ in 1914, but then returned her to her owners. On 10 January 1915 the Admiralty again requisitioned her for war service. She received a 6-pounder gun and operated out of St Mary's, Isles of Scilly, as an auxiliary patrol vessel.

_City of Edinburgh_ helped transport the Liverpool Rifles from Southampton to Le Havre on 24 February 1915.

When the troop-transport was torpedoed on 24 April 1917 (Anzac Day), _City of Edinburgh_ was one of the vessels that helped ensure the safe evacuation of all 1,600 troops aboard, as well as _Ballarat_{{'}}s crew.


Post-war

The Admiralty sold her in 1918 to British owners, who sold her in 1921 to Spanish owners.

On 4 January 1952 she became stranded on Cap Blanc, Spanish Sahara (), and became a total loss.
