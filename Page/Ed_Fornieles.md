EDWARD "ED" FORNIELES (born 6 April 1983) is an English artist. His works are responsive to the movement of information. Fornieles uses film, social media platforms, sculpture, installation and performance to express the interaction of family, relationships, popular memes, language and the subcultures of 21st century experience. His work operates within the logic of immersive simulations, which construct and enact alternative political and social spaces. His projects often involve cultural, social, and infrastructural production, making interventions that reconfigure the viewer’s position and sense of self.[1]


Biography

Fornieles was born in rural Hampshire, where his parents had an architectural practice. Fornieles attended the University of Oxford, receiving his BFA from the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art in 2005. He went on to the Royal College of Art in London, completing an M.A. in sculpture in 2011. While in graduate school, Fornieles worked as a studio assistant to Anish Kapoor, where he demonstrated his extensive technical skills.[2] Living in East London, he often worked as a freelance data analyst[3] while he immersed himself in art and curating, having established in 2007 (with Ross McNicol and Vanessa Carlos), the Wallis Gallery.[4] During this time Fornieles work evolved mocking, often with a dark sense of humour, the high seriousness of the London art scene.[5]

Ed Fornieles has lived and worked in London, Los Angeles, and Montreal.


Work

Davay_Glubzhe.jpg Fornieles was first recognized for his performance pieces such as _Animal House_ (2011)[6] at the experimental space, Guest Projects in London. _Animal House_ helped refine a method that Fornieles would repeat in his subsequent works, engaging participants and viewers in sometimes awkward situations.[7] _Dorm Daze_, grew out of Fornieles' interest in American fraternity culture as a large-scale on-line performance played-out on Facebook, where participants adopted profiles taken from real life American college students.[8] Fornieles work focuses on the effect of narratives, habits, and technology in the formation of social roles and personal identity. He uses performance to re-enact and distort relationships to archetypes and conventions. Each chapter of work is driven by an intense period of research centered on reinterpreting and remodeling the subject under investigation. _The Dreamy Awards_ (2012),[9] was a fictional ceremony initiated to raise questions about the cult of the awards bash. The work was presented at the Serpentine Galleries Park Nights with the participation of over 200 people, including actor Zac Efron, in a pre-recorded video clip. Other works include, _New York New York Happy Happy (NY NY HP HP)_ (2013) where Fornieles was invited by _Rhizome_ to organize a gala at the New Museum.[10] The event was controversial because Fornieles scripted both actual Museum donors and actors, blurring any sense of reality. _Modern Family_ (2014) was a sullen installation where Fornieles explored the breakdown of the family both metaphorically and literally.[11]

Ed Fornieles first solo gallery exhibition, _The Hangover Part II_, constructed from the detritus of _Animal House_, was organized at the Carlos/Ishikawa Gallery, London in 2011. Other significant sculptural installations include _Characterdate, Frame_ (2012), at the Frieze Art Fair, London,[12] where he continued demonstrating his interest in American college culture. _Despicable Me 2_ (2013) at the Mihai Nicodim Gallery in Los Angeles,[13] invented a female character, "Britney Rivers" who develops a stereotypical personality as she builds her network of friends on Social Media. With _Jupiter Ascending_ (2015) at Carl Kostyal, Stockholm, Fornieles recreated a spa reflecting the meditative culture associated with care of the body and _Der Geist: Flesh Feast_ (2016) at Arratia Beer in Berlin continued the body theme in which Fornieles expressed, through film, objects, and installation, his attempt to adopt a self-management diet. Fornieles has also been invited to participate in important group shows curated to bring together postinternet creators. These include _Meanwhile... Suddenly, and Then_ curated by Gunnar B. Kvaranat for the 12e Biennale d'art contemporain de Lyon,[14] _Family state of mind_ (2014) with Petra Cortright at Galerie Chez Valentin in Paris,[15] and _I feel we think bad_ (2016) with Hannah Perry and Matt Goerzen at Arsenal in Montreal.[16]


Personal life

In 2013, Fornieles broke up with his partner of ten years, actress Felicity Jones, whom he had met at Oxford.[17]
