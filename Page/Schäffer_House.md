The SCHÄFFER HOUSE is an 18th-century, bourqoise townhouse located at Magstræde 6 in the Old Town of Copenhagen, Denmark. The building is also called '''Hofsnedkerens Gård ''' after Diderich Schäffer for whom it was built. Schäffer's interior Rococo decorations from the first floor are now on display in the National Museum as part of the Magstræde Apartment.


History

Diderich Schäffer was called to Denmark in circa 1730 to work on Christiansborg Palace. The house in Magstræde was built for him by Philip de Lange in 1733–34. He lived in the ground floor and had his workshop in the rear wing and possibly part of the side wing. The more elegant apartment on the first floor was rented out.

In 1755–56, Schäffer constructed the country house Schæffergården at Jægersborg north of Copenhagen. His plan was to sell it but it proved difficult and he ended up owning it until 1771.[1] He died in 1778.

The historian and civil servant Ove Malling lived in the building from 1776 to 1780. The naval officer Peder Norden Sølling lived in the building in 1787–88. He is most notable for founding Bombebøssen in Christianshavn.


Architecture

Magstræde_-_sidebygning_01.jpg The house is five bays wide and has a three-bay central projection. The rounded pediment was added in 1850.[2] The rear side of the building is built with exposed timber framing.

The gateway opens to a long, narrow courtyard. A 13 bay long side wing with exposed timber framing extends from the rear side of the building along the left-hand side of the courtyard. A rear wing is located at the bottom of the courtyard.


Interior

Schäffer's rich interior Rococo decorations from his house are now on display in the National Museum.[3][4]
