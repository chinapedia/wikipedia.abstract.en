CANNABIS IN ICELAND is illegal. Offenses such as sale and cultivation are heavily punished and can result in jail time.[1][2] Possession of small amounts will not result in jail time, but offenders will still be subject to arrest and payment of a fine.[3]


History

Cannabis was first banned on 14 October 1969, when a regulation was set to ban cannabis.[4] The regulation added cannabis to an existing anti-opium regulation, due to concerns about rising popularity among youth.[5] In 1974 the ban was added to the Icelandic legislation.[6]
