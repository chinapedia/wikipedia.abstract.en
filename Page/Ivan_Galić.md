IVAN GALIĆ (born 9 January 1995) is a Croatian footballer who plays for HNK Cibalia in Croatian First Football League.


Club career

Galić started off at a lower-tier club in Slavonski Šamac, moving on to NK Slavonac CO. At the age of 14, he moved to Zagreb and joined NK Trnje. A year after, he joined the NK Lokomotiva academy. At 18 years of age, he joined NK Rudeš for half a season, making his first senior appearances in the Druga HNL, before returning to NK Lokomotiva.[1]

In June 2014, he signed a three-year contract with NK Istra 1961.[2] After spending the first half of the season playing for the third-tier reserve team, Galić moved on to another third-tier team, NK Vrapče, where he played as a right back. Subsequently, Galić moved back to Druga HNL to NK Lučko, but his stay at the club echoed the previous ones, lasting for half a season before he moved abroad for the first time – to FK Rabotnički.[3]

In the summer of 2016, he moved to Albania, signing a contract with Flamurtari Vlorë.[4]
