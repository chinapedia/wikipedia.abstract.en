The KAISERWAGEN is a preserved carriage built for, and still periodically operating on, the Wuppertal Suspension Railway in 1900.

It was this carriage in which Kaiser Wilhelm II and his consort Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein rode when they visited Wuppertal on 24 October 1900. Both the carriage, and the overall suspension-railway system, have been designated protected monuments since 26 May 1997.

The Kaiserwagen is currently available for private charters such weddings, meetings, and ceremonies, in addition to being used in publicity by the railway operators.
