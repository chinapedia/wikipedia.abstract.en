More specifically, it refers to a specified volume, measured in either imperial or US customary measures, primarily applied to alcoholic beverages, such as wine, ale, or cider.


Varieties and standardisation

A TOBACCO HOGSHEAD was used in British and American colonial times to transport and store tobacco. It was a very large wooden barrel. A standardized hogshead measured long and in diameter at the head (at least , depending on the width in the middle). Fully packed with tobacco, it weighed about .

A _' hogshead_' contains about .[1]

The _Oxford English Dictionary_ (OED) notes that the hogshead was first standardized by an act of Parliament in 1423, though the standards continued to vary by locality and content. For example, the OED cites an 1897 edition of _Whitaker's Almanack_, which specified the number of gallons of wine in a hogshead varying by type of wine: claret (presumably) , port , sherry ; and Madeira . The _American Heritage Dictionary_ claims that a hogshead can consist of anything from (presumably) .

Eventually, a hogshead of wine came to be , while a hogshead of beer or ale is 64 gallons (250 L if old beer/ale gallons, 245 L if imperial).

A hogshead was also used as unit of measurement for sugar in Louisiana for most of the 19th century. Plantations were listed in sugar schedules as having produced _x_ number of hogsheads of sugar or molasses. A hogshead was also used for the measurement of herring fished for sardines in Blacks Harbour, New Brunswick.


Etymology

The etymology of hogshead is uncertain. According to English philologist Walter William Skeat (1835–1912), the origin is to be found in the name for a cask or liquid measure appearing in various forms in several Germanic languages, in Dutch _oxhooft_ (modern _okshoofd_), Danish _oxehoved_, Old Swedish _oxhuvud_, etc. The word should therefore be "oxhead", "hogshead" being a mere corruption. It has been suggested that the name arose from the branding of such a measure with the head of an ox.[2]
