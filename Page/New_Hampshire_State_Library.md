The NEW HAMPSHIRE STATE LIBRARY is a library in Concord, New Hampshire, and also a state agency, overseen since 2017 by the New Hampshire Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (DNCR).[1] The physical building is located across the street from the New Hampshire State House.


History

The library's origins pre-date the United States: "The beginnings of the State Library were in 1717 and it is generally considered to be the oldest such institution in the United States."[2] Originally housed in Portsmouth, the state library has been located in Concord since 1808.[3] The current building opened in 1895, and also housed the New Hampshire Supreme Court until 1970.[4]
