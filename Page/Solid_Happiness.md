_SOLID HAPPINESS_ is an oil on canvas painted in Italy by the Chilean artist Roberto Matta in 1997. Germana Ferrari Matta, the painter's last companion and the cataloguer of his oeuvre, certified the work on 28 April 2001.[1]


Procedence and history of the painting

The painting went from the _Diana Lowenstein gallery_ in Buenos Aires to the _Galería Almirante_ in Madrid and from there to Sotheby's auction house in New York, before being acquired by Fundación Carlos Slim for the Latin American Vanguard and Art collection of Museo Soumaya.

Barbara Eschenburg has written: "...Matta feels obliged to transmit messages in his work that come from the subconscious through the psyche, combining perceptiotns, reflections, and knowledge. Through them he formulates large questions..."[2]

The painting was included in the exhibition _El año de los 000_ organized by the Fundación Telefónica in Santiago de Chile from April 7 to July 2, 2000.
