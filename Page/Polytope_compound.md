A POLYHEDRAL COMPOUND is a figure that is composed of several polyhedra sharing a common centre. They are the three-dimensional analogs of polygonal compounds such as the hexagram.

The outer vertices of a compound can be connected to form a convex polyhedron called the convex hull. The compound is a facetting of the convex hull.

Another convex polyhedron is formed by the small central space common to all members of the compound. This polyhedron can be used as the CORE for a set of stellations.


Regular compounds

A regular polyhedron compound can be defined as a compound which, like a regular polyhedron, is vertex-transitive, edge-transitive, and face-transitive. There are five regular compounds of polyhedra.

Best known is the compound of two tetrahedra, often called the stella octangula, a name given to it by Kepler. The vertices of the two tetrahedra define a cube and the intersection of the two an octahedron, which shares the same face-planes as the compound. Thus it is a stellation of the octahedron, and in fact, the only finite stellation thereof.

The stella octangula can also be regarded as a dual-regular compound.

The compound of five tetrahedra comes in two enantiomorphic versions, which together make up the compound of 10 tetrahedra. Each of the tetrahedral compounds is self-dual, and the compound of 5 cubes is dual to the compound of 5 octahedra.

Coxeter's notation for regular compounds is given in the table above, incorporating Schläfli symbols. The material inside the square brackets, [_d_{_p_,_q_}], denotes the components of the compound: _d_ separate {_p_,_q_}'s. The material _before_ the square brackets denotes the vertex arrangement of the compound: _c_{_m_,_n_}[_d_{_p_,_q_}] is a compound of _d_ {_p_,_q_}'s sharing the vertices of an {_m_,_n_} counted _c_ times. The material _after_ the square brackets denotes the facet arrangement of the compound: [_d_{_p_,_q_}]_e_{_s_,_t_} is a compound of _d_ {_p_,_q_}'s sharing the faces of {_s_,_t_} counted _e_ times. These may be combined: thus _c_{_m_,_n_}[_d_{_p_,_q_}]_e_{_s_,_t_} is a compound of _d_ {_p_,_q_}'s sharing the vertices of {_m_,_n_} counted _c_ times _and_ the faces of {_s_,_t_} counted _e_ times. This notation can be generalised to compounds in any number of dimensions.[1]


Dual compounds

A DUAL compound is composed of a polyhedron and its dual, arranged reciprocally about a common intersphere or midsphere, such that the edge of one polyhedron intersects the dual edge of the dual polyhedron. There are five such compounds of the regular polyhedra.

The core is the rectification of both solids. The hull is the dual of this rectification, and its faces have the intersecting edges of the two solids as diagonals. For the convex solids this is the convex hull.

+----------------------------------------------------+---------+--------------------------------+-------------------------+-----------+

The tetrahedron is self-dual, so the dual compound of a tetrahedron with its dual is the regular stellated octahedron.

The octahedral and icosahedral dual compounds are the first stellations of the cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron, respectively.


Uniform compounds

In 1976 John Skilling published _Uniform Compounds of Uniform Polyhedra_ which enumerated 75 compounds (including 6 as infinite prismatic sets of compounds, #20-#25) made from uniform polyhedra with rotational symmetry. (Every vertex is vertex-transitive and every vertex is transitive with every other vertex.) This list includes the five regular compounds above. 1

The 75 uniform compounds are listed in the Table below. Most are shown singularly colored by each polyhedron element. Some chiral pairs of face groups are colored by symmetry of the faces within each polyhedron.

Other compounds

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --

  These compounds, of four cubes, and (dual) four octahedra, are neither regular compounds, nor dual compounds, nor uniform compounds.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --

-   Compound of three octahedra
-   Compound of four cubes

Two polyhedra that are compounds but have their elements rigidly locked into place are the small complex icosidodecahedron (compound of icosahedron and great dodecahedron) and the great complex icosidodecahedron (compound of small stellated dodecahedron and great icosahedron). If the definition of a uniform polyhedron is generalised they are uniform.

The section for entianomorphic pairs in Skilling's list does not contain the compound of two great snub dodecicosidodecahedra, as the pentagram faces would coincide. Removing the coincident faces results in the compound of twenty octahedra.

Only the first two of these dual compounds are also regular.


Group theory

In terms of group theory, if _G_ is the symmetry group of a polyhedral compound, and the group acts transitively on the polyhedra (so that each polyhedron can be sent to any of the others, as in uniform compounds), then if _H_ is the stabilizer of a single chosen polyhedron, the polyhedra can be identified with the orbit space _G_/_H_ – the coset _gH_ corresponds to which polyhedron _g_ sends the chosen polyhedron to.


Compounds of tilings

There are eighteen two-parameter families of regular compound tessellations of the Euclidean plane. In the hyperbolic plane, five one-parameter families and seventeen isolated cases are known, but the completeness of this listing has not been enumerated.

The Euclidean and hyperbolic compound families 2 {_p_,_p_} (4 ≤ _p_ ≤ ∞, _p_ an integer) are analogous to the spherical stella octangula, 2 {3,3}.

  : A few examples of Euclidean and hyperbolic regular compounds

A known family of regular Euclidean compound honeycombs in five or more dimensions is an infinite family of compounds of hypercubic honeycombs, all sharing vertices and faces with another hypercubic honeycomb. This compound can have any number of hypercubic honeycombs.

There are also _dual-regular_ tiling compounds. A simple example is the E² compound of a hexagonal tiling and its dual triangular tiling, which shares its edges with the deltoidal trihexagonal tiling. The Euclidean compounds of two hypercubic honeycombs are both regular and dual-regular.
