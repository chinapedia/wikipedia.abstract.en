_JUNCUS DICHOTOMUS_ (common name is FORKED RUSH[1]) is a monocot which belongs to the Juncaceae family of rushes. The plant is native in the Americas in temperate zones but has been introduced to other parts of the world. The species is often confused with other _Juncus_ plants due to morphological similarity. _Juncus dichotomus_ often is found in areas which prove to be very moist, and rainfall is a common occurrence. _Juncus dichotomus_ is often most recognizable in the spring and summer months of the year due to its conspicuous flowers and infructescence.

This plant can be difficult to identify due in part to its similar appearance to other _Juncus_ species.[2] Often _Juncus dichotomus_ is overlooked because it is inconspicuous in the field, and some can be difficult to identify and some consider _Juncus dichotomus_ a weed.


Description

_Juncus dichotomus_ is a graminoid, i.e., a grass-like plant.[3] _Juncus dichotomus_ belongs to the monocot group in which it is a member of a _Juncaceae_ family otherwise known as the rushes.[4] While this species of rush is not tall and lacks many distinctive features making it especially hard to identify by non-specialists. In North America July through August is when _Juncus dichotomus_ is most frequently observed. _Juncus dichotomus_ can occur in dry sites but it thrives best in soils that are damp, such as a roadside ditches where runoff is frequent.[5][6]


Habitat/distribution

_Juncus dichotomus_ is native and distributed widely in the Americas in temperate zones but has been reported as introduced in other temperate climate zones. _Juncus dichotomus_ is a more specialized species least temporarily wet habitats: riverbanks, pond margins, depressions in heaths, sometimes also near rice fields.[7] Flowering and fruiting occurs in late spring—summer in ditches, shores, clearings, and other typically open areas, usually in sandy, well-drained (but frequently wet) soil.[8] _Juncus dichotomus_ usually grows in sandy soils.[9] Any habitat that hold sufficient groundwater with stable temperate temperatures, then this location has the capability to hold a population of _J. dichotomus._

Taxonomy

[12] .[13] _Juncus dichotomus_ is considered perennial herbs to 10 dm. Rhizomes densely branched to short creeping. Cataphylls 1--3. Leaves basal; auricles 0.2--0.5(--0.6) mm, scarious to leathery; blade nearly terete, channeled or flat, 10–25(--40) cm(0.5--)0.7--1(--1.2) mm, margins entire. Inflorescences terminal, (5--)10–85(--100)-flowered, congested to somewhat loose, (1--)2.5--10–13) cm; primary bract usually exceeding inflorescence. Flowers: bracteoles 2; tepals green, lanceolate, (3--)3.3--4.5(--5.5) mm; outer and inner series nearly equal; stamens 6, filaments 0.6--1.2 mm, anthers 0.4--0.8(--1) mm; style 0.2 mm. Capsules tan to brown, 1-locular to pseudo-3-locular, ellipsoid to widely. Seeds brownish to amber, ellipsoid to lunate, 0.3--0.4 mm, not tailed. 2n = ca. 80.[14]


Uses

The uses for _Juncus dichotomus_ are limited. Since the plant is often found next to or near water sources which may play a role in preventing erosion.


Management

_Juncus dichotomus_, a native of the Americas, is also now being reported as invasive in Europe.[15] _Juncus dichotomous_ has been confused with _Juncus tenuis,_ a very widespread plant, in Europe which may have contributed to its spread there.[16] Throughout the southeastern United States and some Northeastern parts on the US found there _dichotomus_ is common.[17] Systemic rusts and smuts have a major effect on individual plants and populations as they affect growth and survival and diseased plants may become distorted, stunted and/or elongated although the results are variable.[18] More work on the life history of _J. dichotomus_ is required to better understand how it responds to disease and other abiotic factors.[19] Management of this species as an invasive in Europe is unclear, although water regime is important and may be manipulated to control the plant as well as herbicides


History

It is clear that _Juncus dichotomus_ has increased its range substantially due to human aided dispersal. Although the biogeographic history of _J. dichotomus_ is somewhat unclear due in part to its similarities with other graminoid species.[20]
