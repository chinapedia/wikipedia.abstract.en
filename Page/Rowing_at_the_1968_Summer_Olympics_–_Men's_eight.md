The MEN'S COXED EIGHT competition at the 1968 Summer Olympics took place at Virgilio Uribe Rowing and Canoeing Course, Mexico City, Mexico. It was held from 13 to 19 October and was won by the team from West Germany, with the teams from Australia and the Soviet Union claiming silver and bronze respectively.


Background

The United States had won this event at the last eight of nine Olympics, only missing out in 1960. West Germany was one of the favourites, as they had won the last four European Championships and the last two World Championships (in 1962 and 1966). The Soviet Union had a number of silver medal placings at recent events and were also among the favourites.[1]

Races were held in up to six lanes. Twelve teams from 12 nations attended the competition.[2] Five of the teams replaced a total of six rowers during the competition, making for a total of 114 rowers who participated in the races.


Results

Rowers are shown as per the seats occupied in the official results book published by the Organizing Committee of the Games of the XIX Olympiad.

Heats

Two heats were rowed on 13 October. The winning teams qualified for the final, and the remaining teams progressed to the repechage.[3]

Heat 2

The _Official Report of the Organising Committee_ lists Michael Livingston in seat 7 of the United States boat, but this is incorrect, as he travelled to the 1968 Games as a reserve only.[4] It was his elder brother, Cleve Livingston, who sat in seat 7 for the heat and final.[5]
