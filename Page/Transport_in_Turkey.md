This article deals with the system of TRANSPORT IN TURKEY, both public and private.


Rail transport

Rail network

The TCDD - Türkiye Devlet Demir Yolları (Turkish State Railways) possess 10,984 km of gauge, of which 2,336 km are electrified (2005).[1]

There are daily regular passenger trains all through the network.[2] TCDD has started an investment program of building 5.000 km high-speed lines until 2023. By February 2014, three high speed train routes are running. Ankara-Eskişehir, Ankara-Konya and Eskişehir-Konya.

The freight transportation is mainly organized as block trains for domestic routes, since TCDD discourages under 200 to loads by surcharges.

In 2004, Marmaray project started on a rail tunnel under the Bosphorus straits.

Between Istanbul and Ankara, a high speed railroad line is being constructed now next to the normal speed railroad which is being renovated. When finished, travel time between the two major cities will reduce from 6,5 hours to 3 hours and 10 minutes, using trains ordered from Spain that can reach up to 250 km/h. Construction of a high speed railroad line between Ankara and Konya was begun in order to connect the two cities with a direct line and reduced travel time from several hours to approximately one hour. The high speed railroad line between Ankara and Konya was finished on 3 June 2011 and was put into service on 23 August 2011. Several other high speed and normal railroad projects are currently in the planning stage.[3]

Because of works connected with the Marmaray and Istanbul-Ankara high speed line there are currently no rail services linking Istanbul with the rest of Anatolia. The suburban services from Haydarpaşa terminate at Pendik where the train tracks end.

Urban rail

]] After almost 30 years without any trams, Turkey is experiencing a revival in trams. Established in 1992, the tram system of Istanbul earned the best large-scale tram management award in 2005. Another award-winning tram network belongs to Eskişehir, (EsTram) a city with a new tram system opened in 2004. Several other cities are planning or constructing tram lines, usually with modern low-floow trams.

By 2014, there have been 12 cities in Turkey using railroads for transportation.

-   Cities with commuter rail systems: Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir
-   Cities with metro systems: Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Adana, Bursa
-   Cities with light rail transit systems: Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Adana, Bursa, Eskişehir, Konya, Antalya, Kayseri, Gaziantep, Samsun

Road transport

Road transport is responsible for almost a fifth of Turkey's greenhouse gas emissions, mainly via diesel.

Road network

There are two types of intercity roads in Turkey:

- The first is the historical and free road network called State roads (_Devlet Yolları_) that are completely under the responsibility of the General Directorate of Highways except for urban sections (like the sections falling within the inner part of ring roads of Ankara, Istanbul or İzmir. Even if they mostly possess dual carriageways and interchanges, they also have some traffic lights and intersections.

- The second type of roads are controlled-access highways that are officially named _Otoyol_. But it isn't uncommon that people in Turkey call them _Otoban_ (referring to Autobahn) as this types of roads entered popular culture by the means of Turks in Germany. They also depend on the General Directorate of Highways except the newest Otoyol 5 that is financed with a BOT model.

-   Total network: 426,906 km
    -   Paved: 177,550 km (2004)
        -   Motorways: 2,080 km (2010)
        -   Dual carriageways: 16,784 km (2010)[6]
    -   Unpaved: 249,356 km (2004)

As of 2010, there are 155 tunnels (total length 99.5 km) and 6447 bridges (total length 296.3 km) on the network.[7][8]

Public road transport
