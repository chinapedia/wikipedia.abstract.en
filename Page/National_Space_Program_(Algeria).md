Program Alsat

The "Alsat program " is a constellation of Algerian earth observation satellites operated by the Algerian Space Agency. Algeria has three (3) operational units and one (01) retired mission.

Retired missions

Alsat-1 is the first earth observation satellite of Algeria. Its principal mission is monitoring natural resources. It was a Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) satellite that is developed and coordinated by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL).

The satellite is a 60-centimeter cube, and weighs about 92 kilograms. The imaging system covers the green, red, and the near infrared, at a resolution of 32 meters.

It was placed in orbit by a kosmos-3M launch vehicle from the Russian cosmodrome of Plessetsk, on 28 November 2002. Its orbit is heliosynchronous at an altitude of about 700 kilometers with orbital inclination of 98°.

Its first images were received on December 17, 2002 at the reception stations of the Center of space technics (Centre national des techniques spatiales CNTS) at Arzew, Algeria. Alsat-1 completed its mission on 15 August 2010.

The Alcomsat-1 is the ninth telecommunication satellite delivered to the international client by China Aerospace; it is also the first cooperation with Algeria in aerospace industry.

The Alcomsat-1 satellite program is the first communications satellite program of Algeria. It covers the Algerian territory and the surrounding area, will be mainly used in the fields of broadcast, emergency communications, remote education, e-government, enterprise communications, satellite broadband, and satellite based augmentation system application, etc..[20]


Planned missions

Alsat-3 and Alsat-4 are also planned to cover national needs [21]


Notable achievements

The Algerian Space Agency in charge of the National Space Program of Algeria is now capable of:

-   Design and implementation of an earth observation satellite.[22]
-   Assembly, integration, and tests of its satellites at its Center of Development of Satellites (CDS) in Oran.[23]
-   Conducting orbital manoeuvres and tests in orbit of its satellites autonomously (both Alsat-1B and Alsat-2b were handled by ASAL autonomously after their first signals few moments after separation from the launch vehicle).[24]
-   Treatment and analyses of products images obtained by its satellites at its Center of Space Techniques (CST).
