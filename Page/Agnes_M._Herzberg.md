AGNES MARGARET HERZBERG is a Canadian statistician who works as a professor of mathematics and statistics at Queen's University.[1] She was president of the Statistical Society of Canada for 1991–1992,[2] its first female president.[3]

Herzberg did her undergraduate studies at Queen's University before earning master's and doctoral degrees from the University of Saskatchewan,[4] under the supervision of Norman Shklov. She took an Overseas Fellowship in 1966, taking her to England, and remained at Imperial College London until 1988, when she returned to Queen's as a professor.[5]

In 1983 she was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.[6] She is also a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.[7] In 1999 the Statistical Society of Canada gave her their Distinguished Service Award, the first to a woman,[8] and in 2007 the society named her as an Honorary Member "for fundamental contributions to the design of experiments, applied statistics and data analysis; for her organization and leadership of conferences on statistics, science and public policy, and for dedicated service to the international statistical community".[9] Additionally, a conference in her honour was held at Queen's University in 2004.[10]

Beyond her work in statistics, Herzberg has also used graph coloring and chromatic polynomials to analyze the mathematics of Sudoku.[11][12]
