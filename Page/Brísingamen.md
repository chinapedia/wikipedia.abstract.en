In Norse mythology, _BRÍSINGAMEN_ (or _BRÍSINGA MEN_) is the torc or necklace of the goddess Freyja.[1] The name is an Old Norse compound _brísinga-men_ whose second element is _men_ "(ornamental) neck-ring (of precious metal), torc".[2] The etymology of the first element is uncertain. It has been derived from Old Norse _brísingr_, a poetic term for "fire" or "amber" mentioned in the anonymous versified word-lists (_þulur_) appended to many manuscripts of the Prose Edda,[3] making Brísingamen "gleaming torc", "sunny torc", or the like. However, _Brísingr_ can also be an ethnonym, in which case _Brísinga men_ is "torque of the Brísings"; the Old English parallel in _Beowulf_ supports this derivation, though who the Brísings (Old Norse _Brísingar_) may have been remains unknown.[4]


Attestations

_Beowulf_

Brísingamen is referred to in the Anglo-Saxon epic _Beowulf_ as _Brosinga mene_. The brief mention in _Beowulf_ is as follows (trans. by Howell Chickering, 1977): This seems to confuse two different stories as the _Beowulf_ poet is clearly referring to the legends about Theoderic the Great. The _Þiðrekssaga_ tells that the warrior Heime (_Háma_ in Old English) takes sides against Ermanaric ("Eormanric"), king of the Goths, and has to flee his kingdom after robbing him; later in life, Hama enters a monastery and gives them all his stolen treasure. However, this saga makes no mention of the great necklace. Possibly the _Beowulf_ poet was confused, or invented the addition of the necklace to give him an excuse to drag in a mention of Eormanric. In any case, the necklace given to Beowulf in the story is not the Brísingamen itself; it is only being compared to it.

_Poetic Edda_

In the poem _Þrymskviða_ of the _Poetic Edda_, Þrymr, the king of the jǫtnar, steals Thor's hammer, Mjölnir. Freyja lends Loki her falcon cloak to search for it; but upon returning, Loki tells Freyja that Þrymr has hidden the hammer and demanded to marry her in return. Freyja is so wrathful that all the Æsir’s halls beneath her are shaken and the necklace Brísingamen breaks off from her neck. Later Thor borrows Brísingamen when he dresses up as Freyja to go to the wedding at Jǫtunheimr.

This myth is also recorded in an 18th-century Swedish folksong called _Hammar-Hemtningen_ (the taking of the hammer), where Freyja is called Miss Frojenborg, "den väna solen" (the fair sun).[5]

_Prose Edda_

_Húsdrápa_, a skaldic poem partially preserved in the _Prose Edda_, relates the story of the theft of Brísingamen by Loki. One day when Freyja wakes up and finds Brísingamen missing, she enlists the help of Heimdallr to help her search for it. Eventually they find the thief, who turns out to be Loki who has transformed himself into a seal. Heimdallr turns into a seal as well and fights Loki. After a lengthy battle at Singasteinn, Heimdallr wins and returns Brísingamen to Freyja.

Snorri Sturluson quoted this old poem in _Skáldskaparmál_, saying that because of this legend Heimdallr is called "Seeker of Freyja's Necklace" (_Skáldskaparmál_, section 8) and Loki is called "Thief of Brísingamen" (_Skáldskaparmál_, section 16). A similar story appears in the later _Sörla þáttr_, where Heimdallr does not appear.

_Sörla þáttr_

Sörla þáttr is a short story in the later and extended version of the _Saga of Olaf Tryggvason_[6] in the manuscript of the _Flateyjarbók_, which was written and compiled by two Christian priests, Jon Thordson and Magnus Thorhalson, in the late 14th century.[7] In the end of the story, the arrival of Christianity dissolves the old curse that traditionally was to endure until Ragnarök.

The battle of Högni and Heðinn is recorded in several medieval sources, including the skaldic poem _Ragnarsdrápa_, _Skáldskaparmál_ (section 49), and _Gesta Danorum_: king Högni's daughter, Hildr, is kidnapped by king Heðinn. When Högni comes to fight Heðinn on an island, Hildr comes to offer her father a necklace on behalf of Heðinn for peace; but the two kings still battle, and Hildr resurrects the fallen to make them fight until Ragnarök.[8] None of these earlier sources mentions Freyja or king Olaf Tryggvason, the historical figure who Christianized Norway and Iceland in the 10th Century.


Archaeological record

Freyja_in_silver.jpg in Stockholm.]] Völva was buried with considerable splendour in Hagebyhöga in Östergötland. In addition to being buried with her wand, she had received great riches which included horses, a wagon and an Arabian bronze pitcher. There was also a silver pendant, which represents a woman with a broad necklace around her neck. This kind of necklace was only worn by the most prominent women during the Iron Age and some have interpreted it as Freyja's necklace Brísingamen. The pendant may represent Freyja herself.[9]


Modern influence

Alan Garner wrote a children's fantasy novel called _The Weirdstone of Brisingamen_ about an enchanted teardrop bracelet.

Diana Paxson's novel _Brisingamen_ features Freyja and her bracelet.

Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab has a perfumed oil scent named Brisingamen.

Freyja's necklace Brisingamen features prominently in Betsy Tobin's novel _Iceland_, where the necklace is seen to have significant protective powers.

J. R. R. Tolkien's _The Silmarillion_ includes a treasure called the Nauglamír, which was made by the dwarves of Eriador for the elvish king Finrod Felagund. However, the necklace was brought out a dragon's hoard by Túrin Turambar and given to King Thingol of Doriath. This king asks a group of dwarves to set a Silmaril into the necklace for his wife Melian to wear. The dwarves fall under the spell of the Silmaril and they claim the Nauglamir as their own – with the Silmaril attached. They kill Thingol and make off with the necklace. It is eventually recovered and is an heirloom of Thingol's descendants, eventually leading Eärendil to Valinor and resulting in the return of the Valar into the affairs of Middle-earth. This is clearly intended to be the equivalent in his mythology to the Brísingamen.

The Brisingamen feature as a major item in Joel Rosenberg's Keepers of the Hidden Ways series of books. In it, there are seven jewels that were created for the necklace by the Dwarfs and given to the Norse goddess. She in turn eventually split them up into the seven separate jewels and hid them throughout the realm, as together they hold the power to shape the universe by its holder. The book's plot is about discovering one of them and deciding what to do with the power they allow while avoiding Loki and other Norse characters.[10]

In Christopher Paolini's _Inheritance Cycle_, the word "brisingr" means fire. This is probably a distillation of the word _brisinga_.

Ursula Le Guin's short story _Semley's Necklace_, the first part of her novel _Rocannon's World_, is a retelling of the Brisingamen story on an alien planet.

Brisingamen is represented as a card in the _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ Trading Card Game, "Nordic Relic Brisingamen".

Brisingamen was part of MMORPG _Ragnarok Online_ lore, which is ranked as "God item". The game is heavily based from Norse mythology.

In the _Firefly Online_ game, one of the planets of the Himinbjörg system (which features planets named after figures from Germanic mythology) is named Brisingamen. It is third from the star, and has moons named Freya, Beowulf, and Alberich.

The Brisingamen is an item that can be found and equipped in the game _Castlevania: Lament of Innocence_.
