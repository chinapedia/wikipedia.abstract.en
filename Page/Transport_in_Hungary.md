TRANSPORT IN HUNGARY relies on several main modes, including transport by road, rail, air and water.


Roads

Hungary has a total of of public roads, of which are paved (including 1481 km of motorways, as of 2016); and are unpaved (2005 etc.):

Hungarian road categories are as follows:

-   GYORSFORGALMI ÚT (controlled-access highway):
    -   AUTÓPÁLYA (motorway): 2+2 travel lanes and 1+1 emergency lane, central reservation, no at-grade intersections, speed limit
    -   GYORSÚT (high-speed highway): 2+2 travel lanes, central reservation, few at-grade intersections, speed limit
    -   AUTÓÚT (expressway): 2+2, 2+1 or 1+1 travel lanes, central reservation, some at-grade intersections, speed limit
-   ELSŐDRENDŐ FŐÚT (primary arterial road or primary main road) (with one-digit number, e.g. 6-os főút)
-   MÁSODRENDŰ FŐÚT (secondary main road) (with two or three digits, e.g. 57-es főút)
-   HELYI ÚT (local road) (with three or more digits, e.g. 4519-es közút)

Motorways and expressways

Hungarian motorways and expressways are part of the national road network. As of October 2016, there are of controlled-access highways.

Motorways (_autópályák_, singular - _autópálya_) in Hungary:
M1 | M3 | M4 | M5 | M6 | M7 | M8 | _M15_ | M19 | M30 | M31 | M35 | M43 | M60

Expressways (_autóutak_, singular - _autóút_) in Hungary:
M0 | M2 | M9 | M51 | M70 | M85 | M86

New motorway sections are being added to the existing network, which already connects many major economically important cities to the capital.

Bus transport

Bus transport between municipalities was provided by Volán Companies, twenty-four bus companies founded in 1970 and named after the regions they served. They also provided local transport in cities and towns that did not have their own public transport company (all cities except for Budapest, Miskolc, Pécs, Kaposvár and also Debrecen after 2009), and operated bus lines in cities where the local company operated only tram and trolley bus lines (Szeged and Debrecen, the latter until 2009, when DKV took over the bus lines). In early 2015 the 24 companies were organized into seven regional companies.


Railways

_Note:_ Hungary and Austria jointly manage the cross-border standard-gauge railway between Győr–Sopron–Ebenfurt (GySEV/ROeEE), a distance of about 101 km in Hungary and 65 km in Austria.

In Budapest, the three main railway stations are the Eastern (Keleti), Western (Nyugati) and Southern (Déli), with other outlying stations like Kelenföld. Of the three, the Southern is the most modern but the Eastern and the Western are more decorative and architecturally interesting.

Other important railway stations countrywide include Szolnok (the most important railway intersection outside Budapest), Tiszai Railway Station in Miskolc and the stations of Pécs, Győr, Debrecen, Szeged and Székesfehérvár.

The only city with an underground railway system is Budapest with its Metro.

In Budapest there is also a suburban rail service in and around the city, operated under the name HÉV.

A part of this route is the same as where electric trams made their world first run in 1887. Budapest has recently ordered 40 Siemens Combino Supra low floor trams. Trams began carrying the passengers on the 1 July 2006 but during the first weeks there were many technical difficulties.
