Studies that are _IN VIVO_ (Latin for "within the living"; often not italicized in English[1][2][3]) are those in which the effects of various biological entities are tested on whole, living organisms or cells, usually animals, including humans, and plants, as opposed to a tissue extract or dead organism. This is not to be confused with experiments done _in vitro_ ("within the glass"), i.e., in a laboratory environment using test tubes, Petri dishes, etc. Examples of investigations _in vivo_ include: the pathogenesis of disease by comparing the effects of bacterial infection with the effects of purified bacterial toxins; the development of non-antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and new drugs generally; and new surgical procedures. Consequently, animal testing and clinical trials are major elements of _in vivo_ research. _In vivo_ testing is often employed over _in vitro_ because it is better suited for observing the overall effects of an experiment on a living subject. In drug discovery, for example, verification of efficacy _in vivo_ is crucial, because _in vitro_ assays can sometimes yield misleading results with drug candidate molecules that are irrelevant _in vivo_ (e.g., because such molecules cannot reach their site of _in vivo_ action, for example as a result of rapid catabolism in the liver).[4]

The English microbiologist Professor Harry Smith and his colleagues in the mid-1950s found that sterile filtrates of serum from animals infected with _Bacillus anthracis_ were lethal for other animals, whereas extracts of culture fluid from the same organism grown _in vitro_ were not. This discovery of anthrax toxin through the use of _in vivo_ experiments had a major impact on studies of the pathogenesis of infectious disease.

The maxim _in vivo veritas_ ("in a living thing [there is] truth")[5] is used to describe this type of testing and is a play on _in vino veritas_, ("in wine [there is] truth"), a well-known proverb.


_In vivo_ vs. _ex vivo_ research

In microbiology, _in vivo_ is often used to refer to experimentation done in live isolated cells rather than in a whole organism, for example, cultured cells derived from biopsies. In this situation, the more specific term is _ex vivo_. Once cells are disrupted and individual parts are tested or analyzed, this is known as _in vitro_.


Methods of use

According to Christopher Lipinski and Andrew Hopkins, "Whether the aim is to discover drugs or to gain knowledge of biological systems, the nature and properties of a chemical tool cannot be considered independently of the system it is to be tested in. Compounds that bind to isolated recombinant proteins are one thing; chemical tools that can perturb cell function another; and pharmacological agents that can be tolerated by a live organism and perturb its systems are yet another. If it were simple to ascertain the properties required to develop a lead discovered _in vitro_ to one that is active _in vivo_, drug discovery would be as reliable as drug manufacturing."[6] Studies on _In vivo_ behavior, determined the formulations of set specific drugs and their habits in a Biorelevant (or Biological relevance) medium.[7]
