FRANCO MANCA is a sourdough Neapolitan pizza business operating over 40 pizzeria in the UK and Italy. It was founded in 2008 by Giuseppe Mascoli[1] and Bridget Hugo[2]. The first store was opened on Market Row in Brixton Market.[3] Initially sites were in the London area, however the company has now expanded into Italy with a busy Summer pizzeria on the island of Salina, Sicily. The company has also opened restaurants in towns and cities around the UK, including Brighton, Bristol, Bath, Oxford and Cambridge.[4] Since the first site opened they’ve served and promoted slow rising sourdough pizza and properly sourced, small supplier, seasonal ingredients. Franco Manca was named the UK's best Italian Restaurant on Yelp.[5][6] Franco Manca's menu consists of mostly pizza with various meat and vegetarian options. It uses a traditional Neapolitan soft base.[7]


Ownership

In March 2015, Franco Manca was purchased by The Fulham Shore, which also owns ‘The Real Greek".[8] The Fulham Shore is owned and operated by Giuseppe Mascoli, David Page, Nabil Mankarious, and David Sykes.[9] In July 2017 they said that the uncertainty over Brexit was 'already affecting the availability of skilled European restaurant staff’.[10] In July 2018 they stated in the company report that more than 50% of the people who worked in the business held shares in the company.
