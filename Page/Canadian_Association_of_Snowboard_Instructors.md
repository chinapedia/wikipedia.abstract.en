The CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF SNOWBOARD INSTRUCTORS (CASI) is Canada's national professional snowboard teaching organisation. The organisation's headquarters are in Cambridge, Ontario, Canada and it is organised into six regions across Canada.

CASI runs teaching courses and certifies instructors both in Canada and other countries, including Japan, South Korea and Andorra.[1] It offers four levels of instructor certification and an additional freestyle certification.[2] Instructors are evaluated on technical skills and teaching skills.[3]


History

CASI was founded in 1994,[4] three years before the 1997[5] founding of AASI. Consequently, CASI is the oldest snowboard teaching organisation in North America.


Organisation

CASI is organised into six regions: British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba/Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic. There is also a Technical and Evaluation Committee that considers course content and technical principles.[6]


Membership

To become a member of CASI, it is necessary to pass an instructor certification course.[7]
