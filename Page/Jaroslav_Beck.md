Life and career

Early life

Jaroslav was born in the town of Strakonice in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. He was first introduced to music at the age of six when he started to learn how to play a flute.[1] He soon realized that he doesn't enjoy reproducing what someone else already composed as it gave him no freedom and he started to create his own sounds.

At the age of 14 he started flying gliders. A year later, he successfully completed the training and obtained a pilot licence. This turned out to be an important step towards music since it gave him the confidence he needed and it later helped him to make the decision to leave his comfort zone and pursue music full-time. In 2003 he started to study secondary technical school in Strakonice and began to work as DJ at the same time. To follow the family tradition, he entered University of West Bohemia in 2007 and studied at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering until he quit in 2012.

Dj career

A major step in this direction was the legendary techno festival in Roudnice nad Labem with Carl Cox as headliner. He instantly fell in love with electronic music. His first gig was a techno rave in the town of Vimperk in 2007 called “Demolition” where he performed under his own name.

After Vimperk he started touring around clubs and festivals in the Czech Republic. After the “Apokalypsa” show in Brno, he changed his stage name to Jay Beck and he started to lean towards progressive house.

He had the opportunity to perform in the most desired clubs in the Czech Republic alongside both Czech and foreign DJs. He has performed at Summer of Love (Pardubice), Mácháč (Machovo Jezero), Apokalypsa (Brno), Duplex (Prague) and elsewhere. During his DJ career he also produced his own electronic music, mostly Progressive and Electro House and he tried to discover his own style.

Oxford
