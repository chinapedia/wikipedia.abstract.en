FRANKLIN PATRICK HERBERT JR. (October 8, 1920 – February 11, 1986) was an American science fiction author best known for the 1965 novel _Dune_ and its five sequels. Though he became famous for his novels, he also wrote short stories and worked as a newspaper journalist, photographer, book reviewer, ecological consultant, and lecturer.

The _Dune_ saga, set in the distant future, and taking place over millennia, explores complex themes, such as the long-term survival of the human species, human evolution, planetary science and ecology, and the intersection of religion, politics, economics and power in a future where humanity has long since developed interstellar travel and settled many thousands of worlds. _Dune_ is the best-selling science fiction novel of all time,[1] and the whole series is widely considered to be among the classics of the genre.


Biography

Early life

Frank Herbert was born on October 8, 1920, in Tacoma, Washington, to Frank Patrick Herbert Sr. and Eileen (McCarthy) Herbert. Because of a poor home environment, he ran away from home in 1938 to live with an aunt and uncle in Salem, Oregon.[2] He enrolled in high school at Salem High School (now North Salem High School), where he graduated the next year.[3] In 1939 he lied about his age to get his first newspaper job at the _Glendale Star_.[4] Herbert then returned to Salem in 1940 where he worked for the _Oregon Statesman_ newspaper (now _Statesman Journal_) in a variety of positions, including photographer.[5]

He served in the U.S. Navy's Seabees for six months as a photographer during World War II, then he was given a medical discharge. He married Flora Parkinson in San Pedro, California, in 1940. They had a daughter, Penny (b. February 16, 1942), but divorced in 1945.

After the war, Herbert attended the University of Washington, where he met Beverly Ann Stuart at a creative writing class in 1946. They were the only students who had sold any work for publication; Herbert had sold two pulp adventure stories to magazines, the first to _Esquire_ in 1945, and Stuart had sold a story to _Modern Romance_ magazine. They married in Seattle, Washington on June 20, 1946, and had two sons, Brian Patrick Herbert (b. June 29, 1947, Seattle, Washington) and Bruce Calvin Herbert (b. June 26, 1951, Santa Rosa, California d. June 15, 1993, San Rafael, California, a professional photographer and gay rights activist.[6])

In 1949 Herbert and his wife moved to California to work on the Santa Rosa _Press-Democrat_. Here they befriended the psychologists Ralph and Irene Slattery. The Slatterys introduced Herbert to the work of several thinkers who would influence his writing, including Freud, Jung, Jaspers and Heidegger; they also familiarized Herbert with Zen Buddhism.[7]

Herbert did not graduate from the university; according to his son Brian, he wanted to study only what interested him and so did not complete the required curriculum. He returned to journalism and worked at the _Seattle Star_ and the _Oregon Statesman_. He was a writer and editor for the _San Francisco Examiner's_ California Living magazine for a decade.

In a 1973 interview, Herbert stated that he had been reading science fiction "about ten years" before he began writing in the genre, and he listed his favorite authors as H. G. Wells, Robert A. Heinlein, Poul Anderson and Jack Vance."Well, I did read some Heinlein. I shouldn't really tie it down to ten years because I had read H. G. Wells. I'd read Vance, Jack Vance, and I became acquainted with Jack Vance about that time ... I read Poul Anderson."

with Frank Herbert, by Paul Turner. October 1973 Volume 1, Issue 4.

Herbert's first science fiction story, "Looking for Something", was published in the April 1952 issue of _Startling Stories_, then a monthly edited by Samuel Mines. Three more of his stories appeared in 1954 issues of _Astounding Science Fiction_ and _Amazing Stories_.[8] His career as a novelist began in 1955 with the serial publication of _Under Pressure_ in _Astounding_ from November 1955; afterward it was issued as a book by Doubleday, _The Dragon in the Sea_.[9] The story explored sanity and madness in the environment of a 21st-century submarine and predicted worldwide conflicts over oil consumption and production.[10] It was a critical success but not a major commercial one. During this time Herbert also worked as a speechwriter for Republican senator Guy Cordon.[11]

_Dune_

USA_Oregon_Dunes.jpg, near Florence, Oregon, served as an inspiration for the _Dune_ saga.]] Herbert began researching _Dune_ in 1959. He was able to devote himself wholeheartedly to his writing career because his wife returned to work full-time as an advertising writer for department stores, becoming the breadwinner during the 1960s. He later told Willis E. McNelly that the novel originated when he was supposed to do a magazine article on sand dunes in the Oregon Dunes near Florence, Oregon. He became too involved and ended up with far more raw material than needed for an article. The article was never written, but instead planted the seed that led to _Dune_.

_Dune_ took six years of research and writing to complete and it was much longer than commercial science fiction of the time was supposed to be. _Analog_ (the renamed _Astounding_, still edited by John W. Campbell) published it in two parts comprising eight installments, "Dune World" from December 1963 and "Prophet of Dune" in 1965.[12] It was then rejected by nearly twenty book publishers. One editor prophetically wrote, "I might be making the mistake of the decade, but ...".[13]

Sterling E. Lanier, an editor of Chilton Book Company (known mainly for its auto-repair manuals) had read the Dune serials and offered a $7,500 advance plus future royalties for the rights to publish them as a hardcover book.[14] Herbert rewrote much of his text.[15] _Dune_ was soon a critical success.[16] It won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1965 and shared the Hugo Award in 1966 with _...And Call Me Conrad_ by Roger Zelazny.[17] _Dune_ was the first major ecological science fiction novel, embracing a multitude of sweeping, interrelated themes and multiple character viewpoints, a method that ran through all Herbert's mature work.

_Dune_ was not an immediate bestseller. By 1968 Herbert had made $20,000 from it, far more than most science fiction novels of the time were generating, but not enough to let him take up full-time writing. However, the publication of _Dune_ did open doors for him. He was the _Seattle Post-Intelligencer's_ education writer from 1969 to 1972 and lecturer in general studies and interdisciplinary studies at the University of Washington (1970–1972). He worked in Vietnam and Pakistan as a social and ecological consultant in 1972. In 1973 he was director-photographer of the television show _The Tillers_.[18]

By the end of 1972, Herbert had retired from newspaper writing and become a full-time fiction writer. During the 1970s and 1980s, Herbert enjoyed considerable commercial success as an author. He divided his time between homes in Hawaii and Washington's Olympic Peninsula; his home in Port Townsend on the peninsula was intended to be an "ecological demonstration project".[19] During this time he wrote numerous books and pushed ecological and philosophical ideas. He continued his _Dune_ saga, following it with _Dune Messiah_, _Children of Dune_, and _God Emperor of Dune_. Other highlights were _The Dosadi Experiment_, _The Godmakers_, _The White Plague_ and the books he wrote in partnership with Bill Ransom: _The Jesus Incident_, _The Lazarus Effect_, and _The Ascension Factor_ which were sequels to _Destination: Void_. He also helped launch the career of Terry Brooks with a very positive review of Brooks' first novel, _The Sword of Shannara_, in 1977.[20]

Success, family changes, and death

Herbert's change in fortune was shadowed by tragedy. In 1974, Beverly underwent an operation for cancer. She lived ten more years, but her health was adversely affected by the surgery.[21] During this period, Herbert was the featured speaker at the Octocon II science fiction convention held at the El Rancho Tropicana in Santa Rosa, California, in October 1978. In 1979, he met anthropologist James Funaro with whom he conceived the Contact Conference. Beverly Herbert died on February 7, 1984, the same year that _Heretics of Dune_ was published; in his afterword to 1985's _Chapterhouse: Dune_, Frank Herbert wrote a eulogy for her.

In 1983, British heavy metal band Iron Maiden requested permission from Herbert's publisher to name a song on their album _Piece of Mind_ after _Dune_, but were told that the author had a strong distaste for their style of music. They instead titled the song "To Tame a Land".

1984 was a tumultuous year in Herbert's life. During this same year of his wife's death, his career took off with the release of David Lynch's film version of _Dune_. Despite high expectations, a big-budget production design and an A-list cast, the movie drew mostly poor reviews in the United States. However, despite a disappointing response in the US, the film was a critical and commercial success in Europe and Japan.[22]

After Beverly's death, Herbert married Theresa Shackleford in 1985, the year he published _Chapterhouse: Dune_, which tied up many of the saga's story threads. This would be Herbert's final single work (the collection _Eye_ was published that year, and _Man of Two Worlds_ was published in 1986). He died of a massive pulmonary embolism while recovering from surgery for pancreatic cancer on February 11, 1986, in Madison, Wisconsin, age 65.

Criticism of government

Herbert was a strong critic of the Soviet Union. He was a distant relative of the controversial Republican senator, Joseph McCarthy, whom he referred to as "Cousin Joe." Herbert was appalled to learn of McCarthy's blacklisting of suspected Communists from working in certain careers and believed that he was endangering essential freedoms of citizens of the United States.[23] Herbert believed that governments lie to protect themselves and that, following the infamous Watergate scandal, President Richard Nixon had unwittingly taught an important lesson in not trusting government.[24] Herbert also opposed American involvement in the US war in Vietnam. [25]

In _Chapterhouse: Dune_, he wrote:


Ideas and themes

Frank Herbert used his science fiction novels to explore complex[26] ideas involving philosophy, religion, psychology, politics and ecology. The underlying thrust of his work was a fascination with the question of human survival and evolution. Herbert has attracted a sometimes fanatical fan base, many of whom have tried to read everything he wrote, fiction or non-fiction, and see Herbert as something of an authority on the subject matters of his books. Indeed, such was the devotion of some of his readers that Herbert was at times asked if he was founding a cult,[27] something he was very much against.

There are a number of key themes in Herbert's work:

-   A concern with leadership. He explored the human tendency to slavishly follow charismatic leaders. He delved into both the flaws and potentials of bureaucracy and government.[28]
-   Herbert was the first science fiction author to popularize ideas about ecologyMcNeilly, Willis E.

"Herbert, Frank (Patrick)" in Gunn, James. _The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction_. London, Viking, 1988. (pp. 222–24) . "Herbert felt strongly about many causes, particularly ecology ..." and systems thinking. He stressed the need for humans to think both systematically and long-term.[29]

-   The relationship between religion, politics and power."Frank Herbert's true stroke of

genius consisted ... in inviting a way of thinking about humanity, history, religion, and politics as complex and interdependent as ecosystems themselves". Jeffery Nicholas, _Dune and Philosophy:Weirding Way of Mentat_. Open Court Publishing, 2011 , (p.149).

-   Human survival and evolution: Herbert writes of the Fremen, the Sardaukar, and the Dosadi, who are molded by their terrible living conditions into dangerous super races.
-   Human possibilities and potential: Herbert offered Mentats, the Bene Gesserit and the Bene Tleilax as different visions of human potential.
-   The nature of sanity and madness. Frank Herbert was interested in the work of Thomas Szasz and the anti-psychiatry movement. Often, Herbert poses the question, "_What is sane?_", and while there are clearly insane behaviors and psychopathies as evinced by characters (Piter De Vries for instance), it is often suggested that normal and abnormal are relative terms which humans are sometimes ill-equipped to apply to one another, especially on the basis of statistical regularity.[30]
-   The possible effects and consequences of consciousness-altering chemicals, such as the spice in the _Dune_ saga, as well as the "Jaspers" fungus in _The Santaroga Barrier_, and the Kelp in the Destination: Void sequence.[31]
-   How language shapes thought. More specifically, Herbert was influenced by Alfred Korzybski's _General Semantics_.O'Reilly, Tim. _Frank Herbert_. New York, NY: Frederick Ungar Publishing Co., Inc. ,1981. (pp.59–60) .

"Much of the Bene Gesserit technology of consciousness is based on the insights of general semantics, a philosophy and training method developed in the 1930s by Alfred Korzybski. Herbert had studied general semantics in San Francisco at about the time he was writing _Dune_. (At one point, he worked as a ghostwriter for a nationally syndicated column by S. I. Hayakawa, one of the foremost proponents of general semantics.)" Algis Budrys wrote that his knowledge of language and linguistics "is worth at least one Ph.D. and the Chair of Philology at a good New England college".[32]

-   Sociobiology. How our instincts unconsciously influence our behavior and society.
-   Learning, teaching, and thinking.[33]

Frank Herbert refrained from offering his readers formulaic answers to many of the questions he explored.[34]


Status and influence on science fiction

_Dune_ and the _Dune_ saga constitute one of the world's best-selling science fiction series and novels; _Dune_ in particular has received widespread critical acclaim, winning the Nebula Award in 1965 and sharing the Hugo Award in 1966, and is frequently considered one of the best science fiction novels ever, if not the best.[35] _Locus_ subscribers voted it the all-time best SF novel in 1975, again in 1987, and the best "before 1990" in 1998.[36]

_Dune_ is considered a landmark novel for a number of reasons:

-   _Dune_ is a landmark of soft science fiction. Herbert deliberately suppressed technology in his _Dune_ universe so he could address the future of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's technology. _Dune_ considers the way humans and their institutions might change over time.[37][38]
-   _Dune_ was the first major ecological science fiction novel. Frank Herbert was a great popularizer of scientific ideas; many of his fans credit Frank Herbert for introducing them to philosophy and psychology. In _Dune_ he helped popularize the term _ecology_ and some of the field's concepts, vividly imparting a sense of planetary awareness. Gerald Jonas explains in _The New York Times Book Review_: "So completely did Mr. Herbert work out the interactions of man and beast and geography and climate that _Dune_ became the standard for a new subgenre of 'ecological' science fiction." As popularity of _Dune_ rose, Herbert embarked on a lecture tour of college campuses, explaining how the environmental concerns of Dune's inhabitants were analogous to our own.
-   _Dune_ is considered an epic example of literary world-building. _The Library Journal_ reports that "_Dune_ is to science fiction what _The Lord of the Rings_ is to fantasy". Arthur C. Clarke is quoted as making a similar statement on the back cover of a paper edition of _Dune_.[39] Frank Herbert imagined every facet of his creation. He lovingly included glossaries, quotes, documents, and histories, to bring his universe alive to his readers. No science fiction novel before it had so vividly realized life on another world.[40]

Herbert never again equalled the critical acclaim he received for _Dune_. Neither his sequels to _Dune_ nor any of his other books won a Hugo or Nebula Award, although almost all of them were _New York Times_ Best Sellers.[41]

Malcolm Edwards in the _Encyclopedia of Science Fiction_ wrote:

  Much of Herbert's work makes difficult reading. His ideas were genuinely developed concepts, not merely decorative notions, but they were sometimes embodied in excessively complicated plots and articulated in prose which did not always match the level of thinking [...] His best novels, however, were the work of a speculative intellect with few rivals in modern science fiction.[42]

The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Herbert in 2006.[43][44][45]

California State University, Fullerton's Pollack Library has several of Herbert's draft manuscripts of _Dune_ and other works, with the author's notes, in their Frank Herbert Archives.[46]

The City of Tacoma built Dune Peninsula and the Frank Herbert Trail at Point Defiance Park in July 2019 to honor the hometown writer.[47]


Bibliography

Posthumously published works

Beginning in 2012, Herbert's estate and WordFire Press have released four previously unpublished novels in e-book and paperback formats: _High-Opp_ (2012),[48] _Angels' Fall_ (2013),[49] _A Game of Authors_ (2013),[50] and _A Thorn in the Bush_ (2014).[51]

In recent years, Frank Herbert's son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson have added to the _Dune_ franchise, using notes left behind by Frank Herbert and discovered over a decade after his death. Brian Herbert and Anderson have written two prequel trilogies (_Prelude to Dune_ and _Legends of Dune_) exploring the history of the _Dune_ universe before the events within _Dune_, as well as two post-_Chapterhouse Dune_ novels that complete the original series (_Hunters of Dune_ and _Sandworms of Dune_) based on Frank Herbert's own _Dune 7_ outline.
