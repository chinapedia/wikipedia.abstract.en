District 7

The 7th congressional district is located in eastern Massachusetts. It contains the northern three-quarters of the city of Boston, the city of Somerville and parts of the city of Cambridge. The district has a PVI of D+34. The incumbent was Democrat Mike Capuano, who has represented the district since 2013 and previously represented the 8th district from 1999 to 2013. He was re-elected unopposed with 99% of the vote in 2016.

In his bid for re-nomination by the Democratic Party, Capuano was defeated by Boston city councillor Ayanna Pressley.[60] The primary victory was a surprise,[61] as the last poll before the election showed Capuano with a significant lead, 48% to 35%.[62] Part of the reason the polls may have been inaccurate is a surge in the number of primary voters. 24% of District 7 voters in the 2018 primary had not voted in the five previous primaries, and that percentage was disproportionately of Hispanic and Asian ethnicities.[63]
