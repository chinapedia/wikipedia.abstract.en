MERRY JANE (stylized MERRY JANE) is a cannabis-focused digital media platform launched by rapper Snoop Dogg in 2015, with media entrepreneur Ted Chung.[1] The site features editorial content on the business and politics of the cannabis industry, original video series as well as a database for identifying cannabis strains and dispensaries.[2]


History

Merry Jane is backed by Snoop Dogg's own capital venture firm Casa Verde Capital which has a history of investing in marijuana-based enterprise such as medical marijuana delivery service Eaze.[3] Prior to launch, Snoop and co-founder Ted Chung curated marijuana dispensaries to appear on the platform, which now functions as a searchable database.[4] Merry Jane launched on September 21, 2015 in invite-only beta, but is now a public platform.[5]

Launch

Snoop Dogg launched Merry Jane at TechCrunch's 2015 Disrupt Conference held in San Francisco, alongside co-founder Ted Chung.[6] Snoop was quoted as saying, "After watching where the cannabis industry is headed, I wanted to create a platform that will take this movement further." He also suggested that Merry Jane was there to normalize the conversation around marijuana: “There are so many people in the closet. We are giving them an opportunity to come out of the closet and just admit they like to smoke."[7]

Headlines

In January 2018, to celebrate the passage of Proposition 64, Merry Jane teamed up with Jack in the Box to promote the "Merry Munchie Meal" which included multiple fast food items for $4.20, a symbolic number in the marijuana community.[8]


Activism

Merry Jane and its founders take an active stance on the legalization of marijuana in the United States.

Merry Jane Wellness Retreat

Alongside Revolt, Merry Jane hosts an annual weed wellness retreat in Colorado, one of the most accepting marijuana states in the United States.[12] The hip-hop music festival occurs around 4/20 in multiple cities and aims to celebrate the legalization of cannabis and raise awareness of its potential benefits.[13] The 2018 420 Wellness Retreat Tour was promoted four concerts across two days, Denver and Las Vegas on 4/20 and then Seattle and Eugene on 4/21.[14]

The series has featured celebrities such as Rick Ross, MixedByAli and gained particular notoriety for an interview with former NFL lineman Eben Britton who used the platform to challenge the stigma the drug faces within the NFL. “The health risks linked to pharmaceutical drugs are well documented and players should have the option to choose a natural alternative for pain management,” he said. “It’s time to consider cannabis a legitimate medicine and remove the negative stigma.”[35]
