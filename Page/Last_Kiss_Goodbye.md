_LAST KISS GOODBYE_ is the second studio solo album by guitarist Brian Tarquin, released in October 1997 with a new label Instinct records. Going in a more modern direction, Tarquin moved towards the more funky street grooves. Instinct sent him to London to record with Ernie McKone, bass player from the UK Acid Jazz band Galliano. This was the break through album for Tarquin, featuring the R&R/Gavin radio hit _One Arabian Knight_ that charted #4 on the NAC/Smooth Jazz radio charts and the Jeff Beck remake Freeway Jam. The album has become a favorite at Smooth Jazz and still receives a generous amount of airplay today on Pandora Radio and Sirius radio.


Critical reception

_Last Kiss Goodbye_ received favorable reviews as JazzTimes wrote _"Tarquin's delivery, though detailed, remains melodic and never ventures into the abstract. Although his acid jazz is a gentler breed of fusion, Tarquin plays with a fleet-fingered, smooth style, which floats across freewheeling pieces…"_ '' and Jazziz magazine'' wrote _"Cosmopolitan flair is reminiscent of guitarist Lee Ritenour, with a tincture of Steely Dan."_
