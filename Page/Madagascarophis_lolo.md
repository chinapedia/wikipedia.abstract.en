_MADAGASCAROPHIS LOLO_ is a species of snakes endemic to Madagascar.[1][2] It is colloquially referred to as GHOST SNAKE.[3][4] It was found in a lime rock formation.[5][6]


Description

ColuberScales.png _Madagascarophis lolo_ can be identified from other species in its genus by its gray, overall body color with black vertebral stripe and dorsal, alternating lighter gray splotches. It has 25 midbody scale rows, 189 ventral scales and 56 divided subcaudal scales. With the exception of _M. fuchsi_, it differs from all other _Madagascarophis_ species by having extended contact of posterior infralabial scales. _M. lolo_ can be distinguished from _M. fuchsi_ by its slightly lower number of infralabial scales, with _M. lolo_ having around 10 infralabial scales to the approximately 12â€“13 infralabial scales of _M. fuchsi_.[7][8]


Behavior

Alike other species of _Madagascarophis_, _M. lolo_ is nocturnal.[9]


Habitat

Ankarana_Reserve_tsingy_at_sunset_Madagascar.jpg karst in Ankarana National Park, the park in which, _Madagascophis lolo_ was first sighted and documented.]] Their habitat is variable, as they are terrestrial and semi-arboreal, but mainly are found on karst rock formations. Researchers propose that the rarity of _M. lolo_ sightings could be due to their rough terrain habitat, as the karst rock formations are difficult to navigate, especially in the night, when _M. lolo_ would be active.[10]


Distribution

_Madagascarophis lolo_ is probably endemic to karst areas of Analamerana and Ankarana of Madagascar.[11]


Etymology

_Madagascarophis lolo_ gets its specific name _lolo_ from the Malagasy word for "ghost". There are two reasons for this name, namely, the pale gray color of the ghost snake, and the elusiveness of the species relative to other species in an area of Ankarana that is relatively well explored.[12]
