Structure

The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges refers to verses 1-11 as the prologue (to Deutero-Isaiah).[2]


Verse 2

In the Septuagint this passage is addressed to the priests.[3]


Verse 3

    _The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God._[4]

This verse is cited in all four gospels in New Testament as fulfilled in the person of John the Baptist, who prepared for the coming of Jesus Christ the Lord (Matthew 3:1-3; ; ;). John himself confessed that the verse pertains to him:

    ''He [John the Baptist] said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.[5]

Some English translations associate the reference to "the wilderness" with "the voice which cries out": examples include the King James Version and New King James Version, the Geneva Bible, Wycliffe's translation, the Darby Bible and Brenton's translation of the Septuagint. In more recent translations, "the wilderness" is associated with the place where the way of the Lord is to be prepared: examples include the ASV, Common English Bible, Contemporary English Version, English Standard Version, Jerusalem Bible, Revised Standard Version and New Revised Standard Version:

    ''A voice cries:

        _“In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord_.[6]


Verse 4

    _Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:_[7]

    ''And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,

        _and all flesh shall see it together:_

    _for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it._[8]

Verse 13

    _Who has directed the Spirit of the Lord,_

        _Or as His counselor has taught Him?_[9]

Verse 22

    _It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth,_

        _and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers;_

    _that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain,_

        _and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in._[10]

Westermann notes the similarity of parts of this verse to other Bible verses: verse 22a vs. b and verse 22b vs. b. This verse contains several rare words such as , _doq_ ("curtain"), and , _mathach_ ("spread, stretch"), which are only found here, as well as , _chug_ ("circle"), which are only found in a few other verses (; ; ) suggesting "well-defined, distinctive traditions."

-   "Circle" (of the earth): is translated from the Hebrew word , , which also denotes "horizon, circuit, vault of the heavens." It can refer to
    -   the full circuit the seen and unseen halves of the stars across the dome of the sky, or
    -   the vault of heaven () extending "in a half-circle from horizon to horizon", or
    -   a circular observable horizon (cf. ; )

    It is to emphasize the range of God’s authority "over everything the eye can see in every direction, even to the distant ends of the earth," but not necessarily refer to the "circular nature of the earth."
    Rashi mentions an expression with the same root in "and with a compass (וּבַמְּחוּגָה)" to view this word as a "circle" (as made by a compass).[11] Douay–Rheims Bible renders it as "globe"[12] and so does the Spanish version of the Jubilee Bible (_el globo_,[13] but the English version renders as "circle"[14]).


Uses

Modern literature

A part of the Hebrew text of Isaiah 40:4 was used by Shmuel Yosef Agnon as the title for his 1912-novella, "Vehaya Ha'akov Lemishor" ("The Crooked Shall Be Made Straight").[15]
