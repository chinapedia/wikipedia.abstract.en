The TURKMEN BRIGADES are Iraqi Turkmen militias as part of the Popular Mobilization Forces formed in 2014.

The group's commander, Said Yilmaz Najar, rejected proposals of an unified Turkmen militia from the Iraqi Turkmen Front, saying that his group has both Shia and Sunni Turkmen.[1]

On 25 September 2016, 16th Brigade has announced that the militias will participate the Hawija Offensive.[2]
