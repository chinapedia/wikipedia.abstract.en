The LAU KING HOWE HOSPITAL MEMORIAL MUSEUM () is a medical museum in Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia. The museum is the first and only medical museum in Malaysia. [1]


History

Lau King Howe Hospital was originally built in 1936 by Mr.Lau King Howe as the only hospital in Sibu. After the Sibu Hospital was opened on 1 September 1994, Lau's hospital began to attract less and less patients.[2] Eventually, the hospital buildings were demolished in 1994 and the site converted into a commercial lot. [3] A small museum named after the hospital at a cost of MYR450,000 was built near the original “entrance” to the hospital.. It was officially opened on 3 August 1996.[4]


Opening time

The museum opens everyday except Mondays from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.[5]
