Description

Cap

The cap is typically around 24 – 102 mm (2.4 - 10.2 cm) wide, is hemispheric at first then becoming broadly convex to plano-convex, occasionally also slightly depressed in center; white, pallid grayish-brown or grayish buff over disk in age, surface dull and tacky at first and becoming shiny.

Gills

The gills are usually narrowlyadnate, sometimes with a decurrent line, close, whitish, becoming grayish-cream on drying, with white, floccose remnants of partial veil on edges, narrow, 4.5 – 11 mm (0.45 - 1.1 cm) broad, sometimes anastomosing; the short gills are truncate to rounded truncate to attenuate to attenuate in steps, plentiful, of diverse lengths, unevenly distributed.

Stem

The stem is 25 - 142 (2.5 - 14.2 cm) × 5 – 20 mm (0.5 – 2 cm), white, and tapers upward slightly to a flaring apex. The stem is decorated with easily removed, floccose material especially in upper portion; the flesh of the stem usually does not take on a color when bruised. The flesh is white, occasionally graying in damaged areas, with a firmly stuffed central cylinder, up to 7 mm wide. The ring is fibrous-floccose and rapidly evanescent. Volval remnants are absent from the bulb and the stem base or difficult to distinguish.[1]
