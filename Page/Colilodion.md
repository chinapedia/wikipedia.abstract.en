_COLILODION_, sole member of the tribe COLILODIONINI, is a genus of beetles belonging to the family Staphylinidae and comprising eight species from Southeast Asia.


Ecology

Species of the genus _Colilodion_ are presumed to be myrmecophiles due to the presence of trichomes retaining ant pheromones.[1]


Systematics

The exact systematic placement of the genus remains uncertain; it is the only member of the Colilodionini tribe, sharing certain characteristics with Clavigeritae, where it was originally placed by Claude Besuchet in 1991, and others that resemble the Pselaphitae.[2][3] Eight species have been described:[4]

-   _Colilodion concinnus_ Besuchet, 1991
-   _Colilodion incredibilis_ Besuchet, 1991
-   _Colilodion inopinatus_ Besuchet, 1991
-   _Colilodion mirus_ Besuchet, 1991
-   _Colilodion schulzi_ Yin & Cuccodoro, 2016
-   _Colilodion tetramerus_ Löbl, 1998
-   _Colilodion thienmu_ Nomura & Sugaya, 2007
-   _Colilodion wuesti_ Löbl, 1994
