Notes

-   Listed are the physical capacities, not the operational capacities. Most facilities may presumably never house a greater number of offenders than their established operational capacities. However, since it is possible, and because operational capacities are much more likely to change than vice versa, physical capacities may be more useful numbers for comparison purposes.
-   The Georgia Department of Corrections only houses juveniles sentenced as adults. All others are housed in facilities operated by the Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice.
