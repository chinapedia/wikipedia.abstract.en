An ADVENTURE is an exciting experience that is typically a bold, sometimes risky, undertaking.[1] Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting or participating in extreme sports.


Motivation

Adventurous experiences create psychological arousal,[2] which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. fear) or positive (e.g. flow). For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer André Malraux, in his _La Condition Humaine_ (1933), "If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?". Similarly, Helen Keller stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."[3]

Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement: examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the British adventurer Jason Lewis, for example, uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. Adventure education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning.

Author Jon Levy suggests that an experience should meet several criteria to be considered an adventure:[4]

1.  Be remarkable—that is, worth talking about
2.  Involve adversity and/or perceived risk
3.  Bring about personal growth


Mythology and fiction

Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as Homer's _The Odyssey_.[5][6][7]

The knight errant was the form the "adventure seeker" character took in the late Middle Ages.

The adventure novel exhibits these "protagonist on adventurous journey" characteristics as do many popular feature films, such as _Star Wars_[8] and _Raiders of the Lost Ark_.[9]

's _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ is a well-known example of a fantasized adventure story.]]

Outdoors

Adventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the wilderness or Mother Nature. Examples include books such as _Hatchet_ or _My Side of the Mountain_. These books are less about "questing", such as in mythology or other adventure novels, but more about surviving on their own, living off the land, gaining new experiences, and becoming closer to the natural world.

Questing

Many adventures are based on the idea of a quest: the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward, whether it be a skill, prize, or perhaps the safety of a person. On the way, the hero must overcome various obstacles. Mythologist Joseph Campbell discussed his notion of the monomyth in his book, _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_. Campbell proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the "call to adventure", followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph.

Video games

In video-game culture an ADVENTURE GAME is a video game in which the player assumes the role of a protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and puzzle-solving.^([1]) The genre's focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other narrative-based media, literatureand film, encompassing a wide variety of literary genres. Many adventure games (text and graphic) are designed for a single player, since this emphasis on story and character makes multi-player design difficult.^([2]) _Colossal Cave Adventure_ is identified^([_by\ whom?_]) as the first such adventure game, first released in 1976, while other notable adventure game series include _Zork_, _King's Quest_, _The Secret of Monkey Island_, and _Myst_.

Initial adventure games developed in the 1970s and early 1980s were text-based, using text parsers to translate the player's input into commands. As personal computers became more powerful with better graphics, the graphic adventure-game format became popular, initially by augmenting player's text commands with graphics, but soon moving towards point-and-click interfaces. Further computer advances led to adventure games with more immersive graphics using real-time or pre-rendered three-dimensional scenes or full-motion video taken from the first- or third-person perspective.

For markets in the Western hemisphere, the genre's popularity peaked during the late 1980s to mid-1990s when many^([_quantify_]) considered it to be among the most technically advanced genres, but it had become a niche genre in the early 2000s due to the popularity of first-person shooters, and it became difficult for developers to find publishers to support adventure-game ventures. Since then, a resurgence in the genre has occurred, spurred on by the success of independent video-game development, particularly from crowdfunding efforts, from the wide availability of digital distribution enabling episodic approaches, and from the proliferation of new gaming platforms, including portable consoles and mobile devices. _The Walking Dead_ is considered^([_by\ whom?_])to be a key title which rejuvenated the genre.

Within Asian markets, adventure games continue to be popular in the form of visual novels, which make up nearly 70% of PC games released in Japan.^([3]) Asian countries have also found markets for adventure games for portable and mobile gaming devices. Japanese adventure-games tend to be distinct^([_clarification\ needed_]) from Western adventure-games and have their own separate development history Many video games are adventure games In video-game culture an adventure game is a video game in which the player assumes the role of a protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and puzzle-solving.[1] The genre's focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other narrative-based media, literature and film, encompassing a wide variety of literary genres.

Nonfiction works

From ancient times, travelers and explorers have written about their adventures. Journals which became best-sellers in their day were written, such as Marco Polo's journal _The Travels of Marco Polo_ or Mark Twain's _Roughing It_. Others were personal journals, only later published, such as the journals of Lewis and Clark or Captain James Cook's journals. There are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question, such as _The Right Stuff_ by Tom Wolfe, or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal, such as _Conquistadors of the Useless_ by Lionel Terray. Documentaries often use the theme of adventure as well.


Adventure sports

There are many sports classified as adventure sports, due to their inherent danger and excitement. Some of these include mountain climbing, skydiving, or other extreme sports.
