ST. BRIDGET OF FIESOLE is an Irish Saint whose festival is celebrated in Italy on February 1.


Life

Born in Ireland to noble parents, she was sister to Saint Andrew of Fiesole, Tuscany and arrived there with him in the 9th century. She is said to have died after living a secluded life in the Appeninnes.[1][2]

The saint Donatus mentions Saint Bridget in his foreword to _A Life_. He was bishop of Fiesole in 824. He spread the stories of St Bridget of Kildare[3] He taught St Andrew and Bridget before travelling to Italy, Donatus became the bishop there while Andrew worked as the archdeacon. The story tells that Bridget was flown to Italy by angels when her brother was dying.[4][5] Because of his veneration of St Bridget, there may be some confusion between the two saints and it is possible that St Bridget of Fiesole is an invention. Donatus talks about St Bridget of Kildare being flown by angels to his deathbed in Italy also.[6]
