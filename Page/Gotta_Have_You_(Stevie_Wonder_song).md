Content and reception

James E. Perone wrote in _The Sound of Stevie Wonder: His Words and Music_ that "it anticipates the regularly 6-minutes-plus songs of his next album, _Conversation Peace_" and that it "is not one of Wonder's best-remembered compositions and recordings, but it does feature a fine funky, blues-infused lead vocal melody in the verses".[1]

In a review of the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote that "While the keyboard funk of 'Chemical Love,' 'Gotta Have You,' and 'Queen in the Black' doesn't sound new, it does sound alive, which is better than Wonder has sounded in years."[2] A review in _Musician_ was less favorable, calling it "generic, repetitive 70s-style funk".[3]
