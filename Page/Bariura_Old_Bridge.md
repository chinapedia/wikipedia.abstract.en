History

Isa Khan established his first temporary capital in Sarail. It was a part of _Samatata janapada_ () of the ancient Bengal.[3] Bariura Bridge founded by Dewan Shahbaj Khan at the time of his Dewani in 1650.[4] This bridge built over the canal mainly for elephant pass and it was well known as "Elephant's Bridge". The Dewans used to communicate by the elephant in this road and also took rest near this bridge.

Bariura Old Bridge deserted for long time and covered by the bushes. Presently, the canal flow changed by Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) on the south to save the bridge by founding a modern bridge near the spot.
