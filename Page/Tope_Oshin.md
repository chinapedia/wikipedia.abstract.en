She studied economics at the University of Ilorin, Kwara State, but left the course to study Public Administration, and then Theatre Arts, TV & FIlm Production at Lagos State University.[3] She became more interested in filmmaking and later studied Film Production, and Cinematography at Colorado Film School of the Community College of Aurora, Denver,[4] and Met Film School, Ealing Studios, London respectively. Tope is also an alumnus of 'Talents Durban' [5] and Berlinale Talents,[6][7] a networking summit of select outstanding creatives from the world of film and drama series across the globe.
