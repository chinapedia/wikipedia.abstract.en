ST. LOUIS COLLEGE (Portuguese: _Colégio São Luís_), is a Brazilian Catholic school located in the city of São Paulo. It was founded by the Jesuits in 1867. The school has classes from kindergarten through high school.


History

St. Louis College was the second college founded in Brazil by the Society of Jesus after the society's suppression. Jesuit priests founded the school in Itu, São Paulo state, in 1867. In 1917, it was moved to the city of São Paulo.

In 1943, the school opened a night school at the secondary level, accommodating 500 students from public schools, many of whom required financial aid.[1] In 1948, one of the first economics schools in the city was opened, then moved to the Jesuit Centro Universitário da FEI.

In 1972, the school began receiving girls, a novelty among São Paulo schools at the time.[2]

The late 1990s saw the construction of Saint Aloysius Gonzaga Church next to the school,[3] along with more classrooms and the extension of classes to kindergarten.
