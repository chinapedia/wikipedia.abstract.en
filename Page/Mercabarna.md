MERCABARNA is a food-trading estate that concentrates wholesale markets (fruit and vegetables, fish and flowers) and Barcelona's abattoir, as well as a large area of complementary activities (ZAC), boasting some 450 fresh-food preparation, commercial, distribution, importing and exporting businesses. A total of 700 businesses are located within its 90-hectare site. It supplies over ten million people and is a benchmark market worldwide.[1]

Mercabarna, as public limited company, was founded in 1967 in Barcelona.

In the past, wholesale food markets were situated in central locations within the city of Barcelona and occupied buildings which are now used for important social, cultural and leisure facilities. The growth of the city and of its population led to problems of all kinds for these central markets in terms of capacity, communications, the environment and so forth. Gradually, therefore, they relocated to the Mercabarna precinct.
