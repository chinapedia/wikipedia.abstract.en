2016–17 season

At the beginning of the season, Doggett earned a rookie contract with the Queensland Bulls, becoming just the second Indigenous Australian to have a contract with the team,[6] but he did not play for them throughout the season, instead making his List A for Cricket Australia XI in the 2016–17 Matador BBQs One-Day Cup. He played in the first match against Queensland, and late in the innings he bowled fellow Queenslander Ben Cutting to take his first List A wicket.[7] He took six wickets across four matches in the tournament, the second-most of any player for Cricket Australia XI.[8]

No longer in the Cricket Australia XI squad, Doggett played his first matches for Queensland in the 2017–18 JLT One-Day Cup and took five wickets for the team while conceding 6.19 runs per over in four matches.[9] He then made his first-class debut in the opening round of the 2017–18 Sheffield Shield season. In his first innings of first-class bowling he had impressive figures of 4/33 while Victoria were bowled out for 148.[10] In February 2018, in round eight of the 2017–18 Sheffield Shield season, he took his maiden five-wicket haul in first-class cricket.[11]
