SIR ALAN AYCKBOURN, (born 12 April 1939) is a prolific British playwright and director. He has written and produced more than seventy full-length plays in Scarborough and London and was, between 1972 and 2009, the artistic director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough, where all but four of his plays have received their first performance. More than 40 have subsequently been produced in the West End, at the Royal National Theatre or by the Royal Shakespeare Company since his first hit _Relatively Speaking_ opened at the Duke of York's Theatre in 1969.

Major successes include _Absurd Person Singular_ (1975), _The Norman Conquests_ trilogy (1973), _Bedroom Farce_ (1975), _Just Between Ourselves_ (1976), _A Chorus of Disapproval_ (1984), _Woman in Mind_ (1985), _A Small Family Business_ (1987), _Man Of The Moment_ (1988), _House_ & _Garden_ (1999) and _Private Fears in Public Places_ (2004). His plays have won numerous awards, including seven London _Evening Standard_ Awards. They have been translated into over 35 languages and are performed on stage and television throughout the world. Ten of his plays have been staged on Broadway, attracting two Tony nominations, and one Tony award.


Life

Childhood

Ayckbourn was born in Hampstead, London.[1][2] His mother Irene Worley ("Lolly") (1906–1998) was a writer of short stories who published under the name "Mary James".[3] His father, Horace Ayckbourn (1904–1965), was an orchestral violinist, at one time deputy leader of the London Symphony Orchestra.[4] His parents, who separated shortly after World War II, never married, and Ayckbourn's mother divorced her first husband to marry again in 1948.[5]

Ayckbourn wrote his first play at Wisborough Lodge (a preparatory school in the village of Wisborough Green) when he was about 10.[6] Whilst at prep school as a boarder, his mother wrote to tell him she was marrying Cecil Pye, a bank manager. When he went home for the holidays, his new family consisted of his mother, his stepfather and Christopher, his stepfather's son by an earlier marriage. This relationship too, reportedly ran into difficulties early on.[7]

Ayckbourn attended Haileybury and Imperial Service College, in the village of Hertford Heath, and whilst there toured Europe and America with the school's Shakespeare company.[8][9]

Adult life

After leaving school at 17, Ayckbourn's career took several temporary jobs in various places before starting a temporary job at the Scarborough Library Theatre, where he was introduced to the artistic director, Stephen Joseph.[10][11] It is said that Joseph became both a mentor and father figure for Ayckbourn until his untimely death in 1967,[12] and he has consistently spoken highly of him.[13]

Ayckbourn's career was briefly interrupted when he was called for National Service. He was swiftly discharged, officially on medical grounds, but it is suggested that a doctor who noticed his reluctance to join the Armed Forces deliberately failed the medical as a favour.[14] Although Ayckbourn continued to move where his career took him, he settled in Scarborough, eventually buying Longwestgate House, the house formerly owned by Stephen Joseph.[15]

In 1957, Ayckbourn married Christine Roland, another member of the Library Theatre company,[16][17][18] and indeed Ayckbourn's first two plays were written jointly with her under the pseudonym of "Roland Allen".[19] They had two sons, Steven and Philip.[20] However, the marriage had difficulties which eventually led to their separation in 1971. Ayckbourn said that his relationship with Roland became easy once they agreed their marriage was over. Around this time, he started to share a home with Heather Stoney,[21] an actress he had first met ten years earlier.[22] Like his mother, neither he nor Roland sought a divorce for the next thirty years and it was only in 1997 that they formally divorced; Ayckbourn married Stoney.[23][24] One side-effect of the timing is that, as Ayckbourn was awarded a knighthood a few months before the divorce,[25] both his first and second wife were entitled to take the title of Lady Ayckbourn.

In February 2006, he suffered a stroke in Scarborough, and stated: "I hope to be back on my feet, or should I say my left leg, as soon as possible, but I know it is going to take some time. In the meantime I am in excellent hands and so is the Stephen Joseph Theatre."[26] He left hospital after eight weeks and returned to directing after six months,[27] but the following year he announced he would step down as artistic director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre.[28] Ayckbourn, however, continues to write and direct his own work at the theatre.

Influence on plays

Since Ayckbourn's plays started becoming established in the West End, interviewers have raised the question of whether his work is autobiographical.[29] There is no clear answer to this question. There has only been one biography, written by Paul Allen, and this primarily covers his career in the theatre.[30] Ayckbourn has frequently said he sees aspects of himself in all his characters. For example, in _Bedroom Farce_ (1975), he admitted to being, in some respects, all four of the men in the play.[31] It has been suggested that, after Ayckbourn himself, the person who is used the most in his plays is his mother, particularly as Susan in _Woman in Mind_[32] (1985).

What is less clear is how much influence events in Ayckbourn's life have had on his writing. It is true that the theme of marriages in various difficulties was heavily present throughout his plays in the early seventies, around the time his own marriage was coming to an end. However, by this time, he had also witnessed the failures of his parents' relationships as well as those of some of his friends.[33] Which relationships, if any, he drew on for his plays, is unclear. In Paul Allen's biography, Ayckbourn is briefly compared to Dafydd and Guy in _A Chorus of Disapproval_ (1984). Both characters feel themselves in trouble, and there was speculation that Ayckbourn himself may have felt himself to be in trouble. At the time, he had reportedly become seriously involved with another actress, which threatened his relationship with Stoney.[34] But again, it is unclear whether this had any effect on the writing, and Paul Allen's view is that it is not current experience that Ayckbourn uses for his plays.

It could be that Ayckbourn had written plays with himself and his own issues in mind, but as Ayckbourn is portrayed as a guarded and private man,[35] it is hard to imagine him exposing his own life in his plays to any great degree. In the biography, Paul Allen wrote, regarding a suggestion in _Cosmopolitan_ that his plays were becoming autobiographical: "If we take that to mean that his plays tell his own life story, he still hasn't started."[36]


Career

Early career and acting

On leaving school his theatrical career started immediately, with an introduction to Sir Donald Wolfit by his French master.[37] Ayckbourn joined Wolfit on tour to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe as an acting assistant stage manager (meaning a role that involved both acting and stage management) for three weeks,[38][39] with his first role on the professional stage being various parts in _The Strong are Lonely_ by Fritz Hochwälder.[40] In the following year, Ayckbourn appeared in six other plays at the Connaught Theatre, Worthing,[41][42] and the Thorndyke theatre, Leatherhead.[43][44]

In 1957, Ayckbourn was employed by the director Stephen Joseph at the Library Theatre, Scarborough, the predecessor to the modern Stephen Joseph Theatre.[45][46] His role, again, was initially an acting stage manager.[47][48] This employment led to Ayckbourn's first professional script commission, in 1958. When he complained about the quality of a script he was performing, Joseph challenged him to write a better one. The result was _The Square Cat_, written under the pseudonym Roland Allen and first performed in 1959.[49] In this play, Ayckbourn himself played the character Jerry Watiss.[50]

After thirty-four appearances in plays at the Library Theatre, including four of his own, in 1962 Ayckbourn moved to Stoke-on-Trent to help set up the Victoria Theatre, (now the New Vic),[51] where he appeared in a further eighteen plays.[52] His final appearance in one of his own plays was as the Crimson Gollywog in the disastrous children's play _Christmas v Mastermind_.[53] He left the Stoke company in 1964, officially to commit his time to the London production of _Mr. Whatnot_, but reportedly because was having trouble working with the artistic director, Peter Cheeseman.[54] By now, his career as a writer was coming to fruition, and his acting career was sidelined.

His final role on stage was as Jerry in _Two for the Seesaw_ by William Gibson, at the Civic Theatre in Rotherham.[55] He was left stranded on stage because Heather Stoney was unable to re-appear because the props had been left unpacked, and this led him to decide acting was more trouble than it was worth.[56] The assistant stage manager on the production, Bill Kenwright, would become one of the UK's most successful producers.

Writing

Ayckbourn's earliest plays were written and produced at a time when the Scarborough Library theatre, like most regional theatres, regularly commissioned work from their own actors to keep costs down (the other notable actor whose work was being commissioned being David Campton).[57] His first play, _The Square Cat_, was sufficiently popular locally to secure further commissions although not this or the following three plays had much impact beyond Scarborough.[58] But, after his transfer to Victoria Theatre in Stoke-on-Trent, there came _Christmas v Mastermind_, which flopped and is now universally regarded as Ayckbourn's greatest disaster.[59][60]

His fortunes began to revive in 1963 with _Mr. Whatnot_, again premiering at the Victoria Theatre. This was the first play that Ayckbourn was sufficiently happy with to allow performances today, and the first play to receive a West End performance. However, the West End production flopped, in part down to misguided casting.[61][62] After this, Ayckbourn experimented by collaborating with comedians, first writing a monologue for Tommy Cooper, and later with Ronnie Barker, who played Lord Slingsby-Craddock in the London production of _Mr Whatnot_ in 1964, for the scripts of for LWT's _Hark at Barker_. Ayckbourn used the pseudonym 'Peter Caulfield' because he was under exclusive contract to the BBC at the time.[63]

Then, in 1965, back at the Scarborough Library Theatre, _Meet my Father_ was produced, later retitled _Relatively Speaking_. This time, the play was a massive success, both in Scarborough and the West End, making Alan Ayckbourn rich and earning him a congratulatory telegram from Noël Coward.[64][65] This was not quite the end of Ayckbourn's hit-and-miss record, because his following play, _The Sparrow_ only ran for three weeks at Scarborough.[66][67] However, the following play, _How the Other Half Loves_, secured his runaway success as a playwright.[68][69]

The height of Ayckbourn's commercial success included _Absurd Person Singular_ (1975), _The Norman Conquests_ trilogy (1973), _Bedroom Farce_ (1975) and _Just Between Ourselves_ (1976), all plays that focused heavily on marriage in the British middle classes. The only failure during this period was a 1975 musical with Andrew Lloyd Webber, _Jeeves_, and even this did little to dent Ayckbourn's popularity.[70][71] Although his plays have received major West End productions almost from the beginning of his writing career, and hence have been reviewed in British newspapers, Ayckbourn's work was for years routinely dismissed as being too slight for serious study. Recently, scholars have begun to view Ayckbourn as an important commentator on the lifestyles of the British suburban middle class, and as a stylistic innovator who experiments with theatrical styles within the boundaries set by popular tastes.

From the 1980s, Ayckbourn began to move away from the recurring themes of marriage and explore other contemporary themes, one example being _Woman in Mind_, a play performed entirely from the perspective of a Woman going through a nervous breakdown.[72][73] He also experimented with several more unconventional ways of writing plays, such as _Intimate Exchanges_, which has one beginning and sixteen possible endings, and _House & Garden_, where two plays take place simultaneously of two different stages, as well as diversifying into children's theatre (such as _Mr A's Amazing Maze Plays_ and musical plays, such as _By Jeeves_ (a more successful rewrite of the original _Jeeves_).

With a résumé of over seventy plays, of which more than forty have played at the National Theatre or in the West End, Alan Ayckbourn is one of England's most successful living playwrights. Despite his success, honours and awards (which include a prestigious Laurence Olivier Award), Alan Ayckbourn remains a relatively anonymous figure dedicated to regional theatre.[74] Throughout his writing career, all but four of his plays were premiered at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough in its three different locations.[75]

Ayckbourn received the CBE in 1987[76][77] and was knighted in the 1997 New Year Honours.[78][79] It is frequently claimed[80] (but not proven)[81] that Alan Ayckbourn is the most performed living English playwright, and the second most performed of all time after Shakespeare.

Although Ayckbourn's plays no longer dominate the theatrical scene on the scale of his earlier works, he continues to write, his most recent major success being _Private Fears in Public Places_ that had a hugely successful Off-Broadway run at 59E59 Theaters, and in 2006 was made into a film _Cœurs_, directed by Alain Resnais.[82] After suffering a stroke, there was uncertainty as to whether he could continue to write[83] (the Ayckbourn play premiered immediately after the stroke, _If I Were You_, was written before his illness), but his first play written afterwards, _Life and Beth_, was premiered in the summer of 2008. Ayckbourn continues to write for the Stephen Joseph Theatre on invitation of his successor as artistic director, Chris Monks, with the first new play under this arrangement, _My Wonderful Day_, performed in October 2009.[84] His latest play, _Roundelay_ is scheduled to open in September 2014; the order in which each of the five acts is played in each performance is to be left to chance (allowing 120 possible permutations), with members of the audience being invited to extract five coloured ping pong balls from a bag beforehand.[85]

Many of Ayckbourn's plays have had their New York premiere at 59E59 Theaters as part of their annual Brits Off Broadway Festitval including _Private Fears in Public Places_, _Intimate Exchanges_, _My Wonderful Day_ and _Neighbourhood Watch_ among others.

Directing

Although Ayckbourn is best known as a writer, it is said that he only spends 10% of his time writing plays. Most of the rest of his time is spent directing.[86]

Ayckbourn began directing at the Scarborough Library Theatre in 1961, with a production of _Gaslight_ by Patrick Hamilton.[87][88] He directed five other plays that year and the following year in Scarborough, and after transferring to the Victoria Theatre, directed a further six plays in 1963. Between 1964 and 1967 (when much of his time was taken up by various productions of his early successes _Mr. Whatnot_ and _Relatively Speaking_) he only directed one play (_The Sparrow_, written by himself, later withdrawn), but in 1968 he resumed regularly directing plays, mostly at Scarborough.[89] At this time he also worked as a radio drama producer for the BBC, based in Leeds.

At first, his directing career was separate from his writing career. It was not until 1963 that Ayckbourn directed a play of his own (a revival of _Standing Room Only_), 1967 that Ayckbourn directed a premiere of his own (_The Sparrow_).[90] The London premieres remained in the hands of other directors for longer, with the first play of his both written and directed by him in London (_Bedroom Farce_) waiting until 1977.[91][92]

After the death of Stephen Joseph in 1967, the position of Director of Productions was appointed on an annual basis. Ayckbourn was offered this position in 1969 and 1970, succeeding Rodney Wood, but he handed the position over to Caroline Smith in 1971 (having spent most of his time that year in the US with _How the Other Half Loves_). He became Director of Productions again in 1972, and this time, on 12 November that same year, he was made the permanent artistic director of the theatre.[93]

In mid-1986, Ayckbourn accepted an invitation to work as a visiting director for two years at the Royal National Theatre in London, form his own company, and perform a play in each of the three auditoria provided at least one was a new play of his own.[94] Using a stock company that included established performers like Michael Gambon, Polly Adams and Simon Cadell. The three plays became four, and were: _Tons of Money_ by Will Evans and Valentine, with adaptations by Ayckbourn (Lyttelton), Arthur Miller's _A View From the Bridge_ (Cottesloe), his own _A Small Family Business_ (Olivier) and John Ford's _'Tis Pity She's a Whore_ (Olivier again).[95] During this time, Ayckbourn shared his role of artistic director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre with Robin Herford[96][97] and returned in 1987 to direct the premiere of _Henceforward..._.[98][99]

He announced in 1999 that he would step back from directing the work of other playwrights, in order to concentrate on his own plays,[100] the last one being Rob Shearman's _Knights in Plastic Armour_ in 1999; the exception being in 2002 when he directed the world premiere of Tim Firth's _The Safari Party_.[101]

In 2002, following a dispute over the Duchess Theatre's handling of _Damsels in Distress_, Ayckbourn sharply criticised both this and the West End's treatment of theatre in general, in particular their casting of celebrities.[102] Although he did not explicitly say he would boycott the West End, he did not return to direct in the West End again until 2009 with a revival of _Woman in Mind_[103] (although he did allow other West End producers to revive _Absurd Person Singular_[104] in 2007 and _The Norman Conquests_[105] in 2008).

After Ayckbourn suffered a stroke in February 2006, he returned to work in September and premiered his 70th play _If I Were You_ at the Stephen Joseph Theatre the following month.[106]

He announced in June 2007 that he would retire as artistic director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre after the 2008 season.[107] His successor, Chris Monks, took over at the start of the 2009–2010 season,[108] but Ayckbourn remained to direct premieres and revivals of his work at the theatre, beginning with _How the Other Half Loves_ in June 2009.[109]

In March 2010 he directed an in-the-round revival of his play _Taking Steps_ at the Orange Tree Theatre, winning universal press acclaim.[110]

In July 2014, Ayckbourn directed a musical adaptation of _The Boy Who Fell Into A Book_, with musical adaptation and lyrics by Paul James and music by Eric Angus and Cathy Shostak. The show ran in The Stephen Joseph Theatre and received critical acclaim.

[113] This numbering is the system used by the official Ayckbourn site as to how many plays have been written. This includes the full-length plays performed but later withdrawn and full-length plays for family audiences, but excludes revues and musical entertainments, adaptations of other plays, plays for children, individual one-act plays, "grey plays" (those written for performance but not publication) and plays for television. It also treats each of the plays in _The Norman Conquests_, _House and Garden_ and _Damsels in Distress_ as one play each, the one-acts from _Confusions_ as a single full-length play, all variations of _Intimate Exchanges_ as one play (likewise for _Sisterly Feelings_ and _It Could Be Any One Of Us_), both parts of _The Revengers' Comedies_ as a single play, and the rewrites of _Jeeves_ and _Callisto 5_ as the same play as the original. Other sources may number plays differently.
