LE INVASIONI BARBARICHE IN ITALIA is Professor Pasquale Villari's popular account of the barbarian invasions of the Roman Empire from the Antonines to the coronation of Charlemagne in 800 A.D. as Holy Roman Emperor. The book was first published in 1901 by Ulrico Hoepli in Milan.[1]

The book, with 3 maps and about 500 pages,[2] was intended to be easy to read and appealing to the general reader of Italian. Hoepli published the second, third and fourth editions in 1905, 1920 and 1928. In the book, Villari's main focus is on the Teutonic invasions of the 3rd through 6th centuries A.D.

In 1902 Fisher Unvwin published a 2-volume translation (_The Barbarian Invasions of Italy_) by Linda Villari, the wife of Pasquale Villari.[3]
