The winningest high school coach in the country — over 1,000 victories in girls basketball, track and cross country. 68 state championships. 8 National championships.

Coaching since 1965, at the age of 12 David C Houle, a member of the National Hall of Fame who amassed more state championships than any other high school coach, and was named by [1]_USA Today_ as "The Most Successful High School Coach in America". He helped Mountain View High School (Utah)'s athletes, in boys' and girls' track and cross country, and girls' basketball, earn 68 state championships, as well as numerous region trophies. After winning the boys' cross country national title in 2002, he was named the Coach of the Year. His athletes were known for their love and support towards their opponents, and for years of service to the Orem City community. Houle's reign, however, ended with allegations of inappropriate conduct while on a road trip with his basketball team.[2] Houle is reported to have allowed two girls who had been sick to sleep in his room while he walked in the lobby of the hotel all night to keep them away from the rest of the team. Both the girls and their parents said nothing wrong was done and they appreciated the gesture made. Though no accusations of impropriety surfaced, several rules were violated in allowing the members of his team to use his hotel room. Despite being aggressively recruited by other schools throughout his coaching reign, Houle opted to stick to what he loved best and later worked at a nearby private school.

In his final days of coaching, Houle said, "I'm 52, and I hope to die at 92, so I have 40 good years left of coaching."

Houle currently lives in American Fork, Utah.
