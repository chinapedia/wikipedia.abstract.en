JOHANN ADAM PHILIPP HEPP (26 October 1797, in Kaiserslautern – 5 February 1867, in Frankfurt am Main) was a German physician and lichenologist.

He studied medicine at the University of Würzburg, and from 1826 worked as a doctor in Neustadt an der Haardt. Because of his activities during the German revolutionary period of 1848–49, he was forced to move to Switzerland, where he lived in exile for the rest of his life. In Switzerland he devoted his time to lichenological research, and in 1857 published a work on European lichens titled _Die Flechten Europas in getrockneten mikroskopisch untersuchten Exemplaren mit Beschreibung und Abbildung ihrer Sporen_. He died on 5 February 1867 while visiting his daughter in Frankfurt.[1][2]

The mycological family Heppiaceae commemorates his name, as does the lichen genus _Heppia_ (Nägeli ex A.Massal, 1854), the botanical genus _Heppiella_ (Regel, 1853; family Gesneriaceae) and the fungal genus _Neoheppia_ (Zahlbr., 1909).[3]
