HIGH CIVILIZATION WORLD TOUR is the tenth concert tour by the Bee Gees in support of their nineteenth studio album _High Civilization_. The tour began on May 25, 1991 in Kiel, Germany and ended on July 9, 1991 in Birmingham, England.


Background

_High Civilization_ was the last album by the Bee Gees recorded for Warner Bros. Records, Warner Music as part of a four-year contract. It was also the first post-RSO Records era album not to feature concert dates in the United States, presumably due to health issues with Barry Gibb and lackluster record sales. The band played fourteen successful concerts in Germany and toured other European countries such as France, Switzerland, Netherlands, Ireland and the UK. They also played three dates in Spain for the first time in their career.
