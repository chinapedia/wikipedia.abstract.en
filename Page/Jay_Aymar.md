(Tyson was nominated for a 2009 Canadian Folk Music Awards for Solo Artist of the Year).


Life and career

Aymar grew up as the youngest of a family of eight children in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. He attended Sir James Dunn Secondary School before majoring in English literature at Carleton University in Ottawa, where he "became drunk on language and storytellers like Mark Twain and Stephen Leacock."[6]

After graduating, he began a series of jobs which included freelance writing and various sales positions.

Once discovered, the CBC produced his very first demos in 1993.[7]

He released his first studio album _Howling at the Moon_ in 1996 (now out of print) and has since released five more studio albums and one live album.[8]

In 2008 Aymar's song "My Cherry Coloured Rose" (written about hockey icon Don Cherry and his wife Rose) was recorded by Ian Tyson.[9]

Aymar released his sixth studio album with producer Michael Phillip Wojewoda on October 12, 2018.[10]
