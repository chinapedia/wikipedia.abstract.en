His uncle, major Adam Solski, was with his father in the camp, and was murdered on 9 April 1940.[2]

At the end of World War II he has been through the camps from Pruszków to Buchenwald, and then to the labor camp in Lehrte near Hanover, where he and his mother were freed thanks to the efforts of her brother-in-law.[3] After returning to Poland, they lived in Toruń.
