LUCIANO RISPOLI (12 July 1932 – 26 October 2016) was an Italian television and radio writer and presenter.

Born in Reggio Calabria, the son of a colonel, Rispoli moved to Rome to study law at the Sapienza University. In 1954 he passed a public exam to enter the newly created RAI. In 1960, he debuted as radio presenter with the program _Il vostro spettacolo_.[1]

Starting from the 1960s, Rispoli held several executive positions on radio and television, and contributed to create popular radio programs such as _Bandiera Gialla_, _Chiamate Roma 3131_, _La Corrida_. From the 1970s on he was gradually more active as a presenter, getting a personal success as host and author of a quiz show about Italian language, _Parola mia_ (1985-88).[2][3]

In 1991 Rispoli left RAI and moved to Telemontecarlo, where he hosted the musical program _La più bella sei tu_ (1991-2) and _Tappeto volante_, a long-running talk show broadcast on Telemontecarlo between 1993 and 2000 and later moved to other channels until 2009.[4][5]
