OBSERVER MEDIA is an American online media company.[1][2][3] The company was formed through several acquisitions, including acquisition of _The New York Observer_ in 2007.[4][5][6] Observer Media is based in lower Manhattan, New York City, and had been owned by businessman Jared Kushner, until Joseph Meyer was named owner and publisher in January 2017.[7].[8][9][10] It currently publishes the _Commercial Observer_, observer.com, and commercialobserver.com.[11][12] As of November 2016, Observer Media announced it would no longer print the _New York Observer_. The observer.com site is a consolidation of several notable online properties, including _The Gallerist_, _BetaBeat_, _NY Politicker_, and _PolitickerNJ_.[13][14][15]


History

In 2007, Jared Kushner began acquiring and merging several print and online media publications into the Observer brand, including _The New York Observer_, _BetaBeat_, _Gallerist_, _NY Politicker_, _SCENE Magazine_, and _PolitickerNJ_.[16][17] These acquisitions became integrated into the website observer.com (_Gallerist_ was integrated in September 2014, _PolitickerNY_ in March 2014, _BetaBeat_ in January 2015, and _PolitickerNJ_ in August 2016).[18]

In March 2012, Observer Media launched _The Commercial Observer_, a commercial real estate publication.[19] The organization has since received various awards, including "NAREE's 65th Annual Real Estate Journalism" award,[20] "Best Team Report Silver" award (2013),[21] and "Best Weekly Newspaper Report Silver" award (2014).[22] _The Commercial Observer_ publishes at commercialobserver.com, and also publishes weekly print edition.

James Karklins, the former chief marketing officer at _Newsweek_, was named president of Observer Media on January 8, 2018.[23][24]


Format

The Observer Media online site includes four main content categories: News & Politics, Arts & Entertainment, Business & Technology, and Style & Design. Observer Media discontinued a print edition called _The New York Observer_ in November 2016.


Controversy

In April 2016, former editor-in-chief Ken Kurson was criticized for providing "input" to Donald Trump in a speech given at the annual AIPAC conference.[25] The _Observer_ was also criticized in 2014 for an investigative piece on former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.[26] In July 2016, Observer staff journalist Dana Schwartz published an open letter to her boss Jared Kushner criticizing him for his involvement in Donald Trump's (Kushner's father-in-law) presidential campaign.[27] Shortly thereafter, Kushner responded to the letter defending his contributions to Trump's presidential campaign.[28] Both articles were widely circulated in social media, and attracted attention from various media outlets.[29]
