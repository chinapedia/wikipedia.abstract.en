Criticism

_Yummy Mummies_ was panned by critics.

Writing for news.com.au Debbie Schipp was highly critical of the show. Schipp described it as "fabricated, contrived, vapid, vacuous, pointless tripe". Schipp wrote that she had watched the show so others don't have to. Schipp further attacked the show as "not even car-crash. It’s cringe-making".[7]

In _The Sydney Morning Herald_ Craig Mathieson wrote that "To call Yummy Mummies car-crash television is to understate how garish, stupid, poorly executed, and dutifully offensive it is".[8]
