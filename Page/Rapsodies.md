Notes

The initial album release on CD and LP had a lot of clipping and distortion. The Philips CD eliminates some of this, whilst the 2007 remaster overseen by Vangelis himself eradicates it altogether.

"To My Champion and Commander" was composed by the patriarch of Constantinople to commemorate the legendary appearance of the Virgin Mary during a siege of the city in the 7th century.

"Oh, My Sweet Springtime" is a lament of the Virgin Mary upon seeing the body of her dead son, Jesus and is often sung the Thursday before Easter.

"I See Your Bridal Chamber All Bedecked" is a parable of two sets of virgins, the stupid ones who used up all the oil in their lamps early in the evening and the smart ones who waited until the groom came, that relates to the second coming.

"Rhapsody" is an original instrumental composition by Vangelis

"The Beauty of Your Virginity and The Splendor of Your Purity" is something the angel Gabriel said to the Virgin Mary, though the statement is incomplete.

"Resurrection" is a basic Easter hymn.

"Song of Songs" is poetic modern Greek translation of a portion of the Song of Solomon set to an original composition by Vangelis.
