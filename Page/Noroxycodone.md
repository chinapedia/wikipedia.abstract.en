NOROXYCODONE is the major metabolite of the opioid analgesic oxycodone.[1][2][3] It is formed from oxycodone in the liver via N-demethylation predominantly by CYP3A4.[4][5][6] Noroxycodone binds to and activates the Î¼-opioid receptor (MOR) similarly to oxycodone, although with one-third of the affinity of oxycodone and 5- to 10-fold lower activational potency.[7][8][9] However, although a potent MOR agonist, noroxycodone poorly crosses the blood-brain-barrier into the central nervous system, and for this reason, is only minimally analgesic in comparison.[10][11][12][13]
