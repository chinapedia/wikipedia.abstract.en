The PICO TENERIFFE, is a rocky cape on the northeast coast of the island of Barbados, in the Parish of Saint Peter.[1]

It is a coral cliff in the shape of a pinnacle that does not reach 100 meters in height, named after the fact that the island of Tenerife in Spain is the first land east of Barbados, according to the inhabitants of the place. The presence in the place of people arrived from the Canary Islands in the time of the colonization of Barbados is not ruled out, but unlikely.[2][3]
