LINEAGE SELECTION, occurs when the frequency of one biological lineage changes in frequency relative to another lineage. Lineage selection is a generalization of individual based natural selection; the stating that an allele is favored by natural selection is equivalent to stating that the lineage bearing the allele is favored by natural selection.[1] For alleles with simple positive or negative fitness effects, lineage and individual based selection are equivalent. However, lineage selection can accommodate a wider array of evolutionary phenomena, such as the adaptive evolution of evolvability, altruism, and recombination.[2][3][4] Additionally, lineage selection is useful in determining the effects of mutations in highly structured environments such as tumors.[5]
