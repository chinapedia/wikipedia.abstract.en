GILBERT CESBRON (13 January 1913, Paris – 13 August 1979, Paris) was a French novelist.

Born in Paris, Cesbron attended what is now known as Lycée Condorcet. In 1944, he published his first novel, _Les innocents de Paris_ ("_The Innocent of Paris_"), in Switzerland. He first came into wide public acclaim with the release of _Notre prison est un royaume_ ("_Our Prison is a Kingdom_") in 1948, and _Il est minuit, docteur Schweitzer_ ("_It is midnight, Doctor Schweitzer_") in 1950.

In his works, Cesbron tended to illustrate and describe relevant social topics such as: juvenile delinquency in _Chiens perdus sans collier_ ("_Lost Dogs Without Collars_"), violence in _Entre chiens et loups_ ("_Between Dogs and Wolves_"), euthanasia in _Il est plus tard que tu ne penses_ ("_It is Later than You Think_"), and working priests in _Les Saints vont en enfer_ ("_Saints go to Hell_").

In 1955, Cesbron's book _Chiens perdus sans collier_, the story of an orphan boy and a benevolent judge, was made starring Jean Gabin and Robert Dalban.
