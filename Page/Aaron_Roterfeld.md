Roterfeld became a radio presenter at ORF, before moving on to a private radio station in 1998. In cooperation with this station, he set up a recording studio in 1999 and in 2001 developed an algorithm which enabled radio programmes to be controlled automatically by software.[2][3][4]

He only came onto the music scene in 2011, when his song "STOP" from the album "Blood Diamond Romance" stayed in the top 10 of the German club charts (deutsche Clubcharts, DAC) for 8 weeks.[5][6][7]

In 2015, it emerged that he had spent some time song writing in Lebanon. During a student demonstration there, he was hit by a tear gas projectile.[8][9][10][11][12] Shortly after this, Roterfeld released an alternative music video to the song Blood Diamond Romance, which he dedicated to the students’ demands for more political transparency.[13]
