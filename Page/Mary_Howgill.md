MARY HOWGILL (1623 â€“ before 1681) was a prominent early member of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in England. She is best known for her public defense of Quakers in a 1656 letter to Oliver Cromwell.[1][2][3] She delivered the letter in person and subsequently had a long discourse with Cromwell. She began the letter:

The letter was written during a time of religious persecution, and challenges political and religious authorities that punished statements of religious conscience with confiscation of property, physical violence, and imprisonment.[4]


Life

She was probably the sister of Francis Howgill of Grayrigg, Westmoreland. Both wrote letters to Cromwell and both were imprisoned as a result. She had been imprisoned earlier for public preaching of Quaker doctrines in Kendal in 1653.[5]

She wrote a second pamphlet, "The Vision of the Lord of Hosts".[6][7] This pamphlet was written after King Charles II was returned to the throne, and described a dream in which her God tells her of the terrible persecutions of Quakers about to happen:
