_SAINT MARGARET AND THE DRAGON_ is a circa 1518 painting of Saint Margaret by the Renaissance painter Raphael, now held in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.[1]

The painting shows the saint at the moment before she is swallowed alive by the dragon. She is shown unafraid, holding the crucifix that will save her once she is swallowed. Another version showing her holding a palm branch is in the collection of the Louvre.

This painting was documented in David Teniers the Younger's catalog _Theatrum Pictorium_ of the art collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in 1659 and again in 1673,[2] but the portrait had already enjoyed notoriety in Teniers' portrayals of the Archduke's art collection:
