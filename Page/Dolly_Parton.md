DOLLY REBECCA PARTON (born January 19, 1946) is an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, actress, author, businesswoman, and humanitarian, known primarily for her work in country music. After achieving success as a songwriter for others, Parton made her album debut in 1967 with _Hello, I'm Dolly_. With steady success during the remainder of the 1960s (both as a solo artist and with a series of duet albums with Porter Wagoner), her sales and chart peak came during the 1970s and continued into the 1980s. Parton's albums in the 1990s sold less well, but she achieved commercial success again in the new millennium and has released albums on various independent labels since 2000, including her own label, Dolly Records.

Parton's music includes 25 Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)-certified gold, platinum and multi-platinum awards. She has had 25 songs reach No. 1 on the _Billboard_ country music charts, a record for a female artist (tied with Reba McEntire). She has 41 career top-10 country albums, a record for any artist, and she has 110 career charted singles over the past 40 years. She has garnered nine Grammy Awards, two Academy Award nominations, ten Country Music Association Awards, seven Academy of Country Music Awards, three American Music Awards, and is one of only seven female artists to win the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year Award. Parton has received 47 Grammy nominations.

In 1999, Parton was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. She has composed over 3,000 songs, including "I Will Always Love You" (a two-time U.S. country chart-topper, as well as an international pop hit for Whitney Houston), "Jolene", "Coat of Many Colors", and "9 to 5". She is also one of the few to have received at least one nomination from the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, Tony Awards, and Emmy Awards. As an actress, she has starred in films such as _9 to 5_ (1980) and _The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas_ (1982), for which she earned Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress, as well as _Rhinestone_ (1984), _Steel Magnolias_ (1989), _Straight Talk_ (1992) and _Joyful Noise_ (2012).


Early life and career

Dolly Rebecca Parton was born January 19, 1946, in a one-room cabin on the banks of the Little Pigeon River in Pittman Center, Tennessee, a very small community in Sevier County in the Great Smoky Mountains of East Tennessee.[1] She is the fourth of 12 children born to Avie Lee Caroline (née Owens; 1923–2003) and Robert Lee Parton Sr. (1921–2000). Mr. Parton (known as "Lee") worked in the mountains of east Tennessee, first as a sharecropper and later tending his own small farm and acreage. He also worked temporary side jobs to make ends meet.[2] He was illiterate.[3] Despite his lack of formal education, Parton has said that he was one of the smartest people she has known. Avie Lee was homemaker for the large family. Her 11 pregnancies (the tenth being twins) in 20 years made her a mother of 12 by age 35. Often in poor health, she still managed to keep house and entertain her children with songs and tales of mountain folklore. Avie Lee's father, Jake Owens, was a Pentecostal preacher, so Parton and her siblings all attended church regularly. Parton has long credited her father for her business savvy, and her mother's family for her musical abilities. While she was still very young, Dolly Parton's family moved to a farm on nearby Locust Ridge. Most of her cherished memories of youth happened there, and it is the place about which she wrote the song "My Tennessee Mountain Home" in the 1970s. Parton bought back the Locust Ridge property in the 1980s. Two of her siblings are no longer living; Larry died shortly after birth in 1955, and Floyd died in 2018. [4]

Dolly Parton's middle name comes from her maternal great-great-grandmother Rebecca (Dunn) Whitted.[5][6] She has described her family as "dirt poor."[7] Parton's father paid the doctor who helped deliver her with a bag of cornmeal. She outlined her family's poverty in her early songs "Coat of Many Colors" and "In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)". They lived in a rustic, one-room cabin in Locust Ridge,[8] just north of the Greenbrier Valley of the Great Smoky Mountains, a predominantly Pentecostal area. Music played an important role in her early life. She was brought up in the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee),[9] the church her grandfather, Jake Robert Owens, pastored. Her earliest public performances were in the church, beginning at age six. At seven, she started playing a homemade guitar. When she was eight, her uncle bought her first real guitar.[10][11]

Parton began performing as a child,[12] singing on local radio and television programs in the East Tennessee area.[13] By ten, she was appearing on _The Cas Walker Show_ on both WIVK Radio and WBIR-TV in Knoxville, Tennessee. At 13, she was recording (the single "Puppy Love") on a small Louisiana label, Goldband Records,[14] and appeared at the Grand Ole Opry, where she first met Johnny Cash, who encouraged her to follow her own instincts regarding her career.[15]

After graduating from Sevier County High School in 1964, Parton moved to Nashville the next day.[16] Her initial success came as a songwriter, having signed with Combine Publishing shortly after her arrival;[17] with her frequent songwriting partner, her uncle Bill Owens, she wrote several charting singles during this time, including two top-10 hits: Bill Phillips's "Put It Off Until Tomorrow" (1966] and Skeeter Davis's "Fuel to the Flame" (1967). Her songs were recorded by many other artists during this period, including Kitty Wells and Hank Williams Jr.[18] She signed with Monument Records in 1965, at age 19; she initially was pitched as a bubblegum pop singer. She released a string of singles, but the only one that charted, "Happy, Happy Birthday Baby", did not crack the _Billboard_ Hot 100. Although she expressed a desire to record country material, Monument resisted, thinking her unique voice with its strong vibrato was not suited to the genre.

After her composition "Put It Off Until Tomorrow", as recorded by Bill Phillips (with Parton, uncredited, on harmony), went to number six on the country chart in 1966, the label relented and allowed her to record country. Her first country single, "Dumb Blonde" (composed by Curly Putman, one of the few songs during this era that she recorded but did not write), reached number 24 on the country chart in 1967, followed by "Something Fishy", which went to number 17. The two songs appeared on her first full-length album, _Hello, I'm Dolly_.[19]


Music career

1967–1975: Country music success

Porter_Wagoner_and_Dolly_Parton_1969.jpg In 1967, musician and country music entertainer Porter Wagoner invited Parton to join his organization, offering her a regular spot on his weekly syndicated television program _The Porter Wagoner Show_, and in his road show. As documented in her 1994 autobiography,[20] initially, much of Wagoner's audience was unhappy that Norma Jean, the performer whom Parton had replaced, had left the show, and was reluctant to accept Parton (sometimes chanting loudly for Norma Jean from the audience).[21] With Wagoner's assistance, however, Parton was eventually accepted. Wagoner convinced his label, RCA Victor, to sign her. RCA decided to protect their investment by releasing her first single as a duet with Wagoner. That song, a remake of Tom Paxton's "The Last Thing on My Mind", released in late 1967, reached the country top 10 in January 1968, launching a six-year streak of virtually uninterrupted top-10 singles for the pair.

Parton's first solo single for RCA Victor, "Just Because I'm a Woman", was released in the summer of 1968 and was a moderate chart hit, reaching number 17. For the remainder of the decade, none of her solo efforts – even "In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)", which later became a standard – was as successful as her duets with Wagoner. The duo was named Vocal Group of the Year in 1968 by the Country Music Association, but Parton's solo records were continually ignored. Wagoner had a significant financial stake in her future; as of 1969, he was her co-producer and owned nearly half of Owe-Par,[22] the publishing company Parton had founded with Bill Owens.

By 1970, both Parton and Wagoner had grown frustrated by her lack of solo chart success. Wagoner persuaded Parton to record Jimmie Rodgers' "Mule Skinner Blues", a gimmick that worked. The record shot to number three, followed closely, in February 1971, by her first number-one single, "Joshua". For the next two years, she had numerous solo hits – including her signature song "Coat of Many Colors" (number four, 1971) – in addition to her duets. Top-20 singles included "The Right Combination" and "Burning the Midnight Oil" (both duets with Wagoner, 1971); "Lost Forever in Your Kiss", (with Wagoner) "Touch Your Woman", (1972) "My Tennessee Mountain Home" and "Travelin' Man" (1973).[23]

Although her solo singles and the Wagoner duets were successful, her biggest hit of this period was "Jolene". Released in late 1973, it topped the country chart in February 1974 and reached the lower regions of the Hot 100. (It eventually also charted in the U.K., reaching number seven in 1976, representing Parton's first U.K. success). Parton, who had always envisioned a solo career, made the decision to leave Wagoner's organization; the pair performed their last duet concert in April 1974, and she stopped appearing on his TV show in mid-1974, although they remained affiliated. He helped produce her records through 1975.[24] The pair continued to release duet albums, their final release being 1975's _Say Forever You'll Be Mine_.[25]

In 1974, her song, "I Will Always Love You", written about her professional break from Wagoner, went to number one on the country chart. Around the same time, Elvis Presley indicated that he wanted to record the song. Parton was interested until Presley's wily manager, Colonel Tom Parker, told her that it was standard procedure for the songwriter to sign over half of the publishing rights to any song recorded by Presley.[26] Parton refused. That decision has been credited with helping to make her many millions of dollars in royalties from the song over the years. Parton had three solo singles reach number one on the country chart in 1974 ("Jolene", "I Will Always Love You" and "Love Is Like a Butterfly"), as well as the duet with Porter Wagoner, "Please Don't Stop Loving Me". In a 2019 episode of the Sky Arts music series _Brian Johnson: A Life on the Road_, Parton described finding old cassette tapes and realizing that she'd composed both "Jolene" and "I Will Always Love You" in the same songwriting session, telling Johnson "Buddy, that was a good night." Parton again topped the singles chart in 1975 with "The Bargain Store".[27]

1976–1986: Pop transition

Young-Dolly-Parton.jpg From 1974 to 1980, she consistently charted in the country Top 10, with eight singles reaching number one. Parton had her own syndicated television variety show, _Dolly!_ (1976–77) During this period, many performers, including Rose Maddox, Kitty Wells, Olivia Newton-John, Emmylou Harris, and Linda Ronstadt covered her songs. Her siblings Randy and Stella both received recording contracts of their own.[28] During this period, Parton began to embark on a high-profile crossover campaign, attempting to aim her music in a more mainstream direction and increase her visibility outside of the confines of country music. In 1976, she began working closely with Sandy Gallin, who served as her personal manager for the next 25 years. With her 1976 album _All I Can Do_, which she co-produced with Porter Wagoner, Parton began taking more of an active role in production, and began specifically aiming her music in a more mainstream, pop direction. Her first entirely self-produced effort, _New Harvest...First Gathering_ (1977), highlighted her pop sensibilities, both in terms of choice of songs – the album contained covers of the pop and R&B classics "My Girl" and "Higher and Higher" – and production.[29] Though the album was well received and topped the U.S. country albums chart, neither it nor its single "Light of a Clear Blue Morning" made much of an impression on the pop charts.

After _New Harvest_'s disappointing chart performance, Parton turned to high-profile pop producer Gary Klein for her next album. The result, 1977's _Here You Come Again,_ became her first million-seller, topping the country album chart and reaching number 20 on the pop chart. The Barry Mann-Cynthia Weil-penned title track topped the country singles chart, and became Parton's first top-ten single on the pop chart (#3). A second single, the double A-sided "Two Doors Down"/"It's All Wrong, But It's All Right" topped the country chart and crossed over to the pop Top 20. For the remainder of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, many of her subsequent singles moved up on both charts simultaneously. Her albums during this period were developed specifically for pop-crossover success.[30]

Dolly_Parton_and_Burnett.jpg In 1978, Parton won a Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance for her _Here You Come Again_ album. She continued to have hits with "Heartbreaker", (1978) "Baby I'm Burning" (1979) and "You're the Only One," (1979) all of which charted in the pop Top 40 and topped the country chart. "Sweet Summer Lovin'" (1979) became the first Parton single in two years to not top the country chart (though it did reach the Top 10). During this period, her visibility continued to increase, with multiple television appearances. A highly publicized candid interview on a _Barbara Walters Special_ in 1977 (timed to coincide with _Here You Come Again_'s release) was followed by appearances in 1978 on Cher's ABC television special, and her own joint special with Carol Burnett on CBS, _Carol and Dolly in Nashville_.

Parton served as one of three co-hosts (along with Roy Clark and Glen Campbell) on the CBS special _Fifty Years of Country Music_. In 1979, Parton hosted the NBC special _The Seventies: An Explosion of Country Music_, performed live at the Ford Theatre in Washington, D.C., and whose audience included President Jimmy Carter. Her commercial success grew in 1980, with three consecutive country chart number-one hits: the Donna Summer-written "Starting Over Again", "Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You", and "9 to 5", which topped the country and pop charts in early 1981.[31] She had another Top 10 single that year with "Making Plans", a single released from a 1980 reunion album with Porter Wagoner.[32]

Dolly_Parton_2.jpg, Hawaii, 1983]] The theme song to the 1980 feature film _9 to 5_, in which she starred along with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, "9 to 5", not only reached number one on the country chart, but also, in February 1981, reached number one on the pop and the adult-contemporary charts, giving her a triple number-one hit. Parton became one of the few female country singers to have a number-one single on the country and pop charts simultaneously. It also received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. Her singles continued to appear consistently in the country Top 10. Between 1981 and 1985, she had 12 Top-10 hits; half of them hit number one. She continued to make inroads on the pop chart as well. A re-recorded version of "I Will Always Love You," from the feature film _The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas_ (1982) scraped the Top 50 that year and her duet with Kenny Rogers, "Islands in the Stream" (written by the Bee Gees and produced by Barry Gibb), spent two weeks at number one in 1983.[33]

In the mid-1980s, her record sales were still relatively strong, with "Save the Last Dance for Me", "Downtown", "Tennessee Homesick Blues" (1984), "Real Love" (another duet with Kenny Rogers), "Don't Call It Love" (1985) and "Think About Love" (1986) all reaching the country Top 10 ("Tennessee Homesick Blues" and "Think About Love" reached number one; "Real Love" also reached number one on the country chart and became a modest crossover hit). However, RCA Records did not renew her contract after it expired in 1986, and she signed with Columbia Records in 1987.[34]

1987–2005: Country and bluegrass period

Along with Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt, she released _Trio_ (1987) to critical acclaim. The album revitalized Parton's music career, spending five weeks at number one on _Billboard's_ Country Albums chart, and also reached the top 10 on _Billboard_'s Top-200 Albums chart. It sold several million copies and produced four Top 10 country hits, including Phil Spector's "To Know Him Is to Love Him", which went to number one. _Trio_ won the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. After a further attempt at pop success with _Rainbow,_ (1987) including the single "The River Unbroken", Parton focused on recording country material. _White Limozeen_ (1989) produced two number one hits in "Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That" and "Yellow Roses". Although Parton's career appeared to be revived, it was actually just a brief revival before contemporary country music came in the early 1990s and moved most veteran artists off the charts.[35]

A duet with Ricky Van Shelton, "Rockin' Years" (1991) reached number one, though Parton's greatest commercial fortune of the decade came when Whitney Houston recorded "I Will Always Love You" for the soundtrack of the feature film _The Bodyguard_ (1992). Both the single and the album were massively successful. Parton's soundtrack album from the 1992 film, _Straight Talk_, however, was less successful. But her 1993 album _Slow Dancing with the Moon_ won critical acclaim and did well on the charts, reaching number four on the country albums chart, and number 16 on the _Billboard_ 200 album chart. She recorded "The Day I Fall in Love" as a duet with James Ingram for the feature film _Beethoven's 2nd_ (1993). The songwriters (Ingram, Carole Bayer Sager, and Clif Magness) were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Parton and Ingram performed the song at the awards telecast. Similar to her earlier collaborative album with Harris and Ronstadt, Parton released _Honky Tonk Angels_ in the fall of 1993 with Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette.[36] It was certified as a gold album by the Recording Industry Association of America and helped revive both Wynette and Lynn's careers. Also in 1994, Parton contributed the song "You Gotta Be My Baby" to the AIDS benefit album _Red Hot + Country_ produced by the Red Hot Organization.[37] A live acoustic album, _Heartsongs: Live from Home_, featuring stripped-down versions of some of her hits, as well as some traditional songs, was released in late 1994.[38]

Parton's recorded music during the mid- to late-1990s remained steady and somewhat eclectic. Her 1995 re-recording of "I Will Always Love You" (performed as a duet with Vince Gill), from her album _Something Special._ won the Country Music Association's Vocal Event of the Year Award. The following year, _Treasures_, an album of covers of 1960s/70s hits was released, and featured a diverse collection of material, including songs by Mac Davis, Pete Seeger, Kris Kristofferson, Cat Stevens, and Neil Young. Her recording of Stevens' "Peace Train" was later re-mixed and released as a dance single, reaching ''Billboard's ''dance singles chart. Her 1998 country-rock album _Hungry Again_ was made up entirely of her own compositions. Although neither of the album's two singles, "(Why Don't More Women Sing) Honky Tonk Songs" and "Salt in my Tears", charted, videos for both songs received significant airplay on CMT. A second and more contemporary collaboration with Harris and Ronstadt, _Trio II_, was released in early 1999. Its cover of Neil Young's song "After the Gold Rush" won a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. Parton also was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1999.[39]

Parton recorded a series of bluegrass-inspired albums, beginning with _The Grass Is Blue_ (1999), winning a Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album; and _Little Sparrow_ (2001), with its cover of Collective Soul's "Shine" winning a Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. The third, _Halos & Horns_ (2002) included a bluegrass version of the Led Zeppelin song "Stairway to Heaven". In 2005, she released _Those Were The Days_ consisting of her interpretations of hits from the folk-rock era of the late 1960s and early 1970s, including "Imagine", "Where Do the Children Play?", "Crimson and Clover", and "Where Have All the Flowers Gone?"[40]

2005–present

Parton earned her second Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song for "Travelin' Thru," which she wrote specifically for the feature film _Transamerica._ (2005) Due to the song's (and film's) acceptance of a transgender woman, Parton received death threats.[41] She returned to number one on the country chart later in 2005 by lending her distinctive harmonies to the Brad Paisley ballad, "When I Get Where I'm Going".[42] In September 2007, Parton released her first single from her own record company, Dolly Records, titled, "Better Get to Livin'", which eventually peaked at number 48 on _Billboard_'s Hot Country Songs chart. It was followed by the studio album _Backwoods Barbie_, which was released on February 26, 2008, and reached number two on the country chart. The album's debut at number 17 on the all-genre _Billboard_ 200 albums chart was the highest in her career.[43] _Backwoods Barbie_ produced four additional singles, including the title track, written as part of her score for _9 to 5: The Musical_, an adaptation of her feature film. After the sudden death of Michael Jackson, whom Parton knew personally, she released a video in which she somberly told of her feelings on Jackson and his death.[44][45]

On October 27, 2009, Parton released a four-CD box set, _Dolly_, which featured 99 songs and spanned most of her career.[46] She released her second live DVD and album, _Live From London_ in October 2009, which was filmed during her sold-out 2008 concerts at London's The O2 Arena. In 2010, she was said to have been working on a dance-oriented album, _Dance with Dolly_, but as of June 2015, the album had not been released. [47] With longtime friend Billy Ray Cyrus, Parton released their album _Brother Clyde_ on August 10, 2010. Parton is featured on "The Right Time", which she co-wrote with Cyrus and Morris Joseph Tancredi. On January 6, 2011, Parton announced that her new album would be titled _Better Day_. In February 2011, she announced that she would embark on the Better Day World Tour on July 17, 2011, with shows in northern Europe and the U.S.[48] The album's lead-off single, "Together You and I", was released on May 23, 2011, and _Better Day_ was released on June 28, 2011.[49] In 2011, Parton voiced the character Dolly Gnome in the animated film _Gnomeo & Juliet_.

On February 11, 2012, after the sudden death of Whitney Houston, Dolly Parton stated, "Mine is only one of the millions of hearts broken over the death of Whitney Houston. I will always be grateful and in awe of the wonderful performance she did on my song, and I can truly say from the bottom of my heart, 'Whitney, I will always love you. You will be missed.'"[50] In 2013, Parton joined Lulu Roman for a re-recording of "I Will Always Love You" for Roman's album, _At Last_.[51] In 2013, Parton and Kenny Rogers reunited for the title song of his album _You Can't Make Old Friends._ For their performance, they were nominated at the 2014 Grammy Awards for Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance.[52]

In 2014, Parton embarked on the Blue Smoke World Tour in support of her 42nd studio album, _Blue Smoke_.[53] The album was first released in Australia & New Zealand on January 31 to coincide with tour dates there in February, and reached the top 10 in both countries. It was released in the United States on May 13, and debuted at number six on the _Billboard_ 200 chart, making it her first top-10 album and her highest-charting solo album ever; it also reached the number two on the U.S. country chart. The album was released in Europe on June 9, and reached number two on the UK album chart. On June 29, 2014, Parton performed for the first time at the UK Glastonbury Festival performing songs such as "Jolene", "9 to 5" and "Coat of Many Colors" to a crowd of more than 180,000.[54]

On March 6, 2016, Parton announced that she would be embarking on a tour in support of her new album, _Pure & Simple_. The tour was one of Parton's biggest tours within the United States in more than 25 years.[55] Sixty-four dates were planned in the United States and Canada, visiting the most requested markets missed on previous tours.[56] In the fall of 2016, she also released "Jolene" as a single with the _a cappella_ group Pentatonix[57] and performed on _The Voice_ with Pentatonix and Miley Cyrus in November 2016.[58]

Also in 2016, Parton was one of 30 artists to perform on "Forever Country", a mash-up of the songs, "Take Me Home, Country Roads", "On the Road Again" and her own "I Will Always Love You". The song celebrates 50 years of the CMA Awards.[59] At the ceremony itself, Parton was honored with the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award, which was presented by Lily Tomlin and preceded by a tribute featuring Jennifer Nettles, Pentatonix, Reba McEntire, Kacey Musgraves, Carrie Underwood and Martina McBride. In 2017, Parton appeared on _Rainbow_, the third studio album by Kesha performing a duet of "Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You". The track had been written by Kesha's mother Pebe Sebert. It was previously a hit for Parton and was included on her 1980 album _Dolly, Dolly, Dolly_. She also co-wrote and provided featuring vocals on the song "Rainbowland" on _Younger Now_, the sixth album by her goddaughter Miley Cyrus.

On June 25, 2019, _The New York Times Magazine_ listed Parton as one of the hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[60]


Other work

In 1998, _Nashville Business_ ranked her the wealthiest country-music star.[61] , her net worth is estimated at $500 million.[62] She was also on _The Love Boat_ in 1977, a short cameo in episode 13 as the boat captain's silent wife.

Songwriting

Parton is a prolific songwriter, having begun by writing country-music songs with strong elements of folk music, based on her upbringing in humble mountain surroundings and reflecting her family's Christian background. Her songs "Coat of Many Colors", "I Will Always Love You", and "Jolene", among others, have become classics. On November 4, 2003, Parton was honored as a BMI Icon at the 2003 BMI Country Awards.[63] Parton has earned over 35 BMI Pop and Country Awards.[64] In 2001, she was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.[65] In a 2009 interview on CNN's _Larry King Live_, she said she had written "at least 3,000" songs, having written seriously since the age of seven. Parton also said she writes something every day, be it a song or an idea.[66]

Parton's songwriting has been featured prominently in several films. In addition to the title song for _9 to 5,_ she also recorded a second version of "I Will Always Love You" for _The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas_ (1982). The second version was a number one country hit and also reached number 53 on the pop charts. "I Will Always Love You" has been covered by many country artists, including Ronstadt on _Prisoner In Disguise_ (1975), Kenny Rogers on _Vote for Love_ (1996), and LeAnn Rimes on _Unchained Melody: The Early Years_ (1997). Whitney Houston performed it on _The Bodyguard_ soundtrack and her version became the best-selling hit both written and performed by a female vocalist, with worldwide sales of over 12 million copies. In addition, the song has been translated into Italian and performed by the Welsh opera singer Katherine Jenkins.

As a songwriter, Parton has twice been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, for "9 to 5" and "Travelin' Thru" (2005) from the transgender-themed film _Transamerica_. "Travelin' Thru" won Best Original Song at the 2005 Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards. It was also nominated for both the 2005 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and the 2005 Broadcast Film Critics Association Award (also known as the Critics' Choice Awards) for Best Song. A cover of "Love Is Like A Butterfly" by Clare Torry was used as the theme music for the British TV show _Butterflies_.[67]

_9 to 5: The Musical_

Parton wrote the score (and Patricia Resnick the book) for _9 to 5: The Musical_, a musical-theater adaptation of Parton's feature film _9 to 5_ (1980). The musical ran at the Ahmanson Theatre, Los Angeles in late 2008. It opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre in New York City, on April 30, 2009, to mixed reviews.[68] The title track of her 2008 album _Backwoods Barbie_ was written for the musical's character Doralee.[69] Although her score (as well as the musical debut of actress Allison Janney) were praised, the show struggled, closing on September 6, 2009, after 24 previews and 148 performances. Parton received nominations for Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Music and Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics, as well as a nomination for Tony Award for Best Original Score. Developing the musical was not a quick process. According to the public-radio program _Studio 360_ (October 29, 2005),[70] in October 2005 Parton was in the midst of composing the songs for a Broadway musical theater adaptation of the film. In late June 2007, _9 to 5: The Musical_ was read for industry presentations. The readings starred Megan Hilty, Allison Janney, Stephanie J. Block, Bebe Neuwirth, and Marc Kudisch.[71] Ambassador Theatre Group announced a 2012 UK tour for _Dolly Parton's 9 to 5: The Musical_, commencing at Manchester Opera House, on October 12, 2012.[72]

The Dollywood Company

Dollywoodsign1.jpg Parton invested much of her earnings into business ventures in her native East Tennessee, notably Pigeon Forge. She is a co-owner of The Dollywood Company, which operates the theme park Dollywood (a former Silver Dollar City), a dinner theater, Dolly Parton's Stampede, the waterpark Dollywood's Splash Country, and the Dream More Resort and Spa, all in Pigeon Forge. Dollywood is the 24th-most-popular theme park in the United States, with 3 million visitors per year.[73] The Dolly Parton's Stampede business has venues in Branson, Missouri, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. A former location in Orlando, Florida, closed in January 2008 after the land and building were sold to a developer.[74] Starting in June 2011, the Myrtle Beach location became Pirates Voyage Fun, Feast and Adventure; Parton appeared for the opening, and the South Carolina General Assembly declared June 3, 2011, as Dolly Parton Day.[75]

On January 19, 2012, Parton's 66th birthday, Gaylord Opryland and Dollywood announced plans to open a $50 million water and snow park, a family-friendly destination in Nashville that is open all year.[76] On September 29, 2012, Parton officially withdrew her support for the Nashville park due to the restructuring of Gaylord Entertainment Company after its merger with Marriott International.[77] On June 12, 2015, it was announced that the Dollywood Company had purchased the Lumberjack Feud Dinner Show in Pigeon Forge. The show, which opened in June 2011, was owned and operated by Rob Scheer until the close of the 2015 season. The new, renovated show by the Dollywood Company opened in 2016.[78]

Production work

Parton was a co-owner of Sandollar Productions, with Sandy Gallin, her former manager. A film and television production company, it produced the documentary _Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt_ (1989), which won an Academy Award for Best Documentary (Feature); the television series _Babes_ (1990–91) and _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ (1997–2003); and the feature films _Father of the Bride_ (1991), _Father of the Bride: Part II_ (1995) _Straight Talk_ (1992) (in which Parton starred), and _Sabrina_ (1995), among other shows. In a 2009 interview, singer Connie Francis revealed that Dolly had been contacting her for years in an attempt to film the singer's life story. Francis turned down Parton's offers, as she was already in negotiations with singer Gloria Estefan to produce the film, a collaboration now ended.[79] After the retirement of her partner, Sandy Gallin, Parton briefly operated Dolly Parton's Southern Light Productions and in 2015 she announced her new production company would be called Dixie Pixie Productions and produce the movies-of-week in development with NBC Television and Magnolia Hill Productions.[80]


Acting career

Acting breakthrough

In addition to her performing appearances on _The Porter Wagoner Show_ in the 1960s and into the 1970s, her two self-titled television variety shows in the 1970s and 1980s, and on _American Idol_ in 2008 and other guest appearances, Parton has had television roles. In 1979, she received an Emmy award nomination as "Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Variety Program" for her guest appearance in a Cher special.[81] During the mid-1970s, Parton wanted to expand her audience base. Although her first attempt, the television variety show _Dolly!_ (1976–77), had high ratings, it only lasted one season, with Parton requesting to be released from her contract because of the stress it was causing on her vocal cords (she later tried a second television variety show, also titled _Dolly_ (1987–88); likewise, it too only lasted one season).

In her first feature film, Parton portrayed a secretary in a leading role with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin in the comedy film _9 to 5_ (1980). The movie highlights the discrimination of women in a working environment and created awareness of the National Association of Working Women (9-5). She received nominations for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and a Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress.[82][83] Parton wrote and recorded the film's title song. It received nominations for an Academy Award for Best Song and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.[84] Released as a single, the song won both the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance and the Grammy Award for Best Country Song. It also reached No. 1 on the Hot 100 chart and it was No. 78 on the "AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs" list released by the American Film Institute in 2004. _9 to 5_ became a major box office success, grossing over $3.9 million its opening weekend, and over $103 million worldwide. Parton was named Top Female Box Office Star by the _Motion Picture Herald_ in both 1981 and 1982 due to the film's success.[85]

In late 1981, Parton began filming her second film, the musical film _The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas_ (1982).[86] The film earned her a second nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.[87] The film was greeted with positive critical reviews and became a commercial success, earning over $69 million worldwide. After a two-year hiatus from films, Parton was teamed with Sylvester Stallone for _Rhinestone_ (1984). A comedy film about a country music star's efforts to mould an unknown into a music sensation, the film was a critical and financial failure, making just over $21 million on a $28 million budget.

Continued roles

In 1989, she returned to film acting in _Steel Magnolias_ (1989), based on the play of the same name by Robert Harling. The film was popular with critics and audiences, grossing over $95 million inside the U.S. She starred in the television movies _A Smoky Mountain Christmas_ (1986); _Wild Texas Wind_ (1991); _Unlikely Angel_ (1996), portraying an angel sent back to earth following a deadly car crash; and _Blue Valley Songbird_ (1999), where her character lives through her music. Parton starred along with James Woods in _Straight Talk_ (1992), which received mixed reviews, and grossed a mild $21 million at the box office.[88]

She launched a television series, _The Dolly Show,_ but it was not a success. Parton made a cameo appearance as herself in _The Beverly Hillbillies_ (1993), an adaptation of the long-running TV sitcom of the same name (1962–71).[89] Parton has done voice work for animation for television series, playing herself in _Alvin and the Chipmunks_ (episode "Urban Chipmunk", 1983) and the character Katrina Eloise "Murph" Murphy (Ms. Frizzle's first cousin) in _The Magic School Bus_ (episode "The Family Holiday Special", 1994). She also has guest-starred in several sitcoms, including a 1990 episode of _Designing Women_ (episode "The First Day of the Last Decade of the Entire Twentieth Century") as herself, the guardian movie star of Charlene's baby.[90] She made a guest appearance on _Reba_ (episode "Reba's Rules of Real Estate") portraying a real-estate agency owner and on _The Simpsons_ (episode "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday", 1999). She appeared as herself in 2000 on the Halloween episode of Bette Midler's short-lived sitcom _Bette,_ and on episode 14 of _Babes,_ (which was produced by Sandollar Productions, Parton and Sandy Gallin's joint production company). She made cameo appearances on the Disney Channel as "Aunt Dolly", visiting Hannah and her family in the fellow Tennessean, and real-life goddaughter, Miley Cyrus's series _Hannah Montana_ (episodes "Good Golly, Miss Dolly", 2006, "I Will Always Loathe You", 2007 and "Kiss It All Goodbye", 2010). She was nominated for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.[91]

She appeared as an overprotective mother in the comedy _Frank McKlusky, C.I._. (2002) She made a cameo appearance in the comedy film _Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous_, starring Sandra Bullock. She was featured in _The Book Lady_, (2008) a documentary film about her campaign for children's literacy. Parton had expected to reprise her television role as Hannah's godmother in the musical comedy film _Hannah Montana: The Movie_ (2009), but the character was omitted from the final screenplay.[92] She had a voice role in the comedy family film _Gnomeo & Juliet_ (2011), a computer-animated film with garden gnomes about William Shakespeare's _Romeo and Juliet_.

Recent work

_Dolly Parton's Coat of Many Colors_, a made-for-TV film based on Parton's song of the same name, and featuring narration by Parton, aired on NBC in December 2015, with child actress Alyvia Alyn Lind portraying the young Parton. Parton also had a cameo in the sequel, which aired in November 2016.[93] She co-starred with Queen Latifah in the musical film _Joyful Noise_ (2012), which finished filming in April 2011.[94] She played a choir director's widow who joins forces with Latifah's character, a mother of two teens, to save a small Georgia town's gospel choir.[95] The film was released in theaters on January 13, 2012.[96]

In June 2018, Parton announced an eight-part Netflix series, featuring her music career.[97][98] Parton is playing as singer, songwriter, executive producer and co-star in the series.[99]


Personal life

Family

On May 30, 1966, Parton and Carl Thomas Dean (born , in Nashville, Tennessee) were married in Ringgold, Georgia.[100][101] Although Parton does not use Dean's surname professionally, she has stated that her passport says "Dolly Parton Dean" and that she sometimes uses Dean when signing contracts.[102] Dean, who is retired from running an asphalt road-paving business in Nashville, has always shunned publicity and rarely accompanies his wife to any events. According to Parton, he has seen her perform only once. She also has said in interviews that, although it appears they spend little time together, it is simply that nobody sees him publicly. She has commented on Dean's romantic side, saying that he does spontaneous things to surprise her and sometimes even writes poems for her. In 2011 Parton said, "We're really proud of our marriage. It's the first for both of us. And the last."[103] On May 6, 2016, Parton announced that she and her husband would renew their vows in honor of their 50th wedding anniversary later in the month.[104]

Parton and Dean helped raise several of Parton's younger siblings in Nashville, leading her nieces and nephews to refer to her as "Aunt Granny," a moniker that later lent its name to one of Parton's Dollywood restaurants. The couple have no children of their own, but Parton is the godmother of performer Miley Cyrus.[105]

Public image

Parton has turned down several offers to pose nude for _Playboy_ magazine, but did appear on the cover of the October 1978 issue wearing a Playboy bunny outfit, complete with ears (the issue featured Lawrence Grobel's extensive and candid interview with Parton, representing one of her earliest high-profile interviews with the mainstream press). The association of breasts with Parton's public image is illustrated in the naming of Dolly the sheep after her, since the sheep was cloned from a cell taken from an adult ewe's mammary gland.[106][107] In Mobile, Alabama, the General W.K. Wilson Jr. Bridge is commonly called "the Dolly Parton Bridge" due to its arches resembling her chest.[108] The Hernando de Soto Bridge over the Mississippi River at Memphis is also sometimes called this for the same reason.[109]

Parton is known for having undergone considerable plastic surgery.[110][111] On a 2003 episode of _The Oprah Winfrey Show_, Winfrey asked what kind of cosmetic surgery Parton had undergone, Parton replied that cosmetic surgery was imperative in keeping with her famous image. Parton has repeatedly joked about her physical image and surgeries, saying, "It takes a lot of money to look this cheap."[112] Her breasts have garnered her mentions in several songs, including "Dolly Parton's Hits" by Bobby Braddock, "Marty Feldman Eyes" by Bruce Baum (a parody of "Bette Davis Eyes"), "No Show Jones" by George Jones and Merle Haggard, and "Make Me Proud" by Drake ft. Nicki Minaj. When asked about future plastic surgeries, she famously said, "If I see something sagging, bagging or dragging, I'll get it nipped, tucked or sucked."[113] Parton's feminine escapism is acknowledged in her words, "Womanhood was a difficult thing to get a grip on in those hills, unless you were a man."[114]

Philanthropy

Since the mid-1980s, Parton has supported many charitable efforts, particularly in the area of literacy, primarily through her Dollywood Foundation. Her literacy program, Dolly Parton's Imagination Library,[115] a part of the Dollywood Foundation, mails one book per month to each enrolled child from the time of their birth until they enter kindergarten. Currently, over 1600 local communities provide the Imagination Library to almost 850,000 children each month across the U.S., Canada, the UK, Australia, and the Republic of Ireland.[116] In 2018, Parton was honored by the Library of Congress on account of the "charity sending out its 100 millionth book".[117] In 2006, Parton published a cookbook, _Dolly's Dixie Fixin's: Love, Laughter and Lots of Good Food_.[118][119]

The Dollywood Foundation, funded from Parton's profits, has been noted for bringing jobs and tax revenues to a previously depressed region. Parton also has worked to raise money for several other causes, including the American Red Cross and HIV/AIDS-related charities.[120] In December 2006, Parton pledged $500,000 toward a proposed $90-million hospital and cancer center to be constructed in Sevierville in the name of Dr. Robert F. Thomas, the physician who delivered her. She announced a benefit concert to raise additional funds for the project. The concert played to about 8,000 people.[121] That same year, Emmylou Harris and she had allowed their music to be used in a PETA ad campaign that encouraged pet owners to keep their dogs indoors rather than chained outside.[122]

In 2003, her efforts to preserve the bald eagle through the American Eagle Foundation's sanctuary at Dollywood earned her the Partnership Award from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.[123] Parton received the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian Institution at a ceremony in Nashville on November 8, 2007.[124] In February 2018, she donated her 100 millionth free book, a copy of Parton's children's picture book "Coat of Many Colors". It was donated to the Library of Congress in Washington D.C.[125]

For her work in literacy, Parton has received various awards, including: Association of American Publishers Honors Award (2000), Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval (2001) (the first time the seal had been awarded to a person), American Association of School Administrators – Galaxy Award (2002), National State Teachers of the Year – Chasing Rainbows Award (2002), and Parents as Teachers National Center – Child and Family Advocacy Award (2003).

On May 8, 2009, Parton gave the commencement speech at the graduation ceremony for the University of Tennessee, Knoxville's College of Arts and Sciences.[126] During the ceremony, she received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the university. It was only the second honorary degree given by the university, and in presenting the degree, the university's Chancellor, Jimmy G. Cheek, said, "Because of her career not just as a musician and entertainer, but for her role as a cultural ambassador, philanthropist and lifelong advocate for education, it is fitting that she be honored with an honorary degree from the flagship educational institution of her home state."[127]

In response to the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires, Parton was one of a number of country music artists who participated in a telethon to raise money for victims of the fires.[128] This was held in Nashville on December 9. In addition, Parton hosted her own telethon for the victims on December 13[129] and reportedly raised around $9 million.[130]
