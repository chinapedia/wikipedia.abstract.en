The KYL–BINGAMAN AMENDMENT (Public Law 104-201, Section 1064) is a United States law. It was put into force by the Military Defense National Defense Authorization Act for 1997.

This provision prohibits US authorities from granting a license for collecting or disseminating high resolution satellite imagery of Israel at a higher resolution than available from other commercial sources (i.e. companies outside of the United States), unless this is done by a US federal agency, or if it is done in order to abolish the secrecy of such recordings.

The amendment is named after United States Senators Jon Kyl and Jeff Bingaman.

In August 2017 the Advisory Committee on Commercial Remote Sensing (ACCRES), part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) which regulates the Kyl–Bingaman Amendment restrictions, announced a review of the current imagery resolution limit of 2m Ground Sampling Distance (GSD). This was done in response to evidence that commercial satellite companies outside the United States were selling imagery below that limit.[1] Imagery of higher resolution that the 2m GSD limitation has been commercially available from companies outside of the United States since 2012.[2]
