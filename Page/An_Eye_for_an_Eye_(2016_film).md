Plot

In the weeks following the September 11 attacks, dozens of attacks against Muslims, Sikhs and other minorities were reported across America. Among the perpetrators was Mark Anthony Stroman, who began "hunting Arabs," as he described his nightly prowling. His target was on people whom he believed were Muslim who came from the Middle East. He killed two and partially blinded a young man—all immigrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and India. Luckily, he was arrested before he fell through with his plan to massacre dozens of Muslim worshipers at a local Dallas Mosque. On April 5, 2002, Stroman was convicted and sentenced to Death.

In the weeks before in impending execution, his only surviving victim became his biggest advocate – Rais Bhuiyan, a devout and recently half-blind Muslim. He began a campaign to spare Mark's life in the name of Islam and its notion of mercy, becoming one of the most vocal campaigners against Stroman's execution.

The Press at the time labeled this as the first post 9/11 hate crimes and even Stroman himself stated that "blinded by rage", he killed to avenge the United States of America.[1]

With in-depth interviews, the film follows Stroman's story through to his execution. Central to the film is the bond that developed between Stroman and the Israeli-born filmmaker Ilan Ziv.


Reviews

The film has received a 67% approval rating from qualified reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.[2] Film Journal International states, "_An Eye for an Eye_, tough to take as it is -- with nigh unbearable-to-listen-to audiotapes of the murder being committed -- turns out to be one of the most searinlgy honest and moving depictions of redemption and the power of forgiveness ever made.[3] The Hollywood Reporter says, "as our encounters with him continue, it becomes clearer that Stroman -- whose early life is nearly guaranteed problems ahead -- evolved dramatically behind bars, and that his remorse for his crimes is sincere".[4] The Los Angeles Times says, "the rehabilitative power of forgiveness [throughout the film] is thought-provokingly explored".[5] The Globe and Mail from Toronto says it was "a well-layered film" that makes "a fascinating case for forgiveness and a sharp rebuke of Bible-taught eye-for-an-eye revenge".[6]
