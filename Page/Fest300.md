FEST300 is a San Francisco-based company that produces an online festival magazine and annual list of the 300 best festivals in the world, curated by Chip Conley (Airbnb, Joie de Vivre Hotels) and team.[1] Fest300 members pledge to attend at least one festival per year.[2]

In addition to editorial content, the site hosts video and photo galleries from festivals around the world.


History

Fest300 was founded by Conley and Art Gimbel in early 2013.[3]

In November 2014, Fest300 updated its selection process, with the internal team curating 270 of the 300 festivals while the other 30 are crowdsourced from the festival community.[4]

In September 2016, Fest300 was acquired by Everfest. The combined entity continues to produce the Fest300 list.[5]
