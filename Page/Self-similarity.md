In mathematics, a SELF-SIMILAR object is exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself (i.e. the whole has the same shape as one or more of the parts). Many objects in the real world, such as coastlines, are statistically self-similar: parts of them show the same statistical properties at many scales.[1] Self-similarity is a typical property of artificial fractals. Scale invariance is an exact form of self-similarity where at any magnification there is a smaller piece of the object that is similar to the whole. For instance, a side of the Koch snowflake is both symmetrical and scale-invariant; it can be continually magnified 3x without changing shape. The non-trivial similarity evident in fractals is distinguished by their fine structure, or detail on arbitrarily small scales. As a counterexample, whereas any portion of a straight line may resemble the whole, further detail is not revealed.

A time developing phenomenon is said to exhibit self-similarity if the numerical value of certain observable quantity f(x,‚ÄÜt) measured at different times are different but the corresponding dimensionless quantity at given value of x/t^(z) remain invariant. It happens if the quantity f(x,‚ÄÜt) exhibits dynamic scaling. The idea is just an extension of the idea of similarity of two triangles.[2][3][4] Note that two triangles are similar if the numerical values of their sides are different however the corresponding dimensionless quantities, such as their angles, coincide.


Self-affinity

In mathematics, SELF-AFFINITY is a feature of a fractal whose pieces are scaled by different amounts in the x- and y-directions. This means that to appreciate the self similarity of these fractal objects, they have to be rescaled using an anisotropic affine transformation.


Definition

A compact topological space _X_ is self-similar if there exists a finite set _S_ indexing a set of non-surjective homeomorphisms {f_(s)‚ÄÑ:‚ÄÑs‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑS} for which

_X_‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ‚ãÉ_(_s_‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑ_S_)_f__(_s_)(_X_)

If X‚ÄÑ‚äÇ‚ÄÑY, we call _X_ self-similar if it is the only non-empty subset of _Y_ such that the equation above holds for {f_(s)‚ÄÑ:‚ÄÑs‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑS}. We call

ùîè‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ(_X_,‚ÄÜ_S_,‚ÄÜ{_f__(_s_)‚ÄÑ:‚ÄÑ_s_‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑ_S_})

a _self-similar structure_. The homeomorphisms may be iterated, resulting in an iterated function system. The composition of functions creates the algebraic structure of a monoid. When the set _S_ has only two elements, the monoid is known as the dyadic monoid. The dyadic monoid can be visualized as an infinite binary tree; more generally, if the set _S_ has _p_ elements, then the monoid may be represented as a p-adic tree.

The automorphisms of the dyadic monoid is the modular group; the automorphisms can be pictured as hyperbolic rotations of the binary tree.

A more general notion than self-similarity is Self-affinity.

The Mandelbrot set is also self-similar around Misiurewicz points.

Self-similarity has important consequences for the design of computer networks, as typical network traffic has self-similar properties. For example, in teletraffic engineering, packet switched data traffic patterns seem to be statistically self-similar.[5] This property means that simple models using a Poisson distribution are inaccurate, and networks designed without taking self-similarity into account are likely to function in unexpected ways.

Similarly, stock market movements are described as displaying self-affinity, i.e. they appear self-similar when transformed via an appropriate affine transformation for the level of detail being shown.[6] Andrew Lo describes stock market log return self-similarity in econometrics.[7]

Finite subdivision rules are a powerful technique for building self-similar sets, including the Cantor set and the Sierpinski triangle.

In cybernetics

The Viable System Model of Stafford Beer is an organizational model with an affine self-similar hierarchy, where a given viable system is one element of the System One of a viable system one recursive level higher up, and for whom the elements of its System One are viable systems one recursive level lower down.

In nature

Flickr_-_cyclonebill_-_Romanesco.jpg.]] Self-similarity can be found in nature, as well. To the right is a mathematically generated, perfectly self-similar image of a fern, which bears a marked resemblance to natural ferns. Other plants, such as Romanesco broccoli, exhibit strong self-similarity.

In music

-   Strict canons display various types and amounts of self-similarity, as do sections of fugues.
-   A Shepard tone is self-similar in the frequency or wavelength domains.
-   The Danish composer Per N√∏rg√•rd has made use of a self-similar integer sequence named the 'infinity series' in much of his music.
-   In the research field of music information retrieval, self-similarity commonly refers to the fact that music often consists of parts that are repeated in time.[8] In other words, music is self-similar under temporal translation, rather than (or in addition to) under scaling.[9]
