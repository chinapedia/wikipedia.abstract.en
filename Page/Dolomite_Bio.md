DOLOMITE BIO, headquartered in Royston, Hertfordshire, UK creates innovative products for high throughput single cell research for biologists.[1] Dolomite Bio is based out of five global offices including the UK (headquarters) and regional offices in the USA, Japan, India and Brazil. [2]

Dolomite Bio is part of the Blacktrace Holdings ltd.[3]


History

Dolomite Bio was founded in March 2016, from its sister company Dolomite Microfluidics (part of the Blacktrace group of companies).[4] Dolomite Bio now serves all of Dolomite Microfluidics' biology customers and develops new innovative products specifically for biologists. [5]


Products

Dolomite Bio designs and manufactures innovative products for high throughput single cell research including the RNA-Seq system [6] and the µEncapsulator System.[7]

The RNA-Seq system enables rapid, reproducible droplet encapsulation of individual cells, allowing up to 10,000 single cell libraries to be generated in one 15-minute run. [8]

The products are suitable for applications including profiling T-cell receptors, isolating antibody coding sequences, droplets for FACS-sorting libraries, encapsulating cells in gel microbeads and single cell RNA-Seq. [9]


Technology

Dolomite Bio systems employ the principle of microfluidic flow technology focussing to rapidly encapsulate single cells in millions of aqueous droplets in oil. The droplets are identically sized and, depending on the application, may be 10 – 100 µm in diameter (optionally with beads and reagents).[10]
