CHRISTINA GABBITAS (born 7 December 1967) is an English children's author, poet, storyteller and voiceover artist. She is best known for her rhyming books.

Gabbitas grew up in Blackburn, Lancashire before moving to Yorkshire as a young adult. Growing up she loved to read poetry and rhymes. She started writing after having her own children and particularly focussed on stories which would help them overcome their fears and fears that she had, had as a child.


Career

Felicity Fly Series

In 2012 Gabbitas published her first book _Welcome To The World Of Felicity Fly_.[1][2] It uses characters such as a washing machine and a woodlouse to talk about fears children may have in the home. They are encouraged to not feel alone and that having fears is normal. This was quickly followed by _Felicity Fly Meets Veronica Vac_. Whilst still tackling the subject of childhood fears, this book also focuses on individuals caring and helping one another. A year later _Felicity Fly In The Garden_ was published this time addressing the subject of pollination. It was well received. The fourth book in the series _Felicity Fly Meets the Dragon Fruit and Friends_ came out in early 2015 and takes as its main theme healthy food.[3]

Other publications for children

Gabbitas published a book called _Share Some Secrets_ in November 2014, which highlights the difference between good and troublesome secrets, and encourages children who are being abused to speak out. It is aimed at five to eight year olds. The book was endorsed by the NSPCC, placed in their library and distributed through their school service.[4] A percentage of sales from the book go to Barnardo's in their 15th anniversary year for 2016.[5] The book was endorsed by Barnardo's,[6] and also a finalist in the People's Book Prize 2016.[7]

In October 2017 the book was animated by students from Sheffield Hallam University.[8] The launch was covered by the Guardian [9] and Gabbitas was interviewed by Radio 5 Live about the book and animation.[10] In October 2018 Gabbitas was made an Honorary Member of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) Council for her dedication to child protection and her fundraising efforts on behalf of the children’s charity.[11]

_Triangular Trev and the Shape Idols_, published in October 2016, is a picture rhyming book that teaches children about mathematical terminology with fun. Gabbitas was interviewed on BBC Radio shortly after the launch of this book and it has been well received, including being a finalist in the People's Book Prize, the third year in a row Gabbitas has had a book in the final.[12][13]

Poetry

Poetry has always been important to Gabbitas. 2013 saw her launch a new eight live rhyme initiative, which had the backing of the then education secretary Michael Gove.[14] The initiative takes the form of a yearly competition with children of primary school age encouraged to write poems on a particular topic, which are then judged by a panel of judges that includes the former Ambassador and the official Entrepreneur in Residence at The Business & Intellectual Property Centre at The British Library Dr Stephen Fear.[15] The best poems are published in a book in the autumn of each year. Topics have included teamwork and friendship, healthy eating and music. Gabbitas also met Fear on World Book Day 2015, where she was interviewed at the British Library about her books.[16]

In both 2015 and 2016 Gabbitas was invited to attend the Sharjah Children's Reading Festival in the United Arab Emirates where she held storytelling and poetry workshops, and promoted the eight line rhyme initiative.[17][18]


Awards

_Felicity Fly meets Veronica Vac_ was voted into the final of the People's Book Prize 2014. The second volume of poetry published from the eight line rhyme initiative in September 2014 gained Gabbitas the Dame Beryl Bainbridge First Time Author Award at The People's Book Prize at a ceremony in London in 2015.[19][20] The book takes creatures and food as its themes.

In 2016 Gabbitas received the Sue Ryder Yorkshire Women of Achievement award in education for encouraging and making an impact educating children through her work.[21]

Gabbitas received a further award in May 2019 when her book _Share Some Secrets_ won the Best Achievement category in the People’s Book Prize.[22][23]
