Reception

A review of _The Boys' War_ by _Booklist_ wrote "Except for his overuse of the exclamation point, Murphy's style is nonhistrionic; he allows the drama to come from the boys' words and from the sepia pictures, which evoke the stills in the recent PBS series on the war and are sure to lure browsers of all ages."[1] and _School Library Journal_ called it an "informative, moving work."[2]

_Kirkus Reviews_ found it "Undistinguished writing, but useful."[3] while The Cooperative Children's Book Center called it "an intriguing history of the Civil War".[4]

_Publishers Weekly_ wrote "Handsomely produced, the book does not shrink from presenting the stark images of youngsters killed or mutilated in battle. The extensive use of contemporary archival photos reinforces the power of the understated text."[5]
