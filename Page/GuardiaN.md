Professional career

Before the release of _Counter-Strike :_ _Global Offensive_ in 2012, the Slovak played both _CS_ and _CS:S_ professionally. He was first introduced to _Counter-Strike_ by his brother, who bought the game on a CD when it was not well known at the time.

He liked the game, so he kept playing it and developing as a player and some time later he found himself a team and took part in his first LAN tournaments. Due to the low number of _CS_ events at his home soil, he decided to switch onto _CS:S_. He had been playing for the ranks of Reason Gaming for two years. This led him to a lot of victories while playing _CS:S_. Despite having been offered a spot from a number of top European teams, GuardiaN switched back to _CS_ and started playing for such squads as IQFIGHTERS, DEFEATERS, Corecell, and SGC as well as for his national team, Slovakia. In addition, he was frequently honored with a number of different awards (both as a team member and as a player).

GuardiaN moved on to _CS:GO_ in the middle of 2012. He played for myDGB.net, ePz, TCM-Gaming and 3DMAX before playing well in the Virtus.pro roster. He joined the ranks of Natus Vincere in December 2013. After a 4-year long tenure with Natus Vincere, he left the organisation in August 2017[3] and now plays for FaZe Clan as the AWPer, taking over from Aleksi "allu" Jalli - one of the most accomplished Finnish players in _CS:GO_.[4]
