The BRITISH COLUMBIA ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF 2015 was a process undertaken by the BC Electoral Boundaries Commission starting in 2014 and formalized by the passing of Bill 42 - 2015 Electoral Districts Act during the 40th Parliament. The redistribution added two seats onto the previous total, raising the number of MLAs from 85 to 87. The electoral boundaries came into effect for the 2017 election.
