_EOPERIPATUS BUTLERI_ is a Malaysian species of velvet worm in the Peripatidae family.[1]


Taxonomy

_Eoperipatus butleri_ was described by Richard Evans in 1901, from a single female specimen discovered by A. M. Butler in the Larut Hills of West Malaysia. The generic name _Eoperipatus_ is derived from an Ancient Greek combining form of _ēṓs_, meaning "dawn", and _peripatos_, meaning "walking about". The specific name _butleri_ is in honour of its discoverer.[2]


Description

The dorsal surface is brown with a darker brown mid-dorsal line extending from the first pair of oncopods to the anus. The ventral surface is slightly lighter brown than the dorsal surface. There are 24 pairs of oncopods. The type specimen was 52 mm in length, and 6 mm in width.[3]
