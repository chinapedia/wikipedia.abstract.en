A LIFE COMPANY (, but usually written in its definite form; _Livkompaniet_) is the first company of a regiment in the Swedish Army. Before the 17th century, the term "life company" referred to the company of which the regimental commander directly controlled.[1]

The Life Guards regiment consists, in part, of a life company. The 130-man company's official name is _Livkompaniet_ and is tasked with ceremonial and guard duties at the Swedish royal residences. Additionally, men from the company staff the IBSS unit of the Life Guards, which defends the Cavalry Barracks (_Kavallerikasern)._[2]
