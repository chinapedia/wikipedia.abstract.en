_SKELETOCUTIS BREVISPORA_ is a species of poroid crust fungus in the family Polyporaceae. It was described as new to science in 1998 by Finnish mycologist Tuomo Niemelä.[1]


Description

The fruit bodies of this fungus are crust-like with a waxy texture. Its dimensions are usually small, with a thickness of up to 2 mm, and a length typically no more than . The pore surface is cream-white when fresh, but dries to a pale yellow or pale orange colour. The pores are tiny and angular, usually numbering 6–8 per mm.[2]

The fungus has a dimitic hyphal system, meaning that it contains both generative and skeletal hyphae. Typical of the genus _Skeletocutis_, the generative hyphae of _S. brevispora_ are encrusted with spiny crystals on the dissepiments (the tissue between the pores). Spores are cylindrical to somewhat sausage-shaped (allantoid), and measure 3–4 by 1–1.5 μm.[3]


Habitat and distribution

_Skeletocutis brevispora_ has usually been recorded from Fennoscandia where it grows on dead fruit bodies of the polypore fungus _Phellinidium ferrugineofuscum_. Rarely, it is found growing on dead spruce wood that has been rotted by this fungus.[4] _S. brevispora_ has also been found in northeast China,[5] and in the Ukraine.[6]
