MOHAMMAD-QOLI KHAN or MOHAMMAD-QOLI KHAN B. LALEH BEG (fl. 17th-century), was a Safavid official who served as the governor (_beglarbeg_) of the Erivan Province (also known as Chokhur-e Sa'd) in 1654–1656, succeeding the Circassian Kay Khosrow Khan Cherkes to this post. According to Prof. Rudi Matthee, during the "scheming" of incumbent grand vizier Mohammad Beg (1654–1666), by which the latter managed to get rid of his adversaries, Mohammad-Qoli Khan was probably also one of those officials who lost their job.
