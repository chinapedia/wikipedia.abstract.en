MEHRSA BARADARAN is a law professor specializing in banking law at the University of Georgia. Her book _How the Other Half Banks_ has received national and international media coverage.


Life

Baradaran was born in Orumieh, Iran, in 1978 and immigrated to the United States with her family in 1986. She earned her bachelor's degree cum laude from Brigham Young University and her law degree cum laude from New York University.[1] She served as a member of the New York University Law Review. She was an Academic Research Fellow at the New York University School of Law. She joined the law faculty at the University of Georgia in 2012 and is the J. Alton Hosch Associate Professor, teaching contracts and banking law.[2] Prior to that position, she taught banking regulation, property, and administrative law at Brigham Young University's J. Reuben Clark Law School.[3] Baradaran practised law in the Davis, Polk & Wardwell financial institutions group in New York City.[4] She served a Spanish-speaking mission in Houston, Texas, for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[5] The _Huffington Post_ described her as one of "a powerful cohort of Mormon women of color scholar-activists... who are powerful critics of racism, colonialism, and economic exploitation".[6]

She spoke about her experience as a refugee from Iran in _Slate_ in January 2017. She pointed out that she was one of the "immigrants and refugees from 'terrorist countries' that soon will be banned by executive order from coming [to America]". She concluded: "The irony for me is that it was Iran's tribalism and nationalism that put my family out in the first place. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime had said 'Iran First', too. They silenced the press, kicked out all the 'others', and ran the liberal intellectuals out of the country. I hope that's not what happens here. But even if it does, this is my home and I will keep working to make America great because I have so much hope in America".[7]


Books

Both Baradaran[8][9] and her book _How the Other Half Banks: Exclusion, Exploitation, and the Threat to Democracy_ ()[10] have received national and international media coverage, the book having been featured in the _New York Times_,[11] the _Atlantic_,[12] the _Financial Times_,[13] the _Irish Examiner_,[14] National Public Radio's _Marketplace_,[15] C-SPAN's _Washington Journal_,[16] and TEDxUGA.[17] In the book, she proposes postal banking, an idea that was endorsed by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.[18][19][20] She gave a speech on the book and her thoughts on America's banking system generally to the American Postal Workers Union and the National Association of Letter Carriers on 15 October 2015, again suggesting a return to postal banking, which was discontinued in 1967.[21]

Her second book, _The Color of Money: Black Banking and the Racial Wealth Gap_ was published in 2017 by Harvard University Press.[22] She has also published articles including "Regulation by Hypothetical" in the _Vanderbilt Law Review_, "It's Time for Postal Banking" in the _Harvard Law Review Forum_, "Banking and the Social Contract" in the _Notre Dame Law Review_, "How the Poor Got Cut Out of Banking" in the _Emory Law Journal_, "Reconsidering the Separation of Banking and Commerce" in the George Washington Law Review and "The ILC and the Reconstruction of U.S. Banking" in the _SMU Law Review_.
