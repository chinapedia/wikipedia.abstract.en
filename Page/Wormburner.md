WORMBURNER is an indie rock band based in Brooklyn, New York.[1] Their music has been categorized as college rock.[2] The band has five members, and is led by Steve "Hank" Henry, who is the band's singer, guitarist, and songwriter. Henry graduated from Colgate University in 1993.[3] Their debut album, _A Hero's Welcome_, was released in 2006 and produced by David Lowery of Cracker.[4] The band wrote and recorded the album's 12 songs at Lowery's studio in Richmond, Virginia. These songs' power-pop sound, along with a series of live shows by the band, led to the band and album becoming increasingly popular.[5] The band released its second album, _Placed by the Gideons_, in 2010 on the label Wax Off, which is partly run by WSUM host DJ Renton.[6] In 2012, the band was interviewed for MTV's series 120 Minutes.[7] In November 2013, Wormburner opened for Violent Femmes at Roseland Ballroom in New York City. Their third album, _Pleasant Living in Planned Communities_, was released on Dive Records in September 2014.[8][9][10] Prior to its release, a song from the album, "Somewhere Else to Be", was premiered by Brooklyn Magazine.[11] Robert Christgau gave _Pleasant Living in Planned Communities_ an A- grade, writing that on the album, "Hank Henry doesn't swallow a word as he shouts his tuneful tales into the void, and unlike Craig Finn [of the Hold Steady], he doesn't specialize in or even much notice the human dregs and heroes of the alt-rock scene."[12]
