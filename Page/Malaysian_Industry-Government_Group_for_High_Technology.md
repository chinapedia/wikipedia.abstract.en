The MALAYSIAN INDUSTRY-GOVERNMENT GROUP FOR HIGH TECHNOLOGY or better known as MIGHT is an independent non-profit technology think tank under the purview of the Prime Minister's Department.[1] It was established in 1993 to support the Science Advisor to the Prime Minister and leverage on the multi-disciplinary and inter-ministerial synergies from both the industry and Government.

MIGHT was tasked to be forward looking, utilizing foresight & futures (then known as prospecting) to help drive the advancement of high technology competency and capacity in Malaysia. A public-private partnership organization in nature, it provides a consensus building platform for collaboration in developing policies and strategic advice to the government.

Through its platform and works, MIGHT gave birth to notable and strategic national initiatives such Malaysia's Formula 1, Kulim High-Tech Park, Malaysian Automotive Institute, Technology Depository Agency and many others. Remaining in the background, MIGHT is known in certain circles to be a "surrogate mother" or the "nation's kitchen crew".


History

Malaysia's emphasis on development of science and technology (S&T) is nothing new. The government has long initiated active measures to promote and develop techno-business opportunities by harnessing science and technology (S&T). In 1984, under then Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, a Science Advisor’s post was created in the Prime Minister’s Department to create a conducive ecosystem where S&T and its uptake could flourish. The move is seen as complementary as well as to provide a second opinion to those of the relevant Ministries. Dr. Omar Abdul Rahman[2] was appointed to the post of Science Advisor to the Prime Minister and held the post until he retired in 2001.
The seed of MIGHT was sown when a Unit under the Office of Science Advisor was created aptly named 'High Technology Special Unit' _(Unit Khas Teknologi Tinggi)_ . This unit then grew to become what MIGHT is today.
MIGHT's focus and emphasis has been very dynamic throughout the years but has always been in the areas of high technology and heavy engineering. The focus emphasis was dependent on the maturity of the industry as well as timing of the intervention. Throughout the years, MIGHT focus areas includes but not limited to the following:-

  Sector                     Sector                         Sector

Foresight & Futures Thinking

Foresight & futures thinking is a core competency and activity of MIGHT.[9] Known as technology prospecting in its early days, MIGHT has been conducting technology foresight and future studies work to support its other activities though there are evolution and changes to the methods and processes.[10] To expand foresight beyond technology, MIGHT created myForesight - Malaysia Foresight Institute in 2012.

myForesight® (Malaysian Foresight Institute)

myForesight® was created in 2012 with the following objectives:-

1.  To explore of future possibilities for better decision making
2.  To build national capacity in foresight & futures

Technology Priorities & Advancement

Outcome of MIGHT's foresight & future studies are used to prioritize technology and industry development in Malaysia. To date, MIGHT has produced more than twenty (20) industry/sector blueprints and roadmaps. These documents were used as references to chart the development of various industry and technology in Malaysia. Various white papers and proposals by MIGHT are also used for these purposes.
In continuous search of new areas, some of these programs has since been passed to other government agencies or machineries to undertake. The following are amongst notable programs conducted by MIGHT:-
