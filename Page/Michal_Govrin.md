Books

Body of Prayer

The book is composed of three parts, written by David Shapiro, Jacques Derrida and Michal Govrin. The three are writing as Secular-Religious or Religious-Secular people about the nature and Praxis of 'praying'. The book is concerned primarily with mapping the central issues surrounding the act of praying and offers, instead of 'relieving' those issues, to embrace these issues as a vital part of the praying experience itself. The book also offers a more existential notion of prayer, as something that is embedded in the act of living, deeply rooted in our 'bodies' and in the female act of 'childbirth'.

   The book was awarded the Koret Jewish Book award and the Kugel award and was translated from Hebrew to English and Russian. The book received positive reviews at its publication.[10][11]
