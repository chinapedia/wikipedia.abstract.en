The OMAHA MUSTANGS were a professional American football team based in Omaha, Nebraska. They began as an independent, semi-pro team in the early 1960s before joining the Professional Football League of America, a newly formed league based on remnants of the United Football League, in 1965.[1] The Mustangs won the PFLA championship in their second season by defeating the Des Moines Warriors in a playoff game in front of 4,530 spectators.[2] Omaha moved to the Continental Football League for the 1968 season and finished 7-5 in the Central Division.

In September 1968, Glen Hepburn, a two-way player for the Mustangs, died from injuries sustained in a game.[3]

On December 15, 1969 the CFL revoked Omaha's franchise for failure to meet the league's financial obligations.[4] The league itself quietly disbanded after the 1969 season and the Mustangs joined the Trans-American Football League for the 1970 season.

In February 1971 the Mustangs announced they would be joining the Midwest Professional Football League.[5] The Mustangs did not operate for the 1973 season. They were revived as a fully independent team in 1974.
