DAVID ALLEN MBE[1] (24 October 1937 â€“ 13 December 2011)[2] was a teacher, trade unionist and politician from Northern Ireland.

A member of the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party, he represented the group in the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention.[3] He was elected to Ballymena Borough Council in 1973, topping the poll in the C District Electoral Area. He retained the seat in 1977, albeit as a "Ratepayers" candidate, having left the Vanguard in the interim.[4]

Allen was a pupil of Ballymena Academy.[5] A teacher by profession, he trained at Queen's University Belfast and Stranmillis College before teaching at primary level in his native Ballymena, initially at Harryville PS before moving to Ballykeel PS.[6] Known to his pupils as "Duck", he was deputy headmaster at the latter school.[7] Allen was active in the Ulster Teachers' Union and became general secretary of the body in 1978, holding the position for twenty years.[8] A prominent media figure during his time in charge, Allen's work earned him the nickname "children's champion".[9]

Allen was married twice and had one daughter.[10] Following his retirement he settled in Banbridge, while also keeping a house in Cornwall.[11] He suffered a stroke in 2011 and died soon after, aged 74. He was buried in Banbridge following a service at the town's Bannside Presbyterian Church.[12]
