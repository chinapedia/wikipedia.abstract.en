He has appeared in major roles in television series such as _Chicago Hope_, _Dead Like Me_, and _Criminal Minds_, and currently plays Saul Berenson in the Showtime series _Homeland_.

He is a noted interpreter of the musical works of Stephen Sondheim and is known for his work in musical theater, originating iconic roles such as Georges Seurat in _Sunday in the Park with George_ and Ché in the original Broadway production of _Evita_.


Early life

Mandel Bruce Patinkin was born in Chicago, Illinois, on November 30, 1952, to Doris "Doralee" (née Sinton), a homemaker, and Lester Patinkin, who operated two large Chicago-area metal factories, the People's Iron & Metal Company and the Scrap Corporation of America.[4][5][6] His mother wrote _Grandma Doralee Patinkin's Jewish Family Cookbook_.[7] Patinkin's cousins include Mark Patinkin, an author and nationally syndicated columnist for _The Providence Journal_; Sheldon Patinkin of Columbia College Chicago's Theater Department, a founder of The Second City;[8] and Bonnie Miller Rubin, a _Chicago Tribune_ reporter.

Patinkin grew up in an upper-middle-class family, descended from Jewish immigrants (from Russia and Poland), and was raised in Conservative Judaism,[9][10][11] attending religious school daily "from the age of seven to 13 or 14" and singing in synagogue choirs, as well as attending the Camp Surah in Michigan.[12]

He attended South Shore High School, Harvard St. George School, and Kenwood High School (later renamed Kenwood Academy), and graduated in 1970.[13] He attended the University of Kansas and the Juilliard School (Drama Division _Group 5_: 1972–1976).[14] At Juilliard, he was a classmate of Kelsey Grammer. When the producers of the popular American sitcom _Cheers_ were holding auditions for the role of Dr. Frasier Crane, Patinkin put Grammer's name forward.[15]


Career

After some television commercial and radio appearances (including the CBS Radio Mystery Theater in 1974), Patinkin had his first success in musical theater,[16] where he played the part of Che in _Evita_ on Broadway in 1979.[17] Patinkin went on to win the 1980 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical.[18][19][20] He then moved to film, playing parts in movies such as _Yentl_[21] and _Ragtime_. He returned to Broadway in 1984 to star in the Pulitzer Prize-winning musical _Sunday in the Park with George_,[22] which saw him earn another Tony Award nomination for Best Actor (Musical).[23][24]

Patinkin played Inigo Montoya in Rob Reiner's 1987 _The Princess Bride_, playing the role of the best swordsman in the country, short of the main character. Over the next decade, he continued to appear in movies, such as _Dick Tracy_ and _Alien Nation_.

On Broadway, Patinkin appeared in the musical _The Secret Garden_ in 1991, and was nominated for the 1991 Drama Desk Award as Outstanding Actor in a Musical.[25] He also released two solo albums, titled _Mandy Patinkin_ (1989)[26] and _Dress Casual_ (1990).[27]

In 1994, Patinkin took the role of Dr. Jeffrey Geiger on CBS's _Chicago Hope_[28] for which he won an Emmy Award. However, despite the award and the ratings success of the show, Patinkin left the show during the second season because he was unhappy spending so much time away from his wife and children.[29] He returned to the show in 1999 at the beginning of the sixth season, but it was later canceled in 2000. Since _Chicago Hope_, Patinkin has appeared in a number of films. However, he has mostly performed as a singer, releasing three more albums. In 1995, he guest-starred in _The Simpsons_ in the episode "Lisa's Wedding" as Hugh Parkfield, Lisa's future English groom.

_Mamaloshen_, Patinkin's musical production of songs sung entirely in Yiddish, premiered in 1998. He has performed the show on Broadway and in venues around the United States. The recorded version won a _Deutscher Schallplattenpreis_ award in Germany.[30]

In 1999, Patinkin co-starred in the second and final _Sesame Street_ film _The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland_ as Huxley, a villainous, sadistic, abusive, childish, tyrannical, cruel and greedy man with abnormally large eyebrows, who steals whatever he can grab and then claims it as his own.[31] Patinkin returned to Broadway in 2000 in the New York Shakespeare Festival production of John LaChiusa's _The Wild Party_, earning another Tony Award nomination for Best Actor (Musical).[32] In 2003-2004 he appeared in the Showtime comedy–drama _Dead Like Me_ as Rube Sofer. In 2004 he played a six–week engagement of his one–man concert at the Off-Broadway complex Dodger Stages.

In September 2005, Patinkin debuted in the role of Jason Gideon, an experienced profiler just coming back to work after a series of nervous breakdowns, in the CBS crime drama TV show _Criminal Minds._[33]

Patinkin was absent from a table read for _Criminal Minds_ and did not return for a third season. The departure from the show was not due to contractual or salary matters, but over creative differences. He left apologetic letters for his fellow cast members explaining his reasons and wishing them luck. Many weeks before his departure, in a videotaped interview carried in the online magazine _Monaco Revue_, Patinkin told journalists at the Festival de Télévision de Monte-Carlo that he loathed violence on television and was uncomfortable with certain scenes in _Criminal Minds_. He called his choice to do _Criminal Minds_ his "biggest public mistake," and stated that he "thought it was something very different. I never thought they were going to kill and rape all these women every night, every day, week after week, year after year. It was very destructive to my soul and my personality, and after that, I didn't think I would get to work in television again."[34]

He spoke of having planned to tour the world with a musical and wanting to inject more comedy into the entertainment business.[35] In later episodes, during the 2007–08 season, Jason Gideon was written out of the series and replaced by Special Agent David Rossi (played by Joe Mantegna). Gideon was later officially killed off, ending all chances of a guest appearance by Patinkin on the show.

On October 14, 2009, it was announced that Patinkin would be a guest star on an episode of _Three Rivers_, which aired on November 15, 2009. He played a patient with Lou Gehrig's disease injured in a car accident who asks the doctors at Three Rivers Hospital to take him off life support so his organs can be donated. He filmed an appearance on _The Whole Truth_ that had been scheduled to air December 15, 2010, but ABC pulled the series from its schedule two weeks prior.[36]

He starred in the new musical _Paradise Found_, co-directed by Harold Prince and Susan Stroman, at the Menier Chocolate Factory, London. The musical played a limited engagement from May 2010 through June 26, 2010.[37]

Patinkin and Patti Lupone performed their concert _An Evening with Patti Lupone and Mandy Patinkin_ on Broadway for a limited 63-performance run starting November 21, 2011, at the Barrymore Theatre, and which ended on January 13, 2012. This concert marks the first time the pair has performed together on Broadway since they appeared together in _Evita_.[38][39]

He currently costars with Claire Danes on the Showtime series _Homeland_ which initially aired in 2011.[40][41] He portrays counterterrorism operative Saul Berenson, protagonist Carrie Mathison's (Danes) mentor. For his performance, Patinkin has been nominated for a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award, among other honors. Explaining what he learned from the character, he stated that "The line between good and evil runs through each one of us."[42]

Patinkin was announced as playing the role of Pierre in the hit Broadway musical _Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812_ starting August 15, 2017.[43] He would have a limited run through September 3, replacing former _Hamilton_ star Okieriete Onaodowan.[44] The role was originated by Josh Groban. Patinkin later dropped out of the role.[45]

In 2018, Patinkin returned to recorded music with the album _Diary: January 27, 2018_ which was produced by pianist Thomas Bartlett.[46]


Personal life

On June 15, 1980, Patinkin married actress and writer Kathryn Grody. They have two sons named Isaac and Gideon. Gideon joined his father onstage in _Dress Casual_ in 2011.[47] Patinkin has described himself as "Jewish with a dash of Buddhist" belief. On the Canadian radio program _Q_, Patinkin describes himself as a "JewBu" because of this mix of beliefs[48] and "spiritual but not religious."[49]

Patinkin suffered from keratoconus, a degenerative eye condition, in the mid-1990s. This led to two corneal transplants, his right cornea in 1997 and his left in 1998.[50] He was also diagnosed with and treated for prostate cancer in 2004.[51] He celebrated his first year of recovery in 2005 by doing a charity bike ride with his son, Isaac – the Arava Institute Hazon Israel Ride: Cycling for Peace, Partnership & Environmental Protection.[52]

Patinkin has been involved in a variety of Jewish causes and cultural activities. He sings in Yiddish, often in concert, and on his album _Mamaloshen_.[53] He also wrote introductions for two books on Jewish culture, _The Jewish American Family Album_, by Dorothy and Thomas Hoobler, and _Grandma Doralee Patinkin's Holiday Cookbook: A Jewish Family's Celebrations_, by his mother, Doralee Patinkin Rubin.

In May 2012, Patinkin delivered the opening speech at the Annual Convention of the Israeli Left, where he recounted his experiences during a visit to the West Bank with members of the Breaking the Silence organization.[54]

Patinkin contributed to the children's book _Dewey Doo-it Helps Owlie Fly Again: A Musical Storybook_, inspired by Christopher Reeve. The award-winning book, published in 2005, benefits the Christopher Reeve Foundation and includes an audio CD with Patinkin singing and reading the story as well as Dana Reeve and Bernadette Peters singing.[55]

On December 21, 2015, Patinkin was on the _Charlie Rose_ program on PBS talking about his recent trip to Greece to help refugees from war-torn Syria and his acting role on the television series _Homeland_. He stated that he wanted to help "create opportunity and better systems of living and existing, to give freedom, justice and dignity, quality of life to humanity all over the world."[56]
