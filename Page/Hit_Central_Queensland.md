HIT CENTRAL QUEENSLAND is a radio station in Central Queensland part of the Hit Network. The station is owned by Southern Cross Austereo.[1]


History

In the late 1990s, DMG Regional Radio successfully bid for an FM broadcasting license for a radio station in the Rockhampton/Gladstone market in Central Queensland.

In October 2000, Hot FM was launched. The station was a new addition to the existing Hot FM network of stations, also owned by DMG Regional Radio. The Central Queensland Hot FM station was originally created to attract the younger demographics that didn't listen to DMG's established classic hits station, Gladstone's 4CC which also broadcast to Rockhampton.

The station originally broadcast its local breakfast program from a studio in Rockhampton, and sourced its daytime and overnight programming from Hot FM Townsville. Since its inception, Hot FM has broadcast on two separate frequencies in Rockhampton and Gladstone.

When Hot FM was launched, RG Capital also launched an FM station in Rockhampton, Sea FM to attract a younger demographics that didn't find RG Capital's established AM station 4RO appealing. For the first few years, Sea FM and Hot FM were fierce rivals, battling for the same demographic of listeners.

In 2004, DMG Regional Radio merged with RG Capital to form Macquarie Regional RadioWorks, which saw all four local Central Queensland stations owned by the same company. Macquarie Regional Radioworks were legally obligated to offload at least two stations, and decided to sell their two AM stations, 4RO and 4CC to Prime Media Group.

This meant the two FM stations that were once rivals found themselves as sister stations.

In 2005, Hot FM decided to cease broadcasting content from Rockhampton. While the local Hot FM sales office was moved into the existing 4RO and Sea FM studio complex, the local breakfast program began being broadcast from the existing 4CC building in Gladstone. When this occurred, the breakfast announcer that had been with Hot FM since its inception moved over to Hot FM's new stablemate, Sea FM so he continue working in Rockhampton in 2005, while his Hot FM co-host moved to the afternoon shift on Sea FM. Hot FM began broadcasting its local breakfast show from the Gladstone studio on 24 January 2005.[2][3][4]

Although no longer stablemates, 4CC and Hot FM have continued to share the same building in Gladstone since the merger.


Current Programming

Format

Hot FM's format hasn't changed much since it was originally launched in 2000. The format has always been skewed towards the younger demographics, which is attracted by such things as the latest hits, celebrity gossip, pop culture and discussions about the latest television shows and movie releases.

Shows

The local breakfast show currently is Tim Bolch and Jessica Pantou and is broadcast from a studio in Gladstone between 5am and 9am each weekday. The breakfast show is the only local program on Hit CQ in Central Queensland. The breakfast program is also now heard on the Hit CQ station (4HIT) in Emerald, which previously took a networked breakfast show especially produced for inland Hit CQ stations from Townsville.

After the local breakfast program, the station takes generic _Hits & Old School_ network programming from the Gold Coast, presented by 90.9 Sea FM announcers.[5][6]

National drive, overnight and weekend breakfast programming is sourced from Southern Cross Austereo's metropolitan stations such as 2Day FM and Fox FM. This includes programs such as _Hamish & Andy_, _Hit 30_ and _The Dan & Maz Show_.

Occasionally, local businesses will pay for special outside broadcasts usually held on weekends. As Hot FM only has the two local announcers, they are the presenters that will usually conduct the outside broadcast, regardless of whether the outside broadcast is held in Rockhampton, Gladstone or Emerald.

News

Local news bulletins heard during the Hot FM breakfast program are compiled and presented by a Rockhampton-based journalist at Hot FM's sister station, Sea FM. National bulletins are presented from newsrooms either in Townsville or the Gold Coast.


Ratings

On 29 September 2016, ratings for the Central Queensland radio market were released. It was the first time since 2001 that ratings for the Rockhampton/Gladstone market have been calculated.

The station also beat all other local stations in the 10+, 10-17, 18-24, and 25-39 age demographics. Hot FM's breakfast program was the highest rating breakfast show out of all commercial and ABC stations.[7]


Rebranding

On 26 September 2016, Southern Cross Austereo announced that Hot FM in Central Queensland will be renamed Hit as part of a major rebranding of the radio network. As part of the rebranding, Hot FM stations in Queensland and Western Australia, Star FM stations in New South Wales and some Sea FM stations will be renamed, to reflect the look and feel of the metropolitan Hit Network. As the Sea FM station in Central Queensland is a Triple M LocalWorks station, it will be renamed Triple M as part of the network's rebranding of regional stations.[8]
