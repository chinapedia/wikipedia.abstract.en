IBM SYSTEMT is a declarative information extraction system. It was first built in 2005, as a research project at IBM's IBM Almaden Research Center. Its name is partially inspired by System R, a seminal project from the same research center.

SystemT[1] comprises the following three main components: (1) AQL, a declarative rule language with a similar syntax to SQL; (2) Optimizer, which accepts AQL statements as input and generates high-performance algebraic execution plans; and (3) Executing engine, which executes the plan generated by the Optimizer and performs information extraction over input documents.

SystemT is available as part of IBM BigInsights [2], and has also been taught in multiple universities around the globe. A version of SystemT was available (starting in September 2016) as a companion to a sequence of online courses in Text Analytics[3].
