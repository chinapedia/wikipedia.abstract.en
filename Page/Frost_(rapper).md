ARTURO MOLINA, JR. (born May 31, 1964), better known as FROST (originally KID FROST), is an American rapper, songwriter and record producer. He is from Los Angeles, California. He is also the father of American record producer Scoop DeVille.


Early life

Molina was born and raised in Windsor, California and occasionally lived with his family in military bases in Guam and Germany. He began his music career in 1982 as Kid Frost as a tribute to his rival Ice-T, whom he often battled in the music industry. In an interview Frost stated that his first actual DJ was in fact Dr. Dre and DJ Yella. He soon became a breakdancer for Uncle Jamms Army.[1]


Music career

In the mid-1980s, Frost released several pre-gangsta 12" singles on Los Angeles-based labels Electrobeat and Baja. In the late 1980s, Kid Frost moved to Virgin Records. Virgin released his biggest hit, "La Raza". His debut album, _Hispanic Causing Panic_ was released in 1990. He also established a Latin rap supergroup called Latin Alliance, which released their only album, _Latin Alliance_, in 1991. His second album, _East Side Story_ was released in 1992, which featured appearances from MC Eiht, A.L.T. and Ganxta Ridd from the Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E.

In 1995, Frost dropped the "Kid" from his nickname and signed with Ruthless Records, Eazy-E's label (distributed by Relativity). _Smile Now, Die Later_ was released that year. Above The Law were featured as guest rappers, alongside A.L.T., O.G.Enius and Kokane. Rick James also appeared on Frost's version of "Mary Jane". His second album for Ruthless, _When Hell.A.Freezes Over_, was released in 1997. Ice-T, Scoop, O.G.Enius and Domino also appeared as guest rappers.

In 1999, Frost moved to a small independent label called Celeb Entertainment Inc. His first album for Celeb Entertainment titled _This Was Then This Is Now Vol. I_ was released in 1999. Kurupt, King T, Baby Bash, Jay Tee, Jayo Felony, Xzibit, B-Legit and Cameo were featured on the CD. _That Was Then This Is Now Vol. II_ was released in 2000. Frank V., Clika One, Jay Tee, Baby Bash and other guest rappers were also featured on the CD.

Mellow Man Ace, Daz Dillinger, Baby Bash, A.L.T., Nino Brown, Don Cisco and other guest rappers appeared, and one track featured the group Tierra.

In 2005 _Welcome to Frost Angeles_ was released on Thump Records, which was produced almost entirely by Frost and his son Scoop DeVille. Only the Intro is produced by Binky Womack, and Philly Blunt co-produced one track. Guest rappers included Cameosis, Genovese and Jay Tee. Frost again signed to Low Profile Records and released his album _Till The Wheels Fall Off_ in 2006. It had various guest appearances which included Baby Bash, Scoop DeVille and Mr. Sancho.

Frost also performed music for films including "Bite the Bullet (Theme from Gunmen)" in the 1993 film _Gunmen_ and "Tears Of A Mother" in the film _No Mothers Crying, No Babies Dying_, which featured Ice-T.
