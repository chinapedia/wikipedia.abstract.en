MARGARET FAIRWEATHER (23 September 1901 â€“ 4 August 1944) was a British aviator and one of the first eight women members of the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA).[1] She flew many planes including Tiger Moths and Hurricanes, and was the first woman to fly a Supermarine Spitfire.[2] She had previously been an instructor for the Civil Air Guard at Renfrew.[3]

She was educated at Notting Hill High School for Girls[4]

Shortly after the death of her husband in an ATA aircraft on 3 April 1944, she died in a crash on 4 August that same year; also on board was her sister Kitty who was injured. The cause of the crash was a mechanical problem with the fuel tank.[5][6]
