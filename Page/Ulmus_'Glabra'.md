The ELM cultivar _ULMUS_ 'GLABRA' was distributed by the Späth nursery, Berlin, in the 1890s and early 1900s as _U. glabra_ Mill.. Not to be confused with the species _U. glabra_ Huds..


Description

Späth's catalogue described the tree as having smooth shiny dark green leaves.[1] For leaf-shape, toothing and petiole, see 'External links' below. Melville (1958) described the specimen from Späth in Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (see 'Cultivation') as "a tree of 15 m with very long pendulous branches".[2]


Pests and diseases

The RBGE specimen was killed by Dutch elm disease in the 1990s.


Cultivation

One tree was planted in 1896 as _U. glabra_ Mill. at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, Canada.[3] Three specimens were supplied by Späth to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902 as _U. glabra_. One was planted in the garden proper; Melville renamed it _U. carpinifolia_ × _U. plotii_ in 1958;[4] the other two may survive in Edinburgh, as it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city (viz. the Wentworth Elm).[5] The current list of Living Accessions held in the Garden does not list the plant.[6] A tree listed as _Ulmus glabra_ (separately from wych and field elm entries), probably obtained from Späth, stood in the Ryston Hall arboretum, Norfolk,[7] in the early 20th century.[8]
