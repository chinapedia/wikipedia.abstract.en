_THE FALLING MAN_ (in ) is a sculpture by French artist Auguste Rodin modeled in 1882[1] and is part of Rodin's emblematic group _The Gates of Hell_.

This figure represents the cumulative human forces, cast upon the eternal emptiness of Hell.[2] In _The Gates of Hell_, the sculpture appears in three different places: at the top of the left door, at the top of the right pilaster— the one holding _Crouching Woman_ as part of _I am beautiful_[3]— and as the central piece of _Avarice_ at the bottom of the Gates. Judging by the position of the first figure, some authors have suggested that Rodin suspected his commission would be canceled[4] because the arched position of the man would make difficult, if not impossible, to open and close the doors, hindering its function.[5]

Is worth noting that, even though this figure appears in different directions in _The Gates_, its muscles stay the same; which hints at Rodin's idea of taking an artistic license regarding gravity. This concept heralds the modernist movement, which favors expression over verisimilitude.
