NEW MONTEFIORE CEMETERY is a Jewish cemetery located in West Babylon, Suffolk County, New York.


History

Montefiore Cemetery Corporation had been maintaining Montefiore Cemetery in Springfield Gardens, Queens since 1908. The corporation bought 250 acres from Pinelawn Cemetery for $375,000 and established New Montefiore Cemetery in 1928.[1] Burials started shortly afterwards.

New Montefiore is one of a group of adjacent large cemeteries on Long Island sometimes called "cemetery row." From north to south along Wellwood Avenue, these are the Department of Veterans Affairs' Long Island National Cemetery, the non-sectarian Pinelawn Memorial Park and Gardens, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn's Saint Charles Cemetery, and four Jewish cemeteries, which are Beth Moses Cemetery, Wellwood Cemetery, New Montefiore, and Mount Ararat Cemetery.[2]

The Shomrim Society, the fraternal society of Jewish officers in the New York City Police Department, has a burial plot for their members in New Montefiore Cemetery.
