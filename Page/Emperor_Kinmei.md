was the 29th Emperor of Japan,[1] according to the traditional order of succession.[2]

His reign is said to have spanned the years from 539 through 571. Kinmei is the first Japanese Emperor for whom contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates.[3]


Traditional narrative

Kinmei's contemporary title would not have been _tennō_, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning "the great king who rules all under heaven". Alternatively, Kinmei might have been referred to as or the "Great King of Yamato".

Events of Kinmei's life

Because of several chronological discrepancies in the account of Emperor Kinmei in the _Nihon Shoki_, some believe that he was actually ruling a rival court to that of Emperors Ankan and Senka. Nevertheless, according to the traditional account, it was not until the death of Emperor Kinmei's older brother Emperor Senka that he gained the throne.

According to this account, Emperor Senka died in 539 at the age of 73;[4] and succession passed to the third son of Emperor Keitai. This Imperial Prince was the next youngest brother of Emperor Senka. He would come to be known as Emperor Kinmei. He established his court at in Yamato.[5]

The Emperor's chief counselors were:

-   _Ōomi_ (Great Imperial chieftain): Soga no Iname no Sukune, also known as Soga no Iname.[6]
-   _Ōmuraji_ (Great Deity chieftain): Monotobe Okoshi no Muraji, also known as Mononobe no Okoshi.[7]
-   _Ōmuraji_ (Great Deity chieftain): Ōtomo Kanamura Maro, also known as Otomo no Kanamura.[8]

Although the imperial court was not moved to the Asuka region of Japan until 592, Emperor Kinmei's rule is considered by some to be the beginning of the Asuka period of Yamato Japan, particularly by those who associate the Asuka period primarily with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan from Baekje.

According to the _Nihon Shoki_, Emperor Kinmei received a bronze statue of Buddha as a gift from the king of Baekje King Song Myong (聖明王, _Seimei Ō_) along with a significant envoy of artisans, monks, and other artifacts in 552. (However, according to the Jōgū Shōtoku Hōō Teisetsu, Buddhism was introduced in 538.) This episode is widely regarded as the official introduction of Buddhism to the country.

With the introduction of a new religion to the court, a deep rift developed between the Mononobe clan, who supported the worship of Japan's traditional deities, and the Soga clan, who supported the adoption of Buddhism.

According to the _Nihon Shoki_, Emperor Kinmei ruled until his death in 571 and was buried in the . An alternate stronger theory holds that he was actually buried in the , located in .

The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (_misasagi_) at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates the Nara location as Kinmei's mausoleum.[9] It is formally named _Hinokuma no saki Ai no misasagi_;[10] however, the actual sites of the graves of the early Emperors remain problematic, according to some historians and archaeologists.
