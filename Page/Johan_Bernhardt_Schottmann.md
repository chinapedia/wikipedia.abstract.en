Schottmann was born at Gotha in Saxony in 1734.[1] He moved to Copenhagen where he was licensed as a mason on 11 May 1763 and served as alderman of the Masons' Guild from 1778 to 1785[2] As a master builder, Schottmann was an early proponent of the Neoclassical style in Copenhagen. His own house at Strandgade 10 in Christianshavn, now known as the Schottmann House after him, shows influence from Nicolas-Henri Jardins simple facade designs. With projects such as Søkvæsthuset's Bådmandsstræde Wing and Danish Asiatic Company's warehouse at Strandgade 25, Schottmann adapted new buildings to the style of older architecture.[3]

He married Anna Cathrine Biergaard (c. 1744 – 1815) in Copenhagen. He died in 1786 and was interred at St. Peter's Church, Copenhagen
