The MAXIMUM AGREEMENT SUBTREE PROBLEM is any of several closely related problems in graph theory and computer science. In all of these problems one is given a collection of trees T₁, …, T_(m) each containing n leaves. The leaves of these trees are given labels from some set L with |L| = n so that no pair of leaves in the same tree sharing the same label, within the same tree the labelling for each leaf is distinct. In this problem one would like to find the largest subset L′ ⊂ L such that the minimal spanning subtrees containing the leaves in L′, of T₁ ∣ S, …, T_(m) ∣ S are the "same" while preserving the labelling.


Formulations

Maximum homeomorphic agreement subtree[1]

This version requires that the subtrees T₁ ∣ S, …, T_(m) ∣ S are homeomorphic to one another.

Rooted maximum homeomorphic agreement subtree

This version is the same as the _maximum homeomorphic agreement subtree_, but we further assume that T₁, …, T_(m) are rooted and that the subtrees T₁ ∣ S, …, T_(m) ∣ S contain the root node. This version of the maximum agreement subtree problem is used for the study of phylogenetic trees.[2] Because of its close ties with phylogeny this formulation is often what is mean when one refers to the "maximum agreement subtree" problem.

Other variants

There exits other formulations for example the _(rooted) maximum isomorphic agreement subtree_[3] where we require the subtrees to be isomorphic to one another.
