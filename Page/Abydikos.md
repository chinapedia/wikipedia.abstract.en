_ABYDIKOS_ () was a Byzantine official charged with overseeing maritime traffic.

The term most likely derives from the city of Abydos on the Hellespont, and evidently originally referred to an official responsible for overseeing maritime traffic through the straits there. Helene Ahrweiler suggested that he was the successor of the _archon_ or _komes_ "of the Straits", attested in Late Antiquity; scholars debate whether the office is the same as the "_paraphylax_ of Abydos", which often occurs on seals. Eventually the term was more broadly applied to all officials with similar duties, and _abydikoi_ are attested in Thessalonica, Amisus, Chrepos, and Euripus.

The _abydikos_ was a military official, equivalent to the rank of _komes_, in the Byzantine navy. The office was often combined with the post of _kommerkiarios_, a fiscal office responsible for inspecting and taxing commerce. The office survived until the 11th century.
