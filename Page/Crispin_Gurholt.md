CRISPIN GURHOLT (born January 18, 1965 in Oslo) is a Norwegian artist based in Oslo and Berlin, known for his Live Photo projects since 2000.[1][2] Live Photos are site-specific, live installations, where the artist stages people in carefully directed tableaus. The settings are often trivial and ordinary – a bookshop, a street corner, a hairdresser`s.[3] The models, posing in a frozen photographic moment, are viewed by the audience through a natural or artificial barrier such as a shop window or a sheet of mounted plexiglass. The live performances normally have a duration of two hours.

A Live Photo starts as a live performance; the performance is then photographed and filmed; and later translated into paintings and texts. Through this combination of formats, new stories and layers of meaning emerge.

Live Photo subjects throw a critical light on society's repressive mechanisms and power hierarchies, such as racism, domestic violence and issues raised by globalised economic or institutionalised structures. Live Photo deals with the relation between reality and fiction and the idea of time, moment and memory.

Live Photo can also be seen in the context of the historical tableau vivant.

Crispin Gurholt studied at the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts (1993-1998) and New York University, SCE Film School (1996). He has presented his live installations, photographs and videos in Europe, South America and Canada, The Henie Onstad Art Center, Art Copenhagen, :de:Art Forum Berlin, Art Cologne, New Positions, The Stenersen Museum, Art Foundation Mallorca, The Vigeland Museum, The North Norwegian Art Museum, Lillehammer Art Museum,[4] Kunstnernes Hus, Haus feur Kunst Uri, Kistefos Museum, The National Theatre[5] and Haugar Vestfold Art Museum.
