Racing career

2013â€“2014

After a successful stint in kart racing, Gracie contested the 2013 and 2014 seasons of the Porsche Carrera Cup Australia Championship. In 2013, she was the first female to compete in that championship. The following year, she achieved five top 10 race results and a 100 percent race finishing record.[1]

2015

In 2015, Gracie switched to the Supercars Dunlop Series, in which she drove for Paul Morris Motorsport, and was the first full-time female competitor in 14 years.[2][3][4] At the end of that year, she was classified 18th in the championship standings, with 634 points and a best race result of 12th.[5][6]

After undergoing extensive repairs, it was sent back out, with de Silvestro at the wheel, to finish 21st, 40 laps down on the winning pair of Craig Lowndes and Steven Richards.[12][13][14]

2016

In 2016, Gracie competed in her second season of the Supercars Dunlop Series, once again for Paul Morris Motorsport.[15] She also teamed up with de Silvestro for a second assault at the Bathurst 1000, this time in a Nissan Altima L33 prepared by Nissan Motorsport.[16] Despite starting the race on the back row in 26th position, Gracie and de Silvestro had no major issues during the race, and managed stay out of trouble to finish 14th in the chaotic final laps.[17][18][19]

2017

Gracie moved to Dragon Motor Sport for a third season in the renamed Super2 Series. After a string of poor results with only one top-10 finish in 17 races and a lack of available funds, she was replaced with Kumho Series driver Jordan Boys.
