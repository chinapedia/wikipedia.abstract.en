BRIGHTON LOVERS WALK TRACTION AND ROLLING STOCK MAINTENANCE DEPOT is a traction maintenance depot located in Brighton, East Sussex, England. The depot is situated adjacent to the Brighton Main Line and is to the north of Brighton station.[1]

The depot code is BI.


History

The depot was opened in 1848 as a carriage works by the LB&SCR, being converted in 1933 to an EMU depot by the Southern Railway. At that time, it had adjoining five and seven-track dead-ended buildings.[2]

In 1987, the depot's allocation included Classes 421, 422 and 423 EMUs.[3] Around the same time, the depot was also used to stable locomotives, including Classes 09, 33, 47 and 73.[4]

Modernisation resulted in the five-track building being reduced to a four-track from 2002, and the depot was reopened for servicing Class 377 units in 2006. A mix of Bombardier Transportation and Southern Railway technicians are based here.[5]


Allocation

As of 2016, the depot's allocation consists of Southern and Thameslink Class 377 EMUs, Class 313 EMUs and Class 442 EMUs.
