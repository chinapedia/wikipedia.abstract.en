A LETTER GAME involves the exchange of written letters, or e-mails, between two or more participants. The first player writes a letter in the voice of a newly created character; in this first letter, the writer should establish their own identity and that of their correspondent, should set the scene, and should explain why they and their correspondent must communicate in written fashion. In subsequent letters, plot and character can be developed, but the writers should not talk about plot outside of the letters and the characters should never meet. Letter games can be a writing exercise or a form of collaborative fiction.

Novels written using or inspired by this type of letter game include _Sorcery and Cecelia or The Enchanted Chocolate Pot_, _The Grand Tour or The Purloined Coronation Regalia_, and _The Mislaid Magician or Ten Years After_, all three by Patricia Wrede and Caroline Stevermer; _Freedom and Necessity_, by Steven Brust and Emma Bull; and the children's books _P.S. Longer Letter Later_ and _Snail Mail No More_ by Paula Danziger and Ann M. Martin.
