Service

The 191st Pennsylvania Infantry was organized at while in the field from veterans and recruits of the Pennsylvania Reserves[1] and mustered in May 31, 1864 under the command of Colonel James Carle. The regiment was attached to 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, V Corps, Army of the Potomac, to August 1864. 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, V Corps, to September 1864. 3rd Brigade, 2nd Division, V Corps, to June 1865.

On March 21, 1865, the 157th Pennsylvania Infantry was merged into the 191st Pennsylvania. The combined regiments then mustered out of service on June 28, 1865 as the 191st Pennsylvania Infantry. According to historian Samuel Bates, “In consequence of its consolidation, no separate muster-out rolls were made. The records of the officers and men will, therefore, be found in their places in the rolls of the One Hundred and Ninety-first, and such as left the service, or died before the consolidation, in an appendix to that regiment.”[2][3]
