GUARRATO is a frazione of the comune of Trapani, located on the road to Marsala, about 10 km from Trapani city, on the west coast of Sicily in Italy.

The origin of the settlement dates to the 13th century. According to one theory, the name of the settlement comes from the Sicilian word "guarratu", which might be a variant of "quadradu" (square).[1] Another theory derives the name from the Marsalese Guarrato family, which settled in the area.
