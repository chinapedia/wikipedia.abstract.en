There are two main couples in the series. The first one is tagged as a boy-girl (or “straight”) couple of Tomo Visava Thaiyanont and Maengmum Pimnitchakun Bumrungkit who are playing the roles of “Cho” and “Yihwa” respectively; and the other one is the “boys love” couple of Max Nattapol Diloknawarit and Tul Pakorn Thanasrivanitchai playing the roles of “Korn” and “Knock” respectively. Similar to other Thai dramas, there are also other couples and actors who bring life to the series. Most of the scenes are taken in a university and in condominiums where they live.

The series has garnered positive citations not just in Thailand, but also in specific communities in the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan, and Singapore.

A prequel focusing on the couple of "Korn" and "Knock" on how they met and fall in love, titled _Together With Me_ with 13 episodes was announced and released in August 2017.


Plot

Yihwa, a single university girl, believes that she doesn’t need boys in her life because she can survive without them, and thinks that boys are like iPhones that are only for decorative purposes. However, when she goes to the condominium unit of her best friend Korn, who is celebrating his anniversary with his partner Knock, she meets Korn’s friend, Cho, who falls in love with her at first sight. But Yihwa does not feel the same way; instead, she thinks that Cho is gay and he wants to have a relationship with Knock. After that day, Cho starts to pursue her, however he has a hard time trying to please her and experiences many ups-and-downs before he becomes close to her.
