TERCETO YOYO was a Cuban son trio active during the 1920s. It was formed by Heliodoro "Yoyo" Rodríguez (güiro), Jesús "Chuchú" Arístola (marímbula) and Celedonio Hernández (guitar).[1][2][3] They recorded up to twenty songs for Victor in Havana,[4] enjoying great popularity at the time, although only three of their recordings have survived.[5][6] These are considered the oldest son recordings featuring the marímbula, together with those by the Sexteto Habanero.[7]

Their recording of the "El cangrejito" is the only one issued on CD, as it was included in the _Hot Music from Cuba 1907-1936_ compilation released by Harlequin Records.[8]

In the early 1960s, Chuchú, Yoyo and Celedonio briefly reunited for a tour promoted by the new Revolutionary Government; Chuchú had to retire from the tour for health reasons.[9]
