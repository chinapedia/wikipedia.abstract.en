The trait of BACKWARD SPEECH is described as an ability to spontaneously and accurately reverse words. Two strategies of word reversal were reported: reversal according to the phonetic structure of the words or reversal according to their spelling.[1] In the 1980s Nelson Cowan hypothesized that this ability is afforded by an extraordinary working memory.[2] Recent studies have provided evidence that the working memory is indeed involved in this ability and further suggested that genetic factors may contribute to this trait.[3]
