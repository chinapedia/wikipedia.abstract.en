JEAN FLEMING, COUNTESS OF CASSILIS, LADY KENNEDY (1553/4â€“1609) was a Scottish noblewoman and courtier at the court of James VI of Scotland, and a victim of domestic violence.


Biography

Jean Fleming was born in 1553/4, daughter of James Fleming, 4th Lord Fleming. Upon his death, his title and estates passed to her uncle, James' brother John Fleming, 5th Lord Fleming, and Jean Fleming had to resort to action in the Privy Council of Scotland to secure a share of the inheritance.[1]

She married John Maitland, then Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland and later Lord Chancellor of Scotland, in January 1583 and she was then called "Lady Thirlestane". The couple has two children, Anne, born in 1590 and who died in 1609, and John Maitland, a judge who became President of the Parliament of Scotland and of Privy Council.

In December 1587 the poet William Fowler dedicated his _Triumphs of Petrarke_ to her, and a woman "E. D.", perhaps Elizabeth Douglas of Temple-Hall, contributed two sonnets in her praise.[2]

Jean Fleming shared in her husband's work as Chancellor of Scotland. She managed to make an enemy of James VI's wife Anne of Denmark by remarking in her hearing of Anne's supposed relationship with Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell, who had been imprisoned for witchcraft in connections with events around the marriage of Anne and James, and whose trajectory from this point forwards was escape, exile, forfeiture and death.[3] The queen wrote a letter mentioning her accusation that she was complicit with the Earl of Bothwell.[4] She was again in the queen's favour by February 1595.[5]

On Maitland's death in 1595 Jean was left a rich widow, and quickly married John Kennedy, 5th Earl of Cassilis, some 22-years her junior, becoming Countess of Cassillis. The age disparity aroused considerable scornful comment in the Scottish court, but Jean's wealth ensured the continued status of the couple: Kennedy was offered a post as Treasurer in 1599, but declined, fearing the cost of the appointment in terms of anticipated loans to a needy James VI.[6]

On 22 February 1600 Fleming and Cassilis hosted James VI at Thirlestane Castle.[7] In 1602 she was contrasted with the Catholic Lady Livingstone as "a lady without all religion".[8]

Kennedy was imprisoned twice in 1604 for doing violence to Jean, the first incident involving him dragging her from court before witnesses.[9] King James advised the Privy Council of Scotland to protect her financial interests from her husband.[10]

During this period it was alleged that Hector Ferguson of Letterpin had ambushed Jean Fleming and servants between the Inch of Galloway and Maybole, and chased her to Maybole Castle.[11]

Jean Fleming died in Edinburgh after a period of illness on 23 June 1609 and is buried in St Mary's Collegiate Church, Haddington.[12]
