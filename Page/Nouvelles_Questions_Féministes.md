_NOUVELLES QUESTIONS FÉMINISTES_ (New Feminist Questions) or _NQF_ is a biannual French peer-reviewed academic journal of feminism published by Editions Antipodes. Since 2001, the journal's French and Swiss editorial board has been headed by Delphy and Patricia Roux. The journal is currently based at the University of Lausanne and LIEGE (Laboratoire interuniversitaire en Etudes Genre, or Inter-university Lab for Gender Studies).


History

The journal was established in 1981 by a group of feminists including Simone de Beauvoir, Christine Delphy, Claude Hennequin and Emmanuèle de Lesseps. It was a successor of _Questions féministes_ following a schism in that journal's editorial collective over the status of women's participation in heterosexuality.[1][2]
