Club career

Manchester United

Early years

Tuanzebe was associated with the Manchester United academy from the age of eight.[1] He was a member of Milk Cup winning youth sides in 2013 and 2014.[2] In May 2015, Tuanzebe won the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award.[3] Academy coach Paul McGuinness noted that Tuanzebe was the first first-year scholar to captain the under-18 side since Gary Neville.[4]

On 31 October 2015, Tuanzebe was named on the substitutes bench for a match against Crystal Palace in the Premier League, the first time he had been a member of a first-team squad.[5][6]

2016–17 season

On 29 January 2017, Tuanzebe made his Manchester United debut as a 68th-minute substitute, replacing Timothy Fosu-Mensah during a 4–0 FA Cup victory over Wigan Athletic at Old Trafford.[7] Four days later, he extended his contract at Manchester United until 2020, with the option of a further year.[8] On 7 May 2017, Tuanzebe started a senior match for the first time, in a 2–0 defeat against Arsenal in the Premier League.[9] He won the Denzil Haroun Reserve Team Player of the Year award in May 2017.[10]

2017–18 season

Tuanzebe made his first start of the season against Swansea City in the EFL Cup on 24 October 2017, playing a key part in the second goal of the 2–0 victory.[11] On 5 December 2017, he made his European debut in a 2–1 victory over CSKA Moscow in the UEFA Champions League.[12]

Loans to Aston Villa

On 25 January 2018, Tuanzebe joined Championship side Aston Villa on loan for the remainder of the season.[13] However, injuries meant he was only able to make five appearances before returning to Manchester United. He joined Aston Villa on loan again for the 2018–19 season.[14]


International career

Tuanzebe began his international career in June 2016, when he made his first appearance for England at under-19 level, against Mexico.[15] He was a member of the under-20 squad which won all three matches at the Four Nations tournament in October 2016.[16] Tuanzebe was withdrawn from selection for the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup due to club commitments.[17]

On 10 November 2017, Tuanzebe made his debut for England under-21 against Ukraine.[18]


Style of play

Tuanzebe's preferred position is at centre-back, but he can also play as a right-back, and has featured as a holding midfielder.[19][20] His playing style has been compared to that of teammate Eric Bailly and Bayern Munich's Javi Martínez.[21] Tuanzebe's performance on his first-team debut in a friendly against Wigan Athletic in July 2016 led manager José Mourinho to remark, "10 minutes is enough! The potential is there, you see it immediately."[22]


Personal life

Tuanzebe was born in Bunia, Democratic Republic of the Congo.[23] He attended St Cuthbert's RC High School in Rochdale and captained the Year 7 football team to the final of the English National Schools Cup at Stamford Bridge in 2009, with a team that also included Connor Ronan and Johny Diba, both of whom went on to turn professional.[24] In the same year, he was awarded Sports Boy of the Year by the Mayor of Rochdale.[25] He also represented his school in cross-country and triple-jump.[26] He is the younger brother of ex-Clitheroe striker Dimitri Tuanzebe.[27]

In July 2018, he broke the Guinness World Record for fastest time to clear a game of Hungry Hungry Hippos.[28]
