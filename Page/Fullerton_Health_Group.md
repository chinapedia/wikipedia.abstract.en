FULLERTON HEALTH is an integrated enterprise healthcare service provider founded in 2011 in Singapore.[1] The company specializes in designing customized medical services for corporate and insurer clients.[2] Fullerton Health began with an initial investment in corporate healthcare providers Gethin-Jones and Drs Trythall Hoy Davies.[3] Over the years, they grew through both organic growth and investments and mergers and acquisitions.[4]

Fullerton Health made 3 major acquisitions in 2015 which helped grow its presence in both existing and new markets. In May, their subsidiary, Global Assistance & Healthcare (GAH) acquired PT JLT GESA, more commonly known as Medilum, that provides managed healthcare and third-party administration services.[5] Later in August, they bought an 80 percent stake in Hong Kong medical provider, HMMP Limited (HMMP), for SGD$33 million.[6] Above all, the purchase of Radlink-Asia in Singapore for SGD$111.2 million[7] marked its entry into the advanced medical diagnostic imaging market and allowed it to cut costs through the digitisation of processes.[8]

As of June 30, 2016, Fullerton Health owns 198 clinics and facilities across Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia,[9] has close to 2,000 employees[10] and sees an annual revenue of more than S$300 million.[11]
