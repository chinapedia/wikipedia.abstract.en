The NEW CENTER COMMERCIAL HISTORIC DISTRICT is a commercial historic district located on Woodward Avenue between Baltimore Street and Grand Boulevard (within the New Center) in Detroit, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.[1]


History

Woodward Avenue likely began as a Native American trail, but the thoroughfare was firmly established in 1805-1806, when it was included in the master plan for rebuilding Detroit after the 1805 fire.[2] By 1820, Woodward Avenue had been improved from downtown Detroit up through Six Mile Road. By 1878, Detroit suburbs had crept up to the area that is now the New Center Commercial Historic District, and in 1878-1882, a series of subdivisions were platted in the area. Development was hastened by the construction of Grand Boulevard, which began in 1883. In 1885, the city of Detroit annexed all the land within the Grand Boulevard ring, including this district.

The intersection of two main streets - Woodward Avenue and Grand Boulevard - made a natural location for a commercial district. Commercial structures were being constructed in the area by 1884, and by 1889 the east and west sides of Woodward between Milwaukee and Baltimore were already filled with commercial structures. Some of these buildings are still extant in the district. By 1897 commercial development extended north to Grand Boulevard.[3]

Further development occurred in the district around 1915, corresponding to the rise of the automotive industry and the opening of Henry Ford Hospital a few blocks down Grand Boulevard. In 1922, General Motors began construction on a new headquarters building (the General Motors Building just one block west of this district, and in 1927 Fisher Body followed suit, beginning construction of the landmark Fisher Building. These two buildings anchored what the Fisher brothers envisioned as a new central business district - the New Center - that would relieve the congestion in Detroit's primary downtown business district. The late 1920s also saw more redevelopment in the commercial district along Woodward.[4]

In 1936-1937, Woodward Avenue was widened along almost its entire route, including through the New Center. In the process, all but two of the buildings on the west side of Woodward were demolished. The two remaining structures were shortened, with new facades added. New buildings were infilled in the early 1940s. However, the city's population began declining in the 1950s, and the New Center, along with much of the rest of the city, began a slow decline. General Motors, remaining in the area, stabilized the surrounding neighborhood, and the New Center Council, a local business organization created in 1967, ensured that the commercial district was able to survive.[5]


Description

The district contains fourteen contributing structures, as well as one non-contributing building. All structures are one to three-story commercial masonry buildings. The buildings are constructed in a range of architectural styles, including Commercial style, Neoclassical, Art Deco and Moderne. The district is representative of many of the local commercial districts in Detroit which sprung up at the intersections of major streets. However, the New Center area has retained more commercial vitality than many other neighborhood commercial districts, and the buildings within the district maintain a higher degree of integrity. Construction dates range from the late 1880s to 1942. The fifteen buildings in the district include:[6]
