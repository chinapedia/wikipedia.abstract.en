MIKLÓS VÁSÁRHELYI (9 October 1917–31 July 2001) was a dissident politician and author in communist Hungary, born in Fiume, who survived imprisonment and persecution by the old regime, and was a force for change over more than three decades.

On two notable occasions separated by more than 30 years, he played an important part in attempts to transform Hungary from a one-party communist state into a multi-party democracy.
