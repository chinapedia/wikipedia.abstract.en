ERNEST GARY GYGAX ( ; July 27, 1938 – March 4, 2008)[1] was an American game designer and author best known for co-creating the pioneering role-playing game _Dungeons & Dragons_ (_D&D_) with Dave Arneson.

In the 1960s, Gygax created an organization of wargaming clubs and founded the Gen Con gaming convention. In 1971, he helped develop _Chainmail_, a miniatures wargame based on medieval warfare. He co-founded the company Tactical Studies Rules (TSR, Inc.) with childhood friend Don Kaye in 1973. The following year, he and Arneson created _D&D_, which expanded on Gygax's _Chainmail_ and included elements of the fantasy stories he loved as a child. In the same year, he founded _The Dragon_, a magazine based around the new game. In 1977, Gygax began work on a more comprehensive version of the game, called _Advanced Dungeons & Dragons_. Gygax designed numerous manuals for the game system, as well as several pre-packaged adventures called "modules" that gave a person running a _D&D_ game (the "Dungeon Master") a rough script and ideas on how to run a particular gaming scenario. In 1983, he worked to license the _D&D_ product line into the successful _D&D_ cartoon series.

After leaving TSR in 1986 over issues with its new majority owner, Gygax continued to create role-playing game titles independently, beginning with the multi-genre _Dangerous Journeys_ in 1992. He designed another gaming system called _Lejendary Adventure_, released in 1999. In 2005, Gygax was involved in the _Castles & Crusades_ role-playing game, which was conceived as a hybrid between the third edition of _D&D_ and the original version of the game conceived by Gygax.

Gygax was married twice and had six children. In 2004, Gygax suffered two strokes, narrowly avoided a subsequent heart attack, was then diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, and died in March 2008.


Early life and inspiration

Gygax was born in Chicago, the son of Almina Emelie "Posey" (Burdick)[2] and Swiss immigrant and former Chicago Symphony Orchestra violinist Ernst Gygax.[3][4] He was named Ernest after his father, but he was commonly known as Gary, the middle name given to him by his mother after the actor Gary Cooper.[5] The family lived on Kenmore Avenue, close enough to Wrigley Field[6] that he could hear the roar of the crowds watching the Chicago Cubs play.[7] At age 7, he became a member of a small group of friends who called themselves the "Kenmore Pirates". In 1946, after the Kenmore Pirates were involved in a fracas with another gang of boys,[8] his father decided to move the family to Posey's family home in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin,[9] where Posey's family had settled in the early 19th century, and where Gary's grandparents still lived.[10][11][12]

In this new setting, Gygax soon made friends with several of his peers, including Don Kaye and Mary Jo Powell. During his childhood and teen years, he developed a love of games and an appreciation for fantasy and science fiction literature. When he was five, he played card games such as pinochle and then board games such as chess.[13][14] At the age of ten, he and his friends played the sort of make-believe games that eventually came to be called "live action role-playing games" with one of them acting as a referee.[15] His father introduced him to science fiction and fantasy through pulp novels.[16][17] His interest in games, combined with an appreciation of history, eventually led Gygax to begin playing miniature war games in 1953 with his best friend Don Kaye.[18] As teenagers Gygax and Kaye designed their own miniatures rules for toy soldiers with a large collection of and figures, where they used "ladyfingers" (small firecrackers) to simulate explosions.[19]

By the time he reached his teens, Gygax had a voracious appetite for pulp fiction authors such as Robert Howard, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, H. P. Lovecraft, and Edgar Burroughs.[20] Gygax was a mediocre student, and in 1956, a few months after his father died, dropped out of high school in his junior year.[21] He briefly joined the Marines, but after being diagnosed with walking pneumonia, was given a medical discharge and moved back home with his mother.[22] From there, he commuted to a job as a shipping clerk with Kemper Insurance Co. in Chicago. Shortly after his return, a friend introduced him to Avalon Hill's new wargame _Gettysburg_, and Gygax was soon obsessed with the game, often playing marathon sessions once a week or more.[23] It was also from Avalon Hill that he ordered the first blank hex mapping sheets that were available, which he then employed to design his own games.[24]

At about the same time that he discovered _Gettysburg_, his mother re-introduced him to Mary Jo Powell, who had left Lake Geneva as a child and had just returned. Gygax was smitten with the woman and, after a short courtship, persuaded her to marry him, despite the fact that he was only 19. This caused some friction with his best friend Don Kaye, who had also been wooing Mary Jo, to the point where Kaye refused to attend Gygax's wedding.[25] (Kaye and Gygax reconciled after the wedding.)

The young couple moved to Chicago where Gygax continued as a shipping clerk at Kemper Insurance, and also found Mary Jo a job there too. (The company laid her off when she became pregnant with their first child.) [26] He also took anthropology classes at the University of Chicago.[27][28] Gygax also volunteered as a Republican precinct captain during the 1960 presidential election, and observed many infractions by his Democratic counterpart. When he threatened to report these, he was offered a full scholarship to the University of Chicago if he kept silent. Although Gygax ultimately did not report the infractions, since he felt nothing would be done, he also did not accept the scholarship.[29]

Despite his commitments to his job, raising a family, school, and his political volunteerism, Gygax continued to play wargames. It reached the point that Mary Jo, pregnant with their second child, believed he was having an affair and confronted him in a friend's basement only to discover him and his friends sitting around a map-covered table.[30]

In 1962, Gygax got a job as an insurance underwriter at Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. His family continued to grow, and after his third child was born, he decided to move his family back to Lake Geneva.[31] Except for a few months he would spend in Clinton, Wisconsin,[32] following his divorce, and his time in Hollywood while he was the head of TSR's entertainment division, Lake Geneva would be his home for the rest of his life.

By 1966, Gygax was active in the wargame hobby world and was writing many magazine articles on the subject.[33] Gygax learned about H. G. Wells' _Little Wars_ book for play of military miniatures wargames and Fletcher Pratt's _Naval Wargame_ book. Gygax later looked for innovative ways to generate random numbers, and he used not only common, six-sided dice, but dice of all five Platonic solid shapes,[34] which he discovered in a school supply catalog.[35]

Gygax cited his influences as Robert E. Howard, L. Sprague de Camp, Jack Vance, Fletcher Pratt, Fritz Leiber, Poul Anderson, A. Merritt, and H. P. Lovecraft.[36]


Wargames

In 1967, Gygax co-founded the International Federation of Wargamers (IFW) with Bill Speer and Scott Duncan.[37] The IFW grew rapidly, especially by assimilating several pre-existing wargaming clubs, and aimed to promote interest in wargames of all periods. It provided a forum for wargamers, via its newsletters and societies, which enabled them to form local groups and share rules. In 1967, Gygax organized a 20-person gaming meet in the basement of his home; this event would later be referred to as "Gen Con 0".[38] In 1968, Gygax rented Lake Geneva's vine-covered Horticultural Hall for () to hold the first Lake Geneva Convention, also known as the Gen Con gaming convention for short.[39] Gen Con is now one of North America's largest annual hobby-game gatherings.[40] Gygax met Dave Arneson, the future co-creator of _D&D_, at the second Gen Con in August 1969.[41][42]

Together with Don Kaye, Mike Reese, and Leon Tucker, Gygax created a military miniatures society called Lake Geneva Tactical Studies Association (LGTSA) in 1970,[43] with its first headquarters in Gygax's basement.[44] Shortly thereafter in 1970, Robert Kuntz and Gygax founded the Castle & Crusade Society of the IFW.[45]

Late in October 1970, Gygax lost his job at the insurance company after almost nine years. Unemployed and now with a family of five children — Ernest ("Ernie"), Lucion ("Luke"), Heidi, Cindy, and Elise[46][47]—he tried to use his enthusiasm for games to make a living by designing board games for commercial sale. This clearly proved to be unsustainable when he only grossed $882 in 1971 ().[48] He began cobbling shoes in his basement, which provided him with a steady income and gave him more time for pursuing his interest in game development.[49] In 1971, he began doing some editing work at Guidon Games, a publisher of wargames,[50] for which he produced the board games _Alexander the Great_ and _Dunkirk: The Battle of France_. Early that same year, Gygax published _Chainmail_, a miniatures wargame that simulated medieval-era tactical combat, which he had originally written with hobby-shop owner Jeff Perren.[51][52][53] The _Chainmail_ medieval miniatures rules were originally published in the Castle & Crusade Society's fanzine _The Domesday Book_. Guidon Games hired Gygax to produce a "Wargaming with Miniatures" series of games, and a new edition of _Chainmail_ (1971) was the first book in the series.[54] The first edition of _Chainmail_ included a fantasy supplement to the rules.[55] These comprised a system for warriors, wizards, and various monsters of non-human races drawn from the works of J. R. R. Tolkien and other sources.[56] For a small publisher like Guidon Games, _Chainmail_ was relatively successful, selling 100 copies per month.[57]

Gygax also collaborated on Tractics with Mike Reese & Leon Tucker, his contribution being the change to a 20-sided spinner or a coffee can with 20 numbered poker chips (or eventually 20-sided dice) to decide combat resolutions instead of the standard 6-sided dice.[58] He also collaborated with Dave Arneson on the Napoleonic naval wargame _Don't Give Up the Ship!_[59]

Dave Arneson adopted the _Chainmail_ rules for his fantasy _Blackmoor_ campaign.[60] While visiting Lake Geneva in November 1972, Arneson ran his fantasy game using the new rules, and Gygax immediately saw the potential of role-playing games.[61][62] Gygax and Arneson immediately started to collaborate on creating "The Fantasy Game", the role-playing game which would evolve into _Dungeons & Dragons_.[63][64][65]

Two weeks after Arneson's _Blackmoor_ demonstration, Gygax had produced a 50-page set of rules, and was ready to try it on his two oldest children, Ernie and Elise, in a setting he called "Greyhawk". This group rapidly expanded to include Don Kaye, Rob Kuntz and eventually a large circle of players. Gygax sent the 50 pages of rules to his wargaming contacts and asked them to playtest the new game. Gygax and Arneson continued to trade notes about their respective campaigns, calling the amalgamation of Blackmoor and Greyhawk "The Great Kingdom". This collaboration gradually petered out as Gygax and Arneson realized their visions for the new game were diverging.[66]

Based on the feedback he received, Gygax created a 150-page revision of the rules by mid-1973. Several aspects of the system governing magic in the game were inspired by _The Dying Earth_ stories of fantasy author Jack Vance (notably the fact that _magic-users_ in the game forget the spells that they have learned immediately upon casting them, and must re-study them in order to cast them again), and the system as a whole drew upon the work of authors such as Robert E. Howard, L. Sprague de Camp, Michael Moorcock, Roger Zelazny, Poul Anderson, Tolkien, Bram Stoker, and others.[67] He asked Guidon Games to publish it,[68] but the 3-volume rule set in a labeled box was beyond the scope of the small publisher. Gygax attempted to pitch the game to Avalon Hill, but the largest company in wargaming did not understand the new concept of role-playing, and turned down his offer.[69]

By 1974, Gygax's Greyhawk group, which had started off with himself, Ernie Gygax, Don Kaye, Rob Kuntz, and Terry Kuntz, had grown to over 20 people, with Rob Kuntz becoming the co-dungeon-master so that each of them could referee groups of only a dozen players.[70]


TSR

Gygax left Guidon Games in 1973 and in October, with Don Kaye as a partner, founded Tactical Studies Rules, later known as TSR, Inc.[71][72] The two men each invested in the venture—Kaye borrowed his share on his life insurance policy—in order to finance the start-up of TSR.[73] This was still not enough to print their new role-playing game, so they tried to raise money by immediately publishing Cavaliers and Roundheads. But sales were poor, and they still did not have enough capital to publish _Dungeons & Dragons_. Worried that the other playtesters and wargamers now familiar with Gygax's rules would bring a similar product to the market first,[74] the two accepted an offer in December 1973 by game playing acquaintance Brian Blume to invest $2,000 in TSR to become an equal one-third partner.[75] (Gygax accepted Blume's offer right away. Kaye was less enthusiastic, and after a week to consider the offer, he questioned Blume closely before acquiescing.)[76] Blume's investment finally brought the financing that enabled them to publish _D&D_.[77] Gygax worked on rules for more miniatures and tabletop battle games including _Classic Warfare_ (Ancient Period: 1500 BC to 500 AD), and _Warriors of Mars_.[78]

The first commercial version of _D&D_ was released by TSR in January 1974 as a boxed set.[79] A hand-assembled print run of 1,000 copies, put together in Gygax's home,[80] sold out in less than a year.[81][82]

At the end of 1974, with sales of D&D skyrocketing, the future looked bright for Gygax and Kaye, who were only 36. However, in January 1975, Kaye unexpectedly died of a heart attack. He had not made any specific provision in his will regarding his one-third share of the company, simply leaving his entire estate to his wife Donna.[83] Although she had worked briefly for TSR as an accountant, she had not shared her husband's enthusiasm for gaming, and made it clear that she would not be having anything to do with managing the company. Gygax characterized her as "less than personable... After Don died she dumped all the Tactical Studies Rules materials off on my front porch. It would have been impossible to manage a business with her involved as a partner."[84] After Kaye's death, TSR was forced to relocate from Kaye's dining room to Gygax's basement.[85] In July 1975, Gygax and Blume reorganized their company from a partnership to a corporation called TSR Hobbies. Gygax owned 150 shares, Blume owned the other 100 shares, and both had the option to buy up to 700 shares at any time in the future. But TSR Hobbies had nothing to publish—D&D was still owned by the three-way partnership of TSR, and neither Gygax nor Blume had the money to buy out the shares owned by Kaye's wife. Blume persuaded a reluctant Gygax to allow his father, Melvin Blume, to buy Donna's shares, and those were converted to 200 shares in TSR Hobbies.[86] In addition, Brian bought another 140 shares.[87] These purchases reduced Gygax from the majority shareholder in control of the company to minority shareholder; he effectively became the Blumes' employee.[88]

Gygax wrote the supplements _Greyhawk_, _Eldritch Wizardry_, and _Swords & Spells_ for the original _D&D game_. With Brian Blume, Gygax also designed the wild west-oriented role-playing game _Boot Hill_. In the same year, Gygax created the magazine _The Strategic Review_ with himself as editor.[89] But wanting a more industry-wide periodical, he hired Tim Kask as TSR's first employee to change this magazine to the fantasy periodical _The Dragon_,[90] with Gygax as writer, columnist, and publisher (from 1978 to 1981).[91] _The Dragon_ debuted in June 1976, and Gygax commented on its success years later: "When I decided that _The Strategic Review_ was not the right vehicle, hired Tim Kask as a magazine editor for Tactical Studies Rules, and named the new publication he was to produce _The Dragon_, I thought we would eventually have a great periodical to serve gaming enthusiasts worldwide... At no time did I ever contemplate so great a success or so long a lifespan."[92]

In 1976, TSR moved out of Gygax's house into its first professional home, known as "The Dungeon Hobby Shop".[93] Dave Arneson was hired as part of the creative staff, but was let go after only ten months, another sign that Gygax and Arneson still had creative differences over D&D.[94]

_Advanced Dungeons & Dragons_ and Hollywood

The _Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set_, released in 1977, was an introductory version of the original _D&D_ geared towards new players and edited by J. Eric Holmes.[95] In the same year, TSR Hobbies released a completely new and complex version of _D&D_, _Advanced Dungeons & Dragons_ (_AD&D_). The _Monster Manual_, released later that year, became the first supplemental rule book of the new system, and many more followed.[96] The _AD&D_ rules were not fully compatible with those of the _D&D Basic Set_ and as a result, _D&D_ and _AD&D_ became distinct product lines.[97] Splitting the game lines created a further rift between Gygax and Arneson; although Arneson received a 10% royalty on sales of all _D&D_ products, Gygax refused to pay him royalties on _AD&D_ books, claiming it was a new and different property. In 1979, Arneson filed a lawsuit against TSR; it was eventually settled in March 1981 with the agreement that Arneson would receive a 2.5% royalty on all AD&D products, giving him a very comfortable six-figure annual income for the next decade.[98]

Gygax wrote the _AD&D_ hardcovers _Players Handbook_, _Dungeon Masters Guide_, _Monster Manual,_ and _Monster Manual II_. Gygax also wrote or co-wrote numerous _AD&D_ and basic _D&D_ adventure modules, including _The Keep on the Borderlands_, _Tomb of Horrors_, _Expedition to the Barrier Peaks_, _The Temple of Elemental Evil_, _The Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun_, _Mordenkainen's Fantastic Adventure_, _Isle of the Ape_, and all seven of the modules later combined into _Queen of the Spiders_. In 1980, Gygax's long-time campaign setting of Greyhawk was published in the form of the _World of Greyhawk Fantasy World Setting_ folio, which was expanded in 1983 into the _World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting_ boxed set. Sales of the _D&D_ game reached in 1980.[99] Gygax also provided assistance on the _Gamma World_ science fantasy role-playing game in 1981 and co-authored the _Gamma World_ adventure _Legion of Gold_.

In 1979, a Michigan State University student, James Dallas Egbert III, allegedly disappeared into the school's steam tunnels while playing a live-action version of _D&D_. In fact, Egbert was discovered in Louisiana several weeks later,[100] but negative mainstream media attention focused on _D&D_ as the cause. In 1982, Patricia Pulling's son killed himself. Blaming _D&D_ for her son's suicide, Pulling formed an organization named B.A.D.D. (Bothered About Dungeons & Dragons) to attack the game and the company that produced it. Gygax defended the game on a segment of _60 Minutes_,[101][102] which aired in 1985. When death threats started arriving at the TSR office, Gygax hired a bodyguard.[103][104] Despite the negative publicity, or perhaps because of it, TSR's annual _D&D_ sales increased in 1982 to ,[105] and in January 1983, _The New York Times_ speculated that _D&D_ might become "the great game of the 1980s" in the same manner that _Monopoly_ was emblematic of the Great Depression.[106]

Brian Blume persuaded Gygax to allow Brian's brother Kevin to purchase Melvin Blume's shares. This gave the Blume brothers a controlling interest,[107] and by 1981, Gygax and the Blumes were increasingly at loggerheads over management of the company. Gygax's frustrations at work, and increased prosperity from his generous royalty cheques brought a number of changes to his personal life. He and Mary Jo had been active members of the local Jehovah's Witnesses, but others in the congregation already felt uneasy about Gygax's smoking and drinking; his connection to the "satanic" game of D&D caused enough friction that the Gygaxes finally disassociated themselves from Jehovah's Witnesses.[108] Mary Jo, continuing to resent the amount of time her husband spent "playing games", had begun to drink excessively, and the couple argued frequently. Gygax, who had started smoking marijuana when he lost his insurance job in 1970, started to use cocaine, and had a number of extramarital affairs. Finally in 1983, the two had an acrimonious divorce.[109]

At the same time, the Blumes, wanting to get Gygax out of Lake Geneva so they could manage the company without his "interference", split TSR Hobbies into TSR, Inc., and TSR Entertainment, Inc. Gygax became the President of TSR Entertainment, Inc.,[110] and the Blumes sent him to Hollywood to develop TV and movie opportunities.[111] He became co-producer of the licensed _D&D_ cartoon series for CBS,[112] which led its time slot for two years.[113]

Gygax, newly single, took advantage of his time on the West Coast, renting an immense mansion, increasing his cocaine use, and spending time with several young starlets.[114]

Leaving TSR

Because he was occupied with getting a movie off the ground in Hollywood, Gygax had to leave the day-to-day operations of TSR to Kevin and Brian Blume.[115] In 1984, after months of negotiation, he reached an agreement with Orson Welles to star in a D&D movie, and John Boorman to act as producer and director. But almost at the same time, he received word that back in Lake Geneva, TSR had run into severe financial difficulties and Kevin Blume was shopping the company for .[116]

Gygax immediately discarded his movie ambitions—his _D&D_ movie would never be made—and flew back to Lake Geneva. There, he discovered to his shock that although industry leader TSR was grossing , it was barely breaking even;[117] it was in fact in debt and teetering on the edge of insolvency.[118] After investigating the reasons why, Gygax brought his findings to the five other company directors. (Since 1982, TSR Inc. had conformed to the recommendations of the American Management Association by adding three "outside" directors to the board, increasing its size to six.) Gygax charged that the financial crisis was due to mismanagement by Kevin Blume: excess inventory, overstaffing, too many company cars, and some questionable (and expensive) projects such as dredging up a 19th century shipwreck.[119] Gygax demanded that Kevin Blume be removed as company president, and the three outside directors agreed with him. However, the board still believed the financial problems were terminal and the company needed to be sold. In an effort to stay in control, in March 1985, Gygax exercised his 700-share stock option, giving him just over 50% control. He appointed himself president and CEO, and rather than selling the company, he took steps to produce new revenue generating products. To that end, he contacted Dave Arneson with a view to produce some Blackmoor material. He also bet heavily on a new AD&D book, _Unearthed Arcana_, a compilation of material culled from _Dragon_ magazine articles. And he quickly wrote a novel set in his Greyhawk setting, _Saga of Old City_, featuring a protagonist called Gord the Rogue. In order to bring some financial stability to TSR, he hired a company manager, Lorraine Williams.

When _Unearthed Arcana_ was released in July, Gygax's bet paid off, as the new book sold 90,000 copies in the first month. His novel also sold well, and he immediately published a sequel, _Artifact of Evil_. The financial crisis had been averted, but Gygax had paved the way for his own downfall. In October 1985, the new manager, Lorraine Williams, revealed that she had purchased all of the shares of Kevin and Brian Blume—after Brian had triggered his own 700-share option. Williams was now the majority shareholder, and replaced Gygax as president and CEO. She also made it clear that Gygax would be making no further creative contributions to TSR. Several of his projects were immediately shelved and never published. Gygax took TSR to court in a bid to block the Blumes' sale of their shares to Williams, but he lost.[120]

Sales of _D&D_ reached in 1985,[121] but Gygax, seeing his future at TSR as untenable,[122] resigned all positions with TSR, Inc. in October 1986, and settled his disputes with TSR in December 1986.[123] By the terms of his settlement with TSR, Gygax kept the rights to Gord the Rogue as well as all _D&D_ characters whose names were anagrams or plays on his own name (for example, Yrag and Zagyg).[124] However, he lost the rights to all his other work, including the _World of Greyhawk_ and the names of all the characters he had ever used in TSR material, such as Mordenkainen, Robilar, and Tenser.


After TSR

1985–1989: New Infinities Productions, Inc.

Immediately after leaving TSR, Gygax was approached by a wargaming acquaintance, Forrest Baker, who had done some consulting work for TSR in 1983 and 1984.[125] Gygax, who was tired of company management, was simply looking for some way to market more of his Gord the Rogue novels, but Baker had a vision for a new gaming company. He promised that he would handle the business end, while Gygax would handle the creative projects. Baker also guaranteed that, using Gygax's name, he would be able to bring in one to two million dollars of investment.[126] Gygax decided this was a good opportunity, and in October 1986, New Infinities Productions, Inc. (NIPI)[127][128] was publicly announced.[129] To help him with the creative work, Gygax poached Frank Mentzer and _Dragon_ magazine editor Kim Mohan from TSR.[130] But before a single product was released, Forrest Baker left NIPI when his promised outside investment of one to two million dollars failed to materialize.[131]

Against his will, Gygax was back in charge again; he immediately looked for a quick product to get NIPI off the ground. He had retained the rights to Gord the Rogue as part of his severance agreement with TSR, so he licensed Greyhawk from TSR and started writing new novels beginning with _Sea of Death_ (1987); sales were brisk, and Gygax's Gord the Rogue novels ended up keeping New Infinities in business.[132]

Gygax brought in Don Turnbull from Games Workshop to manage the company, then worked with Mohan and Mentzer on a science fiction-themed RPG, _Cyborg Commando_, which was published in 1987.[133] However, sales of the new game were not brisk: the game received overwhelmingly negative reception. NIPI was still dependent on Gord the Rogue.

Mentzer and Mohan also wrote a series of generic RPG adventures called _Gary Gygax Presents Fantasy Master_. They also began working on a third line of products, which began with an adventure written by Mentzer called _The Convert_ (1987); Mentzer had written the adventure as an RPGA tournament for _D&D_, but TSR was not interested in publishing it. Mentzer got verbal permission to publish it with New Infinities, but since the permission was not in writing TSR filed an injunction to prevent the adventure's sale, although the injunction was later lifted.[134][135] The legal costs further drained NIPI of capital.

During all of this drama, Gygax became a father again. Over the past year, he had formed a romantic relationship with Gail Carpenter, his former assistant at TSR. In November 1986, she gave birth to Gygax's sixth child, Alex. Biographer Michael Witwer believes the birth of Alex forced Gygax to reconsider the equation of work, gaming and family that, up until this time, had been dominated by work and gaming. "Gary, keenly aware that he had made mistakes as a father, and husband in the past, was determined not to make them again... Gary was also a realist, and knew what good fatherhood would demand, especially at his age."[136] On August 15, 1987, on what would have been his parents' 50th wedding anniversary, Gygax married Gail Carpenter.[137]

During 1987 and 1988, Gygax worked with Flint Dille on the _Sagard the Barbarian_ books,[138] as well as _Role-Playing Mastery_ and its sequel, _Master of the Game_.[139] He also wrote two more Gord the Rogue novels, _City of Hawks_ (1987), and _Come Endless Darkness_ (1988). However, by 1988, TSR had rewritten the setting for the world of Greyhawk, and Gygax was not happy with the new direction in which TSR was taking "his" creation. In a literary declaration that his old world was dead, and wanting to make a clean break with all things Greyhawk, Gygax destroyed his version of Oerth in the final Gord the Rogue novel, _Dance of Demons_.[140]

With the Gord the Rogue novels finished, NIPI's main source of steady income dried up. The company needed a new product. Gygax announced in 1988 in a company newsletter that he and Rob Kuntz, his co-Dungeon Master during the early days of the Greyhawk campaign, were working as a team again. This time they would create a new multi-genre fantasy RPG called "Infinite Adventures", which would be supported by different gamebooks for different genres.[141] This line would detail the Castle and City of Greyhawk as Gygax and Kuntz had originally envisioned them, now called "Castle Dunfalcon".[142]

However, before work on this project could commence, NIPI ran out of money, was forced into bankruptcy, and was dissolved in 1989.[143]

1990–1994: _Dangerous Journeys_

After NIPI folded, Gygax decided to create an entirely new RPG called _The Carpenter Project_,[144] one considerably more complex and "rule heavy" than his original and relatively simple _D&D_ system, which had been encompassed by a mere 150 typewritten pages.[145] He also wanted to create a horror setting for the new RPG called _Unhallowed_. He began working on the RPG and the setting with the help of games designer Mike McCulley.[146] Game Designers Workshop became interested in publishing the new system, and it also drew the attention of JVC and NEC, who were looking for a new RPG system and setting to turn into a series of computer games.[147] NEC and JVC were not interested in horror though, and work on the _Unhallowed_ setting was shelved in favour of a fantasy setting called _Mythus_. JVC also wanted a name change for the RPG, favoring _Dangerous Dimensions_ over _The Carpenter Project_.[148] Work progressed favourably until March 1992, when TSR filed an injunction against _Dangerous Dimensions_, claiming the name and initials were too similar to _Dungeons & Dragons_. Gygax, with the approval of NEC and JVC, quickly changed the name to _Dangerous Journeys_,[149] and work on the new game continued.

The marketing strategy for _Dangerous Journeys: Mythus_ was multi-pronged: in addition to the RPG and setting to be published by Games Designers Workshop, and the _Mythus_ computer game being prepared by NEC and JVC, there would also be a series of books based on the Mythus setting written by Gygax. So in addition to his work on the RPG and the _Mythus_ setting, Gygax wrote three novels, released under publisher Penguin/Roc and later reprinted by Paizo Publishing: _The Anubis Murders_, _The Samarkand Solution_, and _Death in Delhi_.

In late 1992, the _Dangerous Journeys_ RPG was released by Games Designer Workshop,[150][151] but TSR immediately applied for an injunction against the entire _Dangerous Journeys_ RPG and the _Mythus_ setting, arguing that _Dangerous Journeys_ was based on _D&D_ and _AD&D_. Although the injunction failed, TSR moved forward with litigation. Gygax believed the legal action was without merit and fuelled by Lorraine Williams' personal enmity,[152] but NEC and JVC both withdrew from the project, killing the _Mythus_ computer game.[153] By 1994, the legal costs associated with many months of pretrial discovery had drained all of Gygax's resources; believing that TSR was also suffering, Gygax offered to settle. In the end, TSR paid Gygax for the complete rights to _Dangerous Journeys_ and _Mythus_.[154] Although Gygax was well compensated for his years of work on _Dangerous Journeys_ and _Mythus_, TSR immediately and permanently shelved them both.

1995–2000: _Lejendary Adventures_

Gary_Gyax_-_ModCon_1999_-_1.jpg, Italy. His t-shirt advertises the third edition of _D&D_, which was to be released the following year.]] In 1995, Gygax began work on a new computer role-playing game called _Lejendary Adventures_.[155] In contrast to the rules-heavy _Dangerous Journeys_, this new system was a return to simple and basic rules. Although he was not able to successfully release a _Lejendary Adventures_ computer game, Gygax decided to instead publish it as a tabletop game.[156]

Meanwhile, in 1996 the games industry was rocked by the news that TSR had run into insoluble financial problems and had been bought by Wizards of the Coast. While WotC was busy refocussing TSR's products, Christopher Clark of Inner City Games Designs approached Gygax in 1997 to suggest that they produce some adventures to sell in game stores while TSR was otherwise occupied; the result was a pair of fantasy adventures published by Inner City Games: _A Challenge of Arms_ (1998) and _The Ritual of the Golden Eyes_ (1999).[157] Gygax introduced some investors to Clark's publication setup, and although the investors were not willing to fund publication of _Legendary Adventures_, Clark and Gygax formed a partnership called Hekaforge Productions.[158] Gygax was thus able to return to publish _Lejendary Adventures_ in 1999.[159] The game was published as a three-volume set: _The Lejendary Rules for All Players_ (1999), _Lejend Master's Lore_ (2000) and _Beasts of Lejend_ (2000).[160]

The new owner of TSR, WotC's Peter Adkison, clearly did not harbor any of Lorraine Williams' ill-will toward Gygax: Adkison purchased all of Gygax's residual rights to D&D and AD&D for a six-figure sum.[161] Although Gygax did not write any new supplements or books for TSR or WotC, he did agree to write the preface to the 1998 adventure _Return to the Tomb of Horrors_, a paean to Gygax's original AD&D adventure _Tomb of Horrors_.[162] He also returned to the pages of Dragon Magazine, writing the "Up on a Soapbox" column from Issue #268 (January, 2000) to Issue #320 (June, 2004).[163]

2000–2008: Later works and death

Gygax continued to work on _Lejendary Adventures_ which he believed was his best work. However, sales were below expectation.[164]

On June 11, 2001, Stephen Chenault and Davis Chenault of Troll Lord Games announced that Gygax would be writing books for their company.[165] Gygax's early work for Troll Lord included a series of hardcover books that eventually came to be called "Gygaxian Fantasy Worlds"; the first was _The Canting Crew_ (2002), a look at the roguish underworld. He also wrote _World Builder_ (2003) and _Living Fantasy_ (2003), generic game design books usable in many different settings. After the first four books in the series, Gygax stepped down from writing and took on an advisory role, though the series logo still carried his name.[166] Troll Lord also published a few adventures as a result of their partnership with Gygax, including _The Hermit_ (2002) an adventure intended for d20 and also for _Lejendary Adventures_.[167]

By 2002, Gygax had given Christopher Clark of Hekaforge an encyclopaedic 72,000-word text describing the Lejendary Earth. Clark split the manuscript up into five books and expanded it, with each of the final books coming to about 128,000 words, giving Hekaforge a third Lejendary Adventures line to supplement the core rules and adventures. Hekaforge managed to publish the first two of those Lejendary Earth sourcebooks, _Gazetteer_ (2002) and _Noble Kings and Great Lands_ (2003),[168] but by 2003 the small company was having financial difficulties. Clark to ask Troll Lord Games to become an "angel" investor by publishing the three remaining _Lejendary Adventures_ books.[169]

On October 9, 2001, Necromancer Games announced that they would be publishing a d20 version of _Necropolis_, an adventure originally planned by Gygax for New Infinities Productions and later printed in 1992 as a _Mythus_ adventure by GDW; _Gary Gygax's Necropolis_ was published a year later.[170]

Gygax also performed voiceover narration for cartoons and video games. In 2000, he voiced his own cartoon self for an episode of Futurama, "Anthology of Interest I"[171][172] that also included the voices of Al Gore, Stephen Hawking and Nichelle Nichols.[173] Gygax also performed as a guest Dungeon Master in the Delera's Tomb quest series of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game _Dungeons & Dragons Online: Stormreach_.[174]

He is sitting in the Troll Lord Games booth with Stephen Chenault.]] During his time with TSR, Gygax had often mentioned the mysterious Castle Greyhawk which formed the centre of his own home campaign. But despite all of his written output over the previous 30 years, Gygax had never published details of the castle. In 2003, Gygax announced that he was again partnering with Rob Kuntz to publish the original and previously unpublished details of Castle Greyhawk and the City of Greyhawk in 6 volumes, although the project would use the rules for _Castles and Crusades_ rather than _D&D_. As Gygax wrote in an on-line forum: "I have laid out a new schematic of castle and dungeon levels based on both my original design of 13 levels plus side adjuncts, and the 'New Greyhawk Castle' that resulted when Rob and I combined our efforts and added a lot of new levels too. From that Rob will draft the level plans for the newest version of the work. Meantime, I am collecting all the most salient feature, encounters, tricks, traps, etc. for inclusion on the various levels. So the end result will be what is essentially the best of our old work in a coherent presentation usable by all DMs, the material having all the known and yet to be discussed features of the original work that are outstanding... I hope."[175] Since Wizards of the Coast, which had bought TSR in 1997, still owned the rights to the name "Greyhawk", Gygax changed the name of Castle Greyhawk to "Castle Zagyg", a reverse homophone of his own name, and also changed the name of the nearby city to "Yggsburgh", a play on his initials "E.G.G."[176]

The scale of the project was enormous: By the time Gygax and Kuntz had stopped working on their original home campaign, the castle dungeons had encompassed 50 levels of cunningly complex passages with thousands of rooms and traps. This, plus plans for the city of Yggsburgh and encounter areas outside the castle and city, would clearly be too much to fit into the proposed 6 volumes. Gygax decided he would compress the castle dungeons into 13 levels, the size of his original Castle Greyhawk in 1973[177] by amalgamating the best of what could be gleaned from binders and boxes of old notes.[178] However, neither Gygax nor Kuntz had kept careful or comprehensive plans. Because they had often made up details of play sessions on the spot,[179] they usually just scribbled a quick map as they played, with cursory notes about monsters, treasures, and traps.[180] These sketchy maps had contained just enough detail that the two could ensure their independent work would dovetail. All of these old notes now had to be deciphered, 25-year-old memories dredged up as to what had happened in each room, and a decision made whether to keep or discard each new piece.[181] Recreating the city too would be a challenge. Although Gygax still had his old maps of the original city, all of his previously published work on the city was owned by WotC, so he would have to create most of the city from scratch while still maintaining the "look and feel" of his original.[182]

Due to creative differences, Kuntz backed out of the project, but created an adventure module that would be published at the same time as Gygax's first book.[183] Gygax continued to painstakingly put Castle Zagyg together on his own, but even this slow and laborious process came to a complete halt when Gygax suffered a serious stroke in April 2004 and then another one a few weeks later.[184] Although he returned to his keyboard after a seven-month convalescence, his output was reduced from 14-hour work days to only one or two hours per day.[185] Finally in 2005, _Castle Zagyg Part I: Yggsburgh_, the first book in the six-book series, appeared.[186] Later that year, Troll Lord Games also published _Castle Zagyg: Dark Chateau_ (2005), the adventure module written for the Yggsburgh setting by Rob Kuntz.[187] Jeff Talanian helped with the creation of the dungeon, eventually resulting in publication of the limited edition _CZ9: The East Marks Gazetteer_ (2007).[188]

That same year, Gygax was diagnosed with a potentially deadly abdominal aortic aneurysm. Doctors concurred that surgery was needed, but their estimates of success varied from 50% to 90%. With no firm medical consensus, Gygax came to believe that he would likely die on the operating table; he refused to consider surgery, although he realized that a rupture of the aneurysm – likely inevitable – would be fatal.[189] In one concession to his condition, he switched from cigarettes, which he had smoked since high school, to cigars.[190]

It wasn't until 2008 that Gygax was able to finish the second volume of six volumes, _Castle Zagyg: The Upper Works_, which described details of the castle above ground. The next two volumes were supposed to detail the dungeons beneath Castle Zagyg. However, before they could be written, Gygax died in March 2008. Three months after his death, Gygax Games – a new company formed by Gary's widow, Gail – withdrew all of the Gygax licenses from Troll Lord,[191] and also from Hekaforge.[192]


Personal life

From an early age, Gygax hunted and was a target-shooter with both bow and gun.[193] He was also an avid gun collector, and at various times owned a variety of rifles, shotguns, and handguns.[194]

[140] Q: "After you left TSR, you finished the Gord the Rogue books. At the end of the cycle, Oerth bites the bullet. Was this your way of saying that Greyhawk is dead and that fans should turn away from TSR's version with disdain?" Gygax: "More my way of saying that since T$R had killed the setting with trash releases, it was time to wipe out the shame by obliterating the setting."

[154] Gygax: "When the new [fantasy roleplaying game] was introduced at the GTS, a lawsuit was filed by TSR, they claiming it violated the copyright of AD&D. Quite a stretch that, but only a judge intimately familiar with RPGs would know that and dismiss it. So what followed was a long period of discovery and depositions that ran up a huge lawyers' bill—far more on the TSR end than on ours, four to one is likely. Eventually the suit was settled. TSR paid us a very large sum and they got all the rights to the DJ system and Mythus. I suggested to TSR (Lorraine Williams) that the next time I wrote a new RPG they just offer me for the rights to it, thus saving at least that much money."

[177] Gygax: "The whole of the combined material Rob and I put together would be far too large for publication, 50 levels or so. What I have done is gone back to my original design of more modest scope, because I doubt the work will need to accommodate groups of 20 PCs delving on a daily basis."

[178] Gygax: "...the original upper and lower parts of Castle Greyhawk changed many times over the years they were in active use. What we will do is to take the best of the lot and put that into a detailed format usable by anyone."

[179] Gygax: "I did indeed create details for the PC party on the spot, adding whatever seemed appropriate, and as Rob played and learned from me, he did the same, and when we were actively co-DMing we could often create some really exciting material on the spot, if you will."

[180] Gygax: "As Rob learned from me, he too DMed by the proverbial seat of the pants method. A single line of notes for an encounter was sufficient for either of us to detail a lengthy description, action, dialog, tricks or traps, and all the rest."

[181] Gygax: "What our challenge is going to be is to cull the extraneous, take the best, and re-create the details we made up on the spot. Of course the most famous things will be there, along with most of the best parts that are not well-known through story and word of mouth."

[182] Gygax: "Yggsburgh was a pain in the rump to write because I wanted to include as much detail as possible for the GM interested in using it as a campaign base. So there are sections on history, costume, monetary system and economy of the area, and complete descriptions of the town, its main locations, and the outstanding geographical areas all with encounters or suggestions for same."

[183] Gygax: "Rob has finished his add on module, but I have not been up to doing the work needed to create the upper works of the castle proper, let alone the dungeon levels below them."

[184]

[185] Gygax: "the problem is that I tire out after about an hour."

[193] Gygax: "I got my first BB pistol when I was about 10, a Daisy BB gun when I was 11, and my first .22 rifle, a single-shot, bolt action Winchester for my 12th birthday—thanks to my grandfather, for mother was not keen on that. I loved plinking and hunting, and how badly I wanted a .25 lever action carbine I used to gaze at in the local Gamble's store is difficult to express in words. Never did get it. I did get a fine lemonwood bow made by Bear Archery, though. It had only a 38-pound pull, so my range was only about 120 yards with a hunting arrow."

[194] Gygax: "Yes I own a number of handguns and shoulder weapons... over the next few years I did add several more .22 rifles, a bolt-action, three shot Mossberg 16 gauge shotgun, a old single-barreled 12 gauge, and a .32 pistol. The rifles were used for squirrel, rabbit, and varmint hunting, the shotguns for pheasants, ducks, and geese, and the revolver for target shooting. In later years I got rid of the old weapons, added a 7.62 Argentine Mauser, a 30–30 carbine, and various other rifles, shotguns, and quite a few handguns. Years later, when I used to get death threats because of D&D I always had a .357, 9 mm, or .45 caliber pistol handy. If those were too conspicuous, a little .32, .25, or .22 derringer from Defender Arms was around. Sure glad I didn't need to use them...."
