Reception

Critical response

_That's Not Me_ has been met with positive reviews, and holds a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 87%.[8]

Luke Buckmaster of The Guardian gave the film four stars, writing "An outstanding performance from emerging actor Alice Foulcher takes this lean and plucky film about stymied ambition to another level. A young and spunky cast and crew have installed in this smart and sassy dramedy a highly disciplined, tonally cohesive style. It is refreshing to see that kind of storytelling discipline particularly from a first-time film-maker."[9]

Junkee Media called the film an "An emotionally resonant and comedic quarter life crisis… It’s a simple set-up delivered endlessly in comedy, but managed so well in _That's Not Me_ that you remember how rare it is that balance is achieved in Australian films."[10] The Sydney Arts Guide praised the film and performances, writing: _"_There’s not a dud note in _That's Not Me_ thanks to a solid foundation in a script by Alice Foulcher and Gregory Erdstein, and anchored by a winning lead performance by Foulcher and helmed with an assured hand by Erdstein. The support casting is impeccable…Isabel Lucas is ferociously good".[11] Jake Watt of Switch called the film "a marvel of indie ingenuity, with dollops of charm and confident direction."[12] Karl Quinn writing for The Age said the film is "bursting with comedy, humanity and interesting ideas",[13] the Huffington Post called it "a stunning exploration of identity, the industry and the thirst for fame…the perfect blend of comedy and tragedy”,[14] whilst Concrete Playground praised it as "earnest, astute, insightful and thoroughly amusing. This is a movie that is both universal and unmistakably Australian – and that’s just one of many delicate balancing acts that That’s Not Me achieves".[15]

Louise of Urban Cinefile writes that "Foulcher is a knockout. She is unselfconscious and instantly likeable. Sibling rivalry, celebrity and chasing dreams have never been so much fun in this energetic, uplifting character-driven comedy that soars as surely as the trajectory of its irresistible star”.[16] Time Out gave the film four stars, with critic Nick Dent writing "Alice Foulcher deserves to be a lock for Best Actress [for the 2017 AACTA awards].[17] [She] conveys low self-esteem with the comedic flair of a Kristin Wiig."[18] Andy Howell of Ain't It Cool writes “[Alice Foulcher] shoulders all the drama and gives one of the best twin performances I’ve ever seen... Having nuanced drama embedded in a comedy is a tightrope walk, but she’s got the skills to land it.”[19] Leigh Paatsch of the Herald Sun gave the film a positive review, noting "a wonderful performance by Foulcher in a deceptively demanding role".[20] Film Alert 101 suggests that Foulcher "may well be the comic talent of her age",[21] and radio station 2ser 107.3 describes her as "absolutely superb throughout".[22]

The film was also flagged by the Santa Barbara Independent as a Must-See Pick of the Santa Barbara International Film Festival,[23] and sold out a number of sessions at the festival.[24]
