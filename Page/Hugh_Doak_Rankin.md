EllenHughRankinCopp.tif Weird_Tales_October_1929.jpg HUGH DOAK RANKIN, born HUGH DEARBORN COPP (July 2, 1878— January 3, 1956) was an American artist who illustrated the science fiction magazine _Weird Tales_ in the 1920s and 1930s.


Early life

Hugh Dearborn Copp was born in Loda, Illinois, the only surviving son of William H. Copp and Ellen Rankin Copp. His mother was a sculptor.[1] His great-grandparents Jean Lowry Rankin and John Rankin were noted abolitionists and hosts on the Underground Railroad in Ohio. When his parents separated, Ellen and Hugh went to live in Munich and study art.[2] He began using his mother's surname as a young adult, after his parents' separation. He served in the United States Army during World War I.


Career

Hugh Copp got an early start as an exhibiting artist; as a teenager, his panel sculpture of "brownies" racing through hurdles was displayed in the children's room of the Women's Building at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.[3] After the Exposition, he was granted $300 to continue his art studies.[4]

As an adult, Hugh Rankin started making illustrations for newspapers in Ohio and Chicago, before World War I. He was best known for his covers and interior illustrations for _Weird Tales_ beginning in 1927.[5] Sometimes he signed his work "H. R." or using his middle name only, as "DOAK." He illustrated works by authors E. Hoffmann Price, Edmond Hamilton[6] and Robert E. Howard.[7]

It was primarily the nature of Rankin's artwork for _Weird Tales_ covers which made young Robert Bloch's parents disapprove of the magazine, causing Bloch to cease reading it from 1928-1931, until he resumed reading it in 1932.

Rankin's style was called "strange, imaginative – if almost abstract — art-deco work" by a nostalgic fan many years later.[8] He also copyrighted a children's toy, the "Ziggity-zoo", which involved "drawings of animals with interchangeable heads."[9]


Personal life

He lived with his maternal grandmother Susanna Rankin, his mother's sister, Louisa, and her husband Paul E. Hermes, in Chicago after his mother's death, and later in adulthood in Los Angeles, California, where he was still living at the time of his death in 1956, aged 77 years. As a World War I veteran, his remains were buried in the Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego, California. His name was also added to his mother's tombstone in Logan County, Illinois.
