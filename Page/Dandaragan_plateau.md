DANDARAGAN PLATEAU is a feature between the Darling Scarp and Gingin scarp in Western Australia.

Dandaragan locality and Shire of Dandaragan council of the same name occur on the plateau.[1]

The integrity of the Boonanarring reserve on the plateau is notable due to its sustaining animals that are lost on the Swan Coastal Plain[2]

The geology and flora of the plateau has been studied and reported for some time[3]
