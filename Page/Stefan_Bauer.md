STEFAN BAUER is a Lecturer in Early Modern History at the University of York.[1] He completed his Habilitation at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, in 2018 and obtained the _venia legendi_ in Early Modern History with the title of Privatdozent. Bauer has published widely on the religious and intellectual history of Europe. His first monograph on Jacob Burckhardt came out in 2001.[2] It received numerous reviews, for instance by the classical scholar Hugh Lloyd-Jones in _English Historical Review_.[3] The political scientist Wilhelm Hennis referred to it as "fabulously learned"[4] and the historian Peter Funke as "an outstanding achievement in the history of science".[5] Bauer's study on the censorship of the _Lives of Popes_ by Platina was published in 2006.[6] The _Sixteenth Century Journal_ noted that "Stefan Bauer has produced a scholarly tool essential for investigating the intersection of late-Renaissance ideas and practices with those of the Catholic Reformation".[7] _Renaissance Quarterly_ judged his work to be "an excellent book on an important humanist, his rewriting of papal history, and the reception and censorship of this highly influential and often scandalous work".[8] Bauer is a Fellow both of the Royal Historical Society (FRHistS)[9] and the Higher Education Academy (FHEA).[10] His most recent research project, for which Bauer has received funding from the European Commission, is entitled "History and Theology: the Creation of Disinterested Scholarship from Dogmatic Stalemate".[11] Two exhibitions connected to this project, "The Art of Disagreeing Badly: Religious Dispute in Early Modern Europe", were opened at an interfaith event at the York Minster Library on 15 November 2016 and at the Middle Temple Library in London on 3 July 2017.[12] Bauer is also the UK Chair of the Marie Curie Alumni Association.[13]
