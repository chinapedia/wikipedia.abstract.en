San_Diego,_2016_-_143.jpg San_Diego,_2016_-_144.jpg The TIVOLI BAR AND GRILL is the oldest bar in San Diego, California, located at 505 Sixth Ave. in the Gaslamp Quarter.[1] It opened as a saloon in 1885.[2][3]

Between 1872 and 1885, the building housed a boarding house, a feed store, and a blacksmith shop,[4] and the nine apartments above the bar were once used as a brothel.[5]

The bar retains its original wooden bar and back bar, and the first cash register to be installed is still on display.[6] Wyatt Earp was once a regular at the bar.[7]
