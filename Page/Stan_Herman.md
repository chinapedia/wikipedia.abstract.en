STAN HERMAN is an American designer.


Early life

Stan Herman was born in Brooklyn, New York,[1] and grew up in Passaic.[2] He attended the University of Cincinnati,[3] where he graduated in 1950 from the school's College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning.[4][5] Herman then served in the United States Army during the Korean War.[6]

After the war, Herman moved to New York City. Fired from his first fashion design job, he worked in Broadway theatre at night while designing part-time during the day. He left show business to pursue fashion full-time after launching his first collection, which _Women's Wear Daily_ declared an unqualified success. Herman then became head designer for ready-to-wear company Mr. Mort on Seventh Avenue.[7][8][9]


Career

Herman first designed a uniform after a request from the president of the Avis car rental company. He has since designed uniforms for many well-known companies such as Amtrak, Federal Express, JetBlue, Loews Hotels & Resorts, McDonald's, Trans World Airlines (TWA) and United Airlines.[10]

He served as president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA)[11] from 1991 to 2006.[12][13] In 1993, Herman and CFDA executive director Fern Mallis consolidated the events known as New York Fashion Week by staging them in white tents in Bryant Park, branding it as "7th on Sixth".[14][15]

Herman has designed a loungewear and sleepwear collection for QVC since 1993.[16][17][18]

Herman won three Coty Awards,[19] between 1969 and 1974.[20]

In 2006, Herman was awarded the Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award by the CFDA.[21]
