MISS EARTH MALAYSIA is an annual national beauty pageant held in Malaysia to select representatives for the Miss Earth pageant. It is the only beauty pageant in Malaysia that has the focus on educating and empowering women and others about the knowledge of natural beauty, sustainability and eco-tourism. The pageant serves as a platform to educate the contestants about the environmental issues, promote eco-tourism and create a healthy aspect of cordial relationship among the participants

In 2019, Miss Earth Malaysia organizers decided no longer to conduct the bikini section during the national competition so it could give opportunity for Muslim women in Malaysia to participate in the pageant for the first time since 2001. Still there will be a swimsuit round in the Miss Earth pageant.

The winner of the pageant is bestowed the title Miss Earth Malaysia and get to represent Malaysia in the International Finals. Her runners-up are given the titles named after the other natural elements namely:

-   Miss Malaysia Air (first runner-up),
-   Miss Malaysia Water (second runner-up),
-   Miss Malaysia Fire (equivalent to third runner-up), and
-   Miss Eco-Tourism
-   Miss Eco-Beauty

The reigning Miss Earth Malaysia is Jasmine Yeo from Sarawak. She was appointed as the winner o give way for a smooth transition from the old franchise holder to the current one, Manoy Handicraft.[1]
