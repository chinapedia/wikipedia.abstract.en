In 2006 a splinter group from National Clarion Cycling Club called National Clarion Cycling Club 1895 North Lancs Union was formed to preserve the history and principles of the Club. In November 2017 National Clarion Cycling Club invited Clarion 1895 to join it as a section. However, in February 2018 it retracted that offer without valid reason.[1]


Purpose

National Clarion Cycling Club 1895 (North Lancs Union) is a politically active cycling club[2][3] that remains committed to the objectives of the founders of the Clarion Cycling Club in 1894 namely NCCC1895(NLU) was formed to ensure that the Clarion's century old link with Socialism is maintained and the fight to achieve the fairer society the founders sought is never forgotten. From its inception in 1894 the Clarion Cycling Club was a politically active organisation and by maintaining a commitment to socialist principles and actively supporting their comrades in the Labour and Trade Union Movement, NCCC1895 are following in the footsteps of the founders of the first Clarion Cycle Club in Birmingham (1894). Tom Groom, the Club's first National Secretary wrote shortly before his death in 1945 National Clarion CC 1895 stands firmly by the Clarion motto of old: 'Socialism: the Hope of the World', the Socialist Ten Commandments and the fight for a new society with Love as its Law and Justice its Foundation.
