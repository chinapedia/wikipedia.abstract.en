_REALLY BAD CHESS_ (stylized as _REALLY BAD CHESS_) is a mobile video game developed by Zach Gage. It was released on October 13, 2016 for iOS, with a version for Android released in May 2017.[1] The game is based on the original game of chess but contains rearranged boards.


Gameplay

_Really Bad Chess_ is played using a normal chess board, but with each player given one king and 15 other pieces selected at random based on the player's skill level.[2] The pieces, moves, and goal are identical to the original game.[3] Because of the rearranged pieces, players cannot use typical chess opening moves.[4] Unlike in standard chess, in _Really Bad Chess_ there are no draws: a stalemated player loses the game, and no draws can be claimed for reasons such as threefold repetition. As such, the game does not end when only the kings remain.


Development

_Really Bad Chess_ was developed by Zach Gage, the developer behind the 2015 solitaire mobile game _Sage Solitaire_.[5][6][7] The game was released on October 13, 2016 for iOS devices.[8] Some players have reported stability issues when playing the game.[9] A port for Android, produced by Noodlecake Studios, was released in May 2017.[10]


Reception

Stephen Totilo of video game news site _Kotaku_ recommended the game to those with an iPhone because though he doesn't "care for chess", he enjoyed playing it.[11] Rob Funnell of mobile gaming site _TouchArcade_ awarded the game a 5/5 rating and said the game turns the "mundane task of learning chess into an extremely enjoyable experience".[12]

Reviewers thought the game would be good for helping newer and more experienced chess players learn how the game works. Funnell believed _Really Bad Chess_ was a good way for new players and chess veterans to learn how to understand chess, and eventually become better at the game through learning how to "read the board".[13] Prior to release, Emma Kidwell of _Kill Screen_ said the game "should be great for beginners to learn about the joy of landing a checkmate without having to study openings".[14]
