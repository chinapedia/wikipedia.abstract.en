Sundarrajan) accommodate him in their house. There, Ashok meets Damayanthi (Rukma), daughter of the wealthiest man in the village : Sundar (Mohan Natarajan). They fall in love with each other. When Damayanthi's father Sundar arranges Damayanthi's wedding with a rich bride, Ashok is heart-broken. The couples decide to get secretly married in a small temple far from the village. After tying the thaali around Damayanthi's neck, he removes himself from the knot. Damayanthi runs away crying. The entire scene is recorded by a hidden camera and Ashok then sends the videotape of the scene to Damayanthi's father. Ashok vanishes from the village and he starts to blackmail Sundar.
