"WE GOT LOVE" is a song co-written by Lynsey de Paul and Terry Britten.[1][2] It was recorded by The Real Thing,[3] and released as a single in 1984 as their first single on the RCA label,[4] as well as being released as a 12 inch extended version and dub mix.[5] It was produced by the American R&B producer, Nick Martinelli for Watchout Productions Inc with rhythm arrangement by Donald Robinson.[6] The single was engineered by Bruce Weedon. The B-side of the single was a song called "Street Scene".[7] The song garnered media interest and became a dance floor hit,[8][9][10][11] and is listed on the Internet Channel Radio's Euro Hits Dance 80's, together with a short sample of the song.[12]

The song was play-listed by a number of European radio stations such as Radio Piccadilly, the first commercial radio station in Manchester (now Greatest Hits Manchester),[13] and is still played on radio, more recently by the DJ Richard Marzetti on his _Soul Life_ programme on Solar Radio, a radio station which traces its roots back to Radio Invicta,[14] as well as on FunkURadio.[15]

De Paul released her own funky, jazzed up version of the song[16] as a track on her 1994 re-invention album, _Just a Little Time_.[17] According to de Paul's official internet site, the British 1980s soul group Imagination may have also recorded a version of the song.[18][19]
