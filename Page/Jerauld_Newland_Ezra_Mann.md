JERAULD NEWLAND EZRA MANN (June 26, 1796 - April 15, 1857[1]) was sheriff of Norfolk County, Massachusetts from 1843 to 1848.[2][3][4]

Mann was born in Medfield, Massachusetts on June 26, 1796.[5] Mann learned the trade of a carriage painter from Messrs Bird of Walpole.[6] In 1823 he went to Easton where he remained but a short time, removing the year following to Taunton where he remained five years.[7] He then went to Wrentham and thence to Dedham where he took the place of his brother-in-law, Major TP Whitney, as Deputy Sheriff and Jailer.[8]

On the death of Sheriff John Baker II, Mann was appointed Sheriff on February 8, 1843 for a term of five years.[9] At the end of his term he declined a reappointment, but continued to act as Deputy Sheriff and Jailer until July 1855 when failing health compelled his resignation.[10] Mann soon after removed to Vernon, Connecticut the residence of his youngest daughter.[11] He died there on April 15, 1857.[12]

Mann's portrait is in the collection of the Dedham Historical Society.[13][14]
