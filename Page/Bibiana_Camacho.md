Literary analysis

Bibiana Camacho traces a thin line between the reality and fiction in stories in which their characters wander in a supposedly endless monotony. Her stories present symbols through which the physical represents the emotional with a perversive touch and a moral covering. Moreover, she shows a reality with fantastic touches where the human relations are sullied and easily modified. Such an oppression emerged from a moral and powered world[5]

Bibiana presents a reality through a type of fantasy where the human relations are easily modified. She also writes about an oppressed world based in morality and power that would easily trigger into madness with a minute show of change in the human survival.[6]

In _Tu ropa en mi armario_, a collection of nightmares, Erika must fight with the owners of the building, some old creatures that she does not know if they are humans. He hears the noises of his house until he listens one he does not recognize. Claudia looks for a place where she can stay the night and asks for asylum to some decadent elders. In “_La gotera_” (The Leakage) there is an apartment that changes its interior every 24 hours. The stories of _Tu ropa en mi armario_ are an exploration to the intruder, the one that comes to deform our reality. In each story of this book there is a stranger whose intentions are not very clear and, in most of the times are not good ones.[7]

_La Sonámbula_, the second book of stories of Bibiana Camacho, runs scenarios where every kind of losses and disencounters happen. Their stories delve into the land of the underworld and the fantastic turns shine the everyday at the time that warn the man about the apocalypse well deserved but mysterious.[8]

With _Tras las huellas de mi olvido_, the conviction of having lost a memory that could have saved the people's lives is explored to its last consequences for Bibiana Camacho. Threatened by a terrible crime, the protagonist decides to travel Mexico City downtown as one who examins its recent memory.[9]

Her stories are included in the anthology Ciudad fantasma & Avisos clasificados, both from 2013.[10]
