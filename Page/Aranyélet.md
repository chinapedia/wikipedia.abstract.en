Reception

Critical reception

_Aranyélet_ has received widespread critical acclaim and has been praised by many critics as the greatest Hungarian television show of all time. On IMDb, it holds a rating of 9/10, making it the highest rated television series produced by HBO Europe.

After the first season, IGN Hungary wrote "_Aranyélet_ is not just the best Hungarian television series ever made, but it is also one of HBO's best thrillers. It is characterized by steadily high-quality acting and creative work, a great plot and perfect way of storytelling, not to mention the unforgattable characters, who are defined by our problems, our narrow-mindedness, and our country. Be very proud of them." Player.hu wrote "Without doubt, HBO's original crime family drama seems to be the best Hungarian series, every actor is a perfect choice, it looks good, and tells the story in an excellent way. What's more, it is quite addictive."

The second season met with positive critical reception as well, IGN Hungary described the season as "more exciting, crazier, darker, has more plot twists, but it is more human than the first season. In conclusion despite the exaggerations and being too action-packed sometimes, it is still a masterpiece, which makes our expectations even higher for the next round."

Season 3 met mixed reviews - critics praised the season's political themes, acting, and being even more reflective on Hungarian politics and corruption in general, while many criticizing the plot, character development and the ending. Judit Lola Bodnár from 24.hu wrote "[…] the final season of _Aranyélet_ knows no mercy: it reflects [the Hungarian reality] so much, that only those won't see the country in it who live in total ignorance." Tamás Hauschel from Player.hu wrote "The third season of _Aranyélet_ was the best thing that could happen to Hungarian television.", while Zsolt Sarkadi from 444.hu wrote "HBO's once promising series turned into the most shameless garbage".
