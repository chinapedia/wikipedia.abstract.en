Career

Erdstein is a graduate of the Victorian College of the Arts, School of Film & TV, Melbourne, Australia.

Erdstein has collaborated with his wife, actress/writer Alice Foulcher, on several films including the controversial short film _Picking up at Auschwitz_,[1] the Tropfest finalist short _A Bit Rich_[2] and _Paris Syndrome_.[3] They spent most of 2014 as artists in residence at the Cité internationale des arts in Paris, France, where they made _Paris Syndrome_, and co-wrote the screenplay for their first feature film, _That's Not Me_.[4]

In 2014 also co-wrote and co-directed the short film _Two Devils_, with _Van Diemen's Land_ director Jonathan auf der Heide. It premiered at the 2014 Melbourne International Film Festival.[5]

In 2015 Erdstein commenced production on his debut feature, _That's Not Me_, which filmed in Melbourne, Australia and Los Angeles, USA.[6] The film will had its World Premiere in February 2017 at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival,[7] and Australian Premiere in June 2017 at the Sydney Film Festival[8] - where it came Fourth at the Foxtel Movies Audience Awards.[9] _That's Not Me_ has been met with overwhelmingly positive reviews and a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 87%.[10] The Guardian ranked it #5 of the Top 10 Australian Films of 2017,[11] with critic Luke Buckmaster giving it a 4 star review.[12] Andy Howell of Ain't It Cool praised Foulcher's lead performance, writing: “[Alice Foulcher] shoulders all the drama and gives one of the best twin performances I’ve ever seen... Having nuanced drama embedded in a comedy is a tightrope walk, but she’s got the skills to land it.”[13] The film was also flagged by the Santa Barbara Independent as a Must-See movie of the Santa Barbara International Film Festival,[14] and sold out a number of sessions at the festival.[15] Junkee Media called the film "An emotionally resonant and comedic quarter life crisis… It’s a simple set-up delivered endlessly in comedy, but managed so well in _That's Not Me_ that you remember how rare it is that balance is achieved in Australian films."[16] The Sydney Arts Guide praised the film and performances, writing: _"_There’s not a dud note in _That's Not Me_ thanks to a solid foundation in a script by Alice Foulcher and Gregory Erdstein, and anchored by a winning lead performance by Foulcher and helmed with an assured hand by Erdstein. The support casting is impeccable…Isabel Lucas is ferociously good".[17] Jake Watt of Switch called the film "a marvel of indie ingenuity, with dollops of charm and confident direction."[18] Karl Quinn writing for The Age said the film is "bursting with comedy, humanity and interesting ideas",[19] the Huffington Post called it "a stunning exploration of identity, the industry and the thirst for fame…the perfect blend of comedy and tragedy”,[20] whilst Concrete Playground praised it as "earnest, astute, insightful and thoroughly amusing. This is a movie that is both universal and unmistakably Australian – and that’s just one of many delicate balancing acts that That’s Not Me achieves".[21] _That's Not Me_ won the award for Best Film Under $200k at the inaugural 2018 Ozflix Independent Film Awards.[22]
