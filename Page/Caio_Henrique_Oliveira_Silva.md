Club career

Born in Santos, São Paulo, Caio joined Santos' youth setup in 2008, aged ten. On 1 February 2016, he was sold to Atlético Madrid, as his contract was due to expire.[1][2]

Caio was promoted to the reserves ahead of the 2016–17 campaign, but spent the whole pre-season with the main squad.[3] He made his senior debut on 28 August 2016, starting in a 1–0 Tercera División away win against Fútbol Alcobendas Sport.[4]

Caio made his professional debut on 30 November 2016, starting in a 6–0 Copa del Rey away routing of CD Guijuelo.[5] He would resume his appearances with the B-side, however.

On 3 April 2018, Caio returned to his home country after agreeing to a loan deal with Série A side Paraná, until December.[6]
