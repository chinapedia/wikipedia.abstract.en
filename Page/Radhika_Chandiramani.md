Education

Chandiramani trained in clinical psychology at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS).[10]


Founding of TARSHI

Chandiramani founded TARSHI in 1996, after receiving a fellowship from the MacArthur Foundation to start a helpline on sexual and reproductive health.[11][12] The helpline disseminated information, provided counselling and gave referrals for 13 years. TARSHI has since increased its scope and now implements trainings and other public education initiatives throughout South and Southeast Asia.[13][14]


Writing and publications

She has contributed to various anthologies on sexuality and human rights, which have been covered in media and scholarly reviews.[15][16][17][18]

Chandiramani is the author of a book on feminism and sexuality called _Good Times for Everyone: Sexuality Questions, Feminist Answers._[19] _The Tribune_'s review of the book notes: "As she explores taboos, we note that the author’s credentials are formidable... The book has responses to a wide variety of questions for inter-caste marriages, teenage sex, HIV, safer sex and speaks clearly on issues of homosexuality, lesbianism, bisexuality and the entire range that also exists."[20]

Her work, _Sexuality, Gender and Rights: Exploring Theory and Practice in South and Southeast Asia_, which she also co-edited with Geetanjali Misra, is a book consisting of 15 chapters, written by notable authors who have had experience in the areas of sexuality, gender differences and women rights.[21][22] Dr. Sawmya Ray of Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati writes in the scholastic review of the book: "This volume is rich in data drawn from personal narratives and case studies. All the articles are well integrated into its overarching theme".[23][24] _The Tribune_ notes in its review: "The human rights of women have been a topic of debate the world over. The right to make choices about sexuality, control over such rights and related issues are voiced regularly at international forums. The book throws light on some attempts made to recognise these rights and ensure their acceptance in society."[25]

Chandiramani published an analysis of the demographics and impact of TARSHI’s helpline in a 1998 issue of the journal _Reproductive Health Matters._[26] She is a regular contributor to TARSHI’s digital magazine _In Plainspeak_, and she has written for _Outlook India_ and _India Today_.[27][28]
