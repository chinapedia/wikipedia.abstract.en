History

The Warumungu Aboriginal people were the first occupants of the region in and around Tennant Creek. The telegraph station is near a very significant sacred site called "Jurnkurakurr", which is home to a Dreamtime being called "Jalawala", a black-nosed python.[1]

The Tennant Creek Telegraph Station was built in 1872. It was first a temporary bush timber building but by 1875 had been rebuilt with locally quarried stone.[2] It operated as a repeater station as part of the Overland Telegraph Line which connected Darwin to Adelaide. It also operated as a government rations depot. By the 1920s it featured a blacksmith shop, cart shed, ration store, meat house, smokehouse and cellar. Warumungu people were employed at the station as cattlemen and slaughter-men. But the 1890s more than 100 Aboriginal people were living at the station. It was declared an Aboriginal Reserve.[3]

The search for gold began from the 1880s.[4] In 1925, a linesman discovered gold, with the discovery quickly leading to the establishment of a township to the south of the telegraph station. In 1935 a post and wireless office became operational in the town of Tennant Creek itself,[5] so that the telegraph station was closed. It then reverted to a rations depot, supplying meat to the new town and water from its bore until 1966.[6]

Recent history

The station was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate on 25 March 1986.[9] The station was listed on the Northern Territory Heritage Register on 4 July 2001.[10] The land including the Telegraph Station and its immediate surroundings was originally proposed in 1987 as a historical reserve known as the TENNANT CREEK TELEGRAPH STATION HISTORICAL RESERVE but progress was delayed by a claim on the land made under _Aboriginal Land Rights Act (Northern Territory)_ in 1980 . The claim was resolved in August 2001 with the historical reserve awaiting official naming in April 2002.[11] Significant restoration work was undertaken on the remaining station buildings in 2012.[12]
