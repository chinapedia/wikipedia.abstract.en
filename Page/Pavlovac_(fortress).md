The PAVLOVAC CASTLE was a noble court and one of the largest and most important fortified towns of medieval Bosnia, situated on top of rugged slopes high above the Prača river canyon, near modern days Prača village, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Fortified castle was a seat of medieval Bosnian noble family Radinović-Pavlović.[1]


Old and New structure

The family hailed and ruled from PAVLOVAC. It is the second of two castles in their possession, which the family used as a seat. Two castles were built in the space of several decades and within a few kilometers from each other, second being _Borač castle_ or _Old Town_, and sometimes _Old Borač_.

The new castle or _New Town_, or sometimes _New Borač_, is actually called PAVLOVAC, and is considered to be a new structure, also known simply as _Novi_ _()_ or _Novi Grad_ _()_. Problem exist in correct dating of its construction, but some medieval charters suggest 1392, or late 14th century, as time of its construction, during Radislav Pavlović at the family's helm.[2][3][4][5]

Old Borač

However, historians are certain that another Radinović-Pavlović fortress existed, original and older Borač castle, which was built around 1244 in 13th century and located just a few kilometers downstream Prača river, between Mesići and villages of Borač and Brčigovo, near modern days Rogatica town, in Bosnia and Herzegovina.[6][7][8][9]
