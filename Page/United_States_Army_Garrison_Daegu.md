IMCOM replaced the Installation Management Agency, which was established to manage U.S. Army installations worldwide. USAG Daegu manages base operations on six U.S. Army installations and 11 sites in Area IV, which stretches from south of Daejeon to Busan, and provides support to the U.S. Navy at Fleet Activities Chinhae in Jinhae and the U.S. Marine Corps at Camp Mujuk in Pohang.

History

The U.S. Army Garrison Daegu was originally constituted on October 16, 2003 in the regular Army as Area IV Support Activity. The Area IV Support Activity was re-designated as U.S. Army Garrison Daegu on March 28, 2007. The former Area IV Support Activity assumed the base operations mission from the 20th Area Support Group (subsequently relocated to Camp Carroll, South Korea in April 2005 and deactivated in June 2006), which held the mission since August 16, 1985. Activation of the Area IV Support Activity signaled the separation of the base operations mission from the 20th ASG, which had two missions including combat service support in the lower third of the Republic of Korea. USAG Daegu has earned numerous awards for excellence in installation support, underlined by recognition as a multiple winner of Army Community of Excellence Awards.
