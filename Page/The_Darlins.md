THE DARLINS is an American country music duo composed of Erinn Bates from Nashville, Tennessee (lead vocals/mandolin) and Jude Toy from Portland, Oregon (guitar/vocals).

The Darlins met at a Sephora in Nashville.[1]

"All My Friends" was written by Erinn Bates, Jude Toy, and Max T. Barnes. The song got viral exposure via Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube after the video won first place in the national battle of the bands contest "The 2nd Hourly Gig" sponsored by Snagajob. Their prize was opening for Montgomery Gentry.[2]

The Darlins' debut EP, Crush, was released in 2015.[3] "Crush" features six songs written and co-written by Jude and Erinn and was produced by Buddy Hyatt from the Grammy Award Winning pop/rock band Toto.

The Darlins were named one of the 8 Best Artists of 2015 by the magazine, Nashville Music Guide.[4] In 2016 the duo was nominated for Best Country Duo or Group at the Nashville Industry Music Awards.[5]
