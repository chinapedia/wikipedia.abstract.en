Child sexual abuse lawsuit

In October 2016, VOA-PNN shed light on Toosi's case in which he was accused of sexually abusing nineteen[1] of his prepubescent Qur'an students over the past years (four plaintiffs are confirmed). It is unknown whether the charges could include homosexual rape, which could carry the death penalty.[2][3]

The anonymous plaintiffs claim that complaints made through legal channels were covered up or ignored by the authorities in order to protect the reputation of the Iranian government.[4]

Toosi issued a denial statement rejecting all of the claims, which he called “total lies”. The allegations were "aimed at discrediting the state’s religious foundations and its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei," Toosi said.[5] He stated he had never engaged in "such sins" and "actions incompatible with chastity."[6]
