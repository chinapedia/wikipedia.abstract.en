JULI√ÅN MARIN (born in Reus, Spain), is a Spanish singer, songwriter and producer.


Career

Marin started uploading covers to YouTube in 2010 until in 2014 the Spanish producer Mr.Rommel suggested that he release a single since he was known on Twitter.

During 2014 he was the radio presenter of the music section on the radio program "Me lo dices o me lo cuenta" on LaMasterFM radio in Madrid, and a year later, in 2015 he presented the music news on the Radio program "Entre la gente" in the radio of Madrid 10Radio.

The first single was entitled "dame tu calor"[1] in 2016, a benefit single for the fight against cancer[2] that managed to be in the TOP20 in the charts of iTunes of Spain the day of its release.

Thanks to this first single he has obtained three nominations: Artist revelation in EDM RADIO, candidate for the "imprescicible" awards of ReusTV and finally, best videoclip in the film festival in Zaragoza this 2016.[3]

He is one of the candidates in the Eurocasting organized by RTVE to represent Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 in Kiev.[4]
