CHIEF USMAN MOFEYINTIOLUWA LAWAL-OSULA (1910 â€“ December 2, 1972) was a Nigerian businessman with interests across insurance, real estate and other industries. As a member of the Benin royal family, he held a hereditary traditional title[1] as the Arala of Benin[2] at the time of his death.


Legal battle of will

Gidley_Lawal_Osula_Britain.jpg and Chief U.M. Lawal-Osula]] The case of the will of Chief U.M. Lawal-Osula has become one of the most notable family law cases taught around the world as final judgment came after 23 years of disputes and court battles.[3] At the time of his death in 1972, a will written by Chief U.M. Lawal-Osula dated November 22, 1968 was found.[4]

By the Benin native law and custom, a Benin traditional chief is succeeded by his eldest son at death but before the death of Chief U.M. Lawal-Osula, he made a will in which he made provisions for his wife and children.[5] However, following the death of U.M. Lawal-Osula, a man who provisions were not made for in the will claimed to be the eldest son of the chief was the plaintiff and this caused controversy over the question of whether the wife and children (the defendants) in the will were, in fact, children of U.M. Lawal-Osula.[6]

In 1986, the plaintiffs initiated an action in which they claimed against the defendants that the last testament of the testator dated November 22, 1968 is null and void in the Bendel State High Court[7] despite the chief explicitly stating _"...that nobody shall modify or vary this Will. It is my will that the native law and custom of Benin shall not apply to alter or modify this my will."_ [8] However, in 1995, two years after the death of the 1st defendant,[9] Mrs. Lydia Lawal-Osula, the Supreme Court of Nigeria made a ruling that the real estate and personal properties comprised in the estate of Chief Usman Mofeyintioluwa Lawal-Osula be handed over to his wife and children as stated in the will.[10][11]
