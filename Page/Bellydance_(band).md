History

Bellydance were formed as a dance, funk band, Bellydance Disco, in Sydney in 1987 by mainstays Ted Cavanagh on guitar, the actor, Tony Hughes on vocals, and Scott Saunders (ex-Deckchairs Overboard, Beatfish) on keyboards.[1] Their line-up changed often and the ensemble sometimes reached 12 members.[2] The group's debut single, "Spittin' Bullets", appeared in July 1987.[3]

According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, they "built up a strong following on the Sydney dance/pub circuit, and first came to national prominence with the release of the topical single 'Green Revolution' in mid-1992."[4] By that time Saunders had also formed an acid jazz group, Directions in Groove (initially styled as d.i.g.), with Alexander Hewetson on bass guitar, Terepai Richmond on drums, Rick Robertson on saxophone, and Tim Rollinson on guitar.[5] They released an extended play, _Fun Dopin{{'}}_, in May 1993 and also supported visiting English reggae singer, Maxi Priest, on his tour of Australia.[6]

Bellydance issued their debut studio album, _One Blood_, in October 1993 via Regular Records/Festival Records.[7][8] It had been recorded in the previous year with Stephen Ferris producing.[9] McFarlane observed, "[it] contained a mix of hard funk, smooth soul-pop, dub reggae and jazz-funk."[10] At the ARIA Music Awards of 1994 it was nominated for Best Pop Release.[11] The group released another EP, _The Joker_, in 1994 and followed with their second album, _Babylon Mixed Business_, late in the next year, via Roadshow Music.[12] Another EP, _Ain't no Use_, appeared in November 1995 and the group disbanded in 1996.[13]
