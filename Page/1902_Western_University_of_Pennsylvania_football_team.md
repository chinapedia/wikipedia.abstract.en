The 1902 WESTERN UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA FOOTBALL TEAM was an American football team that represented Western University of Pennsylvania (now known as the University of Pittsburgh) as an independent during the 1902 college football season. In its first season under head coach Fred Crolius, the team compiled a 5–6–1 record and was outscored by a total of 129 to 128.[1]

The Pitt Football Record Book refers to a 24–0 victory over Bucknell.[2] However, contemporary press coverage indicates that the game was played between Bucknell and a team known as "the Pittsburgh stars".[3]
