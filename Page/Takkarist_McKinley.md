He went under surgery to repair a torn labrum and a fracture in his shoulder socket after the combine.

He was ranked the second best outside linebacker in the draft by NFL analyst Bucky Brooks, the third best outside linebacker by NFLDraftScout.com, the fourth best edge rusher by NFL analyst Mike Mayock, the fifth best edge rusher by _Sports Illustrated_, and was ranked the fifth best defensive end by ESPN.[10][11][12][13][14]
