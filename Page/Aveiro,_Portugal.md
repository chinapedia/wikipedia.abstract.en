Along with the neighbouring city of Ílhavo, Aveiro is part of an urban agglomeration that includes 120,000 inhabitants, making it one of the most important populated regions by density in the Centro Region, and primary centre of the Intermunicipal Community of Aveiro and Baixo Vouga. Administratively, the president of the municipal government is José Ribau Esteves, elected by coalition between the Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Social Centre, who governs the ten civil parishes ().


History

The presence of human settlement in the territory of Aveiro extends to the period associated with the great dolmens of pre-history, which exist in most of the region.[3]

For a long period Aveiro was an important economic link in the production of salt and commercial shipping.[4] It was a centre of salt exploration by the Romans and trade since 26 January 959 (from the testament of Countess Mumadona Dias to the _cenóbio_ of Guimarães).[5] During this testament, Mumadona Dias also highlighted the ancient name for Aveiro, referring to the monastery's lands in _Alauario et Salinas_, literally, "_a gathering place or preserve of birds and of great salt_".[6]

It was invaded by the Moors and held until the 11th century, after which it became popular with Portuguese royalty.

Kingdom of Portugal

, daughter of King Afonso V]]

Later, King João I, on the advice of his son Pedro, who was the donatary of Aveiro, requested the construction of fortification walls.

King D. Duarte conceded in 1435 the privilege of providing an annual duty-free fair, later referred to as the _Feira de Março_ (_March Fair_), today still an annual tradition.

The Princess St. Joana, daughter of Afonso V lived in Aveiro, entering the convent of Jesus, and lived there until her death on 12 May 1490. During her life her presence brought attention to the town, and favoured it with an elevated level of development for the time.

The first charter (foral) was conceded by Manuel I of Portugal on 4 August 1515, as indicated in the _Livro de Leituras Novas de Forais da Estremadura_. Its geographic position along the Aveiro River had always helped it to subsist and grow, supported by salt market, fishing and maritime commercial development. By the beginning of the 15th century, there already existed a great wall around the historical centre, intonating the significance of the community and growth of the population.[7] This included the founding of many religious institutions and their supports, which assisted during the 17th and 18th century crises associated with silt in the waterway.[8] In the winter of 1575, a terrible storm closed the entrance to its port, ending a thriving trade in metals and tiles, and creating a reef barrier at the Atlantic Ocean. The walls were subsequently demolished and used to create the docks around the new sand bar.

Between the 16th and 17th centuries, the river's instability at the mouth (between the Ria and open ocean) resulted in the closure of the canal, impeding the use of the port of Aveiro, and creating stagnation in the waters of the lagoon. This blow to the economy created a social and economic crisis, and resulted in the decrease in the population and emigration. It was at this time that the Church of the Miserícordia was constructed, during the Philippine Dynastic union.

In 1759, King José I elevated the town to the status of city, a few months after condemning the Duke of Aveiro (a title established in 1547 by João III), José Mascarenhas, to death. As a result, Aveiro became known as Nova Bragança: it was later abandoned much later, and returned to Aveiro. In 1774, by request of King José, Pope Clement XIV instituted the Diocese of Aveiro.

In the 19th century, the Aveirense were active during the Liberal Wars, and it was José Estêvão Coelho de Magalhães, a parliamentary member who was determinant in resolving the problem of access along the Ria. He also helped with the development of transport, especially the railway line between Lisbon and Porto. It was the opening of the artificial canals, completed in 1808, that allowed Aveiro to expand economically, marking the beginning in the town's growth.[9]

The municipality was elevated to the status of town, centered on the its principal church, consecrated to the Archangel Michael, today the location of the _Praça da República_ (having been demolished in 1835).

Climate

Aveiro has a warm-summer mediterranean climate[11] influenced by its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean.

As typical of mediterranean climates, summers are dry and winters are wet. A coastal feature is that frosts are rare and never severe. The hottest temperature recorded was .[12] Temperatures above are extremely occasional, and averages only a couple of times per annum.[13]

Architecture

]]

The architecture of Aveiro is influenced by two phases: the pre-Kingdom era, with a number of historical monuments; and the modernist movements resulting from the expansion of economy during the 19th-20th centuries.

The city's primary landmark is the 15th century Monastery of Jesus (), containing the tomb of King Afonso V's daughter, St. Joana (who died in 1490). The presence of this royal personage, beatified in 1693, proved to be of great benefit when she bequeathed her valuable estate to the convent. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the convent housed a school of embroidery, but was transformed into the _Museu de Santa Joana_, or simply, the Museum of Aveiro, housing many of these handicrafts.

The abundance of 19th-20th century architectural buildings reflects the effects of the boom during that period, including many of the Art Novo and Art Deco buildings, inspired by modernist trends and Nationalist tendencies of the Estado Novo regime.[21] The best of these is in the university campus, where many of the nationalist architects were involved in construction projects.[22]

There are several attractions in the city of Aveiro, including cathedrals, canals and the beaches, including the _Ílhavo ceramica de Vista Alegre_ and the beaches of Barra, Costa Nova do Prado, and Gafanha da Nazaré.


Culture

Aveiro is known in Portugal for its traditional sweets, _Ovos Moles de Aveiro_ (PGI),[23] _trouxas de ovos_, both made from eggs. _Raivas_ are also typical biscuits of Aveiro.

The municipal holiday is 12 May, the day of Joanna, Princess of Portugal (1452-1490).
