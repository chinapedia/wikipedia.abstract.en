THE MODS were a punk rock band from Toronto during the first wave of late 1970s punk. Formed in 1978 with members Greg Triner (vocals), Scott Marks (guitar), Mark Dixon (bass) and David Quinton Steinberg (drums). The Mods were obviously influenced by The Jam and had a similar look and sound which contrasted with the black leather, T-shirts and tight jeans look of the other Toronto bands of the era.

The band played heavily in the Toronto area as well as further afield than most other Toronto bands of the era to New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago and Detroit. Besides their solo gigs they also opened for The Police (in their first Toronto show), The Specials and Squeeze. Unlike many of the rowdier Toronto bands of the era the Mods were known for being tight and professional.

They recorded one EP in 1981 independently as well as another albums worth of material but a proposed major label record deal fell through. Their other recorded output includes a 1978 appearance recorded for the documentary "The Last Pogo" which they also appear on the soundtrack album for.

After the failure to get a record deal in 1979 the band briefly changed their name to The News before breaking up. David Quinton would go on to play on Stiv Bators solo album as well as making solo recordings.

The Mods complete recordings along with some live tracks were released on CD in 1995. Since then the band has periodically reformed for reunion gigs.
