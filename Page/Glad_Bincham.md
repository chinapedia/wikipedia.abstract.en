THOMAS GLADSTONE "GLAD" BINCHAM was an industrialist in the stationery industry, who served as the Chief International Scout Commissioner of the World Scout Committee from 1944 to 1956, as well as the International Commissioner of the United Kingdom Scout Association, and played a major role in the resumption of Scouting in Europe after World War II.

Bincham and A.W. Hurll, then General Secretary of The Boy Scouts Association, paid a visit to Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and France in October 1945. They were able to make valuable first-hand contacts with the leaders of the Scout movements in these countries, and to learn more of how Scouting had played a part during the occupation, and how it proposed to meet the future. In Luxembourg, they were received by Robert Schaffner, the Scout Commissioner, who had been elected mayor of the ruined town of Echternach the day before, and was already drawing up plans for its reconstruction.[1]

In 1957, Bincham was awarded the 13th _Bronze Wolf_, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting.[2]
