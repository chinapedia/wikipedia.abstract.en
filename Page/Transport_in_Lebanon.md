Transportation in Lebanon varies greatly in quality from the ultramodern Beirut International Airport to poor road conditions in many parts of the country. The Lebanese civil war between 1975 and 1990 and the 2006 Lebanon War with Israel severely damaged the country's infrastructure.


Roads

Lebanon has an extensive road network throughout the country, generally in good conditions, though it varies. The main roads in the country are:

-   Beirut - Byblos - Tripoli - Aarida
-   Beirut - Sidon - Sour - Naqoura
-   Beirut - Bhamdoun Al Mhatta - Chtaura - Masnaa
-   Chtaura - Zahle - Baalbek - Qaa
-   Chtaura - Qab Elias - Machgara - Nabatieh
-   Tripoli - Bcharre - Baalbek

Motorways

Part of the main road network have been updated to dual carriageway, four-lane motorways, which are the following:

-   Beirut - Tripoli. Length: 81 km.
-   Beirut - Kfar Badde. Length: 65 km.
-   Beirut - Mdeyrej. Length: 33 km.
-   Tripoli - Khane. Length: 20 km.


Buses

An overland trans-desert bus service between Beirut, Haifa, Damascus and Baghdad was established by the _Nairn Transport Company_ of Damascus in 1923.

Beirut has frequent bus connections to other cities in Lebanon and major cities in Syria. The Lebanese Commuting Company, or LCC in short, is just one of a handful brands of public transportations all over Lebanon.[1] On the other hand, the publicly owned buses are managed by le Office des Chemins de Fer et des Transports en Commun (OCFTC), or the "_Railway and Public Transportation Authority_" in English.[2] Buses for northern destinations and Syria leave from Charles Helou Station.[3]

Buses are popular and inexpensive and can be stopped anywhere along the way simply by hailing.


Ferries

Apart from the international airport, the Port of Beirut is another port of entry. As a final destination, anyone can also reach Lebanon by ferry from Cyprus or by road from Damascus.[4] The Port of Tripoli (Lebanon) is also a port of entry.


Taxis and services

In order to get from one place to another, people can either use a service or taxis. A "service" is a lot cheaper than a "taxi" as the passenger would be sharing the cab in the first place unlike the latter, where he would have the cab to himself.

Cabs can be recognized by their red license plates (indicating that it is licensed for public transportation). The driver would pull aside for if the person hails while seeing him. He will then ask for his destination and then will decide whether he will drive the passenger with the regular fare, an extra, or not at all.

Types of taxis in Lebanon

-   SERVICE-TAXIS

One has to specify one's destination and enter the taxi only if one's destination corresponds to the itinerary of the Service-taxi. The driver stops to pick up additional passengers anywhere on the streets and drop them off generally in main squares and main streets. It remains advantageous with very low fares.

_Service-Taxi Taxi_

-   Local
    -   LBP 2000 ($1.33) per person or LBP 4000 ($2.66) per person depending on how close/far the destination is. Prices within Beirut could vary depending on traffic and distance but overall should not exceed LBP 4000 per person (Maximum of LBP 5000 for Beirut outskirts). However, the driver could ask for more if the passenger intends to go to an area with high traffic like Hamra Street.
-   Long Distance
    -   Starts from LBP 5.000 ($3.33) and goes up from there. For example, from Beirut to Sidon, the drivers usually charge in between LBP 50,000 ($33.33) and LBP 75,000 ($50).
-   TRADITIONAL TAXIS

The driver must not pick up additional passengers. Most of these taxis are not equipped with meters, so it is important to negotiate the fare before embarking. The regular taxi fare starts at LBP 10,000 ($6.66).

-   ON-CALL TAXIS

Pick up people who have pre-booked by phone. They don’t respond to hails in the street. They don’t have a meter so passengers should ask the operator the price when they are booking the taxi, and double check with the driver at the end of the journey.

-   TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES

Uber, a transportation network company operates in Beirut and quotes the fare before the ride is accepted.

Trains

The Lebanese rail system is not currently in use, with services having ceased due to the country's political difficulties.
