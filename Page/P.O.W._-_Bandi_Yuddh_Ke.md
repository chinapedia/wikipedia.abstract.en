Production

Development

Star Plus approached Nikkhil Advani after watching his latest film _D-Day_, to direct a show based on the similar plotline on their channel. Star Plus had him watch both _Hatufim_ and its American counterpart _Homeland_. Advani sought to make a show like _Hatufim_ since he thought a show like _Homeland_ would not suite Indian's sensibilities.[12]

Casting

Advani decided to rope in Amrita Puri, Purab Kohli,[13][14] Satyadeep Misra, Manish Chaudhary and Sandhya Mridul â€“ the former debuting on the small screen and the latter returning on the small screen after a hiatus of two years.[15] Sahil Salathia, Anurag Sinha and Parul Gulati make a major entry post Episode 60 in the series as the further story unveils. Theater actor Abhishek Gupta plays RAW officer Santosh and Lala (Rashid Jamaal) is played by Denzil Smith in the series.[16]

Music

Arjunna Harjaie made his television debut with this show. He composed all the music tracks, background score, soundtrack, and also sung some songs except the title track.[17]


Critical reception

Gursimran Kaur Bangal of _The Times of India_ "The show has managed to hold us all through the three episodes aired so far. The narrative is gripping and stirs you emotionally. It keeps you glued to what will happen next. This one is not to be missed!"[18] Anvita Singh of _India Today_ praised the show's unique plot, strong female characters, actors and the good cliffhanger.[19] _Mid-Day_ has compared the show with its American counterpart and considered that while it aids in etching the underlying theme of the series, the treatment given to the two adaptations are significantly distanced from one another.[20] The show won awards including Jury award for best Asian show at Seoul International drama awards and for its promotion and music at the Abby. It also had 12 nominations at the ITA awards, winning in categories such as: Best Drama-Jury, Best Actor-Jury (Purab Kohli), Best Actor in a Negative Role (Denzil Smith).
