The JENS LAURITZEN HOUSE is a Neoclassical property at Nytorv 7 in the Old Town of Copenhagen, Denmark. Home to the Association of Folk High Schools in Denmark, the building is now also known as HØJSKOLERNES HUS (English: The House of Folk High Schools).


History

Nytorv_7-11.jpg The house was constructed in connection with the rebuilding of the area following the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. It was built in 1795-1796 for merchant and brewer Jens Lauritzen. The architect was probably Andreas Kirkerup.

General Cai Hegermann-Lindencrone (1807-1893) lived in the building from 1862 to 1864. National bank director Moritz Levy (1824-1892) lived in the building from 1868,[1]


Architecture

The building consists of three storeys over a cellar and is seven bays wide. The five central bays are slightly recessed. Four ionic order pilasters flank the three central bays. A side wing extends from the rear side of the building. In the courtyard is a five-storey warehouse.


Today

The building is owned by Nordea. The tenants include the Association of Folk High Schools in Denmark. The warehouse in the courtyard houses a travel agency.
