He has published in renowned journals as the Journal of Comparative Economics, the Journal of Law and Economics, and the Oxford Journal of Legal Studies. Guerriero is most known for his work on:

-   endogenous legal traditions (a criticism to the legal origins literature based on the fact that legal systems evolve due to forces also affecting the economic outcomes that economists want to explain through legal variation and suggesting that the reforms supported by the World Bank and based on the legal origins literature might have detrimental effects);[3][4]
-   property rights;[5]
-   market design;[6]
-   the determinants and effects of a culture of cooperation and inclusive political institutions.[7]
-   extractive policies with a special focus to the unitary origins of the present-day North-South of Italy divide.[8]
