_UNSUNG STORY: TALE OF THE GUARDIANS_ is a tactical role-playing game in development by Little Orbit. Originally set for release in 2015, the game is expected to be released in late 2020 for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

Funded on Kickstarter in early 2014 by developer Playdek, the game was announced to be developed under the creative direction of Yasumi Matsuno, the director of _Final Fantasy Tactics_ and _Vagrant Story_, which _Unsung Story_ takes major inspiration from.[1] The game gathered over $600,000 in contributions, but no new information about it was released for much of 2015.[2][3] In February 2016, Playdek announced that development had been stopped for lack of resources.[4] In September 2016, Playdek announced a collaboration with another unannounced company, later revealed to be Little Orbit, to continue the game's development.[5][6][7][8] The game is expected to be released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in late 2020.[9]
