_AGAPANTHUS AFRICANUS_ (AFRICAN LILY) is a flowering plant from the genus _Agapanthus_ native to the area of Cape of Good Hope in South Africa.[1] _A. africanus_ is more difficult to grow in gardens than _A. praecox_, and almost all plants sold as _A. africanus_ are actually _A. praecox_.[2]

It has a short stem bearing a tuft of long, narrow, arching leaves 10–35 cm long and 1–2 cm broad, and a central flower stalk 25–60 cm tall, ending in an umbel of 20-30 white, or bright blue, funnel-shaped flowers, each flower 2.5–5 cm diameter.[3][4]


Cultivation

It was introduced to Europe at the close of the 17th century.[5] Unlike the more common _A. praecox_, it is not generally suitable as a garden plant, and will not tolerate extended freezing temperatures.[6]
