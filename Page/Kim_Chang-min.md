KIM CHANG-MIN (born September 4, 1985 in Uiseong County) is a South Korean curler. Kim played skip on the South Korean men's team on home ice at the 2018 Winter Olympics.[1]


Junior career

Kim's curling career began quickly, with a trip to the 1998 Pacific Curling Championships in just his first year of curling. Kim played third for the Korean team, which was skipped by Song He-dong. The team was outmatched in the tournament, and they would go winless in six games.

With a few more years of experience under his belt, Kim would play on the Korean junior men's team, going to the World Junior Curling Championships in 2004, 2005 and 2006. At the 2004 World Junior Curling Championships, Kim played third for skip Kim Soo-hyuk. After a 5-4 round robin record, the team beat Canada in a tiebreaker match to make the playoffs. There, the team would lose in both the semifinal and the bronze medal final, settling for fourth place. At the 2005 World Junior Curling Championships, the team found less success, finishing the round robin with a 2-7 record, and missed the playoffs. At the 2006 World Junior Curling Championships, Kim was promoted to skip the Korean team. He led his rink of Kim Min-chan, Park Jong-duk, Park Jin-oh and Choi Byung-rok to a 4-5 record, again missing the playoffs.

During his junior career, Kim won a gold medal at the 2005 Pacific Junior Curling Championships, a silver medal in 2007 and a bronze medal in 2006.

Kim has played in four Winter Universiades for the Korean team, while attending Andong National University. Kim skipped the team in all four of his appearances. He won the gold medal at the 2011 Winter Universiade with teammates Kim Min-chan, Seong Se-hyeon, Seo Young-seon and Oh Eun-su. He would lead Korea to a fourth-place finish at the 2009 Winter Universiade, fifth place at the 2007 Winter Universiade and 8th place at the 2013 Winter Universiade.


Men's career

After a premature trip in 1998, Kim returned to the Pacific Curling Championships in 2009. Kim skipped the Korean team of Kim Min-chan, Lim Myung-sup, Jeong Tac-yeon and Seong Se-hyeon to a bronze medal. Kim returned to the event in 2011, which was renamed to the Pacific-Asia Championships. He skipped the Korean team of Kim Min-chan, Seong Se-hyeon, Seo Young-seon and Oh Eun-su to another bronze medal. Kim also skipped the Korean team at the 2012 Pacific-Asia Curling Championships. He would be less successful there, as his team would finish in 4th place.

On the World Curling Tour, Kim has won two events in his career. He has won the 2013 Original 16 WCT Bonspiel and the 2016 KKP Classic.

Kim and his rink of Seong, Oh, and Lee Ki-bok were named as South Korea's Olympic team for the 2018 Winter Olympics.
