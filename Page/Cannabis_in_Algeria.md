CANNABIS IN ALGERIA is illegal.


History

Cannabis is believed to have been introduced to Algeria by the Arab invasions of the 9th through 12th centuries.[1]

Cannabis use in Algeria also played a role in spreading the habit to France, following France's 1830 occupation of Algeria.[2] Dr. Jacques-Joseph Moreau observed the effects of cannabis in Algeria in the form of an edible called _dawamesc_, and it was this drug that he introduced to Paris' Club des Hashischins.[3]

In 1854, John Morell wrote of his travels in Algeria:

  _In Algeria they apply the names of kif, of hachich, and sometimes of tekrouri, to the extremity of the stem of the hemp, including the leaves, the flowers, and the seed, sometimes smoked by the natives in very diminutive pipes. These smokers are mostly inhabitants of the towns and villages, and are rarely met with among the Bedouins._[4]
