DANIEL PATRICK WOZNIAK (born March 23, 1984) is a former Southern California telemarketer, community theater actor and convicted double-murderer on California's Death Row. In May 2010, Wozniak murdered two people as part of a plan to steal money from one of the victims. The money was going to be used to pay for his upcoming wedding and honeymoon. Wozniak murdered his neighbor and friend, PFC Samuel Eliezer Herr, 26, an OEF Army Veteran of the 1st Squadron, 91st Cavalry Regiment of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team, and Herr's college friend, Juri "Julie" Kibuishi, 23.

At the time of the murders, Wozniak was deep in debt and was also facing eviction from his apartment which he shared with his fiancée Rachel Mae Buffett.[1] Wozniak and Herr lived in the same apartment complex in Costa Mesa, California.

After more than five years of court proceedings, Wozniak went to trial and was convicted on two counts of first-degree murder.[2] He was sentenced to capital punishment (death) in September 2016.[3]

He is incarcerated at California's San Quentin State Prison.[4]


Crimes and cover-up

Wozniak shot and killed his neighbor, Samuel ("Sam") Herr, 26, on May 21, 2010, at a Los Alamitos theater.[5] Wozniak was in debt, facing eviction, needed to finance his upcoming wedding and honeymoon, and planned to steal Herr's savings.[6]

Seeking to misdirect police, Wozniak then used Herr's cell phone to text Juri "Julie" Kibuishi, 23, who had been tutoring Herr in community college. He lured Kibuishi to Herr's apartment where he shot and killed her. Wozniak then staged the crime scene to make it appear as though Julie had been sexually assaulted, suggesting that Herr had committed the murder and then gone on the run.

The same evening, he went on to perform in his local theatre production. Afterwards, Wozniak dismembered victim Sam Herr by removing his limbs and head.

An enormous manhunt for Sam Herr was launched by authorities who wrongly believed Herr was responsible for Julie's murder and was on the run.

Wozniak came under suspicion after he instructed a sixteen-year-old to withdraw money from Herr's accounts. When the police confronted the boy, they were told by the boy that Wozniak had asked him to withdraw the money for him.[7] Soon after, Wozniak was apprehended at his bachelor party two days before his wedding.[8][9]

After repeatedly lying to police, Wozniak finally confessed. Wozniak led authorities to Herr's body where it was found buried at El Dorado Nature Center in Long Beach. After more than five years of court proceedings, Wozniak went to trial and was convicted on two counts of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to capital punishment (death) in September 2016.

More than a year later, in November 2012, Wozniak's then-fiancée, Rachel Mae Buffett, was arrested[10]and charged with three felony counts of accessory-after-the-fact based on allegations that she had lied multiple times to police investigators.[11] On September 12, 2018, Buffett was convicted on two of those counts with a maximum possible sentence of 44 months and, on November 8, 2018, was sentenced to 32 months, with probation, time served, and good conduct, Buffett expected to serve between one and two years in the Orange County Jail.[12][13]
