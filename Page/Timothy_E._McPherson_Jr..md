Image_of_Timothy_Elisha_McPherson_Jr.jpg TIMOTHY E. MCPHERSON JR is a descendant of the Nanny Town Maroons (Windward Maroons) and he is currently the Minister of Finance for the Accompong Maroons (Leeward Maroons).[1][2][3][4][5][6] He is also Chairman of the Door of Return initiative which is being spearheaded across Africa in cooperation with Ghana and Nigeria as part of the UN's International Decade for People of African Descent. During the 2018 Door of Return celebration in Nigeria, Mr. McPherson was officially honoured by the Akran of Badagry and conferred with the Royal Chieftaincy title as "Yenwa of Badagry Kingdom".[7][8][9][10][11]

In addition to the Door of Return Initiative, Mr. McPherson was also instrumental in negotiating the recent decision to establish an African Union Diaspora Headquarters in Accompong. The headquarters will be used as a strategic gathering point for the Sixth Region which is being consolidated by the African Union Permanent Mission to Washington [12].

In 2008 the Nanny Town Maroons were included within the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity[13] which obliges the safeguarding of the local ecology. Timothy McPherson has since become notable for his promotion of sustainable development and climate change related cooperation between Africa and the Caribbean.[14] His appointment within the Maroon Council reflects increased collaboration among the Maroon communities on the Island of Jamaica as they seek to protect their ancestral lands from commercial bauxite mining and the effects of global climate change.[15]

Since assuming his office as Minister of Finance, Mr. McPherson has made numerous strategic strides in restructuring the economy, and he has become particularly notable for the creation and introduction of the LUMI, Accompong's new currency which is commodity underwritten with renewable energy[16].

Timothy McPherson was born in Canada and has a background in economics.[17]
