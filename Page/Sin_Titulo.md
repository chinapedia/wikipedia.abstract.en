_SIN TITULO_ is a mystery webcomic by Cameron Stewart, following the supernatural experiences of protagonist Alex Mackay. Launched in 2007, the webcomic completed its run in 2012 and got a Dark Horse Comics print publication in 2013. _Sin Titulo_ won a Joe Shuster Award in 2009 and an Eisner Award in 2010.


Content

The webcomic _Sin Titulo_ follows protagonist Alex Mackay, who, at the start of the story, discovers a photograph of an unfamiliar woman in his grandfather's possessions and feels compelled to hunt her down. This leads him to an underworld populated by mysterious and strange concepts, such as an eerie laboratory and a femme fatale. Lauren Davis of _Comics Alliance_ described _Sin Tutilo_ as a "noir fantasy": though it suggests the existence of science fiction concepts such as interdimentional travel and "shared cognitive space", many of its visuals are akin to those of a detective novel.[1]


Development

_Sin Titulo_ was launched by Cameron Stewart as a webcomic in 2007 and eventually finished in 2012. Stewart did the writing, illustrations, lettering, and coloring for the work all on his own. The webcomic started as an "exercise in improvisation", its ambiguous title _Sin Titulo_ literally meaning "Without Title" in Spanish. Many ideas for the story coalesced halfway through, when Stewart got a stronger grasp of what the webcomic was about.[2] In 2011, _Sin Titulo_ went on hiatus for almost a full year, keeping its readers in suspense.[3]

Stewart told Davis of _Comics Alliance_ at the New England Webcomics Weekend in 2009, when _Sin Titulo_ was still fairly young, that the webcomic is inspired by a disquieting experience he had as a child; one he's never been able to explain. He told Davis that he did not want _Sin Titulo_ to turn out like the television series _Lost_, which was still airing at the time and which disappointed him for not answering all of the questions it set up.[4] Though Stewart did not intend for it to be an autobiographical work, many aspects of the webcomic are based on his own experiences, including the sudden death of a neglected grandfather.[5]

A strong influence of _Sin Titulo_ is the work of David Lynch. In an interview with _Newsarama_, Stewart stated that he admires Lynch for his ability to provoke a sense of horror through surrealistic imagery that, to him, feels deeply honest. Stewart said that "I find his work so terrifying because on some primal level I feel like its revealing some dark and indescribable truth with complete sincerity." This is a quality he attempted to emulate in his webcomic.[6]

On September 25, 2013, a print edition of _Sin Titulo_ was released by Dark Horse Comics.[7] Though the webcomic is still available for free online, the comic book compilation became a best-selling album.[8]


Reception

Lauren Davis praised _Sin Titulo_ in 2012 for how it weaved its story threads together at the end and for its "slightly disorienting" style, allowing its readers to experience Alex' trials alongside him.[9] Hillary Brown of _Paste Magazine_ noted that the webcomic's atmosphere and moments of fear provoke stronger emotions than the mechanics of its plot. Brown praised Stewart for his ability to capture the feeling of being unsure whether you're awake or asleep, but criticized the manner in which he set up and eventually resolves the mysteries in _Sin Titulo_, stating that "doesnâ€™t quite do them justice."[10]

Stewart won a Joe Shuster Award in 2009 in the category "Webcomics" for his work on _Sin Titulo_.[11] The following year, Stewart won an Eisner Award in the "Best Webcomic" category.
