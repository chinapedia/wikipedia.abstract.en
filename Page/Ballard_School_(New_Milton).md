History

Ballard School was founded as the Royal Naval School by William Higgs Colborne and James Cruickshank at Lee-on-the-Solent in August 1895. Great Ballard House was designed by Sydney Kelway Pope M.S.A, a local Southampton architect. One of the first pupils was named Trevor John Tatham. He joined the school as a teacher in 1916 and remained until his death in 1952. Around 1905, the Royal Navy requested that the name be changed and so it was renamed as Edinburgh House School.

James Cruickshank married his partner's daughter Louisa in 1901. The school remained at premises in Manor Way, Lee-on-the-Solent throughout the first World War. In 1906, Louisa gave birth to Stuart Colborne Cruickshank, a future headmaster of Edinburgh House School. Following the deaths of both William and James, Louisa became joint Principal with her son Stuart.

Early in the 1930s, two teachers who were to play a major part in the post war development of the school joined Edinburgh House School. They were Edward (Ted) Kingsley Kefford and David William Hutchinson (Hutch) When the 2nd World War began, the school left Lee-on-the-Solent, moving first to Wellington, Somerset and then in 1942 to Brightwell Baldwin, Oxfordshire. In 1936, Ted had married Evelyn Burt, a New Milton girl.

After the War, it was decided that the school would not move back to Lee-on-the-Solent. Ted learned that Great Ballard Estate in New Milton was on the market for sale. With the large Arts and Craft house, vegetable garden and about 40 acres of land it was ideal for use as a school. As neither he nor Stuart Cruickshank could raise the capital to purchase, Ted negotiated a lease and the school took occupation in January 1946.

Great Ballard House was built in 1904 by John Arnold Ubsdell (2nd) and his wife Genevieve Ann (née Eads). In 1924, the house and estate had been leased to a newly formed school named ‘Great Ballard School’. This school remained in occupation until 1940, when it moved to Clayesmore School in Iwerne Minster, Dorset before moving first to Stowell Park Gloucestershire, then Camberley Surrey and finally to Eartham West Sussex.

‘Ted’ Kefford was Headmaster of Edinburgh House until his retirement in July 1969. Earlier in that year discussions with the Headmasters of Gorse Cliff and Marchwood Park Schools led to them merging with Edinburgh House School in September 1969. The new Principal was the Rev. Ian Watson who remained in post until 1973. Extensive improvements to facilities were completed in 1970. Rev R. Drown was the next Headmaster (1973-1984) and in 1980/81 a £72,000 Development Plan was announced. Mr. J. Quibell-Smith (1984-1988) was next in post and put strong emphasis on the welfare of the pupils as well as their education and of the school being a happy place. Next came Mr A.R. Leighton (1988-1995) and a further development programme was carried out in the early 1990s. In September 1995 Mr Leighton oversaw the merger of Edinburgh House School with Fernhill Manor the adjoining girls school. The larger school was named Ballard School.
