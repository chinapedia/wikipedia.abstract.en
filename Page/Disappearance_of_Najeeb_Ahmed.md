NAJEEB AHMED was a first year M.Sc Biotechnology student at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, India who went missing under suspicious circumstances on 15 October 2016 from his hostel in the university campus.[1][2][3]


Disappearance

Najeeb was a newly enrolled student at JNU and had resided at the Mahi-Mandavi hostel in JNU campus for less than a week before he disappeared. His family and the JNU Students' Union (JNUSU) have consistently maintained that Najeeb's disappearance was linked to the assault on him the previous night; accordingly they have demanded that the investigating agencies probe the link between the assault and the disappearance.[4] Najeeb' mother Fatima Nafees filed a habeas corpus petition on November 25, 2016 before the Delhi High Court after the Delhi Police had failed to make any headway in the case a month after her son's disappearance.


Investigation

The Police had filed an FIR for kidnapping and wrongful confinement based on Najeeb's mother Fatima Nafees' complaint on October 15, 2016.[5] Premier investigative agencies in the country such as an Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Delhi Police, the Crime Branch of the Delhi Police and now the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) have been unable to find any leads into his disappearance. All these agencies have been reprimanded by the Delhi High Court at different points for their shoddy investigation into the case.[6][7]

The CBI, which was investigating Najeeb's disappearance, in one of their submissions to the Delhi High Court, stated that the Delhi Police had forced a false statement by an auto driver that he had driven Najeeb to Jamia Milia Islamia University on the day of his disappearance.[8] The Delhi Police had used this fabricated evidence to pursue a theory that Najeeb had left the campus on his own volition.[9] It had also used Najeeb's medical history to assert that he was mentally disturbed.[10][11] After being unable to prove any connection between his medical condition and his disappearance, the Delhi Police quietly dropped this line of investigation.[12]


Role of JNU Administration

The Jawaharlal Nehru University administration was accused of partisanship and inaction to protect Najeeb's assaulters by the JNU student community, which blockaded the administration block for 20 hours on 23 October 2016.[13] The administration had issued circulars calling Najeeb an accused which had angered students on campus. After it issued a 25-point bulletin on Najeeb where it did not mention his assault the night before, the JNU Teachers' Association (JNUTA) blamed the administration for their apathy and bias in handling the issue [14] and criticized the bulletin released by the university for 'selectively omitting' the fact that Ahmed was attacked during a brawl a night before.[15] Najeeb Ahmed's mother Fatima Nafees also accused the JNU administration of insensitivity.[16]
