LOHRO is an acronym for LOcal radio station of the Hanseatic City of ROstock. LOHRO is a member of the German _Federal Association of Free Radios (BFR)_.[1] The radio station is maintained by two associations: _Kulturnetzwerk e.V._ acts as licence holder and __ supports the radio station and organizes trainings. The radio station meets its expenses by project funds of several organizations, membership fees of associations, and sponsoring.


History

After repeated trial operations, such as at the local Hanse Sail festival, LOHRO started airing around the clock on 1 July 2005. The programme was licensed as a pilot project until 2010. The Media Analysis Committee of the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania authorized _Kulturnetzwerk e.V._ as a broadcaster according to its Broadcasting Act (_RundfG MV_) on 30 June 2010. Thereby, the existing frequency was extended to LOHRO for ten more years, effective as of 1 January 2011.[2]


Programme

A relatively fixed schedule contains daily, weekly, and monthly radio shows. Contrary to the common self-responsibility of each individual programme at open channels, the broadcast station takes responsibility as complete unit.
