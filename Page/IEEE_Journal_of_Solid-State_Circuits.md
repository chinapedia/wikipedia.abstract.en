The _IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS_ (JSSC) is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal on new developments and research in solid-state circuits, published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in New York City. It is one of the most reputed journals in electronics and is currently the highest cited journal in the field of computer hardware design.[1] It is widely considered to be the leading academic journal for publishing new developments related to integrated circuits. The journal also serves as a companion venue for expanding on work presented at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference, the Symposia on VLSI Technology and Circuits, and the Custom Integrated Circuits Conference.[2] JSSC currently has an impact factor of 5.173 and is edited by Dr. Jan Craninckx.[3][4]
