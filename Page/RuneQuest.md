_RUNEQUEST_ is a fantasy role-playing game first published in 1978 by Chaosium, created by Steve Perrin and set in Greg Stafford's mythical world of Glorantha. _RuneQuest_ is notable for its system, designed around percentile dice and with an early implementation of skill rules, which became the basis of numerous other games. There have been several editions of the game.


History

In 1975, game designer Greg Stafford released the fantasy board game _White Bear and Red Moon_ (later renamed _Dragon Pass_), produced and marketed by Chaosium, a game publishing company set up by Stafford specifically for the release of the game. In 1978, Chaosium published the first edition of _RuneQuest_, a role playing game set in the world of Glorantha from _White Bear and Red Moon_. A second edition, with various minor revisions, was released in 1980. _RuneQuest_ quickly established itself as the second most popular fantasy role-playing game, after _Dungeons & Dragons_.[1][2]

In order to increase distribution and marketing of the game, Chaosium made a deal with Avalon Hill, who published a third edition in 1984. Under the agreement struck, Avalon Hill took ownership of trademark for _RuneQuest_, while all Glorantha-related content required approval by Chaosium, who also retained the copyright of the rules text. In an attempt to also have a setting they could release freely, Avalon Hill also supported a new "default" setting, Fantasy Earth, based on fantasy interpretations of several eras of earth's pre-modern history, including viking and ninja supplements. Later Avalon Hill published generic fantasy material.[3]

A proposed fourth edition developed by Avalon Hill, titled _RuneQuest: Adventures in Glorantha_, was intended to return the tight _RuneQuest_/Glorantha relationship, but it was shelved mid-project in 1994 after Stafford refused permission, unhappy with Avalon Hill's stewardship of the third edition. In response, Avalon Hill, as owners of the trademark, began development of a mechanically unrelated game originally titled _RuneQuest: Slayers_. However, when Avalon Hill was acquired by Hasbro in 1998, the project was canceled despite being near completion. The copyrights to the rules reverted to the authors, who released it for free as _RuneSlayers_.

In 1998, Following the financial failure of the collectible card game _Mythos_, Stafford, along with fellow shareholder Sandy Petersen, left the management of Chaosium (he remained a shareholder in the company). Stafford had formed a subsidiary company, Issaries, Inc., to manage the Glorantha property and took ownership of that company with him. He partnered with Robin D. Laws to publish an all-new game system set in Glorantha called _Hero Wars_ in 2000. It was later renamed _HeroQuest_ in 2003 after the rights to that name, along with the "RuneQuest" trademark, were acquired from Hasbro by Issaries.

Mongoose Publishing released a new edition of _RuneQuest_ in August 2006 under a license from Issaries. This required that Mongoose recreate much of the function of prior editions without reusing the prior texts (the copyrights of which were retained by Chaosium). The new rules were developed by a team led by Mongoose co-founder Matthew Sprange, and were released under the Open Game License. The official setting takes place during the Second Age of Glorantha (previous editions covered the Third Age). In January 2010, Mongoose published a much-revised edition written by Pete Nash and Lawrence Whitaker called _RuneQuest II_, known as "MRQ2" by fans.

In May 2011, Mongoose Publishing announced that they had parted company with Issaries.[4] In July 2011, The Design Mechanism, a company formed by Nash and Whitaker, announced that they had entered a licensing agreement with Issaries,[5] and would be producing a 6th edition of _RuneQuest_. _RuneQuest 6th edition_, released in July 2012, is largely an expansion of the Mongoose _RuneQuest II_ rules aimed at providing rules that can be adapted to many fantasy or historical settings, and do not contain any specifically Gloranthan content (though they do use the Gloranthan runes).

In 2013, Stafford outright sold the Glorantha setting and _RuneQuest_ and _HeroQuest_ trademarks to Moon Design Publications, which had published the second edition of _HeroQuest_ under license in 2009; Moon Design maintained Design Mechanism's _RuneQuest_ license. In June 2015, following a series of financial issues at Chaosium, Stafford and Petersen retook control of the company. They in turn arranged a merger with Moon Design, which saw the Moon Design management team take over Chaosium. Shortly thereafter a new edition of _RuneQuest_, subtitled _Roleplaying in Glorantha_ was announced. It is based on the Chaosium 2nd edition, drawing upon ideas from later editions.[6] They also successfully raised funds through Kickstarter to produce a hardcover reprint of the 2nd edition and PDFs of its supplements as _RuneQuest Classic_.[7] The new edition of the game, officially referred to as _RQG_ for short, was previewed on Free RPG Day 2017 with the release of a quickstart module.[8] The PDF of the full rules were released in May 2018, with the printed book to follow later that year.


System

Character creation

As with most RPGs, players begin by making a player character. Player characters are devised through a number of dice rolls to represent physical, mental and spiritual characteristics.

Characters in _RuneQuest_ gain power as they are used in play, but not to the degree that characters do in other fantasy RPGs. It is still possible for a weak character to slay a strong one through luck, tactics, or careful planning.

Task resolution

Both combat and non-combat actions use a percentile roll-under system to determine success of actions. The game features mechanics for critical hits and fumbling. For example, if a character has climbing at 35% and his player rolls 25 on a D100, the character has succeeded. However, a nuanced range of results existed in every die roll. If a die roll was 1/5 of the necessary percentile roll or less, it was a special success, and if it was 1/20 of the necessary roll or less it was a critical success. Very high rolls (in the range 96-00) on the other hand, could be "fumbles" or spectacular failures if they were in the top 1/20 of possible failed rolls.

Combat

The game's combat system was designed in an attempt to recreate designer Steve Perrin's experience with live-action combat. Perrin experienced mock medieval combat through the Society for Creative Anachronism. The player rolls against the character's combat skill. If the number rolled is equal to or less than the character's skill level, they have hit their target. The defender has the chance to roll to avoid the blow or parry it.

The _RuneQuest_ combat system has a subsystem for _hit location_. Successful attacks are normally allocated randomly (or can be aimed) to a part of the target's body. In _RuneQuest_, a hit against a character's leg, weapon arm, or head has specific effects on the game's mechanics and narrative. This was a unique part of the game's combat system and helped to separate it from the more abstracted, hit-point-based combat of competitors such as _Dungeons & Dragons_.

Character advancement

Rules for skill advancement also use percentile dice. In a departure from the level-based advancement of _Dungeons & Dragons_, _RuneQuest_ allowed characters to improve their abilities directly; the player needs to roll higher than the character's skill rating. For the climber example used earlier, the player would need to roll greater than 35 on a D100 in order to advance the character's skill. Thus, the better the character is at a skill the more difficult it is to improve.

Magic

Characters in _RuneQuest_ are not divided into magic using and non-magic using characters. At the time of the game's release, this was an unorthodox mechanic. Although all characters have access to magic, for practical gameplay purposes a character's magical strength is proportional to his or her connection to the divine or natural skill at sorcery. The exact divisions of magic vary from edition to edition, but most contain divisions such as Common Magic, Sorcery, Divine Magic, Spirit Magic, and Enchantments.

Other rules

The _RuneQuest_ rule book contained a large selection of fantasy monsters and their physical stats. As well as traditional fantasy staples (Dwarves, Trolls, Undead, Lycanthropes, etc.), the book featured original creatures such as the goat-headed creatures called Broo. Some of its traditional fantasy creatures differed notably from the versions from other games (or fantasy or traditional sources), for example, Elves are humanoid plant life. Unlike other fantasy RPGs of the time, _RuneQuest_ encouraged the use of monsters as player characters.


Setting

With the exception of the third and sixth editions, which still offered it as an option, the default setting for _RuneQuest_ has been the world of Glorantha. The well-developed background of the game offered a breadth of material for players and game masters to draw from. At a time when many RPG settings were cobbled together, _RuneQuest_ offered players a vibrant living world, giving them a much more developed fictional world with established geography, history, and religion.

The Dragon Pass area

The original rules contained a map of an area called Dragon Pass, a region offered as the default setting for adventures. It is an extended upland, with not one but several passes through the surrounding mountains, each leading to different regions. This, together with the regional history, has led to a "melting pot" area, with unusually-high variety and concentrations of non-Human species, particularly for a largely-rural setting. The original _RuneQuest_ game was set during a period of invasion, offering further opportunities for game scenarios.

Prax

One of the areas adjacent to Dragon Pass, touched upon in the original rulebook, was the Plains (sometimes called the Wastes) of Prax. It is an arid, even blasted region, hostile to all but the native peoples whose founding god, Waha, created the Survival Covenant by which they live. The tribes are Beast-Riders, each riding a different species (but none riding horses, which are taboo); the Great Tribes (most numerous) are: Bison, High Llama, Sable, Impala, and Morokanth (the Morokanth are an oddity - intelligent Tapir-people, herding non-sentient humans). The Praxian tribes are inspired by ancient Mongol, Bedouin, Native American, and other nomadic tribal cultures.

Cults and religion

A key element of _RuneQuest_ flavor is a character's affiliation with a cult (the default _RuneQuest_ name for a religious group). Characters begin as lay members and progress through a series of membership levels, such as initiate or Rune Lord. This system offers narrative and mechanical benefits to players who chose to have their characters join a cult.

The basic rules described a handful of original and mythological gods. These were greatly expanded upon in the supplements _Cults of Prax_ and _Cults of Terror_.


Supplements

Supplements published for _RuneQuest_ second edition include _Plunder_, _Runemasters_, _Foes_, _The Gateway Bestiary_, _Griffin Mountain_, _City of Lei Tabor_, _Cults of Prax_ and _Cults of Terror_.


Reception

Dana Holm reviewed _RuneQuest_ in _The Space Gamer_ No. 19.[9] Holm commented that "Since this game contains a logical system, almost anything can be added to the matrix it presents. A gem of a game. You won't be disappointed."[10]

Greg Costikyan reviewed _RuneQuest_ in _Ares Magazine_ #1, rating it a 7 out of 9.[11] Costikyan commented that "_RuneQuest_ is the most playable and elegant fantasy role-playing designed to date. Its only drawback is that it does not cover enough ground for a full-scale role-playing campaign, and is, perhaps, a bit simpler than experienced frp'ers would desire."[12]

Forrest Johnson reviewed the 1980 boxed edition of _RuneQuest_ in _The Space Gamer_ No. 35.[13] Johnson commented that "An experienced gamer, who probably bought the rules separately [...] has no need of this edition. However, it might be of use to a newcomer."[14]

_RuneQuest_ was ranked 5th in the 1996 reader poll of _Arcane_ magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time.[15]

Jennell Jaquays comments: "After _RuneQuest_ and Glorantha, detailed fantasy worlds would become the norm, not the exception. Dragon Pass paved the way for TSR's Faerûn, better known as the Forgotten Realms, and Krynn, setting for the Dragonlance saga. But few would ever achieve the elegant but approachable rules complexity of the original _RuneQuest_ or instill a fervent loyalty in fans that would span decades."[16]


Legacy

Chaosium reused the rules system developed in _RuneQuest_ to form the basis of several other games. In 1980 the core of the _RuneQuest_ system was published in a simplified form edited by Greg Stafford and Lynn Willis as _Basic Role-Playing (BRP)_. _BRP_ is a generic role-playing game system, derived from the two first _RuneQuest_ editions. It was used for many Chaosium role-playing games that followed _RuneQuest_, including:

-   _Stormbringer_ (1981)
-   _Call of Cthulhu_ (1981)
-   _Worlds of Wonder_ (1982)
-   _Superworld_ (1983)
-   _ElfQuest_ (1984)
-   _Ringworld_ (1984)
-   _Pendragon_ (1985)
-   _Hawkmoon_ (1985)
-   _Nephilim_ (1992)

The science-fiction roleplaying game _Other Suns_ by Fantasy Games Unlimited, 1983, used the _Basic Role-Playing_ system as well.

Minor modifications of the _BRP_ rules were introduced in every one of those games, to suit the flavor of each game's universe. _Pendragon_ used a 1-20 scale and 1d20 roll instead of a percentile scale and 1d100.[17] _Prince Valiant: The Story-Telling Game_ (1989), which used coin tosses instead of dice rolls, is the only Chaosium-published role-playing game that does not use any variant of the _BRP_ system.

In 2004, Chaosium released a print-on-demand version of the 3rd edition _RuneQuest_ rules with the trademarks removed under the titles _Basic Roleplaying Players Book_, _Basic Roleplaying Magic Book_, and _Basic Roleplaying Creatures Book_. That same year, Chaosium began preparing a new edition of _Basic Roleplaying_, which was released in 2008 as a single, comprehensive 400 page book, incorporating material from many of their previous _BRP_ system games.[18] The book offers many optional rules, as well as genre-specific advice for fantasy, horror, and science-fiction, but contains no setting-specific material.

After losing the license to use the _RuneQuest_ name and Glorantha setting, Mongoose Publishing announced the release of a new series of books which are fully compatible with the _RuneQuest II_ ruleset under the title of _Legend_. _Legend_ was released in late 2011 under the Open Gaming License. Mongoose titles for _RuneQuest II_ were re-released as _Legend_-compatible books.[19] Similarly, after the announcement of the Chaosium/Moon Design merger, The Design Mechanism announced that _RuneQuest 6th edition_ would continue to be published under the name _Mythras_.[20]
