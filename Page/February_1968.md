Ten months after setting up the alliance, Bokassa would announce the CAR's withdrawal.[21]
-   British Musicians Ian Anderson, Jeffrey Hammond and John Evan, who had played under various billings such as "Navy Blue", "Ian Anderson's Bag o'Nails" and "Bag o'Blues", appeared in concert for the first time under the name that they would become their trademark, Jethro Tull. Their talent agent, Dave Robson, had suggested that they borrow the name of an 18th Century agriculturalist and inventor, the Viscount Jethro Tull (1674-1741), who had invented the horse-drawn seed drill that revolutionized agriculture. Robson's reasoning was that the name "had a nice grubby farmer sound to it".[22]

Citing Mark 10:35, King would go on to say that one's ambition should be a life of service, and added, "I just want to leave a committed life behind." A recording of the sermon would be played at King's funeral.[31]

The _Ross Cleveland_ was the third fishing vessel from the English port of Hull to have been lost in Iceland within less than a month; the _St Romanus_ had disappeared on January 11 and the _Kingston Peridot_ had vanished on January 26, each with twenty crew on board.[34][35]
-   Greece passed legislation to end a practice that had been given the name "baby marketing", with parents legally selling their infants to brokers who would then resell them to purchasers in the United States and the Netherlands.

In 1966, the number of babies "exported" from Greece was claimed to be 1,000 per year.

In 2003, glacial movement at the level of one of the Chandrabhaga Peaks of the Dhaka Glacier would lead to the disinterment of several aircraft parts and the body of one of the servicemen, Bali Ram.[43] Three more bodies would be found in 2007 [44] On August 31, 2013, another soldier's remains would be recovered, although most of the servicemen remain entombed under the ice.[45][46]

-   "It became necessary to destroy the town to save it" became one of the most famous quotes arising out of the Vietnam War, as a news story by Associated Press war correspondent Peter Arnett was published worldwide about the death and destruction caused by American forces during the retaking of the South Vietnamese coastal city of Ben Tre. At least 1,000 civilians had died and 45 percent of Ben Tre's buildings were destroyed in the bombardment by American airplanes and shelling by U.S Navy ships, a measure taken as a last resort after 2,500 Viet Cong had taken control of the city. The quote (often restated as "We had to destroy the village in order to save it") was attributed by Arnett to "a U.S. major"; later in the story, Arnett referred to his interview with U.S. Air Force Major Chester L. Brown, who had directed the bombing.[50] The phrase, however, was actually coined by the reporter; Arnett asked the question, "So you had to destroy the village in order to save it?" and then attributed the words to Major Brown.[51]
-   Nine people were killed and 69 others injured in a fire and subsequent explosions at a meat-packing plant in Chicago. The blast, which occurred at 4:27 in the afternoon, happened when a gasoline tanker truck was traveling through an alley behind the Mickelberry's Food Products plant at 801 West 49th Place, and struck a pipe on the plant's outside wall.

Middleton, a high school student, had been visiting friends on the campus, and was shot four times.[57] On Monday, the college's NAACP chapter had organized a move to desegregate the All-Star Bowling Lanes near the campus; a brawl broke out the next day when more African-American students showed up at the bowling alley, and the day after, tensions were high as SCSC students made plans to picket the Orangeburg City Hall. The triggering incident was when a group of students was building a bonfire at the edge of the campus near the highway patrolmen's command post; someone threw a piece of wood and, whether intended or accidentally, it struck a patrolman. When other officers saw the man fall down, they began firing into the crowd.[58]

However, it was successful in easing the city's traffic jams; a reporter noted that during rush hour, "Instead of taking 90 minutes by car, Rotterdam's communters can now do the trip from one end of the town to the other in 12 minutes by subway." [62]
-   The Soviet government newspaper _Komsomolskaya Pravda_, whose audience was the young Communist Party members who belonged to the Party's youth wing, the _Komsomol_, published an unusually frank admission that the Soviet Union lagged behind the capitalist Western nations in almost every aspect of economic development. Noting that a 1961 prediction by former party leader Nikita Khrushchev— that the Soviet Union would surpass the United States in its standard of living by 1970— was not going to happen and was not even close to occurring, the newspaper survey presented statistics that Soviet citizens had 6.75% as many automobiles, one-fourth the number of radios, less than half as much new clothing and half as much meat and dairy products as Americans. The survey noted, however, that the Soviets were ahead in the number of physicians, the amount spent per student on education, and the amount of housing construction.[63]
