CADET COLLEGE KILLA SAIFULLAH (CCKS) is a military high school for boys in grades seven through twelve.


History

In 2008, the Federal Government extended help for establishing a cadet college in Balochistan to bring this province up to par with other provinces, thus providing equal opportunities to the talented and brighter students from Balochistan as well.

The project of establishing a cadet college in Balochistan was conceived in approximately 2003 to 2005. The President of Pakistan gave his blessings in 2008. The present site was selected in 2005 and the construction of the first two phases started in 2007. The college started functioning in 2008 with the induction of its first entry of 60 cadets.
