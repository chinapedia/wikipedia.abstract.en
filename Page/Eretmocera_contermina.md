_ERETMOCERA CONTERMINA_ is a moth of the Scythrididae family. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1926. It is found in Namibia and South Africa (Gauteng).[1][2]

The wingspan is 10–11 mm. The forewings are dark greyish-fuscous with an ochreous-white spot on costa at four-fifths. The hindwings are dark grey. Females differ from the males. The forewings are more distinctly marked with a white costal spot at three-fourths from the base and there is a pale beige spot at the tornus. In the basal two-thirds are some irregular, slightly paler (greyish) diffuse patches of scales. These are also discernable in males, but to a lesser extent. Adults have been recorded on wing in December and March.[3]
