_BOUND FOR GLORY_ is a 1956 album by Woody Guthrie and Will Geer. It consists of a selection of songs from Guthrie's _Dust Bowl Ballads_ of 1940 and his Asch recordings of 1944-45, each introduced briefly by Geer with spoken relevant extracts from Guthrie's writings.

By 1956, Guthrie was hospitalized with Huntington's disease, a hereditary condition. On March 17, 1956, a benefit concert was held for his children at the Pythian Hall, New York City; at which Guthrie made one of his last public appearances, sitting in the audience. Various folk singers performed Guthrie's songs, interspersed with readings from Guthrie's writings selected by Millard Lampell, a former member with Guthrie and others of the Almanac Singers.

The album _Bound for Glory_ was compiled and released following that event. The title was taken from Guthrie's 1943 autobiography, _Bound for Glory_.[1][2]

The album includes a cyclostyled booklet with an introduction by Lampell, and the spoken and sung words. It has been re-released several times.[3]
