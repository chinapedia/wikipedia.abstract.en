Background

The 2012 elections saw Plaid Cymru win 19 seats, independents 15 seats, Liberal Democrats 7 seats and the Labour Party one seat, leaving the council in no overall control, with Plaid Cymru three seats short of a majority. After the election the Independents agreed to work with Plaid Cymru, as did the sole Labour councillor, creating a coalition.

During the term Gethin James (Ind, Aberporth) joined UKIP but said that he would still sit in the Cabinet. This was strongly opposed by both the leader of the council Ellen ap Gwynn (Plaid, Ceulanamaesmawr) and by the leader of Plaid Cymru, Leanne Wood. He eventually resigned from his cabinet post and sat on the opposition benches with the Liberal Democrats; and lost his Aberporth seat in the 2017 election.

At the close of nominations on 4 April 2017, the numbers of candidates nominated were as follows: Plaid Cymru 35, Independents 27, Liberal Democrats 22, Labour Party 9, Green Party 5, Conservatives 3, National Health Action Party 1.[4]
