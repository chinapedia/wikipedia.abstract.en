WPI leader

Bhattacharya worked as a lecturer in English at Dibrugarh University, Assam, later shifting to Calcutta University, where he retired as Professor of English.[10][11] During the Sino-Indian War of 1962 cadres of the Communist Party of India, the Socialist Unity Centre of India and WPI were arrested.[12] Bhattacharya, as a leading party member, was one of the WPI cadres caught in this wave of arrests.[13]


Education Minister

Bhattacharya won the Ballygunge constituency seat in the 1967 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election.[14] He obtained 21,153 votes (53.74%).[15] He served as Education Minister in the first United Front cabinet 1967–1968.[16][17]

The WPI was split in 1976, with Bhattacharya leading the minority faction.[29] Bhattacharya was seen as closer linked to the Communist Party of India (Marxist).[30] He was expelled from WPI in early 1976, accused of 'anti-party activities' in the party organ _Ganabiplab_.[31] After his expulsion he founded the Communist Workers Party.[32]
