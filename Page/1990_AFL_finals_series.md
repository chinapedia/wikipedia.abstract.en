The 1990 FINALS SERIES was the first finals series to be played under the newly renamed Australian Football League. The series was scheduled to occur over four weekends in September 1990, culminating with the 94th AFL/VFL Grand Final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 29 September 1990. However, after Collingwood and West Coast drew in the Qualifying Final, the series was extended to five weeks, ending on 6 October. Collingwood would eventually go on to win the 1990 Premiership, breaking a famous 32-year drought marked by numerous Grand Final losses.


The finals system

This was the 18th and final season in which the McIntyre Final Five System would be used. With the introduction of the Adelaide Crows the following season, the system would expand to become a Final Six.
