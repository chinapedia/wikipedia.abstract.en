Preseason predictions

Preseason predictions for the Giants were generally positive. Ahead of spring training, _Sports Illustrated_ ranked the Giants 10th out of 30 teams in their preseason power rankings, saying that if the bullpen improves as expected, "there's enough talent here for the Giants to crash the playoffs yet again, despite a very quiet off-season outside of the Melancon deal".[10] Before the first regular-season game of the year, FanGraphs projected that the Giants would win 88 games, giving the team an 18% chance of winning the division and a 66% chance of making the playoffs.[11]
