_LEVEE BLUES_ is the second album from American band Potliquor released in 1972.

Work on Levee Blues began in February 1971 at Deep South Recording Studio, and even though it had been planned for release in May, the band did not complete recording until August 1971 with the album release coming in December.


Reception

Chess/Janus announced that they would be promoting the new album for Christmas sales, and the company took out a full page ad in _Billboard_ in December to promote five of its new albums, including _Levee Blues_.

A good review in _Billboard_ foreshadowed a successful run by Levee Blues. _Billboard_ reported airplay in Kalamazoo, Michigan;[1] Chico, California;[2] De Kalb, Illinois;[3] Long Beach, California;[4] and Bridgeport, Connecticut[5] in the first two months of 1972, and the album hit the _Billboard_ chart at #208 at the end of January.[6] "Cheer", a cut from the album was released quickly because of the early airplay it had been getting from national disc jockeys and entered the _Billboard_ Hot 100 at #98 on February 12, 1972. Five weeks later, a constant increase in sales lifted _Levee Blues_ to #168 and "Cheer" to #65.[7][8] This would be the high water mark for both the album and single. The album was reported as still getting airplay in Livonia, Michigan[9] at the end of the year.
