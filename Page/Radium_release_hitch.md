A RADIUM RELEASE HITCH is a load-releasing hitch using 3:1 mechanical advantage which is used in a two-rope technical rescue system.[1] The Radium Release Hitch allows a load to be transferred from one rope to another and is commonly rigged into the belay line prior to the operation of a two-rope technical rescue system.[2]

A radium release hitch is typically tied with 10 meters of 8mm rope and two locking carabiners. A reasonable length for the hitch (distance between the 2 carabiners) is 10 to 15 cm.[3]


History

The Radium Release Hitch was developed by Kirk Mauthner (who lives near Radium Hot Springs, hence the name) as a result of the extensive comparative analysis of release devices undertaken during 1997 through 1999[4]


Usage

-   Passing knots
-   Untensioning a locked lowering device or locked up prussiks.[5]


Tying

-   Tie a figure 8 on a bight at one end of the cord and clip it into the load carabiner on its spine side.
-   Clip the standing part of the rope through the anchor carabiner and back down through the load carabiner; bring the rope back up to the anchor carabiner.
-   Tie a Münter hitch on its gate side of the anchor carabiner. Ensure that the Münter hitch is in the release position with the in-feed rope toward the gate side of the carabiner
-   Secure the Radium Release Hitch using a bight to tie a half hitch on a bight around the entire stem below the Münter hitch, and then back it up with an overhand on a bight knot again around the entire stem.
-   Tie a figure 8 on a bight at the other end, and clip it to a secure anchor.[6][7]
