Streitwiesen_1990.jpg A _JUGENDBURG_, sometimes referred to in English as a YOUTH CASTLE, is a mediaeval castle in German-speaking countries that was converted during the 20th century into a public community centre or educational facility for young people. The sponsors of the original youth castles came mainly from the _Wandervogel_ and _Pfadfinder_ movement, or were at least linked to the youth movement.


Terminology

The term _Jugendburg_ originally referred to the use of castles (_Burgen_) by young people (_Jugend_).

The difference between _Jugendburgen_ in this historical sense and _Jugendburgen_ in the sense of castles that were used as youth hostels, for example run by the German Youth Hostel Association, is disputed. For example, youth hostels had already emerged in the early 20th century in the wake of the youth movement (_Jugendbewegung_) as accommodation for young men, youth groups and school classes. And as early as 1912 the first German youth hostel was established by Richard Schirrmann at Altena Castle (it was rebuilt from 1906 to 1915) above the town of Altena. During the Nazi era youth castles were used by the Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls, and the term was increasingly associated with Nazi ideology. From 1935 to 1943 there was also a schoolchildren's magazine with the title _Deutsche Jugendburg_ ("German Youth Castle"), which was published by the National Socialist Teachers League.

In connexion with _Jugendburgen_ one frequently comes across the names Gustav Wyneken, Robert Oelbermann and Karl Oelbermann.

In 1910, the progressive educationalist, Gustav Wyneken, was the chairman of the _Bund für freie Schulgemeinden_ and publisher of its magazine. He also tried to found a new school or "Jugendburg" to serve his progressive educational project based on the concept of upbringing as the "Formation of People in the Sense of a Worldview" (_Formung des Menschen im Sinne einer Weltanschauung_). For Wyneken it was about a redefinition of the relationships between teacher and pupil. This was to be based on "comradeship" (_Kameradschaft_) and "leadership" (_Führertum_).

Using his pedagogical approach, Wyneken influenced the emerging youth movement as an adult from 1912 onwards. Wyneken created the concept of "youth culture" in opposition to the perceived subservience of the Wilhelminian period as well as against school and family. In 1913, he worked on the formulation of the Meissner formula of First Free German Youth Day at the Hoher Meissner. Here, too, tensions arose, since Wyneken was a leader figure, a concept rejected by many groups at the youth day.

Fascinated by Wyneken's ideas, the brothers, Robert and Karl Oelbermann, dreamt of the _Jugendburg_ concept after the First World War. Robert Oelbermann is considered to be the founder of the "Nerother Wandervogel - Federation for the Establishment of the Rhenish Youth Castle" (_Nerother Wandervogel - Bund zur Errichtung der Rheinischen Jugendburg_). By "Rhenish Jugendburg", he meant Waldeck Castle in the Hunsrück mountains. The Nerother Wandervogel was founded on 27 March 1921 at Drachenfels Castle at Busenberg in the Wasgau region of southwest Germany.

The _Jugendburgen_ were mostly used to create an independent place of encounter whilst also preserving valuable historical monuments and giving them a new and meaningful use.

Nowadays, the aims of a _Jugendburg_ are unchanged; it is about developing young people away from the perceived restrictions and conventions of society.

As the numbers of scouts and youth leagues continued to rise, the castles became international meeting places at which camps could be held.
