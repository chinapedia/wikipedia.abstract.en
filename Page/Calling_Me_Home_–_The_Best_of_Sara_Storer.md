Reception

Susan Jarvis from Country Music Capital News said: "Over the last decade, Sara Storer has made an enormous contribution to Australian country music, with her fresh, original sound and her perceptive songs. This album provides a wonderful overview of her career, from her first single, "Buffalo Bill" through to several superb new songs, including "Calling Me Home", "Children of the Gurundi" and "Tears". In between, there are a stack of memorable songs. For those lucky enough to grab a Collector’s Edition of the album, there is a second disk that includes a swag of absolute gems: duets with the Sunny Cowgirls, Shane Howard, Paul Kelly, and Josh Cunningham, live versions of several songs, and another new track, the heartfelt "Darwin Love". This is an absolute treasure of an album, a must-buy for any Sara Storer fan, and anyone who’s about to become one".[4]
