MESO-PAPILIONOIDEAE is a monophyletic clade of the flowering plant subfamily Faboideae (or Papilionoideae) that includes the majority of papilionoid legumes. This clade is consistently resolved in molecular phylogenies.[1][2][3][4][5] It contains many agronomically important genera, including _Arachis_ (peanut), _Cicer_ (chickpea), _Glycine_ (soybean), _Medicago_ (alfalfa), _Phaseolus_ (common bean), _Trifolium_ (clover), _Vicia_ (vetch), and _Vigna_ (mung bean).


Description

This clade circumscribes six subordinate clades: one traditional tribe (Exostyleae) and five informal clades (the genistoids, the vataireoids, the dalbergioids, the _Andira_ clade, and the Old World Clade), as well as the genus _Amphimas_.[6] The clade has the following ICPN-compliant, node-based definition:

  The most inclusive crown clade exhibiting the structural rearrangement in the plastid genome (inversion of a ~50 Kb segment in the large-single copy region with endpoints between the _accD_ and _trnK_ regions[7]) homologous with that found in _Aldina latifolia_ Spruce ex Benth. 1870, _Holocalyx balansae_ Micheli 1883, _Maackia amurensis_ Rupr. 1856, _Wisteria floribunda_ (Willd.) DC. 1825, and _Glycine max_ (L.) Merr. 1917, where these taxa are extant species included in the crown clade defined by this name.[8]
