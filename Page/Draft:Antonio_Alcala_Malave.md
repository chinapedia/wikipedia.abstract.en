ANTONIO ALCALÁ MALAVÉ (Malaga, Spain, 1964) is a neuroscientist, s specializing in ophthalmology and neurology of vision. He has been awarded 4 national prizes in medicine by the Institute of Spain through the Royal Academy of Medicine (Best Cardiology Research Award in 2000 and Best Chronopathology Research Award in 2008) and through The Royal Academy of Medicine and Surgery of Cadiz (Best Ophthalmology Research Award in 2002 and Best Alzheimer's disease Rearch Work Award in 2005).

He is Corresponding Member at The Royal Academy of Medicine and Surgery of Cadiz (Western Andalusia) and Merit Member at Malaga Academy of Science [1] .

He is a specialist on the application of neuroscience to vision and emotions. He is a former professor of advanced studies in Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Pathology at the University of Malaga. He is professor of Regressive Therapy and Clinical Hypnosis and Neuroscience at the International Association of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis. His main line of research is based on the connection between cardiovascular diseases and dementias with vision. In 2001 and 2002 he publishes two works in which he proves that the Brodman areas 17, 18 and 19 not produce the physical-chemical phenomenon of vision, but can inform about the cardiovascular risk. Specifically, the papers reported that patients with high levels of cholesterol lose color vision and that a drug used for treating myocardial infarction (pravastatin) made vary from black to white to the full color spectrum. Between 2007 and 2010 he reports that the cardiovascular risk from hypercholesterolemia produces a visual failure when capturing the light which is measurable using computerized perimetry, a test that, so far had used for glaucoma diagnosis. He also reports connections between dementias and brain areas for vision. Nowadays he is searching for nexuses between human genome and vision. He also follows a line of research on experimental hypnosis searching for connections between emotions, thoughts and their influence on human genome.


History

He graduated in Medicine and Surgery 1989 at the University of Malaga. He studied his doctorate in Ophthalmology at the Instituto Castroviejo in the Complutense University of Madrid and at the Instituto de Oftalmobiologia Aplicada at the University of Valladolid between 1993-1995. Additionally, in 2010 he received a PhD in Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Pathology at the University of Malaga.

Scientific impact

-   Comparative study of the impact of diet versus pravastatin on color vision in Brodmann area 19 detected by computerized chromatic analysis (The CARDIOCOLOUR Study) is ranked 47th in the Top 100 Best Articles in Neuroscience. [2]

-   Statins improve visual field alterations related to hypercholesterolemia is ranked 4th as scientific discovery about statins [3] and 13th in the World's Top 100 Best Articles in Ophthalmology associated with cardiology. [4]. It is also ranked 44th in the world by relevance of the biomedical discovery on cholesterol and other lipids in blood [5]

-   Hypercholesterolemia produces visual field alterations detectable with computerized perimetry is ranked 9th as scientific discovery about statins [6] [7] It is also ranked 20th in the World's Top 100 Best Articles in Cardiovascular Medicine [8]).

These last two, are ranked 8th and 9th in the top best articles about retina and microcirculation published in the journal _Atherosclerosis_ [9]
