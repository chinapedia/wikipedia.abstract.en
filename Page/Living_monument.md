LIVING MONUMENT (, is a commemoration to the victims of past war in the former Yugoslavia organized by the Association for Social Research and Communications.[1]

Living monument is Edvin Kanka Cudic's idea of dealing with the past marking the anniversary of the crime, "disturbing" and recalling, so the public condemn the crime. In this way, the crime is visible in public, activists build monument with their body and show that the monument is built by the human body and thinking about the crime.[2][3]

Living monument builds up in front of the Sacret Heart Cathedral in Sarajevo. Besides Sarajevo, UDIK built Living monument in other cities and towns, such as Ahmici[4] Banja Luka[5] Belgrade,[6] Bijeljina, Brcko,[7]Višegrad,[8] Zagreb,[9] Priboj, Prijepolje, Srebrenica,[10] Tuzla,[11] Foca and others.
