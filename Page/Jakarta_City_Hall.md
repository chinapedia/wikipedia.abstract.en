History

Dutch colonial period

Balai_Kota_DKI_Jakarta.jpg The first city hall of Jakarta was built on 4 March 1621 together with the development of the city Batavia. This city hall, which has been converted into the Jakarta History Museum, was the original administrative center of Batavia.[1]

On 1 April 1905, the _Gemeente Batavia_ (Batavia City Council) was formed to allow greater autonomy in the management of the colonial capital. Initially, the council still operated from the old City Hall in the Old Town. The growth of the Batavia to the southern area of Weltevreden forced many government buildings to relocated their address to the south, including the city hall. In 1913, the council was relocated to Tanah Abang West (now Jalan Abdul Muis no. 35). In 1919, the council was relocated to the current building in Koningsplein Zuid (now Jalan Medan Merdeka Selatan no. 8-9).[2] At that time, the building no. 8 was used for the office and residence of the Resident of West Java, while the building no. 9 was the Gemeentehuis Batavia and the official residence of the Burgemeester. The building no. 9 was fully converted into a city hall when the official residence of the Burgemeester was relocated to a new building near the Bisschopplein (now Taman Suropati), now located in Jalan Suropati 7.[3]

On October 1, 1926, Gemeentehuis Batavia became the Stad Gemeentehuis Batavia.[4]

Japanese occupation and National Revolution

During World War II, the building was used for the office of , headed by a _sityoo_. After independence, the name of the building became the _Balai Agung Pemerintahan Nasional Kota Djakarta_ ("Great Hall of the National Administration of Djakarta City") with Suwiryo as its first native mayor. Since then, Jakarta's administration continued to be based in the same building.[5]

On July 21, 1947, the new administration of Jakarta was unable to operate when Suwiryo and the new government of Jakarta was derived out of the office by the Dutch government whom at that time had not recognized the Independence declaration on August 17, 1945. On March 9, 1948, the Dutch government formed a pre-Federal governorship to replace the former governance and converted Jakarta into the capital of the country. The name was reconverted to _Stad Gemeente Djakarta_ and remained so until the recognition of the independence of Indonesia on December 27, 1949 by the Dutch Empire.

Post-National Revolution

Since March 31, 1950, Soewirjo was reappointed as mayor of _Kotapradja Djakarta_ (Jakarta municipality). Around 1954, the city hall was expanded to include the building no. 8, hence now Jakarta City Hall occupied two building plots of 8 and 9. The office building of the High Commissioner Kingdom of the Netherlands which were located next to Jakarta City Hall was also used as government offices for the Mutual Assistance Regional Representatives Council (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Gotong Rojong). Office of the High Commissioner of the Kingdom of the Netherlands were then relocated to Jalan Medan Merdeka Barat.

Next development

In 1964, Jakarta was officially the capital of Indonesia.[6] The Governor remained an appointee of the President.

In 1969, the Jakarta City Hall expanded with construction of Building C (Balai Agung) and 4-floored building F.

In 1972, the government of DCI Djakarta changed its name to Daerah Khusus Ibu Kota (DKI) Jakarta following the implementation of the Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System. In the same year, the old colonial building located in plot 9 was demolished to make way for a 24 floors building G. Construction of this building was meant to be a pilot project for other high rises in Jakarta and a reference to lay out new regulations on high rises in Jakarta.[7] In the same year, the complex of the City Hall was expanded toward Jalan Kebon Sirih with the construction of building H. Afterwards, new buildings were established in the complex, which include building D and building F. In 1982, the DPRD DKI building was constructed in Jalan Kebon Sirih.

In the Reformation period, by 2007, the Governor began to be directly elected.
