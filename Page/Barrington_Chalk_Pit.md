BARRINGTON CHALK PIT is a 97.1 hectare geological Site of Special Scientific Interest near Barrington in Cambridgeshire.[1][2] It is a Geological Conservation Review site.[3]

This large quarry is the only surviving exposure of the Cretaceous Cambridge Greensand. Fossils include brachiopods and fish teeth. It is overlain by thick sequences of chalk and Totternhoe Stone.[4]

Large parts of the site are a working quarry which is closed to the public, while other areas have been filled in and are now fields which are crossed by footpaths.
