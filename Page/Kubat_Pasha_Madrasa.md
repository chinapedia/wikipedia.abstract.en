History

Madrasa was the main religious educational institution in Islamic countries. The Kubat Pasha Madrasa was founded in 1557 by Kubat Pasha, brother of Piri Pasha, a member of the Ramazanid house and a vassal bey of the Ottoman Empire.[1] In 1517, Ramazanids accepted the suzerainty of the Ottomans.[2][3][4]

The madrasa underwent many restorations in the past. During the restoration in 1969-1970, it was redesigned to be used as a museum, and it lost some of its original characteristics by this works. In 1999, the Tarsus Museum was relocated to its present building at the 75th Anniversary Cultural Center.[5] During the restoration works at the Mausoleum of Daniel Mosque, the madrasa building was briefly used as a mosque.[6][7]


The building

Designed in Seljuk architecture and built in ashlar masonry, the madrasa has a rectangular plan. Originally, the building had two stories with a single iwan around a courtyard. During the restoration works in 1970, the building lost its original form in great extend. It is a small quadrangle with 16 rooms around.[8] The vaulted rooms are fitted each with a fireplace. Entrance to the madrasa is through a decorated portal in the Seljuk architectural style faces southwest.[9]

In 2012, the Municipality of Tarsus undertook another restoration at the madrasa.[10] During the works, an inscription in Ancient Greek language, which is assumed to be from the Roman period, was unearthed at the base of the entrance gate.[11]
