The 1964 ARIZONA GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION took place on November 3, 1964. Incumbent Governor Paul Fannin decided not to run for reelection to a fourth term as governor, instead deciding to successfully run for the United States Senate when incumbent U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater decided to run for President of the United States.

Despite Goldwater being at the top of the ticket as the Republican nominee for President against Lyndon Johnson, Samuel Pearson Goddard, who lost to Fannin in 1962, won the Democratic nomination and subsequently the general election, defeating Arizona Republican Party Chairman Richard Kleindienst (who would later serve as US Attorney General in the administration of Richard Nixon). Goddard was sworn into his first and only term as governor on January 4, 1965.
