_BINANGKAL_ is a type of doughnut from the islands of Visayas and Mindanao in the Philippines. It is made from deep fried dense dough balls coated with sesame seeds.[1][2][3] It is usually eaten with hot chocolate or coffee.[4]

The name is derived from _bangkal_, the local Cebuano common name for the Leichhardt tree (_Nauclea orientalis_) which bears spherical flowers and fruits.[5]
