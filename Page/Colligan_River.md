The COLLIGAN RIVER ([1]) is a fast-flowing river in Ireland, flowing through County Waterford.[2][3] It is reputed to be one of the fastest in Europe.[4][5]


Course

The Colligan River rises in the Monavallagh Mountains. It flows southwards under the Scart Bridge. It passes under the N72 at Kildangan and turns eastwards into a wide estuary at Dungarvan, where it is bridged by the N25 (The Bypass) and R911 (The Causeway) before entering the Celtic Sea.


Recreation

The Colligan River is a noted salmon and trout fishery.[6][7] It is also used for whitewater kayaking.[8]
