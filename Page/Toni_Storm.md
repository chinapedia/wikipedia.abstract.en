Early life

Toni Rossall[1] was born in Auckland on 19 October 1995,[2] but moved to Australia's Gold Coast with her mother early in life when her parents divorced.[3] At age 10, while living on the Gold Coast, she discovered WWE on television and developed a passion for professional wrestling.


Professional wrestling career

Early career

Rossall began training at Impact Pro Wrestling's Australian developmental facility, and debuted for the company under the ring name Storm on 9 October 2009,[4][5] when she was 13 years old.[6] After five years of honing her skills in Australia, she decided she wanted to become a better wrestler; at the age of 18, she convinced her mother to let her move to England, where she moved into her grandmother's home in Liverpool.[7][8] While in England, she trained under Dean Allmark.[9] She started working internationally in countries such as Finland, France, Germany, and Spain.[10] Storm took part in a WWE tryout camp in Melbourne on the 2014 WWE Australian tour and the 2015 WWE UK tour.[11][12]

Progress Wrestling (2015–2018)

Storm made her debut for Progress Wrestling on 14 April 2015, being defeated by Elizabeth.[13]

In May 2017, Storm became the first ever Progress Women's Champion after defeating Jinny and Laura Di Matteo in a three-way match.[14] This match marked the first time that female wrestlers competed in the main event of a Progress event. Throughout the year, Storm went on to successfully defend the championship numerous times against challengers like Kay Lee Ray, Laura Di Matteo and Candice LeRae. She lost the title to Jinny at Chapter 69: Be Here Now.

World Wonder Ring Stardom (2016–2018)

In 2016, she began working for the Japanese World Wonder Ring Stardom promotion, where she won the SWA World Championship on 24 July.[15] On 2 October 2016, Stardom officially announced that Storm had signed with the promotion.[16] After winning the 2017 Cinderella Tournament on 30 April,[17] Storm also won the 2017 5★Star GP on 18 September, becoming the first wrestler to win the two tournaments in the same year.[18] On 24 September, Storm became the new World of Stardom Champion in an unplanned finish, when Mayu Iwatani was legitimately injured during a title defense against her, prompting the referee to stop the match and award Storm the title.[19][20] On 9 June 2018 Storm lost the World of Stardom Championship against Kagetsu.
