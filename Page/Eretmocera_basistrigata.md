_ERETMOCERA BASISTRIGATA_ is a moth of the Scythrididae family. It was described by Baron Walsingham in 1889. It is found in Cape Verde, Gambia, Kenya and Namibia.[1][2]

The wingspan is 13–14 mm. The forewings are blackish brown with a basal streak in the fold reaching the middle of the wing. There is a large, oblique spot at the tornus and beyond that a costal, much smaller spot. Both these spots are yellow. The hindwings are red in the basal three-fourths, but then gradually become darker. The apical part is blackish. Adults are on wing from September to February.

The larvae feed on _Clerodendrum_ species.[3]
