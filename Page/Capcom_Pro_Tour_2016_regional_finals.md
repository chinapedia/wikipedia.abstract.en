North America

The North American finals were hosted by Red Bull GmbH and held on November 4 to 6 in the Seattle Exhibition Hall. The first two days of the event featured an open bracket of 1,024 competitors, while the official qualifying tournament was held on the final day.[9][10] The event was named the RED BULL BATTLEGROUNDS and was described by _PC Gamer_ as a "high-budget, extremely well produced event," akin to a television game show. After the conclusion of the tournament, the character Akuma was announced to be added to the game.[11]

The top 8 of the tournament featured a large amount of well-established American players, such as Justin Wong, K-Brad, and Ricki Ortiz. The finals of Red Bull Battlegrounds was held between NuckleDu and Tokido. NuckleDu lost to Tokido in the first round of the top 8, but managed to come back through the loser's bracket and face Tokido again in the finale, where he defeated him through a bracket-reset. As NuckleDu had already qualified for the Capcom Cup, the qualifying spot opened up for another player on the global leaderboard.[12]
