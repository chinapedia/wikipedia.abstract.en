The MARK 5A is the designation given to new locomotive-hauled rail carriages being built for operation by TransPennine Express.[1]


Description

In 2016, TransPennine Express announced the procurement of 126 new vehicles from CAF, including 66 Mark 5A locomotive-hauled coaches, to be formed into 13 five-coach sets, hauled by locomotives. This would equate to twelve sets being in use daily with the thirteenth acting as a spare.[2] TPE68,_Northants_Loop,_Apr19.jpg These will be used on services between Liverpool and Scarborough, and also between Manchester Airport and Middlesbrough from late 2018, though acceptance issues meant that this date was moved to the first half of 2019.[3] Each set will be composed of 1 first class car with guards area and catering provision, 1 Standard class car with PRM toilet, 2 Standard class cars and a standard class driving trailer. In October 2016, production started on these coaches,[4] and in March 2017, CAF and TPE released a photo of the first completed bodyshell.[5]

The first completed rake was sent for testing at Velim railway test circuit in March 2018,[6] the second set being delivered straight to the UK in May 2018 via Portbury ahead of their planned entry into service in the autumn of that year.[7][8] TransPennine Express have branded their new trains under the general name _Nova_, with the Class 68 + Mark 5A combination given the name _Nova 3_.[9]

The first Nova 3 set was officially handed over from CAF to TPE, after a mandatory period of fault-free running, in April 2019.[10] TPE expect that the first units will commence passenger service in summer 2019.[11]
