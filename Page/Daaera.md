_DAAERA_ (Circle, literally) is a 1953 film written and directed by Kamal Amrohi, starring Meena Kumari, Nasir Khan and Nana Palsikar.[1] It was released at Bombay's Naaz cinema. Its story is loosely based on Kamal Amrohi and Meena Kumari's own love story.


Plot

The narrative deals with the dreams and aspiration of a 16-old-girl, Sheetal (Meena Kumari), caught in the vortex of uncertainty and morality. She is desperate for engagement with her neighbour, Shravan (Nasir Khan, late brother of Dilip Kumar), who is equally drawn towards her, but she is forced into meaningless wedlock with a sick old man (Nana Palsikar), a man old enough to be her father.
