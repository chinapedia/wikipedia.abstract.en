Club career

Brentford

Adept at left back or centre back, Owens began his career with Wingate & Finchley, before joining the academy at Brentford and signing a scholarship deal at the end of the 2013–14 season.[1][2] He made 43 appearances and scored four goals for the youth team before he was released in January 2016.[3][4][5][6]

Hayes & Yeading United (loan)

On 24 December 2015, Owens joined National League South strugglers Hayes & Yeading United on a one-month work experience loan.[7] He made two appearances before his loan expired.[8]

AFC Wimbledon

Owens joined the Development Squad at League One club AFC Wimbledon on trial during 2016–17 pre-season and impressed enough to sign his first professional contract on 9 August 2016.[9][10] He won his maiden call into the first team squad two months later, for a league match versus Bury on 18 October 2016 and remained an unused substitute during the 2–1 victory.[11] He made his debut with a start in a 2–0 EFL Trophy group stage loss against Newport County on 8 November 2016 and made his league debut versus Bury on 19 November, playing the full 90 minutes of the 5–1 victory.[12] He finished the 2016–17 season with six appearances and was nominated for the club's Young Player of the Year award.[13][14] An knee injury suffered while away on loan in August 2017 ruled Owens out for the majority of the 2017–18 season.[15] He returned to match play with the Development Squad in mid-April 2018 and was released at the end of the 2017–18 season.[16][17]

Whitehawk (loan)

Early in the 2017–18 season, Owens joined National League South club Whitehawk on loan.[18] He made his only appearance for the club with a start in a 1–0 defeat to Concord Rangers on 19 August 2017.[19] Owens' loan was terminated after he sustained a knee injury in training in the days leading up to the Hawks' match with Braintree Town on 26 August.[20]

Non-league football

Prior to the beginning of the 2018–19 season, Owens dropped into non-league football to join Isthmian League North Division club Maldon & Tiptree.[21] After seven appearances, he transferred to Southern League Premier Division South club Staines Town.[22] After just two appearances for Staines Town,[23] Owens moved across the division to Farnborough in late-December 2018 and finished the 2018–19 season with 19 appearances and two goals.[24][25]
