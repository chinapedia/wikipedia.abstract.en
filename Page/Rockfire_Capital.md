Rockfire Capital is a specialist investment management company, operating throughout Europe, with current assets under management approaching Â£500m (at September 2016).[1]

The company specialises in asset-backed, structured finance and is an active investor in several sectors, including energy and real estate.[2] Rockfire differs from other investment management companies in that it always invests its own money in any product or project recommended to co-investors.


Company Overview

Rockfire was responsible for the design and management of the first climate bond, launched in the UK in October 2014.[3]

In September 2016, the company bought a 61 megawatt solar farm in Swindon from WELink Energy Investments.[4] It is one of the largest in the UK and supplies enough clean energy to meet the power needs of 15,400 households annually.[5] The solar farm is built on land leased from the Science Museum Group, a non-departmental public body (NDPB), sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.[6] The plant has also secured a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with HSBC.[7]

In April 2017, Rockfire Capital completed the acquisition of two solar farm sites in Wales.[8]

Warrington, Thurrock and Newham Borough Councils have purchased bonds in Swindon Solar Park through Rockfire, making them among the first councils in the UK to invest in clean-tech bonds.[9] In the current low interest rate environment, councils are increasingly looking at alternative investments to drive returns to pay for frontline services.[10]
