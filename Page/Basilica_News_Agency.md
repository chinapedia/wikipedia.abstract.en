BASILICA NEWS AGENCY is a media institution in Romania. Basilica News Agency is the official online news service of the Romanian Patriarchate, as part of the BASILICA Press Centre – The Communication and PR Department of the Patriarchal Administration.


History

Basilica News Agency was founded as a department on 27 October 2007. The official website was launched on 16 JUNE 2008_Italic text_. The event took place in Europa Christiana (Christian Europe) Hall of the Palace of the Patriarchate in Bucharest. The ceremony was opened with a Te Deum service officiated in the presence of Patriarch Daniel of Romania.[1] “Christian mission means bringing Christ’s Spirit to the world, into every home, in every institution where we work, to every job, on every path we walk”, the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church said referring to the purpose of the inaugurated press service.[2]

The website www.basilica.ro was updated several times in order to facilitate the access to information. The first change of the user interface was made in 2010.[3] Next, in 2012,[4] the website was rebuilt entirely and relaunched during the solemn session of the Holy Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church, held on 28 October 2012. Another update version was made in 2014 and launched on the feast day of the BASILICA Press Centre, on 27 October.

The site currently operates on a WordPress platform. The current website was launched on 26 March 2016.[5]

Ever since the beginning, basilica.ro had an English version of the site. The main events of the Romanian Patriarchate are available in English for international readers.


The Basilica.ro Logo

The logo of the Basilica News Agency coincided with that of the Basilica Press Centre since its foundation until March 2016. The former logo presented the Patriarchal Cross surrounded by 5 concentric circles with different colours (blue, yellow, ruby, emerald, blue chalcedony), which symbolise the five components of the Press Centre. The News Agency was symbolised by emerald.[6]

After the change of the website in 2016, a specific logo was created for the News Agency. Generally conservative, the new logo contains the patriarchal cross surrounded by two red semicircles. The patriarchal cross symbolises the dynamics of the Church life in confessing the infinite love of the Most Holy Trinity.[7] The two semicircles are symbols of balance, but at the same time bring in mind the idea of movement, of dynamism. The red colour recalls the blood shed by JESUS CHRIST and His saints for the faith, being the strongest and most important colour in the range of colours. The colour is exciting, dynamic, and full of temper; it brings energy and vitality, and brings forth seriousness and dignity.


The role of the Basilica News Agency

The Basilica News Agency presents the activities and attitudes of the Romanian Orthodox Church regarding current problems. News and information are presented in electronic form and contain details regarding church life from home and abroad: activities of the Romanian Patriarch, decisions of the Holy Synod, activities undertaken by dioceses, monasteries, parishes, theological schools and ecclesiastical NGOs, dialogue between Church and society, inter-Orthodox cooperation, inter-confessional and inter-religious dialogues etc.[8]


Objectives

The main objective of the Basilica News Agency is to present especially religious information and events carried out within the Romanian Patriarchate, and also, in general, events that take place in the Orthodox world.[9]

Specific objectives:

• To cultivate an active relationship, based on dialogue, between Church and society;

• To maintain and develop the dialogue between Church and Orthodox youth;

• To support Romanian traditional values;

• To promote cultural and educational activities in society;

• To communicate the Christian moral values to the society;

• To promote education for poor children.


Motto

The first motto – "Good news shared with everyone" – was presented in 2008, once the website of the Basilica News Agency was launched. The phrase referred to the fact that the work of the News Agency is based on the original vocation of the Church to convey to the world the salvific Good News of Christ.[10]

The new motto – "The good to know" – was presented, in 2016, together with the new website of the Basilica News Agency. This motto summarizes in a simple and concentrated phrase the role and main objective of the News Agency of the Romanian Patriarchate, i.e. to promote religious information that is beneficial for the society.
