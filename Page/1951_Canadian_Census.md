The CANADA 1951 CENSUS was a detailed enumeration of the Canadian population. The total population count was 14,009,429, representing a 21.8% increase over the 1941 Census population count of 11,506,655.[1] The 1951 Census was the ninth comprehensive decennial census since Canadian Confederation on 1 July 1867. The following national census was the 1956 Census, the first mid-decade census to cover the entire country.

This was the first census to include Newfoundland, having joined Confederation only two years prior.
