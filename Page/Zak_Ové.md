ZAK OVÉ (born 1966) is a British visual artist who works between sculpture, film and photography, living in London, UK, and Trinidad. His themes reflect "his documentation of and anthropological interest in diasporic and African history, specifically that which is explored through Trinidadian carnival."[1] In work that is "filtered through his own personal and cultural upbringing, with a black Trinidadian father and white Irish mother", he has exhibited widely in Europe, the United States and Africa,[2] participating in international museum shows in London, Dakar, Paris, Dubai, Prague, Berlin, Johannesburg, Bamako and New York City. His father is the filmmaker Horace Ové and his sister is the actress Indra Ové.


Biography

Yorkshire_Sculpture_Park_(36691725306).jpg]] Born in London, UK, Zak Ové throughout his teens assisted his father Horace Ové on numerous film shoots, before earning a BA in Film as Fine Art from St. Martin's School of Art (1984–87).[3][4] Ové provided the video for the segment "Begin the Beguine" performed by Salif Keita on _Red Hot + Blue_ (1990, a compilation featuring contemporary pop performers reinterpreting songs of Cole Porter).[5]

In July 2015, Ové's "Moko Jumbie" sculptures, commissioned to tie in with the Notting Hill Carnival and inspired by aspects of African Masquerade, were installed in the Great Court at the British Museum as part of the _Celebrating Africa_ exhibition there,[6] before ultimately being moved to the Africa Galleries, with Ové as the first Caribbean artist to enter the museum’s permanent collection.[7] In March 2017 Ové's Moko Jumbie figures were installed at the British Museum as part of the Sainsbury African Galleries,[8] the first time in the museum's history that work the work of a Caribbean sculptor has been on permanent display in the African collection.[9]

In October 2016 his installation _Black and Blue: The Invisible Man and the Masque of Blackness_, comprising an "army" of 40 two-metre-high graphite statues, was assembled in the courtyard of Somerset House, where the 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair was taking place.[10][11] The journal _Art Radar_ described Ové's work as "one of the standouts of the fair",[12] and the _Financial Times_ reported that it had quickly found a buyer: "Modern Forms, a contemporary art platform founded by Hussam Otaibi, managing partner of the investment group Floreat, and Nick Hackworth, the curator who previously ran London’s Paradise Row gallery, bought one of three editions of the 40 identical, life-size sculptures of Nubian masked men, priced at £300,000, through London’s Vigo gallery. The plan is for Ové's installation to be part of a sculpture park that Modern Forms is creating at a property in Berkshire."[13] Ové's _Black and Blue: The Invisible Man and the Masque of Blackness_ is part of a series of new open-air displays celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Yorkshire Sculpture Park.[14]
