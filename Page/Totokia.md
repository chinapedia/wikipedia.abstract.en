The _TOTOKIA_ (also PINEAPPLE CLUB or BEAKED BATTLE HAMMER) is a type of club or battlehammer from Fiji.[1][2]

The _totokia_ was called the "pineapple club" because of the spiked ball behind the weapon's beak.[3] The name is a misnomer; the shape actually is modeled after that of the fruit of the _pandanus_.[4][5]

The spike ("beak") and head of the weapon were used to puncture the skull of the enemy and crush the head.[6][7] In addition to its functional use as a weapon of war, _totokia_ were also status symbols.[8]

Several museums hold totokia in their collection, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City,[9] the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,[10] the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa,[11] the Peabody Essex Museum of Salem, Massachusetts,[12] the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology of the University of Cambridge,[13] the Menil Collection in Houston, Texas,[14] and the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.[15]

African and oceanic art expert Bruno Claessens writes that the weapons carried by the Tusken Raiders of Tatooine in George Lucas' _Star Wars_ were inspired by the _totokia_.[16]

The totokia was featured as a melee weapon in the first-person shooter video game Battlefield 1. It was classified as a club weapon, and thus had medium damage and medium range.
