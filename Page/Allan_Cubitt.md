ALLAN CUBITT is a British television, film, and theater writer, director, and producer, best known for his work on _Prime Suspect II_ and _The Fall._[1][2]


Career

In 1988, Cubitt got his start as a playwright where his play, _Winter Darkness,_ won a Thames Television bursary award that funded a year long writer-in-residence program at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. During that year, Cubitt wrote and directed _The Pool of Bethesda_ in a production that starred the then Guildhall students Fay Ripley, Naveen Andrews and Peter Wingfield. That production of _The Pool of Bethesda_ won the Thames Television Best New Play and Best Production Awards. It was subsequently restaged at the Orange Tree Theatre with a different cast. This led to scriptwriting work at the BBC.[3][4]

Cubitt's first TV script was 1990's _The Land of Dreams,_ and was the story of an asylum-seeking Black South African struggling with his new life in the UK. The TV show featured the actor Antony Sher and was part of the long-running anthology _Screenplay_ TV series on BBC Two.[5] In 1992, Cubitt wrote the script for _The Countess Alice,_ a made-for-TV film starring Wendy Hiller and Zoë Wanamaker about the Berlin Wall coming down. The story was co-produced with WGBH-TV and was also part of _Screenplay._[6]

1995's _The Hanging Gale_ was a mini-series about the Great Famine in Ireland, and was Cubitt's first longer-form piece.[7]

Cubitt's first high-profile work as a writer was for the Helen Mirren mini-series, _Prime Suspect II,_ which premiered in 1992. Cubitt wrote the four-hour serial for her.[8]

In 1997, Cubitt again worked with Helen Mirren on the mini-series, _Painted Lady._[9] He wrote the part for Mirren.[10]

Also in 1997, Cubitt wrote the film _St. Ives,_ known as _All for Love_ in the United Kingdom, a romance featuring Miranda Richardson that was based on an unfinished work by Robert Louis Stevenson.[11]

In 2000, Cubitt wrote the script adaption for the _Anna Karenina_ mini-series which starred Helen McCrory and was made for Channel 4. It later aired on _Masterpiece Theatre_ in the United States.[12]

In 2002 and 2004, Cubitt worked on two separate Sherlock Holmes projects, an adaptation of _The Hound of the Baskervilles,_ a film project that starred Richard Roxburgh, and an original story called _The Case of the Silk Stockings,_ which starred Rupert Everett.[13]

In 2009, Cubitt adapted the Simon Carr memoir, _The Boys Are Back in Town,_ into the Australian film, _The Boys Are Back,_ that starred Clive Owen and was directed by Scott Hicks.[14]

In 2011, Cubitt adapted the Martina Cole novel, _The Runaway,_ which was broadcast as a TV series.

Cubitt created the 2013 BBC Two television series, _The Fall,_ from an initial pitch in 2009.[15][16] The initial pitch was for twelve episodes, which ended up being split over the first two series.[17] The show, which Cubitt characterises as a psychological drama, stars Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan.[18][19] Cubitt wrote and produced the first series, then wrote, produced and directed series two and three. Northern Ireland and Belfast are both a setting, a character, and an integral part of the show, and Cubitt wrote the majority of the show while based there, and cast the majority of the actors from there.[20][21]

Cubitt is also a composer. He wrote a number of songs for 1997's _Painted Lady,_ starring Helen Mirren. More recently, Cubitt contributed music throughout the three series of _The Fall._ He wrote Katie's songs and played guitar as she sings. Cubitt contributed two pieces of jazz music to the second series of _The Fall,_ specifically episode 3, which was arranged and played by jazz pianist John Donaldson. He also wrote the music and played guitar and harmonica and sang "Spector's Blues," the song that played at the beginning of the second series of _The Fall,_ episode 5 and again during Spector's dream in the car in episode 1 of season three.[22]

As of October 2016, Cubitt is working on a new British TV series as well as a play at National Theatre in London.[23]
