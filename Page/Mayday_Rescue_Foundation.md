The MAYDAY RESCUE FOUNDATION is a not-for-profit foundation registered in the Netherlands specialised in training, equipping, and assisting volunteer emergency first responders in areas of conflict, instability, and natural disaster. Its mission is "saving lives, strengthening communities." It was established by James Le Mesurier, a former British Army officer and United Nations staff member, in 2014, and currently operates primarily in the Middle East through offices in Turkey and Jordan.[1][2]


Activities

The Mayday Rescue website states that its purpose is to "partner with communities that are entering, enduring, or emerging from conflict or natural disasters by providing training and equipment, advocacy and outreach, and organisational capacity building for grassroots emergency response groups at the local, regional and national levels."[3]

Since its establishment, the Mayday Rescue Foundation's primary role has been as an implementing partner for international support to Syria Civil Defence (SCD, the "White Helmets"), for whom it has provided training, equipment and mentorship funded by countries including the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany; the other implementing partner delivering aid to SCD is Chemonics, which delivers a comparable amount of support to the White Helmets on behalf of USAID.[4][5]

Mayday Rescue is a separate organisation from both SCD and The Syria Campaign, a UK-based human rights organisation which advocates for protection of civilians in the Syrian conflict.[6][7] The Syria Campaign maintains an independent fundraising website, www.whitehelmets.org, which raises money to support SCD.[8]
