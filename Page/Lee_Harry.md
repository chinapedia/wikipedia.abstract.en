LEE HARRY is an American film director and editor, best known for directing the Christmas horror film _Silent Night Deadly Night 2_ and _Street Soldiers_. Along with fellow Burbank editor Joseph H. Earle, Harry was tasked to use his editing skills to make _Silent Night, Deadly Night: Part 2_ look like a different film than the original, which would then be repackaged as a sequel.[1] It has since become a cult horror classic.[2] Harry admits to being pleased by the reception the notoriously inept film has received.

He has done motion picture advertising trailers for Carroll & Co, Seiniger Advertising, Cimarron-Bacon-Oâ€™Brien, Vision Advertising, Kaleidoscope Films, and Buddha Jones.[3][4]

His dramatic short film _The Whistler_ was nominated at the Burbank International Film Festival (2015).[5][6]

Harry received a Student Academy Award for his work on _Button, Button_ in 1978. The film was screened by director Steven Spielberg.[7]

His other accolades include a Hollywood Reporter 2008 Movie Marketing Key Art Award, for his AV work on The Butterfly and The Diving Bell.[8]

He is a graduate of the University of Bridgeport.[9]
