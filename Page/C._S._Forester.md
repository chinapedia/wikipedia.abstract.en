CECIL LOUIS TROUGHTON SMITH (27 August 1899 – 2 April 1966), known by his pen name CECIL SCOTT "C. S." FORESTER, was an English novelist known for writing tales of naval warfare, such as the 12-book Horatio Hornblower series depicting a Royal Navy officer during the Napoleonic wars. The Hornblower novels _A Ship of the Line_ and _Flying Colours_ were jointly awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction in 1938. His other works include _The African Queen_ (1935, filmed in 1951 by John Huston).


Early years

Forester was born in Cairo and, after a family breakup at an early age, moved with his mother to London where he was educated at Alleyn's School and Dulwich College. He began to study medicine at Guy's Hospital but left without completing his degree. Forester wore glasses and was of slender physique; he failed his Army physical and was told that there was no chance that he would be accepted, even though he was of good height and somewhat athletic. He began writing seriously around 1921 using his pen name.


Second World War

Forester moved to the United States during the Second World War, where he worked for the British Ministry of Information and wrote propaganda to encourage the US to join the Allies. He eventually settled in Berkeley, California. He met Roald Dahl in 1942 while living in Washington, D.C., and Forester encouraged him to write about his experiences in the RAF.[1] According to Dahl's autobiography _Lucky Break_, Forester asked him about his experiences as a fighter pilot, and this prompted Dahl to write his first story "A Piece of Cake".[2]

Forester wrote many novels, but he is best known for the 12-book Horatio Hornblower series depicting a Royal Navy officer during the Napoleonic Wars. He began the series with Hornblower fairly high in rank in the first novel that he wrote, which was published in 1937. But high demand for more stories led him to fill in Hornblower's life story, and he wrote novels detailing his rise from the rank of midshipman. The last completed novel was published in 1962. Hornblower's fictional feats were based on real events, but Forester wrote the body of the works carefully to avoid entanglements with real world history, so that Hornblower is always off on another mission when a great naval battle occurs during the Napoleonic Wars.

Forester's other novels include _The African Queen_ (1935) and _The General_ (1936); Peninsular War novels in _Death to the French_ (published in the United States as _Rifleman Dodd_) and _The Gun_ (filmed as _The Pride and the Passion_ in 1957); and seafaring stories that did not involve Hornblower, such as _Brown on Resolution_ (1929), _The Captain from Connecticut_ (1941), _The Ship_ (1943), and _Hunting the Bismarck_ (1959), which was used as the basis of the screenplay for the film _Sink the Bismarck!_ (1960). Several of his works were filmed, including _The African Queen_ (1951), directed by John Huston. Forester is also credited as story writer for several movies not based on his published fiction, including _Commandos Strike at Dawn_ (1942).

He wrote several volumes of short stories set during the Second World War. Those in _The Nightmare_ (1954) were based on events in Nazi Germany, ending at the Nuremberg trials. Stories in _The Man in the Yellow Raft_ (1969) followed the career of the destroyer USS _Boon_, while many of those in _Gold from Crete_ (1971) followed the destroyer HMS _Apache_. The last of the stories in _Gold from Crete_ was "If Hitler had invaded England", which offers an imagined sequence of events starting with Hitler's attempt to implement Operation Sea Lion, and culminating in the early military defeat of Nazi Germany in the summer of 1941. His non-fiction seafaring works include _The Age of Fighting Sail_ (1956), an account of the sea battles between Great Britain and the United States in the War of 1812.

Forester also published the crime novels _Payment Deferred_ (1926) and _Plain Murder_ (1930), as well as two children's books. _Poo-Poo and the Dragons_ (1942) was created as a series of stories told to his son George to encourage him to finish his meals. George had mild food allergies which kept him feeling unwell, and he needed encouragement to eat.[3] _The Barbary Pirates_ (1953) is a children's history of early 19th-century pirates.

Forester appeared as a contestant on the television quiz program _You Bet Your Life_ hosted by Groucho Marx, in an episode broadcast on 1 November 1956.[4] A previously unknown novel of Forester's entitled _The Pursued_ was discovered in 2003 and published by Penguin Classics on 3 November 2011.[5][6]


Personal life

He married Kathleen Belcher in 1926 and they had two sons, John and George Forester. The couple divorced in 1945. In 1947, he married Dorothy Foster. John Forester wrote a two-volume biography of his father, including many elements of Forester's life which only became clear to his son after his death.[7][8]
