Description

_Eucalyptus dielsii_ is a mallet that typically grows to a height of but does not form a lignotuber. The bark is smooth dark grey bark that reveals fresh brownish and greenish bark when shed. The adult leaves are the same glossy green colour on both sides and lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are usually arranged in groups of seven on a pendulous, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are cylindrical to oval, long and wide with a conical operculum. Flowering has been observed in November and January and the flowers are yellow to yellowish green. The fruit is a woody cylindrical to hemispherical capsule with a flange around the rim, giving the fruit a shape resembling a bowler hat.[3][4][5]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus dielsii_ was first formally described by the botanist Charles Austin Gardner in 1926 and the description was published in _Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia_. The type specimen was collected by William T. Brown in 1925 near Salmon Gums.[6][7][8] The specific epithet (_dielsii_) honours the German botanist Friedrich Ludwig Emil Diels "who travelled all the way to Western Australia and gave so much to the history of the botany of this region".[9][10]


Distribution and habitat

Cap-fruited mallet is found in shrubland between Lake King, Ravensthorpe and Salmon Gums in the southern Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia where it grows in clay or sandy soils.[11] It can tolerate acidic or basic soils and is both drought and frost tolerant.[12]


Conservation status

_Eucalyptus dielsii_ is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[13]


Use in horticulture

The commercially available plant is sold as seed[14] or tube stock. It is planted as a windbreak and for erosion control as is known to attract birds.[15]
