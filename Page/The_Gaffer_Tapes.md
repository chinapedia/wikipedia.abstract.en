History

In 2014, Fantasy Football expert Ash Kernsworth, writer and broadcaster Craig Hazell and comedian Tom Holmes began recording podcasts during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The following August, they began an accompanying mini-league on the official Premier League fantasy football website. While the content of the podcast consisted of general fantasy football discussion, specifics such as prices of players and league positions were specific to the Fantasy Premier League game.[1]

In July 2017, The Gaffers appeared on Bournemouth goalkeeper Asmir Begović's Season of Sport podcast to talk Fantasy Sports.[2]

On July 3, 2017, The Gaffers announced that they were recording a live podcast at The Phoenix Artist Club in Central London which was recorded on October 24, 2017.[3]

On July 31, 2017, Craig appeared as a guest on talksport radio to talk about Fantasy Football. On December 7, 2017, Ash then appeared as a guest.[4]

The Gaffer Tapes were featured in the August 2017 edition of Stuff Magazine as their Number 1 Football Podcast.[5]

In February 2018 The Gaffers made a spoof football-chant video for Arsenal forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang that went viral across the internet, being shared online by Gary Lineker, Soccer AM, The Sun and ESPN.[6]

In May 2018 The Gaffers released a song for the England national team's 2018 FIFA World Cup campaign.[7]

The Gaffers were asked to be Judges for the Professional Footballers' Association 'Player of the Month' award for September, 2018.[8]

On March 5th 2019, The Gaffers officially announced that they had stopped recording podcasts. In total there were 139 episodes recorded between June 2014 and December 2018. [9][10]


Award

The Gaffer Tapes' popularity increased rapidly over the first couple of seasons and they were nominated as 'Best Football Podcast' at the Football Blogging Awards in both 2015 and 2016, winning the Judge's Award at the 2016 event, held at Old Trafford.[11]


The A-Z of Fantasy Football

It was announced in October 2018 that The Gaffers had signed a book deal with Pitch Publishing for a Comedy Fantasy Football book. The book was released on July 1st 2019.
