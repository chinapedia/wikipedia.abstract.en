A massive fireball was recorded above Siberia, near Yekaterinburg, on November 14, 2014.[1] The explosion apparently happened near the city of Rezh.[2]

Various explanations have been proposed:

-   The Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations said it was an on-ground explosion, but the Siberian Times, a local newspaper, reported that "the light was not accompanied by any sound".[3]
-   Regarding the meteoroid hypothesis, the Siberian Times also reported that "a local observatory indicated nothing fell from the sky on the day of the flash".[4]
-   Another hypothesis that was raised is a high-altitude nuclear explosion.[5]
