THE INCARCERATED WORKERS ORGANIZING COMMITTEE (IWOC) is a project of the Industrial Workers of the World. Its purpose is to unionize incarcerated individuals, and to end unfree prison labour, which the IWOC calls, "prison slavery".

On September 9, 2016,[1] the IWOC helped organize a U.S. prison strike on the 45th anniversary of the Attica uprising.[2] The strike involved an estimated 24,000 prisoners in 24 states, the largest prison strike in U.S. history.[3]

This was followed through with another prison strike on August 21, 2018. The strikers protested against so-called "Prison slavery", of which they made 10 demands. Two notable demands, for example, is that the Prison Litigation Reform Act be rescinded, and that inmates serving their sentences get their voting rights back, alongside pre-trial detainees, and ex-convicts.[4] This strike lasted until September 9, the same day the first prison strike started, and was supported by the ACLU.[5]

Despite the strike ending on September 9, some prisoners continue to go on strike.[6]
