The AGUACALIENTE WILDLIFE SANCTUARY is a nature reserve in the Toledo District of southern Belize. It encompasses approximately and was declared a sanctuary in 1998. The Sanctuary is critical for the preservation of biodiversity in Belize and the region.[1] The National Park protects the central wetlands areas which consist of three fresh water lagoons and a hot-spring connected by a number of creeks [2]hence the name _Aguacaliente_. It is co-managed by the _Aguacaliente Management Team_ (AMT), a consortium of people from adjacent villages.


Notable Features

-   The lagoons are a feeding area for hundreds of waterfowl including wood storks, endangered jabiru storks, black-bellied whistling ducks, sandpipers, and others. Many of the birds use the sanctuary as a transmigration point during their seasonal journeys.
-   The _Aguacaliente Wildlife Sanctuary_ plays an important role in flood control and water purification.The wetlands act as a filter for the Moho River Watershed, holding and cleansing runoff and floodwaters before they travel through adjacent villages to the Gulf of Honduras.[3]
-   The forest and savanna areas of the _Aguacaliente Wildlife Sanctuary_ provide habitat for a wide variety of animals including gibnuts|peccary, black howler monkeys, white-tailed deer, kinkajous, and endangered tapirs and jaguar.
