Career

The son of director Feroze Khan, Yuvan was keen to work in films and worked as an assistant director in his father's _Thambi Arjuna_ (2010). He then made his debut as an actor with his father's _Pasakara Nanbargal_, where he was credited as Ajmal Khan. The film had a low key release and received negative reviews from critics.[2][3] Yuvan made a breakthrough as an actor by playing the lead role of a school student in _Saattai_ (2012). The film opened to positive reviews, while a critic from The Hindu noted "Yuvan could work harder on his expressions".[4] His subsequent films _Keeripulla_ opposite Disha Pandey, _Kadhalai Thavira Verondrum Illa_ with Saranya Mohan and _Kamara Kattu_, a horror film co-starring Sree Raam, fared less well at the box office and earned negative reviews.[5][6] During the period, he also worked on Rasu Madhuravan's _Sogusu Perundhu_, but the film was shelved following the death of the director. Likewise another venture titles _Jacky_ was also shelved midst production.[7]

In 2016, Yuvan worked on _Ilami_, a period movie set in the year 1700, where he portrayed a youngster who excels at jallikattu. For the role, he put on weight and trained with bulls for his scenes.[8][9][10] Yuvan will next play the lead role in director Bala's next project opposite Pragathi Guruprasad.[11]
