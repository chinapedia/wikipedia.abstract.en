DYADOBACTER is a genus of gram negative rod-shaped bacteria belonging to the family Cytophagaceae in the phylum Bacteroidetes. Typical traits of the genus include yellow colony colour, positive flexirubin test and non-motile behaviours. They possess an anaerobic metabolism (oxidase positive), can utilise a broad range of carbon sources, and test positive for peroxide catalase activity. The type species is _Dyadobacter fermentans_, which was isolated from surface sterilised maize leaves, (apparently named after its ability to ferment glucose and fructose).[1]

Species of _Dyadobacter_ have been isolated from a diverse range of environments worldwide, including glacial ice, seawater and factories, however a large number of the currently described species belonging to the genus _Dyadobacter_ have been isolated from soil communities.[2][3][4][5] Several studies observing the microbiome associated with plants have identified _Dyadobacter_ species. These studies have recognized _Dyadobacter_ strains from microbiomes of corn, potato, canola, wheat and _Arabidopsis thaliana_.[6][7][8] In some cases, _Dyadobacter_ isolates have been shown to be one of the major cohorts of bacteria on plant phyllospheres.[9][10] It is currently unknown what role _Dyadobacter_ species play in these plant-associated communities.

Several species of _Dyadobacter_ have been identified as potentially useful in bioremediation. _Dyadobacter beijingensis_ was identified in a hydrocarbonoclastic community of bacteria remediating soil contaminated with crude oil,[11] and Strains of _D. fermentans_ have been observed degrading 7,8-Benzoquinoline, an azaarene with mutagenic properties.[12]
