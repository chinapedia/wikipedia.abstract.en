Personal life

Watt was raised by his parents, Connie and John Watt, in Pewaukee, Wisconsin. His father was a firefighter for 25 years and his mother is the vice president of an independent inspections company. His two older brothers, J.J. and Derek, both played at Wisconsin and are both currently playing in the NFL.[40] Derek is a fullback for the Los Angeles Chargers and was selected in the sixth round (198th overall) in the 2016 NFL Draft. J.J. is a five-time Pro Bowl defensive end for the Houston Texans and was selected in the first round (11th overall) in the 2011 NFL Draft. He was teammates with Derek at Wisconsin from 2012-2015. During his time at Wisconsin, Watt majored in retailing and consumer behavior.[41]

While the parents of the Watt boys surely had their hands full, the boys learned to turn their competitive drive to help each other get better in their respective position. When on family vacations, which the family enjoyed regularly, the boys would often stay together and improve on their skills. Towards the later years of oldest brother J.J.’s college career, however, it became more difficult for the family to travel without him being recognized, and the brothers even joked around about being his bodyguards when the fans would become too much for the football star.[42]
