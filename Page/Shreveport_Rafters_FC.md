History

In 2015, Shreveport-based brothers announced they would be bringing the first professional soccer team in the history of the city.[3] The team is named for the infamous Great Raft log jam which clogged the Red and Atchafalaya Rivers from the 1100s to early 1900s.

Rafters FC played their inaugural season in 2016, garnering an 8–7–3 record.[4]

Rafters FC debuted a customized jersey that became a viral sensation in soccer media as it featured a printed seersucker jacket and pink bowtie.[5]
