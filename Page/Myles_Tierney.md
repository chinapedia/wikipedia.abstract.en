MYLES TIERNEY (September 1937 – 5 October 2017[1]) was an American mathematician and Professor at Rutgers University who founded the theory of elementary toposes with William Lawvere.

Tierney obtained his B.A. from Brown University in 1959 and his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1965. His dissertation, _On the classifying spaces for K-Theory mod p_, was written under the supervision of Samuel Eilenberg. Following positions at Rice University (1965–66) and ETH Zurich (1966–68), he became an Associate Professor at Rutgers in 1968.

Tierney was named a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[2]
