Takht-e-soleiman-3.jpg]] AZARGOSHNASP FIRE TEMPLE () literally "_the Fire of the Warrior Kings_", is an ancient Fire temple in West Azarbaijan, Iran.[1]

The site includes the remains of the Zoroastrian fire temple built during the Sassanid. This temple housed one of the three "Great Fires" or "Royal Fires" that Sassanid rulers humbled themselves before in order to ascend the throne. The fire at Azargoshnasp was called _ādur Wishnāsp_ and was dedicated to the _arteshtar_ or warrior class of the Sasanid.[2]
