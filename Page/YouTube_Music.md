YOUTUBE MUSIC is a music streaming service and mobile app developed by YouTube; it provides a tailored interface for the service oriented towards music streaming, allowing users to browse through songs and music videos on YouTube based on genres, playlists, and recommendations. The service also offers a premium tier, which enables ad-free playback, audio-only background playback, and downloading songs for offline playback. These subscription benefits are also offered to subscribers of Google Play Music and YouTube Premium.

History

The YouTube Music app was unveiled in October 2015 and released the following month; its release came alongside the unveiling of YouTube Red, a larger subscription service that covers the entirety of the YouTube platform, including the Music app. Although redundant to Google's existing Google Play Music All Access subscription service, the app is designed for users who primarily consume music through YouTube.[3][4]

On May 17, 2018, YouTube announced a new version of the YouTube Music service, including a web-based desktop player and redesigned mobile app, more dynamic recommendations based on various factors, and use of Google artificial intelligence technology to search songs based on lyrics and descriptions. In addition, YouTube Music became a separate subscription service (positioned as a more direct competitor to Apple Music and Spotify), offering ad-free and background/audio-only streaming, and downloading for offline playback, for music content on YouTube. The service's benefits will continue to be available as part of the existing YouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) service, and to Google Play Music All Access subscribers. The YouTube Music subscription is priced in line with its competitors at US$9.99 per-month; the price of YouTube Premium was concurrently increased to $11.99 for new subscribers.[5][6]

In 2018, YouTube Music reached multiple sponsorship agreements with Dick Clark Productions to serve as a partner for its television specials _Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve_ and the American Music Awards.[7][8]


Features

The availability of music includes many of the releases from mainstream artists and extends to any video categorized as music on the YouTube service.

YouTube Music will initially operate in parallel with Google Play Music, but product manager Elias Roman stated that Google Play Music users will eventually be migrated to YouTube Music after it reaches feature parity (including the addition of features such as music purchases and a cloud-based library for user-provided music). YouTube Music product manager T. Jay Fowler stated that collections, playlists and preferences would be migrated.[9]

YouTube Music became available on Google Assistant smart speakers (including Google Home) on April 18, 2019, with feature-limited ad-supported playback available for non-subscribers.[10]

Subscriptions

The free tier usually plays songs in its versions of music video where applicable. The premium tier plays official tracks of the album, unless the user searches for the music video version. YouTube Music Premium subscribers are able to switch to an audio-only mode that can play in the background while the application is not in use. The free tier does not allow audio-only mode with background playback as it displays video advertisements.[11]
