DAVID A. FAHRENTHOLD (born 1978)[1] is an American journalist who writes for _The Washington Post_ and serves as a political analyst for NBC News and MSNBC. In 2017, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for his coverage of Donald Trump, including the 2016 United States presidential election.


Early life and education

Fahrenthold was born and raised in Houston, Texas, attending Memorial High School, where he wrote for the student newspaper.[2] Fahrenthold's mother is a teacher and his father a CPA.[3] At Harvard University, Fahrenthold wrote for _The Harvard Crimson_.[4] He graduated magna cum laude in 2000.[5][6]


Career

Fahrenthold joined the staff of _The Washington Post_ in 2000, where he has covered the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, the U.S. Congress, and the federal government.[7] He was a CNN contributor from January 2017 to February 2018,[8] when he became a political analyst for NBC News and MSNBC.[9]

2016 presidential election

According to a 2018 study, Fahrentold was the third most frequently mentioned individual or organization in Twitter discussions about Trump during the 2016 election. He was third, behind Trump himself and CNN.[10]

Reporting on Donald Trump donation claims and the Trump Foundation

Fahrenthold covered the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, reporting on the Donald J. Trump Foundation as well as claims Trump made as the 2016 Republican nominee that he had given away millions out of his own pocket.[11] In May 2016, Fahrenthold began an effort to verify Trump had made these personal donations. To solicit leads and for transparency, he periodically posted updates to Twitter via a hand-written list of charities he had contacted to ask whether they had received contributions from Trump, as well as the charities' responses.[12] After four months, Fahrenthold and colleagues at the _Post_ had contacted more than 400 major charities, with only one charity confirming they had received a personal donation from Trump between 2008 and May 2016 when Fahrenthold began publicly reporting on the question.[13]

Following Fahrenthold's reporting, the New York attorney general opened an inquiry into the Trump Foundation's fundraising practices, and ultimately issued a "notice of violation" ordering the foundation to stop raising money in New York.[14] The Poynter Institute described Fahrenthold as "one of the journalism stars of the 2016 campaign due to a string of revelations about Donald Trump's charitable giving (or lack of same)".[15] CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter said: "Some have dubbed [Fahrenthold's work] Pulitzer worthy. Its impact was reinforced on Tuesday [September 13, 2016] when President Obama cited the reporting while stumping for Hillary Clinton."[16]

On April 10, 2017, Fahrenthold won the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for his work on Donald Trump's charity claims[17] casting "doubt on Donald Trump's assertions of generosity toward charities".[18]

Reporting on the Trump _Access Hollywood_ video

On October 7, 2016, Fahrenthold broke news[19] of a 2005 _Access Hollywood_ video recording Donald Trump making what _Politico_ characterized as "lewd comments about groping women";[20] among other remarks, Trump said that his celebrity allowed him to "grab them by the pussy" without consequence.[21] An unnamed source called Fahrenthold at 11 that morning and informed him of the tape's existence; at 4 that afternoon, Fahrenthold published the tape and a reported story on it in _The Washington Post_. The newspaper said it became "the most concurrently viewed article in the history of The Postâ€™s website".[22]

The story broke two days before the second of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign debates between Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Staff at _Access Hollywood_, owned by NBC, had found the tape earlier in the week, and the show was working on a story but did not plan to run it until the following Monday, the day after the debate. Once Fahrenthold broke the story at the _Post_, both _Access Hollywood_ and NBC News ran stories the same night.[23]

Awards

In 2017, Fahrenthold won the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for his reporting on Donald Trump, including the 2016 United States presidential election.[24]


Personal life

In 2005, Fahrenthold married Elizabeth Lewis; the two met while attending Harvard. Lewis's parents are Harry R. Lewis, computer science professor and former dean of Harvard College, and Marlyn McGrath Lewis, director of admissions for Harvard College.[25]
