MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE, AND ARTS ACADEMY - EAST or MSA-EAST ACADEMY is a magnet K-12 school in St. Gabriel, Louisiana. It is a part of the Iberville Parish School Board. It opened on the ground of six temporary buildings of the St. Gabriel Community Center in August 2008 and moved to permanent quarters in August 2011.[1]

the school does not have its own on-site cafeteria but instead gets food trucked from East Iberville Elementary School. Around that time several St. Gabriel and East Bank residents complained about the district not giving a cafeteria to and instead giving improvements to Mathematics, Science, and Arts Academy - West. In a five-year period ending in 2013, around 56% of the students at MSA East and East Iberville School, also in St. Gabriel, performed at or above grade level, and the Louisiana State Department of Education consistently gave both schools "C" ratings. For these reasons, St. Gabriel city officials that year suggested seceding from Iberville schools.[2]
