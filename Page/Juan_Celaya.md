JUAN GABRIEL CELAYA (born 14 February 1992) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a defender for Deportivo Morón.[1][2]


Career

Celaya began in the youth of his local side Unión de Arroyo Seco.[3] His senior career began with Tigre in 2010, but he left two years later to sign for Primera B Metropolitana team Villa Dálmine.[4][5] He went onto make ninety-three league appearances and scored four goals between 2012 and 2016 for the club, nine of those appearances and one of those goals came in the promotion-winning (to Primera B Nacional) season of 2014.[6] In 2016, Celaya had two loan spells away from Villa Dálmine. Firstly, on 6 January, Celaya joined Argentine Primera División side Quilmes.[7][8]

He participated in twelve league fixtures for Quilmes before terminating his loan due to disagreements with the club.[9] In June 2016, Celaya joined another Primera División team, Arsenal de Sarandí, on loan.[10][11] He made his debut for Arsenal on 27 August against Sarmiento.[12] Celaya made just one further appearance before returning to his parent club.[13] Celaya made his 100th career appearance for Villa Dálmine on 12 November 2017 versus Estudiantes.[14] Celaya made a move to fellow Primera B Nacional squad Deportivo Morón in June 2018.[15]
