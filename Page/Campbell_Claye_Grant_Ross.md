In 1856, he married Matilda Elderton, daughter of Edward Merrick Elderton. They had 10 children, the eldest of whom was the physician Sir Ronald Ross, winner of the Nobel Prize for medicine. Sir Ronald's grandson David Campbell Ross (born 1934) was named Chief of Clan Ross in 1999.[6]

He died in Eastbourne, aged 68, and was buried at Ocklynge Cemetery.[7]
