Synopsis

Qingchen (Cecilia Liu), a sorceress of the Mages, a group of Wu shamans tasked with protecting the royal family, and Yuan Ling (William Chan), fourth prince of Great Wei, were born with the destiny of the dual stars, which makes them fall in love at first sight, but with their love follows calamity; however, as Qingchen is the Great Sorceress of the Mages and can't marry into the royal family. At first she attempts to fight her feelings for the Prince for the sake of the kingdom, but at the end believes in their love. When Ling legitimately ascends to the throne, he decides to marry Qingchen despite the opposition of both the royal court and Mages. Seventh prince Yuan Zhan, who hungers after the throne, launches a coup on the day of the wedding ceremony, and Qingchen uses the Sacred Pebbles of Nine Transformations to create a new timeline in an effort to prevent the imminent bloodshed. The Sacred Pebbles send the sorceress a year before the coup, but in a parallel world where no one knows her and with people who now have different histories, most notably the Seventh Prince Yuan Zhan. Forearmed with the knowledge of the dual stars and calamity, the sorceress now makes it her quest to prevent Yuan Ling from falling in love with her and fulfill his destiny to become Great Wei's greatest emperor.

Production

The series is helmed by the team behind the 2015 hit drama _The Journey of Flower_; producer Tang Lijun, director Lin Yufen and scriptwriter Rao Jun.[3][4] Other notable cast members include style director William Chang, who won a Golden Horse nomination for Best Costume Design with _The Grandmaster_; costume designer Fang Sizhe (_Noble Aspirations_), artistic director Chen Haozhi (_Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_, _The Last Supper_) and stunt coordinator Cao Hua, who often works with director Zhang Yimou.[5] The White Rabbit Entertainment, helmed by cinematographer Charles Lee (_Monster Hunt_), handles the special effects; they are the first Chinese company to attain the Content Protection & Security Program (CPS Program) by the Content Delivery & Security Association (CDSA).[6][7]

The script was completed in two years. Scriptwriter Rao Jun received the help of the original author to ensure a faithful adaptation.[8] Together, they made innovations to the novel, improved the characters and the plot at the same time, and added new ideological contents, along with elements of oriental fantasy such as double time and space.[9] In designing the clothes, William Chang referred largely to the Western Wei Dynasty style.[10] A 30,000 square meters set was built from scratch.[11] It took two weeks to make each of Liu Shishi's costumes by hand, and three months for the twenty different hairstyles; the team also spent almost five months on the preparation of more than 500 armours.[12]

Principal photography officially begun on 24 October 2016,[13][14] and wrapped up filming on 20 March 2017.[15][16] The first trailer, titled "Tears, Kiss, Forgetfulness" (), was released on May 15.[17]
