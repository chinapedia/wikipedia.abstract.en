Early life and education

Morgan Freeman was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee. He is the son of Mayme Edna (née Revere; 1912–2000), a teacher,[6] and Morgan Porterfield Freeman (July 6, 1915 – April 27, 1961),[7][8] a barber, who died of cirrhosis in 1961.[9] He has three older siblings. According to a DNA analysis, some of his ancestors were from Niger.[10] In 2008, a DNA test suggested that among all of his African ancestors, a little over one-quarter came from the area that stretches from present-day Senegal to Liberia and three-quarters came from the Congo-Angola region.[11] Freeman was sent as an infant to his paternal grandmother in Charleston, Mississippi.[12][13][14] He moved frequently during his childhood, living in Greenwood, Mississippi; Gary, Indiana; and finally Chicago, Illinois.[15] When Freeman was 16 years old, he almost died of pneumonia.[16]

Freeman made his acting debut at age nine, playing the lead role in a school play. He then attended Broad Street High School, a building which serves today as Threadgill Elementary School, in Greenwood, Mississippi.[17] At age 12, he won a statewide drama competition, and while still at Broad Street High School, he performed in a radio show based in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1955, he graduated from Broad Street, but turned down a partial drama scholarship from Jackson State University, opting instead to enlist in the United States Air Force[18] and served as an Automatic Tracking Radar Repairman, rising to the rank of Airman 1st Class.[19]

After four years in the military, he moved to Los Angeles, California, took acting lessons at the Pasadena Playhouse and dancing lessons in San Francisco in the early 1960s, and worked as a transcript clerk at Los Angeles City College.[20]


Career

Acting career

During the early 1960s, Freeman worked as a dancer at the 1964 World's Fair and was a member of the Opera Ring musical theater group in San Francisco. He acted in a touring company version of _The Royal Hunt of the Sun,_ and also appeared as an extra in the 1965 film _The Pawnbroker._ Freeman made his off-Broadway debut in 1967, opposite Viveca Lindfors in _The Nigger Lovers_[21] (about the Freedom Riders during the American Civil Rights Movement), before debuting on Broadway in 1968's all-black version of _Hello, Dolly!_ which also starred Pearl Bailey and Cab Calloway.[22]

Although his first credited film appearance was in 1971's _Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow!_, Freeman first became known in the American media through roles on the soap opera _Another World_ and the PBS kids' show _The Electric Company_[23] (notably as Easy Reader, Mel Mounds the DJ, and Vincent the Vegetable Vampire^([clip])).

Joan Ganz Cooney claims that Freeman hated doing _The Electric Company_, saying "it was a very unhappy period in his life."[24] Freeman himself admitted in an interview that he never thinks about his tenure with the show, but he acknowledged that, contrary to Cooney’s claims, he was glad to have been a part of it.[25] Since then, Freeman has considered his _Street Smart_ (1987) character Fast Black, rather than any of the characters he played in _The Electric Company_, to be his breakthrough role.[26][27]

Freeman continued to be involved in theater work and received the Obie Award in 1980 for the title role in _Coriolanus_. In 1984, he received his second Obie Award for his role as the preacher in _The Gospel at Colonus_. Freeman also won a Drama Desk Award and a Clarence Derwent Award for his role as a wino in _The Mighty Gents_. He received his third Obie Award for his role as a chauffeur for a Jewish widow in _Driving Miss Daisy_, which was adapted for the screen in 1989.[28]

Beginning in the mid-1980s, Freeman began playing prominent supporting roles in feature films, earning him a reputation for depicting wise, fatherly characters.[29] As he gained fame, he went on to bigger roles in films such as the chauffeur Hoke in _Driving Miss Daisy_, and Sergeant Major Rawlins in _Glory_ (both in 1989).[30] In 1994, he portrayed Red, the redeemed convict in the acclaimed _The Shawshank Redemption_. In the same year he was a member of the jury at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival.[31] He also starred in such films as _Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves_, _Unforgiven_, _Seven_, and _Deep Impact_. In 1997, Freeman, together with Lori McCreary, founded the film production company Revelations Entertainment, and the two co-head its sister online film distribution company ClickStar. Freeman also hosts the channel _Our Space_ on ClickStar, with specially crafted film clips in which he shares his love for the sciences, especially space exploration and aeronautics.

After three previous nominations – a Best Supporting Actor nomination for _Street Smart_, and Best Actor nominations for _Driving Miss Daisy_ and _The Shawshank Redemption_—he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in _Million Dollar Baby_ at the 77th Academy Awards.[32] Freeman is recognized for his distinctive voice, making him a frequent choice for narration. In 2005 alone, he provided narration for two films, _War of the Worlds_ and the Academy Award-winning documentary film _March of the Penguins_.

Freeman appeared as God in the hit film _Bruce Almighty_ and its sequel, _Evan Almighty_. He appeared in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy – _Batman Begins_ (2005) and its sequels, _The Dark Knight_ (2008) and _The Dark Knight Rises_ (2012) – as Lucius Fox. He starred in Rob Reiner's 2007 film _The Bucket List_, opposite Jack Nicholson. He teamed with Christopher Walken and William H. Macy for the comedy _The Maiden Heist_, which was released direct to video due to financial problems with the distribution company. In 2008, Freeman returned to Broadway to co-star with Frances McDormand and Peter Gallagher for a limited engagement of Clifford Odets' play, _The Country Girl_, directed by Mike Nichols.

Freeman wanted to do a film based on Nelson Mandela for some time. At first he tried to get Mandela's autobiography _Long Walk to Freedom_ adapted into a finished script, but it was not finalized.[33] In 2007, he purchased the film rights to a book by John Carlin, _Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation_.[34] Clint Eastwood directed the Nelson Mandela bio-pic titled _Invictus_, starring Freeman as Mandela and Matt Damon as rugby team captain Francois Pienaar.[35]

In 2010, Freeman co-starred alongside Bruce Willis in _Red_.[36]

In 2011, Freeman was featured with John Lithgow in the Broadway debut of Dustin Lance Black's play, _8_, a staged reenactment of _Perry v. Brown_, the federal trial that overturned California's Proposition 8 ban on same-sex marriage. Freeman played Attorney David Boies.[37] The production was held at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre in New York City to raise money for the American Foundation for Equal Rights.[38][39]

In 2013, Freeman appeared in the action-thriller _Olympus Has Fallen_, the science fiction drama _Oblivion_, and the comedy _Last Vegas_. In 2014, he co-starred in the action film _Lucy_. In 2015, Freeman played the Chief Justice of the United States in the season two premiere of _Madam Secretary_ (Freeman is also one of the series' executive producers). He also appeared in _London Has Fallen_, the 2016 sequel of _Olympus Has Fallen_.

In July 2009, Freeman was one of the presenters at the 46664 Concert celebrating Nelson Mandela's birthday at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.

Effective January 4, 2010, Freeman replaced Walter Cronkite as the voiceover introduction to the _CBS Evening News_ featuring Katie Couric as news anchor.[40] CBS cited the need for consistency in introductions for regular news broadcasts and special reports as the basis for the change.[41] , Freeman is the host and narrator of the Discovery Channel television show, focused on physics outreach, _Through the Wormhole_.[42] He was featured on the opening track to B.o.B's second album _Strange Clouds_. The track "Bombs Away" features a prologue and epilogue (which leads into a musical outro) spoken by Freeman.

Up until May 2018, Freeman also served as the narrator of a series of Visa commercials.[43]


Personal life

]] From his early life, Freeman has two extramarital children; one of them is Alfonso Freeman.[44]

Freeman was married to Jeanette Adair Bradshaw from October 22, 1967, until November 18, 1979.[45]

Freeman married Myrna Colley-Lee on June 16, 1984.[46] The couple separated in December 2007[47] and divorced on September 15, 2010.[48] Freeman and Colley-Lee adopted Freeman's stepgranddaughter from his first marriage, E'dena Hines, and raised her together.[49] On August 16, 2015, Hines was murdered in New York City at age 33.[50]

In 2008, the TV series _African American Lives 2_ revealed that some of Freeman's great-great-grandparents were slaves who migrated from North Carolina to Mississippi. Freeman discovered that his Caucasian maternal great-great-grandfather had lived with, and was buried beside, Freeman's African-American great-great-grandmother (in the segregated South, the two could not marry legally at the time).[51] A DNA test on the series stated that he is descended in part from the Songhai and Tuareg peoples of Niger.[52]

Beekeeping

After becoming concerned with the decline of honeybees, Freeman decided to turn his 124-acre ranch into a sanctuary for them in July 2014, starting with 26 bee hives.[53]

Flying

At age 65, Freeman earned a private pilot's license.[54] He owns or has owned at least three private aircraft, including a Cessna Citation 501 jet and a Cessna 414 twin-engine prop. In 2007, he purchased an Emivest SJ30[55] long-range private jet and took delivery in December 2009.[56] He is certified to fly all of them.[57]

Health

Freeman was injured in an automobile accident near Ruleville, Mississippi, on the night of August 3, 2008. The vehicle in which he was traveling, a 1997 Nissan Maxima, left the highway and flipped over several times. He and a female passenger, Demaris Meyer, were rescued from the vehicle using the "Jaws of Life". Freeman was taken via medical helicopter to The Regional Medical Center (The Med) hospital in Memphis.[58][59] Police ruled out alcohol as a factor in the crash.[60] Freeman was coherent following the crash, as he joked with a photographer about taking his picture at the scene.[61] His left shoulder, arm, and elbow were broken in the crash, and he had surgery on August 5, 2008. Doctors operated for four hours to repair nerve damage in his shoulder and arm.[62] On CNN's _Piers Morgan Tonight_ he stated that he is left handed but cannot move the fingers of his left hand. He wears a compression glove to protect against blood pooling due to non-movement. His publicist announced he was expected to make a full recovery.[63] Meyer, his passenger, sued him for negligence, claiming that he was drinking the night of the accident. Subsequently, the suit was settled for an undisclosed amount.[64]

Properties

Freeman lives in Charleston, Mississippi, and New York City. He owns and operates Ground Zero, a blues club in Clarksdale, Mississippi. He formerly co-owned Madidi, a fine dining restaurant, also in Clarksdale.[65]

Religious views

In a 2012 interview with TheWrap, Freeman was asked if he considered himself atheist or agnostic. He replied, "It's a hard question because as I said at the start, I think we invented God. So if I believe in God, and I do, it's because I think I'm God."[66] Freeman later said that his experience working on _The Story of God with Morgan Freeman_ did not change his views on religion.[67]

Sexual harassment allegations

On May 24, 2018, CNN reported the results of an investigation during which eight women accused Freeman of sexually harassing them, and eight other people said they witnessed his inappropriate behavior on the set of movies, while promoting his movies, or at his production company.[68] After the CNN story broke, Freeman issued an apology, stating "Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy. I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected—that was never my intent."[69][70] CNN also made several requests to the spokesperson for Lori McCreary, Freeman's business partner, but no comment was given.[71]

As a result of the sexual harassment allegations, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) reviewed what action, if any, to take against Freeman, as Freeman was recognized with a lifetime achievement award by SAG.[72][73] In September 2018, SAG confirmed that Freeman could retain his award.[74]

Following the announcement of the allegations, Visa suspended its marketing campaign with Freeman and stopped airing commercials that featured his voice.[75][76][77][78]


Activism

Charitable work

In 2004, Freeman and others formed the Grenada Relief Fund to aid people affected by Hurricane Ivan on the island of Grenada. The fund has since become PLANIT NOW, an organization that seeks to provide preparedness resources for people living in areas afflicted by hurricanes and severe storms.[79] Freeman has worked on narrating small clips for global organizations, such as One Earth,[80] whose goals include raising awareness of environmental issues. He has narrated the clip "Why Are We Here”, which can be viewed on One Earth's website. Freeman has donated money to the Mississippi Horse Park in Starkville, Mississippi. The park is part of Mississippi State University and Freeman has several horses that he takes there.[81]

Comments on racism

In 2005, Freeman criticized the celebration of Black History Month, saying, "I don't want a black history month. Black history is American history."[82] He opined that the only way to end racism is to stop talking about it, and he noted that there is no "white history month."[83] Freeman once said in an interview with _60 Minutes_{{'}}s Mike Wallace, "I am going to stop calling you a white man and I'm going to ask you to stop calling me a black man."[84][85] Freeman supported the defeated proposal to change the Mississippi state flag, which contains the Confederate battle flag.[86][87] Freeman sparked controversy in 2011 when, on CNN's _Piers Morgan Tonight_, he accused the Tea Party movement of racism.[88][89][90]

In reaction to the death of Freddie Gray and the 2015 Baltimore protests, Freeman said he was "absolutely" supportive of the protesters. "That unrest [in Baltimore] has nothing to do with terrorism at all, except the terrorism we suffer from the police. [...] Because of the technology—everybody has a smartphone—now we can see what the police are doing. We can show the world, Look, this is what happened in that situation. So why are so many people dying in police custody? And why are they all black? And why are all the police killing them white? What is that? The police have always said, 'I feared for my safety.' Well, now we know. OK. You feared for your safety while a guy was running away from you, right?"[91]

Politics

Freeman endorsed Barack Obama's candidacy for the 2008 presidential election, although he stated that he would not join Obama's campaign.[92] He narrated for The Hall of Presidents with Obama, when he was added to the exhibit.[93][94] The Hall of Presidents re-opened on July 4, 2009, at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida.[95] Freeman joined President Bill Clinton, USA Bid Committee Chairman Sunil Gulati, and USMNT midfielder Landon Donovan on December 1, 2010, in Zurich for the U.S. bid committee's final presentation to FIFA for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[96] On day four of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Morgan Freeman provided the voiceover for the video introduction of Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.[97][98]

On September 19, 2017, Freeman featured in a video by the Committee to Investigate Russia group.[99] In the video, Freeman declared "we are at war" with Russia.[100] In April 2018, Freeman met with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.[101]
