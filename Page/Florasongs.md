_FLORASONGS_ (stylized _FLORASONGS_) is an EP by the American indie rock band The Decemberists, released on October 9, 2015, on Capitol Records. The release is composed of five out-takes from their seventh studio album, _What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World_.


Reception

Critical reception to _florasongs_ was mixed, but mostly positive. The EP did not receive a rating from an aggregate score website, but it did garner reviews from primarily independent music criticism websites. Pitchfork's Evan Rytlewski wrote in his review, "Unlike its full-length counterpart, though, Florasongs has brevity working in its favor." Rytlewski later penned, "Florasongs never overcomes the sense that they’re selling themselves short, penning good-enough songs when they used to shoot for grand, great ones."
