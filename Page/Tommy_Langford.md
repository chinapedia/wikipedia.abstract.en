THOMAS LANGFORD (born 12 July 1989) is a British professional boxer. He held the British middleweight title from 2016 to 2018, and the Commonwealth middleweight title in 2016.[1]


Professional career

Langford made his professional debut on 8 September 2012, winning a four-round points decision against Steve Spence. On 4 July 2015, Langford won his first regional championship—the vacant WBO Inter-Continental middleweight title—by stopping Julio Cesar Avalos in four rounds.[2] A breakout year in 2016 saw him first win the vacant Commonwealth middleweight title on 12 March, scoring a unanimous decision over Lewis Taylor.[3] Langford was scheduled to face British middleweight champion Chris Eubank Jr. on 22 October, but Eubank Jr. withdrew from the fight in September due to an elbow injury.[4] On 26 November, Langford won the then-vacant British middleweight title with a split decision against Sam Sheedy.[5]
