OMARI JOSHUA CURTIS PATRICK (born 24 May 1996) is an English professional footballer who plays for Bradford City, as a winger and forward.

He trained at the FAB Academy and started his career in non-League with Beaconsfield SYCOB. He signed his first professional contract with Kidderminster Harriers and signed for his first EFL club with Barnsley, before moving to Bradford City a season later, where he made his Football League debut.


Early and personal life

Patrick was born in Slough.[1] His father is a Commonwealth Games Gold-winning athlete, and his godfather is sprinter Linford Christie.[2]


Career

Beaconsfield SYCOB

After leaving the FAB Academy, Patrick joined Beaconsfield SYCOB after having unsuccessful trials with Brentford, Barnet and Rangers. He scored on his debut against Bedford Town.[3] Whilst at the club he scored 14 goals in 49 matches over one and a half seasons,[4] and went on trial to Oxford United.[5]

Kidderminster Harriers

On 5 December 2015, Patrick signed a contract with National League side Kidderminster Harriers.[6] He made his debut from the bench on the same day, against Gateshead.[7] At the end of the season, following Harriers' relegation and 18 appearances, Patrick was offered a new contract.[8]

Barnsley

Following an impressive trial for Barnsley U23s, during which he scored against Ipswich Town U23s, he signed a one-year contract with the club on 21 September 2016. He was initially assigned to the development squad.[9][10] He never made a first-team appearance for Barnsley.[11]

Bradford City

He signed a one-year contract with Bradford City in May 2017.[12] Following some "impressive" performances in pre-season friendlies, Patrick was praised by Bradford manager Stuart McCall.[13] He started the first game of the 2017–18 season, scoring the winning goal.[14][15] Following an "impressive start" to the season, Patrick signed a new three-year contract with the club in August 2017.[16] He was dropped from the first-team halfway through the 2017–18 season, and also suffered a knee injury.[17]

On 28 August 2018, Patrick joined League Two side Yeovil Town on loan until January 2019.[18] His loan ended on 2 January 2019.[19]


Playing style

Patrick can play across the forward line as a striker or a winger. Upon his signing for Barnsley, Bobby Hassell said "he's quick and strong so he will be a dangerous asset in our attacking play. He is also very hard working off the ball, which is a very important and a valuable skill to have."[20] He has been described by Bradford City Head of Recruitment Greg Abbott as being "lightning quick" and that he "runs in behind [the defence] and is good with both feet".[21]
