_BIG BROTHER CANADA 5_ is the fifth season of the Canadian reality television series _Big Brother Canada_. It is based upon the Dutch series of the same name, which gained notoriety in 1999 and 2000. It was produced by Endemol USA, and Insight Productions. The season premiered on Global on March 15, 2017 and ended after 69 days – the shortest season to date by one day – on May 18, 2017, where returning houseguest Kevin Martin was crowned the winner, and Karen Singbeil the runner-up.

The series revolves around different strangers living in a house together with no communication with the outside world. They are constantly filmed during their time in the house with live feeds on the Internet and have no communication with the outside world. One HouseGuest, known as the Head of Household, has the task of nominating two of their fellow HouseGuests for eviction. The Power of Veto can be used to save a nominee. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of the nominees, with the HouseGuest who receives the most votes being evicted from the house. When only two HouseGuests remain, nine of previously evicted houseguests decide which of them will win the grand prize of $100,000, a 2017 Toyota 86, as well as a $30,000 home makeover from The Brick.[1] The runner-up receives a $20,000 cash prize.


Development

Having aired fourteen seasons of the United States' edition in the country, it was confirmed that Canada would receive its own edition of the program in 2013.[2] The new series was produced by Endemol USA and Insight Productions. The first season aired on Slice and proved to be a ratings hit for the network, averaging a total of 2.7 million viewers throughout its course.[3][4][5] The show's first two seasons were nominated for five Canadian Screen Awards in 2014 and 2015. The fifth season was officially confirmed by Global on June 7, 2016 through their Twitter account. Host Arisa Cox later confirmed that the _Big Brother Side Show_ had been replaced with a weekly Facebook Live chat with the evicted houseguest.

Summary

On Day 1, eight new HouseGuests entered the futuristic Big Brother Canada House, called the Big Brother Odyssey. Soon after, they were told about the first twist. Eight HouseGuests of previous seasons would re-enter the House and play the game alongside them. Bruno, Cassandra, Dallas, Gary, Ika, Kevin, Neda, and Sindy then entered the House. Before the Head of Household competition, each veteran was paired up with a new HouseGuest. The HouseGuests then blasted off in the _Dropped in Space_ Head of Household competition. In this competition, one HouseGuest will be harnessed to the Odyssey and must hold their partner. As the competition goes on, the harnesses will loosen, dragging the HouseGuests at a steeper angle. The last pair standing will win the competition, earn safety for the week, and will gain the right to name any HouseGuest as Head of Household. Karen and Sindy won the competition, and Karen became the first Head of Household. On Day 2, Karen nominated Demetres and Mark for eviction. On Day 3, Karen, Demetres, and Mark, as well as Bruno, Kevin, and Ika went back in time for the _Me Want Veto_ Power of Veto competition. In this competition, HouseGuests had to traverse obstacles with a boulder tied to their ankle to their rock pile. They then had to search for prehistoric emojis that match the paintings on their cave wall. After eight trips, HouseGuests had the opportunity to collect two boulder emojis to remove the boulder from their ankle. Once a HouseGuest has all of their emojis at the cave, they must flip them over to reveal letters and use them to solve a mystery phrase. The first HouseGuest to solve the mystery phrase will win the Power of Veto. Bruno was the winner. On Day 4, Bruno decided not to use the Power of Veto. On Day 6, Mark was evicted by a 7–6 vote, with Bruno, Dallas, Dillon, Emily, Jackie, and Kevin voting to evict Demetres. Arisa then informed the HouseGuests of the first Shock Wave. Canada voted to transport one HouseGuest into the future, thus keeping them safe until the jury begins. Neda was selected to be safe until jury.

Following Mark's eviction, the HouseGuests kicked it in the _Balls to the Wall_ Head of Household competition. HouseGuests competed in head-to-head matches and kicked their ball at the wall. The HouseGuest with the higher score moved on while the other was eliminated. If the ball is touching two spaces at once, HouseGuests will receive the higher number. The last HouseGuest standing will be the new Head of Household. Demetres was the winner. The losers of the head-to-head matches drew cards to determine the Have-Nots for the week. Cassandra, Emily, Ika, and Sindy became Have-Nots for the week. On Day 7, Demetres nominated Dillon and Emily for eviction. Prior to the Power of Veto competition, the competitors were tasked with creating a unique way to dunk an Oreo cookie to be judged by the other HouseGuests. The winner would receive an advantage for the Power of Veto competition. Dre received the advantage. On Day 8, Demetres, Dillon, and Emily, alongside Dre, Neda, and Karen, with Dallas as the host, dunked in the _Milkin' It_ Power of Veto competition, sponsored by Oreo. In this competition, HouseGuests must jump into the tub of milk and soak up as much milk as they can. They must then run to their platform and squeeze the milk into their container. The first HouseGuest to fill their container and retrieve the ball inside will win the Power of Veto, as well as $5000 from Oreo. Dre's advantage gave her some extra milk in her container. Dillon was the winner. On Day 10, Dillon took himself off the block, and Demetres named Dallas as the replacement nominee. On Day 11, the HouseGuests were paired up for a task sponsored by Crest. One person would eat a series of foods, while their partner smelt their breath, trying to identify the food they ate. The pair that identified the most foods received a special dinner date. Dre and Cassandra won and received the dinner date. On Day 13, Dallas was evicted by a 12–0 vote.

Following Dallas' eviction, the HouseGuests were quizzed in the _And Scene_ Head of Household competition. HouseGuests were asked questions based on a soap opera the HouseGuests participated in. An incorrect answer resulted in elimination. The last HouseGuest standing will be the new Head of Household. Neda was the winner. On Day 14, the HouseGuests were schooled in the _Food Fight_ Have-Not competition. Before the competition, Neda selected Dillon, Gary, Karen, Ika, and Dre to be the "cool kids" for the competition. They were immune from being Have-Nots. In this competition, the HouseGuests had to walk across a balance beam and collect food items. The "cool kids" threw dodge balls, attempting to knock them off the balance beam. The four HouseGuests who collected the least amount of food items were the Have-Nots for the week. Bruno, Cassandra, Demetres, and William were Have-Nots for the week. On Day 14, Neda nominated Cassandra and Jackie for eviction, with Cassandra as the target.

If they cannot spell a word, they will be eliminated. In the final round, HouseGuests must use their remaining tiles to spell the longest word they can. The HouseGuest who spells the longest final word will win the Power of Veto. Neda was the winner. On Day 24, Neda decided not to use the Power of Veto. On Day 25, HouseGuests campaigned in the _Slop Vote_ Have-Not competition. In this competition, each HouseGuest privately placed ten cookies into the bucket of the HouseGuests they wanted to be Have-Nots for the week.

Finally, the HouseGuests (excluding Neda, as outgoing HoH and Dre and Gary, as the nominees) competed in the HoH competition, with that HoH having the power to evict either nominee at the Eviction.http://bigbrothercanada.globaltv.com/blog/2017-03-29-backwards-week-explained

-   : This week was a double eviction week. Following Emily's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of game – including HoH and PoV competitions, and Nomination, Veto, and Eviction ceremonies – during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week. As the night's second evictee would become the first member of the Jury, Neda no longer had her Time Warp immunity.

-   : In Week 6's Head of Household competition, William found a card that awarded him Immunity for the week.[7]

-   : During Week 6, Big Brother gave the HouseGuests a task to clean the House. Unbeknownst to the HouseGuest, Big Brother had hidden a series of clues for a special power throughout the house. Wiliam found the clues and subsequently found a "Secret Power of Veto". With this PoV, he could remove a nominee at the Veto Ceremony anonymously. This Secret PoV was only valid for the Week 6 and Week 7 PoV Ceremonies. As other HouseGuests do not know of the holder of this power, William could be named as the replacement nominee, unless he was otherwise immune.[8]

-   : This week was a triple eviction week. Following Jackie's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of game – including HoH and Veto competitions, and Nomination, Veto, and Eviction ceremonies – during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second and third eviction for the week. As Head of Household, Demetres was forced to nominate three HouseGuests for eviction and was not allowed to compete for the Power of Veto. In a twist, the voting HouseGuests cast their vote to save a nominee.

-   : During the finale, the Jury voted for which finalist should win Big Brother Canada 5.
