The genus _Ficus_ is composed of 800 species of vines, shrubs, and trees, defined by their syconiums, the fruit-like vessels that either hold female flowers or pollen on the inside. In addition to being cultivated by humans for thousands of years, _Ficus_ is also known for their reproductive mutualism with the fig wasp.[1]

Fig trees either produce hermaphrodite fruit known as caprifigs, or female figs; only the female figs are palatable to humans. In exchange for a safe place for their eggs and larvae, fig wasps help pollinate the ficus by crawling inside the tiny hole in the apex of the fig, called the ostiole, without knowing whether they crawled into a caprifig or a fig. If the female wasp crawls into the caprifig, she can successfully lay her eggs and die. The males hatch first, mate with the females, dig tunnels out of the caprifig, and die. The females, now covered in fig pollen from the caprifig, fly out to begin the cycle again. If the female wasp crawls into a female fig, she will not be able to successfully lay her eggs despite pollinating the fig with pollen from the caprifig she hatched in. The fig will absorb her body and her eggs as the fruit develops.[2]


History

Aristotle noted in _Historia animalium_ that wild figs contain _psenes_ that begin as grubs, but whose skin splits allowing the _psen_ to fly out. The _psen_ flies into a cultivated fig, and stops it from falling. He noted further that Greek farmers planted wild figs next to cultivated figs, and tied wild fig fruits on to the cultivated trees.[3]


Mechanisms and outcomes

Overall, the coevolution of _Ficus_ and wasps can be explained through the specificity of _Ficus_ as a host and the tendency of the wasp species to frequent hosts different to that of their original _Ficus_ plant, thus increasing the likelihood of hybrids and eventually new species.

_Ficus_ domination in mutualism

_Ficus_ typically control the reproductive mutualism with fig wasps[4] by being highly selective in their choice of pollinator. Contributing to the evolution of _Ficus_, pollinator specificity in _Ficus_ is a pre-zygotic mechanism of reproductive isolation among plant species in diverse angiosperm lineages with varying degrees of sympatry and of gene flow in hybrid zones. This is proven by the high host specificity and low pollinator sharing ratios found in fig pollinators, especially in the genera _Ceratosolen_ and _Kradibia_. Morphological examples of such specificity includes the diameters of ostioles compared to the head widths of the respective wasp species. While the fig species _F. wassa_ have a diameter of 1.0-1.5 mm, its pollinator _K. wassae_ had an average head width of 0.58 mm.[5]

Pollinator-sharing

Pollinator-sharing affects plant species integrity, the delimitation of _Ficus_ species, and the importance of host-switching in shaping the evolutionary history of the mutualism. As indicated by host-pollinator co-phylogenies from neotropical monoecious figs, pollinator-sharing could lead to new host species and host-switching. This could essentially lead to interspecific hybrids in both wasps and figs.[6] A rare possibility is the evolution of cheating in conjunction with a pollinator host shift. In other words, host-sharing species will not even be sister species and may compete for resources. The origin of cheating within a mutualistic lineage has also been shown in yucca moths.[7]

Cospeciation

Despite some significant differences in the fig and pollinator phylogenies, analyses indicate that cospeciation has occurred in the history of the _Ficus_-wasp mutualism. Contrary to popular belief, the phylogenic conflicts found among figs and wasps are not due to chance differences in the nucleotide substitution patterns in pollinator mtDNA and fig nrDNA. Furthermore, the potential for lineage sorting, a form of genetic drift, in pollinator mtDNA should be low due to inbreeding and small effective population size. Thus, hybridization does not appear to have played a major role in the evolution of fig and pollinator lineages, based on a maximum likelihood test.[8]
