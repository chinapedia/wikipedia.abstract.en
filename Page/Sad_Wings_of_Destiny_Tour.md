The _SAD WINGS OF DESTINY TOUR_ was a 1976 concert tour by British heavy metal band Judas Priest which was in support of the album _Sad Wings of Destiny_. It ran from 25 March 1976 until 27 May 1976 through England.

Previous drummer John Hinch departed the band due to being "musically inadequate", as explained by guitarist Glenn Tipton.[1] Drummer Alan Moore, who was with the band for a short time in the early 1970s, was his replacement for the album and tour.

"Never Satisfied" would be played again on the Epitaph World Tour.
