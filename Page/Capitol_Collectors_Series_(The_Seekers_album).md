_CAPITOL COLLECTORS SERIES_ is a 1992 compilation of 23 tracks recorded by Australian band The Seekers. This release was the first time that many of these songs were available on compact disc. The CD contained studio recording, live tracks and radio jingles. The compilation was part of the Capitol Collectors Series.


Reception

Greg Adams from AllMusic wrote, "The Seekers' folk-pop sound formed a bridge between The Kingston Trio and The Association, putting the Australian quartet in the same international quasi-folk neighborhood as The Sandpipers and Peter and Gordon. "Georgy Girl" and "I'll Never Find Another You" were the group's two big hits, but their repertoire included everything from traditional folk songs and spirituals to pure pop. With strummy acoustic guitars and intricate vocal arrangements, the Seekers paved the way for the folk-oriented pop vocal groups that followed. _Capitol Collectors Series_ is a 23-track anthology that presents their hits and more, with several excellent tracks among the obscurities."
