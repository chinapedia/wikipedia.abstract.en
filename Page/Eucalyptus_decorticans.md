Description

_Eucalyptus deccorticans_ is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has hard, dark grey to black ironbark on the trunk and larger branches, smooth white to greyish or yellow bark on the thinner branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves that are narrow lance-shaped, a lighter colour on the lower surface, long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, the same dull colour on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. The buds are club-shaped to spindle-shaped or diamond-shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum. Flowering has been observed in April, August and September and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody conical, cup-shaped or barrel-shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel long.[2][3]


Taxonomy and naming

Gum-top ironbark was first formally described in 1911 by Frederick Manson Bailey from a specimen collected near Eidsvold by Thomas Lane Bancroft. Bailey gave it the name _Eucalyptus siderophloia_ f. _decorticans_ and published the description in the _Queensland Agricultural Journal_.[4][5] In 1921, Joseph Maiden raised the form to species level as _Eucalyptus decorticans_, publishing the change in his book _A Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus_.[6][7] The specific epithet (_decorticans_) is derived from the Latin word _decorticans_ meaning "without bark" referring to the peeling bark on the smaller branches.[8]


Distribution and habitat

_Eucalyptus decorticans_ grows in open forest on hills and hillsides in stony clay soils. It is widespred in south-eastern Queensland.[9][10]


Conservation status

This eucalypt is classified as "least concern" under the Queensland Government _Nature Conservation Act 1992_.[11]
