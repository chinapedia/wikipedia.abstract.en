This article is about the demographic features of the population of Hong Kong, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with an overall density of some 6,300 people per square kilometre.[1] At the same time, Hong Kong has one of the world's lowest birth rates—1.11 per woman of child-bearing age as of 2012, far below the replacement rate of 2.1. It is estimated that 26.8% of the population will be aged 65 or more in 2033, up from 12.1% in 2005. Hong Kong recorded 8.2 births per 1,000 people in 2005–2010.[2]

Ethnically, Hong Kong mainly consists of Han Chinese who constitute approximately 92% of the population.[3] Of these, many originate from various regions in Canton. There are also a number of descendants of immigrants from elsewhere in Southern China and around the world after the end of World War II.


Terminology

People from Hong Kong generally refer to themselves, in Cantonese, as _Hèung Góng Yàhn_ (); however, the term is not restricted to those of Chinese descent, owing to Hong Kong's roughly 160-year colonial history that saw the civil servants and traders of British, Indian, Russian and other ethnic groups stationed in Hong Kong.

In English, the term 'Hong Kongers' (or sometimes 'Hongkongers') is also used to refer to Hong Kongese people, while the term 'Hongkongese' is sometimes used as an adjective to describe people or things related to Hong Kong.[4][5]


Population density

Hong_Kong_Population_Graph.svg The following census data is available for Hong Kong between the years 1841–2011. In 2011, Hong Kong had a population of just over 7 million, with a density of approximately 6,300 people per square kilometre. This makes Hong Kong the fourth most densely populated region in the world, after Macau, Monaco, and Singapore.[6]


Ethnicity

Chinese groups

According to the 2016 by-census, 92% of the Hong Kong population is ethnic Chinese.[7] 8% are other non-Chinese ethnic groups, including a large number of Filipinos and Indonesians, making up approximately 4% of the population.[8][9][10] The Hong Kong census does not categorise Han Chinese subgroups. However, the majority of Hong Kongers of Chinese descent trace their ancestry to various parts of Southern China: the Guangzhou area, followed by Siyi (a region of four counties neighbouring Guangzhou), Chaoshan (a region of North Guangdong home to Teochew speakers), Fujian and Shanghai.[11] Some Cantonese people also originate from Hakka-speaking villages in the New Territories.[12] Most Teochew-speaking migrants immigrated to Hong Kong from the late 1940s to the early 1970s, while migrants from Fujian (previously Southern Min speakers, and increasingly more Central Min and Northern Min speakers) have constituted a large-growing number of migrants since 1978.[13] Many Taishanese and Cantonese also migrated after 1949.

Currently, the major Chinese groups include the Punti, Hakka, Cantonese (including Toishanese), Hoklo,[14] and Tanka ().[15] Punti and Tanka are Hong Kong indigenous people, while Cantonese people (including Taishanese) are not Hong Kong indigenous people. For Hakka and Hoklo, they have both indigenous and non-indigenous people in Hong Kong.Stanley_Market_6,_Mar_06.JPG]]

Health and mortality

The following table shows birth rates and mortality rates in Hong Kong between 1950 and 2015.[24][25][26]

At the end of the 20th century, Hong Kong had one of the lowest birth rates in the world. However, the number of births doubled in the decade between 2001 and 2011, largely due to an increase in the number of children born in Hong Kong to women with residence in Mainland China. In 2001 there were 7,810 births to Mainland women (16%) out of a total of 48,219 births. This increased to 37,253 births to Mainland women (45%) out of a total of 82,095 births.[27]

Religion

Hong_Kong_Budha.jpg on Lantau Island.]] DaJiuFestival.jpg'' celebration, the Cheung Chau Bun Festival.]] Over half of all people (56.1% as of 2010) are not religious[29]. Religious people in Hong Kong follow a diverse range of religions, among which Taoist and Buddhist (specifically Chinese Buddhism) faiths are common for people of Chinese descent.

Confucian beliefs are popular in Hong Kong, but it is arguable whether Confucianism can be considered as a religion [30]. As such, Confucianism is excluded in some studies [31].

Christian beliefs (Protestantism and Catholicism together) are also common, as well as non-organised Chinese folk religions, whose followers may state that they are not religious.

Traditional religions including Chinese Buddhism were discouraged under British rule, which officially represented Christianity.[32] The handover of sovereignty from Britain to China has led to a resurgence of Buddhist and Chinese religions.[33]
