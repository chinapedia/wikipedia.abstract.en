_LEFT_ is the title of a studio album by the music group Monkey House, released on June 3, 2016, on the Alma Records label, which is affiliated with the Universal Music Group. It was mainly recorded at the Drive Shed in Toronto. It was co-produced by Don Breithaupt and Peter Cardinali, and the engineer was John 'Beetle' Bailey. After the increased popularity of their previous album from 2012, entitled _Headquarters_, the leader of the band Don Breithaupt stated that "Part of the buzz for me on this album is that I sense a lot of people [were] waiting for it. I keep getting inquiries from people from all over the world giving me grief for taking so long, but that’s a fun situation to be in."[1] Once again, this release has raised comparisons to the music group Steely Dan. "There's only one comparison really, and that's Steely Dan, and in particular, the Aja-Gaucho period", states jazzcorner.com.[2] The album title _Left_ is derived from the fact that Breithaupt made a big move from Toronto, to the "left coast", or west coast of the United States, setting up a new home in the Los Angeles, California area prior to the production and recording of the album. He states that some of the tunes originated on his long drive across the wide open spaces in North America.[3] The album features contributions from Steely Dan veterans Michael Leonhart, Elliott Randall, Jay Graydon and Drew Zingg, and includes background vocals from Lucy Woodward (Snarky Puppy), as well as David Blamires (Pat Metheny Group).[4]

The album has had favorable reviews. The music blog Calling Captain Autumn by Andrew Goodwin states "This is glorious, spine-tingling stuff, as close as I’m going to get to hearing a new Steely Dan album, and it fills me with a profound sense of joy.".[5] From Inside MusiCast: "Since 1992, Don Breithaupt has steered his band Monkey House on a path of musical progress..._Left_ contains brilliantly crafted songs that may be the band’s finest collection to date."[6] "In The Hills" magazine calls the album "spectacular in every possible way..._Left_ is Monkey House's best ever". [7] The album debuted at number 9 on the iTunes U.S. Jazz chart, number 2 on the iTunes Canada jazz chart,[8] and peaked at Number 24 on the Billboard Jazz Albums Chart.[9]
