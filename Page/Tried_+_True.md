_TRIED + TRUE_ is the third and final studio album by Tinfed, released on August 22, 2000 by Hollywood Records. It was produced by Ed Buller, known for his work with English groups such as Suede, Spiritualized and Slowdive. The song "Dangergirl" features a guest appearance by Chino Moreno, lead vocalist of Deftones. The album also contains "Immune", which was featured in the 2000 film _Mission: Impossible 2_ and appeared on its soundtrack.


Reception

Stanton Swihart of allmusic gave the album a mixed review and criticized the band for sounding too derivative of Britpop groups such as Radiohead and Travis, saying "they ultimately fail to attain the same levels of esoteric complexity as those bands." Swihart concluded his review saying the band's best material may be ahead of them: "While Tinfed is not unequivocally successful or innovative on a sonic level, it is frequently exciting and a terribly promising effort from a band that may eventually cast its own considerable shadow."[1] _CMJ_ reviewed it more positively, calling _Tried + True_ a "forward-thinking rock record with plenty of potential commercial appeal" that "contains pretty guitar pop enhanced only minimally by studio machinery."[2]
