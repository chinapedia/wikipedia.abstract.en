"STOOL PIGEON" is a 1982 song by Kid Creole & The Coconuts. It was the second single to be released from the group's third studio album _Tropical Gangsters_. It reached a peak of #8 on the UK Singles Chart and #25 on the US US Club Play Chart. August Darnell, the lead singer of Kid Creole & The Coconuts, was a great fan of the 1940s dress style, which for gangsters was double breasted pinstriped suits and hats. "Stool Pigeon", which Darnell wrote, was a tribute to this whole genre.

The 12" remix of "Stool Pigeon" features a guitar solo by Chic guitarist Nile Rodgers.
