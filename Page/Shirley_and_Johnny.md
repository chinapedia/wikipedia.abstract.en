SHIRLEY BAGNALL and JOHNNY WHEELER were a British pop duo of the 1960s and 70's from High Wycombe. They were signed by Parlophone and their debut single, "I don’t want to know" (1964) reached number 47 in the Melody Maker chart.[1][2] They appeared on Rediffusion's Ollie & Fred's Five O’Clock Club in June 1965.[3] plus many other TV and Radio show. During 1970, whilst working on a cruise ship RHMS Amerikanis, S&J formed a trio with Australian musician Mel James. Upon their return to the UK in 1971 they began to record as 'Wheeler St. James & James (later shortened to Wheeler St. James). Shirley and Johnny made their final record in 1977.
