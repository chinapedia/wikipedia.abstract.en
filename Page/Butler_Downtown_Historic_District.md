The BUTLER DOWNTOWN HISTORIC DISTRICT is a historic district in Butler, Georgia that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.[1]

It includes 46 contributing buildings, and also contributing are one site and two other structures (one a Conferate monument).[2]

The Taylor County Courthouse (see accompanying photos #1, #2, #6, #9, and #14) is central in the district. It was designed by Frederick Roy Duncan, was built in 1935, and was separately NRHP-listed in 1995.[3]

The district has three historic gas stations (see photos #10, #11, and #12), which is unusual for a small town or any historic district.[4]

The town's Masonic Lodge (1920; see photo #16) is a brick building with a parapet wall. It has "limestone Art Deco motifs at the corners and along the beltcourse."[5]

On Ivey Street are two landmarks:

-   the Art Moderne-style building at Ivey & Main Streets (c.1940s), originally a car dealership (see photo #6), and
-   the Rabbit Box, historic hamburger joint, where John and Ruth Turk made "Turk Burgers" famous (see photo #3).[6]
