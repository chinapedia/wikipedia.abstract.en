_MONOPOLY_ is a PlayStation video game based on the board game _Monopoly_, released on November 6, 1997. Developed by Gremlin Interactive and published by Hasbro Interactive, this title was one of many inspired by the property.


Gameplay

The game contains very similar gameplay to the board game it is based on, with various physical tasks being replaced by automation and digital representations.


Critical reception

Absolute PlayStation said the game's graphics were "tastefully executed", the board itself was "accurately represented", and that some of the pictural representations of properties were "humorous".[1] Game Revolution described it as a "winner" and "solid", despite not being particularly revolutionary.[2] Mark Skorup of _Gamezilla_ said the title would appeal to lovers of the Monopoly concept, but didn't enjoy the fiddliness of the Monopoly board game.[3] GameSpot reviewer Josh Smith wrote that the title was a novelty game with little replay value.[4] Mark Kanarick of Allgame described this adaption of the board game as "simplistic", and said it can induce boredom due to long load times.[5] IGN thought the game was the third in a line of games (Frogger, Beast Wars Transformers, and Monopoly) that had branded Hasbro Interactive as a "name to avoid", deeming the interface "unnecessarily complex" and the AI "terrible".[6]
