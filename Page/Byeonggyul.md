_CITRUS PLATYMAMMA_, called _BYEONGGYUL_ (, ) in Korean and _BENJUL_ (; ) in Jeju, is a Korean citrus fruit native to Jeju Island.[1][2]


History

Two old byeonggyul trees in Doryeon-dong were designated as treasures of Jeju on 7 January 1998;[3][4] However, one died on 5 October 2005. The remaining tree was designated as a Natural Monument of South Korea on 13 January 2011.[5] It is presumed to be around 250 years old, and can be found at 21, Doryeon 6-gil, Jeju, Jeju Province ().[6]

In 2010, several 80-year-old byeonngyul trees were transplanted to Geummul orchard, an orchard once set out for growing citruses consumed at the court of the Joseon Dynasty. It disappeared with the end of the dynasty and was restored in 2010 by Seogwipo Agricultural Technology Center.[7]


Etymology

Jeju _benjul_ () and Korean _byeonggyul_ () are cognates. They share the same hanja characters: _byeong_ (, "bottle") and _gyul_ (, "citrus fruit").

_Tamnaji_, a chronicle of Jeju Island published in 1653 by a Joseon dynasty governor, Yi Wonjin, mentions byeonggyul using the name _byeolgyul_ (, "peculiar citrus"). According to the author, the fruit is usually called _byeonggyul_, a compound of _byeong_ (, "bottle") and _gyul_ (, "citrus"), because its shape tapers towards the top and resembles an upside down _jongji_ (, "tiny bowl").[8]


Description

Genomic evidence has suggested that byeonggyul, sweet oranges, and key limes shared a common ancestor.[9] Byeonggyul is known to be more resistant to cold, blight and insect attack than other related citrus fruits.

The thornless tree grows to tall and around wide. The dense, thin and low branches give the tree a shrubby appearance. Its leaves are ovate with pointy tips, around long and around wide. The flowers are formed of five white ovate petals.

Like that of the related citruses, the byeonggyul fruit has a fragrant dimpled rind. The yellow to yellow-orange fruit with an elongated basal portion and a bulbous end grows to long and broad. It weighs around .


Uses

The flesh can be eaten raw, and the peel can be used fresh or dried, whole or zested. Fresh zest of a byeonggyul is used for _tteok_ (rice cakes) and other Korean food as a spice or for garnish, while dried peel is usually used for making tea. Byeonggyul tea was used as home remedies to treat respiratory ailments, loss of appetite or light digestive problems.
