"BIG APPLE" is a nickname for New York City. It was first popularized in the 1920s by John J. Fitz Gerald, a sports writer for the _New York Morning Telegraph_. Its popularity since the 1970s is due in part to a promotional campaign by the New York tourist authorities.


Origin of the name

Although the history of ''Big Apple '' was once thought a mystery,[1] a clearer picture of the term's history has emerged due to the work of amateur etymologist Barry Popik,[2] and Gerald Cohen of Missouri University of Science and Technology.[3] A number of false theories had previously existed,[4] including a claim that the term derived from a woman named Eve who ran a brothel in the city.[5] This was subsequently exposed as a hoax.[6][7]

The earliest known usage of 'big apple' appears in the book _The Wayfarer in New York_ (1909), in which author Edward S. Martin writes:

  Kansas is apt to see in New York a greedy city... It inclines to think that the big apple gets a disproportionate share of the national sap.[8][9]

William Safire considered this the coinage, but the _Random House Dictionary of American Slang_ has described the usage as "metaphorical or perhaps proverbial, rather than a concrete example of the later slang term".


Racing context

_The Big Apple_ was popularized as a name for New York City by John J. Fitz Gerald in a number of horse-racing articles for the _New York Morning Telegraph_ in the 1920s. The earliest of these was a casual reference on 3rd May, 1921:

Fitz Gerald referred to the "big apple" frequently thereafter.[10] He explained his use in a column dated February 18, 1924, under the headline "Around the Big Apple":

Fitz Gerald reportedly first heard "The Big Apple" used to describe New York's racetracks by two African American stable hands at the famed New Orleans Fair Grounds.[11] Evidence can also be found in the _Chicago Defender_, an African-American newspaper that had a national circulation. Writing for the _Defender_ on September 16, 1922, “Ragtime” Billy Tucker used the name "big apple" to refer to New York in a non-horse-racing context:

Tucker had also earlier used "big apple" as a reference to Los Angeles. It is possible that he simply understood "big apple" as a nickname for any large city:


Popularity

Home Run Apple located in Citi Field.]] By the late 1920s, New York writers other than Fitz Gerald were starting to use "Big Apple" and were using it in contexts other than horse-racing.[12] "The Big Apple" was a popular song[13] and dance[14][15] in the 1930s. Walter Winchell and other writers continued to use the term in the 1940s and 1950s,[16] but by the 1960s it had generally come to be known as an old name for New York.[17]

In the early 1970s, however, the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau (now NYC & Company, New York City's official marketing and tourism organization) began to promote the city's "Big Apple" nickname[18] under the leadership of its president, Charles Gillett.[19] It has remained popular since then.[20]

Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1997 signed legislation designating as "Big Apple Corner" the southwest corner of West 54th Street and Broadway, the corner on which John J. Fitz Gerald lived from 1934 to 1963.[21] As part of the celebrations following as his election as President of the United States in 2016, Donald Trump hosted a party which he named 'The Big Apple Ball' and which featured themed decorations and cut-outs of New York landmarks in honor of his home city.[22]

Today the name enjoys exclusive ubiquity in literature and speech referring to New York City, and is used with regularity by journalists and news-headline writers across the English-speaking world.[23][24][25][26]


In popular culture

The term "big apple" was used by Frank Sinatra in conversation with opera singer Dorothy Kirsten on an episode of the NBC radio program _Light Up Time_ on March 28, 1950.[27]

In _Evita_, Buenos Aires is referred to as "B.A., Buenos Aires, Big Apple" in the song _Eva, Beware of the City._ This line, produced by lyricist Tim Rice, does not appear to reflect any pre-existing usage.

The New York Mets baseball team[28] have featured a "Home Run Apple" that rises whenever a Mets player hits a home run. It has become a symbol of the Mets baseball team, recognized throughout Major League Baseball[29] as an iconic feature of the Mets' stadiums. It first appeared in Shea Stadium, and the original can still be seen on display at Citi Field, outside the Jackie Robinson Rotunda. Citi Field now uses a new apple, one that is much larger than original.[30]

Uses of the term abound elsewhere in the names of cultural products and events in or concerning New York, including the Big Apple Anime Fest, the Big Apple Theater Festival, Jess Teong's The Kid from the Big Apple and Kajagoogoo's Big Apple, and playful uses of the nickname have been seen, such as Patrick Downey's 2008 historical study of New York City's criminal underworld, entitled _Bad Seeds in the Big Apple._
