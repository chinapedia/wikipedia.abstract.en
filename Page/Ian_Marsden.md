Before suffering a spinal injury, Marsden competed as a non-disabled athlete in the British Open Powerlifting Championships, and won the title in 1989 when he was 17.[6] He is also the holder of 3 world records.[7]

Handcycling

After the spinal injury, he became the “first British male to win a podium position”[8] on the European Handcycling Circuit (EHC).[9]

Shooting

In the 10m air rifle category, Marsden won a silver and bronze medal at world level.[10] He was due to compete in London 2012, but health complications prevented this.[11]

Paracanoe

Marsden has mentioned that he was asked numerous times if he wanted to try Paracanoe (during his handcycling career and shooting).[12] He took up the offer of regular training at Nottingham and joined the Paracanoe GB Sprint Team,[13][14] representing Team Great Britain since 2013. He recently achieved Bronze in the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games.[15]


Injury

Marsden suffered a spinal injury powerlifting, which caused his hospitalisation and eventually introducing him to the world of handcycling. However, after competing on the European circuit for a number of years, Marsden was once again hospitalised, and it was discovered that he had a rare motor neuron condition.[16]
