ARTICOLO 31 was a band from Milan, Italy, formed in 1990 by J-Ax and DJ Jad, combining hip hop, funk, pop and traditional Italian musical forms. They are one of the most popular Italian hip hop groups.


Band history

Articolo 31 were formed by rapper J-Ax (real name Alessandro Aleotti) and DJ Jad (Vito Luca Perrini).[1] In the spoken intro of the album _Strade di Città_ ("City Streets"), it is stated that the band is named after the article of the Irish constitution guaranteeing freedom of the press, although article 31 of the Irish constitution is not about the freedom of the press. They probably meant the Section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act.

Articolo 31 released one of the first Italian hip hop records, _Strade di città_, in 1993.[2] Soon, they signed with BMG Ricordi and started to mix rap with pop music - a move that earned them great commercial success but that alienated the underground hip hop scene, who perceived them as traitors. In 1997, DJ Gruff dissed Articolo 31 in a track titled _1 vs 2_ on the first album of the beatmaker Fritz da Cat, starting a feud that would go on for years.

In 2001, Articolo 31 collaborated with the American old school rapper Kurtis Blow on the album _XChé SI!_. In the same year, they made the film _Senza filtro_ (in English, _"Without filter"_).[3] Their producer was Franco Godi, who also produced the music for the _Signor Rossi_ animated series.[4]

Their 2002 album _Domani smetto_ represented a further departure from hip hop, increasingly relying on the formula of rapping over pop music samples.[5] Several of their songs rotate around the theme of soft drugs legalization in Italy (pointing strongly in favour).[6]

Following their 2003 album "Italiano medio", the band took a break. Both J Ax and DJ Jad have been involved with solo projects. In 2006, the group declared an indefinite hiatus.[7]

Their posse, _Spaghetti Funk_, includes other popular performers like Space One and pop rappers Gemelli DiVersi.
