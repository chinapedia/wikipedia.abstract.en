Among others for the members of the original Sisters Keepers were Nadja Benaissa, Ay·ªç, Kaye, Nicole Hadfield (), and Tamika, along with Tesiree, Lisa, Mamadee, Pat and Meli (Skills en Masse, Ischen Impossible) with Onejiru (Pielina Schindler). "Liebe Und Verstand" was their largest hit on chart in Germany, Swiss and Austria between December 2001 to February 2002, as many African artists joined together to form a musical statement. With two songs, both released on the album _Lightkultur_ by Brothers Keepers (WEA), they took a stand against racism and violence.


"Sisters eV" against racism and violence

Actually, the members held positions among loose circle of network of female singers, or sisters.

Starting in 2004, the "Sisters eV" functioned with emphasis on activities for gender equality as well as protest against violence and racism, and environmental issues that Onejiru and Mamadee took the initiative. Among the list of female singers they worked with, Ngosi Madubuko and Angela Ordu are from Siberian music, who were two of the supporters close to the group.[2]

In 2005, Sisters Keepers was renamed to "Sisters", and acted independent from Brothers Keepers there on. The Sisters[3] started with Onejiru, Mamadee, Meli, Namusoke, Tamika and Nicole Hadfield (Groove Guerilla) and Lisa Cash coming in and out, and they represented North Rhine-Westphalia at the Bundesvision Song Contest 2008 to claim he fourteenth place with "Unite". In September 2008, they toured Germany, produced by (Turtle Bay Country Club.) The same year, the first album _Gender Riot_ was released.[4]


Role models for girls and women

It was extended in the summer of 2011, when they toured Brasil, Ghana, Togo, as well as cities in Germany for "Girls go for Goals". They celebrated the first inaugural United Nations International Day of the Girl with Plan International on October 11, 2012 when Onejiru, Melanie Wharton and Nicole Hadfield performed in New York City singing the song "Because I am a Girl". realizing UN World Girls Day is a campaign to have equal rights for girls and boys. During their visit to NYC, the Sisters performed at the BB King Blues Club in NY.[7]


Brothers Keepers and Sisters Keepers

It is evident that there is an absence of female musicians in most music videos by the Sisters' brother band, Brothers Keepers. Many saw this as an absence from Afro-German _volk_ envisioned by the Brothers and as drawing attention to the constitutive female outside of this mode of racial unity. The Brothers success and overbearing presence in music videos authorizes this female version of Afro-Germaness, forcefully visually transforming to hegemonic codes of femininity. Within it, there is a strong desire to envisage collectivity beyond peoplehood and the simultaneous failure to do so in Afro-German pop music and diaspora discourse underlines the nagging pervasiveness of this category and pressing need for alternatives.
