He studied humanities at the National Institute after some elementary courses at San Luis College. He entered law school, but his literary interests led him to drop out.

He married Mercedes Mulet on 4 February 1867 at the . They had one son.


Journalistic and literary career

Grez began his work in journalism in 1868 as editor of _El Charivari_, a satirical political publication. He also collaborated, under various pseudonyms, on publications such as _La Linterna del Diablo_, with caustic verses lampooning public figures.

These early activities as a journalist shaped the rest of his life, leading to jobs as editor and publisher of the newspapers _El Heraldo_, _La Época_, _La República_, _La Campana_, _La Patria_ (of which he was director from 1893 to 1894), _La Opinión_, and _El Mercurio_, and the magazines _La Revista de Santiago_, _Sud-América_, _Las Veladas Literarias_, _Las Novedades_, _El Nuevo Ferrocarril_, _Los Debates_, _Los Lunes_, _El Salín_ and _Revista de Artes y Letras_.

In his first books he displayed an interest in publicizing the history of Chile. His novel _Las mujeres de la Independencia_ (1878) formed a portrait of several important Chilean women of the early 19th century. _La vida santiaguina_ (1879) characterized some aspects of 17th century Chilean society. _El combate homérico_ (1880) narrated the events of the naval Battle of Iquique. In 1882 he released _Ráfagas_, a collection of short poems which had previously been published in _El Heraldo_. His later novels _Emilia Reynals_ (1883), _La dote de una joven_ (1884), ''Marianita ''(1881), and _El ideal de una esposa_ (1887) were very well received by the reading public and were compared with the works of Alberto Blest Gana. Pages of his unpublished novel _Jenio sin alas_ were published in _La Revista Nueva_ in 1900.

He was also an art critic, founding the _Revista de Bellas Artes_ (1889–1890) and serving as secretary of the organizing committee of Chile's presentation at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. At this time he wrote the book _Les beaux arts au Chili_.[2] Grez's work culminated with his particular vision of the era and of _nortino_ territory, _Viaje de destierro_ (1893).


Political and public career

Grez was a member of the National or Montt-Varist Party.

In 1875, he became head of the Foreign Section of Correos de Chile, and in 1888 took over as head of the National Statistics Institute, a position he held until his death in 1909.

He was alternate deputy for Arauco from 1882 to 1885, and for Taltal from 1885 to 1888. Later he took over as primary deputy for Taltal, from 1888 to 1891. He was second vice president of the Chamber of Deputies from 16 January 1890 to the dissolution of the National Congress in 1891. He was one of the signatories of the deposition of President José Manuel Balmaceda in 1891. He was exiled to Peru and returned to Chile in 1893.
