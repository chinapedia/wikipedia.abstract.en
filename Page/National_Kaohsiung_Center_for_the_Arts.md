NATIONAL KAOHSIUNG CENTER FOR THE ARTS, WEIWUYING () is a performance arts centre located in Fengshan District, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.[1]


History

The land area in which the center is being built was once a deserted area before being developed as a military camp. In the 1950s, it was the site of a recruitment base. In 2003, the Kaohsiung City Government decided to transform the area into a national performance center. In 2007, the design firm Mecanoo Architecten won the design and construction rights. The preparatory office was also set up by the Cultural Construction Committee of the Executive Yuan on 15 March 2006. The construction for the main building was completed in 2012.[2][3]


Architecture

National Kaohsiung Center for the Arts is designed Dutch architectural firm Mecanoo. The center is currently being built in a 9.9 hectares of land covering 3.3 hectares of floor area. The design of the center was inspired by the banyan trees around the area. The center will house four indoor venues, which are the Lyric Theater, Concert Hall, Playhouse and Recital Hall.[4][5]The pipe organ in the concert hall is manufactured by Johannes Klais Orgelbau. With 9,194 pipes, this will be the grandest organ in Asia.[6] It is now the largest art avenue in the world.
