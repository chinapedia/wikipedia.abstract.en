The ESTONIAN AVIATION MUSEUM is located in Lange near Tartu in Estonia. It is the only aviation museum in the country.

The museum was founded in December 1999 in accordance with a private initiative procedure and officially opened to the public on 14 June 2002.[1] It has been developed in different stages on the basis of European Union support financing and with the help of the private- and public sector.[2]

Founder and director of the museum is Estonian engineer and former politician Mati Meos.[3]

The museum consists of several buildings; one small building is used to present more than 400 aircraft models. A collection of military aircraft, airliners, training aircraft, ultralight aircraft, helicopters, gliders, aircraft engines, radar units and anti-aircraft guns is displayed in and around several hangars. There are also various attractions such as piloting- and parachute jumping simulators.[4]

The museum has its own 450m-long airstrip. Tartu Ülenurme Airport is located 4 km away.

The Museum has staged the annual Estonian Aviation Days since 2006. The museum claims it is the biggest aviation event in the Baltic states.[5] Estonian Aviation Days 2016 had the attendance of 13 000 people.[6]

The Museum is closed in wintertime from November to May.[7]
