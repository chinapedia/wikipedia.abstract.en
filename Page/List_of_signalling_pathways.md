In cell biology, there are several signalling pathways.[1] Cell signalling is part of the molecular biology system that controls and coordinates the actions of cells.

-   Akt/PKB signalling pathway
-   AMPK signalling pathway
-   cAMP-dependent pathway
-   Eph/ephrin signalling pathway
-   Hedgehog signalling pathway
-   Hippo signalling pathway
-   Insulin signal transduction pathway
-   JAK-STAT signalling pathway
-   MAPK/ERK signalling pathway
-   mTOR signalling pathway
-   Nodal signalling pathway
-   Notch signalling pathway
-   PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway
-   TGF beta signalling pathway
-   TLR signalling pathway
-   VEGF signalling pathway
-   Wnt signalling pathway
