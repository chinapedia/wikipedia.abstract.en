JOHN RUTTER CHORLEY (31 July 1806, Blackley Hurst, Lancashire – 29 June 1867, London) was an English author, bibliophile, and Hispanist (also interested in other Romance studies).

Born in Blackley Hurst near Billinge, Merseyside, John Rutter Chorley was the older brother of the author and critic Henry Fothergill Chorley (1808–1872). In addition to his career in railway administration as corporate secretary to the Grand Junction Railway between Liverpool and Birmingham,[1] he worked as a private tutor. In 1845 a bequest[2] from his uncle made him independently wealthy and he retired and moved to London. With help from George Ticknor, (1815–1872) and experts at the British Museum, Chorley became a significant collector as a bibliophile.

Among his friends was Thomas Carlyle.[3]
