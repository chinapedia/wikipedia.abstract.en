ST JAMES in Saint Peter Port, Guernsey, formerly called the church of ST JAMES-THE-LESS, has since 1985 become a concert and assembly hall providing the island with a unique and versatile venue.


History

In October 1815 Admiral James de Saumarez suggested the idea of building a church for use by the British garrison based in Guernsey where services could be held in English (as against French in other island churches). The church was designed by John Wilson and completed by 1818,[1][2] at a cost of nearly £7,000.[3]

Sketched in 1832 by J. M. W. Turner.[4] Used as a chapel by nearby Elizabeth College.

In 1970 the church became redundant and started to decay until in 1981 _The Friends of St James_ association was formed to restore and manage the building. The States of Guernsey agreed to pay for this restoration in 1983 and the building was officially re-opened on 5 July 1985 by the Duke of Kent.[5] The restoration of the building winning a Civic Trust Award in 1986.[6][7]

In 2002 the Dorey Centre, comprising meeting rooms, café and administration offices, were completed,[8] which gave the centre additional facilities such as exhibition space and to cater for formal dinners and weddings. The gallery was chosen to house the Guernsey Millennium Tapestry.
