The WORLD PORRIDGE MAKING CHAMPIONSHIP has been running since 1994, giving a main prize of the "Golden Spurtle" trophy and the title "World Porridge Making Champion" for the best traditional porridge made with oatmeal, water and salt. A prize is also awarded for the best "Speciality" porridge which again is made with oatmeal and contenders can add their own ingredients. The competition takes place at the village hall[1] in Carrbridge, in the Cairngorms National Park, Scotland.[2] and is run by volunteers on behalf of the Carrbridge Community Council. It has taken place alongside World Porridge Day since 2009.[3]. The 2018 competition was held on Saturday 6 October.
