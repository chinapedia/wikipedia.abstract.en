Plot

Kameshwaran is a talented advertisement film director who works in a company owned by Vanangamudi, in which Kamu's cousin Rameshwaran is the CEO of that same company. Despite being more talented and skillful than Ramu, Kamu does not become the CEO because of a small mistake that he did the past. He rues over this issue and blames Lord Brahmma for making his life not as he wished for. Kamu is in love with Manisha, an advertisement model, and she too reciprocates his feelings.

On Kamu's birthday, he happens to visit a temple for performing puja. As it is closing time for the temple, the Gurakkal asks Kamu to perform pooja at Brahmma's sanctum. There, Kamu blames Brahmma for all his miseries and prays for a better life. Later that day, he gets a friends request in Facebook from someone called "Brahmma", who actually happens to be Lord Brahmma. Thinking that someone is playing a prank on him, he accepts the request and begins a chat. Soon, Kamu is perplexed by the actions of Brahmma, as he claims that he knows everything about Kamu and provides photos from his childhood up to the present moment as a proof. Kamu is shocked by this and informs this to his friends Jagan and Maya. They also do the same thing, and Brahmma sends their pics, also to their surprise.

Maya unknowingly presses a combination of keys on the laptop, enabling a click button, which upon getting clicked, reverses everything that happened in their lives until one year ago. Kamu is sent one year back to the very moment where he made the mistake which made him not get the CEO post. He gets an opportunity to reverse this. He becomes the CEO, and Ramu becomes the director. However, things take a turn, and he finds out that Manisha is in love with Ramu. When he foresees the future through the link in his laptop, he finds that he is in a position to marry someone else. Whether he will be able to turn the events back and win Manisha forms the rest of the story, with some interesting twists and a good message.
