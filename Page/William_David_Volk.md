During that time, Volk also created the "Draw" and "Draw Plus"[10] drafting programs for the Commodore Amiga.

In 1988 he moved to Activison where he became the Director of Technology,[11] eventually becoming the VP of Technology in 1991. At Activision he was head of the team that produced the first entertainment CD-ROM title, The Manhole [12] (based on the Cyan Hypercard game title).

While at Activision, he invented and was awarded U.S. Patent #5,095,509 on March 10, 1992[14] which enabled IBM personal computers to reproduce digitally sampled audio.

During his time with Activison, he designed the (M.A.D.E) game engine. M.A.D.E. was originally created for the DOS version of The Manhole[15] and was used on the DOS Floppy and CD-ROM versions, the NEC 9801 version and the FM Towns version as well as LGOP2, for the Return to Zork[16] and _Rodney's Funscreen_.[17]

Over the Years Volk has founded, co-founded and contributed to a number of companies, including _ZipProof_,[18] _The Bonus Mobile Entertainment_ (co-founded that with Sherri Cuono)[19] where he co-designed a multiplayer mobile game titled _The Dozens_ [20] which was licensed from the card game of the same name created by the Wayans Brothers.

While at BME he also created the ringtone brand known as _Rude Tones_.[21] PlayScreen LLC acquired the assets of MyNuMo (a company co-founded my Volk with Sherri Cuono in 2006) in Nov. 2010. Volk is credited with creating the concept for iWhack, the first iPhone game released (July 2007).[22][23] Volk co-designed several games at MyNuMo including _Pigs A Pop'N_,[24] and _Bailout Bonanza_.[25][26] Volk is currently the Chief Futurist of Forward Reality, LLC.[27]
