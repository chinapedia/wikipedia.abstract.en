As the video progresses, you can see major cities along the coast and the Japanese islands on the Philippine Sea. The island of Guam can be seen further down the pass into the Philippine Sea, and the pass ends just to the east of New Zealand. A lightning storm can be seen as light pulses near the end of the video.]]

This article describes the GEOGRAPHY OF THE UNITED STATES TERRITORY OF GUAM.

Location: Oceania, island in the North Pacific Ocean, about a quarter of the way from the Philippines to Hawaii, United States
Geographic coordinates:
Map references: Oceania
Area:

:* Total: 544 km²

:* Land: 544 km²

:* Water: 0 km²

Area (comparative):
    Three times the size of Washington, D.C.

Land boundaries: Approximately  long and  wide, narrowing to  at the center.

Coastline:
Maritime claims:

:* Territorial sea:

:* Exclusive economic zone:

:* The southern maritime boundary of Guam forms a border with the Federated States of Micronesia, and the northern maritime boundary forms a border with the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands.

Climate:
    Tropical marine; generally warm and humid, moderated by northeast trade winds; dry season from January to June, wet season from July to December; little seasonal temperature variation.

Terrain:
    Volcanic origin, surrounded by coral reefs; relatively flat coralline limestone plateau (source of most freshwater), with steep coastal cliffs and narrow coastal plains in north, low-rising hills in center, mountains in south. Soils are mostly silty clay or clay and may be gray, black, brown or reddish brown; acidity and depth vary.[1]

Elevation extremes:

:* Lowest point: Pacific Ocean, [2]

:* Highest points:

:*# Mount Lamlam, [3]

:*# Mount Jumullong Manglo,

:*# Mount Bolanos,

Natural resources:
    Commercial fishing (mostly servicing and unloading of longline fleets and commercial vessels), recreational fishing of Indo-Pacific Blue Marlin (_Makaira mazara_), Wahoo (_Acanthocybium solandri_), Mahi-mahi (_Coryphaena hippurus_), Yellowfin tuna (_Thunnus albacares_), and deepwater reef fish, tourism (especially from Japan but increasingly from China and South Korea).

Land use:

:* Arable land: 1.85%

:* Permanent crops: 16.67%

:* Other: 81.48% (2012 est.)

Irrigated land:
    2 ^(km)2

Natural hazards:
    Frequent squalls during wet season; relatively rare, but potentially very destructive typhoons (typhoons are possible in any season but most common from August through December)

Environment - current issues:
    Extirpation of native bird population by the rapid proliferation of the Brown tree snake (_Boiga irregularis_), an exotic species. Island also supports feral populations of introduced deer, Pigs (_Sus scrofa_) and Carabao (_Bubalus bubalis carabanesis_).

Geography - note:
    Largest and southernmost island in the Mariana Islands archipelago; strategic location in western North Pacific Ocean.
