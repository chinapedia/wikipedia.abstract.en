DAVID "_DAWSEY_" KEWLEY (1850 – 25 March 1904) was a Manx boatman, member of the Douglas Rocket Brigade and volunteer in the Lifeboat Service, renowned for his involvement in the saving of lives at sea. The actual number of people saved from drowning by _Dawsey_ differ. Some contemporary reports list that he saved as many as 38 lives,[1] others 25,[2] but it is generally recognised that he was directly involved in saving the lives of at least 23 people, and as a member of the Douglas Lifeboat Crew assisted in the saving of many more. He was a recipient of numerous awards from the Royal Humane Society for his life-saving exploits.[3][4][5] Although a man of dauntless courage, he would never speak about his feats and disliked hearing other people talk about them.[6]


Biography

David Kewley (always known by his sobriquet of _"Dawsey"_)[7] was born in Douglas, Isle of Man in 1850, the eighth of ten children and brought up in the tough Fairy Ground area of the town.[8] His father, also known as _Dawsey,_ was a boatman and fisherman working an open lug-boat. After receiving a somewhat limited education the younger Kewley joined his older brother and father in the fishing trade.[9]

Regarded as singularly unassuming in character, modest, retiring and of a kindly nature, he took employment with the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company in 1877[10] as a boatman, living at 11, New Bond St, Douglas and later Shaw's Brow.

Well known as a highly accomplished oarsman and swimmer, _Dawsey_ competed in numerous rowing regattas around the Isle of Man and the northwest of England gaining success on many occasions, not least[11][12] in the early 1870s, when as stroke oar of a crew which caused something of a sensation.[13] Turning up at an event with three colleagues; Charles Kewin, John Cain and Hugh Rogers[14] and an old gig which the four men had patched up themselves and known as _"The Hobblers Boat,"_[15] _(the term "hobbler" applying to a waterman or pier porter)_ they competed in a race against several well trained racing crews, and to the astonishment of everyone, won easily.[16] In turn they raced against professional crews from Manchester and Dumbarton enjoying further success.[17] They twice won the Duke of Devonshire's prize at Barrow-in-Furness competing against, and beating, a celebrated crew of boatmen from Barrow who were stroked by the renowned Anthony Strong.

_Dawsey_ was said to have been an ideal stroke oar. Average in height with a superb physique, he reached well forward and pulled his oar cleanly through the water, finishing powerfully.[18] As well as becoming the stroke oar of the premier Douglas four, _Dawsey_ also competed in the pairs category with John Cain (_Dawsey_ and Cain were never beaten in a paired-oar race) as well as individually in the sculls.[19]

Rescues

Certain reports from contemporary sources cite what at the time was thought to be insufficient recognition towards the endeavors of _Dawsey_ by the Royal Humane Society.[20] On various occasions it was questioned whether _Dawsey_ had in fact received sufficient acknowledgement for his heroism, a fact supporting the assertion being that he'd _"only"_ received certificates[21] when it was generally regarded that awards from the society such as gold, silver and bronze medals had been bestowed on individuals of higher social status for lesser endeavors.[22][23] One such person who was instrumental in trying to highlight this perceived short-coming was the High Bailiff of Douglas, Samuel Harris, who on several occasions described _Dawsey_ as: _"the bravest man in the town."_[24][25] Following numerous letters written to the society by such as Samuel Harris, these concerns were addressed following a rescue which _Dawsey_ was involved in on 28 July 1888, and for which his bravery was recognised by the awarding of a bronze medal.[26]

DETAILED BELOW ARE SOME OF THE VARIOUS RESCUES IN WHICH _DAWSEY_ KEWLEY WAS INVOLVED:

18 October 1878

On the evening of Friday 18 October 1878, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company steamer _Snaefell_ was in the process of docking in Douglas Harbour when one of her passengers, Dr Hemming,[27] fell off the ship and into the harbour.[28] On witnessing the event, despite the darkness, _Dawsey_ immediately jumped into the water and made towards the man, managing to take him towards a ladder by which he was able to support himself and Dr Hemming.[29] After approximately 20 minutes a boat arrived and took both _Dawsey_ and Dr Hemming to safety.[30] Reports state that Dr Hemming was the third person which _Dawsey_ had rescued within four months.[31] For saving the life of Dr Hemming, _Dawsey_ Kewley received his first award from the Royal Humane Society.[32]

2 August 1879

On Saturday 2 August 1879, a harbour porter named Thomas Sheard fell into the water between two steamers which were docked alongside the Victoria Pier.[33] Again _Dawsey_ immediately jumped into the water and performed a rescue, with complete disregard for his own safety.[34] The rescue of Sheard resulted in _Dawsey_ receiving another award from the Royal Humane Society[35] accompanied by a written commendation on vellum: The presentation was made by the High Bailiff of the Isle of Man at a ceremony on 25 October 1879.[36]

5 August 1882

Another incident involving a harbour porter occurred in Douglas Harbour, again concerning the steamer _Snaefell_ on Saturday 5 August 1882, a scene witnessed by hundreds of people.[37] The _Snaefell_ had arrived from Liverpool and was in the process of discharging its passengers when the porter, who was making his way onto the ship, fell into the water and was in danger of being drowned. A passenger on board the steamer in turn leapt into the water so as to render assistance, but he in turn quickly got himself into trouble.[38] Kewley was alerted to the situation and jumped into the water and managed to support the two men until a rope was thrown enabling the men to be lifted from the water.[39]

30 May 1884

A report of a further rescue was one of a small boy who had fallen into the inner harbour, Douglas, on Friday 30 May 1884.[40] The young boy, who had been playing in the vicinity of the steamer _Tynwald_,[41] fell into the water and due to an ebbing tide was being drawn under the vessel.[42] _Dawsey_ managed to get to the young boy, after some initial trouble, and brought him safely to the surface and onwards to the shore.[43]

25 September 1884

A strange irony is that on one occasion it was _Dawsey's_ life which had to be saved.[44] The incident occurred on the evening of Thursday 25 September 1884, when the steamer _Ben-my-Chree_ was securing alongside the harbour wall.[45] _Dawsey_ was part of a team of dockers positioning the gangway to the vessel when he slipped over, his head striking the _Ben-my-Chree's_ sponson, and subsequently fell into the water.[46] Temporarily stunned, _Dawsey_ sunk beneath the water, which led to the _Ben-my-Chree's_ Third Officer, Dalzell Torrance, jumping into the water in order to save _Dawsey._ In time a rope was thrown to Third Officer Torrance, enabling him and the unconscious _Dawsey_ to be pulled to the steps of the pier.[47]

_The saving of Dawsey was the fourth time Dalzell Torrance had performed a life saving act._[48]

28 July 1888

Together with another Douglas boatman, John Lewin, _Dawsey_ saved the life of a man who'd jumped off the Victoria Pier on Saturday 28 July 1888. Intent on self-harm, the man initially refused assistance which led to _Dawsey_ jumping into the water followed by Lewin.[49] The man was in great difficulty in the water, however _Dawsey_ and Lewin were able to support him and take him to the shore, from where he was taken to hospital.[50] In recognition for this rescue, both John Lewin and _Dawsey_ received bronze medals from the Royal Humane Society.[51] The medals were presented to John Lewin and _Dawsey_ by the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Sir Spencer Walpole, at a reception on 14 November 1888. A Testimonial Fund had also been created in recognition of _Dawsey's_ bravery which had, through public donations, raised the amount of £41 and this was also presented to him at the ceremony.[52] Isle_of_Man_Steam_Packet_Company_Landsmen_(1900).jpg

9 August 1893

On the afternoon of Wednesday 9 August 1893, a young boy fell into the sea whilst fishing on the Victoria Pier and was subsequently rescued by _Dawsey._[53]

13 September 1893

On the night of Wednesday 13 September 1893 the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company steamer, _Peveril,_ was involved in a collision with a small boat as she was making her way from the Victoria Pier to the inner harbour at Douglas. The small boat, named the _Daisy,_ was on its way to put a light on the yacht _Vision_ when she cut across the _Peveril's_ path, and was cut in two. The solitary person on board the _Daisy,_ John _"Kitty"_ O'Neil, jumped clear just before impact and was subsequently picked out of the water by three dockers; _Dawsey,_ Paul Bridson and another man named Higgin, who took to a small boat in order to carry out the rescue.[54]


Death

_Dawsey_ Kewley contracted pleurisy in February 1904. He was initially looked after at home, but was transferred to Noble's Hospital, Douglas, on Wednesday 23 March and died in the early hours of Friday 25 March.[55] His cause of death was given as pneumonia, which may well have been attributed to his numerous immersions in icy-cold water.[56] The_grave_of_David_‘Dawsey’_Kewley.jpg

Funeral

The funeral of _Dawsey_ Kewley took place on the afternoon of Sunday 27 March 1904. It was an occasion of a demonstration of popular respect for a brave seaman, who had done so much for others in his lifetime.[57] Led by members of the Order of Foresters (Star of Mona), of which _Dawsey_ was a member, and the Douglas Town Band, the cortege left his home at 1, Shaw's Brow, followed by a very large crowd to St Matthew's Church,[58] Douglas, where _Dawsey_ had for many years been one of the foremost members of the congregation. The service was conducted by the Reverend T.A. Taggart, to whom _Dawsey_ was known personally.[59] Those attending _Dawsey's_ funeral included a large representation of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company led by Dalrymple Maitland and William Hutchinson[60] as well as the Mayor of Douglas, members of the Lifeboat Committee, the Douglas Swimming Club and the Victoria Swimming Club. Following the service _Dawsey's_ body was taken for interment at Braddan Parish Cemetery.[61] Reports of the funeral state that the crowd of mourners stretched from the cemetery all the way back to the Quarterbridge.[62]

_Dawsey's_ death was followed by that of his daughter, Frances Kewley, who died less than two months after him and was in turn interred with her father.[63]_Dawsey_ had been pre-deceased by two of his children a son, David, and another daughter, Mary, both of whom had died in infancy.[64]_Dawsey_ was survived by his wife and another son.[65]

The headstone on _Dawsey's_ grave is that of Manx Runic Cross from a design by Manx artist Archibald Knox;[66] the work being carried out by Thomas Quayle & Sons, Douglas, Isle of Man.[67] Dawsey_Kewley_Memorial_(2).jpg.]]


Monument

Dawsey's_Memorial_-_unveiling_ceremony.jpg Following _Dawsey's_ death a meeting was held, presided over by the Mayor of Douglas,[68] at which it was decided that a monument was to be erected in his memory through public subscription.

The monument was erected by W. Cathcart of Glasgow and is made of Aberdeen granite.[69] It was originally a drinking fountain and water trough with the water issuing from the mouth of a stone lion. In the panel above the lion is a sculpture typifying one of _Dawsey's_ rescues.[70] Originally situated at the apex of the Pier Buildings on the Victoria Pier[71] the monument was unveiled by the Deputy Governor of the Isle of Man, Deemster Thomas Kneen, on Thursday 8 June 1905.[72] Numerous civic dignitaries were in attendance and during the course of the ceremony two certificates from the Royal Humane Society were awarded to Samuel Webb, in recognition for his rescue of a young boy who's fallen into the sea off Douglas Promenade, and to G. Cowin for rescuing an elderly lady from Douglas Harbour.[73] At the moment of the unveiling salutes were fired from the Douglas Rocket Station and Douglas Head Lighthouse.[74]

Following the construction of the new Douglas Sea Terminal in the late 1960s the monument was sited for many years at the southern end of Douglas Promenade adjacent to a car park. It was moved to its current site in one of the promenade's sunken gardens following renovation work.[75]
