The SYNOD OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA is the entity of the Uniting Church in Australia covering most of the state of Western Australia, south of a line near Port Hedland. It is one of six geographically-based Synods of the church. The leader of the Synod is the _moderator_ elected to the position for a period of three years.

The Uniting Church has a series of inter-related councils, which do not strictly represent a hierarchy. The National Assembly is responsible for issues of doctrine. Each state has a Synod which is responsible for property. Presbyteries are responsible for the selection, training and oversight of ministers.


Presbyteries

A synod may relate to a number of Presbyteries within its bounds. The Synod of Western Australia previously had five presbyteries, but in 2006 the presbyteries merged, and the structure simplified so that now there is one presbytery covering the same area as the synod.[1]

The original presbyteries in Western Australia before merging to one were:[2]

-   North West
-   Peel
-   Perth
-   Stirling
-   Swan
