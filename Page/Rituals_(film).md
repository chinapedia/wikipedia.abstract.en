_RITUALS_ (also known as _THE CREEPER_) is a 1977 Canadian horror/thriller film directed by Peter Carter. It centers on a group of doctors who are menaced while on a camping getaway trip in Northern Ontario.


Plot

Doctors go on a wilderness weekend retreat deep in the bushes of Northern Ontario. Around the campfire, they begin to drink and bicker among themselves about whose field is more intellectually demanding. Suddenly, they all have their boots stolen.

Reception

_The Terror Trap_ awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising the film's atmosphere, editing, and Holbrook's performance, calling it "[an] above average journey-into-hell gem".[3] Brett H. from _Oh, the Horror!_ gave the film a positive review, praising the film's characters, soundtrack, suspense, and ending; calling it " a gripping nail biter that will please slasher and horror aficionados immensely, and is one of the key pieces to the puzzle of Maple Leaf Macabre."[4] Justin Kerswell from _Hysteria Lives!_ gave the film 4/5 stars, writing, "Not since _Deliverance_ ... has the wilderness held such terror"[5] John Townsend from _HorrorNews.net_ praised the film, writing, "Watching _Rituals_ having seen so many of these subsequent films drives home the fact that it is possible to make a taut, tense horror thriller without the need for huge swathes of special effects and gallons of fake blood. There is more character, story and enjoyment to be had in this film and in much of the current franchise put together."[6] Phil Michaels from _The Spinning Image_ gave the film 7/10 stars, writing, "On the face of it, _Rituals_ is complete rubbish but if you are willing to work at it a little then you might find it rewarding."[7] Stuart Giesel from _Digital Retribution_ rated the film 4.5 out of 5, stating, "_Rituals_ is another reason why the 70's is, in my mind, the best decade for films: it's brutal, unsentimental, unflinching and utterly compelling."[8]

The film was not without its detractors. _TV Guide_ awarded the film 1/5 stars, calling it "[a] cheap north-of-the-border ripoff of _Deliverance_".[9] Author and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film 1.5 out of four stars, calling it "unpleasant".[10]
