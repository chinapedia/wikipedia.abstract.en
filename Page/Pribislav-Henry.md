PRIBISLAV-HENRY (; d. 1150) was a Slavic Christian prince and the last ruler of the Hevelli (Stodorani) tribe in the Northern March of Brandenburg.[1] His reign started, probably supported by the Ascanians, after the prior Hevelli prince Meinfried had been murdered in 1127.[2] Having no sons of his own, he around 1129 gave the area between Brandenburg and Lehnin to his son-in-law, who was the oldest son of Albert the Bear.[3] Emperor Lothair III approved the gift and made Albert margrave of the Northern March in 1134.[4] In 1150, Pribislav Henry died and was succeeded, after a short war of succession, by Albert the Bear.[5]
