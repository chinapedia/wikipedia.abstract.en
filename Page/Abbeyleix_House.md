ABBEYLEIX HOUSE, sometimes called ABBEYLEIX CASTLE, is an Irish country house that was the residence of the Viscounts de Vesci in County Laois, Ireland. It was designed by architect James Wyatt and built by Sir William Chambers in 1773. The De Vesci family lived at Abbeyleix House until it was sold in the mid-1990's. The Abbeyleix is the oldest planned estate town in Ireland.[1]


History

The house was near the original Abbeyleix, that was built near the River Nore where there was a Cistercian Monastery and a Church of Ireland[2] on the estate. The mansion was part of an 1135 statute acre estate.[3] The area was prone to flooding so John Vessey 2nd Viscount de Vesci relocated the town farther east on higher ground, as a planned estate town, with the estate and mansion southwest of the town.[4]
