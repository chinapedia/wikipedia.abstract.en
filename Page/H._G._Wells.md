HERBERT GEORGE WELLS[1][2] (21 September 1866 – 13 August 1946) was an English writer. He was prolific in many genres, writing dozens of novels, short stories, and works of social commentary, satire, biography, and autobiography, and even including two books on recreational war games. He is now best remembered for his science fiction novels and is often called a "father of science fiction", along with Jules Verne and Hugo Gernsback.[3][4]

During his own lifetime, however, he was most prominent as a forward-looking, even prophetic social critic who devoted his literary talents to the development of a progressive vision on a global scale. A futurist, he wrote a number of utopian works and foresaw the advent of aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television and something resembling the World Wide Web.[5] His science fiction imagined time travel, alien invasion, invisibility, and biological engineering. Brian Aldiss referred to Wells as the "Shakespeare of science fiction".[6] Wells rendered his works convincing by instilling commonplace detail alongside a single extraordinary assumption – dubbed “Wells’s law” – leading Joseph Conrad to hail him in 1898 as "O Realist of the Fantastic!".[7] His most notable science fiction works include _The Time Machine_ (1895), _The Island of Doctor Moreau_ (1896), _The Invisible Man_ (1897), _The War of the Worlds_ (1898) and the military science fiction _The War in the Air_ (1907). Wells was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times.[8]

Wells's earliest specialised training was in biology, and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a specifically and fundamentally Darwinian context.[9] He was also from an early date an outspoken socialist, often (but not always, as at the beginning of the First World War) sympathising with pacifist views. His later works became increasingly political and didactic, and he wrote little science fiction, while he sometimes indicated on official documents that his profession was that of journalist.[10] Novels such as _Kipps_ and _The History of Mr Polly_, which describe lower-middle-class life, led to the suggestion that he was a worthy successor to Charles Dickens,[11] but Wells described a range of social strata and even attempted, in _Tono-Bungay_ (1909), a diagnosis of English society as a whole. Wells was a diabetic and co-founded the charity The Diabetic Association (known today as Diabetes UK) in 1934.[12]


Life

Early life

Herbert George Wells was born at Atlas House, 162 High Street in Bromley, Kent,[13] on 21 September 1866.[14] Called "Bertie" in the family, he was the fourth and last child of Joseph Wells (a former domestic gardener, and at the time a shopkeeper and professional cricketer) and his wife, Sarah Neal (a former domestic servant). An inheritance had allowed the family to acquire a shop in which they sold china and sporting goods, although it failed to prosper: the stock was old and worn out, and the location was poor. Joseph Wells managed to earn a meagre income, but little of it came from the shop and he received an unsteady amount of money from playing professional cricket for the Kent county team.[15] Payment for skilled bowlers and batsmen came from voluntary donations afterwards, or from small payments from the clubs where matches were played.

A defining incident of young Wells's life was an accident in 1874 that left him bedridden with a broken leg.[16] To pass the time he began to read books from the local library, brought to him by his father. He soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access; they also stimulated his desire to write. Later that year he entered Thomas Morley's Commercial Academy, a private school founded in 1849, following the bankruptcy of Morley's earlier school. The teaching was erratic, the curriculum mostly focused, Wells later said, on producing copperplate handwriting and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen. Wells continued at Morley's Academy until 1880. In 1877, his father, Joseph Wells, suffered a fractured thigh. The accident effectively put an end to Joseph's career as a cricketer, and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income.[17]

, where his mother, Sarah, was housekeeper.[18]]] No longer able to support themselves financially, the family instead sought to place their sons as apprentices in various occupations.[19] From 1880 to 1883, Wells had an unhappy apprenticeship as a draper at the Southsea Drapery Emporium, Hyde's.[20] His experiences at Hyde's, where he worked a thirteen-hour day and slept in a dormitory with other apprentices,[21] later inspired his novels _The Wheels of Chance_, _The History of Mr Polly_, and _Kipps_, which portray the life of a draper's apprentice as well as providing a critique of society's distribution of wealth.[22]

Wells's parents had a turbulent marriage, owing primarily to his mother's being a Protestant and his father's being a freethinker. When his mother returned to work as a lady's maid (at Uppark, a country house in Sussex), one of the conditions of work was that she would not be permitted to have living space for her husband and children. Thereafter, she and Joseph lived separate lives, though they never divorced and remained faithful to each other. As a consequence, Herbert's personal troubles increased as he subsequently failed as a draper and also, later, as a chemist's assistant. However, Uppark had a magnificent library in which he immersed himself, reading many classic works, including Plato's _Republic_, Thomas More's _Utopia_, and the works of Daniel Defoe.[23] This would be the beginning of Wells's venture into literature.

Teacher

In October 1879, Wells's mother arranged through a distant relative, Arthur Williams, for him to join the National School at Wookey in Somerset as a pupil–teacher, a senior pupil who acted as a teacher of younger children.[24] In December that year, however, Williams was dismissed for irregularities in his qualifications and Wells was returned to Uppark. After a short apprenticeship at a chemist in nearby Midhurst and an even shorter stay as a boarder at Midhurst Grammar School, he signed his apprenticeship papers at Hyde's. In 1883, Wells persuaded his parents to release him from the apprenticeship, taking an opportunity offered by Midhurst Grammar School again to become a pupil–teacher; his proficiency in Latin and science during his earlier short stay had been remembered.[25][26]

The years he spent in Southsea had been the most miserable of his life to that point, but his good fortune at securing a position at Midhurst Grammar School meant that Wells could continue his self-education in earnest.[27] The following year, Wells won a scholarship to the Normal School of Science (later the Royal College of Science in South Kensington, now part of Imperial College London) in London, studying biology under Thomas Henry Huxley.[28] As an alumnus, he later helped to set up the Royal College of Science Association, of which he became the first president in 1909. Wells studied in his new school until 1887, with a weekly allowance of 21 shillings (a guinea) thanks to his scholarship. This ought to have been a comfortable sum of money (at the time many working class families had "round about a pound a week" as their entire household income)[29] yet in his _Experiment in Autobiography_, Wells speaks of constantly being hungry, and indeed photographs of him at the time show a youth who is very thin and malnourished.[30] ]] He soon entered the Debating Society of the school. These years mark the beginning of his interest in a possible reformation of society. At first approaching the subject through Plato's _Republic_, he soon turned to contemporary ideas of socialism as expressed by the recently formed Fabian Society and free lectures delivered at Kelmscott House, the home of William Morris. He was also among the founders of _The Science School Journal_, a school magazine that allowed him to express his views on literature and society, as well as trying his hand at fiction; a precursor to his novel _The Time Machine_ was published in the journal under the title _The Chronic Argonauts_. The school year 1886–87 was the last year of his studies.[31]

During 1888, Wells stayed in Stoke-on-Trent, living in Basford. The unique environment of The Potteries was certainly an inspiration. He wrote in a letter to a friend from the area that "the district made an immense impression on me." The inspiration for some of his descriptions in _The War of the Worlds_ is thought to have come from his short time spent here, seeing the iron foundry furnaces burn over the city, shooting huge red light into the skies. His stay in The Potteries also resulted in the macabre short story "The Cone" (1895, contemporaneous with his famous _The Time Machine_), set in the north of the city.[32]

After teaching for some time, he was briefly on the staff of Holt Academy in Wales[33] – Wells found it necessary to supplement his knowledge relating to educational principles and methodology and entered the College of Preceptors (College of Teachers). He later received his Licentiate and Fellowship FCP diplomas from the College. It was not until 1890 that Wells earned a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology from the University of London External Programme. In 1889–90, he managed to find a post as a teacher at Henley House School in London, where he taught A. A. Milne (whose father ran the school).[34][35] His first published work was a _Text-Book of Biology_ in two volumes (1893).[36]

Upon leaving the Normal School of Science, Wells was left without a source of income. His aunt Mary—his father's sister-in-law—invited him to stay with her for a while, which solved his immediate problem of accommodation. During his stay at his aunt's residence, he grew increasingly interested in her daughter, Isabel. He would later go on to court her. To earn money, he began writing short humorous articles for journals such as _The Pall Mall Gazette_, later collecting these in volume form as _Select Conversations with an Uncle_ (1895) and _Certain Personal Matters_ (1897). So prolific did Wells become at this mode of journalism that many of his early pieces remain unidentified. According to David C Smith, "Most of Wells's occasional pieces have not been collected, and many have not even been identified as his. Wells did not automatically receive the byline his reputation demanded until after 1896 or so ... As a result, many of his early pieces are unknown. It is obvious that many early Wells items have been lost."[37] His success with these shorter pieces encouraged him to write book-length work, and he published his first novel, _The Time Machine_, in 1895.[38]

Personal life

, where Wells lived from May 1895 until late 1896[39]]]

In 1891, Wells married his cousin Isabel Mary Wells (1865–1931; from 1902 Isabel Mary Smith). The couple agreed to separate in 1894, when he had fallen in love with one of his students, Amy Catherine Robbins (1872–1927; later known as Jane), with whom he moved to Woking, Surrey in May 1895. They lived in a rented house, 'Lynton', (now No.141) Maybury Road in the town centre for just under 18 months[40] and married at St Pancras register office in October 1895.[41] His short period in Woking was perhaps the most creative and productive of his whole writing career,[42] for while there he planned and wrote _The War of the Worlds_ and _The Time Machine_, completed _The Island of Doctor Moreau_, wrote and published _The Wonderful Visit_ and _The Wheels of Chance_, and began writing two other early books, _When the Sleeper Wakes_ and _Love and Mr Lewisham_.[43][44]

In late summer 1896, Wells and Jane moved to a larger house in Worcester Park, near Kingston upon Thames, for two years; this lasted until his poor health took them to Sandgate, near Folkestone, where he constructed a large family home, Spade House, in 1901. He had two sons with Jane: George Philip (known as "Gip"; 1901–1985) and Frank Richard (1903–1982).[45] Jane died 6 October 1927, in Dunmow, at the age of 55.

Wells had affairs with a significant number of women.[46] In December 1909, he had a daughter, Anna-Jane, with the writer Amber Reeves,[47] whose parents, William and Maud Pember Reeves, he had met through the Fabian Society. Amber had married the barrister G. R. Blanco White in July of that year, as co-arranged by Wells. After Beatrice Webb voiced disapproval of Wells' "sordid intrigue" with Amber, he responded by lampooning Beatrice Webb and her husband Sidney Webb in his 1911 novel _The New Machiavelli_ as 'Altiora and Oscar Bailey', a pair of short-sighted, bourgeois manipulators. Between 1910–1913, novelist Elizabeth von Arnim was one of his mistresses.[48] In 1914, he had a son, Anthony West (1914–1987), by the novelist and feminist Rebecca West, 26 years his junior.[49] In 1920–21, and intermittently until his death, he had a love affair with the American birth control activist Margaret Sanger.[50] Between 1924 and 1933 he partnered with the 22-year younger Dutch adventurer and writer Odette Keun, with whom he lived in _Lou Pidou_, a house they built together in Grasse, France. Wells dedicated his longest book to her (_The World of William Clissold_, 1926).[51] When visiting Maxim Gorky in Russia 1920, he had slept with Gorky's mistress Moura Budberg, then still Countess Benckendorf and 27 years his junior. In 1933, when she left Gorky and emigrated to London, their relationship renewed and she cared for him through his final illness. Wells asked her to marry him repeatedly, but Budberg strongly rejected his proposals. [52][53]

In _Experiment in Autobiography_ (1934), Wells wrote: "I was never a great amorist, though I have loved several people very deeply".[54] David Lodge's novel _A Man of Parts_ (2011)—a 'narrative based on factual sources' (author's note)—gives a convincing and generally sympathetic account of Wells's relations with the women mentioned above, and others.[55]

Director Simon Wells (born 1961), the author's great-grandson, was a consultant on the future scenes in _Back to the Future Part II_ (1989).[56]

Artist

One of the ways that Wells expressed himself was through his drawings and sketches. One common location for these was the endpapers and title pages of his own diaries, and they covered a wide variety of topics, from political commentary to his feelings toward his literary contemporaries and his current romantic interests. During his marriage to Amy Catherine, whom he nicknamed Jane, he drew a considerable number of pictures, many of them being overt comments on their marriage. During this period, he called these pictures "picshuas".[57] These picshuas have been the topic of study by Wells scholars for many years, and in 2006, a book was published on the subject.[58]

Writer

from _The War of the Worlds_ in Woking, England. The book is a seminal depiction of a conflict between mankind and an extraterrestrial race.]]

Some of his early novels, called "scientific romances", invented several themes now classic in science fiction in such works as _The Time Machine_, _The Island of Doctor Moreau_, _The Invisible Man_, _The War of the Worlds_, _When the Sleeper Wakes_, and _The First Men in the Moon_. He also wrote realistic novels that received critical acclaim, including _Kipps_ and a critique of English culture during the Edwardian period, _Tono-Bungay_. Wells also wrote dozens of short stories and novellas, including, "The Flowering of the Strange Orchid", which helped bring the full impact of Darwin's revolutionary botanical ideas to a wider public, and was followed by many later successes such as "The Country of the Blind" (1904).[59]

According to James Gunn, one of Wells's major contributions to the science fiction genre was his approach, which he referred to as his "new system of ideas".[60] In his opinion, the author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible, even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible, allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could really happen, today referred to as "the plausible impossible" and "suspension of disbelief". While neither invisibility nor time travel was new in speculative fiction, Wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with. He conceived the idea of using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term "time machine", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle.[61] He explained that while writing _The Time Machine_, he realized that "the more impossible the story I had to tell, the more ordinary must be the setting, and the circumstances in which I now set the Time Traveller were all that I could imagine of solid upper-class comforts."[62] In "Wells's Law", a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption. Being aware the notion of magic as something real had disappeared from society, he, therefore, used scientific ideas and theories as a substitute for magic to justify the impossible. Wells's best-known statement of the "law" appears in his introduction to _The Scientific Romances of H. G. Wells_ (1933),

  As soon as the magic trick has been done the whole business of the fantasy writer is to keep everything else human and real. Touches of prosaic detail are imperative and a rigorous adherence to the hypothesis. Any extra fantasy outside the cardinal assumption immediately gives a touch of irresponsible silliness to the invention.[63]

Dr. Griffin / The Invisible Man is a brilliant research scientist who discovers a method of invisibility, but finds himself unable to reverse the process. An enthusiast of random and irresponsible violence, Griffin has become an iconic character in horror fiction.[64] _The Island of Doctor Moreau_ sees a shipwrecked man left on the island home of Doctor Moreau, a mad scientist who creates human-like hybrid beings from animals via vivisection.[65] The earliest depiction of uplift, the novel deals with a number of philosophical themes, including pain and cruelty, moral responsibility, human identity, and human interference with nature.[66] Though _Tono-Bungay_ is not a science-fiction novel, radioactive decay plays a small but consequential role in it. Radioactive decay plays a much larger role in _The World Set Free_ (1914). This book contains what is surely his biggest prophetic "hit", with the first description of a nuclear weapon.[67] Scientists of the day were well aware that the natural decay of radium releases energy at a slow rate over thousands of years. The _rate_ of release is too slow to have practical utility, but the _total amount_ released is huge. Wells's novel revolves around an (unspecified) invention that accelerates the process of radioactive decay, producing bombs that explode with no more than the force of ordinary high explosives—but which "continue to explode" for days on end. "Nothing could have been more obvious to the people of the earlier twentieth century", he wrote, "than the rapidity with which war was becoming impossible ... [but] they did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands".[68] In 1932, the physicist and conceiver of nuclear chain reaction Leó Szilárd read _The World Set Free_ (the same year Sir James Chadwick discovered the neutron), a book which he said made a great impression on him.[69]

, located on the far side of the Moon, was named after the author of _The First Men in the Moon_ (1901) in 1970.]] Wells also wrote non-fiction. His first non-fiction bestseller was _Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress upon Human Life and Thought_ (1901). When originally serialised in a magazine it was subtitled "An Experiment in Prophecy", and is considered his most explicitly futuristic work. It offered the immediate political message of the privileged sections of society continuing to bar capable men from other classes from advancement until war would force a need to employ those most able, rather than the traditional upper classes, as leaders. Anticipating what the world would be like in the year 2000, the book is interesting both for its hits (trains and cars resulting in the dispersion of populations from cities to suburbs; moral restrictions declining as men and women seek greater sexual freedom; the defeat of German militarism, and the existence of a European Union) and its misses (he did not expect successful aircraft before 1950, and averred that "my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea").[70][71]

His bestselling two-volume work, _The Outline of History_ (1920), began a new era of popularised world history. It received a mixed critical response from professional historians.[72] However, it was very popular amongst the general population and made Wells a rich man. Many other authors followed with "Outlines" of their own in other subjects. He reprised his _Outline_ in 1922 with a much shorter popular work, _A Short History of the World_, a history book praised by Albert Einstein,[73] and two long efforts, _The Science of Life_ (1930) and _The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind_ (1931).[74][75] The "Outlines" became sufficiently common for James Thurber to parody the trend in his humorous essay, "An Outline of Scientists"—indeed, Wells's _Outline of History_ remains in print with a new 2005 edition, while _A Short History of the World_ has been re-edited (2006).[76]

From quite early in Wells's career, he sought a better way to organise society and wrote a number of Utopian novels. The first of these was _A Modern Utopia_ (1905), which shows a worldwide utopia with "no imports but meteorites, and no exports at all";[77] two travellers from our world fall into its alternate history. The others usually begin with the world rushing to catastrophe, until people realise a better way of living: whether by mysterious gases from a comet causing people to behave rationally and abandoning a European war (_In the Days of the Comet_ (1906)), or a world council of scientists taking over, as in _The Shape of Things to Come_ (1933, which he later adapted for the 1936 Alexander Korda film, _Things to Come_). This depicted, all too accurately, the impending World War, with cities being destroyed by aerial bombs. He also portrayed the rise of fascist dictators in _The Autocracy of Mr Parham_ (1930) and _The Holy Terror_ (1939). _Men Like Gods_ (1923) is also a utopian novel. Wells in this period was regarded as an enormously influential figure; the critic Malcolm Cowley stated: "by the time he was forty, his influence was wider than any other living English writer".[78]

Wells contemplates the ideas of nature and nurture and questions humanity in books such as _The Island of Doctor Moreau_. Not all his scientific romances ended in a Utopia, and Wells also wrote a dystopian novel, _When the Sleeper Wakes_ (1899, rewritten as _The Sleeper Awakes_, 1910), which pictures a future society where the classes have become more and more separated, leading to a revolt of the masses against the rulers.[79] _The Island of Doctor Moreau_ is even darker. The narrator, having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected (unsuccessfully) into human beings, eventually returns to England; like Gulliver on his return from the Houyhnhnms, he finds himself unable to shake off the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts, slowly reverting to their animal natures.[80]

Wells also wrote the preface for the first edition of W. N. P. Barbellion's diaries, _The Journal of a Disappointed Man_, published in 1919. Since "Barbellion" was the real author's pen name, many reviewers believed Wells to have been the true author of the _Journal_; Wells always denied this, despite being full of praise for the diaries.[81]

'' magazine, 20 September 1926]] In 1927, a Canadian teacher and writer Florence Deeks unsuccessfully sued Wells for infringement of copyright and breach of trust, claiming that much of _The Outline of History_ had been plagiarised from her unpublished manuscript,[82] _The Web of the World's Romance_, which had spent nearly nine months in the hands of Wells's Canadian publisher, Macmillan Canada.[83] However, it was sworn on oath at the trial that the manuscript remained in Toronto in the safekeeping of Macmillan, and that Wells did not even know it existed, let alone had seen it.[84] The court found no proof of copying, and decided the similarities were due to the fact that the books had similar nature and both writers had access to the same sources. In 2000, A. B. McKillop, a professor of history at Carleton University, produced a book on the case, _The Spinster & The Prophet: Florence Deeks, H. G. Wells, and the Mystery of the Purloined Past_.[85] According to McKillop, the lawsuit was unsuccessful due to the prejudice against a woman suing a well-known and famous male author, and he paints a detailed story based on the circumstantial evidence of the case.[86] In 2004, Denis N. Magnusson, Professor Emeritus of the Faculty of Law, Queen's University, Ontario, published an article on _Deeks v. Wells_. This re-examines the case in relation to McKillop's book. While having some sympathy for Deeks, he argues that she had a weak case that was not well presented, and though she may have met with sexism from her lawyers, she received a fair trial, adding that the law applied is essentially the same law that would be applied to a similar case today (i.e., 2004).[87]

In 1933, Wells predicted in _The Shape of Things to Come_ that the world war he feared would begin in January 1940,[88] a prediction which ultimately came true four months early, in September 1939, with the outbreak of World War II.[89] In 1936, before the Royal Institution, Wells called for the compilation of a constantly growing and changing World Encyclopaedia, to be reviewed by outstanding authorities and made accessible to every human being. In 1938, he published a collection of essays on the future organisation of knowledge and education, _World Brain_, including the essay "The Idea of a Permanent World Encyclopaedia".[90]

at Chiltern Court, Baker Street in the City of Westminster, London, where Wells lived between 1930 and 1936]] Prior to 1933, Wells's books were widely read in Germany and Austria, and most of his science fiction works had been translated shortly after publication.[91] By 1933, he had attracted the attention of German officials because of his criticism of the political situation in Germany, and on 10 May 1933, Wells's books were burned by the Nazi youth in Berlin's Opernplatz, and his works were banned from libraries and book stores.[92] Wells, as president of PEN International (Poets, Essayists, Novelists), angered the Nazis by overseeing the expulsion of the German PEN club from the international body in 1934 following the German PEN's refusal to admit non-Aryan writers to its membership. At a PEN conference in Ragusa, Wells refused to yield to Nazi sympathisers who demanded that the exiled author Ernst Toller be prevented from speaking.[93] Near the end of the World War II, Allied forces discovered that the SS had compiled lists of people slated for immediate arrest during the invasion of Britain in the abandoned Operation Sea Lion, with Wells included in the alphabetical list of "The Black Book".[94]

Seeking a more structured way to play war games, Wells also wrote _Floor Games_ (1911) followed by _Little Wars_ (1913), which set out rules for fighting battles with toy soldiers (miniatures).[95] _Little Wars_ is recognised today as the first recreational war game and Wells is regarded by gamers and hobbyists as "the Father of Miniature War Gaming".[96] A pacifist prior to the First World War, Wells stated "how much better is this amiable miniature [war] than the real thing".[97] According to Wells, the idea of the miniature war game developed from a visit by his friend Jerome K. Jerome. After dinner, Jerome began shooting down toy soldiers with a toy cannon and Wells joined in to compete.[98]

Travels to Russia

Wells visited Russia three times: 1914, 1920 and 1934. During his second visit, he saw his old friend Maxim Gorky and with Gorky's help, met Vladimir Lenin. In his book _Russia in the Shadows_, Wells portrayed Russia as recovering from a total social collapse, "the completest that has ever happened to any modern social organisation."[99] On 23 July 1934, after visiting U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Wells went to the Soviet Union and interviewed Joseph Stalin for three hours for the _New Statesman_ magazine, which was extremely rare at that time. He told Stalin how he had seen 'the happy faces of healthy people' in contrast with his previous visit to Moscow in 1920.[100] However, he also criticised the lawlessness, class-based discrimination, state violence, and absence of free expression. Stalin enjoyed the conversation and replied accordingly. As the chairman of the London-based PEN Club, which protected the rights of authors to write without being intimidated, Wells hoped by his trip to USSR, he could win Stalin over by force of argument. Before he left, he realized that no reform was to happen in the near future.[101][102]

Final years

Wells's literary reputation declined as he spent his later years promoting causes that were rejected by most of his contemporaries as well as by younger authors whom he had previously influenced. In this connection, George Orwell described Wells as "too sane to understand the modern world".[103] G. K. Chesterton quipped: "Mr Wells is a born storyteller who has sold his birthright for a pot of message".[104]

Wells had diabetes,[105] and was a co-founder in 1934 of The Diabetic Association (now Diabetes UK, the leading charity for people with diabetes in the UK).[106]

On 28 October 1940, on the radio station KTSA in San Antonio, Texas, Wells took part in a radio interview with Orson Welles, who two years previously had performed a famous radio adaptation of _The War of the Worlds_. During the interview, by Charles C Shaw, a KTSA radio host, Wells admitted his surprise at the widespread panic that resulted from the broadcast but acknowledged his debt to Welles for increasing sales of one of his "more obscure" titles.[107]

Death

at Wells' final home in Regent's Park, London]] Wells died of unspecified causes on 13 August 1946, aged 79, at his home at 13 Hanover Terrace, overlooking Regent's Park, London.[108][109] In his preface to the 1941 edition of _The War in the Air_, Wells had stated that his epitaph should be: "I told you so. You _damned_ fools".[110] Wells' body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 16 August 1946; his ashes were subsequently scattered into the English Channel at "Old Harry Rocks".[111]

A commemorative blue plaque in his honour was installed by the Greater London Council at his home in Regent's Park in 1966.[112]


Futurist

A renowned futurist and “visionary”, Wells foresaw the advent of aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television and something resembling the World Wide Web.[113] Asserting that “Wells visions of the future remain unsurpassed”, John Higgs, author of _Stranger Than We Can Imagine: Making Sense of the Twentieth Century_, states that in the late 19th century Wells “saw the coming century clearer than anyone else. He anticipated wars in the air, the sexual revolution, motorised transport causing the growth of suburbs and a proto-Wikipedia he called the “world brain”. He foresaw world wars creating a federalised Europe. Britain, he thought, would not fit comfortably in this New Europe and would identify more with the US and other English-speaking countries. In his novel _The World Set Free_, he imagined an “atomic bomb” of terrifying power that would be dropped from aeroplanes. This was an extraordinary insight for an author writing in 1913, and it made a deep impression on Winston Churchill.”[114]

In a review of _The Time Machine_ for the _New Yorker_ magazine, Brad Leithauser writes, “At the base of Wells’s great visionary exploit is this rational, ultimately scientific attempt to tease out the potential future consequences of present conditions—not as they might arise in a few years, or even decades, but millennia hence, epochs hence. He is world literature’s Great Extrapolator. Like no other fiction writer before him, he embraced “deep time.”[115]


Political views

wrote to the author in 1906, stating "I owe you a great debt", two days before giving an early landmark speech that the state should support its citizens, providing pensions, insurance and child welfare.[116]]]

A socialist, Wells’ contemporary political impact was limited, excluding his fiction's positivist stance on the leaps that could be made by physics towards world peace. Winston Churchill was an avid reader of Wells' books, and after they first met in 1902 they kept in touch until Wells died in 1946.[117] As a junior minister Churchill borrowed lines from Wells for one of his most famous early landmark speeches in 1906, and as Prime Minister the phrase "the gathering storm" — used by Churchill to describe the rise of Nazi Germany — had been written by Wells in _The War of the Worlds_, which depicts an attack on Britain by Martians.[118] Wells's extensive writings on equality and human rights, most notably his most influential work, _The Rights of Man_ (1940), laid the groundwork for the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations shortly after his death.[119][120]

His efforts regarding the League of Nations, on which he collaborated on the project with Leonard Woolf with the booklets _The Idea of a League of Nations_, _Prolegomena to the Study of World Organization_, and _The Way of the League of Nations_, became a disappointment as the organization turned out to be a weak one unable to prevent the Second World War, which itself occurred towards the very end of his life and only increased the pessimistic side of his nature.[121] In his last book _Mind at the End of Its Tether_ (1945), he considered the idea that humanity being replaced by another species might not be a bad idea. He referred to the era between the two World Wars as "The Age of Frustration".[122]


Religious views

Wells wrote in his book _God the Invisible King_ (1917) that his idea of God did not draw upon the traditional religions of the world:

  This book sets out as forcibly and exactly as possible the religious belief of the writer. [Which] is a profound belief in a personal and intimate God. ... Putting the leading idea of this book very roughly, these two antagonistic typical conceptions of God may be best contrasted by speaking of one of them as God-as-Nature or the Creator, and of the other as God-as-Christ or the Redeemer. One is the great Outward God; the other is the Inmost God. The first idea was perhaps developed most highly and completely in the God of Spinoza. It is a conception of God tending to pantheism, to an idea of a comprehensive God as ruling with justice rather than affection, to a conception of aloofness and awestriking worshipfulness. The second idea, which is opposed to this idea of an absolute God, is the God of the human heart. The writer would suggest that the great outline of the theological struggles of that phase of civilisation and world unity which produced Christianity, was a persistent but unsuccessful attempt to get these two different ideas of God into one focus.[123]

Later in the work, he aligns himself with a "renascent or modern religion ... neither atheist nor Buddhist nor Mohammedan nor Christian ... [that] he has found growing up in himself".[124]

Of Christianity, he said: "it is not now true for me. ... Every believing Christian is, I am sure, my spiritual brother ... but if systemically I called myself a Christian I feel that to most men I should imply too much and so tell a lie". Of other world religions, he writes: "All these religions are true for me as Canterbury Cathedral is a true thing and as a Swiss chalet is a true thing. There they are, and they have served a purpose, they have worked. Only they are not true for me to live in them. ... They do not work for me".[125] In _The Fate of Homo Sapiens_ (1939), Wells criticised almost all world religions and philosophies, stating "there is no creed, no way of living left in the world at all, that really meets the needs of the time… When we come to look at them coolly and dispassionately, all the main religions, patriotic, moral and customary systems in which human beings are sheltering today, appear to be in a state of jostling and mutually destructive movement, like the houses and palaces and other buildings of some vast, sprawling city overtaken by a landslide.[126]


Literary influence

'' in 1929]] The science fiction historian John Clute describes Wells as "the most important writer the genre has yet seen", and notes his work has been central to both British and American science fiction.[127] Science fiction author and critic Algis Budrys said Wells "remains the outstanding expositor of both the hope, and the despair, which are embodied in the technology and which are the major facts of life in our world".[128] He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1921, 1932, 1935, and 1946.[129] Wells so influenced real exploration of Mars that an impact crater on the planet was named after him.[130]

In the United Kingdom, Wells's work was a key model for the British “scientific romance”, and other writers in that mode, such as Olaf Stapledon,[131] J. D. Beresford,[132] S. Fowler Wright,[133] and Naomi Mitchison,[134] all drew on Wells's example. Wells was also an important influence on British science fiction of the period after the Second World War, with Arthur C. Clarke[135] and Brian Aldiss[136] expressing strong admiration for Wells's work. Among contemporary British science fiction writers, Stephen Baxter, Christopher Priest and Adam Roberts have all acknowledged Wells's influence on their writing; all three are Vice-Presidents of the H. G. Wells Society. He also had a strong influence on British scientist J. B. S. Haldane, who wrote _Daedalus; or, Science and the Future_ (1924), "The Last Judgement" and "On Being the Right Size" from the essay collection _Possible Worlds_ (1927), and _Biological Possibilities for the Human Species in the Next Ten Thousand Years_ (1963), which are speculations about the future of human evolution and life on other planets. Haldane gave several lectures about these topics which in turn influenced other science fiction writers.[137][138]

In the United States, Hugo Gernsback reprinted most of Wells's work in the pulp magazine _Amazing Stories_, regarding Wells's work as "texts of central importance to the self-conscious new genre".[139] Later American writers such as Ray Bradbury,[140] Isaac Asimov,[141] Frank Herbert[142] and Ursula K. Le Guin[143] all recalled being influenced by Wells's work.

Sinclair Lewis's early novels were strongly influenced by Wells's realistic social novels, such as _The History of Mr Polly_; Lewis would also name his first son Wells after the author.[144]

In an interview with _The Paris Review_, Vladimir Nabokov described Wells as his favourite writer when he was a boy and "a great artist."[145] He went on to cite _The Passionate Friends_, _Ann Veronica_, _The Time Machine_, and _The Country of the Blind_ as superior to anything else written by Wells's British contemporaries. In an apparent allusion to Wells's socialism and political themes, Nabokov said: "His sociological cogitations can be safely ignored, of course, but his romances and fantasies are superb."[146] , commemorating the 150th anniversary of the author's birth]] Jorge Luis Borges wrote many short pieces on Wells in which he demonstrates a deep familiarity with much of Wells's work.[147] While Borges wrote several critical reviews, including a mostly negative review of Wells's film _Things to Come_,[148] he regularly treated Wells as a canonical figure of fantastic literature. Late in his life, Borges included _The Invisible Man_ and _The Time Machine_ in his _Prologue to a Personal Library_,[149] a curated list of 100 great works of literature that he undertook at the behest of the Argentine publishing house Emecé. Canadian author Margaret Atwood read Wells' books,[150] and he also inspired writers of European speculative fiction such as Karel Čapek[151] and Yevgeny Zamyatin.[152]


Representations

Literary

-   The superhuman protagonist of J. D. Beresford's 1911 novel, _The Hampdenshire Wonder_, Victor Stott, was based on Wells.[153]
-   In M. P. Shiel's short story "The Primate of the Rose" (1928), there is an unpleasant womaniser named E. P. Crooks, who was written as a parody of Wells.[154] Wells had attacked Shiel's _Prince Zaleski_ when it was published in 1895, and this was Shiel's response.[155] Wells praised Shiel's _The Purple Cloud_ (1901); in turn Shiel expressed admiration for Wells, referring to him at a speech to the Horsham Rotary Club in 1933 as "my friend Mr. Wells".[156]
-   In C. S. Lewis's novel _That Hideous Strength_ (1945), the character Jules is a caricature of Wells,[157] and much of Lewis's science fiction was written both under the influence of Wells and as an antithesis to his work (or, as he put it, an "exorcism"[158] of the influence it had on him).
-   In Brian Aldiss's novella _The Saliva Tree_ (1966), Wells has a small off screen guest role.[159]
-   In Saul Bellow's novel _Mr. Sammler's Planet_ (1970), Wells is one of several historical figures the protagonist met when he was a young man.[160]
-   In _The Map of Time_ (2008) by Spanish author Félix J. Palma; Wells is one of several historical characters.[161]
-   Wells is one of the two Georges in Paul Levinson's 2013 time-travel novelette, "Ian, George, and George," published in _Analog_ magazine.[162]

Dramatic

-   Rod Taylor portrays Wells[163][164] in the 1960 science fiction film _The Time Machine_ (based on the novel of the same name), in which Wells uses his time machine to try and find his Utopian society.[165]
-   Malcolm McDowell portrays Wells in the 1979 science fiction film _Time After Time_, in which Wells uses a time machine to pursue Jack the Ripper to the present day.[166] In the film, Wells meets "Amy" in the future who then returns to 1893 to become his second wife Amy Catherine Robbins.
-   Wells is portrayed in the 1985 story _Timelash_ from the 22nd season of the BBC science-fiction television series _Doctor Who_. In this story, Herbert, an enthusiastic temporary companion to the Doctor, is revealed to be a young H. G. Wells. The plot is loosely based upon the themes and characters of _The Time Machine_ with references to _The War of the Worlds_, _The Invisible Man_ and _The Island of Doctor Moreau_. The story jokingly suggests that Wells's inspiration for his later novels came from his adventure with the Sixth Doctor.[167]
-   In the BBC2 anthology series _Encounters_ about imagined meetings between historical figures, _Beautiful Lies_, by Paul Pender (15 August 1992) centred on an acrimonious dinner party attended by Wells (Richard Todd), George Orwell (Jon Finch), and William Empson (Patrick Ryecart).
-   The character of Wells also appeared in several episodes of _Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman_ (1993–1997), usually pitted against the time-travelling villain known as Tempus (Lane Davies). Wells's younger self was played by Terry Kiser, and the older Wells was played by Hamilton Camp.
-   In the British TV mini-series _The Infinite Worlds of H. G. Wells_ (2001), several of Wells's short stories are dramatised but are adapted using Wells himself (Tom Ward) as the main protagonist in each story.
-   In the Disney Channel Original Series _Phil of the Future_, which centres on time-travel, the present-day high school that the main characters attend is named "H. G. Wells".[168]
-   In the 2006 television docudrama _H. G. Wells: War with the World_, Wells is played by Michael Sheen.[169]
-   On the science fiction television series _Warehouse 13_ (2009–2014), there is a female version Helena G. Wells. When she appeared she explained that her brother was her front for her writing because a female science fiction author would not be accepted.[170]
-   Comedian Paul F. Tompkins portrays a fictional Wells as the host of _The Dead Authors Podcast_, wherein Wells uses his time machine to bring dead authors (played by other comedians) to the present and interview them.[171][172]
-   H. G. Wells as a young boy appears in the _Legends of Tomorrow_ episode "The Magnificent Eight". In this story, the boy Wells is dying of consumption but is cured by a time-travelling Martin Stein.
-   In the four part series _The Nightmare Worlds of H. G. Wells_ (2016), Wells is played by Ray Winstone.[173]
-   In the 2017 television series version of _Time After Time_, based on the 1979 film, H. G. Wells is portrayed by Freddie Stroma.[174]


Literary papers

In 1954, the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign purchased the H. G. Wells literary papers and correspondence collection.[175] The University's Rare Book & Manuscript Library holds the largest collection of Wells manuscripts, correspondence, first editions and publications in the United States.[176] Among these is an unpublished material and the manuscripts of such works as _The War of the Worlds_ and _The Time Machine_. The collection includes first editions, revisions, translations. The letters contain general family correspondence, communications from publishers, material regarding the Fabian Society, and letters from politicians and public figures, most notably George Bernard Shaw and Joseph Conrad.[177]
