SUE FLEISCHL is a New Zealand chef and business owner.[1][2]


Biography

Fleischl grew up in Napier, in New Zealand's North Island, and decided to become a chef at the age of 11. When she was 15, her father started writing letters to restaurants and hotels in Europe, asking for a position for her. The only reply was from London's Savoy Hotel, so at the age of 17, in 1985, Fleischl flew to London and spent two years at the hotel.[3][4][5] She returned to New Zealand briefly, then moved to Bangkok and then to Melbourne. She started her own catering company in Melbourne, called "Sue-Chef Catering".[6]

In the early 1990s she returned to New Zealand again, and worked with Julie Le Clerc in her cafe in Kingsland, Auckland.[7] In 1995 she started The Great Catering Company with three corporate clients.[8] She has grown the multi-million dollar company to employ 18 staff. In 2012 she opened Abbeville Estate, near Auckland Airport, and provides catering there for wedding parties and receptions.[9][10]

In 2018 Fleischl appeared as a judge on the New Zealand television series _The Great Kiwi Bake Off._

Awards and recognition

In 2016, Fleischl was inducted into the New Zealand Restaurant Association Hall of Fame in recognition of her contribution and leadership in the hospitality sector.[11] The Great Catering Company has twice won the Lewisham Caterer of the Year Award.[12]
