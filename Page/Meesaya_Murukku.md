Plot

Coimbatore-based Aadhi and Jeeva have been close friends since childhood. Aadhi's father Ramachandran is very supportive of his interests in music. Aadhi joins engineering and falls for his college mate, Nila who was his childhood friend. Nila is from an affluent family, and her parents are against her love, and they threaten Aadhi's parents. Post completion of college, Nila's parents keep her locked at home, preventing any communication with Aadhi.

Aadhi is well known in college for his Tamil raps, and he owns a YouTube page "Hiphop Tamizha". After graduating, Aadhi expresses his interest to move to Chennai and become an independent musician to his father, for which he opposes. Aadhi convinces his father, promising that he will return within a year in case if he cannot succeed. Aadhi reaches Chennai and tries hard for an opportunity, but all goes in vain. A year passes by, and Aadhi decides to return to Coimbatore. On the last day, Aadhi meets RJ Ma Ka Pa Anand of the FM station Radio Mirchi, and he gives a chance to perform the song "Club La Mabbu La" in his show, following which Aadhi returns to Coimbatore.

As per his father's advice, Aadhi enrolls for an MBA degree in Chennai. Suddenly, he finds that "Club Le Mabbu Le" has gone viral in social media, which drew lots of fan followers. Aadhi's hope is revived, and he decides to continue looking for an opportunity in the music industry and also promises his father that he will complete his post-graduation.

Aadhi gets shocked knowing that Nila's parents have fixed a wedding for her. Aadhi meets Nila and requests to wait for a year, for which Nila does not agree, replying that she had already waited for a year. Aadhi gets heartbroken and leaves to Chennai.

Production

Development

In August 2013, Aadhi, the lead singer of Hiphop Tamizha (HHT) revealed that he had been signed as lead for a full-length feature film based on HHT which was expected to released by the mid of 2014. He also stated that there was a search for a suitable director to helm the spec script.[3] During October 2016, a 90–second teaser was released on HHT's official YouTube channel,[4] as news emerged that the film being titled as "_Meesaya Murukku_" produced by N. Ramasamy and Hema Rukmani for Thenandal Studio Limited, who green lit the project within five minutes of his narration and insisted him to perform as lead actor, after being impressed with his video song on Jallikattu, "_Takkaru Takkaru_".[5] Apart from debuting as actor in a full-length role, Adhi also serves as writer and director besides composing the score and writing lyrics for the film.[6] In the press meet before release of the film, Sundar C confirmed that it was partly biographical of Adhi's life.[7] The film's title is derived from a phrase Adhi's father would often tell his son: "_Thotalum jeythalum, meesaya murukku_" (win or lose, always twirl your moustache and hold your head high).[8]

Adhi has stated that while _Meesaya Murukku_ is "predominantly based on real incidents", such as his five friends from the film and the character Sudhakaran being based on real people, certain liberties were taken to make the film commercially viable.[9] The film depicts Adhi and Jeeva as having been childhood friends,[10] whereas in reality, the duo met via Orkut in 2005, when they were teenagers.[11]

Casting

As revealed in 2013, Adhi continued to be lead actor and chose Aathmika to pair for him, after coming across her Facebook profile.[12] The film also features Vivek and Vijayalakshmi in supporting roles, where the former plays the father of Adhi's character.[13][14][15] The film features a mostly new cast and crew as per Adhi's wishes, with being Vivek the only established actor.[16]

Filming

Though pre-production began in August 2013,[17] the film, as of October 2016, was reported to have completed 45 days of shoot with two songs left to be shot.[18] Filming ended by early November 2016.[19]


Music

Adhi composed the music of the film. A promotional song, "Sait Ji", was released in late 2016.[20] Although it became a viral hit on YouTube, Sundar C. received a legal notice from Ashok G Lodha of Shri All India Shwetamber Sthanakwasi Jain Conference. Lodha objected to the words "Sait Ji", meaning "affluent trader", and demanded that they be removed from the song, feeling it was "a classic example of abuse of the (Jain) community in the name of creativity and art." Sundar C obliged, and had the words removed not only from the song, but also from the finished film,[21] and the word Saitji was replaced by Great ji.[22] The YouTube video itself was deleted later.[23][24]


Release and reception

_Meesaya Murukku_ was released on 21 July 2017 to positive reviews.[25] Sify stated, "_Meesaya Murukku_ is a decent debut directorial and heroic outing from Adhi, the film clicks mainly because of the real life connect.".[26] The film grossed 12.0 million from 147 shows during its first week.[27]


Remake

The film was remade in Kannada as _pspk_ (2019).[28]
