ABZIRI also known variously as ABZIRITANUS and ABDIRITANUS was a Roman and Byzantine era _oppidum_ (town) in Africa Proconsularis, Roman North Africa. The town is tentatively identified with ruins near Oudna, in Cartagine, Tunisia.[1]


History

The town was mentioned by Pliny[2] and was one of _the 30 oppida libera_ in Africa Proconsularis. The town appears to be a native Berber town associated with the nearby Roman colony of Uthina.


Bishopric

The town was the seat of an ancient Catholic bishopric[3] which functioned till the end of the 7th century and the arrival of Islamic Armies. The diocese was refounded in name in 1933, and exists today as a titular see in the Roman Catholic Church.
