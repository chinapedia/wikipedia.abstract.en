MINIMUM is an unincorporated community in southeastern Iron County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]

The community lies on the banks of Crane Pond Creek, just north of that stream's confluence with Sulphur Creek. It is located at the intersection of Missouri Route C and County Road 134. The town of Annapolis, on Missouri Route 49, is approximately six miles to the west.[2]


History

A post office called Minimum was established in 1904, and remained in operation until 1955.[3] The name "Minimum" is said to be derived from the first name of Minnie Farr, the wife of an early postmaster.[4]
