History

In September 2010, Rami Levy became the fourth company in Israel to receive a mobile virtual network operator license from the Israel Ministry of Communications.[1] The company previously announced in a 2010 statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange that upon receiving this license, it would open a new subsidiary, Rami Levy Hashikma Marketing Communications Ltd., and sell advanced mobile telephone services in its supermarkets.[2]

In February 2011 Rami Levy signed an agreement with the mobile network provider Pelephone, allowing the supermarket chain to use Pelephone's infrastructure to provide cellular phone services.[3] In December 2011 Rami Levy Communications went live with the opening of two branches in Jerusalem.[4] Rami Levy Communications is the first MVNO to buy blocks of minutes from other cellular companies and resell them to consumers for less than the providing company charges.
