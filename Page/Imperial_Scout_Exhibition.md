In July 1913, the first INTERNATIONAL SCOUT RALLY IN BIRMINGHAM also known as the “Imperial Scout Exhibition” was an historic gathering of Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts held in Perry Hall Park, attended by about 30,000 Scouts.[1]

The 1st Shanghai Troop of Baden-Powell Scouts was able to make a presence at the “Imperial Scout Exhibition” in Birmingham, July 1913, as the “Dragon Troop” of Shanghai.

The rally became an annual event held in Handsworth Park for many years when Scouts from a wide area congregated and paraded.
