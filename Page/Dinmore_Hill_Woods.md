DINMORE HILL WOODS is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest in Herefordshire, England.[1] It is an extensive area of mixed native broadleaved woodlands overlying rocks of the Old Red Sandstone. It forms one of the largest continuous blocks of deciduous woodland in this part of Herefordshire. The soils which range from acid to alkaline and front wet to dry gives rise to a diverse woodland structure.

Most of the upper plateau is dominated by sessile oak (_Quercus petraea_) woodland. In some areas this is associated with field maple (_Acer campestre_) and in others with ash (_Fraxinus excelsior_). Other species include hazel (_Corylus avellana_) and the locally rare wild service tree (_Sorbus torminalis_). In the woodland on the slopes, ash tends to become more dominant, often in association with birch (_Betula pendula_) on the drier areas and alder (_Alnus glutinosa_) in the wetter areas. In the south eastern part of the site is an extensive area of wild cherry (_Prunus avium_) and ash with a hawthorn (_Crataegus monogyna_) and hazel understorey.

The variety of soils give rise to a similarly diverse ground flora which includes bluebell (_Hyacinthoides non-scripta_), great butterfly orchid (_Platanthera chlorantha_) and common spotted-orchid (_Dactylorhiza fuchsii_), stinking iris (_Iris foetidissima_) and spurge laurel (_Daphne laureola_). The woods have a rich fauna which includes fallow deer (_Dama dama_). They provide an excellent habitat for birds that breed in woodland such as buzzard (_Buteo buteo_), great spotted woodpecker (_Dendrocopos major_) and tree creeper (_Certhia familiaris_).
