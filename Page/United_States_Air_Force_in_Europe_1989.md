At the end of the Cold War elements of the United States Air Force in Europe consisted of the following units, which in case of war with the Warsaw Pact would have been assigned to NATO.

This article list all United States Air Force units based in Europe on 30 June 1989 and, where required, lists changes that occurred during 1989. The primary source for this listing of units is O.W. Dragoner's _United States Air Force 1989_, with additions and amendments from the official fact sheets of the Air Force Historical Research Agency. Where the two sources disagree, AFHRA data has been used.


United States Air Forces in Europe

United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) was a major command of the U.S. Air Force based at Ramstein Air Base in West Germany. In 1989 the commanded had a strength of 60,471 men (6,876 officers and 53,595 enlisted), which were supported by 9,982 civilian contractors and employees. This does not include the personnel of other major commands (i.e. Strategic Air Command, Military Airlift Command, Electronic Security Command, etc.) that operated in Europe too.[1]

The Commander in Chief of USAFE double-hatted as NATO's Commander Allied Air Forces Central Europe (COMAAFCE). The Vice Commander in Chief of USAFE was based along with the commander in Germany, while the Deputy Commander in Chief USAFE was based in Naples at NATO's AFSOUTH Headquarters, where he double hatted as Commander Allied Air Forces, Southern Europe (COMAIRSOUTH).

Twenty-Third Air Force

At the beginning of 1989 the US Air Force's special forces and air rescue units were under command of Twenty-Third Air Force. As Twenty-Third Air Force's two types of units did not fit well together the Air Force decided to split it in two. In August 1989 Search and Rescue (SAR) units were moved to the newly established Air Rescue Service, which came under direct command of MAC, while special forces remained under Twenty-Third Air Force, which was redesignated Air Force Special Operations Command and elevated to major command on 22 May 1990.[32][33] Here below only units of Twenty-Third Air Force are listed which were based in Europe.
