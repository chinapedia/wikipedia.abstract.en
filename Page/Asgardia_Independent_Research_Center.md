ASGARDIA INDEPENDENT RESEARCH CENTER GMBH, formerly the AEROSPACE INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH CENTER (AIRC), ) is an interdisciplinary research institute. It was established in 2013 by Igor Ashurbeyli.


History

In 2014, AIRC began publication of an international space journal, ROOM, of which Ashurbeyli is the editor-in-chief.[1] On February 5, 2016, Ashurbeyli was awarded the UNESCO Medal for contributions to the development of nanoscience and nanotechnologies during a ceremony held at UNESCO headquarters, Paris.[2] '''AIRC AAS '''is the only institute in Austria whose activity is fully dedicated to the research of the Solar System, extraterrestrial life and the Earth using space technology and satellite techniques.

Since 2013 the AIRC staff constructed, developed and prepared for launch over 30 instruments and participated in the experiments in 15 space missions, for example: ESA's mission _Mars Express_, _Rosetta_ (mission to a comet), _Venus Express_, _BepiColombo_ (mission to Mercury) and CNES' DEMETER and TARANIS missions. AIRC has also collaborated with NASA for the _IBEX_ mission.

Since 2015 the AIRC is establishing a close collaboration with Asgardia, the first space program planning to found a state fully located in space.[3][4][5] The idea is to create a legal framework, not tied to any existing nation, for the peaceful exploration in space.[6]

In July 2018 Aerospace International Research Center was renamed to Asgardia Independent Research Center GmbH.


Facilities

The Aerospace International Research Center facilities are located in Vienna.
