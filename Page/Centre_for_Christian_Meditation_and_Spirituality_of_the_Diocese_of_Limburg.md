The CENTRE FOR CHRISTIAN MEDITATION AND SPIRITUALITY (German: _ZENTRUM FÜR CHRISTLICHE MEDITATION UND SPIRITUALITÄT_) is an institution of the Diocese of Limburg, Germany. It is based at the Holy Cross Church in Frankfurt-Bornheim and is dedicated to services, contemplation, meditation, retreats, counseling, and other events such as concerts.

On 15 January he signed the charter of foundation for the theme church Holy Cross – Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality in Frankfurt-Bornheim. The charter of foundation came into effect on 1 July 2007.[2]

The Holy Cross Church accommodates one of five profile churches of the Diocese of Limburg. The others are the Centre for Mourning Counselling in St. Michael in Frankfurt-Nordend and the three youth churches: Crossover in St. Hildegard in Limburg an der Lahn, Jona in St. Bonifatius in Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen, and Kana in Maria-Hilf in Wiesbaden-Nordost. Like the church St. Michael, the Holy Cross Church is a branch church of the parish St. Josef Frankfurt. The centre is a pastoral institution of the diocese[3] and is subordinated to the head of department of the Episcopalian chair (Dr. Hildegard Wustmans).[4] The centre was directed from 2007 until July 2018 by the Franciscan Helmut Schlegel OFM,[5] where he worked until June 2019 as a retreat and meditation leader and priestly co-worker. Since November 2018 the centre is directed by the theologist Samuel Stricker guide[6] who works with a team of contributors, for example from the order of Medical Missionary Sisters.[7]


Program

Although the offerings of the centre reflect the tenets of Christianity, the target audience includes people of all religious denominations, worldviews, and cultures. The center offers different kinds of church services, such as expressionist dance, meditation courses, contemplative prayer, Zen-meditation courses, days of reflection, spiritual exercises, retreats, lectures by guest speakers such as Anselm Grün,[8] meditations with the Sōtō-Zen-priest and veteran of the Vietnam War Claude AnShin Thomas,[9] and many other kinds of events. The team[10] publishes a new program annually.[11]

Event series include days of exercises of Christian mysticism, meditative singing, meditative archery, spiritual guided city tours in which topics by Frankfurt tourist guides are joined with spiritual topics or pilgrim hikes with a picnic and devotions.[12] One-time events are also part of the program, for example, the _Tram of Silence_ tram rides on an historic railcar of the Frankfurt tramway system, including elements such as silence with short, thought-provoking impulses to the senses of seeing, hearing, feeling, and smelling.[13]

The dialogue between the cultures and major religious groups concerning meditation and spirituality is another important aspect of the work of the centre. These include panel discussions with representatives of Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity about meditation, with personal field reports from the different religions. Other examples are courses in Yoga and Yoga nidra, or dance performances of an Indian Jesuit padre who figures elements of traditional meditative dances such as Bharatanatyam from Hinduism as a kind of prayer to God.[14]

For the last few years, a Cretan-style labyrinth consisting of 2,500 tealights has been formed on the third Saturday of Advent before the Gaudete Sunday. This labyrinth is part of the service and can be walked through by visitors.[15][16]

During the Frankfurt festival of light in 2014 the team members of the centre offered a meditation consisting of light, words, music, and sound in cooperation with the Jona youth church in the Frankfurt Cathedral.[17]

Concert performances at the center have included _A German Requiem_ by Johannes Brahms and meditative music from the Middle Ages by Hildegard of Bingen, Peter Abelard, and Rabanus Maurus.[18]


Interior

The interior of the church was modified for the new purpose, completed in 2010. The fixed pews were removed and replaced by folding chairs which enabled a more flexible use. While the former main altar is normally not used, a smaller wooden altar has been added, typically surrounded by circles of folding chairs. Stairlifts and ramps for wheelchairs were installed. The former crypt and the rooms of the former clergy house were transformed to be used for meditation. In the crypt, the floor was changed to wood, and the meditation area was enclosed by textile panels made from linen.[19]


Church building and parish

The Centre of Christian Meditation and Spirituality is located in the parish area of the Catholic parish St. Josef Frankfurt am Main, which was founded as a "parish of a new type" on 1 January 2015. In the new greater parish area there are four churches located as "church places" and two churches as "theme churches". One of the two theme churches is the Holy Cross Church, which headquarters the meditation centre and is used for church services and centre events. The buildings are administrated by the Catholic Church of the city of Frankfurt am Main. There is an active collaboration with the parish of St. Josef Frankfurt am Main. During the restoration period of the church St. Leonhard in the Frankfurt Altstadt, beginning on 7 May 2011, the church services of the International English-speaking Catholic parishes of the Frankfurt area have taken place in the Holy Cross Church.[20]


Transport connections

The Holy Cross Church is one-minute walking distance from the _Ernst-May-Platz_ tram stop of the tramline 14 of the Frankfurt tramway, and the Stadtbahn station _Eissporthalle/Festplatz_ of the line U7 of the Frankfurt light rail system. Also not far away is the motorway exit _Frankfurt-Ost_ of the Federal Motorway 661.


Camino de Santiago

Beneath the Bornheim slope to the east of the meditation centre runs a branch of the German Camino de Santiago (Way of St. James).[21] The route is based on the ancient trade route from Leipzig to Frankfurt am Main (_Des Reiches Straße_). The way starts in the bishop city Fulda and continues through Schlüchtern, Steinau an der Straße, Bad Soden-Salmünster, Gelnhausen, Langenselbold, Erlensee, and Bruchköbel. It belongs to the network of main pilgrimage routes to the grave of St. James in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. This branch, which is 116 km long, passes the Holy Cross Church and leads through the Ostpark, and then passes the Seat of the European Central Bank at the former Großmarkthalle (Wholesale Market Hall) on its route to the Main River and the inner city of Frankfurt am Main. It also passes the Eiserner Steg (an iron footbridge) and continues to Mainz and Trier.[22]
