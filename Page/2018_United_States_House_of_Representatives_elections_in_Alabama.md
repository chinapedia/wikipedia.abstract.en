The 2018 UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ELECTIONS IN ALABAMA were held on November 6, 2018, to elect the seven U.S. Representatives from the state of Alabama, one from each of the state's seven congressional districts. The elections coincided with other elections to the House of Representatives, as well as elections to the United States Senate and various state and local elections. The primaries were held on June 5, with all choosing a nominee except the Republican primary in the 2nd district, which went to a July 17 runoff.[1] The 2018 general election saw no change in Alabama's representation, remaining at a 6-1 GOP advantage, even though Democrats won over 40% of the statewide vote.
