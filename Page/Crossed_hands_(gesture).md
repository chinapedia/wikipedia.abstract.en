The CROSSED HANDS gesture is a hand signal that denotes Albania in International Sign.[1] Known as DUART E KRYQÃ‹ZUARA (crossed hands) in Albanian, it is sometimes referred to as the "eagle gesture" and is a symbol used by ethnic Albanians in Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, and other regions of the world where Albanians live. It is meant to visually illustrate the double-headed eagle, the main image on the Albanian flag.[2] The symbolism of the double-headed eagle among Albanians encapsulates their ethnicity and flag, viewing it as a symbol that represents ethnic-Albanian people across the globe.[3]

This gesture is often performed by players of the Albania national football team to celebrate a goal or at the end of a victorious game.[4] It has also been used by some ethnic Albanians playing for other teams.[5]


Controversy

This gesture resembling the double-headed eagle on the Albanian flag is sometimes viewed as alluding to the Greater Albania irredentist concept.[6][7][8]

2018 FIFA World Cup

In the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Albanian Kosovan-born Swiss players Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka, both ethnic Albanians, performed the gesture in a match against Serbia and were subsequently fined by FIFA "for unsporting behaviour contrary to the principles of fair-play".[9][10][11]
