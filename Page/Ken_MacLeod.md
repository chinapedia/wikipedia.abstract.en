Ken_&_Carol_MacLeod,_Boskone_43,_2006.jpg KENNETH MACRAE MACLEOD (born 2 August 1954) is a Scottish science fiction writer.


Biography

MacLeod was born in Stornoway, Scotland on 2 August 1954.[1] He graduated from Glasgow University with a degree in zoology and has worked as a computer programmer and written a masters thesis on biomechanics.[2] He was a Trotskyist activist in the 1970s and early 1980s[3] and is married and has two children.[4] He lived in South Queensferry near Edinburgh before moving to Gourock, on the Firth of Clyde, in June 2017.[5]

MacLeod is opposed to Scottish independence.[6]


Writing

He is part of a group of British science fiction writers who specialise in hard science fiction and space opera. His contemporaries include Stephen Baxter, Iain M. Banks, Paul J. McAuley, Alastair Reynolds, Adam Roberts, Charles Stross, Richard Morgan, and Liz Williams.

His science fiction novels often explore socialist, communist, and anarchist political ideas, especially Trotskyism and anarcho-capitalism (or extreme economic libertarianism). Technical themes encompass singularities, divergent human cultural evolution, and post-human cyborg-resurrection. MacLeod's general outlook can be best described as techno-utopian socialist,[7][8] though unlike a majority of techno-utopians, he has expressed great scepticism over the possibility and especially over the desirability of strong AI.[9]

He is known for his constant in-joking and punning on the intersection between socialist ideologies and computer programming, as well as other fields. For example, his chapter titles such as "Trusted Third Parties" or "Revolutionary Platform" usually have double (or multiple) meanings. A future programmers union is called "Information Workers of the World Wide Web", or the _Webblies_, a reference to the Industrial Workers of the World, who are nicknamed the _Wobblies_. The Webblies idea formed a central part of the novel _For the Win_ by Cory Doctorow and MacLeod is acknowledged as coining the term.[10] Doctorow and Charles Stross also used one of MacLeod's references to the singularity as "the rapture for nerds" as the title for their collaborative novel _Rapture of the Nerds._ (Although MacLeod denies coining the phrase.[11]) There are also many references to, or puns on, zoology and palaeontology. For example, in _The Stone Canal_ the title of the book, and many places described in it, are named after anatomical features of marine invertebrates such as starfish.

-   _Descent_ (2014):[32] "My genre model for Descent was bloke-lit – that's basically first-person, self-serving, rueful confessional by a youngish man looking back on youthful stupidities... ... Descent is about flying saucers, hidden races, and Antonio Gramsci's concept of passive revolution, all set in a tale of Scottish middle class family life in and after the Great Depression of the 21st Century. Almost mainstream fiction, really."[33]
