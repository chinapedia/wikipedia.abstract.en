_THE LONGEST MEOW_ is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Bobby Bare Jr. The album, released on September 26, 2006, came two years after his previous studio album _From the End of Your Leash_, and continues Bare's eccentric and experimental style.[1] The 11-track album[2] was recorded during one 11-hour session in Nashville on March 26, 2006 with musicians from My Morning Jacket, Lambchop, Trail of Dead, and Clem Snide.[3] The album primarily is a mixture of alternative country and indie rock, though also employs elements from other genres. The reception from critics was generally positive, with reviewers admiring Bare for his unconventional approach to music, though still noting that parts of the album seemed rushed as a result of time constraints.[4][5]
