Hyperbola_(PSF).svg with both halves of a double cone. The plane does not have to be parallel to the axis of the cone; the hyperbola will be symmetrical in any case.|alt=The image shows a double cone in which a geometrical plane has sliced off parts of the top and bottom half; the boundary curve of the slice on the cone is the hyperbola. A double cone consists of two cones stacked point-to-point and sharing the same axis of rotation; it may be generated by rotating a line about an axis that passes through a point of the line.]] Hyperbel-def-ass-e.svg In mathematics, a HYPERBOLA (plural _hyperbolas_ or _hyperbolae_) is a type of smooth curve lying in a plane, defined by its geometric properties or by equations for which it is the solution set. A hyperbola has two pieces, called connected components or branches, that are mirror images of each other and resemble two infinite bows. The hyperbola is one of the three kinds of conic section, formed by the intersection of a plane and a double cone. (The other conic sections are the parabola and the ellipse. A circle is a special case of an ellipse.) If the plane intersects both halves of the double cone but does not pass through the apex of the cones, then the conic is a hyperbola.

Hyperbolas arise in many ways:

-   as the curve representing the function f(x) = 1/x in the Cartesian plane,[1]
-   as the path followed by the shadow of the tip of a sundial,
-   as the shape of an open orbit (as distinct from a closed elliptical orbit), such as the orbit of a spacecraft during a gravity assisted swing-by of a planet or more generally any spacecraft exceeding the escape velocity of the nearest planet,
-   as the path of a single-apparition comet (one travelling too fast ever to return to the solar system),
-   as the scattering trajectory of a subatomic particle (acted on by repulsive instead of attractive forces but the principle is the same),
-   in radio navigation, when the difference between distances to two points, but not the distances themselves, can be determined,

and so on.

Each branch of the hyperbola has two arms which become straighter (lower curvature) further out from the center of the hyperbola. Diagonally opposite arms, one from each branch, tend in the limit to a common line, called the asymptote of those two arms. So there are two asymptotes, whose intersection is at the center of symmetry of the hyperbola, which can be thought of as the mirror point about which each branch reflects to form the other branch. In the case of the curve f(x) = 1/x the asymptotes are the two coordinate axes.[2]

Hyperbolas share many of the ellipses' analytical properties such as eccentricity, focus, and directrix. Typically the correspondence can be made with nothing more than a change of sign in some term. Many other mathematical objects have their origin in the hyperbola, such as hyperbolic paraboloids (saddle surfaces), hyperboloids ("wastebaskets"), hyperbolic geometry (Lobachevsky's celebrated non-Euclidean geometry), hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh, etc.), and gyrovector spaces (a geometry proposed for use in both relativity and quantum mechanics which is not Euclidean).


Etymology and history

The word "hyperbola" derives from the Greek , meaning "over-thrown" or "excessive", from which the English term hyperbole also derives. Hyperbolae were discovered by Menaechmus in his investigations of the problem of doubling the cube, but were then called sections of obtuse cones.[3] The term hyperbola is believed to have been coined by Apollonius of Perga (c. 262–c. 190 BC) in his definitive work on the conic sections, the _Conics_.[4] The names of the other two general conic sections, the ellipse and the parabola, derive from the corresponding Greek words for "deficient" and "applied"; all three names are borrowed from earlier Pythagorean terminology which referred to a comparison of the side of rectangles of fixed area with a given line segment. The rectangle could be "applied" to the segment (meaning, have an equal length), be shorter than the segment or exceed the segment.[5]


Definition of a hyperbola as locus of points

Hyperbel-def-e.svg Hyperbel-def-dc.svg A hyperbola can be defined geometrically as a set of points (locus of points) in the Euclidean plane:

    A HYPERBOLA is a set of points, such that for any point P of the set, the absolute difference of the distances |PF₁|, |PF₂| to two fixed points F₁, F₂ (the _foci_), is constant, usually denoted by 2a, a > 0 :[6]

_H_ = {_P_ ∣ ||_P__F_₂| − |_P__F_₁|| = 2_a_} .

The midpoint M of the line segment joining the foci is called the _center_ of the hyperbola.[7] The line through the foci is called the _major axis_. It contains the _vertices_ V₁, V₂, which have distance a to the center. The distance c of the foci to the center is called the _focal distance_ or _linear eccentricity_. The quotient $\tfrac c a$ is the _eccentricity_ e.

The equation ||PF₂| − |PF₁|| = 2a can be viewed in a different way (see diagram):
If c₂ is the circle with midpoint F₂ and radius 2a, then the distance of a point P of the right branch to the circle c₂ equals the distance to the focus F₁:

|_P__F_₁| = |_P__c_₂|.
c₂ is called the _circular directrix_ (related to focus F₂) of the hyperbola.[8][9] In order to get the left branch of the hyperbola, one has to use the circular directrix related to F₁. This property should not be confused with the definition of a hyperbola with help of a directrix (line) below.


Hyperbola in Cartesian coordinates

Equation

If Cartesian coordinates are introduced such that the origin is the center of the hyperbola and the _x_-axis is the major axis, then the hyperbola is called _east-west-opening_ and

    the _foci_ are the points F₁ = (c, 0), F₂ = ( − c, 0),[10]
    the _vertices_ are V₁ = (a, 0), V₂ = ( − a, 0).[11]

For an arbitrary point (x, y) the distance to the focus (c, 0) is $\sqrt{ (x-c)^2 + y^2 }$ and to the second focus $\sqrt{ (x+c)^2 + y^2 }$. Hence the point (x, y) is on the hyperbola if the following condition is fulfilled

$$\sqrt{(x-c)^2 + y^2} - \sqrt{(x+c)^2 + y^2} = \pm 2a \ .$$
Remove the square roots by suitable squarings and use the relation b² = c² − a² to obtain the equation of the hyperbola:

$$\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}= 1 \ .$$

This equation is called the _canonical form_ of a hyperbola, because any hyperbola, regardless of its orientation relative to the Cartesian axes and regardless of the location of its center, can be transformed to this form by a change of variables, giving a hyperbola that is congruent to the original (see below).

The axes of symmetry or _principal axes_ are the _transverse axis_ (containing the segment of length 2_a_ with endpoints at the vertices) and the _conjugate axis_ (containing the segment of length 2_b_ perpendicular to the transverse axis and with midpoint at the hyperbola's center).[12] As opposed to an ellipse, a hyperbola has only two vertices: (a, 0), ( − a, 0). The two points (0, b), (0,  − b) on the conjugate axis are _not_ on the hyperbola.

It follows from the equation that the hyperbola is _symmetric_ with respect to both of the coordinate axes and hence symmetric with respect to the origin.

Eccentricity

For a hyperbola in the above canonical form, the eccentricity is given by

$$e=\sqrt{1+\frac{b^2}{a^2}}.$$

Two hyperbolas are geometrically similar to each other – meaning that they have the same shape, so that one can be transformed into the other by rigid left and right movements, rotation, taking a mirror image, and scaling (magnification) – if and only if they have the same eccentricity.

Asymptotes

Hyperbel-param-e.svg Hyperbola-3prop.svg Solving the equation (above) of the hyperbola for y yields

$$y=\pm\frac{b}{a}\sqrt{x^2-a^2}.$$
It follows from this that the hyperbola approaches the two lines

$$y=\pm \frac{b}{a}x$$
for large values of |x|. These two lines intersect at the center (origin) and are called _asymptotes_ of the hyperbola $\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}= 1 \ .$[13]

With help of the figure one can see that

$${\color{blue}{(1)}}$$
The _distance from a focus to either asymptote_ is b (the semi-minor axis).

From the Hesse normal form $\tfrac{bx\pm ay}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}=0$ of the asymptotes and the equation of the hyperbola one gets:[14]

$${\color{magenta}{(2)}}$$
The _product of the distances from a point on the hyperbola to both the asymptotes_ is the constant $\tfrac{a^2b^2}{a^2+b^2}\ ,$ which can also be written in terms of the eccentricity _e_ as $\left( \tfrac{b}{e}\right) ^2.$

From the equation $y=\pm\frac{b}{a}\sqrt{x^2-a^2}$ of the hyperbola (above) one can derive:

$${\color{green}{(3)}}$$
The _product of the slopes of lines from a point P to the two vertices_ is the constant b²/a² .

In addition, from (2) above it can be shown that[15]

$${\color{red}{(4)}}$$
_The product of the distances from a point on the hyperbola to the asymptotes along lines parallel to the asymptotes_ is the constant $\tfrac{a^2+b^2}{4}.$

Semi-latus rectum

The length of the chord through one of the foci, perpendicular to the major axis of the hyperbola, is called the _latus rectum_. One half of it is the _semi-latus rectum_ p. A calculation shows

$$p = \frac{b^2}a.$$
The semi-latus rectum p may also be viewed as the ''radius of curvature '' of the osculating circles at the vertices.

Tangent

The simplest way to determine the equation of the tangent at a point (x₀, y₀) is to implicitly differentiate the equation $\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}= 1$ of the hyperbola. Denoting _dy/dx_ as _y′_, this produces

$$\frac{2x}{a^2}-\frac{2yy'}{b^2}= 0 \ \Rightarrow \ y'=\frac{x}{y}\frac{b^2}{a^2}\ \Rightarrow \ y=\frac{x_0}{y_0}\frac{b^2}{a^2}(x-x_0) +y_0.$$
With respect to $\tfrac{x_0^2}{a^2}-\tfrac{y_0^2}{b^2}= 1$, the equation of the tangent at point (x₀, y₀) is

$$\frac{x_0}{a^2}x-\frac{y_0}{b^2}y = 1.$$

A particular tangent line distinguishes the hyperbola from the other conic sections.[16] Let _f_ be the distance from the vertex _V_ (on both the hyperbola and its axis through the two foci) to the nearer focus. Then the distance, along a line perpendicular to that axis, from that focus to a point P on the hyperbola is greater than 2_f_. The tangent to the hyperbola at P intersects that axis at point Q at an angle ∠PQV of greater than 45°.

Rectangular hyperbola

In the case a = b the hyperbola is called _rectangular_ (or _equilateral_), because its asymptotes intersect rectangularly (that is, are perpendicular). For this case, the linear eccentricity is $c=\sqrt{2}a$, the eccentricity $e=\sqrt{2}$ and the semi-latus rectum p = a.

Parametric representation with hyperbolic sine/cosine

Using the hyperbolic sine and cosine functions cosh , sinh , a parametric representation of the hyperbola $\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}= 1$ can be obtained, which is similar to the parametric representation of an ellipse:

$$(\pm a \cosh t, b \sinh t),\, t \in \R \ ,$$
which satisfies the Cartesian equation because cosh²t − sinh²t = 1.

Further parametric representations are given in the section Parametric equations below.

Drini-conjugatehyperbolas.svg in blue and its conjugate hyperbola in green, sharing the same red asymptotes.]]

Conjugate hyperbola

Exchange x and y to obtain the equation of the CONJUGATE HYPERBOLA (see diagram):

$$\frac{y^2}{a^2}-\frac{x^2}{b^2}= 1 \ ,$$
also written as

$$\frac{x^2}{b^2}-\frac{y^2}{a^2}= -1 \ .$$


Hyperbolic functions

Hyperbolic_functions-2.svg x² − y² = 1 in the point (cosh  a, sinh  a), where a is twice the area between the ray, the hyperbola, and the x-axis. For points on the hyperbola below the x-axis, the area is considered negative.]]

Just as the trigonometric functions are defined in terms of the unit circle, so also the hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of the unit hyperbola, as shown in this diagram.

Let a be twice the area between the x axis and a ray through the origin intersecting the unit hyperbola and define b = cosh (a) as the horizontal coordinate of the intersection point. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem,

$$\frac{a}{2}=\frac{b\sqrt{b^{2}-1}}{2}-\displaystyle\int_1^b \sqrt{x^{2}-1} \, \mathrm dx=\frac{b\sqrt{b^{2}-1}}{2}-\frac{b\sqrt{b^{2}-1}-\ln \left(b+\sqrt{b^{2}-1}\right)}{2},$$
which simplifies to

$$a=\ln \left(b+\sqrt{b^{2}-1}\right).$$
Solving for b yields the exponential form of the hyperbolic cosine:

$$x=b=\cosh a=\frac{e^{a}+e^{-a}}{2}.$$
By defining y as sinh a, from x² − y² = 1 one gets

$$\sinh a=\sqrt{\cosh ^{2}a-1}.$$
This implies the exponential form of the hyperbolic sine (h is the vertical coordinate of the intersection point):

$$y=h=\sinh a=\frac{e^{a}-e^{-a}}{2}.$$
Other hyperbolic functions are defined according to the hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine, so for example

$$\operatorname{tanh}a=\frac{\sinh a}{\cosh a}=\frac{e^{2a}-1}{e^{2a}+1}.$$

The area hyperbolic cosine is defined as follows:

$$a=\operatorname{arcosh}b=\ln \left(b+\sqrt{b^{2}-1}\right).$$
Solving for a in the hyperbolic sine equation yields the area hyperbolic sine:

$$a=\operatorname{arsinh}h=\ln \left(h+\sqrt{h^{2}+1}\right).$$

== Hyperbola with equation _y_ = _A_/_x_ == Hyperbel-gs-hl.svg Three rectangular hyperbolas y = A/x with the coordinate axes as asymptotes
red: _A_ = 1; magenta: _A_ = 4; blue: _A_ = 9 If the _xy_-coordinate system is rotated about the origin by the angle  − 45^(∘) and new coordinates ξ, η are assigned, then $x=\tfrac{\xi+\eta}{\sqrt{2}},\; y=\tfrac{-\xi+\eta}{\sqrt{2}}$.
The rectangular hyperbola $\tfrac{x^2-y^2}{a^2}=1$ (whose semi-axes are equal) has the new equation $\tfrac{2\xi\eta}{a^2}=1$. Solving for η yields $\eta=\tfrac{a^2/2}{\xi} \ .$

Thus, in an _xy_-coordinate system the graph of a function $f: x\mapsto \tfrac{A}{x},\; A>0\; ,$ with equation

$$y=\frac{A}{x}\;, A>0\; ,$$
is a _rectangular hyperbola_ entirely in the first and third quadrants with

-   the coordinate axes as _asymptotes_,
-   the line y = x as _major axis_ ,
-   the _center_ (0, 0) and the _semi-axis_ $a=b=\sqrt{2A} \; ,$
-   the _vertices_ $\left(\sqrt{A},\sqrt{A}\right), \left(-\sqrt{A},-\sqrt{A}\right) \; ,$
-   the _semi-latus rectum_ and ''radius of curvature '' at the vertices $p=a=\sqrt{2A} \; ,$
-   the _linear eccentricity_ $c=2\sqrt{A}$ and the eccentricity $e=\sqrt{2} \; ,$
-   the _tangent_ $y=-\tfrac{A}{x_0^2}x+2\tfrac{A}{x_0}$ at point (x₀, A/x₀) .

A rotation of the original hyperbola by  + 45^(∘) results in a rectangular hyperbola entirely in the second and fourth quadrants, with the same asymptotes, center, semi-latus rectum, radius of curvature at the vertices, linear eccentricity, and eccentricity as for the case of  − 45^(∘) rotation, with equation

$$y=\frac{-A}{x} \; , A>0\; ,$$

-   the _semi-axes_ $a=b=\sqrt{2A} \; ,$
-   the line y =  − x as major axis,
-   the _vertices_ $\left(-\sqrt{A},\sqrt{A}\right), \left(\sqrt{A},-\sqrt{A}\right) \; .$

Shifting the hyperbola with equation $y=\frac{A}{x}, \ A\ne 0\ ,$ so that the new center is (c₀, d₀), yields the new equation

$$y=\frac{A}{x-c_0}+d_0\; ,$$
and the new asymptotes are x = c₀ and y = d₀.
The shape parameters a, b, p, c, e remain unchanged.


Definition of a hyperbola by the directrix property

Hyperbel-ll-e.svg Hyperbel-ll-def.svg The two lines at distance $d = \frac{a^2}c$ and parallel to the minor axis are called DIRECTRICES of the hyperbola (see diagram).

For an arbitrary point P of the hyperbola the quotient of the distance to one focus and to the corresponding directrix (see diagram) is equal to the eccentricity:

$$\frac{|PF_1|}{|Pl_1|} = \frac{|PF_2|}{|Pl_2|} = e= \frac{c}{a}\ .$$
The proof for the pair F₁, l₁ follows from the fact that $|PF_1|^2=(x-c)^2+y^2,\ |Pl_1|^2=\left(x-\tfrac{a^2}{c}\right)^2$ and $y^2=\tfrac{b^2}{a^2}x^2-b^2$ satisfy the equation

$$|PF_1|^2-\frac{c^2}{a^2}|Pl_1|^2=0\ .$$
The second case is proven analogously. Kegelschnitt-schar-ev.svg The _inverse statement_ is also true and can be used to define a hyperbola (in a manner similar to the definition of a parabola):

For any point F (focus), any line l (directrix) not through F and any real number e with e > 1 the set of points (locus of points), for which the quotient of the distances to the point and to the line is e

$$H = \left\{P \, \Biggr| \, \frac{|PF|}{|Pl|} = e\right\}$$

    is a hyperbola.

(The choice e = 1 yields a parabola and if e < 1 an ellipse.)

Proof:

Let F = (f, 0), e > 0 and assume (0, 0) is a point on the curve. The directrix l has equation $x=-\tfrac{f}{e}$. With P = (x, y), the relation |PF|² = e²|Pl|² produces the equations

$$(x-f)^2+y^2=e^2\left(x+\tfrac{f}{e}\right)^2=(e x+f)^2$$
and x²(e² − 1) + 2xf(1 + e) − y² = 0. The substitution p = f(1 + e) yields

_x_²(_e_² − 1) + 2_p__x_ − _y_² = 0.
This is the equation of an _ellipse_ (e < 1) or a _parabola_ (e = 1) or a _hyperbola_ (e > 1). All of these non-degenerate conics have, in common, the origin as a vertex (see diagram).

If e > 1, introduce new parameters a, b so that $e^2-1 =\tfrac{b^2}{a^2}, \text { and }\ p=\tfrac{b^2}{a}$, and then the equation above becomes

$$\tfrac{(x+a)^2}{a^2}-\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}=1\ ,$$
which is the equation of a hyperbola with center ( − a, 0), the _x_-axis as major axis and the major/minor semi axis a, b.


Hyperbola as plane section of a cone

Hyperbel-dandel-s.svg The intersection of an upright double cone by a plane not through the vertex with slope greater than the slope of the lines on the cone is a hyperbola (see diagram: red curve). In order to prove the defining property of a hyperbola (see above) one uses two Dandelin spheres d₁, d₂, which are spheres that touch the cone along circles c₁ , c₂ and the intersecting (hyperbola) plane at points F₁ and F₂. It turns out: F₁, F₂ are the _foci_ of the hyperbola.

1.  Let P be an arbitrary point of the intersection curve .
2.  The generator (line) of the cone containing P intersects circle c₁ at point A and circle c₂ at a point B.
3.  The line segments $\overline{PF_1}$ and $\overline{PA}$ are tangential to the sphere d₁ and, hence, are of equal length.
4.  The line segments $\overline{PF_2}$ and $\overline{PB}$ are tangential to the sphere d₂ and, hence, are of equal length.
5.  The result is: |PF₁| − |PF₂| = |PA| − |PB| = |AB| is independent of the hyperbola point P.


Pin and string construction

Hyperbola-pin-string.svg The definition of a hyperbola by its foci and its circular directrices (see above) can be used for drawing an arc of it with help of pins, a string and a ruler [17]:

(0) Choose the _foci_ F₁, F₂, the vertices V₁, V₂ and one of the _circular directrices_ , for example c₂ (circle with radius 2a)
(1) A _ruler_ is fixed at point F₂ free to rotate around F₂. Point B is marked at distance 2a.
(2) A _string_ with length |AB| is prepared.
(3) One end of the string is pinned at point A on the ruler, the other end is pinned to point F₁.
(4) Take a _pen_ and hold the string tight to the edge of the ruler.
(5) _Rotating_ the ruler around F₂ prompts the pen to draw an arc of the right branch of the hyperbola, because of |PF₁| = |PB| (see the definition of a hyperbola by _circular directrices_).


The tangent bisects the angle between the lines to the foci

Hyperbel-wh-s.svg The tangent at a point P bisects the angle between the lines $\overline{PF_1}, \overline{PF_2}$.

Proof:

Let L be the point on the line $\overline{PF_2}$ with the distance 2a to the focus F₂ (see diagram, a is the semi major axis of the hyperbola). Line w is the bisector of the angle between the lines $\overline{PF_1}, \overline{PF_2}$. In order to prove that w is the tangent line at point P, one checks that any point Q on line w which is different from P cannot be on the hyperbola. Hence w has only point P in common with the hyperbola and is, therefore, the tangent at point P.
From the diagram and the triangle inequality one recognizes that |QF₂| < |LF₂| + |QL| = 2a + |QF₁| holds, which means: |QF₂| − |QF₁| < 2a. But if Q is a point of the hyperbola, the difference should be 2a.


Midpoints of parallel chords

Hyperbel-psehnen-s.svg Hyperbel-sa-s.svg The midpoints of parallel chords of a hyperbola lie on a line through the center (see diagram).

The points of any chord may lie on different branches of the hyperbola.

The proof of the property on midpoints is best done for the hyperbola y = 1/x. Because any hyperbola is an affine image of the hyperbola y = 1/x (see section below) and an affine transformation preserves parallelism and midpoints of line segments, the property is true for all hyperbolas:
For two points $P=\left(x_1,\tfrac {1 }{x_1}\right), \ Q=\left(x_2,\tfrac {1 }{x_2}\right)$ of the hyperbola y = 1/x

    the midpoint of the chord is $M=\left(\tfrac{x_1+x_2}{2},\cdots\right)=\cdots =\tfrac{x_1+x_2}{2}\; \left(1,\tfrac{1}{x_1x_2}\right) \ ;$

    the slope of the chord is $\frac{\tfrac {1 }{x_2}-\tfrac {1 }{x_1}}{x_2-x_1}=\cdots =-\tfrac{1}{x_1x_2} \ .$

For parallel chords the slope is constant and the midpoints of the parallel chords lie on the line $y=\tfrac{1}{x_1x_2} \; x \ .$

Consequence: for any pair of points P, Q of a chord there exists a _skew reflection_ with an axis (set of fixed points) passing through the center of the hyperbola, which exchanges the points P, Q and leaves the hyperbola (as a whole) fixed. A skew reflection is a generalization of an ordinary reflection across a line m, where all point-image pairs are on a line perpendicular to m.

Because a skew reflection leaves the hyperbola fixed, the pair of asymptotes is fixed, too. Hence the midpoint M of a chord PQ divides the related line segment $\overline P \, \overline Q$ between the asymptotes into halves, too. This means that $|P\overline P|=|Q\overline Q|$. This property can be used for the construction of further points Q of the hyperbola if a point P and the asymptotes are given.

If the chord degenerates into a _tangent_, then the touching point divides the line segment between the asymptotes in two halves.


Steiner generation of a hyperbola

Hyperbel-steiner-e.svg Hyperbola_construction_-_parallelogram_method.gif The following method to construct single points of a hyperbola relies on the Steiner generation of a non degenerate conic section:

    Given two pencils B(U), B(V) of lines at two points U, V (all lines containing U and V, respectively) and a projective but not perspective mapping π of B(U) onto B(V), then the intersection points of corresponding lines form a non-degenerate projective conic section.

For the generation of points of the hyperbola $\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}=1$ one uses the pencils at the vertices V₁, V₂. Let P = (x₀, y₀) be a point of the hyperbola and A = (a, y₀), B = (x₀, 0). The line segment $\overline{BP}$ is divided into n equally-spaced segments and this division is projected parallel with the diagonal AB as direction onto the line segment $\overline{AP}$ (see diagram). The parallel projection is part of the projective mapping between the pencils at V₁ and V₂ needed. The intersection points of any two related lines S₁A_(i) and S₂B_(i) are points of the uniquely defined hyperbola.

_Remark:_ The subdivision could be extended beyond the points A and B in order to get more points, but the determination of the intersection points would become more inaccurate. A better idea is extending the points already constructed by symmetry (see animation).

_Remark:_

1.  The Steiner generation exists for ellipses and parabolas, too.
2.  The Steiner generation is sometimes called a _parallelogram method_ because one can use other points rather than the vertices, which starts with a parallelogram instead of a rectangle.

== Inscribed angles for hyperbolas _y_ = _a_/(_x_ − _b_) + _c_ and the 3-point-form == Hyperbel-pws-s.svg A hyperbola with equation $y=\tfrac{a}{x-b}+c,\ a \ne 0$ is uniquely determined by three points (x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂), (x₃, y₃) with different _x_- and _y_-coordinates. A simple way to determine the shape parameters a, b, c uses the _inscribed angle theorem_ for hyperbolas:

    In order to MEASURE AN ANGLE between two lines with equations y = m₁x + d₁, y = m₂x + d₂ , m₁, m₂ ≠ 0 in this context one uses the quotient

$$\frac{m_1}{m_2}\ .$$

Analogous to the inscribed angle theorem for circles one gets the

INSCRIBED ANGLE THEOREM FOR HYPERBOLAS:,:[18][19]

    For four points P_(i) = (x_(i), y_(i)), i = 1, 2, 3, 4, x_(i) ≠ x_(k), y_(i) ≠ y_(k), i ≠ k (see diagram) the following statement is true:
    The four points are on a hyperbola with equation $y=\tfrac{a}{x-b}+c$ if and only if the angles at P₃ and P₄ are equal in the sense of the measurement above. That means if
    $$\frac{(y_4-y_1)}{(x_4-x_1)}\frac{(x_4-x_2)}{(y_4-y_2)}=\frac{(y_3-y_1)}{(x_3-x_1)}\frac{(x_3-x_2)}{(y_3-y_2)}$$

(Proof: straightforward calculation. If the points are on a hyperbola, one can assume the hyperbola's equation is y = a/x.)

A consequence of the inscribed angle theorem for hyperbolas is the

3-POINT-FORM OF A HYPERBOLA'S EQUATION:
: The equation of the hyperbola determined by 3 points P_(i) = (x_(i), y_(i)), i = 1, 2, 3, x_(i) ≠ x_(k), y_(i) ≠ y_(k), i ≠ k is the solution of the equation

$$\frac{({\color{red}y}-y_1)}{({\color{green}x}-x_1)}\frac{({\color{green}x}-x_2)}{({\color{red}y}-y_2)}=\frac{(y_3-y_1)}{(x_3-x_1)}\frac{(x_3-x_2)}{(y_3-y_2)}$$

    for ${\color{red}y}$.


Orthogonal tangents – orthoptic

Orthoptic-hyperbola-s.svg For a hyperbola $\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1, \, a>b$ the intersection points of _orthogonal_ tangents lie on the circle x² + y² = a² − b².
This circle is called the _orthoptic_ of the given hyperbola.

The tangents may belong to points on different branches of the hyperbola.

In case of a ≤ b there are no pairs of orthogonal tangents.


Pole-polar relation for a hyperbola

Hyperbel-pol-s.svg Any hyperbola can be described in a suitable coordinate system by an equation $\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}= 1$. The equation of the tangent at a point P₀ = (x₀, y₀) of the hyperbola is $\tfrac{x_0x}{a^2}-\tfrac{y_0y}{b^2}=1.$ If one allows point P₀ = (x₀, y₀) to be an arbitrary point different from the origin, then

    point P₀ = (x₀, y₀) ≠ (0, 0) is mapped onto the line $\frac{x_0x}{a^2}-\frac{y_0y}{b^2}=1$, not through the center of the hyperbola.

This relation between points and lines is a bijection.

The inverse function maps

    line y = mx + d, d ≠ 0 onto the point $\left(-\frac{ma^2}{d},-\frac{b^2}{d}\right)$ and

    line x = c, c ≠ 0 onto the point $\left(\frac{a^2}{c},0\right)\ .$

Such a relation between points and lines generated by a conic is called POLE-POLAR RELATION or just _polarity_. The pole is the point, the polar the line. See Pole and polar.

By calculation one checks the following properties of the pole-polar relation of the hyperbola:

-   For a point (pole) _on_ the hyperbola the polar is the tangent at this point (see diagram: P₁, p₁).
-   For a pole P _outside_ the hyperbola the intersection points of its polar with the hyperbola are the tangency points of the two tangents passing P (see diagram: P₂, p₂, P₃, p₃).
-   For a point _within_ the hyperbola the polar has no point with the hyperbola in common. (see diagram: P₄, p₄).

_Remarks:_

1.  The intersection point of two polars (for example: p₂, p₃) is the pole of the line through their poles (here: P₂, P₃).
2.  The foci (c, 0), and ( − c, 0) respectively and the directrices $x=\tfrac{a^2}{c}$ and $x=-\tfrac{a^2}{c}$ respectively belong to pairs of pole and polar.

Pole-polar relations exist for ellipses and parabolas, too.

== Hyperbola as an affine image of the unit hyperbola _x_² – _y_² = 1 == Hyperbel-aff-s.svg Another definition of a hyperbola uses affine transformations:

    Any _hyperbola_ is the affine image of the unit hyperbola with equation x² − y² = 1.

An affine transformation of the Euclidean plane has the form x⃗ → f⃗₀ + Ax⃗, where A is a regular matrix (its determinant is not 0) and f⃗₀ is an arbitrary vector. If f⃗₁, f⃗₂ are the column vectors of the matrix A, the unit hyperbola $(\pm\cosh(t),\sinh(t)), t \in \R,$ is mapped onto the hyperbola

_x⃗_ = _p⃗_(_t_) = _f⃗_₀ ± _f⃗_₁cosh _t_ + _f⃗_₂sinh _t_ .

f⃗₀ is the center, f⃗₀ + f⃗₁ a point of the hyperbola and f⃗₂ a tangent vector at this point. In general the vectors f⃗₁, f⃗₂ are not perpendicular. That means, in general f⃗₀ ± f⃗₁ are _not_ the vertices of the hyperbola. But f⃗₁ ± f⃗₂ point into the directions of the asymptotes. The tangent vector at point p⃗(t) is

_p⃗_′(_t_) = _f⃗_₁sinh _t_ + _f⃗_₂cosh _t_ .
Because at a vertex the tangent is perpendicular to the major axis of the hyperbola one gets the parameter t₀ of a vertex from the equation

_p⃗_′(_t_) ⋅ (_p⃗_(_t_)−_f⃗_₀) = (_f⃗_₁sinh_t_+_f⃗_₂cosh_t_) ⋅ (_f⃗_₁cosh_t_+_f⃗_₂sinh_t_) = 0
and hence from

$$\coth (2t_0)= -\tfrac{\vec f_1^{\, 2}+\vec f_2^{\, 2}}{2\vec f_1 \cdot \vec f_2} \ ,$$
which yields

$$t_0=\tfrac{1}{4}\ln\tfrac{\left(\vec f_1-\vec f_2\right)^2}{\left(\vec f_1+\vec f_2\right)^2}.$$

(The formulae $\cosh^2 x +\sinh^2 x=\cosh 2x,\ 2\sinh x \cosh x = \sinh 2x,\ \operatorname{arcoth} x = \tfrac{1}{2}\ln\tfrac{x+1}{x-1}$ were used.)

The two _vertices_ of the hyperbola are f⃗₀ ± (f⃗₁cosht₀+f⃗₂sinht₀).

The advantage of this definition is that one gets a simple parametric representation of an arbitrary hyperbola, even in the space, if the vectors f⃗₀, f⃗₁, f⃗₂ are vectors of the Euclidean space.

== Hyperbola as an affine image of the hyperbola _y_ = 1/_x_ == Hyperbel-aff2.svg Because the unit hyperbola x² − y² = 1 is affinely equivalent to the hyperbola y = 1/x, an arbitrary hyperbola can be considered as the affine image (see previous section) of the hyperbola y = 1/x :

$$\vec x= \vec p(t)=\vec f_0 + \vec f_1 t+ \vec f_2 \tfrac{1}{t}, \quad t\ne 0\ .$$

M : f⃗₀ is the center of the hyperbola, the vectors f⃗₁, f⃗₂ have the directions of the asymptotes and f⃗₁ + f⃗₂ is a point of the hyperbola. The tangent vector is

$$\vec p'(t)=\vec f_1 - \vec f_2 \tfrac{1}{t^2}.$$
At a vertex the tangent is perpendicular to the major axis. Hence

$$\vec p'(t)\cdot \left(\vec p(t) -\vec f_0\right) = \left(\vec f_1 - \vec f_2 \tfrac{1}{t^2}\right)\cdot\left(\vec f_1 t+ \vec f_2 \tfrac{1}{t}\right) = \vec f_1^2t-\vec f_2^2 \tfrac{1}{t^3} = 0$$
and the parameter of a vertex is

$$t_0= \pm \sqrt[4]{\tfrac{\vec f_2^2}{\vec f_1^2}}.$$

|f⃗₁| = |f⃗₂| is equivalent to t₀ =  ± 1 and f⃗₀ ± (f⃗₁ + f⃗₂) are the vertices of the hyperbola.

The following properties of a hyperbola are easily proven using the representation of a hyperbola introduced in this section.

Tangent construction

Hyperbel-tang-s.svg The tangent vector can be rewritten by factorization:

$$\vec p'(t)=\tfrac{1}{t}\left(\vec f_1t - \vec f_2 \tfrac{1}{t}\right) \ .$$
This means that

    the diagonal AB of the parallelogram $M: \ \vec f_0, \ A=\vec f_0+\vec f_1t,\ B:\ \vec f_0+ \vec f_2 \tfrac{1}{t},\ P:\ \vec f_0+\vec f_1t+\vec f_2 \tfrac{1}{t}$ is parallel to the tangent at the hyperbola point P (see diagram).

This property provides a way to construct the tangent at a point on the hyperbola.

This property of a hyperbola is an affine version of the 3-point-degeneration of Pascal's theorem.[20]

Area of the grey parallelogram:

The area of the grey parallelogram MAPB in the above diagram is

$$\text{Area}=\Big|\det\left( t\vec f_1, \tfrac{1}{t}\vec f_2\right)\Big|=\Big|\det\left(\vec f_1,\vec f_2\right)\Big|= \cdots = \frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$$
and hence independent of point P. The last equation follows from a calculation for the case, where P is a vertex and the hyperbola in its canonical form $\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}=1 \ .$

Point construction

Hyperbel-pasc4-s.svg

For a hyperbola with parametric representation $\vec x= \vec p(t)=\vec f_1 t+ \vec f_2 \tfrac{1}{t}$ (for simplicity the center is the origin) the following is true:

    For any two points $P_1:\ \vec f_1 t_1+ \vec f_2 \tfrac{1}{t_1},\ P_2:\ \vec f_1 t_2+ \vec f_2 \tfrac{1}{t_2}$ the points
    $A:\ \vec a =\vec f_1 t_1+ \vec f_2 \tfrac{1}{t_2}, \ B:\ \vec b=\vec f_1 t_2+ \vec f_2 \tfrac{1}{t_1}$
    are collinear with the center of the hyperbola (see diagram).

The simple proof is a consequence of the equation $\tfrac{1}{t_1}\vec a=\tfrac{1}{t_2}\vec b$.

This property provides a possibility to construct points of a hyperbola if the asymptotes and one point are given.

This property of a hyperbola is an affine version of the 4-point-degeneration of Pascal's theorem.[21]

Tangent-asymptotes-triangle

Hyperbel-tad-s.svg For simplicity the center of the hyperbola may be the origin and the vectors f⃗₁, f⃗₂ have equal length. If the last assumption is not fulfilled one can first apply a parameter transformation (see above) in order to make the assumption true. Hence  ± (f⃗₁ + f⃗₂) are the vertices,  ± (f⃗₁ − f⃗₂) span the minor axis and one gets |f⃗₁ + f⃗₂| = a and |f⃗₁ − f⃗₂| = b.

For the intersection points of the tangent at point $\vec p(t_0)=\vec f_1 t_0+ \vec f_2 \tfrac{1}{t_0}$ with the asymptotes one gets the points

$$C=2t_0\vec f_1,\ D=\tfrac{2}{t_0}\vec f_2.$$
The _area_ of the triangle M, C, D can be calculated by a 2x2-determinant:

$$A=\tfrac{1}{2}\Big|\det\left( 2t_0\vec f_1, \tfrac{2}{t_0}\vec f_2\right)\Big|=2\Big|\det\left(\vec f_1,\vec f_2\right)\Big|$$
(see rules for determinants). |det (f⃗₁, f⃗₂)| is the area of the rhombus generated by f⃗₁, f⃗₂. The area of a rhombus is equal to one half of the product of its diagonals. The diagonals are the semi-axes a, b of the hyperbola. Hence:

    The _area_ of the triangle MCD is independent of the point of the hyperbola: A = ab.


Polar coordinates

Hyperbel-pold-f-s.svg Hyperbel-pold-m-s.svg '''For pole = focus: '''

The polar coordinates used most commonly for the hyperbola are defined relative to the Cartesian coordinate system that has its _origin in a focus_ and its x-axis pointing towards the origin of the "canonical coordinate system" as illustrated in the first diagram.
In this case the angle φ is called TRUE ANOMALY.

Relative to this coordinate system one has that

$$r = \frac{p}{1 \mp e \cos \varphi}, \quad p=\tfrac{b^2}{a}$$

and

$$-\arccos \left(-\frac 1 e\right) < \varphi < \arccos \left(-\frac 1 e\right).$$

FOR POLE = CENTER:

With polar coordinates relative to the "canonical coordinate system" (see second diagram) one has that

$$r =\frac{b}{\sqrt{e^2 \cos^2 \varphi -1}} .\,$$

For the right branch of the hyperbola the range of φ is

$$-\arccos \left(\frac 1 e\right) < \varphi < \arccos \left(\frac 1 e\right).$$


Parametric equations

A hyperbola with equation $\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}= 1$ can be described by several parametric equations:

    1: $\left\{\begin{matrix}\quad \; x \, = \, \pm a \cosh t \\ y \, = \, b \sinh t \end{matrix}\right. \quad ,\ t \in \R \ .$
    2: $\left\{\begin{matrix} \quad \ x \, = \, \pm a\, \tfrac{t^2+1}{2t} \\ y \, = \, b\, \tfrac{t^2-1}{2t} \end{matrix}\right. \quad ,\ t >0 \ .$ (_rational_ representation)
    3: $\left\{\begin{matrix}\quad \ x \, = \, \frac{a}{\cos t}=a\sec t \\ y \, = \, \pm b \tan t \end{matrix}\right. \ , \quad 0 \le t < 2\pi; \; t \ne \frac{\pi}{2}; \; t \ne \frac{3}{2}\pi \ .$

    4: TANGENT SLOPE AS PARAMETER:

A parametric representation, which uses the slope m of the tangent at a point of the hyperbola can be obtained analogously to the ellipse case: Replace in the ellipse case b² by  − b² and use formulae for the hyperbolic functions. One gets

$$\vec c_\pm(m) = \left(-\frac{ma^2}{\pm\sqrt{m^2a^2-b^2}}\;,\;\frac{-b^2}{\pm\sqrt{m^2a^2-b^2}}\right) \ , \ |m|>b/a \ .$$
c⃗_(−) is the upper and c⃗₊ the lower half of the hyperbola. The points with vertical tangents (vertices ( ± a, 0)) are not covered by the representation.
The equation of the tangent at point c⃗_(±)(m) is

$$y = m x \pm\sqrt{m^2a^2-b^2}.$$
This description of the tangents of a hyperbola is an essential tool for the determination of the orthoptic of a hyperbola.


Other mathematical definitions

Reciprocation of a circle

The reciprocation of a circle _B_ in a circle _C_ always yields a conic section such as a hyperbola. The process of "reciprocation in a circle _C_" consists of replacing every line and point in a geometrical figure with their corresponding pole and polar, respectively. The _pole_ of a line is the inversion of its closest point to the circle _C_, whereas the polar of a point is the converse, namely, a line whose closest point to _C_ is the inversion of the point.

The eccentricity of the conic section obtained by reciprocation is the ratio of the distances between the two circles' centers to the radius _r_ of reciprocation circle _C_. If B and C represent the points at the centers of the corresponding circles, then

$$e = \frac{\overline{BC}}{r}.$$

Since the eccentricity of a hyperbola is always greater than one, the center B must lie outside of the reciprocating circle _C_.

This definition implies that the hyperbola is both the locus of the poles of the tangent lines to the circle _B_, as well as the envelope of the polar lines of the points on _B_. Conversely, the circle _B_ is the envelope of polars of points on the hyperbola, and the locus of poles of tangent lines to the hyperbola. Two tangent lines to _B_ have no (finite) poles because they pass through the center C of the reciprocation circle _C_; the polars of the corresponding tangent points on _B_ are the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The two branches of the hyperbola correspond to the two parts of the circle _B_ that are separated by these tangent points.

Quadratic equation

A hyperbola can also be defined as a second-degree equation in the Cartesian coordinates (_x_, _y_) in the plane,

_A__(_x__x_)_x_² + 2_A__(_x__y_)_x__y_ + _A__(_y__y_)_y_² + 2_B__(_x_)_x_ + 2_B__(_y_)_y_ + _C_ = 0,

provided that the constants _A__(_xx_), _A__(_xy_), _A__(_yy_), _B__(_x_), _B__(_y_), and _C_ satisfy the determinant condition

$$D := \begin{vmatrix} A_{xx} & A_{xy}\\A_{xy} & A_{yy} \end{vmatrix} < 0.\,$$

This determinant is conventionally called the discriminant of the conic section.[22]

A special case of a hyperbola—the _degenerate hyperbola_ consisting of two intersecting lines—occurs when another determinant is zero:

$$\Delta := \begin{vmatrix} A_{xx} & A_{xy} & B_x \\A_{xy} & A_{yy} & B_y \\ B_x & B_y & C \end{vmatrix} = 0.$$

This determinant Δ is sometimes called the discriminant of the conic section.[23]

Given the above general parametrization of the hyperbola in Cartesian coordinates, the eccentricity can be found using the formula in Conic section#Eccentricity in terms of parameters of the quadratic form.

The center (_x__(_c_), _y__(_c_)) of the hyperbola may be determined from the formulae

$$x_c = -\frac{1}{D} \begin{vmatrix} B_x & A_{xy} \\ B_y & A_{yy} \end{vmatrix};$$

$$y_c = -\frac 1 D \begin{vmatrix} A_{xx} & B_x \\A_{xy} & B_y \end{vmatrix}.$$

In terms of new coordinates, _x_ − _x__(_c_)}} and _y_ − _y__(_c_)}}, the defining equation of the hyperbola can be written

$$A_{xx} \xi^2 + 2A_{xy} \xi\eta + A_{yy} \eta^2 + \frac \Delta D = 0.$$

The principal axes of the hyperbola make an angle _φ_ with the positive _x_-axis that is given by

$$\tan 2\varphi = \frac{2A_{xy}}{A_{xx} - A_{yy}}.$$

Rotating the coordinate axes so that the _x_-axis is aligned with the transverse axis brings the equation into its CANONICAL FORM

$$\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1.$$

The major and minor semiaxes _a_ and _b_ are defined by the equations

$$a^2 = -\frac \Delta {\lambda_1 D} = -\frac \Delta {\lambda_1^2 \lambda_2},$$

$$b^{2} = -\frac{\Delta}{\lambda_{2}D} = -\frac{\Delta}{\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}^{2}},$$

where λ₁ and λ₂ are the roots of the quadratic equation

_λ_² − (_A__(_x__x_)+_A__(_y__y_))_λ_ + _D_ = 0.

For comparison, the corresponding equation for a degenerate hyperbola (consisting of two intersecting lines) is

$$\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 0.$$

The tangent line to a given point (_x_₀, _y_₀) on the hyperbola is defined by the equation

_E__x_ + _F__y_ + _G_ = 0

where _E_, _F_ and _G_ are defined by

_E_ = _A__(_x__x_)_x_₀ + _A__(_x__y_)_y_₀ + _B__(_x_),

_F_ = _A__(_x__y_)_x_₀ + _A__(_y__y_)_y_₀ + _B__(_y_),

_G_ = _B__(_x_)_x_₀ + _B__(_y_)_y_₀ + _C_.

The normal line to the hyperbola at the same point is given by the equation

_F_(_x_ − _x_₀) − _E_(_y_ − _y_₀) = 0.

The normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line, and both pass through the same point (_x_₀, _y_₀).

From the equation

$$\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, \qquad 0 < b \leq a,$$
the left focus is ( − ae, 0) and the right focus is (ae, 0), where is the eccentricity. Denote the distances from a point (_x, y_) to the left and right foci as r₁ ​ and r₂. ​ For a point on the right branch,

_r_₁ − _r_₂ = 2_a_, ​

and for a point on the left branch,

_r_₂ − _r_₁ = 2_a_. ​

This can be proved as follows:

If (_x_,_y_) is a point on the hyperbola the distance to the left focal point is

_r_₁² = (_x_ + _a__e_)² + _y_² = _x_² + 2_x__a__e_ + _a_²_e_² + (_x_²−_a_²)(_e_²−1) = (_e__x_ + _a_)².

To the right focal point the distance is

_r_₂² = (_x_ − _a__e_)² + _y_² = _x_² − 2_x__a__e_ + _a_²_e_² + (_x_²−_a_²)(_e_²−1) = (_e__x_ − _a_)².

If (_x,y_) is a point on the right branch of the hyperbola then ex > a ​ and

_r_₁ = _e__x_ + _a_, ​

_r_₂ = _e__x_ − _a_. ​

Subtracting these equations one gets

_r_₁ − _r_₂ = 2_a_. ​

If (_x,y_) is a point on the left branch of the hyperbola then ex <  − a ​ and

_r_₁ =  − _e__x_ − _a_, ​

_r_₂ =  − _e__x_ + _a_. ​

Subtracting these equations one gets

_r_₂ − _r_₁ = 2_a_. ​


Conic section analysis of the hyperbolic appearance of circles

Zp-Kugel-Augp-innen.svg of circles on a sphere: The center _O_ of projection is inside the sphere, the image plane is red.
As images of the circles one gets a circle (magenta), ellipses, hyperbolas and lines. The special case of a parabola does not appear in this example.
(If center _O_ were _on_ the sphere, all images of the circles would be circles or lines; see stereographic projection).]] Besides providing a uniform description of circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, conic sections can also be understood as a natural model of the geometry of perspective in the case where the scene being viewed consists of circles, or more generally an ellipse. The viewer is typically a camera or the human eye and the image of the scene a central projection onto an image plane, that is, all projection rays pass a fixed point _O_, the center. The LENS PLANE is a plane parallel to the image plane at the lens _O_.

The image of a circle c is

    a) a CIRCLE, if circle _c_ is in a special position, for example parallel to the image plane and others (see stereographic projection),
    b) an ELLIPSE, if _c_ has _no_ point with the lens plane in common,
    c) a PARABOLA, if _c_ has _one_ point with the lens plane in common and
    d) a HYPERBOLA, if _c_ has _two_ points with the lens plane in common.

(Special positions where the circle plane contains point _O_ are omitted.)

These results can be understood if one recognizes that the projection process can be seen in two steps: 1) circle c and point _O_ generate a cone which is 2) cut by the image plane, in order to generate the image.

One sees a hyperbola whenever catching sight of a portion of a circle cut by one's lens plane. The inability to see very much of the arms of the visible branch, combined with the complete absence of the second branch, makes it virtually impossible for the human visual system to recognize the connection with hyperbolas.


Arc length

The arc length of a hyperbola does not have a closed-form expression. The upper half of a hyperbola can be parameterized as

$$y=b\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-1}.$$

Then the integral giving the arc length s from x₁ to x₂ can be computed numerically:

$$s=b\int_{\operatorname{arcosh}\frac{x_{1}}{a}}^{\operatorname{arcosh}\frac{x_{2}}{a}} \sqrt{1+\left(1+\frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}\right) \sinh ^{2}v} \, \mathrm dv$$

After using the substitution z = iv, this can also be represented using the elliptic integral of the second kind with parameter m = k²:

$$s=-ib\Biggr[E\left(iz \, \Biggr| \, 1+\frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}\right)\Biggr]^{\operatorname{arcosh}\frac{x_{2}}{a}}_{\operatorname{arcosh}\frac{x_{1}}{a}}$$


Derived curves

Several other curves can be derived from the hyperbola by inversion, the so-called inverse curves of the hyperbola. If the center of inversion is chosen as the hyperbola's own center, the inverse curve is the lemniscate of Bernoulli; the lemniscate is also the envelope of circles centered on a rectangular hyperbola and passing through the origin. If the center of inversion is chosen at a focus or a vertex of the hyperbola, the resulting inverse curves are a limaçon or a strophoid, respectively.


Elliptic coordinates

A family of confocal hyperbolas is the basis of the system of elliptic coordinates in two dimensions. These hyperbolas are described by the equation

$$\left(\frac x {c \cos\theta}\right)^2 - \left(\frac y {c \sin\theta}\right)^2 = 1$$

where the foci are located at a distance _c_ from the origin on the _x_-axis, and where θ is the angle of the asymptotes with the _x_-axis. Every hyperbola in this family is orthogonal to every ellipse that shares the same foci. This orthogonality may be shown by a conformal map of the Cartesian coordinate system _w_ = _z_ + 1/_z_, where _z_= _x_ + _iy_ are the original Cartesian coordinates, and _w_=_u_ + _iv_ are those after the transformation.

Other orthogonal two-dimensional coordinate systems involving hyperbolas may be obtained by other conformal mappings. For example, the mapping _w_ = _z_² transforms the Cartesian coordinate system into two families of orthogonal hyperbolas.


Other properties of hyperbolas

-   The following are concurrent: (1) a circle passing through the hyperbola's foci and centered at the hyperbola's center; (2) either of the lines that are tangent to the hyperbola at the vertices; and (3) either of the asymptotes of the hyperbola.[24][25]
-   The following are also concurrent: (1) the circle that is centered at the hyperbola's center and that passes through the hyperbola's vertices; (2) either directrix; and (3) either of the asymptotes.[26]


Applications

Sundials

Hyperbolas may be seen in many sundials. On any given day, the sun revolves in a circle on the celestial sphere, and its rays striking the point on a sundial traces out a cone of light. The intersection of this cone with the horizontal plane of the ground forms a conic section. At most populated latitudes and at most times of the year, this conic section is a hyperbola. In practical terms, the shadow of the tip of a pole traces out a hyperbola on the ground over the course of a day (this path is called the _declination line_). The shape of this hyperbola varies with the geographical latitude and with the time of the year, since those factors affect the cone of the sun's rays relative to the horizon. The collection of such hyperbolas for a whole year at a given location was called a _pelekinon_ by the Greeks, since it resembles a double-bladed axe.

Multilateration

A hyperbola is the basis for solving multilateration problems, the task of locating a point from the differences in its distances to given points — or, equivalently, the difference in arrival times of synchronized signals between the point and the given points. Such problems are important in navigation, particularly on water; a ship can locate its position from the difference in arrival times of signals from a LORAN or GPS transmitters. Conversely, a homing beacon or any transmitter can be located by comparing the arrival times of its signals at two separate receiving stations; such techniques may be used to track objects and people. In particular, the set of possible positions of a point that has a distance difference of 2_a_ from two given points is a hyperbola of vertex separation 2_a_ whose foci are the two given points.

Path followed by a particle

The path followed by any particle in the classical Kepler problem is a conic section. In particular, if the total energy _E_ of the particle is greater than zero (that is, if the particle is unbound), the path of such a particle is a hyperbola. This property is useful in studying atomic and sub-atomic forces by scattering high-energy particles; for example, the Rutherford experiment demonstrated the existence of an atomic nucleus by examining the scattering of alpha particles from gold atoms. If the short-range nuclear interactions are ignored, the atomic nucleus and the alpha particle interact only by a repulsive Coulomb force, which satisfies the inverse square law requirement for a Kepler problem.

Korteweg–de Vries equation

The hyperbolic trig function sech  x appears as one solution to the Korteweg–de Vries equation which describes the motion of a soliton wave in a canal.

Angle trisection

Hyperbola_angle_trisection.svg

As shown first by Apollonius of Perga, a hyperbola can be used to trisect any angle, a well studied problem of geometry. Given an angle, first draw a circle centered at its vertex O, which intersects the sides of the angle at points A and B. Next draw the line segment with endpoints A and B and its perpendicular bisector ℓ. Construct a hyperbola of eccentricity _e_=2 with ℓ as directrix and B as a focus. Let P be the intersection (upper) of the hyperbola with the circle. Angle POB trisects angle AOB.

To prove this, reflect the line segment OP about the line ℓ obtaining the point P' as the image of P. Segment AP' has the same length as segment BP due to the reflection, while segment PP' has the same length as segment BP due to the eccentricity of the hyperbola. As OA, OP', OP and OB are all radii of the same circle (and so, have the same length), the triangles OAP', OPP' and OPB are all congruent. Therefore, the angle has been trisected, since 3×POB = AOB.[27]

Efficient portfolio frontier

In portfolio theory, the locus of mean-variance efficient portfolios (called the efficient frontier) is the upper half of the east-opening branch of a hyperbola drawn with the portfolio return's standard deviation plotted horizontally and its expected value plotted vertically; according to this theory, all rational investors would choose a portfolio characterized by some point on this locus.

Biochemistry

In biochemistry and pharmacology, the Hill equation and Hill-Langmuir equation respectively describe biological responses and the formation of protein–ligand complexes as functions of ligand concentration. They are both rectangular hyperbolae.


Hyperbolas as plane sections of quadrics

Hyperbolas appear as plane sections of the following quadrics:

-   Elliptic cone
-   Hyperbolic cylinder
-   Hyperbolic paraboloid
