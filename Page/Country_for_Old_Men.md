_COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN_ is an album by American jazz guitarist John Scofield. It earned Scofield a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album.[1]

The album features jazz versions of country music songs. The title was borrowed from the novel _No Country for Old Men_ (2005) by Cormac McCarthy which was adapted into a 2007 film, and also jokes about Scofield's age (he was 64 when the album was recorded; his longtime bassist Steve Swallow was 76).[2]
