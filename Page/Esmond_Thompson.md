FRANCIS HENRY ESMOND THOMPSON (born 1929) was a Northern Irish politician with the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP).

Born in Maghera, Thompson served with the Royal Navy and later the Ulster Defence Regiment.[1] He subsequently served as sub-postmaster at Maghera Post Office for 41 years, retiring in 2001.[2][3]

He served as a member of the UUP executive from 1971, still being in position as of 1994.[4] He also represented the party as a member of the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention for Mid-Ulster[5] and as a member of Magherafelt District Council from 1977-1981.[6] In November 1975, he was convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm, which he claimed he owned for his own protection.[7] In March 1977, he was shot in the arm in what was described as an assassination attempt, although he received only minor injuries.[8]

Thompson was known as a hard-line member of the UUP and had publicly criticised party colleague John Taylor during the life of the Constitutional Convention, feeling that Taylor was soft on proposals for power-sharing with the Social Democratic and Labour Party that had been proposed by William Craig.[9] In later years he was associated with the anti-Good Friday Agreement wing of the party[10] and was a strong critic of the leadership of David Trimble.[11]
