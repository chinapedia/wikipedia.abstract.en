The MAX WEDGE, formally the MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE WEDGE, was an engine option produced by the Chrysler Corporation from 1962 to 1964 that was available exclusively in B Platform (intermediate) Dodges and Plymouths. The Max Wedge motor used the Chrysler RB Block, and was produced in 413 and 426 cubic-inch iterations. By the strict definition of a muscle car as an intermediate-bodied vehicle equipped with a big-block engine, the 1962 Max Wedge Dodges and Plymouths were the first muscle cars.


History

Beginning in 1951 Chrysler's primary V8 engine was its 331

c.i. Hemi. In 1958, Chrysler introduced its new wedge-head B Block, which was implemented in the Dodge and Desoto lines. The following year saw the introduction of the RB Block in Chryslers and Imperials; this was a modified B Block with a raised deck resulting in an increase of stroke from 3.18 inches to 3.75 inches. In 1960 and 1961 Chrysler began offering RB-engine vehicles with its new "cross ram" induction system that had been developed by the Ramchargers Club - a group of Chrysler engineers - on their 1949 Plymouth drag race car "High and Mighty." This iteration of the cross-ram system was designated as "long ram," as the carburetors were placed flanking the motor.

1962 Chrysler introduced its new high-performance version of the 413 RB Block motor: the Maximum Performance Wedge. This engine had been in development since 1959 and employed "short ram" induction, wherein the carburetors were fitted diagonally on the intake manifold. The "Max Wedge" option was available exclusively in Chrysler's new-for-1962 intermediate B Platform in Dodges and Plymouths only. Chrysler had developed the option in part to capitalize on the rising popularity in NHRA super stock racing. Although Max Wedge cars were street legal, they were intended for racing purposes.

The first-year Max Wedge engines were 413 cubic inches and came in 410 and 420 horsepower versions. Dodge called its engine the "Ramcharger 413" while Plymouth called it the "Super Stock 413." In 1963 the engine's displacement increased to 426 cubic inches as the bore was increased from 4.19 to 4.25 inches. In May of that year, an improved version of the 426 was released, named the "Stage II." No motors were ever named "Stage 1." 1963 engines were available in 415 and 425 horsepower versions. 1964 was the final year of the Max Wedge option. The engine for the third year was named the "Stage III." Max Wedge cars equipped with four-speed transmissions were only produced in the final year, as prior to that point Chrysler did not have a manual transmission that could handle the power of the engine. In 1964 only 61 Dodges and 65 Plymouths were equipped with Chrysler's A-833 manual transmission.

Max Wedge cars are an essential part of automotive history as they are the first vehicles that can be classified as "muscle cars" by the strict definition as an intermediate-bodied car with a big-block motor. While both General Motors and Ford introduced intermediate platforms the same year, it was not until later that they outfitted their newly sized cars with big blocks. The 1962 413 Max Wedge Dodges and Plymouths preceded the 427 Ford Fairlane Thunderbolt (1964) and 390/427 Ford Fairlane (1966), 389 Pontiac GTO (1964), 396 Chevrolet Chevelle (1965), 400 Buick Gran Sport (1965), 400 Oldsmobile 442 (1965), and 427 Mercury Comet Cyclone (1964) and 390 Mercury Cyclone (1966).

Despite their historical significance and low production numbers, Max Wedge cars have not reached the same level of collectible desirability as other comparable muscle cars. This is in part due to their race specificity.
