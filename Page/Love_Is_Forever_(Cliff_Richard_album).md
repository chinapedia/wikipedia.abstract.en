_LOVE IS FOREVER_ is the ninth studio album by Cliff Richard released in 1965 (sixteenth album overall).[1] The album reached number 19 in the UK Album Charts[2] and is primarily made up of pop standards such as "Long Ago (And Far Away)", "Have I Told You Lately That I Love You", and "Someday (You'll Want Me To Want You)".

The album was produced primarily by Richard's usual producer Norrie Paramor, but two song's "Everyone Needs to Love Someone" and "Through the Eye of a Needle" were from Richard's August 1964 recording sessions in New York with Bob Morgan producing. Bob Morgan was from Epic Records, Richard's US record company at the time.[3][4]
