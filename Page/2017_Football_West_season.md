League tables

2017 National Premier League WA

The 2017 National Premier League WA season was played over 26 rounds commencing in February 2017, followed by a Top 4 Finals series. A revised Relegation system for the bottom team will depend on whether the two Division 1 teams that meet NPL WA eligibility criteria finish in the top 4 of the league season. If either come first, the bottom team will be relegated, but if one comes second, third or fourth, then there will be a Promotion/Relegation playoff.[1]
