MEXICO–TANZANIA RELATIONS refers to the diplomatic relations between Mexico and Tanzania.


History

Mexico and Tanzania established diplomatic relations on 19 February 1973.[1][2] That same year, in 1973, Mexico opened an embassy in the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam.[3] In April 1975, Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere paid a six-day official visit to Mexico.[4] During his visit, he met with Mexican President Luis Echeverría and they discussed the issues facing Africa at the time. Furthermore, President Nyerere asked Mexico to take an active role in assisting Tanzania with building their new capital at Dodoma by allowing architects, planners and students to come from Tanzania and study at Mexican universities and for Mexican technicians to travel to Tanzania to work in developing projects for the new capital.[5] Agreements were signed between both Presidents to deepen agricultural and trade relations between both nations.[6]

In July 1975, Mexican President Luis Echeverría paid a four-day state visit to Tanzania.[7] During President Echeverría's visit, he visited Serengeti National Park and the new capital of Dodoma.[8] Both nations signed an agreement to increase scholarships for up to 30 students to study in each nation and for Mexico to increase financial assistance to Tanzanian henequen farmers.[9]

Mexico and Tanzania are founding members of the Group of 77 and are mutual members of the United Nations and World Trade Organization. In 1980, Mexico closed it embassy in Tanzania due to financial restraints.[10] In 2009, Mexico became the first Latin American nation to be invited to attend and show at the Zanzibar International Film Festival, the best well known cultural event in East Africa.[11]
