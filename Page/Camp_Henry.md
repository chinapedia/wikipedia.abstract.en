CAMP HENRY is a U.S. military base in Daegu, South Korea. _Camp Henry_ was named in 1960 after First Lieutenant Frederick F. Henry, who served with F Company, 38th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division. Camp Henry is located in the Nam-gu District of Daegu City on 51 acres. It consists primarily of administrative buildings and community support facilities. The U.S. Army Garrison - Daegu, headquartered at Camp Henry in Daegu, manages the installation and provides base operations services for the people who live and or work at Camp Carroll. Major tenant units on Camp Henry are the 19th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary) and the 403rd Army Field Support Brigade—Korea (Provisional).


History

Built by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1921, what became known as Camp Henry served as the headquarters for Jirō Minami, Governor-General of Korea between 1936 and 1942, as well as Japanese forces stationed in the Daegu area. When Korea was liberated from Japan in 1945, the camp was taken over by the Republic of Korea Army. During the Korean War, the camp saw little action because of its location inside the northern edge of the Pusan Perimeter. After the Korean War, the camp was used by the United States. In May 1960, the camp was named after First Lieutenant Frederick Henry, a Korean War Medal of Honor recipient.[1]
