The ASEAN INTER-PARLIAMENTARY ASSEMBLY (AIPA), until 2007, the ASEAN INTER-PARLIAMENTARY ORGANIZATION (AIPO), is an organization founded in 1977, which is grouped with, but formally associated with ASEAN.[1] Its creation was initiated by Indonesia, with the support of other members of the ASEAN 5 founding members.[2]

It met for the first time in 1978 in Singapore. It is a weak, transnational parliamentary assembly that only has consultative powers, and lacks legislative and oversight powers over ASEAN and its members.[3]

It has over 300 members from ASEAN members. Brunei (and previously Myanmar) which does not have a legislature, attend as Special Observers to AIPA.[4] In 2007, it changed its name from the ASEAN Inter Parliamentary Organization (AIPO) to ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly (AIPA).[5]

Since 1979, it has held semi-regular bilateral meetings with the European Parliament.[6]
