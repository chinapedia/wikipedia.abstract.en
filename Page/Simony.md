speaks to Pope Nicholas III, committed to the _Inferno_ for his simony, in Gustave Doré's 1861 wood engraving (portrait of the Third Bolgia of the Eighth Circle of Hell)]] SIMONY is the act of selling church offices and roles. It is named after Simon Magus,[1] who is described in the Acts of the Apostles as having offered two disciples of Jesus payment in exchange for their empowering him to impart the power of the Holy Spirit to anyone on whom he would place his hands. The term extends to other forms of trafficking for money in "spiritual things."[2][3]

The appointment of ecclesiastical officials, such as bishops and abbots, by a secular authority came to be considered simoniacal and this became a key issue during the Investiture Controversy.


Catholic Church

Although an offense against canon law, simony became widespread in the Catholic Church in the 9th and 10th centuries.[4] In the canon law, the word bears a more extended meaning than in English law. "Simony according to the canonists", says John Ayliffe in his _Parergon_,

, ca 1520

]] In the _Corpus Juris Canonici_, the _Decretum_[5] and the Decretals of Gregory IX[6] dealt with the subject. The offender whether _simoniacus_ (the perpetrator of a simoniacal transaction) or _simoniace promotus_ (the beneficiary of a simoniacal transaction), was liable to deprivation of his benefice and deposition from orders if a secular priest, or to confinement in a stricter monastery if a regular. No distinction seems to have been drawn between the sale of an immediate and of a reversionary interest. The innocent _simoniace promotus_ was, apart from dispensation, liable to the same penalties as though he were guilty.

Certain matters were simoniacal by the canon law but would not be regarded as such in English law. So grave was the crime of simony considered that even infamous persons (deprived of citizens' rights due to conviction) could accuse another of it. English provincial and legatine constitutions continually assailed simony.

In 1494 a member of the Carmelite order, Adam of Genoa was found murdered in his bed with twenty wounds after preaching against the practice of simony.[7]

In literature

In the 14th century, Dante Alighieri depicted the punishment of many "clergymen, and popes and cardinals" in hell for being avaricious or miserly.[8]

He also criticised certain popes and other simoniacs:[9]


Church of England

The Church of England struggled with the practice after its separation from Rome. For the purposes of English law, simony is defined by William Blackstone as "obtain[ing] orders, or a licence to preach, by money or corrupt practices"[10] or, more narrowly, "the corrupt presentation of any one to an ecclesiastical benefice for gift or reward".[11] While English law recognized simony as an offence,[12] it treated it as merely an ecclesiastical matter, rather than a crime, for which the punishment was forfeiture of the office or any advantage from the offence and severance of any patronage relationship with the person who bestowed the office. Both Edward VI and Elizabeth I promulgated statutes against simony, in the latter case through the Simony Act 1588. The cases of Bishop of St. David's Thomas Watson in 1699[13] and of Dean of York William Cockburn in 1841 were particularly notable.[14]

By the Benefices Act 1892, a person guilty of simony is guilty of an offence for which he may be proceeded against under the Clergy Discipline Act 1892. An innocent clerk is under no disability, as he might be by the canon law. Simony may be committed in three ways – in promotion to orders, in presentation to a benefice, and in resignation of a benefice. The common law (with which the canon law is incorporated, as far as it is not contrary to the common or statute law or the prerogative of the Crown) has been considerably modified by statute. Where no statute applies to the case, the doctrines of the canon law may still be of authority.

, simony remains an offence.[15][16] An unlawfully bestowed office can be declared void by the Crown, and the offender can be disabled from making future appointments and fined up to £1000.[17] Clergy are no longer required to make a declaration as to simony on ordination, but offences are now likely to be dealt with under the Clergy Discipline Measure 2003,[18] r.8.[19]
