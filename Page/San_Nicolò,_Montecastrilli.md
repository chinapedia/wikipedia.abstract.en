SAN NICOLÃ’ is a Roman Catholic church located in the town of Montecastrilli, in the province of Terni, region of Umbria, Italy.


History

A church was present at the site since the 10th or 11th century. The present church with a Latin cross layout houses a _Last Supper_ (1602) by Archita Ricci da Urbino. Thirteen panels in the chapel of the Holiest Rosary are attributed to Andrea Polinori; two are nineteenth century works. The chapel houses a _Madonna of the Rosary_ (1606) also by Ricci. An altarpiece depicting _Saints Anthony and Lucy_ (1629) in the chapel dedicated to the saints, was painted by Bartolomeo Poliziano.

The left transept houses a painting of the _Madonna of the "Refugium Peccatorum"_ (late 1500s) transferred here from the suppressed parish church of Castelfranco. The baptismal font is dated 1578. [1]
