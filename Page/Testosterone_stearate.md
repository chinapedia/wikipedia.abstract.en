TESTOSTERONE STEARATE, also known as TESTOSTERONE OCTADECANOATE, TESTOSTERONE 17Β-STEARATE, and ANDROST-4-EN-17Β-OL-3-ONE 17Β-STEARATE, is an injected anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and an androgen ester – specifically, the C17β stearate (octadecanoate) ester of testosterone – which was never marketed.[1][2] It is a prodrug of testosterone and, when administered via intramuscular injection, is associated with a long-lasting depot effect and extended duration of action.[3] Testosterone stearate may occur naturally in the body.[4]

It has been said that with longer-chain esters of testosterone like testosterone stearate, the duration of action may be so protracted that the magnitude of effect with typical doses may be too low to be appreciable.[5]
