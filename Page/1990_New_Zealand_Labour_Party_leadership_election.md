The NEW ZEALAND LABOUR PARTY LEADERSHIP ELECTION, 1990 was held to determine the leadership of the New Zealand Labour Party. The leadership was won by MP Mike Moore.


Background

By 1990 the Labour Party had been torn apart by internal frictions between the supporters of Rogernomics (open market free trade policy) and those still favouring Labour's traditional protectionist fiscal policies. There had been two leadership challenges in the past 12 months with opponents of Rogernomics being successful. However Labour's popularity had fallen further still due to the increasing public outrage over the reforms. After seeing off a challenge from Roger Douglas in 1988, David Lange had resigned mid-1989 and replaced with Geoffrey Palmer who, while respected, was unpopular. Palmer was persuaded to step aside in favour of a more suitable candidate more capable of lessening the damage of what was already being predicted as a certain defeat for Labour.


Candidates

Mike Moore

Moore was one of the senior cabinet ministers in the government and was ranked third in Labour's caucus. He was a supporter of the Rogernomics reforms, albeit less radical. As a result he was seen as a more acceptable alternative leader to both Douglas and his supporters as well as critics of Douglas. He had previously stood for the leadership in 1989 against Palmer but was defeated.

Richard Northey

Northey, an MP serving since 1984, was a surprise candidate to most. He was the sitting member for and was not a member of cabinet. Many saw his candidature as merely token and he was viewed as a stalking horse like figure.


Result

A caucus vote was held on 4 September 1990 in which Moore was successful. Helen Clark, Palmer's deputy leader retained her position despite the change in leaders.

Northey lost his seat in the 1990 election, but returned in 1993 only to be defeated again in 1996.
