_ULTIMATE BEASTMASTER_ is an American sports entertainment reality show competition that premiered on Netflix on February 24, 2017. The show differentiates itself from other obstacle course competition shows by showcasing not only international talent, but by producing six localized versions, featuring select television hosts, actors, comedians and athletes as commentators from the six countries competing in the show. Reactions from all countries' hosts appear in each localized versions, especially during course clearing victories. Each season consists of 10 episodes, released simultaneously on Netflix worldwide.[1] The first season premiered on February 24, 2017, while the second season aired on December 15, 2017.

In February 2018 the show was renewed for a third season, consisting of nine episodes,[2] which premiered on August 31, 2018.[3]


Premise

In each episode, there are twelve contestants (2 from each country) who run a new obstacle course known as “The Beast”. The winner is crowned “Beastmaster”. Each of the "Beastmasters" from the nine Beastmaster episodes will go forward to a final course, to become the Ultimate Beastmaster.[4] Starting in Season 3, each show featured nine competitors (one from each country in the competition). The two competitors with the highest score in the final stage moved onto one of two semi-finals. The top three from each semi-final moved to the final episode to be crowned Ultimate Beastmaster.

Not only do each pair of hosts provide color commentary for each of the 6-9 localized versions, but the foreign commentators also make appearances in each localized version, with their commentary presented by subtitles. If a contestant completes a course, all hosts' reactions are shown on screen. Furthermore, since all host booths are placed in a row on the _Ultimate Beastmaster_ set, commentators from one localization can easily walk over into the booth of another localized version.

Reception

James Hibberd compares the first season of _Ultimate Beastmaster_ to _American Ninja Warrior_ in a mixed review of the shows. Hibberd praises _Ultimate Beastmaster_{{'}}s "gorgeous superstructure" of a course, the international rivalry aspect and concise contestant profile clips, but criticizes the show's commentators and the repetitiveness of the course, the latter of which _American Ninja Warrior_ avoids.[12]
