is a Japanese manga artist. She is best known as the author of _Sailor Moon,_ one of the most-popular manga series of all time.[1]

She has won several awards, including the 1993 Kodansha Manga Award for _Sailor Moon_.[2]


Early life

Takeuchi was born in Kofu, Yamanashi, Japan, to parents Kenji and Ikuko Takeuchi. She has a younger brother, Shingo. She gave the names of her relatives to the characters she created for _Sailor Moon_, and mentions this in interviews and in several comic strips she produced in place of author notes.

Takeuchi attended Kofu Ichi High School.[3] She wore sailor suit uniforms and joined the astronomy and manga clubs.[4] These experiences influenced her work for _Sailor Moon_, in addition to her other pieces such as _Love Call_ and _Rain Kiss_. Her formative high school experiences influenced her trajectory to become a manga artist. Takeuchi's father encouraged her to pursue other career paths in case she wouldn't find success as a professional artist, which is why she attended university to study chemistry.

Takeuchi graduated from Kyoritsu University of Pharmacy, where she received a degree in chemistry and became a licensed pharmacist. Her senior thesis was called "Heightened Effects of Thrombolytic Actions Due to Ultrasound".[5]


Career

1986–1997: Early work and success

Before becoming a manga artist, Takeuchi worked as a miko at the Shiba Daijingu shrine near her university.[6] This experience later became the basis for one of her characters in _Sailor Moon_, Rei Hino.[7]

After graduating from Kyoritsu University of Pharmacy, at the age of 19, Takeuchi entered the manga industry by submitting to Kodansha her work _Love Call_, which received an award. She worked steadily on one-shot pieces until writing _Maria_, which was published in _Nakayoshi_ from early to mid-1990. She based this work, her first serial comic, loosely on _Daddy-Long-Legs_ and on her friend Marie Koizumi, who helped her write it.

After completing _Maria_, Takeuchi worked on the ice-skating series _The Cherry Project_ which was serialized in _Nakayoshi_ from late 1990 to 1991. While working on _The Cherry Project_, Takeuchi wanted to do a manga on outer space and girl fighters. Her editor, Fumio Osano, asked her to put the fighters in sailor-suits. This concept would later become a one-shot called _Codename: Sailor V_, which would later begin serialization in _RunRun_. When Toei Animation planned to adapt her manga into an anime series, she reworked _Sailor V_ and added four other superheroines.

In December 1991 _Nakayoshi_ began serializing _Sailor Moon_, which became an instant hit. The success encouraged Takeuchi to work on both _Sailor Moon_ and _Sailor V_ from 1991 to 1997. However, _RunRun_ was canceled with the November 1997 issue, and the planned _Sailor V_ anime adaptation was canceled with it.[8] During that 6-year period, she produced 52 chapters that were collected in 18 volumes. The success of the manga led to two anime adaptations, three animated films, a live-action adaptation, numerous video games, and wide-ranging merchandising.

At the series' end, Takeuchi worked on _PQ Angels_ for _Nakayoshi_. This gained a fair amount of popularity but was canceled due to Kodansha losing seven pages of her manuscript. Takeuchi said that Toei Animation had the manuscript, therefore it would have been possible to create an anime adaptation of the series.[9]

Takeuchi's own studio is called "Princess Naoko Planning" (PNP). Takeuchi established PNP to manage her properties, mainly _Sailor Moon_. The studio later encompassed Yoshihiro Togashi's work as well and appeared in the credits for such anime as _Level E_ and _Hunter × Hunter_. Its name also appears on the musical credits for _Shin Kaguya Shima Densetsu_ and other projects.

1997–present

Following the loss of seven pages of Takeuchi's _PQ Angels_ manuscript, Osano departed Kodansha and the plans for the _Materials Collection_ were canceled.[10] Takeuchi departed Kodansha for Shueisha.[11]

On August 13, 1998, Takeuchi made her first appearance in the United States at the San Diego Comic-Con International convention for three days.[12] That same year, she published the first _Sailor Moon_ art book since her departure from Kodansha, _Sailor Moon Infinity Collection Art Book_ with limited releases.

While working on her short comic strip _Princess Naoko Takeuchi Back-to-Work Punch!!_, Takeuchi met Yoshihiro Togashi at a _Weekly Shōnen Jump_ meeting hosted by Kazushi Hagiwara, and had a meeting arranged between them by voice actress Megumi Ogata.[13][14] She collaborated with Togashi as an assistant (doing screentone) and as a manager on volume 1 of _Hunter × Hunter_. However the work and the demands proved more than she had expected, and Takeuchi left Shueisha as a result.

Around this time Takeuchi conceived the idea for a one-shot called _Toki*Meka_, which eventually turned into _Toki*Meca_.[15] Togashi had a similar idea at the same time as her, but never fully brought it to fruition. He helped somewhat with _Toki*Meka_ at this point in developing the idea by drawing some concept sketches, which Takeuchi showed in _Toki*Meca_ volume 1.

Togashi and Takeuchi married in 1999. From this marriage, the couple have two children: a son, born in January 2001, and another child, born in 2009.[16]

After Kodansha's rights to _Sailor Moon_ expired, Takeuchi returned to the publisher in 1999 to develop and publish the _Materials Collection_. She also began serializing _Love Witch_, but it was cancelled. Takeuchi started to work on the reprints of _Sailor Moon_ and _Sailor V_, and published _Toki*Meca_ in _Nakayoshi_.

In 2003 Takeuchi became heavily involved in producing _Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon_, a tokusatsu television series based on _Sailor Moon_. Takeuchi had an interest in learning more about the anime industry.[17] This culminated in the creation of _Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon_. The series displays a plot that is heavily reliant on the manga and also explores many themes that the manga was unable to explore. She showed up at the official conference with a fist up, meaning "good luck", in Act Zero.

After the production of _Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon_ ended in 2004, Takeuchi continued to work on _Toki*Meca_. During the manga's serialization, Osano returned as her editor.[18] Takeuchi also worked more closely with managing PNP and gave talks to college students.[19] At the same time, she wrote a children's book titled _Oboo-nu- to Chiboo-nu-_ as a birthday present to her son. (Togashi illustrated the children's book. She made mention of it in the back of volume 1 of _Toki*Meca_.) She still works on the website, updating it about once a month with new flash animations or profiles.[20]

In 2012 it was announced that a new _Sailor Moon_ anime adaptation was in development.[21] With it, Takeuchi started a _Kanzenban_ version of the manga which was announced by Osano, which will include fixed mistakes from the past and new covers for the manga. Color pages are also included for the title pages. There was also an artbook announced and she has been working on merchandise which was announced by Osano on his Twitter feed.

| _Codename: Sailor V_ (コードネームはセーラーＶ _Kōdonēmu wa Sērā Bui_)            | 1991–1997 | This series follows the adventures of costumed "magical girl" Sailor V. It directly preceded (and became something of a prototype for) _Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon_, introducing Minako Aino, alias "Sailor V", who would become a significant character in the latter series. Takeuchi concluded the series she had already finished _Sailor Moon_; ''Sailor V ''featured an ending that tied the two series together. Originally released in 3 volumes, _Codename: Sailor V_ was re-released in 2004 in a deluxe two-volume "Renewal Edition" (新装版 _Shinzōban_) format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| _Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon_ (美少女戦士セーラームーン _Bishōjo Senshi Sērā Mūn_) | 1992–1997 | Known to International audiences simply as _Sailor Moon_, this manga became Naoko Takeuchi's most famous work and spawned an anime, several films, stage musicals, a live-action television series and video games of various genres. A fusion of styles between the _mahō shōjo_ and _sentai_ genres, _Sailor Moon_ tells the story of Usagi Tsukino, a girl who discovers one day her identity as the reincarnation of a celestial heroine fighting for love and justice. This series was largely responsible for the late-1990s resurgence of "magical girl" anime and manga. The series was originally released in 18 volumes but was re-released in 2003 and 2004 in a deluxe 12-volume "Renewal Edition" (新装版 _Shinzōban_) format, with two supplementary volumes containing side stories to the main work. Characters from her previous work, Codename Sailor V, return in this one. |

| _PQ Angels_ (PQエンジェルス _PQ Enjerusu_)                                        | 1997      | Features two alien girls, able to turn into cockroaches, who are searching for their princess. The series was a complete disaster for Takeuchi: it was discontinued abruptly after only 4 chapters, and Kodansha lost the proofs of the portion that had been written. It has therefore only appeared in its original serialization, from September to December 1997.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
