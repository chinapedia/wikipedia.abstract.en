BHIMDATTA PANTA (Nepali:भिमदत्त पन्त) was a revolutionary leader and farmer martyr from Dadeldhura District, Nepal. He was raising protest in the favour of peasants and oppressed farmers in the Far-Western Region by landlord elite Thakuris. He was martyred with the charges of treason by Local Elites on 1953 A.D aged 27. He has town named after him Bhimdatta Municipality in Kanchanpur district (until 2008 the town was namned Mahendranagar). [1]


Background

Born to Taranath Panta and Saraswati Devi on 10th of Mangshir of Vikram Samvat Calendar, Bhimdatta was educated in India. He then went on to establish schools and pathshala in Far Western Nepal.


Political career

He began his political career with participating in Bharat Chhodo Aandolan as a cadre. He then returned to Nepal and joined Nepali Congress in 2006 BS After dispute with Congressmen, he left to Nepal Communist Party in 2009 BS.

He revolted against Elites by _Noon Aandolan_ (Salt Protest) distributing salts from Bramhadev Mandi to poor peasants. He began armed rebellions against Elites whose mission was to eliminate feudalism, caste-based discrimination and oppression of farmers. His quote in Nepali: _कि जोत हलो, कि छोड थलो, हैन भने छैन अब भलो_ translates _Either plough the fields or leave it, else you may have to pay the cost_. The quotation was against landlords of Far Western who oppressed the poor farmers. His army squads were eliminating corrupt government officials and tyrant feudal Thakuris and distributed the salts and foods to farmers. He rose as Robinhood of Far-Western Nepal. The attack was outmatching Nepal Government and a cunning strategy was webbed to bring Indian armed forces to kill Bhimdatta. Bhimdatta 's strategy was unmatched unless exposed by friends. He was killed gruesomely in Jogbudha forest and the Thakuri feudals hung his bodyless head in a market of Dadeldhura.[2] A Nepali movie _Bhimdatta_ was released about his story.[3]
