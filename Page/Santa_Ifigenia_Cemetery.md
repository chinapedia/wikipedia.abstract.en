'''Santa Ifigenia Cemetery ''' (Spanish: CEMENTERIO SANTA IFIGENIA) is a cemetery in Santiago de Cuba and resting place of a few notable Cubans.

The cemetery opened in 1868 to replace smaller Cemetery of Santa Ana.[1]

The signature resting place is that of José Martí, whose mausoleum is guarded by three Cuban soldiers at the entrance. Cuban leader Fidel Castro's ashes are also buried at the cemetery.

The cemetery is reached by public transit from bus stops across Avenida Capitán Raúl Perozo. Parking is available for buses at the entrance of the cemetery.
