MOZZARELLA (, ; ) is a traditionally southern Italian cheese made from Italian buffalo's milk by the pasta filata method. Mozzarella received a Traditional Specialities Guaranteed certification from the European Union in 1998. This protection scheme requires that mozzarella sold in the European Union is produced according to a traditional recipe.

The TSG certification does not specify the source of the milk, so any type of milk can be used, but it is speculated that it is normally made from whole milk.[1] In Italy, mozzarella made from the milk of the Italian water buffalo is an important variety; the Italian _buffalo mozzarella_ sold as _Mozzarella di Bufala Campana_ is protected under the EU's Protected Designation of Origin scheme and may only be produced in select locations in the regions of Campania, Lazio, Apulia and Molise.[2][3]

Fresh mozzarella is generally white, but may vary seasonally, to slightly yellow, depending on the animal's diet.[4] Due to its high moisture content, it is traditionally served the day after it is made,[5] but can be kept in brine for up to a week,[6] or longer when sold in vacuum-sealed packages. _Low-moisture mozzarella_ can be kept refrigerated for up to a month,[7] though some shredded low-moisture mozzarella is sold with a shelf life of up to six months.[8] Mozzarella of several kinds is used for most types of pizza and several pasta dishes, or served with sliced tomatoes and basil in Caprese salad.


Etymology

_Mozzarella,_ derived from the Neapolitan dialect spoken in Campania, is the diminutive form of ("cut"), or ("to cut off") derived from the method of working.[9] The term is first mentioned in 1570, cited in a cookbook by Bartolomeo Scappi, reading "milk cream, fresh butter, ricotta cheese, fresh mozzarella and milk".[10] An earlier reference is also often cited as describing mozzarella. Historian Monsignor Alicandri, in "Chiesa Metropolitana di Capua," states that in the 12th century the Monastery of Saint Lorenzo, in Capua, Campania offered pilgrims a piece of bread with mozza or provatura. These are locations rather than products and mozza is taken by some to be mozzarella.[11]


Types

Mozzarella, recognised as a Specialità Tradizionale Garantita (STG) since 1996,[12] is available fresh, usually rolled into a ball of or about in diameter, and sometimes up to or about diameter. It is soaked in salt water (brine) or whey, and other times citric acid is added and it is partly dried (desiccated), its structure being more compact. In this last form it is often used to prepare dishes cooked in the oven, such as lasagna and pizza.

When twisted to form a plait mozzarella is called . Mozzarella is also available in smoked () and reduced-moisture, packaged varieties.

_Ovolini_ refers to smaller-sized bocconcini, and sometimes to cherry bocconcini.[13]


Variants

Several variants have been specifically formulated and prepared for use on pizza, such as low-moisture Mozzarella cheese.[14][15] The _International Dictionary of Food and Cooking_ defines this cheese as "a soft spun-curd cheese similar to Mozzarella made from cow's milk" that is "[u]sed particularly for pizzas and [that] contains somewhat less water than real Mozzarella".[16]

Low-moisture part-skim mozzarella, widely used in the food-service industry, has a low galactose content, per some consumers' preference for cheese on pizza to have low or moderate browning.[17][18] Some pizza cheeses derived from skim mozzarella variants were designed not to require aging or the use of starter.[19] Others can be made through the direct acidification of milk.[20]

Buffalo's milk

In Italy, the cheese is produced nationwide using Italian buffalo's milk under the government's official name _Mozzarella di latte di bufala_ because Italian buffalo is in all Italian regions. Only selected _Mozzarella di bufala campana PDO_ is a type, made from the milk of Italian buffalo, raised in designated areas of Campania, Lazio, Apulia, and Molise. Unlike other mozzarellas—50% of whose production derives from non-Italian and often semi-coagulated milk[21]—it holds the status of a protected designation of origin (PDO 1996) under the European Union.

Cow's milk

_Fior di latte_ is made from fresh pasteurized or unpasteurized cow's milk and not water buffalo milk, which greatly lowers its cost. Outside the EU, "mozzarella" not clearly labeled as deriving from water buffalo can be presumed to derive from cow milk. _Mozzarella affumicata_ means smoked mozzarella.

Sheep's milk

Mozzarella of sheep milk, sometimes called "mozzarella pecorella", is typical of Sardinia, Abruzzo and Lazio, where it is also called 'mozzapecora'. It is worked with the addition of the rennet of lamb.[22][23][24]

Goat's milk

Mozzarella of goat's milk is of recent origin and the producers are still few; among the reasons for this new production is the need to offer a kind of mozzarella to those who do not digest cow's milk, because goat's milk is more digestible.[25]


Production

Mozzarella di bufala is traditionally produced solely from the milk of the Italian Mediterranean buffalo. A whey starter is added from the previous batch that contains thermophilic bacteria, and the milk is left to ripen so the bacteria can multiply. Then, rennet is added to coagulate the milk. After coagulation, the curd is cut into large, 1"–2" pieces, and left to sit so the curds firm up in a process known as healing.

After the curd heals, it is further cut into 3/8"–1/2" large pieces. The curds are stirred and heated to separate the curds from the whey. The whey is then drained from the curds and the curds are placed in a hoop to form a solid mass. The curd mass is left until the pH is at around 5.2–5.5, which is the point when the cheese can be stretched and kneaded to produce a delicate consistency—this process is generally known as pasta filata. According to the Mozzarella di Bufala trade association, "The cheese-maker kneads it with his hands, like a baker making bread, until he obtains a smooth, shiny paste, a strand of which he pulls out and lops off, forming the individual mozzarella."[26] It is then typically formed into cylinder shapes or in plait. In Italy, a "rubbery" consistency is generally considered not satisfactory; the cheese is expected to be softer.

[18] Galactose is a type of sugar found in dairy products and other foods that is less sweet than glucose. Sugar in foods can lead to caramelization when they are cooked, which increases their browning.
