_ANTI-HEROES_ is an album by saxophonist Lee Konitz and pianist Gil Evans recorded in New York in 1980 and released on the French Verve label.[1][2][3]


Critical reception

The Allmusic review stated "the music is rather disappointing for, although Konitz plays fairly well on the mixture of standards and obscurities, Evans often wanders and his backing of the saxophonist is sparse and erratic. The results are more important historically than musically".[4]
