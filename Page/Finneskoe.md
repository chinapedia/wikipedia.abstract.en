"Truge"_and_"Finnesko".jpg FINNESKOE (also known as FINNESKO) is a soft hide boot used for cold climate travel. Because it is soft, the Finneskoe will not freeze as solidly as thick boot leather. It can be relatively easy to put on after overnight exposure to subzero temperatures.[1]

Originally from Lapland, Finneskoe were traditionally made from reindeer skin stuffed with grass (such as sennegrass) for insulation and water absorption. From 1890, they are regularly mentioned in accounts of polar travel.[2][3]

The name "Finneskoe" comes from the Norwegian _Finn_ (Lapp) + _sko_ (shoe).[4] This type of boot made by the Sami people of Norway are called _Skaller_.[5]
