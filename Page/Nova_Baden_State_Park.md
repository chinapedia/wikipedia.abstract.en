Environment

The park holds Atlantic Forest flora and fauna. Tree species include jequitibá, cedro, peroba, palmito, jacarandá, pinheiro brasileiro and cedro. The highest trees are from high. The climate is moist, creating an ecosystem rich in mosses, lichens, bromeliads and orchids. There are diverse lichens growing on the trees. These are sensitive to air pollution and drastic changes to the environment, so their presence indicates that air quality is good. There is a marshy area in the park with an exotic ornamental called marsh lily, and many species of herbaceous shrubs and trees of different families.

The park is an important refuge for several species of amphibians, mammals and birds. There are 22 species of mammals. Primates include howler monkeys, titis, micos and robust capuchin monkeys. There are ocelot (_Leopardus pardalis_), coatis, armadillos and southern tamandua (_Tamandua tetradactyla_). There are also Brazilian squirrel (_Sciurus aestuans_), tapeti (_Sylvilagus brasiliensis_), oncilla (_Leopardus tigrinus_), maned wolf (_Chrysocyon brachyurus_), cougar (_Puma concolor_) and buffy-tufted marmoset (_Callithrix aurita_).

78 species of birds have been identified from 30 families and 14 orders. Birds include drab-breasted bamboo tyrant (_Hemitriccus diops_), variable antshrike (_Thamnophilus caerulescens_), olivaceous woodcreeper (_Sittasomus griseicapillus_), blue dacnis (_Dacnis cayana_), blue manakin (_Chiroxiphia caudata_), robust woodpecker (_Campephilus robustus_), red-ruffed fruitcrow (_Pyroderus scutatus_), shrike-like laniisoma (_Laniisoma elegans_), saffron finch (_Sicalis flaveola_), wedge-tailed grass finch (_Emberizoides herbicola_) and yellow-faced siskin (_Spinus yarrellii_). The insect _pachymeroceroides novabadensis_, which prefers a very humid environment, was first discovered in the park.


Facilities

The park has a visitor center in a 19th-century mansion that was once home of the engineer, writer and politician Américo Werneck, whose family came from Baden-Baden, Germany, and whose land became the park. It includes an auditorium for 90 people, meeting rooms and an environmental police post. The headquarters has gardens, lawns and a small playground for children. There are three trails, each taking less than an hour. One leads to the Sete Quedas waterfall and passes a _jequitibá_ tree more than 300 years old. The others lead through interesting forest areas and over watercourses. There is no camping area or visitor accommodations. As of 2016 the park was open from 08:00 to 17:00 on Tuesdays to Sundays and holidays.
