History

The stone church was built between the 11th and 13th centuries. It has a circular layout with a low tiled dome showing the influence of Byzantine style. Semicircular chapels help buttress the dome. The bell tower retains 14th century-frescoes, while the church has an altarpiece depicting the Madonna del Rosario by Venanzio da Camerino. Another altarpiece depicting an _Enthroned Madonna and Child_ dates to the mid 13th-century. The mid-16th century crucifix is attributed to Tobia da Camerino.[1]
