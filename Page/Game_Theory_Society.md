-   The Morgenstern Lecture is delivered by an individual who has made important contributions in game theory with significant economic content.
-   The von Neumann Lecture is delivered an individual who has made important developments in game theory that are of significant mathematical interest.

In addition, the society awards the Kalai Prize to a person (or persons) who have published a significant paper at the interface of game theory and computer science.[1]
