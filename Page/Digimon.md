_DIGIMON_ ( _Dejimon_, branded as _DIGIMON: DIGITAL MONSTERS_, stylized as _DIGIMON_), short for "Digital Monsters" ( _Dejitaru Monsutā_), is a Japanese media franchise encompassing virtual pet toys, anime, manga, video games, films and a trading card game. The franchise focuses on Digimon creatures, which are monsters living in a "Digital World", a parallel universe that originated from Earth's various communication networks.

The franchise was first created in 1997 as a series of virtual pets, akin to—and influenced in style by—the contemporary Tamagotchi or nano Giga Pet toys. The creatures were first designed to look cute and iconic even on the devices' small screens; later developments had them created with a harder-edged style influenced by American comics. The franchise gained momentum with its first anime incarnation, _Digimon Adventure_, and an early video game, _Digimon World_, both released in 1999. Several seasons of the anime and films based on them have aired, and the video game series has expanded into genres such as role-playing, racing, fighting, and MMORPGs. Other media forms have also been released.


Conception and creation

,[1] that allowed the popularization of Digimon in Japan. It sold units in Japan and overseas, up until March 2004.[2]]]

In 1996, the Tamagotchi was released, created by Akihiro Yokoi, Aki Maita and Takeichi Hongo. The Tamagotchi was one of the inspirations for the first release of the Digimon franchise,[3][4] a device marketed in June 1997[5][6] with the name Digimon,[7] a short for _Digital Monster_.[8][9] Aiming at the male audience and created by Akiyoshi Hongo (a pseudonym that refers to the creators of _Tamagotchi_),[10] this device shows to players a virtual pet composed entirely of data and designed to play and fight.[11][12][13][14] In February 1998, the _DigiMon_ fighting game, compatible with Windows 95 and developed by Rapture Technologies, Inc., was announced.[15] The one-shot manga _C'mon Digimon_, designed by Tenya Yabuno, was published in the Japanese magazine V-Jump by Shueisha in 1997.[16][17]

A second generation of _virtual pets_ was marketed six months after the launch of the first, followed by a third in 1998.[18] Each player starts with a baby-level digital creature that has a limited number of attacks and transformations[19] and to make the creature stronger by training and nourishing the creature;[20][21] when the player is successful in a workout, the Digimon becomes strong, when the player fails, the Digimon becomes weak.[22][23] Two devices can be connected, allowing two players to battle with their respective creatures, an innovation at the time,[24] however, the battle is only possible from the moment the creature is in the child level or bigger.[25] Playgrounds and subways were where the majority of users of the apparatus were concentrated; The virtual pet was banned in some Asian schools by being considered by parents and teachers as very noisy and violent.[26] The first Digimon were created by Japanese designer Kenji Watanabe, influenced by American comics, which were beginning to gain popularity in Japan, and as such began to make his characters look stronger and "cool." Other types of Digimon, which until the year 2000 totaled 279,[27][28] came from extensive discussions and collaborations between the Bandai company members.[29] There are currently over 1300 Digimon.


Eponymous creatures

Digimon hatch from types of eggs which are called . In the English iterations of the franchise there is another type of Digi-Egg that can be used to digivolve, or transform, Digimon. This second type of Digi-Egg is called a in Japanese. They age via a process called "Digivolution" which changes their appearance and increases their powers. The effect of Digivolution, however, is not permanent in the partner Digimon of the main characters in the anime, and Digimon who have digivolved will most of the time revert to their previous form after a battle or if they are too weak to continue. Some Digimon act feral. Most, however, are capable of intelligence and human speech. They are able to digivolve by the use of Digivices that their human partners have. A further level has since been used in the video games, even higher than Mega, known as _Ultra_ in the dub.

Distribution and localization

In the United States, the series premiered in August 1999 on the Fox Broadcasting Company. It was dubbed by Saban Entertainment (later Sensation Animation), and was initially broadcast through Fox Kids. The first four series were collectively retitled _Digimon: Digital Monsters_.[37] Some scenes from the original version were modified or omitted in order to comply with Fox's standards and practices. The show also featured more jokes and added dialogue, along with a completely different musical score. As a cross-promotional stunt, 2001 and 2002 saw _Digi-Bowl_ specials co-produced with Fox Sports; _NFL on Fox_ commentator Terry Bradshaw provided interstitial segments in-between episodes as if the episodes were actually a football game.[38]

After Disney acquired Saban during _Digimon: Digital Monsters (Season 3)_, the first three series moved to the cable network ABC Family, while the fourth (_Frontier_) premiered on UPN due to a deal between Disney and UPN.[39] UPN aired the show until late August 2003, when they severed their ties to Disney.[40] _Frontier_ aired on ABC Family concurrently, and reran (alongside the first three seasons) on that channel and Toon Disney (for the latter under the Jetix branding) for several years after. _Digimon Data Squad_ also had a brief run on Toon Disney/Jetix and successor Disney XD. Toei Animation has however released an official subtitled version of _Digimon Xros Wars_. Funimation Entertainment has online streaming rights to subtitled versions of _Digimon Adventure 02_ and _Digimon Tamers_.

In September 2012, Saban Brands announced it had re-acquired the _Digimon_ franchise.[41][42][43] In February 2013, Saban acquired _Digimon Fusion_ for broadcast on Nickelodeon in the United States starting September 7, 2013.[44] After three episodes, the show was moved to Nicktoons starting October 13, 2013.

_Digimon Adventure_ and its two sequels, _Digimon Adventure 02_ and _Digimon Tamers_, were added to the Netflix Instant Streaming service in 2013 and 2014 with Japanese audio and English subtitles. Crunchyroll began streaming the English-subtitled version of _Digimon Fusion_ outside Japan in November 2011. The English-localized version of its first season became available on Netflix starting September 13, 2014, followed by the second season on March 8, 2016.[45] After Crunchyroll acquired streaming rights to the dubbed versions and Funimation acquired rights to the subtitled versions, the dubbed versions of _Adventure_, _Adventure 02_, and _Tamers_ were briefly removed from Netflix.

In Canada, the English versions were broadcast on YTV, but only the first 26 episodes of _Digimon Fusion_ were shown. The dubbed version of _Data Squad_ aired on Family Channel. In the United Kingdom, _Digimon: Digital Monsters_ first aired in the UK on subscription cable/satellite channel Fox Kids but gained most popularity on terrestrial channel ITV's children's slot CITV from 2001-2002, which broadcast _Adventure_, _Adventure 02_ and a small amount of _Tamers_ airing during after school hours. The entirety of _Tamers_ aired on cable/satellite channel Fox Kids from 2002–04. _Digimon Frontier_ was originally announced on Jetix but was later dropped. The series eventually saw a release on October 29, 2018.[46] From 2011, _Digimon Data Squad_ (the fifth series/season) airs in the UK on Kix! (the show's sole provider). According to Fox Kids' (2000–03) and Kix's (2010-) BARB Television ratings, _Adventure_, _Adventure 02_ & _Tamers_ have been the most popular series'/seasons in the United Kingdom and was consistently in the weekly top 10 broadcasts for both channels for new episodes.[47] Broadcast rights and merchandising sub-licensing rights for Digimon Fusion in the UK have been acquired by ITV Studios Global Entertainment, Digimon Fusion has aired since Spring 2014 on Digital Terrestrial Channel, CITV.[48][49]

Yuen Wong Yu manhua

A Chinese manhua was written and drawn by Yuen Wong Yu (余 遠鍠 _Yu Yuen-wong_), who based its storyline on the television series. This adaptation covers _Digimon Adventure_ in five volumes, _Digimon Adventure 02_ in two, _Digimon Tamers_ in four, and _Digimon Frontier_ in three. The original stories are heavily abridged, though on rare occasions events play out differently from the anime. The Chinese language version was published by Rightman Publishing Ltd. in Hong Kong. Yu also wrote _D-Cyber_.

Two English versions were also released. The first one was published by Chuang Yi in Singapore. The second one, which was adapted by Lianne Sentar,[50] was released by TOKYOPOP in North America.
The three volumes for _Digimon Frontier_ have been released by Chuang Yi in English. These have not been released by TOKYOPOP in North America or Europe. However, the Chuang Yi releases of _Digimon Frontier_ were distributed by Madman Entertainment in Australia.

Dark Horse

Dark Horse Comics published American-style Digimon comic books, adapting the first thirteen episodes of the English dub of _Digimon Adventure_ in 2001. The story was written by Daniel Horn and Ryan Hill, and illustrated by Daniel Horn and Cara L. Niece.[51]

Panini

The Italian publishing company, Panini, approached Digimon in different ways in different countries. While Germany created their own adaptations of episodes, the United Kingdom (UK) reprinted the Dark Horse titles, then translated some of the German adaptations of _Adventure 02_ episodes. Eventually the UK comics were given their own original stories, which appeared in both the UK's official _Digimon Magazine_ and the official UK Fox Kids companion magazine, _Wickid_. These original stories only roughly followed the continuity of _Adventure 02_. When the comic switched to the _Tamers_ series the storylines adhered to continuity more strictly; sometimes it would expand on subject matter not covered by the original Japanese anime (such as Mitsuo Yamaki's past) or the English adaptations of the television shows and movies (such as Ryo's story or the movies that remained undubbed until 2005). In a money saving venture, the original stories were later removed from _Digimon Magazine_, which returned to printing translated German adaptations of _Tamers_ episodes. Eventually, both magazines were cancelled.
