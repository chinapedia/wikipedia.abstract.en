Grace_Church_Newark_plaque.jpg where Samuel Ward worked as organist, and
wrote and perfected the tune "Materna" that is used for "America the
Beautiful".]]

"AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL" is an American patriotic song. The lyrics were
written by Katharine Lee Bates, and the music was composed by church
organist and choirmaster Samuel A. Ward at Grace Episcopal Church in
Newark, New Jersey.[1] The two never met.[2]

Bates originally wrote the words as a poem, "PIKES PEAK", first
published in the Fourth of July edition of the church periodical _The
Congregationalist_ in 1895. At that time, the poem was titled "America"
for publication. Ward had originally written the music, "Materna", for
the hymn "O Mother dear, Jerusalem" in 1882, though it was not first
published until 1892.[3] Ward's music combined with the Bates poem was
first published in 1910 and titled "America the Beautiful". The song is
one of the most popular of the many U.S. patriotic songs.[4]


History

Americathebeautiful.jpg

In 1893, at the age of 33, Bates, an English professor at Wellesley
College, had taken a train trip to Colorado Springs, Colorado, to teach
a short summer school session at Colorado College.[5] Several of the
sights on her trip inspired her, and they found their way into her poem,
including the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, the "White City"
with its promise of the future contained within its gleaming white
buildings;[6] the wheat fields of America's heartland Kansas, through
which her train was riding on July 16; and the majestic view of the
Great Plains from high atop Pikes Peak.[7][8]

On the pinnacle of that mountain, the words of the poem started to come
to her, and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the
original Antlers Hotel. The poem was initially published two years later
in _The Congregationalist_ to commemorate the Fourth of July. It quickly
caught the public's fancy. Amended versions were published in 1904 and
1911.

The first known melody written for the song was sent in by Silas Pratt
when the poem was published in _The Congregationalist_. By 1900, at
least 75 different melodies had been written.[9] A hymn tune composed in
1882 by Samuel A. Ward, the organist and choir director at Grace Church,
Newark, was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is
still the popular tune today. Just as Bates had been inspired to write
her poem, Ward, too, was inspired. The tune came to him while he was on
a ferryboat trip from Coney Island back to his home in New York City
after a leisurely summer day and he immediately wrote it down.
Supposedly, he was so anxious to capture the tune in his head, he asked
fellow passenger friend Harry Martin for his shirt cuff to write the
tune on. He composed the tune for the old hymn "O Mother Dear,
Jerusalem", retitling the work "Materna". Ward's music combined with
Bates's poem were first published together in 1910 and titled "America
the Beautiful".[10]

Ward died in 1903, not knowing the national stature his music would
attain. Bates was more fortunate, since the song's popularity was well
established by the time of her death in 1929.[11]

At various times in the more than 100 years that have elapsed since the
song was written, particularly during the John F. Kennedy
administration, there have been efforts to give "America the Beautiful"
legal status either as a national hymn or as a national anthem equal to,
or in place of, "The Star-Spangled Banner", but so far this has not yet
succeeded. Proponents prefer "America the Beautiful" for various
reasons, saying it is easier to sing, more melodic, and more adaptable
to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as
"The Star-Spangled Banner". Some prefer "America the Beautiful" over
"The Star-Spangled Banner" due to the latter's war-oriented imagery.
Others prefer "The Star-Spangled Banner" for the same reason. While that
national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of
the national anthem, "America the Beautiful" continues to be held in
high esteem by a large number of Americans, and was even being
considered _before_ 1931, as a candidate to become the national anthem
of the United States.[12]

This song was used as the background music of the television broadcast
of the Tiangong-1 launch.[13]

The song is often included in songbooks in a wide variety of religious
congregations in the United States.

: AMERICA. A POEM FOR JULY 4.

Portrait_of_Katharine_Lee_Bates,_ca._1880-1890.jpg


Popular versions

Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album _101 Gang Songs_
(1961).

Frank Sinatra recorded the song with Nelson Riddle during the sessions
for _The Concert Sinatra_ in February 1963, for a projected 45 single
release. The 45 was not commercially issued however, but the song was
later added as a bonus track to the enhanced 2012 CD release of ''The
Concert Sinatra.

In 1976, while the United States celebrated its bicentennial, a soulful
version popularized by Ray Charles peaked at number 98 on the US R&B
chart.[20]

Three different renditions of the song have entered the Hot Country
Songs charts. The first was by Charlie Rich, which went to number 22 in
1976.[21] A second, by Mickey Newbury, peaked at number 82 in 1980.[22]
An all-star version of "America the Beautiful" performed by country
singers Trace Adkins, Sherrié Austin, Billy Dean, Vince Gill, Carolyn
Dawn Johnson, Toby Keith, Brenda Lee, Lonestar, Lyle Lovett, Lila
McCann, Lorrie Morgan, Jamie O'Neal, The Oak Ridge Boys, Collin Raye,
Kenny Rogers, Keith Urban and Phil Vassar reached number 58 in July
2001. The song re-entered the chart following the September 11
attacks.[23]

Popularity of the song increased greatly following the September 11
attacks; at some sporting events it was sung in addition to the
traditional singing of the national anthem. During the first taping of
the _Late Show with David Letterman_ following the attacks, CBS newsman
Dan Rather cried briefly as he quoted the fourth verse.[24]

For Super Bowl XLVIII, The Coca-Cola Company aired a multilingual
version of the song, sung in several different languages. The commercial
received some criticism on social media sites, such as Twitter and
Facebook, and from some conservatives, such as Glenn Beck.[25][26][27]
Despite the controversies, Coca-Cola later reused the Super Bowl ad
during Super Bowl LI, the opening ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics
and 2016 Summer Olympics and for patriotic holidays.[28][29]


Idioms

"From sea to shining sea", originally used in the charters of some of
the English Colonies in North America, is an American idiom meaning
"from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean" (or vice versa). Other
songs that have used this phrase include the American patriotic song
"God Bless the U.S.A." and Schoolhouse Rock's "Elbow Room". The phrase
and the song are also the namesake of the Shining Sea Bikeway, a bike
path in Bates's hometown of Falmouth, Massachusetts. The phrase is
similar to the Latin phrase "__" ("From sea to sea"), which serves as
the official motto of Canada.[30]

"Purple mountain majesties" refers to the shade of the Pikes Peak in
Colorado Springs, Colorado, which inspired Bates to write the poem.[31]


Books

Lynn Sherr's 2001 book _America the Beautiful_ discusses the origins of
the song and the backgrounds of its authors in depth. The book points
out that the poem has the same meter as that of "Auld Lang Syne"; the
songs can be sung interchangeably. Additionally, Sherr discusses the
evolution of the lyrics, for instance, changes to the original third
verse written by Bates.[32]

Melinda M. Ponder, in her 2017 biography _Katharine Lee Bates: From Sea
to Shining Sea_,[33] draws heavily on Bates's diaries and letters to
trace the history of the poem and its place in American culture.


Controversy

On Independence Day weekend In 2015, a company called Rumblefish falsely
filed a copyright claim on a YouTube video featuring the song as
performed by the United States Navy Band (whose performances are all
likewise public domain[34]) and placed advertisements over the
video.[35][36] Due in part to online outrage, Rumblefish quickly
retracted the false claim on the video.

In 2019, another false copyright claim was filed against the same video,
this time by The Orchard.[37] It remains uncertain if this claim has
been retracted by either party.
