The _WOOD COUNTY DEMOCRAT_ was a newspaper serving Quitman, the county seat of Wood County, Texas. It was founded in 1893 and merged with the _Mineola Monitor_ to form the _Wood County Monitor_ in 2016, ending publication under the Democrat masthead.


History

Alfred Padon was editor and publisher of the _Democrat_ when he founded it in 1893 with financial support from Quitman area merchants.[1] The newspaper's main objective upon founding was the opposition of Populism.[2] Prior to that, he had been publishing the _Mineola Monitor_.[3] Quitman businessmen approached him about founding a newspaper in the county seat.[4]

The newspaper's original plant included a Vaughan Ideal handpress and the entire operation was reported to cost around $800.[5]

Padon resigned as editor and publisher in 1895, and the paper was briefly operated by Grogan and Goodwin for the owners, which included a Dr. Leath and Hix Rhodes.[6]

In 1896, Perno Thomas became editor.[7] He later assumed ownership and sold half interest in the plant to Earl Jones in 1901, but later repurchased it.[8] In 1903, Clyde Jordan of Alba purchased an interest in the paper, but Thomas again regained his full ownership.[9]
