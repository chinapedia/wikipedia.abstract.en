The first season of the show was hosted by singer-actor Meiyang Chang and dancer-choreographer Raghav Juyal. Popular television actor Ravi Dubey took over the baton in the second season and was replaced by actor-singer Aditya Narayan in the third season.

The show premiered on 4 February 2017 on Colors TV.[4] The second season started on 20 January 2018. The third installment of the show is set to air from 16 March 2019


Format

In contrast to other singing competition TV shows which feature a cast of celebrity judges, _Rising Star_ features a cast of celebrity experts and considers the viewers at home the judges.[5] During each performance, the audience at home is able to decide in real time whether or not a contestant is sent through to the next round by using a mobile voting app.[6]

While the viewers are considered the "judges", the expert panelists also may influence the vote, but with continuously decreasing percentage votes over the total public vote and not exceeding 5% of the total voting power.

Auditions

The auditions are the first round where the acts are individually called to perform. As a reportage of the announced performer is shown, viewers are invited to register for voting for that specific act. Following a countdown of three seconds, the candidate has to start performing behind a screen called "the wall".

With the start of the performance, the voting kicks in. Registered voters have the option of voting just "yes" or "no". Non-votes are also considered "no" votes. If an expert votes "yes", another 5% is added to the tally of the contestant. The contestants also see random photos of voters in their favour. The faces of panelists voting "yes" are also shown in larger frames.

Once the contestant reaches 80% of "yes" votes, the wall is raised and the contestant goes to the next round of the competition.[7]

Duels

Contestants who make it through the auditions are paired by the judges to face off in a duel. The first contestant sings with the wall up and sets the benchmark for the second contestant. The second contestant sings with the wall down. If the second contestant betters the first contestant's vote total, the wall rises and the second contestant was through to the next round while the first contestant is eliminated; if the second contestant fails to raise the wall, the second contestant is eliminated and the first contestant goes through.
