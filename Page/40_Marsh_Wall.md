40 MARSH WALL also known as NOVOTEL CANARY WHARF is a 127 m (419 ft), 39-storey hotel in the Isle of Dogs, London, just south of the financial district of Canary Wharf.[1] It has been designed by BUJ Architects for AccorHotels as one of the company's Novotel hotels and has 313 rooms. It is the tallest all-hotel building in the United Kingdom and the tallest Novotel in the world.[2][3]

Construction began in July 2014, costing an estimated £60 million.[4]

Planning permission was granted for the hotel in November 2010 by Tower Hamlets Council. It replaces an office building of six-storeys and 43,768 sq ft which was formerly on the site.[5]
