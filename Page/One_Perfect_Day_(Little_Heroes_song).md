"ONE PERFECT DAY" is a song written by Roger Hart-Wells and recorded by his Australian band, Little Heroes. It was released in March 1982 as the lead single from their second studio album, _Play by Numbers_ (1982). The single entered the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart in April 1982 and peaked at No. 12.

In June 1982, Hart-Well said, "If this single had not succeeded, we probably would have gone off the road and had a long look at ourselves."[1]


Background

In February 2017 Roger Hart-Wells explained how "One Perfect Day" was written about Byron Shire comedian, Sandy Gandhi (1959–2017), and his other friend, Carrie Hall. He told Javier Encalada of _The Northern Star_, that he was watching the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979 and thought of how Gandhi and Hall were in the United Kingdom.[2]
