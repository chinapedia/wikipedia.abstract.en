In other websites, the film was criticised for the World Of Shekhar and World Of Rudra being a reminiscent of many previous Tamil films. The World Of Trilok and The World Of Shiva were praised, although the critics said that a crime drama like The World Of Shiva should have been made in a different film with more depth.
