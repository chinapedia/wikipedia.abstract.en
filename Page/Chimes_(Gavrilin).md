_CHIMES_ (Перезвоны - По прочтении В. М. Шукшина) is a Russian-language choral work by composer Valery Gavrilin. The work was written 1978—1982 and premiered in 1984. The texts, inspired after a reading of Vasily Shukshin, are compiled from folk poetry, Albina Shulgina (1936–2009), and Gavrilin himself. The premiere in 1984 was seen as a turning away from European themes to Russian themes in Gavrilin's output.[1] The work was recorded by Melodiya in 1988, with the soloists Natalia Gerasimova, Svetlana Beloklokova, Ludmila Slepneva, Anatoly Lyubimov, and the Moscow Chamber Choir, under Vladimir Minin.
