BAYHEAD NATURAL HERITAGE SITE is a 20ha nature reserve of mangrove forest and coastal grassland within the industrial area of Durban Bay, South Africa. [1] The reserve is a remnant of what was once the largest mangrove swamp in the province.[2][3]

A number of birds can be found in the reserve, up to 120 different aquatic birds have been recorded.[4] As in the nearby Beachwood Mangrove Nature Reserve, various crabs can also be found.[5] There is a boardwalk and public information centre on site.

In March 2015, a vegetable oil spill from a refinery in the area caused a number of mangrove trees to die.[6]
