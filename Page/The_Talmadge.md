History

A house owned by Earle C. Anthony, built in 1909, was moved to Beverly Hills, California for the 1923 construction of this building.[1] Upon its completion in 1924, it was owned by movie studio executive Joseph M. Schenck and his wife, silent actress Norma Talmadge, who was its namesake.[2] It was designed in the style by William and Alexander Curlett & Claud Beelman.[3]

Initially, Schenck and Talmadge resided on the 11th floor.[4] The rest of the tenants were socialites and heirs.[5]
