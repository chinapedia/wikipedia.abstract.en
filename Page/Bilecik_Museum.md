There was an old Ottoman building in place of the museum. During the Greek occupation in 1920s, the building was demolished. After the liberation of Bilecik, a new building was constructed to be used as a court house. In 1997 it was handed to the Ministry of Culture . After restoration, the former court house became Bilecik Museum in 2006.[1] Up to 2010 it was a sub unit of Söğüt Museum. In 2010 it was established as a separate museum.
