GUND BREWERY LOFTS or the old GUND BREWING COMPANY BOTTLING WORKS was a progressive beer-bottling factory built in 1903, designed by Louis Lehle with modern sanitization and pasteurization machines that gave Gund's beer a reliable shelf life, and electrical power that allowed an efficient plant layout. The factory has now been remodeled as apartments.[1] It is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[2]
