Reception

Johnny Loftus from AllMusic gave the EP 3 out of 5 saying; "Designed as a calling card for her eventual domestic full-length, the brief set showcases Higgins' engaging vocal style and knack for balladry." adding "Higgins keeps "Believing" basic, heightening its dramatic sweep with subtle washes of cello and violin."
