And also the fact that Javed Sheikh Sahab is making his directional comeback with it. How could I have said no?"[11] In May 2016, Frieha Altaf was cast in an unannounced role.[12][13]

Soundtrack

The music and soundtrack of the film is composed by Sahir Ali Bagga, while some of the track will have additional musicians, Sheikh said, "The majority of the soundtrack will be composed by [Sahir Ali] Bagga but it is likely that we may also have one or two more musicians contribute their tracks to the film as well. It is a great blend of tunes in my opinion and this was definitely a good decision”"[16]
