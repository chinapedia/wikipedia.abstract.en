The 2015–16 CYPRIOT THIRD DIVISION was the 45th season of the Cypriot third-level football league. Akritas Chlorakas won their 3rd title.


Format

Sixteen teams participated in the 2015–16 Cypriot Third Division. All teams played against each other twice, once at their home and once away. The team with the most points at the end of the season crowned champions. The first three teams were promoted to the 2016–17 Cypriot Second Division and the last three teams were relegated to the 2016–17 STOK Elite Division.[1][2] However, after the end of the season Nikos & Sokratis Erimis withdrew from the 2016–17 Cypriot Third Division, and so the 14th-placed team remained to Third Division.[3]

Point system

Teams received three points for a win, one point for a draw and zero points for a loss.
