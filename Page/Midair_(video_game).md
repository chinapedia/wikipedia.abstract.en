_MIDAIR_ is a free-to-play first-person shooter by Archetype Studios. The game is influenced by the _Tribes_ franchise,[1] emphasizing freedom of movement with jetpacks and skiing, while also featuring large open maps and vehicles. The game was developed with Unreal Engine 4, and was released on May 3, 2018.[2]


Gameplay

_Midair_ features similar mechanics from the Tribes franchise such as jetpacks and a mechanic the developers call skating, which allows the player to glide across the terrain. Players will have the choice of using either Light, Medium, or Heavy armors. Weapons include a Spinfusor-like weapon currently referred to as the Ring Launcher, as well as a Grenade Launcher and Chain Gun. A Mortar and Sniper Rifle are featured as well. The developers have stated that they are aiming to include most of the traditional weapons from the Tribes franchise, as well as some new ones.

A 3/4/5 weapons system similar to Starsiege: Tribes and Tribes 2 is currently implemented; 3 weapons for Light armor, 4 weapons for Medium armor, and 5 weapons for Heavy armor. No automatic health regeneration is present at the moment or currently planned. Players will be able to equip certain abilities and items, such as deployable sensors and turrets, or packs that give players more ammo, increased energy regeneration, cloaking abilities and more. Vehicles include a basic air fighter, a bomber which supports up to three players, and a tank which supports two players.

Game modes currently include Capture the Flag, Light Capture the Flag, Arena, and Rabbit. Public matches consist of team-sizes similar to Tribes: Ascend's 16v16, while competitive team sizes vary between 5v5 and 11v11, depending on the game mode.[3]


Monetization

_Midair_ features both unlocks and a progression system. As players progress they will earn unlocks such as weapons, packs, items, and deployables. Players have the option of 'buying' the game for $30, which unlocks all current and future items, barring cosmetic items which must be purchased separately.[4] This is comparable to SMITE's one-time payment option.[5]


Development

The project originally began as a port of _Legions: Overdrive_ to the Unity game engine in 2012 by former _Legions: Overdrive_ developers. After taking into consideration how much time and effort would be required, the team decided to make a full-fledged sequel to _Legions: Overdrive_. However, in 2013 the developers decided to change plans and develop a new game altogether.[6]

After working with Unity for roughly a year the developers switched to Unreal Engine 4 shortly after the engine's release in March 2014.

On December 22, 2015, a Steam Greenlight campaign was launched for'' Midair''. The first official gameplay trailer was also released. On December 29 they achieved Greenlight status.[10]

On May 5, 2016, Archetype Studios launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter for _Midair_ with a goal of $100,000. On June 4 the campaign ended with $128,000.[11]

On March 26, 2017, _Midair_ entered the alpha stage of development.[12]

On August 17, 2017, Archetype Studios announced that the closed beta for _Midair_ would launch on August 25. They also announced that the full release would be pushed from November 2017 to Q1 2018.[13]
