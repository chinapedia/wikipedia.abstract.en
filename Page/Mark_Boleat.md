SIR MARK JOHN BOLEAT (born January 1949) is deputy chairman of the City of London Corporation's Policy and Resources Committee. He has previously been director general of the Building Societies Association, the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the Association of British Insurers.[1] He is a Common Councilman for Cordwainer Ward and trustee of Centre for London.

Boleat is chair of the Housing and Finance Institute, an organisation established in 2015 with support of the Cameron–Clegg coalition government.[2] In this capacity he wrote _The Housing Problem in London: a broken planning system_, which was published on 18 October 2017. This led to residents of the City of London to call for his resignation as a common councilman. They were concerned about his proposal to bar locally elected Councillors to vote on planning applications. A spokesperson for the Golden Lane Estate Residents Association said he “has such open contempt for local democracy and communities that we consider his views are no longer compatible with his role as a Common Councilman.”[3]

He was knighted in the 2017 Birthday Honours.[4]
