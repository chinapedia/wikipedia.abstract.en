Biography

Born on 3 March 1942 in Oslo, Brodtkorb was the daughter of the business administrator Roald Nissen and Ragnhild Marie Heiding, a secretary. On graduating from the Norwegian Institute of Technology in 1965, she worked as an architect for Harald Hille's firm (1966–71) and for Anker & Hølaas (1977–85) where she became a partner. From 1985, she ran her own firm in Bærum.[3]

She adopted an innovative approach to residential architecture, combining high engineering standards with distinctively attractive designs. Her developments in Oslo, in a white European modernism style, include 30 townhouses on Gullkroken, 110 apartments on Hofftunet and 60 homes in Smestad. Her masterpiece is the _Stranden_ housing complex on Aker Brygge. Completed in 1990, it consists of 120 apartments specially designed for affluent residents. Combining brick with black-painted steel, it draws on the area's shipyard architecture while integrating offices, shops and restaurants. It has been awarded several prizes including the Houen Foundation Award.[4]

After teaching for a period at the Oslo School of Architecture in the early 1990s, she went on to design residential buildings throughout the country. Brodtkorn stands out as an outstanding female architect in a profession dominated by men.[5]

In 2014, together with Kristin Jarmund, Brodtkorb was awarded the Anders Jahres Cultural Prize for her "artistically sensitive designs and her contribution to promoting humane architecture in a socially developmental context".[6]
