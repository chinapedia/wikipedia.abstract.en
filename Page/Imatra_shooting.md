The IMATRA SHOOTING occurred on 4 December 2016 in the Finnish town of Imatra when Jori Juhani Lasonen, a 23-year-old Imatra resident, shot three individuals dead in the town centre.[1][2][3]

According to the psychological evaluation, Lasonen was not criminally responsible at the time of the shootings. Therefore, The South Karelia District Court did not sentence him to prison, but instead committed him to involuntary psychiatric treatment.[4]


Details

Just before midnight on Saturday, right outside a local restaurant in the town's shopping area, Jori Juhani Lasonen waited for vulnerable targets and chose, according to preliminary police investigations, random targets. However, one of the victims was a notable local politician.[5][6]
