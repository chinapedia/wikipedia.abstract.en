_GRACILIELLA_ is a genus of cave beetle in the family Leiodidae.[1] It was previously included in the genus _Anthroherpon_ but DNA evidence showed that it is actually a more distantly related group of species. The paper in which _Graciliella_ was published gained some media attention, with several stories picking up on the spider-like appearance of these beetles.[2] _Graciliella_ currently consists of six species, including the newly discovered _Graciliella kosovaci_ and _Graciliella ozimeci_ All species occur in subterranean habitats of the Dinaric Mountains, from Crvanj mountain (Bosnia and Herzegovina) in the north, to Trnovo (Montenegro) in the south, and from Žaba mountain (Croatia) in the west to Prokletije mountain (Montenegro) in the east.[3]
