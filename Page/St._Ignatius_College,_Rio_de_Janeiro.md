History

In 1567, with the expulsion of the French, the city of Rio de Janeiro was transferred to Castle Hill where in the same year a Jesuit college was founded, the first school in the city,[3] with Father Manuel da Nobrega as the first dean.[4]

In 1922, the hill was removed and the church and the old school building demolished.[5] The original bell and a set of Baroque sculptures from Morro Castle church were preserved and now adorn the main courtyard and the lobby of St. Ignatius College. The columns and the front of the Church of St. Ignatius at the school's present site on Rua São Clemente were originally intended for the church attached to the school at Castle Hill which was never completed. The painting of Ignatius Loyola on his altar at the present church.

In 1900, the residence of Jesuit priests in Rio was at 35 Senador Vergueiro, in the Flamengo neighborhood. It remained there until 1902, with a small primary school where Father Alexandre Diomedi taught some boys music and prepared them for first communion. In July 1903, the priests moved to #132 Sao Clemente Avenue in Botafogo,[6] and later to #226. They rented a house for 500 escudos, after attempts to decades of Jesuit reopen a school in Rio, began operating the EXTERNATO ST. IGNATIUS. The first rector was Domingos de Meis, a priest. It was renamed to ST. IGNATIUS COLLEGE in 1942. He is currently held by the Brazilian Society of Education.[7]
