KHAIRIYA AL MANSOUR is an Iraqi filmmaker and director. Born March 28, 1958, in Baghdad, Khairiya studied there from 1976 to 1980 at the Academy of Arts, and in Cairo at the Higher Film Institute in 1987. She was an assistant director to well-known Iraqi and Egyptian directors such as Salah Abu Seif, Tewfik Saleh, and Youssef Chahine. She herself has made around forty documentary films for the Iraqi ministry of culture and for private producers. She has also directed two full-length films. When the international embargo against Iraq brought about the collapse of the film industry there, she started working for Iraqi and Jordanian television. She divides her time between Baghdad and Cairo.

Khairiya Al Mansour's films can generally be divided into two categories. Her socially critical films tackle issues such as the situation of women of Iraq: _This is My Village_ (about peasant women), _Determination_, and _The Lady of Ages_ (about the founding of the Iraqi Women's Association). Or they deal with the impact of the international embargo, especially on Iraq's children: _Look!_ and _White Dreams_ (about a milk factory that was destroyed) and _One Day in Baghdad_.

Khairiya's other area of film is artist's portraits: _Magical Fingers_ (about women painters), _Cinema Lover_ (about a deceased director), and _The Dream, The Memory_ (about a famous actor who died during the embargo).[1]
