DANIEL GAWTHROP (born 1963 in Nanaimo, British Columbia) is a Canadian writer and editor.[1] He is the author of five books, most recently _The Trial of Pope Benedict_ and _The Rice Queen Diaries_. As a journalist he was the original publisher and editor of _Xtra! West_ in Vancouver,[2] and has also contributed to publications including the _Vancouver Sun_, _The Economist_, _The Georgia Straight_, _Quill & Quire_, _Canadian Dimension_ and _The Tyee_. He now works as a communications representative for the Canadian Union of Public Employees.[3]


Background

He was educated at the University of Victoria (BA 1987), the University of King's College (BJ 1988), and Royal Roads University (MA 2009). During the 1990s, he worked as a journalist for various publications in British Columbia. In 1990, he was part of a gay writers group in the Vancouver area, which included Stan Persky, George Stanley and Scott Watson, that launched the literary magazine _Sodomite Invasion Review_. He was named as the first publisher and editor of _Xtra! West_ in 1993.

During the 1994 NHL playoffs he attracted national attention when articles he had published in both _Xtra! West_ and the _Vancouver Sun_, about the sex appeal of Vancouver Canucks hockey player Pavel Bure, drew commentary on _Hockey Night in Canada_ from Don Cherry.[4]

He is an active member of the Writers' Union of Canada.[5]


Books

His first book, a biography of AIDS activist and educator Peter Jepson-Young titled _Affirmation: The AIDS Odyssey of Dr. Peter_ (1994),[6] examined its subject’s life and contributions in the context of the conservative politics and mediascape of the times.

His second book, an examination of the New Democratic government of Mike Harcourt titled _Highwire Act: Power, Pragmatism and the Harcourt Legacy_, was published in 1996.[7]

He followed up with _Vanishing Halo: Saving the Boreal Forest_ in 1999,[8] a book commissioned by the David Suzuki Foundation to raise awareness about the world’s coniferous crown and the industrial practices that have threatened it.

After a few years in Thailand, where he worked as a sub-editor for the English language daily newspaper _The Nation_,[9] he returned to Canada and in 2005 published _The Rice Queen Diaries_,[10] a personal memoir that explores the political and cultural minefields of ethnicity and desire between white Western and Far East Asian men.

In 2013 he published _The Trial of Pope Benedict: Joseph Ratzinger and the Vatican’s Assault on Reason, Compassion, and Human Dignity_,[11] a critical account of its subject’s decades-long campaign to crush a liberal reform movement within the Roman Catholic Church after the Second Vatican Council.
