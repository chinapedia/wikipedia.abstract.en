_FEMINAZI_ is a pejorative term for feminists, which was popularized by politically conservative American radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh.


Origin and usage

According to _The Oxford Dictionary of American Political Slang_, _feminazi_ refers (pejoratively) to "a committed feminist or a strong-willed woman". The term is a portmanteau of the nouns _feminist_ and _Nazi_. The American conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, who popularized the term, credited the university professor Thomas Hazlett with coining it.

Limbaugh, who has been vocally critical of the feminist movement, stated that the term _feminazi_ refers to "radical feminists" whose goal is "to see that there are as many abortions as possible" and a small group of "militants" whom he distinguishes from "well-intentioned but misguided people who call themselves 'feminists'". However, the term came to be widely used for feminism as a whole; Limbaugh has used it in reference to the Feminist Majority Foundation and the activists Gloria Steinem and Susan Sarandon, among others. Steinem writes that "I've never met anyone who fits that description [of wanting as many abortions as possible], though [Limbaugh] lavishes it on me among many others".

Limbaugh states that _feminazis_, as opposed to mainstream feminists, are those "who are happy about the large number of abortions we have" in the United States. The anti-violence educator Jackson Katz argues that "no such feminists exist", and that _feminazi_ is a "clever term of propaganda" intended and used to "[bully] into complicit silence women who might otherwise challenge men's violence". In his book _Angry White Men_, the sociologist Michael Kimmel says the term is used to attack feminist campaigns for equal pay and safety from rape and domestic violence by associating them with Nazi genocide.


Cultural impact

According to Helen Lewis, deputy editor of the _New Statesman_, "the idea of conflating a liberation movement with Nazism is just deeply ignorant. It’s self-undermining, because it’s so over the top." Laura Bates, the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, has said that "It’s a desperate attempt to demonise us, and it’s frustrating, because if it wasn’t such an offensive word, you could actually start to embrace it and own it".

Steinem has suggested a boycott of Limbaugh for his use of the term, stating, "Hitler came to power against the strong feminist movement in Germany, padlocked the family planning clinics, and declared abortion a crime against the stateall views that more closely resemble Rush Limbaugh's".
