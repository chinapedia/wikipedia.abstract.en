The SYNOD OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA (also known as UNITING CHURCH SA and formerly PRESBYTERY AND SYNOD OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA from 2005 to 2019) is the entity of the Uniting Church in Australia covering most of the state of South Australia. It is one of six geographically-based Synods of the church. The leader of the Synod is the _moderator_ elected to the position for a period of three years. The legal entity for the South Australian branch of the Uniting Church is _The Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust (S.A.)_[1]

The Uniting Church has a series of inter-related councils, which do not strictly represent a hierarchy. The National Assembly is responsible for issues of doctrine. Each state has a Synod which is responsible for property. Presbyteries are regional councils responsible for the selection, training and oversight of ministers.


Presbyteries and mission networks

A synod may relate to a number of Presbyteries within its bounds. From the beginning of July 2019, the single Presbytery of South Australia divided into a new _Generate Presbytery_ and another _Transitional Presbytery_. Both presbyteries extend across the entire Synod geography and congregations had the opportunity to choose which presbytery they would belong to. The larger Transitional Presbytery is expected to further divide into two or three later in 2019 along geographical lines.[2]

The Synod of South Australia previously had seven presbyteries, but in 2005 the presbyteries merged, and the structure simplified so that there was one administration and series of meetings for both the Synod and the single Presbytery.[3] As a consequence of the single presbytery having a quite large geographic extent, a series of "mission networks" were established giving congregations a way of relating to similarly-minded congregations and equipping congregations for mission and ministry.[4]

The mission networks were:[5]

-   Community Outreach[6]
-   Grace Connections
-   Gulf
-   Hope Network[7]
-   Northern Rural
-   Urban [8]
-   Western
-   3DNet[9]

The original presbyteries in South Australia before 2005 were:[10]

-   Adelaide Northwest
-   Eyre Peninsula
-   Fleurieu
-   Frome
-   Mount Lofty
-   South Eastern (later Presbytery of The Coorong)
-   Wakefield


Education

The Uniting College for Leadership and Theology is the theological college of the synod. It is a component of the Adelaide College of Divinity and draws its heritage from both Wesley Theological College and Parkin College.

There are a number of schools associated with the Uniting Church in South Australia. these are:

-   Annesley College
-   Pedare Christian College
-   Prince Alfred College
-   Scotch College, Adelaide
-   Seymour College
-   Westminster School, Adelaide

Lincoln College is a residential college for university students in North Adelaide close to the University of Adelaide.
