Calcite_jaune.jpg Aragonite_2_Enguidanos.jpg DIMORPHISM is the property of some minerals to exist in two different crystal systems, while still having the same chemical formula. Examples include CaCO₃, which exists as trigonal calcite or orthorhombic aragonite. A mineral's dimorph is the mineral that it is dimorphic with.[1][2] Dimorphism is not to be confused with allotropy, which refers to a difference in crystal structure of pure elements.


Trimorphism & Polymorphism

_Trimorphism_ is the term used when a mineral has a total of three dimorphs,[3] while the term _polymorphism_ is used when there are four or more. Silica, SiO₂, is a good example, being found in nature as quartz, tridymite, cristobalite, coesite, and stishovite.[4] Pleomorphism is a synonym of polymorphism.[5]
