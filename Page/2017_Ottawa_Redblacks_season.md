The Redblacks finished in second place in the East Division with an 8–9–1 record and hosted a playoff game for the third consecutive year.

Retirements

On January 24, 2017 starting quarterback Henry Burris officially announced his retirement.[3] Burris joined the Redblacks prior to their inaugural season, and was the teams starting quarterback for the franchise's first two seasons, and then again for portions of the 2016 season, eventually leading the team to victory in the 104th Grey Cup game. The retirement pushes Trevor Harris into the starting quarterback role, having acquired him prior to the 2016 season for the purpose of being Burris' successor.
