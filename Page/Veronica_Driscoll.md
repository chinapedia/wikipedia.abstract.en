Biography

Early life

Driscoll was born on April 24, 1926 in Brooklyn. She was one of seven children born to Francis Aloysius Bartholomew and Madeline (née Daly) Driscoll. In her childhood years, Driscoll went to a catholic school, and later attended P.S. 207. She went to Midwood High School, where she won first prize in a short story contest. Driscoll's first choice for her career was in journalism, but experiences with illness in her family influenced her to go into nursing. After she graduated from St. Catherine's Hospital School of Nursing in 1948, Driscoll earned a bachelor of science degree from St John's University five years later.[1] She earned a master's degree in guidance and personnel administration from New York University in 1958, and later went to Teachers College, Columbia University where she graduated with a doctor of education degree.[2][3]

Career

Driscoll led negotiations for nurses employed by the city's 21 municipal hospitals of New York City Department of Hospitals in 1966.[4] She stated that locating nurses was difficult due to poor wages and working conditions.[5] A precedent contract was signed after eight months of negotiation which increased nurses' salaries by 20%, and improved working conditions and gave them more benefits.[6] Driscoll's leadership prevented thousands of nurses from resigning en masse.[7][8]

She staffed a committed that prepared a report entitled _A Blueprint for the Education of Nurses in New York_ which was published in 1966. Driscoll was appointed the New York State Nurses Association's executive director in the summer of 1969.

She was a significant factor in enacting the 1972 revision of the state's nurse practice act. Driscoll implemented several large organizational changes within the New York States Nursing Association. She oversaw the start of the organization's journal, the _Report and Journal_, and the introduction of the position of president-elect. Driscoll served as chair on the American Nurses Association (ANA) Commission on Economics and General Welfare, due to her being a member of the ANA's board of directors, and served as secretary of the board of directors of the American Journal of Nursing company, and was a member of the New York State Hospital Review and Planning Council.[9]
