_PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES (HANSARD)_ is the official name of the transcripts of debates in the New Zealand Parliament. New Zealand was one of the first countries to establish an independent team of _Hansard_ reporters,[1] 42 years before the British (Imperial) Parliament. An official record of debates has been kept continuously since 9 July 1867. Speeches made in the House of Representatives and the Legislative Council between 1867 and the commencement of Parliament in 1854 were compiled in 1885 from earlier newspaper reports, and this compilation also forms part of the New Zealand _Hansard_ record.

The _Hansard_ takes its name from Thomas Curson Hansard, who started publishing a daily record of proceedings in the British Parliament in the early 19th century.[2]


History

Cartoon_about_NZ_Parliamentary_Debates_from_NZ_Observer_12_October_1895.jpg For 13 years from the establishment of the New Zealand Parliament in Auckland in 1854 newspaper reports were the only record of what MPs said in debates in the Legislative Council and the House of Representatives. The accuracy of these reports often depended on the political leanings of the owners of the newspaper in which they were published, and consistency of reporting was a real problem,[3] as noted in an article in the _Wellington Independent_ newspaper in 1860:[4]

  “_These reports give you little notion of the reality. Some members … whose speeches are dreary beyond belief, and almost unintelligible as delivered in the House, [become] flowing oratory in the columns of the newspaper. While others… are shorn of their fair proportions, and their speeches reduced to mere notes… Members who usually talk to empty benches [appear] as prominent as those who electrify the gallery or are the life of the House._”

MP William Fitzherbert brought a motion to the House in 1856 calling for funds to be applied to "_secure accurate and authentic reports of the substance and arguments of the speeches_".[5] Then in 1862 James FitzGerald (MP for Christchurch and owner of _The Press_) introduced a motion calling on the Government to take steps to secure the publication of "_full and accurate reports of the debates in this House_".[6] Despite both motions being unanimously agreed, it was not until 1866 that a Select Committee, chaired by FitzGerald, was established to “_consider and report as to the best manner in which the debates of the General Assembly can be reported and printed_.”[7]

On 9 July 1867 a team of five reporters (AJ Dallas, George McIntyre, James Kinsella, ET Gillon, and William Mitchell who later drowned[8]),[9][10][11] led by Chief Reporter C.C.N. Barron, produced the first official report of debates of the New Zealand Parliament.[12][13] One notable _Hansard_ Reporter from the 1870s and 1880s was George Fisher, who was mayor of Wellington for four terms, member of Parliament for Wellington and Minister of Education and Commissioner of Trade and Customs.[14][15] Another notable early _Hansard_ Reporter was Charles Melville Crombie, who later became Chief Commissioner of Taxes.[16]

upright=1.5 Reporters worked in 15 minute "turns" and had to cover speeches in both debating chambers, regularly working until after midnight to finish the day's reports, taking notes using Pitman shorthand and then transcribing these by dictation.[17] From the establishment of the _Hansard_ team speeches were reported as fully as possible, although for many years it was regularly proposed that only summaries of speeches should be published.[18] Reporters had to cope with speakers who had a variety of different accents and speaking pace, and had to learn the names of an increasing number of members, with the number of members in the House alone increasing from 37 in 1854 to 95 by 1882. Competent reporters with shorthand skills were scarce in New Zealand and men were brought in during parliamentary sessions from Australian parliaments to assist local reporters.

In 1884 Maurice FitzGerald, son of James FitzGerald, was engaged to compile from newspaper reports speeches made in Parliament between 1854 and 1867.[19][20][21][22] Maurice Fitzgerald completed this work in 1885.[23][24] He died in 1886 (at 25 years of age) from tuberculosis[25] before all five volumes of his compilation were printed.[26][27]


New Zealand _Hansard_ today

Official transcripts of MPs' speeches in the House have been continuously published since 1867. Today _Hansard_ is produced by a team of about 17 FTE Hansard editors within the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives. _Hansard_ is published on the New Zealand Parliament website each day the House sits, and later indexed bound volumes are produced.

Speeches are transcribed directly from digital recordings of the debate, with staff present in the debating chamber to monitor the debate by recording the sequence of speakers and any interjections. Interjections are reported only if the member speaking replies to them or remarks on them during the course of his or her speech. Hansard Editors follow strict rules on what changes they can make to the words MPs use in the debating chamber. _Hansard_ is as close to verbatim as possible, although Hansard Editors remove repetitions and redundancies and make minor grammatical corrections. MPs are provided draft copies of their speeches at the same time that the speeches are first published on the Parliament website. MPs can request correction of inadvertent factual inaccuracies but they are unable to significantly change what they said in the House.[28][29]

  24 May 1854                      The General Assembly sat for the first time, with an upper house, the Legislative Council, consisting of 12 appointed Legislative Councillors, and a House of Representatives consisting of 37[30] elected Members of the House.
  May/June 1854                    A "reporting club" of MPs was formed, consisting of James FitzGerald, Henry Sewell, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, Edward Jerningham Wakefield, James Macandrew, Hugh Carleton and William Cutten. Because of the lack of press reporters with shorthand skills this group undertook to take notes of speeches in the House, which would then be provided to each member who had spoken for checking, before being provided to newspapers for publication.[31][32] The collegiality of members of the reporting club was short-lived: by early July Henry Sewell complained that Edward Gibbon Wakefield "_does not scruple here and there to doctor and color what has been really said, not absolutely falsifying, and yet giving slight touches which wholly alter the real character... his speeches are embellished throughout with cheers, as if the House sympathized heartily_".[33]
  12 June 1856                     MPs agreed a motion moved by William Fitzherbert calling for funds to be applied to "_secure accurate and authentic reports of the substance and arguments of the speeches made by honorable members of the House_"[34]
  25 August 1862                   MPs agreed a motion moved by James FitzGerald calling on the Government to take steps to secure the publication of "_full and accurate reports of the debates in this House_"[35]
  2 December 1863                  MPs reaffirm the motion moved by James FitzGerald calling on the Government to take steps to secure the publication of "_full and accurate reports of the debates in this House_"[36]
  8 & 14 August 1865               MPs agreed a motion moved by Frederick Weld: "_That a Select Committee be appointed to superintend the revision of the reports of debates_"[37] A similar motion moved by James Crowe Richmond was passed in the Legislative Council[38]
  5 & 17 July 1866                 MPs agreed a motion moved by Edward Stafford "_That a Select Committee be appointed to consider and report as to the best manner in which the debates of the General Assembly can be reported and printed._"[39] This Committee reported to the House that the Government should eventually "_engage a staff of competent reporters_" but until that could be done the Wellington newspapers should be paid to "_furnish full and accurate reports daily of the proceedings in both Houses._"[40][41][42] However the House refused to agree a resolution moved by Committee Chairman James FitzGerald to enter into a contract with local newspaper proprietors, as had been proposed by the report.[43][44][45]
  26 July 1866                     James FitzGerald drew the House's attention to the fact that newspapers were deliberately omitting to report the speeches, or even the name, of a certain member. A note in _Hansard_ indicates that FitzGerald was referring to the Wellington newspapers purposely omitting any mention of Francis Dillon Bell.[46]
  28 September 1866                Thomas MacKenzie, proprietor of the _Wellington Independent_ newspaper was summoned to appear before the House for a "_breach of Privilege_" by publishing a report of parliamentary debates that indicated that Arthur John Burns (Member for Caversham) had acted maliciously by raising a certain matter in House.[47][48][49]
  9 July 1867                      Clarke Charles Netterville Barron is appointed as Chief Reporter and tasked with establishing a team of reporters to record debates in both Houses of Parliament. [50]
  10 July 1867                     Colonial Secretary Edward Stafford advised the House that the Government had established "_a reporting staff of four persons, and a head of the staff, who will take down and report the proceedings of both Houses, which will be printed_". A Select Committee was appointed to "_have entire control over the reporting_"... this was an "_experiment_"; the Select "_Committee was to ascertain whether the present arrangements could be improved._"[51] The _Wellington Independent_ derided the government's decision to establish a team of _Hansard_ reporters, rather than enter into a contract with local newspapers to report on debates.[52][53]
  16 July 1867                     The Select Committee on Reporting Debates adopted rules that allowed Members "_the opportunity of revising reports, on the strict understanding that the alterations are to be confined to making the reports more in accordance with the remarks actually uttered in the House. The head reporter to be the judge of the alterations made, and to refuse to pass those which he considers are departures from a correct report of what the speaker said._"[54]
  6 August 1868                    After lengthy debate, the House refused to agree a resolution moved by Charles Heaphy that "_having in view the burdensome taxation of the country... the present system of reporting the debates, and the expense thereof, should cease with the termination of existing contracts._"[55]
  1 September 1869                 A Reporting Debates Committee appointed by the House on 4 June 1869 "_for the purpose of regulating the proceedings of the reporters, and endeavouring to provide for the better compilation of the reports_"[56] reaffirmed the rule established by the 1867 Select Committee on Reporting Debates that if Members seek to make material alterations in the reports of their speeches the _'Chief Reporter should have the power to refuse to pass such corrections to the Printer_".[57]
  14 July 1870                     The Reporting Debates Committee considered, but did not agree to, a proposal by John Davies Ormond (Member for Clive) that _"Hansard staff should be required to prepare summaries of the debates in the House for transmission by telegraph to the various newspapers of the colony"_.[58]
  14 November 1871                 MPs agreed a motion moved by William Harrison: "_That, with the view to improving the character of Hansard, a permanent staff of efficient reporters should be engaged for that service,_" (at that time most reporters were employed on a sessional basis) "_and that it should be a primary duty of the Chief Reporter to take his share in the task of reporting._" (The Chief Reporter was currently mostly doing administration and checking reports, rather than reporting.)[59]
  24 September & 25 October 1872   MPs noted a marked improvement in _Hansard_ due to the appointment of permanent reporters[60][61]
  28 July 1875                     After lengthy debate, the House refused to agree a proposal from the Reporting Debates Committee that "_Hansard reporters be directed to report "short" those debates which are not of general public interest._" This proposal would have seen many speeches reported in a précis format, with only "_matters of political importance... reported as nearly as possible in extenso_".[62]
  8 August 1879                    MPs again rejected a proposal brought by the Reporting Debates and Printing Committee that would have allowed the Chief Reporter "_the exercise of a discretionary power as to reporting matters arising incidentally in the House, and not set down as business of the day_ [because] _with the limited staff at his disposal, it was impossible... to report everything that took place in the House_".[63]
  3 December 1879                  MPs again rejected a proposal brought by the Reporting Debates committees of both houses "_that the debates published in Hansard shall be condensed next session_".[64]
  7 July 1880                      MPs agreed a motion "_that it be an instruction to the Printing and Debates Committee to inquire into and report to this House in what manner retrenchment can best be effected in the cost of the publication of Hansard._"[65]
  15 June 1882                     MPs rejected a motion "_that members shall defray the cost of printing their own speeches in Hansard; and that such cost shall be deducted from the honorarium, if any, to which they may be entitled_". (If it had been passed this motion would have allowed members to choose whether or not their speeches were reported in _Hansard_.)''".[66]
  7 November 1884                  William Steward advised the House that the Reporting Debates and Printing Committee had sanctioned the ordering of four 'Caligraph' typewriters as a trial _"with a view to adding to the facilities of the reporting staff"_.[67]
  8 November 1884                  Premier Robert Stout advised the House that Maurice FitzGerald, son of James FitzGerald, would be engaged to compile from newspaper reports speeches made in Parliament between 1854 and 1867.[68] This work was completed the following year but the last of the five volume compilation was not printed until 1887.[69]
