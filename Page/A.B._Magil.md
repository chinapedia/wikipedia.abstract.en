A.B. MAGIL, (1905– January 2003), also known as Abraham B. Magil and "Abe" Magil, was a Yiddish-speaking, full-time Communist Party and "Marxist journalist and pamphleteer."[1][2]


Background

Abraham B. Magil was born in 1905 to a poor, Jewish, immigrant family in South Philadelphia. His father, Joseph Magil, was a Hebrew scholar; he had three older sisters. He won a scholarship to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he obtained a degree in journalism and was a Phi Beta Kappa Key.[3][4]


Career

Daily Worker (1926–1958)

In 1930, he traveled to Russia for the World Congress of Revolutionary Artists and Writers as Party eyes and ballast to non-Party delegates Harry Alan Potemkin and William Gropper. He returned through Berlin.[6][7]

During the Great Depression, the Party sent Magil to Detroit (1933–35) to found a state-wide edition of the _Daily Worker_. The local edition soon ran out of money, so Magil started to edit the _Auto News_ for the Auto Workers Union, a left-led predecessor of the United Auto Workers. What that newspaper also ran out of money, Magil became local correspondent for the _Daily Worker_.[8]

During the 1930s and into the 1940s, he worked alongside Joe North at the head of the _New Masses_: Magil was a hardliner to counterbalance North. He wrote a poem on the death of Soviet poet Mayakovsky, which appeared along with other poetry in the _1938 Anthology of Proletarian Literature in the United States_, edited by Granville Hicks. By 1948, when the magazine closed, he became the magazine's executive editor.[9][10]

Magil decided to take his family to live in Palestine. After initial refusal by the State Department ("not be in the interests of the United States") Magil obtained a passport. They lived six months there, during which time Israel declared its independence (May 5, 1948). He served as foreign correspondent for the _Daily Worker_ and Yiddish-language _Morning Frieheit_. Magil's cousin there, Matja Lessem, had married Dr. Willi Wolff, Israel's first minister of health. He covered the military action of the Palmach, a left-wing, special military unit of the Haganah and interviewed its commander, Yigdal Alon (later Israeli military chief of staff) and second in command Yitzhak Rabin (later Israeli prime minister. Upon their return to New York, he wrote the book _Israel in Crisis_ (New York: International Publishers, 1949).[11]

During much of the 1950s (during McCarthyism), the Party asked Magil to move to Mexico with his family. Again, he worked there as foreign correspondent for the _Daily Worker_ – and also "supplied Party leaders with information on the political situation both in the United States and in Mexico." Mexican Communist he knew included: David Siqueiros, Diego Rivera, and Frida Kahlo, as well as visitors like Pablo Neruda, Juan Marinello, Carlos Raphael Rodriguez, and Hollywood Ten refugees Albert Maltz, Ring Lardner Jr., and Dalton Trumbo.[12]

He returned to the States at McCarthyism's peak, joined the Party's Administrative Committee, establish a National Peace Commission, and continued to write for the _Daily Worker_.[13]

He interviewed Guatemala's leader Jacobo Arbenz six months before the latter's overthrow. Returning to the States via Mexico, the FBI arrested him in Mexico illegally. Back in the States, he co-wrote the pamphlet "What Happened in Guatemala" with Helen Simon Travis.[14]

During 1955–1956, he was an editor of the quarterly _Mainstream_ and its monthly successor _Masses & Mainstream_. In 1958, he became editor of the _Sunday Worker_ and foreign editor of the _Daily Worker_.[15]

Later life

In 1958, Magil took full-time work in medical journalism. He continued Party activity as a member of the editorial board of the progressive monthly _Jewish Currents_ and was member in a Party club of writers led by Si Gerson.[16]

Magil left the Party with many others in 1992 in the wake of the fall of the Soviet Union and joined the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. In his last decade, he continued to champion the need to build democratic unity to defeat the far-right Republican Party. He also partook in a Marxist discussion group.[17]


Later interviews

In his May 1952 memoir _Witness_, Whittaker Chambers (who time at the _Daily Worker_ and perhaps the _New Masses_ overlapped) wrote of "Abe Magill [_sic_] as "a solemn young Philadelphian, known, for his humorless pomposity, as the 'rabbi Magill'."

 

By October 1952, Magil took his an interview about Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss with Elinor Ferry, a Hiss supporter. This interview was used by later Hiss supporters including Meyer Zeligs (in his 1967 book[18]). Citing the interview in her 2013 book, Julia M. Allen quoted Magil as telling Ferry that Chambers' wife Esther Shemitz and her roommate Grace Lumpkin "_appeared_ to be Lesbians. Esther was masculine in appearance and in her voice. Grace was the softer, more feminine type."[19]

In 1976, Magil corresponded with literary scholar Alan M. Wald. In 1989–1990, he gave interviews to Alan Wald regarding Party literary activities at the _New Masses_.[20]


Personal and death

He was known as "Abe" and Abraham.[21]

Around 1940, Magil married Harriet Black, a psychiatric social worker who had been National Treasurer of the American Women's Congress; they stayed married 62 years until Harriet’s death in October 2002. They had one child, Maggie, and one granddaughter, Kate.[22] In 1994 he and his wife moved to Arlington, VA to be closer to family but he continued to travel to New York City to attend his Marxist discussion group up until a few months before his death.

He died in January 2003, aged 98.[23]
