_LOUISIANA ROCK & ROLL_ is the third album by American southern rock band Potliquor. It was released in 1973.

At least one newspaper had begun reporting _Louisiana Rock & Roll_'s release at the end of January,[1] and by early February 1973, Janus Records had placed a full color ad across the bottom of the front page of Billboard Magazine promoting new albums by three of their artists, including _Louisiana Rock & Roll_.[2][3] A week later, a full page advertisement appeared in Billboard concerning new albums by eleven Chess/Janus artists, among them being Potliquor's new LP,.[4] In fact, an early release of "Waiting for Me at the River", a single from the album, had been reported as a regional breakout in New Orleans in October of the previous year.[5] By the end of March, Billboard was reporting considerable airplay for Louisiana Rock & Roll in Valdosta, Georgia; Los Angeles, California; Hartford, Connecticut;[6] St. Charles, Missouri;[7] Paris, Texas; Denver, Colorado;[8] and Toronto, Canada.[9] "H", another single from the album, was reported being played in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania in the middle of March 1973.[10]
