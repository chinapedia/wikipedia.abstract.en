The EAST BROOK MALL is a mall located in Mansfield, Connecticut that was built to serve Willimantic and the surrounding area.[1] The mall currently has 27 stores and 2 anchor stores, Kohl's and T.J. Maxx.[2]


History

The mall was opened on April 24, 1975 to the public to be the first mall opened in Northeastern Connecticut. It was opened with 3 anchor stores, Caldor, Sage-Allen, and A&P Supermarkets.[3] The three anchors remained until Sage-Allen closed all its shops in 1993, including the on in the mall.[4] Shortly after, A&P Supermarkets closed its store in 1994.[5] Cherry & Webb opened in Sage-Allen's shop between 1993-1995 until JCPenney replaced the store in mid-1995.[6] In the same year, TJMaxx opened in the former supermarket.[7]

A Applebee's and Savings Bank Institute both opened in external locations in the parking lot in 2001.[8] Caldor finally closed its store in 1999 and was replaced by Ames.[9] Ames ended up closing after its bankruptcy in 2002.[10] A movie theater opened in the mall in 2004 and closed briefly in 2009, only to reopen under new owners.[11][12] Kohl's opened in Caldor's former space in 2006.[13] In August 2013 JCPenney closed its store inside the mall.[14][15] In the same year, a Michaels opened up next to TJMaxx.[16]
