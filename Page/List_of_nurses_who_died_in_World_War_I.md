An estimated 1,500 nurses from a number of countries lost their lives during World War I.[1] Some died from disease or accidents, and some from enemy action.


Australia

Norma_Mowbray's_grave,_Cairo.jpg 29 Australian nurses died from disease or injuries; 25 of these died on active service, and 4 died in Australia from injuries or illness sustained during their service.[2] Most of these nurses were serving in the Australian Army Nursing Service; however, a small number were serving with Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service, one of a number of British Army nursing services during World War I.[3] Other Australian women made their own way to Europe and joined the British Red Cross, private hospitals or other allied services.[4]
