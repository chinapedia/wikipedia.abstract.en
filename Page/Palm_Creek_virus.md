PALM CREEK VIRUS (PCV) is an insect virus belonging to the genus _Flavivirus_, of the family _Flaviviridae_. It was discovered in 2013 from the mosquito _Coquillettidia xanthogaster_. The female mosquitoes were originally collected in 2010 from Darwin, Katherine, Alice Springs, Alyangula, Groote Eylandt, Jabiru and the McArthur River Mine, and had since been preserved. The discovery was made by biologists at the University of Queensland.[1] The virus is named after Palm Creek, near Darwin, from where it was originally isolated.[2]

PCV is the first insect-specific virus discovered in Australia. Genetically it most closely related to Nakiwogo virus, isolated from _Mansonia_ mosquito in Uganda, and clustered more broadly with _Culex_-associated viruses, such as _Culex flavivirus_ (CxFV).In one experiment in 2016, when cultivated mosquito [_Aedes albopictus_ (C6/36)] cells were preinfected with PCV, human-pathogenic viruses such as West Nile and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses were found to be unable to develop in the infected cells.[3]

The follow-up experiment confirmed the fact that pre-infection of mosquitoes prevents transmission of harmful arbovirus. Further, it shown that PCV could not infect _Culex annulirostris_, the primary vector of encephalitic flaviviruses in Australian, through blood meal indicating that the virus is not a threat to human, or other vertebrate, health. However, the virus could be inoculated (at the thorax region) with successful infection in the _C. annulirostris_, _Aedes aegypti_ and _A. vigilax_. This further supports the fact that preinfection of these disease-vector mosquitoes with PCV can be prevented from transmitting harmful viral diseases in humans, since a mosquito generally do not carry mixed infection.[4]

The PCV genome encodes a polyprotein that consists of 3,364 amino acids. Genetic analysis shows that it is most closely related African virus Nakiwogo virus (NAKV), sharing 63.7% nucleotide similarity.[5] A report indicates that the virus is also closely related to _Assam virus_, discovered in Assam, India, in 2015.[6]
