HEMATITE, also spelled as HAEMATITE, is a common iron oxide with the formula Fe₂O₃ and is widespread in rocks and soils.[1] Hematite crystallizes in the rhombohedral lattice system, and it has the same crystal structure as ilmenite and corundum. Hematite and ilmenite form a complete solid solution at temperatures above .

Hematite is colored black to steel or silver-gray, brown to reddish brown, or red. It is mined as the main ore of iron. Varieties include _kidney ore_, _martite_ (pseudomorphs after magnetite), _iron rose_ and _specularite_ (specular hematite). While the forms of hematite vary, they all have a rust-red streak. Hematite is harder than pure iron, but much more brittle. Maghemite is a hematite- and magnetite-related oxide mineral.

Hematite_-_Titanomagnitite.jpg Huge deposits of hematite are found in banded iron formations. Gray hematite is typically found in places that can have still standing water or mineral hot springs, such as those in Yellowstone National Park in North America. The mineral can precipitate out of water and collect in layers at the bottom of a lake, spring, or other standing water. Hematite can also occur without water, however, usually as the result of volcanic activity.

Clay-sized hematite crystals can also occur as a secondary mineral formed by weathering processes in soil, and along with other iron oxides or oxyhydroxides such as goethite, is responsible for the red color of many tropical, ancient, or otherwise highly weathered soils. Hematite_structure.jpg


Etymology and history

The name hematite is derived from the Greek word for blood _haima_, due to the red coloration found in some varieties of hematite[2]. The color of hematite lends itself to use as a pigment. The English name of the stone is derived from Middle French _hématite pierre_, which was imported from Latin _lapis haematites_ around the 15th century, which originated from Ancient Greek (_haimatitēs lithos_, "blood-red stone").

Ochre is a clay that is colored by varying amounts of hematite, varying between 20% and 70%.[3] Red ochre contains unhydrated hematite, whereas yellow ochre contains hydrated hematite (Fe₂O₃ · H₂O). The principal use of ochre is for tinting with a permanent color.[4]

The red chalk writing of this mineral was one of the earliest in the history of humans. The powdery mineral was first used 164,000 years ago by the Pinnacle-Point man possibly for social purposes.[5] Hematite residues are also found in graves from 80,000 years ago. Near Rydno in Poland and Lovas in Hungary red chalk mines have been found that are from 5000 BC, belonging to the Linear Pottery culture at the Upper Rhine.[6]

Rich deposits of hematite have been found on the island of Elba that have been mined since the time of the Etruscans.


Magnetism

Hematite is an antiferromagnetic material below the Morin transition at , and a canted antiferromagnet or weakly ferromagnetic above the Morin transition and below its Néel temperature at , above which it is paramagnetic.

The magnetic structure of α-hematite was the subject of considerable discussion and debate in the 1950s because it appeared to be ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of around , but with an extremely tiny magnetic moment (0.002 _µ__(B)). Adding to the surprise was a transition with a decrease in temperature at around to a phase with no net magnetic moment. It was shown that the system is essentially antiferromagnetic, but that the low symmetry of the cation sites allows spin–orbit coupling to cause canting of the moments when they are in the plane perpendicular to the _c_ axis. The disappearance of the moment with a decrease in temperature at is caused by a change in the anisotropy which causes the moments to align along the _c_ axis. In this configuration, spin canting does not reduce the energy.[7][8] The magnetic properties of bulk hematite differ from their nanoscale counterparts. For example, the Morin transition temperature of hematite decreases with a decrease in the particle size. The suppression of this transition has been observed in hematite nanoparticles and is attributed to the presence of impurities, water molecules and defects in the crystals lattice. Hematite is part of a complex solid solution oxyhydroxide system having various contents of water, hydroxyl groups and vacancy substitutions that affect the mineral's magnetic and crystal chemical properties.[9] Two other end-members are referred to as protohematite and hydrohematite.

Enhanced magnetic coercivities for hematite have been achieved by dry-heating a two-line ferrihydrite precursor prepared from solution. Hematite exhibited temperature-dependent magnetic coercivity values ranging from . The origin of these high coercivity values has been interpreted as a consequence of the subparticle structure induced by the different particle and crystallite size growth rates at increasing annealing temperature. These differences in the growth rates are translated into a progressive development of a subparticle structure at the nanoscale. At lower temperatures (350–600 °C), single particles crystallize however; at higher temperatures (600–1000 °C), the growth of crystalline aggregates with a subparticle structure is favored.[10]


Mine tailings

Hematite is present in the waste tailings of iron mines. A recently developed process, magnetation, uses magnets to glean waste hematite from old mine tailings in Minnesota's vast Mesabi Range iron district.[11] Falu red is a pigment used in traditional Swedish house paints. Originally, it was made from tailings of the Falu mine.[12]


Mars

The spectral signature of hematite was seen on the planet Mars by the infrared spectrometer on the NASA _Mars Global Surveyor_ and _2001 Mars Odyssey_ spacecraft in orbit around Mars.[13] The mineral was seen in abundance at two sites[14] on the planet, the Terra Meridiani site, near the Martian equator at 0° longitude, and the Aram Chaos site near the Valles Marineris.[15] Several other sites also showed hematite, such as Aureum Chaos.[16] Because terrestrial hematite is typically a mineral formed in aqueous environments or by aqueous alteration, this detection was scientifically interesting enough that the second of the two Mars Exploration Rovers was sent to a site in the Terra Meridiani region designated Meridiani Planum. In-situ investigations by the _Opportunity_ rover showed a significant amount of hematite, much of it in the form of small spherules that were informally named "blueberries" by the science team. Analysis indicates that these spherules are apparently concretions formed from a water solution. "Knowing just how the hematite on Mars was formed will help us characterize the past environment and determine whether that environment was favorable for life".[17]


Jewelry

Hematite's popularity in jewelry rose in England during the Victorian era, due to its use in mourning jewelry.[18][19] Certain types of hematite- or iron-oxide-rich clay, especially Armenian bole, have been used in gilding. Hematite is also used in art such as in the creation of intaglio engraved gems. Hematine is a synthetic material sold as _magnetic hematite_.[20]
