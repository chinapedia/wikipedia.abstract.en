Production

In September 2014, as part of its efforts to increase kids' programming, it was announced that Netflix had ordered from Rainbow Studios two seasons of _World of Winx_, each comprising 13 22-minute episodes.[2][3] The premise of the show is that the "girls embark on an undercover journey all around the world looking for talented kids in art, sports, music and science." Netflix at the time already had a pact with Rainbow to show some of the seasons of _Winx Club_, its films, and other Rainbow shows such as _PopPixie_ and _Mia and Me_.[4]

Originally slated to premiere in early 2016,[5] the series was delayed until later that year, eventually premiering in 4 November as a Netflix original series.[6][7][8] Rainbow promoted the show briefly at the Licensing Expo in Las Vegas in 2016, along with shows _Regal Academy_ and _Maggie & Bianca Fashion Friends_. At the event, it was revealed that the storyline involved a Talent Thief that had been capturing children.[9] The second and final season was released on Netflix on 16 June 2017.[10]


Reception

Ella Anders, a regular reviewer of magical girl-themed shows on _BSC Kids_, had low expectations on the series given that the more recent seasons of _Winx Club_ were shells of their original, but said "So it was all that much stranger when I realized just how good _World of Winx_ actually is". She liked that the series made the story meaningful. "Every moment counts, the story is a good one that is tightly woven together. The humour and heart shines. The girls are using their magic wisely and creatively." She especially liked that the Winx girls were "back to their old selves".[11]
