The SNOW LEOPARD CONSERVANCY INDIA TRUST (SLC-IT) was formed in 2000 as the Indian branch of the Snow Leopard Conservancy. It became an independent Indian organization in 2003. Since its inception, the SLC-IT has worked to protect the highly threatened snow leopard (Uncia uncia), its prey species, and its habitat in India. SLC-IT focuses on promoting community-based solutions to the problems facing the snow leopard throughout its Indian range. The organization pioneered the award-winning Himalayan Homestays Program in 2003. Apart from conservation, the organization also conducts ecological research on the snow leopard, its prey species, which help in guiding the conservation programs.


Community-based Conservation

Community-based conservation is accorded the highest priority because the organization believes that snow leopard and other wildlife of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas in Asia cannot be conserved without the support of the local people who share resources with the snow leopard and other wildlife on a daily basis[1].

Therefore, the organization has been working tirelessly at the grassroots level to improve the livelihoods so that members of the local community come on board the conservation wagon. Today, fifteen years after the Himalayan Homestays and other community conservation programs were put in place, people are trying to attract the wild animals close to their villages, which is one of the foremost conservation success stories in India as well as outside.
