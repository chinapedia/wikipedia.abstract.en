FARELLONES FORMATION () is a geological formation of Miocene age in the Andes of Central Chile up almost entirely of volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks. At some location reaches thicknesses in excess of .[1] It overlies the Oligo–Miocene Abanico Formation across a diachronous unconformity.[2] The best exposure of the formation is said to be at the ski resort of Farellones east of Santiago.[3]


Description

Jorge Muñoz Cristi was in 1957 the first to define the rocks of Farellones as distinct unit and not as a facies as previously thought. Carlos Klohn then established the Farellones unit as a formation in 1960.[4]

Rivano and co-workers define two sub-units of the formation: a lower member made up of rather fresh rhyolitic ignimbrite and tuff, and an upper member made up of lavas of basaltic and andesitic composition.[5] The volcanic rocks of Farellones Formation have mostly a calc-alkaline character contrasting with the mostly tholeiitic Abanico Formation.[6]

From the latitude of Santiago to Rancagua the base of the formation becomes progressively younger and outcrops more scarce.[7][8] In the mentioned latitudes the formation has been deformed by a diachronous tectonic inversion that produced reverse faults and destroyed the extensional sedimentary basin were the rocks deposited and contributed to the uplift of the Andes in the Late Miocene.[9]
