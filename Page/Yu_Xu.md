Yu joined the People's Liberation Army Air Force in September 2005. Yu appeared with the other female pilots at the 2010 CCTV New Year's Gala.[7] In 2012, she was certified to fly the Chengdu J-10, single-engine jet.[8]


Death

Yu died during an aerobatic training session on November 12, 2016 after being struck by another plane as she ejected from the J-10.[9] However, some official press reported she was unable to eject on time from her plane before it made impact with the ground.[10] Citing military sources and witnesses, said Yu ejected from her aircraft after it collided with another during the training. After the ejection, the wing of another plane hit Yu, killing her, according to a report from China Daily. Yu's male co-pilot ejected safely and survived, the report said. The other jet also landed safety. On Weibo, Yu was saluted as a hero. "Yu Xu is our most proud female pilot. Her death is a great loss for our country," wrote one poster. Her ashes were taken to Chongzhou sports center for a public commemoration: 360,000 people from all over the country came to mourn her and place flowers outside the mourning hall. The ashes of pilot Yu Xu have been returned to her hometown of Chongzhou in the southwestern province of Sichuan and placed in a cemetery for revolutionary martyrs.
