DAIGLE is an unincorporated community in the town of New Canada, in Aroostook County, Maine, United States.[1] It is the only named community in the town.

The settlement is located south of Fort Kent. Daigle Pond and Dam are located there.[2]


History

The first settlers were Vital Daigle and his wife Julie Cyr.[3] They came from nearby Frenchville, Maine, seeking a new home for their family.[4] The deed to the property was dated 1858, and listed 13 Daigle family members.[5]

Other settlers from Frenchville followed, and the small community of Daigle developed.[6]

In 1882, Vital Daigle developed a property called "New Canada Plantation" south of the family homestead, where Daigle manufactured lumber.[7][8] The township adopted the name "New Canada".[9]

Daigle had a post office from 1899 to 1933,[10] and Vital Daigle was the first postmaster.[11]

A church called Holy Family Parish was built in 1906. A cemetery was also established. In 1909, the church was destroyed by fire, but was rebuilt the following year. The church closed in 2000 and was demolished, and a monument was erected to mark its place. The property was sold to the town of New Canada where a community center was to be built. The cemetery is extant, and contains the graves of many early families.[12][13]
