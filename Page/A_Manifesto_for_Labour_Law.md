_A MANIFESTO FOR LABOUR LAW: TOWARDS A COMPREHENSIVE REVISION OF WORKERS’ RIGHTS_ (Institute of Employment Rights, 2016) is a set of reform proposals for UK labour law, written by fifteen labour rights experts in academia and legal practice from the UK, Europe and the Commonwealth.[1] It is edited by Keith D. Ewing, John Hendy QC and Carolyn Jones. The _Manifesto_ urges that to stop low productivity, rising inequality, stagnant low wages, and poor working conditions, there should be a shift toward sectoral collective bargaining, worker voice in corporate governance, and a renewed Ministry of Labour with power to support democracy at work. In full, it lists 25 recommendations for reform.
