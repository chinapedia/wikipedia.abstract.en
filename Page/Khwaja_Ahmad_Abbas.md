KHWAJA AHMAD ABBAS (7 June 1914 – 1 June 1987)[1], popularly known as K. A. ABBAS, was an Indian film director, screenwriter, novelist, and a journalist in the Urdu, Hindi and English languages. He won four National Film Awards in India, and internationally his films won the Palme d'Or (Grand Prize) at the Cannes Film Festival (out of three Palme d'Or nominations) and the Crystal Globe at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. As a director and screenwriter, Khwaja Ahmad Abbas is considered one of the pioneers of Indian parallel or neo-realistic cinema,[2] and as a screenwriter he is also known for writing Raj Kapoor's best films.[3]

As a director, he made a number of important Hindi-Urdu films. _Dharti Ke Lal_ (1946), about the Bengal famine of 1943, was one of Indian cinema's first social-realist films,[4] and opened up the overseas market for Indian films in the Soviet Union.[5] _Pardesi_ (1957) was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. _Shehar Aur Sapna_ (1963) won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film, while _Saat Hindustani_ (1969) and _Do Boond Pani_ (1972) both won the National Film Awards for Best Feature Film on National Integration.

As a screenwriter, he penned a number of neo-realistic films, such as _Dharti Ke Lal_ (which he directed),[6] _Neecha Nagar_ (1946) which won the Palme d'Or at the first Cannes Film Festival, _Naya Sansar_ (1941), _Jagte Raho_ (1956), and _Saat Hindustani_ (which he also directed). He is also known for writing the best of Raj Kapoor's films, including the Palme d'Or nominated _Awaara_ (1951), as well as _Shree 420_ (1955), _Mera Naam Joker_ (1970), _Bobby_ (1973) and _Henna_ (1991).[7]

His column ‘Last Page’ holds the distinction of being one of the longest-running columns in the history of Indian journalism. The column began in 1935, in _The Bombay Chronicle_, and moved to the _Blitz_ after the _Chronicle_'s closure, where it continued until his death in 1987.[8] He was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 1969.


Biography

Early life and education

Khwaja Ahmad Abbas was born in Panipat, Undivided Punjab. He was born in the home of celebrated Urdu poet, Khwaja Altaf Hussain Hali, a student of Mirza Ghalib. His grandfather Khwaja Gulam Abbas was one of the chief rebels of the 1857 Rebellion movement, and the first martyr of Panipat to be blown from the mouth of a cannon. Abbas's father Ghulam-Us-Sibtain graduated from Aligarh Muslim University, was a tutor of a prince and a prosperous businessman, who modernised the preparation of Unani medicines. Abbas's mother, 'Masroor Khatoon', was the daughter of Sajjad Husain, an enlightened educationist. Abbas took his early education in 'Hali Muslim High School', which was established by his great grand father Hali. He had his early education till 7th in Panipat. He was instructed to read the Arabic text of the Quran and his childhood dreams swung at the compulsive behest of his father. Abbas completed his matriculation at the age of fifteen. He did his B.A. with English literature in 1933 and LL.B. in 1935 from Aligarh Muslim University.

Career

Abbas began his career as a journalist, when he joined 'National Call', a New Delhi based newspaper after finishing his B.A.. Later while studying law in 1934, started 'Aligarh Opinion', India's first university students' weekly during the pre-independence period.

After completing his education at Aligarh Muslim University, Abbas joined _The Bombay Chronicle_ in 1935. He occasionally served a film critic, but after the film critic of the paper died, he was made the editor of the film section.

He entered films as a part-time publicist for Bombay Talkies in 1936, a production house owned by Himanshu Rai and Devika Rani, to whom he sold his first screenplay _Naya Sansar_ (1941).[9]

While at _The Bombay Chronicle_, (1935–1947), he started a weekly column called 'Last Page', which he continued when he joined the Blitz magazine.[10] "The Last Page", (‘Azad Kalam’ in the Urdu edition), thus became the longest-running political column in India's history (1935–87).[11] A collection of these columns was later published as two books. He continued to write for The Blitz and Mirror till his last days.

Meanwhile, he had started writing scripts for other directors, _Neecha Nagar_ for Chetan Anand and _Dr. Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani_ for V. Shantaram.

In 1945, he made his directorial debut with a film based on the Bengal famine of 1943, _Dharti Ke Lal_ (_Children of the Earth_) for the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA). In 1951, he founded his own production company called Naya Sansar, which consistently produced films that were socially relevant including, _Anhonee_, _Munna_, _Rahi_ (1953), based on a Mulk Raj Anand story, was on the plight of workers on tea plantations, the National Film Award winner, _Shehar Aur Sapna_ (1964) and _Saat Hindustani_ (1969), which won the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration and is also remembered as Bollywood icon Amitabh Bachchan's debut film.

A prolific writer, and novelist, during his illustrious career spanning five decades, Abbas wrote over 73 books in English, Hindi and Urdu.[12] Abbas was considered a leading light of the Urdu short story.[13] His best known fictional work remains 'Inquilab', based Communal violence, which made him a household name in Indian literature.[14] Like Inquilab, many of his works were translated into many Indian, and foreign languages, like Russian, German, Italian, French and Arabic.

Abbas interviewed several renowned personalities in literary and non-literary fields, including the Russian Prime Minister Khrushchov, American President Roosevelt, Charlie Chaplin, Mao-Tse-Tung and Yuri Gagarin.

He went on to write scripts for Jagte Raho, and most of the prominent Raj Kapoor films including _Awaara, Shri 420, Mera Naam Joker, Bobby_ and _Henna_.

His autobiography, _I Am not an Island: An Experiment in Autobiography_, was first published in 1977 and later released in 2010.[15]


Censorship case

In 1968, Abbas made a documentary film called _Char Shaher Ek Kahani_ (A Tale of Four Cities).[16] The film depicted the contrast between the luxurious life of the rich in the four cities of Calcutta, Bombay, Madras and Delhi and that of the squalor and poverty of the poor. He approached the Central Board of Film Certification in order to obtain a 'U' (Unrestricted Public Exhibition) certificate. Abbas was however informed by the regional office of the Board that film was not eligible to be granted a 'U' certificate but was suitable for exhibition only for adults. His appeal to the revising committee of the Central Board of Film Certification led to the decision of the censors being upheld.[17]

Khwaja Ahmad Abbas further appealed to the Central Government but the government decided to grant the film a 'U' certificate provided certain scenes were cut. Following this, Abbas approached the Supreme Court of India by filing a writ petition under Article 32 of the Indian Constitution. He claimed that his fundamental right of free speech and expression was denied by the Central Government's refusal to grant the film a 'U' certificate.[18] Abbas also challenged the constitutional validity of pre-censorship on films.[19]

However the Supreme Court of India upheld the constitutional validity pre-censorship on films. [20][21]
