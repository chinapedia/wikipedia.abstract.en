The POLICY AND RESOURCES COMMITTEE is the Senior Committee of the system of government in Guernsey, it was created on 1 May 2016 to replace the Policy Council of Guernsey.

Guernsey operates a system of government by committees and consensus. There are no political parties. The members of the parliament, which is known as the States of Deliberation, are elected as independents. The States of Deliberation is both parliament and executive, but it delegates most of its executive functions to policy-specific committees, which are known as the six principal committees, each of which is run by five political members, all of whom have equal voting power.


Objectives

To provide advice for the States of Guernsey, to develop policies and programmes and to implement such policies when approved relating to:[1]

-   Leadership and co-ordination of the work of the States
-   Fiscal policy, economic affairs and the financial and other resources of the States

-   Other matters which have been delegated to the Committee
