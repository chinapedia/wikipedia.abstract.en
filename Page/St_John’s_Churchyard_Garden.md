The ST. JOHN'S CHURCHYARD GARDEN is a small public garden in the center of the Welsh capital Cardiff in United Kingdom. It is located between St John's Church and the Old Library. The park is around 1000 mÂ² in size and is enclosed by cast iron railings. On the site, next to some old trees (including a large magnolia tree)[1] are some flower beds and a central monument in the form of a shrine. The park is equipped with benches.

Originally part of the graveyard of St John's Church, the railings and gates (dating from the 1890s) are Grade II listed.[2]
