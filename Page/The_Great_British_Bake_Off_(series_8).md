Episode 4: Caramel

For the first signature challenge, the bakers were required to produce 18 identical millionaire shortbread bars in 2 hours and 15 minutes. The technical challenge was set by Prue where the bakers were tasked to make stroopwafels in 1 hour and 45 minutes. Only one test waffle was allowed, and the challenge proved to be a very difficult one for the bakers with none of them producing an adequate caramel. For the final showstopper challenge, the bakers were required to make a caramel cake consisting of at least three layers of sponge in 3 ½ hours. They were required to incorporate spun sugar into their decorations.[22]

Episode 5: Puddings

For the signature challenge, the eight remaining bakers were required to bake a steamed school pudding with an accompaniment such as a compote or a custard in 3 hours. The technical challenge was set by Paul, which was 6 molten chocolate puddings with a peanut butter filling in 1 hour. Each baker was called one at a time so their puddings could be ready at different times for Paul and Prue to judge (starting with Julia, followed by Sophie, Liam, Steven, Yan, Kate, James and finally Stacey). For the showstopper challenge, the bakers were asked to bake an ornamental trifle terrine with three elements – a baked element, a set custard or mousse, and a jelly, in 4 ½ hours .[23]

Episode 7: Italian

For the first ever Italian week in Bake Off, the bakers were given hours to make the required 18 Sicilian cannoli with three different types of fillings. This week's Italian technical challenge was set by Prue, where the bakers were tasked to make the well-known, yet tricky, pizza margherita with a thin crispy base in hours. For the showstopper challenge, the bakers were required to make a very technically challenging and fiddly Italian bake: 24 sfogliatelle with two types of fillings in hours.[25]

Episode 8: Forgotten bakes

The bakers were required to make four Bedfordshire clangers within 2 hours in the signature challenge. They must each contain a savoury filling at one end and a sweet filling at the other, and be made from suet crust pastry. In the technical challenge, set by Paul, the bakers were tasked to make a traditional Cumberland rum nicky: a large tart consisting of a sweet shortcrust pastry and a rum-soaked fruity filling covered with a lattice top, and served with a smooth rum butter. For the historic showstopper, the bakers were required to make a Victorian Savoy cake.[26]

Episode 9: Pâtisserie (semi-final)

For the semifinal signature bakes, the bakers were asked to make 24 choux buns, in which 12 must have a crunchy craquelin on top and the other 12 must be covered with icing. The penultimate technical challenge was set by Prue, where the bakers were tasked with a very difficult job of making 9 Les Misérables slices. For the showstopper challenge before the final, the bakers were asked to make a meringue centrepiece, containing at least two different types of meringue and a dessert element, in 4 hours and 45 minutes.[27]

Episode 10: Final

For the signature challenge in the final, the last three bakers were tasked to make a batch of 12 small loaves. There must be three different types of loaves: four need to be intricately shaped (e.g. plaited), four need to be flavoured, and four need to be made from an alternative grain such as spelt or buckwheat. Prue set the final technical challenge and asked the bakers to make 10 ginger biscuits, half of them to be oval and half of them to be square.[28] They all need to have a great snap and be intricately iced with two complicated patterns. For the ultimate showstopper challenge, the bakers were tasked to make one large entremet. The entremet must have a minimum of five elements, one of which must be a sponge, and covered with a glaze or ganache.[29]

For the signature challenge, the bakers were asked to create a Christmas family favourite: Yule Log. The technical challenge was set by Prue, and tasked the bakers to make 12 lattice mince pies, served with brandy butter, with very limited instructions and ingredients provided. The showstopper challenge featured the bakers creating 8 snow globe cakes using a sugar glass dome to encase an edible Christmas scene on top of an entremet.

_The Big Festive Bake Off_

The bakers were required to make 6 snowy bombe Alaska tarts in the signature challenge. The technical challenge was set by Paul, where the bakers were tasked to make a pistachio Kransekake Christmas tree consisting of twelve layers of concentric rings, topped with a star. For the final showstopper challenge, the bakers were required to make a magical ice cake with elaborate sugar work that create a scene of winter wonderland.

Controversies

On 31 October 2017, judge Prue Leith accidentally revealed Sophie Faldo as the winner of the series on Twitter twelve hours before the finale was due to air. This caused uproar among many fans of the show. She quickly deleted the tweet and apologised to the fans who saw the tweet.[32]


Ratings

The first episode to be broadcast on Channel 4 received an overnight viewing figure of 6.5 million, which is the channel's highest viewing figure since the opening ceremony for the 2012 Paralympics, but down from the 10 million obtained in the previous series on BBC One.[33] The overnight viewing figure for the final was 7.7 million (8.9 million at its peak), lower than the 14 million for the equivalent episode on BBC One in 2016.[34]

Official episode viewing figures are from BARB. Figures are total counts including HD and Channel 4 +1.[35]
