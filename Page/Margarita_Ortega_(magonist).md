Margarita Ortega}} MARGARITA ORTEGA VALDÉS (Sonora, 1871 – Mexicali, 23 November 1913)[1] was a Mexican weapons expert, crack shot, nurse, courier, spy,[2] and the best-known magonist woman soldier. Ortega was born into a wealthy Sonoran family, headed by Dolores Valdés and Pablo Ortega. They moved to Baja California in 1891, where the following year, in Tecate, Ortega married Pascual Gortar. The couple had a daughter, Rosaura Gortari Ortega, before Pascual died. While Rosaura was still an infant, Ortega married again, to Manuel Demara, son of Antonio Demara of Tecate.[3] In 1911, Ortega became member of the Mexican Liberal Party in Baja California, participating in the armed revolt against Porfirio Díaz.[4][5] In 1913, the Mexican militia captured, tortured and killed Ortega.
