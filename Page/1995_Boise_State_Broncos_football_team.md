The Broncos competed in the Big Sky Conference and played their home games on campus at Bronco Stadium in Boise, Idaho. Led by third-year head coach Pokey Allen, Boise State finished the season 7–4 overall and 4–3 in conference, ranked 21st in the final regular

This was Boise State's final season as a member of the Big Sky and Division I-AA; they began play in Division I-A in the Big West Conference in 1996.


Season

Coming off a successful previous season of 13–2 and the runner-up in the national championship,[1] BSU was ranked eighth in the preseason I-AA poll,[2] and climbed to third after an opening victory at Division I-A Utah State.[3][4] A three-game losing streak dropped them out of the poll by mid-season,[5] after wide-margin losses to Montana and Northern Arizona.[6][7]

After five consecutive wins, the Broncos climbed back to #16 prior to the regular season finale at rival Idaho,[8] whom they defeated the previous year in Boise to break a twelve-game losing streak in the series.[9] With a likely playoff berth on the line;[10][11] BSU lost by twenty in the Kibbie Dome to end their season in a four-way tied for second place.[12][13][14] Surging Idaho (6–4) was selected for the final at-large berth for the postseason,[15][16][17] but was matched against top-ranked McNeese State in southwest Louisiana and made a quick exit.[18][19][20]


Allen's cancer

Allen had been diagnosed in December 1994 with rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare form of muscle cancer.[21][22] The tumor in his upper right arm was removed in March and he underwent extensive chemotherapy and a stem-cell transplant in July at the Fred Hutchinson Center in Seattle.[23] He returned to coach the Broncos while going through treatment, and the cancer was declared in remission in December 1995, but the doctors warned of likely recurrence.
