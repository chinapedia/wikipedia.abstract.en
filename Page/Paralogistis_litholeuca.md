_PARALOGISTIS LITHOLEUCA_ is a moth of the Scythrididae family. It was described by Meyrick in 1921. It is found in Mozambique and South Africa (Gauteng).[1]

The wingspan is about 17Â mm. The forewings are grey- whitish finely irrorated with blackish. The markings are formed of coarser black irroration: some undefined suffusion towards the base of the costa, a dot beneath the fold at an irregular raised transverse mark from the dorsum before the middle of the wing reaching somewhat beyond the fold, and a round submedian dot above the tornus. The hindwings are grey.[2]
