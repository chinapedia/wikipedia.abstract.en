The 1ST CURTIS CUP MATCH was played on 21 May 1932 at Wentworth Golf Club in Virginia Water, Surrey, England. The United States won 5½ to 3½.[1][2]

The match was played on the East course, measuring about 6,000 yards. The foursomes began at 10:30 am and the singles at 2 pm. All the match pairings were announced the previous day. Britain used all 8 of their players while the Americans used the same six in both sessions.[3][4] The United States won all three foursomes matches and, although Britain did better in the afternoon, America won two singles matches and won the contest.[5]


Format

The contest was played in a single day, with three foursomes in the morning and six singles matches in the afternoon, a total of 9 points.

Each of the 9 matches was worth one point in the larger team competition. If a match was all square after the 18th hole extra holes were not played. Rather, each side earned ½ a point toward their team total. The team that accumulated at least 5 points won the competition.


Teams

Eight players for Great Britain & Ireland and USA participated in the event. Both teams had a playing captain, although the American captain, Marion Hollins, was one of the two reserves.
