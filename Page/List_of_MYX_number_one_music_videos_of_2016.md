Singer Sarah Geronimo kicked off the year with "Minamahal" as it ran for a week and began its reign at the latter part of 2015.[1] Some artists including Darren Espanto made the most number ones with 5. James Reid and Juan Karlos Labajo also gave multiple number ones, both have 2. On January 1 of 2017, Sarah Geronimo's "Tala" became the Myx Hit Chart's Number One Music Video of 2016.
