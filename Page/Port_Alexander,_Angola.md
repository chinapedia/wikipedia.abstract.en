Geography

Port Alexander is a very well-sheltered bay of the South Atlantic Ocean. The bay is facing east, with high sandstone cliffs rising from the Ponta do Porto, the promontory guarding the eastern end of the harbour located at the end of the protecting landspit. _Saco da Baleia_ is a bay located west of the western end of the spit.[2]

The town of TÃ´mbwa is located on the southern shore of the bay. It was formerly a whaling port,[3] but currently it is an important harbor for oil production and fishing in the area. The port has refrigeration facilities installed with European Union assistance at the Tombwa canning factory.[4]
