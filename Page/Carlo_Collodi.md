Pinocchio.jpg (1852–1910), the first illustrator (1883) of _The Adventures of Pinocchio_]] CARLO LORENZINI, better known by the pen name CARLO COLLODI (; 24 November 1826 – 26 October 1890), was an Italian author, humorist,[1] and journalist,[2] widely known for his fairy tale novel _The Adventures of Pinocchio_.


Early life

Collodi was born in Florence on 24 November 1826. His mother Angiolina Orzali was a seamstress from the town of Collodi from which he took the pen name and his father, Domenico Lorenzini was a cook and both worked for the Marquis Ginori Lisci.[3] Collodi was the eldest in the family[4] and he had 10 siblings but seven died at a young age. He spent most of his childhood in the town of Collodi where his mother was born. He lived there with his grandmother. After attending primary school, he was sent to study at a seminary called Colle Val d'Elsa.[5] An account explained that Ginori offered financial aid but the boy found that he did not want to be a priest so he continued his education at the College of the Scolopi Fathers in Florence.[6] Two years later, he started working at the bookstore Libreria Piatti, where he assisted Giuseppe Aiazzi, a prominent Italian manuscript specialist.[7]


Career

During the Italian Wars of Independence in 1848 and 1860 Collodi served as a volunteer with the Tuscan army. His active interest in political matters may be seen in his earliest literary works as well as in the founding of the satirical newspaper _Il Lampione_ in 1853. This newspaper was censored by order of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In 1854 he published his second newspaper, _Lo scaramuccia_ ("The Controversy").[8] Lorenzini's first publications were in his periodicals. A debut came in 1856 with the play _Gli amici di casa_ and parodic guidebook _Un romanzo in vapore_, both in 1856.[9] By 1860, he published his first notable work called _Il signor Alberi ha ragione!_ (Mr. Alberi Is Right!), which outlined his political and cultural vision of Italy. This is the text where Lorenzini started using the Collodi pseudonym, which was taken from his mother's hometown.[10]

Collodi had also begun intense activity on other political newspapers such as _Il Fanfulla_; at the same time he was employed by the Censorship Commission for the Theatre. During this period he composed various satirical sketches and stories (sometimes simply by collating earlier articles), including _Macchiette_ (1880), _Occhi e nasi_ (1881), _Storie allegre_ (1887).[11]

Collodi became disenchanted with Italian politics afterward so he turned to children's literature and his first works involved translating French fairy tales into Italian.[12] In 1875, for instance, he completed _Racconti delle fate_, a translation of French fairy tales by Charles Perrault. In 1876 Lorenzini wrote _Giannettino_ (inspired by Alessandro Luigi Parravicini's _Giannetto_), the _Minuzzolo_, and _Il viaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino_, a pedagogic series which explored the unification of Italy through the ironic thoughts and actions of the character Giannettino.[13]

Lorenzini became fascinated by the idea of using an amiable, rascally character as a means of expressing his own convictions through allegory. In 1880 he began writing _Storia di un burattino_ (_Story of a Marionette_), also called _Le avventure di Pinocchio_, which was published weekly in _Il Giornale per i Bambini_, the first Italian newspaper for children.[14] Pinocchio was adapted into a 1940 film by Disney that is considered to be one of Disney's greatest. [15][16][17]

Collodi died suddenly in Florence on 26 October 1890 and lies buried in Cimitero Monumentale Delle Porte Sante, Firenze, Toscana, Italy.[18] The National Carlo Collodi Foundation was established to promote education and the works of Carlo Lorenzini, and the Park of Pinocchio attracts many visitors each year.
