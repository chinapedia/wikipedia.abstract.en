The LIBRA PARTY or _Equal List_ () is a political party in Albania. It was founded in 2016.[1]


History

Blushi_Ben.jpg The party was founded by Ben Blushi, a prominent politician/writer, and Mimoza Hafizi; both former MPs of the Socialist Party of Albania. They left the Socialist Party after months of discussions with the leader Edi Rama and opposed the government's decisions. The pair wanted elections to be held within the party to elect a new leader. In October 2016, after leaving the party they created LIBRA, which in Albanian is an acronym for 'Lista e Barabartë' (The equal list).

Currently both Ben Blushi and Mimoza Hafizi serve as Members of the National Assembly from the LIBRA Party.
