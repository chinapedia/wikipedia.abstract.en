SOMALI FACES is an online project[1] that shares everyday stories of ordinary Somali people from around the world. It was founded by Mohammed Ibrahim Shire, a storyteller, author and an academic. The blog had over 70,000 followers on Facebook[2] and around 21,600 followers on Instagram[3] as of June 2017.

The project has two main aims. The first is global, seeking to reconstruct the image of Somalis as a peaceful, resilient people, thereby challenging stereotypes that peg them as terrorists, pirates, warlords and refugees.[4] The second is national: a compassionate reminder to the Somali people to rise above petty clannism "and earnestly understand that your fellow co-ethnic has his/her own struggles, dreams, regrets and aspirations."[5]

Somali diaspora

Mohammed and Donia started the Somali Faces platform in January 2016. They have travelled across Europe and Americas by initially focused on Somalis living in the Diaspora. This allowed them to narrate the Diaspora experience in the face of perpetual negativity of Somalis in the media.

Somalis in Somalia

Following this, they have started touring the Horn of Africa visiting many remote villages and towns in Somalia and Somaliland to capture the human stories.


Humanitarianism

In January 2017, following the gang rape of two Somali girls in Galdogob, Somalia, and the subsequent release of the video footage, Somali Faces raised emergency funds online to resettle the two families.[6]
