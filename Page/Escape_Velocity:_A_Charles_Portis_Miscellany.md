_ESCAPE VELOCITY: A CHARLES PORTIS MISCELLANY_ is a collection of non-fiction, journalism, short stories, and single play - _Delray's New Moon_ - by the novelist Charles Portis, the author most famous for _True Grit_. Subjects covered by Portis include the civil rights movement, a road trip in Baja, and Elvis Presley's visit to his aging mother. Some of the works originally appeared in such publications such as the New York Herald Tribune and Saturday Evening Post.[1][2]

At the time of its first publication in 2012, it was the first work by Portis in twenty-one years since _Gringos_.

The book also has an epilogue consisting an interview with Charles Portis by Roy Reed; and five appendix tributes to the author by Roy Blount Jr, Ed Park, Ron Rosenbaum, Donna Tartt and Wells Tower.[3]

In the New York Times review of the book, Carlo Rotella said, "You can enjoy _Escape Velocity_ as a stand-alone collection, but a Portis miscellany will always be read too as a key to the experiences and craft lessons that shaped the novels."[4]
