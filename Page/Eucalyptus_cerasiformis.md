Description

_Eucalyptus cerasiformis_ is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and has smooth, pale grey and white, sometimes powdery bark. The adult leaves are thin and the same glossy, grey-green on both sides. The leaf blade is narrow lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are borne in groups of seven in leaf axils on a thin peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are more or less cylindrical, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum with a point on the tip. Flowering occurs between December and March and the flowers are pale yellow or whitish. The fruit is a woody cylindrical, bell-shaped, urn-shaped or hemispherical capsule.[2][3][4][5]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus cerasiformis_ was first formally described in 1978 by Ian Brooker and Donald Blaxell from a specimen collected by Blaxell near the Hyden - Norseman Road, east of Hyden. The description was published in the journal Nuytsia.[6][7] The specific epithet (_cerasiformis_) is derived from the Latin words _cerasus_ meaning "cherry-tree"[8] and _-formis_ meaning "shape",[9] referring to the hanging flower buds resembling a bunch of cherries.[10]


Distribution and habitat

Cherry-fruited mallee is only known from the type location, just north of Lake Johnston where it grows in low, open forest in red-loamy soils.[11][12][13]


Conservation status

This eucalypt is classified as "Priority Four" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife,[14] meaning that is rare or near threatened.[15]
