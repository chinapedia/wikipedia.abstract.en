Allene.png, the simplest allene, is also known as allene]] An ALLENE is a compound in which one carbon atom has double bonds with each of its two adjacent carbon centres.[1] Allenes are classified as polyenes with cumulated dienes. The parent compound of this class is propadiene, which is itself also called _allene_. Compounds with an allene-type structure but with more than three carbon atoms are called cumulenes. Allenes are much more reactive than most other alkenes. For example, their reactivity with gaseous chlorine is more like the reactivity of alkynes than that of alkenes.


Structure and bonding

Geometry

Allene3D.png The central carbon atom of allene forms two sigma bonds and two pi bonds. The central carbon is sp-hybridized, and the two terminal carbon atoms are sp²-hybridized. The bond angle formed by the three carbon atoms is 180°, indicating linear geometry for the carbon atoms of allene. It can also be viewed as an "extended tetrahedral" with a similar shape to methane.

Symmetry

Allene_symmetry.png The symmetry and isomerism of allenes has long fascinated organic chemists.[2] For allenes with four identical substituents, there exist two twofold axes of rotation through the center carbon, inclined at 45° to the CH₂ planes at either end of the molecule. The molecule can thus be thought of as a two-bladed propeller. A third twofold axis of rotation passes through the C=C=C bonds, and there is a mirror plane passing through both CH₂ planes. Thus this class of molecules belong to the D_(2d) point group. Because of the symmetry, an unsubstituted allene has no net dipole moment. An allene with two different substituents on each of the two carbon atoms will be chiral because there will no longer be any mirror planes. Where A has a greater priority than B according to the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules, the configuration of the axial chirality can be determined by considering the substituents on the front atom followed by the back atom when viewed along the allene axis. For the bottom, only the group of higher priority need be considered. Chiral allenes have been recently used as building blocks in the construction of organic materials with exceptional chiroptical properties.[3]


Synthesis

Although allenes often require specialized syntheses, the parent, propadiene is produced on a large scale as an equilibrium mixture with methylacetylene:

    H₂C=C=CH₂ CH₃C≡CH

This mixture, known as MAPP gas, is commercially available.

Laboratory methods for the formation of allenes include:

-   from geminal dihalocyclopropanes and organolithium compounds (or metallic sodium or magnesium) in the Skattebøl rearrangement (Doering–LaFlamme allene synthesis) via rearrangement of cyclopropylidene carbenes/carbenoids
-   from reaction of certain terminal alkynes with formaldehyde, copper(I) bromide, and added base (Crabbé–Ma allene synthesis)[4] [5]
-   from dehydrohalogenation of certain dihalides[6]
-   from reaction of a triphenylphosphinyl ester with an acid halide, a Wittig reaction accompanied by dehydrohalogenation[7][8]
-   from propargylic alcohols via the Myers allene synthesis protocol—a stereospecific process


As a ligand and substrate in homogeneous catalysis

Allenes function as ligands, not unlike alkenes. A typical complex is Pt(η²-allene)(PPh₃)₂. Ni(0) reagents catalyze the cyclooligomerization of allene.[9] Using a suitable catalyst (e.g. Wilkinson's catalyst), it is possible to reduce just one of the double bonds of an allene.[10]


Delta convention

Many rings or ring systems are known by semisystematic names that assume a maximum number of noncumulative bonds. To unambiguously specify derivatives that include cumulated bonds (and hence fewer hydrogens than would be expected from the skeleton), a lowercase delta may be used with a subscript indicating the number of cumulated double bonds from that atom, e.g. 8δ²-Benzocyclononene. This may be combined with the λ-convention for specifying nonstandard valency states, e.g. 2λ⁴δ²,5λ⁴δ²-Thieno[3,4-c]thiophene.[11]
