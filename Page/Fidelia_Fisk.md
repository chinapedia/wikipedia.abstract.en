In 1858 she returned to the United States with broken health. Her uncle Pliny Fisk was also a noted missionary.

She was the first principal of a seminary at Urumiah. She published _Memorial of Mount Holyoke Seminary_ and _Woman and her Saviour in Persia_, and at the time of her death was engaged in writing _Recollections of Mary Lyon_ (Boston, 1866).
