AWUAH PANIN III, known in the United States as Harry Danso, is an Ashanti nana from the Asokwa area, which includes his hometown of Koforidua.[1] He lives in Worcester, Massachusetts, but visits his native Ghana several times a year.[2]


Nana

He immigrated to the United States in 1985 and as of 2016 was a middle manager at an endoscopy company.[3] When he left Ghana there were several other men ahead of him in line for the throne, but the title eventually fell upon him.[4] He accepted it, but discourages his Ghanaian co-workers from using the title _nana_ in the workplace.[5]


Personal life

Panin is involved with the New Juaben Association of New England, which sends X-ray machines, gloves, and syringes to a cash-strapped hospital in Ghana.[6] He was named to Worcesterâ€™s Human Rights Commission in 2011.[7][8] He has a college degree, is married, and has children.[9]
