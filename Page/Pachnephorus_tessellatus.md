_PACHNEPHORUS TESSELLATUS_ is a species of leaf beetle in the subfamily Eumolpinae. It is widely distributed across Europe and Asia, and is also present on the Canary Islands.[1][2] It was first described by Caspar Erasmus Duftschmid in 1825.

_Myochrous albovillosus_, a synonym of _P. tessellatus_, was described from "Mexico" by Martin Jacoby in 1882. However, Doris Holmes Blake, who determined the two species to be the same, thought this reported locality to be due to a mistake in locality labels.[3]
