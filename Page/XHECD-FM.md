History

XECD was the second radio station in Puebla. It came to air on May 5, 1940, broadcasting for the first six months on 1340 kHz. Ricardo Vázquez held the concession for the 350-watt station; in 1946, it was bought by Roberto Cañedo, and five years later, Oscar Frese Márquez became the concessionaire.

In 1954, Joaquín Grajales Corral acquired XECD, building the station up during a time when radio expanded in Mexico; Radio Puebla, S.A. was created as the concessionaire in 1969. XECD ultimately became the flagship station of Grupo Oro, which is still owned by the Grajales family.

XECD moved to 92.9 MHz FM in early 2018. At that time, it adopted a romantic music format known as La Romántica.
