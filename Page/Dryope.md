In Greek mythology, DRYOPE (; Ancient Greek: Δρυόπη derived from δρῦς _drys_, "oak"; _dryope_ "woodpecker"[1]) is the name attributed to several distinct figures:

-   Dryope, daughter of Dryops and mother of Amphissus by Apollo.
-   Dryope, mother of Tarquitus by Faunus, the god of the woods. Tarquitus was slain by Aeneas.[2]
-   Dryope, a nymph responsible for kidnapping Hylas, which she did in accord with Hera's will.[3] Her name may have to do with the fact that Hylas was the son of Theiodamas, the king of the Dryopes.
-   Dryope, a Theban woman of Phoenician origin, mother of Chromis. She joined the Maenads disregarding her pregnancy, and went into labor when she was dragging a sacrificial bull by the horns.[4]
-   Dryope, a Lemnian.[5]
