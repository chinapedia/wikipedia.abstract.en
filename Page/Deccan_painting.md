The style developed under the patronage of Deccan sultanates—( namely, Bijapur, Golkonda, Ahmadnagar, Bidar, and Berar ) and lasted until the extinction of the Qutb Shahi dynasty in 1687 CE.[1][2][3]

The miniature painting style, which flourished initially in the Bahmani court of Bahmani Sultanate and later in the courts of Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, Bidar, Berar and Golkonda is popularly known as the Deccan school of Painting.

One of the earliest surviving paintings are found as the illustrations of a manuscript _Tarif-i-Hussain Shahi_ (1565 CE), which is now in Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal, Pune. About 400 miniature paintings are found in the manuscript of Nujum-ul-Ulum (Stars of Science) (1570 CE), kept in Chester Beatty Library, Dublin.[5]


Style

The style of Deccani painting flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries, Passing through multiple phases of sudden maturation and prolonged stagnation, later in the 18th and 19th centuries after the Mughal conquest of Deccan the style gradually withered away and new form of Hyderabad style painting evolved in the Deccan region particularly in the Nizam territory. Most of the colouring of Deccani paintings are Islamic Turkish and Persian tradition specially the arabesques, but those are surmounted by a pure Deccani piece of foliage.
