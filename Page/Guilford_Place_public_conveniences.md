The GUILFORD PLACE PUBLIC CONVENIENCES are Grade II listed former public toilets at Guilford Place, central London, built in the late 19th century.[1]

The toilets have "yellow tiles, mahogany doors, decorative grills and their original fittings."[2]

These underground toilets, then the busiest in the borough, were closed by Camden Council in the 1988, and as of February 2016, are due to be converted into a Tonkotsu Ramen noodle restaurant.[3][4][5]
