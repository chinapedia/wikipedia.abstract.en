CANNABIS IN NEPAL has been illegal since 1973, but the region has a long history of use of cannabis as an intoxicant, and continues to produce cannabis illicitly.


History

Hashish-shop-Kathmandu-1973.jpg Nepal has used psychoactive cannabis for centuries, and as early as the 1700s Nepalese _charas_ was recognized as the best available.[1]

In the early 1800s, commentator Francis Buchanan-Hamilton noted:

The Hippie Trail

In the 1960s, the Hippie Trail began to route young Western adventurers through Nepal. The stable traditional cannabis economy was rocked by the influx of demand, and the heavy usage by visitors normalized and made trendy cannabis consumption locally. The increased demand and linkage to outside markets led to an increase in hashish production, and smuggling routes established through India and out to the wider world.[2]

Prohibition

In 1973, Nepal canceled the licenses of all cannabis shops, dealers, and farmers, under pressure from the United States and the international community. However, personal cultivation and use were unaffected, and cannabis commerce continued illicitly. The loss of $100,000 in government revenues caused disruption, and later in the 1970s attempts were made at crop substitution.[3]

Marijuana is an illegal drug in many parts of the world including Nepal. However, there are no strict charges for smoking marijuana in some countries like, Spain, Czech Republic, Portugal, and itâ€™s even legalized in some states of the USA including Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington.

Today, it is only legal to smoke hashish during Maha Shivaratri.[4]


Food

In Nepal, cannabis seeds are also used in making pickles "bhang ko achar". The dried seeds are ground and then mixed with aalo (potato). This is common in hilly area like Kathmandu, Pokhara of Nepal.
