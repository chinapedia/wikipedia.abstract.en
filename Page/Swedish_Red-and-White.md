The SWEDISH RED-AND-WHITE, , frequently abbreviated to SRB, is a Swedish breed of dairy cattle. It was created in the 1920s by fusion of the Swedish Red Pied and Swedish Ayrshire breeds.


History

The Swedish Red-and-White breed was formed in 1927 or 1928 by merging the populations of the Swedish Red Pied (, often abbreviated to RSB) and Swedish Ayrshire breeds. The traditional Herrg책rd, Sk책ne and Sm책land breeds had already been merged into the Swedish Red Pied at some time between 1892 and 1928. All four of these constituent breeds are now reported to DAD-IS as extinct.

The Swedish Red-and-White is one the two principal dairy breeds of Sweden, and in 2001 constituted almost 48% of the national dairy herd, just barely outnumbering the Svensk L책glandsboskap or Swedish Friesian breed. In 2014 the total population was reported at just under 354 000.
