Production

Selvaraghavan announced that he has signed on comedian-turned-actor Santhanam for a film.[2] The production was announced on 15 July 2016, by an official tweet made by Santhanam and this film is said to be a romantic story on the lines of _Yaaradi Nee Mohini_ and _7G Rainbow Colony_.[3][4]

The shoot kick started on 4 December 2016 with a ‘pooja’. It is confirmed that this film has apparently been titled as _Mannavan Vanthanadi_, from the popular song which goes by the same name in Sivaji’s _Thiruvarutchelvar_ film.[5]
