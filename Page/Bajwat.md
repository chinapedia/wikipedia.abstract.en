BAJWAT (Punjabi, ) is located in the Sialkot district (32°62 N and 74°60 E) and Narowal district of Punjab province in Pakistan. It comprises 84 villages, with a population of 110,000 according to 2018 Servoy.

The area is a wetland of international importance due to the presence of Marala Headworks, Munawar Tawi, Jammu Tawi, and many nullahs, ponds and marshy areas. This habitat attracts a large number of waterfowl and other birds, as well as migratory species. Marala Headworks, built in 1965-68, is located in Bajwat's south-west corner. Two canals, Upper Chenab and the Marala-Ravi link canal, flow from Marala Headworks. These canals also provide habitats for the avian fauna of the area. Perceiving the importance of Bajwat, the Wildlife Department of Punjab (Pakistan) declared the area a “game reserve.” The area is sub-mountainous and 800 feet above the sea level. The soil is loamy and non-calcareous with sandy and clay components predominating. Average rainfall is 965 mm.
