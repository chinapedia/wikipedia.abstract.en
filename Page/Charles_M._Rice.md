Education and career

Rice graduated with a BS in zoology from University of California, Davis in 1974. In 1981, he received his PhD in biochemistry from the California Institute of Technology, where he studied RNA viruses in the lab of James Strauss. He remained at Caltech for four years to do postdoctoral research.[3][4] After his postdoctoral work, Rice moved to the Washington University School of Medicine as an assistant professor in 1986, where he remained until 2001, eventually rising to the rank of professor.

Rice has been the Maurice R. and Corinne P. Greenberg Professor at Rockefeller University since 2001. He is also an adjunct professor at Washington University School of Medicine and Cornell University. He has served on committees for the Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, and World Health Organization.[5]

He was the editor of _Journal of Experimental Medicine_ from 2003 to 2007, Journal of Virology from 2003 to 2008, and PLoS Pathogens from 2005 to present. He has been an author of over 400 peer-reviewed publications.[6]


Research

While at Caltech, he was involved in researching the genome of the Sindbis virus and the establishment of flaviviruses are their own family of viruses. The strain of yellow fever virus he used for this work was eventually used for the development of the yellow fever vaccine. This led him to his work in the related hepatitis C virus for which he has won many awards.[7]
