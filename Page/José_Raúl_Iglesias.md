Biography

Born in Boedo, city of Buenos Aires, Iglesias grew up imitating his idol, Luis Artime, a notable forward of the 1960s. He spent his youth career at San Lorenzo de Almagro, debuting in Primera División at 18, in 1976 in a match v. Unión de Santa Fe. Iglesias scored his first goal in Primera that same day, by penalty shoot-out. Alberto Rendo was the coach of San Lorenzo by then.

Iglesias would be later transferred to Sarmiento de Junín, where he became top scorer of the team that won the 1980 Primera B championship.[3]

Iglesias had a long career as scorer, becoming an idol for the Sarmiento de Junín and Racing Club de Avellaneda supporters.[4]

Despite of not having a technique or ball control, Iglesias was a temible striker because of his speed and heading, being mostly notable for his conditions as scorer.

Iglesias was the Primera B Nacional top scorer at the 1986-87 season playing for Huracán (which also promoted to Primera División) where he scored 36 goals in 37 matches, setting a record for the division.[5] After his tenure on _El Globito_, Iglesias was traded to Racing Club, where he became an idol for its supporters who also dedicated him a song.[6] Iglesias formed a praised attacking line along with wingers Ramón Medina Bello and Walter Fernández, with the addition of midfielder Miguel Colombatti and Uruguayan playmaker Rubén Paz. His most remembered match playing for Racing was a smashing victory over Boca Juniors by 6–0, with two goals by Iglesias.[7]

Like Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Iglesias' trademark was to perform a celebratory somersault after each goal he scored.[8]

In Primera División Iglesias scored 117 goals in 288 matches. Iglesias is the top-scorer of the 1980s in Argentine football, having scored 105 goals in 144 matches.[9] Nevertheless, he was never called up for the Argentina national team.
