_HOMO HABILIS_ is a proposed archaic species of _Homo_, which lived between roughly 2.1 and 1.5 million years ago, during the Gelasian and early Calabrian stages of the Pleistocene geological epoch.[1]

The type specimen is OH 7, discovered in 1960 at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, associated with the Oldowan lithic industry; the fossils were identified as a separate species of _Homo_ with the proposed binomial name of _H. habilis_ ("handy man") in 1964.[2] In its appearance and morphology, _H. habilis_ is intermediate between _Australopithecus_ and the somewhat younger _Homo erectus_ and its classification in the genus _Homo_ has been the subject of controversial debate since its original proposal.[3] A main argument for its classification as the first _Homo_ ("human") species was its use of flaked stone tools. However, evidence for earlier tool use (3.39 million years ago) by undisputed members of _Australopithecus_ has been found in the 1990s.[4][5]


Classification as _Homo_

MEH_Homo_habilis_Daynes.jpg (2010), based on the KNM-ER 1813 cranium.]] There has been scholarly debate regarding its placement in the genus _Homo_ rather than the genus _Australopithecus_.[6][7] The small size and rather primitive attributes have led some experts (Richard Leakey among them) to propose excluding _H. habilis_ from the genus _Homo_ and placing them instead in _Australopithecus_ as _Australopithecus habilis_.[8]

Louis Leakey (father of Richard Leakey), the British-Kenyan paleoanthropologist who was the first to suggest the existence of _H. habilis_, and his wife, Mary Leakey, found the first trace of _H. habilis_ in 1955: two hominin teeth. These were later classified as "milk teeth", and therefore considered difficult to link to taxa, unlike permanent teeth.

_H. habilis_ was short and had disproportionately long arms compared to modern humans; however, it had a less protruding face than the australopithecines from which it is thought to have descended. _H. habilis_ had a cranial capacity slightly less than half of the size of modern humans. Despite the ape-like morphology of the bodies, _H. habilis_ remains are often accompanied by primitive stone tools (e.g. Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania and Lake Turkana, Kenya).

_Homo habilis_ has often been thought to be the ancestor of the more gracile and sophisticated _Homo ergaster_, which in turn gave rise to the more human-appearing species, _Homo erectus_. Debates continue over whether all of the known fossils are properly attributed to the species, and some paleoanthropologists regard the taxon as invalid, made up of fossil specimens of _Australopithecus_ and _Homo_.[9] New findings in 2007 seemed to confirm the view that _H. habilis_ and _H. erectus_ coexisted, representing separate lineages from a common ancestor instead of _H. erectus_ being descended from _H. habilis_.[10] An alternative explanation would be that any ancestral relationship from _H. habilis_ to _H. erectus_ would have to have been cladogenetic rather than anagenetic (meaning that if an isolated subgroup population of _H. habilis_ became the ancestor of _H. erectus_, other subgroups remained as unchanged _H. habilis_ until their much later extinction).[11]

Discoveries at Dmanisi, Georgia, which had diverse physical traits and differences in tooth wear, suggest to some scholars that all the contemporary groups of early _Homo_ in Africa, including _Homo ergaster_, _Homo habilis_, and _Homo rudolfensis_ are of the same species and should be assigned to _Homo erectus_, with the implication that variation between these "species" represents the prolonged evolution of one lineage, rather than interspecific differences.[12][13][14][15]


Morphology

_H. habilis_ brain size has been shown to range from to , rather than from to as previously thought.[16][17]

A virtual reconstruction published in 2015 estimated the endocranial volume at between and , larger than any previously published value.[18]

_H. habilis_' brain capacity of around was on average 50% larger than australopithecines, but considerably smaller than the to range of modern _Homo sapiens_. These hominins were smaller than modern humans, on average standing no more than .

The body proportions for _H. habilis_ are in accordance with craniodental evidence, suggesting closer association with _H. erectus_.[19]

A 2018 study of the anatomy of _Australopithecus sediba_ found that _A. sediba_ is distinct from but closely related to both _Homo habilis_ and _Australopithecus africanus_.[20]

Diet

Based on dental microwear-texture analysis, _Homo habilis_ (as well as other early _Homo_-class hominins) likely did not specialize on particularly tough foods. Microwear-texture complexity is, on average, somewhere between that of tough-food feeders and leaf feeders (folivores.)[21] These measurements are analyses of the percentages of tooth surface structure containing "pits" (frequency and depth of dental damage resulting from consumption of certain foods across species). It is a heavily used, and henceforth widely accepted as reliable, measure of wear that a species, on average, endures from eating certain food. These measurements point to an increasingly generalized, and generally omnivorous diet in _Homo habilis_.[22]


Behaviour

Homo_habilis.JPG _Homo habilis_ is thought to have mastered the Lower Paleolithic Olduwan tool set, which used stone flakes. _H. habilis_ used these stones to butcher and skin animals.[23] These stone flakes were more advanced than any tools previously used, and gave _H. habilis_ the edge it needed to prosper in hostile environments previously too formidable for primates. Whether _H. habilis_ was the first hominin to master stone tool technology remains controversial, as _Australopithecus garhi_, dated to 2.6 million years ago, has been found along with stone tool implements.

Most experts assume the intelligence and social organization of _H. habilis_ were more sophisticated than typical australopithecines or chimpanzees. _H. habilis_ used tools primarily for scavenging, such as cleaving meat off carrion, rather than defense or hunting. Yet, despite tool usage, _H. habilis_ was not the master hunter its sister species (or descendants) proved to be, as ample fossil evidence indicates _H. habilis_ was a staple in the diet of large predatory animals, such as _Dinofelis_, a large scimitar-toothed predatory cat the size of a jaguar.[24]

_Homo habilis_ coexisted with other _Homo_-like bipedal primates, such as _Paranthropus boisei_, some of which prospered for many millennia. However, _H. habilis_, possibly because of its early tool innovation and a less specialized diet, became the precursor of an entire line of new species, whereas _Paranthropus boisei_ and its robust relatives disappeared from the fossil record. _H. habilis_ may also have coexisted with _H. erectus_ in Africa for a period of 500,000 years.[25]


Fossils

OH 7

Homme_d'Olduvai.jpg, Brussels, 2016 photograph)]] OH 7 dates to 1.75 million years old, and was discovered by Mary and Louis Leakey on 4 November 1960 at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. It is a lower jaw complete with teeth; due to the size of the small teeth, researchers estimate this juvenile individual had a brain volume of 363 cm³. In 1964, found were more than 20 fragments of the left hand. Leakey, paleontologist John Napier, and paleoanthropologist Phillip Tobias identified these discoveries as Homo habilis and assisted in classifying OH 7 as the type fossil.[26]

The OH 7 hand of _Homo habilis_ combines traits associated with a precision grip and adaptations related to climbing, which fits well with the semi-long, humanlike hindlimb proportions and a rather chimpanzee-like upper-to-lower arm ratio.

OH 24

OH 24 (_Twiggy_) is a roughly deformed cranium about 1.8 million years old discovered in October 1968 at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. The brain volume is just under 600 cm³; also, a reduction in the protruding face is present compared to members of more primitive australopithecines.

KNM-ER 1813

KNM-ER 1813 is a relatively complete cranium, which dates to 1.9 million years old, discovered at Koobi Fora, Kenya by Kamoya Kimeu in 1973. The brain capacity is 510 cm³, not as impressive as other early specimen and forms of _H. habilis_ discovered.

KNM-ER 1805

KNM-ER 1805 is a specimen of an adult _H. habilis_ made of three pieces of cranium dating to 1.74 million years old from Koobi Fora, Kenya, discovered in 1974. Previous assumptions were that this specimen belongs to _H. erectus_ based on the degree of prognathism and overall cranial shape.

OH 62

One set of fossil remains (OH 62, for "Olduvai Hominid specimen 62"), discovered by Donald Johanson and Tim White in Olduvai Gorge in 1986, included the important upper and lower limbs, specifically the humerus and femur.[27] Their finding stimulated some debate at the time.[28] Locomotor affinities of OH 62 have been assessed primarily on the basis of its forelimb to hind limb proportions, which are known to be associated with locomotor behavior among living primates. Initial analyses concentrated on comparisons to the _Australopithecus afarensis_ A.L. 288-1 ("Lucy"). In most dimensions—measured or estimated—the OH 62 upper limb remains equaled or exceeded those of A.L. 288-1, while its lower limb remains (principally the femur) appeared to be smaller. In particular, using a length estimate for the humerus of 264 mm, and a length estimate for the less complete femur of "no greater than that of A.L. 288-1 (280 mm)," a possible humerofemoral length index is close to 95%, which is more like that of modern chimpanzees (averaging about 1.00) than modern humans (averaging about 0.72). In this sense, it was more "primitive" than A.L. 288-1, with a length index of 0.85.[29] Homo_habilis-KNM_ER_1813.jpg.]]

LD 350-1

LD 350-1 is a fossil jawbone fragment discovered in 2013, which has been dated to 2.8 million years ago and argued to be intermediate between _Australopithecus_ and _H. habilis_.[30] The fossil was claimed as the earliest evidence of the genus _Homo_ known to date. The individual in question lived just after a major climate shift in the region, when forests and waterways were rapidly replaced by arid savannah.[31]
