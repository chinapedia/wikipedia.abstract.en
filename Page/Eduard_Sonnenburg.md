EDUARD SONNENBURG (3 November 1848, in Bremen – 25 May 1915, in Bad Wildungen) was a German surgeon. He was a son-in-law to neurologist Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal.

After receiving his medical doctorate in 1872, he spent several years as an assistant to Georg Albert Lücke at the surgical clinic in Strassburg. In 1876 he qualified as a lecturer of surgery at the university. In 1880 he relocated to Berlin, where he worked under Bernhard von Langenbeck and Ernst von Bergmann.[1]

In 1883 he became an associate professor at the University of Berlin, and in 1890 was appointed director of the surgical department at the Krankenhaus Moabit. In 1913 he became an honorary full professor at the university.[2]

In 1886, he was a founding member of the _Freie Vereinigung der Chirurgen Berlins_ (Free Association of Berlin Surgeons), an organization known today as the _Berliner Chirurgische Gesellschaft_.[3] His name is associated with "Sonnenberg's sign", an indicator defined as bloody leukocytosis seen in appendicitis with localized peritonitis.
