Burma_Railway_memorial_Camden_High_Street_04.jpg The BURMA RAILWAY MEMORIAL is a memorial in Camden High Street, London, to British civilian and military personnel who died in the Far East during the Second World War building the Burma Railway. The memorial was opened in September 2012 by Viscount John Slim following a campaign in the _Camden New Journal_. It was designed by the architect Chris Roche and features a plaque with an image of an emaciated prisoner of war drawn by the artist Ronald Searle who was himself forced to work on the railway.[1][2][3][4][5]
