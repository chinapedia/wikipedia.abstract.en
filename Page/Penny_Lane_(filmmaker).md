Features

_Our Nixon_

Brian Frye introduced Lane to the Super 8 home movies confiscated by the FBI during the Watergate investigation.[11] The archival footage inspiring Lane and Frye became the basis of the 2013 released nonfiction film _Our Nixon_.

The documentary depicts a unique portrait of Richard Nixon and his closest aides, chief of staff H.R. Haldeman, domestic affairs adviser John Ehrlichman, and special assistant Dwight Chapin. The film contains footage from 26 hours of Super 8 home movies filmed by Haldeman, Enrlichman, and Chapin, as well as relevant news broadcasts and interviews.[12] Among numerous films about the Nixon and Watergate era, _Our Nixon_ stands out for its distinct, intimate perspective and the stylized all archival editing choice.

_Our Nixon_ had its world premiere at the 42nd International Film Festival in Rotterdam and its North American premiere at 2013 South by Southwest.[13] The film screened at multiple film festivals, including Ann Arbor Film Festival, where it won the Ken Burns Award for “Best of the Festival,”[14] and Seattle International Film Festival, where it won the Best Documentary Award.[15] _Our Nixon_ was selected as the Closing Night Film at 42nd New Directors/New Films.[16] On August 1, 2013, CNN broadcast the film, and Cinedigm handled the film’s theatrical release.[17]

_The Wall Street Journal_ wrote that the "highly personal view of the Nixon years is, for obvious reasons, a sad and wrenching one - a film that is nonetheless filled with spirit, humor and a bountiful sense of irony.”[18] Amy Entelis, senior vice president for development for CNN worldwide, praised the film for its “original material” and “unconventional” story telling.[19]

_Nuts!_

After encountering _Charlatan_, an authorized biography written by Pope Brock, in her local public library in 2009, Lane developed an interest in John Romulus Brinkley, a doctor who attempted to cure impotence via goat testicle transplantation in 1917.[20][21] The experimental documentary _Nuts!_ mainly consists of animated reenactments and narration voiced by both actors and Brinkley himself.[22] “Brinkley’s story is not presented as the object of a neutral nonfiction gaze, but opportunity for viewers to actively wrestle with the ethical and epistemological issues central to the narrative nonfiction form,” Lane wrote in the home page of _Nuts!_.

_Nuts!_ premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 22, 2016, and won the Special Jury Award for Editing in U.S. Documentary Competition of the festival. The documentary is announced to be released theatrically beginning on June 22, 2016, at the Film Forum in New York City.[23]

_Rolling Stone_ named _Nuts!_ one of the 12 best movies they saw at Sundance 2016, saying “the fact that it’s all true didn’t stop Lane’s film from ending with the best twist of this year’s fest.”[24]

_Hail Satan?_

An examination of the origins of The Satanic Temple and their brand of grassroots activism.[25] The documentary premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival[26] and will be distributed by Magnolia Pictures.[27] Lane described the editing for the film occurred in approximately six months, "concurrent with the bulk of shooting."[28]
