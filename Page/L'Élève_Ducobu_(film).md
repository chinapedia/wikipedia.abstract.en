Plot

Ducobu (Vincent Claude) is a lazy student who is fond of cheating. After being dismissed from one school, he is sent to Saint-Potache Primary School; if he does not perform well there, his parents will send him to boarding school. Ducobu concocts innovative methods of cheating in order to get by, much to the frustration of his teacher, Mr Latouche (Élie Semoun), who tries to catch Ducobu. Ducobu regularly attempts to copy the work of Léonie (Juliette Chappey), the top student in the class. Nevertheless, Ducobu and Léonie eventually become friends.
