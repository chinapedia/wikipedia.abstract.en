_L'ORESTIE D'ESCHYLE_ is a French-language opera by Darius Milhaud based on _The Oresteia_ triptych by Aeschylus in a French translation by his collaborator Paul Claudel.

Milhaud set a scene of the first play, _Agamemnon_, for soprano and chorus in 1913. The second part, _Les Choéphores_, The Libation Bearers dates from 1922. The very extensive third part, _Les Euménides_ The Furies, was completed in 1923.[1] The opera was partially performed in March 1931, but not performed complete till 1963 in Berlin.[2]
