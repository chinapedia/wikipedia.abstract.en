_THE MAN WHO KNEW: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ALAN GREENSPAN_ is a biography of the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, written by Council on Foreign Relations Senior Fellow Sebastian Mallaby.[1] It was published in October 2016 by Penguin Press.

In the book, Mallaby addresses questions about Greenspan that emerged in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. "Mr. Greenspan is a fascinating subject because for so long he was considered a genius, only to later be blamed for the financial crisis," wrote Andrew Ross Sorkin, reviewing the book in the _New York Times_. "Mr. Mallaby does an exquisite job going beyond these two versions of the Greenspan narrative and taking the reader inside the complicated mind of a man who may have had one of the largest ever influences over our economy."[2]

_The Man Who Knew_ won the 2016 Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award,[3] was named a New York Times Notable Book of 2016,[4] a _Foreign Affairs_ Best Book of 2016,[5] and an _Economist_ Book of the Year.[6]
