is manga aimed at a young teen male target-demographic. The age group varies with individual readers and different magazines, but it is primarily intended for boys between the ages of 12 to 18. The kanji characters (少年) literally mean "boy" (or "youth"), and the characters (漫画) means "comic". Thus, the complete phrase means "young person's comic", or simply "boys' comic"; its female equivalent is shōjo manga. Shōnen manga is the most popular form of manga.[1][2]


Summary

Shōnen manga is typically characterized by high-action,[3] often humorous plots featuring male protagonists. Commonly-found themes in shōnen manga include martial arts, robots, science fiction, sports, horror or mythological creatures.[4] The camaraderie between boys or men on sports teams, fighting squads, and the like are often emphasized. Protagonists of such manga often feature an ongoing desire to better themselves.[5], and often face challenges to their abilities, skills and maturity, where self-perfection, austere self-discipline, sacrifice in the cause of duty and honorable service to society, community, family and friends are stressed.[6][7]

None of these listed characteristics are a requirement, as seen in shōnen manga like _Yotsuba&!_, which features a female lead and almost no fan service or action; what defines whether or not a series is shōnen is the official classification of the magazine it is serialized in.[8]

The art style of shōnen is generally less "flowery" than that of shōjo manga, although this varies greatly from artist to artist, and some artists draw both shōnen and shōjo manga.

Shōnen manga today

Akira Toriyama's _Dragon Ball_ (1984–1995) is credited with setting the trend of popular shōnen manga from the 1980s onward, with manga critic Jason Thompson in 2011 calling it "by far the most influential shōnen manga of the last 30 years."[9] Many currently successful shōnen authors such as Eiichiro Oda, Masashi Kishimoto, Tite Kubo, Hiro Mashima and Kentaro Yabuki cite him and _Dragon Ball_ as an influence on their own now popular works.

After the arrest and trial of serial killer Tsutomu Miyazaki, depictions of violence and sexual matters became more highly regulated in manga in general, but especially in shōnen manga.[10]


History

Before World War II

Manga has been said to have existed since the eighteenth century,[11][12] but originally did not target a specific gender or age group. By 1905, however, a boom in publishing manga magazines occurred, and began targeting genders as evidenced by their names, such as _Shōnen Sekai_, _Shōjo Sekai_, and _Shōnen Pakku_ (a kodomo manga magazine).[13] _Shōnen Sekai_ was one of the first shōnen manga magazines, and was published from 1895 to 1914.

Post-Occupation

The post-World War II occupation of Japan had a profound impact on its culture during the 1950s and beyond (see culture of Post-occupation Japan), including on manga. Modern manga developed during this period, including the modern format of shōnen manga we experience today, of which boys and young men were among the earliest readers.[14] During this time, Shōnen manga focused on topics thought to interest the archetypical boy: sci-tech subjects like robots and space travel, and heroic action-adventure.[15] Osamu Tezuka, creator of _Astro Boy_ is said to have played an influential role in manga during this period.[16][17][18] Between 1950 and 1969, an increasingly large readership for manga emerged in Japan with the solidification of its two main marketing genres, shōnen manga aimed at boys and shōjo manga aimed at girls.[19]

The magazine _Weekly Shōnen Jump_ began production in 1968,[20] and continues to be produced today as the best-selling manga magazine in Japan.[21] Many of the most popular shōnen manga titles have been serialized in _Jump_, including _Dragon Ball_, _Captain Tsubasa_, _Slam Dunk_, _One Piece_, _Naruto_, _Bleach_, and others.

With the relaxation of censorship in Japan in the 1990s, a wide variety of explicit sexual themes appeared in manga intended for male readers, and correspondingly occur in English translations.[22] However, in 2010 the Tokyo Metropolitan Government passed the controversial Bill 156 to restrict harmful content despite opposition by many authors and publishers in the manga industry.[23][24]


Women's roles in shōnen manga

In early shōnen manga, men and boys played all the major roles, with women and girls having only auxiliary places as sisters, mothers, and occasionally girlfriends. Of the nine cyborgs in Shotaro Ishinomori's 1964 _Cyborg 009_, only one is female, and she soon vanishes from the action. Some recent shōnen manga virtually omit women, e.g. the martial arts story _Baki the Grappler_ by Itagaki Keisuke, and the supernatural fantasy _Sand Land_ by Akira Toriyama. By the 1980s, however, girls and women began to play increasingly important roles in shōnen manga. For example, in Toriyama's 1980 _Dr. Slump_, the main character is the mischievous and powerful girl robot Arale Norimaki. Discussing his character Lisa Lisa from 1987's _Battle Tendency_, _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_ author Hirohiko Araki stated that at the time female characters in shōnen manga were typically cute and designed to be "a man's ideal woman." He said readers were not interested in realistic portrayals of women, but rather the type of girl "that giggles during a conversation" with heart marks next to her. He believes this made the warrior-type Lisa Lisa feel fresh and "unheard of" in both manga and society in general and said it was exciting to challenge people's expectations with her. Araki also said that the supernatural basis of the fights in his series evened the battlefield for women and children to match up against strong men.[25]

The role of girls and women in manga for male readers has evolved considerably since Arale. One class is the _bishōjo_ or "beautiful young girl."[26] Sometimes the woman is unattainable, and she is always an object of the hero's emotional and/or sexual interest, like Shao-lin from _Guardian Angel Getten_ by Minene Sakurano or Belldandy from the seinen manga _Oh My Goddess!_ by Kōsuke Fujishima.[27] In other stories, the hero is surrounded by such girls and women, as in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ by Ken Akamatsu and _Hanaukyo Maid Team_ by Morishige.[28] The male protagonist does not always succeed in forming a relationship with the woman, for example when Bright Honda and Aimi Komori fail to bond in _Shadow Lady_ by Masakazu Katsura. In other cases, a successful couple's sexual activities are depicted or implied, like in _Outlanders_ by Johji Manabe.[29] In still other cases, the initially naive and immature hero grows up to become a man by learning how to deal and live with women emotionally and sexually; examples of heroes who follow this path include Yota in _Video Girl Ai_ by Masakazu Katsura and Train Man in the seinen manga _Train Man: Densha Otoko_ by Hidenori Hara.[30][31]

However, since the 80s, there have been increase in female protagonists in shōnen manga, albeit lesser in number. They are often portrayed as central characters or characters with important roles in manga. Some examples include _Fullmetal Alchemist_,[32] ''Urusei Yatsura, _Inuyasha_, _Attack on Titan_, _Ranma ½_, _Fairy Tail_, _Gunslinger Girl_, _The Qwaser of Stigmata_, _WataMote_, _Nisekoi_, _Strawberry Marshmallow_ and _Soul Eater_.
