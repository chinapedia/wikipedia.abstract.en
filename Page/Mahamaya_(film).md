After they leave the Ashram of the teacher each marry a different person. Later, Vikram happens to meet Mahamaya. Reminding her that she has chosen him as her husband, he claims that she belongs to him. However, Mahamaya rejects his claim. Vikram abducts Mahamaya but she manage to escape from him.

Production

Elangovan took almost a year to complete the screenplay. He was not sure how to end the story. So, he wrote three endings and left the decision to the producers and the director. All three endings were filmed.


Sound Track

Music was composed by S. V. Venkataraman and Kunnakudi Venkatarama Iyer while the lyrics were penned by Kambadasan and T. K. Sundara Vaathiyar. Though there were 10 songs in the film only one ‘Silaye née ennidam' sung by P. U. Chinnappa was a hit.


Box office

Although the film was acclaimed by critics for good acting by Kannamba and Chinnappa, the people at that time did not accept the story because it shows a King going after another person's wife. Therefore, the film did not do well at the box office.
