History

Praia_Cityhall.jpg

Praia was founded as a small village near the natural harbour in the early 16th century. Due to its strategic position on a plateau it was easily defended against pirate attacks, which gave it a large advantage over the older city of Ribeira Grande (Cidade Velha). It gradually superseded Cidade Velha to become the most important settlement of Cape Verde, and became the seat of the colonial government in 1770. In the course of the 19th century, the _Plateau_ was completely redeveloped with streets according to a grid plan, lined with grand colonial buildings and mansions.[3][4] Since 2016, the historic centre of Praia is on the tentative list of World Heritage sites.[5]
