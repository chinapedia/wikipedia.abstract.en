ESTRIOL SULFATE GLUCURONIDE, or ESTRIOL 3-SULFATE 16Α-GLUCURONIDE, is an endogenous, naturally occurring diconjugated metabolite of estriol.[1] It is generated in the liver from estriol sulfate by UDP-glucuronyltransferase and is eventually excreted in the urine by the kidneys.[2] It occurs in high concentrations during pregnancy along with estriol sulfate and estriol glucuronide,[3] and was a component of the early pharmaceutical estrogens Progynon and Emmenin.[4][5][6][7]
