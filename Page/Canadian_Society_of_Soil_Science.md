The CANADIAN SOCIETY OF SOIL SCIENCE (CSSS) is a non-governmental, non-profit organization for scientists, engineers, technologists, administrators and students involved in professional soil science.[1][2] Its goal is to nurture the discipline of soil science in Canada and ensure its relevance in the future. It works to achieve this goal by:

-   promoting the wise use of soil for the benefit of all society,
-   promoting information and technology exchange among people in the professional soil science community,
-   fostering the integration of students into the professional soil science community,
-   providing a link between soil scientists in the private, public, and university sectors,
-   disseminating research and the practical application of findings in soil science,
-   representing the Canadian soil science community in international organizations and meetings, and
-   celebrating the accomplishments of Canadian soil scientists.


Society Administration

The Society is administered by a 9-member Council consisting of a President, President-Elect, Past-President, Secretary, Treasurer, two Councillors (Western and Eastern Councillor), Graduate Student Representative, and the Editor of the Canadian Journal of Soil Science. Council meets once annually, at the Annual Meeting, and conducts ongoing e-mail correspondence and business motions throughout the year. The Annual Meeting consists of both Scientific and Business Meetings, and concludes with an Awards Banquet.

Publications

The Canadian Journal of Soil Science

The Canadian Journal of Soil Science (CJSS), is a peer reviewed international journal[3] and contains approximately 70 papers and 800 pages annually. Published since 1957, the CJSS contains new research on the use, management, structure and development of soils and draws from the disciplines of soil science, agrometeorology, ecology, agricultural engineering, environmental science, hydrology, forestry, geology, geography, and climatology and covers agrometeorology; ecology, biological processes, and plant interactions; composition and chemical processes; physical processes, and interfaces; genesis, landscape processes, and relationships; contamination and environmental stewardship; and management for agricultural, forestry, and urban uses. The Journal also publishes reviews, letters to the editor, and occasionally conference proceedings. Special issues, or special sections within regular issues dealing with specific topics, are also considered.

CSSS Newsletter

The Newsletter, published 3 times a year, is an information bulletin containing Society and member news. It is an informal forum through which CSSS members can share ideas and information and keep in touch with one another.

Books

The Canadian Society of Soil Science has sponsored several books such as:

-   SOIL SAMPLING AND METHODS OF ANALYSIS, 2nd Edition edited by M.R. Carter and E.G. Gregorich (2008) and published by CRC Press and Taylor & Francis Group.[4]
-   SOIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE DICTIONARY edited by E.G. Gregorich, L.W. Turchenek, M.R. Carter, and D.A. Angers (2001) CRC Press.[5] Review of this book can be found at 15
-   SOIL SAMPLING AND METHODS OF ANALYSIS, 1st Edition edited by M.R. Carter (1993) and published by Lewis Publishers and CRC Press.[6]

Committees

-   _CSSS EDUCATION COMMITTEE_

The Committee, established in 2014,has the goal to enhance soil science education in Canada at both the post-secondary and K-12 level.[8] One of ongoing initiatives is focused on profiling undergraduate soil science education in Canada. In 2015-2016, the Committee created an inventory of soil science courses offered at Canadian universities and colleges [9] and explored the possibility and feasibility of developing cooperative agreements among universities to accept credit for soil science courses among cooperating institutions.

-   _CSSS PEDOLOGY COMMITTEE_

The Pedology Committee of the Canadian Society of Soil Science (CSSS) was established in 2005. The Committee has three mandates: (1) Improvement of the taxonomic classification system for Canadian soils through revision of the system because of new information, (2) Maintenance of contact with the international pedological community on new developments in soil genesis and classification, and (3) Compilation and dissemination of information about the genesis, distribution, classification and wise use of Canadian soils.
