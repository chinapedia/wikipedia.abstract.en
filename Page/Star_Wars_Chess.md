_STAR WARS CHESS_ is a 1993 chess-playing video game developed by The Software Toolworks, based on the _Star Wars_ film franchise and published by Mindscape for MS-DOS, Sega CD and Windows 3.x.


Plot

The story takes place sometime between the start and end of the Galactic Civil War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire. The two forces establish an uneasy truce and decide to settle this with a game of chess in order to determine who holds the future for the galaxy.


Gameplay

The game follows the classic rules of chess. The player can play either as the Rebel Forces or the Dark Side. The chess pieces are portrayed as characters which match the rank of the chess piece. For example Luke Skywalker is the white king, Darth Vader is the black queen and the Stormtroopers are black pawns. When one chess piece takes an opposing one, a brief battle scene shows the chess piece character defeating the opponent.


Reception

_Computer Gaming World_ concluded that _T2 Chess Wars_ and _Star Wars Chess_ "are examples of marketing at its best (or worst, depending on your point of view)".[1]

In 1996, _Computer Gaming World_ declared _Star Wars Chess_ the 49th-worst computer game ever released.[2]
