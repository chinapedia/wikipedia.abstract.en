4GR is an Australian commercial radio station located in Toowoomba, Queensland, currently broadcasting as Triple M on 864 AM.[1]

The station was the first commercial radio station to broadcast in Queensland.

4GR was the brainchild of Edward Gold[2] who had conducted test radio broadcasts in a shed from his experimental radio station 4EG prior to obtaining Queensland's first commercial radio licence to establish 4GR, which began broadcasting on 17 August 1925.[3]

In 2015, 4GR celebrated its 90th birthday.[4]

Despite the station identifying itself as its original callsign 4GR for more than 90 years, the on-air branding was changed to Triple M in December 2016 as part of Southern Cross Austereo's branding overhaul of its regional radio networks.[5]

4GR's name change came under fire from some quarters. An online reader's poll run by _The Chronicle_ newspaper in Toowoomba found that 74% of respondents were unhappy with 4GR taking on the Triple M brand.[6]
