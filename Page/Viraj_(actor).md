Early life

Viraj is the son of Tamil dubbing artiste and singer S. N. Surendar, the brother of vocalist Shoba Chandrasekhar. Actor Vijay is his first cousin, while his uncle S. A. Chandrasekhar is also a film director.


Career

Viraj made his first appearance as a child artiste in K. R. Jaya's family drama _Uyirile Kalanthathu_ (2000) portraying the younger version of the character portrayed by Raghuvaran, and used his original name of Hari Prashanth as his stage name.[3] Having previously trained as a singer under musician T. S. Raghavendra, Viraj's father's influence in the film industry helped him also work as a chorus singer for the song "Sundari" in A. R. Rahman's 2002 soundtrack for Mani Ratnam's _Kannathil Muthamittal_. He won critical acclaim for his portrayal of the younger version of Ambi in Shankar's _Anniyan_ (2005), where he appeared in scenes alongside Nedumudi Venu.[4] He later played the role of a young street cricketer who captains the 'Bad Boys' team in _Chennai 600028_ (2007) and reprised the role in its sequel _Chennai 600028 II_, released almost a decade later.[5]

In January 2014, Viraj announced his intentions of appearing as the lead actor and began working on a film titled _Mozhivathu Yathenil_ alongside Mahendran, but the film did not have a theatrical release.[6][7]
