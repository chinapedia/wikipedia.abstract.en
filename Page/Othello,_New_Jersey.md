History

There were three taverns in old Greenwich: One was the Old Stone Tavern, on Ye Greate Street, another on the wharf, and the third situated in the Ewing-Bacon House, a.k.a. Resurrection Hall, at the head of Greenwich, a.k.a. Othello.[4] Charles Ewing named the family homestead Resurrection Hall. The oldest part of the house was built by Thomas Ewing in the early 18th century.[5] Thomas Ewing, Jr (1722-1771) was a blacksmith and Presbyterian elder.[6]

Othello and nearby Springtown were stations on the Underground Railroad.[7]

While Othello only had a post office from 12 April 1897 until 15 November 1906, the community continues to appear on many maps.[8][9]
