BEACON PARK (PLYMOUTH) is the site of a former rugby union stadium on the north side of the Beacon Park Road in north Plymouth;[1] redeveloped into housing called Albion Drive.[2]


Rugby Union

When Devonport Albion merged with Plymouth RFC to become Plymouth Albion R.F.C. they moved into Beacon Park in 1920.


Greyhound racing

Greyhound racing started on the 5 May 1928 with racing over 525 yards behind a trackless hare. The greyhound racing was independent (unaffiliated to a governing body) and whippet racing was also prominent.[3] New management took over during September 1929 and racing sometimes took place twice on one day at 3pm & 5pm. Racing came to an end on 4 July 1931.[4]


Closure

Plymouth moved out in 2003 and the stadium was sold and redeveloped into housing called Albion Drive.[5]
