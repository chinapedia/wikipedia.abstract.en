BARRY JENKINS (born November 19, 1979) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. After making his filmmaking debut with the short film _My Josephine_, Jenkins garnered positive notices for the independent feature _Medicine for Melancholy_ (2008), receiving an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature among other award nominations.

Following an eight-year hiatus from filmmaking, Jenkins directed and co-wrote the LGBT-themed independent drama _Moonlight_ (2016) which gained critical acclaim and won numerous accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. Jenkins received an Academy Award nomination for Best Director and jointly won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay with Tarell Alvin McCraney.[1] He became the fourth black person to be nominated for Best Director and the second black person to direct a Best Picture winner. He released his third directorial feature _If Beale Street Could Talk_ in 2018 to critical praise, and earned nominations for his screenplay at the Academy Awards and Golden Globes, among others.


Early life

Jenkins was born in Liberty City, Miami, the youngest of four siblings. His father died when he was 12, and had earlier separated from his mother, believing that Jenkins was not his biological son. During his childhood, Jenkins was raised by another woman in an overcrowded apartment. He attended Miami Northwestern Senior High School, where he played on the school football team. Jenkins later earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in film from Florida State University in Tallahassee in 2003.[2]


Career

2000s–2010s: Early work

Jenkins debuted on the screen with his 2003 short _My Josephine_, but his first breakout film was _Medicine for Melancholy_, a low-budget independent feature released in 2008, starring Wyatt Cenac and Tracey Heggins.[3] The film was well received by critics.[4]

After the success of his previous film, Jenkins wrote an epic for Focus Features about "Stevie Wonder and time travel" and an adaptation of the James Baldwin novel _If Beale Street Could Talk_, neither of which initially entered production.[5][6] He later worked as a carpenter and co-founded an advertising company called Strike Anywhere. In 2011, he wrote and directed _Remigration_, a sci-fi short film about gentrification. Jenkins became a writer for HBO's _The Leftovers_, about which he commented, "I didn't get to do much."[7]

2016: _Moonlight_

Jenkins directed and co-wrote, with Tarell Alvin McCraney, the 2016 drama _Moonlight_, his first feature film in eight years.[8] The film was shot in Miami and premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in September 2016 to vast critical acclaim and awards buzz.[9][10] A. O. Scott of _The New York Times_ wrote: "_Moonlight_ dwells on the dignity, beauty and terrible vulnerability of black bodies, on the existential and physical matter of black lives."[11] _Variety_ wrote: "Barry Jenkins' vital portrait of a South Florida youth revisits the character at three stages in his life, offering rich insights into the contemporary African-American experience."[12] David Sims of _The Atlantic_ wrote: "Like all great films, _Moonlight_ is both specific and sweeping. It’s a story about identity—an intelligent, challenging work."[13]

The film won dozens of accolades, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture – Drama[14] and the Academy Award for Best Picture at the 89th Academy Awards.[15] Jenkins and McCraney also won Best Adapted Screenplay and overall, the film received eight Oscar nominations, including Best Director.[16]

2017–present: Further projects

In 2017, Jenkins directed the fifth episode of the Netflix original series _Dear White People_.[17]

In 2013, the same year he wrote _Moonlight,_ he wrote a film adaptation of James Baldwin's novel _If Beale Street Could Talk._ [18] Production began in October 2017 with Annapurna Pictures, Pastel, and Plan B.[19] The film was released in December 2018 to critical acclaim. It garnered numerous accolades and acclaim, including Best Supporting Actress wins for Regina King at the Academy Awards and Golden Globes. Jenkins received an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.

Upcoming projects include a series based on Colson Whitehead's novel _The Underground Railroad_ and a screenplay based on the life of Claressa Shields.[20] The main cast of _The Underground Railroad_ will include Thuso Mbedu as Cora, with Chase W. Dillon as Homer and Aaron Pierre as Caesar. The project was first set up more than two years ago on the heels of Jenkins’ Oscar wins for the film _Moonlight_, with Amazon officially ordering it to series in June 2018.[21]


Personal life

Jenkins is in a relationship with fellow director Lulu Wang.[22]
