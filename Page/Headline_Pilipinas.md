Background

During the celebration of DZMM's 30th anniversary on October 4, 2016, the announcement came as a welcome surprise in order to expand the programming of the station's television counterpart DZMM TeleRadyo.

The program premiered on October 10, 2016 and is anchored by veteran broadcast journalist Tony Velasquez, together with DYAB / TV Patrol Central Visayas anchor Leo Lastimosa, and DXAB / TV Patrol Southern Mindanao anchor-reporter Melanie Severino. Velasquez delivers news from Metro Manila and Luzon, as well as other national stories; Lastimosa gives reports from Visayas; and Severino gives reports from Mindanao.

On July 22, 2019, Headline Pilipinas has expanded to to an hour replacing Radyo Patrol Balita Alas-Dose with Julius Babao serving as the co-anchor for Metro Manila and Luzon and RC Dalaguit for Visayas.

Similar to ABS-CBN News Channel's noontime newscast Dateline Philippines, the newscast delivers the latest and the most relevant news gathered from all over the Philippines through the ABS-CBN Regional news teams, and gives voice to Filipinos from different regions.[1][2]
