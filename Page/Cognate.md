Etymological_Relationships_Tree.png

In linguistics, COGNATES are words that have a common etymological origin.[1] Cognates are often inherited from a shared parent language, but they may also involve borrowings from some other language. For example, the English words _dish_ and _desk_ and the German word _Tisch_ ("table") are cognates because they all come from Latin _discus_, which relates to their flat surfaces. Cognates may have evolved similar, different or even opposite meanings, but in most cases there are some similar sounds or letters in the words, in some cases appearing to be dissimilar. Some words sound similar, but don't come from the same root; these are called false cognates, while some are truly cognate but differ in meaning; these are called false friends.

The word _cognate_ derives from the Latin noun _cognatus_, which means "blood relative".[2]


Characteristics

Cognates do not need to have the same meaning, which may have changed as the languages developed separately. For example English _starve_ and Dutch _sterven_ or German _sterben_ ("to die") all derive from the same Proto-Germanic root, _*sterbaną_ ("die"). _Discus_ is from Greek _δίσκος_ (from the verb _δικεῖν_ "to throw"). A later and separate English reflex of _discus_, probably through medieval Latin _desca_, is _desk_ (see OED s.v. _desk_).

Cognates also do not need to have similar forms: English _father_, French _père_, and Armenian հայր (_hayr_) all descend directly from Proto-Indo-European _*ph₂tḗr_. An extreme case is Armenian երկու (_erku_) and English _two_, which descend from Proto-Indo-European _*dwóh₁_ (note that the sound change _*dw_ > _erk_ in Armenian is regular).


Across languages

Examples of cognates in Indo-European languages are the words _night_ (English), _nuit_ (French), _noche_ (Spanish), _Nacht_ (German), _nacht_ (Dutch), _nag_ (Afrikaans), _nicht_ (Scots), _natt_ (Swedish, Norwegian), _nat_ (Danish), _nátt_ (Faroese), _nótt_ (Icelandic), _noc_ (Czech, Slovak, Polish), ночь, _noch_ (Russian), ноќ, _noć_ (Macedonian), нощ, _nosht_ (Bulgarian), _ніч_, _nich_ (Ukrainian), _ноч_, _noch_/_noč_ (Belarusian), _noč_ (Slovene), _noć_ (Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian), νύξ, _nyx_ (Ancient Greek, _νύχτα_/_nychta_ in Modern Greek), _nox/nocte_ (Latin), _nakt-_ (Sanskrit), _natë_ (Albanian), _nos_ (Welsh), _nueche_ (Asturian), _noite_ (Portuguese and Galician), _notte_ (Italian), _nit_ (Catalan), _nuèch/nuèit_ (Occitan), _noapte_ (Romanian), _nakts_ (Latvian), _naktis_ (Lithuanian) and _Naach_ (Colognian), all meaning "night" and being derived from the Proto-Indo-European "night".

Another Indo-European example is _star_ (English), _str-_ (Sanskrit), _tara_ (Hindustani and Bengali), _tora_ (Assamese), _astre_/_étoile_ (French), _ἀστήρ (astēr)_ (Greek or _ἀστέρι_/_ἄστρο_, _asteri_/_astro_ in Modern Greek), _astro/stella_ (Italian), _aster_ (Latin) _stea_ (Romanian and Venetian), _stairno_ (Gothic), _astgh_ (Armenian), _Stern_ (German), _ster_ (Dutch and Afrikaans), _Schtähn_ (Colognian), _starn_ (Scots), _stjerne_ (Norwegian and Danish), _stjarna_ (Icelandic), _stjärna_ (Swedish), _stjørna_ (Faroese), _setāre_ (Persian), _stoorei_ (Pashto), _seren_ (Welsh), _steren_ (Cornish), _estel_ (Catalan), _estela_ (Occitan) _estrella_ and _astro_ Spanish, _estrella_ Asturian and Leonese, _estrela_ and _astro_ (Portuguese and Galician) and _estêre_ or _stêrk_ (Kurdish), from the Proto-Indo-European "star".

The Arabic _salām_, the Hebrew _shalom_, the Assyrian Neo-Aramaic _shlama_ and the Amharic _selam_ ("peace") are also cognates, derived from the Proto-Semitic *šalām- "peace".

Cognates may often be less easily recognised than the above examples, and authorities sometimes differ in their interpretations of the evidence. The English word _milk_ is clearly a cognate of German _Milch_, Dutch _melk_, Russian _молоко (moloko)_ and Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian _mleko_, also Montenegrin _mlijeko_.[3] On the other hand, French _lait_, Catalan _llet_, Italian _latte_, Romanian _lapte_, Spanish _leche_ and _leite_ (Portuguese and Galician) (all meaning "milk") are less-obvious cognates of Ancient Greek __ _gálaktos_ (genitive singular of _gála_, "milk"), a relationship that is more evidently seen through the intermediate Latin _lac_ "milk" as well as the English word _lactic_ and other terms borrowed from Latin. All of them come from Proto-Indo-European "milk".

Some cognates are semantic opposites. For instance, while the Hebrew word _chutzpah_ means "impudence," its Classical Arabic cognate _ḥaṣāfah_ means "sound judgment."[4] Another example is English _empathy_ "understanding of thoughts" and Greek _εμπάθεια_ "malice".


Within the same language

Cognates within a single language, or _doublets_, may have meanings that are slightly or even totally different. For example, English _ward_ and _guard_ (<PIE _*wer-_, "to perceive, watch out for") are cognates, as are _shirt_ (garment on top) and _skirt_ (garment on bottom) (<PIE _*sker-_, "to cut"). In some cases, including this one, one cognate ("skirt") has an ultimate source in another language related to English,[5] but the other one ("shirt") is native.[6] That happened with many loanwords, such as _skirt_ in this example, which was borrowed from Old Norse during the Danelaw.

Sometimes both doublets come from other languages, often the same one but at different times. For example, the word _chief_ (meaning the leader of any group) comes from the Middle French _chef_ ("head"), and its modern pronunciation preserves the Middle French consonant sound; the word _chef_ (the leader of the cooks) was borrowed from the same source centuries later, but by then, the consonant had changed to a "sh" sound in French. Such word sets can also be called etymological twins, and they may come in groups of higher numbers, as with, for example, the words _wain_ (native), _waggon/wagon_ (Dutch), and _vehicle_ (Latin) in English.

A word may also enter another language, develop a new form or meaning there, and be re-borrowed into the original language; that is called reborrowing. For example, the Greek word _κίνημα_ (_kinima_, "movement") became French _cinéma_ (compare American English _movie_) and then later returned to Greece as _σινεμά_ (_sinema_, "the art of film", "movie theater"). In Greek, _κίνημα_ (_kinima_, "movement") and _σινεμά_ (_sinema_, "filmmaking, cinema") are now doublets.[7]

A less obvious English-language doublet pair is _grammar_ and _glamour_.


False cognates

False cognates are words that people commonly believe are related (have a common origin), but that linguistic examination reveals are unrelated. For example, on the basis of superficial similarities, the Latin verb _habēre_ and German _haben_, both meaning 'to have', appear to be cognates. However, because the words evolved from different roots, in this case, different Proto-Indo-European (PIE) roots, they cannot be cognate (see for example Grimm's law). German _haben_, like English _have_, comes from PIE _*kh₂pyé-_ 'to grasp', and its real cognate in Latin is _capere_, 'to seize, grasp, capture'. Latin _habēre_, on the other hand, is from PIE _*gʰabʰ_, 'to give, to receive', and hence cognate with English _give_ and German _geben_.[8]

Likewise, English _much_ and Spanish _mucho_ look similar and have a similar meaning but are not cognates, as they evolved from different roots: _much_ from Proto-Germanic _*mikilaz_ < PIE _*meǵ-_ and _mucho_ from Latin _multum_ < PIE _*mel-_.[9]

[2] "cognate", _The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language_, 4th ed.: "Latin _cognātus_: _co-_, co- + _gnātus_, born, past participle of _nāscī_, to be born." Other definitions of the English word include "[r]elated by blood; having a common ancestor" and "[r]elated or analogous in nature, character, or function".

[7] In fact, _σινεμά_ stands beside a Greek neologism based on the original form of the same root, _κινηματογράφος_ (_kinimatoγráfos_), with the same two meanings as _cinéma_/_σινεμά_. (The film or movie itself is the unrelated _ταινία_ (_tainia_).)
