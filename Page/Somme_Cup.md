The SOMME CUP is a rugby trophy first won by a New Zealand Army team, known as the Trench Blacks, during World War One in 1917. It is claimed that around 60,000 people watched the match, which was won 40-0 by the New Zealand team.[1][2]

The cup depicts a soldier throwing a grenade, and was created by Georges Chauvel in 1917[3], a French sculptor in the French Army at the time.[4]

The cup has been in a private collection since it was first won in the War.

In September 2015 the New Zealand Defence Force's rugby team, the Defence Blacks, played a commemorative match against a French team in Paris.[5]

In early 2016, the cup was put on display at the National Army Museum in Waiouru, as part of an exhibition about rugby during World War One.[6]
