BIP (Believe in People) is an anonymous street painter who is identified, from clues released on Twitter and by his intermediaries, to be a male Princeton graduate, former investment banker, and current artist.


Practice

BiP produces work internationally as a large-scale muralist, street artist, and an occasional animator. Because graffiti artists focus on perfecting lettering styles, spreading their brand and other common characteristics of graffiti, BiP does not consider his spray-painting, stenciling, and wheat-pasting to be traditional graffiti. According to BiP, “traditional graffiti writers would be infuriated to hear his work called ‘graffiti’”.[1] Likewise, BiP has claimed publicly that his work is not committed to graffiti for graffiti’s sake but rather, dedicated to a spirit of resistance to skepticism and estrangement, so as to positively change the way people interact with their environment.[2]


Inspiration

In 2011, BiP allowed Kimberly Chow, a 2009 Yale University alumnus and former Yale Daily News reporter, to interview him and witness him in action painting a piece that visualizes the origins to his creative work. According to Chow, the name, "BiP", is a manifesto in response to a theme the artist discovered repeated throughout his deceased childhood friend's journals.[3]


East Coast Period

BiP's spray-paint and stencil murals began popping up overnight around New Haven beginning in Oct. 2010. Early in his career, BiP illegally painted buildings and spaces around Yale University in New Haven.[4] One of his highest-profile paintings in New Haven is a large smiling portrait of Anne Frank located outside of Partner's Cafe, a bar on Crown Street, a nightlife district.

During this time, reactions to BiP's work were polarizing. While his illegal work was frequently celebrated by city residents and journalists, city officials condemned his works as acts of vandalism. Abigail Rider, real estate manager for Yale University says:

City spokeswoman of New Haven Elizabeth Benton on "Encurbagement" project of BiP says:

Despite these reactions, BiP gained a cult following in Connecticut, with news sources such as NBC Connecticut openly speculating BiP's identity and intentions.[5]


West Coast Period

In what is confirmed from news articles to be 2013 or 2014, BiP relocated to a permanent residence in San Francisco, California.[6] After re-location, BiP discontinued painting illegally (citation needed, not confirmed) and began to paint gigantic murals with permission. In 2015, BiP completed a 7-story mural in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco, depicting a man examining his own heart under a microscope.[7]

The following year, BiP created a 5-story mural in downtown Oakland, California, of an elderly Oakland resident listening to a heavy metal album.[8]

BiP followed this growth with a string of large buildings throughout the Bay Area and by 2018[9] had become synonymous with the West Coast street art revival.[10]

BiP's most well known mural is a 2017 5-story building for the San Francisco Westfield Centre, known as "No Ceiling",[11][12] depicting a young African-American resident with artificially large muscles.[13] In 2018 BiP announced plans to continue with up to ten additional buildings in San Francisco.[14]


International/Touring Period

Starting in 2015, BiP began to travel aggressively, painting for international museums and public art festivals while maintaining total anonymity. Beginning with an 8-story mural for the Museum of Krasnoyarsk, Russia,[15][16] BiP followed with a tour of South America sponsored by Montana Colors Spraypaint[17][18] as well as a 4-story mural for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Taipei, Taiwan (citation needed).

Throughout this time, BiP continued to wear a mask that has become synonymous with his public performances.[19]

In an interview with reporter Jonathan Curiel of San Francisco Weekly, BiP reflected on the changes brought on by international success as a young artist.[20]
