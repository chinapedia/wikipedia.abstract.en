was the 50th emperor of Japan,[1] according to the traditional order of succession.[2] Kammu reigned from 781 to 806, and it was during his reign that Japanese imperial power reached its peak.[3]


Traditional narrative

Kammu's personal name (_imina_) was .[4] He was the eldest son of Prince Shirakabe (later known as Emperor Kōnin), and was born prior to Shirakabe's ascension to the throne.[5] According to the , Yamabe's mother, Yamato no Niigasa (later called Takano no Niigasa), was a 10th generation descendant of Muryeong of Baekje.[6]

After his father became emperor, Kammu's half-brother, Prince Osabe was appointed to the rank of crown prince. His mother was Princess Inoe, a daughter of Emperor Shōmu; but instead of Osabe, it was Kammu who was later named to succeed their father. After Inoe and Prince Osabe were confined and then died in 775, Osabe's sister – Kammu's half-sister Princess Sakahito – became Kammu's wife. Later, when he ascended to the throne in 781, Kammu appointed his young brother, Prince Sawara, whose mother was Takano no Niigasa, as crown prince. Hikami no Kawatsugu, a son of Emperor Tenmu's grandson Prince Shioyaki and Shōmu's daughter Fuwa, attempted to carry out a coup d'état in 782, but it failed and Kawatsugu and his mother were sent into exile. In 785 Sawara was expelled and died in exile.

The Nara period saw the appointment of the first _shōgun_, Ōtomo no Otomaro by Emperor Kanmu in 794 CE. The shōgun was the military dictator of Japan with near absolute power over territories via the military. Otomaro was declared "Sei-i Taishōgun" which means "Barbarian-subduing Great General".[7] Emperor Kanmu granted the second title of shōgun to Sakanoue no Tamuramaro for subduing the Emishi in northern Honshu.[8]

Kammu had 16 empresses and consorts, and 32 imperial sons and daughters.[9] Among them, three sons would eventually ascend to the imperial throne: Emperor Heizei, Emperor Saga and Emperor Junna. Some of his descendants (known as the _Kammu Taira_ or _Kammu Heishi_) took the Taira hereditary clan title, and in later generations became prominent warriors. Examples include Taira no Masakado, Taira no Kiyomori, and (with a further surname expansion) the Hōjō clan. The _waka_ poet Ariwara no Narihira was one of his grandsons.

Kammu is traditionally venerated at his tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates , in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, as the location of Kammu's mausoleum.[10]

Events of Kammu's life

Kammu was an active emperor who attempted to consolidate government hierarchies and functions. Kammu appointed Sakanoue no Tamuramaro (758–811) to lead a military expedition against the Emishi.[11]

-   737:[12] Kammu was born.
-   773:[13] Received the title of crown prince.
-   APRIL 30, 781[14](): In the 11th year of Kōnin's reign, he abdicated; and the succession was received by his son Kammu.[15] Shortly thereafter, Emperor Kammu is said to have ascended to the throne.[16] During his reign, the capital of Japan was moved from Nara (Heijō-kyō) to Nagaoka-kyō in 784.[17] Shortly thereafter, the capital would be moved again in 794.[18]
-   JULY 28, 782 (): The _sadaijin_ Fujiwara no Uona was involved in an incident that resulted in his removal from office and exile to Kyushi.[19] Claiming illness, Uona was permitted to return to the capital where he died; posthumously, the order of banishment was burned and his office restored.[20] In the same general time frame, Fujiwara no Tamaro was named Udaijin. During these days in which the offices of _sadaijin_ and _udaijin_ were vacant, the major counselors (the _dainagon_) and the emperor assumed responsibilities and powers which would have been otherwise delegated.[21]
-   783 (): The _udaijin_ Tamaro died at the age of 62 years.[22]
-   783 (): Fujiwara no Korekimi became the new _udaijin_ to replace the late Fujiwara no Tamaro.[23]
-   793 (): Under the leadership of Dengyō, construction began on the Enryaku Temple.[24]
-   794:[25] The capital was relocated again, this time to Heian-kyō, where the palace was named .[26]
-   NOVEMBER 17, 794 (): The emperor traveled by carriage from Nara to the new capital of Heian-kyō in a grand procession.[27] This marks the beginning of the Heian period.
-   794 appointed Ōtomo no Otomaro as the first Shōgun "Sei-i Taishōgun—"Barbarian-subduing Great General", together with Sakanoue no Tamuramaro subdues the Emishi in Northern Honshu.[28]
-   806:[29] Kammu died at the age of 70.[30] Kammu's reign lasted for 25 years.

Eras of Kammu's reign

The years of Kammu's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name (_nengō_).[31]

-   _Ten'ō_ (781–82)
-   _Enryaku_ (782–806)


Politics

Earlier Imperial sponsorship of Buddhism, beginning with Prince Shōtoku (574–622), had led to a general politicization of the clergy, along with an increase in intrigue and corruption. In 784 Kammu shifted his capital from Nara to Nagaoka-kyō in a move that was said to be designed to edge the powerful Nara Buddhist establishments out of state politics—while the capital moved, the major Buddhist temples, and their officials, stayed put. Indeed, there was a steady stream of edicts issued from 771 right through the period of Kūkai's studies which, for instance, sought to limit the number of Buddhist priests, and the building of temples. However the move was to prove disastrous and was followed by a series of natural disasters including the flooding of half the city. In 785 the principal architect of the new capital, and royal favourite, Fujiwara no Tanetsugu, was assassinated.

Meanwhile, Kammu's armies were pushing back the boundaries of his empire. This led to an uprising, and in 789 a substantial defeat for Kammu's troops. Also in 789 there was a severe drought and famine—the streets of the capital were clogged with the sick, and people avoiding being drafted into the military, or into forced labour. Many disguised themselves as Buddhist priests for the same reason. Consequently, in 792 Kammu abolished national conscription, replacing it with a system wherein each province formed a militia from the local gentry. Then in 794 Kammu suddenly shifted the capital again, this time to Heian-kyō, which is modern day Kyoto. The new capital was started early the previous year, but the change was abrupt and led to even more confusion amongst the populace.

Politically Kammu shored up his rule by changing the syllabus of the university. Confucian ideology still provided the _raison d'être_ for the Imperial government. In 784 Kammu authorised the teaching of a new course based on the _Spring and Autumn Annals_ based on two newly imported commentaries: _Kung-yang_ and _Ku-liang_. These commentaries used political rhetoric to promote a state in which the Emperor, as "Son of Heaven," should extend his sphere of influence to barbarous lands, thereby gladdening the people. In 798 the two commentaries became required reading at the government university.

Kammu also sponsored the travels of the monks Saichō and Kūkai to China, from where they returned to found the Japanese branches of, respectively, Tendai and Shingon Buddhism.


Kugyō

is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.[32]

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career. During Kammu's reign, this apex of the ''Daijō-kan included:

-   _Sadaijin_, Fujiwara no Uona　(藤原魚名),　781–782.[33]
-   _Sadaijin_, Fujiwara no Tamaro　(藤原田麿),　783.

-   _Udaijin_, Fujiwara no Tamaro　(藤原田麿), 782–783.[34]
-   _Udaijin_, Fujiwara no Korekimi　(藤原是公),　783–789.[35]
-   _Udaijin_, Fujiwara no Tsuginawa　(藤原継縄),790–796.[36]
-   _Udaijin_, Miwa ōkimi or Miwa oh　(神王), 798–806
-   _Udaijin_, Fujiwara no Uchimaro (藤原内麻呂) (756–812), 806–812.[37]
-   _Dainagon_

When the daughter of a _chūnagon_ became the favored consort of the Crown Prince Ate (later known as Heizei_-tennō_), her father's power and position in court was affected. Kammu disapproved of , daughter of Fujiwara no Tadanushi; and Kammu had her removed from his son's household.[38]

Legacy

In 2001, Japan's emperor Akihito told reporters "I, on my part, feel a certain kinship with Korea, given the fact that it is recorded in the _Chronicles of Japan_ that the mother of Emperor Kammu was of the line of King Muryong of Baekje." It was the first time that a Japanese emperor publicly acknowledged Korean blood in the imperial line.[42] According to the _Shoku Nihongi_, Emperor Kammu's mother, Takano no Niigasa, is a descendant of Prince Junda, son of Muryeong, who died in Japan in 513 (_Nihon Shoki_, Chapter 17).
