SAMARITAN AVIATION is a 501 C-3 non-profit Christian organization that serves the population in the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea through emergency evacuation flights, the delivery of medical supplies, and continued community outreach and health programs.[1] The non-profit is funded by the Papua New Guinea government and individual donations.[2]


History

Samaritan Aviation was founded in 1999 by Mark Palm and a friend as a means of providing crucial medical services to the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea. To avoid the difficult transport through 30,000 square miles of jungle, Samaritan Aviation introduced the country’s only floatplane in 2010, a retrofitted Cessna 206, which dramatically increased the availability of healthcare to around 500,000 people.[3][4] In August 2015, Samaritan Aviation launched their Every Life Matters Tour, introducing their second Cessna 206 floatplane and making stops in Dallas, San Antonio, Denver, Montrose, Prescott, Mesa, and Kingman before shipping the plane to Papua New Guinea.[5]
