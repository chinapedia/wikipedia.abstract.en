Plot

A young woman's sensitive gesture is misunderstood by her partner causing an umpteenth row until a tragic end... But also this one will be officially filed as an accident, like too many other femicides caused by domestic violence... Under the auspices of Amnesty International in Italy [3] "In five minutes of dramatic live broadcasting we assist to one of the many femicides.
