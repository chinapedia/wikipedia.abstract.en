The SENTINELS are a fictional variety of mutant-hunting robots appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. They are typically depicted as antagonists to the X-Men.

The Sentinels played a large role in the 1990s _X-Men_ animated series and have been featured in several X-Men video games. The Sentinels are featured prominently in the 2014 film _X-Men: Days of Future Past_ while simulated versions made brief appearances in the 2006 film _X-Men: The Last Stand_ and the 2016 film _X-Men: Apocalypse_. In 2009, The Sentinels were ranked as IGN's 38th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.[1]


Publication history

The_X-Men_(Uncanny_X-Men)-vol.1-14_(November_1965).jpg'' #14 (November 1965). Art by Jack Kirby.]] Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, they first appeared in _The X-Men_ #14 (November 1965).

Sentinels are programmed to locate mutants and capture or kill them. Though several types of Sentinels have been introduced, the typical Sentinel is three stories tall, is capable of flight, projects energy blasts, and can detect mutants.


Characteristics

Sentinels are designed to hunt mutants. While many are capable of tactical thought, only a handful are self-aware.

Sentinels are technologically advanced, and have exhibited a wide variety of abilities. They are armed (primarily with energy weapons and restraining devices), capable of flight, and can detect mutants at long range. They possess vast physical strength, and their bodies are highly resistant to damage. Some are able to alter their physical forms or re-assemble and reactivate themselves after they have been destroyed.

Some Sentinel variants have the ability to learn from their experiences, developing their defenses during an engagement. Several groups of Sentinels have been created and/or led by a single massive Sentinel called Master Mold. Some Sentinels are also equipped with an inconspicuous logic loop in case they should go rogue to convince them that they are mutants as demonstrated in the Tri-Sentinel.


Types of Sentinels

Sentinels.PNG'' vol. 3, #1 (July 2004). Art by John Cassaday.]] There are different types of Sentinels that appear in the comics:

-   MARK I and MASTER MOLD - Created by Bolivar Trask. First appeared in _X-Men_ (vol. 1) #14. Bolivar Trask sacrificed himself to destroy the Master Mold.
-   MARK II - Created by Larry Trask. This model was capable of adapting to and counteracting superpowers almost instantly. First appeared in _X-Men_ (vol. 1) #57.
    -   NO.2, the robotic leader of Larry's Sentinels, later "mutated" with the capability of creating space warps.[2]
-   COMPOSITE - Created by merging the remaining portions of five Sentinels destroyed by the X-Men and came under control of Ashley Martin. It was destroyed by her when it rebelled against her.
-   MARK III - Created by Stephen Lang and Project: Armageddon, secretly funded by Edward Buckman and the Council of the Chosen. First appeared in _X-Men_ (vol. 1) #98.
    -   X-SENTINELS - Created by Stephen Lang. They are androids who were duplicates of the original X-Men.
-   MARK IV - Created by Sebastian Shaw. First appeared in _X-Men_ (vol. 1) #151.
-   MARK V - Created by Sebastian Shaw for U.S. government's Project Wideawake. First appeared in _New Mutants_ (vol. 1) #2.
-   MARK VI - Created by Shaw Industries for Project Wideawake and used by Onslaught. Also incorporated parts of Project Nimrod.
-   MARK VII - Created by Shaw Industries. They were experimental and remote controlled.
-   NIMROD (later Bastion) - A prototype Super Sentinel that arrived from the "Days of Future Past" timeline and was later reactivated by Reverend William Stryker.
    -   PROJECT NIMROD - Created by an offshoot of Project Wideawake and was in the experimental stage. Cancelled after X-Force interfered. Based on the Nimrod Sentinel.
-   PRIME SENTINELS - Created by Bastion and _Operation: Zero Tolerance_. They are disabled humans equipped with nanotechnology without their knowledge at Prospero Clinic. The Prime Sentinels were used as sleeper agents until activated by attack or presence of a mutant.
-   OMEGA PRIME SENTINELS - The second generation of Prime Sentinels. Karima Shapandar is one of them.
-   WILD SENTINELS - Built in secret by a new Master Mold in Ecuador, activated by Donald Trask III and used by Cassandra Nova. New units are produced based on the currently available resources – salvaged parts, weapons and sometimes even entire vehicles – which give this particular type of Sentinel a very diverse, rag-tag appearance. Due to both this and their design flexibility, a wide variety of different shapes and forms have been observed. The Mega-Sentinels used to destroy Genosha and Nanosentinels both belong to this kind of Sentinel. The technology used in Nano-Sentinels is also employed by Weapon Plus for their artificial evolution experiments and the creation of their Super-Sentinels.
-   MARK VIII - Sentinel Squad O*N*E, designed by Stark Enterprises. Unlike other Sentinels, the Mark VIII requires a human pilot.
-   BIO-SENTINELS - Humans infected by a technological virus created by Simon Trask, the victims become anti-mutant activists, who later at Trask's command, are fully transformed into robotic Sentinels mindlessly following Trask's commands.[3]
-   STARK SENTINELS - The Stark Sentinels debuted during the _AXIS_ storyline. Under the influence of the Red Skull (who also had erased from him any memory of their construction), Tony Stark created a model of Sentinels based on the knowledge of different super heroes he acquired after the _Civil War_ storyline. When Red Skull became the Red Onslaught, and the Avengers arrived to Genosha to stop him, he deployed the Stark Sentinels.[4]

Other versions

The following are alternative versions of the Sentinels, which appear outside of regular Marvel canon.

Age of Apocalypse

In the "Age of Apocalypse" timeline, Bolivar Trask created the Sentinels with his wife Moira. These Sentinels are equipped with several body-mounted gun turrets, and their primary directive is to protect humans rather than to hunt mutants. They are capable of cooperating with mutants in order to further this mission.[8] Later, the Sentinels are adapted by Weapon Omega to serve a reverse purpose, and now aid in the hunting of the human race.[9]

Days of Future Past

In the "Days of Future Past" timeline, which takes place in an alternate future, the "Omega Sentinels" have advanced technologically and become the _de facto_ rulers of the United States. The most powerful among them is Nimrod.

Hembeck

In the joke comic _Fred Hembeck Destroys the Marvel Universe_, the X-Men are killed by silent, black, man-sized "Ninja Sentinels".

Here Comes Tomorrow

In the "Here Comes Tomorrow" future timeline, a Sentinel named ROVER is Tom Skylark's companion and protector. After more than 150 years of being active, Rover has become self-aware and, possibly, capable of emotion.

House of M

In the _House of M_ storyline, Magneto is victorious in a mutant/human war. The Sentinels are adapted by Sebastian Shaw, now the director of S.H.I.E.L.D., to serve a reverse purpose, and now aid in the hunting of sapien rebels.

MC2

In the MC2 timeline, Wild Thing encounters a Prime Sentinel that has accidentally been activated by a faulty microwave.

Ronin

In the alternate reality of _X-Men: Ronin_, the story is played out in Japan. A police unit called "Sentinel Force" designs, builds and pilots the robots. These are aesthetically similar to regular Sentinels, but each is subtly different from the others.

Star Trek

In the comic crossover _X-Men/Star Trek: Second Contact_, the X-Men work with the crew of the _Enterprise_-E to battle Kang the Conqueror. An away team composed of Captain Picard, Deanna Troi, Nightcrawler and Colossus encounter an approximation of the "Days of Future Past" timeline, in which the Sentinels have merged with the Borg.

Ultimate Marvel

In _Ultimate X-Men_, the Sentinels, created by the Ultimate Marvel version of Bolivar Trask, were already in action at the beginning of the first story arc, hunting down and killing mutants on the streets, in a program apparently openly and publicly acknowledged by the U.S. government. Later on, there were also the _New Sentinels_ that were sixty of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s top agents in Sentinel battle armor and they were described to have enough hardware to take on a fleet of the old Sentinel models. A new breed of Sentinel robots, created by Trask under orders from the Fenris twins, was later created.

After the events of the Ultimatum Wave, a new model of Sentinel (Nimrod Sentinels) was deployed to hunt, capture or kill mutants that refused to turn themselves in. William Stryker, Jr. using Sentinel tech, later displayed an ability to summon a fleet of Sentinels after being attacked by the Shroud.[10]

What If?

-   In _What If_... Starring Cannonball's little brother Josh -- and his pet Sentinel", shows Josh (who would, in normal continuity, later become Icarus) finding and adopting a Sentinel.[11]
-   In "What if... Starring Secret Wars: 25 Years Later", the children of Marvel heroes are teleported back to Earth where, sometime in the last 25 years, a variation of "Days of Future Past" is shown when the group is attacked by Sentinels.[12]
-   In "What if... Starring Juggernaut: The Kingdom of Cain", Juggernaut has killed the X-Men, and as a result there is no one to oppose the Sentinels, so the world is ravaged by them until they are destroyed by Juggernaut.[13]


In other media

Television

-   A Sentinel appeared in _Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends_. In the episode "A Firestar Is Born", Its seen in a flashback, fighting the X-Men back when Firestar was a member.
-   The Sentinels appeared a number of times on the _X-Men_ animated series, voiced by David Fox. They were season one's main antagonists. The Sentinels first hunt down Jubilee. The Sentinel program, controlled by Bolivar Trask and Henry Peter Gyrich, was cancelled but was moved overseas to Genosha. Trask constructed Master Mold for the Sentinels while on Genosha, but it was apparently destroyed when Storm flooded the complex. Sentinels are later seen in Bishop's future timeline where they had taken over the world and mutants were on the verge of extinction. In the season one finale, the Sentinels, acting under Trask's orders, rescued Senator Robert Kelly from Magneto, but Master Mold was then "giving the orders now" in Trask's and Gyrich's secret base in the United States. As Master Mold plans to kidnap world leaders from around the world and replace their brains with computers so that the world would fall under its control, the X-Men managed to fight through a seemingly endless wave of Sentinels until Professor Charles Xavier flew the explosive-filled Blackbird into Master Mold and escaped at the last minute with Magneto's help. However, the Sentinels had sporadic appearances in season four.
-   The Sentinels appeared in _Spider-Man: The Animated Series_. In the episode "The Mutant Agenda", they are seen in a Danger Room simulation when Spider-Man accidentally activated the simulation when visiting the X-Mansion.
-   The Sentinels appear in _X-Men: Evolution_. This version is much more powerful and heavily armed than their comic book counterparts. There was originally only a prototype created by former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Bolivar Trask, however, released in public by Magneto to force the X-Men to fight the prototype and reveal mutant existence to the media. The prototype alone was a dangerous challenge, even for the combined might of the X-Men and the Brotherhood. Three upgraded models are later used by S.H.I.E.L.D. against Apocalypse and prove a difficult fight for the ancient mutant. Professor Xavier's future visions in the series finale hinted at Nimrod appearing later in the show's timeline leading a fleet of Sentinels.
-   Sentinels appear in the _Wolverine and the X-Men_ animated series, voiced by Jim Ward. There are several types: Sentinel Prowler, the Mark I Sentinel, a more futuristic Sentinel, and Sentinel Hounds. The Sentinels are controlled by Master Mold.
-   Sentinels appear in _The Super Hero Squad Show_, voiced by Tom Kenny. This version were created in an alternate reality's future to defend a superhero-less city. They are seen in the episode "Days, Nights and Weekends of Future Past! (Six Against Infinity Part 2)".
-   A Sentinel appeared in a Danger Room simulation in _Marvel Anime: X-Men_.
-   A Sentinel appears in the _Ultimate Spider-Man_ animated series. In the episode "Game Over", Arcade's Madland game includes a real Sentinel (in the Days of Future Past level) which Spider-Man took control of, using its firepower to cheat through Arcade's levels.
-   A Sentinel appears in the Toei anime series _Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers_.
-   _The Gifted_ television series, which is connected to the _X-Men_ cinematic universe, features a modern-day government agency called SENTINEL SERVICES under the control of Agents Jace Turner and Edward Weeks. [14] After failing to capture the Mutant Underground, and Weeks is killed by Esme Frost, the determined Turner quit Sentinel Services. In the episode "eXtreme measures", Turner allied with Trask Industries (the Sentinels' creator) under Dr. Roderick Campbell is revealed to have been responsible for the Hound Program, which reprograms mutants. Sentinels in this universe are small spider-like robots with a rotating red eye in the center. They are extremely durable and can withstand intense physical assaults and intense heat, capable of quickly adapting to damage to continue functioning. They capture mutants by latching onto them with immense grip, even Thunderbird could not break free from a sentinel until a mutant named Eclipse assisted with an intense heat blast and even then the sentinel continued to function and hunt them. With their spider-like design, they can crawl and maneuver on walls and ceilings.

Films

-   Sentinels appeared in an early draft of _X-Men_ (2000), wherein Henry Gyrich and Bolivar Trask use the Sentinels, but this treatment didn't make past the concept stage.
-   Sentinels were planned for inclusion in _X2: X-Men United_ (2003), but they did not appear onscreen (although Project Wideawake is mentioned on a computer readout screen). Sentinel sketches appear as extras on the DVD release. The Sentinels' height was not specified, but the sketches indicated that although their appearance was not severely altered, they would have had the ability to compact itself into a rolling saucer as a mode of transportation.
-   A Sentinel was seen in _X-Men: The Last Stand_ (2006), during a training simulation for the young mutants at Professor Xavier's school. At the end of the session, Colossus throws Wolverine at the robot, resulting in its beheading. The Sentinel's body is shrouded in fog with the only part ever made visible to the viewer is its severed head.
-   The Sentinels are featured in _X-Men: Days of Future Past_ (2014) as secondary threat to the mutants.[15] In 1973, Bolivar Trask pitches the Sentinel concept to the US Congress but when they decline Trask he attempts pitching it to foreign powers. Mystique hunts down and kills Trask in revenge for the murder of mutants that were experimented on during the Sentinels' conception to accelerate the research for advancing them. Inspired by the fear of Trask's death, the US government approves the Sentinel program to hunt and kill mutants, and experimentation on Mystique, captured soon after killing Trask, leads to the creation of Sentinels that can adapt to and use mutant powers. The Sentinels eventually expand their targets beyond mutants to baseline humans based on the logic that they have the potential to produce mutant descendants, culminating in a dystopian future where most of humanity and mutantkind have been wiped out. With Kitty Pryde having developed the ability to project the minds of others into their past selves, the X-Men project Wolverine - the only person capable of surviving the time-travel's psychological strain - back into his past self in 1973 to rally the younger versions of Charles Xavier and Beast to stop Trask's assassination, setting into motion the events of the film. The storyline concludes with Mystique defeating Magneto and then deciding not to kill Trask on Xavier's encouragement, resulting in the government witnessing clear evidence that not all mutants are a threat to normal humans and deciding to abandon the Sentinel program. The original Sentinels from 1973 were similar in appearance to their comic counterparts being three times the size of a human, possessed gatling guns on one of their arms capable of firing 3000 rounds per minute, sensors that allow them to track carriers of the X-Gene and could fly using the vent-like systems on their chest. They were built out of a space-age polymer to be immune to Magneto's powers (but the mutant infuses them with metal bars to control them in the film's climax). In contrast, the future Sentinels were smaller and sleeker, with a body built out of adaptive mechanical scales, and besides having Mystique's adaptive powers they can reshape their hands into stabbing blades. The Sentinels were designed by Legacy Effects with Digital Domain building digital models based on their full-scale practical model while the future variant were all computer graphics made by Moving Picture Company.[16][17]
-   The 1973 Sentinels appear at the end of _X-Men: Apocalypse_ (2016), once again in a training simulation, where the new X-Men team begins their training.

Video games

Sentinels have appeared as major antagonists in almost every video game to feature the X-Men:

-   In the _X-Men_ arcade game, where they served as the bulk of enemies.
-   In _Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge_, they were featured enemies in Cyclops' levels.
-   In _X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse_, Sentinels appear as bosses in Genosha, with varying sizes.
-   A robot resembling a Sentinel also appears in both the arcade and SNES versions of _Captain America and the Avengers_. In the game, it is not called a 'Sentinel', but instead, is referred to simply as 'Robot'.
-   In _X-Men 2: Clone Wars_, in the second level (the first level after the title screen), Sentinels appear in the background, as the level is set in a high-tech factory that produces Sentinels.

Stryker would have the mutant-hunting robots track down and kill all mutants they could find. The Sentinels featured in the game appear to be similar to those from the game _X-Men: Children of the Atom_. There are two types of Sentinels: one is a smaller, aerial model; and the other is a giant walking behemoth.
-   In the _X-Men Origins: Wolverine_ video game, the Sentinel Mark I is one of the major bosses of the game.

A Salvaged Sentinel is an opponent for the players on the tutorial level. The Brotherhood of Mutants have also included their own versions of Sentinels called the M-Series Rho MK III, the M-Series Sigma MK III, and the M-Series MK III. In a Spec-Ops mission revolving around the Hellfire Club, Crimson Dynamo was hired by the Hellfire Club to build them Sentinels that obey their every command.
-   The Sentinels appear in _Marvel Heroes_.

Avengers’ enemy, Ultron was the one who deployed the Sentinels as backup plan to steal the rest of the stones from the heroes by starting an assault at Xavier Institute, should Ultron failed his assault at Avengers Tower. The last Sentinel, the Infinity Sentinel is destroyed by Magneto, who alongside his fellow Brotherhood member Mystique and Juggernaut were sent by Hellfire Club to steal the stone back to them, until the arrival of Thanos’ Black Orders cause them to join the heroes to save the universe from the Mad Titan.[19]

Toys

Several different toys of Sentinels have been made since their introduction. One is the X-Men Classics 10" Sentinel by Toybiz. A "Build-A-Figure" version of the character was made in wave ten of the _Marvel Legends_ line. The most recent Sentinel toy is made by Hasbro as part of the Marvel Universe line. Along with a large, unposeable statue, two Minimates figures have been made of the Sentinels. The first, a classic version, came with Rachel Summers in either her Phoenix or Marvel Girl guises. The second, based on _Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds_, comes with a red-haired "First Appearance" figure of Ryu. In 2014, The Lego group released a set in the Marvel Super Heroes line titled "X-Men vs. the Sentinel", featuring the sentinel as a buildable figure, also including the Blackbird, Magneto, Wolverine, Storm, and Cyclops.

Parodies

-   On the Adult Swim show _Robot Chicken_, the episode "Sausage Fest" showed a parody of the X-Men being killed by a Sentinel, and Professor X then recruiting the cast of the _Police Academy_ films to replace them. The Sentinel eventually kicks them far as Professor X quotes "Same time next week?" The Sentinel nods yes.
-   In an episode of ''Codename: Kids Next Door ''entitled "Operation S.A.F.E.T.Y", an ambassador for children's health decided to build many giant robots to prevent children from playing harmful games. The main robot (which is a parody of Master Mold) decided to capture adults (because they could harm kids) and take over the world.
-   _MAD Magazine_'s X-Men parody "ECH!-Men" featured a Sentinel (called "Sentinent") with a huge posterior.
