_PLASMODIUM CYNOMOLGI_ is an apicomplexan parasite that infects mosquitoes and Asian Old World monkeys. This species has been used as a model for human _Plasmodium vivax_ because _Plasmodium cynomolgi_ shares the same life cycle and some important biological features with _P. vivax_.[1]


Life cycle

The life cycle of _P. cynomolgi_ resembles that of other _Plasmodium_ species, particularly the related human parasite _Plasmodium vivax_.[2] Like other _Plasmodium_ species, _P. cynomolgi_ infects both an insect host and a vertebrate (generally Old World monkeys). The parasite is transmitted when the mosquito host takes a blood meal from the vertebrate host. During the feeding, motile parasites called sporozoites are injected from the mosquito salivary gland into the host tissue. These sporozoites move into the bloodstream and infect cells in the host liver, where they grow and divide over the course of approximately one week.[3] At this point, the parasitized liver cells rupture, releasing thousands of parasite daughter cells, called merozoites, which either move into the bloodstream to infect red blood cells, or remain in the liver to reinfect liver cells. Those that reinfect liver cells form a quiescent stage called a hypnozoite, which can remain dormant in the liver cell for months or years before reactivating.[4] The merozoites that enter the bloodstream infect red blood cells, where they grow and replicate. After approximately 48 hours, the infected red blood cell bursts, allowing the daughter merozoites to infect new red blood cells. This cycle can continue indefinitely. Occasionally, after infection of a red blood cell, the parasite develops into one of two distinct sexual forms called male and female gametocytes (also micro and macrogametocytes respectively). If a mosquito takes a blood meal containing a gametocyte of each sex, the two sexual stages merge and form a zygote.[5] The zygote develops into a motile stage called the ookinete which penetrates the wall of the mosquito gut and forms a stationary oocyst. The oocyst develops over about 11 days, then begins to release thousands of sporozoites into the mosquito's hemolymph. The sporozoites move through the hemolymph and infect the mosquito salivary glands, where they will again be injected into a mammalian host when the mosquito takes a blood meal.[6]

Description

_P. cynomolgi_ closely resembles the human parasite _P. vivax_ throughout its life cycle. Similar to _P. vivax_, _P. cynomolgi_ infection changes the red blood cell membrane structure, causing surface perturbations that appear as pink dots (called Sch√ºffner's dots) when stained with Giemsa.[7]


Ecology and distribution

_P. cynomolgi_ is found throughout Southeast Asia where it naturally infects a variety of macaque monkeys, including _Macaca cyclopis_, _Macaca fascicularis_, _Macaca mulatta_, _Macaca nemestrina_, _Macaca radiata_, _Macaca sinica_, _Trachypithecus cristatus_, and _Semnopithecus entellus_.[8][9] The effect of infection on primate hosts has primarily been studied in rhesus monkeys, where _P. cynomolgi_ generally causes mild and self-limiting illness.[10] Monkeys can suffer anemia and thrombocytopenia as well as occasional kidney inflammation, however all generally resolve without treatment.[11] The exception to this is in pregnant monkeys, where _P. cynomolgi_ infection can be severe, resulting in death of the mother and fetus without antimalarial treatment.[12]

Infection of humans with _P. cynomolgi_ is exceedingly rare. However, occasional zoonotic infections have been described. In addition to a few naturally occurring cases, human infection by _P. cynomolgi_ has been verified in laboratories both by experimental infection of human volunteers and by laboratory accidents resulting in human infection.[13][14] Transmission of _P. cynomolgi_ from human to human by a mosquito vector has also been shown in laboratory experiments, although it appears to occur rarely if at all in the environment.[15]

_P. cynomolgi_ also infects a broad variety of _Anopheles_ mosquitoes; the effect of infection on these mosquitoes is not known.[16]


Taxonomy and evolution

_P. cynomolgi_ is in the genus _Plasmodium_, which contains all Apicomplexan parasites that undergo asexual reproduction through schizogony and digest red blood cell hemoglobin to produce the crystalline pigment hemozoin. Within _Plasmodium_, _P. cynomolgi_ is in the subgenus _Plasmodium_, containing all species of _Plasmodium_ that infect primates (except for some that infect the Great Apes, which are in the subgenus _Laverania_).

Evolutionarily, _P. cynomolgi_ is most closely related to the other _Plasmodium_ species that infect monkeys, as well as _P. vivax_ which infects humans. Evolutionary relationships among _Plasmodium_ species have been inferred from ribosomal RNA sequencing, and are summarized in the cladogram below:[17]


Research

_P. cynomolgi_ is the second-most studied malaria parasite of non-human primates after _Plasmodium knowlesi_, primarily due to its similarity to the human parasite _P. vivax_.[18] In particular, _P. cynomolgi_ is used as a model for hypnozoite biology as it (along with _P. vivax_) is one of the few _Plasmodium_ species known to have this lifecycle stage.[19] _P. cynomolgi_ can infect a variety of monkey species and can be transmitted by several common laboratory-grown mosquitoes.[20][21] Due to this, _P. cynomolgi_ has been used in research on a broad variety of malaria topics including hypnozoite biology, host immune responses to infection, and to test the efficacy of antimalarial drugs and vaccines.[22]


History

_P. cynomolgi_ was first observed in 1905 in the blood of the long-tailed macaque.[23]
