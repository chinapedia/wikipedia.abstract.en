ERSKINE is an unincorporated community in Sherman County, in the U.S. state of Oregon.[1] It lies between Moro and Grass Valley along Erskine Road, west of U.S. Route 97.[2][3]

Erskine at various times was known by other names: Erskineville, Erskine Springs, and Millra.[4] An Erskineville post office was established here in 1882; Abiel Erskine was the first postmaster.[5] The Columbia Southern Railway called the place _Erskineville_ in 1900 when it built its line through this community, but the Union Pacific later shortened that to _Erskine_.[6] The Erskineville post office closed in 1907.[7] _Erskine_ is the name that appears on maps in the 21st century.[8]
