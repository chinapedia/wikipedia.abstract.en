History

A Benedictine abbey was established here by monks from Santâ€™Apollinare in Classe, and erected as this site, which once had a pagan temple of Adonis.

The church was erected in late-Romanesque/early-Gothic-style with three naves. The columns in the nave derive from spolia, originating from granite of Egypt. The apse dates to the 7th through 9th centuries.

The main altar is made from various marbles. The crypt is found below the main altar and had two 17th century crucifixes by Fra Innocenzo da Petralia. It also housed an urn, putatively with the relics of St Demetrius, returned to the city of Salonica in Greece.

The interior of the abbey has a _Madonna and Saints with scenes of the Passion_ (1535) by Ercole Ramazzani. There is a canvas depicting _St Demetrius and St Laurence receiving the martyrs' palms from a Jesus Child held by the Madonna_ (1530) by Pietro Paolo Agabito.
