It was formed in January 1977, the founding parties being the Communist Party of India (Marxist), All India Forward Bloc, the Revolutionary Socialist Party, the Marxist Forward Bloc, the Revolutionary Communist Party of India and the Biplabi Bangla Congress. Other parties joined in later years, most notably the Communist Party of India.

The Left Front ruled the state for seven consecutive terms 1977–2011, five with Jyoti Basu as Chief Minister and two under Buddhadev Bhattacharya.[1] The CPI(M) is the dominant force in the alliance.[2][3] In the 2011 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election the Left Front failed to gain a majority of seats and left office.

Background

The Left Front has its roots in various past platforms of collaboration of West Bengal left parties and anti-Indian National Congress forces.[5] Such examples were the United Left Front, the People's United Left Front and the United Front that governed West Bengal 1967–1971.[6] However, ahead of the March 1977 Lok Sabha election the left parties under the leadership of CPI(M) decided to form an alliance just amongst themselves, based on past negative experiences in collaboration with centrist anti-Congress forces.[7] The Left Front was set up as the repressive climate of the Emergency was relaxed in January 1977.[8] The six founding parties of the Left Front, i.e. the CPI(M), the All India Forward Bloc, the Revolutionary Socialist Party, the Marxist Forward Bloc, the Revolutionary Communist Party of India and the Biplabi Bangla Congress, articulated a common programme.[9][10] The Left Front contested the Lok Sabha election in an electoral understanding together with the Janata Party.[11]

The Workers Party of India applied for inclusion into the Left Front, but was denied entry.[12]


1977 elections

Left-Janata alliance in Lok Sabha election

In the 1977 Lok Sabha election the Left Front contested 26 out of the 42 West Bengal Lok Sabha constituencies; CPI(M) fielded candidates for 20 seats, RSP 3 seats and AIFB 3 seats.[13] CPI(M) won 17 seats, AIFB 3 seats and RSP 3 seats.[14] The combined Left Front vote in West Bengal reached 5,049,077 votes (33.4% of the votes cast in the state).[15]

Left victory in assembly polls

Ahead of the subsequent June 1977 West Bengal Legislative Assembly elections seat-sharing talks between the Left Front and the Janata Party broke down.[16] The Left Front had offered the Janata Party 56% of the seats and the post as Chief Minister to JP leader Prafulla Chandra Sen, but JP insisted on 70% of the seats.[17] The Left Front thus opted to contest the elections on its own.[18] It issued a 36-point manifesto ahead of the polls.[19] The Left Front manifesto has similarities with the past 32-point United Front manifesto.[20]

The seat-sharing within the Left Front was based on the 'Promode Formula', named after the CPI(M) State Committee Secretary Promode Dasgupta.[21] Under the Promode Formula the party with the highest share of votes in a constituency would continue to field candidates there, under its own election symbol and manifesto.[22]

CPI(M) contested 224 seats, AIFB 36, RSP 23, MFB 3, RCPI 4 and BBC 2. [23][24][25] There was also a Left Front-supported independent candidate in the Chakdaha seat.[26][27]

The Left Front won the election, winning 231 out of the 294 seats.[28][29] CPI(M) won 178 seats, AIFB 25, RSP 20, MFB 3, RCPI 3 and 1 independent.[30] AIFB and RSP won significant chunks of seats in northern Bengal.[31] The combined Left Front vote was 6,568,999 votes (45.8% of the votes cast in the state).[32] The electoral result came as a surprise to the Left Front itself, as it had offered 52% of the seats in the pre-electoral seat sharing talks with the Janata Party.[33][34]


First Left Front government

Jyotibasu.JPG, Chief Minister of West Bengal 1977–2000]]On 21 June 1977 the Left Front formed a government with Jyoti Basu as its Chief Minister.[35][36] The first cabinet meeting of the Left Front government orders the release of political prisoners[37]

The Socialist Party joined the Left Front after the 1977 elections.[38] Prior to the arrival of the Left Front government, the political environment of West Bengal was chaotic, and the new cabinet struggled to establish order.[39] The first years of governance was shaky, as the CPI(M) struggled with the notion of managing a communist government within a capitalist framework.[40][41] Minor coalition partners expressed concern over inviting multinational corporations to invest in West Bengal.[42]

Operation Barga and panchayat polls

In the initial phase of Left Front governance, two key priorities were land reform and decentralisation of administration.[43][44] On 29 September 1977 the West Bengal Land (Amendment) Bill was passed.[45] Through Operation Barga, in which share-croppers were given inheritable rights on lands they tilled, 1.1 million acres of land was distributed amongst 1.4 million share-croppers.[46][47] On 4 June 1978 three-tier panchayat local bodies were elected across the state, elections in which the Left Front won a landslide victory.[48][49] Some 800,000 acres of land were distributed to 1.5 million heads of households between 1978 and 1982.[50] The Left Front government was also credited with coping with the refugee situation created by the Bangladesh Liberation War and severe floods.[51]

Seeing distribution of central government funds as unjust and politicized, the Left Front government began measures to pressure the central government to change its approach towards the state governments. These movements eventually resulted in the Sarkaria Commission.[52]

1980 Lok Sabha election

Ahead of the 1980 Lok Sabha election the Left Front and the Communist Party of India entered into a seat-sharing agreement.[53] CPI(M) contested 31 seats, RSP 4 seats, AIFB 4 seats and CPI 3 seats.[54] CPI(M) won 28 seats, CPI 3 seats, AIFB 3 seats and RSP 4 seats.[55] The combined Left Front-CPI vote in West Bengal reached 11,086,354 votes (52.7% of the votes cast in the state).[56]

On 27 May 1980 the Left Front cancelled the past Code of Conduct for state government employees, which had limited the right to strike.[57]


Second Left Front government

Three new members

In 1982 the Left Front acquired three new members, CPI joined the Left Front ahead of the 1982 West Bengal Legislative Assembly elections and the Socialist Party was split into the Democratic Socialist Party (Prabodh Chandra) and the West Bengal Socialist Party (both DSP and WBSP became Left Front member parties).[58][59] Some of the older, smaller Left Front constituents were uncomfortable with the expansion of the alliance, claiming that CPI(M) was diluting it politically.[60] There were also disagreements on distribution of ministerial portfolios after the expansion of the alliance.[61]

1982 assembly election

CPI(M) contested 209 seats in the assembly election, CPI 12 seats, AIFB 34 seats and RSP 23 seats.[62] 16 candidates were fielded by the remainder of Left Front partners (RCPI, WBSP, DSP, BBC, MFB) and contested as independents.[63]

Jyoti Basu and five cabinet minister were sworn in on 27 May 1982.[69] Another 15 cabinet ministers and 22 Ministers of State were sworn in on 2 June 1982.[70]

A mammoth United Front, the national alliance backed by the left at the time, election meeting was held in Calcutta on 31 January 1998 with Jyoti Basu as the main speaker.[124] Basu undertook a tour of all West Bengal districts to campaign for the Left Front candidates.[125]

The CPI(M) candidates included 18 incumbent Lok Sabha MPs, whereas the CPI and RSP fielded all of their incumbent MPs.[126] The Left Front fielded the ex-mayor and 4-term minister Prasanta Sur to contest against Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee for the Calcutta South seat, but Sur failed to defeat Banerjee.[127][128][129] The Left Front also fielded Prasanta Chatterjee, the sitting mayor of Calcutta for the Calcutta Northeast seat as well as fielding sitting Howrah mayor Swadesh Chakravarty against the Congress(I) MP Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi.[130][131] AIFB fielded a new candidate in Barasat, as the Barasat MP Chitta Basu had died.[132]
