GUIDO MARTINA (9 February 1906 – 6 May 1991) was an Italian comic writer, documentarist and author.


Life and career

Born in Carmagnola, at 16 years old Martina moved with his family to Turin, where he graduated in literature and philosophy because of the insistence of his father, while he would have preferred to study engineering.[1] After brief experiences as teacher and journalist for _Il Popolo d'Italia_, he realized several documentaries as director and screenwriter, moving to live and work in Paris for five years.[2][3][4]

Returned to Italy in 1938, Martina started collaborating with _Topolino_ as translator of American stories. During this time he also wrote a radio variety show and directed a short-lived satirical magazine, _Fra' Diavolo_.[5] During World War II he served as cavalry officer in Libya, where he was taken prisoner by the British army. Following the Armistice of Cassibile he was moved in Poland, from where he was deported to a Nazi concentration camp in Austria.[6]

In 1945 Martina reprised his collaboration with _Topolino_, also creating his first original stories. In 1949 he started the "Grandi Parodie Disney" (i.e. "Great Disney Spoofs") saga with the celebrated story "L'inferno di Topolino", a parody of Dante Alighieri's _Inferno_. During his career he wrote hundreds of stories, creating dozens of characters, including Paperinik. In 1949 he created with Raffaele Paparella the popular western series _Pecos Bill_, and in 1952 the adventure series _Oklahoma_. He also collaborated with the comic magazines _Cucciolo_ and _Tiramolla_, and wrote several photonovels for _Il Vittorioso_.[7][8]

Outside comics, Martina also collaborated with Disney as author of 11 volumes of the 24 volumes-long _Enciclopedia Disney_, and as author of the book series in 21 volumes _In giro per il mondo con Disney_.[9]
