_REPO MAN_ is a 1984 American science fiction black comedy film written and directed by Alex Cox. It stars Harry Dean Stanton and Emilio Estevez, and was produced by Jonathan Wacks and Peter McCarthy with executive producer Michael Nesmith.

The plot concerns a young punk rock enthusiast (Estevez) in Los Angeles who finds himself partnered with a jaded repossession agent (Stanton) and subsequently caught up in the pursuit for a mysterious car that might be connected to extraterrestrials. The soundtrack is noted as a snapshot of the early-'80s Los Angeles hardcore punk scene of the time.[1] Director Cox wanted the music to serve as a backdrop to the story of the life of the repo men.[2][3]

_Repo Man_ received widespread acclaim, and was considered one of the best films of 1984.[4][5][6] It has achieved cult status.


Plot

In the Mojave Desert, a policeman pulls over a 1964 Chevrolet Malibu driven by Dr. J. Frank Parnell. The policeman opens the trunk, sees a blinding flash of white light, and is instantly vaporized, leaving only his boots behind.

Otto Maddox, a young punk rocker in L.A., is fired from his job as a supermarket stock clerk. His girlfriend leaves him for his best friend. Depressed and broke, Otto is wandering the streets when a man named Bud drives up and offers him $25 to drive a car out of the neighborhood.

Otto follows Bud in the car to the Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation, where he learns that the car he drove was being repossessed. He refuses to join Bud as a "repo man," and goes to his parents' house. He learns that his burned-out ex-hippie parents have donated the money they promised him for finishing school to a crooked televangelist. He decides to take the repo job.

After repossessing a flashy red Cadillac, Otto sees a girl named Leila running down the street. He gives her a ride to her workplace, the United Fruitcake Outlet. On the way, Leila shows Otto pictures of aliens that she says are in the trunk of a Chevy Malibu. She claims that they are dangerous because of the radiation that they emit. Meanwhile, Helping Hand is offered a $20,000 bounty notice for the Malibu. Most assume that the car is drug-related, because the bounty is so far above the actual value of the car.

Parnell arrives in L.A. driving the Malibu, but he is unable to meet his waiting UFO compatriots because of a team of government agents led by a woman with a metal hand. When Parnell pulls into a gas station, Helping Hand's competitors, the Rodriguez brothers, take the Malibu. They stop for sodas because the car's trunk is so hot. While they are out of the car, a trio of Otto's punk friends, who are on a crime spree, steal the Malibu.

After they visit a night club, Parnell appears and tricks the punks into opening the trunk, killing one of them and scaring the other two away. Later, he picks up Otto and drives aimlessly, before collapsing and dying from radiation exposure. Otto takes the Malibu back to Helping Hand and leaves it in the lot. The car is stolen from the lot, and a chase ensues. By this time, the car is glowing bright green.

Eventually, the Malibu reappears at the Helping Hand lot with Bud behind the wheel, but he ends up being shot. The various groups trying to acquire the car soon show up; government agents, the UFO scientists, and the televangelist. Anyone who approaches it bursts into flames, even those in flame-retardant suits. Only Miller, an eccentric mechanic at Helping Hand who had explained earlier to Otto that aliens exist and can travel through time in their spaceships, is able to enter the car. He slides behind the wheel and beckons Otto into the Malibu. After Otto settles into the passenger seat, the Malibu lifts straight up into the air and flies away, first through the city's skyline and later into space, presumably travelling in time.

Reception

_Repo Man_ garnered widespread praise upon its release, and is widely considered to be one of the best films of 1984.[7][8][9] The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 98% approval rating based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "_Repo Man_ is many things: an alien-invasion film, a punk-rock musical, a send-up of consumerism. One thing it isn't is boring."[10] In 2008, the film was voted by a group of _Los Angeles Times_ writers and editors as the eighth-best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years.[11] _Entertainment Weekly_ ranked the film seventh on their list of "The Top 50 Cult Films".[12]

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of a possible 4, and wrote:

Sequels

_Waldo's Hawaiian Holiday_

According to the documentary _A Texas Tale of Treason_, Cox wrote a sequel to _Repo Man_ which, though filming started, was never finished.

Chris Bones saw the script on Cox's website and asked, and received, permission to adapt the script into a graphic novel. The book, _Waldo's Hawaiian Holiday_,[18] was released in March 2008 by Gestalt Publishing.[19]

_Repo Chick_

On December 3, 2008, a sequel was reported to be going into development with the working title _Repo Chick_. The story would be set in 2008 and the resulting boom in repossession that extends far beyond cars and homes.[20] On February 13, 2009, Cox announced on his blog that shooting had finished and the film was in post-production.[21] The bulk of the film was shot in front of a green screen, with backgrounds filmed and composited-in during post-production.[22] Universal sent Cox a cease-and-desist notice because he does not possess the rights to do an official sequel, but he ignored it since his film uses none of the characters from the original. The film premiered on September 8 at the Venice Film Festival. It was released to DVD in the United Kingdom on February 7, 2011, and in North America on the following day.
