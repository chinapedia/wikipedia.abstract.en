DANIEL BATCHELDOR is an Anglo-American astrophysicist, a professor at Florida Institute of Technology, Head of the Department of Aerospace, Physics and Space Sciences, and Director of the Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope.


Early life and education

Daniel Batcheldor was born in Trowbridge in the county of Wiltshire, England. In 1986, his family moved from the village of Holt to village of Bathampton in the county of Somerset. He attended King Edward's School, Bath at Broad Street and North Road, and served in the HQ company of the 6th Battalion Light Infantry Army Reserve (reformed in 2007 to The Rifles) between 1996 and 1999.

In 2000, he served as a student support astronomer at the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes with responsibilities for the Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope.[1] He received a bachelor's degree in Astronomy with Honors from the University of Hertfordshire in 2001, and in 2004 he completed his Ph.D. at the same institution under the direction of David Axon.


Career

In 2004, Batcheldor moved to a research position at Rochester Institute of Technology where he also taught Physics. In 2010, he moved to a faculty position at Florida Institute of Technology and became the Director of the Olin Observatory.[2]

In 2014, he became Head of the Department of Physics and Space Sciences at Florida Institute of Technology.,[3] which in 2018 became the Department of Aerospace, Physics and Space Sciences.


Contributions

Astrophysics

Batcheldor is a leading expert in the field of supermassive black holes and their relationships with galaxies. His scientific accomplishments include the quantification of selection effects in the _M_–_σ_ relation.,[4] the demonstration of low signal-to-noise data in published supermassive black holes mass estimates as well as comparative supermassive black holes mass measurements,[5][6] and the discovery of a spatially offset supermassive black hole in the galaxy Messier 87.[7][8]

Instrumentation

Batcheldor led the efforts to calibrate the NICMOS instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope to enable imaging polarimetry at the level of 1%.[9][10]

In 2012 he began efforts to bring back to operational status the 1.0-m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope that had been taken out of service in 2003. This facility is now a remote observatory operated by the _Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy_ (SARA).[11] Batcheldor is the principal investigator for the SpectraCAM charge injection device payload that was tested on the NanoRacks External Platform on the International Space Station.[12][13]

Outreach

Batcheldor is a proponent of improving the scientific literacy of the general public. He is author of _Astronomy Saves the World: Securing our Future Through Exploration and Education_ (, ) that advocates for the introduction of astronomy as part of the core K-12 curriculum.
