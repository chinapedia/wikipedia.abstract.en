The 37TH CURTIS CUP MATCH was played from 8 to 10 June 2012 at Nairn Golf Club in Nairn, Scotland. Great Britain and Ireland won 10½ to 9½.[1]


Format

The contest was a three-day competition, with three foursomes and three fourball matches on each of the first two days, and eight singles matches on the final day, a total of 20 points.

Each of the 20 matches is worth one point in the larger team competition. If a match is all square after the 18th hole extra holes are not played. Rather, each side earns ½ a point toward their team total. The team that accumulates at least 10½ points wins the competition. In the event of a tie, the current holder retains the Cup.


Teams

Eight players for the Great Britain & Ireland and USA participated in the event plus one non-playing captain for each team.

The Great Britain & Ireland team was selected by the Selection Panel of the LGU in March 2012.[2]
