The 2017 UEFA WOMEN'S CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL was the final match of the 2016–17 UEFA Women's Champions League, the 16th season of Europe's premier women's club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the eighth season since it was renamed from the UEFA Women's Cup to the UEFA Women's Champions League. It was played at the Cardiff City Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, on 1 June 2017, between two French sides Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain.

Lyon won the final 7–6 on penalties after a goalless draw, giving them their fourth title, equalling Frankfurt's record, and became the first team to retain the title twice.[1]

Venue

The Cardiff City Stadium was announced as the final venue on 30 June 2015, following the decision of the UEFA Executive Committee meeting in Prague, Czech Republic to award the men's and women's Champions League finals to Cardiff.[2]


Background

The final was the first all-French final and the first featuring teams from the same country since two German teams met in the 2006 final, as well as the first not to feature German teams since the 2007 final and the first ever not to feature either German or Swedish teams.[3]

This was Lyon's sixth final after winning in 2011, 2012 and 2016 and losing in 2010 and 2013, while this was Paris Saint-Germain's second final after losing in 2015.
