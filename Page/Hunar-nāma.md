_HUNAR-NĀMA_ ('the book of excellence', also transliterated _Honarnāme_) is a 487-distich Persian _mathnavī_ poem composed by ‘Uthmān Mukhtārī at Tabas in the period 500-508 (1105-13 CE), when he was at the court of Seljuqs in Kirmān. The poem is dedicated to the ruler of Tabas, Yamīn al-Dowla (aka Ḥisām ad-Dīn Yamīn ad-Dowla Shams al-Ma‘ālī Abū ’l-Muẓaffar Amīr Ismā‘īl Gīlakī, and can be read as a 'letter of application' demonstrating Mukhtārī's skill as a court poet.[1] It has been characterised as 'perhaps the most interesting of the poems dedicated to Gīlākī'.[2]

The poem is unique among _mathnavī_s for portraying a young poet being tested, not by a more senior poet as in other medieval Persian poems, but by an astrologer. Moreover, is also unique for including a series of riddles (ten in all) on the spiritual, intellectual, and military ideals for a king.[3] These in turn have a distinctive structure: each has ten distichs posing ethical questions, followed by two distichs in which the poet delivers his answers.[4] The riddles in particular serve to showcase Mukhtārī's virtuosity in poetic description. The poem is also among the earliest to have been written in the _khafīf_ metre.[5]


Contents

The poem begins of a cosmological survey, which descends from heaven to earth before culminating in praise of God and his Prophet. The second half of the poem narrates the reverse process: the striving of the poet's persona to proceed from a mundane existence to spiritual perfection. He achieves this by going on a journey and meeting an atrologer, who tests his wisdom with riddles

Sources and influences

Though rather different, the _Hunar-nāma_ may have drawn some inspiration from the _Rowshanā’ī-namā_ by Nāṣir-i Khusrow (d. 1075). It may in turn have inspired Sanā’ī's _Ḥadīqat al-ḥaqīqa_, _Seyr al-‘ibād_, and _Kār-nāma_.[7] The testing of the poet's wisdom recalls similar tests of young men's wits in Persian epic and romance texts such as _Khosrow ud Redak_, Asadī's _Garshāsp-nāma_, and Firdow's _Shāh-nāma_.[8]
