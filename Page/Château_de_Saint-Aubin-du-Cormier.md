History

In 1225, Peter I, Duke of Brittany ordered the construction of a castle.[2] The enceinte is quadrilateral and measures 100m by 30m with ten towers.

After the death of king Louis VIII, Peter I changed allegiance and fought for King Henry III of England. The French army under orders from Louis IX unsuccessfully attempted a siege in 1231, but Peter handed over the in 1234 when he submitted to the king of France.

During the War of Breton Succession, the castle was taken by Charles de Blois in 1342 before it was handed over to Jean IV de Montfort in 1381. The castle was remodelled in 1430 and at the same time ramparts were built around the town.

The castle was dismantled in 1490 and abandoned.
