Zabivaka_(mascot).jpg ZABIVAKA (, "Goalscorer") was the official mascot of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which was held in Russia. The name is a blend of the Russian words забияка ("hothead") and забивать ("to score").

The mascot was selected by internet voting in Russia, and its author is student designer Ekaterina Bocharova.[1]


Design

The mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016. It represents an anthropomorphic Eurasian wolf (_Canis lupus lupus_) with brown and white fur, wearing a T shirt emblazoned with the words "RUSSIA 2018" and orange goggles — according to the designer, these are not ski goggles, but sports goggles like those used in cycling: "Zabivaka is so fast on the field that he needs eye protection".[2]

The combination of white, blue and red T shirt and shorts are the national colours of the Russian team.


Competition

The competition results were announced on 22 October 2016, in the _Evening Urgant_ on the Channel One Russia. The Wolf, named Zabivaka, scored 53% of the votes, ahead of the Tiger (27%) and the Cat (20%). More than one million people participated in the voting, which took place during September 2016 at FIFA.com, as well as before an during the live show of the _Evening Urgant_, where the results of the competition were announced.[3]

The name was suggested at the show by the chairman of the World Cup 2018 Organising Committee Vitali Mutko. FIFA paid Bocharova a meager sum of $500.[4]
