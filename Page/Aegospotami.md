AEGOSPOTAMI () or AEGOSPOTAMOS[1] (i.e. _Goat Streams_) is the ancient Greek name for a small river issuing into the Hellespont (Modern Turkish _Çanakkale Boğazı_), northeast of Sestos.[2]

At its mouth was the scene of the decisive battle in 405 BC in which Lysander destroyed the Athenian fleet, ending the Peloponnesian War.[3][4] The ancient Greek township of the same name, whose existence is attested by coins of the 5th and 4th centuries,[5] and the river itself were located in ancient Thrace in the Chersonese.[6]

According to ancient sources including Pliny the Elder and Aristotle, in 467 BC a large meteorite landed near Aegospotami. It was described as brown in colour and the size of a wagon load; it was a local landmark for more than 500 years. A comet, tentatively identified as Halley's Comet, was reported at the time the meteorite landed. This is possibly the first European record of Halley's comet.[7][8]

Aegospotami is located on the Dardanelles, northeast of the modern Turkish town of Sütlüce, Gelibolu.[9]
