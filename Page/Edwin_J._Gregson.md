EDWIN J. GREGSON (August 7, 1938 â€“ June 4, 2000) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse trainer. He was the trainer of Gato Del Sol who won the 1982 Kentucky Derby.

He died on June 4, 2000, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.[1] In his honor, a charitable institution founded by the association of California Thoroughbred Trainers (CTT) designed to "enhance the quality of life of California's backstretch workers and their families" was renamed the Edwin J. Gregson Foundation.[2]
