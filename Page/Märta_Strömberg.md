Märta_Strömberg_2010.jpg MÄRTA STRÖMBERG (1921 – 2012) was a Swedish archaeologist.


Life and work

Märta Strömberg was one of the first female archaeologists to enter the academic realm in Sweden. She began her career as a researcher at Lund University and stayed her entire professional career at the same university. She continued to work sporadically at the university also after her retirement. She has been described as one of the foremost experts in Nordic prehistory in Sweden, but had a broad base of knowledge and expertise stretching from knowledge about the Stone Age to the Middle Ages. Her research was based on a systems theory approach and focused on explaining social and economic structures by studying patterns of settlements in the landscape within a very long time frame.¨[1]
