Premise

_Da Jammies_ centers around a group of kids that are friends who attend a performing arts school where they struggle to balance real-life issues with their dreams of making it as entertainers. The co-leader "Dolla" (William "Dolla" Chapman II) is known as the "quick tempered, rapping, dancer", who believes that Da Jammies do not practice enough and seems to have a short fuse with his bandmates. However that is all balanced out with the co-leader of the group "Novelist" (Aulsondro "Novelist" Hamilton) the "peace keeping, rapping best friend" who always have a solution for the crews success. The rest of the members of Da Jammies are "Momo" (Alisa Reyes) the "one with the universe" earthy poet with a bubbly personality, then there's "LaLa" (Dani Nicolet) the "Singing Diva" who believes in no one but herself that can sometimes be very rude and unapologetic without realizing it. Then there is "Seven" (Anderson Johnson Jr.) the "soulful crooner" that is alway trying to be helpful and has two loves in his life, "LaLa" and food.

Everyday Da Jammies take on issues that plagues the youth, from "Homelessness", to "Bullying", to "Self-Awareness", to "Obesity"and the real meaning of friends and more, the underlying premise of the show is "unity" and "doing it together" although their non-talented nemesis "The Battlebrats" whose leaders "Mike Fresh" (Kel Mitchell) and "Smalls" (Shane Tsurugi) are constantly seeking ways to out do "Da Jammies" and most time failing.
