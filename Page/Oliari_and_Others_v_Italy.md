Background

The ECtHR previously held in _Schalk and Kopf v Austria_ (2010) that the Convention does not oblige member states to open marriage to same-sex couples, but if there is a different type of partnership scheme, same-sex couples may not be excluded per _Vallianatos and Others v Greece_ (2013).

Same-sex marriage is not legal in Italy, nor did it at the time of the case provide any other type of recognition for either opposite-sex or same-sex couples, being the last major Western European county not to do so.

The applicants were six Italian men (three same-sex couples) who submitted their cases in 2011 after Italian courts rejected their application to marry.


Judgment

The Court held that Italy violated Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights ("Right to respect for private and family life") with the lack of legal recognition of same-sex relationships.

In the review of relevant law, the Court also referenced _Obergefell v. Hodges_, a United States Supreme Court ruling legalising same-sex marriage, which was published just a few days before the ECtHR deliberated in _Oliari and Others v Italy_.

However, the ECtHR found that, despite the evolution of states in favour of legalising same-sex marriage, there is no violation of Article 12 (right to marry) and thus confirmed its previous ruling in _Schalk and Kopf v Austria_ (2010).


Consequences

In 2016, Italy implemented a civil union law, open to same-sex couples.
