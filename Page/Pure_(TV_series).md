_PURE_ is a Canadian television drama series that first aired on CBC Television in January and February 2017,[1] and subsequently on Super Channel. The show stars Ryan Robbins as Noah Funk, a Mennonite pastor working undercover within an organized crime network in order to clean up a drug trafficking problem in his community.[2] The show also stars A. J. Buckley, Peter Outerbridge, Alex Paxton-Beesley, and Rosie Perez.[3]

_Pure_ is produced by Two East Productions and Cineflix Media[4] and is directed by Ken Girotti.[5]

Showrunner Michael Amo stated that he pitched the show to television networks in the 2000s but "didn't get any takers".[6] It is inspired by the operations of a Mennonite organized crime ring that smuggled cocaine and marijuana from Mexico to Canada and the United States.[7][8]

The series premiere was watched by 858,000 Canadian viewers.[9] On April 12, 2017, the show was picked up by Hulu in the United States.[10] WGN America acquired the US television rights to the series in August 2017.[11]

Initially, _Pure_ was not renewed for a second season;[12][13] however, in April 2018 the show was picked up by Super Channel, CBC, Hulu, and WGN America for a season two with six episodes, set to premiere in 2019.[14][15] The series is scheduled to debut on WGN America on May 28, 2019.[16]
