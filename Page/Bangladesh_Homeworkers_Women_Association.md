BANGLADESH HOMEWORKERS WOMEN ASSOCIATION, also known as BHWA, is a NGO, headquartered in Dhaka, Bangladesh.[1] It is mostly known for working with the underprivileged homeworkers, also known as home-based workers by initiating social awareness programs, advocacy workshops, originating policy drafts, development and recommendation.[2] BHWA focuses on key issues such as elimination of child labour,[3] women worker's rights in the informal sector, occupational health and safety for women workers who are not covered by the Labour Code in Bangladesh.

In 2003, The Ministry of Labour and Employment of Bangladesh registered BHWA as a Trade Union, making it the first NGO representing workers in the informal sector to be granted a trade union status by the GOVERNMENT OF BANGLADESH. This enabled homeworkers to seek basic worker rights using this platform.[4][5]

The organization was founded in 1986, by General Secretary, DILRUBA ANGURI.[6][7] BHWA has over 14,000 members across 5 districts in Bangladesh (1999).[8]
