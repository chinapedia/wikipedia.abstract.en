HYALADHERINS, also known as HYALURONAN-BINDING PROTEINS, are proteins capable of binding to hyaluronic acid. Most hyaladherins belong to the Link module superfamily, including its main receptor CD44, hyalectans and TSG-6.[1] In addition there is a diverse group of hyaladherins lacking a Link module; these include the receptor RHAMM, C1QBP (HABP1) and HABP2.[2] The primary roles of hyaladherins are cell adhesion, structural support of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell signalling.[3]

Due to the role of aberrant hyaluronic acid synthesis and degradation in various cancers, hyaladherins, as well as hyaluronic acid, are considered a promising target for cancer therapy.[4]
