Synopsis

In the tiny town of Babylon, Florida, sixteen-year-old Margaret Larkin (Sara Catherine Bellamy) goes missing, only to be found murdered and thrown in the river, tied to her own bicycle. The town is enveloped by the mystery of a killer in their midst; meanwhile, the killer himself, Nathan Redfield (Josh Stewart), sociopathic son of a prominent town banker (Christopher Lloyd), proceeds with his scheme to murder the rest of the Larkin family in order for the bank to acquire the Larkin's valuable, petroleum-rich property. Nathan additionally schemes to pin blame for the murders on the high school principal (Marcus Lyle Brown). The Larkin family members, however, return from the grave to exact revenge against Nathan, although he is the only one who can see these phantasms. Nathan's seeming hallucinations and drinking escalate until he finally snaps and gets his comeuppance.
