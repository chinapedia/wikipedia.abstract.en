19-NOR-5-ANDROSTENEDIONE, also known as ESTR-5-ENE-3,17-DIONE, is a synthetic, orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and a derivative of 19-nortestosterone (nandrolone) that was never introduced for medical use.[1][2][3] It is an androgen prohormone of nandrolone and of other 19-norandrostanes.[4][5][6]

19-Nor-5-androstenedione, 19-nor-5-androstenediol, and other 19-norandrostane prohormones were considered to be nutritional supplements and were sold over-the-counter in the United States as a result of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA).[7][8] However, they were banned from sports in 1999 by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and are currently on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list of prohibited substances.[9] In 2004, they became controlled substances in the U.S. as a result of the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004.[10]
