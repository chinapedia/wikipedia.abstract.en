IVAN PEŠIĆ (born 6 April 1992 in Šibenik, Croatia) is a Croatian football player, currently playing for Shakhter Karagandy, on loan from Romanian club Dinamo București.[1]


Club career

Pešić started his youth career in NK Oluja, the club from his native village of Čista Velika.[2] At the age of 12, he moved to the seaside NK Vodice for two seasons before moving on to the HNK Hajduk Split youth setup.[3] A youth U-19 international,[4] he remained at the club in his first senior year, but featured only in friendlies and a single Croatian Football Cup match, against Jadran Gunja.[5] Released at the end of the season, he moved to Austria Klagenfurt, but after a single youth team and state cup match, he returned to Croatia, this time to HNK Šibenik in the Druga HNL.

Pešić's fledgling career was brought to a temporary halt by a traffic accident.[6] After only 9 matches in the year and a half at Šibenik, Pešić had moved on to the Prva HNL team NK Zadar in early 2014.[7] However, due to inflammation of his pubic bone, Pešić played in only 2 matches until the end of the season.

However, Pešić became a first-team regular the following (2014/15) season, under coach Miroslav Blažević.[8] He would go on to amass four goals and eight assists[9] from his preferred left wing position.[10] This resulted in his transfer to RNK Split, having earned the reputation as one of the quickest players in the league.[11]

After his club's relegation in the summer of 2017, Pešić rejoined HNK Hajduk Split.[12]
