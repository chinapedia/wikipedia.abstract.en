NGC 276 is a barred spiral galaxy located approximately 626 million light-years from the Solar System[1] in the constellation Cetus. It was discovered in 1886 by Frank Muller and was later also observed by DeLisle Stewart.[2]

John Dreyer, creator of the New General Catalogue describes the object as "extremely faint, pretty small, extended 265°, 11 magnitude star 3 arcmin to north". The galaxy's right ascension was later corrected in the Index Catalogue using the observation data by Stewart.[3]
