FRANÇOIS-AMILCAR ARAN (12 July 1817, in Bordeaux – 22 February 1861, in Paris) was a French physician.

He studied medicine in Bordeaux and received his doctorate in Paris with a thesis on heart palpitations. In Paris he subsequently became a hospital physician and a professor agrégé. He worked as a deputy physician to Léon Louis Rostan at the Hôtel-Dieu, where he held popular clinical lectures. He also distinguished himself in his work performed at the Hôpital Saint-Antoine.[1]

With Duchenne de Boulogne, the eponymous "Aran-Duchenne spinal muscular atrophy" is named. Aran first described the disease in an article titled _Recherches sur une maladie non encore décrit du systéme musculaire (atrophie musculaire progressive)_ (1850).[2]

He was known for his translation of foreign works, he translated James Henry Bennett’s _Practical Treatise on Inflammation of the Uterus and Its Appendages and on the Connexion with other Uterine Diseases_ as _Traité pratique de l'inflammation de l'utérus_, and Joseph Skoda’s _Abhandlung über Perkussion und Auskultation_ as _Traité de percussion et d’auscultation_ (1854).[3] Aran's _Manuel pratique des maladies du coeur et des gros vaisseaux_ (1842) was later translated into English and published as _Practical manual of the diseases of the heart and great vessels_ (1843).
