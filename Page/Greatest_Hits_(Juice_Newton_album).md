Overview

_Juice_

Juice Newton began her recording career in 1975 and made five albums over the next four years without achieving any major success. Her breakthrough came in 1981 with _Juice_, an album that reach number 22 on the Billboard 200 chart and number 16 on the Canadian Top 50 album chart.[1][2] _Juice_ was certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) as gold on August 13, 1981 and platinum on January 5, 1982.[3] The album also gave Newton three hit singles, beginning with "Angel of the Morning". The song, written by Chip Taylor, had been a number one hit for Merrilee Rush in 1968.[4] Newton's version peaked at number four on the pop charts and number 22 on the country charts.[5][6]

Her second single from the album, "Queen of Hearts", reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 14 on the country charts.[7] It used the same arrangement that Dave Edmunds used on his version of the song on his 1979 album _Repeat When Necessary_.[8][9] "Angel of the Morning" and "Queen of Hearts" were certified Gold by the RIAA, respectively, on July 1 and September 2, 1981.[10] The final single from _Juice_ was "The Sweetest Thing (I've Ever Known)", a song written by Newton's long-time collaborator, Otha Young. It was her biggest hit to date, peaking at number one on the country chart and number seven the pop chart.[11] Newton had recorded the song earlier on her debut album _Juice Newton & Silver Spur_ (1975).[12]

_Quiet Lies_ and _Dirty Looks_

Newton followed up _Juice_ with _Quiet Lies_ (1982), another hit album that reached number 20 on the Billboard 200.[13] It was certified Gold by the RIAA on July 16, 1982.[14] This album also had three singles released from its track line up. The first hit, "Love's Been a Little Bit Hard on Me", reached number 7 on the Billboard pop chart, number 30 on the Country chart, and number 2 on the Adult Contemporary chart.[15] It brought Newton a Grammy nomination for Pop Female Vocalist.[16] The second, "Break It to Me Gently", had been a hit for Brenda Lee in 1962 when it reached number 4 on the Billboard 100.[17] Newton's version reached number 11 on the pop chart and number 2 on the country chart.[18] It also won her the Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Female.[19] The final single from _Quiet Lies_ was "In the Heart of the Night". It reached number 4 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart and number 25 on the Hot 100.[20]

Newton's next album, _Dirty Looks_ (1983), was not as successful as _Juice_ and _Quiet Lies_. However, it sold well enough in Canada to be certified Gold on October 1, 1983, by the Canadian Music Industry.[21] The three singles released from this album were "Tell Her No", "Dirty Looks", and "Stranger at My Door". The first two peaked on the pop chart at, respectively, numbers 27 and 90. The third peaked on the country chart at 45.[22] "Tell Her No" was a reworking of The Zombies 1965 hit, which had reached number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100.[23]

Compiling _Greatest Hits_

Juice Newton's _Greatest Hits_ album was originally released by Capitol Records in 1984. Five of the ten tracks that appeared on the album were from _Juice_. These were the three singles, "Angel of the Morning", "Queen of Hearts", and "The Sweetest Thing", plus two album tracks, "Ride 'Em, Cowboy" and "Shot Full of Love". Four tracks from _Quiet Lies_ were included, consisting of its three singles, "Love's Been a Little Bit Hard on Me", "Break it to Me Gently" and "In the Heart of the Night", plus an album track, "I'm Gonna Be Strong".[24] Only "Tell Her No" was taken from _Dirty Looks_. "I'm Gonna Be Strong" was written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil and had been a top ten hit for Gene Pitney in 1965.[25] "Ride 'Em, Cowboy" was released as a single from _Greatest Hits_ and reached number 32 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.[26]

On November 14, 1986, Capitol reissue Newton's _Greatest Hits_ in an expanded 15-track edition titled '' Juice Newton's Greatest Hits (and more)''.[27] This version retained nine of the album's original tracks. "Ride 'Em, Cowboy" was dropped and six new tracks were brought in. The title track from _Dirty Looks_ was among these along with five songs from her pre-_Juice_ recordings. "Low Down and Lonesome" derived from Newton's 1977 _Come to Me_ album while "So Many Ways" and "Hey! Baby" came from her 1978 release _Well Kept Secret_. The last of these was a cover version of Bruce Channel's 1962 number one hit.[28] "Lay Back in the Arms of Someone", taken from Newton's _Take Heart_ 1979 album, was originally recorded by the British band Smokie.[29] "It's a Heartache" was included in only foreign issues of Newton's _Come to Me_ album but not in the American and British editions. Released as a one-off single in 1978, Newton's rendition of this song was a major hit in Mexico. In the United States it peaked at only number 86 and was eclipsed by Bonnie Tyler's version of the song which shot up to number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.[30][31]
