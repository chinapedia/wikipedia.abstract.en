MÍCHEÁL Ó CRÓINÍN (born 1977) is an Irish retired Gaelic footballer and current sports broadcaster. His league and championship career with the Cork senior team spanned seven seasons from 1999 to 2005.[1]

Born in Baile Bhúirne, County Cork, Ó Cróinín was introduced to Gaelic football by his father, a former chairman of the local club. He began his club career as a centre-back with the Naomh Abán under-21 team before eventually progressing onto the senior team with whom he won a county intermediate championship medal. While studying at University College Cork Ó Cróinín won a set of Munster and county senior championship medals in 1999.

Ó Cróinín made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he was picked on the Cork minor team. He enjoyed two championship seasons with the minor team, before later joining the under-21 side, however, he ended his underage career with championship success. Ó Cróinín made his senior debut during the 1998-99 league. Over the course of the next seven seasons, Ó Cróinín established himself as a key player for Cork and won two Munster medals and one National Football League medal. He played his last game for Cork in July 2005.

In retirement from playing Ó Cróinín has forged a media career as a co-commentator and analyst with TG4's Irish language Gaelic games show _GAA Beo_.[2] His wife, Nollaig Cleary, is a nine-time All-Ireland medal winner with Cork.[3]
