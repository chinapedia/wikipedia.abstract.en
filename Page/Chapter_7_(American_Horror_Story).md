Plot

In the production trailer, Sidney watches the footage of Dominic's arrival to the house and his fight with Matt. When Sidney's cameraman noticed Rory's murder by the Jane sisters' ghosts onscreen, he tries to bring the producer's attention to replay the footage but before the cameraman could do so, the latter and Sidney hear the screams of a production assistant's murder outside the trailer. When they investigate, Sidney and the cameraman are murdered by a crazed Agnes who has just arrived on the set, acting as the Butcher, and she steals the camera. After entering the storm cellar, Agnes is startled by the ghosts inside who string wooden totems around her.

Inside the Roanoke house, the actors deny Matt's claim of Rory's fate and, when the participants search through the house, they find that Rory's body has disappeared from inside the bathroom. The second day before the second night shift of the Blood Moon, after rejecting Dominic's sexual advances in the kitchen, Shelby is attacked by Agnes who severely injures her shoulder inside the bedroom, but Dominic arrives and stops Agnes who manages to escape before she could kill Shelby. While Audrey and Dominic tend to Shelby's wounds, Lee informs the group that all the phone lines have been cut when she tried to contact help. During a brief argument, Lee decides to venture outside with Audrey and Monet to find Sidney's trailer, arming herself with her gun, while Dominic and Matt stay in the house with Shelby.

When they venture through the passage, they're confronted by Mott's ghost, obliging the women to flee into the woods. As night falls, they arrive and witness the aftermath of the massacre outside the trailer on set. While the women look for a way to reach for help, Agnes appears and lunges after them but Lee pulls out her gun and shoots her in the shoulder. The real ghosts of the Roanoke colony appear, forcing the group to hide in the woods. After finding Rory’s corpse hanging from a tree, Lee, Audrey, and Monet are abducted by the real Polk family and taken into the Polk compound. The deformed family begins to torture the women by force-feeding the actresses human flesh that they cut from Lee's leg.

Back at the house, Scathach once again manipulates Matt to engage in their sexual activity in the basement. After Dominic and Shelby arrive, the latter attacks and drives Scathach away with a crowbar. Matt absurdly confesses his affair with the witch as his reason for returning. Infuriated by his alleged betrayal, Shelby bashes Matt's head repeatedly with a crowbar, killing him. She becomes hysterical, regretting having murdered her husband. Outside, Agnes screams as Thomasin and threatens the group while the ghosts of the Roanoke settlers, including the real Thomasin, surround her. Shelby and Dominic are forced to watch from the upper view as the Butcher thrusts her cleaver into Agnes' head, killing her.
