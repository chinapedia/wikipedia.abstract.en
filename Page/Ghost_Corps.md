GHOST CORPS, INC. is an American production company formed in March 2015 to oversee the _Ghostbusters_ franchise.


History

The company was formed in March 2015 by Sony Pictures Entertainment in order to create a Ghostbusters cinematic universe and expand the Ghostbusters brand into films, television series and merchandise. The company is headed by Ivan Reitman and Dan Aykroyd along with Reitman's Montecito Picture Company partners Tom Pollock, Ali Bell and Alex Plapinger.[1][2]


Projects

The company's first project was a live-action film with a male-oriented cast that was planned to be produced and released after the female-lead 2016 _Ghostbusters_ film. The film was to have been produced by Channing Tatum, Reid Carolin and Peter Kiernan, with a script written by Drew Pearce, but was later cancelled.[3][4][5]

Its second project, an animated series called _Ghostbusters: Ecto Force_, was announced on June 20 2016 and was planned for a 2018 debut. The series focuses on a new team of Ghostbusters in the year 2050 who capture ghosts from around the world.[6][7] Reitman revealed in August 2017 that the series had been postponed to prioritize development on the planned Ghostbusters animated feature.[8]

Its third project, a sequel called Ghostbusters 2020 taking place in the original timeline set by the first two films, thus ignoring the 2016 reboot, has been announced by Sony Pictures and Ghost Corps. Jason Reitman, Ivan Reitman's son, has been confirmed to direct, and a teaser trailer was released on January 15th, 2019. [9]
