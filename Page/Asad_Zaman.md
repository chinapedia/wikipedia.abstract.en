Philosophy

Zaman has radical views on Econometrics and Islamic Economics. For a long time, Zaman has been praising David F. Hendry's methodology of econometric modeling known as general to simple methodology. His recent writings criticise Hendry for being 'nominalist' as opposed to his own views which he names as 'realist' econometrics. The Hendry's general to simple methodology advocates data based decision making in econometrics starting from a general methodology as a solution to problem of mismatch between an estimated model and reality. Zaman says that when there is conflict in data and reality, one should go into the field to find the reasons for the mismatch.

Zaman is a vocal critique of western methodology of social sciences. He says that the western social sciences pretend to be positive but in fact there is a normative background behind every theory an concept of social sciences. For example, utility maximization provides the basis for development of economics and it is believed that the utility maximization has nothing to do with norms. But Zaman argues that the utility maximization is also a norm.

Zaman is of the view that social sciences should be built around Islamic principals.
