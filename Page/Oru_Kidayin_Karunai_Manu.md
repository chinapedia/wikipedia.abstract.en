Production

In July 2015, it was reported that director Manikandan' assistant Suresh Sangaiah had written a script titled _Oru Kidayin Karunai Manu_ and was considering making it into a feature film. Later in February 2016, it was announced that Vidharth would work on the film.[4][5] The film was officially launched in April 2016, with Eros International coming on board as the film's producers.[6] Raveena Ravi, who had previously worked in films as a dubbing artiste, was auditioned for the lead female role in early 2016 and was selected to make her acting debut.[7] The director revealed "the plot revolves around the ritual of offering goats to Gods and present things from the point of view of a goat". The film progressed in Aruppukottai from April to May 2016, before the team moved on to shoot scenes in Rajapalayam.[8]

In late 2016, the team sent the film to the organisers of the Berlin Film Festival for consideration for a possible screening.[9] With a run time of just 2 hours and 1 minute, the film leaves a lasting impression on us. It conveys the message that it intended, but nothing goes overboard and things are never preachy. And that makes OKKM far better than its counterparts in the recent times.[10]


Reception
