The 1875 CAVERSHAM BY-ELECTION was a by-election held on 20 August 1875 during the 5th New Zealand Parliament in the Caversham electorate in the south-east of the South Island.

The by-election was held because of the death of sitting member of parliament William Tolmie.

The election saw Robert Stout narrowly win the seat by just twenty-one votes over his sole opponent, William Larnach. Both were new to the political arena with neither having stood for Parliament before.
