Harvard_stadium_2009h.JPG in Allston hosts college football games.]] Harvard University is undergoing a major expansion in Allston, Massachusetts. The Harvard Business School and many of the university's athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located on a campus in Allston,[1] a Boston neighborhood across the Charles River from the Cambridge campus. The John W. Weeks Bridge, a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River, connects the two campuses. Intending a major expansion, Harvard now owns more land in Allston than it does in Cambridge.[2] A ten-year plan[3] calls for 1.4Â million square feet (130,000 square meters) of new construction and 500,000 square feet (50,000 square meters) of renovations, including new and renovated buildings at Harvard Business School; a hotel and conference center; a multipurpose institutional building; renovations to graduate student housing and to Harvard Stadium; new athletic facilities; new laboratories and classrooms for the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences; expansion of the Harvard Education Portal; and a district energy facility.
