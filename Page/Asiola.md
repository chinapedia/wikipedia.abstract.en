ASIOLA is an online crowdfunding platform built to support creative and community-driven ideas in Thailand.[1] It was launched in 2015 in Bangkok by a group of founders comprising technology experts, music industry experts and artists in response to Thailand's burgeoning startup scene. Their aim was to provide a way for fledgling ideas to gather attention and get funded.[2]

Asiola's vision is to provide a platform for ideas worth supporting and connect creators of ideas with an audience. Supporters receive rewards in return for their contribution towards a campaign's funding goal and if a campaign is successful, rewards are delivered and the campaign is executed.[3] Asiola welcomes ideas that are innovative and have potential to make a positive impact on communities in Thailand.


Founders

Asiola was founded by an international team[4] including:marketing specialist Jon Lor (CEO), Sanji Tandan - former managing director of Warner Music, IT specialist Chris Hwang (CTO), social entrepreneur Pranitan "Pete" Phornprapha, Thai musician Montonn "Jay" Jira and Khanngoen "Khan" Nuanual of Thai rap group, Thaitanium.


Model

Currently, Asiola operates on a rewards-based crowdfunding model, where funds are raised for a project by supporters who invest in an idea that inspires them by pledging a contribution in return for a reward. These can be tangible products or items, or intangible rewards like services or, in the case of community-driven campaigns, a sense of being part of something worthwhile.[5] There are two types of campaigns: all-or-nothing and unconditional.

All-or-nothing campaigns

These are campaigns that must reach their funding goal within the allotted time period. If they do not reach their target before the campaign deadline, the project is not funded, supporters do not get charged and do not receive their rewards.

Unconditional campaigns

Any and all funding raised towards an unconditional campaign goes to the campaign creator and supporters receive their rewards after the campaign deadline, whether or not the campaign reached its funding target.[6]

The founders cite plans to expand the model to incorporate equity-based crowdfunding in the future.[7]


Launch

The official launch of Asiola took place on 24 November 2015 and featured panel discussions from the team of founders, Khun Teeranun Srihong, President of Kasikorn Bank.[8]
