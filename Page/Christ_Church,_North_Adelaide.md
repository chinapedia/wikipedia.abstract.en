CHRIST CHURCH, NORTH ADELAIDE is an Anglican church consecrated in 1849.[1] The Foundation Stone was laid in 1848 by Augustus Short, first Bishop of Adelaide. Christ Church was the pro-cathedral until 1877 when St Peter's Cathedral opened.


The building

The building is in the Romanesque architectural style and was built under the direction of architects Henry Stuckey and William Weir. It is built of local limestone mined from Palmer Place, with slate roof tiles from Willunga.[2] In 1855 the nave was extended on the western side by some .[3]

The church, rectory and hall are all heritage listed with the former two appearing on the South Australian Heritage Register and the latter appearing on a 'local' list maintained by the City of Adelaide.[4][5][6]

Organ

The church's first instrument was a harmonium, replaced in 1854 by the pipe organ from J. B. Graham's mansion Prospect House ("Graham's Castle"),[7] and opened by George Bennett,[8] one of his last performances.[9] The new acquisition was heavily criticised,[10] then refurbished and greatly enlarged the following year.[11] It was later installed in the Norwood Baptist Church.[12]


Liturgy

Worship in the church follows the Book of Common Prayer.
