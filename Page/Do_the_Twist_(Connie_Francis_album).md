_DO THE TWIST!_ is a studio album recorded in late 1961/early 1962 by U. S. Entertainer Connie Francis. It was released in early 1962 on MGM Records. Later that same year it was repackackaged and re-released under a new title, _Dance Party_.[1]


The album

When the Twist became the biggest dance phenomenon of 1961, many artists recorded Twist-themed singles and albums, usually as a quickly produced rush releases as the audiences's tastes in current dances changed very fast. Some of the follow-up dances to the Twist were the Mashed Potato or the Pony.

For her own Twist album, Francis recorded a total of seventeen songs, most of them written by Eddie Curtis who had also written Francis' 1959 recording _You're Gonna Miss Me_. Most of his works for this album were new songs, the exception being _Mommy, You're Daughter's Fallin' in Love_, which used the tune of Winfield Scott's _Tweedlee Dee_. Here, Curtis only provided new lyrics.

The sessions were arranged and conducted by Sammy Lowe and held on November 20, 1961 and on January 4, 8 and 9, 1962 in New York City.[2][3]

The album was originally released in January 1962 shortly after the last recording session under the title _Do The Twist!_. It was released in both mono and stereo, both editions containing the song _Does ol' Broadway ever sleep_ in versions with differently mixed street noises at the intro.[4] It was shipped to record stores in a simple black cover with the title written on it in large neon green colored letters, very similar to Ray Charles' _Do The Twist!_ album from 1961. The UK version of the album sported the letters in neon red.

In July 1962, the album was repackaged with a new cover design and was re-released under the new title _Dance Party_.[5]


Single releases, foreign language versions and unreleased songs

The album's opening track, _Mr. Twister_ (not to be confused with the Chubby Checker song of the same name), was released in several territories outside the U. S. as a 45 rpm single. Francis herself recorded the song also in Italian, French, Japanese and Spanish. It is also one of only two songs Francis ever recorded in Swedish.[6]

_Kiss 'n' Twist (Kissin' Twist)_, with a tune based on the traditional Italian dance Tarantella and lyrics provided by Mike Canosa and Danny Stradella, was also released as a 45 rpm single in several territories. Additionally, Francis recorded a German rendering under the title _Ein Boy für mich_.[7]

_Drop It, Joe_ was released as the flipside to Francis' single _Don't Break the Heart That Loves You_ in January 1962.

_Telephone Lover_ was released in Greece as the flipside to _Mr. Twister_.

_Don't Cry On My Shoulder_ was not released in the United States at all during the 1960s but was a single B-side in several European countries. A German recording under the title _Alle meine Tränen_ was scheduled to be recorded at Austrophon Studios in Vienna on April 13, 1962 during the same session as _Ein Boy für mich_ but this was abandoned due to delays in the busy recording schedule.[8]

_Gonna Git That Man_ was released in April 1962 as the flipside to Francis' single _Second Hand Love_ (MGM Records K 13074, # 9) and later on the compilation Album _Connie Francis sings "Second Hand Love"_ (MGM Records E-/SE-4049) [9][10][11]

The remaining songs _Love Bird_, _Cha Cha Twist_, _Lovey Dovey Twist_ (loosely based on Eddie Curtis's 1954 composition _Lovey Dovey_) and an alternate version of _Mr. Twister_ wouldn't be released until 1996.[12][13][14]
