Career

Acting

Elizabeth appeared in several films and television shows before being cast in 1999's _American Pie_ in the role of Nadia. It was a major box office success. Elizabeth subsequently appeared in several Hollywood films, including _Scary Movie_, _Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back_, and _Tomcats_. Elizabeth starred in the UPN series _Cuts_ until the show was canceled in May 2006. _Cuts_ and its parent show, _One on One_, were two of the many shows not to be picked up by The CW. Elizabeth recurred in _That '70s Show_ for a number of episodes.

In 2000 and 2003, she was featured in _Maxim_.[8] In June 2008 she was _Maxim_'s cover girl. She provided the likeness and voice for Serena St. Germaine in the 2004 video game, _James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing_.[9] Elizabeth was one of the celebrities on an episode of NBC's _Thank God You're Here_ along with Tom Green, Chelsea Handler, and George Takei.

In 2019, Kevin Smith confirmed she will reprise her role as Justice in _Jay and Silent Bob Reboot._ [10]

Poker

National Heads-Up Poker Championship]] In 2006, Elizabeth described poker as her second career and was called "one of the leading celebrity poker players."[11] At that time, she visited the Las Vegas Valley up to three times each month to participate in poker games with top players. Elizabeth does not appear to have been as active a poker player since scoring 12 tournament cashes from 2006 through 2010 – she has only one tournament cash (in 2013) thereafter.[12]

Elizabeth played in the Main Event of the 2005 World Series of Poker under the guidance of Daniel Negreanu, and won a special tournament celebrating the opening of a new poker room at Caesars Palace hotel in January 2006, beating out 83 celebrities and poker professionals to win $55,000.[13] She also cashed four times in the World Series of Poker in 2006 and 2007, but again busted out of the Main Event early. In 2007, she advanced to the semi-finals of the NBC National Heads-Up Poker Championship in a field consisting of the top poker professionals before losing to eventual champion Paul Wasicka.[14]


Personal life

After the September 11 attacks, Elizabeth recorded a public service announcement in which she said, "I'm half Arabic, but I am 100 percent American. What is going on affects me the same as everyone else."[15]

Elizabeth was married to actor Joseph D. Reitman from 2002–2005.[16]

She is an environmentalist and vegan. She is a cousin of New York-based television host and relationship coach Tamsen Fadal.[17]

Charity work

Animal Avengers, a non-profit animal rescue organization founded by Elizabeth and her then-husband Reitman,[18] is dedicated to rescuing and finding a home for homeless pets, reducing pet overpopulation, promoting responsible pet guardianship and preventing animal cruelty. Among the many fundraising events, Team Bodog raised over $50,000 for Animal Avengers in a celebrity poker night on October 8, 2005. The event was hosted by noted tournament director Matt Savage. In 2016, she began participating in numerous other Bodog-sponsored charity events as well.[19] The organization, based in Brazil, lead 3D printing of prosthetic body parts for animals, including a beak for goose Victoria.[20]

Elizabeth has served as the spokesperson for Farm Sanctuary's Adopt a Turkey program, urging people to adopt a turkey instead of eating one for Thanksgiving.[21]

Elizabeth uses social media, particularly Instagram posts, to raise awareness about rhino poaching at the Poached Rhino fundraiser.[22]
