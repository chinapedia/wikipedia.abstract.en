History

The maintenance shed alongside the Fen LineThe depot is a three-track[4] dead-end shed which was opened by British Rail in 1958.[5] Until 1987, when the allocation was withdrawn, the depot had an allocation of Classes 101, 105, 114 and 120 DMUs.[6][7] Class 08 shunters could also be seen stabled at the depot.[8] The depot was used by RES for the maintenance of its rolling stock until 1996, and was reopened by Central Trains less than eighteen months later.[9] The Cambridge University Railway Club adopted number of shunting locomotives down the ages at Coldham Lane Depot. For each locomotive, CURC fitted them with nameplate, "EAGLE _((CURC))". In 1996, RES closed down its operations in Coldham Lane, so the loco was going elsewhere. Therefore the CURC presented the nameplate to the retiring depot manager.


Allocation

As of 2016, the depot's allocation consists of CrossCountry Class 170 Turbostars.
