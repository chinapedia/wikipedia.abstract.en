CECILIA MARY ADY (28 November 1881 – 27 March 1958) was an English writer, academic and historian. She worked at the University of Oxford and like her mother she was known for her knowledge of the Italian Renaissance. She came to notice after her colleagues supported her reinstatement after she was dismissed by her former friend from her college.


Life

Ady was born in Edgcote in Northamptonshire in 1881. Her father was a reverend whilst her mother was a biographer and an amateur expert of the Italian Renaissance. Her mother's interest in Italy was influenced by her uncle William Cornwallis Cartwright.[1] Her mother took on her daughters education and with that Ady went to Oxford where she obtained a first degree at St Hugh's Hall in 1903. She was a protege of the historian Edward Armstrong.[2] He was commissioned to create a book series called _The States of Italy_. His plans were not fulfilled and only Ady's book _History of Milan under the Sforza_ was one of only two that were published.[3]

In 1909 she joined her alma mater as a tutor where she had a close relationship with the college's principal, Eleanor Jourdain. Jourdain eventually turned against Ady, allegedly jealous of her popularity.[4] Ady was sacked from her position in November 1923 at Jourdain's insistence for disloyalty. Jourdain felt that Ady had leaked information to the staff about her plans for a vice-principal at the college.[5] Ady protested and a mass resignation followed including six of the college's council. The matter was a matter of some interest and Lord Curzon was asked to investigate. She was, in time, cleared and Jourdain died just before she was to be asked to resign. The inquiry resulted in improvements to the employment conditions of female tutors.[6]

Ady then became a tutor with the Society of Home Students and in 1929 her old college reemployed her as a research fellow.[7]

In 1937 she was awarded the degree of Doctor of Literature after she published a monograph titled _The Bentivoglio of Bologna: a Study in Despotism_.[8]

Ady died in Oxford in 1958. Afterwards her colleagues and former research students put together a book of donated essays - _Italian Renaissance Studies_ (1960).
