The OPEN COURT PRINCIPLE requires that court proceedings presumptively be open and accessible to the public and to the media.[1]

In contrast, _in camera_ describes court proceedings where the public and press are not allowed to observe the procedure or process.


Purpose

The virtues of openness were discussed by the Supreme Court of Canada in _A.G. Nova Scotia v. MacIntyre_ which quoted eighteenth-century philosopher Jeremy Bentham:

    In the darkness of secrecy, sinister interest and evil in every shape have full swing. Only in proportion as publicity has place can any of the checks applicable to judicial injustice operate. Where there is no publicity there is no justice. Publicity is the very soul of justice. It is the keenest spur to exertion and the surest of all guards against improbity. It keeps the judge himself while trying under trial. [2]

As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in _Vancouver Sun (Re)_, the OPEN COURT PRINCIPLE enhances the public's confidence in the justice system:

    Public access to the courts guarantees the integrity of judicial processes by demonstrating "that justice is administered in a non-arbitrary manner, according to the rule of law". Openness is necessary to maintain the independence and impartiality of courts. It is integral to public confidence in the justice system and the public's understanding of the administration of justice. Moreover, openness is a principal component of the legitimacy of the judicial process and why the parties and the public at large abide by the decisions of courts.[3]

The open court principle is linked to the freedom of expression and freedom of the press which include the right of the public to receive information. The press plays a vital role as the conduit through which the public receives information regarding the operation of public institutions.[4][5]


Canadian legislation

Section 135(1) of the _Courts of Justice Act_ (Ontario) states the general principle that "all court hearings shall be open to the public".

Subsection 486(1) of the _Criminal Code_ states: "Any proceedings against an accused shall be held in open court, but where the presiding judge, provincial court judge or justice, as the case may be, is of the opinion that it is in the interest of public morals, the maintenance of order or the proper administration of justice to exclude all or any members of the public from the court room for all or part of the proceedings, he may so order."


Canadian jurisprudence

_Vancouver Sun (Re)_

In 2004, the _Vancouver Sun_ newspaper successfully argued that certain court proceedings in relation to the Air India terrorist attack should be open to the public. Section 83.28 of the _Criminal Code_ allows the exclusion of the public and media from certain court proceedings in relation to terrorism offences.[6]


United States

In the United States, the term "in open court" means the appearance by a party or their attorney in a public court session such as during a trial.


United Kingdom

The open court principle has long been recognized as a cornerstone of the common law. As noted in its 1913 decision in _Scott v. Scott_, the House of Lords noted the right of public access to the courts is “one of principle ... turning, not on convenience, but on necessity". Viscount Haldane L.C., noted that “Justice is not a cloistered virtue”. [7]

In the 1936 decision of _Ambard v. Attorney-General for Trinidad and Tobago_, Lord Atkin noted “Publicity is the very soul of justice. It is the keenest spur to exertion, and the surest of all guards against improbity.”[8]
