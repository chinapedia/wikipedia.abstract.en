Plot

Gloria (Sofia Vergara), Phil (Ty Burrell), and Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) reveal that being married to a Pritchett is not always easy which is the reason why they formed an alliance against their judgmental spouses. Gloria helps Cameron to get rid of two Russian guests who are refusing to leave the rented upstairs unit and Cameron and Phil conspire to hide the evidence of the electric shock collar which Gloria has bought for Stella against Jay's wishes. This scheme backfires when Phil triggers the electric shock collar he has hidden on his person, and Manny (Rico Rodriguez) discovers that orange juice Gloria was supposed to buy (and which also the code for the alliance) is missing from the fridge, arousing Mitchell's suspicions.

A widow at the country club becomes infatuated with Luke (Nolan Gould) and Jay tries to take advantage of the situation by getting her to sign a petition to allow cigar smoking inside the club.

Haley (Sarah Hyland) decides to know Rainer’s daughter April better but she ends up in a parental role instead, which makes her very uncomfortable.

The entire family are to vote on the destination for the family holiday; but Jay, Claire, and Mitchell overrule this as payback for the Alliance's behaviour, deciding on Italy. Cameron, Phil, and Gloria pretend to be sad, but it is revealed in the final scenes that they wanted Italy all along and had been conspiring to influence their spouses' decisions using subtle language and Italian-themed props.
