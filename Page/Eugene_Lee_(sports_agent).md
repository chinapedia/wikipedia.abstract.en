ETL Associates, Inc.

Lee served as the founder and president of ETL Associates, Inc. ("ETL"),[2][3][4] his first NFL player representation agency from May 2001 to April 2015. During this time span, Lee was the first NFL agent to negotiate a 53-man roster salary for a client on a practice squad. As a result of this negotiation, the NFLPA revised its bylaws and opened the door for other players to collect greater compensation while under contract to NFL teams.

MBK Sports Management Group, LLC

After ETL Associates, Inc., Lee formed MBK Sports Management Group, LLC[5] in May 2015. It is an NFL player representation agency headquartered out of New York City with offices in Cleveland and Los Angeles.

Lee and his team have negotiated NFL player contracts totaling well over $1 billion.
