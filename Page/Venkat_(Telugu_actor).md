VENKAT is a Telugu actor who appears primarily in Telugu films.


Career

Venkat debuted as one of the lead actors in YVS Chowdary’s first film _Sri Sita Ramula Kalyanam Chootamu Raarandi_. He began working as an actor in 1999. He acted with stars including ANR, Chiranjeevi, Balakrishna, Mohan Babu, Jagapati Babu and Srihari.

As of 2016, he has been in the film industry for 17 years. In the meantime, he produced a film titled _Konchem Koththaga_ in Telugu and Hindi.

In 2014, he appeared in _Aa Aiduguru_, produced by Prem Kumar Patra (of _Aa Naluguru_ fame). He played the role of an officer, Thota Chakravarthy. The story is about a team of officers and youth implementing reforms of a young and educated CM.

In an interview with "idlebrain" Jeevi on 17 December 2013, he said "I'm not related to Akkineni’s family. I heard people think that I was related to Nagarjuna. Just, I worked in _Sri Seetharamula Kalyanamu Chootamu Rarandi_, which was produced by Nagarjuna. YVS Chowdary was searching for a new guy, energetic guy. I was found to be the right person. Nagarjuna got me the break. My money was paid and I was out, after the project got finished. I will never forget his gesture." He also added "It all happened when Akkineni Nagarjuna gave me an opportunity to make my debut with the film Sri Seetharamula Kalyanamu Chootamu Rarandi in the direction of YVS Chowdary. Though it seemed long ago, the people had not forgotten me. I am fresh in their minds. A number of heroes have come and gone. Still, I continue to remain with them. Not that I am big star, but I believe in capabilities. I was never after chances. At the same time, I didn’t get any big chances. I am a Vijayawada product. I moved to Mumbai just like that. I observed lot many things. That helps me a great deal. In fact, my media friends ask me why I had taken a big gap in the career. But, I had never missed the industry. On and often, I have been doing some good roles. I didn’t get any commercial break. There was no back support to me, and no guidance. Most of my career, I was left in a dilemma. I don’t blame anybody for the stalemate."


Personal life

Venkat hails from Vijayawada and his family lives in Mumbai. He was the opening batsman in his school and college cricket teams. Before venturing into films, he was a model and was spotted by Nagarjuna and he was launched as an actor through _Sri Sita Ramula Kalyanam Chootamu Raarandi_.
