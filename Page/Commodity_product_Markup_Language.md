CPML}} COMMODITY PRODUCT MARKUP LANGUAGE (CpML) is an industry standard used in wholesale energy trading. CpML is an XML-based business mark-up language used for interoperable representation of energy trades for the purpose of post-deal-execution processes like deal confirmation and regulatory reporting.


History and governance

CpML 5.0 was first announced in 2013,[1] and is based on previous standards created by European Federation of Energy Traders (EFET). CpML is governed by the CpML Foundation,[2] a foundation under Dutch law created in 2014.[3]

The Governance Board of the CpML Foundation consisted initially of representatives of EDF Trading, Freepoint Commodities Europe, Gazprom Marketing & Trading, RWE Supply & Trading and EFET.[4]
