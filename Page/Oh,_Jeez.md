"OH, JEEZ" is the seventh episode in the twentieth season of the American animated television series _South Park_. The 274th episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 9, 2016.

The episode lampooned the result of the 2016 United States presidential election the night before this episode was aired, in which Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton.


Plot

The day after the 2016 United States presidential election, people are shocked that Mr. Garrison has defeated Hillary Clinton, especially Randy Marsh. In contrast to his earlier actions, Garrison in a dazed speech embraces his election. Randy visits Garrison and his running mate Caitlyn Jenner to confront their changed attitude and their changed belief that _Star Wars: The Force Awakens_ was not a bad movie when Jenner suddenly vomits a member berry-based substance onto Randy, causing him to fall into the same dazed state of acceptance. Later at his home, Randy vomits on Sharon and Shelly, bringing them into the same state.

The city of Fort Collins, Colorado, has not had their election votes tallied as they are walled off due to the city's entire Internet histories being published from the Danish website known as Troll Trace. Government representatives arrive at Gerald and Sheila Broflovski's home and take Gerald away, who believes that this is a result of his trolling actions as Skankhunt42. He is led under a bridge where he meets with Hillary Clinton. Hillary and her agents task Gerald to become a spy and infiltrate Troll Trace headquarters in Denmark as an ambassador with a briefcase that would emit an electromagnetic pulse, destroying their computer equipment. When Gerald arrives in Denmark, he is warmly welcomed to the Troll Trace headquarters and taken to a room he believes is the server room only to be surprised by meeting his Internet troll friend Dildo Schwaggins and the rest of his trolling team. Schwaggins reveals that they were all set up by Hillary to be fake spies and purposefully given to the Danes in return for Denmark not activating the Troll Trace website. Their briefcases then simultaneously all open to reveal that they have been rickrolled.

Cartman is scared that his girlfriend Heidi Turner will find out about his previous Internet history, so he asks Butters to help him cover up his previous Internet actions, but Butters is still mad at Cartman and the girls. Later, PC Principal hosts a school assembly with Bill Clinton who also brings along Bill Cosby to introduce a new gentlemen's club in hopes that the boys and girls of the school can get along. Bill Clinton has Stan and Wendy Testaburger try to make up but Butters interrupts their session by pressing his penis against the window. Bill Clinton later meets with Butters and reveals to him that this gentlemen's club is only an act to avoid the wrath of Hillary and the rest of the women when their Internet histories are revealed by Troll Trace. Eventually, Cartman takes Heidi to a SpaceX station with plans to escape to Mars and be completely isolated from the rest of the world.


Production

This episode was originally going to be titled "The Very First Gentleman";[1] however, the title and a large amount of the content was changed at the last minute to reflect the results of the 2016 United States presidential election. Critics seemed to believe that Trey Parker and Matt Stone had originally written the episode with the premise of Hillary Clinton winning the election,[2][3] which the pair later confirmed.[4] The original broadcast of the episode also left the first uncensored usage of the word "fucking" in the series' history.[5]


Reception

Many of the critical reviews focused on the changes the episode had to incorporate due to the election results. Jesse Schedeen from IGN rated the episode an 8.5 out of 10, noting "It'll be interesting to see how much Parker and Stone's reaction to the outcome of the election fuels these final three episodes."[6] Jeremy Lambert with 411 Mania rated it a 7.8 out of 10, and summarized "_South Park_ had their work cut out for them, but I thought they handled everything as you would expect _South Park_ to handle these things."[7] Dan Caffrey with _The A.V. Club_ rated it a Câˆ’ and thought "It just meanders, adding more cloak and daggers to the troll storyline as the show sluggishly moves to the end of its season."[8]
