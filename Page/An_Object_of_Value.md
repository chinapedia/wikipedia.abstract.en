Plot

Thomas Watkins continues his liaison with Sarah and they fall in love. Rose and Thomas are showing their jealousy over Sarah's affections and they duel over Sarah's affections. They both love Sarah. Thomas Watkins wants to get into the motorcar business. He is the inciter who seeks to influence the mind of Sarah to steal a bottle of wine. Thomas becomes a suspect in the brooch theft. Rose thinks that he also influenced the mind of Sarah to steal the brooch. The furniture and fittings destroyed in the fight scene are revealingly flimsy. The chair Donaldson falls onto seems to have no fastenings at the joints at all and collapses at first impact.

Thomas Watkins and Mr. Donaldson fight a duel over Sarah's honor and over Sarah's love. In the fight scene between Watkins and Donaldson the furniture and fittings have been completely destroyed by Thomas Watkins.[1][2]
