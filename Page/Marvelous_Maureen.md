MARVELOUS MAUREEN is a comic book character created by Lori Walls[1] who appeared in comics published by Archie Comics. She first appeared in _Pep Comics_ #383 (Apr. 1982). Her adventures were all scripted and penciled by Walls, with most stories being inked by Jon D'Agostino. Marvelous Maureen's adventures are in the vein of a humorous science fiction soap opera, with an ongoing storyline that ultimately stretched over twenty episodes.[2] Trina Robbins & Catherine Yronwode described the Marvelous Maureen stories as "light-hearted and fanciful," but ultimately felt that the feature bore "little resemblance to the Archie school humor-style."[3] After appearing in almost every issue of _Pep_ from Apr. 1982 to Sept. 1985, the character never appeared again.


Publication history

Marvelous Maureen was featured as a backup story (generally in six-page installments), in every issue of _Pep Comics_ from #383 (Apr. 1982) to #402 (Sept. 1985), except issue #400 (which was a special commemorative issue featuring a self-reflexive story where Archie and the gang go to the Archie Comics offices in Mamaroneck to discuss possible ideas for _Pep Comics_ #400). Maureen's adventures also appeared in four consecutive issues of _Laugh Comics_ from Nov. 1982–July 1983. In addition, a crossword featuring Maureen was printed in _Archie's Pals 'n' Gals_, #164 (June 1983). Altogether, more than 140 pages of "Marvelous Maureen" content were published.

Each episode of "Marvelous Maureen" ended with a caption box urging readers to send in ideas for costumes, weapons, spaceships, and monsters to the Archie offices.


Background

Lori Walls is the sister of Jeannette Walls, author of the memoir _The Glass Castle_.[4] The character Marvelous Maureen is named after their younger sister Maureen Walls.[5] Lori Walls was working in-house at Archie[6] when she was given the reins of "Marvelous Maureen."

Other than Marvelous Maureen, the only other comics credits by Lori Walls were published by Archie Comics during the same period 1982–1985, mostly being activity pages, puzzles, and the like:

Character biography and storyline

MAUREEN is a normal Los Angeles teenager obsessed with sports, rock music, clothes, and comic books. She is blonde and wears glasses. One day she discovers an abandoned alien spaceship (the _Gypsy Moth_) in her back yard, gets in, and blasts off. She soon discovers a spacesuit inside the ship, and donning it, becomes CAPTAIN MAUREEN/MARVELOUS MAUREEN. Along with her sidekick, Mortimer (see below), she battles the Grossniks, a bug-like alien race.

MORTIMER (introduced in _Pep_ #383, Apr. 1982) — a gloomy human-dog hybrid alien with a lion's tail.

GUMBRAYNE (introduced in _Pep_ #384, June 1982) — the main antagonist, leader of the Grossniks, who bears a strong resemblance to Darth Vader without his helmet. (_Return of the Jedi_ had recently been released at the time of the story's publication, so the connection seems obvious.)

SILVER BEETLE (introduced in _Pep_ #384, June 1982) — a robot that sings parodies of Beatles songs. (An early incarnation of The Beatles was known as "The Silver Beatles.")[7]

WONDER BLUNDER (introduced in _Pep_ #385, Aug. 1982) — a silly man dressed in a caped costume who is part of "The United Group of Humans." Often referred to as "W.B.," Wonder Blunder is a sort of love interest for Maureen and (later) Clarissa. Wonder Blunder was created by reader Keith Kaplan of New York City.

CLARISSA DUBOIS (introduced in _Laugh Comics_ #376, Jan. 1983) — a teenage girl (who claims to be a witch) from the planet Izod who becomes Maureen's ally and then "frenemy."

REPTILICUS (introduced in _Laugh Comics_ #376, Jan. 1983) — reptilian humanoid who befriends Maureen and becomes part of the gang. Created by reader Michael Hyden of Oklahoma City.

MONSIOUR DUBOIS (introduced in _Pep_ #388, Mar. 1983) — Clarissa's father, who is turned into a slime monster during their adventures.
