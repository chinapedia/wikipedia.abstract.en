Charlotte_Mansfield_novelist.jpg CHARLOTTE MANSFIELD (1881â€“1936) was an English novelist, poet, and traveler, known for her planned 1909 "Cape to Cairo"[1] journey.[2]


Career

Mansfield's novels include _Torn Lace_ (1904);[3] _The Girl and the Gods_ (1907);[4] _Love and a Woman_;[5] _Red Pearls_ (1914);[6] _Gloria, a Girl of the South African Veldt_ (1916);[7] _The Dupe_ (1917), a World War I spy story;[8] _Sex and Siller_ (1920);[9] and _Strings_ (1920), a supernatural thriller about an evil violin.[10] She also published two books of poems, _Flowers of the Wind_ (1899), and _Poems_ (1902).[11][12] The _Spectator_ reviewer called her poetry "verses of indifferent quality, now and then audacious in sentiment."[13]

Her widely publicized "Cape to Cairo" tour in fact only reached to Lake Tanganyika before returning to South Africa.[14] She wrote about her travels in southern Africa in _Via Rhodesia: A Journey Through Southern Africa_ (1911)).[15] In reviewing the book, _The Register_ of Adelaide commented, "a less fitting person to follow in the steps of Mary Kingsley could hardly be imagined."[16]

Mansfield's _Gloria, A Girl of the South African Veldt_ was one of the first South African novels to be adapted for the screen, when American director Lorimer Johnston made a silent picture at Killarney Film Studios in 1916 based on Mansfield's novel, starring English actress Mabel May in the title role.[17]

Charlotte Mansfield was also an accomplished needlework artist, and exhibited her embroidery work in London.[18]


Personal life

In 1909, she married mining engineer Vladimir Raffalovich in London; they lived in Johannesburg, South Africa.[19] Alfred Edward Turner and Mansfield's new sister-in-law Vera Raffalovich Friedlander presented and hosted the wedding festivities.[20] Vladimir Raffalovich survived Charlotte Mansfield Raffalovich when she died in 1936, aged 55 years.
