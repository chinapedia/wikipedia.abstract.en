is a widely known form of card solitaire.]]

SOLITAIRE is any tabletop game which one can play by oneself. The term "solitaire" is also used for single-player games of concentration and skill using a set layout of tiles, pegs or stones rather than cards. These games include peg solitaire and mahjong solitaire. Most solitaire games function as a puzzle which, due to a different starting position, may (or may not) be solved in a different fashion each time.


Types of games

-   Patience, also known as "solitaire with cards", generally involves placing cards in a layout, and sorting them according to specific rules. A common variant is Klondike, which is included with the Windows operating system under the title _Solitaire_.
-   Mahjong solitaire
-   Peg solitaire (more of a puzzle than a game, since, once it is solved, it is repeatable)
-   Concentration also known as _memory_, _Pelmanism_, _shinkei-suijaku_, _pexeso_ or simply _pairs_, a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.
