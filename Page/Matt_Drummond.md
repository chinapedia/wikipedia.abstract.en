MATTHEW SIMON DRUMMOND (born 24 June 1973) is an Australian film director, screenwriter and visual effects supervisor.


Personal

Matthew Drummond is the eldest child of musician Pat Drummond and the brother of Pete Drummond from the Australasian band Dragon.[1]


Career

In 1998 Drummond opened the visual effects agency, Hive Studios International.[2] During this time he began work with Catalyst, under scientist and filmmaker, Richard Smith.[3] Smith and Drummond have collaborated on several documentaries.[4] In 1993 Drummond opened his first graphics company named Extra Digital.

In 2008 the Blue Mountains regional business chamber named Hive Studios International Business of the Year and Arts and Culture Business of the Year,[5][6] and the company subsequently worked with Discovery Channel USA, National Geographic USA, and History Channel USA. This work resulted in a 2014 News & Documentary Emmy Award for Graphic Design and Art Direction.[7]

Drummond's work extended into providing 3D VFX installations for the Australian Museum.[8]


Film

Drummond began to develop in-house productions during his time in Vanuatu in 2009-2013. While living in Vanuatu, Drummond met long time Hollywood producer Paul Mason,[9] who suggested that Drummond should produce a film, rather than the television series as planned. Mason was later listed in the credits of _Dinosaur Island_.

In 2011, Drummond began writing _Dinosaur Island_.[10] Principal photography began in October 2011 on the island of Efate. Drummond returned to Australia in 2013 to complete Post Production on the film, where Jason Moody signed on as Executive Producer and Chris Wright as Composer. Hive Studios International completed visual effects on the film. The international rights to _Dinosaur Island_ were acquired at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival by Arclight Films, and were later sold into over 50 countries.[11] The film premiered on 14 February 2015[12] and was released in Australia on 28 February 2015. It remained in cinemas for approximately 5 weeks.[13][14] The film was the first theatrical release to feature a feathered dinosaur.[15][16]

Drummond's next film, _My Pet Dinosaur (2017)_, was acquired by Faisal Toor of Empress Road Pictures at the 2015 American Film Market. Pinnacle Films acquired the Australian/New Zealand theatrical rights for a release on April 22, 2017.[17]
