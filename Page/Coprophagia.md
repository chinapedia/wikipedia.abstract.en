'') feeds on feces.]] COPROPHAGIA ()[1] or COPROPHAGY () is the consumption of feces. The word is derived from the Greek κόπρος __, "feces" and φαγεῖν __, "to eat". _Coprophagy_ refers to many kinds of feces-eating, including eating feces of other species (heterospecifics), of other individuals (allocoprophagy), or one's own (autocoprophagy) – those once deposited or taken directly from the anus.[2]

In humans, coprophagia has been described since the late nineteenth century in individuals with mental illnesses and in unconventional sexual acts.[3] Some animal species eat feces as a normal behavior, in particular lagomorphs who do so to allow tough plant materials to be digested more thoroughly by passing twice through the digestive tract. Other species may eat feces under certain conditions.


Humans

Coprophagia has been observed in some people with schizophrenia[4] and pica.[5]

Ttongsul, or "feces wine" has been used in old Korean medicine. Ideally, a child's excrement is used in the preparation with alcohol content up to 9% by volume.[6]


Other animals

Invertebrates

These feces contain substantial amounts of semi-digested food, particularly in the case of herbivores, owing to the inefficiency of the large animals' digestive systems. Two feces-eating insects are certain species of fly and the dung beetle. Dung beetles feed on the microorganism-rich liquid component of mammals' dung, and lay their eggs in balls composed mainly of the remaining fibrous material.[7]

Termites eat one another's feces as a means of obtaining their hindgut protists. Termites and protists have a symbiotic relationship (e.g. with the protozoan that allows the termites to digest the cellulose in their diet). For example, in one group of termites, there is a three-way symbiotic relationship: termites of the family Rhinotermitidae, cellulolytic protists of the genus _Pseudotrichonympha_ in the guts of these termites, and intracellular bacterial symbionts of the protists.[8]

Vertebrates

Domesticated and wild mammals are sometimes coprophagic, and in some species this forms an essential part of their method of digesting tough plant material. Dogs may be coprophagic, possibly to rebalance their microbiome or to ingest missing nutrients.[9]

Species within the Lagomorpha (rabbits, hares, and pikas) produce two types of fecal pellets: hard ones, and soft ones called cecotropes. Animals in these species reingest their cecotropes, to extract further nutrients. Cecotropes derive from chewed plant material that collects in the cecum, a chamber between the large and small intestine, containing large quantities of symbiotic bacteria that help with the digestion of cellulose and also produce certain B vitamins. After excretion of the soft cecotrope, it is again eaten whole by the animal and redigested in a special part of the stomach. The pellets remain intact for up to six hours in the stomach; the bacteria within continue to digest the plant carbohydrates. This double-digestion process enables these animals to extract nutrients that they may have missed during the first passage through the gut, as well as the nutrients formed by the microbial activity.[10] This process serves the same purpose within these animals as rumination (cud-chewing) does in cattle and sheep.[11]

Cattle in the United States are often fed chicken litter. There are concerns that the practice of feeding chicken litter to cattle could lead to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad-cow disease) because of the crushed bone meal in chicken feed. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates this practice by attempting to prevent the introduction of any part of a cow's brain or spinal cord into livestock feed.[12] Other countries, like Canada, have banned chicken litter for use as a livestock feed.[13]

The young of elephants, giant pandas, koalas and hippos eat the feces of their mothers or other animals in the herd, in order to obtain the bacteria required to properly digest vegetation found in their ecosystems.[14] When such animals are born, their intestines are sterile and do not contain these bacteria. Without doing this they would be unable to obtain any nutritional value from plants.

Hamsters, guinea pigs, chinchillas, hedgehogs and naked mole-rats eat their own droppings, which are thought to be a source of vitamins B and K, produced by gut bacteria. On rare occasions gorillas have been observed consuming their feces, possibly out of boredom, a desire for warm food, or to reingest seeds contained in the feces.[15]


Plants

Some carnivorous plants, such as pitcher plants of the genus _Nepenthes_, obtain nourishment from the feces of commensal animals.[16][17]


History

Lewin reported that "... consumption of fresh, warm camel feces has been recommended by Bedouins as a remedy for bacterial dysentery; its efficacy (probably attributable to the antibiotic subtilisin from _Bacillus subtilis_) was anecdotally confirmed by German soldiers in Africa during World War II".[18]

Centuries ago, physicians tasted their patients' feces, to better judge their state and condition.[19]


Society and culture

Coprophagia is sometimes depicted in pornography, usually under the term _scat_ (from _scatology_).[20]

_The 120 Days of Sodom_, a novel by the Marquis de Sade written in 1785, is full of detailed descriptions of erotic sadomasochistic coprophagia.[21] Thomas Pynchon's award-winning 1973 novel _Gravity's Rainbow_ contains a detailed scene of coprophagia.[22] François Rabelais, in his classic _Gargantua and Pantagruel_, often employs the expression _mâche-merde_ or _mâchemerde_, meaning _shit-chewer_. This in turn comes from the Greek comedians Aristophanes and particularly Menander, who often use the term skatophagos (_σκατοϕφάγος_).[23] The Austrian actor and pornographic director created the series "Avantgarde Extreme" and "Portrait Extrem", which explores coprophagy, coprophilia and urolagnia. Modern Russian writer Vladimir Sorokin's novel _Norma_ describes a society where coprophagia is institutionalised and mandatory. GG Allin, an American singer and songwriter, often featured coprophagy in his performances.
