The EPITAPH OF SAMUEL () is an Ancient Greek limestone tombstone slab epitaph inscription which was discovered in 1934, in the monastic cemetery of the Byzantine period, at the YMCA area in Jerusalem.[1][2]

The inscription mentions _"Iberian_ [i.e. Georgian[3]] _bishop, Samuel"_ and the purchase of a tomb or a monastery in the Tower of David. Because of the incorrect Greek, it is unclear if the Iberians bought a tomb or a monastery.[4] The slab is partly broken and the whole right corner of it is lost. It is dated to the late 5th or early 6th century AD. The inscription is kept at Rockefeller Museum.[5]
