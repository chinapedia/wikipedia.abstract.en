_CENTESIMA RERUM VENALIUM_ (literally hundredth of the value of everything sold) was a 1% tax on goods sold at auction.


History

Tax revenues went into a fund to pay military retirement benefits (_aerarium militare_), along with those from a new sales tax (_centesima rerum venalium_), a 1% tax on goods sold at auction.[1] The inheritance tax is extensively documented in sources pertaining to Roman law, inscriptions, and papyri.[2] It was one of three major indirect taxes levied on Roman citizens in the provinces of the Empire.[3]
