Name and Logo Origin

The idea for the name and logo comes from the astronomical term Apoapsis: An apsis (Greek apsis) is the point of greatest or least distance of a body from one of the foci of its elliptical orbit. The point of farthest excursion is called the Apoapsis (Greek apó, “from”). It’s actually the point in an orbit farthest from the body being orbited.[44]
