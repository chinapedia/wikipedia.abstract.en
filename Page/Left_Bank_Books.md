Seattle_-_Left_Bank_Books.jpg Left_Bank_Books,_Pike_Place_Market,_1975.jpg LEFT BANK BOOKS COLLECTIVE is an anarchist bookstore, founded in 1973, in Seattle, Washington. It is located at 92 Pike Street, on the corner of Pike Place Market. Its Lonely Planet review states that it "displays zines in _espa√±ol_, revolutionary pamphlets, essays by Chomsky and an inherent suspicion of authority."[1]

The store hosts occasional events that are described among the "top 15 things to do this week" or similar reviews in Seattle.[2] It is also a small publisher[3] and it ran an IndieGoGo fundraising campaign in 2014, when it had been operating for 40 years.[4]
