PI4 (α-KTx 6.4) is a short toxin from the scorpion _Pandinus imperator_ that blocks specific potassium channels.[1][2][3]


Etymology

The name Pi4 is the fourth toxin isolated from the scorpion _Pandinus imperator_, from which Pi1, Pi2, Pi3, and Pi7 have also been isolated.[4]


Chemistry

Pi4 is a peptide, which consists of 38 amino-acids with the following sequence:

IEAIRCGGSRDCYRPCQKRTGCPNAKCINKTCKCYGCS[5][6]

It contains an α-helix and a β-sheet; it is stabilized by four cysteine-pairings that are crosslinked by four short disulfide bridges. The four disulfide bridges are characteristic for the α-KTX6 subfamily, while most other scorpion toxins contain only three disulfide bridges.[7] The cysteines of Pi4 are paired in the following order: ⁶C–²⁷C; ¹²C–³²C; ¹⁶C–³⁴C; ²²C–³⁷C.[8][9]

Most disulfide bridges show a left-handed conformation, although in the disulfide bridge between ²²C–³⁷C some variation is found. Only the disulfide bridge between ⁶C–²⁷C shows a right-handed conformation.[10]


Target & Mode of action

Pi4 blocks different potassium channels, for instance, the Shaker B, K_(v)1.2, and SK potassium channels.

_Shaker_ B channel

Pi4 binds to Shaker B potassium channels, the Drosophila homologue of the voltage-gated potassium channel K_(v)1.1.[11] Pi4 reversibly blocks this channel with an IC₅₀ of 3.0 ± 2.2 nM.[12][13]

A Pi4 peptide, synthesized with a different C-terminus than the natural Pi4 (COO- instead of COH₂N), shows the same binding characteristics as natural Pi4.[14] This suggests that the C-terminus of the peptide Pi4 is not involved in the binding of Pi4 to the Shaker B channel.[15]

The residues ²⁶K, ²⁸I, ²⁹N, ³³K, and ³⁵Y might be important for Pi4's interaction with Shaker B channels,[16] especially ²⁶K and ³⁵Y, which form a conserved dyad of a lysine and aromatic cluster in other potassium channel toxins.[17] It has been suggested that the positive charge of the lysine mimicks a potassium ion and enters the pore of the potassium channel,[18][19][20] hence occluding the pore opening and inhibiting the ion flux.

Kv1.2 channel

Pi4 blocks the voltage-gated potassium channel K_(v)1.2.[21] at low concentrations (IC₅₀ 8.0 ± 5 pM).[22] No significant effects have been observed on Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 channels at concentrations up to 10 µm.[23]

In the binding of the peptide Pi4 to the K_(v)1.2 channel, the β-sheet structure is thought to play an important role. First, the residue ³⁵Y, located in the β-sheet structure, tightly interacts via electrostatic forces with the aromatic cluster of Kv1.2 channels (³⁴⁴W, ³⁴⁵W and ³⁵⁵Y).[24] Second, the residue ²⁶K becomes stabilized by the four carbonyl oxygen atoms located in the channel of pore formed by four Kv1.2 α-subunits (³⁵⁷D).[25] Finally, the four ³³²Q residues of the four α-subunits of Kv1.2 channels interact via salt bridges with four subunits of the toxin ring (composed of ¹⁰R, ¹⁹R, ³⁰K, ³³K).[26]

SK-channel

Furthermore, the Pi4 binds to SK channels, small conductance Ca²⁺-activated potassium channels.[27] Pi4 competes with apamin, another SK-channel toxin. IC₅₀ is 0.5 ± 0.2 µM.[28]


Toxicity

Scorpion venoms can be toxic for mammals, insects, and crustaceans.[29] Pi4 is lethal in mice upon injection in the ventricular system of the brain at and LD₅₀ value of 0.2  µg/mouse.[30]
