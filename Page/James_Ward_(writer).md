Early work

James Ward first came to prominence in 2009 with a blog that charted his fascination with "small unimportant things".[3] The London Twirls Project, his attempt to map the availability, pricing and storage conditions of Cadbury's Twirls in Central London,[4] led to him giving talks at public events such as Ignite[5][6] and The Lost Lectures.[7]

In 2010, he won a competition run by Virgin Atlantic and was flown to America to write a pen-based comparison of London and New York.[8]


Writing career

_Adventures in Stationery_

Ward's first book, _Adventures in Stationery: A Journey Through Your Pencilcase_, was published in the UK by Profile Books in 2014.[9] Described as "high class pornography for the stationery enthusiast",[10] it received generally positive reviews in the British press.[11] It has been translated into Korean, Japanese and Chinese.

_Adventures in Stationery_ was rewritten for the North American market and released in 2015 with the alternative title _The Perfection of the Paperclip: Curious Tales of Invention, Accidental Genius and Stationery Obsession_. This was due to words such as "stationery" and "pencil case" not commonly being part of the American English vocabulary. It was published by Simon and Schuster.[12]

Journalism

Ward has written for _The Guardian_,[13] _The Wall Street Journal_,[14] _The Daily Telegraph_,[15] and _New Humanist_,[16] amongst others.


Boring Conference

Inspired by the cancellation of Interesting Conference,[17] Ward founded Boring Conference in 2010.[18] The conference describes itself as "A one-day celebration of the mundane, the ordinary, the obvious and the overlooked".[19] Speakers at the conference give short talks on a wide variety of "boring" topics, which have previously included sneezing, toast, IBM tills, the Shipping Forecast, and barcodes.[20]

Past speakers include Jon Ronson, Josie Long, Rhodri Marsden, Adam Curtis and Greg Stekelman. An unexpected success, the event regularly sells out minutes after tickets go on sale.[21] In 2011, _The Sun_ ran with the headline "Disgrace as Boring Conference is Really Interesting".[22] The most recent Boring Conference – Boring VIII – took place at Conway Hall on 5 May 2018.[23]

The Boring Talks Podcast

In 2017, Ward made _The Boring Talks Podcast_ in collaboration with the BBC[24]. Available as a weekly download from January 2018, each podcast consists of a talk on a single subject that would generally be considered 'boring', such as 'yellow lines' and 'book pricing algorithms'.


Other projects

Public speaking

Ward regularly gives talks on Boring Conference, the minutiae of everyday life, the nature of boredom and the joys of stationery. He has spoken at IBTM World in Barcelona,[25] Secret Garden Party,[26] Kings Place in London,[27] the Hay Literary Festival[28] and Nerd Nite.[29] He appears in airline Jet Blue's in-flight video "HumanKinda"[30] and as a guest on podcasts _Little Atoms_[31] and _The Allusionist_.[32]

Stationery Club

In 2010, Ward co-founded Stationery Club, a regular gathering where people would meet in a pub to discuss which pen they were using at the moment.[33][34]

The Concept Album Talks

In 2015, Ward co-founded and hosted The Concept Album Talks.[35] Each event centres around a different concept album. Speakers give a talk inspired by the title of one track of that album that must last for the same duration as the song.[36] Albums covered so far are _The_ _Dark Side of the Moon_ and _Pet Sounds_.
