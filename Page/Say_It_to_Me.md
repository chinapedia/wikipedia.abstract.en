"SAY IT TO ME" is the fourth single from the Pet Shop Boys album _Super_. It was released on 16 September 2016 on CD single and as two digital bundles. A vinyl 12" of "Say It to Me" was released on September 20. The song did not have a promotional video to accompany it, and was not included in the set list for their 2016 Super Tour.


Release formats

The single was released on both digital and physical formats, featuring mixes by Real Lies, Tom Demac and Offer Nissim as well as two previously unreleased B-sides, "A cloud in a box" and "The Dead Can Dance". The cover art was a take on the album art for Super, the title centred in a circle, but designed to look like a dialogue blurb from a comic.
