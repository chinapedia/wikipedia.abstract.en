SEQUOIA MAGIC LOOP is an S&S - Sansei Technologies inverted Screaming Squirrel steel roller coaster located in Gardaland, Italy. The ride opened in 2005 with name SEQUOIA ADVENTURE. Riders spend a considerable time inverted, with 3 'saxophone' inversions where the cars turn 180 degrees onto a flat inverted section of track.

The ride closed in June 2017 because of mechanical issues and was scheduled to reopen in 2018. The technical problems however were very hard to solve. The ride remained closed for the 2018 season.

However, in November 2018, it was confirmed by Gardaland that the ride would reopen in 2019 with a magic theme and a new name, Sequoia Magic Loop.


Ride experience

After departing the station, the car makes a 180 degree right turn and begins to climb the 98.4ft lift hill. After reaching the top, it then goes along a short straight piece of track before entering the first saxophone inversion. The car then comes out of the inversion, goes along another straight piece of track and proceeds to do the same thing again. After exiting the second inversion, it travels along a small airtime hill before doing one more saxophone inversion. It then proceeds to do a 180 degree right turn back to the station.
