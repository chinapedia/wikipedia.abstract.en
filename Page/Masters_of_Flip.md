_MASTERS OF FLIP_ is a Canadian home renovation reality television series, which premiered in 2015 on W.[1] The series centres on Dave and Kortney Wilson, a married Canadian couple who moved to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue careers in country music and then turned to renovating and flipping houses after their musical careers faltered.[2]

The couple also previously appeared in the CMT Canada reality shows _Meet the Wilsons_ and _Kortney & Dave: By Request_,[3] and have served as guest judges on W's _Game of Homes_.[4]

In mid-2018, _Masters of Flip_ series was running on HGTV in North America but also in numerous other countries.[5]

At both the 4th Canadian Screen Awards in 2016 and the 5th Canadian Screen Awards in 2017, the series garnered a nomination for Best Lifestyle Program or Series.[6][7]

The series is slated to end after its fourth season, with the Wilsons moving on to a new show in which they renovate homes for other homeowners.[8]
