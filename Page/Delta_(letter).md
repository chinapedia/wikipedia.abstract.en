‚àÜ}} DELTA (uppercase Œî, lowercase Œî or ùõø; _d√©lta_, [1]) is the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 4. It was derived from the Phoenician letter dalet ê§É,[2] Letters that come from delta include Latin D and Cyrillic –î.

A river delta (originally, the Nile River delta) is so named because its shape approximates the triangular uppercase letter delta. Despite a popular legend, this use of the word _delta_ was not coined by Herodotus.[3]


Pronunciation

In Ancient Greek, delta represented a voiced dental plosive . In Modern Greek, it represents a voiced dental fricative , like the "th" in "that" or "this". It is romanized as _d_ or _dh_.


Upper case

The uppercase letter Œî can be used to denote:

-   Change of any changeable quantity, in mathematics and the sciences (more specifically, the difference operator[4][5]); for example, in:

$${y_2-y_1\over x_2-x_1} = {\Delta y \over \Delta x} ,$$

    the average change of y per unit x (i.e. the change of y over the change of x). Delta is the initial letter of the Greek word Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÜŒøœÅŒ¨ _diaphor√°_, "difference". (The small Latin letter D is used in much the same way for the notation of derivatives and differentials, which also describe change.)

-   The Laplace operator:

$$\Delta f = \sum_{i=1}^n {\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i^2}}$$

-   The discriminant of a polynomial equation, especially the quadratic equation:

-   The area of a triangle

$$\Delta = \tfrac{1}{2} a b \sin{C}$$

-   The symmetric difference of two sets
-   A macroscopic change in the value of a variable in mathematics or science

-   An interval of possible values for a given quantity
-   Any of the delta particles in particle physics
-   The determinant of the matrix of coefficients of a set of linear equations (see Cramer's rule)
-   That an associated locant number represents the location of a covalent bond in an organic compound, the position of which is variant between isomeric forms
-   A simplex, simplicial complex, or convex hull
-   In chemistry, the addition of heat in a reaction
-   In legal shorthand, it represents a defendant[7]
-   In the financial markets, one of the Greeks, describing the rate of change of an option price for a given change in the underlying benchmark
-   A major seventh chord in jazz music notation
-   In genetics, it can stand for a gene deletion (e.g. the CCR5-Œî32, a 32 nucleotide/bp deletion within CCR5)
-   The American Dental Association cites it (together with omicron for "odont") as the symbol of dentistry.[8]
-   The anonymous signature of James David Forbes.[9]
-   Determinacy (having a definite truth-value) in philosophical logic.
