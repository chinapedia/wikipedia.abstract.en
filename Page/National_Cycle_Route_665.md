Wetherby to Thorp Arch Estate

Starting on Linton Road Wetherby the route is a railway path before it goes through a housing estate and uses an underpass to cross the A1(M). There is a rail path from there to Thorpe Arch Estate. When opened in 2007, at a cost of Â£500,00[1], this section was numbered as Route 66[2], it is now fully signed as Route 665.

Thorpe Arch Estate to Tadcaster

As of summer 2017 this route is still a proposal. The planned route will cross the River Wharfe on a rail path and then follow the A659 to Tadcaster.[3]

Tadcaster to York

This section is paralleled to the south by NCN 66, which follows quiet country lanes.
