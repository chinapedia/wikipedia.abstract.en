The CHURCH OF THE INTERCESSION OF THE VIRGIN MARY or more formally CHURCH OF THE INTERCESSION OF THE VIRGIN MARY, QUEEN OF THE HOLY ROSARY () is a Catholic church in the city of Tomsk in Russia.[1] [2] [3] under the patronage of the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary. It is also alternatively called the _Polish church_ for the local population. Its parish is dependent on the Diocese of Novosibirsk at 4 Street Bakunin.


History

Religious Missionaries of Charity (founded by St. Mother Teresa) work in the parish. They also run a high school and a home for the homeless.

The historical center of the temple was the community of Poland, Belarus and Lithuania sent to Siberia after the Polish uprising in November 1830. This is why the church is commonly called the Polish church by the locals. Count Alexander Maszynski, Polish diplomat francophile, takes the initiative in its construction. It was completed in 1833 and consecrated on November 7, 1833. This is the first Catholic church in Western Siberia. An organ was installed in 1862.

The church was "nationalized" in 1922 and was given rent in the parish, and then was closed by the communist authorities in 1938 and "given to people for their own use". After the fall of communism he was returned to the Catholic community in 1990 and was consecrated again on October 6, 1991.
