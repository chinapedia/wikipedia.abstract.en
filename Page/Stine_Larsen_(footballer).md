STINE LARSEN (born 24 January 1996) is a Danish football player who plays as a forward for Brøndby IF of Denmark's Elitedivisionen and as a defender for the Danish national team.


Club career

After joining Brøndby IF as a 12-year-old, Larsen progressed into the first team in 2013 and quickly became an important player.[1] Team coach Per Nielsen praised her as a potential female Kim Vilfort.[2]


International career

Larsen made her senior international debut for Denmark in January 2015, starting a 1–1 friendly draw with New Zealand in Belek, Turkey. Although she began her national team career as a defender, versatile Larsen was named as a forward for a UEFA Women's Euro 2017 qualifying Group 4 win over Slovakia in June 2016.[3] Due to tournament-ending injuries to teammates Janni Arnth and Mie Leth Jans, Larsen was reverted to playing as a defender for the national team at the UEFA Women's Euro 2017 and has been a starter in the defence since.
