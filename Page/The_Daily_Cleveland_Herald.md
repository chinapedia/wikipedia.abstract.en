THE DAILY CLEVELAND HERALD was a daily American newspaper published by _Harris and Fairbanks_ from 1853 to 1874 in Cleveland, Ohio. It covered events in the city of Cleveland, Cuyahoga County and the state of Ohio.[1][2]

It was preceded by the _Cleveland Daily Herald_ (1839-1843, published by _J.A. Harris_)[3] and then _The Cleveland Herald_ (1843-1853, published weekly by _J.A. Harris_),[4] and succeeded by the _Cleveland Daily Herald_ (1874-1880, published by _Fairbanks, Benedict & Co._).[5]

It is noted as the first to publish a remark relating the process of law making to sausages. The March 29, 1869 edition of the paper quoted poet John Godfrey Saxe as stating: "Laws, like sausages, cease to inspire respect in proportion as we know how they are made."[6][7][8]
