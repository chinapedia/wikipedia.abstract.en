A review by _The New York Times_ stated "two beloved picture-book creators — the storyteller Mem Fox and the artist Helen Oxenbury — merge their talents in a winsome look at babies around the world."[7] _Booklist_ called it "A standout for its beautiful simplicity" and "A gentle, joyous offering."[8] and the _School Library Journal_ described it as a "nearly perfect picture book." and concluded "Whether shared one-on-one or in storytimes, where the large trim size and big, clear images will carry perfectly, this selection is sure to be a hit."[9] _Publishers Weekly_, in a starred review, wrote "Put two titans of kids' books together for the first time, and what do you get (besides the urge to shout, “What took you so long?”)? The answer: an instant classic."[10] and the _New York Journal of Books_, in a review of a bilingual edition, wrote "This is a sturdy, toddler-sized board book that has something for everybody. Ms. Fox’s text, soft and pure, offers sweet innocence, the joy of lives beginning, and the unique beauty of the mother-child love. Artist Helen Oxenbury’s exquisite illustrations are the perfect complement to the text".[11]

_The Horn Book Magazine_ referred to it as a " love song" and concluded "Snuggle up with your favorite baby and kiss those fingers and toes to both your hearts' content."[12] and _BookPage Reviews_ called it "a jewel of a picture book" and wrote "With minimal text, and sweet illustrations by beloved British artist Helen Oxenbury, it's truly an international treat. .. Ten Little Fingers and Ten Little Toes gently presents—but never preaches—a satisfying lesson about humanity and international harmony."[13]
