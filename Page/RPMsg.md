RPMSG (Remote Processor Messaging) is a protocol enabling inter-core communication in heterogeneous multicore systems.


Implementations

Protocol RPMsg is present in the Linux kernel [1] and is also available as a stand-alone component for microcontroller-based systems.[2][3]

Most of the RPMsg implementations are developed as open-source.[4][5][6][7]
