ALICE H. PUTNAM (1841 - January 19, 1919[1]) was an educator who opened the first private kindergarten in Chicago in 1874,[2] and was described as "the pioneer of the Kindergarten" in that city.[3]

Putnam "became interested in the kindergarten when her children were young".[4] She therefore "found ways of combining her own mothering with working to help others to become better mothers".[5] "Realizing that she needed kindergarten training, Putnam took her oldest daughter with her to Columbus, Ohio, where she studied in a training school run by Anna J. Ogden".[6]

In 1879, Putnam was joined in Chicago by Elizabeth Harrison, who became Putnam's assistant for a year before continuing with her own studies elsewhere.[7] In 1880 Putnam took over a Chicago training class that had been started by Anna J. Ogden, which then became the Chicago Froebel Association, directed by Putnam until 1910.[8][9] Putnam was a member of the International Kindergarten Union from its organization, in 1883, until her death, serving on its most important committees, and twice as its president.[10]

She was interred at Oak Woods Cemetery, Chicago, on January 21, 1919.[11]
