The Act of Congress establishes financial penalties and removal procedures for unattended barges exceeding forty-five days. The federal statute provides the U.S. Secretary of Transportation authority to contract with barge removal contractors for abandoned barges of more than one hundred gross tons.

The 1992 legislation was drafted as House Bill H.R. 5397 and Senate Bill S. 3262.[1] The H.R. 5397 bill was superseded by House Bill H.R. 5617 finalizing the Oceans Act of 1992.[2] The Act was passed by the 102nd United States Congressional session and enacted into law by the 41st President of the United States George H.W. Bush on November 4, 1992.

Rulemaking

In 1998, the Coast Guard issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to "establish a statutorily required numbering system for undocumented barges more than 100 gross tons operating on the navigable waters of the United States" in order to " identify parties responsible for the illegal abandonment of barges and prevent future marine pollution from abandoned barges."[17]
