AM_738_4to_Ratatoskr.png In Norse mythology, RATATOSKR (Old Norse, generally considered to mean "drill-tooth"[1] or "bore-tooth"[2]) is a squirrel who runs up and down the world tree Yggdrasil to carry messages between the eagle perched atop Yggdrasil, and the serpent Níðhöggr, who dwells beneath one of the three roots of the tree. Ratatoskr is attested in the _Poetic Edda_, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the _Prose Edda_, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson.


Etymology

The name _Ratatoskr_ contains two elements: _rata-_ and _-toskr_. The element _toskr_ is generally held to mean "tusk". Guðbrandur Vigfússon theorized that the _rati-_ element means "the traveller". He says that the name of the legendary drill Rati may feature the same term. According to Vigfússon, _Ratatoskr_ means "tusk the traveller" or "the climber tusk."[3]

Sophus Bugge theorized that the name _Ratatoskr_ is a loanword from Old English meaning "Rat-tooth." Bugge's basis hinges on the fact that the _-toskr_ element of the compound does not appear anywhere else in Old Norse. Bugge proposed that the _-toskr_ element is a reformation of the Old English word _tūsc_ (Old Frisian _tusk_) and, in turn, that the element _Rata-_ represents Old English _ræt_ ("rat").[4]

According to Albert Sturtevant, "[as] far as the element _Rata-_ is concerned, Bugge's hypothesis has no valid foundation in view of the fact that the [Old Norse] word _Rata_ (gen. form of _Rati_*) is used in _Háv[amál]_ (106, 1) to signify the instrument which Odin employed for _boring_ his way through the rocks in quest of the poet's mead [...]" and that "_Rati*_ must then be considered a native [Old Norse] word meaning "The Borer, Gnawer" [...]".[5]

Sturtevant says that Bugge's theory regarding the element _-toskr_ may appear to be supported by the fact that the word does not appear elsewhere in Old Norse. Sturtevant, however, disagrees. Sturtevant says that the Old Norse proper name _Tunne_ (derived from Proto-Norse _*Tunþē_) refers to "a person who is characterized as having some peculiar sort of _tooth_" and theorizes a Proto-Germanic form of _-toskr_. Sturtevant concludes that "the fact that the [Old Norse] word occurs only in the name _Rata-toskr_ is no valid evidence against this assumption, for there are many [Old Norse] _hapax legomena_ of native origin, as is attested by the equivalents in the Mod[ern] Scandinavian dialects."[6] Modern scholars have accepted this etymology, listing the name _Ratatoskr_ as meaning "drill-tooth" (Jesse Byock, Andy Orchard, Rudolf Simek[7]) or "bore-tooth" (John Lindow[8]).


Attestations

Ekorn.jpg in an evergreen tree in Norway]] In the _Poetic Edda_ poem _Grímnismál_, the god Odin (disguised as _Grímnir_) says that Ratatoskr runs up and down Yggdrasil bringing messages between the eagle perched atop it and Níðhöggr below it:

  +-------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+--+
  |     Benjamin Thorpe translation:                |     Henry Adams Bellows translation:             |  |
  |     Ratatösk is the squirrel named, who has run |     Ratatosk is the squirrel who there shall run |  |
  |     in Yggdrasil's ash;                         |     On the ash-tree Yggdrasil;                   |  |
  |     he from above the eagle's words must carry, |     From above the words of the eagle he bears,  |  |
  |     and beneath the Nidhögg repeat.[9]          |     And tells them to Nithhogg beneath.[10]      |  |
  +-------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+--+

Ratatoskr is described in the _Prose Edda_{{-'}}s _Gylfaginning_{{'s}} chapter 16, in which High states that

  An eagle sits at the top of the ash, and it has knowledge of many things. Between its eyes sits the hawk called Vedrfolnir [...]. The squirrel called Ratatosk [...] runs up and down the ash. He tells slanderous gossip, provoking the eagle and Nidhogg.[11]


Theories

According to Rudolf Simek, "the squirrel probably only represents an embellishing detail to the mythological picture of the world-ash in _Grímnismál_{{-"}}.[12] Hilda Ellis Davidson, describing the world tree, states the squirrel is said to gnaw at it—furthering a continual destruction and re-growth cycle, and posits the tree symbolizes ever-changing existence.[13] John Lindow points out that Yggdrasil is described as rotting on one side and as being chewed on by four harts and Níðhöggr, and that, according to the account in _Gylfaginning_, it also bears verbal hostility in the fauna it supports. Lindow adds that "in the sagas, a person who helps stir up or keep feuds alive by ferrying words of malice between the participants is seldom one of high status, which may explain the assignment of this role in the mythology to a relatively insignificant animal".[14]

Richard W. Thorington Jr. and Katie Ferrell theorize that "the role of Ratatosk probably derived from the habit of European tree squirrels (_Sciurus vulgaris_) to give a scolding alarm call in response to danger. It takes little imagination for you to think that the squirrel is saying nasty things about you."[15]
