FRANK MERTENS (born FRANK SORGATZ on 26 October 1961), is a German former musician. He is a former member of the German synth-pop group Alphaville.[1]

He is known for playing the melody lines on keyboards. Personality wise, he was a shy and quiet person who doesn't like to talk.[2]

Shortly after the success of their debut album, he left the band in December 1984, because he had a stress with the public attention.[3]

After he left, he founded the group "Lonely Boys" with his girlfriend at the time Matine Lille (real name: Martina Richter) and Felix Lille (real name: Felix Schulte), But, in 1987 he disbanded the group and studied economics (finished in 1990).[4]

In 1991, Mertens moved to Paris where he studied art (self study) in order to complete his project and back to Cologne, Germany in 1996 where he works as a plastic artist and lives reclusive.[5]

During the same year, he started but never completed a musical project called _Maelstrom_, which was a combination of ambient-style music, impressionistic and colorful art in the form of paintings, sculptures and etheric poetry.[6]
