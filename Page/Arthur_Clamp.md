ARTHUR CLAMP (1 May 1884 – 19 September 1918) was an English professional football centre half who made over 270 appearances in the Football League for Notts County.[1][2] As a player, "he possessed remarkable stamina and above all, excelled as a breaker-up of combination".[3]


Personal life

Clamp worked as a bricklayer and was married with children.[4] In April 1918, during the final year of the First World War, Clamp was called up to serve as a private in the British Army.[5] After a period with the Sherwood Foresters, he was transferred to the Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) after his arrival in France.[6] Within three days of his arrival in the trenches, he was seriously wounded during the Second Battle of the Somme.[7][8] Clamp was evacuated to Britain, where he died in Stoke-on-Trent Military Hospital on 19 September 1918.[9] He was buried with military honours in Church Cemetery, Nottingham.[10]
