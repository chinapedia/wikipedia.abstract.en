"REVOLUTION" was the title given to the May 2000 revamp of Marvel Comics' X-Men-related comic books, timed to coincide with the publication of _X-Men_ vol. 2 #100.


Publication history

In each series, the "Revolution" issue represented a jump of six months after the previous issue's events. In most cases, "Revolution" also marked an attempt to send each title in a new creative direction, and to this end new creative teams were assigned to the titles. Many characters' costumes were redesigned, and a "Revolution" logo was printed along the right-hand side of each issue.

The most publicized of the changes was the return of writer Chris Claremont to the flagship titles _X-Men_ vol. 2 and _Uncanny X-Men_, after nearly a decade's absence.

The event also included nods to early-1990s marketing strategies such as printing variant covers[1] and including trading cards.[2]

The excitement of the event was dampened by Marvel Comics' timing, as most of the series involved had launched with all or part of their new creative teams a month before the event, even though the "Revolution" logo was still printed on the May issues, and _Uncanny X-Men_ did not join the "Revolution" event until its June 2000 issue. Furthermore, Claremont stated in later interviews that he had ghostwritten several issues of various X-Men titles before the event.

Counter-X

Furthermore, three of the titles involved in the event, (_X-Man_, _X-Force_, and _Generation X_), were rebranded to COUNTER-X. Writer Warren Ellis plotted the general direction for each of the COUNTER-X books, and co-wrote each title with Steven Grant on _X-Man_, Ian Edginton on _X-Force_, and Brian Wood on _Generation X_.

Aftermath

The "Revolution" event was poorly received by fans and critics, leading to Claremont leaving _X-Men_ and _Uncanny X-Men_ after nine months. The X-Men line of books were revamped again in July 2001 with Grant Morrison writing _New X-Men_, Joe Casey writing _Uncanny X-Men_, and Claremont writing the new title _X-Treme X-Men_.
