Release

_Our Time Will Come_ premiered on June 21, 2017 at the 2017 Shanghai International Film Festival. The film was originally announced during the 2017 Cannes Film Festival in May as the Shanghai festival's opening film, but its opening spot was replaced on June 9 by _The Chinese Widow_, directed by Bille August.[4] Although no reason has been given by the festival, Clarence Tsui writing for the _South China Morning Post_ assumed that this less to do with the content of Ann Hui's film and more to do with August's film, also set during World War II, being "an even better fit for China’s national narrative right now", having an acclaimed Danish director directing a romantic story between a local woman in the Zhejiang province and a US fighter pilot and being the first film completed after the signing of China and Denmark's co-production treaty on May 3.[5]
