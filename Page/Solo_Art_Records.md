SOLO ART RECORDS is a U.S. based record label and was purchased by Rudi Blesh and Harriet Janis from the original owner in 1946 and run alongside their Circle label. It had issued recordings of solo jazz and blues piano on 78s. The label was sold with the Circle label to the _GEORGE H. BUCK JR. JAZZ FOUNDATION INC._, located in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1979.

Since George Buck's acquisition the Solo Art label has remained dedicated to the presentation of solo performances of great jazz and blues pianists, now from the 1940s to the present.
