Biography

Birth–2009

Natalie Lauren Sims was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma during 1984, and raised there as the daughter of Charles Sims, Jr.[1][2][3] She started writing hip hop music, when she was 11, while she became a Christian at age 14.[4][5] Sims graduated from high school in 2002, soon thereafter starting her music career.[6] Sims relocated from Tampa to Atlanta, Georgia in 2007. In 2008, she met Iggy Azalea — who was still working under her birth name, Amethyst Kelly — and the two shared studio space with the producers FKi and Jon Jon Traxx.[7] However, Sims and Azalea subsequently lost touch when Azalea moved to Los Angeles in 2010.[8] In 2009, Sims, under the moniker Suzy Rock, released a mixtape entitled _So What_.[9][10] She also featured on the song "Runaway Train" by Rachel, from the album _Nothing W/O You_.[11]

2010–11

In 2010, Sims collaborated on the Lecrae album _Rehab_, featuring on the song "High", also featuring Sho Baraka, and co-wrote and provided backing vocals to the song "Killa."[12][13] That same year, she designed the cover to Deitrick Haddon's soundtrack album _Blessed & Cursed_ _- Voices of Unity_, which included her song "So What".[14][15] Sims also provided art direction for Juanita Bynum's album _More Passion_ and creative design for _Thankful_ by Myron Williams.[16] In 2011, Sims wrote for and contributed vocals to _Blacklight_ by Tedashii and _The Good Life_ (2012) by Trip Lee,[17] and featured on the song "Fantasy" from the latter album.[18] She also featured on the single "Hello" from KB's forthcoming album _Weight & Glory_ (2012),[19] an album to which she also contributed some song-writing.[20] She also featured on two songs by Pro, "Get In" from _PSA Vol. 2_ and "Drink from His Cup" from _Dying to Live_,[21][22] the song "Survivor" by Da' T.R.U.T.H. from his album _The Whole Truth_,[23] the "Battle Song" by Lecrae from his album _Rehab: The Overdose,_[24] and Canon's song "Poppin' Off" from the album _Blind World._[25] Additionally, that year Sims co-founded the hip hop group High Society, along with Sho Baraka, J.R., and Swoope.[26] The group released its first single, "One Moment", on June 20,[27] and a second single, "Devil", on October 31, 2011.[28]

2012–13

In 2012, Sims released a music and teaching series called _Dirty Little Secrets_,[29][30] and featured on Lecrae's mixtape _Church Clothes_ and contributed song-writing to his album _Gravity_,[31][32] and provided graphic design for the Deitrick Haddon soundtrack from _A Beautiful Soul_.[33] High Society released its debut album, _Circa MMXI – The Collective_, on January 17,[34][35][36] and a third, non-album single, "Young Again", on February 14.[37]

While scheduled to tour with Tedashii and KB, Sims was contacted by Shawna Peezy, the manager for Iggy Azalea, requesting that she fly to Wales in order to help Azalea write _The New Classic_ (2014). Sims was initially hesitant to take the offer, as she would have to cut her tour short, and felt uncomfortable with the risqué content put out by Azalea.[38] However, she then received a call from Sarah Stennett from the London-based management team Turn First Artists. Stennett explained that her company was trying to commercialize Azalea's image. Sims understood this to mean a less provocative and explicit approach, and, hoping to be a more positive influence on Azalea's content, abandoned the last four stops on her tour and flew over to Wales in December.[39]

After a short break in the United States for Christmas, Sims flew to London for a second session. She later wrote of her experience that "Fresh out of a breakup and depressed I spent a month in London in a small 10X10 studio somedays writing and writing and writing… Eating cottage pie. The first song we finished was Work. Regardless of whether or not u like the content the song told Iggy’s true story of struggle sacrifice and hard work as an artist."[40][41] Sims contributed to five songs that appeared on the album: "Work", "Bounce", "Change Your Life", "Just Askin'", and "New Bitch" – which had the working title "New Chick".[42] "Work" sold over one million copies in the US and was certified platinum,[43][44] while "Change Your Life" sold over 500,000 copies and was certified gold.[45] Sims later expressed regret at the final product of her writing sessions with Azalea, stating that "I wasted an opportunity to make music that matters. Not on every song, but a few. I squandered three minutes and 45 seconds contributing to the over-saturation of materialism, image obsession and a whole bunch of random, pointless stuff."[46]

In 2013, Sims dropped her stage name Suzy Rock, choosing instead to perform as Natalie Lauren.[47] She appeared under the name Suzy Rock on "Chapter 7: Denzel" on _Talented 10th_ by Sho Baraka,[48] and as Natalie Lauren on a compilation album, _Gurl Code_, specifically as a featured artist on the song "Made for This" by Butta P.[49] _Gurl Code_ was released on October 22, 2013 through Full Ride Music, a record label run by the rapper Thi'sl, and consisted of performances by various female Christian hip hop artists.[50][51][52] In 2013, Natalie Lauren also began working with KB and the production team Cobra, which consists of Joseph Prielozny and Dirty Rice, on the EP _100_.[53] The four had previously worked together on the song "Open Letter (Battlefield)" from KB's album _Weight & Glory_.[54]

2014–present

Sims' work with KB and Cobra continued through 2014, when the four traveled to Cape Town, South Africa to record KB's second studio album, _Tomorrow We Live_ (2015).[55][56] She also signed a deal with Kobalt Music Group as a songwriter and partnered with Reach Records as a creative director of A&R.[57][58] During the month of April in 2014, Sims launched a project called Red Eyes and Blue Skies, designed primarily as a cancer awareness project.[59] A website was debuted, and an EP, _Red Eyes & Blue Skies_, was released in two parts during Cancer Awareness Week, a national event in the United States.[60][61][62] On October 23, 2014, Sims released her third EP, entitled _Cliff Notes_, as a free download.[63][64][65] It features a collection of love stories, some based on Sims' own life experiences.[66][67] She also created webcast series Mic Mondays, in which she discusses various aspects of the music industry, for the website and art community Forth District.[68][69] She also featured on and provided song-writing to Tedashii's _Below Paradise_,[70] Trip Lee's _Rise_,[71] Swoope's _Sinema_,[72] and Jackie Hill-Perry's _The Art of Joy_,[73] and co-wrote "SuperDave" for Christon Gray's _School of Roses_ album.[74] In 2015, Sims contributed to Chris Brown's _Royalty_ album, co-writing the song "Blow It in the Wind",[75][76] and co-wrote the Keke Palmer single "I Don't Belong to You".[77] She and KB also announced that they are working as an A&R team, and that they are advising and producing for Joseph Solomon.[78] In the fall of 2015, Sims appeared as a guest artist on the Queens United Tour, an all-female tour by V. Rose, HillaryJane, Jasmine Le'Shea and DJ KB.[79] On October 30, 2015, Sims featured with Jackie Hill-Perry on the DJ KB song "Queens".[80] On May 20, 2016, she featured on the album _It's Complicated_ by Da' T.R.U.T.H., specifically on the songs "Mixed Signals" and "Perfectly Human".[81][82]
