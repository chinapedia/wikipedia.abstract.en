_FIGURE & SPIRIT_ is an album by American jazz saxophonist Lee Konitz recorded in 1976 and released on the Progressive label.[1][2][3]


Critical reception

Scott Yanow on Allmusic said "although there are a few minor mistakes, the music is quite exciting and spontaneous. Brown was the best possible substitute for Wayne Marsh (Konitz's original choice for the record) and sounds in prime form. It's worth acquiring by fans of straight-ahead jazz".[4]
