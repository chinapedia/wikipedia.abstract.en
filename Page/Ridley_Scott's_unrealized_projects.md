Ripley's going to be somebody's daughter, obviously. We're coming in from the back end. The time constraints of what's the time between this film, where we leave David going off heading for that colony, I think you're probably two films out from even considering her."[157] According to reports, there will be only one additional prequel film (_Alien: Awakening_) before a soft reboot is made to the _Alien_ universe, consisting of a new series of films with brand-new and original characters as well as a new setting.[158] In the audio commentary for _Alien: Covenant_, Scott confirmed that a sequel to _Alien: Covenant_, tentatively referred to as _Alien: Covenant 2_, is being written by John Logan, with Fassbender, Waterston, and McBride reprising their roles. Scott also confirmed that the film will cap his prequel series, leading directly into the events of _Alien_.[159][160]

Michael Nordine, writing for Indiewire in October 2017, quoted Ridley Scott stating that _Alien: Covenant 2_ will focus more on the androids and A.I.s as opposed to the xenomorphs. Scott said, "I think the evolution of the Alien himself is nearly over, but what I was trying to do was transcend and move to another story, which would be taken over by A.I.s. The world that the A.I. might create as a leader if he finds himself on a new planet. We have actually quite a big layout for the next one."[164]

In November 2018, _Empire_ magazine announced that the film would take place on LV-426, with the extra-terrestrial Engineers being featured in the film and being in pursuit of David following his nefarious actions against Planet 4.[165]
