NGUYỄN LƯU HẢI ĐĂNG (, 1965 – ?), nickname MASTER ƯU (優老爺), is a Vietnamese wuxia novelist.[1][2][3]


Biography

Ưu Đàm Hoa's background remains a mystery that the wuxia fans have always wanted to uncover. He made his literary debut in the end of 1990s, but not until 2010 did some of the readers close to the publishing expose his real name as NGUYỄN LƯU HẢI ĐĂNG (阮劉海燈), who resides in Bình Thạnh district (Saigon). He was born on 25 July 1965 in Sihanoukville of Cambodia, however his family fled to Hà Tiên after the Coup of 1970.

Having been interested in Jin Yong's wuxia stories growing up, he tried to write some stories when he was 17 but hardly achieved any accomplishment. Before seriously pursuing literature, he has undertaken different jobs with unstable income. He considered adrift fates of characters in _The smiling, China_ the reflection of his impoverished life, especially Nam Cung Giao.

Between 1992 and 1993, Nguyễn Lưu Hải Đăng listened to his friend and gave up his job at printing firm as well as the eau de rose style to permanently move to another genre known as journey wuxia. In the beginning, he chose CỐ GIANG TỬ (故江子), THẠNH NHƠN (盛人), TAM MỸ (三美), HẢI NGUYỆT (海月), ĐỜ ĂNG ĐĂNG... as his pennames. Later on, he decided to use the name ƯU ĐÀM HOA[4] (優曇花) when his first published novel was critically acclaimed.[5]

Until 2015, there have been 30 literary works including novelettes and purely wuxia novels, most of which mention marvelous love affairs, classical references, the beauty of Chinese history and culture. His works usually embedded with verses of Li Shangyin, Li Bai, Du Fu, Bai Juyi, Zhao Ji, Tang Yin, Nalan Xingde... with accumulative narrative in the miraculous setting of Jiangnan : Sometimes presumptuous, sometimes spectacular yet terrified and thrilling during fighting. Sometimes remarkably wise during intelligence struggle, yet delightful in mischievous conversations.[6][7]


Works

Novel makes up the bulk of Nguyễn Lưu Hải Đăng's literary works, whereas poems, novelettes, journals... written as a dedication to his wife and friends remains unprinted. However, there are some drafts that are not meant to be published and he never disclosed the reason. Those manuscripts are stored in a drawer in his son's room and he only opens them at the weekend.
