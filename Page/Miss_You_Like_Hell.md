_MISS YOU LIKE HELL_ is a musical with book and lyrics by Quiara Alegría Hudes, and music and lyrics by Erin McKeown. The show follows a troubled teenage girl who embarks on a cross-country road trip with her estranged mother, who is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico.

The musical premiered in 2016 at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego.


Background

Quiara Alegría Hudes was first commissioned by Christopher Ashley, Artistic Director to the La Jolla Playhouse, in February 2012 to write a new work after her success with plays such as _In the Heights_ and _Water by the Spoonful_, for which she won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.[1]

Later that year Hudes teamed up with singer/songwriter Erin McKeown and director Lear deBessonet to write a new musical, _Miss You Like Hell_. The show received readings in New York in 2014 and 2015 and a three-week workshop at the La Jolla Playhouse in 2016.[2]
