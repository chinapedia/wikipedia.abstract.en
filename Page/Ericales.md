The ERICALES are a large and diverse order of dicotyledons, including, for example, tea, persimmon, blueberry, Brazil nut, and azalea. The order includes trees, bushes, lianas, and herbaceous plants. Together with ordinary autophytic plants, the Ericales include chlorophyll-deficient mycoheterotrophic plants (e.g., _Sarcodes sanguinea_) and carnivorous plants (e.g., genus _Sarracenia_).

Many species have five petals, often grown together. Fusion of the petals as a trait was traditionally used to place the order in the subclass Sympetalae.[1]

Mycorrhiza is an interesting property, frequently associated with the Ericales. Indeed, symbiosis with root fungi is quite common among the order representatives, and three kinds of it can be found exclusively among Ericales (namely, ericoid, arbutoid and monotropoid mycorrhiza). In addition, some families among the order are notable for their exceptional ability to accumulate aluminum.[2]

Ericales are a cosmopolitan order. Areas of distribution of families vary largely - while some are restricted to tropics, others exist mainly in Arctic or temperate regions. The entire order contains over 8,000 species, of which the Ericaceae account for 2,000-4,000 species (by various estimates).


Economic importance

The most commercially used plant in the order is tea (_Camellia sinensis_) from the Theaceae family. The order also includes some edible fruits, including kiwifruit (_Actinidia deliciosa_), persimmon (genus _Diospyros_), blueberry, huckleberry, cranberry, Brazil nut, and Mamey sapote. The order also includes shea (_Vitellaria paradoxa_), which is the major dietary lipid source for millions of sub-Saharan Africans. Many Ericales species are cultivated for their showy flowers: well-known examples are azalea, rhododendron, camellia, heather, polyanthus, cyclamen, phlox, and busy Lizzie.


Classification

These families are recognized in the APG III system[3] as members of the Ericales:

-   Family Actinidiaceae (kiwifruit family)
-   Family Balsaminaceae (balsam family)Balsam_I_IMG_9566.jpg'' from the Balsaminaceae ]]
-   Family Clethraceae (clethra family)
-   Family Cyrillaceae (cyrilla family)
-   Family Diapensiaceae
-   Family Ebenaceae (ebony and persimmon family)
-   Family Ericaceae (heath, rhododendron, and blueberry family)
-   Family Fouquieriaceae (ocotillo family)
-   Family Lecythidaceae (Brazil nut family)
-   Family Marcgraviaceae
-   Family Mitrastemonaceae
-   Family Pentaphylacaceae
-   Family Polemoniaceae (phlox family)
-   Family Primulaceae (primrose and snowbell family) Primula_rosea_I_IMG_7210.jpg'' from the Primulaceae ]]
-   Family Roridulaceae
-   Family Sapotaceae (sapodilla family)
-   Family Sarraceniaceae (American pitcher plant family)
-   Family Sladeniaceae
-   Family Styracaceae (silverbell family)
-   Family Symplocaceae (sapphireberry family)
-   Family Tetrameristaceae
-   Family Theaceae (tea and camellia family)

These families are not recognized in the APG III system[4] but have been in common use in the recent past:

-   Family Myrsinaceae (cyclamen and scarlet pimpernel family) → Primulaceae
-   Family Pellicieraceae → Tetrameristaceae
-   Family Maesaceae → Primulaceae
-   Family Ternstroemiaceae → Pentaphylacaceae
-   Family Theophrastaceae → Primulaceae

These make up a basal group of asterids.[5] Under the Cronquist system, the Ericales included a smaller group of plants, which were placed among the Dilleniidae:

-   Family Ericaceae
-   Family Cyrillaceae
-   Family Clethraceae
-   Family Grubbiaceae
-   Family Empetraceae
-   Family Epacridaceae
-   Family Pyrolaceae
-   Family Monotropaceae
