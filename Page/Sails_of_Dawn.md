SAILS OF DAWN is an ocean racing yacht and cruising yacht, one of the last boats John Laurent Giles saw launched before his death in 1969.[1][2] It was built to Lloyds 100A1 certification, while being also under Royal Ocean Racing Club certification and also to Lloyds 100A1 for the owner DD Morell of Mitchell Construction.

Only three yards in Britain submitted tenders for the build, others stating the quality unattainable in the time-frame , and so it was down to two yards, McGruer of Clynder and Robertsons yard. McGruers were chosen for the price of 48,000 British pounds plus 8% design fees to Laurent Giles.[3]
