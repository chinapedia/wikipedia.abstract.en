DIONYSE MCTAIR (born 1950) is a writer in Trinidad and Tobago.

She was born in Port of Spain and received a sociology degree from the University of the West Indies. McTair has taught sociology in a secondary school in Trinidad.[1] She is an instructor in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics at the University of the West Indies.[2]

Her first collection of poetry _Notes Toward an Escape from Death_ was published in 1987. Her work has appeared in various publications including _Caribbean Quarterly_, _Savacou_ and _Callaloo_. For McTair, the sound of her words is as important as their meaning; she believes that her poems represent a search "for personhood, of being in the world, on the planet, not just being in a black body or a woman's body".[3]
