[2] Standard chronicles _Hmannan_ (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 434) and _Maha Yazawin_ (Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 304) say Swa Saw Ke appointed Min Nemi in 760 ME (29 March 1398 to 28 March 1399). But the Taungoo chronicle _Toungoo Yazawin_ (Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 25â€“26) says Nemi assumed office in 761 ME (29 March 1399 to 27 March 1400). It appears that Min Nemi's appointment occurred in late 760 ME (January to March 1399) and Min Nemi arrived at the city in early 761 ME (March to April 1399).
