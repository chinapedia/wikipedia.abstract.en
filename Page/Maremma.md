Sunflowers_in_bloom_-_Maremma_Toscana_-_Italy_-_25_June_2005.jpg The MAREMMA (, ; from Latin , "maritime [land]") is a coastal area of western central Italy, bordering the Tyrrhenian Sea. It includes much of south-western Tuscany and part of northern Lazio. It was formerly mostly marshland, often malarial, but was drained by order of Fernando I de' Medici.

It was traditionally populated by the _butteri_, mounted cattle herders who rode horses fitted with one of two distinctive styles of saddle, the _scafarda_ and the _bardella_.

Animal breeds

The Maremma has given rise to, or given its name to, several breeds of domestic animal. These include two breeds of working horse, the Maremmano and the Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale, formerly used by _butteri_ and _cavalcanti_; the Maremmana breed of large grey cattle; the Maremmano breed of shepherd's guard-dog; and the Macchiaiola Maremmana breed of small pig, so named because it was kept extensively, left to roam in the woodland.
