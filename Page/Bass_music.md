BASS MUSIC (also called UK BASS or POST-DUBSTEP[1][2]) is an umbrella term for club music that emerged in the United Kingdom during the mid-2000s under the influence of diverse genres such as dubstep, UK garage, R&B, wonky, house, and grime.[3] The phrase "bass music" came into use as artists began ambiguously blending the sounds of these defined genres while maintaining an emphasis on percussive, bass-led rhythm.[4]


Origins

The breadth of styles that have come to be associated with the term preclude it from being a specific musical genre. _Pitchfork_ writer Martin Clark has suggested that "well-meaning attempts to loosely define the ground we're covering here are somewhat futile and almost certainly flawed. This is not one genre. However, given the links, interaction, and free-flowing ideas ... you can't dismiss all these acts as unrelated."[5] Dubstep producer Skream is quoted in an interview with _The Independent_ in September 2011 as saying:

  The word dubstep is being used by a lot of people and there were a lot of people being tagged with the dubstep brush. They don't want to be tagged with it and shouldn't be tagged with it – that's not what they're pushing... When I say 'UK bass', it's what everyone UK is associated with so it would be a lot easier if it was called that."[6]

In the United Kingdom, bass music, or UK bass has had major mainstream success since the late 2000s and early 2010s, with artists such as James Blake,[7] Benga, Example, Burial, Zomby,[8] Chase & Status, Skream, TNGHT and Wretch 32.[9] The term "post-dubstep" has been used synonymously to refer to artists, such as Blake, Mount Kimbie and Fantastic Mr. Fox whose work drew on UK garage, 2-step, and other forms of underground dance music, as well as ambient music and early R&B.[10][11][12][13][14] Outside of nightclubs, bass music has mainly been promoted and played on internet radio stations such as Sub.FM and Rinse FM.[15][16]
