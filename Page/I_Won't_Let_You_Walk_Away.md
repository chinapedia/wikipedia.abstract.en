"I WON'T LET YOU WALK AWAY" is a song recorded by American DJs Mako and singer Madison Beer. It was released on Feb 24, 2015, via Ultra Records.[1][2]


Background

The song is a vocal version of the instrumental single by Mako called "Sunburst" released in 2014.[3] Alex Seaver of Mako said in an interview "I had bought this $45 Fender guitar in Glendale and just started tracking some stuff, and that turned into “Sunburst” — the instrumental. We put that up just as a nice, fun summer tune and everybody was just like we want to hear a vocal over it. We had never considered it. The second they said it, it seemed like, 'Oh, this would be a great idea'. Why not? We knew what kind of song we wanted at that point, because the track sounds a certain way. As soon as we got Madison on it, it came to life really easily because the sound is perfect for her voice, for the style, the writing and the track. It was just a great fit.".[4]
