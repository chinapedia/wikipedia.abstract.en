Ties with Fuller Theological Seminary

Charles E. Fuller joined Lake Avenue Church in 1933 and became friends with the Senior Pastor James Henry Hutchins, a graduate of the Moody Bible Institute. Hutchins kept the church away from the Liberal Christianity that was common in Congregationalism at the time.[5] According to C. Peter Wagner, Fuller had some classes at LACC Educational unit and many members of the Fuller faculty and some Board Members were members of the church, including Wagner himself who would be ordained by the church's denomination.[6]
