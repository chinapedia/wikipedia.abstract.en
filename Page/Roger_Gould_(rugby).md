Former Australian five-eighth Mark Ella writes in _Path to Victory_ that:

Former Australian coach Alan Jones has called Gould the best player he ever coached. In _Wallaby Gold: The History of Australian Test Rugby_ Jones is recorded as saying that, "...my best player, I think, was Roger Gould. If your defensive line is going to hold up, the opposition are going to roof it, and you've just got to have someone who's absolutely rock-solid. Gould was a flawless. He was a freak. He did did wonderful things."

In _Ella: The Definitive Biography_ Alan Jones is documented as saying:

Former Australian flanker Simon Poidevin in _For Love Not Money_ wrote of Gould that, 'I say emphatically here and now that Gould is the best fullback I’ve ever played with or against, and I’d never leave him out of any side for which he was available. As a fullback, he was without peer.'

Former Australian dual-international Michael O'Connor in _The Best of Both Worlds_ wrote of Gould that, 'The fact is, Roger Gould is the best fullback I’ve ever played with. He would take the bomb ninety-nine times out of one hundred and he wouldn’t just take it, he would hurt people while he was doing it. Usually, you feel confident about creaming a fullback taking a high ball, but if you tried it with Roger, you would end up with six studs in your face. He was so strong and aggressive. He put his foot up and he just couldn’t be moved.’[3]

In _Path to Victory_ rugby writer Terry Smith describes Gould thus:
