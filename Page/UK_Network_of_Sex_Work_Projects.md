UK NETWORK OF SEX WORK PROJECTS (UKNSWP) is an umbrella organisation that represents sex work projects in the UK,[1] both agencies or individuals working with sex workers.[2] It facilitates networking between those it represents, so as to share good practice about providing quality support services for sex workers.[3] It is a charity based in Manchester.

In July 2012 UKNSWP launched the National Ugly Mugs (NUM) scheme, a third party reporting system for sex workers that issues alerts to sex workers via their smartphone, and feeds intelligence to police, aiming to reduce offending by dangerous serial sexual offenders.[4]

It was one of five winners of the Guardian Charity Awards 2014.[5]

National Ugly Mugs (NUM)

UKNSWP runs National Ugly Mugs (NUM), a third party reporting system for sex workers that issues alerts to sex workers via their smartphone, and feeds intelligence to police, aiming to reduce offending by dangerous serial sexual offenders.[7][8][9][10][11]

The National Ugly Mugs (NUM) Pilot Scheme was announced by the UK government in December 2011, with £108,000 provided by the Home Office "to establish a national online network to collate and distribute information between ‘Ugly Mugs’ schemes in local areas."[12] Though funded by the Home Office, it is managed independently by UKNSWP.[13][14] The initial pilot scheme went live in Manchester on 6 July 2012[15] and by 2016 was undergoing a larger pilot in London.[16]
