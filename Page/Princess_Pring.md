History

The franchise was created by Loco Entertainment in 2012 with funding from the Korea Creative Content Agency as part of both the "New Character Business Support" and "Character Life Project" for a variety of character goods such as toys, plush toys, publishing and cutlery. It also received praise in the Seoul Character Licensing Fair in 2013 and 2014.[4] In December 31, 2014, KBS Kids aired a special based on the series[5] and, in May 2015, investments from KTH were made for funding a full series.[6] The series was later made and broadcast on KBS1 from December 19, 2015 to July 16, 2016. The animated series, which is animated purely in CGI, is in the style of a musical adventure, with songs composed by Hwang Gun-dan of ButterFly music studios, with the music played by a real orchestra. Producer Yang Hyeon-jin has explained that both music and animation synergize together in the series to reflect the tone of each scene.[7]

Animax Korea also aired the series in South Korea in 2016. The series's second season was officially announced, and will be released in 2018.
