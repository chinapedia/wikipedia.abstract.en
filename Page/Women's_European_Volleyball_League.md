The WOMEN'S EUROPEAN VOLLEYBALL LEAGUE is a continental volleyball competition for senior women's national volleyball teams of Europe, organized by the European Volleyball Confederation (CEV). Created in 2009, the competition served as a qualifying tournament for the FIVB World Grand Prix (until 2017) and to its successor the FIVB Nations League since 2018.

This event should not be confused with the other, more prestigious, continental competition for European national volleyball teams, the European Volleyball Championship.
