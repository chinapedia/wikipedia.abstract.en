Rose_Marasco_Self_Portrait.jpg ROSE MARASCO (born December 25, 1948), is an American photographer. She is Distinguished Professor Emerita at the University of Southern Maine, and is thought to be Maine’s “most prolific photographer,” living and working there since 1979.[1]


Biography

Rose Marasco grew up in Utica, New York. She studied photography in college, first at Syracuse University, where she earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts (1969-1971) and later at the Visual Studies Workshop in Rochester, New York (1988-1991) where she completed her Master of Fine Arts under Nathan Lyons, and was mentored by Frank Gohlke, who would later write the introduction to a catalog for an exhibition of her Maine Grange Halls series.[2]

Marasco has been an exhibited artist since 1971 with twenty-three solo shows and more than sixty group shows. She developed the photography program at the University of Southern Maine, and taught there for 35 years, retiring in 2014. She also initiated a program at Munson Williams Proctor Arts Institute, in Utica in 1974, and gives lectures in the US and abroad.[3]

A major solo exhibition of the series “Domestic Objects: Past and Presence” was held by the University of Southern Maine in 2004[4] and was accompanied by a book listed by Photoeye as “a ten year retrospective of Marasco's lush large format cibachrome photographs on the poetics of everyday household objects.” [5] In 2015 The Portland Museum of Art mounted a major retrospective of her work, organized by PMA Chief Curator Jessica May.[6] Describing her method in a review of the exhibition, critic John Yau wrote “Marasco has remained uninterested in genres such as documentary, landscape, and portraiture. Instead, she has consistently mined concepts of framing, point of view, and orientation to make images with a complex relationship to the everyday image of the world.”[7] In 2016 she was awarded the Maine Women's Fund Sarah Orne Jewett Award, given to "a Maine woman who exhibits the attributes of the women in Jewett’s works of fiction: true grit, independence, courage, humor and discipline."[8] She received the 2005 Excellence in Photographic Teaching Award from Santa Fe Center for Photography New Mexico.
