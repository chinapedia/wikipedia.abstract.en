FISCALIZATION is fiscal law designed to avoid retailer fraud. Fiscal law about cash registers has been introduced in countries to control the grey economy by enforcing all mandatory transaction reporting to the authorities. According to fiscal law, an appropriate fiscal receipt has to be printed and given to the customer.[1][2]

The fiscal law mostly cover:

-   how the electronic cash register should work (functions),
-   how the related retail processes should be designed,
-   which data should be saved and how,
-   which reports for the authorities should be created,
-   how and when should reporting be done etc.

In addition, the fiscal law is, in many cases, linked to some other laws like, for example, to laws related to accounting, taxation, consumer protection, data protection and privacy etc.


Basic philosophy

In case of fiscal laws, every government is basically following the same philosophy:

-   the tax (mostly VAT) related data of every transaction should be stored safely in a way that any data manipulation is not possible after transaction is closed

-   the reporting to the authority about stored tax related data should be possible any time and without any data manipulation

Based on this philosophy different governments are defining different regulations that must be implemented in the different areas of the retailer’s environment.

For example, fiscal law in Portugal is specifying that VAT related data are regularly sent to the authority. Based on the data most implementations are done in the ERP system of the retailer (in the Back Office/Accounting). On the other side countries like, for example, Serbia have fiscal laws which force the usage of the fiscal printer. The fiscal printer is saving the VAT related data and is sending the data to the fiscal authority via included special network device. This kind of fiscalization is mostly implemented in the POS application.

In some other countries like, for example, in Austria the transaction data must be signed by a special signature device and the data has to be saved in a special journal database. Typically, this kind of fiscal laws are implemented in the POS application and in the back office.


History

Fiscalization which together with VAT was introduced in order to fight against the grey economy. The first country which introduced fiscal law in regards to the use of specific fiscal devices was Italy, and second one was Greece. Italy introduced this fiscal law in 1983.[3] Introducing fiscal law—particularly about cash registers—came from the need to avoid retailer's frauds. According to fiscal law, an appropriate fiscal receipt has to be printed and given to the customer.[4][5]


Challenges of modern retailing in the fiscal context

Different aspects of fiscalization are creating big challenges

The implementation of the fiscal laws in a particular country is already by itself a complex issue. But if we put it in the context of the modern retailing then it becomes an even more demanding and challenging topic.

As of today, modern retailing means that:

-   Retail concepts are mixed. One retailer has several different store formats. Every format has some or even many different retail processes and every retail process can be influenced by the fiscal law

-   Many different payment methods are used. Payment methods like cash, cards, vouchers, different currencies etc. are usually treated differently by the fiscal law

-   Multichannel retailing is all around. The transactions can be created anytime, anywhere and mostly with different systems. For example, with online shops, POS, Apps etc.

-   Marketing campaigns are very complex. To attract the customer, retailers are getting very creative. They are creating complex promotions with complex discounts. They are, in many cases, strongly influenced by the fiscal law.

-   Retailer are getting more international. At the same time, they are unifying their processes and technology. Yet the fiscal law by country is forcing the usage of certain technologies.


Technical approaches of fiscalization

The technical implementation of the fiscal law is always follows one or more of the following technical aspects:

-   hardware based fiscal implementation

-   software based fiscal implementation

-   special fiscal requirements with different implementations

In addition, the technical implementation itself is also forced by the fiscal law.

Hardware based fiscal implementation

Some fiscal laws define the use of special hardware devices.

These are usually:

-   fiscal printers - receipt printers with special fiscal memory where fiscal data is stored
-   fiscal communication modules – these are devices which are used to send fiscal data to the fiscal authority
-   fiscal memory boards –circuit boards that can be included in or connected to the POS, ECR or printer
-   signature devices – devices that produce digital signatures which are used to secure the fiscal transaction

Most of the fiscal countries in the world today are following the path of hardware-based implementation.

Software based fiscal implementation

This can be a more modern way of implementing the law.

The background is that the law is defines how something has to be done but not which device should be used. This model is more liberal, and it can be expected that in the near future more countries will follow this approach.

Today there are several different scenarios:

-   to send each transaction to the fiscal authority in real time, to get digital signature from the authority and to include it in the transaction.
-   to store every transaction in the database where every entry has a sequence number and a digital signature
-   to save data in special format in special fiscal journal (database)
-   to sign digitally every transaction by a special algorithm

Special fiscal requirements

In some case in addition to these technical implementations, there are some additional technical approaches. They are mostly related to:

-   data security and protection
-   archiving
-   reporting

special business processes (mostly in specialized retailing e.g. petrol stations)

| Austria                | Hardware/Software | At the beginning of 2016, Austria introduced a new fiscal law which consists of the creation of a Fiscal Journal (FJ). A Fiscal Journal should be saved at each POS system, in a central database or in the cloud. The Fiscal Journal, according to Austrian fiscal law has to be written in real-time (at the same time when receipt is created). In addition to the Fiscal Journal, depending on the size of a sales place, it is also necessary to use a special security chip to digitally sign every transaction (except those from a closed system).[7]                                                                                                                                |

Communication with the tax Authority occurs via GPRS.[8]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Poland                 | Hardware          | From 2019, Poland is introducing a new type of fiscalization which implies that fiscal relevant transactions have to be sent to the fiscal authority through Internet for authorization. Accordingly, major novelty is the introduction of the on-line cash registers. However, standard fiscal printers, with paper or electronic copying, as the main fiscal devices, are still not going to history. The plan is to gradually withdraw them from the market and from the practice in general. Obligatory usage of the online printers depends on the particular industry since not all taxpayers will have to start using them in the same moment, in the following couple of years. [15] |

Albania

Albania is fiscal country since 2004. Since early beginning, it was mandatory to use fiscal printer and ECR’s. Through the time the fiscal requirements included also the use of EJ and GPRS. As of today, the fiscal device in Albania includes:

1.  Fiscal cash register/fiscal printer
2.  Fiscal memory
3.  Customer display (optional)
4.  GPRS device

Fiscal printer has its own clock, so time adjustment for daylight changes should be done by POS software (twice a year) - there is no automatic adjustment. All devices have to support Latin and Albanian letters. In case of invoices, the procedure includes a regular fiscal receipt from the fiscal printer but additionally a document not printed from the fiscal printer itself. Also, special criteria for the security, uniqueness and records have to be met.

Austria

Austrian parliament approved a new fiscalization model which came into force January 1, 2016. This was the first part of fiscalization, which includes the creation of a Fiscal Journal (FJ) which has to be saved at each POS, central database or in the cloud. The second part of the new fiscal law is the digital signature of every cash receipt, which will be implemented on April 1, 2017. Austrian fiscal regulation is based on two concepts. The first concept relates to the usage of a digital signature device for every issued receipt and the second to a "closed system" in which an independent audit of company processes and organization is needed. "Closed system" refers to the company that has more than 30 cash registers. But there is one difference between these two concepts - usage of a digital signature device and registration of each POS at a fiscal authority is not mandatory in a "closed system". Advantages of a "closed system" are therefore: signature device, digital certificate and POS registration at the Authority, are not needed. With the new regulations, fiscal law in Austria requires that every POS has a unique number, that has to create and maintain the fiscal totals (created by adding every cash turnover to previews, encoded with AES 256 algorithm). Based on tax information from the transaction, the POS has to create a barcode, QR Code or OCR code on the receipt. At the end of each year, the special fiscal receipt has to be printed and saved for the authority and every retailer has to keep it for seven years.

Bosnia and Herzegovina

Fiscal law which was implemented at the end of 2010 in Bosnia and Herzegovina implies recording every single transaction of fiscal devices. Communication with the tax administration is done via GPRS.

Bulgaria

The changes to the fiscal law in Bulgaria, based on fiscal device from 2006, have been done in September 2018. They brought with them new regulations to the fiscal devices that previously did not exist:

1.  The data exchange with the TA (NRA) and certain problematic situations that may occur and in which the FD has to automatically perform certain actions
2.  USN that has to be supported not only by the POS SW but also the FD
3.  QR codes that have to be printed on all fiscal receipts so the fiscal device must support printing of QR codes

All devices have to comply to the new regulation and therefore go through a new Homologation process. Bulgarian Metrology Institute is the place where the producers and distributers submit their devices in order to get approval for devices that will be present on the Bulgarian market. Initially the deadline for introducing new FD was planned for the 01.04.2019.but it was extended. The new deadline for the introduction of complying FD (that work with POS SW) is the end of September 2019.

Croatia

New fiscal law in Croatia, as a concept of controlling businesses and their turnover, has become a reality since January 1, 2013. Although Italy was the first country which introduced law for the use of specific fiscal devices (which happened in 1983), Republic of Croatia is one of the first countries in the world with a type of fiscalization which requires that fiscal relevant transactions have to be sent to the fiscal authority through the Internet for authorization. Implementation of the new type of fiscalization in the Republic of Croatia was very fast. The technical specification was done in October 2012 and the new law implemented only three months later. Software manufacturers were not very optimistic about this new fiscalization concept, especially because of the short period of time for implementation. But the new fiscal law debuted January 1, 2013.

According to the law:

1.  Each receipt has to be printed
2.  Each receipt has to be sent to the Tax Authority
3.  Communication is done via Internet connection
4.  The tax authority server returns data such as: amounts, income taxes, unique cashier number (OIB), payment information.

Germany

The first fundamental step towards ensuring the immutability of the cash register data was the law on the protection against manipulation of digital basic records (so-called "Kassengesetz"), which was promulgated at the end of 2016. After that there were several law changes which are regulating the complete fiscal environment such as:

1.  regulation from 01.01.2017. - all transaction data have to be saved complete, chronologically, unchanged (original values) and in that way that manipulation of data is not possible,
2.  new audit rules from 01.01.2018.

All of them have to be respected and they may have an impact on integration of security system in future. Rule to use security system TSE, that is the most important rule, is mandatory from 01.01.2020. The finalization of the implementation should be 31.12.2022.

From 01.01.2020 every POS has to use security system (TSE) and every POS and TSE have to be reported and registered at tax authority. TSE, which is the base of fiscalisation, consist of:

1.  security module
2.  secured memory
3.  interface (API)

Major functionality of TSE is to provide signing of data in order to prevent any manipulations in data base. That means that each receipt will be provided with an electronic signature, but the signature itself, according to current understanding, won’t be printed on receipt itself.

Not influenced by the new fiscal law are:

1.  Ticket issuing systems
2.  Accounting solutions
3.  Vending machines
4.  ATM machines
5.  Taxi solutions
6.  Slot machines
7.  E - shops are also excluded from new rules

Hungary

The general principle of the fiscalization system in Hungary includes the whole solution which is used in the store for creating and issuing of receipts. The authorities have set up the requirements standard which absolutely minimizes the possibilities for different types of tax fraud which can happen in the cash register environment. Practically, the system implies the following:

1.  Certification of the entire fiscal solution which includes the POS software and the fiscal printer with the customer display as a whole,
2.  Tests and the certification procedure demand interaction with fiscal entities in the country,
3.  All-inclusive documentation must be provided to the authorities for certification purposes between which the documentation describing all functions, methods of usage and layouts of fiscal and non-fiscal documents must be provided on Hungarian language,
4.  Strict handling of integration of the POS software with the printer in regards to e.g. error handling and mandatory functionalities,
5.  Transaction data are communicated with authorities in real time, automatically, by a communication module which is attached to the printer, via GSM network.

During the recording of sales itself, there are several procedures which must be conducted, such as the following:

1.  before beginning of each document, existence of pairing between the POS application and the fiscal printer must be checked,
2.  it must be possible to read the status of the communication module called AEE by the POS application before start of each transaction and at every item scanning,
3.  the printer must record every POS turn ON and OFF event,
4.  as a built-in function in the POS application there must be a function for querying and presenting the used version of the POS application on the operator display, at all times.

Important to notice is the obligation to support 4 modes regarding currencies which are related to the transition process of switching gradually from mandatory and optional accepting of the domestic currency called Forint to the Euro. Furthermore, one more example of a strict requirement is the fact that deposit handling for bottles has to be implemented in a predefined way, no matter the nature of the retailer.

Montenegro

Every fiscal device must have a record number which is a unique number that is entered in the fiscal memory of the fiscal cash register, and serves to identify the tax cash registers. The fiscal account in particular contains the following information:

1.  The name of the taxpayer and the name and address of sale
2.  Users PIB
3.  The amount of tax at the tax rates
4.  Total amount of taxes
5.  Day, month, year, hour and minute of fiscal receipt issue

Fiscal receipt is printed in two copies, one of which is issued to the buyer, and the other remains on the control bar. Every sales location is obliged to print a daily report at the end of the day. A taxpayer who works 24 hours per day is required to print a daily report once during 24 hours. The taxpayer is obliged to keep printed daily reports in chronological order in the book of daily reports. The book of daily reports shall be kept separately for each cash register.

Poland

Fiscalization was firstly introduced in Poland in 1993. As a hardware type of fiscalization, it was based on usage of two types of fiscal devices (fiscal printer and electronic cash registers). Both electronic and paper journals were allowed.

The latest fiscalization changes have happened during the first half of 2018. One of the major novelties is the introduction of the on-line cash registers - devices that send data on registered sales to the information system maintained by the National Tax Administration. As in other online fiscalization systems, the characteristic of communication with the authorities is required for analytical and control purposes needed to the state. However, with the law changes, currently available fiscal printers, as the main fiscal devices, still won’t go to history. The plan is to gradually withdraw them from the market and from practice in general. The introduction of the online cash registers itself does not automatically impose an obligation of replacement of the old devices to the new ones. At least, not for now, and not for all taxpayers in the same moment. The set timeframes for particular industries are the following:

1.  January 1st, 2020 for fuel sales, vehicle repair and vulcanization services;
2.  July 1st, 2020 for catering industry, short-term accommodation services, coal sales;
3.  January 1st, 2021 for construction industry, hairdressing services, medical care services provided by doctors and dentists, legal services.

Besides the online registration of sales, there are also a couple of adjustments referring to the layout of the receipts. For example, the header is going to have a defined and structured layout; QR code must be printable for every fiscal receipt; list of payment medias possible to be recorded by the printer has been expanded, etc.

Romania

Romania is fiscal country since 1999. Type of fiscalization is hardware based, and main novelties related to the latest law changes from November are:

1.  Communication and data exchange with ANAF
2.  Electronic journal (no paper journal)
3.  Data backup
4.  New data on receipt layout
5.  More item information
6.  Fiscalized invoice with customer data and customer tax ID (CIF)
7.  Additional VAT rates
8.  Additional payment types

This means introduction of new specification for the communication and data exchange between ANAF (National Agency for Fiscal Administration) and fiscal printer. The new fiscal device include 2 additional VAT rates (G and H) but currently they are not used. Whole solution in Romania must go through very complex certification process before usage in stores. The fiscal certification in Romania includes two steps:

1.  Obtaining the Technical certification in ICI
2.  Obtaining the Approval for distribution from Ministry of Finance.

Serbia

Fiscal law in Serbia is similar to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. Serbia was the first country which introduced GPRS in fiscal law. All relevant data is sent to the Serbian Tax Authority via GPRS.

Slovak Republic

New fiscal law in Slovak Republic has been proposed and discussed during 2018. It demands that all cash registers – both classic and virtual – be converted to new „online cash registers “(called „eKasa “cash registers) and connected with the tax authorities. In other words, all cash registers must have access to the Internet, enabling all transactions immediately to be transmitted to the financial administration and every issued receipt to be recorded in the central memory. Next, one of the major challenges that retailers are facing is PDS – a repository that provides one-time and permanent data entry. The PDS saves, in addition to Cash receipts, Void receipts, Deposits and Withdrawals, other documents that have been printed or sent via the online cash register (e.g. orders, delivery notes, prepaid accounts etc.).

All retailers can comply with this new law from 1st April 2019, or must from 1st July 2019. If they have the obligation to register sales under the new law for the first time, they are required to use the e-kasa cashier client from 1st April 2019. However, fines will not be imposed for non-usage of the online devices until 31st December 2019 as long as the code for every particular cash register has been acquired from the authorities on time, and that is 1st July 2019.

Slovenia

Fiscalization in Slovenia is similar to Croatia. At the beginning of 2016, in Slovenia, a new law was introduced which includes the stipulation that every transaction has to be sent to the fiscal authorities for authorization through the Internet. The core of Slovenian fiscal law is online authorization of every fiscally relevant transaction created at a POS system. That means that business subjects which are obliged to operate according to the new fiscal law are not required to change hardware equipment or to use some special fiscal devices because, as it is said, fiscalization is based on online authorization.
