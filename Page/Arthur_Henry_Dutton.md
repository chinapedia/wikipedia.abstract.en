There Dutton led a brigade of the VII Corps, and for his actions during the efforts to hold Suffolk he was brevetted a lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army on March 3.[8] On October 2 he was promoted to the rank of Captain in the Regular Army, and from January 14-February 16, 1864. he was stationed at Newport News, Virginia. Dutton next led a brigade in the XVIII Corps, Army of the James.[9]

On May 26 Dutton was within Bermuda Hundred and was ordered to reconnoiter the opposing Confederate position with his brigade. Dutton advanced for about 2 miles and was on the skirmish line near Proctor's Creek, where he was hit mortally.[10] He died of his wounds on June 5 in Baltimore, Maryland, and was buried with full military honors within Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. His family also erected a cenotaph to his memory in Memorium Cemetery in Wallingford, Connecticut, where his brother Clarence was also later buried.[11] He was posthumously brevetted to the rank of Colonel in the Regular Army and to Brigadier General of Volunteers for his actions at Bermuda Hundred.[12]
