Raspberry_jewel_pluot.jpg PLUOTS, APRIUMS, APRIPLUMS, or PLUMCOTS, are some of the hybrids between different _Prunus_ species that are also called interspecific plums. Whereas plumcots and apriplums are first-generation hybrids between a plum parent (_P. salicina_ or _P. cerasifera_ or their hybrids) and an apricot (_P. armeniaca_), pluots and apriums are later-generations.[1][2] Both names "plumcot" and "apriplum" have been used for trees derived from a plum seed parent, and are therefore equivalent.[3][4]


Plumcots and apriplums

Natural plumcots (also called apriplums) have been known for hundreds of years from regions of the world that grow both plums and apricots from seed.[5] The name _plumcot_ was created by Luther Burbank.[6] The plumcot tree can reproduce asexually by budding[7] whereas the apriplum tree resulted from hybridized seedlings and cannot reproduce.[8]


Pluots

Pluots are later generations of complex hybrid between the Japanese plum, _Prunus salicina_ (providing the greater amount of parentage), and the apricot, _Prunus armeniaca_.[9][10] The fruit's exterior has smooth skin closely resembling that of a plum. Pluots were developed in the late 20th century by Floyd Zaiger.[11]


Apriums

Apriums_on_a_cutting_board_02.jpg Apriums are complex plum-apricot hybrids that show primarily apricot traits and flavor.[12] Apriums resemble apricots on the outside. The flesh is usually dense and notable for its sweet taste due to a high content of fructose and other sugars.[13] Apriums are usually only available early in the fruit season, like apricots and unlike pluots, which include some very late-ripening varieties. Aprium trees grow quickly and are smaller compared to other common home-grown apricots. The fruit is gold, with red coloration. Semi-mature fruit is hard and does not ripen if picked before completely mature.
