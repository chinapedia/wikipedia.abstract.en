Parashot

The _parashah_ sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.[1] Isaiah 9 is a part of the _Prophecies about Judah and Israel (Isaiah 1-12)_. {P}: open _parashah_; {S}: closed _parashah_.

    [{S} 8:19-23] 9:1-6 {P} 9:7-12 {S} 9:13-20 {S}


Verse 1

    _Nevertheless the gloom will not be upon her who is distressed,_

        _As when at first He lightly esteemed_

    _The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,_

        _And afterward more heavily oppressed her,_

    _By the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan,_

        _In Galilee of the Gentiles._[2]

-   Cross reference: Matthew 4:13-15

The Gospel of Matthew chapter 4 cites this and the next verse as a fulfillment of Messianic Prophecies of Jesus. In the Greek "by way of the sea" (or "toward the sea") refers to a specific route, and Jones feels it should perhaps be more accurately read as "on the road to the sea."[3] In Isaiah this verse is in the section describing the Assyrian invasion of northern Israel, so "toward the sea, beyond the Jordan" refers to the geography from the view point of the Assyrian invaders. To them the region of Zebulun and Naphtali would be across the Jordan River on the way to the Mediterranean.[4]


Verse 2

    _The people who walked in darkness_

        _Have seen a great light;_

    _Those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death,_

        _Upon them a light has shined._[5]

Cross reference: Matthew 4:16


Verse 6

    _For unto us a Child is born,_

        _Unto us a Son is given;_

    _And the government will be upon His shoulder._
    _And His name will be called_

        _Wonderful,_
        _Counselor,_
        _Mighty God,_
        _Everlasting Father,_
        _Prince of Peace._[6]

-   "Wonderful Counselor": ; .[7]
-   "Mighty God": .[8]
-   "Everlasting Father": The New Oxford Annotated Bible interprets it "God as the eternal creator" .[9]
-   "Prince of Peace": According to the New Oxford Annotated Bible, it is "a messianic title in Judaism and early Christianity".[10]

Christian interpretation

In Christian interpretation, based partly on the proximity of a quote of Isaiah 9:2 found in Matthew 4, [11] the name is taken as referring to Jesus and Messianic prophecy. The full verse "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace." is quoted in the libretto of Handel's _Messiah_.


Verse 7

    _Of the increase of His government and peace_
    _There will be no end,_
    _Upon the throne of David and over His kingdom,_
    _To order it and establish it with judgment and justice_
    _From that time forward, even forever._
    _The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this._ (NKJV)[12]

Cross reference: Jeremiah 23:5


Verse 12

    ''For all this His anger is not turned away,
    _But His hand is stretched out still_.[13]

This refrain first appeared again in and appears again in , and .


Verse 14

    '' Therefore the Lord will cut off from Israel head and tail,''
    _branch and rush, in one day._[14]

Cross reference: Isaiah 19:15


Verse 15

    _The elder and honorable, he is the head;_

        _The prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail._[15]


Verse 16

    _For the leaders of this people cause them to err,_

        _And those who are led by them are destroyed._[16]
