ANANIE NKURUNZIZA was a presenter (_animateur_) on the Rwandan radio station Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, which played a significant role in promoting the Rwandan genocide. Like the station's other broadcasters, Nkurunziza incited violence against Tutsi and moderate Hutu on the air.[1]

On air, Nkurunziza acted as a political analyst, taking on the role of a serious intellectual and recounting foreign news.[2] Segments by Nkurunziza accounted for approximately 11% of RTLM airtime. As an _animateur_, he received the fourth most airtime.[3]

Before joining RTLM, Nkurunziza worked for an intelligence officer. He maintained his links to the Rwandan intelligence and police communities during his tenure at RTLM.[4]

Nkurunziza's whereabouts were unknown as of 2007.[5]
