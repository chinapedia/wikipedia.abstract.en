In organic chemistry, PHENOLS, sometimes called PHENOLICS, are a class of chemical compounds consisting of a hydroxyl group (—OH) bonded directly to an aromatic hydrocarbon group. The simplest of the class is phenol, . Phenolic compounds are classified as simple phenols or polyphenols based on the number of phenol units in the molecule. , the active metabolite of aspirin.]]

Phenols are synthesized industrially as well as naturally.[1]


Properties

Acidity

Phenols have distinct properties and are generally distinguished from other alcohols. They have higher acidities. The acidity of the hydroxyl group in phenols is commonly intermediate between that of aliphatic alcohols and carboxylic acids (their pK_(a) is usually between 10 and 12). Loss of a hydrogen cation (H⁺) from the hydroxyl group of a phenol forms a corresponding negative PHENOLATE ION or PHENOXIDE ION, and the corresponding salts are called PHENOLATES or PHENOXIDES, although the term ARYLOXIDES is preferred according to the IUPAC Gold Book. Phenols can have two or more hydroxy groups bonded to the aromatic ring(s) in the same molecule. The simplest examples are the three benzenediols, each having two hydroxy groups on a benzene ring.

Oxidation

Phenols are reactive species toward oxidation. Oxidative cleavage, for instance cleavage of 1,2-dihydroxybenzene to the monomethylester of 2,4 hexadienedioic acid with oxygen, copper chloride in pyridine[2]

and oxone.[3] In reaction depicted below 3,4,5-trimethylphenol reacts with singlet oxygen generated from oxone/sodium carbonate in an acetonitrile/water mixture to a para-peroxyquinole. This hydroperoxide is reduced to the quinole with sodium thiosulfate.

Electrophilic aromatic substitution

Phenols are highly susceptible to Electrophilic aromatic substitutions. Illustrative of a large-scale electrophilic aromatic substitution is the production of bisphenol A, which is produced on a scale 1 million tons. This compound is synthesized by the condensation of acetone.[4]



Other reactions

Phenols undergo esterfication. Phenol esters are active esters, being prone to hydrolysis.

Synthesis

Several laboratory methods for the synthesis of phenols:

-   by an ester rearrangement in the Fries rearrangement
-   by a rearrangement of N-phenylhydroxylamines in the Bamberger rearrangement
-   by dealkylation of phenolic ethers
-   by reduction of quinones
-   by replacement of an aromatic amine by an hydroxyl group with water and sodium bisulfide in the Bucherer reaction
-   by thermal decomposition of aryl diazonium salts, the salts are converted to phenol
-   by oligomerisation with formaldehyde + base catalysed reaction with epichlorohydrin to epoxi resin components
-   by reaction with acetone/ketones to e.g. Bisphenol A, an important monomer for resins, e.g. polycarbonate (PC), epoxi resins
-   by the oxidation of aryl silanes—an aromatic variation of the Fleming-Tamao oxidation [5]
-   by the addition of benzene and propene in to form cumene then is added with to form phenol (Hock process)


Classification

There are various classification schemes.[6] A commonly used scheme is based on the number of carbons and was devised by Jeffrey Harborne and Simmonds in 1964 and published in 1980:[7][8]

 aromatic reactivity.]]

The majority of these compounds are soluble molecules but the smaller molecules can be volatile.

Phenols chemically interact with many other substances. Stacking, a chemical property of molecules with aromaticity, is seen occurring between phenolic molecules. When studied in mass spectrometry, phenols easily form adduct ions with halogens. They can also interact with the food matrices or with different forms of silica (mesoporous silica, fumed silica[9] or silica-based sol gels[10]).
