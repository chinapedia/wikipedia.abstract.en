Cast

-   Sverrir Gudnason as Björn Borg:

    A Swedish former world no. 1 tennis player.[4][5][6] Screenwriter Ronnie Sandahl stated in interviews with Swedish newspapers _Expressen_ and _Sydsvenskan_ that "he [Sverrir] looks very much like the Swedish tennis star".[7][8] In an interview, Gudnason talked about his preparation for the part, and stated that "I [he] spent six months in which he trained 15 hours a week, with two hours of tennis and four workouts with a personal trainer."[9] He also revealed that he had not met Borg, stating "not yet, but I will meet him, sometime after the shooting of the film."[10] Leo Borg, the real-life son of Björn Borg, portrays his father from age 9 to 13, while actor Markus Mossberg portrays him from age 14 to 17.[11]

-   Shia LaBeouf as John McEnroe:

    An American former world no. 1 professional tennis player and Borg's rival.[12][13][14][15] Sandahl stated in an interview, that it was Shia that made contact with the production, when he heard about the script, because "he [Shia] identifies strongly with the character of McEnroe, and felt that he is a misunderstood person."[16] In an interview with _Variety_, Shia praised the script and called it "brilliant", and said that he "cried when reading it for the first time."[17] He also revealed that he has not met with McEnroe about the role, stating "haven't met him yet, but I'm eager to meet him before we shoot. I got nothing but love and respect for him."[18]

-   Stellan Skarsgård as Lennart Bergelin:

    A Swedish tennis player and Borg's coach.[19][20][21] This is his first role in a Swedish film since he starred in the films _Arn – The Knight Templar_ and _Arn – The Kingdom at Road's End_.[22] Skarsgård described and compared the relationship between Bergelin and Borg to the rivalry between Mozart and Salieri in the 1984 film _Amadeus_: "people think that Salieri was jealous of Mozart, but I do not think that's the right word. I think it's more an utter fascination and love of the genius. And the self-doubt that you are not capable."[23][24]

-   Tuva Novotny as Mariana Simionescu:

    A Romanian tennis player and Borg's fiancée.[25]

-   Robert Emms as Vitas Gerulaitis:

Production

Development

In May 2016, it was announced that a film about tennis rivals Björn Borg and John McEnroe was in development.[28] It also was revealed that Danish director Janus Metz Pedersen would direct the film, from a screenplay written by Swedish writer Ronnie Sandahl.[29][30][31] He is mostly known for directing the 2010 documentary film _Armadillo_ and one episode of the HBO drama _True Detective_.[32] The film would be produced by Jon Nohrstedt, who produced the Swedish animated film _Bamse and the Thief City_, and Fredrik Wikström Nicastro, who is most known for producing the 2010 film _Easy Money_.[33][34] The film would be distributed by Nordisk Film in Scandinavia, and internationally by SF Studios.[35]

Casting

In May 2016, it was announced that Sverrir Gudnason and Shia LaBeouf were cast as Björn Borg and John McEnroe, respectively.[36] In an interview with _Variety_ at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, LaBeouf was excited about the script and working with Scandinavian directors, stating, "They make better movies. Scandinavian film making is different. It's a different pace, a different relationship between the crew—the bonds are different".[37] In the same article, it was revealed that Stellan Skarsgård had been cast as Borg's coach Lennart Bergelin, which is his first role in a Swedish film in several years.[38][39][40][41] On August 16, it was announced that Tuva Novotny and Robert Emms had joined the cast as Mariana Simionescu and Vitas Gerulaitis, respectively.[42][43]

Filming

The filming began in August 2016, and took place in Gothenburg, Prague, London, and Monaco.[44] Filming also took place in Borg's hometown of Södertälje, where he grew up, and started playing tennis as a child.[45] The production has recreated the Studio 54 nightclub at a studio in Gothenburg.[46] The tennis arena Štvanice in Prague, stands in for the Centre Court arena in Wimbledon, London, where they shot the finals of the 1980 Wimbledon Championships.[47] Gudnason described that he felt "a huge sense of authenticity, when I [he] and Shia walked from the changing room to what [was] supposed to look like the Centre Court arena, before hundreds of extras."[48][49]

In October, the first set photos of Sverrir Gudnason and Shia LaBeouf as Björn Borg and John McEnroe, respectively, were released.[50][51]


Release

_Borg vs McEnroe_ opened the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, concurrent with its Swedish theatrical release. It was released in the UK on September 22, and the U.S. release was set for 13 April 2018.[52][53]
