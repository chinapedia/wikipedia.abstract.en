The 1946 ALABAMA GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION took place on November 5, 1946, to elect the Governor of Alabama. Incumbent Democrat Chauncey Sparks was term-limited, and could not seek a second consecutive term.


Democratic primary

At the time this election took place, Alabama, as with most other southern states, was solidly Democratic, and the Republican Party had such diminished influence that the Democratic primary was the _de facto_ contest for state offices.

-   Leven H. Ellis, lieutenant governor
-   Jim Folsom, businessman and candidate for governor in 1942
-   Gordon Persons, president of the Public Service Commission
-   Joe N. Poole, Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries
