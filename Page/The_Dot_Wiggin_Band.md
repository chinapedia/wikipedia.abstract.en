THE DOT WIGGIN BAND is a musical group led by Dot Wiggin of the 1960s outsider music girl group, The Shaggs.[1]

The band released their debut album, _Ready! Get! Go!_ in 2013 on Jello Biafra's label, Alternative Tentacles.[2]


Formation

Dot Wiggin was the lead singer, guitarist and songwriter of the Shaggs, along with her sisters Helen (drums) and Betty Wiggin (guitar, vocals). In 2012, bassist Jesse Krakow organized a tribute to the Shaggs, in which he invited Dot, Betty and Rachel Wiggin of the Shaggs to be honored guests. At the Q&A portion of the evening, Dot was asked if she still wrote songs, to which she replied yes. Jesse raised his hand and asked if he could help her record them. The Dot Wiggin Band quickly formed, and recorded their first album in winter of 2012, and began performing live in 2013. Band members include Dot Wiggin (vocals, songwriting), Brittany Anjou (keys, co-vocals, toy piano), Laura Cromwell (drums, vocals), Adam Minkoff (guitar/bass), Nick Oddy (guitar), Rich Bennett (guitar), Mike Fornatale (guitar), and Jesse Krakow (bass, vocals, songwriting). The album includes recent songs written by Dot as well as songs she wrote for the Shaggs in the 1970s that had not been previously recorded.


Live

The Dot Wiggin Band opened for Neutral Milk Hotel on tour in the Spring of 2015, in what was Dot's first ever tour. The band has many fans and support from Shaggs' audiences worldwide. In performance, Dot sings old Shaggs songs re-created live by members who have become familiar with the repertoire as recorded on the original Shaggs albums, which has created interest and confusion amongst audiences unfamiliar with the Shaggs. The live touring lineup features members of sister band, Bi TYRANT, a feminist hardcore punk band from Brooklyn led by co-vocalist Brittany Anjou. [3]
