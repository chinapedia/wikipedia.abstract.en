KEA is an open-source DHCP server being developed, primarily in C++, by the Internet Systems Consortium, authors of ISC DHCP, also known as DHCPd. Kea and ISC DHCP are both implementations of the Dynamic Host Control Protocol, a set of standards established by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Kea software is distributed in source code form, on Github,[1] from various ISC sites, and through a number of operating system packages.[2][3][4][5][6]

Kea is licensed under the Mozilla Public License (MPL2.0)[7]

The Kea distribution includes a DHCPv4 server, a DHCPv6 server, and a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) server. Significant features include: support for IPv6 prefix delegation, host reservations (which may be optionally stored in a separate back end database), PXE boot, client classification, and optional support for storing leases in a PostgreSQL, MySQL[8][9] or Cassandra (experimental) database. Kea has a supported API for writing optional extensions, using 'hooks'.[10]
