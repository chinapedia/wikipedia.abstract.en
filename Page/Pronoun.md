In linguistics and grammar, a PRONOUN (abbreviated ) has been theorized to be a word that substitutes for a noun or noun phrase. It is a particular case of a pro-form.

Pronouns have traditionally been regarded as one of the parts of speech, but some modern theorists would not consider them to form a single class, in view of the variety of functions they perform cross-linguistically. An example of a pronoun is "their", which is both plural and singular. Subtypes include personal and possessive pronouns, reflexive and reciprocal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, relative and interrogative pronouns, and indefinite pronouns.[1][2]

The use of pronouns often involves anaphora, where the meaning of the pronoun is dependent on an antecedent. For example, in the sentence _That poor man looks as if he needs a new coat_, the antecedent of the pronoun _he_ is dependent on _that poor man_.

The adjective associated with _pronoun_ is _PRONOMINAL_. A pronominal is also a word or phrase that acts as a pronoun. For example, in _That's not the one I wanted_, the phrase _the one_ (containing the prop-word _one_) is a pronominal.[3]


Theoretical considerations

In grammar

Pronouns _(antōnymía)_ are listed as one of eight parts of speech in _The Art of Grammar_, a treatise on Greek grammar attributed to Dionysius Thrax and dating from the 2nd century BC. The pronoun is described there as "a part of speech substitutable for a noun and marked for a person." Pronouns continued to be regarded as a part of speech in Latin grammar (the Latin term being , from which the English name – through Middle French – ultimately derives), and thus in the European tradition generally.

In more modern approaches, pronouns are less likely to be considered to be a single word class, because of the many different syntactic roles that they play, as represented by the various different types of pronouns listed in the previous sections.[4]

                  Pronoun   Determiner
  --------------- --------- ------------------
  Possessive      _ours_    _our_ freedom
  Demonstrative   _this_    _this_ gentleman
  Indefinite      _some_    _some_ frogs
  Negative        _none_    _no_ information
  Interrogative   _which_   _which_ option

In linguistics

Our_as_a_pronoun_or_determiner.png Linguists in particular have trouble classifying pronouns in a single category, and some do not agree that pronouns substitute nouns or noun categories[5]. Certain types of pronouns are often identical or similar in form to determiners with related meaning; some English examples are given in the table on the right. This observation has led some linguists, such as Paul Postal, to regard pronouns as determiners that have had their following noun or noun phrase deleted.[6] (Such patterning can even be claimed for certain personal pronouns; for example, _we_ and _you_ might be analyzed as determiners in phrases like _we Brits_ and _you tennis players_.) Other linguists have taken a similar view, uniting pronouns and determiners into a single class, sometimes called "determiner-pronoun", or regarding determiners as a subclass of pronouns or vice versa. The distinction may be considered to be one of subcategorization or valency, rather like the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs – determiners take a noun phrase complement like transitive verbs do, while pronouns do not.[7] This is consistent with the determiner phrase viewpoint, whereby a determiner, rather than the noun that follows it, is taken to be the head of the phrase. Cross-linguistically, it seems as though pronouns share 3 distinct categories: point of view, person, and number. The breadth of each subcategory however tends to differ among languages.[8]

Binding theory and antecedents

The use of pronouns often involves anaphora, where the meaning of the pronoun is dependent on another referential element. The referent of the pronoun is often the same as that of a preceding (or sometimes following) noun phrase, called the antecedent of the pronoun. The grammatical behavior of certain types of pronouns, and in particular their possible relationship with their antecedents, has been the focus of studies in binding, notably in the Chomskyan government and binding theory. In this binding context, reflexive and reciprocal pronouns in English (such as _himself_ and _each other_) are referred to as anaphors (in a specialized restricted sense) rather than as pronominal elements. Under binding theory, specific principles apply to different sets of pronouns. Reflexive.png

In English, reflexive and reciprocal pronouns must adhere to PRINCIPLE A: an anaphor (reflexive or reciprocal, such as "each other") must be bound in its governing category (roughly, the clause). Therefore in syntactic structure it must be lower in structure (it must have an antecedant) and have a direct relationship with its referent. This is called a C-command relationship. For instance, we see that _John cut himself_ is grammatical, but _Himself cut John_ is not, despite having identical arguments, since _himself_, the reflexive, must be lower in structure to John, its referent. Additionally, we see examples like _John said that Mary cut himself_ are not grammatical because there is a intermediary noun, _Mary_, that disallows the two referents from having a direct relationship. Pronoun.png

On the other hand, personal pronouns (such as _him_ or _them_) must adhere to PRINCIPLE B: a pronoun must be free (i.e., not bound) within its governing category (roughly, the clause). This means that although the pronouns can have a referent, they cannot have a direct relationship with the referent where the referent selects the pronoun. For instance, _John said Mary cut him_ is grammatical because the two co-referents, _John_ and _him_ are separated structurally by _Mary_. This is why a sentence like _John cut him_ where _him_ refers to _John_ is ungrammatical.

Binding cross-linguistically

It is important to note however that the type of binding that applies to subsets of pronouns varies cross linguistically. For instance, in German linguistics, pronouns can be split into two distinct categories — personal pronouns and d-pronouns. Although personal pronouns act identically to that of English personal pronouns (i.e. follow Principle A), d-pronouns follow yet another principle, Principle C, and function similarly to nouns in that they cannot have a direct relationship to an antecedent.[9]

Antecedents

The following sentences give examples of particular types of pronouns used with antecedents:

-   Third-person personal pronouns:
    -   _THAT POOR MAN looks as if HE needs a new coat._ (the noun phrase _that poor man_ is the antecedent of _he_)
    -   _JULIA arrived yesterday. I met HER at the station._ (_Julia_ is the antecedent of _her_)
    -   _When THEY saw us, THE LIONS began roaring_ (_the lions_ is the antecedent of _they_; as it comes after the pronoun it may be called a _postcedent_)
-   Other personal pronouns in some circumstances:
    -   _TERRY AND I were hoping no-one would find US._ (_Terry and I_ is the antecedent of _us_)
    -   _YOU AND ALICE can come if YOU like._ (_you and Alice_ is the antecedent of the second – plural – _you_)
-   Reflexive and reciprocal pronouns:
    -   _JACK hurt HIMSELF._ (_Jack_ is the antecedent of _himself_)
    -   _WE were teasing EACH OTHER._ (_we_ is the antecedent of _each other_)
-   Relative pronouns:
    -   _THE WOMAN WHO looked at you is my sister._ (_the woman_ is the antecedent of _who_)

Some other types, such as indefinite pronouns, are usually used without antecedents. Relative pronouns are used without antecedents in free relative clauses. Even third-person personal pronouns are sometimes used without antecedents ("unprecursed") – this applies to special uses such as dummy pronouns and generic _they_, as well as cases where the referent is implied by the context.


Inventory of English pronouns

The table below lists English pronouns across a number of different syntactic contexts (Subject, Object, Possessive, Reflexive) according to the following features:

-   person (1st, 2nd, 3rd person);
-   number (singular/plural);
-   gender (masculine, feminine, neuter, epicene)

  : Personal pronouns in standard Modern English

In addition to the personal pronouns exemplified in the above table, English ask has other pronoun types, including demonstrative, relative, indefinite, and interrogative pronouns, as listed in the following table. For more detailed discussion, see the following subsections.

  : English personal pronouns[10]

Personal pronouns may be classified by person, number, gender and case. English has three persons (first, second and third) and two numbers (singular and plural); in the third person singular there are also distinct pronoun forms for male, female and neuter gender.[11] Principal forms are shown in the adjacent table (see also English personal pronouns).

English personal pronouns have two cases, _subject_ and _object_. Subject pronouns are used in subject position (_I like to eat chips, but SHE does not_). Object pronouns are used for the object of a verb or preposition (_John likes ME but not HER_).[12]

Other distinct forms found in some languages include:

-   Second person informal and formal pronouns (the T-V distinction), like _tu_ and _vous_ in French. Formal second person pronouns can also signify plurality in many languages. There is no such distinction in standard modern English, though Elizabethan English marked the distinction with _thou_ (singular informal) and _you_ (plural or singular formal). Some dialects of English have developed informal plural second person pronouns, for instance, "y'all" (Southern American English) and _you guys_ (American English).
-   Inclusive and exclusive first person plural pronouns, which indicate whether or not the audience is included, that is, whether "we" means "you and I" or "they and I". There is no such distinction in English.
-   Intensive (emphatic) pronouns, which re-emphasize a noun or pronoun that has already been mentioned. English uses the same forms as the reflexive pronouns; for example: _I did it MYSELF_ (contrast reflexive use, _I did it to myself_).
-   Direct and indirect object pronouns, such as _le_ and _lui_ in French. English uses the same form for both; for example: _Mary loves HIM_ (direct object); _Mary sent HIM a letter_ (indirect object).
-   Prepositional pronouns, used after a preposition. English uses ordinary object pronouns here: _Mary looked at HIM_.
-   Disjunctive pronouns, used in isolation or in certain other special grammatical contexts, like _moi_ in French. No distinct forms exist in English; for example: _Who does this belong to? ME._
-   Strong and weak forms of certain pronouns, found in some languages such as Polish.

Possessive

Possessive pronouns are used to indicate possession (in a broad sense). Some occur as independent noun phrases: _mine_, _yours_, _hers_, _ours_, _theirs_. An example is: _Those clothes are MINE._ Others act as a determiner and must accompany a noun: _my_, _your_, _her_, _our_, _your_, _their_, as in: _I lost MY wallet._ (_His_ and _its_ can fall into either category, although _its_ is nearly always found in the second.) Those of the second type have traditionally also been described as possessive adjectives, and in more modern terminology as possessive determiners. The term "possessive pronoun" is sometimes restricted to the first type. Both types replace possessive noun phrases. As an example, _THEIR crusade to capture our attention_ could replace '''''The advertisers' _'crusade to capture our attention._[13]

Reflexive and reciprocal

Reflexive pronouns are used when a person or thing acts on itself, for example, _John cut HIMSELF._ In English they all end in _-self_ or _-selves_ and must refer to a noun phrase elsewhere in the same clause.[14]

Reciprocal pronouns refer to a reciprocal relationship (_each other_, _one another_). They must refer to a noun phrase in the same clause.[15] An example in English is: _They do not like EACH OTHER._ In some languages, the same forms can be used as both reflexive and reciprocal pronouns.

Demonstrative

Demonstrative pronouns (in English, _this_, _that_ and their plurals _these_, _those_) often distinguish their targets by pointing or some other indication of position; for example, _I'll take THESE._ They may also be _anaphoric_, depending on an earlier expression for context, for example, _A kid actor would try to be all sweet, and who needs THAT?_[16]

Indefinite

Indefinite pronouns, the largest group of pronouns, refer to one or more unspecified persons or things. One group in English includes compounds of _some-_, _any-_, _every-_ and _no-_ with _-thing_, _-one_ and _-body_, for example: _ANYONE can do that._ Another group, including _many_, _more_, _both_, and _most_, can appear alone or followed by _of_.[17] In addition,

-   Distributive pronouns are used to refer to members of a group separately rather than collectively. (_To EACH his own._)
-   Negative pronouns indicate the non-existence of people or things. (_NOBODY thinks that._)
-   Impersonal pronouns normally refer to a person, but are not specific as to first, second or third person in the way that the personal pronouns are. (_ONE does not clean ONE'S own windows._)

Relative and interrogative

Relative

Relative pronouns in English include _who_, _whom_, _whose_, _what_, _which_ and _that_). They rely on an antecedent, and refer back to people or things previously mentioned: _People WHO smoke should quit now._ They are used in relative clauses.[18] Relative pronouns can also be used as complementizers.

Interrogative

Relative pronouns can be used in an interrogative setting as interrogative pronouns. Interrogative pronouns ask which person or thing is meant. In reference to a person, one may use _who_ (subject), _whom_ (object) or _whose_ (possessive); for example, _WHO did that?_ In colloquial speech, _whom_ is generally replaced by _who_. English non-personal interrogative pronouns (_which_ and _what_) have only one form.[19]

In English and many other languages (e.g. French and Czech), the sets of relative and interrogative pronouns are nearly identical. Compare English: _WHO is that?_ (interrogative) and _I know the woman WHO came_ (relative). In some other languages, interrogative pronouns and indefinite pronouns are frequently identical; for example, Standard Chinese means "what?" as well as "something" or "anything".

Archaic forms

  Person     Number       Case
  ---------- ------------ ------
  Subject    Object
  _Second_   _Singular_   THOU
  _Plural_   YE           YOU


  : Archaic personal pronouns[20]

Though the personal pronouns described above are the _contemporary_ English pronouns, older forms of _modern_ English (as used by Shakespeare, for example) use a slightly different set of personal pronouns as shown in the table. The difference is entirely in the second person. Though one would rarely find these older forms used in literature from recent centuries, they are nevertheless considered _modern_.

Special uses of English pronouns

Some special uses of personal pronouns include:

-   Generic _you_, where second person pronouns are used in an indefinite sense: _YOU can't buy good old-fashioned bulbs these days._
-   Generic _they_: _In China THEY drive on the right._
-   Gender non-specific uses, where a pronoun needs to be found to refer to a person whose sex is not specified. Solutions sometimes used in English include generic _he_ and singular _they_. The singular _they_ has gained popularity in LGBTQ+ culture to refer to those that identify as non-binary or genderqueer and as a way to refer to a person gender-neutrally. Some American cities have also used "yo" as a gender neutral pronoun.[21][22]
-   Dummy pronouns (expletive pronouns), used to satisfy a grammatical requirement for a noun or pronoun, but contributing nothing to its meaning: _IT is raining._
-   Resumptive pronouns, "intrusive" personal pronouns found (for example) in some relative clauses where a gap (trace) might be expected: _This is the girl that I don’t know what SHE said._
-   Royal we, used to refer to a single person who is a monarch: _WE are not amused._

[4] For example, Vulf Plotkin (_The Language System of English_, Universal Publishers, 2006, pp. 82–83) writes: "[...] Pronouns exemplify such a word class, or rather several smaller classes united by an important semantic distinction between them and all the major parts of speech. The latter denote things, phenomena and their properties in the ambient world. [...] Pronouns, on the contrary, do not denote anything, but refer to things, phenomena or properties without involving their peculiar nature."
