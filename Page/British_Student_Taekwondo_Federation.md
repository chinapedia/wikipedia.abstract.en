History

The BSTF was established in 1986 as a not-for-profit organisation to facilitate university Taekwondo clubs to train and compete together. The first Student National Taekwondo Championships were organised in 1987 and were held at the University of Southampton. The event began as a collaboration between students of Southampton and Warwick University's Taekwondo clubs, including one of the BSTF's founding members and current patron of the charity master Graham Jones. The inaugural championships included student teams from the University of Southampton, Southampton Technical College (now Southampton City College), Leeds University and Warwick University.[14]

By 1989 the organisation had evolved into a constituted national organising committee to cater for the expanding event. The first Student National Taekwondo Championships included only the WTF rules sparring discipline, with ITF rules sparring added in 1992 and various individual, pairs and team patterns events being added over time.[15] The most recent edition to the competition programme is the Freestyle Patterns discipline added to the Student National Taekwondo Championships event in 2017 as and additional qualification event for the European University Sports Association's European Universities Games and European Universities Championships Taekwondo programme.[16]

Membership of the BSTF is open to all university Taekwondo clubs which are themselves members of their respective students' unions. Representatives of each member club may vote on motions and in trustee elections at the charity's general meetings. The BSTF's events and tournaments are open to all university student Taekwondo athletes â€“ including independent entries from universities which do not yet possess a student union registered Taekwondo club.[17]
