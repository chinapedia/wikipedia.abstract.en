Plot

Aunt Agatha sends Cyril Bassington-Bassington to Bertie in New York with strict instructions that he is to be kept away from the stage. Shortly after arrival, George Caffyn, New York playwright and friend of Bertie Wooster, engages Cyril and he goes on stage. Then Aunt Agatha arrives and wants to see a play, the same play that Cyril is in. Cyril beats the son of Mr. Blumenfield, an American theatrical manager, New York theater owner and important Broadway producer, who gives Cyril notice. Mr. Blumenfield follows always the view of his son on what will like the people in theater.

Meanwhile, Bruce Corcoran ("Corky"), a New York portrait painter turned cartoonist, asks Bertie to help him ask his wealthy uncle Alexander Worple to accept his girlfriend Muriel Singer so he can marry her. In order to get Worple's blessings and to attract the affection of Corky's wealthy uncle, Jeeves produces a plan which involves Corky's girlfriend Muriel Singer writing a book, which pleases Worple. At the end Jeeves writes "A Children’s Book of American Birds" in Muriel's place. Things go wrong and the uncle ends up Corky's dream marrying her. Alexander Worple marries Muriel Singer and Corky has only to paint a portrait of their baby, named "The Baby". But Worple dislikes Corky's Abstract Expressionist portrait painting of the baby and cuts off Corky's allowance. Aunt Agatha comes with NY Chronicle Art Critic Arthur Prysock, an art critic with whom she wants to start and run her own art gallery. She is enamoured of the Abstract Expressionist portrait painting by Bruce Corcoran ("Corky"), and asks NY Chronicle Art Critic Arthur Prysock to buy it for her art gallery.
