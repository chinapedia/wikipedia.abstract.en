John Kelly}} JOHN KELLY (1913 – after 1936) was an English professional footballer who played as a centre forward or inside forward.


Career

Kelly was born in 1913 in Sandbach, Cheshire.[1] He was on the books of Accrington Stanley before making his Football League debut for Leeds United during the 1934–35 season.[2] He was known as Mick Kelly while at Leeds, to distinguish him from clubmate Jack Kelly.[3] He left Leeds on 23 October 1935, and after a brief spell with Barnsley, during which he played three Second Division matches, he signed for Bradford City on 21 November, which meant he was registered with three different clubs within a month.[4] During his time with Bradford City he made five appearances in the Football League,[5] and left in 1936[6] for Bedford Town.[7]

His brother Dom also played league football.[8][9]
