History

The foundation of Amasra Museum goes back to 1955 when the collected items, which were stored in a small hall in the municipality building, were opened to the public as an exhibition. In 1969, the museum moved to a former primary school building. On 30 January 1982, it was transferred to its current building. The construction of this building as a naval school began in 1884, it remained however unfinished. In 1975, the building was acquired by the Ministry of Culture and completed in 1976.[3][4][5]
