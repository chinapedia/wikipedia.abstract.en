Overview

_Sarah's Scribbles_ focuses on adulthood and the maturity of the Millennial generation. Andersen herself described Millennials as "liking to laugh at themselves," making common use of self-deprecating humour.[1] _The Independent_ described _Sarah's Scribbles_ as a series of "relatable comics capturing the dilemmas of a bug-eyed millennial who feels ill-equipped for grown-up life." The webcomic is semi-autobiographical, following Andersen's experiences as well as those of her friends and pets.[2] One comic shows, for instance, how Andersen borrows items from her boyfriend.[3]

Andersen's webcomic primarily features the messy-haired protagonist Sarah, who has to deal with social anxiety, body image issues and laziness.[4] Andersen has deliberately chosen not to publish photographs of her face, instead opting to present herself through her black-haired and black-eyed character. Andersen noted in December, 2016 that _Owl Turd Comics_ was her favorite webcomic at the time, though she primarily gains inspiration from her own life and seeing what people on the internet are thinking and feeling.[5]

Andersen's webcomic makes use of a five-panel format, which Andersen developed because it works well with the scroll display of Tumblr and continues to work well on other websites, such as Instagram.[8]
