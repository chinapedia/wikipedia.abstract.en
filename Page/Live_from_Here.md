_LIVE FROM HERE_, formerly known as _A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION WITH CHRIS THILE_, is an American variety radio show known for its musical guests, especially folk and traditional musicians, tongue-in-cheek radio drama, and relaxed humor. Hosted by Chris Thile, it airs on Saturday evenings and is usually recorded in front of a live audience at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota, although the show frequently goes on tour to cities around the United States. Those locations include New York City, where the show is slated to make its new home in the forthcoming 2019-2020 season at The Town Hall.[1]

The show is derived from the historic_A Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor_ (_APHC_) radio show. The original host, Garrison Keillor, performed his final show in July 2016, and Thile's program began on October 15, 2016. Thile, an American virtuoso mandolinist and singer-songwriter, had a two-decade history with _APHC_ and is known for his work in the folk and progressive bluegrass groups Nickel Creek and Punch Brothers. After two unprecedented guest host spots in 2015, Keillor decided on his successor, featured Thile as host again in January–February 2016, and fully ceded his hosting role to Thile in the October 2016 performance at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota, continuing as the show's Executive Producer. Thile's new program presents expanded musical and comedic elements, retaining the template of the earlier program (e.g., its most recent acting and sound effect cast, and "sponsorships" from fictitious companies), but without such features as its earlier signature "Lives of the Cowboys" series and "News from Lake Wobegon" monologue. Reviews of the new program have been uniformly positive, focusing on the remaining familiar elements and on the new music and expanded musical focus brought by the new host.

On November 29, 2017, in the wake of allegations of misconduct against Keillor, American Public Media announced it would change the show's name.[2][3][4] The new name of the show was announced as _LIVE FROM HERE_ live on the December 16, 2017, broadcast of the show.[5]


Program host

Chris Thile, born in 1981, is an American virtuoso mandolinist and singer-songwriter known for his folk and progressive bluegrass work in the trio Nickel Creek and the quintet Punch Brothers.[6][7][8][9] A child prodigy in music—self-described as "begging [his] parents for a mandolin from the time [he] was 2" and picking up the mandolin for the first time at the age of 5[10]—Thile was one of a trio, with siblings Sara and Sean Watkins, home-schooled California children in musical families, who formed the group Nickel Creek with Thile's father in 1989.[11] An acoustic group, it continues as a trio to the present day (2016), with Thile's participation alongside his more recent acoustic quintet Punch Brothers, both variously described using terms such as folk, progressive, bluegrass, "newgrass," and roots music.[12][13] Thile was awarded BBC's Folk Musician of the Year award in 2007, a MacArthur Fellowship "genius" award in 2012, and he has been nominated eight times for Grammy Awards, winning four, all Best Album awards, in different categories in 1997, 2002, 2013, and 2015 (Bluegrass, Contemporary Folk, Folk, and Contemporary Instrumental, respectively).[14] Garrison Keillor has made known his personal opinion, that Thile is "the great bluegrass performer of our time."[15] As well, others have observed that "[t]hough charming and cheery, Thile is by nature deeply competitive," and understands the business side of matters, and that the size of audiences that the show attracts will matter - see business strategy below.[16]


History with _APHC_

Guest performances

Thile first performed with Garrison Keillor on _A Prairie Home Companion_ in 1996, at age 15.[17][18] Over the next two decades, Thile returned to _APHC_ eight times (according to the program's website),[19] performing both as a solo artist and as a part of the groups Nickel Creek and the Punch Brothers. These guest appearances included performances at the programs home venue, the Fitzgerald Theater, and at tour venues. Programs in which Thile participated that received press coverage or are otherwise sourced and noteworthy appear below.

-   May 11, 1996—At The Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota. In the _Young Artists Showcase,_ Thile as a 15-years old.[20] With regulars Tim Russell, Chris Forth, Tom Keith and "The Guys All-Star Shoe Band" (Richard Dworsky, Andy Stein, Pat Donohue, Greg Hippen, and Arnie Kinsella), and other guests Kate MacKenzie,[21] Michael Cleveland, and Seamus Egan and Solas (Karan Casey, John Doyle, Winifred Horan, and John Williams). Thile performed his songs _Shadow Ridge_ (1992), _What's the Matter with the Mill?_ (1996), and _Faith River_ (1996), Keillor's song _Greenland Whale Fisheries_ (1996), traditional and other songs (e.g., by Bill Monroe and MacKenzie) including _Stoney Lonesome_, _Mother the Queen of My Heart_ (1933), _The Sweetest Gift A Mother's Smile_, _Don't this Road look Rough and Rocky_, _Wheel Hoss_, and _The Red River Valley_ (1879), as well as the _Powdermilk Biscuit Theme_.[22][23]
-   June 11, 2016—At the Ravinia Festival, in Highland Park, Illinois. With the Punch Brothers.[24]

Trial guest hosting

2016-01-30ChrisThileAPHC.jpg When Keillor announced in November 2014 that he would absent himself from _APHC_ for "only the second time in decades," he yielded the host's microphone to Thile for these guest host appearances.[25] Thile began these appearances in 2015 and appeared a total of 4 times in the twelve months thereafter, the final two guest host spots being on January 30 and February 6, 2016.[26]

The guest host appearances gave an indication of the type of crew that Thile would assemble, the kinds of guests he would attract, and the style in which he might host (see Format and Cast, below).[27] The hosted programs were on the following dates, and featured the following guest artists:

-   January 30, 2016, with Thile's fellow Punch Brothers group members, with musical guests Brandi Carlile, Ben Folds and Sarah Jarosz.[28] A special comedy spot was done by comedian Maria Bamford.[29]
-   February 6, 2016, again with the Punch Brothers and Sarah Jarosz, with musical guests Paul Simon and Andrew Bird,[30] with special comedy again from Maria Bamford.[31] Thile also covered Kendrick Lamar's song about police brutality, _Alright,_ to some social media criticism, about which he later said, "I would readily admit that my love of the song kind of blinded me," and "I think it was a bad call."[32] Thile is described as having "test dr[iven]" his idea for a newly-penned Song of the Week, with themes "tailored to current events," in his performance of "Omahallelujah," about Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning during this episode.[33]

Final Keillor program

In 2015, Keillor announced that he would step down from hosting the program and designated Chris Thile[34] as the new host. Keillor's final episode of the show was recorded live on July 1, 2016, at the Hollywood Bowl in California for an audience of 18,000 fans[35] and broadcast the next day.[36] Keillor retained artistic rights and trademark to the show's name as well as some distribution rights and rights to retail items connected with _A Prairie Home Companion_. Thile made his debut as permanent host on October 15, 2016.

Name change

In November 2017 Minnesota Public Radio severed all business ties with former _APHC_ host Garrison Keillor over unspecified "inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him."[37] The Minnesota Public Radio website listed the show under the working title _The Show with Chris Thile_, as the trademark for _A Prairie Home Companion_ is held by Keillor, not MPR.[38] Thile addressed the situation on the December 2 installment of the series,[39] and Thile began using a new theme, "Radio Boogie".[40][41]

The show aired under the placeholder title of _The Show with Chris Thile_ for the next two Saturdays. Finally, on December 16, Thile announced the show's new name as _Live from Here_.[42]


New _APHC_ format

Thile has referred to the program that Keillor created as a "truly great wor[k] of art" and so "immortal," so that he would "keep using the template [Keillor] created to tell each other stories and to escape from our daily cares.[43] Even so, Andrew Leahy of the _Rolling Stone_ writes that Thile has had added to the mandate of "preserving the show's appeal" a further one of "revising its structure and broadening its reach to younger generations."[44] Hence, the program continues to present a variety of program elements, including music, and storytelling, comedic and otherwise (see following), but Thile has indicated some changes in direction, and others are noted in early reviews. Absent from the new program is the "Lives of the Cowboys" sketch,[45] and the signature weekly "News from Lake Wobegon" monologues from Garrison Keillor; still present as of October 2016 are "old favorites" such as the program's faux sponsorship by Powdermilk Biscuits.[46]

As of the opening month of the program, the planned replacement for the Keillor monologue was a slate of appearances from standup comics, for instance, the Irish comedian Maeve Higgins.[47] New music from the host, and expanded music in general, have been noted as features of the new program.[48][49] Andrew Leahy of _Rolling Stone_ offers as perspective, that

Thile has indicated that the musical variety of the premiere program (see below) will continue, with listeners to expect "roots-rockers, folksingers, jazz musicians, soul revivalists and bluegrass bands all taking the stage."[50]

Comments on the changeover

In the announcement of the change in host for the program, American Public Media stated:

Keillor, who had made various statements regarding retirement in the past, was described in June 2016 as being "fairly serious this time," and he is quoted as saying "Chris is my man, and I'm eager to stay home and read books."[66] Elaborating further, Keillor wrote to Abe Streep of _The New York Times Magazine_, indicating that Thile's adventurous nature—alongside his high esteem for "the great bluegrass performer"[67]—were reasons for his consideration as Keillor's replacement, which would be tested via a trial run of guest host appearances in January–February 2016;[68] Keillor wrote,

Keillor went on to write about Thile, "He takes big chances ... He can be a chameleon, he can swim in every event, and for all his brilliance, nobody sounds better singing old American songs than he. Nobody."[69]

Thile, in discussing the changeover with Minnesota Public Radio, indicated that he would continue to write new musical material, as he has in initial programs since his debut as host: "I would like to write something new every week ... I've written a new song for each show. I want to keep doing that. It's so much fun."[70] In addition, he has highlighted comedy as an element for the new show, noting the success of appearances of comedian Maria Bamford in shows he had hosted early in 2016 which gave "five or six minutes of hilarity." With regard to story telling, he noted the success of an appearance by actor Ed Helms, indicating that the new _APHC_ will "have that kind of thing going on." When asked about future on-air material from show originator and current executive producer Garrison Keillor, Thile replied, "He's such an amazing writer that if he comes up with an idea that would be good for the show ... I imagine we'll get a script here and there."[71]

APM business strategy

While much media focus during the changeover is on the artistry and styles associated with Keillor and Thile, _APHC_ and American Public Media (APM) are businesses as well; at its peak, the original _APHC_ radio program had garnered in excess of four million weekly listeners, and Rivertown Trading Company, the purveyor of _APHC_-themed products, was sold in 1998 by Minnesota Public Radio for US $120 million.[72] Sensitive to the potential loss of audience with the change at the helm of the show—Thile has said that he knows he will lose some listeners devoted to Keillor, stating that his "goal is to lose one million ... and add two."[73]—the program's distributor, American Public Media, has indicated its intent to ease listeners completely away from experiencing the earlier Keillor format by "mix[ing] in" more than a dozen of the new _APHC_ programs with Thile, alongside a set of reruns where Keillor is at the helm.[74]


Critical response

Writing for the _Chicago Tribune,_ Steve Johnson notes that the new program "still rel[ies] heavily on an air of authenticity derived from its Minnesota locale, [but] now leans a little more toward music," and "away from storytelling."[75] Johnson concludes that the program remains "an easy, graceful listen" featuring "a killer musical repertoire in the Americana tradition," and "humor ranging from corny to cutting."[76]

Not all critics have been as certain that the shift in the show's brand has been a good one. Erik Sherman, writing for _Inc. This Morning_, observed: "...brands are fragile and this one just hit the ground and shattered. ...the new name is _Live From Here_. A more anodyne and empty brand would be difficult to achieve. This is the sort of concoction that a satirist mocking such a production might adopt," and points out that the show's listenership is down by 2.6 million since 2016.[77]


Show history highlights

Thile's first _A Prairie Home Companion with Chris Thile_ took place on October 15, 2016 at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul.[78] Thile's opening program featured Jack White and Lake Street Dive as musical guests, and a new Song of the Week.[79]
