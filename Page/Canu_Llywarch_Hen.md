_CANU LLYWARCH HEN_ (modern Welsh /'kani 'ɬəwarχ heːn/, the songs of Llywarch Hen) are a collection of early Welsh _englyn_-poems. They comprise the most famous of the early Welsh cycles of _englynion_ about heroes of post-Roman North Britain.


Contents and themes

As edited by Jenny Rowland, the contents of _Canu Llywarch Hen_ are as follows:[1]

  Miscellaneous stanzas about Llywarch's sons   These stanzas mention a large range of sons.
  Enwev meibon llywarch hen                     Llywarch laments his lost sons.
  Gwahodd Llywarch i Lanfawr                    Llywarch laments the burden of ruling without his sons.
  Cân yr Henwr                                  Llywarch laments his old age.

The poems contemplate martial, masculine culture, fate, and old age from a critical standpoint. As with the other so-called 'saga _englynion_’ (pre-eminently _Canu Urien_ and _Canu Heledd_), there is considerable uncertainty and debate as to how the poems of _Canu Llywarch_ might originally have been performed. It is usually assumed that they must have been accompanied by some kind of prose narrative, to which they provided emotional depth; but this is not certain.[2]

In all the independent witnesses bar NLW 4973a, the Llywarch Hen poems are preceded by the _englyn_-poem _Claf Abercuawg_, which in the White Book is entitled 'Englynion Mabclaf ap Llywarch' (‘_englynion_ of Mabclaf son of Llywarch’). However, modern scholars do not see it as originally linked to the Llywarch Hen material.[3]


Manuscripts and dating

The poems are attested principally in the late fourteenth-century Red Book of Hergest. They were also included in the White Book of Rhydderch, but are now lost due to damage to the manuscript. However, they are attested in two later manuscripts descended from the White Book, Peniarth 111 (made by John Jones of Gellillyfdy in 1607), whose spelling is very close to the White Book's, and London, British Library, Add. MS 31055 (made by Thomas Wiliems in 1596), which is a less conservative copy.[4] Some other late copies of lost medieval manuscripts of the _englynion_ also exist: National Library of Wales 4973 contains two copies of the cycle, both copied by Dr John Davies of Mallwyd, one of Wales's leading antiquarians and scribes of his day, before 1631.[5] The first copy, NLW 4973a, derives from a lost manuscript closer to the White Book than the Red. The second copy, NLW 4973b, is more complex and may represent a conflation of multiple medieval sources, but seems to have at least some independent value as a witness to the lost archetype of the poems. It is fairly clear that all these manuscripts descend from a lost common original, to which they are all fairly similar, making the creation of a critical edition of the poems relatively straightforward.[6]

Despite surviving first in fourteenth-century manuscripts and in largely Middle Welsh orthography, the poems are thought mostly to have been composed in Old Welsh and transmitted orally and/or in manuscript, due to their archaic style and occasionally archaic spelling. Jenny Rowland judges that the two poems to Llywarch's son Gwên ('Gwên' and 'Marwnad Gwên') belong among the earliest stratum of saga-_englynion_, of the late eighth to the mid-ninth century, whereas some of the poems to his other sons are 'very late' (perhaps the twelfth century).[7]


Historicity

Llywarch Hen himself may have been a historical figure—he appears in early Welsh royal genealogies, which situate him in sixth-century north Britain as a cousin of Urien Rheged (the subject of the stylistically similar _Canu Urien_). However, _Canu Llywarch Hen_ associate Llywarch with Powys in Wales, and it is generally accepted that his story was relocated there by later tradition. It is not unlikely that the poetry of _Canu Llywarch Hen_ was gradually built up from nothing more than these sparse genealogical references, with Llywarch's characterisation as an old man inspired by his epithet.[8]
