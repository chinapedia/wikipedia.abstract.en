On 6 October 2016, at around 15:50 (UTC+3), a bomb attached to a motorcycle blasted in a terrorist attack in Yenibosna neighborhood of Bahçelievler district, İstanbul, Turkey. The bomb targeted a police office, however, either on purpose or not, the bomb was exploded before getting closer to the police station and eventually injured 10 civilians in the area, putting 1 in critical condition.[1][2][3]

The neighborhood is one of the closest ones to the İstanbul Atatürk Airport and İstanbul Inner Beltway and is a neighborhood where Bosniak residents of the city mainly live.

The attack was perpetrated by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The assailant, Felek Gün and co-conspirators Ekrem Gün and Serdar Gün along with 3 more suspects involved in the incident were taken into custody by the police. Assailant had a terrorism record with the outlawed group in both Iraq and Syria, incursing into the Turkish town of Cizre from area controlled by YPG in Syria during the recent Cizre clashes, reports highlighted.[4][5] He was caught in Aksaray Province, on his way to a PKK camp in Syria, with another two of the co-conspirators one day after the attack.[6][7]
