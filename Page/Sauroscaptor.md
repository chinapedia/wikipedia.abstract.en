_SAUROSCAPTOR_ is a genus of cistecephalid dicynodont from the upper Permian of India, containing one species, _S. tharavati_. It is remarkable for the extreme placement of its pineal foramen, which bulges out of the posterior margin of its skull.


Etymology

_Sauroscaptor_ means "lizard mole" or "lizard digger", and is derived from the Greek word σαῦρος, meaning "lizard", and the Greek word σκάπτω, meaning "digger", which is used as a suffix in the Indian mole genera _Euroscaptor_ and _Parascaptor_. The type species, _S. tharavati_, honors Tharavat S. Kutty, discoverer of the Kundaram Formation fauna that includes _Sauroscaptor_.


History

The fossils of _Sauroscaptor_ show various forms of compression, and were originally interpreted as pertaining to several different genera of dicynodont. However, the shared presence of several unique traits not affected by compression proved that the fossils all belonged to a single endemic species.[1]


Description

_Sauroscaptor_, like most cistecephalids, was a tuskless, small-bodied, fossorial dicyonodont.[2] The posterior margin of its pineal foramen bulges out from the back of the skull, resulting in a chimney-like nuchal crest continuous with the foramen. It has a significantly narrower skull table than is typical for cistecephalids. It is closely similar to an unnamed genus from Zambia, which shares the unusual pineal foramen position, but differ in the breadth of the skull table and morphology of the nuchal crest, as well as in the Zambian taxon being the only known tusked cisticephalid.


Classification

_Sauroscaptor_ is the basalmost known cistecephalid dicynodont.[3]
