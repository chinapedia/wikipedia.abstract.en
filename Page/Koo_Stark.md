KATHLEEN NORRIS STARK (born April 26, 1956), better known as KOO STARK, is an American photographer and actress, known for her relationship with Prince Andrew.

As a photographer, she continues to hold solo exhibitions. She is also a patron of the Julia Margaret Cameron Trust.


Early life

Stark's parents were Wilbur Stark (1912–1995), a writer and producer, and Kathi Norris (1919–2005), a writer and television presenter in New York City. She is the youngest of three children, the others being Pamela (born 1946) and Brad (born 1952). At the time of her birth, the family was living in Manhattan.[1] Her grandfather, Edwin Earl Norris (1876–1957) was a cabinetmaker and musician, playing the French horn and the viola in the Newark Symphony Orchestra. The family were Presbyterians.[2][3] After a divorce in the 1960s, her mother remarried.[4]

Koo Stark attended the Hewitt School in New York and the Glendower Preparatory School in Kensington, London. After training at a stage school, she embarked on an acting career.[5][6]

Of working with her in the 1976 film _Emily_, actor Victor Spinetti later wrote "I found Koo Stark to be an enchanting girl and terribly bright and interesting".[7]


Actor

Her first film role was in the comedy _All I Want Is You... and You... and You..._ (1974), produced by her father. In 1975 she appeared in _Las adolescentes_ (The Adolescents), opposite Anthony Andrews,[8] and starred in an episode of _Shades of Greene_.[9] Also that year she had an uncredited role as a bridesmaid in _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_. Her best remembered performance is the lead role in the avant-garde film _Emily_ (1976), directed by Henry Herbert, 17th Earl of Pembroke.[10] Uncertain whether to accept the part, Stark did so on the advice of Graham Greene, with whom she had worked the year before. She also starred in _Cruel Passion_ (1977), a film based on the novel _Justine_.[11] Around the same time, she played the part of Camie Marstrap in _Star Wars_ (1977); the scenes in which she appeared were cut from the film before release,[12] but can be seen in _Star Wars: Behind the Magic_ (1998).[13]

Stark also began to work as a fashion model, particularly for Norman Parkinson.[14] In February 1981 she was at the National Theatre as an understudy in the Edward Albee play _Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?_[15]

She appeared in the comedy _Eat the Rich_ (1987), and then featured in "Timeslides", an episode of the sci-fi show _Red Dwarf_ (1989), playing Lady Sabrina Mulholland-Jones, the fiancée of a more successful Dave Lister in a parallel universe.[16]

In September 1987 she returned to the stage, taking the part of Vera Claybourne in Agatha Christie's _And Then There Were None_ at the Duke of York's Theatre.[17] The _London Theatre Record_ posed the question "Why has a girl so obviously three-dimensional chosen a part so obviously two-dimensional?"[18] She played Miss Scarlett in the 1991 series of _Cluedo_, succeeding Toyah Willcox and befriending Rula Lenska.[19]


Photographer

Stark has worked as a photographer since the 1980s, and may have been the first person to turn the tables on the pursuing paparazzi by taking photos of them.[20] Prince Andrew has told how in 1983 a photographic printer, Gene Nocon, invited Stark to take photographs of people taking photos of her, for his exhibition, "Personal Points of View", planned for October. She also persuaded Nocon to include Andrew's work as well.[21] Her early photographs led to a book deal, for which she took lessons from Norman Parkinson. She travelled to Tobago, where he lived, and he became her mentor. Her book _Contrasts_ (1985) included about a hundred of her photographs. She went on to study the work of leading photographers, including Angus McBean, whom she met and photographed,[22] developing her interests in photography to include reportage, portraits, landscapes, still life, and other work.[23]

The book, _Contrasts_ was launched at Hamiltons Gallery, London, in September 1985, at an exhibition of the same name.[24] In 1994 the Gallery Bar at the Grosvenor House Hotel in Park Lane hosted an exhibition called 'The Stark Image', forty photographs by Stark, including several previously unpublished.[25] In 1998 her work was featured at the Como Lario in Holbein Place, Belgravia.[26] In July 2001 she had an exhibition called 'Stark Images" at the Fruitmarket Gallery in Edinburgh,[27] duplicated from June to July 2001 at Dimbola Lodge on the Isle of Wight.[28] A solo exhibition of portraits was at the Winter Gardens, Ventnor, from September to October 2010,[29] and another at Dimbola Lodge from February to April, 2011.[30]

On 22 April 1987 a charity auction at Christie's, St James's, for the Campaign to Protect Rural England, featured signed work by David Bailey, Patrick Lichfield, Don McCullin, Terence Donovan, Fay Godwin, Heather Angel, Clive Arrowsmith, Linda McCartney, Koo Stark, and fifteen others,[31][32][33] Views by Stark, including some of Kirby Muxloe Castle, were in G. H. Davies's _England's Glory_ (1987), a CPRE book launched at the same time.[34]

Pictures by Stark have appeared in _Country Life_[35] and other magazines. Several of her portraits are in the National Gallery,[36] and work is also in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum.[37]

A Leica user, Stark has said her camera transcends mere function and is a personal friend.[38] A solo exhibition hosted by the Leica gallery in Mayfair in May 2017 was entitled _Kintsugi_, a Japanese word for a way of renovating things that have been broken. Stark explained the title: "Kintsugi is a way of learning to see individual beauty, and to appreciate the value of experience and honesty. It is the antithesis of digital, airbrushed, Photoshop-homogenised ‘beauty’."[39] In August the exhibition was repeated in Manchester, to mark the opening of a new Leica store there.[40]


Personal life

Stark met Prince Andrew in February 1981, and they were close for some two years, before and after his active service in the Falklands War.[41][42] Tina Brown has claimed that this was Andrew's only serious love affair.[43] In October 1982 they took a holiday together on the island of Mustique.[44] According to Lady Colin Campbell, Andrew was in love, and the Queen was "much taken with the elegant, intelligent, and discreet Koo".[45] However, in 1983 they split up, under pressure from press, paparazzi, and palace.[46][47] In 1988 Stark said "The amount of attention and pressure on me became unbearable. It was a nightmare."[48] Also in 1988 she brought a successful libel action against _The Mail on Sunday_ over an untrue story headed 'Koo dated Andy after she wed'.[49] In 1989 _The Spectator_ reported that she had received £300,000 from one newspaper "for years of inaccurate persecution" and was also collecting money from others.[50] In 1997 Andrew became the godfather of Stark's daughter,[51] and in 2015, when Andrew was facing accusations from Virginia Roberts over the Jeffrey Epstein connection, Stark came to his defence, stating that he was a good man and she could help to rebut the claims.[52]

Stark married Tim Jeffries, manager of a photographic gallery, in August 1984,[53] at St Saviour's, Hampstead, with the minister, Christopher Neil-Smith, commenting that "It was such a quiet affair you wouldn't have known it was happening."[54] They stayed together for a year and later divorced.[55]

About 1993, Stark was hit by a taxi in Old Compton Street, losing two teeth and also suffering a deep wound to her forehead, dented by collision with her camera. This accident left her temporarily disfigured, but the wound eventually closed leaving a small scar just under the hair-line.[56] She has been a practising Buddhist since meeting the Dalai Lama.[57]

She was later engaged to Warren Walker, an American banker, but he cancelled their wedding before the birth of their daughter, Tatiana, in May 1997.[58]

In 2002 Stark was diagnosed with breast cancer and endured a double mastectomy and chemotherapy, causing her to lose her hair for a time.[59]

In another libel action in 2007, Stark won an apology and substantial damages from _Zoo Weekly_ magazine, which had described her as a porn star. She commented "I am relieved that my name has been cleared of this false, highly damaging and serious allegation which has been proved to be completely untrue."[60] In 2011, _The Daily Telegraph_ called her an early Kate Middleton prototype and suggested that if she had not appeared in the film _Emily_ early in her career she might have gone on to become the Duchess of York.[61]

In February 2015, _Daily Mail_ printed an apology and retraction of the claim it had printed in June 2013 that Stark had stolen a valuable painting from Warren Walker.[62]

Stark continues to live in London and is a member of the Chelsea Arts Club.[63] She is a Patron of the Julia Margaret Cameron Trust.[64]

She went to see photographic printer Gene Nocon. At this time Gene was organising an exhibition planned for October 1983. The theme was photographs taken by people who were the subjects of photographers. He invited her to take part. It was called "Personal Points of View". Koo came to see me and suggested that I should take part as well. I replied that I was sure that I wouldn't be allowed to. Koo then went back to see Gene without my knowledge and asked him if a friend of hers could also take part. Although Koo was reluctant to name names and Gene was equally reluctant to agree to an unknown person taking part, it seems they came to an understanding..."
