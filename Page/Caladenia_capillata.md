_CALADENIA CAPILLATA_, commonly known as WHITE DADDY LONG LEGS or WISPY SPIDER ORCHID, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to Victoria and South Australia. It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and up to three cream-coloured to yellowish flowers with long, thread-like petals and sepals and a very small labellum.


Description

_Caladenia capillata_ is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb which often grows in clumps. It has an underground tuber and a single, very hairy, narrow linear leaf, long and wide.[1][2]

There are up to three, sometimes four flowers borne on a slender, very hairy spike high. The dorsal and lateral sepals and the petals are greyish cream to creamy white, sometimes with reddish streaks, long, about wide at the base and taper to a long, thread-like tip. All are covered with glandular hairs and have drooping tips. The labellum is long, about wide and egg-shaped when flattened. The labellum has many short, broad teeth along its edge and there are two rows of flattened calli in its centre. This species is similar to _Caladenia filamentosa_ but is usually not as tall and the flowers not as red as those of that species. Flowering occurs from August to November.[3][4]


Taxonomy and naming

This species was first formally described by Ralph Tate in 1889 and given the name _Caladenia tentaculata_[5] but that name was invalid because the name had already been given to a different species by Schlechtendal.[6] In 1922, R.S.Rogers changed the name to _Caladenia filamentosa_ var. _tentaculata_[7] and in 2000 David L. Jones raised it to species level with the name _Caladenia capillata_.[8]

Tate's original description was published in _Transactions, proceedings and report, Royal Society of South Australia_ from a specimen collected "45 miles due west of Port Augusta".[9] The specific epithet (capillata) is derived from the Latin word _capillus_ meaning "hair".[10]

Confusion remains over the naming of this species because Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown described _Caladenia paradoxa_ in 2001, unaware of Jones's description of _Caladenia capillata_ and it is possible that the two species are synonymous.[11] The State Herbarium of South Australia continues to use the name _Caladenia filamentosa_ var. _tentaculata_.[12]


Distribution and habitat

This caladenia grows in north-western Victoria in mallee scrub and in heath, malle or light scrub in rocky places in South Australia.[13][14]
