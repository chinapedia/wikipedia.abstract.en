DANNY SEUNG-JOO CHOI (born 6 December 1994) is a South Korean professional footballer who plays as a winger for F.C. Oliveira do Hospital.


Early life

Choi was raised in Suwon, South Korea before moving to Australia in fifth grade, and spent five years in the country before returning to South Korea to play for Daejeon Citizen.[1] He returned to Australia three years later, where his family still lived and believing that his footballing style was better adapted to Australian competition.[2]


Club career

Choi's first senior club in Australia was Parramatta FC, where he was the side's Player of the Year in 2013.[3]

On 27 July 2016, Choi scored a 70 yard goal from inside his own half in extra time to help Blacktown City to a win over Sydney United in the Round of 32 of the 2016 FFA Cup.[4]

In October 2016, Choi signed with A-League club Adelaide United on an injury replacement contract for Marcelo Carrusca.[5] He made his debut later in the month, hitting the post with a late shot in a loss to Melbourne Victory.[6] He was released by Adelaide after Carrusca returned to the squad and Choi himself suffered a stress fracture in his foot.[7][8]
