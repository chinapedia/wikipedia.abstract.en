In Nepalese folklore or mythology, a Kichkandi is a spirit of a woman[1] that is latched to an uncremated part of her dead body, usually a bone.

They are generally known to be solitary spirits that haunt a particular location. According to sightings, they are supposed to have unusually long black hair, pale and bony complexion and dressed up in a white attire. It is said that they can be identified by looking at their feet, which face backwards.

People usually describe them as an alluring and young female, who lures a lonely male traveler[2] and saps their life force. The victims are said to turn out drained of their life and skinny.
