Plot

Cassandra "Cas" Leung has always expected to become a military trainer who works with the giant sea monsters called Reckoners, like her parents before her. During her first real mission, the Reckoner she's spent her entire life is killed, and she's captured by the notorious pirate Santa Elena.

While Cas is expected to commit suicide with a cyanide pill, her captor â€“ a pirate named Swift stops her and hauls her in front of Santa Elena. The pirate queen shows her a young Reckoner pup, ordering her to raise and train it. Cas tries to subvert Elena's manipulation, but her inexperience leads the pirate queen to outwit her, and her growing relationship with Swift offers a new vulnerability for Elena to exploit.
