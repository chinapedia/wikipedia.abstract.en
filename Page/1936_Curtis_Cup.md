The 3RD CURTIS CUP MATCH was played on 6 May 1936 on the King's Course at Gleneagles Hotel in Auchterarder, Perthshire, Scotland. The match ended in a tie at 4½ each and the United States, as the holders, retained the trophy.[1][2]

The final match to finish was between Jessie Anderson and Leona Cheney. America led 4½–3½ and had already retained the Cup but Britain could still tie the contest. Anderson and Cheney were all square after 17 holes. Cheney took 5 at the last but Anderson holed a putt of 7 or 8 yards for a 4, to win her match and tie the contest.[3][4]


Format

The contest was played in a single day, with three foursomes in the morning and six singles matches in the afternoon, a total of 9 points.

Each of the 9 matches was worth one point in the larger team competition. If a match was all square after the 18th hole extra holes were not played. Rather, each side earned ½ a point toward their team total. The team that accumulated at least 5 points won the competition.

Eight players for Great Britain & Ireland and USA participated in the event.
