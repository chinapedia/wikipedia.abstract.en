Completed in 2004, Samir Kassir Square is 815 square meters located in Beirut, Lebanon.[1] Vladimir Djurovic Landscape Architecture was responsible for the design.[2] The square acts as a gateway to Central Beirut. The small square frames two ancient ficus trees which anchor the project. The squareâ€™s design acts as a green urban oasis in a hectic city. A serene space that reflects memories through its reflection of the skyline. The trees act as shelters from the surrounding context. A raised water feature adjacent to the street physically demarcates the boundaries. Simple in design, the square creates an intimate space for contemplation and relaxation.[3]
