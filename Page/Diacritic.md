A DIACRITIC – also DIACRITICAL MARK, DIACRITICAL POINT, DIACRITICAL SIGN, or ACCENT – is a glyph added to a letter or basic glyph. The term derives from the Ancient Greek (_diakritikós_, "distinguishing"), from (_diakrī́nō_, "to distinguish"). _Diacritic_ is primarily an adjective, though sometimes used as a noun, whereas _diacritical_ is only ever an adjective. Some diacritical marks, such as the acute ( ´ ) and grave ( ` ), are often called _accents_. Diacritical marks may appear above or below a letter, or in some other position such as within the letter or between two letters.

The main use of diacritical marks in the Latin script is to change the sound-values of the letters to which they are added. Examples are the diaereses in the borrowed French words _naïve_ and _Noël_, which show that the vowel with the diaeresis mark is pronounced separately from the preceding vowel; the acute and grave accents, which can indicate that a final vowel is to be pronounced, as in _saké_ and poetic _breathèd_; and the cedilla under the "c" in the borrowed French word _façade_, which shows it is pronounced rather than . In other Latin-script alphabets, they may distinguish between homonyms, such as the French _là_ ("there") versus _la_ ("the") that are both pronounced . In Gaelic type, a dot over a consonant indicates lenition of the consonant in question.

In other alphabetic systems, diacritical marks may perform other functions. Vowel pointing systems, namely the Arabic harakat (  etc.) and the Hebrew niqqud (  etc.) systems, indicate vowels that are not conveyed by the basic alphabet. The Indic virama ( ् etc.) and the Arabic sukūn (  ) mark the absence of vowels. Cantillation marks indicate prosody. Other uses include the Early Cyrillic titlo stroke ( ◌҃ ) and the Hebrew gershayim (  ), which, respectively, mark abbreviations or acronyms, and Greek diacritical marks, which showed that letters of the alphabet were being used as numerals. In the Hanyu Pinyin official romanization system for Chinese, diacritics are used to mark the tones of the syllables in which the marked vowels occur.

In orthography and collation, a letter modified by a diacritic may be treated either as a new, distinct letter or as a letter–diacritic combination. This varies from language to language, and may vary from case to case within a language. English is the only major modern European language requiring no diacritics for native words (although a diaeresis may be used in words such as "coöperation").[1][2]

In some cases, letters are used as "in-line diacritics", with the same function as ancillary glyphs, in that they modify the sound of the letter preceding them, as in the case of the "h" in the English pronunciation of "sh" and "th".[3]


Types

Among the types of diacritic used in alphabets based on the Latin script are:

-   accents (so called because the acute, grave, and circumflex were originally used to indicate different types of pitch accents in the polytonic transcription of Greek)
    -   ◌́ – acute (Latin _apex_)
    -   ◌̀ – grave
    -   ◌̂ – circumflex
    -   ◌̌ – caron, wedge (Czech _háček_, Slovak _mäkčeň_)
    -   ◌̋ – double acute
    -   ◌̏ – double grave
    -   ◌̃ - tilde
-   dots
    -   ◌̇ – overdot (Indic _anusvara_)
    -   ◌̣ – an underdot is used in Rheinische Dokumenta and in Hebrew, Indic and Arabic transcription
    -   ◌·◌ – interpunct
    -   tittle, the superscript dot of the modern lowercase Latin _i_ and _j_
    -   ◌̈ – diaeresis or umlaut
    -   ◌ː – triangular colon, used in the IPA to mark long vowels.
-   curves
    -   ◌̆ – breve
    -   ◌̑ - inverted breve
    -   ◌͗ – sicilicus, a palaeographic diacritic similar to a caron or breve
    -   ◌̃ – tilde
    -   ◌҃ – titlo
-   vertical stroke
    -   ◌̩ – syllabic a subscript vertical stroke is used in IPA to mark syllabicity and in Rheinische Dokumenta to mark a schwa
-   macron or horizontal line
    -   ◌̄ – macron

    -   ◌̊ – overring
-   superscript curls
    -   ◌̓ – apostrophe
    -   ◌̒ — inverted apostrophe
    -   ◌̔ - reversed apostrophe
    -   '''◌̉ ''' – hoi (Vietnamese _dấu hỏi_)
    -   ◌̛ – horn (Vietnamese _dấu móc_)

    -   ◌̧ – cedilla
    -   ◌̡ ◌̢ – hook, left or right, sometimes superscript
    -   ◌̨ – ogonek
-   double marks (over or under two base characters)
    -   ◌͝◌ – double breve
    -   ◌͡◌ – tie bar or top ligature
    -   ◌᷍◌ – double circumflex
    -   ◌͞◌ – longum
    -   ◌͠◌ – double tilde
-   double sub/superscript diacritics
    -   ◌̧ ̧ - double cedilla
    -   ◌̨ ̨ - double ogonek
    -   ◌̈ ̈ - double diaeresis
    -   '''◌ͅͺ ''' - double ypogegrammeni

The tilde, dot, comma, titlo, apostrophe, bar, and colon are sometimes diacritical marks, but also have other uses.

Not all diacritics occur adjacent to the letter they modify. In the Wali language of Ghana, for example, an apostrophe indicates a change of vowel quality, but occurs at the beginning of the word, as in the dialects _’Bulengee_ and _’Dolimi_. Because of vowel harmony, all vowels in a word are affected, so the scope of the diacritic is the entire word. In abugida scripts, like those used to write Hindi and Thai, diacritics indicate vowels, and may occur above, below, before, after, or around the consonant letter they modify.

The tittle (dot) on the letter _i_ or the letter _j_, of the Latin alphabet originated as a diacritic to clearly distinguish _i_ from the minims (downstrokes) of adjacent letters. It first appeared in the 11th century in the sequence _ii_ (as in _ingeníí)_, then spread to _i_ adjacent to _m, n, u_, and finally to all lowercase _i_'s. The _j_, originally a variant of _i_, inherited the tittle. The shape of the diacritic developed from initially resembling today's acute accent to a long flourish by the 15th century. With the advent of Roman type it was reduced to the round dot we have today.[4]

Languages from Eastern Europe tend to use diacritics on both consonants and vowels, whereas in Western Europe digraphs are more typically used to change consonant sounds. Most languages in Western Europe use diacritics on vowels, aside from English where they are typically none (with some exceptions).


Diacritics specific to non-Latin alphabets

Arabic

-   (ئ ؤ إ أ and stand alone ء) _hamza_: indicates a glottal stop.
-   (ــًــٍــٌـ) _tanwīn_ (تنوين) symbols: Serve a grammatical role in Arabic. The sign ـً is most commonly written in combination with alif, e.g. ـًا.
-   (ــّـ) _shadda_: Gemination (doubling) of consonants.
-   (ٱ) _waṣla_: Comes most commonly at the beginning of a word. Indicates a type of hamza that is pronounced only when the letter is read at the beginning of the talk.
-   (آ) _madda_: A written replacement for a hamza that is followed by an alif, i.e. (ءا). Read as a glottal stop followed by a long , e.g. ءاداب، ءاية، قرءان، مرءاة are written out respectively as آداب، آية، قرآن، مرآة. This writing rule does not apply when the alif that follows a hamza is not a part of the stem of the word, e.g. نتوءات is not written out as نتوآت as the stem نتوء does not have an alif that follows its hamza.
-   (ــٰـ) _superscript alif_ (also "short" or "dagger alif": A replacement for an original alif that is dropped in the writing out of some rare words, e.g. لاكن is not written out with the original alif found in the word pronunciation, instead it is written out as لٰكن.
-   _ḥarakāt_ (In Arabic: حركات also called تشكيل _tashkīl_):
    -   (ــَـ) _fatḥa_ (a)
    -   (ــِـ) _kasra_ (i)
    -   (ــُـ) _ḍamma_ (u)
    -   (ــْـ) _sukūn_ (no vowel)
-   The _ḥarakāt_ or vowel points serve two purposes:
    -   They serve as a phonetic guide. They indicate the presence of short vowels _(fatḥa, kasra, or ḍamma)_ or their absence _(sukūn)._
    -   At the last letter of a word, the vowel point reflects the inflection case or conjugation mood.
        -   For nouns, The _ḍamma_ is for the nominative, _fatḥa_ for the accusative, and _kasra_ for the genitive.
        -   For verbs, the _ḍamma_ is for the imperfective, _fatḥa_ for the perfective, and the _sukūn_ is for verbs in the imperative or jussive moods.
-   Vowel points or _tashkīl_ should not be confused with consonant points or _iʿjam_ (إعجام) – one, two or three dots written above or below a consonant to distinguish between letters of the same or similar form.

Greek

These diacritics are used in addition to the acute, grave, and circumflex accents and the diaeresis:

-   – iota subscript

-   – rough breathing (_spiritus asper_): aspiration

-   – smooth (or soft) breathing (_spiritus lenis_): lack of aspiration

Hebrew

Korean

, the Korean alphabet]] The diacritics >〮 and _' 〯_'  , known as Bangjeom (), were used to mark pitch accents in Hangul for Middle Korean. They were written to the left of a syllable in vertical writing and above a syllable in horizontal writing.

The South Korean government officially revised the romanization of the Korean language in July 2000 to eliminate diacritics.

Sanskrit and Indic

Syriac

-   A dot above and a dot below a letter represent , transliterated as _a_ or _ă_,
-   Two diagonally-placed dots above a letter represent , transliterated as _ā_ or _â_ or _å_,
-   Two horizontally-placed dots below a letter represent , transliterated as _e_ or _ĕ_; often pronounced and transliterated as _i_ in the East Syriac dialect,
-   Two diagonally-placed dots below a letter represent , transliterated as _ē_,
-   A dot underneath the _Beth_ represent a soft sound, transliterated as _v_
-   A tilde (~) placed under _Gamel_ represent a sound, transliterated as _j_
-   The letter _Waw_ with a dot below it represents , transliterated as _ū_ or _u_,
-   The letter _Waw_ with a dot above it represents , transliterated as _ō_ or _o_,
-   The letter _Yōḏ_ with a dot beneath it represents , transliterated as _ī_ or _i_,
-   A tilde (~) under _Kaph_ represent a sound, transliterated as _ch_ or _č_,
-   A semicircle under _Peh_ represents an sound, transliterated as _f_ or _ph_.

In addition to the above vowel marks, transliteration of Syriac sometimes includes _ə_, _e̊_ or superscript _^(e)_ (or often nothing at all) to represent an original Aramaic schwa that became lost later on at some point in the development of Syriac.[5] Some transliteration schemes find its inclusion necessary for showing spirantization or for historical reasons.[6][7]


Non-alphabetic scripts

Some non-alphabetic scripts also employ symbols that function essentially as diacritics.

-   Non-pure abjads (such as Hebrew and Arabic script) and abugidas use diacritics for denoting vowels. Hebrew and Arabic also indicate consonant doubling and change with diacritics; Hebrew and Devanagari use them for foreign sounds. Devanagari and related abugidas also use a diacritical mark called a _virama_ to mark the absence of a vowel. In addition, Devanagari uses the moon-dot _chandrabindu_ (''' ँ ''').
-   Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics use several types of diacritics, including the diacritics with alphabetic properties known as Medials and Finals. Although long vowels originally were indicated with a negative line through the Syllabic glyphs, making the glyph appear broken, in the modern forms, a dot above is used to indicate vowel length. In some of the styles, a ring above indicates a long vowel with a [j] off-glide. Another diacritic, the "inner ring" is placed at the glyph's head to modify [p] to [f] and [t] to [θ]. Medials such as the "w-dot" placed next to the Syllabics glyph indicates a [w] being placed between the syllable onset consonant and the nucleus vowel. Finals indicate the syllable coda consonant; some of the syllable coda consonants in word medial positions, such as with the "h-tick", indicate the fortification of the consonant in the syllable following it.
-   The Japanese _hiragana_ and _katakana_ syllabaries use the _dakuten_ (◌゛) and _handakuten_ (◌゜) (in Japanese: 濁点 and 半濁点) symbols, also known as _nigori_ (濁 "muddying") or _ten-ten_ (点々 "dot dot") and _maru_ (丸 "circle"), to indicate voiced consonants or other phonetic changes.
-   Emoticons are commonly created with diacritic symbols, especially Japanese emoticons on popular imageboards.


Alphabetization or collation

Different languages use different rules to put diacritic characters in alphabetical order. French treats letters with diacritical marks the same as the underlying letter for purposes of ordering and dictionaries.

The Scandinavian languages, by contrast, treat the characters with diacritics _ä_, _ö_ and _å_ as new and separate letters of the alphabet, and sort them after _z_. Usually _ä_ is sorted as equal to _æ_ (ash) and _ö_ is sorted as equal to _ø_ (o-slash). Also, _aa_, when used as an alternative spelling to _å_, is sorted as such. Other letters modified by diacritics are treated as variants of the underlying letter, with the exception that _ü_ is frequently sorted as _y_.

Languages that treat accented letters as variants of the underlying letter usually alphabetize words with such symbols immediately after similar unmarked words. For instance, in German where two words differ only by an umlaut, the word without it is sorted first in German dictionaries (e.g. _schon_ and then _schön_, or _fallen_ and then _fällen_). However, when names are concerned (e.g. in phone books or in author catalogues in libraries), umlauts are often treated as combinations of the vowel with a suffixed _e_; Austrian phone books now treat characters with umlauts as separate letters (immediately following the underlying vowel).

In Spanish, the grapheme _ñ_ is considered a new letter different from _n_ and collated between _n_ and _o_, as it denotes a different sound from that of a plain _n_. But the accented vowels _á_, _é_, _í_, _ó_, _ú_ are not separated from the unaccented vowels _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_, _u_, as the acute accent in Spanish only modifies stress within the word or denotes a distinction between homonyms, and does not modify the sound of a letter.

For a comprehensive list of the collating orders in various languages, see Collating sequence.


Generation with computers

Modern computer technology was developed mostly in English-speaking countries, so data formats, keyboard layouts, etc. were developed with a bias favoring English, a language with an alphabet without diacritical marks. This has led some to theorize that the marks and accents may be made obsolete to facilitate the worldwide exchange of data. Efforts have been made to create internationalized domain names that further extend the English alphabet (e.g., "pokémon.com").

Depending on the keyboard layout, which differs amongst countries, it is more or less easy to enter letters with diacritics on computers and typewriters. Some have their own keys; some are created by first pressing the key with the diacritic mark followed by the letter to place it on. Such a key is sometimes referred to as a dead key, as it produces no output of its own but modifies the output of the key pressed after it.

In modern Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems, the keyboard layouts _US International_ and _UK International_ feature dead keys that allow one to type Latin letters with the acute, grave, circumflex, diæresis, tilde, and cedilla found in Western European languages (specifically, those combinations found in the ISO Latin-1 character set) directly: + gives _ë_, + gives _õ_, etc. On Apple Macintosh computers, there are keyboard shortcuts for the most common diacritics; followed by a vowel places an acute accent, followed by a vowel gives an umlaut, gives a cedilla, etc. Diacritics can be composed in most X Window System keyboard layouts, as well as other operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, using additional software.

On computers, the availability of code pages determines whether one can use certain diacritics. Unicode solves this problem by assigning every known character its own code; if this code is known, most modern computer systems provide a method to input it. With Unicode, it is also possible to combine diacritical marks with most characters.


Languages with letters containing diacritics

The following languages have letters that contain diacritics that are considered independent letters distinct from those without diacritics.

Baltic

:* Latvian has the following letters: _ā, ē, ī, ū, č, ģ, ķ, ļ, ņ, š, ž_

:* Lithuanian. In general usage, where letters appear with the caron (_č, š_ and _ž_), they are considered as separate letters from _c, s_ or _z_ and collated separately; letters with the ogonek (_ą, ę, į_ and _ų_), the macron (_ū_) and the superdot (_ė_) are considered as separate letters as well, but not given a unique collation order.

Celtic

:* Welsh uses the circumflex, diaeresis, acute, and grave on its seven vowels _a, e, i, o, u, w, y_ (â, ê, î, ô, û, ŵ, ŷ, ä, ë, ï, ö, ü, ẅ, ÿ, à, è, ì, ò, ù, ẁ, ỳ, á, é, í, ó, ú, ẃ, ý)

:* Following spelling reforms since the 1970s, Scottish Gaelic uses graves only, which can be used on any vowel (_à, è, ì, ò, ù_). Formerly acute accents could be used on _á, ó_ and _é_, which were used to indicate a specific vowel quality. With the elimination of these accents, the new orthography relies on the reader having prior knowledge of pronunciation of a given word.

:* Manx uses the single diacritic ç combined with h to give the digraph (pronounced ) to mark the distinction between it and the digraph (pronounced or ). Other diacritics used in Manx included â, ê, ï, etc. to mark the distinction between two similarly spelled words but with slightly differing pronunciation.

:* Irish uses only acute accents to mark long vowels, following the 1948 spelling reform.

:* Breton does not have a single orthography (spelling system), but uses diacritics for a number of purposes. The diaresis is used to mark that two vowels are pronounced separately and not as a diphthong/digraph. The circumflex is used to mark long vowels, but usually only when the vowel length is not predictable by phonology. Nasalization of vowels may be marked with a tilde, or following the vowel with the letter . The plural suffix -où is used as a unified spelling to represent a suffix with a number of pronunciations in different dialects, and to distinguish this suffix from the digraph which is pronounced as /u:/. An apostrophe is used to distinguish c'h, pronounced /x/ as the digraph is used in other Celtic languages, from the French-influenced digraph ch, pronounced /ʃ/.

Cyrillic alphabets

:* Belarusian has a letter _ў_.

:* Belarusian, Bulgarian, Russian and Ukrainian have the letter _й_.

:* Belarusian and Russian have the letter _ё_. In Russian, this letter is usually replaced by _е_, although it has a different pronunciation. The use of _е_ instead of _ё_ does not affect the pronunciation. _Ё_ is always used in children's books and in dictionaries. A minimal pair is все (_vs'e_, "everybody" pl.) and всё (_vs'o_, "everything" n. sg.). In Belarusian the replacement by _е_ is a mistake, in Russian, it is permissible to use either _е_ or _ё_ for _ё_ but the former is more common in everyday writing (as opposed to instructional or juvenile writing).

:* The Cyrillic Ukrainian alphabet has the letters _ґ_, _й_ and _ї_. Ukrainian Latynka has many more.

:* Macedonian has the letters _ќ_ and _ѓ_.

* In Bulgarian and Macedonian the possessive pronoun ѝ (_ì_, "her") is spelled with a grave accent in order to distinguish it from the conjunction и (_i_, "and").

:* The acute accent " ́" above any vowel in Cyrillic alphabets is used in dictionaries, books for children and foreign learners to indicate the word stress, it also can be used for disambiguation of similarly spelled words with different lexical stresses.

Finno-Ugric

:* Estonian has a distinct letter _õ_, which contains a tilde. Estonian "dotted vowels" _ä_, _ö_, _ü_ are similar to German, but these are also distinct letters, not like German umlauted letters. All four have their own place in the alphabet, between _w_ and _x_. Carons in _š_ or _ž_ appear only in foreign proper names and loanwords. Also these are distinct letters, placed in the alphabet between _s_ and _t_.

:* Finnish uses dotted vowels (_ä_ and _ö_). As in Swedish and Estonian, these are regarded as individual letters, rather than vowel + umlaut combinations (as happens in German). It also uses the characters _å_, _š_ and _ž_ in foreign names and loanwords. In the Finnish and Swedish alphabets, _å_, _ä_ and _ö_ collate as separate letters after _z_, the others as variants of their base letter.

:* Hungarian uses the umlaut, the acute and double acute accent (unique to Hungarian): (_ö, ü_), (_á, é, í, ó, ú_) and (_ő, ű_). The acute accent indicates the long form of a vowel (in case of _i/í_, _o/ó_, _u/ú_) while the double acute performs the same function for _ö_ and _ü_. The acute accent can also indicate a different sound (more open, like in case of _a/á_, _e/é_). Both long and short forms of the vowels are listed separately in the Hungarian alphabet, but members of the pairs _a/á, e/é, i/í, o/ó, ö/ő, u/ú_ and _ü/ű_ are collated in dictionaries as the same letter.

:* Livonian has the following letters: _ā, ä, ǟ, ḑ, ē, ī, ļ, ņ, ō, ȯ, ȱ, õ, ȭ, ŗ, š, ț, ū, ž_.

Germanic

:* Faroese uses acutes and other special letters. All are considered separate letters and have their own place in the alphabet: _á_, _í_, _ó_, _ú_, _ý_ and _ø_.

:* Icelandic uses acutes and other special letters. All are considered separate letters, and have their own place in the alphabet: _á_, _é_, _í_, _ó_, _ú_, _ý_, and _ö_.

:* Danish and Norwegian use additional characters like the o-slash _ø_ and the a-overring _å_. These letters come after _z_ and _æ_ in the order _ø, å_. Historically, the _å_ has developed from a ligature by writing a small superscript _a_ over a lowercase _a_; if an _å_ character is unavailable, some Scandinavian languages allow the substitution of a doubled _a_. The Scandinavian languages collate these letters after z, but have different collation standards.

:* Swedish uses a-diaeresis (_ä_) and o-diaeresis (_ö_) in the place of ash (_æ_) and slashed o (_ø_) in addition to the a-overring (_å_). Historically, the diaeresis for the Swedish letters _ä_ and _ö_, like the German umlaut, developed from a small Gothic _e_ written above the letters. These letters are collated after _z_, in the order _å, ä, ö_.

Romance

:* In Asturian, Galician and Spanish, the character _ñ_ is a letter and collated between _n_ and _o_.

:* Asturian uses Ḷ (lower case ḷ), and Ḥ (lower case ḥ)[8]

:* Leonese: could use _ñ_ or _nn_.

:* Romanian uses a breve on the letter _a_ (_ă_) to indicate the sound schwa , as well as a circumflex over the letters _a_ (_â_) and _i_ (_î_) for the sound . Romanian also writes a comma below the letters _s_ (_ș_) and _t_ (_ț_) to represent the sounds and , respectively. These characters are collated after their non-diacritic equivalent.

Slavic

:* The Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian Latin alphabets have the symbols _č_, _ć_, _đ_, _š_ and _ž_, which are considered separate letters and are listed as such in dictionaries and other contexts in which words are listed according to alphabetical order. They also have one digraph including a diacritic, _dž_, which is also alphabetized independently, and follows _d_ and precedes _đ_ in the alphabetical order. The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet has no diacritics, instead it has a grapheme (glyph) for every letter of its Latin counterpart (including Latin letters with diacritics and the digraphs dž, _lj_ and _nj_).

:* The Czech alphabet uses the acute (á é í ó ú ý), caron (č ď ě ň ř š ť ž), and for one letter (ů) the ring. (Note that in ď and ť the caron is modified to look lither like an apostrophe.)

:* Polish has the following letters: _ą ć ę ł ń ó ś ź ż_. These are considered to be separate letters: each of them is placed in the alphabet immediately after its Latin counterpart (e.g. _ą_ between _a_ and _b_), _ź_ and _ż_ are placed after _z_ in that order.

:* The Slovak alphabet uses the acute (á é í ó ú ý ĺ ŕ), caron (č ď ľ ň š ť ž), umlaut (ä) and circumflex accent (ô).[9]

:* The basic Slovenian alphabet has the symbols _č_, _š_, and _ž_, which are considered separate letters and are listed as such in dictionaries and other contexts in which words are listed according to alphabetical order. Letters with a caron are placed right after the letters as written without the diacritic. The letter _đ_ may be used in non-transliterated foreign words, particularly names, and is placed after _č_ and before _d_.

Turkic

:* Azerbaijani includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters Ç, Ğ, I, İ, Ö, Ş and Ü.

:* Crimean Tatar includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters Ç, Ğ, I, İ, Ö, Ş and Ü. Unlike Standard Turkish (but like Cypriot Turkish), Crimean Tatar also has the letter Ñ.

:* Gagauz includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters Ç, Ğ, I, İ, Ö and Ü. Unlike Turkish, Gagauz also has the letters Ä, Ê Ș and Ț. Ș and Ț are derived from the Romanian alphabet for the same sounds. Sometime the Turkish Ş may be used instead of Ș.

:* Turkish uses a _G_ with a breve (_Ğ_), two letters with an umlaut (_Ö_ and _Ü_, representing two rounded front vowels), two letters with a cedilla (_Ç_ and _Ş_, representing the affricate and the fricative ), and also possesses a dotted capital _İ_ (and a dotless lowercase _ı_ representing a high unrounded back vowel). In Turkish each of these are separate letters, rather than versions of other letters, where dotted capital _İ_ and lower case _i_ are the same letter, as are dotless capital _I_ and lowercase _ı_. Typographically, _Ç_ and _Ş_ are often rendered with a subdot, as in _Ṣ_; when a hook is used, it tends to have more a comma shape than the usual cedilla. The new Azerbaijani, Crimean Tatar, and Gagauz alphabets are based on the Turkish alphabet and its same diacriticized letters, with some additions.

:* Turkmen includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters Ç, Ö, Ş and Ü. In addition, Turkmen uses A with diaeresis (_Ä_) to represent , N with caron (_Ň_) to represent the velar nasal , Y with acute (_Ý_) to represent the palatal approximant , and Z with caron (_Ž_) to represent .

Other

:* Albanian has two special letters Ç and Ё upper and lowercase. They are placed next to the most similar letters in the alphabet, c and e correspondingly.

:* Esperanto has the symbols _ŭ_, _ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ_ and _ŝ_, which are included in the alphabet, and considered separate letters.

:* Hawaiian uses the kahakô (macron) over vowels, although there is some disagreement over considering them as individual letters. The kahakô over a vowel can completely change the meaning of a word that is spelled the same but without the kahakô.

:* Kurdish uses the symbols Ç, Ê, Î, Ş and Û with other 26 standard Latin alphabet symbols.

:* Lakota alphabet uses the caron for the letters _č_, _ȟ_, _ǧ_, _š_, and _ž_. It also uses the acute accent for stressed vowels á, é, í, ó, ú, áŋ, íŋ, úŋ.

:* Classical Malay uses some diacritics such as _â, ă, é, ḥ, ñ, ô, š, û_. Uses of diacritics was continued until end of 19th century.

:* Maltese uses a C, G, and Z with a dot over them (Ċ, Ġ, Ż), and also has an H with an extra horizontal bar. For uppercase H, the extra bar is written slightly above the usual bar. For lowercase H, the extra bar is written crossing the vertical, like a _t_, and not touching the lower part (Ħ, ħ). The above characters are considered separate letters. The letter 'c' without a dot has fallen out of use due to redundancy. 'Ċ' is pronounced like the English 'ch' and 'k' is used as a hard c as in 'cat'. 'Ż' is pronounced just like the English 'Z' as in 'Zebra', while 'Z' is used to make the sound of 'ts' in English (like 'tsunami' or 'maths'). 'Ġ' is used as a soft 'G' like in 'geometry', while the 'G' sounds like a hard 'G' like in 'log'. The digraph 'għ' (called _għajn_ after the Arabic letter name _ʻayn_ for غ) is considered separate, and sometimes ordered after 'g', whilst in other volumes it is placed between 'n' and 'o' (the Latin letter 'o' originally evolved from the shape of Phoenician _ʻayin_, which was traditionally collated after Phoenician _nūn_).

Diacritics that do not produce new letters

English

English is one of the few European languages that does not have many words that contain diacritical marks. Instead, digraphs are the main way the Modern English alphabet adapts the Latin to its phonemes. Exceptions are unassimilated foreign loanwords, including borrowings from French and, increasingly, Spanish; however, the diacritic is also sometimes omitted from such words. Loanwords that frequently appear with the diacritic in English include _café_, _résumé_ or _resumé_ (a usage that helps distinguish it from the verb _resume_), _soufflé_, and _naïveté_ (see _English terms with diacritical marks_). In older practice (and even among some orthographically conservative modern writers) one may see examples such as _élite_, _mêlée_ and _rôle._

English speakers and writers once used the diaeresis more often than now in words such as _coöperation_ (from Fr. _coopération_), _zoölogy_ (from Grk. _zoologia_), and _seeër_ (now more commonly ''see-er _or simply_ seer'') as a way of indicating that adjacent vowels belonged to separate syllables, but this practice has become far less common. _The New Yorker_ magazine is a major publication that continues to use the diaresis in place of a dash for clarity and economy of space.[11]

A few English words, out of context, can only be distinguished from others by a diacritic or modified letter, including exposé, lamé, maté, öre, øre, pâté, and rosé'. The same is true of _résumé,_ alternately __ but nevertheless it is regularly spelled _resume_. In a few words, diacritics that did not exist in the original have been added for disambiguation, as in maté (from Sp. and Port. _mate_), saké (the standard Romanization of the Japanese has no accent mark), and Malé (from Dhivehi މާލެ), to clearly distinguish them from the English words "mate", "sake", and "male".

The acute and grave accents are occasionally used in poetry and lyrics: the acute to indicate stress overtly where it might be ambiguous (_rébel_ vs. _rebél_) or nonstandard for metrical reasons (_caléndar_), the grave to indicate that an ordinarily silent or elided syllable is pronounced (_warnèd,_ _parlìament_).

In certain personal names such as _Renée_ and _Zoë_, often two spellings exist, and the preference will be known only to those close to the person themselves. Even when the name of a person is spelled with a diacritic, like Charlotte Brontë, this may be dropped in English language articles and even official documents such as passports either due to carelessness, the typist not knowing how to enter letters with diacritical marks, or for technical reasons - California, for example, does not allow names with diacritics as the computer system cannot process such characters. They also appear in some worldwide company names and/or trademarks such as Nestlé or Citroën.

Other languages

The following languages have letter-diacritic combinations that are not considered independent letters.

-   Afrikaans uses a diaeresis to mark vowels that are pronounced separately and not as one would expect where they occur together, for example _voel_ (to feel) as opposed to _voël_ (bird). The circumflex is used in _ê, î, ô_ and _û_ generally to indicate long close-mid, as opposed to open-mid vowels, for example in the words _wêreld_ (world) and _môre_ (morning, tomorrow). The acute accent is used to add emphasis in the same way as underlining or writing in bold or italics in English, for example _Dit is jóú boek_ (It is YOUR book). The grave accent is used to distinguish between words that are different only in placement of the stress, for example _appel_ (apple) and _appèl_ (appeal) and in a few cases where it makes no difference to the pronunciation but distinguishes between homophones. The two most usual cases of the latter are the in the sayings _òf... òf_ (either... or) and _nòg... nòg_ (neither... nor) to distinguish them from _of_ (or) and _nog_ (again, still).
-   Aymara uses a diacritical horn over _p, q, t, k, ch_.
-   Catalan has the following composite characters: _à, ç, é, è, í, ï, ó, ò, ú, ü, l·l_. The acute and the grave indicate stress and vowel height, the cedilla marks the result of a historical palatalization, the diaeresis indicates either a hiatus, or that the letter _u_ is pronounced when the graphemes _gü, qü_ are followed by _e_ or _i_, the interpunct (·) distinguishes the different values of _ll/l·l_.
-   Some orthographies of Cornish such as Kernowek Standard and Unified Cornish use diacritics, while others such as Kernewek Kemmyn and the Standard Written Form do not (or only use them optionally in teaching materials).
-   Dutch uses the diaeresis. For example, in _ruïne_ it means that the _u_ and the _i_ are separately pronounced in their usual way, and not in the way that the combination _ui_ is normally pronounced. Thus it works as a separation sign and not as an indication for an alternative version of the _i_. Diacritics can be used for emphasis (_érg koud_ for _very_ cold) or for disambiguation between a number of words that are spelled the same when context doesn't indicate the correct meaning (_één appel_ = one apple, _een appel_ = an apple; _vóórkomen_ = to occur, _voorkómen_ = to prevent). Grave and acute accents are used on a very small number of words, mostly loanwords. The ç also appears in some loanwords.[12]
-   Faroese. Non-Faroese accented letters are not added to the Faroese alphabet. These include _é_, _ö_, _ü_, _å_ and recently also letters like _š_, _ł_, and _ć_.
-   Filipino has the following composite characters: _á, à, â, é, è, ê, í, ì, î, ó, ò, ô, ú, ù, û_. The actual use of diacritics for Filipino is, however, uncommon, meant only to distinguish between homonyms with different stresses and meanings that either occur near each other in a text or to aid the reader in ascertaining its otherwise ambiguous meaning. The letter eñe is due to the Spanish alphabet and too, is considered a separate letter. The diacritics appears in Spanish loanwords and names if Spanish orthography is observed.
-   Finnish. Carons in _š_ and _ž_ appear only in foreign proper names and loanwords, but may be substituted with _sh_ or _zh_ if and only if it is technically impossible to produce accented letters in the medium. Contrary to Estonian, _š_ and _ž_ are not considered distinct letters in Finnish.
-   French uses five diacritics. The grave (_accent grave_) marks the sound /ɛ/ when over an e, as in _père_ ("father") or is used to distinguish words that are otherwise homographs such as _a_/_à_ ("has"/"to") or _ou_/_où_ ("or"/"where"). The acute (_accent aigu_) is only used in "é", modifying the "e" to make the sound /e/, as in _étoile_ ("star"). The circumflex (_accent circonflexe_) generally denotes that an S once followed the vowel in Old French or Latin, as in _fête_ ("party"), the Old French being _feste_ and the Latin being _festum_. Whether the circumflex modifies the vowel's pronunciation depends on the dialect and the vowel. The cedilla (_cédille_) indicates that a normally hard "c" (before the vowels "a", "o", and "u") is to be pronounced /s/, as in _ça_ ("that"). The diaeresis (_tréma_) indicates that two adjacent vowels that would normally be pronounced as one are to be pronounced separately, as in _Noël_ ("Christmas").
-   Galician vowels can bear an acute (_á, é, í, ó, ú_) to indicate stress or difference between two otherwise same written words (_é_, 'is' vs. _e_, 'and'), but the diaeresis (_trema_) is only used with _ï_ and _ü_ to show two separate vowel sounds in pronunciation. Only in foreign words may Galician use other diacritics such as _ç_ (common during the Middle Ages), _ê_, or _à_.
-   German uses the three umlauted characters _ä_, _ö_ and _ü_. These diacritics indicate vowel changes. For instance, the word _Ofen_ "oven" has the plural _Öfen_ . The mark originated as a superscript _e_; a handwritten blackletter _e_ resembles two parallel vertical lines, like a diaeresis. Due to this history, "ä", "ö" and "ü" can be written as "ae", "oe" and "ue" respectively, if the umlaut letters are not available.
-   Hebrew has many various diacritic marks known as _niqqud_ that are used above and below script to represent vowels. These must be distinguished from cantillation, which are keys to pronunciation and syntax.
-   The International Phonetic Alphabet uses diacritic symbols and characters to indicate phonetic features or secondary articulations.
-   Irish uses the acute to indicate that a vowel is long: _á_, _é_, _í_, _ó_, _ú_. It is known as _síneadh fada_ "long sign" or simply _fada_ "long" in Irish. In the older Gaelic type, overdots are used to indicate lenition of a consonant: _ḃ_, _ċ_, _ḋ_, _ḟ_, _ġ_, _ṁ_, _ṗ_, _ṡ_, _ṫ_.
-   Italian mainly has the acute and the grave (_à_, _è_/_é_, _ì_, _ò_/_ó_, _ù_), typically to indicate a stressed syllable that would not be stressed under the normal rules of pronunciation but sometimes also to distinguish between words that are otherwise spelled the same way (e.g. "e", and; "è", is). Despite its rare use, Italian orthography allows the circumflex (î) too, in two cases: it can be found in old literary context (roughly up to 19th century) to signal a syncope (fêro→fecero, they did), or in modern Italian to signal the contraction of ″-ii″ due to the plural ending -i whereas the root ends with another -i; e.g., s. demonio, p. demonii→demonî; in this case the circumflex also signals that the word intended is not demoni, plural of "demone" by shifting the accent (demònî, "devils"; dèmoni, "demons").
-   Lithuanian uses the acute, grave and tilde in dictionaries to indicate stress types in the language's pitch accent system.
-   Maltese also uses the grave on its vowels to indicate stress at the end of a word with two syllables or more: lowercase letters - à, è, ì, ò, ù | capital letters - À, È, Ì, Ò, Ù
-   Maori makes use of macrons to mark long vowels.
-   Occitan has the following composite characters: _á, à, ç, é, è, í, ï, ó, ò, ú, ü, n·h, s·h_. The acute and the grave indicate stress and vowel height, the cedilla marks the result of a historical palatalization, the diaeresis indicates either a hiatus, or that the letter _u_ is pronounced when the graphemes _gü, qü_ are followed by _e_ or _i_, and the interpunct (·) distinguishes the different values of _nh/n·h_ and _sh/s·h_ (i.e., that the letters are supposed to be pronounced separately, not combined into "ny" and "sh").
-   Portuguese has the following composite characters: _à, á, â, ã, ç, é, ê, í, ó, ô, õ, ú_. The acute and the circumflex indicate stress and vowel height, the grave indicates crasis, the tilde represents nasalization, and the cedilla marks the result of a historical lenition.
-   Acutes are also used in Slavic language dictionaries and textbooks to indicate lexical stress, placed over the vowel of the stressed syllable. This can also serve to disambiguate meaning (e.g., in Russian писа́ть (_pisáť_) means "to write", but пи́сать (_písať_) means "to piss"), or "бо́льшая часть" (the biggest part) vs "больша́я часть" (the big part).
-   Spanish uses the acute and the diaeresis. The acute is used on a vowel in a stressed syllable in words with irregular stress patterns. It can also be used to "break up" a diphthong as in _tío_ (pronounced , rather than as it would be without the accent). Moreover, the acute can be used to distinguish words that otherwise are spelled alike, such as _si_ ("if") and _sí_ ("yes"), and also to distinguish interrogative and exclamatory pronouns from homophones with a different grammatical function, such as _donde/¿dónde?_ ("where"/"where?") or _como/¿cómo?_ ("as"/"how?"). The acute may also used be used to avoid typographical ambiguity, as in _1 ó 2_ ("1 or 2"; without the acute this might be interpreted as "1 0 2". The diaeresis is used only over _u_ (_ü_) for it to be pronounced in the combinations _gue_ and _gui,_ where _u_ is normally silent, for example _ambigüedad._ In poetry, the diaeresis may be used on _i_ and _u_ as a way to force a hiatus. As foreshadowed above, in nasal _ñ_ the tilde (squiggle) is not considered a diacritic sign at all, but a composite part of a distinct glyph, with its own chapter in the dictionary: a glyph that denotes the 15th letter of the Spanish alphabet.
-   Swedish uses the acute to show non-standard stress, for example in (café) and (résumé). This occasionally helps resolve ambiguities, such as _ide_ (hibernation) versus _idé_ (idea). In these words, the acute is not optional. Some proper names use non-standard diacritics, such as Carolina Klüft and Staël von Holstein. For foreign loanwords the original accents are strongly recommended, unless the word has been infused into the language, in which case they are optional. Hence _crème fraîche_ but _ampere_. Swedish also has the letters _å_, _ä_, and _ö_, but these are considered distinct letters, not _a_ and _o_ with diacritics.
-   Tamil does not have any diacritics in itself, but uses the Arabic numerals 2, 3 and 4 as diacritics to represent aspirated, voiced, and voiced-aspirated consonants when Tamil script is used to write long passages in Sanskrit.
-   Thai has its own system of diacritics derived from Indian numerals, which denote different tones.
-   Vietnamese uses the acute (_dấu sắc_), the grave (_dấu huyền_), the tilde (_dấu ngã_), the underdot (_dấu nặng_) and the hoi (_dấu hỏi_) on vowels as tone indicators.
-   Welsh uses the circumflex, diaeresis, acute, and grave on its seven vowels _a, e, i, o, u, w, y_. The most common is the circumflex (which it calls _to bach_, meaning "little roof", or _acen grom_ "crooked accent", or _hirnod_ "long sign") to denote a long vowel, usually to disambiguate it from a similar word with a short vowel. The rarer grave accent has the opposite effect, shortening vowel sounds that would usually be pronounced long. The acute accent and diaeresis are also occasionally used, to denote stress and vowel separation respectively. The _w_-circumflex and the _y_-circumflex are among the most commonly accented characters in Welsh, but unusual in languages generally, and were until recently very hard to obtain in word-processed and HTML documents.


Transliteration

Several languages that are not written with the Roman alphabet are transliterated, or romanized, using diacritics. Examples:

-   Arabic has several romanisations, depending on the type of the application, region, intended audience, country, etc. many of them extensively use diacritics, e.g., some methods use an underdot for rendering emphatic consonants (ṣ, ṭ, ḍ, ẓ, ḥ). The macron is often used to render long vowels. š is often used for , ġ for .
-   Chinese has several romanizations that use the umlaut, but only on _u_ (_ü_). In Hanyu Pinyin, the four tones of Mandarin Chinese are denoted by the macron (first tone), acute (second tone), caron (third tone) and grave (fourth tone) diacritics. Example: _ā, á, ǎ, à_.
-   Romanized Japanese (Rōmaji) occasionally uses macrons to mark long vowels. The Hepburn romanization system uses macrons to mark long vowels, and the Kunrei-shiki and Nihon-shiki systems use a circumflex.
-   Sanskrit, as well as many of its descendants, like Hindi and Bengali, uses a lossless romanization system. This includes several letters with diacritical markings, such as the macron (ā, ī, ū), over- and underdots (ṛ, ḥ, ṃ, ṇ, ṣ, ṭ, ḍ) as well as a few others (ś, ñ).


Limits

Practical

Possibly the greatest number of combining diacritics _required_ to compose a valid character in any Unicode language is 8, for the "well-known grapheme cluster in Tibetan and Ranjana scripts",ཧྐྵྨླྺྼྻྂ, or HAKṢHMALAWARAYAṀ.

It is U+0F67 U+0F90 U+0FB5 U+0FA8 U+0FB3 U+0FBA U+0FBC U+0FBB U+0F82, or:
TIBETAN LETTER HA + TIBETAN SUBJOINED LETTER KA + TIBETAN SUBJOINED LETTER SSA + TIBETAN SUBJOINED LETTER MA + TIBETAN SUBJOINED LETTER LA + TIBETAN SUBJOINED LETTER FIXED-FORM WA + TIBETAN SUBJOINED LETTER FIXED-FORM RA + TIBETAN SUBJOINED LETTER FIXED-FORM YA + TIBETAN SIGN NYI ZLA NAA DA.

Impractical

Some users have explored the limits of rendering in web browsers and other software by "decorating" words with multiple nonsensical diacritics per character. The result is called "Zalgo text". The composed bogus characters and words can be copied and pasted normally via the system clipboard.
