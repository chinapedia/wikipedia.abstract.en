_AQUILEGIA_ (common names: GRANNY'S BONNET[1], COLUMBINE) is a genus of about 60–70 species[2] of perennial plants that are found in meadows, woodlands, and at higher altitudes throughout the Northern Hemisphere, known for the spurred petals [3] of their flowers.


Etymology

The genus name _Aquilegia_ is derived from the Latin word for eagle (_aquila_), because of the shape of the flower petals, which are said to resemble an eagle's claw. The common name "columbine" comes from the Latin for "dove", due to the resemblance of the inverted flower to five doves clustered together.[4]


Description

The leaves of this plant are compound and the flowers contain five sepals, five petals and five pistils. The fruit is a follicle which holds many seeds and is formed at the end of the pistils. Underneath the flower are spurs which contain nectar, mainly consumed by long-beaked birds such as hummingbirds.[5]


Relatives

Columbines are closely related to plants in the genera _Actaea_ (baneberries) and _Aconitum_ (wolfsbanes/monkshoods), which like _Aquilegia_ produce cardiogenic toxins.[6]


Insects

They are used as food plants by some Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) caterpillars. These are mainly of noctuid moths – noted for feeding on many poisonous plants without harm – such as cabbage moth (_Mamestra brassicae_), dot moth (_Melanchra persicariae_) and mouse moth (_Amphipyra tragopoginis_). the engrailed (_Ectropis crepuscularia_), a geometer moth, also uses columbine as a larval food plant. The larvae of the _Papaipema leucostigma_ also feed on columbine.[7]

Plants in the genus _Aquilegia_ are a major food source for _Bombus hortorum_, a species of bumblebee. Specifically, they have been found to forage on species of _Aquilegia vulgaris_ in Belgium and _Aquilegia chrysantha_ in North America and Belgium. The bees do not show any preference in color of the flowers.[8]


Cultivation

'Magpie']]

Columbine is a hardy perennial, which propagates by seed. It will grow to a height of 15 to 20 inches. It will grow in full sun; however, it prefers growing in partial shade and well drained soil, and is able to tolerate average soils and dry soil conditions. Columbine is rated at hardiness zone 3 in the United States so does not require mulching or protection in the winter.[9][10]

Large numbers of hybrids are available for the garden, since the European _A. vulgaris_ was hybridized with other European and North American varieties. [11] _Aquilegia_ species are very interfertile, and will self-sow.[12] Some varieties are short-lived so are better treated as biennials. The following hybrid cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:

The British National Collection of _Aquilegia_s is held by Mrs Carrie Thomas at Killay near Swansea.[20]


Uses

_Aquilegia_ × _hybrida_]] The flowers of various species of columbine were consumed in moderation by Native Americans as a condiment with other fresh greens, and are reported to be very sweet, and safe if consumed in small quantities. The plant's seeds and roots are highly poisonous however, and contain cardiogenic toxins which cause both severe gastroenteritis and heart palpitations if consumed as food. Native Americans used very small amounts of _Aquilegia_ root as a treatment for ulcers. However, the medical use of this plant is better avoided due to its high toxicity; columbine poisonings may be fatal.[21]

An acute toxicity test in mice has demonstrated that ethanol extract mixed with isocytisoside, the main flavonoid compound from the leaves and stems of _Aquilegia vulgaris_, can be classified as non-toxic, since a dose of 3000 mg/kg did not cause mortality.


Culture

The Colorado blue columbine (_A. coerulea_) is the official state flower of Colorado (see also Columbine, Colorado).


Evolution

Columbines have been important in the study of evolution. It was found that the Sierra columbine (_A. pubescens_) and crimson columbine (_A. formosa_) each has adapted specifically to a pollinator. Bees and hummingbirds are the visitors to _A. formosa_, while hawkmoths would only visit _A. pubescens_ when given a choice. Such a "pollination syndrome", being due to flower color and orientation controlled by their genetics, ensures reproductive isolation and can be a cause of speciation.[22]

_Aquilegia_ petals show an enormous range of petal spur length diversity ranging from a centimeter to the 15 cm spurs of _Aquilegia longissima_. Selection from pollinator shifts is suggested to have driven these changes in nectar spur length.[23] It was shown that this spur length diversity is achieved solely through changing cell shape, not cell number or cell size. This suggests that a simple microscopic change can result in a dramatic evolutionarily relevant morphological change.[24]
