In the _Star Trek_ science fiction franchise, THE MAQUIS are a 24th-century paramilitary organization-terrorist group (like the World War II Maquis in the French Resistance and the Spanish Maquis that emerged in the Spanish Civil War) first introduced in the 1994 episode "The Maquis" of the television series _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, and subsequently appeared in _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ and _Star Trek: Voyager_. The Maquis story debuted when three _Star Trek_ television shows running from the late 1980s to 2001 took place in the same fictional science-fiction universe at the same time in the future (The 2360s-70s). As a result, the Maquis story was told across dozens of episodes with many more shows providing the context in the wider _Star Trek_ narrative.

The Maquis are also featured in the comic book saga _The Maquis: Soldier of Peace_ by Malibu Comics, who held the rights to _Deep Space Nine_ comics in the 1990s.[1][2] The Maquis are an important part of _Star Trek: Voyager_, as the formative plot for the series is that a Federation and a Maquis crew are stranded together on the opposite side of the Galaxy.[3] The Maquis are also in the book series _The Badlands_ by Susan Wright, who also has written many other non-canon trekiverse novels published by Pocket Books.


Concept

The concept of the Maquis was intentionally introduced by the creators of _Deep Space Nine_ so that it could play a role in the upcoming _Voyager_, which was scheduled to begin airing in 1995. As Jeri Taylor commented, "we knew that we wanted to include a renegade element in _Voyager_, and that the show would involve a ship housing both Starfleet people and those idealistic freedom fighters that the Federation felt were outlaws [i.e., the Maquis]."[4] Therefore, the creators of _Star Trek_ decided to create a backstory for the Maquis in several episodes of _Deep Space Nine_ and _The Next Generation_, and they named them after the French guerrilla fighters of the Second World War.[5] The recurring characters of Michael Eddington (played by Kenneth Marshall) in _Deep Space Nine_ and Ro Laren (played by Michelle Forbes) in _The Next Generation_ became members of the Maquis, and _Voyager_ contained three regular former Maquis characters: Chakotay (Robert Beltran), B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), and Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill); as well as recurring character Seska (Martha Hackett).

In, "Caretaker", the pilot episode of _Star Trek: Voyager_, the titular starship pursues a Maquis ship into the Badlands before being teleported to the Delta Quadrant.[6]

  : Fictional Chronology

According to the fictional storyline of the _Star Trek_ universe, the Maquis were formed in the 24th century after a peace treaty was enacted between the United Federation of Planets and the Cardassian Union, redesignating the demilitarized zone between the two powers, which resulted in the Federation ceding several of their colony worlds to the Cardassians. Although the colonists were offered free relocation to elsewhere in Federation territory, some insisted on remaining on the ceded worlds, effectively becoming Cardassian Union citizens. Some of these colonists subsequently formed the Maquis to protect themselves from Cardassian aggression, although they received no official support from the Federation, who feared breaking the peace treaty with the Cardassians, which would lead to war.

Nonetheless, various Federation members supported the Maquis' cause, and illegally helped to supply them with weapons and other technology that they could use in their struggle. In several cases, the Federation actually intervened in the war between the Maquis and the Cardassians, aiding the latter in recognition of the peace treaty. In one case, the Federation ship tracked a Maquis vessel to the Badlands with the intention of apprehending it, but an alien force transported both to the Delta Quadrant, on the opposite side of the Milky Way Galaxy. The two crews were forced to unite to survive against alien threats such as the Kazon and the Borg. In later years, when the Cardassians joined the Dominion to fight in the Dominion War against the Federation, the Dominion aided the Cardassian military in wiping out the Maquis, a prelude to their war against the Federation and its allies.

The Maquis provide moral challenges to existing characters such as Quark and Sisko on Deep Space Nine station.[7] Quark is lured into selling weapons to the Maquis by an attractive Vulcan woman, showing how his desire for money unwittingly turned him into an illegal arms dealer.[8] Sisko must navigate the internal politics of the Cardassians and Federation as he tries to uphold the peace treaty, in addition to being tested by his old friend trying to recruit him into the rebellion.[9]

Characters

Michelle_Forbes_2009a_Comic-Con.jpg Various members of the Maquis are characters in _TNG_, _DS9_, and _Voyager_, although membership is sometimes transitory and as revealed by the Maquis saga, for example some are revealed as Federation agents. The reveal of a character's identity is common plot device throughout the storyline. Many episodes play on these questions

Examples:

-   B'Elanna Torres (played by Roxann Dawson)
-   Chakotay, commands Maquis space vessel.[13] (played by Robert Beltran)
-   Calvin Hudson (Maquis leader) (played by Bernie Casey (b.1934-2017))
-   Macias (Maquis leader) (played by John Franklyn-Robbins (b.1924-d.2009))
-   Michael Eddington (played by Kenneth Marshall[14]

-   Ro Laren (played primarily by Michelle Forbes)[15]

-   Teero (played by Keith Szarabajka)
-   Tuvok (Federation agent and _Voyager_ bridge officer) (played by Tim Russ)
-   Thomas Riker (played by Jonathan Frakes)
-   Sakonna[16] (played by Bertila Damas)
-   Santos (played by William Thomas Jr.)
-   Seska (played by Martha Hackett)[17]


Fictional spacecraft

In the _Star Trek_ science fiction franchise, _The Maquis_ are known to use a diverse mix of older spacecraft from the United Federation of Planets (aka 'The Federation').[18] Three aspects are that the spacecraft are older, as much as several decades, there are a variety of types in service, and finally, they tend to be of Federation design.[19] Although the spacecraft are old, The Maquis are known to upgrade them with advanced weaponry to take on larger Cardassian vessels such as the _Galor_ class.[20]

-   Maquis ship in Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)[21]
-   Maquis raider as seen on _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ episode _The Maquis, Part II_[22]
-   Dreadnought, former Cardassian weapon commandeered by the Maquis (Dreadnought (Star Trek: Voyager))
-   Maquis Interceptor/Maquified Peregrine-class[23]

The Maquis Fighter seen in the DS9 episodes (The Maquis I & II) was designed by Jim Martin and the model for the special effect shots was built by Tony Meinenger.[24] The fighter/transport used by Ro was also designed by Jim Martin, but that model was built by Greg Jein.[25]
