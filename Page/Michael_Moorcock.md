MICHAEL JOHN MOORCOCK (born 18 December 1939) is an English writer and musician, primarily of science fiction and fantasy, who has also published literary novels. He is best known for his novels about the character Elric of Melniboné, a seminal influence on the field of fantasy since the 1960s and ‘70s.

As editor of the British science fiction magazine _New Worlds_, from May 1964 until March 1971 and then again from 1976 to 1996, Moorcock fostered the development of the science fiction "New Wave" in the UK and indirectly in the United States. His publication of _Bug Jack Barron_ (1969) by Norman Spinrad as a serial novel was notorious; in Parliament some British MPs condemned the Arts Council for funding the magazine.[1] He is also a successful recording musician, contributing to the band Hawkwind, Blue Öyster Cult and his own project.

In 2008, _The Times_ newspaper named Moorcock in its list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945".[2]


Biography

Michael Moorcock was born in London in December 1939,[3] and the landscape of London, particularly the area of Notting Hill Gate[4] and Ladbroke Grove, is an important influence in some of his fiction (cf. the Cornelius novels).[5]

Moorcock has mentioned _The Mastermind of Mars_ by Edgar Rice Burroughs, _The Apple Cart_ by George Bernard Shaw and _The Constable of St. Nicholas_ by Edwin Lester Arnold as the first three non-juvenile books that he read before beginning primary school.[6] The first book he bought was a secondhand copy of _The Pilgrim's Progress_.[7]

Moorcock is the former husband of Hilary Bailey by whom he had three children: Sophie b.1963, Katherine b.1964, and Max b. 1972.[8] He is also the former husband of Jill Riches, who later married Robert Calvert. She illustrated some of Moorcock's books, including covers, including the _Gloriana_ dustjacket.[9] In 1983, Linda Steele became Moorcock's third wife.[10][11][12]

He was an original member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America (SAGA), a loose-knit group of eight heroic fantasy authors founded in the 1960s and led by Lin Carter, self-selected by fantasy credentials alone.

Moorcock is the subject of four book-length works, a monograph and an interview, by Colin Greenland. In 1983, Greenland published _The Entropy Exhibition: Michael Moorcock and the British 'New Wave' in Science Fiction_. He followed this with _Michael Moorcock: Death is No Obstacle_, a book-length interview about technique, in 1992. 'Michael Moorcock: Law of Chaos' by Jeff Gardiner and 'Michael Moorcock: Fiction, Fantasy and the World's Pain' by Mark Scroggins were published more recently.

In the 1990s, Moorcock moved to Texas in the United States.[13] His wife Linda is American.[14] He spends half of the year in Texas, the other half in Paris.[15][16]


Views on politics

Moorcock's works are noted for their political nature and content. In one interview, he states, "I am an anarchist and a pragmatist. My moral/philosophical position is that of an anarchist."[17] Further, in describing how his writing relates to his political philosophy, Moorcock says, "My books frequently deal with aristocratic heroes, gods and so forth. All of them end on a note which often states quite directly that one should serve neither gods nor masters but become one's own master."[18]

Besides using fiction to explore his politics,[19] Moorcock also engages in political activism. In order to "marginalize stuff that works to objectify women and suggests women enjoy being beaten", he has encouraged W H Smiths to move John Norman's _Gor_ series novels to the top shelf.[20]


Writer

Fiction

Moorcock began writing whilst he was still at school, contributing to a magazine he entitled _Outlaw's Own_ from 1950 on.[21]

In 1957 at the age of 17, Moorcock became editor of _Tarzan Adventures_ (a national juvenile weekly featuring text and Tarzan comic strip) where he published at least a dozen of his own Sojan the Swordsman stories during that year and the next.[22] At age 18 (in 1958), he wrote the allegorical fantasy novel _The Golden Barge_. This remained unpublished until 1980, when it was issued by Savoy Books with an introduction by M. John Harrison. At 19 years of age[23] he also edited _Sexton Blake Library_ (serial pulp fiction featuring Sexton Blake, the poor man's Sherlock Holmes)[24] and returned to late Victorian London for some of his books. Writing ever since, he has produced a huge volume of work. His first story in _New Worlds_ was "Going Home" (1958; with Barrington J. Bayley). "The Sundered Worlds", a 57-page novella published in the November 1962 number of _Science Fiction Adventures_ edited by John Carnell, became, with its sequel "The Blood Red Game" from the same magazine, the basis for his 190-page paperback debut novel three years later, _The Sundered Worlds_ (Compact Books, 1965; in the U.S., Paperback Library, 1966).[25]

Moorcock replaced Carnell as _New Worlds_ editor from the May–June 1964 number.[26] Under his leadership the magazine became central to "New Wave" science fiction. This movement promoted literary style and an existential view of technological change, in contrast to "hard science fiction",[27] which extrapolated on technological change itself. Some "New Wave" stories were not recognisable as traditional science fiction, and _New Worlds_ remained controversial for as long as Moorcock edited it.

During that time, he occasionally wrote as "JAMES COLVIN", a "house pseudonym" that was also used by other _New Worlds_ critics. A spoof obituary of Colvin appeared in _New Worlds_ #197 (January 1970), written by Charles Platt as "William Barclay". Moorcock makes much use of the initials "JC"; these are also the initials of Jesus Christ, the subject of his 1967 Nebula award-winning novella _Behold the Man_, which tells the story of Karl Glogauer, a time-traveller who takes on the role of Christ. They are also the initials of various "Eternal Champion" Moorcock characters such as Jerry Cornelius, Jerry Cornell and Jherek Carnelian. In more recent years, Moorcock has taken to using "WARWICK COLVIN, JR." as a pseudonym, particularly in his "Second Ether" fiction.

Moorcock talks about much of his writing in _Death Is No Obstacle_ by Colin Greenland, which is a book-length transcription of interviews with Moorcock about the structures in his writing.

Moorcock has also published pastiches of writers for whom he felt affection as a boy, including Edgar Rice Burroughs, Leigh Brackett, and Robert E. Howard. All his fantasy adventures have elements of satire and parody, while respecting what he considers the essentials of the form. Although his heroic fantasies have been his most consistently reprinted books in the United States, he achieved prominence in the UK as a literary author, with the _Guardian_ Fiction Prize in 1977 for _The Condition of Muzak_, and with _Mother London_ later shortlisted for the Whitbread Prize.[28]

Novels and series such as the _Cornelius Quartet_, _Mother London_, _King of the City_, the _Pyat Quartet_ and the short story collection _London Bone_ have established him in the eyes of critics such as Iain Sinclair, Peter Ackroyd and Allan Massie in publications including _The Times Literary Supplement_ and the _London Review of Books_ as a major contemporary literary novelist. In 2008 Moorcock was named by a critics' panel in _The Times_ as one of the fifty best British novelists since 1945.[29] Virtually all of his stories are part of his overarching "Eternal Champion" theme or _oeuvre_, with characters (including Elric) moving from one storyline and fictional universe to another, all of them interconnected (though often only in dreams or visions).

Most of Moorcock's earlier work consisted of short stories and relatively brief novels: he has mentioned that "I could write 15,000 words a day and gave myself three days a volume. That's how, for instance, the Hawkmoon books were written."[30] Over the period of the _New Worlds_ editorship and his publishing of the original fantasy novels Moorcock has maintained an interest in the craft of writing and a continuing interest in the semi-journalistic craft of "pulp" authorship. This is reflected in his development of interlocking cycles which hark back to the origins of fantasy in myth and medieval cycles (see "Wizardry and Wild Romance – Moorcock" and "Death Is No Obstacle – Colin Greenland" for more commentary). This also provides an implicit link with the episodic origins of literature in newspaper/magazine serials from Trollope and Dickens onwards. None of this should be surprising given Moorcock's background in magazine publishing.

Since the 1980s, Moorcock has tended to write longer, more literary "mainstream" novels, such as _Mother London_ and _Byzantium Endures,_ but he continues to revisit characters from his earlier works, such as Elric, with books such as _The Dreamthief's Daughter_ or _The Skrayling Tree._ With the publication of the third and last book in this series, _The White Wolf's Son_, he announced that he was "retiring" from writing heroic fantasy fiction, though he continues to write Elric's adventures as graphic novels with his long-time collaborators Walter Simonson and the late James Cawthorn (1929–2008). Together, they produced the graphic novel, _Elric: the Making of a Sorcerer_, published by DC Comics in 2007. He has also completed his _Colonel Pyat_ sequence, dealing with the Nazi Holocaust, which began in 1981 with _Byzantium Endures_, continued through _The Laughter of Carthage_ (1984) and _Jerusalem Commands_ (1992), and now culminates with _The Vengeance of Rome_ (2006).

Among other works by Moorcock are _The Dancers at the End of Time_, set on Earth millions of years in the future, _Gloriana, or The Unfulfill'd Queen,_ set in an alternative Earth history and the 'Second Ether' sequence beginning with 'BLOOD'.

Moorcock is prone to revising his existing work, with the result that different editions of a given book may contain significant variations. The changes range from simple retitlings (_e.g._, the Elric story _The Flame Bringers_ became _The Caravan of Forgotten Dreams_ in the 1990s Gollancz/White Wolf omnibus editions) to character name changes (_e.g._, detective "Minos Aquilinas" becoming first "Minos von Bek" and later "Sam Begg" in three different versions of the short story "The Pleasure Garden of Felipe Sagittarius"),[31] major textual alterations (for example, the addition of several new chapters to _The Steel Tsar_ in the omnibus editions), and even complete restructurings (_e.g._, the 1966 novella _Behold the Man_ being expanded to novel-length from the original version that appeared in _New Worlds_ for republication as a book in 1969 by Allison and Busby).

A new, final revision of almost his entire oeuvre, with the exception of his literary novels _Mother London_, _King of the City_ and the Pyat quartet, is currently being issued by Victor Gollancz and many of his titles are being reprinted in the United States and France. Many comics based on his work are being reprinted by Titan Books under the general title The Michael Moorcock Library while in France a new adaptation of the Elric series has been translated into many languages, including English.

Elric of Melniboné

Moorcock's best-selling works have been the "Elric of Melniboné" stories.[32] In these books, Elric is written as a deliberate reversal of what Moorcock saw as clichés commonly found in fantasy adventure novels inspired by the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, and a direct antithesis of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian.

Moorcock's work is complex and multilayered. Central to many of his fantasy novels is the concept of an "Eternal Champion", who has potentially multiple identities across multiple dimensions of reality and alternative universes.[33] This cosmology is called the "Multiverse" within his novels and independently mirrors the concept which arose in particle physics in the 1960s and is still a current theory in high energy physics. The Multiverse deals with various primal polarities such as good and evil, law and chaos,[34] and order and entropy.

The success of Elric has overshadowed his many other works, though he has worked a number of the themes of the Elric stories into his other works (the "Hawkmoon" and "Corum" novels, for example) and Elric appears in the Jerry Cornelius and Dancers at the End of Time cycles. His Eternal Champion sequence has been collected in two different editions of omnibus volumes totalling 16 books (the U.S. edition was 15 volumes, while the British edition was 14 volumes, but due to various rights issues, the U.S. edition contained two volumes that were not included in the British edition, and the British edition likewise contained one volume that was not included in the U.S. edition) containing several books per volume, by Victor Gollancz in the UK and by White Wolf Publishing in the US. There have been several uncompleted attempts to make an Elric film. Currently The Mythology Company have a film project in hand with a script by Glen Mazzara. Hawkmoon is currently in development by the BBC.

Jerry Cornelius

Another of Moorcock's creations is Jerry Cornelius, a kind of hip urban adventurer of ambiguous gender; the same characters featured in each of several Cornelius books. These books were most obviously satirical of modern times, including the Vietnam War, and continue to feature as another variation of the Multiverse theme.[35] The first Jerry Cornelius book, _The Final Programme_ (1968), was made into a feature film in 1973.[36] Its story line is essentially identical to two of the Elric stories: _The Dreaming City_ and _The Dead Gods' Book._ Since 1998, Moorcock has returned to Cornelius in a series of new stories: _The Spencer Inheritance_, _The Camus Connection_, _Cheering for the Rockets_, and _Firing the Cathedral_, which was concerned with 9/11. All four novellas were included in the 2003 edition of _The Lives and Times of Jerry Cornelius_. Moorcock's most recent Cornelius stories, "Modem Times", appeared in _The Solaris Book of New Science Fiction: Volume 2_, published in 2008, this was expanded in 2011 as "Modem Times 2.0". Additionally, a version of Cornelius also appeared in Moorcock's 2010 _Doctor Who_ novel _The Coming of the Terraphiles_. _Pegging the President_ (PS. 2018), _The Fracking Factory_ (on FB, 2018) are two recent novellas and further stories are forthcoming.

Since the 1990s he has worked on novels containing autobiography and fake autobiography mixed with fantasy and parody beginning with "Blood" and "The War Amongst the Angels". His most recent sequence began with "The Whispering Swarm", published to critical success in 2015. "The Woods of Arcady" is forthcoming. With "Kaboul" (Denoel 2018) he continued to publish original work in France.

Views on fiction writing

Moorcock is a fervent supporter of the works of Mervyn Peake.[37]

He cites Fritz Leiber, an important sword and sorcery pioneer, as an author who writes fantasy that is not escapist and contains meaningful themes. These views can be found in his study of epic fantasy, _Wizardry and Wild Romance_ (Gollancz, 1987) which was revised and reissued by MonkeyBrain Books in 2004—its first U.S. edition catalogued by ISFDB.[38]

Moorcock is somewhat dismissive of the works of J. R. R. Tolkien. He met both Tolkien and C. S. Lewis in his teens, and claims to have liked them personally even though he does not admire them on artistic grounds. Moorcock criticised works such as _The Lord of the Rings_ for their "Merry England" point of view, famously equating Tolkien's novel to _Winnie-the-Pooh_ in his essay _Epic Pooh_.[39] Even so, James Cawthorn and Moorcock included _The Lord of the Rings_ in _Fantasy: The 100 Best Books_ (Carroll & Graf, 1988), and their review is not dismissive.

Moorcock has also criticized writers for their political agendas. He included Robert A. Heinlein and H. P. Lovecraft among this group in a 1978 essay, "Starship Stormtroopers" (_Anarchist Review_). There he criticised the production of "authoritarian" fiction by certain canonical writers, and Lovecraft for having antisemitic, misogynistic and extremely racist viewpoints that he weaved into his short stories.[40]

Sharing fictional universes with others

Moorcock has allowed a number of other writers to create stories in his fictional Jerry Cornelius universe. Brian Aldiss, M. John Harrison, Norman Spinrad, James Sallis, and Steve Aylett, among others, have written such stories. Many others have appeared on a Moorcock Facebook page. In an interview published in _The Internet Review of Science Fiction,_ Moorcock explains the reason for sharing his character:

Two short stories by Keith Roberts, "Coranda" and "The Wreck of the Kissing Bitch", are set in the frozen Matto Grosso plateau of Moorcock's 1969 novel, _The Ice Schooner_.

Elric of Melnibone and Moonglum appear in Karl Edward Wagner's story "The Gothic Touch", where they meet with Kane, who borrows Elric for his ability to deal with demons.

He is a friend and fan of comic book writer Alan Moore, and allowed Moore the use of his own character, Michael Kane of Old Mars, mentioned in Moore's _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II_. The two men appeared on stage at the Vanbrugh Theatre in London in January 2006 where they discussed Moorcock's work. The Green City from _Warriors of Mars_ was also referenced in Larry Niven's _Rainbow Mars_. Moorcock's character Jerry Cornelius appeared in Moore's _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century_.

Cornelius also appeared in French artist Mœbius' comic series _Le Garage Hermétique_.

In 1995-96, Moorcock wrote a script for a computer game/film/novel by Origin Systems.[41] When Electronic Arts bought Origins, the game was cancelled, but Moorcock's 40,000 word treatment was fleshed out by Storm Constantine, resulting in the novel, _Silverheart_. The story is set in Karadur-Shriltasi, a city at the heart of the Multiverse. A second novel, _Dragonskin_, was described as being in preparation, with Constantine as the main writer, but has not yet been delivered. Moorcock abandoned a memoir about his friends Mervyn Peake and Maeve Gilmore because he felt it was too personal.

He wrote prose and verse for _The Sunday Books_ first publication in French to accompany a set of unpublished Peake drawings. His book _The Metatemporal Detective_ was published in 2007. His most recent book to be published first in French is _Kaboul_, in 2018.

In November 2009, Moorcock announced[42] that he would be writing a _Doctor Who_ novel for BBC Books in 2010, making it one of the few occasions when he has written stories set in other people's "shared universes".[43] The novel, _The Coming of the Terraphiles_, was released in October 2010. The story merges Doctor Who with many of Moorcock's characters from the multiverse, notably Captain Cornelius and his pirates.[44] In 2016 he published the first novel in what he terms a literary experiment, blending memoir and fantasy, _The Whispering Swarm_. In 2018 he announced his completion of the second volume _The Woods of Arcady_. His Jerry Cornelius novella "Pegging the President" was launched at Shakespeare and Co, Paris, in 2018, where he discussed his work with Hari Kunzru and reaffirmed his commitment to literary experiment.

Moorcock is a member of the College of Pataphysicians.

Audiobooks

The first of an audiobook series of unabridged Elric novels, with new work read by Moorcock, have recently begun appearing from AudioRealms. The second audiobook in the series – _The Sailor on the Seas of Fate_ – was published in 2007. There have been audio-books of _Corum_ and others, several of which were unofficial and _A Winter Admiral_ and _Furniture_ are audio versions of short stories.


Music

Michael Moorcock & The Deep Fix

Moorcock has his own music project, which records under the name MICHAEL MOORCOCK & THE DEEP FIX. _The Deep Fix_ was the title story of an obscure collection of short stories by James Colvin (a pen name of Moorcock) that was published in the 1960s. The Deep Fix was also the fictional band fronted by Moorcock's character Jerry Cornelius.

The first album _New Worlds Fair_ was released in 1975. The album included Snowy White and a number of Hawkwind regulars in the credits. A second version of the _New Worlds_ album was issued in 2004 under the album name _Roller Coaster Holiday_. A non-album single, "Starcruiser" coupled with "Dodgem Dude", was belatedly issued in 1980.

The Deep Fix band gave a rare live performance at the Roundhouse, London on 18 June 1978 at _Nik Turner's Bohemian Love-In_, headlined by Turner's band Sphynx and also featuring Tanz Der Youth with Brian James (ex-The Damned), Lightning Raiders, Steve Took's Horns, Roger Ruskin and others.[45]

In 1982, as a trio with Pete Pavli and Drachen Theaker, some recordings were issued on _Hawkwind, Friends and Relations_ and a limited edition 7" single of "Brothel in Rosenstrasse" backed with "Time Centre".

In 2008, _The Entropy Tango & Gloriana Demo Sessions_ by Michael Moorcock & The Deep Fix was released. These were sessions for planned albums based on two of Moorcock's novels, _Gloriana, or The Unfulfill'd Queen_ and _The Entropy Tango_, which were never completed.

Working with Martin Stone, Moorcock began recording a new Deep Fix album in Paris, _Live From the Terminal Cafe_. Following Stone's death in 2016, Moorcock made plans to complete the album with producer Don Falcone. In 2019 Moorcock announced the completion of the album, due to appear in Fall 2019

with Hawkwind

Moorcock collaborated with the British rock band Hawkwind[46] on many occasions: the Hawkwind track "The Black Corridor", for example, included verbatim quotes from Moorcock's novel of the same name, and he worked with the band on their album ''Warrior on the Edge of Time, ''for which he earned a gold disc. Moorcock also wrote the lyrics to "Sonic Attack", a Sci-Fi satire of the public information broadcast, that was part of Hawkwind's _Space Ritual_ set. Hawkwind's album _The Chronicle of the Black Sword_ was largely based on the Elric novels. Moorcock appeared on stage with the band on many occasions, including the Black Sword tour. His contributions were removed from the original release of the _Live Chronicles_ album, recorded on this tour, for legal reasons, but have subsequently appeared on some double CD versions. He can also be seen performing on the DVD version of _Chronicle of the Black Sword_.

with Robert Calvert

Moorcock also collaborated with former Hawkwind frontman and resident poet, Robert Calvert (who gave the chilling declamation of "Sonic Attack"), on Calvert's albums _Lucky Leif and the Longships_ and _Hype_, playing guitar and banjo and singing background vocals.

with Blue Öyster Cult

Moorcock wrote the lyrics to three album tracks by the American band Blue Öyster Cult: "Black Blade", referring to the sword Stormbringer in the Elric books, "Veteran of the Psychic Wars", showing us Elric's emotions at a critical point of his story (this song may also refer to the "Warriors at the Edge of Time", which figure heavily in Moorcock's novels about John Daker; at one point his novel _The Dragon in the Sword_ they call themselves the "veterans of a thousand psychic wars"), and "The Great Sun Jester", about his friend, the poet Bill Butler, who died of a drug overdose. Moorcock has performed live with BÖC (in 1987 at the Atlanta, GA Dragon Con Convention).

with Spirits Burning

Moorcock contributed vocals and harmonica to the Spirits Burning & Michael Moorcock CD _An Alien Heat,_ released in 2018. Most of the lyrics were lifted from or based on text in his novel _An Alien Heat_. The album includes contributions from Albert Bouchard and other members of Blue Öyster Cult, as well as former members of Hawkwind. Moorcock also appeared on five tracks on the Spirits Burning CD _Alien Injection_, released in 2008. He is credited with singing lead vocals and playing guitar and mandolin. The performances used on the CD were from _The Entropy Tango & Gloriana Demo Sessions_.
