The HARRINGTON RESEARCH CENTRE is a government-run facility that is part of the AAFC umbrella of the agricultural sector. Located in Harrington, Prince Edward Island, the centre's resources are focused on the advancements of Canadian agriculture.[1]


Potato research

PEI has long been an area of Canada that is known for growing quality island-grown potatoes.[2] This has led to the potato industry investing in methods in which potatoes can grow better, and without disease. One disease in particular that was hampered the PEI potato producers in the past decade is the wire-worm. This spurred scientist Dr. Noronha to create a wireworm trap which severely deterred the pest from affecting nearby potato crops.[3]


Organic research

Acreage at the facility has been certified organic, becoming the only center in Canada to do so.[4] [5]


Location

The research farm is located north of Charlottetown on 1200 Brackley Point Road.
