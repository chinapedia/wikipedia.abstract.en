The GWANGJU STUDENTS MOVEMENT () is a movement that was started to fight against Japanese Imperialism. This began to take place starting on November 3, 1929. However, this wasn't the only movement of the time. There was a second movement which was led by a great amount of Gwangju Middle School students in May 20, 1943. The reason why these movements had originally sparked was because of a small incident where a Korean girl was being harassed at Naju (나주) Station on October 30 of that same year as the first movement. These movements were important because it gained Korea their freedom from the Japanese and thus receiving the independence that they fought for although there were many casualties and upsets.

Results of the movement

The independence movement that was executed by the 54 thousand high school students helped not only their own movement, but many other anti-Japanese movements. Many of those who participated in the movement against Japanese imperialism had to face sacrifices as well. Many of the protesters who stood up against the Japanese had died of torture, had died in jail, or died after being released due to illness from the harsh conditions of the jails. Also after being released from prisons, many of those were monitored by the Japanese so they would not have been able to live a good life anymore. However, after all of this was over, many good things did happen as well. Of course one of them was that the Japanese were pushed out of the country, but also a Student's day was established. This was a memorial day for all of those students who had participated in fighting against the Japanese imperialism.
