"PASADENA" is the debut single by Australian pop singer John Young, released in January 1972 and peaking at number 16 on the Australian Go-Set Chart.[1]

The single was released under the name John Young. Young's subsequent releases used "John Paul Young" to avoid confusion with Johnny Young (no relation), the 1960s pop star and _Young Talent Time_ (1971–1988 TV show) presenter.[2] Young performed the song on _Happening 70_ on Channel Ten.[3]

"Pasadena"was re-recorded in 1975 for Young's debut studio album _Hero_.
