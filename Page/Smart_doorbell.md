Ring_video_doorbell.jpg attached next to the front door of a house.]] A SMART DOORBELL is an internet-connected doorbell that notifies the smartphone or other electronic device of the home owner when a visitor arrives at the door. It activates when the visitor presses the button of the doorbell, or alternatively, when the doorbell senses a visitor with its built-in motion sensors. The smart doorbell lets the home owner use a smartphone app to watch and talk with the visitor by using the doorbell's built-in high-definition infrared camera and microphone.[1] Some smart doorbells also allow the user to open the door remotely using a smart lock.[2]


History

One of the earliest smart doorbells that entered to the market is the Ring Video Doorbell which was created by entrepreneur James Siminoff in 2012. Since then, several smart doorbells have been introduced to the market, some of them with additional, unique features.[3][4][5]


Privacy Issues

Alarming concerns regarding the security of the smart doorbells have been raised. Researchers at Pen Test Partners in the UK have analyzed the Ring smart doorbell and concluded that it's possible for an attacker to gain access to the homeownerâ€™s wireless network by unscrewing the Ring, pressing the setup button and accessing the configuration URL.[6] In another security issue that had been observed, a mix-up of two databases allowed some users of the Ring smart doorbell to view live footage from complete strangers' front porches.[7]
