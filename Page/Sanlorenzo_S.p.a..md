History

Foundation and development

The shipyard is established in 1958 under the name _Cantieri Navali San Lorenzo Spa_ by Gianfranco Cecchi and Giuliano Pecchia, in the town of Limite sull’Arno, Italy.

In 1975, Giovanni Jannetti acquires the company, relocating its headquarters to the coastal town of Viareggio. Under Jannetti's management, the shipyard gradually abandons the production of wooden vessels to focus on the development of fiberglass (GRP) yachts.

In 1985, Sanlorenzo's first GRP model, SL57, is launched. During the following decades, the company expands into the superyacht segment, producing its first long boat, SL100.[3]

In 1999, the shipyard relocates to its actual sites in the town of Ameglia, inside a natural reserve. The shipyard is certified UNI EN ISO 14001 to guarantee that its production process respects the environment.[4]

Under new management

In 2007, Massimo Perotti, former General Director of Azimut-Benetti through the financing of RL Investment Inc., acquires the majority of Cantieri Navali Sanlorenzo Spa by Giovanni Jannetti. The company is renamed Sanlorenzo S.p.a., and part of its production is again moved to Viareggio in 2007, where a new division for the production of larger superyachts is established in the same year.[5]

Under Perotti's management, the shipyard begins a period of rapid expansion, with its value of production raising from €40 mln. in 2004 to €320 mln. in 2017, investments growing from €3.39 mln. to €18.67 mln. and personnel increasing from 350 to 1,300 employees.[6]

In 2016, Sanlorenzo establishes a third division, Sanlorenzo Superyacht, after the acquisition of a new production site in the city of La Spezia. The production of the shipyard's entire metal superyacht line is moved from Viareggio to the new site.[7]
