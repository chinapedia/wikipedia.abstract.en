VALLEY RIDGE is an unincorporated community in Dunklin County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]


History

A post office called Valley Ridge was established in 1878, the name was changed to Valleyridge in 1894, and the post office closed in 1908.[2] The community was so named because despite its ridgetop location, the soil is said to be as fertile as if the town site were in a valley.[3]
