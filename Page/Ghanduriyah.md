GHANDOURIYEH () is a Lebanese municipality located in the Bint Jbeil District, south of Froun. It was formerly known as _Aidib_.


Name

In the 1800s, the village was called Aidib, and E. H. Palmer wrote in 1881 that the name came from a local form connected with “much sand”.[1]


History

In 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's _Survey of Western Palestine_ (SWP) described _Aidib_ as: "A small village, built of stone and mud, situated on the slope of a hill and surrounded by a few fig-trees and olives. It contains about ninety Metawileh, and is supplied with water from three rock-cut cisterns and a spring."[2]
