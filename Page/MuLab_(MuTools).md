MULAB is a digital audio workstation application for the macOS (OS X) and Windows platforms.

It is developed and maintained by a small company (MuTools, Belgium) led by Jo Langie, a pioneer in sequencer technology since early Atari microcomputers.

While the main MuLab target is electronic music, it can be also used for other musical genres. It may be also of interest for educational purposes to people learning digital audio processing.


Features

MuLab has most of the features of a standard full DAW: audio/MIDI recording, MIDI sequencing, mixing, automation, control surface interaction, multi-core, stock synths, samplers and effects, multi-projects and templates, etc.

MuLab has an internal architecture built around a modular system (_Mux_) enabling customized instruments and effects by drawing graphs of modules.

MuLab is also an open environment supporting existing VST plugins.
