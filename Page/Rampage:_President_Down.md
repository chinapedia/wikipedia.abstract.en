Plot

Three years after his second killing spree at a TV station in Washington D.C. (following which he was presumed dead in a massive explosion), Bill Williamson returns from hiding and, using a sniper rifle, assassinates the President of the United States, as well as the Vice-President and the Secretary of Defense (which happens off-camera).

While hiding out at his hut in the nearby woods, Bill then taunts the authorities, preparing for a final assault in which he expects to die as a martyr of his own cause, further establishing his iconic legacy. At the climax, Bill takes on and kills dozens more policemen who assault his strongpoint in the woods, but after killing off all of the police, Bill is fatally wounded and later dies. However, news of his death prompts thousands of people all across the US to finally act upon their anger towards the elite and wealthy people, as instructed in Bill's former video statements, resulting in nationwide chaos. It ends with a TV station reporting on all the mass shootings and chaos before the station itself it attacked by a gunman, who approaches the camera and claims that Williamson changed his life before shooting the camera.
