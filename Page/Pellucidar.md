PELLUCIDAR is a fictional Hollow Earth invented by American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs for a series of action adventure stories. In a crossover event between Burroughs's series, there is a Tarzan story in which he travels into Pellucidar.

The stories initially involve the adventures of mining heir David Innes and his inventor friend Abner Perry after they use an "iron mole" to burrow 500 miles into the Earth's crust. Later protagonists include indigenous caveman Tanar and additional visitors from the surface world, notably Tarzan, Jason Gridley, and Frederich Wilhelm Eric von Mendeldorf und von Horst.[1]


Geography

In Burroughs' concept, the Earth is a hollow shell with Pellucidar as the internal surface of his shell. Pellucidar is accessible to the surface world via a polar tunnel, allowing passage between both the inner and outer worlds[2] through which a rigid airship visits in the fourth book of the series.[3] Although the inner surface of the Earth has a smaller total area than the outer, Pellucidar actually has a greater land area, as its continents mirror the surface world's oceans and its oceans mirror the surface world's continents.

The peculiarities of Pellucidar's geography is because of the concave curvature of its surface, there is no horizon. The further distant an object is, the higher it appears to be, until it is finally lost in a void of atmospheric haze.

Pellucidar is lit by a miniature Sun suspended at the center of the hollow sphere, so it is perpetually overhead and gives a sensation of eternal noon wherever one is in Pellucidar. The sole exception is a region directly under a tiny geostationary Moon of the internal sun. As a result, this region is under a perpetual eclipse and is known as the LAND OF AWFUL SHADOWS. The moon has its own plant life and (presumably) animal life. Basically, the moon either has its own atmosphere or shares that with Pellucidar. The miniature sun does not change in brightness and never sets. So, with no night or seasonal progression, the natives have little concept of time. The events of the series suggest that time is elastic, passing at different rates in different areas of Pellucidar and varying even in single locations. Also, several characters from the outer world, who have lived in Pellucidar, appear to age slowly and exhibit considerable longevity. This is known through their interactions with visitors from the outer world where time remains fixed.


Culture

Pellucidar is populated by primitive civilizations and prehistoric creatures, including dinosaurs. The region in which Innes and Perry initially find themselves is ruled by the Mahars, a species of intelligent flying reptiles resembling _Rhamphorhynchus_ with vast psychic power. The Mahars use telekinesis on the neighboring tribes of Stone Age humans as a way of securing their territory.[4] Eventually, two explorers united the tribes in overthrowing the Mahars' reign and establish a human "Empire of Pellucidar" instead.[5]

While the Mahars are the dominant species in the Pellucidar novels, these creatures are usually confined to their handful of cities. Before their downfall, the Mahars used Sagoths (a race of gorilla-men who speak the same language as Tarzan's Mangani)[6] in enforcing their rule over any tribes who disobeyed orders.[7][8] Though Burrough's novels suggest that the Mahars' domain is limited to one relatively small region of the inner world, John Eric Holmes' authorized sequel _Mahars of Pellucidar_ indicates there are other areas ruled by Mahars.

Beyond the Mahars' domain exist independent human cultures, many of them at a Stone Age level of development. Technically, more advanced exceptions include the Korsars (corsairs), a maritime raiding society descended from surface-world pirates,[9] and the Xexots, an indigenous Bronze Age civilization.[10] All of the human inhabitants in Pellucidar share a common worldwide language.

Sequels by John Eric Holmes

John Eric Holmes's _Mahars of Pellucidar_ was a sequel to Burroughs' Pellucidar novels authorized by the Burroughs estate. Publication of Holmes' follow-up novel, _Red Axe of Pellucidar_, reportedly ready for print in 1980, was reportedly blocked by the estate, and only saw print much later in a limited private edition.[25]

1.  _Mahars of Pellucidar_ (1976)
2.  _Red Axe of Pellucidar_ (1993)


In other media

When DC Comics had the rights to the Burroughs properties in the early 70s, they did a comic book adaptation of _At the Earth's Core_ that ran in _Korak, Son of Tarzan_ #46, then moved to _Weird Worlds_ #1–5, then continued with an adaptation of _Pellucidar_ in #6–7. Another Pellucidar story appeared in _Tarzan Family_ #66. Dark Horse Comics will reprint this in trade paperback in 2017.

Pellucidar has appeared in one movie adaptation. The first novel was filmed as _At the Earth's Core_ (1976), directed by Kevin Connor with Doug McClure as David Innes and Peter Cushing as Abner Perry.[26]

The 1996 pilot of the TV series _Tarzan: The Epic Adventures_ also features Pellucidar, as well as the character Jana from the novel _Tarzan at the Earth's Core_. This story also features a race of Mahars who are able to transform into humanoid form. Also, in the 1996 novelization of _Tarzan: The Epic Adventures_ by R. A. Salvatore, based on the teleplay for the pilot of the series, Pellucidar is featured in the later part of the story. The story is inspired by the '' Return of Tarzan'' and _Tarzan at the Earth's Core_.

Pellucidar appears in a few episodes of the Disney cartoon series _The Legend of Tarzan_, loosely inspired by _Tarzan at the Earth's Core_. In the show however, Pellucidar is merely described as being a region below Africa where dinosaurs still live. None of the characteristics of it described in the novels are seen. In the episode "Tarzan and the Hidden World", Tarzan leads Professor Porter into Pellucidar so he can become famous before his rival, Professor Philander, who has also arrived in Africa. Professor Porter steals an egg from a T-Rex and the dinosaur retaliate s by chasing them. Philander's photographic proof of Pellucidar is ruined by a monkey who took photos with his camera. Pellucidar is mentioned again in "Tarzan and the Beast From Below". The episode revolves around some Velociraptors which escaped from Pellucidar and scare Terk.

Pellucidar appears in the _Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle_ episode "Tarzan at the Earth's Core".

Pellucidar is revisited by Tarzan and is the central location of the Dark Horse Comics crossover _Tarzan vs. Predator at the Earth's Core_ where Tarzan faces off against the alien Predator species in Pellucidar.


Influence

A tribute story, _Maureen Birnbaum at the Earth's Core_, appeared in _Maureen Birnbaum, Barbarian Swordsperson_.[27]

Pellucidar was the major inspiration for Lin Carter's _Zanthodon_ novels of the late 1970s and early 1980s, set in the vast cavern of Zanthodon beneath the Sahara desert.[28]

The Hollow Earth milieu of Skartaris in the _Warlord_ series of comic books by Mike Grell, published from 1976 to 1989, is essentially a translation of Pellucidar into the graphic medium, with the admixture of magic and elements of the Atlantis myth.[29]

The hollow interior of Earth seen in the 2008 Asylum film _Journey to Middle Earth_ bears some similarity to Pellucidar, although the film was intended as a film adaptation of a novel by Jules Verne.

The Hollow World of the fictional _Dungeons & Dragons_ setting of Mystara shares many concepts from Pellucidar, such as the polar opening(s), the central sun, the floating moon(s), and the primitive cultures living in the internal surface.

In James Blaylock's _The Digging Leviathan_ (1984), a pair of rival scientific teams compete to reach Pellucidar. However, the story concludes before their goal is attained. Blaylock's _Zeuglodon_ revisits the Pellucidar theme, when a group of children attempt to rescue Giles Peach, one of the characters traveling to Pellucidar in _The Digging Leviathan_.

In Robert A. Heinlein's _Number of the Beast_, the protagonists visit an inside-out world in their continua craft and discuss whether they've reached Pellucidar.[30]

In John Crowley's _Little, Big_ (1981), a drug named Pellucidar is mentioned and appears to have an exhilarating and even aphrodisiac effect.

During the initial explorations of Lechuguilla Cave in the late 1980s, a chamber was named "Pellucidar" in honor of these stories.

In Philip José Farmer's "Riders of the Purple Wage", there is a concept known as "the Pellucidar Breakthrough"

In Roderick Gordon's _Tunnels_ series, the GARDEN OF THE SECOND SUN is strongly based on Pellucidar.

The Hollow Earth concept was used by Vladimir Obruchev in his _Plutonia_ novel, published in 1924, also inhabited by ancient life forms. Due to his scientific and geology career, Obruchev wasn't a fan of the Hollow Earth concept. However, Obruchev did use his novel to describe Pleistocene, Jurassic, and Carboniferous fauna.
