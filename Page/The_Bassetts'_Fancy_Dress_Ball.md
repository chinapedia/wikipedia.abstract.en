Plot

Gussie Fink-Nottle has been keeping a notebook containing insulting observations on Sir Watkyn Bassett and Sir Roderick Spode, in order to keep his courage up about them. Gussie is naturally terrified of Spode, and even the smallest misunderstanding will put his life in jeopardy. Spode has two jobs—he is the leader of the Black Shorts,[4] but also designs and sells women's underwear, being the proprietor of a lingerie shop called _Eulalie Soeurs_. He is perpetually in fear that his followers in his first role will discover his second one and it is the threat of this disclosure which is used by Bertie to stop him assaulting Gussie. Jeeves revealed the secret pseudonym "Eulalie". When Gussie loses the notebook, he calls on Bertie to help find it. Gussie (dressed like the devil) is assaulted by Spode (a Roman soldier). Bertie finds a way of keeping Spode from beating Gussie into a jelly telling Spode: “Spode, I know all about Eulalie.”

The Rev. Harold "Stinker" Pinker and Stephanie "Stiffy" Byng wish to marry, but Stiffy's guardian Sir Watkyn doesn't approve. Stiffy blackmails Bertie into helping her convince her guardian otherwise.

Meanwhile Bertie comes into possession of a policeman's helmet.
