AMANGKURAT III (Amangkurat Mas) (ruled 1703-1704) was a short-lived ruler of Sultan in Java.

His father Amangkurat II of Mataram had been killed, and he soon lost to his uncle Pakubuwono I in the First Javanese War of Succession, which lasted on for five years until the Dutch managed to install Pakubuwana.

Amangkurat was deposed, but not caught until 1707. He was subsequently exiled to Ceylon, where he later died.
