_THE RESISTANCE WITH KEITH OLBERMANN_[1] (originally titled _THE CLOSER WITH KEITH OLBERMANN_)[2] was a political web series hosted by Keith Olbermann for _GQ_. It premiered on September 13, 2016 and ended on November 27, 2017. Typically three new episodes were posted every week and centered around criticism of Candidate, later President Donald Trump.[3] They are stylistically similar to the Special Comments from Olbermann's previous work, _Countdown with Keith Olbermann_.

On November 27, 2017, Olbermann announced his retirement from political commentary after episode 147 had aired,[4][5] citing his belief that "this . . . presidency of Donald John Trump will end prematurely and end soon, and I am thus also confident that this is the correct moment to end this series of commentaries".[6]
