DIYNAMIC is an underground electronic music label based in Hamburg, Germany. The DJ, producer and three time DJ Awards winner for Best Producer and Best Deep House DJ, Mladen Solomun is one of the founders along with Adriano Trolio.[1][2][3]


History

Before Adriano Trolio and Mladen Solomun founded Diynamic Music in November 4, 2006, Adriano worked as a promoter. He was one of the first guys who introduce the electro-house to Hamburg around 2002. At that time Solomun and Trolio throw monthly parties in which Solomun met Stimming and H.O.S.H with the same idea, to create their own label.[4] The _DIY_ name came up to make a reference to DIgital music.

They are called Diynamic Music instead of Diynamic Records because there is not specific _Diynamic sound_ . When they started, Diynamic Music used to be minimal, and they were also one of the first to try to mix _old school Detroit sound_ in a modern European way.[5][6] In 2013 the new kind of deep house that Diynamic played had lots of pop influences. It contained lots of vocals, a slow BPM, catchy bass-lines and sometimes even a chorus.[7]

In 2011, Adriano and Mladen launched their sub-label, _2DIY4_' (to die for)''''' a platform for anything that does not necessarily fit to Diynamic concept but they consider has to be released. This means bringing in a more overt pop influence.[8][9]

Diynamic Festival

With the idea of expanding into a more complete brand instead of club only, Studio 80’s representatives Jaap Mutsaers, Wytze Dijk and Diynamic created The Diynamic Festival.[11] The festival debuted on May 18, 2013 at the Arena Park in Amsterdam.[12] Since then, organisers have taken the concept on the road hosting large-scale showcases in Mexico, Brazil and Ibiza, featuring strictly the Diynamic artists only.[13]

The SECOND Diynamic Festival took place in May 30 at the Amsterdam Bos, a large forest about 30 minutes drive from the city centre.[14][15]

In May 29 two stages were presented for the THIRD Diynamic Festival, the usual outdoor big mainstage and the _new_ indoor second stage (all acts played longer sets).[16][17]

On May 27, 2016, the Diynamic Festival returned to the Amsterdam Forest but this time in a different location called “Land Van Bosse” – an area deep within the forest.[18]
