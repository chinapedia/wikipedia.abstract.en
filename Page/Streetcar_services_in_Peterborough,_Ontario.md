Postcard_of_a_streetcar,_on_George_Street,_in_Peterborough,_Ontario_-b.jpg Two STREETCAR SERVICES OPERATED IN PETERBOROUGH ONTARIO in the late 19th century and early 20th century.[1][2] The Peterborough and Ashburnham Street Railway Company operated from 1893 to 1898, and the Peterborough Radial Railway Company operated from 1902 until 1916.[3] The Peterborough Radial Railway Company was given a 30-year franchise, but the city took back the system in 1916.


Rolling stock

A streetcar manufacturer already existed in Peterborough, Edison Electric, renamed Canadian General Electric in 1892.[4][5] This firm built the streetcars for the Peterborough and Ashburnham Street Railway.


Routes

The company's first route ran north-south, from Auburn Mills to Lock Street, passing through the exhibition grounds for the Midland Central Fair.[6] A second route ran along Charlotte Street.

Peterborough was the first city in Ontario to provide streetlights, and the streetcar system shared electrical power with the streetlight system.[7]
