JOHN WILLIAM POLIDORI (7 September 1795 – 24 August 1821) was an English writer and physician. He is known for his associations with the Romantic movement and credited by some as the creator of the vampire genre of fantasy fiction. His most successful work was the short story "The Vampyre" (1819), the first published modern vampire story. Although originally and erroneously accredited to Lord Byron, both Byron and Polidori affirmed that the story is Polidori's.[1]


Family

John William Polidori was born on 7 September 1795 in London, the oldest son of Gaetano Polidori, an Italian political émigré scholar, and Anna Maria Pierce, an English governess. He had three brothers and four sisters.[2]

His sister, Frances Polidori, married exiled Italian scholar Gabriele Rossetti, and thus John, posthumously, became the uncle of Maria Francesca Rossetti, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Michael Rossetti, and Christina Georgina Rossetti. William Michael Rossetti published Polidori's journal in 1911.[3]


Biography

Polidori was one of the earliest pupils at the recently established Ampleforth College from 1804, and in 1810, went to the University of Edinburgh, where he wrote a thesis on sleepwalking and received his degree as a doctor of medicine on 1 August 1815, at age 19.[4]

In 1816, Dr. Polidori entered Lord Byron's service as his personal physician and accompanied him on a trip through Europe. Publisher John Murray offered Polidori 500 English pounds to keep a diary of their travels, which Polidori's nephew William Michael Rossetti later edited. At the Villa Diodati, a house Byron rented by Lake Geneva in Switzerland, the pair met with Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, her husband-to-be, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and their companion (Mary's stepsister) Claire Clairmont.

One night in June, after the company had read aloud from _Fantasmagoriana_, a French collection of German horror tales, Byron suggested they each write a ghost story. Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote "A Fragment of a Ghost Story" and wrote down five ghost stories recounted by Matthew Gregory "Monk" Lewis, published posthumously as the _Journal at Geneva (including ghost stories)_ and on return to England, 1816, the journal entries beginning on 18 August 1816. Mary Shelley worked on a tale with her husband that would later evolve into _Frankenstein_.[5] Byron wrote (and quickly abandoned) a fragment of a story, "A Fragment", featuring the main character Augustus Darvell, which Polidori used later as the basis for his own tale, "The Vampyre", the first published modern vampire story in English.[6]

Polidori's conversation with Percy Bysshe Shelley on 15 June 1816, as recounted in _The Diary_, is regarded as the origin or genesis of _Frankenstein_. They discussed principles, "the nature of the principle of life": "June 15 - ... Shelley etc. came in the evening ... Afterwards, Shelley and I had a conversation about principles - whether man was to be thought merely an instrument."[7][8]

Dismissed by Byron, Polidori traveled in Italy and then returned to England. His story, "The Vampyre", which featured the main character Lord Ruthven, was published in the April 1819 issue of _New Monthly Magazine_ without his permission. Whilst in London he lived on Great Pulteney Street (in Soho). Much to both his and Byron's chagrin, "The Vampyre" was released as a new work by Byron. Byron's own vampire story "Fragment of a Novel" or "A Fragment" was published in 1819 in an attempt to clear up the confusion, but, for better or worse, "The Vampyre" continued to be attributed to him.[9]

Polidori's long, Byron-influenced theological poem _The Fall of the Angels_ was published anonymously in 1821.[10]


Death

Polidori died in London on 24 August 1821, weighed down by depression and gambling debts. Despite strong evidence that he committed suicide by means of prussic acid (cyanide), the coroner gave a verdict of death by natural causes.[11]

Posthumous editions

Appearances in other media

Film

Multiple films have depicted John Polidori, and the genesis of the _Frankenstein_ and "Vampyre" stories in 1816.

-   _Gothic_ (1986), directed by Ken Russell
-   _Haunted Summer_ (1988), directed by Ivan Passer
-   _Remando al viento_ (1988; English title: _Rowing with the Wind_) directed by Gonzalo Suárez

Additionally, Polidori's name was used for a character in a television movie adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel: _Frankenstein: The True Story_ (1973), directed by Jack Smight.

Literature

-   Polidori appears as one of several minor characters killed off by Frankenstein's creature in Peter Ackroyd's novel _The Casebook of Victor Frankenstein_.[15]
-   Polidori is a central character in Federico Andahazi's novel _The Merciful Women_ (_Las Piadosas_ in the original Argentine edition). In it, he receives _The Vampyre_ written by the fictional character of Annette Legrand, in exchange for some "favours".[16]
-   Polidori appears as a character in Howard Brenton's play _Bloody Poetry_ (though for some reason Breton calls him William.)
-   Polidori is a prominent character and the catalyst in events in Brooklyn Ann's historical paranormal romance novel, _Bite Me, Your Grace_.
-   Polidori is a central character in Emmanuel Carrère's novel _Gothic Romance_ (_Bravoure_ in the original French edition), which, amongst other things, presents a fictionalised account of the events of 1816.
-   He appears as a character in Susanna Clarke's novel _Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell_.
-   Polidori appears as an enemy of Lord Byron (who is a vampire) in Tom Holland's novel _Lord of the Dead_.
-   Polidori is also the 'hero' of the novel _Imposture_ (2007) by Benjamin Markovits.
-   Polidori is also the central character in Derek Marlowe's novel _A Single Summer With L B_, which presents an account (fictionalised) of the summer of 1816.
-   Polidori appears as a minor and unsympathetic character in the Tim Powers' horror novel _The Stress of Her Regard_ (1989), in which Polidori does not write about vampires but becomes directly involved with them. In Powers' sequel (of sorts), _Hide Me Among the Graves_ (2012), Polidori is a vampire and a central villain menacing the novel's protagonists, his nieces and nephews in the Rossetti family.
-   Paul West's novel _Lord Byron's Doctor_ (1989) is a recreation, and ribald fictionalization, of Polidori's diaries. West depicts him as a literary groupie whose attempts to emulate Byron eventually unhinge and destroy him.
-   (2013): P.J. Parker's internationally-acclaimed historic fiction "Fire on the Water: A Companion to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"

Opera

-   Polidori functions as narrator in John Mueter's one-act opera _Everlasting Universe_ and has a speaking role in several scenes.

Television

-   In the _Highlander: The Series_ episode "The Modern Prometheus", which featured Lord Byron, one of the series regulars, Methos, serves as a stand-in for Polidori. Methos, who was immortal, was Byron's mentor, friend, and physician, and experienced the same events as the real Polidori did on that (in)famous night.

-   Polidori was also portrayed by Noah McLaughlin in the 2016 web series _Ungenial Summer_, which fictionalized the events of the summer of 1816 in the modern day. In this version, Polidori serves as a personal assistant to Lord Byron, rather than physician.
-   In the episode of CBBC children's television show Horrible Histories entitled Staggering Storytellers, Polidori was portrayed by Jalaal Hartley in the sketch about the original of his story, _The Vampyre_ and Mary Shelley's (portrayed by Jessica Ransom) story _Frankenstein_ while at Lord Byron's Villa Diodati in Switzerland.
