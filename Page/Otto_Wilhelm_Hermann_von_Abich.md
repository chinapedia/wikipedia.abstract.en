Biography

He was born at Berlin and educated at the local university.[1] His earliest scientific work is related to spinels and other minerals. Later he made special studies of fumaroles, of the mineral deposits around volcanic vents, and of the structure of volcanoes. In 1842 he was appointed professor of mineralogy in the university of Dorpat (Tartu), and henceforth gave attention to the geology and mineralogy of the Russian Empire.[2] Residing for some time at Tiflis, he investigated the geology of the Armenian Highland (this term was introduced by Abich)[3] and Caucasus.[4][5] In 1844 and 1845 he ascended Ararat volcano several times,[6] studied the geological event of 1840 that was centered on Ararat (Akori village). In 1877 he retired to Vienna, where he died. The mineral Abichite was named after him.[7]
