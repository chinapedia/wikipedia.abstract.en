ONE FOR ALL WORLD TOUR is the ninth concert tour by the Bee Gees in support of their eighteenth studio album _One_. The tour began on 10 April 1989 in Tokyo, Japan and ended on 7 December 1989 in Matsuyama, Japan.


Background

In early 1988, the Bee Gees began recording _One_ as their studio album after _E.S.P._ They stopped recording due to the death of their younger brother Andy Gibb on 10 March 1988. They continued recording in Mayfair Studios from November to December 1988 and February to March 1989. Just after they released their album, the brothers began touring in Japan, Europe, North America, Oceania and back to Japan. The full concert at the National Tennis Centre in Melbourne, Australia in November 1989 was released as a concert video entitled _One for All Tour_ on 10 April 1991. During the DVD era, it was re-released as _The Very Best of The Bee Gees Live!_ in 1997.
