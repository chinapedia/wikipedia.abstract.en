HASCON is a fan convention created by Hasbro to promote its various licensed properties, including _Transformers, G.I. Joe, My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,_ and _Magic: The Gathering._ It thus replaces the previous fan convention from Fun Publications, BotCon.[1] However, Fun Publications' G. I. Joe Convention continued to be held as of 2017. It was subsequently announced that the first HasCon is scheduled for September 8–10, 2017, at the Rhode Island Convention Center. Meanwhile, Summer Hayes, LLC., which organizes My Little Pony Fair convention, has announced that their convention will not be held for 2017, and would collaborate with HasCon instead.[2]
