_THE LEE KONITZ QUINTET_ (also called _AFFINITY_) is an album by American jazz saxophonist Lee Konitz recorded in 1977 and released on the Chiaroscuro label.[1][2]


Critical reception

Scott Yanow on Allmusic said "the two very complementary saxophonists take explorative solos on eight appealing chord changes, constantly challenging each other. Bob Mover would become much more individual within a few years but on this album it is very much like listening to a teacher and his prize student".[3]
