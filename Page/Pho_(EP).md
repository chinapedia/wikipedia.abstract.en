Critical reception

Stereo Champions gave the extended play a 9 out of 10 saying "Overall, this is a great EP, definitely one I’ll hold on to forever as it’s definitely some of her best work. I’m sure this year will also yield big results for Ms. Lennox as she’s just getting started. Hopefully, if she’s reading this she knows we appreciate her music and Washington, DC is watching and cheering her on all the way to the top."[8]
