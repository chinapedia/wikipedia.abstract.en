WAT KU TAO (; "Temple of the Gourd Pagoda") is a Buddhist temple in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The temple was built in 1613 to enshrine the remains of Nawrahta Minsaw, the first Burmese ruler of Lan Na.[1] The temple is known for its distinctive chedi, which was built in the Yunnanese style, arranged in a series of five diminishing spheres that represent the five historical and future Buddhas.[2] The temple presently caters to Chiang Mai's Shan community.[3]
