Reception

Brigitte Nielsen was nominated for a Golden Raspberry ("Razzie") for Worst Actress at the 10th Golden Raspberry Awards, where she ended up losing to Heather Locklear for _The Return of Swamp Thing_.[2]

_Los Angeles Times_ panned the film as thematically repetitive, "daringly banal", and a failure as a sex farce because so little of it is actually comedic.[3] Billiards film review site _8 Ball on the Silver Screen_ also criticized the film for its unbelievable billiards scenes that indicated no training of Nielsen for the role.[4]
