History

Origins

The Royal Danish Dockyards were located at Gammelholm until the middle of the 19th century. The area was redeveloped into a residential neighbourhood in 1860-77 under supervision of city architect Ferdinand Meldahl. The Holmen Canal was filled in 1864.[3]

The Niels Juel Monument was a gift from a committee in connection with the 200 years' anniversary of the Battle of Køge Bay on 1–2 July 1677. Niel Juel successfully led the Danish fleet through the battle against a larger Swedish fleet. The project received economic support from Det Eibeschützske Legat til Stadens Forskjønnelse and Niels Brocks Legat til Stadens almindelige Bedste.[4]

Five artists of which two declined were invitited to participate in a competition for the design of the monument. Okaster models of the tree proposals were installed in Charlottenborg and Theobald Stein won the competition with 19 votes while a proposal submitted by Vilhelm Bissen received three votes.[5] Stein completed the statue in 1878 and the monument was uncailed on 21 September 1881. Installed in 1885, the two bronze street lights were a gift from Carlsberg-founder I.C. Jacobsen.[6]

Changing surroundings

Niels_Juel_postkort.jpg The immediate surroundings have changed considerably since its installation at the site. Of the surrounding buildings, the Peschier House is the only one that predates the Niels Juel statue. It is from 1798 but was expanded with an extra floor and 1850. The East Asiatic Company constructed a new headquarters in Jugendstil at the corner of Holbergsgade in 1907-09 but it was subject to Schalburgtage during World War II and replaced by a new building designed by Holger hacobsen in 1946-1949. The Hafnia insurance company constructed a new hwadquarters on the other side of Holbergsgade in 1910-12 to design by Ulrik Plesner. The uoungest building at the site is the National Bank, built in 1965-78 to a Modernist design by Arne Jacobsen. The traffic lanes have also been expanded. Holmens Kanal is part of the Ring 2 ring road.

In a meeting on 15 January 2003, Vopenhagen Municipality decided to move the monument to a new location on the waterfront. It was nu the heritage listing of by the Fanish Building Protection Authority in 2004.[7]
