History

Some of the road, at least, was originally called CAMPDEN HOUSE ROAD.[1]

A chapel on the corner of Hornton Street and Hornton Place was built in 1794 for Congregationalists on land owned by William Phillimore.[2] By 1858, it became a Baptist chapel.[3] However, it was demolished in 1927.[4]

The street was home to a Nonconformist school until it was torn down in 1868 for the construction of the Metropolitan Railway.[5]

The musician Sir Charles Stanford (1852â€“1924) lived at no 56 from 1894 to 1916, and this is commemorated with a blue plaque, erected in 1961.[6]

Many of the houses are listed, including the entire terrace from 12 to 54, built form 1903, and designed by Frank Chesterton; running between Holland Street and Hornton Place, opposite Kensington Town Hall and Kensington Central Library.[7]
