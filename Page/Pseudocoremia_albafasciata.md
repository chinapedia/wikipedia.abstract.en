Taxonomy

This species was first described by Alfred Philpott in 1915 from specimens collected in Taihape in February and Feilding in March.[1] Philpott named the species _Selidosema albafasciata._ In 1917 Edward Meyrick, when listing the species, attempted to correct the spelling of the epithet to _albifasciata_.[2] This spelling was itself in error.[3] In 1988 John S. Dugdale assigned the species to the genus _Pseudocoremia_.[4] He retained the original spelling of the species epithet under the ICZN Rules, Article 32a (ii) and 32c.[5] The type specimen was collected by Augustus Hamilton[6] and is now held at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.[7]
