Biography

Mary Blanche O'Sullivan was born at Saint John, New Brunswick. She was educated in St. Vincent's Convent, and graduated from the Provincial Normal School. For some years, she taught in the public schools of Saint John, and while thus engaged also formed a literary connection, contributing short stories, essays, and descriptive articles to numerous publications in the US and Canada. In order to devote her time more fully to literary work, O'Sullivan resigned from St. Malachi's, and moved to Boston, in 1891, and in the following year, became a staff contributor and department editor on Donahoe's Magazine. During the editorship of Dr. Henry Austin Adams, O'Sullivan was promoted to the position of associate editor, and on his resignation, in 1898, she assumed the position as the editorial head of this monthly. In 1920, she became a naturalized citizen of the US.[2]
