Davy's aunt speculates that Joy Chembadan (Baburaj), Davy's classmate in school and now arch-nemesis, was the one who sent it to him.

Girija 'Giri' Vallabhan (Asif Ali) is from Pattikad and is a very naive person. He is friends with Ambiyettan (Nandhu), an emigrant guru from another part of Kerala, who introduces him to Davy and his gang, consisting of Bahuleyan (Irshad), Philip Kannadakkaran (Rony David) and Alahu (Achuthanandhan), after a fight in the market with Joy's henchmen.
