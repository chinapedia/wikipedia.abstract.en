CLIFFORD P. KUBIAK is an American inorganic chemist, currently a Distinguished Professor in Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Harold C. Urey Chair in Chemistry at the University of California, San Diego.[1][2] Over the course of his career, Kubiak has published over 200 scientific articles.[3] He has also received the American Chemical Society Award in Inorganic Chemistry,[4][5][6] and is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and American Chemical Society.[7]


Early life and education

Kubiak grew up in Connecticut, and displayed an interest in chemistry from an early age.[8]

In 1975, Kubiak received his bachelor’s degree with honors in chemistry from Brown University. He also received a Ph. D. in chemistry from the University of Rochester in 1980,[9][10][11] where he was a Sherman Clarke Fellow and an Elon Huntington Hooker Fellow.[12]


Career

After receiving his Ph. D., Kubiak performed postdoctoral research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with Mark S. Wrighton, where he worked from 1980 to 1981.[13][14] In 1982, Kubiak joined the faculty of Purdue University as an assistant professor; in 1987, he became an associate professor, before becoming a full professor in 1990.[15] During this time, he was also named the Robert A. Wheland Visiting Professor at the University of Chicago in 1997.[16]

In 1998, Kubiak left Purdue University and moved to the University of California, San Diego as the Harold C. Urey Endowed Chair Professor in Chemistry.[17][18] During his time at UCSD, he has also held the position of Chairman of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry from 2002 to 2006,[19] and was named Distinguished Professor in Chemistry and Biochemistry in 2008.[20][21] In 2012, he was also appointed to the position of Visiting Associate in Chemistry at the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (JCAP) at the California Institute of Technology.[22][23] He was also an Invited Visiting Professor of electrocatalysis at the Paris Diderot University in 2014,[24] and has been appointed to additional visiting positions at Tohoku University and the University of Erlangen.[25]

Kubiak has also served on the editorial advisory boards of several publications, such as _Accounts of Chemical Research_, _Inorganic Chemistry_, and _Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing_.[26]


Research

The Kubiak Research Group at the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry Graduate Program in Materials Science and Engineering currently studies the reduction of carbon dioxide by means of electrocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis.[27] In addition, his team has expanded research regarding electron-transfer reactions, which can be used in the advancement of molecular electronic devices.[28]

Contributions to nanoscience

Kubiak was involved in the research of nanoscience, with a focus on self-assembled monolayers, from its early days in the 1990s.[29] His work in this field has included research into gold nanoclusters and molecular conductivity.[30]

Gold nanoparticles

GoldNanoparticleElectronTransfer.png Among the properties of gold nanoparticles (or NPs) is their conductivity, allowing ultrafast electron transfer.[31] In 2005, Kubiak, along with Gabriele Canzi, used gold NPs to generate a picosecond ground-state electron transfer reaction, marking the first time such a reaction had been performed.[32] This ground-state electron transfer allowed for the accurate measurement of the resistances of individual carbon-based molecules.[33]

In 2005, J. Catherine Salsman, Tasuku Ito, and Kubiak energetically distinguished the conductive properties of gold nanoclusters and individual molecules by labeling the structures isotopically, and utilized infrared spectroscopy to observe asymmetry.[34]

Molecular self-assembly

In 1997, Kubiak and colleagues theoretically calculated the current-voltage properties of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of organic polymers.[35] Such properties depend on the equilibrium Fermi energy and the voltage division factor, _E_(f)_ and _η_ respectively, as determined by means of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).[36]

Carbon dioxide fixation

In 2014, Kubiak and his colleagues from the University of California, San Diego determined the efficiency of an alternate Re^(I)(bpy) catalyst complex pathway, an assembled supramolecular system, which can assist in the reduction of CO₂.[37] Later, his group also lead the work on replacing the scarce Re to the more abundant Mn in the catalyst for CO₂ reduction. It was seen that the reduction of byproduct CO₂, driven by solar power, wind, or electricity generated by running water, can produce fuels by means of a carbon-neutral energy cycle.[38]


Non-scientific pursuits

In addition to his work in the scientific community, Kubiak has also served as the Faculty Athletics Representative for the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics at the University of California, San Diego, a position he has held since 2007.[39] It is in this capacity that Kubiak received the Athletic Department’s Meritorious Service Award in June 2013.[40][41] He also chairs the Faculty Athletic Board of Advisors at the same university.[42]


Personal life

Kubiak is married, and currently resides with his wife in Del Mar, California.[43]


Controversies

In May 2011, a University of California, San Diego web page attributed to Kubiak was criticized for its use of a racial slur, specifically one targeting people of East Asian descent, as part of a list of “lab rules” supposedly meant to be humorous.[44][45] The web page was subsequently removed by UCSD officials; additionally, a statement was issued by Suresh Subramani and Mark Thiemens, respectively the executive vice chancellor for academic affairs and the dean of physical sciences at UCSD, offering an apology for Kubiak’s actions.[46] Kubiak himself issued an apology as well, claiming that he had no knowledge of the slur’s presence on his website but accepting full responsibility regardless.[47]


Awards and honors

In 2012, Kubiak was awarded the American Chemical Society Award in Inorganic Chemistry.[48][49][50] In addition to this prestigious award, he has also received a number of other awards and honors, including the following:
