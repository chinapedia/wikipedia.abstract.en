Hallstein and Sissel live together with their parents in a small village. One spring night they will be left alone at home for the first time while their parents are at a funeral in another village. There is a warm familiarity between them and they are looking forward to being at home. However, when they are about to eat supper, there is a knock on the door. A foreign family in need of help is standing outside. Their car has broken down, and a young woman with them is ready to give birth. They need room, beds, and a midwife.
