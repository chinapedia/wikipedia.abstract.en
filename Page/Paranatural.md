_PARANATURAL_ is a supernatural action/comedy webcomic created by Zack Morrison. The comic has been written and illustrated by Morrison since its debut in 2010, with five completed chapters and a sixth chapter currently ongoing. Set in the fictional town of Mayview, the comic follows the Activity Club, a group of middle school students who have the ability to interact with the supernatural world.

The comic began on ComicFury and Smackjeeves before later moving to its own site.[1][2][3]


Synopsis

The comic follows the adventures of Max and the Activity Club throughout their adventures. They fight ghosts and bullies, play hitball, and solve the mysteries of the town.[4] Max,_Paranatural_(Webcomic).png The story is told through an omniscient third person, sometimes including guest art or mini-comics. The comic is drawn page by page in a standard panel format, including shifted panels and extraneous movements depending on the activity going on. Morrison also includes alt text on each page, with a short comment on the page.

Morrison interacts with their readers through the text underneath the pages as well as both their Twitter[5] and Tumblr[6] accounts.


Reception

_Comic Book Resources_ has described _Paranatural_ as "fun, action-packed and visually inventive", with "enjoyable character moments", and compared it to _Dragon Ball Z_.[7] PopOptiq considered it to be "brimming with wit and humor",[8] while io9 emphasized that there is "a rich story sitting behind all that humor,"[9] and recommended it as worthy of an Eisner Award.[10] _The Hawkeye_ praised its humor, which it described as "a mix of almost self-aware snark, fun-loving parody, and downright great standalone jokes", its art, which it described as "a mix somewhere between western cartoon and anime", and its cast of characters.[11] _Inverse_ praised its "sly use of manga-esque stylistic tropes", remarking that "its characters leap off the screen".[12]

_Paranatural_ reached the final round of the Mix March Madness 2014 Webcomics Tournament, a single-elimination tournament between 128 contestants.[13][14]
