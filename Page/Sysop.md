A SYSOP (; an abbreviation of SYSTEM OPERATOR) is an administrator of a multi-user computer system, such as a bulletin board system (BBS) or an online service virtual community.[1] The phrase may also be used to refer to administrators of other Internet-based network services.[2]

CO-SYSOPS are users who may be granted certain admin privileges on a BBS. Generally, they help validate users and monitor discussion forums. Some co-sysops serve as file clerks, reviewing, describing, and publishing newly uploaded files into appropriate download directories.[3]

Historically, the term _system operator_ applied to operators of any computer system, especially a mainframe computer. In general, a sysop is a person who oversees the operation of a server, typically in a large computer system. Usage of the term became popular in the late 1980s and 1990s, originally in reference to BBS operators.[4] A person with equivalent functions on a network host or server is typically called a _sysadmin_, short for system administrator.[5]

Because such duties were often shared with that of the sysadmin prior to the advent of the World Wide Web, the term _sysop_ is often used more generally to refer to an administrator or moderator, such as a forum administrator. Hence, the term _sysadmin_ is technically used to distinguish the professional position of a network operator.[6]
