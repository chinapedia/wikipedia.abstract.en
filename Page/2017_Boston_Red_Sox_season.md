The 2017 BOSTON RED SOX SEASON was the 117th season in the team's history, and their 106th season at Fenway Park. They finished with a 93–69 record, the same as their previous season, two games ahead of the second-place New York Yankees. It was also the team's first season in 15 years without David Ortiz, due to his retirement. The Red Sox won their second straight American League East championship, the first time the team has won the division (which was established in 1969) in consecutive years; it was their ninth division title overall. In the postseason, they lost in four games in the American League Division Series to the eventual 2017 World Series champions, the Houston Astros.

Regular season

Opening Day, April 3 vs. Pittsburgh

Reigning AL Cy Young winner Rick Porcello made his first opening day start of his career, going 6 innings, allowing three runs on six hits in the win. The Red Sox bats could only get one hit off of Pirates starter Gerrit Cole through 4 innings but then strung together six 2-out hits. Jackie Bradley Jr. started the rally with a triple of the right field wall, Pablo Sandoval legged out an infield single, Sandy León laid down a bunt down the third base line, Dustin Pedroia with a single down the middle, which plated Pablo Sandoval, Andrew Benintendi with a three-run shot in the Pirates bullpen and Mookie Betts reached second on another infield single and a throwing error by the shortstop Jordy Mercer. Hanley Ramírez made the third out and Cole's day was over. Pittsburgh got to Porcello in the seventh, where he gave up three hits and three runs, two of them inherited by Matt Barnes. Barnes eventually got out of the inning. Neither team would score in the remainder of the game and Craig Kimbrel closed out the game on one hit and one hit batsman.

After Boston extended the lead to four, Sale struggled in the fifth and the Twins tied up the game, only to give up a two-run home run to Sandy León which barely left the park. Up by three in the eighth, Matt Barnes gave up a home run and could not make an out. Lefty Robby Scott got the out against the lefty batter but a run scored on the sacrifice fly.

Craig Kimbrel was again summoned from the bullpen in a non-save situation, with the go-ahead run at first and one out in the bottom of the eighth.
