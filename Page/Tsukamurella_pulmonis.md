_TSUKAMURELLA PULMONIS_ is a Gram-positive and aerobic bacterium from the genus of Tsukamurella which has been isolated from the sputum from a patient with lung tuberculosis in Germany.[1][2][3][4][5]


Characteristic as secondary metabolites production inducer by actinomycetes

_Tsukamurella pulmonis_ TP-B0596 induced production of anti-fungal 5aTHQs (5-Alkyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines)[6] and anti-bacterial Streptoaminals (lipidic [5,5]-Spirohemiaminals)[7] by _Streptomyces_ sp. HEK616. _T. pulmonis_ TP-B0596 was also shown to induce production of secondary metabolites; dracolactams by _Micromonospora_ sp. HEK797,[8] niizalactams by _Streptomyces_ sp. NZ-6,[9] chojalactones by _Streptomyces_ sp. CJ-5,[10] and Alchivemycin A by _Streptomyces_ sp. S-522.[11]
