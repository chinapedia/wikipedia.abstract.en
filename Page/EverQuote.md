EVERQUOTE is an online insurance marketplace and lead generation service founded in 2011 and headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.


Description

EverQuote began as a marketplace for car insurance, but it has since expanded to home and life insurance.[1]

The service provided by EverQuote is matching insurance-seekers with companies that others with similar profiles preferred in the past.[2] EverQuote does not directly give quotes on insurance rates. Instead, it selects a few companies whose insurance products were bought by similar drivers in the past, and gives those companies the insurance-seeker's contact information. The company representatives then will quote prices for products they offer.[3]

The service is free to insurance-seekers. According to the _Boston Globe_, "EverQuote collects referral fees from insurance providers when customers buy policies, but it doesnâ€™t allow companies to pay to be included in its recommendations."[4]


History

EverQuote was founded in 2011 by Seth Birnbaum and Tomas Revesz, who met at MIT.[5] Originally named AdHarmonics, the company was founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[6]

EverQuote was a part of the Cogo Labs incubator program run by the Massachusetts-based venture capital firm Link Ventures.[7][8] In 2013, the company moved to its own office space.

In May 2015, MicroStrategy founder Sanju Bansal and Vestmark CEO John Lunny became members of the board of directors.[9] In October 2016, EverQuote received $23 million in Series B funding via Savano Capital Partners, Stratim Capital LLC and Oceanic Partners, and T Capital Partners.[10][11][12][13]

In 2017, Everquote added $13 million to its previous $23M funding. At the same time, they added Mira Wilczek, CEO of Cogo Labs, to their board of directors, where she replaced Jonathan Shapiro.[14]

Advertising

In 2016, EverQuote began an Internet advertising campaign featuring images of two young employees (not always the same two employees,) with text such as "How 2 math grads are disrupting the insurance industry." This juxtaposition suggested to many that the young people in the photo were founders of Everquote.[15][16]

In response to controversy over the ads, co-founders Birnbaum and Revesz said that the photos were meant to showcase a "young, diverse" team at EverQuote. In March 2017, Everquote stated that they had paused the ads.[17] Everquote said that future ads would end confusion about the roles of the young employees pictured.[18]

EverDrive app

In 2016, EverQuote launched a new smartphone app called "EverDrive" to help drivers measure their driving safety, based on five criteria: phone use, speeding, accelerating, cornering and braking.[19] Between 1/4 and 1/3 of drivers using this app upgraded their safety skills, over a period of four months, to earn better scores from the app. [20]
