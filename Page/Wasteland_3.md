_WASTELAND 3_ is an upcoming role-playing video game developed by inXile Entertainment. It is a sequel to _Wasteland 2_ and it is set to be released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in early 2020.


Gameplay

_Wasteland 3_ will be a squad-based role-playing video game featuring turn-based combat.[1] The game will feature synchronous and asynchronous multiplayer.[2]


Plot

_Wasteland 3_ will be set in the freezing wastelands of a post-apocalyptic Colorado. The player will take control of the last surviving member of Team November, a Ranger Squad.[3]


Development

_Wasteland 3_ was announced by inXile Entertainment in September 2016. As with _Wasteland 2_, inXile chose to crowdfund the development of the game. Unlike their previous Kickstarter projects, inXile chose to use equity crowdfunding service Fig.[4] The crowdfunding campaign launched in October 2016, and concluded a month later with over $3 million raised.[5]

_Wasteland 3_ is being developed using the Unity game engine. The development team is composed of people who worked on _Torment: Tides of Numenera_ (2017).[6]

The game is scheduled to launch on Linux, macOS, PlayStation 4, Windows and Xbox One in Q4 2019.[7][8] After Microsoft Studios acquired the company, inXile hired more staff for the game's development and delayed its release date to early 2020.[9]
