Bowls career

World Championships

Campbell came to prominence in 1976 when he won the triples, fours and team gold medals at the 1976 World Outdoor Bowls Championship in Johannesburg. In the Triples with Nando Gatti and Kelvin Lightfoot they won 14 of their 15 matches.[1] In the fours with Gatti, Lightfoot and Bill Moseley they repeated the feat of winning 14 of the 15 matches played.[2]

The South African team completed a clean sweep of all events at the 1976 World Outdoor Bowls Championship. The lawn bowlers from South Africa were denied further opportunities to win medals due to the Sporting boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era.[3]

Sixteen years later he won the triples silver medal and fours bronze medal at the 1992 World Outdoor Bowls Championship in Worthing followed by another bronze at the 1996 World Outdoor Bowls Championship in Adelaide.
