The COCOROBÓ DAM () is a dam in the state of Bahia, Brazil. It provides a reservoir of water for irrigation and drinking in the arid _caatinga_ environment of the Raso da Catarina. The reservoir covers the ruins of the city of Canudos, scene of the War of Canudos in 1896–97.


Location

The Cocorobó Dam is in the Raso da Catarina region of the driest part of Bahia. The dam is about from the state capital, Salvador, near the junction of highways BR-116 and BR-225. It is in the municipality of Canudos. The Vaza Barria project, which built the dam, was to irrigate , control floods, support fish farming and supply water to the town of Nova Canudos. The dam is owned by the Departamento Nacional de Obras Contras as Secas (DNOCS).

The reservoir submerged the ruined city of Canudos, location of the War of Canudos (1896–97). This was apparently a deliberate effort to erase memories of the suppression of a popular revolt by the republican army in 1896–97. However, the Canudos State Park, created in 1986 to the south of the dam, preserves key sites of the war. The stated purpose of the park is to make it impossible to forget the martyrs led by Antônio Conselheiro.


Reservoir

The dam impounds the Vaza-Barris River. The river's watershed above the dam drains an area of . Average annual rainfall is , with annual runoff of 97 x . The river bed in the reservoir is covered by sandy alluvial deposits with pockets of silt. The shale sub-strata are massive, only moderately fractured and have low permeability. The reservoir covers an area of with a volume of . In September 2014 the reservoir was holding only 20% of capacity after a prolonged drought.


Dam structure

The dam is a fan-shaped earth dam with a sand-clay core, with the slope protected by riprap. The stony aggregate material and artificial sand were derived from quartzite on the right bank of the river beside the dam. The dam has a maximum height of , with a length of . The base of the dam is wide. The crest is wide at an altitude of .

The spillway ends in a fall and a dissipating basin at an altitude of . It is covered in reinforced concrete, and designed to handle . The water intake structure has a tower and twin tubes with diameter. The water intake has twin diameter tubes coated in reinforced concrete. It is dimensioned for flow of . It is controlled by two flat sluices upstream and manual control valves downstream.


Construction

Construction began in 1951, directly managed by DNOCS. Between 1951 and 1966 of landfill was excavated, or 48% of the total. In 1967 the dam reached its full volume, with of compacted landfill. Soon after the dam was completed in December 1967 part of the embankment slipped, with about moving about . This was repaired, and instruments installed to monitor the embankment, Some cracks appeared, and piezometric pressures were considered high. However, after further observations and analysis the dam was considered acceptable.
