BISMABENZENE (C₅H₅Bi) is the parent representative of a group of organobismuth compounds that are related to benzene with a carbon atom replaced by a bismuth atom. Bismabenzene itself has been synthesised but not isolated because it is too reactive.[1][2]

An unstable derivative with 4-alkyl substituents was reported in 1982.[3] A stable derivative was reported in 2016.[4][5] This derivative has two tri(isopropyl)silyl substituents in the ortho positions and was synthesised from aluminacyclohexadiene, bismuth trichloride and DBU.
