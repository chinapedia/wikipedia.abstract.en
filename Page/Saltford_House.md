SALTFORD HOUSE is a Grade II listed building in the village of Saltford, Somerset, England.[1]

The house was built in 1771.[2][3] It was probably built for his own use by the architect Thomas Bennett.[4] The three storey limestone building has a central door with ionic half columns on either side.[5] The gateways and garden walls were built at the same time as the house.[6]

In 1856 it bought by Admiral Benedictus Marwood Kelly who died there on 26 September 1867.[7][8] In 2016 the local member of parliament, Jacob Rees-Mogg unveiled a blue plaque at the house commemorating the time when the admiral was resident.[9]
