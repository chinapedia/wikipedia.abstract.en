Brief synopsis

The story tracks the lives of Gordon Walker, a failed playwright in his 40s and modestly successful screenwriter-actor, and his old flame Lee Verger, the stage name of Lu Anne Bourgeois Morgen, a successful actress who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia.[1] Gordon, an alcoholic drug addict whose second wife has just left him, goes on location to Mexico where they're filming Walker's screenplay which is an adaptation of Kate Chopin's _The Awakening_ that Lu Anne is starring in. Walker discovers that she has gone off of her medication in an attempt to more fully embody her character.
