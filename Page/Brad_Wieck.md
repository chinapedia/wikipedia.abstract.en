BRADLEY MICHAEL WIECK (born October 14, 1991) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball (MLB).


Career

Wieck attended San Jacinto Christian Academy in Amarillo, Texas. After high school he attended Frank Phillips College and was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 29th round of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft.[1] He did not sign with the Phillies and transferred to Cisco College. After one year at Cisco, he transferred to Oklahoma City University and was drafted by the New York Mets in the seventh round of the 2014 Major League Baseball draft.[2]

Wieck signed and spent 2014 with the Brooklyn Cyclones, posting a 1-1 record and 1.40 ERA in 16 relief appearances. He started 2015 with the Savannah Sand Gnats.[3] In June, he was acquired by the San Diego Padres as the player to be named later in an earlier trade for Alex Torres.[4] The Padres assigned him to the Class A Fort Wayne TinCaps and later promoted him to the Class A Advanced Lake Elsinore Storm. In 23 total games started between Savannah, Fort Wayne, and Lake Elsinore, he pitched to a 7-11 record, 4.09 ERA, and 1.40 WHIP.

Whereas Wieck had been working as a starter in 2015, starting all 23 games he pitched in and averaging 5 innings, he began work as a reliever in 2016 and recovered a mid-90s fastball that had lost in the rotation.[5] Wieck pitched 2016 with Lake Elsinore, where he was named an All-Star, and the Double-A San Antonio Missions.[6] In 41 total relief appearances between the two teams, he was 4-1 with a 1.17 ERA along with 93 strikeouts in 61.1 innings. After the season, he played in the Arizona Fall League.[7] Wieck began 2017 with the Triple-A El Paso Chihuahuas, but after posting a 10.29 ERA in his first seven games, was reassigned to San Antonio, where he finished the season, going 2-1 with a 2.64 ERA in 31 appearances out of the bullpen.[8]

After the 2017 season, the Padres added Wieck to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.[9]

Wieck began 2018 with San Antonio, but was promoted to El Paso in late June after putting up a 1.93 ERA with the Missions.[10] He had a 3.44 ERA in El Paso and struck out 34 batters in 18 innings. Wieck was promoted to the Major Leagues in September 2018.[11] He made in into five games in September, striking out 10 while allowing 1 earned run in 7 innings.

Wieck had cancer surgery in January 2019, but returned to the Major League camp in February and worked towards being at full strength by the end of Spring Training.[12]


Scouting Report

Brad Wieck is a 6'9" left-hander with a fastball, slider, and change-up. He averaged 92.8 mph with his fastball in the minors in 2018, which was down from the 95 mph speed he had earlier, but all the pitches play faster because of his height.[13]
