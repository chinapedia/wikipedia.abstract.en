Plot

Sathyamoorthy (Prem Menon) is a cruel gram panchayat chief who gives unfair judgements and he spreads terror among the villagers, he never misses an opportunity to whip the innocent villagers. So the villagers gave him the name of Sandiyar (brute). The villagers want Sandiyar to die while his Sandiyar's mother Annapoorni (K. R. Vijaya) wants him to become a good man. Sandiyar then befriends the crook Maruthu (Anandaraj) who saved his life from the villagers.

One day, the outspoken Meena (Kushboo) comes to Sandiyar's village and claims Sandiyar secretly married her in the past but Sandiyar says at the village court that nothing happened between them. Meena wants to get married to Sandiyar in front of the villagers and she starts to compel him in many ways. Sandiyar's mother Annapoorni strongly supports her and brings her to their home. Sandiyar finally gets married to her. After the wedding, Meena reveals to Sandiyar the reason behind her lie. In the past, at the village court, Sandiyar gave an unfair judgement who led his sister and mother to suicide.

Meena comes to know that Sandiyar also has a tragic past. His father (Jaishankar) was brutally killed by a family friend Mookaiah (T. K. S. Chandran) for acquiring his land and the villagers did nothing for preventing it. Sandiyar cannot forget that sad day, so he makes the life of the villagers a living hell. So far, Meena wanted to take revenge on him but now Meena tries to change him into a responsible village president. Afterwards, Sandiyar slowly falls under the spell of his wife Meena and he becomes a good person. Maruthu is none other than Mookaiah's son and he is urged to take all the wealth of Sandiyar. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.
