Synopsis

Aman (Ranvir Shorey) and Divya (Neha Dhupia) are a married couple leading a middle-class life in Delhi. Aman works for a real estate company while Divya works in a media company. Aman is fed up of being middle-class and wants to become rich and live in luxury. He, therefore, often cheats his company to make quick money. In one such deal, he borrows money from Raghuveer (Devendra Chowhan) and invests that money to book a plot of land to build a home for himself and his wife Divya. But his boss (Sandeep Narula) gets to know of Aman cheating the company and he sacks him from the job.

Divya goes to a party held by her media company and is told that she is a part of the group set to go to Hong Kong.

Divya discovers she is pregnant and calls her friend, Diksha, telling her that Aman will make her keep the baby and that she doesn't want it at all and so decide to get a abortion in secret. Aman then shows Divya the plot of land he has booked, he does not reveal anything about the loss of job to her. Aman asks for his money back from his from who he bought it from but is refused, getting him in a fix. Raghuveer threatens Aman and even has him beaten up by his goons when he doesn’t return the money on the promised date and lets him have two more days. Divya finds out about it after seeing him at the hospital after her abortion.

Raghuveer comes to his house and threatens him again as well as his wife and gives him a week to return the money.

Aman tries to borrow money against his life insurance policy but the insurance company refuses. It is then that Aman decides to fake his death so that his wife could claim money from the life insurance company. Divya is against the plan but finally gets sucked into it when he carries it out.

Critical reception

Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film 2 out of 5 stars and said, "Shorey is good as usual, nailing the desperation of the kind of person who feels entitled to grab what he can because that’s what he sees everyone doing. Dhupia has a strong track too. But some performances are inept. And the climax, as well as the lead-up to it, is a stretch."[5]

Reza Noorani of The Times of India rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and said, "Although it's a well made crime thriller, there are a few loose ends which could have been tied up well. The effect is that the end leaves you wanting more."[6]
