JOSEPH KUSHNER (né BERKOWITZ;[1] October 10, 1922[2] – October 5, 1985) was an American real estate magnate, the father of Murray Kushner and Charles Kushner, grandfather of Jared Kushner, Joshua Kushner, and Marc Kushner. At the end of his career, he owned over 4,000 apartments, houses, and properties, which he willed to his family.

He was born in October 1922 to Chana and Moshe Berkowitz.[3] In August 1945, he married Reichel "Rae" Kushner (February 27, 1923 – 2004) in Budapest.[4][5] Rae Kushner is from the city of Navahrudak, and is remembered for leading 350 people with her brother to escape (via digging a tunnel) from the local Jewish ghetto established by the Nazis. Joseph is also from the Novogrudok area, and took his wife’s last name upon marriage due his lower social status.[6] In an area where about 10,000 Jews lived before World War II, about 550 survived. The story of Rae Kushner and her brother Honie is on display in the local Museum of Jewish Resistance, for which Charles Kushner was the chief benefactor.[7] The Kushners came to the US as Sh'erit ha-Pletah from the USSR in 1949.[8]

The Joseph Kushner Hebrew Academy and the Rae Kushner Yeshiva High School, both in Livingston, New Jersey, are named in their honour.[9]
