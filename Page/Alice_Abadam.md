ALICE ABADAM (2 January 1856 – 1940) was a Welsh suffragette and public speaker.


Early life

Abadam was born in London in 1856 to Edward Ab Adam and his wife Louisa (née Taylor). Her father was the eldest son of Edward Hamlin Adams, a Jamaican-born banker and merchant who made his money overseas before settling in Britain.[1] In 1825 Edward Hamlin Adams bought Middleton Hall in Carmarthenshire following the death of its owner, Sir William Paxton. The Hall was passed down to his son Edward in 1842,[2] who added the old Welsh patronym, Ab, to the family name.

Abadam, by her own account, had a happy childhood and was educated by a governess at Middleton Hall. She was the youngest of seven children, and saw little of her mother who suffered ill-health brought about by post-natal depression. By 1861 her mother was living away from the family in Brighton, and in 1871 was living back at her paternal home in Dorset. Despite living apart, her parents remained married until the death of Edward in 1875.[3]

Her father was a High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire.[4] He held anti-clerical views, but Abadam converted to Catholicism in 1880. A musical upbringing led her to becoming the organist and choir master at St Mary's Church on Union Street, in the centre of Carmarthen.


Work as a suffragette

In 1905 Abadam subscribed to the Central Society for Women's Suffrage. She became a well known speaker and she addressed a number of suffrage societies. She died in Abergwili in 1940 and left her money to her niece.[5]
