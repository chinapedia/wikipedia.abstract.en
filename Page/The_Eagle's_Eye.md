The_Eagle's_Eye_(1918)_-_4.jpg, and William Bailey.]] _THE EAGLE'S EYE_ is a 1918 American serial film consisting of 20 episodes that dramatizes German espionage in the United States during World War I.[1][2] It features King Baggot in the lead role as the daring espionage agent. Among the events depicted are the sending of the Zimmermann Telegram, Franz von Rintelen's attempts to sabotage cargo loading in San Francisco Harbor, and the capture of the German espionage plans. It was directed by George Lessey, Wellington A. Playter, Leopold Wharton, and Theodore Wharton, and produced by the Whartons Studio. The serial is now considered lost.[3] Because this serial was a commercial failure, it was the last one made by Whartons due to the studio being forced to declare bankruptcy.
