The NOORAN SISTERS – JYOTI NOORAN and SULTANA NOORAN – are a Sufi singing duo from Jalandhar, India. They perform Sham Chaurasia gharana classical music.


Early life

The sisters were trained for ten years by their father, Ustad Gulshan Mir, grandson of Bibi Nooran and son of Swarn Noora, a Sufi singer of the 1970s. According to Mir, the family fell on hard times after Swarn Noora died and Mir gave music lessons to support them.[1]

When Sultana was seven and Jyoti was five, Mir discovered their talent for singing and contacted Music Director Kuljit Singh. Their first recording was 'Kulli', under his direction. They were playing, and in jest began singing a Bulleh Shah _kalam_ they had heard from grandmother. They didn't miss a beat and sang professionally with _tabla_ and harmonium. Iqbal Mahal, a Canadian music promoter, discovered the sisters in 2010 and played a big role in their success. They performed at Baba Murad Shah Dargah in Nakodar. Their song "_Allah Hoo"_ was a YouTube hit. After that songs such as "_Tera Rab Ton vee Vadh Ke Deedar_" and _"Mein Keenu Keenu Dassan"_ played an important role in boosting the duo's popularity.
