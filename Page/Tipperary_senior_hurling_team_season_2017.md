On 11 March Tipperary played Kilkenny under the lights in round 4 of the National Hurling League at Semple Stadium. The match was televised live by Eir Sport. This was the 31st league and championship clash between the counties since Brian Cody took over as manager of Kilkenny in 1999. There were 41 players training with the Tipperary hurling panel for the league and the starting side included ten of the starting fifteen which started the 2016 All Ireland Final against Kilkenny.[37] Tipperary went on to maintain their unbeaten record when substitute Steven O’Brien scored a 70th minute point to earn a draw. On a warm dry night Tipperary led by four points at half-time on a 2-11 to 2-7 scoreline.[38][39] John McGrath got the opening goal for Tipperary in the third minute with a low shot along the ground from close range after confusion in the Kilkenny full-back after a high ball into the square. Kilkenny replied with a goal from TJ Reid when he shot powerfully to the net which left Darragh Mooney rooted to the spot after five minutes.[40][41] Niall O’Meara got the second goal for Tipperary when he fired low to the right of the net across the goalkeeper after a short run at goal and an initial pass from John O’Dwyer, this put Tipperary in a 2-7 to 1-2 lead. O’Meara's goal was later voted at the end of 2017 as the GAA hurling goal of the year.[42] [43][44][45] TJ Reid scored from a penalty after thirty minutes, after a Michael Cahill foul on Alan Murphy. In the second half Padraic Maher brought down Liam Blanchfield in the 56th minute with TJ Reid scoring his third goal of the game and his second penalty.[46][47][48] It was revealed that Brendan Maher may miss the remainder of the league after he damaged his AC joint in round 3 against Clare.

On 26 March Tipperary, already assured of finishing on top, played Cork in round 5 of the National Hurling League at Páirc Uí Rinn. Highlights of the match were shown that night on League Sunday. Tipperary and Cork had previously met on 60 occasions in the National Hurling League with Cork leading with 29 wins to Tipperary’s 26, while there have been 5 draws. John Meagher and Willie Ryan made their first starts in the league while Tommy Heffernan made his league debut, goalkeeper Darren Gleeson started his first league game of the year.[52] [53] In a match played in warm sunny conditions, Cork had a 0-14 to 2-6 lead at half-time.[54] The first half Tipperary goals came from Seamus Callanan with a close range finish after a rebound came back to him from a John McGrath shot and a minute later from John McGrath this time the finisher after a pass from Seamus Callanan. In the second half with time almost up Séamus Callanan got his second goal of the game when he kicked to the net to level the match.[55][56] Patrick Horgan then put Cork back in front with a point before Ronan Maher equalized with a sideline cut. There was still time for Patrick Horgan to put Cork in front again with a long range point in the 74th minute which turned out to be the winning score. It was the first defeat of the season for Tipperary.[57][58]

On 2 April, Tipperary went on to play Offaly in the Quarter-final at O'Connor Park in Tullamore after the draw for home advantage was made on 27 March.[59][60] Tipperary won the game easily by 18 points on a 4-28 to 3-13 scoreline.[61] [62] Cathal Barrett returned after having a scheduled operation on an ankle for his first game of the year, while defender Alan Flynn made his League debut starting at corner back.[63] Playing against the breeze in the opening half, they had a 1-14 to 0-7 lead at half-time with the first goal coming from Seamus Callanan in the 17th minute after an assist by Niall O’Meara.[64][65] Tipperary led by 25 points at one stage in the second half before a late rally by Offaly brought the score down.[66][67]

Tipperary went on to play Wexford at Nowlan Park in the semi-finals on Easter Sunday 16 April, with the winners playing Galway who beat Limerick earlier in the final.[68] [69] The match was shown live by TG4.[70] Brendan Maher was expected to return from a shoulder injury he sustained against Clare in March. Patrick Maher returned to the panel after returning from a six-month Army peacekeeping trip to Syria.[71] Tipperary had a two-day get-together at the Abbottstown’s Centre of Excellence over the weekend of 8 and 9 April. Six players were cut from the squad, Andrew Coffey, Tommy Heffernan, Padraig Greene, Stephen Cahill, Dylan Fitzell and Willie Ryan.[72][73] Brendan Maher returned to the team for the semi-final alongside Jason Forde who replaced Michael Breen in midfield. John O’Dwyer didn't start the game and was replaced in attack by Steven O’Brien. Donagh Maher picked up a hamstring injury in training the week before the game and will be out for a number of weeks.[74][75] In dry and warm conditions, Tipperary won the game on a 5-18 to 1-19 scoreline.[76] With ten minutes to go in the game, Tipperary were two points in front but they then went on a run of scoring 2-4 without reply in a five-minute spell to go on and win the game with ease in the end.[77] Tipperary had a 2-6 to 0-8 lead at half time with the first half goals coming form John McGrath in the 6th minute and the second from Noel McGrath in the 18th minute after a pass from Niall O’Meara.[78] Wexford manager Davy Fitzgerald then entered the field to challenge referee Diarmuid Kirwan thinking that it should have been a free to Wexford before the second goal. He confronted Tipperary’s Niall O’Meara and shoved Jason Forde before leaving the field of play. John McGrath was named as the man of the match.[79] [80][81][82][83][84][85][86]

The league final against Galway was played at the Gaelic Grounds on 23 April with a 3:30 throw in. The match was shown live by TG4.[87] Tipperary were aiming for their first league title win since 2008.[88] It was confirmed the day after the semi-final victory that Séamus Callanan had broke his thumb during that game and would miss the final.[89][90][91] On 20 April, Jason Forde was handed a proposed two-game suspension for his reaction to Davy Fitzgerald coming on the field of play in the semi-final win.Tipperary have already indicated that they will appeal the decision.[92][93] Forde was named in the starting line-up alongside the returning Michael Breen and John O'Dwyer instead of Niall O'Meara and the injured Seamus Callanan.[94] In the final, Galway won by 3-21 to 0-14.[95][96] Galway were dominate throughout the match and had a 0-11 to 0-5 lead at half-time with several other scoring opportunities missed.[97] In the first minutes of the second half Jason Flynn scored the first goal of the game when he cut in from the left before firing to the roof of the net.[98][99] He got his second in the 57th minute when he again managed to cut in from the left before firing past the advancing Darren Gleeson.[100][101][102] Patrick Maher came on in the second half to make his first appearance of the year and hit one shot against the bar, but Galway had complete control of the match and got a third goal late on from Cathal Mannion when he fired low to the left.[103] Tipperary manager Michael Ryan speaking after the match said "I can’t explain where it all went wrong, that was a complete non-show from us."[104][105] The loss was Tipperary's biggest ever defeat in an All-Ireland or National League final and the defeat means that Kilkenny remain the only county to win the League title as reigning All-Ireland champions since Galway in 1989.[106][107][108][109] Two days after the defeat to Galway, Kieran Bergin informed manager Michael Ryan that he was departing the panel due to work commitments, he subsequently joined the Tipperary Senior football panel a week later.[110][111]
