SANJEEV ANANT GALANDE (born 1967) is an Indian cell biologist, epigeneticist, academic, chair of biology and the Dean of research and development at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune [1] He heads the Laboratory of Chromatin Biology and Epigenetics (Sanjeev Galande Lab) at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune. he is the founder of the _Centre of Excellence in Epigenetics_ at IISER and is known for his studies on higher-order chromatin architecture and how it influences spatiotemporal changes in gene expression.[2] He is an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy[3] and the Indian Academy of Sciences[4] and a recipient of the National Bioscience Award for Career Development of the Department of Biotechnology.[5] The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 2010, for his contributions to biological sciences.[6]


Biography

Sanjeev Galande, born on 20 September 1967 in Pune, in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, did his master's degree in biochemistry (MSc) at Savitribai Phule Pune University[7] before obtaining his doctoral studies from the Indian Institute of Science in 1996.[8] He moved to the US the same year to join the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to complete his post-doctoral studies on the _role of MAR-binding proteins in tumorigenesis_ in 2001 and on his return to India, he joined National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) as a senior scientist.[9] He headed the Sanjeev Galande Laboratory at NCCS till 2010 when he shifted to the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune as a professor[10] and established the _Centre of Excellence in Epigenetics_ (CoEE) there.[11] He heads the _Laboratory of Chromatin Biology and Epigenetics_ where he hosts a number of researchers who focus their studies on _evolution of epigenetic mechanisms using multiple model systems_.[12] He also serves as an adjunct faculty at Savitribai Phule Pune University.[13]


Legacy

Galande's early researches during his doctoral studies were on MAR-binding proteins and carcinogenesis but later he shifted his focus to cell-type specific patterns of gene expression and how chromatin levels influence them which was the theme of his researches at NCCS.[14] His team demonstrated the effect of cellular signaling pathways impact the chromatin levels. After his move to IISER, Pune, he started working on epigenetic regulation on various substrata viz. yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans (round worm), Drosophila (fruit flies), Zebrafish and humans, using them as biological model systems.[15] His team investigate biological processes such as transcription, gene regulation, cell proliferation, self-renewal and regeneration and their interrelations for which they employ genetic, biochemical, molecular and computational approaches. His studies are reported to have assisted in widening our understanding of the development and differentiation of T cells and the impact of Wnt signaling pathways in the process.[16] He is involved in three running projects; _Intergenerational programming of diabesity in offspring of women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (InDiaGDM)_, _Role of chromatin organizer SATB1 in T cell development and differentiation_ and _The role of Chromatin reorganisers in X inactivation_.[17]

Galande has detailed his researches by way of a number articles and ResearchGate, an online article repository has listed 87 of them.[18] He has mentored several scholars at his laboratories in NCCS and IISER and coordinated the _National Research Scholars Meet in Life Sciences_ in 2005.[19] He has also established a number of multidisciplinary academic programs at IISER which covers such topics as biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, cell biology, proteomics, and genomics and has participated in several seminars on these topics.[20]


Awards and honors

Galande's contributions to the biological sciences earned him the National Bioscience Award for Career Development of the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) in 2006.[21] The same year, DBT selected him for the _Swarnajayanthi Fellowship_ for life sciences.[22] In 2010, he was awarded the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research[23] and the Wellcome Trust chose him for the Senior Research Fellowships in Basic Biomedical Science.[24] He received the 2014 G. D. Birla Award for Scientific Research of the K. K. Birla Foundation in 2015.[25] He is an elected fellow of two major Indian science academies, Indian Academy of Sciences (2010)[26] and Indian National Science Academy (2012).[27]
