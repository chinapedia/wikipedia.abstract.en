Reception

Michael G. Nastos of AllMusic calls the album "a surprisingly fine effort, ebbing and flowing from track to track, with McLaughlin's high-level musicianship shining through, same as it ever was."[3] John Kelman in All About Jazz wrote "One of the most fluent, evocative and powerful albums in a career filled with high points" and concludes "McLaughlin's Indian friends may not have jazz in their blood the way it is in the guitarist's, but by approaching unmistakably western-informed music with an eastern mindset, they make _Floating Point_ an album that, in McLaughlin's lengthy discography, is one of his most successful fusion records".[4]
