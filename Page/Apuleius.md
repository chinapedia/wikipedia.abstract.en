APULEIUS (; also called LUCIUS APULEIUS MADAURENSIS; c. 124 – c. 170 AD)[1] was a Latin-language prose writer, Platonist philosopher and rhetorician.[2] He was a Numidian who lived under the Roman Empire[3] and was from Madauros (now M'Daourouch, Algeria). He studied Platonism in Athens, travelled to Italy, Asia Minor, and Egypt, and was an initiate in several cults or mysteries. The most famous incident in his life was when he was accused of using magic to gain the attentions (and fortune) of a wealthy widow. He declaimed and then distributed a witty _tour de force_ in his own defense before the proconsul and a court of magistrates convened in Sabratha, near ancient Tripoli, Libya. This is known as the _Apologia_.

His most famous work is his bawdy picaresque novel, the _Metamorphoses_, otherwise known as _The Golden Ass_. It is the only Latin novel that has survived in its entirety. It relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius, who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into a donkey.


Life

Apuleius,_Opera_omnia,_1621_-_BEIC_9468424.tiff Apuleius was born in Madauros, a _colonia_ in Numidia on the North African coast bordering Gaetulia, and he described himself as "half-Numidian half-Gaetulian."[4] Madaurus was the same _colonia_ where Augustine of Hippo later received part of his early education, and, though located well away from the Romanized coast, is today the site of some pristine Roman ruins. As to his first name, no _praenomen_ is given in any ancient source;[5] late-medieval manuscripts began the tradition of calling him _Lucius_ from the name of the hero of his novel.[6] Details regarding his life come mostly from his defense speech (_Apology_) and his work _Florida_, which consists of snippets taken from some of his best speeches.

His father was a provincial magistrate (_duumvir_)[7] who bequeathed at his death the sum of nearly two million sesterces to his two sons.[8] Apuleius studied with a master at Carthage (where he later settled) and later at Athens, where he studied Platonist philosophy among other subjects. He subsequently went to Rome[9] to study Latin rhetoric and, most likely, to speak in the law courts for a time before returning to his native North Africa. He also travelled extensively in Asia Minor and Egypt, studying philosophy and religion, burning up his inheritance while doing so.

Apuleius was an initiate in several Greco-Roman mysteries, including the Dionysian Mysteries.[10] He was a priest of Asclepius[11] and, according to Augustine,[12] _sacerdos provinciae Africae_ (i.e., priest of the province of Carthage).

Not long after his return home he set out upon a new journey to Alexandria.[13] On his way there he was taken ill at the town of Oea (modern-day Tripoli) and was hospitably received into the house of Sicinius Pontianus, with whom he had been friends when he had studied in Athens.[14] The mother of Pontianus, Pudentilla, was a very rich widow. With her son's consent – indeed encouragement – Apuleius agreed to marry her.[15] Meanwhile, Pontianus himself married the daughter of one Herennius Rufinus; he, indignant that Pudentilla's wealth should pass out of the family, instigated his son-in-law, together with a younger brother, Sicinius Pudens, a mere boy, and their paternal uncle, Sicinius Aemilianus, to join him in impeaching Apuleius upon the charge that he had gained the affections of Pudentilla by charms and magic spells.[16] The case was heard at Sabratha, near Tripoli, c. 158 AD, before Claudius Maximus, proconsul of Africa.[17] The accusation itself seems to have been ridiculous, and the spirited and triumphant defence spoken by Apuleius is still extant. This is known as the _Apologia (A Discourse on Magic)_.[18]

Apuleius accused an extravagant personal enemy of turning his house into a brothel and prostituting his own wife.[19]

Of his subsequent career we know little. Judging from the many works of which he was author, he must have devoted himself diligently to literature. He occasionally gave speeches in public to great reception; he had the charge of exhibiting gladiatorial shows and wild beast events in the province, and statues were erected in his honor by the senate of Carthage and of other senates.[20]

The date, place and circumstances of Apuleius' death are not known.[21][22] There is no record of his activities after 170, a fact which has led some people to believe that he must have died about then (say in 171), although other scholars feel that he may still have been alive in 180 or even 190.[23]

_The Golden Ass_

_The Golden Ass_ (_Asinus Aureus_) or _Metamorphoses_ is the only Latin novel that has survived in its entirety. It is an imaginative, irreverent, and amusing work that relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius, who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into an ass. In this guise he hears and sees many unusual things, until escaping from his predicament in a rather unexpected way. Within this frame story are found many digressions, the longest among them being the well-known tale of Cupid and Psyche.

The _Metamorphoses_ ends with the (once again human) hero, Lucius, eager to be initiated into the mystery cult of Isis; he abstains from forbidden foods, bathes, and purifies himself. He is introduced to the _Navigium Isidis_. Then the secrets of the cult's books are explained to him, and further secrets are revealed before he goes through the process of initiation, which involves a trial by the elements in a journey to the underworld. Lucius is then asked to seek initiation into the cult of Osiris in Rome, and eventually is initiated into the _pastophoroi_ – a group of priests that serves Isis and Osiris.[24] The adventures of the ass stand at the beginning of the picaresque novel tradition which eventually produced _The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling_.[25]

The Apologia

Apologia (_Apulei Platonici pro Se de Magia_) is the version of the defense presented in Sabratha, in 158-159, before the proconsul Claudius Maximus, by Apuleius accused of the crime of magic. Between the traditional exordium and peroratio, the argumentation is divided into three sections:

-   in the first, the writer refutes the accusations leveled against his private life. He demonstrates that by marrying Pudentilla he had no interested motive and that he carries it away, intellectually and morally, on his opponents.
-   The second tends to prove that his so-called "magical operations" were in fact indispensable scientific experiments for an imitator of Aristotle and Hippocrates, or the religious acts of a Roman Platonist.
-   The third recounts the events that have occurred in Oea since his arrival and pulverize the arguments against him.

The main interest of the Apology is historical: it offers a lot of information about its author, magic and life in Africa in the second century. But, it is not devoid of literary value.[26]

Other works

His other works are:

-   _Florida_. A compilation of twenty-three extracts from his various speeches and lectures.
-   _De Platone et dogmate eius (On Plato and his Doctrine)_. An outline in two books of Plato's physics and ethics, preceded by a life of Plato
-   _De Deo Socratis (On the God of Socrates)_. A work on the existence and nature of demons, the intermediaries between gods and humans. This treatise was roughly attacked by Augustine of Hippo. It contains a passage comparing gods and kings which is the first recorded occurrence of the proverb "familiarity breeds contempt":[27]
-   _On the Universe_. This Latin translation of the work _De Mundo_ is probably by Apuleius.

Apuleius wrote many other works which have not survived. He wrote works of poetry and fiction, as well as technical treatises on politics, dendrology, agriculture, medicine, natural history, astronomy, music, and arithmetic, and he translated Plato's _Phaedo_.[28]

Spurious works

The extant works wrongly attributed to Apuleius are:[29]

-   _Peri Hermeneias_ (_On interpretation_). A brief Latin version of a guide to Aristotelian logic.
-   _Asclepius_. A Latin paraphrase of a lost Greek dialogue (_The perfect discourse_) featuring Asclepius and Hermes Trismegistus.


Apuleian Sphere

The Apuleian Sphere described in _Petosiris to Nechepso_, also known as "Columcille's Circle" or "Petosiris' Circle",[30] is a magical prognosticating device for predicting the survival of a patient.[31]
