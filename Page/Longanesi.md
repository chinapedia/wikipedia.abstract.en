LONGANESI, also known as LONGANESI & C., is a publishing house based in Milan, Italy. It was founded in 1946 by Leo Longanesi and industrialist Giovanni Monti.[1] It initially got a large success thanks to some editorial series such as '' La buona societ√†'' and _La gaia scienza_.[2]

After a period of crisis, Longanesi was relaunched by Mario Spagnol (1930-1999) through the acquisition of some prestigious publishing houses such as _Guanda_, _Salani_ and _Corbaccio_ and through some successful ventures in the field of paperbacks.[3]
