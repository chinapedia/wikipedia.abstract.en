PETER K. WINKLER (born 1943, Los Angeles, California) is an American composer and a musicologist specializing in the theory of popular music. His compositions include both concert works and music for the theater; many of his works involve a synthesis of popular and classical styles.[1]


Biography

While a high school student, Winkler studied composition and theory with Howard Brubeck, and at Aspen Music School (1959) with Darius Milhaud. He earned a B.A. in Music at the University of California (1963), studying with David Lewin and Seymour Shifrin,[2] and an M.F.A. at Princeton University, where his principal teacher was Earl Kim.[3] He continued studying with Earl Kim as a Junior Fellow in the Society of Fellows at Harvard University (1968–71)[4] He then joined the music faculty of Stony Brook University, where he taught for 42 years, retiring in 2014.[5] As a pianist, Winkler was the accompanist for Rhoda Levine's improvisational opera group, _Play it by Ear_ from 1996 to 2012, and appears with his wife, violinist Dorothea Cook, in the duo _Silken Rags._ Their CD of original works was described by the _Seattle Times_ as "a lovely and inventive disc of genre-bending compositions... rhythmically complex, harmonically rich music with influences extending from gospel and Caribbean to samba and tango.[6]" He was a pioneer in teaching university courses in popular music,[7] and was one of the founding members of the U.S. Branch of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music, editing its newsletter _RPM_ from 1984 to 1989 and its _Journal of Popular Music Studies_ from 1992 to 1995.
