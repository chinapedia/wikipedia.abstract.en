NATIONAL HIGHWAY 512 (NH 512) is a highway in the Indian state of West Bengal.[1] It runs from Gazole to Hili border with Bangladesh. On the other side of the border, the road continues as Hili-Birampur Highway.[2] Renumbered_National_Highways_map_of_India_(Schematic).jpg


Changeover

The Gazole-Hili stretch is shown both as part of State Highway 10 (West Bengal) and NH 512 in Google maps and other places. The West Bengal government, with the permission of the central government, has taken up the repair and maintenance of six major highways, which will eventually be raised to the status of a national highway. This includes the Gazole-Hili stretch.[3]


Route

Gajol - Daulatpur - Bansihari- Gangarampur - Harsura - Balurghat - Hilli (near Indo/Bangladesh Border).[4][5]
