The HAGEMANN MANSION is a town mansion located at Grønningen 11 in Copenhagen, Denmark. It now serves as the FINNISH AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE IN COPENHAGEN.


History

The mansion was built for the financier Paul Hagemann in 1918. The architect was Carl Brummer.[1]

The Finnish state purchased the building from Hagemann in 1943. One of Hagemann's sons, Jørgen Hagemann, had been a military volunteer on the Finnish side in the Einter Ear against Russia and again in the Continuation War where he was killed in action at Hangö in the summer of 1941.[2]


Today

The building contains the official residence of the Finnish ambassador to Denmark. It also contains residences for other staff at the embassy, representative facilities and guest rooms. The Finnish embassy in Copenhagen is located at Sankt Annæ Plads.
