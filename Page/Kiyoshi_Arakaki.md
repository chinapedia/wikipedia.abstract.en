Philosophy

Understand the original meaning of Okinawan Karate Kata and its names.

Spread Okinawan Karate and Okinawa Kobudo (Weapons).

Understand the correct thought and body movement of martial arts.

THE INNER PHYSICAL DYNAMIC SYSTEM (GAMAKU)

_Enabling Newton's Law of Motion (Force = Mass x Acceleration) to be applied to the Martial Arts using isolated core muscle movements and gravity to deliver the technique._

IMAGINARY CENTER OF GRAVITY (BALANCE IN UNBALANCE)

   _The Inner Physical Dynamic System applied. Using the principles of the Inner Physical Dynamic System you can concentrate the full force of your body weight into your technique. By using isolated muscles to shift your weight you can exert overwhelming force with minimal effort to be applied to a strike, kick, throw or to offset the opponent's center of balance regardless of size ratio._

WALKING IN THE MARTIAL ARTS (GRAVITY APPLIED)

   _Walking is free falling to your imaginary center of gravity. Applying this principle allows you to move in any direction without your initial movement being detected. By using gravity and "falling" into your attack you can deliver much faster and more powerful techniques with minimal effort._
