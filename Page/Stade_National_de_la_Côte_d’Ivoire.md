Stade Olympique d'Epimbé, nicknamed "Arc de Triomphe", will be a multi-purpose stadium, which can host football, rugby and athletics, in Ebimpé and Anyama, in northern Abidjan, Ivory Coast. It will be the national stadium of the Ivory Coast national football team. The stadium will have a capacity of 60,000 and will be built by the Beijing Institute Architectural Design. While the stadium itself will cover 20 hectares, a vast Olympic village is planned around it, spanning across 287 hectares.[1][2] The stadium was broke ground on December 22, 2016 by Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan, with the presence of a China Ambassy in Ivory Coast representative. It's expected to be built within 34 months and opened in 2019.[3][4]

With a capacity of more than 60,000 seats, Chinese engineers promise that the stadium is going to be one the biggest and most modern stadiums in Africa.

The stadium is expected to host the opening ceremony and final of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations.
