In Thailand, cannabis, known by the name _ganja_ (; ), is listed as a class-5 narcotic under the Narcotics Act, B.E. 2522 (1979).


History

Cannabis appears to have been introduced to Thailand from India, with the similarity of the Thai name to the Indian term _ganja_ cited as evidence.[1] Cannabis has historically been used in south-east Asia as an ingredient, a kitchen condiment, a medicine, and a source of fiber.[2]

Marijuana had been a traditional medicine for centuries before it was banned in the 1930s. Laborers were known to use it as a muscle relaxer. It was reportedly used to ease women's labor pains.[3]

The possession, sale, and use of cannabis was criminalised by the Cannabis Act, B.E. 2477 (1935).[4] The two most salient acts for practical purposes are the Narcotics Act 2522 (1979) and the Psychotropic Substances Act 2518 (1975).[5]


Regulation

Penalties

Possession, cultivation, and transport (import/export) of up to of cannabis may result in a maximum sentence of five years in prison and/or a fine. Possession, cultivation, and transport of more than 10 kg is punishable by 2 to 15 years in prison and/or a fine. For the majority of people arrested for simple possession of small quantities of cannabis a fine, rather than prison time, is imposed. Narcotics police in Thailand view methamphetamine (; ) as a more serious issue.[6]

-   From 2 to 10 years' imprisonment or a fine of 40,000–100,000 baht or both for disposal or possession for the purpose of disposal.
-   Imprisonment not exceeding five years and or a fine not exceeding 100,000 baht or both for possession.
-   Imprisonment not exceeding one year and a fine of 100,000 to 1 million baht for consumption.[7]

Enforcement

Cannabis can be found openly sold in bars and restaurants in certain parts of the country.[8] In tourist heavy areas cannabis is commonly found, businesses openly sell "happy" goods which have cannabis in them. Cannabis dealers sometimes work with police who shakedown customers and demand a bribe. Many tourists do end up in jail despite the relaxed attitude.[9]

Medical Cannabis

Legislation to legalise medical cannabis was approved by the parliament on December 26, 2018, making it the first Southeast Asian nation to do so.[10]
