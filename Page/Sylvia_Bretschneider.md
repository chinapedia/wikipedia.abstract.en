Early life and career

Sylvia Bretschneider was born on 14 November 1960 in Waren (Müritz), a small town located between Rostock and Berlin. She attended school locally, successfully completing her Abitur in 1979.[1] Between 1979 and 1983 she studied at the institute of Theoretical and Applied Language Sciences at Leipzig University, then called Karl Marx University, graduating with a teaching degree in the English and German languages. She worked as a teacher in Neubrandenburg between 1983 and 1989. In 1989 she switched careers, working for a year in a senior administrative position with the bus and transport company in her home town. She then worked from 1990 to 1994 at the Neubrandenburg Education Department.[2]


Political career

During the GDR years, Bretschneider was not a member of the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) nor of any other political party. During the _Wende_ – the months of massive political change that followed the breaching by protesters of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 – she joined the moderately left-wing Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). She served as a member of the party's regional executive from 1991 to 2003, becoming deputy chair in 1998 or 1999.[3][4]

In 1994, she was elected to the Landtag of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the state parliament of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.[5] Between 1994 and October 2002, she served as her party's speaker on education, youth policies and culture.[6] In 2002, she was elected president of the Landtag, a position she continued to hold until her withdrawal from office.[7] She was most recently re-elected in October 2016, receiving the votes of 45 of the chamber's 71 members.[8] She was elected Speaker of Parliament (_Landtagspräsidentin_) in 2002.[9][10]

Bretschneider withdrew from her offices in 2017 for cancer treatment.[11]


Personal life

Bretschneider was married; she and her husband had three daughters.[12]

She died of cancer on 28 April 2019 in Neubrandenburg at the age of 58.[13][14]
