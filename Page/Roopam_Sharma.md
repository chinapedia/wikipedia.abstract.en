Early life, education and research

Roopam was born on May 24, 1995 in Faridabad, Haryana, India to Nirmal and Krishna Dutt Sharma. He has a brother Rahul and a sister Priyanka. Roopam comes from a very humble, middle-class family. He is an alumnus of Ryan International School, Faridabad and Modern Vidya Niketan, Faridabad and went on to study Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering at Manav Rachna University in Faridabad, Haryana. It wasn’t out of any of his creative desires that he chose Engineering. He and his parents thought that engineering was one career where he would not starve. Roopam began his research and innovation journey during his sophomore year of undergraduate school at Manav Rachna University with a belief that students who worked in research and development in college got better job opportunities but destiny had other plans for him. Roopam's contributions to the society proves that he innovates for the betterment of the society.[5]


Inventions

Roopam's project Manovue, developed by Eyeluminati, which is the world's first intelligent personal assisting system for the visually impaired.[6][7][8] It's an inexpensive technology that does 3 main things:

2.  It helps them to navigate freely outside well known environment through haptic feedback.
3.  It comes with a completely voice controlled mobile phone application and enables the user to use his phone only through his voice.

Manovue brings employ ability, Independence and Empowerment to the visually impaired and is meant to replace the braille language, the cane and will open up the smartphone market to the visually impaired. Manovue was awarded as the winner of the Microsoft Imagine Cup 2015[9] and Yahoo Accenture Innovation Jockeys season 4.[10][11][12] He was listed on the MIT Tech Review 35 under 35 list in 2016.[13]
