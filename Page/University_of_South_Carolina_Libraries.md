Main Library

Thomas Cooper Library

The Thomas Cooper Library is the University's main library. The facility opened in 1959 as a dedicated undergraduate library, the first such library in the South. The building was designed by Edward Durell Stone, the designer of the Kennedy Center, and the firm of Lyles, Bissett, Carlisle, and Wolff. The building was executed in a modernist design primarily of white marble. Taking its current form in 1976, the 289,000 sq ft facility houses the general collection on 45 miles of shelves. The library consists of seven levels, four underground and three above including a mezzanine level. In addition to housing books the library contains numerous study carrels, collaboration rooms, classrooms, and computer facilities. In the Technology Lounge students can check out tech devices such as laptops and tablets as well as access specialized software. The facility is open 24/7 to students.

The library's general collection consists of items that have always been in the collection as well as items that were at one point housed in separate locations. For example, the science collection and the education collection were consolidated into the general collection from their original separate locations. The library also home to government resources such as the Government and Maps collection which contains US federal government and European Union documents. In addition the Scholar Commons serves as an institutional repository of scholarly work.[3] As the main research library the facility is home to numerous research resources such as journals, articles and databases, and hands on guidance from librarians and research specialists.

South Caroliniana Library

The South Caroliniana Library is located on the university's Historic Horseshoe. Begun in 1838 and completed in 1840, the Robert Mills-designed building was the first free standing college library in the country. Mills used the reading room of the Library of Congress that housed Thomas Jefferson's collection as the basis for his design.[10] University_of_South_Carolina,_Library,_South_Sumter_Street,_Columbia_(Richland_County,_South_Carolina).jpg The library served as the university's main library until 1940 with the completion of the, now, McKissick Museum.
