The 39TH CURTIS CUP MATCH was played from 10 to 12 June 2016 at Dun Laoghaire Golf Club near Enniskerry, Ireland. Great Britain and Ireland won 11½ to 8½. Bronte Law became the first golfer from Great Britain and Ireland to win 5 matches in a Curtis Cup match, a feat only previously achieved by Stacy Lewis in 2008.[1]


Format

The contest was a three-day competition, with three foursomes and three fourball matches on each of the first two days, and eight singles matches on the final day, a total of 20 points.

Each of the 20 matches is worth one point in the larger team competition. If a match is all square after the 18th hole extra holes are not played. Rather, each side earns ½ a point toward their team total. The team that accumulates at least 10½ points wins the competition. In the event of a tie, the current holder retains the Cup.


Teams

Eight players for the Great Britain & Ireland and USA participated in the event plus one non-playing captain for each team.

Six members of the Great Britain & Ireland team were selected automatically, the top four in the World Amateur Golf Ranking (WAGR) as of 27 April 2016 and the leading two players in the LGU’s Order of Merit not selected from the WAGR. The remaining two were picked by the LGU Selection Panel.[2]
