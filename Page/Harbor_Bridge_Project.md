The HARBOR BRIDGE PROJECT (or NEW HARBOR BRIDGE) is an $802.9 million project to replace the existing through arch bridge that crosses the Corpus Christi Ship Channel which serves the Port of Corpus Christi with a modern cable-stayed bridge design. The route will connect with SH 286 (the Crosstown Expressway) at its southern terminus, and US 181 on the north. Groundbreaking on construction took place on August 8, 2016 and is on schedule to be completed by the spring of 2020.
