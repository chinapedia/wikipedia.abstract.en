HYMIE’S VINTAGE RECORDS (also known as just HYMIE’S RECORDS) is a vinyl record store in Minneapolis, Minnesota.


History

Hymie's was opened in 1988 by James “Hymie” Peterson[1] on Lake Street in Minneapolis. The store has carried exclusively analog audio media for most of its life. In 2010 the store relocated five blocks east to a new location.[2] The Hymie's Blog began in October 2009, and has posted nearly every day about interesting or unusual records, local music reviews and local music events. Since 2009, Hymie’s has had a shop dog, a Boston Terrier named Irene,[3] who has become an icon for the store. Irene has been photographed by Rolling Stone, and also appeared on popular T-shirts and as Miss June in a charity calendar. Hymie’s has been singled out as one of the best record stores in the United States by _Rolling Ston_e[4] and _USA Today_, and has been featured in many other publications.


Hymie's Label

The 2003 LP _Hymie’s Basement_ was recorded in the basement of the original record store and released by Lex Records. In 2014 the store launched its own record label with a single by Brian Laidlaw and the Family Trade and, simultaneously, the eighth album by Ben Weaver, _I Would Rather Be a Buffalo_.[5]
