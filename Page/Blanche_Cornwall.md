Blanche_Cornwall_-_The_Motion_Picture_Story_Magazine,_September_1912.jpg'' (September 1912).]] BLANCHE CORNWALL (April 24, 1868, New York City – December 20, 1918), was an American silent film and stage actress. She was particularly active between 1911 and 1914 as one of the leading stars in Solax Studios films directed by Alice Guy-Blaché. Before 1911, she was part of The Shubert Organization and made a success playing in theatrical adaptations of _Charlotte Temple_ and _David Copperfield_.[1]

In 1918, in a letter to the editor of the _Motion Picture Magazine_, a fan evoked Blanche Cornwall as a delightful "reminiscence" and a forgotten "old star."[2]

Before becoming an actress, Cornwall was a public school teacher. She was married to a naval officer.[3]

In her later years, Cornwall was active with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Then known as BLANCHE PENNINGTON, she was director of the WCTU's Department of Nonalcoholic Fruit Products.[4]
