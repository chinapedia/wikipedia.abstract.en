GOTLAND MILITARY COMMAND (, MKG) previously VII MILITARY AREA () was a Swedish military area, and later a command in the Swedish Armed Forces. It existed between the years 1942 and 2000. The staff of the military area was located within Gotland Garrison in Visby on Gotland.


History

Gotland Military Command was established on 1 October 1942 as the VII Military Area (_VII. militärområdet_)[1] and was commanded by a military commander which had the responsibility of the territorial and land operational task. In 1966 the name was changed to Gotland Military Command and was included as a command in the Eastern Military Area (Milo Ö). This was done in accordance with the new model in which Gotland was too small for a military area.[2] Simultaneously, the operational tasks of the commanders of the naval commands and destroyer squadrons were given to the military commander, which meant that the military commander had full responsibility for the overall operational management of all military forces within the military area.[3]

In 1991, Gotland Military Command became a part of the newly formed Middle Military Area (Milo M), but remained as a staff until the Defence Act of 2000, when the staff was phased out and replaced in part by the Gotland Military District (MD G).
