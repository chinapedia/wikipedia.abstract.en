VELOMETRO MOBILITY, Inc. is an electric velomobile manufacturer and vehicle sharing service provider based out of Vancouver, Canada. The company rents enclosed, electric-assisted velomobiles, called a VEEMO, in a one-way, dockless sharing model with rates by the minute. The vehicles do not require a driver’s licence to ride and can be operated on bicycle paths as well as standard roadways.[1]


History

VeloMetro was co-founded in 2014 by Kody Baker, Sean Boyd, and Jonathan Faille of Perkuna Engineering, along with entrepreneur John Stonier.[2] The first prototype vehicle was built in 2014 and they first unveiled their Veemo vehicle at the BC Tech Summit in 2016.[3] The first pilot fleet started at the University of British Columbia in late 2017.[4] The pilot program of 5 vehicles was made available to the public in February 2018.[5][6] The pilot concluded in April 2018.[7]


Vehicle

The Veemo is a single person, pedal-electric hybrid vehicle which is regulated as an electric bicycle to a top speed of 32 km/h (20 mph) and power limit of 500 watts in Canada.[8] The vehicle weighs 120 kg (265 lbs) and is capable of climbing hills of up to a 20% grade.[9] It is fully enclosed and has sufficient storage space to hold a full-sized overhead baggage suitcase. The internal battery is replenished through a solar panel and battery swapping.[10] Veemo_Exterior.jpg Veemo_Interior.jpg


Veemo Service

Veemo is similar to car2go, providing a one way fleet sharing service accessible through a website or a smartphone app. Members do not need a driver's license and can register and start using the vehicles immediately. Riders pay by-the-minute rates and can park the vehicles in any valid parking spot within the designated home zone, which are indicated in an in-dash display.[11]
