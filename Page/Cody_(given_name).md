CODY is a surname and unisex given name. It may also be spelled Coddy, Codee, Codi, Codie, Codey, Kodi, Kodie, Kody, Coty, or Koty.

According to _A Dictionary of First Names_, Cody is "a transferred use of the Irish surname, an Anglicized form of Gaelic O'Cuidighthigh 'descendant of Cuidightheach' (originally a byname for a HELPFUL PERSON), or of Mac Oda 'son of Oda' (a personal name of uncertain origin)."[1] Its use in the United States is partially due to it being the surname of Buffalo Bill, a.k.a. William Frederick Cody.[2] People with the given name Cody include:
