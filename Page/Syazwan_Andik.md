Kuala Lumpur

Johor Darul Ta'zim

In 2019, Syazwan's contract with Kuala Lumpur FA was not supposed to be terminated but the Skudai-born decided to leave with a termination of contract as the club failed to settle his salary for over two months in 2018.[2] The termination of contract was permissible as there is a clause in their contracts stating that players can decide to leave and make their own path with other clubs, without having to discuss between clubs, if the current club did not manage to pay for more than a month.[3]

Syazwan made his debut for Malaysia senior team on 1 April 2018 against Bhutan coming off the bench for Mahali Jasuli.
