The song is a special project between Era FM and Raku, a music streaming service under Astro. It was composed specifically as a tribute to Siti Nurhaliza for her achievements in the Malaysian music industry for more than 20 years.[1] Co-written by Faizal Tahir, the song is only available for listening on Era FM and Raku.

Although the song serves as a tribute to Siti, she performed the song herself at Anugerah MeleTOP Era 2016 on 28 February 2016.


Background and recording

The song began as a special project by Era FM and Raku who were looking for ways to celebrate Siti Nurhaliza's 20th year in the music industry.[2] After much deliberation, Era FM and Raku's content managers, Nazri Noran and Rithan decided that they should celebrate the occasion by giving Siti a special tribute song.[3]

According to Nazri, while they were looking for music composers, Faizal Tahir eagerly volunteered to compose the music and the lyrics himself.[4] He messaged Nazri at 3 a.m when he heard that Nazri is looking for music composers to write a tribute song.[5] Nazri agreed to Faizal's request and he asked him to provide a demo in which Faizal composed both lyrics and music for "Inspirasi" in a matter of hours.[6] Upon hearing the demo, Nazri decided that they will use Faizal's composition as the tribute since "Faizal really had Siti in his mind when he made the song. And it came from [his] heart."[7]

In the final version of the song, Mike Chan helped to compose the song and they invited Hafiz Suip to provide the main vocals with Faizal provided the featuring vocals himself.[8][9] According to Era FM, to have Hafiz singing the song is the perfect choice since "Hafiz and Faizal Tahir really want to do something for someone who they have taken as an example in the entertainment industry."[10]
