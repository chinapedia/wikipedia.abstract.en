[2] A total of six teams played in the tournament. The top two teams of the tournament - United States and Canada - qualified for the 2008 Summer Olympics women's football tournament in Beijing, China as the CONCACAF representatives.[3]

Knockout stage

In the knockout stage, if a match is level at the end of regular time (two periods of 45 minutes), extra time is played (two periods of 15 minutes) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner. In the case of the third place match, as it is played just before the final, extra time is skipped and a penalty shoot-out takes place.
