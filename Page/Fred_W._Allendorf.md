FREDERICK WILLIAM ALLENDORF (born April 29, 1947) is Regents Professor of Biology Emeritus at the University of Montana. He has published widely on the topics of population genetics and conservation biology.[1][2] Among other organisms, Allendorf has written extensively about salmon.[3]

Before he was a scientist, Allendorf served in the U.S. Army from 1965–1968 during the Vietnam War.[4] Allendorf received his Bachelors in Zoology in 1971 from Penn State University.[5] He then went on to receive his Masters in Fisheries in 1973 and his PhD in Fisheries and Genetics in 1975, both from the University of Washington.[6] After he received his PhD he was a postdoctoral scholar at Aarhus University in Denmark under Freddy Christiansen and was later a NATO Research Fellow at the University of Nottingham in England under Bryan Clarke.[7] In 1987, Allendorf was elected as a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.[8] In 1992, he was elected president of the American Genetic Association.[9]

In 2014, Allendorf experienced an avalanche that destroyed his home and took his wife’s life.[10] A year later, he received the 2015 Molecular Ecology Prize for his contributions to the fields of conservation genetics and molecular ecology.[11]
