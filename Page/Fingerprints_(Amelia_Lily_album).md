_FINGERPRINTS_ is the second cancelled studio album by British singer Amelia Lily. It was never released following the lead single California not doing so well in the charts. After the cancellation of Lilys' original debut album "Be A Fighter" in 2013, Lily attempted to start fresh with a new sound and new record deal with Warner Music.


Background

Production on _FINGERPRINTS_ began in late 2013 to mid-2014 after Lily decided her original debut album "Be A Fighter" was not good enough to release. The lead single from "Fingerprints", California was released on 7 September 2014 and peaked at 83 on the UK Singles Chart


Singles

California. The single was released via East West Records after Lily signed a new record deal with the label in April 2014. The singer departed Sony Music and Xenomania following the catastrophic handling of her original debut album, which was scrapped and remains unreleased. Lily said of the track, "Life has never been so exciting - I've been busy in the studio writing and recording songs for my upcoming debut album, and 'California' is where we start. I'm so proud to be releasing this music; I have put my heart and soul into writing them. Expect a few surprises along the way though - it's going to be fun!".[1] In an interview with the _Metro_, Lily revealed that the song was about a long distance relationship between a male and female who are constantly flying between London and Los Angeles and keep passing each other. She refused to say whether or not it had anything to do with her relationship with Adam Pitts of Lawson, whom she previously dated.[2]
