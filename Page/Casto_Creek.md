The stream flows south roughly paralleling Missouri Route B then turns to the southwest west of the community of Mount Zion. The stream continues to the southwest meeting its confluence with Cowskin Creek just north of Missouri Route 14 about three miles west of Ava.[2]

Casto Creek has the name of the local Casto family which settled near it.[3]
