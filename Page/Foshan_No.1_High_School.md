History

Qing Dynasty (1853-1911)

钟楼与旧教学楼.JPG In 1853, the South China diocese of British Methodist Church established its first church and an affiliated school in Guangzhou. After that, several schools were established by the church in Guangdong. In 1909, Rev. S. George Tope, a priest of the church purchased 20 acres of land in Wenchangsha, Foshan for school establishment.

Republic of China （1911-1949）

In 1912, the Methodist Church began to establish a school on the purchased land. In 1913, the construction was completed. The first principal was Rev. James Richard. In memory of Dr. Haigh's contribution to Chinese Education, the school was first named "Haigh College". Soon after its opening, the name was changed into "Wa Ying Middle School" (華英中學), which indicates that the school represents a combination of Chinese and British Education (in Chinese, "Wa"華 means China and "Ying"英 means Britain). At the time, the school recruited male students only.

In 1920, Rev. Arthur H. Bray (黎伯廉), the second principal of Wa Ying Middle School, raised money for expanding the school and building a new school recruiting female students. The new girl school was established in 1923.

During the World War II, the school underwent significant changes. The boy school and the girl school were combined due to the shortage of schoolhouses. In order to avoid the Japanese invaders, the school has moved to several places including Hong Kong, which laid a foundation for the establishment of Hong Kong-based Wa Ying College (華英中學) in 1969. After the war, Wa Ying Middle School moved back to its original site in Wenchangsha, Foshan and re-opened in November 1946.

People's Republic of China (1949-today)

After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Wa Ying Middle School was confiscated by the government and transformed into the current public school "No.1 Middle School of Foshan". At first, the school was a public junior and senior high school with students from grade 7 to 12. In 1999, the junior high school department was separated from the school and became an independent junior high school called Foshan Huaying School. Since then, Foshan No.1 High School has only had students from grade 10-12 （except for Tibetan Department）.

In October 1995, the school was assigned to open a Junior High School Department of Tibetan Students (also called Tibetan Department) by MOE.[1] Students recruited from Tibet attend the school during grade 7-9.

On December 8, 2013, the school celebrated its 100th anniversary. FSYZ_Gate_-_100th.jpg
