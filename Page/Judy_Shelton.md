JUDY SHELTON is an economic advisor to President Donald Trump.[1] She is known for her advocacy for a return to the gold standard (which is dismissed by almost all mainstream economists) and for her criticisms of the Federal Reserve.[2][3][4] Trump announced on July 2, 2019, that he would nominate Shelton to the Fed.[5]


Early life and education

Shelton attended Portland State University, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science in Education.[6] Shelton also holds a MBA and Ph.D in business administration from the University of Utah.[7][8][9]


Politics

She worked at the Hoover Institution from 1985 to 1995.[10] She was on Bob Dole’s 1996 presidential campaign.[11] In 2016, she was on the Ben Carson presidential campaign, but joined the Trump campaign in August 2016 after writing a supportive _Wall Street Journal_ opinion editorial about Trump.[12]

Prior to joining the Trump administration, she was the director of the Sound Money Project[13] at the Atlas Network. She has donated to conservative candidates and causes.[14]

In 2000, she advocated for open borders with Mexico.[15]

During the Obama years, she criticized the Federal Reserve’s low interest rates.[16][17][18] During the Trump presidency, she advocated for the Federal Reserve to adopt lower interest rates as a form of economic stimulus. (Trump frequently criticized the Federal Reserve for not lowering interest rates.)[19][20][21] She supports the Republican Party's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the Trump administration's deregulative agenda.[22] Before Trump became president, she was a longtime advocate for free trade, but after he became president, she supported his administration's trade war with China.[23][24]

In March 2018, she was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as the United States director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.[25][26]

On July 3, 2019, President Donald Trump used his Twitter account to announce his intention to nominate Shelton and a regional Fed official, Christopher Waller, to the Federal Reserve board. His previous nominees, former presidential contender Herman Cain and economic commentator Stephen Moore, had withdrawn for lack of Senate support.[27][28] During the months in which Shelton was being considered for the post by Trump, she was a guest at Trump's D.C. hotel.[29]

Shelton is known as a critic of the Federal Reserve.[30][31]

In 2019, she said that she hoped for a new Bretton Woods-style conference where countries would agree to return to the gold standard, saying, "If it takes place at Mar-a-Lago that would be great."[32] Mar-a-Lago is a club run by President Trump.


Personal life

Shelton is married to Gilbert Shelton.[33] The Sheltons had eleven French Charolais cattle, six dogs and peacocks as of 2009.[34] Her husband is a former entrepreneurial banker in Utah, Colorado, and Hawaii who sold the businesses in the early 1980s. They have lived at Moss Neck Manor, a historic antebellum plantation house in Virginia, since 2005. The property borders Fort A.P. Hill.[35][36]
