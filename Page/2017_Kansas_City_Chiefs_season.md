The 2017 KANSAS CITY CHIEFS SEASON was the franchise's 48th season in the National Football League, the 55th as the Kansas City Chiefs, the 58th overall, the fifth under head coach Andy Reid, and first under general manager Brett Veach.


Season notes

General manager John Dorsey was fired on June 22, 2017.[1] On July 10, the Chiefs promoted co-director of player personnel Brett Veach to general manager.[2] The only other personnel change for the Chiefs that occurred was co-offensive coordinator Brad Childress was promoted to assistant head coach, leaving Matt Nagy as the only offensive coordinator. The Chiefs most notable transaction of the off-season came when they released all-time leading rusher Jamaal Charles after 9 seasons. After being released, Charles signed with the Chiefs division rival, the Denver Broncos.

Following the Atlanta Falcons 17–23 loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 4, the Chiefs became the last undefeated team left in the NFL for the 4th time in team history, and the 2nd time under Andy Reid, with the previous times being in 2003, 2010, and 2013. After their 5–0 start, the Chiefs lost 6 of their next 7 games, the lone win coming against the Broncos. During this stretch, the Chiefs offense struggled, leading to head coach Andy Reid giving play calling duties during games to offensive coordinator Matt Nagy.

After four straight losses, the Chiefs won three straight games to win the AFC West for the second consecutive season. It was the first time in franchise history that the Chiefs have won back-to-back division titles. It also marked the Chiefs qualifying for the playoffs three consecutive seasons, which they have not done since they made six consecutive playoff appearances from 1990 to 1995.[3] They finished the season with a 10–6 record, earning the AFC's fourth seed in the playoffs. In the Wild Card Round, they would lose to the Tennessee Titans 22-21. In the game, the Chiefs had a commanding 21-3 lead at halftime, but failed to score a single point in the second half. The loss extended their NFL record six straight home playoff losses.[4] It was the second time under Andy Reid they lost a playoff game after being up by more than 10 points at halftime. The Chiefs have lost 3 consecutive playoff games, and have lost 11 of their last 12. The Chiefs first two wins of the season came against teams that eventually meet in Super Bowl LII to end the season. the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles. Additionally by beating the Patriots in week 1, the Chiefs extending their winning streak against the defending Super Bowl champs to six (including both times they beat the Broncos the season after they won the Super Bowl).

AFC Wild Card Playoffs: vs. (#5) Tennessee Titans

For the first round of the playoffs, the Chiefs played the Tennessee Titans at home. The Chiefs entered the game looking to win their first home playoff game since 1994, a streak of 5 straight home playoff losses. The Chiefs had a strong first half, building a 21-3 halftime lead and sending the home crowd into a frenzy. However, the Titans were able to catch fire, with a batted down touchdown pass from Marcus Mariota to himself, to make the score 21-10. The Chiefs were not able to recover after this touchdown, and the Titans outscored Kansas City 19-0 in the second half to win 22-21. The Chiefs, looked as though they had taken the lead on a fumble by Derrick Henry. However, the turnover was reviewed, and upon review, the call was overturned and Tennessee kept the ball. Derrick Henry was then able to run for a first down on third down to seal the game. With the loss, the Chiefs ended their season at 10-7 and lost 6 straight home playoff games, the worst in NFL history.
