NEIL OCAMPO is a Filipino radio broadcaster. He was lastly the anchor of the program "Todo Arangkada Balita" (combined names of his two former programs in DZMM, Radyo5 and DZRH) from Monday to Friday at 8:00am to 10:00am (UTC+08:00) on DZRJ 810 AM Radyo Bandido under the 8TriMedia programming block.


Career

Ocampo was born and raised in Plaridel, Quezon. He started his broadcast career on DZXL in 1980 while studying engineering courses at the FEATI University.[1] He then moved to DZMM after the 1986 People Power Revolution. He worked for 24 years as an anchor and reporter with the designation as Radyo Patrol #5. He first handled the evening program "Oh Yes, It's Neil Ocampo!" in the 1990s and later Todo Balita that aired every 5:00 a.m. from 2001 to 2009 . He is known for his voice impersonations of different sought-after politicians and personalities including Jejemon Tonyo, Tongressman Atras Abante, Kiskis Flavor and Pareng Erap, and his long morning greeting introduction at the start of the program.[2]

In late 2009, Ocampo announced his intention to run for Mayor of Marilao, Bulacan in the 2010 national elections,[3] but lost in the poll counting. On November 8, 2010, he transferred from DZMM to Radyo Singko 92.3 News FM as the anchor of the revived Todo Balita. Prior to his decision to move to the station shortly after his loss in the mayoral bid, the management of DZMM suggested Ocampo a program from 3:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. serving as a lead-in to the returning Noli de Castro and his show Kabayan after serving as Vice President of the Philippines but he personally declined the offer, hence his transfer.[4]

In May 2013, Ocampo transferred to DZRH as the anchor of morning news program Arangkada Balita until 2015 when he underwent an indefinite leave from the job. On November 7, 2016, he returned to the airwaves as anchor of the program "Todo Arangkada Balita", where he introduced two new voice impersonations imitating President Rodrigo Duterte (Dugong Diokterte) and PNP Chief Ronald dela Rosa (Gen. Bato-Bato Pik).[5] 8TriMedia initially planned to move Ocampo by December 2016 to the 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. to compete against two primetime TV newscasts who are simulcast on their own radio stations, [6] but plans never materialized. His stint on DZRJ lasted until December 5, 2017 when 8TriMedia was axed from the station's brokerage agreement due to the firm's unpaid debts. The show was not part of the absorption of the majority of 8TriMedia shows and personnel by DZRJ.
