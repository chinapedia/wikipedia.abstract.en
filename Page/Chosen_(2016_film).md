Reviews

Phil Hoad from _The Guardian_ believes that the film is unfocused and only scratches the surface.[7]

Isabelle Milton thinks that the movie shows the brutality the Hungarian Jews had to face towards the end of the Second World War, but has nothing new to offer. She also mentions that during the movie the soundtrack is played distractingly at inappropriate moments. Furthermore she thinks that the character development is thin.[8]

Rizaya Reviews thinks that there are several screenplay problems in the movie like plot-holes, clich√© bookend sequences and familiarity to the narrative. However she also thinks that it features enough competent filmmaking to forgive these kinds of mistakes.[9]
