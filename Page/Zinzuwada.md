History

According to a legend the town was founded by Zunzo Rabari. He had advised Mayanalla Devi, wife of Chaulukya ruler Karna, to take blessings from a hermit living on an island in the Rann of Kutch. She later gave birth to Jayasimha Siddharaja who named the place where he lived as Zinzuwada after him.[1][2]

The core town is surrounded by 11th century fort built during the rule of Chaulukya dynasty.[3] There are inscriptions on the walls of the fort ascribed to Udayana, a minister of Jayasimha Siddharaja.

It was a non-salute princely state on Saurashtra peninsula during British Raj. The princely state in Jhalawar prant was ruled by Kshatriya Koli Chieftains's Thakors of Jhala dynasty.[4] In 1901, it comprised 18 villages, covering 165 square miles, with a population of 11,732, yielding 73,343 Rupees state revenue (1903-4, mostly from land), paying 11,075 Rupees tribute to the British.[5][6]
