JUNIORE is a French indie pop band formed in Paris in 2013.[1] The group is led by singer/songwriter Anna Jean,[2] daughter of French writer J.M.G. Le Clézio.[3] The band's musical style is influenced by the music of the 1960s;[4] the website AllMusic describes their music as mixing "modern indie pop sensibilities with elements of retro French pop, dark, twangy surf guitar, and a vocal style that falls somewhere between Cat Power and Françoise Hardy."[5] Jean had previously appeared in the duo Domingo and featured on the Bot’Ox track "Blue Steel".[6] The band's debut album, _Ouh là là_, is released on Le Phonographe, a label that Jean founded with Samy Osta, who is also the producer of albums by La Femme and Feu! Chatterton.[7]
