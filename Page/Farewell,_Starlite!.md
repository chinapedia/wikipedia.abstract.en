Critical reception

Ben Beaumont-Thomas of _The Guardian_ gave the album 4 stars out of 5 and called it "fleet-footed modern pop with just the right amount of whimsy."[6] Cameron Cook of _Pitchfork_ gave the album a 6.4 out of 10, writing, "While _Farewell, Starlite!_ has its share of engaging moments, it's a shame that under all its technical flairs, its overall mood isn't gripping enough to do justice to its creator's vision."[7]

_The Fader_ named it one of the "24 Albums That Made Albums Matter Again in 2016".[8] _The A.V. Club_ named it one of the albums of the year.[9]
