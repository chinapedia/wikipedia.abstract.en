ALCIDAMAS (), of Elaea, in Aeolis, Greek sophist and rhetorician, flourished in the 4th century BC.


Life

He was the pupil and successor of Gorgias and taught at Athens at the same time as Isocrates, to whom he was a rival and opponent. We possess two declamations under his name: _On Sophists_ (Περὶ Σοφιστῶν), directed against Isocrates and setting forth the superiority of extempore over written speeches (a more recently discovered fragment of another speech against Isocrates is probably of later date); _Odysseus_ (perhaps spurious)[1] in which Odysseus accuses Palamedes of treachery during the siege of Troy.

According to Alcidamas, the highest aim of the orator was the power of speaking _extempore_ on every conceivable subject. Aristotle (_Rhet._ iii. 3) criticizes his writings as characterized by pomposity of style and an extravagant use of poetical epithets and compounds and far-fetched metaphors.

Of other works only fragments and the titles have survived: _Messeniakos_, advocating the freedom of the Messenians and containing the sentiment that "God has left all men free; nature has made no man a slave";[2][3] a _Eulogy of Death_, in consideration of the wide extent of human sufferings; a _Techne_ or instruction-book in the art of rhetoric; and a _Phusikos logos_. Lastly, his _Mouseion_ (a word invoking the Muses) seems to have contained the narrative of the _Contest of Homer and Hesiod_, of which the version that has survived is the work of a grammarian in the time of Hadrian, based on Alcidamas. This hypothesis of the contents of the _Mouseion_, originally suggested by Nietzsche (_Rheinisches Museum_ 25 (1870) & 28 (1873)), appears to have been confirmed by three papyrus findsone 3rd century BC (_Flinders Petrie Papyri_, ed. Mahaffy, 1891, pl. xxv.), one 2nd century BC (Basil Mandilaras, 'A new papyrus fragment of the _Certamen Homeri et Hesiodi_' _Platon_ 42 (1990) 45–51) and one 2nd or 3rd century AD (University of Michigan pap. 2754: Winter, J. G., 'A New Fragment on the Life of Homer' _TAPA_ 56 (1925) 120–129 1).
