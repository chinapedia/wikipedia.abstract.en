It developed between about 1850 and 1940, and included representative examples of Renaissance Revival style architecture. The primary building is the Bank of the State of Missouri (1859).[1] Most of the remaining buildings were demolished in 1973.[2]

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and delisted in 1999.[3] The six remaining buildings in the district were subsumed under the Missouri Valley Trust Company Historic District.
