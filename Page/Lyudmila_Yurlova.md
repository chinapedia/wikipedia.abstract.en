LYUDMILA PETROVNA YURLOVA (, 1 April 1972 â€“ 28 November 2016) was a Russian ice hockey forward. She was part of the national teams that won a silver medal at the 1996 European Championships and a bronze at the 2001 World Championships.[1][2][3]

Yurlova started as a bandy player for _Burevestnik_ Arkhangelsk and _Octyabr_ Moscow and won the national title with _Oktyabr_. In 1993 she changed to ice hockey, and won eight national titles with _SKIF_, which was then based in Moscow. She died in her sleep, after her automatic washing machine ignited while being operated overnight. The released smoke suffocated her, together with her husband and a four-year-old son.[4][5][6]
