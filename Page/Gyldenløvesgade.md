It runs from Farimagsgade in the south east to a Y junction at the western side of The Lakes, linking Jorcks Plads with Aaboulevard and Rosenørns Allé. The last section of the street runs on an embankment which separates Peblinge Lake to the north from St. Jørgen's Lake to the south. The Lake Pavilion overlooks Peblinge Lake on the north side of the street.


History

Klampenborgbanegården_fugleperspektiv.jpg Gyldenløvesgade_-_telephone_kiosks.jpg's telephone kiosks]] Gyldenløvesgade_c._1930.jpg Gyldenløvesgade replaced the old Ladegårdsvej to Ladegården. It was proposed in the 1872 Development Plan for the Fortification Ring.[1] It provided a new link between the city centre and the fast-growing Frederiksberg and Nørrebro districts. It received its name after Ulrik Christian Gyldenløve.[2] The railway tracks of the new railway line to Klampenborg opened at the street in 1863. A new Central Station opened next to it in 1864. The railway continued across the embankment between Peblinge Lake and St. Jørgen's Lake. The current Gyldenløvesgade was created when the stations were replaced by the current Copenhagen Central Station in 1911.[3]

Jørn Utzon created a proposal for an indoor swimming venue at the Peblinge Lake in 1979 but it was never realized.[4]
