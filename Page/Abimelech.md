ABIMELECH (also spelled ABIMELEK or AVIMELECH; ) was the name of multiple Philistine kings mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.


Etymology

The name or title _Abimelech_ is formed from Hebrew words for "father" and "king," and may be interpreted in a variety of ways, including "Father-King", "My father is king," or "Father of a king."[1] In the Pentateuch, it is used as a title for kings in the land of Canaan.[2]

At the time of the Amarna tablets (mid-14th century BC), there was an Egyptian governor of Tyre similarly named Abimilki, who is sometimes speculated to be connected with one or more of the biblical Abimelechs.


Abimelech of Gerar

Abimelech was most prominently the name of a polytheistic[3][4] king of Gerar who is mentioned in two of the three wife-sister narratives in Genesis, in connection with both Abraham (chap. 20) and Isaac (chap. 26).

King Abimelech of Gerar also appears in an extra-biblical tradition recounted in texts such as the _Kitab al-Magall_, the _Cave of Treasures_ and the _Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan_, as one of 12 regional kings in Abraham's time said to have built the city of Jerusalem for Melchizedek.
