History

Risk Capital Holdings, Inc. was formed in Delaware in March 1995 and commenced operations in September 1995, after an initial public offering.

In May 2000, Risk Capital Holdings sold substantially all of the reinsurance operations of Risk Capital Reinsurance Co., its wholly owned subsidiary, to Folksamerica Reinsurance Co., and at the same time announced it was changing its name to Arch Capital Group Ltd.[3][4]

Arch Mortgage Guaranty began operations in 2015 and, in August 2016, it bought United Guaranty, AIG‘s mortgage insurance unit, for US$3.4 billion,[5] making ACGL the world’s largest mortgage insurer.[6]
