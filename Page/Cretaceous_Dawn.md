_CRETACEOUS DAWN_ is a science-fiction novel by sibling scientists Lisa M. Graziano and Michael S. A. Graziano, published in 2008 by Leapfrog Press (initially published as 'HELL CREEK: 65 MILLION YEARS IN THE PAST, THE JOURNEY BEGINS' under Trafford Publishing in 2006. The book contains 304 pages. Its story is set to a modern time and also to the prehistory of 65 million years ago (at the end of the Cretaceous era). It starts in the physics laboratory, where long-extinct beetles start to appear. Four people and a dog are then hurled 65 million years through the deep geologic time, to the ending era of the dinosaurs (Hell Creek formation), and the main character - paleontologist Julian Whitney and his companions - have only one chance for their own rescue.

They must cross thousand miles in the wilderness to reach their rescue point. Meanwhile, in the laboratory, police chief by the name of Sharon Earles must solve the mystery of where did those people disappear. Two physicists try to determine what went wrong but it is not clear, if they really want missing people to return from the primeval time. During their journey, Whithey and others will meet living popular dinosaurs like _Triceratops_, _Ankylosaurus_, _Troodon_ and of course, _Tyrannosaurus_. But they also meet other man, named Carl. This mysterious person is an enigma for them until the end of the book. Can they survive in the hostile world of the last dinosaurs?
