The 2017 SASKATCHEWAN ROUGHRIDERS SEASON was the 60th season for the team in the Canadian Football League. It was the club's 108th year overall, and its 102nd season of play. The Roughriders improved upon their 5–13 record from 2016 and clinched a playoff spot with a win over the Calgary Stampeders on October 20, 2017. They finished in fourth place in the West Division and crossed over to the East Division playoffs for the third time in franchise history. They won their first ever East Semi-Final game by defeating the Ottawa Redblacks, but lost the following week to the Toronto Argonauts 25–21 in the last minute of the game.

This was the first season that the Roughriders were playing at their brand new stadium, Mosaic Stadium, following the previous 95 years at the site of Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field.[1] This was the second season under head coach and general manager Chris Jones. For the fifth consecutive season, the club held their training camp at Griffiths Stadium in Saskatoon with the main camp beginning on May 28.[2]
