The ST. JOSEPH'S CHURCH[1] ( ) is a religious building that is affiliated with the Catholic Church and is administered by the Order of Carmelites, located in the German Colony of Haifa,[2][3] northern Israel.[4] Beside the church dedicated to St. Joseph, is found a school and offices linked to the church.

The first Latin-rite Catholic Church was dedicated to the Prophet Elijah in the Hamra Square. It was inaugurated in 1867 and could accommodate 400 worshipers. In the War of Independence the temple was damaged, and the Carmelite friars settled in the building of the Salesian school in the city center. In the 1950s the community managed to raise enough money to build a new church, which was designed by Italian architect Antonio Barluzzi, was inaugurated in 1961, a year after his death. The Church of St. Joseph is the last building designed by Barluzzi in the Holy Land.
