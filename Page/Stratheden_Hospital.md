STRATHEDEN HOSPITAL is currently a small community hospital in Cupar, Fife which was originally called Fife and Kinross District Asylum. Its name was changed to Stratheden Hospital in 1948. It was a centre of excellence in Child and Family Psychiatry from the 1960s. In the 21st century, it caters for psychiatric health.[1][2] It is managed by NHS Fife.


History

Early history

When the hospital was opened on 1 July 1866, it was known as the FIFE AND KINROSS DISTRICT ASYLUM.[3] 159 patients were recorded on the roster although it was built to accommodate up to 200. The first chief physician, John Batty Tuke, pioneered the hospital's "open door" policy and helped change traditional methods of psychiatric care. Due to eventual overcrowding, the hospital was extended in 1896. Costing over £20,000, the extension increased the patient capacity to 600 and a further two new hospital wings were also built in 1905 due to the increasing number of patients.[4]

Following the introduction of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947 the name of the hospital changed to Stratheden Hospital on 7 July 1948.[5]

A leading Child and Family Psychiatry Department

1960 saw the arrival of Dr Douglas Haldane, an energetic and recently appointed young consultant child psychiatrist.[6] He had the novel idea of calling his department "Child and Family Psychiatry", a name that was to catch on elsewhere. His unit was located at 'Playfield House' and was opened in the grounds of the hospital. As the label implied, it catered for children, adolescents and their families.[7] Eventually, in 1975, two purpose-built buildings were set aside for the in-patient care for whole family groups, along the lines of the Cassel Hospital, south of the border.[8][9] The other consultant child psychiatrist appointed to the hospital was Dr Simon Lindsay, who had been a trainee of the distinguished child analyst Melanie Klein. Lindsay was said to have been the only direct _Kleinian_ in the whole of Scotland.[10]

Recent developments

In September 2014 Mrs Chrys Muirhead won an Ombudsman case against NHS Fife for the "unreasonable treatment" of her son in Stratheden Hospital. Mr Muirhead had been resident in the hospital in February 2012, and Mrs Muirhead had raised a number of complaints with the Fife Health Board, Fife Council Social Work and Fife Police throughout 2012.[11] There was a locked seclusion room being used in the old intensive psychiatric care unit or Ward 4 at Stratheden which had no toilet, light or water, and Mrs Muirhead's son was locked in this room overnight, in the dark, unobserved, for hours at a time, with a broken hand untreated. When he needed the toilet no nurses appeared and Mr Muirhead had to defecate on the floor of the cell, following which, when still no nurses appeared, he did a dirty protest in his distress at being neglected.[12]

Plans for a new intensive psychiatric care unit (IPCU) at Stratheden were approved in 2014 and construction began in 2015 with funds awarded by Scottish Government. On 6 July 2015 First Minister Nicola Sturgeon joined NHS Fife chief executive Paul Hawkins in a sod-cutting ceremony at Stratheden Hospital and said "The Scottish Government is investing over £2 billion in Scotland’s health infrastructure over the spending review period, with this development being one of many that demonstrate the Scottish Government’s commitment to continually improving health services.”[13] The extension cost £4.4 million and includes a communal lounge, rooms for rehabilitative and therapeutic activities, access to an outdoor courtyard, private meeting rooms for visits from families or visitors, an IT suite and eight new patient en-suite rooms.[14][15] Hollyview Ward, IPCU, was officially opened by Maureen Watt MSP, Minister for Mental Health, in July 2016.[16] Hollyview_Ward,_Intensive_Psychiatric_Care_Unit_(IPCU)_Stratheden_Hospital,_Cupar,_Fife.jpg
