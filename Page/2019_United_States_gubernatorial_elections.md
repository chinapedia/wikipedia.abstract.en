Election predictions

Several sites and individuals publish predictions of competitive seats. These predictions look at factors such as the strength of the incumbent (if the incumbent is running for re-election), the strength of the candidates, and the partisan leanings of the state (reflected in part by the state's Cook Partisan Voting Index rating). The predictions assign ratings to each seat, with the rating indicating the predicted advantage that a party has in winning that seat. Most election predictors use "tossup" to indicate that neither party has an advantage, "lean" to indicate that one party has a slight advantage, "likely" or "favored" to indicate that one party has a significant but not insurmountable advantage, and "safe" or "solid" to indicate that one party has a near-certain chance of victory. Some predictions also include a "tilt" rating that indicates that one party has an advantage that is not quite as strong as the "lean" rating would indicate.

Republican incumbent eligible for re-election

Kentucky

One-term Governor Matt Bevin, a Republican, was eligible for re-election in 2019 and was renominated for a second term. State Representative Robert Goforth and fellow Republicans Ike Lawrence and William Woods unsuccessfully challenged Bevin in the GOP primary. Attorney General Andy Beshear, House Minority Leader Rocky Adkins, former state auditor Adam Edelen and fellow Democrat Geoff Young ran for the Democratic nomination, and Andy Beshear won that nomination.

Retiring and term-limited Republican incumbent

Mississippi

Two-term Governor Phil Bryant, a Republican, is term-limited in 2019 and therefore ineligible to seek re-election. Republican candidates include Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves; Democratic candidates include Attorney General Jim Hood.[6]

Louisiana

Incumbent Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards is running for a second term in 2019. The Republican candidates are U.S. Representative Ralph Abraham, of the 5th congressional district, and businessman Eddie Rispone.
