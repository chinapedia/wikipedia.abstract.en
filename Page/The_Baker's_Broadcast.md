_THE BAKER'S BROADCAST_ is the name applied to three old-time radio variety programs in the United States. The first one went on the air October 8, 1933; the third one's last broadcast was June 26, 1938. The name applied to all three apparently was derived from Fleischmann's Yeast, which sponsored all three programs.[1]


Format

1933–1935

RUN DATES: October 8, 1933 – June 30, 1935[2]

Joe Penner starred in this version, along with Ozzie Nelson and Ozzie's future wife,[3] Harriet Hilliard. Penner's role led to the program's having an alternate unofficial title, _The Joe Penner Show_.[4] Hal Erickson, in his book, _From Radio to the Big Screen: Hollywood Films Featuring Broadcast Personalities and Programs_, wrote, "Though bearing the name _The Baker's Broadcast_ when it debuted over NBC-Blue on October 8, 1933, it was _The Joe Penner Show_ all the way so far as the public was concerned."[5]

Ozzie Nelson led the orchestra for the program, and Harriet was the singer.[6] The Penner-Nelsons combination ended when Penner "abruptly exited _The Baker's Broadcast_, upset over the sponsor's refusal to freshen up the writing and alter the format."[7] Kliph Nesteroff, in his book, _The Comedians: Drunks, Thieves, Scoundrels, and the History of American Comedy_, wrote about Penner's version of the show, "The style of his program was juvenile but undeniably popular ...."[8]

Among the contributions this program made was bringing to a national audience Mel Blanc, the virtuoso of voices who later had his own program and was featured on other old-time radio programs.[9]

Ben Grauer was the announcer, and Hal Raynor was a writer for the program.[10]

1935–1937

RUN DATES: October 6, 1935 – June 27, 1937[11]

The Nelsons, who were married two days after this version began,[12] continued as co-stars, with Penner replaced by Robert Ripley. Ripley's role led to the use of the alternate unofficial title _Believe It or Not_[13] (which was used for other radio programs that featured Ripley). Neal Thompson, in his book, _A Curious Man: The Strange & Brilliant Life of Robert "Believe it Or Not" Ripley_, called the Ripley version of _The Baker's Broadcast_ "one of America's favorite shows, in league with the top-ranked shows of Jack Benny and Bing Crosby."[14]

John Dunning in his reference work, _On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio_, wrote that the Nelsons "were young and attractive, and their music — lighthearted and melodious — was what America wanted in the Depression.[15]

Ben Grauer continued as the program's announcer.[16]

1937–1938

RUN DATES: October 3, 1937 – June 26, 1938.

For its final series, _The Baker's Broadcast_ not only changed hosts but moved from New York City to Hollywood. Former athlete and comics artist Feg Murray became the new host, while the Nelsons continued to provide music. Dunning wrote: "Feg Murray hosted and Ozzie helped with interviews. This never generated much excitement: it failed after a single season."[17]

Once again, Grauer was the announcer.[18] Robert Brewster was the producer[19] (succeeded by John Christ)[20] and Ed Rice wrote scripts for the program.[21]
