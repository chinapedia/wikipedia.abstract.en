JEANNETTE LITTLEMORE is a British scholar of English and applied linguistics, whose work focuses on the interpretation of figurative language, including metaphor and metonymy, as it relates to second language learning and teaching. Her research examines the ways that metaphor is misunderstood by learners of English.

Littlemore earned her PhD in English Language Teaching at Thames Valley University in 1998.[1] She has worked at the University of Birmingham since 1999, having taught and lectured earlier in Brussels, Belgium; Saitama Ken, Japan; and Santander, Spain. She served as the Head of Department of English Language and Applied Linguistics at the University of Birmingham, where she is currently a Professor. In addition, in 2016 she was appointed Distinguished Professor at the Research Institute for Bilingual Learning and Teaching (RIBiLT) at the Open University of Hong Kong, where her duties include mentoring academic staff in research and publications and supporting the research activities of academics.[2][3] She is a member of the international advisory board of Metaphor Lab Amsterdam.[4] In 2014 Littlemore, along with Dr Paula Perez-Sobrino and Dr David Houghton, was awarded a £138,981 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship for the project ‘Exploring Multimodal Metaphor and Metonymy in Advertising’ (EMMA). The project examines responses to video advertisements on participants who are speakers of English, Spanish, and Chinese.[5]
