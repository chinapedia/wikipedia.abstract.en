Career

Her career began when she overheard race car driver Ken Schrader was planning to start a new short-track team and required a tire specialist.[13][14] Smokstad and her husband accepted the position and moved to Charlotte, North Carolina in 1996. When two race teams merged in 1999, she was required to look for a new job because Schrader wanted a tire specialist with more experience. He advised her not to send a résumé to Hendrick Motorsports because of her gender.[15] However, she was asked by Jack Sprague and his crew chief Dennis Conner to join Hendrick Motorsports as their tire specialist. That same year, he won the Craftsman Truck Series; the experience strengthened Smokstad's loyalty to team and garnered her admiration for its founder Rick Hendrick.[16] She later worked with various drivers who raced for Hendrick Motorsports.[17] Smokstad coached a gymnastics team while not working in auto racing.[18] She gave birth to her daughter, RaElla, on August 30, 2007.[19] She and fellow crew member Zach Miller were awarded the Cup Series "Consistently Smooth" Tire Specialist Award in 2009.[20] Smokstad was promoted by Hendrick Motorsports in 2010 to focus on strategizing and tire testing.[21]
