A LEI NIHO PALAOA is a Hawaiian neck ornament traditionally worn by _ali ªi_ (chiefs) of both sexes. The 19th century examples are most commonly made of a whale tooth carved into a hook-shape suspended by plaited human hair. The symbolism is not known; it may represent a tongue that speaks the law, or may represent a vessel for _mana_ (inherited virtue).[1] Precontact LEI NIHO PALAOA were less than two inches in length, and were not only made of whale ivory, but also of shell, bone, wood, stone, and coral.[2] Sometimes, several of these smaller pendants were strung on twisted human hair.[3] The Bishop Museum has a LEI NIHO PALAOA with a hair bundle having a circumference of 7.5 inches. It is made from a single eight-ply square braid cord, measuring 1,708 feet, looped back and forth over 1000 times on each side.[4]
