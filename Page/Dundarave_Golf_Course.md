History

Dundarave Golf Course official opened on July 15, 1999 after being delayed for about a month.[1] The delay in opening of the course was a result of the dry weather which caused the grass to grow in slower than expected. The course was designed by two different award-winning architects, Dr. Michael Hurdzan and Dana Fry.[2] It was designed as an expansion to the Brudenell River Resort and is intertwined throughout its sister course Brudenell River Golf Course.

In 2007, the provincial government began looking to sell the Dundarave Golf course, along with the other three courses it owns. The reasoning behind the decision was the large expenditure of taxpayer money on course maintenance, losses from the four courses totaled $858,900 in the 2014-2015 golf season.[3] Tourism Minister Robert Henderson was quoted saying "Obviously, when you’re on the floor of the estimates [committee] … and you’re saying you invested in this stuff, sometimes comments get made that maybe that would have been better spent on an X-ray machine or books,"[4] in relation to the government's decision to sell the courses. As of the 2015 golf season no sale had been completed and the course is still maintained by the provincial government.[5]
