_THE OTTOMAN LIEUTENANT_ () is a Turkish-American World War I drama film directed by Joseph Ruben and written by Jeff Stockwell. The film stars Michiel Huisman, Hera Hilmar, Josh Hartnett and Ben Kingsley. The film was released widely on March 10, 2017.[1]

The film was released around the period of the film _The Promise_, a film depicting the Armenian genocide.[2] The perceived similarities between the films resulted in accusations that _The Ottoman Lieutenant_ existed to deny the Armenian genocide.[3][4]


Plot

_The Ottoman Lieutenant_ is a love story between an idealistic American nurse (Hera Hilmar) and a Turkish officer (Michiel Huisman) during World War I. Lillie first travels to Istanbul (called as such in-movie, though at the time in real life it was known as Constantinople and/or "Stamboul" in English, see Names of Istanbul) , before being escorted by Ismail to the region around Van.

Production

The motion picture commenced principal photography in Prague, Czech Republic in April 2015, and also filmed in Cappadocia and Istanbul, Turkey and completed filming in July 2015. The film's music score was composed by Geoff Zanelli.[5] A parcel of land at Barrandov Studios in Prague was where most filming took place.[6] _The Ottoman Lieutenant_ entered into production before _The Promise_, which depicts the Armenian genocide as a deliberate campaign from the Ottoman Empire government, did; _The Ottoman Lieutenant_ depicts the deaths of Armenians in the manner that the Turkish government stated that happened, in that it was unorganized killings instead of a planned genocide.[7]

Cara Buckley of _The New York Times_ stated that "several people familiar with" the production indicated that the producers in Turkey, unbeknownst to the director, had arranged for the final cut, and due to the post-production removal of dialog related to the Armenian genocide, "Several people who worked on the project felt the final version butchered the film artistically, and smacked of denialism".[8] Reuben, unsatisfied with post-production changes, did not promote the film, but was contractually required to keep his name in the credits. [9]

The production team of _The Ottoman Lieutenant_ asked Project Save, an archive of Armenian photographs based in the United States, for permission to use some of the photographs. Project Save researched the producers and declined to license the photographs because the producers of the film received financial support from Turkey.[10]


Reception and release

The film's release date changed as the release date of _The Promise_ changed, and internet users stated that this was a campaign from the producers of _The Ottoman Lieutenant_ to influence Americans. Terry George, who directed _The Promise_, stated that the publicity material for the films were similar; there were accusations, from George and _The Promise_ producer Eric Esrailian, that the film was created solely to counter _The Promise_.[11]

Its Turkish release was scheduled for May 19, 2017.[12] By May 30 of that year, 41,578 people in Turkey viewed the film, a figure that lead Riada Asimovic Aykol of _Al Monitor_ to conclude that _The Ottoman Lieutenant_ had "not done well".[13] The Turkish version of the film added censorship against the kissing scene.[14]

Los Angeles was scheduled as the North American premiere site.[15] In the United States the film's revenue was fewer than $250,000 by April 2017.[16] Alex Ritman and Mia Galuppo of _The Hollywood Reporter_ stated that _The Ottoman Lieutenant_ "didn’t have much impact at the box office" stateside.[17]

Reviews and analysis

_The Ottoman Lieutenant_ was largely panned by film critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 19%, with an average rating of 3.6/10.[18]

Especially in the West,[19] several critics criticized the film for perpetuating the denial of the Armenian Genocide. In his review for _Variety_ Dennis Harvey writes, "[In] this primarily Turkish-funded production, the historical, political, ethnic and other intricacies — not to mention that perpetual elephant in the room, the Armenian Genocide, which commenced in 1915 — are glossed over in favor of a generalized 'Whattaya gonna do… war is bad' aura that implies conscience without actually saying anything." [20]

In his review of the film for _Slant Magazine_, Keith Watson writes, "More conspicuous than The Ottoman Lieutenant's rote melodrama is the way the film elides the concurrent genocide of ethnic Armenians by Ottoman forces, a historical reality which the Turkish government continues to deny to this day.",[21] while critic Roger Moore called _The Ottoman Lieutenant_ "a botched love-triangle romance set against a revisionist account of the Turkish Armenian Genocide." [22]

On March 7, 2017, the Armenian Youth Federation Western United States issued a statement, urging the public not to watch the film in theaters or support it in any way. “[We] do feel it is important for our community to be aware of the fact that genocide denial is present and still a major issue, even outside of the Republic of Turkey,” read a part of the statement.[23] The American Hellenic Council accused the film of being made as a rival of _The Promise_ and argued for boycotting _The Ottoman Lieutenant_.[24]

Michael Daly of _The Daily Beast_ contrasted the film with _The Promise_, which he said does express the truth about the Armenian genocide.[25] Buckley wrote that, due to similarities of some plot points, _The Ottoman Lieutenant_ had "uncanny parallels" to _The Promise_.[26]

The film's reception in Turkey varied, with some being critical, and those in favor of the Turkish government praising the film. Turkish film critic gave approval to the film overall, stating that it mainly reflected the Turkish point of view while being "impartial and honest, without maligning any particular camp and leaving little room for objection", but criticized a scene lacking emphasis of the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Aghtamar, stating that it could have shown Christian audiences the Ottomans' relative religious tolerance.
