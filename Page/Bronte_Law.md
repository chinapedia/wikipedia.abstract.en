BRONTE MAY LAW (born 12 March 1995) is an English professional golfer. She won the 2019 Pure Silk Championship, her first victory on the LPGA Tour.


Early life and amateur career

Law was born in Stockport and attended Cheadle Hulme School and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).[1]

Law played for Great Britain & Ireland in the 2012, 2014 and 2016 Curtis Cup matches. In 2016, she became the second player, and the first from Great Britain and Ireland, to get a perfect 5–0 record.[2][3] Also in 2016 she won the European Ladies Amateur Championship, becoming the world number 2 ranked player in the World Amateur Golf Ranking.[4]


Professional career

Law turned professional late in 2016. She competed in the LPGA Final Qualifying Tournament, earning full status on the Symetra Tour and partial status on the LPGA Tour for 2017.[5][6]

In 2018 she set a new LET record (9) for the number of consecutive birdies and tied the record (12) for the total number of birdies in one round.

In early May 2019, Law lost to Kim Sei-young in a playoff for the LPGA Mediheal Championship. Three weeks later she won the Pure Silk Championship for her first victory on the LPGA Tour. [7]
