NATIONAL FRIENDLY is the trading name of National Deposit Friendly Society, a British friendly society providing financial products and services. It was formed in 1868 as the Surrey Deposit Friendly Society and is currently based in Queen Square, Bristol .[1]


History

The first 50 years

The Surrey Deposit Friendly Society was founded in 1868 by The Reverend Canon George Raymond Portal, who set up a scheme to support the health and welfare of families. The name was changed to National Depost Friendly Society in 1871.

The National Insurance Act was introduced in 1911 and this was the first time the State took contributions from the public towards medical care.[2] Friendly societies and trade unions were given a major role in administering health insurance, which increased National Friendly’s membership.[3] [4]

During World War I, National Friendly established its own convalescent home, which offered support to the injured soldiers.[5]

The Second 50 years

During World War II, National Friendly moved to Somerset.[6] The NHS was formed in 1948, bringing a huge change in the provision of medical services.

It continued to sell a stream of endowments while looking for new forms of income, including taking over the Railway Deposit Friendly Society.[7]

The Third 50 years

In 1982 National Friendly moved to Clifton, Bristol and put a new General Secretary in place. Its assets increased and tipped over £100 million as it celebrated its 125th birthday.

The migration from cheques and cash to direct debt meant that it could streamline its offices to just one building and in 2014 it moved to Queen Square, Bristol.[8]

In 2016, after a period of focusing on existing members, National Friendly returned to the health care market and over the following years released a range of new products.[9][10][11]

In 2018, National Friendly celebrated its 150th anniversary and released a commemorative logo.

Fundraising and supporting the community

National Friendly's employees choose a ‘Charity of the Year’ to raise funds for on an annual basis. Firstly, all its staff are invited to nominate charities about which they are passionate. The CSR committee, against pre-agreed selection criteria, then reviews nominations to create a shortlist. All staff then vote from the shortlist for their preferred charity of the year and the charity with the most votes is selected.[12]

Over the past five years it has selected charities such as Alzheimer's Society, Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal, Penny Brohn UK, St Mungo's and Cystic Fibrosis Trust, raising over £50,000 in funds.[13]

National Friendly has also supported the local community in the Bristol area by sponsoring local sports teams and working with Ablaze's 'Reading Buddy' programme to help improve the reading and communications skills of local primary school children.
