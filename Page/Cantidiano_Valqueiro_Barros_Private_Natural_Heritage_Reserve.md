History

The owner of the Tabuleiro Comprido farm, Natanael Valgueiro Barros, was opposed to hunting and deforestation. He raised cattle, sheep and goats on the land, which also supports a flock of emus, now much reduced in size by hunters. The National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) declared that the farm was unproductive, and threatened to expropriate and develop it. The environmental group SOS Caatinga and others helped with a campaign against INCRA's proposal, calling it an environmental disaster to clear the well-preserved _caatinga_. They gained the support of the federal representative of the RPPN program in Pernambuco.

The Cantidiano Valqueiro Barros Private Natural Heritage Reserve was recognized by Romulus Melo, president of the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), by ordnance 177 on 31 December 2002. The ordnance was published on 3 January 2003. The RPPN is the second in the Pernambuco _caatinga_, the first being the Maurício Dantas RPPN. It became part of the Caatinga Ecological Corridor, created in 2006.
