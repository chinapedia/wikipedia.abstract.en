MATT BORGES is an American politician, and the former Chairman of the Ohio Republican Party.

He has been listed as a potential candidate for chairman of the RNC.[1]


Early life and education

Borges grew up in Barrington, Rhode Island,[2] and earned a B.A. in political science from The Ohio State University in 1994. He works as government relations director for the law firm Roetzel & Andress.[3]


Controversy

Borges was embroiled in pay-to-play scandal in 2004 when Borges was chief of staff to former Republican state Treasurer Joe Deters. Borges plead "guilty in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court to a misdemeanor count of unauthorized use of a public office for giving preferential treatment to certain brokers who contributed to Deters' re-election campaign." He paid $1,000 in fines and the record was later expunged.[4]
