ST STEPHEN'S CHURCH, EAST HAM, was a church on Green Street in East Ham, east London.[1] Its nave and aisles were completed in 1887 and its chancel, north chapel, south chancel aisle, vestries and choir in 1894. It founded three mission churches - St Alban's Church, St Michael's Church, Rutland Road and St Cuthbert's Church, Florence Road.

It was renovated in 1938 but severely damaged two years later in the London Blitz - St Cuthbert's was also destroyed during the war. The congregation moved to St Michael's but post-war the decision was taken not to rebuild St Stephen's and St Cuthbert's and the former was demolished in 1954 and the parish merged into that of St Edmund's.
