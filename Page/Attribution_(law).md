Doctrines of ATTRIBUTION are legal doctrines by which liability is extended to a defendant who did not actually commit the criminal act.[1] [2] Examples include vicarious liability (when acts of another are imputed or "attributed" to a defendant), attempt to commit a crime (even though it was never completed), and conspiracy to commit a crime (when it is not completed or which is committed by another in the conspiracy).[3]
