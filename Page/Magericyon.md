_MAGERICYON_ is an extinct genus of Amphicyonid ("bear-dog") that lived during the Miocene 10-9 Ma (Vallesian Age) in what is now Spain.


Description

The appearance of this animal was vaguely similar to that of a particularly robust, large felid, but the skull resembles that of a canid or an ursid, like that of many amphicyonids. Unlike most other amphicyonids, _Magericyon_ had teeth associated with those of a hypercarnivore, with laterally flattened canines, the third premolar having a single root, the absence of second premolars and a metaconid on its lower molars, with a reduction in the second upper molar. The scapula and the front leg showed primitive features such as an acromion in the shoulder with a reduced caudoventral projection and post scapular pit.[1][2] _Magericyon_ was roughly equivalent to a large leopard in size, weighing around .[3]


Classification

_Magericyon_ was described for the first time in 2008, based on fossils found in Cerro de los Batallones in Spain. The type species is _Magericyon anceps_, but a second species has also been attributed to the genus as _M. castellanus_, described in 1981 and initially attributed to the genus _Amphicyon_. _Magericyon_ is part of the family of amphicyonidae, a group of very common carnivores ranging from the Eocene to the Miocene, and which occupied many different ecological niches. Magericyon is the last amphicyonid known from Western Europe, but its features are mixed; on one hand the teeth were very specialized, while on the other, front limb and morphology of the scapula was more primitive. Evidence also indicates that Magericyon was closely related to _Amphicyon_.[4][5]


Paleobiology

_Magericyon_ occupied a different ecological niche than other amphicyonids, such as the larger _Amphicyon_ and _Ysengrinia_ (which had lifestyles more akin to bears) or _Daphoenodon_ and _Temnocyon_ of North America, which were more capable runners. _Magericyon_ probably lived in a similar manner to that of modern felines, being an ambush hunter of large prey.[6][7] Studies by Gemo Siliceo _et al_ also revealed that _Magericyon_ had powerful jaw and neck muscles that helped to stabilize its head and jaws during a bite. The amphicyonid was particularly adept at side-to-side movements and rotations of the head. This feature allowed _Magericyon_ to swiftly and efficiently process the meat on a carcass, allowing the bear-dog to devour sufficient amounts of flesh before scavengers arrived to steal the predator's hard-earned meal.[8]


Paleoecology

As a predator at Cerro de los Battalones, _Magericyon_ would have hunted many of the large herbivores of the time as well as the young of much larger animals. Such herbivores that it could hunt would have included horses like _Hipparion_, young of the hornless rhinoceros _Aceratherium_ and the gomphotheriid mastodon _Tetralophodon_, the suid _Microstonyx_, and possibly the calves of silvatherid giraffes and boselaphine antelopes. _Magericyon_ would have competed for such prey with the rival sabertooth cats _Machairodus_, _Promegantereon_ and _Paramachairodus_, bears such as _Agriotherium_ and _Indarctos_, and the small hyena _Protictitherium_. While the much larger _Agriotherium_ and _Machairodus_ would likely have been strongly competitive with for food and would likely have fought with it or potentially driven it from its kills when they sensed an opportunity, _Paramachairodus_, _Promegantereon_ and _Protictitherium_ meanwhile, likely were less dangerous rivals that could be driven away or fought off. _Magericyon_ would have also wasted no time in stealing a meal from any of the smaller carnivores or in scavenging when the opportunity presented itself.[9] Evidence exists indicating that _Magericyon_ and _Machairodus_ may have been prone to niche partitioning, possibly living in slightly different habitats, with the bear-dog preferring more open habitats while the cats hunted in the more heavily vegetated areas. Dietary preferences may also have played a role in the coexistence between these two large predators.[10]
