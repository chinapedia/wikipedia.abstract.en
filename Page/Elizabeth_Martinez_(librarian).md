ELIZABETH MARTINEZ (born April 14, 1943)[1] is a librarian whose career has focused on bringing diversity, multiculturalism and equality to public libraries and information policy. In 1966 she was the first Mexican American librarian to serve in the state of California.[2] Martinez has served as a library administrator, professor, Executive Director of the American Library Association, and other roles throughout her career.


Education

Martinez began her studies and the University of Southern California, Los Angeles where she obtained a B.A. in Latin American studies in 1965.[3] While there, she took a children's literature course for the English requirement, but finding a lack of representation for indigenous people and cultures from around the world in the course she began contemplating how literature from non-European nations can be better disseminated to the masses.[4] In 1966 Martinez received her Master of Arts in Library Science degree from the University of California.[5] She later continued her education by receiving a certificate of management from USC in 1978 and an executive management program certificate from the University of California, Irvine in 1986.[6]


Career

Upon graduating with her Library Science degree in 1966, Martinez became the California's first Mexican American Librarian when she took a position in the Los Angeles Public Library.[7] She worked in various library administrative roles. In 1971 Martinez co-founded REFORMA, The National Association to Promote Library and Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish Speaking,[8] which is an affiliate organization of the American Library Association (ALA). Along with Binnie Tate Wilkin, she co-chaired the first ALA policy on diversity “Equity at Issue” in 1986.[9] She was County Librarian of Orange County in 1979-1990 during which time she oversaw the construction of 8 new community libraries among other achievements.[10] As the city librarian of Los Angeles (1990-1994) Martinez developed the Asian, Pacific Islander, Black, Chicano, and Native American resources center in the Los Angeles and Orange County library systems.[11] Martinez served as the Executive Director of the ALA from 1994 - 1997. During her tenure at the ALA, she developed the Spectrum Scholarship program and the Office for Information Technology Policy was established. She also proposed a program to Bill Gates that resulted in a $200 million grant dedicated to bridging the information gap by connecting more than 4,000 public libraries in poor communities across the US to the Internet.[12] Martinez has been credited with reviving the Salinas Public Library system while she served as the Library Director there due to the remodeling of the Cesar Chavez Library and implementation of new programming and multicultural initiatives.[13] She was adjunct faculty at her Alma mater of UCLA until 2003. She is currently a lecturer at San Jose State University. Some of the courses she has taught at SJSU include: Library Services for Racially and Ethnically Diverse Communities, Seminar on Contemporary Issues, and Professional Experience Internships.[14] Martinez has served on various committees and boards throughout her career and is currently a member of the New Mexico State Library Commission.[15] In 2013, REFORMA established the Elizabeth Martinez Lifetime Achievement Award to recognize librarians who have served over 20 years and whose leadership has made significant and lasting contributions to Spanish speaking communities.[16]
