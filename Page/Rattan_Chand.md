Dr Rattan Chand has been one of the key people involved in the National Family Health Surveys conducted by Government of India. While talking to New York Times, Chand said, "This round will provide both district and national level data because of a revamped format. The plan is to conduct such a survey every three years." Chand also said that he wasn’t aware why the national survey had been delayed but explained that consultations had been under way for a while to come up with a new redesigned survey.[1] Rattan Chand had also said that the annual healthy survey (AHS) was being scrapped to avoid duplication. "There was no reason to carry multiple surveys to map the same indicators. It was thought to be better to have one comprehensive survey instead of four fragmented ones, the new version of NFHS will not compromise of any indicators that were mapped in other surveys. We have asked the census commissioner to come out with district-level infant, under-5 and maternal mortality once in three years."[2]


Efforts Against Female Foeticide

Given the dismal Child Sex Ratio in the country, and the Supreme Court directive of 2003 to State governments to enforce the law banning the use of sex determination technologies, the Ministry set up a National Inspection and Monitoring Committee (NIMC) in October last. Rattan Chand, Director (PNDT) was made the convenor of the NIMC. The NIMC under the guidance of Rattan Chand conducted raids in some of the districts in Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Gujarat. In April, it conducted raids on three clinics in Delhi. In its reports sent to the Chief Secretaries of the respective States, the committee observed that the Authorities had failed to monitor or supervise the registered clinics.[3]

As Director (PNDT) & Convenor of PNDT Act, 1994, Chand raided many hospitals and clinic all over India and shut them down for running illegal Sex determination tests. Rattan Chand said that even if the NIMC conducted raids, it could only send a report to the highest levels in the State Government. It was up to the State authorities to act on it.[4]
