Player availability

Universities do not have ‘first call’ on hurlers from counties participating in the Leinster Championship Qualifier Group (i.e. Laois, Meath and Westmeath) or playing in the 2017 Christy Ring Cup (i.e. Carlow and Kildare) unless the hurler is in receipt of a college scholarship.

Universities have ‘first call’ on county hurlers up to a maximum of six, chosen from Dublin, Kilkenny, Offaly, Wexford and Galway.

After the Kehoe Cup group stage is completed hurlers who played with their university may play for their county in the final if their college did not qualify for the Kehoe Cup final.
