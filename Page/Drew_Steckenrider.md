ANDREW PAUL STECKENRIDER (born January 10, 1991) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball (MLB).


Career

Steckenrider attended Greater Atlanta Christian School in Norcross, Georgia and played college baseball at the University of Tennessee. He was drafted by the Miami Marlins in the eighth round of the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft and he signed.

After signing, Steckenrider made his professional debut that same year for the Jamestown Jammers and spent the whole season there, going 1-2 with a 3.72 ERA in ten games (eight starts). In 2013, he played for the Greensboro Grasshoppers where he pitched to a 1-1 record and 4.58 ERA before he underwent Tommy John surgery in May.[1] In 2014, Steckenrider made one appearance, a rehab start, for the GCL Marlins in which he pitched one scoreless inning. In 2015, he pitched for Greensboro and the Jupiter Hammerheads where he compiled a 5-6 record and 3.00 ERA in 25 games (13 starts), and in 2016 he played with Jupiter, the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp, and the New Orleans Zephyrs where he was 1-1 with a 2.08 ERA and 0.85 WHIP in 40 relief appearances.[2] The Marlins added Steckenrider to their 40-man roster after the 2016 season.[3]

Steckenrider began 2017 with New Orleans. On May 23, 2017, he was called up to the majors to replace David Phelps on the roster, who was placed on the bereavement list.[4] He made his major league debut the following day, striking out one in an inning of work. Once Phelps returned from the bereavement list on May 26, Steckenrider was optioned back to New Orleans. He bounced back to the majors twice more before securing a role as a relief pitcher with the Marlins in July. At seasons end, he held Miami's lowest ERA at 2.34 with a 1-1 record and 54 strikeouts in 34.2 innings pitched over 37 major league games. Steckenrider began 2018 in Miami's bullpen.
