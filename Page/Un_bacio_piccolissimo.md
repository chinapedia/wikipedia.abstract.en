"UN BACIO PICCOLISSIMO" is a 1964 song composed by Giovanni Ornati and Gino Mescoli. The song premiered at the 14th edition of the Sanremo Music Festival with a double performance of Robertino and Bobby Rydell. Robertino's version was sung with a fake English accent according to the fashion of the time.[1][2]

Both Robertino's and Rydell's versions were successful, respectively ranking #4 and #9 on the Italian hit parade.[3]

The song was later recorded also in Spanish (with the title "Un beso pequenisimo") and in German (with the title "Heute Abend lass die Uhr zu Haus").[4] In 2016 thecomedy music group Elio e le Storie Tese, with the participation as spoken voice of adult actor Rocco Siffredi, presented a new version of the song at the 63rd edition of the Sanremo Music Festival.[5]
