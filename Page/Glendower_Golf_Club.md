History

In 1935, ten businessmen formed a company with an idea to create a country club and purchased the farm Glendower which in those days was on the edge to the town of Edenvale.[1] The land bought was 266.7 acres in size and consisted mostly of a tree plantation.[2] A parkland course was planned and an English golfing architect, Charles Hugh Alison, was employed to design the course and it was constructed by A.F.Tomsett.[3] The course would open on 7 March 1937.[4] In 1939, The Transvaal Open Championship was held at the club and won by Bobby Locke with a record score of 265.[5][6] A record prize of £100 for the time, was offered by the club in 1946.[7] In 1973, the club grounds would be declared a nature reserve.[8] At the Volvo Toro Classic held at the course in 1975, Allan Henning scored eleven birdies in his first round.[9] The club has hosted the South African Open in 1989, 1993, 1997, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.[10] In 1997, Vijay Singh became the first non-white player to win a South African Open at the course.[11] The BMW South African Championship was again hosted from 11–14 January 2018 at the Glendower Golf Club.[12]

In 1985, the course was redesigned with all 18 greens reshaped and rebuilt to USGA standard, new tee positions added and extended and new water features added at eleven holes. The course has fairways with 64 bunkers, 27 on the front nine and 37 on the back nine and has water hazards on 11 of its 18 holes.[13]
