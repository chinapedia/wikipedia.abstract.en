The INTERNATIONAL PRECISION MEDICINE CENTER (IPMC) - 국제정밀의료센터) is the world's first Precision Medicine Center focused on cell therapy that is situated in a global bio-service multi complex community in South Korea. It is founded in March 2016 by Young Woo Jang, who is now a CEO of IPMC, and Dr. Robert Hariri, the world's renowned pioneer of the use of human stem cells to treat a range of life-threatening diseases.

IPMC builds a precision medical infrastructure and provides services in beauty, nutrition, healthcare, spa, fitness, and precision agriculture, etc. For this, IPMC makes partnerships with global companies and operates a corporation based on a team of researchers in the fields of medicine, biotechnology and ICT, all for successful precision medical care.

IPMC's business has 6 major sectors:

1.  Precision Medicine diagnostic platform offering genomic data generation and analysis and clinical application
2.  Cohort research and genomic data accumulation for diversified genomic information by race, gender, and age
3.  Stem cell banking (cord blood, placenta blood, and tissue), NIPT(Non-Invasive Prenatal Test) and newborn genome analysis service
4.  Personalized cell therapy based on genomic analysis
5.  Personalized medical examination
6.  Wellness programs for the elderly including personalized bionutrition product and services to prevent and treat sarcopenia

Apart from the major business sectors, IPMC also organizes programs such as International Precision Medicine Center Conference(IPMC Conference) and IPMC Prize competitions, etc., to encourage and support the domestic and overseas bio industry's knowledge sharing, global growth and open innovation.

Precision medicine is an emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in environment, lifestyle and genes for each person.[1] There are 5 features in precision medicine: Large population cohort, health information record, genomic information, smart healthcare technology and big data analysis technology.


Vision

IPMC aims to help advance science aimed at the discovery and development of effective treatments for human diseases and improving human health. For that, IPMC devotes to build a global ecosystem and standard service platform of Precision Medicine and Precision Industry. It serves as a base for a service-centric Precision Medicine business focused on genome and bio convergence technology, and would willingly take the role as a pioneer of the standardization of future medicine. Moreover, IPMC organizes the world's largest personalized medicine and preventive medicine conference and serves as a global innovative technology & knowledge hub. Ultimately, IPMC will become a global bio-Service Complex (International Precision Medicine Center) to realize the world's first bio-ecosystem, and the starting point of the global smart city (International Precision Medicine City).


Background

Due to the rapid aging of the world, interest in precision medicine has been increasing recently. In January 2015, President Obama announced the Precision Medicine Initiative, which puts about $210 million annually into an optimized medical treatment technique tailored to individual patient characteristics, such as diabetes and cancer.[2] In the precision medical field, the global market size is expected to reach $129 billion in 2020, but there is no clear leading country other than the US, and it is necessary to preempt the market.

The world that is now in the fourth industrial revolution is at the forefront of the new and important turning point in human history. At that turning point, genomics and cell therapy must extend and expand the lives of millions of people around the world with innovative technologies. To lead it, IPMC intends to start a BOLD JOURNEY.

The CEO of IPMC, Young Woo Jang, believes that the next decade will be unmatched by the past 100 years, and sees the value in trying a BOLD CHALLENGE to lead the transformation. The process will be challenging but it is an essential way to go, learn and innovate together, and change the fundamental framework of basic science and clinical trials. IPMC would like to make this bold challenge in South Korea into the BOLD CHALLENGE MOVEMENT to lead the world.


Logo

Project

2017 IPMC Conference

The first IPMC conference was held in January 2017, and was part of IPMC BOLD CHALLENGE. The theme of ‘Beyond Personalized Medicine: From Womb to Heaven’ was in-depth presentation on Precision Medicine, including customized medicine and stem cell therapy. At this conference, world's top class personnel in precision medicine and cell therapy participated as speakers to present a global vision, such as Dr. Hariri, the co-founder of IPMC and the icon of the global bio industry, and Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach, the former head of the US Food and Drug Administration.

2017 IPMC Prize Competition

The 2017 IPMC Prize Competition was organized by IPMC, and was open to anyone with ideas for entrepreneurial items based on ideas and technology in the areas of precision medical and precision food, ICT grafting, cell therapy, gene diagnosis and next-generation sequencing.

The two winners were presented with a plaque, the opportunity to present at the 2017 IPMC Conference, and support for global commercialization such as commercialization in conjunction with IPMC in the future.
