Plot

A young blonde woman is abducted by a scientist known as Dr. Hugo Strange who requires the young woman for an experiment. As he and one of his monster men take her up a relatively isolated mountain where his secret laboratory is located, they are ambushed by the Dark Knight who attacks them in order to free the tied woman. After defeating the monster man, Batman goes after Hugo Strange, who is holding the young woman hostage and threatens to kill her if Batman comes closer. Strange slowly steps back towards a chasm and Batman's sudden move causes him to fall to the abyss. Batman saves the woman from falling as well and the two of them watch as Strange falls to his death.[4]
