PIERRE BILLARD (3 July 1922 – 10 November 2016) was a French journalist, film critic and historian of cinema.


Career

Born in Dieppe (Seine-Maritime), Pierre Billard followed the courses of resistant Valentin Feldman during the Occupation of France. They would become close and the teaching of Feldman marked him permanently. He then went to study at the Sorbonne, before specializing in cinema.

President of the "Fédération française des ciné-clubs" from 1952, in 1954 he founded the magazine __, of which he was chief editor from _Cinéma 54_ to _Cinéma 67_. After he worked as journalist and film critic for _Les Nouvelles littéraires_, _Candide_ and _L'Express_, he was one of the cofounders of the weekly _Le Point_ where he directed the cultural pages until 1987. In the early 1980s, he was also editor-in-chief of the professional weekly magazine _Le Film français_.

Pïerre Billard has taught the history of cinema at the Institut d'études politiques de Paris[1] and published several books including _Louis Malle, le rebelle solitaire_. He is the father of journalist and historian of cinema, Jean-Michel Frodon.[2]

In 1995, he published the book _L’Âge classique du cinéma français_, in conjunction with that of his son Jean-Michel, _L'Âge moderne du cinéma français_.[3] This book which deals with French cinema from 1928, that is the advent of sound film, until 1959, can be considered as a "reference tool" during this period. There he worked as a "historian", seeking to show with neutrality and without addressing the critical point of view, the influences of the economy, politics or culture on French cinema.[4] _Les Inrockuptibles_ consider "exciting" the part that touches the first talking films, noting that the author is more reserved about what concerns the French cinema of the 1950s.[5] He particularly dealt with René Clair and Jean Renoir.[6] He died on 10 November 2016 at the age of 94.[7]
