The THOMAS JEFFERIS HOUSE is a historic building located in Council Bluffs, Iowa, United States. Jefferis was a Delaware native who was a homeopathic physician. He made and lost fortunes through his involvement in speculative ventures, including real estate and a silver mine in Utah.[1] The two-story frame Italianate structure was completed in 1869. It features bracketed eaves, cornice, full length front porch, and siding that is scored to resemble ashlar. It was originally capped with a belvedere, which has been lost. The house is composed of three blocks. It was converted into a funeral home in the 1940s, and it housed other businesses since. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.[2]
