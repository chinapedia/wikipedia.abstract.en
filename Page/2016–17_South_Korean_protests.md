2016–17 SOUTH KOREAN PROTESTS (THE CANDLE PROTEST), also known as CANDLELIGHT STRUGGLE[1] () or CANDLELIGHT REVOLUTION[2] (), were a series of protests against President Park Geun-hye that occurred throughout South Korea from November 2016 to March 2017. After the initial demonstrations on October 26, 2016, hundreds of thousands of South Korean protesters denounced the Park administration's political scandal and called for the resignation of Park Geun-hye.[3][4]

Meanwhile, a series of protests led by the supporters of President Park occurred around the country as well.[5][6] After the impeachment of Park Geun-hye on corruption charges in December, the pro-Park rallies mobilized thousands of protesters for counter protests.[7][8] In February 2017, the Liberty Korea Party, at the time the ruling party of South Korea, claimed that the size of pro-Park rallies have begun to overwhelm the size of anti-Park rallies.[9]


Background

In October 2016, a political scandal erupted over President Park Geun-hye's undisclosed links to Choi Soon-sil. Choi Soon-sil, a woman with no security clearance and no official position, who was found to have been giving secret counsel to the president.

Choi Soon-sil had known President Park since the 1970s when her father, Choi Tae-min, was former president Park Chung-hee's mentor, while the family was still grieving from the assassination of the first-lady Yuk Young-soo.[10] Choi at that time claimed that the shamanic leader could channel communication to her dead mother.[11]

Both have remained friends since, even after Park Geun-hye became president. Park's behaviour during her tenure has raised suspicions, due to her lack of communication with many parts of the government and the press.[12]

Choi, who had no official government position, was revealed to have access to confidential documents and information from the president, and acted as a close confidante for the president. Choi and President Park's senior staff used their influence to extort ₩77.4 billion (~$774 million) from Korean chaebols – family-owned large business conglomerates – setting up two media and sports-related foundations, the Mir and K-sports foundations.[13][14][15] Choi embezzled money during the process, and it is reported that some of them were used to support her daughter Chung Yoo-ra's dressage activities in Germany. She is also accused of rigging the admissions process at Ewha Womans University to help her daughter get accepted at the university. Ahn Jong-bum, a top presidential aide, was arrested for abusing power and helping Choi; he denied wrongdoing and claims he simply followed presidential orders.[16][17]

On October 25, 2016, Park Geun-hye publicly acknowledged her close ties with Choi. On October 28, Park dismissed key members of her top office staff and Park's opinion rating dropped to 5%, the lowest ever for a sitting South Korean president.[18][19][20][21] Her approval rating ranged from 1 to 3% for Korean citizens under 60 years of age, while it remained higher at 13% for over 60 years age group.[22]

This also prompted President Park to fire members of her cabinet and the prime minister of South Korea in order to redirect the public's criticism. In particular, the sacking of the prime minister Hwang Kyo-ahn resulted in a controversy, due to the claim that his firing had been done via text message.[23][24]


Protests against Park Geun-hye

The revelations about the relationship of Park Geun-hye and Choi Soon-sil have been resulting in mass demonstrations in Seoul,[25][26] also known as the PARK GEUN-HYE RESIGNMENT NATIONWIDE MOVEMENT or CANDLELIGHT REVOLUTION.[27][28] Protesters called for the resignation of Park Geun-hye.[29]

On 19 November, a large number of South Korean high school students also joined the crowds after taking the college entrance test.[34] Not all Koreans were calling for the president to resign, however.

At 7 pm (10:00 GMT) hundreds of yellow balloons were released and the protestors blew out the candles they were carrying as a symbolic gesture asking that Park clarify the mystery surrounding her seven-hour absence at the time of the ferry sinking as people prepared to mark 1000th day anniversary of the Sewol ferry sinking.[43][44]

Presidential hopefuls including provincial governor An Hee-jung and former leader of the main opposition Democratic Party Moon Jae-in attended the anti-Park rally. Rhee In-je of the ruling Saenuri Party attended the pro-Park rally "to be part of the patriotic people's wave," while Ahn Cheol-soo, a former chair of the minor opposition People's Party, did not attend either rally.[48]

After Samsung vice-chairman Lee Jae-Yong was arrested at 17 February by Special Prosecutors on charges of bribery in connection with the scandal, 700,000 people walked to the street on 18 February. Protesters urged the Constitutional Court, currently reviewing the legitimacy of the impeachment, to promptly reach a conclusion for the ouster of the president..

On 25 February, Hundreds of thousands of Koreans held rival demonstrations in Seoul over the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye on the fourth anniversary of her swearing into office. Anti-Park protest organisers claimed a one million turnout and pro-Park supporters said they had attracted three million. The demonstrations come as court prepares to hold final hearing on president's impeachment over corruption scandal.[49][50]

March

After Constitutional court removed Park Geun-hye from power over a corruption scandal, ousted South Korean President Park Geun-hye maintained her silence on Saturday as her opponents and supporters divided the capital's streets with massive rallies that showed a nation deeply split over its future.[51] Carrying flags and candles and cheering jubilantly, tens of thousands of people occupied a boulevard in downtown Seoul to celebrate Park's ouster. Meanwhile, in a nearby grass square, a large crowd of Park's supporters glumly waved national flags near a stage where organizers, wearing red caps and military uniforms, vowed to resist what they are calling "political assassination."

Nearly 20,000 police officers were deployed on Saturday to monitor the protesters, who were also separated by tight perimeters created by hundreds of police buses. They also held Rival rallies on 1 and 4 March respectively.[52]


Impeachment of Park Geun-hye

On 3 December 2016, three opposition parties agreed to introduce a joint impeachment motion against President Park Geun-hye. The motion, which was signed by 171 of 300 lawmakers, was put to a vote on Friday, 9 December 2016, and passed with 234 out of 300 votes, a tally much greater than the required 2/3 majority and which included 62 members of Park's Saenuri Party.[53] The Impeachment process was pending in Constitutional Court of Korea and could take 180 days to decide the legality of Impeachment.

Against Park Geun-hye's opponents trying to oust her, the protesters have organized increasingly large rallies mostly in central Seoul since October 2016, calling for the reinstatement of the president.

Park Geun-hye was finally impeached on 10 March 2017.


Protests to rally for Park Geun-hye

2016

On October 31, 2016, a group of conservative protesters had a protest at the front of the South Korean media JTBC headquarters, claiming its coverage about the scandal as biased and unfounded.[54]

On November 19, 2016, thousands of Park's supporters staged their protests in central Seoul, calling on the president not to succumb to mounting pressure on her to step aside.[55]

On December 17, 2016, the pro-Park protesters blamed the media for fuelling anti-Park sentiment, focusing their coverage too much on the views of younger and liberal voters and on criticism that Park received cosmetic procedures while in office.[56]

2017

Pro-president rallies have grown substantially. On January 14, 2017, the organizers of the protests claim that 1.2 million people gathered in central Seoul, insisting that the Constitutional Court should reject the impeachment.[57]
