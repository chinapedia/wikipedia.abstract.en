_ANIMATION THROWDOWN_ is a free-to-play online collectible card game that combines content and characters from five animated television shows that originally aired on Fox â€“ _Family Guy_, _Futurama_, _American Dad!_, _Bob's Burgers_ and _King of the Hill_. It is available on Google Play[1] , the App Store[2] , Steam,[3] and on the web via Kongregate;[4] all platforms share the same instance and players may use more than one platform to play the same account.

Turn-based gameplay consists of playing cards drawn from a virtual deck into the player's hand onto a tableau to fight against an AI playing cards from its own deck; depending on game mode the AI's deck may be system-generated or may belong to another player. Cards attack the card directly across from them and, if unopposed, attack the opponent's "hero"; the battle is won when the opponent's hero is defeated. A main tactic of card play is to play a character card and object card into the same slot to fuse into a more powerful combination ("combo") that the player has previously learned.

New players start off with a low level starter hero, choosing one of Bob (_Bob's Burgers_), Roger (_American Dad!_), Brian (_Family Guy_), Leela (_Futurama_) and Bobby (_King of the Hill_), and are provided with a collection of starter cards. Game play primarily focuses on earning resources to improve cards and obtain better cards, and to level up heroes and gain access to more powerful heroes; monetization primarily revolves around speeding up access to these improvements and providing access to premium content cards and heroes. Like MMORPGs there is no "win" condition; players who have completed all episodic content generally continue to upgrade their decks to remain competitive with each other.

The game is rated "Teen" on Google Play and similarly on other platforms; card content from the shows sometimes includes mature content such as drinking, drug use, cartoon violence, and sexual innuendo.


Card Structure

Animation-Throwdown-Video-Game-Card-Hip-Hop-Bob.png

An Animation Throwdown card contains a color-coded background, a picture of a character, object, or scene from one of the five shows (some of the lowest level cards are generic), a level indicator, a trait (usually), zero to three skills, and health point and attack strength numbers.

Rarity

Cards can be Common (gray), Rare (green), Epic (blue), Legendary (purple), or Mythic (gold). Higher rarity cards are harder to obtain, stronger, take longer to research, can be upgraded more times, and recycle for better payouts. In addition, within the higher rarity levels some cards can be obtained through earned Stones and some premium cards can only be obtained from purchased Gems.

Types

Cards can be characters from one of the shows, objects (usually from a show), or pre-combined (PC) combos made from a character and an object.

Skills

Cards have between zero and three skills.[5] Some are straightforward, such as Punch (do the specified number of damage points to a randomly selected opposing card), Cripple (reduce the attack strength of a randomly chosen opposing card), or Heal (heal damage to a friendly card.) Others are more indirect, such as Boost (gain attack strength after a friendly combo is played) or Hijack (steal attack gains given to the opposing card). A card's skills may have more of an impact in battle than its base stats.

Skills that affect friendly cards may affect one or all, and may be restricted to cards with the same trait or from the same show. Buffs may be one-time or may affect the duration of the card's presence in that battle.

Traits

Most cards and almost all combos have a Trait, such as Drunk or Athletic. This is considered in:

-   The rotating Battle Ground Effect (BGE) buffs cards with one selected trait.
-   A guild may choose to defend a Siege island that buffs a trait.
-   Some skills affect only cards that have the same trait.

A few combos have two traits, for example combos that depict a character as a high school athlete might have both Educated and Athletic traits.

Upgrades

Cards can be upgraded with Giggitywatts, gaining attack power, health, and sometimes skills. Two identical maxxed out cards can be permanently fused into a single more powerful card; these can in turn be upgraded and fused into a quadruple ("quad") fused card.

Max level by rarity:

-   Common - 3
-   Rare - 4
-   Epic - 5
-   Legendary - 6

Mythic cards are upgraded through a separate system where Mythic Stones are turned into card-specific shards that are used to acquire or upgrade that one Mythic.


Heroes

Twenty-three different characters from the shows can be unlocked and assigned as heroes to defend; each gains a different set of skills as it is upgraded. Heroes are improved automatically after acquiring sufficient matching tokens, primarily from Arena battles, but also from event rewards and login bonuses. The first 15 heroes are unlocked by progressing through Arena levels; premium heroes are available as store purchases or some can be slowly unlocked and upgraded via random token awards. (It is possible to upgrade a hero that you have not yet unlocked for use.)

There are quests for upgrading a hero (any hero) to most of the levels, up to the highest level, 15.


Decks

Battles are fought with a deck of 25 to 35 cards chosen from the player's collection supporting one of the player's available heroes. Players have up to ten slots to build decks tuned for different purposes (for example a player may build a deck to fight general battles, assign a different deck to Rumble defense, use a third deck to attack or defend a themed Siege island, and use another slot to build a deck for a future event. Special-BGE challenges generally require a special deck for best results.)

Once cards have been played and defeated they are removed from the battle; there is no reshuffling. It is possible, though rare, to lose a protracted battle by running out of cards in your deck.

In the deck maintenance interface players move cards in and out of the chosen deck one at a time until they are satisfied with the results. This is also where cards are upgraded or recycled.


Research and Combos

Players can Research the ability to temporarily combine a character and an object in one slot of their tableau; the resulting combo will belong to the same show as the character and will generally have the same trait as the object. For example, Legendary Eugene Belcher (Bob's Burgers, Musical) combines with Legendary Terrestrial Cycling (Futurama, Athletic) to form Legendary Gaga Ball (Bob's Burgers, Athletic); making Gaga Ball with either the Rare Gene card or a different object is a separate combo that must also be researched before being used.[6]

Combo Mastery, introduced in June 2018, allows a player to buff a combo by 10, 20, or 30%, and to automatically research all current and future variants of that combo. Every day, tokens for four (or rarely six) random combos are for sale in the Shop, two for Gems and two for Mastery Stones; each set of ten tokens bought on the same day costs progressively more. Tokens are also available in themed Tier Boxes.


Game Modes

Play in all game modes is the same tableau-based card battle, differing only in details of which side goes first, scoring, rewards, and card buffs in play. The sequence of a turn is:

-   Player or the AI plays a card, either dropping a card from their hand into the leftmost empty slot, playing a character to combine with a previously played object, or playing an object to combine with a character.
-   Global effects (such as a BGE) are applied to eligible cards
-   Hero skills, if any, are applied in order from the top down.
-   From left to right, each card triggers its skills and makes its attack. Cards newly played into empty slots are skipped, but freshly-created combos will act.
-   If the other hero is not defeated, the other side gets a turn.

(A few skills have special timing.)

Animation-Throwdown-Video-Game-Card-Adventure-Battle.png

Most game modes follow the global rotating Battle Ground Effect (BGE), where cards with one trait get buffed for 30 days. Buffs may be as simple as increased attack strength and health points or as complex as adding two skills. BGEs are staggered and overlap; there are one or two BGEs in effect at any given time. When a new BGE begins, new cards and combos are generally released, and loot boxes featuring new and old cards from that BGE rotate into the shop. Most spending in the game is driven by the desire to acquire new cards to be competitive in a new BGE.

Adventure

Adventure mode presents a set of islands representing three scenes from the same show episode. Players face a deck themed around the characters and situations from that scene, and get Nixon coins as a reward for winning. After the deck has been defeated once, the next scene or island is unlocked. Defeating the same scene three times rewards four Common cards and Bronze mastery; the next sets of three wins gain Silver mastery (two Rare cards), Gold mastery (one Epic card), and Onyx mastery (another copy of the same Epic card). After the same scene has been defeated 14 times, at progressively greater difficulty, it transitions into farming mode where it pays out Nixons, plus a random amount of Giggitywatts and Golden Turds (see Currencies section).

Energy points refresh every ten minutes, up to a cap determined by the player's level; there are several purchasable ways to increase the cap significantly. Energy can be refilled for gems, though refills can be earned in many ways. Battles cost between one and ten points to play.

When the game was first released scenes could be farmed for a chance to earn copies of a specific Epic card; some older strategy guides still reference this.

To make farming less tedious, Adventure and Arena modes have an autoplay button where a single tap or click will trigger automatic play of the entire battle.

Arena

In the Arena players are matched against the decks of other players. Energy points are refreshed every hour and a half to a maximum of ten; refills can be earned or bought with gems. It costs one energy point to fight a battle at any level. Winning gets a reward of Nixon coins, arena ranking increase, arena win tokens, and possibly hero tokens (experience points towards leveling up a specific one of the player's heroes.) At the highest Arena level, "Secret Fight Club", players can also win Super Epic Stones. There is a ten percent bonus for winning consecutive battles, to a maximum of ten wins.

Most Clashes are only unlocked for players in the Secret Fight Club.

Every three days there is a payout based on the number of arena win tokens, which are then reset. Even a low-ranked player can place highly by saving up refills and playing a large number of battles in a few days. While the Arena cycles are given themed names such as "American Dad Brawl", these have no effect on gameplay.

Refillable Challenge

On a cyclic basis players face a challenge[7] against progressively harder opponents matching a limited theme (for example the Hilloween Challenge presents progressively stronger versions of the Devil Bobby and Devil Hank cards from the King of the Hill Hilloween episode). Players get eight use-or-lose energy points a day to fight these battles, with better rewards (Challenge tokens) as they defeat higher levels; for two hundred gems they can refill the day's energy to potentially reach a higher overall event score. This challenge resets every six days, with a final payout based on relative ranking. After each reset players start from the beginning, fighting the weakest versions of the next challenge's opponents for the lowest rewards.

Non-Refillable Challenge

On a cyclic basis players face a challenge against the decks of other players. Scoring is based on performance, with three points for winning with all cards and hero at perfect health and one or two points for winning with more damage taken; Challenge tokens are awarded based on current point score. Three points are deducted for a loss, or two points for quitting a battle. This challenge resets every four days, with a final payout based on relative ranking. After each reset players start from the beginning, fighting the weakest player decks for the lowest rewards.

Siege

Every week there is a Siege, where Guild members distribute themselves into the defense of five themed islands, on each of which cards with a certain trait or from a certain show get a small buff to attack strength and health points. After a setup window players have 24 hours to complete 10 battles against randomly chosen opponents from among those defending their choice of the five opponent islands. The guild scores ten points for a win, one point for a loss, and a thousand points if an island is defeated entirely (10 wins for each player defending the island).

Stronger guilds put significant effort into choosing a set of island traits to defend, assigning players to move from their random starting spots to the desired island, creating personal decks tuned to defend that island, and then working together as a team to maximize the number of opposing islands that are completely defeated. (An island defended by the four strongest players in a guild may be harder to defeat than one defended by the fourteen weakest.)

All guild members who have completed at least one battle get the same reward, based on the guild's long-term ranking. If the guild loses, members get only ten percent of the reward.

The Guild leader must opt in for the guild to participate in a Siege.

Rumble

Every three weeks there is a Rumble, where Guilds face a sequence of opposing Guilds and rise and fall in the rankings. Once a match has been made members have 12 hours to fight 10 battles against randomly selected members of the opponent guild. Scoring of each battle is not winner-take-all, but percentage points are assigned based on how much damage a player's tableau takes before winning, or how much it inflicts before losing.

All guild members get a payout based on the guild's final ranking, though players with below average individual contributions may get a reduced payout.

The Guild leader must opt in for the guild to participate in a Rumble.

Clashes

Clashes run every few weeks. A small set of rarely-used combos are strongly buffed, and players get a few battles a day against other players' decks. Super Mythic stones and Mythic object stones are given as milestone awards for progress, and there are payouts for the top thousand players overall at the end.

Before each Clash, Tier boxes are made available in the store for players to purchase a random selection from a group of Legendary and Epic cards that make up the buffed combos, and a random selection of Mastery tokens for them. Top-level players spend hundreds of dollars worth of gems to create strong decks for these four-day events.

SWOLE

The SWOLE challenge, named after the S.W.O.L.E. gym in Futurama, runs a few times a year. Players have one or two weeks to unlock buffs to specific shows and skills, to face off against progressively more massively buffed system opponents. Rewards are high, notably shards to unlock new Mythic cards not available through other channels.


Quests

Progress Quests

New players are given a set of quests that form a game tutorial, teaching mechanics such as researching and playing combos, recycling and upgrading cards, etc. (The first few quests include helpful explanations from Family Guy title character Peter Griffin.) As quests are completed, more challenging ones are unlocked; completing all of the quests requires progressing through most of Arena and Adventure mode, and generally takes many months of gameplay. Quest rewards can be as small as five hundred Nixon Coins or as large as a Legendary card.

Daily Quests

Every day, players are given a set of simple objectives with small rewards; most of them are naturally achieved with a few minutes of normal gameplay. As of April 2019 the daily quests are:

-   Play 5 combos
-   Acquire three new cards
-   Upgrade cards three times (can be three levels of upgrade to the same card)
-   Fight three Arena battles
-   Fight ten Arena battles
-   Fight a battle with a deck whose hero is a character from King of the Hill

After completing five of the daily quests there is a small Gem payout.


Guilds

At level 3 players unlock the ability to join a guild, and get a quest offering a small reward for doing so.

Guilds provide a social play experience for up to 50 players, and offer small in-game benefits and optional access to Rumble and Siege events. Nixon Coin payouts from Arena and Adventure are improved slightly based on the number of active players in the guild. Guild members cannot help each other directly, but a strong guild can help its members earn significant rewards from collective Siege and Rumble rewards.

Each guild has an in-game chat channel and a private discussion forum; some guilds supplement this with an external chat system.


Currencies

There are multiple currencies used in the game:

-   Cash (real-world money of the player's local currency) is spent in the store on gems, gem/item bundles, VIP subscriptions, and items such as the Research Accelerator.
-   Gems are mostly purchased with cash (and to a lesser extent from partner offers), and are used to buy premium card packs, Combo Mastery tokens, speedups of various game timers, Mom's random loot boxes, and extra plays in Challenges.
-   Nixon Coins, showing the living head of Richard M. Nixon in a jar from Futurama, are earned in Arena and Adventure mode, and from event rewards. They are primarily used to buy random (mostly common) cards from the Shop.
-   Giggitywatts, a nod to Family Guy character Quagmire's signature exclamation "Giggity!", are primarily earned by recycling cards or farming Adventure mode, and spent to upgrade cards. Upgraded cards recycle for more Giggitywatts, though there is never a full return on the investment.
-   Golden Turds, showing a priceless gem-studded turd from a recurring American Dad bit, are primarily earned by farming Adventure mode. They are used to buy random (mostly Epic, sometimes Legendary) cards with the current BGE Trait.
-   Stones of various sorts are spent to acquire matching cards; for example Legendary Stones are earned from daily login rewards and event payouts, and often included in cash purchase bundles. A thousand Legendary stones can be used to acquire a random Legendary card from the lowest tier.
-   Mastery Stones, earned in significant quantities from high level event rewards and in a slow trickle from daily quest rewards, can be used to purchase the day's random Combo Mastery tokens from the shop.
-   Challenge Coins, depicting arcade tokens from the Wonder Wharf amusement park on Bob's Burgers, are earned from Challenge battles and Challenge event payouts. They can purchase tokens towards leveling up a random hero or SEPs (Super Epic Packs, packages of three cards with a minimum quality of two common and one Epic).


Monetization

There are three main monetization tracks in the game:

-   Cash purchases give players a commanding advantage in gameplay, as ongoing gem purchases enable players to acquire the newest and most powerful cards. Top level players spend hundreds or thousands of dollars a month to maintain their positions.[8]
-   Ads provide a revenue stream. Ads are not served as an interruption in gameplay; players choose when to view ads to unlock certain objects or improve Nixon earnings.
-   A partner "offer wall" through IronSource gives players the opportunity to earn gems by trying other apps or making online purchases through partners.


Official Forum

The official game forum is hosted on Kongregate,[9] with significant participation by game representatives.

Regular official topics include:

-   Announcements of upcoming BGEs and special events
-   Software release notes
-   Development roadmap
-   Solicitations of ideas for new card content
-   Solicitations of feedback on game events and "Quality of Life" UI issues
-   Weekly gem giveaway, and occasional other contests

Regular player-initiated topics include:

-   Guilds looking for players, and players looking for guilds
-   Bug reports
-   Suggestions for new features
-   Complaints about denied offer wall payouts
-   Analysis of cards, combos, and gameplay tactics

In April 2019, massive criticism of an announced addition of Clash-like special combos to the next Rumble event (mostly focused on the dramatic pay-to-win advantages) led to the feature being withdrawn.


Criticisms

-   Overwhelming "pay-to-win" advantages
-   Power creep
-   Events that primarily reward "whales"
-   Unreleased content made available exclusively to the highest-spending players [10]
-   High rate of offer wall rejections after completing requirements
-   Cheating scandals
-   Drop rates not published for loot boxes or other random elements of the game; as of April 2019 the developers had been promising to release this information "soon" for 16 months.[11][12]
-   Ease of making inadvertent gem purchases, especially of items of low perceived value such as Rare cards and easily obtained energy refills.
