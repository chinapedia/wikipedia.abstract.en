LUCY DACUS (born May 2, 1995) is an American indie rock singer-songwriter from Richmond, Virginia.[1][2] She has released two critically acclaimed albums: _No Burden_ (2016) and _Historian_ (2018). In 2018, she formed boygenius with Phoebe Bridgers and Julien Baker.


Early life

Dacus grew up in the suburbs of Richmond, Virginia.[3] She graduated from Maggie L. Walker Governor's School and began studying film at Virginia Commonwealth University but left to pursue her music career.[4]


Career

Dacus first performed in New York City in March 2015.[5] Her first single, "I Don't Wanna Be Funny Anymore," premiered in November 2015. Her debut album, _No Burden_, was produced in Nashville by her hometown friends, Berklee College of Music graduate Collin Pastore and Oberlin Conservatory of Music graduate Jacob Blizard, and was originally released digitally, on CD, and on vinyl via Richmond's EggHunt Records on February 26, 2016. _No Burden_ was engineered and mixed by Collin Pastore.[6][7] Dacus was then signed to Matador Records, who re-released the album on September 9, 2016.[8][9][10] In the same year she performed at Lollapalooza, in Chicago's Grant Park, as well as making her national television debut on _CBS This Morning_.[11] She recorded a Tiny Desk Concert for NPR the same weekend.[12] In October 2016 she played the London Calling festival in Amsterdam, as a replacement for The Duke Spirit, who were forced to cancel.[13]

Dacus' second album, entitled _Historian_, was released on March 2, 2018.[14] Like its predecessor, it was met with widespread critical acclaim. Writing for Pitchfork, Sasha Gessen praised its nuance and sensitivity: " It’s not an easy album to wear out. It lasts, and it should, given that so many of its lyrics pick at time, and the way time condenses around deep emotional attachments to other people." _Rolling Stone_ rated the album 4/5 stars, as did NME. _Historian_, like _No Burden_, was recorded in Nashville, at Trace Horse Studio, in a similar collaborative effort by Lucy Dacus, Jacob Blizard, and Collin Pastore.

In September 2016, Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Kaine stated in an interview that Dacus was a "new favorite."[15][16] In a 2019 interview, Dacus revealed that she had attended kindergarten with Kaine's daughter and that she considers him to be an old family friend.[17]

In 2018, Dacus, along with Phoebe Bridgers and Julien Baker, formed the supergroup boygenius. They released three songs in August 2018 and subsequently announced an EP and a tour.[18] The EP, titled _boygenius_, came out on October 26, 2018.

To coincide with Valentine's Day 2019, Dacus released a cover of La Vie En Rose, the first in a planned series of songs commemorating major holidays.[19]


Personal life

Dacus is friends with singer-songwriter and fellow Matador signee Julien Baker, whom she has opened for several times following their first show together in Washington, DC. Dacus explained their common attachment in an interview with NPR in 2016: "She's 20, I'm 21. We were both raised Christian. She's a lesbian, I'm kind of queer and we just have so many of the same backstory situations. Being from Southern cities, having the same kind of interest for humans and ideas about why anyone would ever make art — it's one of those things where you expect to talk for two hours and then you talk for twelve".[20]
