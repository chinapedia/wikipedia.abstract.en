STORY UNTOLD (formerly known as AMASIC) is a rock band based in Montreal. Founded in 2012, the band has been signed with Hopeless Records since May 2016.[1] Shortly after their signing and their recording of their self-titled EP, they went on tour with Simple Plan and Hit the Lights.[2]


History

Origins

The group was formed in 2009 originally as a solo act, under the name Amasic. Janick Thibault played everything until 2012, then he sang and was rhythm guitarist. He brought his longtime friend, Matt McCormack as bassist and co-vocalist, Mehdi Zidani on drums and Jessy Bergy on lead guitar. The band first started being promoted aside from Thibault was through BryanStars by Bryan posting the band's music videos on his channel. The four were influenced heavily by punk rock and pop punk bands such as Blink-182, Simple Plan, and Green Day. In 2016 they signed to Hopeless Records and started touring under a new name, Story Untold.

McCormack left the band by 2016, and the band soon hired two new band members. Guitarist, Max Roll took over as rhythm guitarist, so Thibault could focus more on singing, then bassist Simon Lepage took over the vacancy McCormack left behind.

It was an amazing learning experience for us and we were blown away by their music knowledge and talent! That being said, thanks to all of you who are reading this right now and make sure you stay tuned 'cause things are about to get rad!"
