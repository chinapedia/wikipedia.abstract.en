Early history

In 1900, D.B. Contes, a cotton buyer from central Texas, moved into the area along Holly Creek off the Big Sandy Creek in this area of Wood County. During World War I and the Great Depression, Contes leased and sold hunting and fishing rights to city residents in 2,700 acre holdings around what would become Holly Lake.

Holly Creek was later dammed to make a place for what is now Holly Lake, and cabins were erected at the lake and along Big Sandy Creek.[4]


Expansion and Development

In 1964, Contes sold his interest to E.G. Rodman, an oilman from Odessa, Texas. Rodman built a large home on the lake, and purchased additional land to add to the original 2,700 acres. The cattle ranch the acquisition formed was named Holly Lake Ranch. In December 1969, Dallas real estate developers Bill McKenzie and Jack Wilson executed a contract to purchase the 4,165 acre Holly Lake Ranch property Rodman had assembled. Alex McKenzie and Allen Campbell were financial backers of the project which was named Holly Lake Development Company.

Holly Lake Development company began the development and execution of a master plan. Today, that master plan is largely reflected in the design of Holly Lake Ranch.

An administration building, restaurant, activity center, and condominiums were developed in 1972 and 1973.[5]


Current Status

The Holly Lake Ranch condominiums are today managed by Holiday Inn Resorts.
