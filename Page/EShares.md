CARTA (formerly eShares, Inc.) is a Palo Alto based technology company that specializes in capitalization table management and valuation software. Carta was founded in 2012 by Henry Ward and Manu Kumar. Manu Kumar originally came up with the idea and recruited Henry to be the CEO. Their system digitizes paper stock certificates along with stock options, warrants, and derivatives to create a real-time picture of who owns what at a startup.
