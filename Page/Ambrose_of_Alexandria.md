AMBROSE OF ALEXANDRIA (before 212 – c. 250) was a friend of the Christian theologian Origen. Ambrose was attracted by Origen's fame as a teacher, and visited the Catechetical School of Alexandria in 212. At first a gnostic Valentinian and Marcionist, Ambrose, through Origen's teaching, eventually rejected this theology and became Origen's constant companion,[1] and was ordained deacon.[2][3] He plied Origen with questions, and urged him to write his Commentaries () on the books of the Bible, and, as a wealthy nobleman and courtier,[4] he provided his teacher with books for his studies and secretaries to lighten the labor of composition.[5]

He suffered during the persecution under the Roman emperor Maximinus Thrax in 235.[6] He was later released and died a confessor.[7] The last mention of Ambrose in the historical record is in Origen's _Contra Celsum,_ which the latter wrote at the solicitation of Ambrose.

Origen often speaks of Ambrose in affectionately as a man of education with excellent literary and scholarly tastes. All of Origen's works written after 218 are dedicated to Ambrose, including his _On Martyrdom_, _Contra Celsum_, _Commentary on St. John's Gospel_, and _On Prayer_.[8] Ambrose's letters to Origen (praised by Jerome) are lost, although part of one exists.[9]


Veneration

Ambrose is venerated as a saint by some branches of Christianity. His feast day in the Catholic Church falls on 17 March.[10]
