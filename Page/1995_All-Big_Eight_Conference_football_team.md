The 1995 ALL-BIG EIGHT CONFERENCE FOOTBALL TEAM consists of American football players chosen by various organizations for All-Big Eight Conference teams for the 1995 NCAA Division I-A football season. The selectors for the 1995 season included the Associated Press (AP) and the Big Eight Conference coaches (Coaches). The 1995 team was the final All-Big Eight football team due to the conference's merger in 1996 with four teams from the Southwest Conference to form the Big 12 Conference.[1] Four teams from the Big Eight Conference finished among the top ten in the final AP Poll of the 1995 season, and players from those teams dominated the All-Big Eight selections. The four ranked teams were:

-   The 1995 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team (12–0), led by head coach Tom Osborne, won the national championship and led the conference with 15 players who received first- or second-team honors. Three Nebraska players were consensus first-team selections by both the AP and the Coaches: quarterback Tommie Frazier; defensive tackle Christian Peter; and defensive back Tyrone Williams.
-   The 1995 Colorado Buffaloes football team (10–2), led by head coach Rick Neuheisel, was ranked No. 5 in the final AP Poll and had 11 players who received first- or second-team All-Big Eight honors. Four Colorado players were consensus first-team selections: wide receiver Rae Carruth; offensive linemen Chris Naeole and Heath Irwin; and linebacker Matt Russell.
-   The 1995 Kansas State Wildcats football team (10–2), led by head coach Bill Snyder, was ranked No. 7 in the final AP Poll and had nine players who received All-Big Eight honors. Defensive lineman Tim Colston and defensive back Chris Canty were consensus first-team selections.
-   The 1995 Kansas Jayhawks football team (10–2), led by head coach Glen Mason, was ranked No. 9 in the final AP Poll and had nine players who received All-Big Eight honors. Offensive lineman Chris Banks and defensive back Dorian Brew were consensus first-team selections.

Troy Davis of Iowa State and David Thompson of Oklahoma State were the consensus first-team running backs. Stephen Alexander of Oklahoma was the consensus first-team tight end.
