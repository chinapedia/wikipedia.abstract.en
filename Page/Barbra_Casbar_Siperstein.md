Biography

Siperstein, born November 20,[3] 1942,[4] grew up in Jersey City, New Jersey.[5] She knew from early childhood that she was different, but did not fully recognize she was transgender until middle age.[6] Siperstein told her wife that she was transgender in the late 1980s. For most of her life Siperstein denied to herself that she was transgender, until she eventually came out to her wife who was extremely supportive.[7] They created _Casbar_ as a combination of Carol's initials and _Barbra_, then Barry's name.[8] Carol encouraged her to be openly outwardly female, and Barbra began to transition in small steps.[9] Barbra was openly transgender with her family, but did not come out publicly until around 2000, when she began her activism in earnest.[10][11] She was outed by a local newspaper, and continued to transition in strides.[12] Barbra's wife Carol died in 2001.[13][14][15] Barbra has said that she channeled her grief about her wife's death into her activist work.[16] Eight years after Carol's death, Barbra changed her Hebrew name officially to a female name after a teshuva on the status of transgender people in the Jewish faith allowed her to do so. Siperstein started her activism fully after her daughter took over her family business.[17]

Prior to transitioning, Siperstein served in the Army and was a small-business owner.[18] Siperstein advocated for marriage equality, workplace discrimination reforms, and amendments to discrimination laws in order to better protect transgender people.

She was also appointed to the New Jersey Civil Union Review Commission.[22] Siperstein had served as Deputy Vice Chair of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee. She was also Political Director of the Gender Rights Advocacy Association of New Jersey.[23][24][25]
