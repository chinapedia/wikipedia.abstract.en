The MEN'S COXED FOUR competition at the 1968 Summer Olympics took place at Virgilio Uribe Rowing and Canoeing Course, Mexico City, Mexico. It was held from 13 to 19 October and was unexpectedly won by the team from New Zealand, which secured the country its first Olympic rowing medal.


Background

At the 1964 Summer Olympics, the men's coxed four event was won by the United Team of Germany. It was the last appearance of the German United Team. The 1962 World Rowing Championships had been won by the team from West Germany, and the 1966 World Rowing Championships had been won by East Germany. The West Germans had come second at the 1965 European Rowing Championships. The crew from the Soviet Union also belonged to the group of favourites, as they had won the last three European Rowing Championships and gained silver at the 1966 World Rowing Championships. A further medal contender was Italy, who had several previous Olympians in their boat.[1] The New Zealand team had originally been selected as four rowers and a cox as a backup to the country's eight that had qualified. They started training together in Christchurch on the Avon River and gained the impression that they had the potential to win a medal as a coxed four. There were stern discussions with the New Zealand selectors but in the end, the rowers got their way and were put forward as a team of their own.[2]

Races were held in up to six lanes. Thirteen teams from 13 nations attended the competition.[3]


Results

Heats

Three heats were rowed on 13 October; these were the first three rowing races of the 1968 Summer Olympics. Two of the heats had four teams and one had five teams, with the first three teams to qualify for the semi-finals, and the remaining teams progressing to the repechage.[4]

Final

The final (now termed A final) was raced on 19 October. The New Zealand team unexpectedly beat the team from East Germany by over two seconds. In another surprise, the Swiss boat overtook the Italians for the bronze medal position. The win secured New Zealand its first Olympic rowing gold, and its third Olympic rowing medal in total.[7] The Olympic competition was the first time that the team had raced together.[8] The medals were presented by IOC vice-president Konstantin Adrianow.
