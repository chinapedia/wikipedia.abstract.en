SHOAL CREEK is a stream in southeastern Crawford County in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] It is a tributary of Huzzah Creek.

The stream headwaters arise in the southeast corner of Crawford County just west of Missouri Route Y (at [2]) and only about two miles north of the mine at Viburnum in the northwest corner of Iron County.[3] The stream flows north to north-northwest to its confluence with Huzzah Creek just south of Huzzah (at [4]).[5]

Shoal Creek was named for the fact it is flat and shallow like a shoal.[6]
