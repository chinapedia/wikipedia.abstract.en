_MISSION MUMMY_ (), is a 2016 Indian children and family drama film, written and directed by Ashish Kakkad and produced by Nigam Shah, Divyesh Mehta & Sugam Shah. It stars Aarti Patel, Raj Vazir, Satyam Sharma, Aashna Mehta & Saumya Shah in lead roles. This is the second film by Ashish Kakkad, after _Better Half_.[1] _Mission Mummy_ is produced under the banner of Virtual Entertainment. It is also co-produced by Ashish Kakkad. The story of the film is based on a book by Dhiruben Patel. The screenplay and dialogues are written by Dipak Soliya and Ashish Kakkad. The film celebrates the idea of "being Gujarati" and hence poet and lyricist Tushar Shukla was approached for a song portraying the love for the mother tongue.


Plot

Aparna (Aarti Patel), a working woman, quits her job to become a full-time mother. She raises her three kids Vyom (Satyam Sharma), Saloni (Aashna Mehta) and Vismay (Saumya Shah), with much love and care, and now that the kids are grownups, she is wondering if she should resume her career. Over the years, she has devoted her time and sacrificed her career for her children. But the kids now find her "old fashioned" and start to visualize a new image of her on their own. They demand their mother to be a modern and trendy lady. When Aparna wants to resume her career, the kids gradually intensify their demand to make mummy a modern woman. Their definition of modern is simple: everything has to be "western" and not "Gujarati". Aparna tries to pacify them but peer pressure makes the kids more resolute in their demand for a modern mummy. They call it "mission mummy". The mission is then implemented and everything changes in that family, forever.

The film beautifully touches on the important issue that in "happy families" of Gujarati community, there is a "set trend" of growing gap between mother and kids. It is not just a schism between the generations, it is a gap between the culture within the house and the culture outside. The strength of this film is that it presents a serious issue in a light-hearted and vibrant manner.[2]
