The first season of the reality television series _Love & Hip Hop: New York_ aired on VH1 from March 6, 2011 until May 2, 2011. The show was primarily filmed in New York City, New York. It was executively produced by Mona Scott-Young for Monami Entertainment, Toby Barraud and Stefan Springman for NFGTV, Kenny Hull for Interloc Films, and Jim Ackerman and Jeff Olde for VH1.

The series chronicles the lives of several women and men in the New York area, involved in hip hop music. It consists of 9 episodes, including a reunion special hosted by Angie Martinez.


Production

The series was first mentioned in VH1's programming development report in early 2010 as _Diary of a Hip Hop Girlfriend_.[1] On January 4, 2011, VH1 announced that _Love & Hip Hop_ would make its series premiere on March 6, 2011, as an eight episode series.[2] The first season was later expanded to nine episodes to include the first season reunion, which aired on May 16, 2011.[3] The series would star Jim Jones' girlfriend Chrissy Lampkin, Fabolous's girlfriend Emily Bustamante, Olivia Longott and aspiring rapper Somaya Reece, with Jim Jones, his mother Nancy Jones, Somaya's manager Maurice Aguilar and Olivia's manager Rich Dollaz in supporting roles. Swiss Beatz's ex-wife Mashonda would appear in a minor supporting role.

The season was released on DVD in region 1 on June 26, 2012.[4]


Synopsis

Chrissy has been with rapper Jim Jones for six years but she is struggling to take their relationship to the next level. Emily has been with rapper Fabolous for eight years and has a son by him, however, he still refuses to claim her in public as anything but his stylist. Olivia is a R&B singer desperate to get back in the limelight after a series of career misfires. Somaya is a Latina rapper who has recently arrived in New York City, hungry to kickstart her music career.

When Somaya pursues Jim to collaborate on a track, she ignites a feud with Chrissy. The two get into a huge argument at a yacht party. When Somaya's manager Maurice makes reference to Jim's alleged money issues during the fight, Jim comes after him on the streets of New York. Blaming Olivia for the entire fiasco, Somaya puts her on blast in an online interview, angering Olivia's manager Rich. Meanwhile, under the advice of Mashonda, whose ex-husband Swiss Beatz famously left for Alicia Keys, Emily contemplates leaving Fab for good. Chrissy takes matters into her own hands and proposes to Jim, provoking a violent meltdown from his mother Nancy.
