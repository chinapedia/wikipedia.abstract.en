Until it died out in 1347, the family was able to establish itself firmly in the region of Franconian Switzerland and turned out to be unwelcome competition for the bishops of Bamberg. The Schlüsselbergs founded _inter alia_ the town of a number of Schlüsselfeld in 1336 as well as Schlüsselau Abbey.
