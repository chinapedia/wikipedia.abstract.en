The LEE RUBBER BUILDING () is a historical building in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.


History

The building was constructed in 1930 with a grey color facade. Upon completion, it was the tallest building in Kuala Lumpur at that time. In 1942-1945, the building was used by the Japanese government as the headquarter of Japanese secret police during World War II. In 1950s, an additional floor was added to the structure, making it a five-story building. In 2003, Popular bookshop opened for operation in the building.[1] The building was put up for sale in 2015; the Popular bookstore and the Kasturi tuition centre upstairs vacated the building several months later as a result.[2] Nevertheless, Kuala Lumpur City Hall by-laws prohibit the demolition or significant structural alteration to the heritage building.
