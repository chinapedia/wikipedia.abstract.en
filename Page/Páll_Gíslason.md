PÁLL GÍSLASON (1924-2004) a medical practitioner in Reykjavik, served as the Chief Scout of the Bandalag íslenskra skáta, the Icelandic Scout association, from 1971 to 1981.

Gíslason became a Scout at the age of 12 in 1936, and led his national association in the 1950s. He led Iceland's delegation of 23 young people to the 6th World Scout Jamboree in 1947. The story is told that as he was looking for land in eastern Iceland to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Scouts of Iceland in 1962, he exclaimed that he did not know anyone on that side the island, "because farmers are never sick!", however when a farmer needed his care, he allowed Gíslason to use his land for the celebration.

In 1981, Gíslason was awarded the 144th _Bronze Wolf_, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting.[1]
