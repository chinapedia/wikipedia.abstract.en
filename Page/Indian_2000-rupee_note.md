The INDIAN 2000-RUPEE BANKNOTE (₹2000) is a denomination of the Indian rupee. It was released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 8 November 2016 after the demonetisation of ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes and has been in circulation since 10 November 2016.[1] It is a part of the Mahatma Gandhi New Series of banknotes with a completely new design.

This is the highest currency note printed by RBI that is in active circulation, ever since the 1,000 rupee note was demonetised in November 2016.[2][3][4] Before the official announcement by RBI, the media reported that ₹2000 notes had been printed from the currency printing press in Mysuru by the end of October 2016.[5] Post 2016 Indian banknote demonetisation, five new currency notes have been announced by the Reserve Bank of India-- ₹2,000, ₹500, ₹200, ₹50, and ₹10.[6][7]

According to the RBI data, there were 3,285 million pieces of Rs 2000 notes in circulation at end-March 2017. A year after (on March 31, 2018), there was only a marginal increase in the number at 3,363 million pieces. Of the total currency in circulation amounting to Rs 18,037 billion at end-March 2018, Rs 2000 notes accounted for 37.3 percent, down from 50.2 percent at end-March 2017.[8]


Design

The new 2000 banknote is a 66 mm × 166 mm Magenta coloured note, with the obverse side featuring a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi, the Ashoka Pillar Emblem, and the signature of Reserve Bank of India Governor. It has Braille print on it, to assist the visually challenged in identifying the currency. The reverse side features a motif of the Mangalyaan, representing India's first interplanetary space mission, and the logo and tag line for Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.[9]
