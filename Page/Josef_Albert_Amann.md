For several years he worked as an assistant at the university women's clinic in Munich, receiving his habilitation in 1892. In 1898 he succeeded his father as head of the second gynecological department at the Allgemeine Krankenhaus in Munich. In 1905 he became an associate professor at the university.[1][2]

He held a particular interest in the anatomy and histology of female genitalia. In 1897 he published _Kurzgefasstes Lehrbuch der mikroskopisch-gynäkologischen Diagnostik_, an influential textbook of microscopic gynecological diagnostics.[3] Also, he is credited with introducing a surgery for creation of an artificial vagina in cases of congenital absence ("Amann's operation").[4]
