Production

Lesâ€™ Copaque managing director, Burhanuddin Md Radzi said that the idea to produce live-action film based on this popular animation came across since 2013. The film was shot and completed in the same year but was not released due to many technical issues. Returning from a much loss of that film production, the studio continued to make progress and a new film was shot in October 2014. Taking one month to complete, he satisfied with the result and hoped it will be well received by the audience. [3]
