BRETT CAIRNS is a retired Canadian Air Force general who served Canada with distinction from 1973 to 2008. He also served with United States Armed Forces for 10 years of that 35-year period.


Family and early life

Brett was a third generation military officer whose early life was heavily influenced by his father and grandfather. His grandfather earned his wings with the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War, and his father flew with the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War.

His grandfather James Robertson Cairns joined the Canadian Air Force (1920-24) in 1920, and was the 47th person to join the Royal Canadian Air Force when it formed in 1924. His grandfather participated in an aerial survey operation conducted between July 18 and August 14, 1924, that was described in the 1924 Canadian Report on Aviation as "the greatest ever undertaken for aerial survey, and, when considered in light of the practical results, is one of the most brilliant achievements in the history of flying." The operation covered 15,000 square miles of area in northern Saskatchewan and Manitoba and he took over 1700 photographs from an altitude of 5,000 feet from a Vickers Viking. This aerial operation and the crew were featured on pages 188 to 190 of Aviation in Canada by Larry Milberry.[1][2] The Government of Manitoba announced, on August 6, 1974, the designation of in commemoration of his early aerial survey work.

His father Norman Douglas Cairns joined the RCAF in 1942 and flew the Supermarine Spitfire during the Second World War. He flew 30 different aircraft and logged 11,144 flying hours over the course of his career. He was also a test pilot and he tested the Northrop F-5 for Canada in 1965 at Edwards Air Force Base. Near the end of his career he established the Air Cadet Gliding Program at Mountain View, Ontario in 1965.[3] His father was the driving force behind, and did much of the early fundraising and planning for, the establishment of the RCAF museum which over time evolved into the National Air Force Museum of Canada [4] located at Trenton Ontario.

Brett began his leadership development as a member of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets at the age of 11 and achieved the rank of Squadron Warrant Officer of his Air Cadet Squadron at the age of 16. He was awarded a one-month trip to the Netherlands in 1973 as part of an Air Cadet League of Canada Exchange program. In high school he played many sports, while also racing snowmobiles (won the World Series qualifier at the Peterborough Kawartha Cup in 1973 [5]) and Enduro go-karts (broke the track record at Mosport Park in 1974 which is now called Canadian Tire Motorsport Park [6]), and building high performance automobiles. He graduated from high school as an Ontario Scholar in 1973.
