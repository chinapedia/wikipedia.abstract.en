ANDREW GONSALVES (born 31 May 1978) is a former Guyanese cricketer who represented Guyana and West Indies B in West Indian domestic cricket. He played as a right-handed opening batsman.

Gonsalves was born in Suddie, in Guyana's Pomeroon-Supenaam region.[1] He made his senior debut for Guyana in the 1997–98 Red Stripe Bowl, scoring 54 runs against Canada opening the batting with West Indies international Clayton Lambert.[2] Gonsalves made his first-class debut for Guyana in February 2000, against the Windward Islands.[3] Later in the year, he scored two half-centuries in the 2000–01 Red Stripe Bowl, making 65 against the Leeward Islands and 71 against Bermuda.[4] For the 2000–01 Busta Cup, Gonsalves was selected for West Indies B, a development team. He played in seven matches, but had little success with the bat, making only a single half-century.[5] Gonsalves returned to Guyana for the 2001–02 season, but after four games in the 2001–02 Red Stripe Bowl played only one Busta Cup match.[6][7] His last first-class appearance was in April 2002, for a GCB President's XI against the touring Indians.[8]
