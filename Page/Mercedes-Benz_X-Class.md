The MERCEDES-BENZ X-CLASS is a luxury pickup truck produced by the German automaker Mercedes-Benz, a division of German company Daimler AG. Unveiled at a world premiere in Cape Town in July 2017, the new Mercedes-Benz pickup takes its chassis from the Nissan Navara and employs many Mercedes-specific features and technologies (including some engines not shared with the Navara). It went on sale in early 2017.[1]


Development

In 2015, Mercedes-Benz announced that development of a pick-up truck was in the works.[2] The Mercedes-Benz X-Class entered production in late-2017. The new vehicle, developed in conjunction with the Nissan-Renault Alliance, will be assembled at Nissan and Renault plants in Europe and South America.

On October 25, 2016, Mercedes-Benz announced a concept class called the X-Class Concept. According to Mercedes, the new X-Class will be the world's first true "premium" pick-up truck. Dieter Zetsche, Daimler Chairman and head of Mercedes-Benz cars, said it would help a growing segment. It is slated to be only available in Australia, Europe, Latin America, and Africa. South Africans in particular are very optimistic about the Mercedes X-Class; as pick-up trucks are extremely popular there. The engine is expected to be a turbocharged diesel V6 engine paired with a 4Matic permanent all-wheel-drive system. Production started in 2017 in Argentina and Spain.[3]


Promotion

On 19 July 2017 the promotional video/advertising spot "Mercedes-Benz X-Class: Pickup Meets Lifestyle – Trailer" has been released, with "We Are Young" song by Blues Saraceno as soundtrack. 2018_Mercedes-Benz_X250_Power_D_4MATIC_Automatic_2.3_Rear.jpg
