CHANDRARAJA I (r. c. 759-751 CE ) was an Indian king belonging to the Chahamana dynasty that ruled parts of present-day Rajasthan in north-western India.

According to _Prithviraja Vijaya_, Chandraraja was a son of his predecessor Vigraharaja I. The later _Hammira Mahakavya_, however, states that his father was Vigraharaja's ancestor Naradeva.

Chandraraja I was a son of the Chahamana king Vigraharaja I. He was succeeded by his brother Gopendraraja, who in turn was succeeded by Chandraraja's son Durlabharaja I.
