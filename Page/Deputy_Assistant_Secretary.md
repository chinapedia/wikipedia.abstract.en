United States

In the United States, the rank of DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY denotes a senior executive service (SES) official within the United States federal government who reports to an Assistant Secretary.[1] Career deputy assistant secretaries are generally appointed by the Cabinet Secretary who heads the department. Non-career SESs are appointed by the President of the United States and are assigned to specific department.[2] In sub-cabinet agencies, headed by an administrator or director rather than a secretary, a comparable position is referred to as a _deputy assistant administrator_ or _deputy assistant director_.
