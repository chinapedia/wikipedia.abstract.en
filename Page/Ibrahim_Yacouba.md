Yacouba, a member of the ruling Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism (PNDS), was appointed to the government as Minister of Transport in April 2012 and then moved to the post of Deputy Director of the Cabinet of President Mahamadou Issoufou in September 2013. However, he became involved in a dispute with some leading members of the PNDS and was consequently expelled from the party on 23 August 2015. He resigned as Deputy Director of the Cabinet shortly thereafter.[2]

Yacouba launched a new party, the Nigerien Patriotic Movement (MPN), on 8 November 2015.[3] He stood as the MPN's candidate in the February 2016 presidential election. Following the first round of voting, he announced his support for President Issoufou in the second round of voting, held in March 2016. Issoufou was re-elected, and he rewarded Yacouba and other minor candidates who backed him with government posts;[4] Yacouba was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs on 11 April 2016.[5][6]
