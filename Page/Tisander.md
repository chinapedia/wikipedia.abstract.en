In Greek mythology, TISANDER (Ancient Greek: Τίσανδρος) was a son of Jason and Medea and the younger brother of Alcimenes and Thessalus.[1]


Mythology

Tisander and Alcimenes were murdered in Medea's revenge plot against Jason, after he had abandoned her and gone to marry Glauce, the daughter of King Creon of Corinth.[2]

Sources differ over the number and names of Medea's children, varying between one son, Argos, and fourteen (seven daughters and seven sons):

|     Her children are, according to some accounts, Mermerus, Pheres or Thessalus, Alcimenes and Tisander, and, according to others, she had seven sons and seven daughters, while others mention only two children, Medus (some call him Polyxemus) and Eriopis, or one son Argos. |
