_SLIGHTLY FOXED_ is a British quarterly literary magazine. Its primary focus is books and book culture. 2016 saw the publication of its fiftieth issue. Notable authors to have written for the magazine include Penelope Lively, Richard Mabey, Diana Athill, Ronald Blythe and Robert Macfarlane.[1]

Instead of books currently marketed by big publishers, _Slightly Foxed_ tends to examine older and more obscure titles. The title, "Slightly Foxed" refers to a description of a book's physical quality, commonly used in the second-hand book trade.

As well as the magazine itself, _Slightly Foxed_ has a books imprint,[2] and between 2009 and 2016 ran a bookshop on London's Gloucester Road.[3]

The magazine offices are based in London.
