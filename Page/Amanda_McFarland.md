Biography

McFarland was born in Brooke County, Virginia, about 1837. She was educated at Steubenville Female Seminary.

In 1857, married Rev. David F. McFarland, a Presbyterian clergyman. From 1862 till 1866, her husband held charge of Mattoon female seminary in Illinois, and in 1867 removed to Santa Fe, New Mexico to engage in mission work in that state. Here Mrs. McFarland organized and conducted a successful mission-school among Mexican children. In 1873, they removed to California and established an academy at San Diego, and in 1875 they conducted missions among the Nez Perce people.

After Mr. McFarland's death in 1876, his wife went under the Presbyterian Church Home Board and removed to Portland, Oregon, and in 1877 took charge of a school at Fort Wrangell, Alaska. Here, she acted as clergyman, physician, and lawyer for the local people. Encountering great difficulties and discouragements, she made the beginning of a Christian society in opening schools and organizing churches. She was called to preside over a native constitutional convention, and chiefs came long distances to enter the school of "the woman who loved their people," and to plead that teachers should be sent to their tribes. Her efforts resulted in the establishment of a training-school for Alaskan girls called "The McFarland Home," of which institution she held charge.
