is a 1973 Japanese _kaiju_ film directed by Jun Fukuda, written by Fukuda and Shinichi Sekizawa, and produced by Tomoyuki Tanaka, with special effects by Teruyoshi Nakano. Produced and distributed by Toho Studios, it is the 13th film in the _Godzilla_ franchise, and features the fictional monster characters Godzilla, Megalon, and Gigan, along with the mecha character Jet Jaguar.

Plot

In the first part of 1971 (197X in the Japanese version), the most recent underground nuclear test, set off near the Aleutians, sends shockwaves as far across the globe as Monster Island in the South Pacific, disturbing monsters such as Godzilla, Anguirus, and Rodan.

For years, Seatopia, an undersea civilization, has been heavily affected by this nuclear testing conducted by the surface nations of the world. Upset by these tests, the Seatopians plan to unleash their civilization's beetle-like cyborg god, Megalon, to destroy the surface world out of vengeance.

On the surface, an inventor named Goro Ibuki, his nephew Rokuro, and Goro's friend Hiroshi Jinkawa are off on an outing near a lake when Seatopia makes itself known to the Earth by drying up the lake the trio was relaxing nearby and using it as a base of operation. As they return home they are ambushed by agents of Seatopia who are trying to steal Jet Jaguar, a humanoid robot under construction by the trio of inventors. However the agents' first attempt is botched and they are forced to flee to safety.

Some time later, Jet Jaguar is completed but the trio of inventors are knocked unconscious by the returning Seatopian agents. The agents' plan is to use Jet Jaguar to guide and direct Megalon to destroy whatever city Seatopia commands it to do. Goro and Rokuro are sent to be killed, while Hiroshi is taken hostage. Megalon is finally released to the surface while Jet Jaguar is put under the control of the Seatopians and is used to guide Megalon to attack Tokyo with the Japan Self Defense Forces failing to defeat the monster. Eventually, the trio of heroes manage to escape their situation with the Seatopians and reunite to devise a plan to send Jet Jaguar to get Godzilla's help using Jet Jaguar's secondary control system.

After uniting with Japan's Defense Force, Goro manages to regain control of Jet Jaguar and sends the robot to Monster Island to bring Godzilla to fight Megalon. Without a guide to control its actions, Megalon flails around relentlessly and aimlessly fighting with the Defense Force and destroying the outskirts of Tokyo. The Seatopians learn of Jet Jaguar's turn and thus send out a distress call to their allies, the Space Hunter Nebula M aliens (from the previous film) to send the alien dinosaur Gigan to assist their allies.

As Godzilla journeys to fight Megalon, Jet Jaguar programs into a safeguard mode and grows to gigantic proportions to face Megalon itself until Godzilla arrives. The battle is roughly at a standstill between robot and cyborg, until Gigan arrives and both Megalon and Gigan double team against Jet Jaguar. Godzilla finally arrives to assist Jet Jaguar and the odds become even. After a long and brutal fight, Gigan and Megalon both retreat and Godzilla and Jet Jaguar shake hands on a job well done. Jet Jaguar bid Godzilla farewell and Godzilla returns to Monster Island. Jet Jaguar returns to its previous human-sized state and reunites with its human inventor.


Cast


Production

Development

_Godzilla vs. Megalon_ was originally planned as a non-_Godzilla_ film, a solo vehicle for Jet Jaguar, which was the result of a contest Toho had for children in mid-to-late 1972. The winner of the contest was an elementary school student, who submitted the drawing of a robot called Red Arone. Red Arone was turned into a monster suit, but when the child was shown the suit, he became upset because the suit did not resemble his original design. The boy's original design was white but the costume was colored red, blue and yellow. Red Arone was used for publicity, but Toho had renamed the character Jet Jaguar and had special effects director Teruyoshi Nakano redesign the character, only keeping the colors from the Red Arone suit. The Red Arone suit had a different head and wings.[1]

However, after doing some screen tests and storyboards, Toho figured Jet Jaguar would not be able to carry the film on his own, either in screen appearance or marketing value, so they shut the project down during pre-production. Nearly a month later, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka called in screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa to revise the script to add Godzilla and Gigan. To make up for lost production time, the film was shot in a hasty three weeks. The production time totaled nearly six months from planning to finish.

The film had three early treatments, each written by Shinichi Sekizawa, one was titled _Godzilla vs. The Megalon Brothers: The Undersea Kingdom's Annihilation Strategy_ which was completed in September 1972. The second was titled _Insect Monster Megalon vs. Godzilla: Undersea Kingdom's Annihilation Strategy_, which was turned in on September 5, 1972, and the third draft was submitted in September 7, 1972.[2]

Creature design

According to Teruyoshi Nakano, the Godzilla suit used in this film (nicknamed the "Megaro-Goji" suit) was made in a week, making it the fastest Godzilla suit ever made to date. They did not have time to make the eyes work correctly, something they had more time to fix for Godzilla's five appearances on Toho's superhero TV series _Zone Fighter_ (1973), which was produced around the same time.

The Megalon suit was one of the heaviest suits produced since the 1954 _Godzilla_ suit, which made it even more difficult to raise the Megalon suit via wires in certain scenes up to the point where Nakano almost decided to scrap those scenes altogether. Since the film was shot in the winter, Katsuhiko Sasaki stated that director Jun Fukuda gave him and Yutaka Hayashi a shot of whiskey to warm them up.[3]

The Gigan suit is similar to the previous design, but the suit was made thinner, less bulky, the horn on the head was less pointed, and the buzzsaw didn't move, since it was made of static pieces. This suit also has different-sized back fins, a more circular visor, scales running up the back/sides of the neck and longer legs compared to the original version.

Teruyoshi Nakano recalls how the film was rushed and that it took three weeks to shoot, stating, "It went into productions without enough preparation. There was no time to ask Mr. Sekizawa to write the script, so Mr. Sekizawa kind of thought up the general story and director Fukuda wrote the screenplay. The screenplay was completed right before crank-in".

Filming

Like previous Godzilla films, _Godzilla vs. Megalon_ heavily employs stock footage from previous Toho Godzilla films such as _Mothra vs. Godzilla_ (1964), _The War of the Gargantuas_ (1966), _Ebirah, Horror of the Deep_ (1966), _Destroy All Monsters_ (1968), _Godzilla vs. Hedorah_ (1971), and _Godzilla vs. Gigan_ (1972).


English versions

'') incorrectly places the monsters in a World Trade Center-based battle.]]

In 1976, Cinema Shares gave _Godzilla vs. Megalon_ a wide theatrical release in the United States and launched a massive marketing campaign for the film, along with the poster, buttons with one of the four monsters' faces on them were released. Given away at theatrical showings was a comic that told a simplified version of the film, which incorrectly named Jet Jaguar as "Robotman" and Gigan as "Borodan". These incorrect names were also featured in the U.S. trailer.[4]

Initially, Cinema Shares screened Toho's international English version but to ensure a G-rating, several cuts were made, which resulted in the film running three minutes shorter than the original version.

_Godzilla vs. Megalon_ is the first Godzilla film to receive an American prime time network television premiere, where it was broadcast nationwide at 9:00 PM on NBC on March 15, 1977. However, to accommodate commercials, the film was only shown in a one-hour time slot, which resulted in the film to be cut down to 48 minutes. John Belushi hosted the broadcast where he did some skits, all in a Godzilla suit.[5]

Mel Maron (who was president of Cinema Shares at the time) chose to release _Godzilla vs. Megalon_ because he saw Godzilla as a heroic figure by that point and felt the timing was right to show children a hero who was a friendly monster and not Superman.[6]

The U.S. rights for the film eventually fell into the public domain in the late 1980s, which resulted in companies releasing poorly cropped, fullscreen VHS tapes mastered from pan and scan sources. This also led to the film being featured in _Mystery Science Theater 3000_. In 1988 New World Video intended to release the original uncut unedited version of the English dub but, declined the project, due to a lack of budget that was required for a full unedited release. However, despite this, the film was released uncut and in widescreen in 1992 by UK company Polygram Ltd as a double feature with _Godzilla vs. Gigan_. [7] In 1998 the film was again released by UK company, 4 Front Video.[8] As, of now it appears those are the only two VHS tapes on the film that are unedited and in high quality. It was also released on DVD by Power Multimedia in 1999 in Taiwan.[9] Originally the Sci-Fi Channel showed the cut version, until finally in 2002 as Toho regained ownership of that title alongside _Godzilla vs. Gigan_ and _Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla_ (both which also were released by Cinema Shares) and broadcast the film fully uncut for the first time in the U.S.. [10]


Release

Box office

In Japan, _Godzilla vs. Megalon_ sold approximately 980,000 tickets. It was the first _Godzilla_ film to sell less than one million admissions.[11] The film was a success in American theaters, earning $383,744 in its first three days in Texas and Louisiana alone.[12]

Critical reception

_Godzilla vs. Megalon_ was released theatrically in America on May 9, 1976, though the _San Francisco Chronicle_ indicates that it opened there in June, and _The New York Times_ indicates that it opened in New York City on July 11. _The New York Times_ film critic Vincent Canby, who a decade before had given a negative review to _Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster_, gave _Godzilla vs. Megalon_ a generally positive review. In his review on July 12, 1976, Canby said, "_Godzilla vs. Megalon_ completes the canonization of Godzilla...It's been a remarkable transformation of character - the dragon has become St. George...It's wildly preposterous, imaginative and funny (often intentionally). It demonstrates the rewards of friendship, between humans as well as monsters, and it is gentle."[13]

_Godzilla vs. Megalon_ has attracted the ire of many _Godzilla_ fans in the decades since its original release. The film contributed to the reputation of _Godzilla_ films in the United States as cheap children's entertainment that should not be taken seriously.[14][15] It has been described as "incredibly, undeniably, mind-numbingly bad"[16] and one of the "poorer moments" in the history of kaiju films.[17]

In particular, the special effects of the film have been heavily criticized. One review described the Godzilla costume as appearing to be "crossed with Kermit the Frog"[18] and another sneeringly compared it to _Godzilla vs. Gigan_, stating that it did "everything wrong that _Gigan_ did, and then some." However, most of the criticism is of the lack of actual special effects work, as most of it consists of stock footage from previous films, including _Godzilla vs. Gigan_ and _Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster_, but a few pieces of effects work have garnered praise, specifically a scene where Megalon breaks through a dam and the draining of the lake.[19]

The other aspects of the film have been similarly skewered. The acting is usually described as flat and generally poor, and as not improving, or sometimes, worsening, the already weak script.[20] One part of the film, on the other hand, has garnered almost universal praise: Godzilla's final attack on Megalon, a flying kick. It has been called the saving grace of the film,[21] and was made famous by the mock exclamations of shock and awe displayed on _Godzilla vs. Megalon_'s appearance on _Mystery Science Theater 3000_. Through the end of season three to the middle of season five, that clip would be shown at the opening of each show.

Despite all this, the film is also one of the most widely seen ''Godzilla ''films in the United States — it was popular in its initial theatrical release, largely due to an aggressive marketing campaign, including elaborate posters of the two title monsters battling atop New York City's World Trade Center towers, presumably to capitalize on the hype surrounding the Dino De Laurentiis remake of _King Kong_, which used a similar image for its own poster.[22]

Home media

The film was released numerous times in the VHS format, mostly as videos from bargain basement studios that featured the edited TV version (which was wrongly assumed to be in the public domain for many years), while Polygram and 4 Front released the unedited version of the film in 1992 and 1998, respectively. Some rumors have circulated that the film’s original VHS releases in the States were uncut, but there is no evidence confirming or denying this.  

Media Blasters acquired the DVD rights to both _Godzilla vs. Megalon_ and _Destroy All Monsters_. Both films were released under one of the company's divisions, Tokyo Shock. Media Blasters originally planned to release _Godzilla vs. Megalon_ on DVD and Blu-ray on December 20, 2011; however, due to technical difficulties with the dubbing and Toho having yet to give its approval for the release, the DVD/Blu-ray release was delayed.[23] Media Blasters finally released the film on August 14, 2012, but only on a bare-bones DVD and Blu-ray. Also, a manufacturing error led to several copies of the originally planned version featuring bonus content to be released by accident.[24] These special features versions are incredibly rare and are not labelled differently from the standard version, making them nearly impossible to find.[25] This release was commercially the first to remaster the film to its original full-length version. In mid-late 2017, the Criterion Collection gained the rights to several Showa era Godzilla films, including _Godzilla vs. Megalon_ to be released on DVD and Blu-ray, digitally remastered and restored in HD. The release date is unknown.
