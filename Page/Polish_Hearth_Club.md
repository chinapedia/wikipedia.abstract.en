Ognisko_Polskie_1.JPG, London]] The POLISH HEARTH CLUB (Polish: _Ognisko Polskie_) is a private member's club incorporating a restaurant, a theatre and exhibition space at 55 Exhibition Road in Kensington, London, U.K.


History

World War II

The club is the only survivor of several Polish social establishments in West London that began during World War II and were in the vicinity of the temporary Polish parish that was hosted by the Oratorian Fathers at Brompton Oratory and assumed greater significance after the war with the passing of the Polish Resettlement Act 1947, when some 200,000 Polish veterans reached British shores.

The Polish Hearth Club was jointly founded by the British government and the Polish government-in-exile in 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II. The formal inauguration of the Club followed in 1940 in the presence of HRH Duke of Kent. Throughout the ensuing years, Ognisko was not only a meeting place for Polish government ministers and officials, it also hosted Poland's exiled intellectual elite.[1] Its basement hosted in the 1960s and 70s a youth club under the moniker, "Pomidor" (tomato in Polish).

The other Polish social clubs that have disappeared or have been amalgamated were: "Orzeł Biały" (The White Eagle Club) in Knightsbridge, "Samopomoc Marynarki Wojennej" (The Marine Officers Club), on Chelsea Embankment (later in Wetherby Gardens, SW5), "Klub Lotników polskich" (Polish Airforce Club) in Collingham Gardens, SW5, "Stowarzyszenie Polskich Kombatantów" (SPK) (the Polish Combatants Association, part of a UK-wide network) in Queen's Gate Terrace.[2]

As the Polish community in London either emigrated to third countries or settled elsewhere in the UK, those who remained in the capital tended to move south or westward to areas such as Hammersmith, Ealing and Balham, where house prices were more accessible. In the 1970s the community had raised sufficient funds to build the Polish Social and Cultural Centre (POSK) in Hammersmith. To a degree Ognisko and POSK became rivals for the support a diminishing Polish community, until the next century.

Dispersal and decline of the diaspora

With the decline of war-time and post-war émigrés, by the start of the 21st century, the Club's future became uncertain. The building came close to being sold off to developers in 2012 by some members of the committee with an eye for the main chance, but the membership roused itself into action and saved this popular venue for a new generation.[3][4]


Successful revival

A new committee brought in contemporary management skills to rejuvenate the venue.[5] The bar and dining room are leased to restaurateur Jan Woroniecki.[6][7] Portraits of prominent Poles and British people adorn the walls.[8] Theatrical productions, concerts and exhibitions have resumed on the first floor of the building attracting a British audience boosted by the arrival of a new generation of EU Poles.
