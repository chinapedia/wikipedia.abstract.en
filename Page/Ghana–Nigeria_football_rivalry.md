The GHANA–NIGERIA FOOTBALL RIVALRY is a sports rivalry that exists between the national football teams of Ghana and Nigeria, as well as their respective sets of fans. The sport has been played since prior to both countries' respective independence, and the match-up is among the oldest and most proliferate rivalries in African football. The football competition reflects the long-standing socio-economic rivalry between the two nations, which are two of the five Anglophone nations in West Africa and home to the largest populations in the region.[1][2]


Background and history

FIFA lists the first official match between the two as a World Cup qualifier taking place in 1960. However, both national teams had already engaged in numerous domestic friendlies and tournaments between themselves and other nations dating back to 1950.[3]

The national teams of these two West African countries were formed while both were still protectorates of the British Empire. At that time the modern nation of Ghana was known as the Gold Coast and members of the team from Nigeria, prior to adopting their national colors of green and white, wore scarlet tops over white shorts and were known as the "Red Devils".[4]

Gold Coast's football federation, founded in 1920, was over twenty years older than Nigeria's and its team was more respected among Britain's colonies. Prior to what is often considered to be first official International "A" match in 1951, the Gold Coast national team had also already toured England, playing friendly matches against various clubs. Not to be outdone, Nigeria followed suit to a lesser degree of success. However, despite their relative histories, Nigeria was able to upset their nascent rivals 5–0 on home soil. The two nations played to relative parity for much of the rest of the 1950s, mostly trading victories on respective home soil, but Ghana would go on to dominate much of the competition between the 1960s and the early 2000s and win the Africa Cup of Nations four times to Nigeria's two in that time period. In the meantime, Nigeria would enjoy more success in intercontinental competition, qualifying multiple times for the FIFA World Cup and reaching an African highest FIFA ranking of No. 5 in the world in 1994. The team further distinguished themselves with memorable runs to the knockout stages that year and 1998, beating Spain and coming within minutes of defeating international powerhouse and eventual 1994 finalists Italy.


Regional Cup era

Until 1960 Egypt was the only African nation to ever participate in FIFA World Cup qualifying. Since decolonization had yet to begin in earnest, few nations on the African continent were able to assemble national teams that were internationally recognized and thus eligible for FIFA competitions. Various rivalry cups and tournaments were instituted instead. During the 1950s and 1960s, Nigeria and Ghana would compete in three cup competitions.

1951–59 Jalco Cup

NgrRdDvls-1956JlcCp.jpeg - Jalco Cup Champions - 1956]] There are various records of matches having been played between the national teams dating back to 1938. These unofficial matches list the scores and winners but, as with the match in 1938, specific details such as player lineups and often even the exact date that the match took place, are unknown. The first well-documented matches were organized under the banner of the Jalco Cup, a competition sponsored by the Ford Motor Company by way of a subsidiary, Joe Allen & Company (J.Allen & Co.) [5][6]for whom the cup was named. It is generally held to be the beginning of the rivalry's historical record.[7] The cup was contested between the two countries every year except 1952.

1959–67 Dr Kwame Nkrumah Gold Cup

Postage_Stamp_-_Dr._Kwame_Nkrumah_Gold_Cup_-_1959.jpgAfter Ghanaian independence the country's football officials harbored ambitions of competing in the Olympic Games. To this end they met with officials from the most prominent West African nations, including Nigeria, to create the West African Soccer Federation. The aim of the new federation was to sponsor a regional football tournament which would help to raise the level of the game in the respective nations for future participation in international tournaments. The result was the Dr. Kwame Nkrumah Gold Cup, also called the West African Soccer Federation championship.

The tournament had middling success; it was plagued from the outset by organizational and funding shortfalls. In the initial tournament in 1959, the qualifying stages were only partially completed. In addition, Nigeria did not appear for the semifinal of that tournament, and the match had to be replaced with an exhibition game played as a stand-in. Also, the fourth and final tournament in 1967 was postponed following issues having to do with the lack of lighting during the qualifying matches and subsequent complaints on the issue by the Sierra Leone players. There is no record of the final tournament ever having been completed.

Despite these issues, the tournament would see two matches played between Ghana and Nigeria, the high point being when the two sides met in the final of the 1960 tournament in Lagos, Nigeria in which Ghana won 3–0. Both matches played between the two sides during the life of the tournament were won by Ghana by a combined score of 8–0.

1961–67 Azikiwe Cup

The figurative successor to the Jalco Cup, the Azikiwe Cup was named for Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was Nigeria's first postcolonial president. The tournament was initially contested under the same rotating, single match, format as the Jalco Cup, but was later switched to an aggregate home and away setup with each team hosting one match apiece.

Unlike the Jalco Cup, the teams did not share the cup in the event of a tie under the single leg format, but rather the cup returned to the nation that had held it. This only occurred in 1962 when Ghana secured a 0-0 result in Lagos and were able to retain the cup that they initially won in the competition in 1961. Ghana won or retained the cup in every year that it was contested, continuing a dominance in the rivalry stemming in the early 1960s broken only during a brief period in the mid-1970s and 1980s and lasting until early 2000s.
