Production

On April 13, 2016, Reyes announced that he would direct the film. In addition, lead star Ai-Ai delas Alas posted a photo of the ensemble cast on Instagram, confirming the appearances of Zoren Legaspi, Megan Young, Sofia Andres, and two child actors Lucas Magallano and Alyson McBride in the film. The film was originally titled as _My Mighty Yaya_.[7]

During a press conference in May 2017, Reyes said he wrote the screenplay after receiving a Facebook message from the granddaughter of his dying childhood nanny, asking him to pay her a visit.[8]


Marketing

_Our Mighty Yaya_{{'}}s official trailer was released on April 18, 2017 by Regal Entertainment.[9] As of April 27, the film's Facebook page has generated 1.5 million views.[10]


Release

_Our Mighty Yaya_ was originally planned as Regal's official competing entry at the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival, an annual film festival held every December in the Philippines.[11] The producers, however (led by Roselle Monteverde), failed to reach the deadline for submission of the film's picture lock version on November 2, as per MMFF's requirement. Rather, another film distributed by Regal, _Mano Po 7: Tsinoy_, was locked in to compete for the MMFF.[12] The film had its premiere on May 10, 2017.[13]


Reception

Reception for _Our Mighty Yaya_ has been negative upon release, with critics noting its tired and clichéd plot as well as its stock characters. Oggs Cruz of Rappler called it "a movie that has given up in both originality and ambition," as well as "unapologetically generic and predictable," and a "humdrum and routinary to really be memorably entertaining." Furthermore, Cruz opined that the film merely serves as a starring vehicle for Ai-Ai delas Alas.[14] Philbert Dy of _The Neighborhood_ felt similarly, while also taking notice of unconvincing performances by Megan Young and delas Alas; he gave an overall rating of 2.5 out of 5.[15]
