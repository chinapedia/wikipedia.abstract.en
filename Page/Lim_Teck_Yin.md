Military career

Commissioned as an Infantry Officer in December 1981, Lim converted to a Commando Officer in September 1982 and was a Platoon and Company Commander in 1st Commando Battalion. Since then, he rose up the ranks holding various command and staff appointments[7] notably as Commander of the Army Training and Doctrine Command and Commander of 6th Division (Singapore).
