The ABERDEEN SUBDIVISION is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in North Carolina. The line runs along CSX's S Line from Raleigh, North Carolina to Marston, North Carolina for a total of 86.9 miles. At its north end it continues south from the Norlina Subdivision and at its south end it continues south as the Hamlet Terminal Subdivision.[1][2]

The Aberdeen Subdivision hosts both CSX freight trains and Amtrak passenger trains. The line has passenger stations in Southern Pines and Cary. Passenger trains also serve Raleigh Union Station at the north end of the line though the station's platform is just east of the Aberdeen Subdivison on Norfolk Southern's H Line (which passenger trains take east to CSX's A Line in Selma).


History

Southern_Pines_NC_train_station_E.jpg The Aberdeen Subdivision was originally built by the Raleigh and Augusta Air Line Railroad, which began operation in the late 1800s.[3] The Raleigh and Augusta Air Line Railroad was merged into the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1901, and became part of its main line.[4]

Seaboard eventually became the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad in 1967 and then CSX Transportation by 1986. The line is part of CSX's S Line (which is the designation for the former Seaboard Air Line main line).
