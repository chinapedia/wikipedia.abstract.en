Sohn-Emigrant.jpg PAUL EDUARD RICHARD SOHN (11 November 1834, Düsseldorf - 1912, Düsseldorf) was a German genre painter. His father was Karl Ferdinand Sohn and his brother was Karl Rudolf Sohn; both also artists.


Biography

He completed his public school education in 1851 at the "Städtischen Realschule" (now the ""). His first artistic studies were with his father. Later, he attended the master classes taught by Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf and, after 1862, took private lessons from Rudolf Jordan,[1] who was married to his mother's youngest sister.

In 1867, he made a study trip to Paris. He was also influenced by the work of his cousin, Wilhelm Sohn, although he remained generally true to the styles of the Düsseldorf school of painting. His works sold very well in the United States.

Described by his sister-in-law as "quiet and inconspicuous", he never married and, after 1870, lived with his mother. After her death in 1884, he moved to a modest home of his own and opened a studio nearby.
