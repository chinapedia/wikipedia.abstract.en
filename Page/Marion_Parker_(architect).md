Biography

Marion Parker was the first female graduate in the College of Engineering and Architecture of the University of Michigan in 1895; the university awards two female students annually to honor her (at least in the mid-1970s).[2] After graduating she worked on skyscrapers in New York City.[3]

Parker worked for William Gray Purcell and George Fieck in their Minneapolis office becoming their first drafter in 1908[4] and by 1912 became an important member in the small firm.[5] She produced working drawings for leaded glass panels and other craft items.[6]

Established in 1909,[7] Purcell & Elmslie has been described as one of the most prolific of the Prairie School.[8] After adding George Grant Elmslie as partner in 1909, the firm dissolved in 1921.[9]

However, Parker left in 1919 to start her own office.[10]

In addition to architecture, Parker was a craftswoman. A member of the Minneapolis Arts and Crafts Society, she was also worked in textiles, especially rugs in the early 1900s; was a charter member of the chalk and chisel club; and garnered an exhibit prize in 1914.[11]

In retirement she moved to Luguna Beach and opened an arts and crafts shop,[12] named "The Home-Spun Shop".[13] Located in an arts colony she participated in Summer art fairs.[14] While travelling to visit Purcell, she died of a heart attack.[15]

Parker's collection is at the Northwest Architectural Archives, University of Minnesota Libraries, as are Purcell's papers.[16][17]
