MARY STUART HARRISON SMITH (1834–1917) was an American author, translator, and women's advocate. Her _Virginia Cookery Book_ (1885) is one of the country's early modern cookbooks. In addition to other original works, she published over fifty translated compositions, primarily from the German to English. In 1893 Smith, a descendant of the Harrison family of Virginia, attended and spoke on behalf of Virginia women at the Chicago World's Congress, which was designed to highlight women's rights. In 1895 she was among other women invited by the Virginia governor to represent the Commonwealth's female workers at the Board of Women's convention at the International Exposition in Atlanta.


Youth, education and family

Smith was born at the University of Virginia on February 10, 1834. She was the second child of Professor Gessner Harrison, son of Dr. Peachy Harrison and Mary Stuart, and wife, Eliza Lewis Carter Tucker, daughter of Prof. George Tucker and Maria Ball Carter. Her education was provided by family and private tutors—her father taught Ancient Languages. She studied Latin, German, French, Italian, and Greek, and had great fondness for poetry. At age thirteen, when selected as Queen of the May by her contemporaries, she wrote her first poem for recital at her coronation.

On July 31, 1853, she married Francis H. Smith (1829–1928), son of Daniel Grove Smith and Eleanor Buckey. He was a Professor and Faculty Chairman at the University of Virginia and they made their 69-year residence on the lawn in Pavilion V there, provided by the university at no cost. They had twelve children:

-   Eliza Lewis Carter—born (?) ; died 1880; married William W. Walker

Career

Original works

After the American Civil War, Smith's nascent interest in writing began to flourish. A notable beginning was made with her _Art of Housekeeping_ in 1878, which first appeared as a series of papers written for the New York _Fashion Bazar._ Of her original books, _Heirs of the Kingdom_ was published in Nashville in 1880, for which a prize of $300 was awarded by a select committee.

Smith's'' Virginia Cookery Book'' was one of the early modern efforts made of that genre in America, in 1885. In her preface, Smith provides her principal motivation for the book, as one of “expediency”, in light of “old domestic institutions being done away with” and “the danger that the composition of many an excellent dish may become forgotten lore.” She then gives reverence to her forebears in cookery, saying “Enough it will be for the Virginia Cookery Book to take its place on the housekeeper’s pantry-shelf alongside the similar works of Miss Leslie, Marian Harland, Mrs. Henderson, and Mrs. Hale…” Smith further emphasized the role of her book as “a memento of the past, as well as a help in the present, extolling Mary Randolph‘s _Virginia Housewife_ (1824), of which there was then no authorized edition extant. Smith then reproduces the introduction to Randolph’s book, which was written for that lady by Smith's grandfather, Professor George Tucker.

Smith's _Lang Syne, or the Wards of Mt. Vernon_ was published on the occasion of the Washington Centennial, held in New York in April, 1887. Her series of _Letters from a Lady in New York_ was published (date unknown) in the _Religious Herald_.

Translations

Mary_Stuart_Smith_handpainted_china.jpg Smith was thought by eminent critics to have a special gift for translating German poetry, including her _Chidhe_ in the _Overland Monthly_. These translations, for leading periodicals and publishing houses, form a long list. From Ernst Werner, she translated _A Hero of the Pen_, _Hermann_, _Good Luck_, _What the Spring Brought_, _St. Michael_, _A Judgment of God_ and _Beacon Lights_. Her translations from other German writers were _Lieschen_, _The Fairy of the Alps_, _The Bailiff's Maid_, _Gold Elsie_, _Old Ma'amselle's Secret_, _The Owl House_, _The Lady With the Rubies_, _Serapis_, _The Bride of the Nile_, and _Lace_ by Paul Lindau, and others. She also translated from the French, _The Salon of Mine_ and _Necker_.

Her work included books for children, also translations from the German, such as _The Canary Bird and Other Stories_, and _Jack the Breton Boy_. Other children's works were adaptations from the French, including _How Lillie Spent Her Day_, and _Little May and Her Lost A._

Review articles

Some of Smith's articles were in the form of reviews for the _Southern Review_, the _Southern Methodist Quarterly_ and the _Church Review_. Among her best review articles were, _Askaros Kassis Karis, Robert Emmet, Queen Louisa of Prussia, John of Barneveldt, What the Swallows Sang, The Women of the Revolution, The Women of the Southern Confederacy, Madame de Stael and Her Parents, The Necker Family, Madam Recamier, Mary and Martha Washington, and The Virginia Gentlewoman of the Olden Time._

Finally, Smith made numerous contributions of practical articles in _Harper's Bazar_, as well as others in the _American Agriculturist, Good Housekeeping_, and other periodicals.

Advocacy for women

Woman's_Building_(3572763077).jpg Smith attended the Congress of Representative Women held at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. The Congress focused on the political, social, and technical agendas of women, including suffrage, and was attended by luminaries such as Jane Addams, Bertha Palmer, Lucy Stone and Susan B. Anthony. Smith spoke on _The Virginia Woman of Today_, including an anecdote reflecting the admitted, but officially unacknowledged, ability of women in the fine arts:

Smith in her speech also reviewed the remarkable efforts of Dr. Orianna Moon as an example of indomitable feminine spirit—Dr. Moon of Scottsville, Va., became a pioneer for women seeking a career as a medical doctor. Smith concluded her remarks as follows: The Fair ended with the tragic assassination of Chicago's Mayor, and Smith's distant cousin, Carter Harrison, Sr. In 1895 Smith was in a group commissioned by Virginia Governor Charles T. O’Ferrall to represent the Virginia Dept. of Woman–Workers at the Board of Women of the Cotton States International Exposition in Atlanta. The Virginia legislature was not then in session and, there being no funds available for the journey and stay in Atlanta, the women's group resolved to raise the funds by individually creating patriotic song lyrics for compilation and sale. Smith therefore served as editor in producing _From Virginia to Georgia, A Tribute in Song by Virginia Women_, that included three entries of her own, one of which, _The Ideal Wife_, is at margin.


University of Virginia memorial

The University of Virginia church community remembers Smith positively. A stained glass window in the university's chapel is dedicated to her memory. Current research at hand does not otherwise document Smith's connection with the chapel. Record of the original funding and construction of the chapel, which coincide with Smith's lifelong campus residency, indicates the formation in 1883 of the Ladies Chapel Aid Society, prior to the laying of the chapel's cornerstone in 1885 and completion in 1889. The chapel's exhibit at the university's library indicates, “A chapel was finally built on the grounds in the 1880s after a successful campaign led by women dedicated to the spiritual needs of the University community.“ Library records further show total funds raised were about $36,000.

Smith is interred in the university cemetery with her husband and family.
