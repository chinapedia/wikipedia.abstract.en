Early life and education

Justin Wedes was born in Huntington Woods, Michigan a suburb of Detroit. He attended Berkley High School, graduating class valedictorian in 2004.[3]

Wedes graduated from the University of Michigan in 2008 with a Bachelor of Science in Physics and Linguistics with High Honors. From 2007 - 2008, Justin was an organizer with the Rural Migrant Outreach Program. Wedes continued his education from 2008 - 2010 at Pace University earning his Master of Education in Adolescent Science Education.


Career and activism work

From 2008 - 2010, Justin Wedes was an educator with the New York City Department of Education, teaching truant and low-income youth in subjects ranging from science to media literacy. His work with high-risk youth was recognized with a Teachers Network Leadership Institute MetLife Fellowship.[4]

Wedes helped co-found the US Uncut movement in 2009 and acted as Social Media Director, connecting networks of activists and social change-makers through the Internet and on the streets.

In July 2011 Wedes co-founded the New York City General Assembly (NYCGA), the group that organized Occupy Wall Street.[5] Wedes was an organizer and unofficial spokesperson for the movement, appearing on The Colbert Report with Stephen Colbert in October, 2011.[6] In 2012, Wedes accepted the Activism Award at the Shorty Awards[7] on behalf of the Twitter @OccupyWallStreetNYC "Tweetboat" social media team. In 2012 Wedes received the Labor Communicator of the Year Award from the Metro NY Labor Communications Council.

Wedes was an Organizer and Volunteer Coordinator of the Occupy Sandy movement from 2012 - 2013.[8]

After the closing of the Paul Robeson High School for Business and Technology in 2011, Wedes co-founded the Paul Robeson Freedom School in Brooklyn, NY in 2012 with an emphasis on social justice and building community resilience. For this work, his partner and him received the 2013 United National Humanitarian Peacekeeping Award at the United Nations International Day of Peace.

From June 2014 - May 2015 Wedes served as head organizer of the Detroit Water Brigade, helping lead the humanitarian and advocacy response to Detroit’s municipal water shutoff program. This non-profit advocacy group provided rapid relief to thousands of families without running water and, in coalition with other local groups, participated in blockades that temporarily shut down the program. In response, the city of Detroit implemented a temporary moratorium on water shutoffs and a host of reforms making water more affordable for low-income residents.

Wedes founded the Liberati Group in May 2015, a strategic media consulting firm.

Wedes serves as a Board Member at Bethel Community Transformation Center (formerly known as Temple Beth-El (Lighthouse Cathedral), a non-profit that works to renovate a former Detroit Jewish synagogue and serve as an inter-faith community center for community empowerment and reconciliation.

In February 2016, Wedes testified to the United Nations in New York City urging them to investigate the Flint water crisis.[9]


Controversy

In August 2014, Justin Wedes changed the password of the collectively managed @OccupyWallStNYC "Tweetboat" social media account. In response, the rest of the collective wrote a statement denouncing his actions.[10] Wedes responded with his version on his private blog.[11] In September 2014, a group of Occupy Wall Street organizers filed suit against Wedes in NY State Supreme Court in Manhattan, accusing him of censoring them from the use of an OWS Twitter account they claimed ownership of. The lawsuit was ultimately terminated in January, 2015.[12]
