ALBERTA PROVINCIAL HIGHWAY NO. 34, also known as HIGHWAY 34, was a highway in northwest Alberta, Canada, that existed in various configurations from the mid-1930s to the late 1990s. It was originally established in the 1930s as a east–west alternative highway to Highway 2 (then Highway 1) from north of Grande Prairie to Triangle, west of High Prairie, through the southern Peace Country via Valleyview.[1] After a number of realignments affecting the east segment of the highway in the late 1950s through mid-1960s[2][3][4] and a shortening in the early 1990s due to highway renumbering,[5][6] Highway 34 spent its final years as a highway between Highway 2 north of Grande Prairie to Valleyview before being renumbered as Highway 43 on March 1, 1998.[7][8]


History

Alberta_Highway_034_in_1939.png Highway 34 was originally established as a unnumbered graded road in the late 1930s.[9] It started at Highway 2 (then numbered Highway 1) north of Grande Prairie and south of Clairmont.[10] It crossed the Smoky River via ferry east of its starting point and continued another eastward to reach Valleyview.[11] At Valleyview, the road turned north and then northeast for crossing the Little Smoky River before reconnecting with Highway 2 approximately west of High Prairie and south of McLennan.[12] The road was designated Highway 34 in 1939.[13]

By 1959, the western stretch of Highway 34 provided access to numerous localities between Grande Prairie and Valleyview including Bezanson, Goodwin, Debolt, Crooked Creek, Clarkson Valley, Sturgeon Heights and Calais.[14] The western to Bezanson and the eastern from Crooked Creek to Valleyview was paved while the remaining between Bezanson and Crooked Creek was graveled.[15]

Much of the stretch of Highway 34 northeast of Valleyview was realigned in 1959. At a point north of Valleyview, Highway 34 was rerouted north for to the intersection of Highway 2 and Highway 49 just west of Donnelly, while the former highway alignment from north of Valleyview to Triangle was renumbered HIGHWAY 34A.[16] The new Highway 34 alignment crossed the Little Smoky River north of Valleyview and passed by Guy later.[17] The entire stretch from Valleyview to Donnelly was graveled at that time, as was the segment of Highway 34A.[18] In total, Highway 34 spanned in 1959.[19]

As a result of Highway 2 realignment in 1960, the total length of Highway 34 was reduced to ,[23] while the length of Highway 34A was reduced to .[24] By this time, the entire stretch from Grande Prairie to Valleyview was paved, while the stretch from Valleyview to north of the Little Smoky River remained gravel.[25]
