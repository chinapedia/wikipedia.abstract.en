AGOONOREE is a Scouting jamboree for young people with special needs.[1][2]


History

In 1949, Netherlands Scouts organised an international camp at Lunteren for Scouts with disabilities called "Agoon",[3] after the Greek language word _agṓn_ (_ἀγών_) meaning a gathering or competition. Further international Agoon camps were held in Belgium in 1953 and at Gilwell Park in the United Kingdom in 1958. The success of these events prompted the establishment of "Agoonoree" (a compound word of _Agoon_ plus _jamboree_[4]) camps at national or regional level in several countries. [5]


Australia

The first Queensland Agoonoree was held in 1980, following a visit by leaders to the 3rd Nippon Agoonoree in the previous year.[6] Each year Scouts Queensland and Guides Queensland invite about 70 children as guests to participate in a week long camp at Baden-Powell Park, Samford, Queensland.[7] Scouts New South Wales also holds an Agoonoree; in 2015 it was held at Mount Keira Scout Activity Centre.[8] Scouts Victoria held their second Agoonoree in 2015 at Treetops Scout Camp, Riddells Creek.[9]


Indonesia

A _National Special Scout Jamboree_ is held every five years for disabled Scouts. The seventh National Special Scouts Jamboree was held in 2007, in East Jakarta. The first jamboree of this sort to be held in Indonesia was in 1972.[10]


Japan

Nippon Agoonorees are held once every four years, and are abbreviated "NA", and may include the number of the event. For example, "9NA" refers to the 9th Nippon Agoonoree. SAJ (Scout Association of Japan) uploads these pictures in Facebook. Fumihito, Prince Akishino and Princess Mako participated in the Agoonoree on August 12, 2016.[11]

United Kingdom

The first camp for Extension Scouts of the London region was held in 1947.[12] In the 1960s, the London Agoonoree consisted of between 60 and 80 Scouts with special needs accompanied by able-bodied Scouts who acted as helpers as well as adult Scouters.[13] Later in the decade, the camp split into two, the northern Scout Counties of London forming "North Camp" and the Southern and Central being "South Camp".[14] The annual London Agoonoree currently caters for members of The Scout Association with special needs in the 14-23 age group.[15] The first Yorkshire Agoonoree was held in 1960.[16]
