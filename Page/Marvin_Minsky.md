MARVIN LEE MINSKY (August 9, 1927 – January 24, 2016) was an American cognitive scientist concerned largely with research of artificial intelligence (AI), co-founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's AI laboratory, and author of several texts concerning AI and philosophy.[1][2][3][4]


Biography

Marvin Lee Minsky was born in New York City, to an eye surgeon father, Henry, and to a mother, Fannie, who was an activist of Zionist affairs.[5][6] His family was Jewish. He attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School and the Bronx High School of Science. He later attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. He then served in the US Navy from 1944 to 1945. He received a B.A. in mathematics from Harvard University (1950) and a Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University (1954).[7][8]

He was on the MIT faculty from 1958 to his death. He joined the staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in 1958, and a year later he and John McCarthy initiated what is known now as the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.[9][10] He was the Toshiba Professor of Media Arts and Sciences, and professor of electrical engineering and computer science.


Contributions in computer science

He developed, with Seymour Papert, the first Logo "turtle". Minsky also built, in 1951, the first randomly wired neural network learning machine, SNARC.

In 1962, Minsky came up with a 7,4 Turing machine that he was able to prove to be universal. At that point in time, it was known to be the simplest universal Turing machine–a record that stood for approximately 40 years until Stephen Wolfram published a 2,5 universal Turing machine in his 2002 book, _A New Kind of Science_.[14]

Minsky wrote the book _Perceptrons_ (with Seymour Papert), attacking the work of Frank Rosenblatt, which became the foundational work in the analysis of artificial neural networks. This book is the center of a controversy in the history of AI, as some claim it to have had great importance in discouraging research of neural networks in the 1970s, and contributing to the so-called "AI winter".[15] He also founded several other famous AI models. His book _A framework for representing knowledge_ created a new paradigm in programming. While his _Perceptrons_ is now more a historical than practical book, the theory of frames is in wide use.[16] Minsky has also written on the possibility that extraterrestrial life may think like humans, permitting communication.[17]

In the early 1970s, at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, Minsky and Papert started developing what came to be known as the Society of Mind theory. The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non-intelligent parts. Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a video camera, and a computer to build with children's blocks. In 1986, Minsky published _The Society of Mind_, a comprehensive book on the theory which, unlike most of his previously published work, was written for the general public.

In November 2006, Minsky published _The Emotion Machine_, a book that critiques many popular theories of how human minds work and suggests alternative theories, often replacing simple ideas with more complex ones. Recent drafts of the book are freely available from his webpage.[18]


Role in popular culture

Minsky was an adviser[19] on Stanley Kubrick's movie _2001: A Space Odyssey_; one of the movie's characters, Victor Kaminski, was named in Minsky's honor.[20] Minsky himself is explicitly mentioned in Arthur C. Clarke's derivative novel of the same name, where he is portrayed as achieving a crucial break-through in artificial intelligence in the then-future 1980s, paving the way for HAL 9000 in the early 21st century:


Personal life

In 1952, Minsky married pediatrician Gloria Rudisch; together they had three children.[21] Minsky was a talented improvisational pianist[22] who published musings on the relations between music and psychology.

Opinions

Minsky was an atheist,[23] a signatory to the Scientists' Open Letter on Cryonics.[24]

He was a critic of the Loebner Prize for conversational robots,[25] and argued that a fundamental difference between humans and machines was that while humans are machines, they are machines in which intelligence emerges from the interplay of the many unintelligent but semi-autonomous agents that comprise the brain.[26] He argued that "somewhere down the line, some computers will become more intelligent than most people," but that it was very hard to predict how fast progress would be.[27] He cautioned that an artificial superintelligence designed to solve an innocuous mathematical problem might decide to assume control of Earth's resources to build supercomputers to help achieve its goal,[28] but believed that such negative scenarios are "hard to take seriously" because he felt confident that AI would go through a lot of testing before being deployed.[29]

Death

Minsky died of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 88.[30] Minsky was a member of Alcor's Scientific Advisory Board,[31] and is believed to have been cryonically preserved by Alcor,[32] presumably as 'Patient 144', whose cooling procedures began on January 27, 2016.[33]
