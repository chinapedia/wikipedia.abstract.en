_EUCALYPTUS DUNDASII_, commonly known as the DUNDAS BLACKBUTT,[1] is a species of tree that is endemic to Western Australia. It has rough, scaly bark on the lower part of the trunk, smooth bark above, narrow lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and cylindrical to narrow urn-shaped flowers.


Description

_Eucalyptus dundasii_ is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, scaly or tesselatted grey-black, grey or black bark on the lower part of the trunk, smooth greyish over coppery bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have broadly lance-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are the same glossy green on both sides, narrow lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on a pedicel up to long. Mature buds are more or less cylindrical, long and wide with a beaked operculum. Flowering occurs between February and July and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, cylindrical to urn-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed below the rim.[2][3][4]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus dundasii_ was first formally described by the botanist Joseph Maiden in 1916 and published in the _Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales_. The type specimen was collected near Dundas by Ludwig Diels in 1901.[5][6] The specific epithet (_dundasii_) refers to the type location, Dundas, an abandoned mining town.[7]


Distribution

Dundas blackbutt is found on flats and in and around salt lakes in open forest and woodland. It occurs from near Lake Barlee to Salmon Gums and the Fraser Range in the Coolgardie, Mallee and Murchison biogeogaphic regions.[8]

This tree is part of a mixed arid to semi-arid woodland community along with _E. loxophleba_, _E. wandoo_, _E. eremophila_, _E. salmonophloia_, _E. lesouefii_ and _E. torquata_.[9] Species in the understorey include _Eucalyptus flocktoniae_ and other mallees. Shrubs found are dependent on the salinity levels, with _Acacia_ species dominating the areas of low salinity and _Eremophila_ and _Atriplex_ species found in more saline areas.[10]


Conservation status

_Eucalyptus dundasii_ is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife[11]


Use in horticulture

This eucalypt is sold commercially in seed form or as tube stock, it is salt, drought[12] and frost tolerant and is grown as a shade tree or a street tree in arid areas.[13]
