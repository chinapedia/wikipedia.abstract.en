She is known for including feminist perspectives in her films, as well as commenting on South African politics and culture. Her work includes the film _Paljas_ which was selected as the South African entry, but not nominated, for Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Academy Awards.[1]


Biography

Katinka Heyns was born on September 20, 1947.[2] She attended the University of Pretoria in South Africa and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in drama.[3] Heyns was married to writer Chris Barnard, with whom she has a son, Simon Barnard.[4]


Career

She began her career as an actor playing a part in Jans Rautenbach's _Katrina_ (1969). She went on to be cast in several of Rautenbach's films, including _Janie Totsiens_ (1970), _Pappa Lap_ (1971), and _Eendag op 'n Reendag_ (1975).[5] She also received a lot of attention for her role in Manie van Rensburg's television comedy series _Willem._

Due to the apartheid policy in South Africa at the time, there were severe censorship laws in place, however Heyns was still able to make documentaries about various literary individuals.[6] Heyns founded the production company Sonneblom Films in 1974. It was through this company she was able to create feature films unique to her particular style. All the scripts for her feature films were written by her husband Chris Barnard.[7] Her feature films include: _Fiela se Kind_ (1987), _Die Storie van Klara Viljee_ (1991), _Paljas_ (1997), and _Die Wonderwerker_ (2012).[8]

Film style

Heyns has been influenced heavily by filmmaker Jans Rautenbach who gave her a start for her career in film.[9] In an industry dominated by male filmmakers, Heyns consistently creates films that focus on female empowerment and specifically female experiences.[10] Keyan G. Tomaselli, a professor at the University of KwaZulu-Natal notes how Heyns' films are able to comment on the political climate in South Africa, by applying a feminist lens.[11] Her films attempt to portray political and cultural experiences that are specific to South Africa, while other directors of her time focused on reproducing American style films.[12] All of Heyns' pieces evoke themes of relationships, love, and struggle, while simultaneously questioning gender representations in South African culture.[13] Through her films, Heyns tries to bring lesser known issues and ideas into the global conversation, such as mental illness and female empowerment, while consistently doing so in the context of South African culture.[14]
