_THE PRINCESS DIARIST_ is a 2016 memoir written by Carrie Fisher, based on diaries she kept as a young woman around the time she starred in the 1977 film _Star Wars_. The book is the third memoir Fisher wrote, in addition to four novels and a one-woman Broadway show.[1] It is Fisher's final book, as she died five weeks after its release on December 27, 2016.[2]

The book describes Fisher's affair with co-star Harrison Ford in detail.[3] At the time of the relationship, Ford was married with two children and in his early 30s.[4]


Reception

_The Washington Post_{{'s}} Sibbie O'Sullivan described the book as cringe-worthy, but said, "this memoir is also educational, if you overlook its authorial excesses."[5] Anthony Breznican writing in _Entertainment Weekly_ gave the book a rating of Bâˆ’, saying, "There isn't a lot of insight into the character or the creation of a movie that means so much to so many, but there's tremendous insight into the volatile heart of a young woman, seen through the eyes of her wiser, older self still seeking her place in the universe."[6]

In early January 2017, shortly after Fisher's death, it topped _The New York Times_ Non-Fiction Best Sellers.[7]

In 2017, the book was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Related Work[8] and won the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[9]
