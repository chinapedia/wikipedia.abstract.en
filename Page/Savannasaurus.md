_SAVANNASAURUS_ is a genus of titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of Queensland, Australia, containing one species, _SAVANNASAURUS ELLIOTTORUM_, named in 2016 by Poropat _et al_.[1] The only known specimen was originally nicknamed "Wade".[2][3] The holotype is held on display at the Australian Age of Dinosaurs museum.


Description

_Savannasaurus_ was a medium-sized titanosaur about in length.[4] The sacrum and the fused ischium-pubis complex are both over one metre in width at their narrowest points, making _Savannasaurus_ an unusually wide-bodied titanosaur. In addition to this, the describers identified several other distinguishing characteristics: the first few caudal vertebrae have shallow pits, or fossae, in their sides, a feature that was previously only known among brachiosaurids; the edges of the sternal plates are straight, not kidney-shaped like other titanosaurs; the end of the fourth metacarpal is hourglass-shaped; there is a ridge on the side of the pubis extending forward and downward from the obturator foramen; and the astragalus is taller than it is wide or long.[5]

As with other titanosauriforms, the internal texture of the vertebrae is pneumatized by many small holes (camellate), and the dorsal ribs also bear pneumatic cavities. The dorsal vertebrae have ridges on the sides of their bottom faces as in _Diamantinasaurus_ and _Opisthocoelicaudia_, but _Savannasaurus_ lacks the keel on the bottom of the dorsal vertebrae as in these species; the dorsal neural spines are also not split into two, unlike _Opisthocoelicaudia_. The known cervical vertebrae and dorsal vertebrae are opisthocoelous, while all of the caudal vertebrae are amphicoelous unlike most other titanosaurs.[6]


Discovery and naming

Savannasaurus.jpg The holotype specimen of _Savannasaurus_, AODF 660, was discovered in 2005 on the Belmont sheep station by David Elliot, founder of Australian Age of Dinosaurs. The Belmont sheep station, northeast of Winton, Queensland, is part of the upper Winton Formation which has been dated to the Cenomanian-Turonian (93.9 mya) based on detritial zircons.[7] One of the holotype's metatarsals was originally thought to have belonged to a theropod, but later excavations revealed the remainder of the skeleton.[8] The specimen consists of several cervical, dorsal, sacral, and caudal vertebrae, several ribs, portions of the shoulder girdle including a coracoid and both sternal plates, parts of the forelimbs including the feet, several elements of the hip, and bones from the hind foot, along with various fragments. The specimen was encased in a single concretion.[9]

The genus name of _Savannasaurus_, from Spanish _zavana_ ("savanna"), refers to the environment in which it was found. The species name honours the Elliott family and their contributions to Australian palaeontology.[10]


Phylogeny

A phylogenetic analysis conducted in 2016 found _Savannasaurus_ to be closely related to the contemporaneous _Diamantinasaurus_, as a non-lithostrotian titanosaur.[11]


Paleoecology

_Savannasaurus_ lived alongside a diverse vertebrate fauna in the upper Winton Formation,[12] that included its close relative _Diamantinasaurus_, other sauropods _Wintonotitan_ and _Austrosaurus_, the megaraptoran theropod _Australovenator_, ankylosaurians, and hypsilophodonts, along with the lungfish _Metaceratodus_, turtles, the crocodilian _Isisfordia_, and pterosaurs. The environment it lived in would have been populated by plants such as ferns, ginkgoes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms.[13]
