JAMES LOVE is a Canadian guitarist from British Columbia. From 2010 to 2016, he was a member of the Canadian new wave/synthpop band Men Without Hats.[1]


Musical career

A graduate of the Roberto-Venn School of Luthiery, Love toured as a guitar technician in the road crew of Fenix TX, a Houston pop punk band.[2] He joined the group as a full member in early 2001, replacing Damon DeLaPaz as guitarist after the departure of drummer Donnie Vomit caused DeLaPaz to move to drums.[3] Love played on the band's final studio album, _Lechuza_, released in May 2001, and after a concert tour, he left the group later the same year.

From 2004 to 2006, Love toured with the Dillinger Escape Plan, and became a member of that band in 2013.[4] Love was also in a Houston-based heavy metal band called Torches of Fury, with whom he recorded the group's self-titled 2006 EP.[5][6] In Houston, he also formed Golden Axe, a heavy metal duo active from 2005 to 2011.[7][8]

Love joined Men Without Hats in 2010 as a touring member of the revived 1980s band, and subsequently returned to Canada. The group's leader, Ivan Doroschuk, made Love a full member of the Vancouver-based group, and Love appeared on their 2012 album _Love in the Age of War_, the first Men Without Hats album in nine years.[9] He was replaced as guitarist in October 2016, several weeks before the band began a European tour.[10]
