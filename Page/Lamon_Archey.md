Early life

Born in 1981, Archey was raised in San Mateo, California by his grandparents.[3][4] Being an only child, Archey was an introvert which didn't help with making friends in school.[5] Archey played baseball and football during his first two years of high school.[6] While Archey has a relationship with his mother, though she moved around quite often,[7] he had very little contact with his father, who passed when Lamon was 20 years old.[8] After high school, Archey worked as a carpenter installing floors for two years. He then moved to Los Angeles with his uncle where he found work as an emergency medial technician.[9][10] Upon birth, Archey's mother had given him a different name but his grandfather felt it sounded like a girl's name so it was changed to Lamon.[11] Archey has 12 tattoos.[12]


Career

Living in Los Angeles, Archey took up modeling after he was scouted at a job fair.[13] He credits modeling with helping him break out of his shell. He was later advised by manager Michael Bruno to get into acting classes so he could get a gig on a soap.[14] After about two years of acting classes with no results, Archey was ready to give up when he booked two under-five roles on _Days of Our Lives_.[15][16] In December 2012, Archey was cast in the recurring role of Mason Wilder on _The Young and the Restless_.[17] Archey vacated the role in early 2014.[18] In 2016, Archey returned to _Days of Our Lives_ in the newly created contract role of Eli Grant. He appeared onscreen in February 2017.[19] In March 2017, Archey appeared in the television film _Can't Buy Love_.[20]


Personal life

Archey began dating model and actress Mercedes Cornett in February 2006.[21] The duo had previously met at a fashion show in 2003 and kept in contact.[22] The couple became engaged in 2010. They share a son Caden (born July 9, 2009) and daughter Gaia (born May 29, 2012). Archey has another son, Machiah (born September 8, 2002) from a previous relationship.[23][24][25] In 2018, Archey stated that he and Cornett planned to wed in February 2019 in a small ceremony.[26]
