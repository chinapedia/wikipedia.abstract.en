Plot

Gussie Fink-Nottle is to visit Deverill Hall but gets drunk and ends up sentenced to 14 days in jail. Bertie is also due there, where Aunt Agatha is trying to match him up with Gertrude Winkworth. So that Gussie doesn't get in trouble, Bertie turns up pretending to be him, but then Gussie turns up too (having just been fined) with Jeeves posing as his valet. Gussie pretends to be Bertie and woos Gertrude successfully. Meanwhile, Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright, who is in love with Gertrude, appears (he has been rejected by the fierce Dame Daphne Winkworth and her four sisters), pretending to be Bertie's valet. When it seems that things can't get any worse, Aunt Agatha and Gussie's girlfriend Madeline Bassett turn up.
