History

Within two years, POA had opened offices in Seattle and Bellevue, Washington. In the 1990s, POA grew to become a prominent provider of facsimile and digital printing technology in the Pacific Northwest.

In 2013, POA expanded into Colorado with the acquisition of DOCUMation of the Rockies, Inc.[2]

In 2016, POA acquired Northwest Office Technologies, adding Spokane, Washington and Post Falls, Idaho to the company's regional footprint.[3]
