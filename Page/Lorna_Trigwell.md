LORNA MARIE-THERESE TRIGWELL married name LORNA SMITH is a South African international lawn bowler.[1]


Bowls career

Trigwell has won four Commonwealth Games medals at consecutive games and three World Outdoor Championship medals at consecutive championships. In 1994 she won a gold medal in the Women's fours at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria with Anna Pretorius, Colleen Grondein and Hester Bekker. It was the first time that South Africa had won a gold medal since 1958, following the return from their Anti-Apartheid Movement Commonwealth ban enforced in 1961.[2]

Four years later she repeated the feat in Kuala Lumpur when winning gold with Hester Bekker, Loraine Victor, and Trish Steyn at the Women's fours.[3]

After three bronze medals and a silver medal a fourth gold arrived in 2008 when she won the triples by winning the Women's Triples at the 2008 World Outdoor Bowls Championship in Christchurch.[4]

In 2008 she emigrated to Scotland and took up residence there. From 2012-2014 she set a Scottish record of three consecutive Scottish National Bowls Championships, bowling for the Linlithgow Bowling Club.[5] Controversy followed after the 2012 success because she was then overlooked by the Scottish selectors for the 2012 World Outdoor Bowls Championship and as a consequence made herself unavailable for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.[6]
