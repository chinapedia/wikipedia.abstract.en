TOURA () is a village in the Tyre District in South Lebanon.


Name

According to E. H. Palmer in 1881, the name _Torah_ comes from "flowing water".[1]


History

In 1875, Victor Guérin found here 450 Metawileh. He further noted that the village occupied "the summit of a hill entirely covered with fig-trees."[2]

In 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's _Survey of Western Palestine_ (SWP) described it: "A village of mud and stone, situated on the top of a hill, and surrounded by figs, olives, and arable land. There are a spring and cisterns. It contains about 200 Metawileh."[3]
