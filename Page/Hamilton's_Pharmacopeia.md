The show follows Hamilton Morris as he explores the history, chemistry, and societal impact of psychoactive substances. It chronicles Morris' travels and first-hand experiences, as well as interviews with scientists, shamans, and fringe culture figures.[1][2]


Background

Hamilton Morris, son of Oscar-winning documentarian Errol Morris, began writing for the print magazine _VICE_ while he was still a sophomore at The New School. His first article, under the pseudonym D.H. Ticklish, reported on emerging psychoactive drugs. After publishing a second article, about young Hasidic men converting to rituals with psychedelics, Morris started a column called _Hamilton's Pharmacopeia_. This evolved into an identically titled webseries on VBS.tv, which developed into the television program for Viceland.[3][4]

Morris' unique qualifications include studies under psychedelics expert Nicolas Langlitz at The New School and scientific publications as a pharmacology researcher at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia. He works as a contributor to _Harper's Magazine_ and _National Geographic TV_, as a correspondent for _VICE_ on HBO, and as a science editor for _VICE Magazine_.[5][6]

Morris publicly advocates psychonaut interests, following in the footsteps of drug developer and self-tester Alexander Shulgin, who authored the seminal text on phenethylamines, a class of drugs including MDMA. His scholarly approach also incorporates what he calls "ethno-chemistry," an anthropological exploration of the cultural matrix that influences drug use.[7]
