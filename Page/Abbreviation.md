text with abbreviations]]

An ABBREVIATION (from Latin _brevis_, meaning _short_ [1]) is a shortened form of a word or phrase, by any method. It may consist of a group of letters or words taken from the full version of the word or phrase, for example, the word _abbreviation_ can itself be represented by the abbreviation _abbr._, _abbrv._, or _abbrev._; nil by mouth is an abbreviated medical instruction. It may also consist of initials only, a mixture of initials and words, or words or letters representing words in another language (for example, e.g., i.e. or RSVP). Some types of abbreviations are acronyms (which are pronounceable), initialisms (using initials only), or grammatical contractions or crasis.

An abbreviation is a shortening by any of these, or other, methods.


Different types of abbreviation

Acronyms, initialisms, contractions and crasis share some semantic and phonetic functions, and all four are connected by the term "abbreviation" in loose parlance.[2]

Acronyms and initialisms are regarded as subsets of abbreviations (e.g. by the Council of Science Editors); they are abbreviations that consist of a group of initials and/or parts of words that together create a pronounceable word (acronym), or just the initial letters, pronounced as individual letters (initialism).

A contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of the parts; a contraction of a word or words is made by omitting certain letters or syllables and bringing together the first and last letters or elements, such as "I'm" . A contraction may be regarded as a type of abbreviation, but not vice versa.


History

Abbreviations have a long history, created so that spelling out a whole word could be avoided. This might be done to save time and space, and also to provide secrecy. Shortened words were used and initial letters were commonly used to represent words in specific applications. In classical Greece and Rome, the reduction of words to single letters was common.[3] In Roman inscriptions, "Words were commonly abbreviated by using the initial letter or letters of words, and most inscriptions have at least one abbreviation." However, "some could have more than one meaning, depending on their context. (For example, _A_ can be an abbreviation for many words, such as _ager_, _amicus_, _annus_, _as_, _Aulus_, _Aurelius_, _aurum_ and _avus_.)"[4]

Abbreviations in English were frequently used from its earliest days. Manuscripts of copies of the old English poem _Beowulf_ used many abbreviations, for example _7_ or _&_ for _and_, and _y_ for _since_, so that "not much space is wasted".[5] The standardisation of English in the 15th through 17th centuries included such a growth in the use of abbreviations.[6] At first, abbreviations were sometimes represented with various suspension signs, not only periods. For example, sequences like ‹er› were replaced with ‹ɔ›, as in ‹mastɔ› for _master_ and ‹exacɔbate› for _exacerbate_. While this may seem trivial, it was symptomatic of an attempt by people manually reproducing academic texts to reduce the copy time. An example from the Oxford University Register, 1503:

The Early Modern English period, between the 15th and 17th centuries, had abbreviations like _y^(e)_ for _Þ^(e)_, used for the word _the_: "hence, by later misunderstanding, Ye Olde Tea Shoppe."[7]

During the growth of philological linguistic theory in academic Britain, abbreviating became very fashionable. The use of abbreviation for the names of J. R. R. Tolkien and his friend C. S. Lewis, and other members of the Oxford literary group known as the Inklings, are sometimes cited as symptomatic of this. Likewise, a century earlier in Boston, a fad of abbreviation started that swept the United States, with the globally popular term OK generally credited as a remnant of its influence.[8][9]

After World War II, the British greatly reduced the use of the full stop and other punctuation points after abbreviations in at least semi-formal writing, while the Americans more readily kept such use until more recently, and still maintain it more than Britons. The classic example, considered by their American counterparts quite curious, was the maintenance of the internal comma in a British organisation of secret agents called the "Special Operations, Executive"—"S.O., E"—which is not found in histories written after about 1960.

But before that, many Britons were more scrupulous at maintaining the French form. In French, the period only follows an abbreviation if the last letter in the abbreviation is _not_ the last letter of its antecedent: "M." is the abbreviation for "monsieur" while "Mme" is that for "madame". Like many other cross-channel linguistic acquisitions, many Britons readily took this up and followed this rule themselves, while the Americans took a simpler rule and applied it rigorously.

Over the years, however, the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two-word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not. The U.S. media tend to use periods in two-word abbreviations like United States (U.S.), but not personal computer (PC) or television (TV). Many British publications have gradually done away with the use of periods in abbreviations.

Minimization of punctuation in typewritten material became economically desirable in the 1960s and 1970s for the many users of carbon-film ribbons since a period or comma consumed the same length of non-reusable expensive ribbon as did a capital letter.

Widespread use of electronic communication through mobile phones and the Internet during the 1990s allowed for a marked rise in colloquial abbreviation. This was due largely to increasing popularity of textual communication services such as instant- and text messaging. SMS, for instance, supports message lengths of 160 characters at most (using the GSM 03.38 character set). This brevity gave rise to an informal abbreviation scheme sometimes called Textese, with which 10% or more of the words in a typical SMS message are abbreviated.[10] More recently Twitter, a popular social networking service, began driving abbreviation use with 140 character message limits.


Style conventions in English

In modern English, there are several conventions for abbreviations, and the choice may be confusing. The only rule universally accepted is that one should be _consistent_, and to make this easier, publishers express their preferences in a style guide. Questions which arise include those in the following subsections.

Lowercase letters

If the original word was capitalized then the first letter of its abbreviation should retain the capital, for example Lev. for _Leviticus_. When a word is abbreviated to more than a single letter and was originally spelled with lower case letters then there is no need for capitalization. However, when abbreviating a phrase where only the first letter of each word is taken, then all letters should be capitalized, as in YTD for _year-to-date_, PCB for _printed circuit board_ and FYI for _for your information_. However, see the following section regarding abbreviations that have become common vocabulary: these are no longer written with capital letters.

Periods (full stops) and spaces

A period (full stop) is often used to signify an abbreviation, but opinion is divided as to when and if this should happen.

According to Hart's Rules, the traditional rule is that abbreviations (in the narrow sense that includes only words with the ending, and not the middle, dropped) terminate with a full stop, whereas contractions (in the sense of words missing a middle part) do not, but there are exceptions.[11] Fowler's Modern English Usage says full stops are used to mark both abbreviations and contractions, but recommends against this practice: advising them only for abbreviations and lower-case initialisms and not for upper-case initialisms and contractions.[12]

  Example                Category                       Short form   Source
  ---------------------- ------------------------------ ------------ -------------
  Doctor                 Contraction                    Dr           D——r
  Professor              Abbreviation                   Prof.        Prof...
  The Reverend           Abbreviation                   Rev.         Rev...
  The Reverend           Contraction                    Revd         Rev——d
  The Right Honourable   Contraction and Abbreviation   Rt Hon.      R——t Hon...

In American English, the period is usually included regardless of whether or not it is a contraction, e.g. _Dr._ or _Mrs._. In some cases, periods are optional, as in either _US_ or _U.S._ for _United States_, _EU_ or _E.U._ for _European Union_, and _UN_ or _U.N._ for _United Nations_. There are some house styles, however—American ones included—that remove the periods from almost all abbreviations. For example:

-   The U.S. Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices advises that periods should not be used with abbreviations on road signs, except for cardinal directions as part of a destination name. (For example, _"Northwest Blvd"_, _"W. Jefferson"_, and _"PED XING"_ all follow this recommendation.)
-   AMA style, used in many medical journals, uses no periods in abbreviations or acronyms, with almost no exceptions. Thus eg, ie, vs, et al., Dr, Mr, MRI, ICU, and hundreds of others contain no periods. The only exceptions are "No." (to avoid the appearance of "No"); initials within persons' names (such as "George R. Smith"); and "St." within persons' names when the person prefers it (such as "Emily R. St. Clair") (but not in city names such as _St Louis_ or _St Paul_). (AMA style also forgoes italic on terms long since naturalized into English from Latin, New Latin, other languages, or ISV; thus, no italic for eg, ie, vs, et al., in vivo, in vitro, or in situ.)

Acronyms that were originally capitalized (with or without periods) but have since entered the vocabulary as generic words are no longer written with capital letters nor with any periods. Examples are sonar, radar, lidar, laser, snafu, and scuba.

Today, spaces are generally not used between single-letter abbreviations of words in the same phrase, so one almost never encounters "U. S."

When an abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence, only one period is used: _The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C_.

Plural forms

There is a question about how to pluralize abbreviations, particularly acronyms. Often a writer will add an 's' following an apostrophe, as in "PC's". However, this style is not preferred by many style guides. For instance, Kate Turabian, writing about style in academic writings,[13] allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms "only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters". Turabian would therefore prefer "DVDs" and "URLs" and "Ph.D.'s", while the Modern Language Association[14] explicitly says, "do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of an abbreviation". Also, the American Psychological Association specifically says,[15][16] "without an apostrophe".

However, the 1999 style guide for _The New York Times_ states that the addition of an apostrophe is necessary when pluralizing all abbreviations, preferring "PC's, TV's and VCR's".[17]

Following those who would generally omit the apostrophe, to form the plural of run batted in, simply add an s to the end of RBI.[18]

-   RBIs

For all other rules, see below:

To form the plural of an abbreviation, a number, or a capital letter used as a noun, simply add a lowercase _s_ to the end. Apostrophes following decades and single letters are also common.

-   A group of MPs
-   The roaring 20s
-   Mind your Ps and Qs

To indicate the plural of the abbreviation or symbol of a unit of measure, the same form is used as in the singular.

-   1 lb or 20 lb
-   1 ft or 16 ft
-   1 min or 45 min

When an abbreviation contains more than one full point, _Hart's Rules_ recommends putting the _s_ after the final one.

-   Ph.D.s
-   M.Phil.s
-   the d.t.s

However, subject to any house style or consistency requirement, the same plurals may be rendered less formally as:

-   PhDs
-   MPhils
-   the DTs. (This is the recommended form in the _New Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors_.)

According to _Hart's Rules_, an apostrophe may be used in rare cases where clarity calls for it, for example when letters or symbols are referred to as objects.

-   The x's of the equation
-   Dot the i's and cross the t's

However, the apostrophe can be dispensed with if the items are set in italics or quotes:

-   The _x_s of the equation
-   Dot the 'i's and cross the 't's

In Latin, and continuing to the derivative forms in European languages as well as English, single-letter abbreviations had the plural being a doubling of the letter for note-taking. Most of these deal with writing and publishing. A few longer abbreviations use this as well.

Conventions followed by publications and newspapers

United States

Publications based in the U.S. tend to follow the style guides of _The Chicago Manual of Style_ and the Associated Press. The U.S. Government follows a style guide published by the U.S. Government Printing Office. The National Institute of Standards and Technology sets the style for abbreviations of units.

United Kingdom

Many British publications follow some of these guidelines in abbreviation:

-   For the sake of convenience, many British publications, including the BBC and _The Guardian_, have completely done away with the use of full stops or periods in all abbreviations. These include:
    -   Social titles, e.g. Ms or Mr (though these would usually have not had full stops—see above) Capt, Prof, _etc.;_
    -   Two-letter abbreviations for countries (_"US"_, not _"U.S."_);
    -   Abbreviations beyond three letters (full caps for all except initialisms);
    -   Words seldom abbreviated with lower case letters (_"PR"_, instead of _"p.r."_, or _"pr"_)
    -   Names (_"FW de Klerk"_, _"GB Whiteley"_, _"Park JS"_). A notable exception is _The Economist_ which writes _"Mr F. W. de Klerk"_.
    -   Scientific units (see Measurement below).
-   Acronyms are often referred to with only the first letter of the abbreviation capitalized. For instance, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation can be abbreviated as _"Nato"_ or _"NATO"_, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome as _"Sars"_ or _"SARS"_ (compare with _"laser"_ which has made the full transition to an English word and is rarely capitalised at all).
-   Initialisms are always written in capitals; for example the _"British Broadcasting Corporation"_ is abbreviated to _"BBC"_, never _"Bbc"_. An initialism is similar to acronym but is not pronounced as a word.
-   When abbreviating scientific units, no space is added between the number and unit (100mph, 100m, 10cm, 10°C). (This is contrary to the SI standard; see below.)

Miscellaneous and general rules

-   A doubled letter appears in abbreviations of some Welsh names, as in Welsh the double "l" is a separate sound: "Ll. George" for (British prime minister) David Lloyd George.
-   Some titles, such as "Reverend" and "Honourable", are spelt out when preceded by "the", rather than as "Rev." or "Hon." respectively. This is true for most British publications, and some in the United States.
-   A repeatedly used abbreviation should be spelt out for identification on its first occurrence in a written or spoken passage.[19] Abbreviations likely to be unfamiliar to many readers should be avoided.


Measurement shorthand—symbol or abbreviation

Writers often use shorthand to denote units of measure. Such shorthand can be an abbreviation, such as "in" for "inch" or can be a symbol such as "km" for "kilometre/kilometer".

The shorthand "in" applies to English only—in Afrikaans for example, the shorthand "dm" is used for the equivalent Afrikaans word "duim".[20] Since both "in" and "dm" are contractions of the same word, but in different languages, they are abbreviations. A symbol on the other hand, defined as "Mark or character taken as the conventional sign of some object or idea or process"[21] applies the appropriate shorthand by _substitution_ rather than by _contraction_. Since the shorthand for kilometre/kilometer (_quilômetro_ in Portuguese or _χιλιόμετρο_ in Greek) is "km" in both languages and the letter "k" does not appear in the expansion of either translation, "km" is a symbol as it is a substitution rather than a contraction. It is a logogram rather than an abbreviation.

In the International System of Units (SI) manual[22] the word "symbol" is used consistently to define the shorthand used to represent the various SI units of measure. The manual also defines the way in which units should be written, the principal rules being:

-   The conventions for upper and lower case letters must be observed—for example 1 MW (megawatts) is equal to 1,000,000,000 mW (milliwatts).
-   No periods should be inserted between letters—for example "m.s" (which is an approximation of "m·s", which correctly uses middle dot) is the symbol for "metres multiplied by seconds", but "ms" is the symbol for milliseconds.
-   No periods should follow the symbol unless the syntax of the sentence demands otherwise (for example a full stop at the end of a sentence).
-   The singular and plural versions of the symbol are identical—not all languages use the letter "s" to denote a plural.


Syllabic abbreviation

A syllabic abbreviation is usually formed from the initial syllables of several words, such as _Interpol_ = _INTERnational_ + _POLice_. It is a variant of the acronym. Syllabic abbreviations are usually written using lower case, sometimes starting with a capital letter, and are always pronounced as words rather than letter by letter. Syllabic abbreviations should be distinguished from portmanteaus, which combine two words without necessarily taking whole syllables from each.

Usage

Syllabic abbreviations are not widely used in English. Some UK government ministries such as Ofcom (_OFfice of COMmunications_) and Oftel (_OFfice of TELecommunications_) use this style.

New York City has various neighborhoods named by syllabic abbreviation, such as Tribeca (_TRIangle BElow CAnal Street_) and SoHo (_SOuth of HOuston Street_). This usage has spread into other American cities, giving SoMa, San Francisco (_SOuth of MArket_) and LoDo, Denver (_LOwer DOwntown_), among others.

Partially syllabic abbreviations are preferred by the US Navy, as it increases readability amidst the large number of initialisms that would otherwise have to fit into the same acronyms. Hence _DESRON 6_ is used (in the full capital form) to mean "Destroyer Squadron 6", while _COMNAVAIRLANT_ would be "Commander, Naval Air Force (in the) Atlantic."

Languages other than English

Syllabic abbreviations prevailed in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union for naming the plethora of new bureaucratic organisations. For example, _Gestapo_ stands for _GEheime STAats-POlizei_, or "secret state police". Similarly, Leninist organisations such as the _Comintern_ (_Communist International_) and _Komsomol_ (_KOMmunisticheskii SOyuz MOLodyozhi_, or "Communist youth union") used Russian language syllabic abbreviations. This has given syllabic abbreviations negative connotations in some countries, (as in Orwell's Newspeak), notwithstanding that such abbreviations were used in Germany even before the Nazis came to power, e.g., _Schupo_ for _Schutzpolizei_, and are still used, e.g. _Kripo_ for _Kriminalpolizei_.

In the modern Russian language words like _Minoborony_ (from MINisterstvo OBORONY — Ministry of Defence) and _Minobrnauki_ (from MINisterstvo OBRazovaniya i NAUKI — Ministry of Education and Science) are still commonly used.

Syllabic abbreviations were also typical for the German language used in the German Democratic Republic, e.g. _Stasi_ for _STAatsSIcherheit_ ("state security", the secret police) or _Vopo_ for _Volkspolizist_ ("people's policeman"). Other uses are in company or product names such as Aldi, from the name of the founder, Theo ALbrecht, and the German word _DIskont_ (discount) or Haribo, from the name of the founder and the headquarters of the company, HAns RIegl BOnn.

Syllabic abbreviations are more commenin Spanish; examples abound in organization names such as Pemex for _PEtróleos MEXicanos_ ("Mexican Petroleums") or Fonafifo for _FOndo NAcional de FInancimiento FOrestal_ (National Forestry Financing Fund).

In Southeast Asian languages, especially in Malay languages, syllabic abbreviations are also common; examples include Petronas (for _PETROliam NASional_, "National Petroleum"), its Indonesian equivalent Pertamina (from its original name _PERusahaan PerTAmbangan MInyak dan Gas Bumi NegAra_, "State Oil and Natural Gas Mining Company"), and Kemenhub (from _KEMENterian PerHUBungan_, "Ministry of Transportation")

East Asian languages whose writing systems use Chinese characters form abbreviations similarly by using key Chinese characters from a term or phrase. For example, in Japanese the term for the United Nations, _kokusai rengō_ (国際連合) is often abbreviated to _kokuren_ (国連). (Such abbreviations are called ryakugo (略語) in Japanese; see also Japanese abbreviated and contracted words). The syllabic abbreviation is frequently used for universities: for instance, _Tōdai_ (東大) for _Tōkyō daigaku_ (東京大学, University of Tokyo) and is used similarly in Chinese: _Běidà_ (北大) for _Běijīng Dàxué_ (北京大学, Peking University). The English phrase "Gung ho" originated as a Chinese abbreviation.
