OKINAWA SEIDOKAN is a style of Okinawa classical karate (Tode) and Kobudo founded in 1984 by Shian Toma. It is a synthesis of the Shorin Ryu katas, Motobu Ryu two-person open hand grappling and weapons techniques, and kobudo katas mostly of the Ryukyu Kobudo lineages.[1]


History

Shian Toma opened his dojo in 1960 teaching Shorin Ryu and Kobudo to the local populace and US Servicemen.

Originally Shian Toma named his dojo Toma Dojo, but later the name was changed to Sei-Do-Kan Dojo. This translated to "True Way House/Style" or A House of the True Way.

In the early 1960s Shian Toma's teachings were referred to as a style called Shorinji Ryu, and his dojo belonged to the Okinawa Kenpo Renmei under Shigeru Nakamura. In 1968 Shian Toma, Seikichi Uehara and Seiyu Oyata formed the Ryukyu Karate-do Renmei.[2] Then in 1969 the dojo became an official member of the Motobu Undun Di society and the style came to be referred to as Seidokan Motobu Ryu, Toma was promoted by the 13th Soke of Motobu-Ryu, Seikichi Uehara, to 9th Dan Hanshi. Toma was the first person to introduce Motobu-Ryu outside of Okinawa, teaching in North American. The first student of Master Toma to bring Seidokan to the United States was John E. Kennedy who was promoted to 9th Dan by Grand Master Toma in 1991. He is the senior student of Grand Master Toma and continues to teach the true Seidokan in Spencerport, NY. His senior student is John LaMarca, 8th Dan and chief of instruction for Toma Karate Dojos in Spencerport and Ariona.[3] After a separation from the Motobu Society in 1983, Shian Toma formed his own organization called the Zen Okinawa Seidokan Karate Kobudo.[4][5][6]

Toma's most prolific student was Col. Roy J. Hobbs, USAF Retired, who was President of the Seidokan Shihan Kai and the most senior student for many years before leaving to form his own association the Sekai Dentokan Budo Renmei, Inc. Within the Dentokan are taught three styles of Karate (Goju-Ryu, Shorin-Ryu, & Shito-Ryu), Okinawa Kobujutsu, Nihon Aikijujutsu, and Iaido (Morinaga Ha Toyama Ryu & Mugai Ryu). The mailing address for the Dentokan is 214 Evergreen Drive, O'Fallon, Illinois 62269, USA.[7]

A need to develop and organize Okinawa Seidokan's international efforts gave birth to the Ryukoku Seidokan Karate Kobudo Renmei (RSKKR) in 2008. This international headquarters is located at the Nix Seidokan Dojo, 5-20-24 Misato, Okinawa City, Okinawa-Ken, Japan 904-2153. Ron Nix is the International Ambassador and President of the RSKKR.

Due to the passing of the headmaster Shian Toma in May 2013, the mantel passed to Shigemitsu Tamaie of Yomitan Okinawa Japan to become the second headmaster of Okinawa Seidokan. The surviving Toma family officially retired the original organization "Zen Okinawa Seidokan Karate Kobudo Renmei" name. The first word 'Zen' was then dropped out of respect to the Toma Family wishes and Shigemitsu Tamaie formed the 'Okinawa Seidokan Karate Kobudo Renmei' (OSKKR) as the 'Honbu Dojo'. Shigemitsu Tamaie and Ron Nix travel out of Okinawa to teach seminars as well as host visiting karateka from all over the world to come to the heart of karate and train in the Okinawa Seidokan system.

In 2016 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Curtis_Michial_Jones%7CC. Michial Jones], who was graded to Shihan by Shian Toma and to Kyoshi by Col. Roy J. Hobbs in Seidokan Karate and Kobudo, founded the International Karate Kobudo Kyokai to further the teachings of Shian Toma.

The largest contingent of Seidokan practitioners, outside of Okinawa Japan, exist in the United States of America.
