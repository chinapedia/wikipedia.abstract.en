In mathematics, the ASCENDING CHAIN CONDITION (ACC) and DESCENDING CHAIN CONDITION (DCC) are finiteness properties satisfied by some algebraic structures, most importantly ideals in certain commutative rings.[1][2][3] These conditions played an important role in the development of the structure theory of commutative rings in the works of David Hilbert, Emmy Noether, and Emil Artin. The conditions themselves can be stated in an abstract form, so that they make sense for any partially ordered set. This point of view is useful in abstract algebraic dimension theory due to Gabriel and Rentschler.


Definition

A partially ordered set (poset) _P_ is said to satisfy the ASCENDING CHAIN CONDITION (ACC) if every strictly ascending sequence of elements eventually terminates. Equivalently, given any weakly ascending sequence

_a_₁ ≤ _a_₂ ≤ _a_₃ ≤ ⋯,
there exists a positive integer _n_ such that

_a__(_n_) = _a__(_n_ + 1) = _a__(_n_ + 2) = ⋯.
Similarly, _P_ is said to satisfy the DESCENDING CHAIN CONDITION (DCC) if every strictly descending sequence of elements of _P_ eventually terminates, that is, there is no infinite descending chain. Equivalently, every weakly descending sequence

_a_₁ ≥ _a_₂ ≥ _a_₃ ≥ ⋯
of elements of _P_ eventually stabilizes.

Comments

-   The descending chain condition on _P_ is equivalent to _P_ being well-founded: every nonempty subset of _P_ has a minimal element (also called the MINIMAL CONDITION or MINIMUM CONDITION).
-   Similarly, the ascending chain condition is equivalent to _P_ being converse well-founded: every nonempty subset of _P_ has a maximal element (the MAXIMAL CONDITION or MAXIMUM CONDITION).
-   Trivially every finite poset satisfies both ACC and DCC.
-   A totally ordered set that satisfies the descending chain condition is a well-ordered set (assuming the axiom of dependent choice).
