"TOWER OF SONG" is a song written by Leonard Cohen that appears on his 1988 album _I'm Your Man_. In a 2014 reader's poll, _Rolling Stone_ listed it as the 8th favorite Cohen song.[1]

The genesis of "Tower of Song" is described in Ira Nadel's 1996 Cohen memoir _Various Positions_:

    "Tower of Song" is the keynote work of _I'm Your Man_. With it, Cohen wanted to "make a definitive statement about the heroic enterprise of the craft" of songwriting. In the early eighties, he called the work "Raise My Voice in Song." His concern was with the aging songwriter, and the "necessity to transcend one's own failure by manifesting as the singer, as the songwriter." He had abandoned the song, but one night in Montreal he finished the lyrics and called an engineer and recorded it in one take with a toy synthesizer.[2]

Cohen revised the song, which contains the rumination, "I was born like this, I had no choice/I was born with the gift of a golden voice." Ever mindful of his reputation as a "flat singer" among critics, audiences often reacted when Cohen sang these lines live. Cohen also cited Hank Williams, a songwriter he had professed great admiration for, in the song ("..._a hundred floors above me_...").

Cohen recited the lyrics in full when he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[3][4]

"Tower of Song" has been covered by many artists,[5] notably on the tribute albums _I'm Your Fan_ (separate covers by Robert Forster and by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds) and _Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man_ (separate covers by Martha Wainwright and U2). It also appears, among others, on Marianne Faithfull's album _Vagabond Ways_, Tom Jones' album _Spirit in the Room_ and The Jesus & Mary Chain's _Rollercoaster EP_.

Shaar Hashomayim Choir, Willie Nelson, CÃ©line Dion, Peter Gabriel and Chris Martin performed the song at the 2017 _Tower of Song: A Memorial Tribute to Leonard Cohen_ concert.[6]
