BLEN MESFIN (Amharic: ብሌን መስፍን) is an official in Ethiopia’s opposition Semayawi (Blue) Party.[1] In 2016, she was named one of twenty women political prisoners in the FreeThe20 campaign by Samantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.[2]

Mesfin was arrested at a protest in Addis Ababa in April 2015.[3] The protest was for 26 Ethiopians killed by a group called Islamic State in Libya.[4] More than 30 members of the Semayawi Party were arrested before an April 27 political rally.[5]

Two other members of the Semayawi Party, Meron Alemayehu (ሜሮን አለማየሁ ) and Nigist Wondifraw (ንግስት ወንዲፍራው), were also arrested. They were #5 and #6 in the FreeThe20 campaign. They are now free.[6]
