Ceremony.lifeguard.london.arp.jpg in Whitehall, London]] __ (also LIFE-GUARD, or HOUSEHOLD TROOPS[1]) has been, since the 15th century, the designation for the military security guards who protected __ (royals and nobles) — usually members of the highest nobility who ruled over states of the Holy Roman Empire and later its former territory — from danger. The __ should not be mixed up with bodyguard (__), which may refer also to a single private individual.[2]

In the Kingdom of France, the Garde du Corps was established (with reference to the __) in 1440. It was abolished after the French Revolution, re-established in 1815, and finally dissolved in 1830. In addition, Napoleon III set up the Cent-gardes for his own protection.
