Plot

The story of two best friends, aspiring screenwriter Elliot (Patton Oswalt), and aspiring actor John (Paul Rudd), who was kicked out of acting school, whose dreams of super-stardom have fizzled and have been fired from every job they've ever done. After John's disastrous interview with celebrity Brett Anderson (Reid Scott), he and Elliot make a pact to become famous before their 30th birthday in 24 hours. In their first attempt they get beaten up by a homeless man named Archie (Mike Judge) after trying to get a check back from him when they found out the camera only filmed their feet and in their second attempt they get rescued from a fire, Elliot by an old woman. After an interview is denied, John concludes that it's not fame they want; its infamy.

Elliot and John attempt to hack a company using the names "deadly jester" and "fist of satan" but the owner, Marvin Masterson (Paul Scheer), retaliates by using his "reverse-screw-driver" to delete all of John's pornography and melt Elliot and John's computer. John later decides to go on a killing spree in order to get more attention. Elliot is reluctant to help John with this, but eventually decides to do it, saying to him that he can't do it alone. They buy chloroform to use to kill their elderly neighbor, but John has second thoughts. Elliot and John then discover that while in disguise, during one of their previous attempts at fame, they became witnesses to a robbery and are now being called the "mystery witnesses". The two go on TV and say they are the "mystery witnesses," and they become a media sensation with the help of Sally and Linda (Kate Micucci and Riki Lindhome), two girls who work at a mall and whom the boys flirt with. However, when brought to the police station soon after, they are informed by Detective Donahue (John Ennis) that the man who committed the robbery and was arrested is actually a relative of the member of a Cleveland crime syndicate and the two are now being forced to go to the witness protection program so that his family members won't find and kill them. Desperate not to throw their life away, the two run away from the station.

Elliot and John go to Sally and Linda's apartment to get away from the cops and come up with an idea to kill the mystery witnesses. Elliot and John go to the Nerd King (Hannibal Buress), the overweight owner of a collectible store and a trade partner for tools they had used in their fame attempts up to that point, and using a rare collectible action figure, are able to get help from him to fake the deaths of the "mystery witnesses". After it is done by the two, they return to Sally and Linda's apartment to find it filled with the press. However, the two are arrested for running away and are put in the witness protection program, but they are able to say their goodbyes to Sally and Linda. In the end, John and Elliot are seen working at a diner and wearing fake mustaches. They smile knowing that they have finally gotten what they wanted, fame.

Production

_Nerdland_ is based on a concept that screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker had been pitching for several years in various iterations: first as a live-action movie, then a television series, then a series of animated shorts, and finally an animated film. Walker explains, "I have been a huge fan of _Metalocalypse_, _Superjail!_, and a lot of the cartoons that are on Adult Swim, especially the stuff done by Titmouse, Inc.. I would watch _Metalocalypse_ and the little bird logo would come up at the end and chirp and I’d think, 'Who are these lunatics?' We set up a meeting with Titmouse and gave them the script. I was expecting Chris and Shannon Prynoski, who created and run Titmouse, to just say, 'No, this is a stupid idea.' But they said yes, and we went from there. I was super excited that Chris was interested in overseeing the making of it as a feature. Once he said yes he also said yes to directing it, which was great because I’m a huge fan of his."[1]
