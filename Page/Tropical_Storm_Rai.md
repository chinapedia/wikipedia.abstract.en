Tropical Storm Rai|the 2016 tropical storm}} TROPICAL STORM RAI was a weak and short-lived tropical cyclone which affected Indochina in September 2016. Formed from a tropical disturbance on September 11, the system developed into a tropical storm and reached its peak intensity on September 12, before making landfall in Vietnam and affecting Laos, Thailand and Cambodia. In Vietnam total damage reached US$37 million.


Meteorological history

During September 11, the Japan Meteorological Agency started to monitor a tropical depression, that had developed within an unfavourable environment for further development, about to the northeast of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.[1][2] The system had a broad low level circulation centre, with unorganized deep convection located along the southern edge of the system.[3] During that day the system gradually developed further, before the Joint Typhoon Warning centre initiated advisories and classified it as Tropical depression 19W during the next day.

By the next day, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression with the given designation of _19W_.[4] Satellite then showed that the LLCC of 19W was broad and defined with some deep convective banding.[5] However, its LLCC became exposed, though its deep convection remained in place.[6] Hours later, the JMA had declared that 19W had strengthened into a tropical storm, with the name _Rai_.[7] Although it has strengthened, the JTWC issued its final advisory without upgrading it to a tropical storm, whilst Rai made landfall over Central Vietnam, about 94 km (59 mi) southeast of the city of Da Nang.[8] According to the JMA, Rai reached its maximum intensity only as a weak tropical storm over land,[9] however they issued their last advisory and was downgraded into a tropical depression six hours later.[10]


Preparations and impact

On late September 12, Tropical Storm Rai, known in Vietnam as CƠN BÃO SỐ 4 (_the 4th storm in 2016_), made landfall in Quảng Nam Province and Quảng Ngãi Province in Central Vietnam.[11] The storm killed 12 people in Vietnam.[12] Heavy rains in Central Vietnam caused flooding and the bursting of the Bung River 2 hydroelectricity plant in Quảng Nam province of Vietnam, which released 28 million cubic meters of water and washed away 2 workers.[13] Damage from the bursting was ₫5 billion (US$224,000).[14] Four ships were sunk along central Vietnam's coastline and 2 others were left stranded, while 5 houses were completely destroyed and the roofs of 275 others were torn off.[15] Damage to the power grid in Quảng Nam, Vietnam reached ₫1.4 billion (US$63,000).[16] In Triệu Phong District, Quảng Trị Province, total damage reached ₫2.2 billion (US$99,000).[17] In Bố Trạch District, Quảng Bình Province, heavy rains caused the flooding and total damage reached ₫14 billion (US$628,000).[18] The Treasury of Thừa Thiên–Huế Province estimated total damages by the storm had reached ₫203 million (US$9,100).[19] In Lý Sơn District, Quảng Ngãi Province, of onion field was affected by the storm; damages exceeded ₫10 billion (US$449,000).[20] Flooding triggered by the storm in North–Central Vietnam caused severe damage. In Hà Tĩnh Province, the total damage by the flooding reached ₫47 billion (US$2.1 million)[21] and in Nghệ An Province total damage is ₫748 billion (US$33.6 million).[22]
