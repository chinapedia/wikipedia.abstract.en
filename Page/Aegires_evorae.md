_AEGIRES EVORAE_ is a species of sea slug, a nudibranch, a marine, opisthobranch gastropod mollusc in the family Aegiridae.[1]

The specific name _evorae_ is in honour of Cesária Évora, a Cape Verdean popular singer.[2]

This species was described from Calhetinha, in the northeast of the island of Sal, Cape Verde Islands.[3]


Description

_Aegires evorae_ has a cream-white body with a patchy brown overlay which is broken by regularly spaced, circular patches of darker brown dots. The rhinophores have a distinctive narrow band of brown below the tip.[4]


Ecology

This nudibranch probably feeds on the calcareous sponge, _Clathrina coriacea_.[5]
