The KELLOGG BREAKFAST COUNCIL was an organization made up of nutrition experts, whose stated purpose on the Kellogg's cereal company website was to provide independent nutrition advice to the company.[1] Council members included a professor of nutrition, a pediatrician, as well as several dietitians.[2]


History

The Breakfast Council was formed in 2011,[3] after a survey carried out by the Kellogg company showed that only 34% of Americans ate breakfast.[4] Its members were described on the Kellogg website as "independent experts".[5] A press release from the company described them as "third party" nutrition experts,[6] who would give nutrition advice to the company and provide information to the public about the benefits of eating a healthy breakfast.[7]

The Council members taught a continuing education class for dietitians, and published an academic paper about cereal nutrition.[8] They also suggested changes to the governmentâ€™s dietary guidelines[9] and made positive comments on social media[10] and other online forums about cereal.[11] Kellogg included comments from these experts in cereal commercials.[12]

In 2016, the Associated Press uncovered emails and a copy of a contract showing that the council's members were paid by Kellogg.[13] The average annual compensation was $13,000, and the contract prohibited them from working for Kellogg's competition.[14] The members were provided with a toolkit which included suggested wording for social media posts about cereal.[15] The council members' relationship with Kellogg was not always revealed when the posts were made.[16]

In May 2016, the council members' contracts expired, and the council ceased to operate.[17]
