_ERETMOCERA MICROBARBARA_ is a moth of the Scythrididae family. It was described by Baron Walsingham in 1907. It is found in Algeria.[1]

The wingspan is about 10Â mm. The forewings are brownish fuscous, sprinkled and mottled with pale greyish ochreous, which has a tendency to form an irregular fascia before the middle and an oblique transverse band before the apex, more distinctly visible on the costa than below it. A few long greyish ochreous scales project into the brownish fuscous cilia, but the amount of such scaling there and on the wing-surface is variable. The hindwings are slightly paler than the forewings, pale brownish fuscous, with darker brownish fuscous cilia.[2]
