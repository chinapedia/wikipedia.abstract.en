_COUPLE-ISH_ is a Canadian LGBTQ+ web series created by Kaitlyn Alexander, who also stars alongside Mercedes Morris and Sharon Belle.[1] The series revolves around Dee Warson, a non-binary artist, who is looking for a new roommate with the help of their sister, Amy Warson. Soon they are entangled in a government conspiracy so that their new roommate, Rachel Mannt, isn't forced to leave the country. The first episode aired December 9, 2015[2][3] and new episodes were posted twice a week. Season one is made up of 22 episodes and the season finale was posted on March 9, 2016.[4]

In 2016, the series was nominated for a Streamy award, ultimately losing to _Brooklyn Sound_.[5]


Background and development

The series was made possible by the support of nearly 800 backers through the series' Kickstarter campaign.[6][7] An Indiegogo campaign was launched in November 2016 to fundraise a second season, with a fixed goal of $45,000 USD, which was successfully raised in under a month.[8]


Plot

The series begins with Dee Warson stressing out over their apartment rent they cannot afford alone, having just lost the person who was helping with bills. Their sister, Amy Warson, suggests they get a roommate and after a little convincing, they interview several candidates. One being Rachel Mannt, an English woman who moved to Canada to attend university, who seems to meet the criteria they're looking for.

Eight months later, it comes to light that Rachel's visa will expire soon and in a desperate attempt to remain in the country, has told the Canadian government that her and Dee are in a common law partnership. The series follows the two hosting a web show that flaunts their relationship so that when investigated, their relationship seems legitimate.[9]
