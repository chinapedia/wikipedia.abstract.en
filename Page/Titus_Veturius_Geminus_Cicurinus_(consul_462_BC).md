Biography

Consulship

In 462 BC, he became consul with Lucius Lucretius Tricipitinus. The Romans recovered from a severe epidemic that occurred the year before and had taken the two consuls Publius Servilius Priscus and Lucius Aebutius Helva, the augurs Titus Verginius Tricostus Rutilus and Manius Valerius Volusus Maximus, and the _Curio Maximus_ Servius Sulpicius Camerinus Cornutus. Before the end of his consulship, a series of _interreges_ were nominated in order to organize new elections. This they conducted during the term of the _interrex_, Publius Valerius Publicola in 462 BC.

War against the Aequi and the Volsci

The Aequi and Volsci attempted to take advantage of the consequences of the epidemic and attacked the territories of Rome and the Hernici. Geminus easily put the Volsci to flight while Lucius Lucretius inflicted a serious defeat against the pillagers, recovering the loot that they had taken from Roman territory.[1] For these victories, Lucius Lucretius was given the honor of celebrating a triumph and Geminus was given an Ovation.[2][3]

The _rogatio Terentilia_

When the consuls were absent from Rome, leading their armies in campaign against the Aequi and the Volsci, Terentilius, tribune of the plebs, proposed a law creating a special commission charged with regulating consular power. Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, named _Praefectus urbi_ in absence of the consuls, opposed drafting the law and deferred the vote until the return of the consuls.

_Decemvirate_

In 451 BC, he was probably among the First Decemvirate - who wrote the first legal documents of Rome, the Law of the Twelve Tables, and who, according to tradition, governed Rome for one year with moderation.[4][5][6] However, it is not certain that he was a decemvir as ancient authors disagree on his name. The _Fasti Capitolini_ and Diodorus Siculus give the _praenomen_ of _Spurius_, Livy that of _Lucius_, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus that of _Titus_. While many of the decemvirs were also consuls, only Titus Veturius Geminus Cicurinus and Gaius Veturius Cicurinus match well with their filiations given by the _Fasti Capitolini_.
