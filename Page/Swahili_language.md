SWAHILI, also known as (translation: language of the Swahili people), is a Bantu language and the first language of the Swahili people. It is a lingua franca of the African Great Lakes region and other parts of eastern and south-eastern Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, some parts of Malawi and Zambia, Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).[1] Comorian, spoken in the Comoros Islands, is sometimes considered to be a dialect of Swahili, though other authorities consider it a distinct language.[2]

The exact number of Swahili speakers, be it native or second-language speakers, is unknown and a matter of debate. Various estimates have been put forward and they vary widely, ranging from 15 million to 50 million.[3] Swahili serves as a national language of the DRC, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Shikomor, the official language in Comoros and also spoken in Mayotte (), is related to Swahili.[4] Swahili is also one of the working languages of the African Union and officially recognised as a lingua franca of the East African Community.[5] In 2018 South Africa legalized the teaching of Swahili in South African schools as an optional subject to begin in 2020.[6]

A significant fraction of Swahili vocabulary derives from Arabic,[7] in part conveyed by Arabic-speaking Muslim inhabitants. For example, the Swahili word for "book" is , traceable back to the Arabic word (from the root _K-T-B_ "write"). However, the Swahili plural form of this word ("books") is , rather than the Arabic plural form , following the Bantu grammar in which is reanalysed as a nominal class prefix, whose plural is .[8]


Classification

Swahili is a Bantu language of the Sabaki branch.[9] In Guthrie's geographic classification, Swahili is in Bantu zone G, whereas the other Sabaki languages are in zone E70, commonly under the name _Nyika._ Local folk-theories of the language have often considered Swahili to be a mixed language because of its many loan words from Arabic, and the fact that Swahili people have historically been Muslims. However, historical linguists do not consider the Arabic influence on Swahili to be significant enough to classify it as a mixed language, since Arabic influence is limited to lexical items, most of which have only been borrowed after 1500, while the grammatical and syntactic structure of the language is typically Bantu.[10][11]


History

Askari_makumbusho_matini_Kiswahili_-_Kiarabu.png, Dar es Salaam (1927)]]

Origin

Its old name was Kingozi, but as traders came from Arab countries, their vocabulary intermingled with the language. It was originally written in Arabic script.[12]

The earliest known documents written in Swahili are letters written in Kilwa in 1711 in the Arabic script that were sent to the Portuguese of Mozambique and their local allies. The original letters are preserved in the Historical Archives of Goa, India.[13]

Its name comes from Arabic: سَاحِل _sāħil_ = "coast", broken plural سَوَاحِل _sawāħil_ = "coasts", سَوَاحِلِىّ _sawāħilï_ = "of coasts".

Colonial period

Swahili-pn.jpg introduced by Christian missionaries and colonial administrators. The text shown here is the Catholic version of the Lord's Prayer.[14]]]

Since Swahili was the language of commerce in East Africa, the colonial administrators wanted to standardize it.[15] In June 1928, an interterritorial conference attended by representatives of Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda, and Zanzibar took place in Mombasa. The Zanzibar dialect was chosen as standard Swahili for those areas,[16] and the standard orthography for Swahili was adopted.[17]

Current status

Swahili has become a second language spoken by tens of millions in three African Great Lakes countries (Kenya, Tanzania, and the DRC) where it is an official or national language. In 1985, with the 8–4–4 system of education, Swahili was made a compulsory subject in all Kenyan schools.[18] Swahili and closely related languages are spoken by relatively small numbers of people in Burundi, Comoros, Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda, Zambia and Rwanda.[19] The language was still understood in the southern ports of the Red Sea in the 20th century.[20][21]

Some 80 percent of approximately 62 million Tanzanians speak Swahili in addition to their first languages.[22] The five eastern provinces of the DRC are Swahili-speaking. Nearly half the 81 million Congolese reportedly speak it.[23] Swahili speakers may number 120 to 150 million in total.[24]

Swahili is among the first languages in Africa for which language technology applications have been developed. Arvi Hurskainen is one of the early developers. The applications include a spelling checker[25], part-of-speech tagging[26], a language learning software[27], an analysed Swahili text corpus of 25 million words[28], an electronic dictionary[29], and machine translation[30] between Swahili and English. The development of language technology also strengthens the position of Swahili as a modern medium of communication.[31]


Phonology

Unlike the majority of Niger-Congo languages,[32] Swahili lacks contrastive tone (pitch contour). As a result of that and the language's shallow orthography, Swahili is said to be the easiest African language for an English speaker to learn.[33]

Vowels

Standard Swahili has five vowel phonemes: , , , , and . Vowels are never reduced, regardless of stress, but they are pronounced in full as follows:[34]

-   is pronounced like the "a" in _fAther_.

-   is pronounced like the "e" in _sEt_.

-   is pronounced like the "ee" in _sEE_.

-   is pronounced somewhat like the "o" in _fOrd_.

-   is pronounced like the "oo" in _pOOl_.

: Swahili consonant phonemes[35][36]

Some dialects of Swahili may also have the aspirated phonemes though they are unmarked in Swahili's Orthography.[37] "[I]n some Arabic loans (nouns, verbs, adjectives) emphasis or intensity is expressed by reproducing the original emphatic consonants and the uvular , or lengthening a vowel, where aspiration would be used in inherited Bantu words."[38]


Orthography

Bundesarchiv_Bild_105-DOA0075,_Deutsch-Ostafrika,_Einheimisches_Mädchen.jpg (ca. early 1900s)]]

Swahili is currently written in an alphabet close to English, except it does not use the letters Q and X.[39] There are two digraphs for native sounds, _ch_ and _sh_; _c_ is not used apart from unassimilated English loans and, occasionally, as a substitute for _k_ in advertisements. There are also several digraphs for Arabic sounds not distinguished in pronunciation outside of traditional Swahili areas.

The language used to be written in the Arabic script. Unlike adaptations of the Arabic script for other languages, relatively little accommodation was made for Swahili. There were also differences in orthographic conventions between cities and authors and over the centuries, some quite precise but others different enough to cause difficulties with intelligibility.

and , and were often conflated, but in some spellings, was distinguished from by rotating the _kasra_ 90° and was distinguished from by writing the _damma_ backwards.

Several Swahili consonants do not have equivalents in Arabic, and for them, often no special letters were created unlike, for example, Urdu script. Instead, the closest Arabic sound is substituted. Not only did that mean that one letter often stands for more than one sound, but also writers made different choices of which consonant to substitute. Here are some of the equivalents between Arabic Swahili and Roman Swahili:

  Swahili in Arabic Script   Swahili in Latin Alphabet
  -------------------------- ---------------------------
  Final                      Medial





























That was the general situation, but conventions from Urdu were adopted by some authors so as to distinguish aspiration and from : 'gazelle', 'roof'. Although it is not found in Standard Swahili today, there is a distinction between dental and alveolar consonants in some dialects, which is reflected in some orthographies, for example in __ 'to meet' vs. __ 'to be satisfied'. A _k_ with the dots of _y_, , was used for _ch_ in some conventions; _ky_ being historically and even contemporaneously a more accurate transcription than Roman _ch_. In Mombasa, it was common to use the Arabic emphatics for Cw, for example in __ (standard __) 'we' and __ (standard __) 'head'.

Particles such as __ are joined to the following noun, and possessives such as __ and __ are joined to the preceding noun, but verbs are written as two words, with the subject and tense–aspect–mood morphemes separated from the object and root, as in __ "he who told me".[40]


Grammar

Noun classes

Semantic motivation

The _ki-/vi-_ class historically consisted of two separate genders, artefacts (Bantu class 7/8, utensils and hand tools mostly) and diminutives (Bantu class 12), which were conflated at a stage ancestral to Swahili. Examples of the former are _kisu_ "knife", _kiti_ "chair" (from _mti_ "tree, wood"), _chombo_ "vessel" (a contraction of _ki-ombo_). Examples of the latter are _kitoto_ "infant", from _mtoto_ "child"; _kitawi_ "frond", from _tawi_ "branch"; and _chumba_ (_ki-umba_) "room", from _nyumba_ "house". It is the diminutive sense that has been furthest extended. An extension common to diminutives in many languages is _approximation_ and _resemblance_ (having a 'little bit' of some characteristic, like _-y_ or _-ish_ in English). For example, there is _kijani_ "green", from _jani_ "leaf" (compare English 'leafy'), _kichaka_ "bush" from _chaka_ "clump", and _kivuli_ "shadow" from _uvuli_ "shade". A 'little bit' of a verb would be an instance of an action, and such _instantiations_ (usually not very active ones) are found: _kifo_ "death", from the verb _-fa_ "to die"; _kiota_ "nest" from _-ota_ "to brood"; _chakula_ "food" from _kula_ "to eat"; _kivuko_ "a ford, a pass" from _-vuka_ "to cross"; and _kilimia_ "the Pleiades", from _-limia_ "to farm with", from its role in guiding planting. A resemblance, or being a bit like something, implies marginal status in a category, so things that are marginal examples of their class may take the _ki-/vi-_ prefixes. One example is _chura_ (_ki-ura_) "frog", which is only half terrestrial and therefore is marginal as an animal. This extension may account for disabilities as well: _kilema_ "a cripple", _kipofu_ "a blind person", _kiziwi_ "a deaf person". Finally, diminutives often denote contempt, and contempt is sometimes expressed against things that are dangerous. This might be the historical explanation for _kifaru_ "rhinoceros", _kingugwa_ "spotted hyena", and _kiboko_ "hippopotamus" (perhaps originally meaning "stubby legs").

Another class with broad semantic extension is the _m-/mi-_ class (Bantu classes 3/4). This is often called the 'tree' class, because _mti, miti_ "tree(s)" is the prototypical example. However, it seems to cover vital entities neither human nor typical animals: trees and other plants, such as _mwitu_ 'forest' and _mtama_ 'millet' (and from there, things made from plants, like _mkeka_ 'mat'); supernatural and natural forces, such as _mwezi_ 'moon', _mlima_ 'mountain', _mto_ 'river'; active things, such as _moto_ 'fire', including active body parts (_moyo_ 'heart', _mkono_ 'hand, arm'); and human groups, which are vital but not themselves human, such as _mji_ 'village', and, by analogy, _mzinga_ 'beehive/cannon'. From the central idea of _tree_, which is thin, tall, and spreading, comes an extension to other long or extended things or parts of things, such as _mwavuli_ 'umbrella', _moshi_ 'smoke', _msumari_ 'nail'; and from activity there even come active instantiations of verbs, such as _mfuo_ "metal forging", from _-fua_ "to forge", or _mlio_ "a sound", from _-lia_ "to make a sound". Words may be connected to their class by more than one metaphor. For example, _mkono_ is an active body part, and _mto_ is an active natural force, but they are also both long and thin. Things with a trajectory, such as _mpaka_ 'border' and _mwendo_ 'journey', are classified with long thin things, as in many other languages with noun classes. This may be further extended to anything dealing with time, such as _mwaka_ 'year' and perhaps _mshahara_ 'wages'. Animals exceptional in some way and so not easily fitting in the other classes may be placed in this class.

The other classes have foundations that may at first seem similarly counterintuitive.[41] In short,

-   Classes 1–2 include most words for people: kin terms, professions, ethnicities, etc., including translations of most English words ending in _-er._ They include a couple generic words for animals: _mnyama_ 'beast', _mdudu_ 'bug'.
-   Classes 5–6 have a broad semantic range of groups, expanses, and augmentatives. Although interrelated, it is easier to illustrate if broken down:
    -   Augmentatives, such as _joka_ 'serpent' from _nyoka_ 'snake', lead to titles and other terms of respect (the opposite of diminutives, which lead to terms of contempt): _Bwana_ 'Sir', _shangazi_ 'aunt', _fundi_ 'craftsman', _kadhi_ 'judge'.
    -   Expanses: _ziwa_ 'lake', _bonde_ 'valley', _taifa_ 'country', _anga_ 'sky'
        -   from this, mass nouns: _maji_ 'water', _vumbi_ 'dust' (and other liquids and fine particulates which may cover broad expanses), _kaa_ 'charcoal', _mali_ 'wealth', _maridhawa_ 'abundance'
    -   Collectives: _kundi_ 'group', _kabila_ 'language/ethnic group', _jeshi_ 'army', _daraja_ ' stairs', _manyoya_ 'fur, feathers', _mapesa_ 'small change', _manyasi_ 'weeds', _jongoo_ 'millipede' (large set of legs), _marimba_ 'xylophone' (large set of keys)
        -   from this, individual things found in groups: _jiwe_ 'stone', _tawi_ 'branch', _ua_ 'flower', _tunda_ 'fruit' (also the names of most fruits), _yai_ 'egg', _mapacha_ 'twins', _jino_ 'tooth', _tumbo_ 'stomach' (cf. English "guts"), and paired body parts such as _jicho_ 'eye', _bawa_ 'wing', etc.
        -   also collective or dialogic actions, which occur among groups of people: _neno_ 'a word', from _kunena_ 'to speak' (and by extension, mental verbal processes: _wazo_ 'thought', _maana_ 'meaning'); _pigo_ 'a stroke, blow', from _kupiga_ 'to hit'; _gomvi_ 'a quarrel', _shauri_ 'advice, plan', _kosa_ 'mistake', _jambo_ 'affair', _penzi_ 'love', _jibu_ 'answer', _agano_ 'promise', _malipo_ 'payment'
        -   From pairing, reproduction is suggested as another extension (fruit, egg, testicle, flower, twins, etc.), but these generally duplicate one or more of the subcategories above
-   Classes 9–10 are used for most typical animals: _ndege_ 'bird', _samaki_ 'fish', and the specific names of typical beasts, birds, and bugs. However, this is the 'other' class, for words not fitting well elsewhere, and about half of the class 9–10 nouns are foreign loanwords. Loans may be classified as 9–10 because they lack the prefixes inherent in other classes, and most native class 9–10 nouns have no prefix. Thus they do not form a coherent semantic class, though there are still semantic extensions from individual words.
-   Class 11 (which takes class 10 for the plural) are mostly nouns with an "extended outline shape", in either one dimension or two:
    -   mass nouns that are generally localized rather than covering vast expanses: _uji_ 'porridge', _wali_ 'cooked rice'
    -   broad: _ukuta_ 'wall', _ukucha_ 'fingernail', _upande_ 'side' (≈ _ubavu_ 'rib'), _wavu_ 'net', _wayo_ 'sole, footprint', _ua_ 'fence, yard', _uteo_ 'winnowing basket',
    -   long: _utambi_ 'wick', _utepe_ 'stripe', _uta_ 'bow', _ubavu_ 'rib', _ufa_ 'crack', _unywele_ 'a hair'
        -   from 'a hair', singulatives of nouns, which are often class 6 ('collectives') in the plural: _unyoya_ 'a feather', _uvumbi_ 'a grain of dust', _ushanga_ 'a bead'
-   Class 14 are abstractions, such as _utoto_ 'childhood' (from _mtoto_ 'a child') and have no plural. They have the same prefixes and concord as class 11, except optionally for adjectival concord.
-   Class 15 are verbal infinitives.
-   Classes 16–18 are locatives. The Bantu nouns of these classes have been lost; the only permanent member is the Arabic loan _mahali_ 'place(s)', but in Mombasa Swahili, the old prefixes survive: _pahali_ 'place', _mwahali_ 'places'. However, any noun with the locative suffix _-ni_ takes class 16–18 agreement. The distinction between them is that class 16 agreement is used if the location is intended to be definite ("at"), class 17 if indefinite ("around") or involves motion ("to, toward"), and class 18 if it involves containment ("within"): _mahali pazuri_ 'a good spot', _mahali kuzuri_ 'a nice area', _mahali muzuri_ (it's nice in there).

Agreement

Swahili phrases agree with nouns in a system of concord, but if the noun refers to a human, they accord with noun classes 1–2 regardless of their noun class. Verbs agree with the noun class of their subjects and objects; adjectives, prepositions and demonstratives agree with the noun class of their nouns. In Standard Swahili _(Kiswahili sanifu)_, based on the dialect spoken in Zanzibar, the system is rather complex; however, it is drastically simplified in many local variants where Swahili is not a native language, such as in Nairobi. In non-native Swahili, concord reflects only animacy: human subjects and objects trigger _a-, wa-_ and _m-, wa-_ in verbal concord, while non-human subjects and objects of whatever class trigger _i-, zi-_. Infinitives vary between standard _ku-_ and reduced _i-._[42] ("Of" is animate _wa_ and inanimate _ya, za._)

In Standard Swahili, human subjects and objects of whatever class trigger animacy concord in _a-, wa-_ and _m-, wa-,_ and non-human subjects and objects trigger a variety of gender-concord prefixes.

Dialects and closely related languages

This list is based on _Swahili and Sabaki: a linguistic history_.

Dialects

Modern standard Swahili is based on _Kiunguja,_ the dialect spoken in Zanzibar Town, but there are numerous dialects of Swahili, some of which are mutually unintelligible, such as the following:[45]

Old dialects

Maho (2009) considers these to be distinct languages:

        -   _Kiamu_ is spoken in and around the island of Lamu (Amu).
        -   _Kipate_ is a local dialect of Pate Island, considered to be closest to the original dialect of Kingozi.
        -   _Kingozi_ is an ancient dialect spoken on the Indian Ocean coast between Lamu and Somalia and is sometimes still used in poetry. It is often considered the source of Swahili.
    -   Mombasa
        -   _Chijomvu_ is a subdialect of the Mombasa area.
        -   _Kimvita_ is the major dialect of Mombasa (also known as "Mvita", which means "war", in reference to the many wars which were fought over it), the other major dialect alongside Kiunguja.
        -   _Kingare_ is the subdialect of the Mombasa area.
    -   _Kimrima_ is spoken around Pangani, Vanga, Dar es Salaam, Rufiji and Mafia Island.

    -   Mafia, Mbwera
    -   Kilwa (extinct)
    -   _Kimgao_ used to be spoken around Kilwa District and to the south.

Other regions

In Somalia, where the Afroasiatic Somali language predominates, a variant of Swahili referred to as Chimwiini (also known as Chimbalazi) is spoken along the Benadir coast by the Bravanese people.[47] Another Swahili dialect known as Kibajuni also serves as the mother tongue of the Bajuni minority ethnic group, which lives in the tiny Bajuni Islands as well as the southern Kismayo region.[48][49]

In Oman, there are an estimated 22,000 people who speak Swahili.[50] Most are descendants of those repatriated after the fall of the Sultanate of Zanzibar.[51][52]

[43] Most Swahili adjectives begin with either a consonant or the vowels _i-_ or _e-_, listed separately above. The few adjectives beginning with other vowels do not agree with all noun classes since some are restricted to humans. NC 1 _m(w)-_ is _mw-_ before _a_ and _o,_ and reduces to _m-_ before _u_; _wa-_ does not change; and _ki-, vi-, mi-_ become _ch-, vy-, my-_ before _o_ but not before _u_: _mwanana, waanana_ "gentle", _mwororo, waororo, myororo, chororo, vyororo_ "mild, yielding", _mume, waume, kiume, viume_ "male".
