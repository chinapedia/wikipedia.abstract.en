Qiao Fei, a university student majoring in French studies, has aspired to become a translator since she was young. Raised by a single mother suffering from a serious illness, she has to support herself working as a waitress. One night she gets into a trouble with a guest, and the two of them are taken to the police station. The guest happens to be Cheng Jiayang, a young but already famous professional French translator. The next day, she finds out that Jia Yang is actually her examiner at the prestigious Institute of Advanced Translation where she dreams of getting a job. Although they start their relationship on the wrong foot, Qiao Fei earns Jiayang's praise when she successfully overcomes his tests and the two start to develop feelings for each other. When everything seems to be going smoothly, problems start to arise one after another. Jiayang's mother strongly opposes their relationship and the reappearance of Gao Jiaming, Qiao Fei's ex-boyfriend, causes additional misunderstandings between Qiao Fei and Jiayang.
