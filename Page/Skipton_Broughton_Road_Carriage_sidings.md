SKIPTON BROUGHTON CARRIAGE SIDINGS are located in Skipton, North Yorkshire, England, on the Airedale Line just west Skipton station. The name derives form its proximity to the A6069 Broughton Road that runs parallel to the railway line heading towards Gargrave in Skipton.[1] The sidings are located on the opposite side of the railway to where the former Skipton Engine shed was located. This facility closed in 1967.[2]

Prior to the DMU/EMU sidings being opened, the site functioned as a Carriage & Wagon works for the area. It mostly serviced wagons on the Swinden Quarry to Hull and Leeds Hunslet workings, but quite often serviced wagons that had developed faults on the Airedale and the Settle and Carlisle Lines.[3]


Present

Originally there was a fan of three sidings just west of Skipton Station with a carriage washer before the sidings split off from the connecting line.[4] This was changed to four sidings (with a full Controlled Emission Toilet (CET) discharge line) in 2012 after services had been strengthened on the Airedale Line.[5] Class 322 EMUs were transferred from Scotrail to bolster peak time services in the Aire Valley.[6] This resulted in a £3.6 million improvement in the siding space to allow overnight stabling of 14 units.[7]


Rolling Stock

Stabling is provided for Class 142/Class 144 Pacers, Class 150/Class 153/Class 158 Sprinters and class 321, 322 and 333 EMUs.
