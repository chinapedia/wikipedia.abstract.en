_A PORTRAIT PAINTED BY THE SUN_ is the second studio album by Canadian atmospheric black metal band Finnr's Cane. It was released in 2013 by Prophecy Productions.

Like the band's debut album, _Wanderlust_, _A PORTRAIT PAINTED BY THE SUN_ was recorded by The Bard at Sardonic Moon Studio in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, and the artwork and layout were handled by Benjamin König.[1]

The cyclical nature of the seasons and the powerful sunshine of spring have been cited as thematic influences for the album.[2][3] The digipak release features a two-panel photo of a piece of birch bark with etchings of the album's lyrics.
