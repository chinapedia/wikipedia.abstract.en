Biography

Early life

Annette Hartung Conlon was born in Ohio to Joyce Hartung, a paralegal secretary, and Don M. Hartung,[4] then a Major in the United States Air Force. A military child, Conlon grew up in several different military bases and cities throughout the United States, her one constant was participating in choir.

1992-1994 The Denver Years

Conlon joined her first rock band, the short lived "Love Garage and the Earth Muffins" when one of the background singers left. When Love Garage broke up, Conlon and lead singer Doug Conlon moved on to form Somebody's Sister, a band widely supported by the Denver rock scene, but as not supported by the local media.[5] When their single Barney (based off the purple dinosaur) started to hit college charts, a label out of Dallas contacted the duo. The label folded shortly after Annette, Doug, and drummer Gino Jones relocated to Dallas, Texas.

1995-2006 The Dallas Years

Not long after moving to Dallas, Texas, the group was contacted by a Boston area band claiming they owned the copyright to the name Somebody's Sister. Voting between all four band members (bass player Chris Harris had joined the band) the name Eden Automatic was born, and with it came the group's more alternative rock sound. From the late 90's through early 2000's Eden Automatic toured the states of Texas, through New Mexico, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. Eden Automatic released four CDs. During this time Conlon went from sharing the stage to fronting the stage. She shared more of the songwriting duties and began penning her own songs. In 2002, struggling with vocal polyps from smoking, the band took a three-month break from touring while Annette recovered. Back on the road, and back in the studio, Annette struggled to find the powerhouse voice previously referenced to as Blondie, Portisehead, and Jefferson Airplane[6] and another six weeks of vocal isolation was needed in order to complete vocals for As For Now. The band started to book more acoustic gigs and less full band gigs. Not long after, Doug and Annette Conlon relocated to Culver City, California, and then bassist Greg Terhune moved to Candler, North Carolina.

2007-present California Dreamin'

During her first few years in California, Conlon performed with husband Doug Conlon under the moniker "The Conlons." It wasn't until she became ill with a Retropharyngeal abscess and almost lost her life in 2012, that things would change. After a two year recovery Conlon began writing a solo record based on the emotional recovery of her illness.[7] This record was funded by a successful Kickstarter[8] campaign. At this point Conlon began performing under her own name, Annette Conlon, and performs either solo, accompanied by Doug Conlon, or by a full band. Her vocal chords and health fully restored, Conlon embarked on the Compassionette Tour September 24-October 1, 2016, uniting music, fashion, food, and compassionate living.
