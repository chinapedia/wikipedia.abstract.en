On 29 September 2016 Towell fought Dale Evans at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Glasgow where he suffered head injuries after being TKO'd in the fifth round of the scheduled 12 round fight. Afterwards he was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital where it was discovered he had serious bleeding to the brain which led to his death on 30 September 2016.[1][2] It was reported that Towell had stopped sparring a few weeks before the fatal fight due to suffering with crippling migraines.[3] On 12 October 2016, it was confirmed that Towell's funeral would take place at St Andrew's Cathedral in Dundee on 14 October 2016, two weeks after his death.[4]
