AVERSLEY WOOD is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest south-west of Sawtry in Cambridgeshire.[1][2] It is owned and managed by the Woodland Trust.[3]

This wood is ash and maple on heavy clay soils, with much of it being ancient and having diverse flora and fauna as a result. Another area, which was probably cultivated until around 1350, has medieval ridge and furrow. It has a number of wild service trees, which are uncommon and an indicator of ancient woodland.[4]

There is access from Bullock Road.
