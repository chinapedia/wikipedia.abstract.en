Reception

Nigel Messenger of _Phase9_ called the single: "an excellent, heavy track with a pounding beat saturated with the sexy tones of lead singer KatieJane Garside."[2] _Rock Feedback_ said of the single: "Snarly riffs and the sound of a girl in desperation, panting away like an exhausted farmyard animal, marks "Pretty Like Drugs," the shockingly post-glam stomper new single from Queen Adreena."[3]
