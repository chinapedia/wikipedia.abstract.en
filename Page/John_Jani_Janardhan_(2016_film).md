Production

In early April 2016, the film was announced by Guru Deshpande who was working simultaneously on other two scripts. It was announced that he is gearing up for a third film which was a multi-starrer comedy. Earlier it was reported that the reformed don Muthappa Rai would produce the film under his home banner. Later it was revealed that he would only be presenting the film and not producing. After having roped in the three male lead roles, the makers browsed through many profiles to select the female lead. The search ended with the makers signing in Mumbai based model Kamna Ranawat to make her debut through this film. Although skeptical about Malashri's consent to star in the film for an important character role, the producers were surprised to have got her nod to play the role. Actress Aindrita Ray was roped in to dance for a special song alongside all the three male leads.[4]

The film was officially launched in May 2016 and the shoot was completed by 30 July 2016.[5]


Soundtrack

The film's score and soundtrack was composed by Arjun Janya. The soundtrack album consists of five tracks.[6] Lyrics for the tracks were penned by Chandan Shetty, Guru Deshpande, Alemari Santhu, A. P. Arjun, K. Kalyan and Chethan. A rap number was included in the album titled "Kannada Kaliyale" ("A Aa E Ee"), which the team hoped could encourage youngsters to speak Kannada language.[7] The song, written by Chandan Shetty, features all the three male leads on screen. The distribution rights of the album were given to Jhankar Music.
