_KENYANTHROPUS PLATYOPS_ is a 3.5 to 3.2-million-year-old (Pliocene) hominin fossil discovered in Lake Turkana, Kenya in 1999 by Justus Erus, who was part of Meave Leakey's team.[1]

Leakey (2001) proposes that the fossil represents an entirely new hominin species and genus, while others classify it as a species of _Australopithecus_, _AUSTRALOPITHECUS PLATYOPS_, others as a species of _Homo,_ _HOMO PLATYOPS_, and yet others interpret it as an individual of _Australopithecus afarensis_.

Archaeological discoveries in Lomekwi in 2015, identifying possibly the oldest known evidence of hominin use of tools to date, have indicated that _Kenyanthropus platyops_ may have been the earliest tool-users known.[2]


Etymology and description

The name _Kenyanthropus platyops_ was assigned to this unique species for several reasons: the genus name "_Kenyanthropus_" was proposed to recognize Kenya since so many different hominins have been discovered there, and those findings have played a significant role in understanding human evolution. The species name "_platyops_" is derived from two Greek words: _platus_, which means "flat", and _opsis_, which means "to appear, to look", referring to the appearance of the very flat face of the fossil cranium.

The discovery of these fossils led to the prediction of an early diet-driven adaptive radiation, which is when species diversify to fulfill new ecological niches; this would be attributed to the fact that many new species of _Australopithecus_ and other hominins were being discovered that pre-dated or lived around the same time as _Australopithecus afarensis_. This indicated that species were much more diverse in the distant past than previously thought. Even with the findings of a skull, their diet is still relatively unknown at this time. Also, no evidence of material culture or anything that would lead to its behavioral adaptations or lifestyle has been discovered at this time.

Several aspects of the environment in which it may have lived have been proposed, basing on faunal comparison tests with other animals that lived during their time. It is believed that they lived in a "mosaic" environment, which had both grassland and some forested areas. This is quite different from their close relative, _A. afarensis_, which was found in sites such as Laetoli, Tanzania, and Hadar, Ethiopia, where they are believed to have spent a lot of time among trees.[3][4][5]


Excavation sites

In 1999, Meave Leakey led an expedition in Kenya to search for fossils, the second such expedition in the area. The first expedition was in 1998 in which the paratype, KNM-WT 38350 was discovered.[6] They began to dig at a site that had yielded many other prominent hominin fossil specimens, Lake Turkana. A member of the team, Justus Erus, discovered a skull in the Nachukui Formation at Lomekwi, an area of specific geology right next to the lake. The total number of fossils recovered from both expeditions at the dig sites included a temporal bone, three partial mandibles, two partial maxillae, and forty four teeth, but it was the skull dubbed KNM-WT 40000 that sparked the most scientific interest because of its relative completeness (Leakey 2001). This skull had many characteristics that had been seen before in other specimens, however the combination of features had never been seen before; this led scientists to realize that this was indeed a separate and unique species.

KNM-WT 40000 and the other bones were collected from a dark mudstone, which contained volcanic pebbles and solidified CaCO₃. The mudstone was located in between the Lokochot Tuff and the Tulu Bor Tuff in the Kataboi Member. Beneath the Lokochot Tuff were the Moiti Tuff and the Topernawi Tuff. The KNM-WT 40000 specimen was dated at 3.5 million years, with the bed dated at 3.53 million years. Directly beneath the bed was the KNM-WT 38341 specimen, which was dated at 3.53 million years. Other specimens from various localities that were found above the b-Tulu Bor Tuff were dated at around 3.3 million years. The location of the mudstone was near a shallow lake, suggesting that the hominins lived near rivers or lakes.


Taxonomy

KNM-WT 40000 is the holotype, the specimen of which the description and name of the species is based.[7]

The fossils of _Kenyanthropus platyops_ indicate that hominins were more taxonomically diverse during the middle Pliocene. The discovery of this fossil also dated non forward-projecting jaws further back than previous discoveries. The facial structure of the _Kenyanthropus_ and its derived features were very different from that of the _Paranthropus_, including almost every cranial feature. This gave no reason to assign the new skull in the genus _Paranthropus_, unless it could somehow be linked to be a previous version of the _Paranthropus_. It is still thought that the differences in cranial structure are too different for even that to be a possibility. The _Kenyanthropus_ also shows many differences to _Homo_, as well as _Ardipithecus_, which leaves only the _Australopithecus_. The cranial structure of the _Kenyanthropus_ has a few similarities to the _Australopithecus_, such as brain size, parts of the nasal, the suborbital and the temporal regions, but the differences far outweigh the similarities leading to its new genus.

Having smaller molars at the date they existed, it is possible that the previous sister taxon of all modern hominins, _Preanthropus afarensis_, should be replaced by _Kenyanthropus_. Fragmentary specimens which were having trouble being classified are now being assessed to see if they fit with the _Kenyanthropus_.


Morphology

The _Kenyanthropus platyops_ was examined by Collard and Wood (2001) to have two types of characteristics categorized as craniometric and traditional. Craniometric characters represent size-adjusted linear measurements between standard cranial landmarks. Traditional characters represent those most commonly used in systematic studies of apes and early hominids. These characters can be quantitative and qualitative. _Kenyanthropus platyops_ was singled out by the morphology of the maxilla, characterized by a flat and relatively orthognathic subnasal region, an anteriorly placed zygomatic process and small molars. In other words, the _Kenyanthropus_ had small molars and a flat face which resembled anatomically modern humans. Other features of the _Kenyanthropus_ are thick enamel, steep nasal cavity entrance and moderate mandibular depth.


Evolutionary path

Although it is an extremely difficult task to figure out the evolution of the hominins, knowledge of these hominins has been growing. As indicated in the image of the family tree of the evolution of hominins, _Kenyanthropus platyops_ were previously known to be one of the older hominins until the finding of the fossils in Kenya in the year 1999. _Kenyanthropus platyops_ actually made the evolutionary path of the hominins more confusing, because of the fact that the specific species represented a new type of species and genus. However, after the discovery of the fossil in Kenya, it came to the notion that the _K. platyops_ were one of the earlier species, living in the same time of the _Australopithecus afarensis_. After the finding of the _K. platyops_ skull, the common ancestor has shifted to the _K. platyops_ from the _A. afarensis_.
