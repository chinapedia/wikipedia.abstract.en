BALUARTE ZOO is a zoological park in Vigan, Ilocos Sur Philippines. It is owned by Chavit Singson.


History

The Baluarte Zoo was established by local politician and businessman, Chavit Singson. Singson, who cites his hunting hobby as his motive in setting up Baluarte only considered opening a zoo when his hunting trophy collection grew too big. He thought that a zoo would serve to edify it patrons aside from promoting conservation and protection of endangered species.[1] Described as a interactive wildlife sanctuary, the facility was designed and developed by Singson himself.[2]


Features

Safari Gallery

The Safari Gallery is a trophy room which features the preserved remains of animals Chavit Singson hunted in various parts of the world. Singson intended the gallery for people of Ilocos so they could see exotic animals without going to Manila or outside the country.[3]
