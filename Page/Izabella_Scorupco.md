IZABELLA SCORUPCO (born IZABELA DOROTA SKORUPKO; 4 June 1970) is a Polish-Swedish actress, singer, and model. She is perhaps best known for having played Bond girl Natalya Simonova in the 1995 James Bond film _GoldenEye_.


Life and career

Scorupco was born to Lech, a musician, and Magdalena Skorupko, a doctor, in Białystok, Polish People's Republic, in 1970.[1] When she was one year old, her parents separated, and she remained with her mother. In 1978, they moved to Bredäng in Stockholm, Sweden, where Scorupco learned to speak Swedish, English and French.

In the late 1980s, Scorupco travelled throughout Europe working as a model, and appeared on the cover of _Vogue_. In 1987, she was discovered by director Staffan Hildebrand and starred in the film _Ingen kan älska som vi_ ("Nobody can love like us"). In the early 1990s, she had a brief but successful career as a pop singer, releasing the album _IZA_, which was certified gold in Sweden in 1991. On 25 December 1996, Scorupco married Polish ice hockey player Mariusz Czerkawski. They had one daughter together, Julia (born 15 September 1997).[2] They divorced in 1998.

On 30 January 2003, Scorupco married an American, Jeffrey Raymond; they have a son, Jakob (born 24 July 2003). They divorced in 2015.[3] She now lives in Los Angeles and New York City.[4]

In 2011, Scorupco reprised her singing career, duetting with Swedish musician Peter Jöback in his single _Jag Har Dig Nu_ and featuring in the song's music video. She also starred in Jöback's short extension film _La vie, L'amour, La mort_.[5] Scorupco went on to host the spring 2012 series of _Sweden's Next Top Model_ but did not continue it for a second series.[6]

Scorupco moved into the comedy world in July 2013 when she was named to a lead role in a new Swedish romantic comedy, _Micke & Veronica_, alongside David Hellenius. It premiered on 25 December 2014.[7]
