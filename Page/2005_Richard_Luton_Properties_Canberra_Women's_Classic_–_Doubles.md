Jelena Kostanić and Claudine Schaul were the defending champions, but Kostanic did not compete this year. Schaul was about to team up with Émilie Loit, but had to withdrew because of a left groin strain.

Tathiana Garbin and Tina Križan won the title by defeating Gabriela Navrátilová and Michaela Paštiková 7–5, 1–6, 6–4 in the final. It was the 8th title for Garbin and the 6th title for Križan in their respective doubles careers.
