Production

In March 2016, Manikandan who earlier directed _Kanna Laddu Thinna Aasaiya_ (2013) began working on the script of a new film starring Santhanam in the lead role. Reports suggested that Parvathy Nair would feature in the film, but the actress denied the claims.[1][2] However, during the pre-production stages, the pair were impressed by a script narrated by their common friend Giri and subsequently decided to work on making a screenplay regarding the new script. Manikandan revealed it would be a comedy film, featuring Santhanam as a police officer, and subsequently brought in music composer Ghibran, editor Rama Rao and cinematographer Gobinath to form the lead technical crew. Actress Amyra Dastur, previously seen in K. V. Anand's _Anegan_ (2014), was selected to play the leading female role, while a bevy of supporting actors including Vettaikaran fame Salim Ghouse, Kovai Sarala and Anandaraj were also confirmed to have signed the film.[3] The film was officially launched during October 2016.[4]
