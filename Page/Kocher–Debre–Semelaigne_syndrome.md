The KOCHER–DEBRÉ–SEMELAIGNE SYNDROME is hypothyroidism in infancy or childhood characterised by lower extremity or generalized muscular hypertrophy, myxoedema, short stature and cretinism.[1] The absence of painful spasms and pseudomyotonia differentiates this syndrome from its adult form, which is Hoffmann syndrome.[2]

The syndrome is named after Emil Theodor Kocher, Robert Debré and Georges Semelaigne.

Also known as Debre–Semelaigne syndrome or cretinism-muscular hypertrophy, hypothyroid myopathy, hypothyroidism-large muscle syndrome, hypothyreotic muscular hypertrophy in children, infantile myxoedema-muscular hypertrophy, myopathy-myxoedema syndrome, myxoedema-muscular hypertrophy syndrome, myxoedema-myotonic dystrophy syndrome.

Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome gives infant a Hercules appearance.[3]
