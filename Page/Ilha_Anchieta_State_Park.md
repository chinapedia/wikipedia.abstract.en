The island contains more than of preserved historical buildings, as well as ruins of the prison, barracks and civil village of the correctional colony of Porto das Palmas. The island was used as a prison for common criminals until 1955, when there was a great prisoner rebellion.

The Ilha Anchieta State Park was created by the governor of São Paulo, Paulo Egydio Martins, by decree 9.629 of 29 March 1977. This reversed a prior decree that gave administration of the island to the department of urbanization and improvement of resorts.
