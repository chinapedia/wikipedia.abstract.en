Brahmagiri Hills

The Karnataka side of Pakshipathalam is called Brahmagiri Hills. This area is also accessible from Irupu Falls in Karnataka.


Etymology

_Pakshi_ means bird in Malayalam. _Pathalam_ means the underworld of the demons.


Location

Pakshi Pathalam is located seven kilometer northeast of Thirunelli town. The hill is 32 kilometers away from the district headquarters of Kalpetta. The hill lies 1740 m above sea level.[1] Papanasini River flows from Brahmagiri hill and irrigates the area. This river is believed to have the capacity to wash away all sins as the word 'papa' means _sin_ and 'nashini' means _destroy_ in Malayalam.


Attractions

Pakshi Pathalam is rich in bird diversity. There is a cave here which is believed to be used by saints of olden times.[2] The undulating hills of Pakshipathalam are also famous as a trekking site.[3]
