History

Comcast_Center_West.jpg as seen from the observation deck]] Paris-based Montparnasse 56 Group (M56) announced in 2014 that it would open an observation deck on the 57th floor of One Liberty Place.[2] The One Liberty Observation Deck, also called _Philly from the Top_, opened to the public on November 28, 2015.[3] The observation deck is fully enclosed and offers 360 degree panoramic views of the city from 883 feet above street level, which is the highest public access level and the tallest standing building attraction in Philadelphia as of 2016.[4][5]


Concept

The attraction consists of three levels, the ground floor entry area, a second floor ticketing, lobby and gift shop area, and the 57th floor observation area. After purchasing a ticket, visitors may choose to stand in front of a green screen to have a photograph taken. Visitors then board an elevator where a video with surround sound is presented about the observation deck and the city. Once on the 57th floor, visitors enter an area with tables, seating and vending machines. The observation area completely encircles the building core with windows in all directions. Multiple interactive maps with electronic sight-seeing tours are available throughout the observation deck.
