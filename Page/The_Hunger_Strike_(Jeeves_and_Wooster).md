Plot

Aunt Dahlia coerces Bertie into handing out the prizes at Market Snodsbury Grammar School by threatening to withhold the services of her master chef, Anatole, being the supremely skilled French chef of Aunt Dahlia at her country house Brinkley Court. Bertie tries to sort out Tuppy Glossop and Angela Travers's relationship, Gussie and Madeline's relationship, and an issue Aunt Dahlia has with her husband — all without the help of Jeeves. Bertie recommends that they make a hunger strike in order to provoke feelings of guilt in others and to go without dinner, but this backfires when the others remain completely oblivious and an offended Anatole gives notice.

Newt-fancier Gussie Fink-Nottle comes to Jeeves for advice about Madeline Bassett, with whom he is enamoured. Since she is staying at Brinkley Court with Aunt Dahlia, Bertie delegates Gussie to give the prizes.
