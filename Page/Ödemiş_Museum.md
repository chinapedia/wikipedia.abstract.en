History

The building land was donated by a private collector named Mutahhar Başoğlu in 1976, and the museum was opened in 1983.[1] The items displayed in the museum were previously archived at the Tire and İzmir Archaeology Museums. In addition, Başoğlu donated archaeological and ethnographic material from his personal collection.
