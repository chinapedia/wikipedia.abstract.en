Opinions

Divorce

He believes that saying "talaq" three consecutive times in public does not amount to divorce. He said in an interview: "in the Shariat, uttering 'talaq' thrice at one go does not amount to divorce, and some maulanas are kicking up controversy to keep their domination in the community." He supported the central government's rendition of an opinion against the legality of 'triple talaq' divorce for Muslim women, during the proceedings of the Supreme Court.[17][18]

Involvement in Waqf Movement of Lucknow

The "Waqf Movement", or Tehreek-e-Awqaf, which is going on in Lucknow under the leadership of Kalbe Jawad and Baqai has achieved a nominal success to date.[19][20]

Execution of Nimr al-Nimr & Faris Zarani

Unity between Shia and Sunni

Baqai advocates the unity of Sunnis and Shia.[23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31]
