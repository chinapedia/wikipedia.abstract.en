Reception

Box office

_The Possession of Hannah Grace_ grossed $14.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $28.2 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $43 million, against a production budget of about $7.7 million.[14]

In the United States and Canada, the film was projected to gross $3–7million from 2,065 theaters in its opening weekend.[15] It made $2.6 million on its first day, including $625,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $6.5 million, finishing seventh. Due to it being a "low-budget cash grab in the current slow marketplace," anything over $5.5 million would have been considered a success by Sony.[16] In its second weekend the film dropped 51% to $3.2 million, an above-average hold for an horror film (which typically drop at least 60%).[17]
