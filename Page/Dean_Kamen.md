DEAN L. KAMEN (born April 5, 1951) is an American engineer, inventor, and businessman. He is known for his invention of the Segway, as well as founding FIRST with Woodie Flowers.

Born to a Jewish[1] family in Long Island, New York, he attended Worcester Polytechnic Institute, but dropped out before graduating after five years of private advanced research for the insulin pump _AutoSyringe_.[2][3] He is the son of Jack Kamen, an illustrator for _Mad_, _Weird Science_ and other EC Comics publications.

Inventions

Kamen is best known for inventing the product that eventually became known as the Segway PT, an electric, self-balancing human transporter with a computer-controlled gyroscopic stabilization and control system. The device is balanced on two parallel wheels and is controlled by moving body weight. The machine's development was the object of much speculation and hype after segments of a book quoting Steve Jobs and other notable IT visionaries espousing its society-revolutionizing potential were leaked in December 2001.[4]

Kamen was already a successful and wealthy inventor, after inventing the first drug infusion pump and starting a company, _AutoSyringe_, to market and manufacture the pump.[5] His company DEKA also holds patents for the technology used in a portable dialysis machines, an insulin pump (based on the drug infusion pump technology),[6] and an all-terrain electric wheelchair known as the iBOT, using many of the same gyroscopic balancing technologies that later made their way into the Segway.

Kamen has worked extensively on a project involving Stirling engine designs, attempting to create two machines; one that would generate power, and the Slingshot that would serve as a water purification system.[7] He hopes the project will help improve living standards in developing countries.[8][9] Kamen has a patent issued on his water purifier,[10] and other patents pending. In 2014, the film _SlingShot_ was released, detailing Kamen's quest to use his vapor compression distiller to fix the world's water crisis.[11]

Kamen is also the co-inventor of a compressed air device that would launch a human into the air in order to quickly launch SWAT teams or other emergency workers to the roofs of tall, inaccessible buildings.[12][13]

In 2009 Kamen claimed his company DEKA was now working on solar power inventions.[14]

Kamen and DEKA also developed the DEKA Arm System or "Luke", a prosthetic arm replacement that offers its user much more fine motor control than traditional prosthetic limbs. It was approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2014, and DEKA is looking for partners to mass-produce the prosthesis.[15]

FIRST

In 1989, Kamen founded FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), a program for students to get people interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). One competition started and run by FIRST is the FRC or FIRST Robotics Competition. In 2017, the organization chose to host two international competitions, one in St. Louis, Missouri and another in Houston, Texas, each a week apart. From 2018 to 2020, it will be held in Detroit, Michigan instead of St. Louis, Missouri.

FIRST has many robotics programs for students in grades K-12, including FLL JR. (FIRST Lego League Jr.) for younger elementary school students, FLL (FIRST Lego League) for older elementary school and middle school students, FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) for middle and high school students, and FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) for high school students.[16] In 2017, FIRST held the inaugural event of its first olympics-style competition - FGC (FIRST Global Challenge) - in Washington DC.

Kamen says that FIRST is the invention he is most proud of, and predicts that the 1 million students who have taken part in the contests so far will be responsible for some significant technological advances in years to come.[17]

Awards

During his career Kamen has won numerous awards. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1997 for his biomedical devices and for making engineering more popular among high school students. In 1999 he was awarded the 5th Annual Heinz Award in Technology, the Economy and Employment,[18] and in 2000 received the National Medal of Technology from then President Clinton for inventions that have advanced medical care worldwide. In April 2002, Kamen was awarded the Lemelson-MIT Prize for inventors, for his invention of the Segway and of an infusion pump for diabetics. In 2003 his "Project Slingshot," a cheap portable water purification system, was named a runner-up for "coolest invention of 2003" by _Time_ magazine.[19]

In 2005 he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for his invention of the AutoSyringe. In 2006 Kamen was awarded the "Global Humanitarian Action Award" by the United Nations. In 2007 he received the ASME Medal, the highest award from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers,[20] in 2008 he was the recipient of the IRI Achievement Award from the Industrial Research Institute,[21] and in 2011 Kamen was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Mechanical Engineering of the Franklin Institute.[22]

Kamen received an honorary "Doctor of Engineering" degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute May 17, 1996, a "Doctor of Engineering" degree from Kettering University in 2001, an honorary "Doctor of Science" degree from Clarkson University on May 13, 2001, an honorary "Doctor of Science" degree from the University of Arizona on May 16, 2009, and an honorary doctorate from the Wentworth Institute of Technology when he spoke at the college's centennial celebration in 2004, and other honorary doctorates from North Carolina State University in 2005, Bates College in 2007, the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2008,[23] the Illinois Institute of Technology in 2008 and Plymouth State University in May 2008. In 2015, Kamen received an honorary "Doctor of Engineering and Technology" degree from Yale University.[24]. In 2017, Kamen was honored with an institutional honorary degree from Université de Sherbrooke.[25]

Kamen received the prestigious Stevens Honor Award on November 6, 2009, given by the Stevens Institute of Technology and the Stevens Alumni Association. On November 14, 2013, he received the James C. Morgan Global Humanitarian Award.[26]

Kamen received the 2018 Public Service Award from the National Science Board, honoring his exemplary public service and contributions to the publics understanding of science and engineering.


Personal life

speaking at the 2011 FIRST kickoff at Southern New Hampshire University with Kamen]] His residence is a hexagonal, shed style mansion he dubbed Westwind,[27] located in Bedford, New Hampshire, just outside Manchester. The house has at least four different levels and is very eclectically conceived, with such things as hallways resembling mine shafts, 1960s novelty furniture, a collection of vintage wheelchairs, spiral staircases and at least one secret passage, an observation tower, a fully equipped machine shop, and a huge cast-iron steam engine which once belonged to Henry Ford built into the multi-story center atrium of the house which Kamen is working to convert into a Stirling engine-powered kinetic sculpture. Kamen owns and pilots an Embraer Phenom 300 light jet aircraft[28] and three Enstrom helicopters, including a 280FX, a 480, and a 480B.[29][30][31] He regularly commutes to work via his helicopters and had a hangar built into his house.[32] In 2016 he piloted a B-2 Spirit bomber at Whiteman AFB, marking the opening of the 2016 FRC World Championship in St. Louis.[33]

He is the main subject of _Code Name Ginger: the Story Behind Segway and Dean Kamen's Quest to Invent a New World_, a nonfiction narrative book by journalist Steve Kemper published by Harvard Business School Press in 2003 (released in paperback as _Reinventing the Wheel_).[34]

His company, DEKA, annually creates intricate mechanical presents for him. The company has created a robotic chess player, which is a mechanical arm attached to a chess board, and a vintage-looking computer with antique wood, and a converted typewriter as a keyboard. In addition, DEKA has received funding from DARPA to work on a brain-controlled prosthetic limb called the Luke Arm.[35]

Kamen is a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival's Advisory Board[36] and is also a member of the Xconomists, an ad hoc team of editorial advisors for the tech news and media company, Xconomy.[37]

_Dean of Invention_, a TV show on Planet Green starring Kamen and correspondent Joanne Colan, in which they investigate new technologies, premiered on October 22, 2010.[38]

Kamen was a keynote speaker at the 2015 Congress of Future Science and Technology Leaders.
