MAHAGATHBANDHAN (Grand Alliance) was a coalition of political parties in the Eastern state of Bihar in India, formed before the 2015 legislative elections in Bihar.[1]

The alliance consisting of Janata Dal (United), Rashtriya Janata Dal, and Congress parties won the majority of the seats and formed the government in the state.[2] On 26 July 2017 Nitish Kumar broke the alliance and resigned from Chief Minister post. On 20 December 2018 RLSP joined Mahagathbandhan[3]

On 7 June, Lalu Prasad Yadav announced the RJD was joining in an alliance with the JDU for the election.[4][5] On 13 July, he led a march demanding that the central government release its findings of the Socio Economic Caste Census 2011 (SECC) on caste,[6][7][8] although Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan pitched for a comprehensive classification of caste data of SECC 2011 before its release,[9] and also said Lalu, Nitish will be worst impacted from the caste data even if its released.[10][11] BJP Leader Sushil Kumar Modi called for a rectification of errors in the cases of 1.46 crore people in India, including 1.75 lakh in Bihar, before releasing the caste data.[12]

On 3 August, incumbent Chief Minister Nitish Kumar declared that he would not stand in the election.[13][14] On 11 August, he announced the seat-sharing formula, according to which JD(U) and RJD will contest 100 seats each, while Congress will contest 40 seats in Bihar.[15] NCP pulled out of this alliance later.[16] On 23 September, Nitish Kumar announced the list of 242 candidates for the JDU-RJD-INC alliance.[17][18][19] OBCs were most favoured in the alliance ticket distribution plan.[20][21][22] 10% of tickets were allotted to women candidate by the alliance.[23]

Nitish Kumar was the declared chief ministerial candidate for the _Mahagathbandhan_ (Grand Alliance). Kumar started his _Har Ghar Dastak_ (door-to-door) campaign on 2 July.[24][25][26] Initially there were definite political overtures when both Lalu Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar shared stage together in a public[27] event commemorating former chief minister Satyendra Narain Sinha's birth anniversary that witnessed veiled attacks on each other, the last time[28] they did it in public. Prashant Kishor was a key election strategist for the alliance.[29][30] The Janata Dal-United started 400 audio-visual vans called _Jan Bhagidari Manch_ for the campaign.[31] Kumar is launching 'Bihar Samman Sammelan' in various cities, including Delhi and Mumbai, to connect with the Bihari diaspora.[32]
