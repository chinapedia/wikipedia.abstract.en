Establishment

The camp and gun emplacement was established at the start of the Second World War in Slades Hill, Enfield. A half-battery of 3.7 inch mobile guns had previously been temporarily sited nearby during the Munich Crisis of 1938.[1] The road to the camp from Enfield Road, previously a track, was made into a permanent way and is now known locally as Camp Road.[2] The Merryhills Brook crosses Camp Road and Salmon's Brook runs along the eastern side of the site. To the south of the camp was the 26th Enfield Rifle and Pistol Club, which still exists, and which dates from the Boer War.[3]


Anti-aircraft battery

The anti-aircraft battery was located on adjacent Hog Hill just north of the camp. It featured four QF 4.5-inch Mark II anti-aircraft guns that were adapted from the naval gun of the same gauge[4] and approved for land use in 1938. They were set in concrete emplacements and formed part of the defences of London against attack by German bombers. The report from the guns was said to be so loud that when they were in action the main doors of nearby Chase Farm Hospital were blasted open.[5]

In 1941, Winston Churchill's daughter Mary, who had enlisted in the Auxiliary Territorial Service of the British Army, was posted to the battery before moving to a different one in Hyde Park.[6][7]


Closure

After the war, the camp was converted to an army records centre and closed by the early 1960s.[8]
