RAZIYE HATUN (; died in 1597; alias Ayşe) was a lady-in-waiting to Sultan Murad III of the Ottoman Empire.


Career

Raziye Hatun began her career as a lady-in-waiting to Sultan Murad, when he had been a prince and the governor of Manisa.

She patronized a Şabaniye derviş of Albanian origin by the name of Şeyh Şüca as a skilled interpreter of dreams. He had been associated with the followers of Ümmi Sinan and had been a gardener at the court of Prince Murad. Upon Raziye's suggestion Murad also attached to him as one of his devotees.

When Murad ascended the throne in 1574, he appointed Raziye Hatun in charge of the financial affairs of the imperial harem. She, Canfeda Hatun, Kethüde (mistress housekeeper) of the Harem of Murad III, and the poetess Hubbi Hatun appear to have been very powerful and influential during his reign.


Personal life

She married firstly Bekir Agha. She had two sons, one named Mustafa Pasha, governor of Erzurum Eyalet, and a daughter married to Damad Mehmed Efendi. Her second husband was Yahya, who took advantage of his wife's connection to the court. Yahya was favoured by the Valide sultan Safiye Sultan, and was personally received by Sultan Mehmed III. Yahya was appointed judge of Mecca, and in 1597 chief justice of Asian and African provinces, and the same year chief justice of the European provinces, replacing Damad Mehmed Efendi.


Death

She died in 1597, and was buried in the Arap Mosque.
