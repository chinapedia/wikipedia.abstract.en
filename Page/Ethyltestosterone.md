ETHYLTESTOSTERONE, or 17Α-ETHYLTESTOSTERONE, also known as 17Α-ETHYLANDROST-4-EN-17Β-OL-3-ONE or 17Α-PREGN-4-EN-17-OL-3-ONE, is a synthetic, orally active anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) of the 17α-alkylated group related to methyltestosterone which was never marketed.[1][2] Like methyltestosterone, ethyltestosterone is the parent compound of many AAS.[3] Derivatives of ethyltestosterone include norethandrolone (ethylnandrolone, ethylestrenolone), ethylestrenol (ethylnandrol), norboletone, ethyldienolone, tetrahydrogestrinone, bolenol (ethylnorandrostenol), and propetandrol.[4]

Ethyltestosterone is described as a very weak AAS[5] and is considerably weaker as an AAS than is methyltestosterone.[6] Analogues with longer C17α chains such as propyltestosterone (topterone) have further greatly reduced androgenic activity or even antiandrogenic activity.[7][8] In contrast to ethyltestosterone, its 19-demethyl variant, norethandrolone, is a potent AAS comparable in anabolic activity to testosterone propionate.[9]
