ALGA (ALUMINUM-GALLIUM) is a degenerate alloy that results from liquid gallium infiltrating the crystal structure of aluminium metal. The resulting alloy is very weak and brittle, being broken under the most minute pressure. The alloy is also chemically weaker, as the gallium inhibits the aluminium from forming a protective oxide layer.


Uses

The alloy can be reacted with water to form hydrogen gas, aluminium oxide and gallium metal. This however is not practical for generating hydrogen as electrolysis is a far cheaper and more efficient method.[1]


Safety concerns

Due to AlGa extreme lack of structural integrity and ability to form a protective oxide layer, Gallium metal is considered to be corrosive. If AlGa were to form on an aluminum structure, the aforementioned structure could weaken or collapse. Gallium is illegal to transport on aircraft as it could compromise the integrity of the aluminium hull.
