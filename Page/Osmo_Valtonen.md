OSMO VALTONEN (1929â€“2002) was an artist from Finland. He was a pioneer of kinetic art in Finland. His most popular works were machines which drew shapes in sand.[1]

Valtonen was one of the founders of Dimensio group in 1972, and chair of the group 1976-1979. The group consisted of artists, engineers, composers and scientists. They developed and exhibited "engineering esthetics".[2]

Many of Valtonen's works are based on simple geometric forms. His sand drawers move slowly creating shapes in sand, reminding Japanese rock gardens or the plough marks on farmer's field.[3]

Valtonen received the Swedish Prince Eugen Medal in 1998.[4]
