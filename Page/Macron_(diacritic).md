A MACRON () is a diacritical mark: it is a straight bar placed above a letter, usually a vowel. Its name derives from Ancient Greek (_makrón_) "long", since it was originally used to mark long or heavy syllables in Greco-Roman metrics. It now more often marks a long vowel. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, the macron is used to indicate a mid-tone; the sign for a long vowel is instead a modified triangular colon .

The opposite is the breve , which marks a short or light syllable or a short vowel.


Uses

Syllable weight

In Greco-Roman metrics and in the description of the metrics of other literatures, the macron was introduced and is still widely used to mark a long (heavy) syllable. Even relatively recent classical Greek and Latin dictionaries[1] are still concerned with indicating only the length (weight) of syllables; that is why most still do not indicate the length of vowels in syllables that are otherwise metrically determined. Many textbooks about Ancient Rome and Greece use the macron even if it was not actually used at that time.

Vowel length

The following languages or transliteration systems use the macron to mark long vowels:

-   Slavicists use the macron to indicate a non-tonic long vowel, or a non-tonic syllabic liquid, such as on _l_, _lj_, _m_, _n_, _nj_, and _r_. Languages with this feature include standard and dialect varieties of Serbo-Croatian, Slovene, and Bulgarian.[2]
-   Transcriptions of Arabic typically use macrons to indicate long vowels – (alif when pronounced ), (waw, when pronounced or ), and (ya', when pronounced or ). Thus the Arabic word (three) is transliterated _thalāthah_.
-   In Latin, many of the more recent dictionaries and learning materials use the macron as the modern equivalent of the ancient Roman apex to mark long vowels. Any of the 6 vowel letters _(ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, ӯ)_ can bear it. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the breve, especially to distinguish the short vowels /i/ and /u/ from their semi-vowel counterparts /j/ and /w/, originally, and often to this day, spelt with the same letters. However, the older of these editions are not always explicit on whether they mark long vowels or heavy syllables – a confusion that is even found in some modern learning materials. In addition, most of the newest academic publications use both the macron and the breve sparingly, mainly when vowel length is relevant to the discussion.
-   In romanization of classical Greek, the letters η (_eta_) and ω (_omega_) are transliterated, respectively, as _ē_ and _ō_, representing the long vowels of classical Greek, whereas the short vowels ε (_epsilon_) and ο (_omicron_) are always transliterated as plain _e_ and _o._ The other long vowel phonemes don't have dedicated letters in the Greek alphabet, being indicated by digraphs (transliterated likewise as digraphs) or by the letters α, ι , υ – represented as _ā, ī, ū_. The same three letters are transliterated as plain _a, i, u_ when representing short vowels.
-   The Hepburn romanization system of Japanese, for example, _kōtsū_ (, ) "traffic" as opposed to _kotsu_ (, ) "bone" or "knack".
-   The Syriac language uses macrons to indicate long vowels in its romanized transliteration: _ā_ for /aː/, _ē_ for /eː/, _ū_ for /uː/ and _ō_ for /ɔː/.
-   Baltic languages and Baltic-Finnic languages:
    -   Latvian. _Ā_, _ē_, _ī_, _ū_ are separate letters but are given the same position in collation as _a_, _e_, _i_, _u_ respectively. _Ō_ was also used in Latvian, but it was discarded as of 1946.[3]
    -   Lithuanian. _Ū_ is a separate letter but is given the same position in collation as the unaccented _u_. It marks a long vowel; other long vowels are indicated with an ogonek (which used to indicate nasalization, but it no longer does): _ą_, _ę_, _į_, _ų_ and _o_ being always long in Lithuanian except for some recent loanwords. For the long counterpart of _i_, _y_ is used.
    -   Livonian. _Ā_, _ǟ_, _ē_, _ī_, _ō_, _ȱ_, _ȭ_ and _ū_ are separate letters that sort in alphabetical order immediately after _a_, _ä_, _e_, _i_, _o_, _ȯ_, _õ_ and _u_ respectively.
    -   Samogitian. _Ā_, _ē_, _ī_, _ū_ and _ō_ are separate letters that sort in alphabetical order immediately after _a_, _e_, _i_, _u_ and _o_ respectively.
-   Transcriptions of Nahuatl, the Aztecs' language, spoken in Mexico. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived, they wrote the language in their own alphabet without distinguishing long vowels. Over a century later, in 1645, Horacio Carochi defined macrons to mark long vowels _ā_, _ē_, _ī_ and _ō_, and short vowels with grave (`) accents. This is rare nowadays since many people write Nahuatl without any orthographic sign and with the letters _k_, _s_ and _w_, not present in the original alphabet.
-   Modern transcriptions of Old English.
-   Latin transliteration of Pali and Sanskrit, and in the IAST and ISO 15919 transcriptions of Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages.
-   Polynesian languages:
    -   Cook Islands Māori. In Cook Islands Māori, the macron or _mākarōna_ is not commonly used in writing, but is used in references and teaching materials for those learning the language.[4][5]
    -   Hawaiian. The macron is called _kahakō_, and it indicates vowel length, which changes meaning and the placement of stress.
    -   Māori. In modern written Māori, the macron is used to designate long vowels, with the trema mark sometimes used if the macron is unavailable (e.g. "Mäori").[6] The Māori word for macron is _tohutō._ The term _pōtae_ ("hat") is also used.[7] In the past, writing in Māori either did not distinguish vowel length, or doubled long vowels (e.g. "Maaori"), as some iwi dialects still do.
    -   Niuean. In Niuean, "popular spelling" does not worry too much about vowel quality’ (length), so the macron is primarily used in scholarly study of the language.[8]
    -   Tahitian. The use of the macron is comparatively recent in Tahitian. The _Fare Vānaʻa_ or _Académie Tahitienne_ (Tahitian Academy) recommends using the macron, called the _tārava,_ to represent long vowels in written text, especially for scientific or teaching texts[9][10] and it has widespread acceptance.[11][12][13] (In the past, written Tahitian either did not distinguish vowel length, or used multiple other ways).[14]
    -   Tongan and Samoan. The macron is called the _toloi/fakamamafa_ or _fa'amamafa_, respectively. Its usage is similar to that in Māori, including its substitution by a trema. Its usage is not universal in Samoan, but recent academic publications and advanced study textbooks promote its use.[15]

-   The macron is used in Fijian language dictionaries, in instructional materials for non-Fijian speakers, and in books and papers on Fijian linguistics. It is not typically used in Fijian publications intended for fluent speakers, where context is usually sufficient for a reader to distinguish between heteronyms.
-   Both Cyrillic and Latin transcriptions of Udege.
-   The Latin and Cyrillic alphabet transcriptions of the Tsebari dialect of Tsez.

Tone

The following languages or alphabets use the macron to mark tones:

-   In the International Phonetic Alphabet, a macron over a vowel indicates a mid-level tone.
-   In Pinyin, the official Romanization of Mandarin Chinese, macrons over a, e, i, o, u, ü (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, ǖ) indicate the high level tone of Mandarin Chinese. The alternative to the macron is the number 1 after the syllable (for example, tā = ta1).
-   Similarly in the Yale romanization of Cantonese, macrons over a, e, i, o, u, m, n (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, m̄, n̄) indicate the high level tone of Cantonese. Like Mandarin, the alternative to the macron is the number 1 after the syllable (for example, tā = ta1).
-   In Pe̍h-ōe-jī romanization of Hokkien, macrons over a, e, i, m, n, o, o͘ , u, (ā, ē, ī, m̄, n̄, ō, ō͘ , ū) indicate the mid level tone ("light departing" or 7th tone) of Hokkien.

Omission

Sometimes the macron marks an omitted _n_ or _m_, like the tilde:

-   In Old English texts a macron above a letter indicates the omission of an m or n that would normally follow that letter.
-   In older handwriting such as the German Kurrentschrift, the macron over an a-e-i-o-u or ä-ö-ü stood for an _n_, or over an _m_ or an _n_ meant that the letter was doubled. This continued into print in English in the sixteenth century, and to some extent in German. Over a _u_ at the end of a word, the macron indicated _um_ as a form of scribal abbreviation.

Letter extension

The macron is used in the orthography of a number of vernacular languages of the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, particularly those first transcribed by Anglican missionaries. The macron has no unique value, and is simply used to distinguish between two different phonemes.

Thus, in several languages of the Banks Islands, including Mwotlap,[16] the simple _m_ stands for , but an _m_ with a macron (M̄) is a rounded labial-velar nasal ; while the simple _n_ stands for the common alveolar nasal , an _n_ with macron (N̄) represents the velar nasal ; the vowel Ē stands for a (short) higher by contrast with plain _e_ ; likewise Ō contrasts with plain _o_ .

In Hiw orthography, the consonant _r̄_ stands for the prestopped velar lateral approximant .[17] In Araki, the same symbol _r̄_ encodes the alveolar trill – by contrast with _r_, which encodes the alveolar flap .[18]

In Bislama (orthography before 1995), Lamenu and Lewo, a macron is used on two letters __.[19][20] _m̄_ represents , and _p̄_ represents . The orthography after 1995 (which has no diacritics) has these written as _mw_ and _pw_.

In Kokota, _ḡ_ is used for the velar stop , but _g_ without macron is the voiced velar fricative .[21]

In Marshallese, a macron is used on four letters – __ – whose pronunciations differ from the unmarked __. Marshallese uses a vertical vowel system with three to four vowel phonemes, but traditionally their allophones have been written out, so vowel letters with macron are used for some of these allophones. Though the standard diacritic involved is a macron, there are no other diacritics used _above_ letters, so in practice other diacritics can and have been used in less polished writing or print, yielding nonstandard letters like __, depending on displayability of letters in computer fonts.

-   The letter __ is pronounced , the palatalized allophone of the phoneme .
-   The letter __ represents the velar nasal phoneme and the labialized velar nasal phoneme , depending on context. The standard letter does not exist as a precombined glyph in Unicode, so the nonstandard variant __ is often used in its place.
-   The letter __ is pronounced or , which are the unrounded velarized allophones of the phonemes and respectively.
-   The letter __ is pronounced , the unrounded velarized allophone of the phoneme .

Other uses

-   In classical Malay, a macron _ā_ represents schwa.
-   In older German and in the German Kurrent handwriting, a macron is used on some consonants, especially n and m, as a short form for a double consonant (for example, _n̄_ instead of _nn_).
-   In modernized Hepburn romanization of Japanese, an n with macron represents a syllabic n.
-   In Russian cursive, as well as in some others based on the Cyrillic script (for example, Bulgarian), a lowercase _Т_ looks like a lowercase _m_, and a macron is often used to distinguish it from _Ш_, which looks like a lowercase _w_ (see _Т_). Some writers also underline the letter _ш_ to reduce ambiguity further.

Also, in some instances, a diacritic will be written like a macron, although it represents another diacritic whose standard form is different:

-   In some Finnish, Estonian and Swedish comic books that are hand-lettered, or in handwriting, a macron-style umlaut is used for _ä_ or _ö_ (also _õ_ and _ü_ in Estonian), sometimes known colloquially as a "lazy man's umlaut". This can also be seen in some modern handwritten German.
-   In informal Hungarian handwriting, a macron is often a substitute for either a double acute accent or an umlaut (e.g., _ö_ or _ő_). Because of this ambiguity, using it is often regarded as bad practice.
-   In informal handwriting, the Spanish _ñ_ is sometimes written with a macron-shaped tilde: (_n̄_).

Medicine

In medical prescriptions and other handwritten notes, macrons mean:

-   Ā, _before_, abbreviating Latin _ante_
-   C̄, _with_, abbreviating Latin _cum_
-   P̄, _after_, abbreviating Latin _post_ [22]
-   Q̄, _every_, abbreviating Latin _quisque_ (and its inflected forms)
-   S̄, _without_, abbreviating Latin _sine_
-   X̄, _except_

Mathematics and science

The overline is a typographical symbol similar to the macron, used in a number of ways in mathematics and science, for example in Hermann–Mauguin notation.

Music

In music, the tenuto marking resembles the macron.

The macron is also used in German lute tablature to distinguish repeating alphabetic characters.
