_AVARICE AND LUST_ is a sculpture by French artist Auguste Rodin, conceived between 1885-1887, representing two of the seven capital sins and is part of his sculptural group _The Gates of Hell_,[1] where it can be found in the lower part of the right door.[2] It's possible that the name was inspired by Victor Hugo's poem _After reading Dante_:[3]

The piece is made of several parts: the torso of a falling man, whose extremely long arms encircle a woman who is partially covering her face, while he is reaching for some coins. He represents greed. His body is made up with the torso from _The Falling Man_, with the arms in a different position, a new head and hair.[4] Lust is represented with the female figure offering her body, based on an 1888 drawing by Rodin, titled _Skeleton embracing a woman_.[5]
