_LENOMYRMEX HOELLDOBLERI_ is a species of ant known only from a single specimen found in the stomach of a "devil frog" (_Oophaga sylvatica_) in Ecuador.[1]

Dunn's earth snake (_Geophis dunni_) is another creature which has only been found in the stomach of another animal, in this case the coral snake (_Micrurus nigrocinctus_) in 1932, and several other as-yet-undescribed insects were found alongside _Lenomyrmex hoelldobleri_ in the "devil frog"'s stomach.[2]
