_PETRIELLA SETIFERA_ is a fungus commonly found in soil and feces.[1] The fungus has also been located on wood rot, plant species, and compost.[2][3][4] A significant portion of _P. setifera_ reports are found on sources with no previous association with the fungus. There are no known human cases of fungal infection, but one reported case of a dolphin infection.[5] The fungus may have immunosuppressive characteristics, but it has not been confirmed.[6] Many properties of the fungus are unknown, requiring further research.


History and taxonomy

_Petriella setifera_ was first discovered on horse dung by A. Schmidt in Germany 1912.[7] In this discovery, the fungus was categorized as a species of _Microascus._[8] It was later determined as a wood fungus by L. Shigo in 1957 when it was collected from a wilted oak tree in West Virginia.[9] Since the discovery, the fungus was found in a variety of environments including wood and soil areas.[10] This fungus was renamed under the genus _Petriella_ in 1930 for reasons currently unknown.[11] Further analysis of the fungus concluded there are multiple stages of development, including Schmidt`s discovery of the fungus in teleomorph phase.[12] In 1961 Barron reported on the _Sporotrichum_ and _Graphium_ anamorph stages of the fungus in isolations from soil.[13] A year later, A.L Shigoon reported the fungus in Tokyo and other regions of the globe including the United States. The fungus continues to be found in other regions, classified under _P. setifera._


Morphology and physiology

All species in the genus _Petriella_ have a Graphium state, characterized by dark synnemata and round, single-celled spores in the mucus.[14] Dimorphic pore openings produce condia to form mucoid balls at the synnemata apex, which is similarly found in _Lectographium lundbergii_.[15][16] The spores are sexual, non-motile condiophores.[17] The perithecium in which the sexual spores are borne is pale to dark brown colour, 75-125μm in diameter with scattered hairs along the neck.[18] It is thought that expression of the slime-spored _Graphium_ may be induced by certain environmental conditions.[19]

In the laboratory, asymmetric ascospores were found at room temperature when the fungus was grown on a PDA plate.[20] Clusters of brown-grey chlamydospores have been isolated on the agar.[21] These spores were only found in _P. boulangeri_ previously, but it is believed _P. setifera_ developed chlamydospores to survive in the soil.[22] The asymmetrical ascospore convex and marked germinal pores are unique to _P. setifera._[23] The _Graphium_ stage has been associated with fungal reproduction, while the _Sporotrichum_ state has the largest growth and branching.[24] Hyphae are found to form many condia near the apical end during the _Sporotrichum_ stage.[25] CMCase which is also known as cellulase, can be produced by _P. setifera_ optimally at 55 °C and a pH 6.0.[26] The fungus is stable between pH 5.0-8.0 and at temperatures below 45 °C. In-vitro CMCase production has been linked to increased Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, EDTA and Mn²⁺ levels in the agar and a severe decrease in Fe²⁺, Pb²⁺, Al³⁺, Zn²⁺, Fe³⁺ and Cu²⁺.[27]


Pathology and medical uses

A single case of infection has been reported from a bottlenose dolphin.[28] _Petriella setifera_ has no known infectious properties for humans or other species. _Petriella_ strains have rarely been associated with vertebrate infections.[29] However, all species in the genus have not been fully analyzed for pathology.[30]

The fungus is known to have antifungal properties. Ethyl acetate extracts from the fungus show activity against fungal pathogens of plants including _Magnaporthe grisea_ and _Fusarium oxysporum_. The fungus also showed inhibitory effects on _Staphylococcus aureus_.[31] In-vitro, species of _Petriella_ can produce immunosuppressive metabolites but none of the members of this group are regularly implicated in human disease.[32]


Habitat and ecology

_Petriella setifera_ was originally found on horse feces in 1912, but has since been linked to decayed wood, compost and maize field soil.[33][34] It is most commonly found in soil and feces, but also common in wood or plant debris when in Graphium state.[35][36] The discovery of _P. setifera_ on rock hyrax dung was the first case of the fungus in Kenya.[37] It has not been linked to this species prior. There are multiple reports of _P. setifera_ found in unique environments including a human nail and bathroom jar, but these may be due to cross-contamination.[38] One study found _P. setifera_ in wood litter of chicken houses with a history of fungal infestations.[39] Growth of the fungus was independent of ventilation and amount of light. There may be an association with ammonia, as the fungus was found in chicken fertilized soil but not in mineral fertilized.[40] There was also a case of the fungus found in black pepper and mustard seedling rot.[41] Researchers believe the fungus diverged from the genus _Ceratocystis._[42] The habitat _P. setifera_ thrives in is difficult to isolate due to the environments it has been found in.

The fungus has been recorded in multiple regions across continents. Regions of Canada, coastal Asia, Northern and Central Europe have frequent reports of the fungus.[43] _Petriella setifera_ has also been associated with Sessile oak in North-western Poland causing oak decline, and in Ontario cedar swamp soil.[44] _Phomopsis_ and _Rosellinia acquila_ grew with _P. setifera_ when isolated from oak. _Nothapodytes nimmoniana_ and _Pinus roxburghii_ are also possible plant hosts of the fungus, found in the Western Himalayas.[45] _Salvia miltiorrhiza_ has also been associated with the fungus. _Petriella setifera_ has an endophytic relationship with this species, and possibly other plants.


Use

CMCase produced by _P. setifera_ has a potential use in denim stoning with the ability to cause fabric loss and indigo dye removal.[46]
