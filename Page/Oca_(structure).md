Oca_do_Brasil.jpg oca]] OCA is the name given to the typical Brazilian indigenous housing. The term comes from the Tupi-Guarani language family.

They are large buildings, serving as collective housing for several families,[1] and may reach 40 m in length.[2] They are built through joint effort over one week, with a wooden structure and bamboo and straw cover or palm leaves. They can last 15 years. They have no internal divisions or windows, only a few doors.
