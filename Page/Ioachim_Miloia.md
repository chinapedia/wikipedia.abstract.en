He graduated from high school and the Theological Academy in Caransebeș, Romania. Afterwards he studied at the Faculty of Letters and the National University of Art in Bucharest, from 1919 to 1920.

As a painter, together with Catul Bogdan, he created the mural painting in the Iosefin Orthodox Church in Timișoara.[1] Further examples of his work can be found in churches in Folia, Topolovăţu Mare, Cuptoare-Secu, Bocşa Montană, Jebel, Oraviţa and Anina.

In the late 1920s he was appointed general manager of the Banat Museum and in the '30s he headed the Banat Regional Archives.
