_GOD DON'T NEVER CHANGE: THE SONGS OF BLIND WILLIE JOHNSON_ (Alligator Records) earned Grammy Award nominations for Best Roots Gospel Album and Best American Roots Performance for Blind Boys of Alabama recording of Mother's Children Have a Hard Time.[1] The compilation was produced by Jeffrey Gaskill of Burning Rose Productions. The package features extensive historical liner notes by author Michael Corcoran.


Background

The album was funded via a Kickstarter campaign that featured cigar box guitars made of wood from Willie Johnson's 1920's/30's Marlin, TX home that he shared with wife Willie B Harris. These 10 unique folk instruments are individually numbered and collectively known as the Blind Pilgrim Collection.


Reception

Thom Jurek, in his review for AllMusic, said the album "Reflects the enduring, mercurial influence of the artist, but also the weight the Christian gospel imposes on questions of the human condition as it encounters suffering, joy, mercy, loneliness, death, and resurrection."[2] The Associated Press praised the album saying "Producer Jeffrey Gaskill's able guidance has resulted in 11 stirring renditions which replicated the soul of the songs not just the sounds."
