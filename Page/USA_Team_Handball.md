USA TEAM HANDBALL is the governing body for handball in the United States. USA Team Handball is funded in part by the U.S. Olympic Committee.[1] Previously, the governing body was the United States Team Handball Federation[2], but was revoked of its governing duties by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC).

USA Team Handball is led by an eight-person Board of Directors. The President is Harvey Schiller.[3]

USA Team Handball organizes the participation of U.S. national teams in international competitions, such as the Summer Olympics and the Pan American Games. The United States men's national handball team and the United States women's national handball team have struggled in international competitions against nations where handball is more popular.[4]
