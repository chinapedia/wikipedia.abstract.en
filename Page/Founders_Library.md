The FOUNDERS LIBRARY in Washington, D.C. is the main library at Howard University. The building, named The Founders Library in honor of the 17 men who founded Howard University, serves as the iconic symbol of the University. Designed by architect Albert Irvin Cassell, construction began in 1937 during the presidency of Mordecai Wyatt Johnson. As the second library built for the University, the cornerstone was laid on June 10, 1937, and the building was opened for service on January 3, 1939. Today, the library houses over 1 million volumes, the Channing Pollock Theater Collection, and is the home to the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center.


Location

The Founders Library is located on Howard University's main quad. It was constructed on the location of the University's first main building which housed many university departments and the original library. The campus is located in the Howard/Shaw Neighborhood of Washington, D.C. At the time of the library's construction, the neighborhood was home to numerous black luminaries. Carter G. Woodson, Nannie Helen Burroughs, Georgia Douglas Johnson, Mary McLeod Bethune and Mary Church Terrell, were a few of the residents who during their time, helped create the center of black intellectual life in Washington, D.C.


History

PLANNING PROCESS

Discussions related to building a state of the art library on the campus of Howard University began in 1929. In that year, the U.S. Congress appropriated $1 million for the construction of the library. At the time, the university's library collection was housed in the Carnegie Library also located on the main campus. Opened in 1910, the Carnegie Library allowed for the expansion the library collection and number of which facilitated easier usage of the collection. Prior to this period, the library collection was scattered between the main building and individual libraries in each college. By 1929, the collection had grown to over 85,000 volumes and continued expanding through yearly appropriations of $4,000. The building also housed the Moorland Collection of over 3000 documents related to African and African American history donated in 1914 by Howard Trustee and YMCA executive Jesse E. Moorland. Due to its continued growth, the Carnegie Library was strained by usage at the time. Thus, a new library was commissioned.[1][2]

CONSTRUCTION

Although funds were appropriated for construction in 1929, construction did not begin until 1936. To accommodate its construction, the original main building on the campus was demolished. In addition, the President's house, which sat next to the main building was moved. Upon completion, Founders Library was described as a "palace of books" and was the most comprehensive library at any Historically Black College or University.[3] Founders was dedication in May 1939. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, who was prominent in securing the funding for the library, said this of the importance of libraries:

  We can hardly over-estimate the role of libraries in modern life. They constitute perhaps the most important single agency for the perpetuation of civilization. To the libraries we entrust for safe keeping our accumulated social, artistic and scientific knowledge. It is upon their resources that we largely depend for knowing and understand the past; it is by their help that we may undertake to absorb the knowledge and develop the intellectual habits necessary for effective participation in the democratic way of life; and it is mainly through them that we hope to be able to project our own contributions into and influence the future.[4]

ARCHITECTURE

The Founders Library is a Georgian style, red brick building with a clock tower visible throughout Washington, D.C. The building contained many of the most advanced technological advancements of the day including mechanical elevators and air conditioning. Founders Library cost $1,106,000 in 1939 and was one of the most important academic structures of the 1940s. The library has five reading rooms. The main reading room is 120 feet (37 m) by 32 feet (9.8 m).

A contemporary account by one of the leading architects in Albert Cassell's firm makes clear how the project began:

The importance of the library was also recognized in 2012 by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as it named the library a "national treasure."[5]

The collection was formally presented to Howard in May 1952 during the University's Festival of Fine Arts.

The collection contains the playwright's published works, manuscripts, and personal correspondence with celebrities of his day. It also includes photographs, programs, broadsides, sheet music representing different phases of the theatrical and entertainment world, and extensive original clippings files that provide an historical sketch of the role and place of Black performers on the American stage, in movies, and on television. The collection's strengths are Shakespearean drama and criticism as well as English and American theater of the 19th century.

The _Moorland_–_Spingarn Research Center_ (MSRC) is recognized as one of the world's largest and most comprehensive repositories for the documentation of the history and culture of people of African descent in Africa, the Americas, and other parts of the world. The Moorland-Spingarn Research Center is located within the Founders Library.


Importance

As one of the most comprehensive libraries on a historically black college campus, the Founders Library has been a beacon of intellectual research and study of the African American experience. Housing Howard University's School of Law during the 1930s-1950s, many of the major achievements of that department's faculty were completed in the building. This included much of the work on the famed _Brown v. Board_ of Topeka, Kansas case. The case, which originated with Charles Hamilton Houston, Dean of the Howard University School of Law, was eventually argued by Houston's former student and mentee, Thurgood Marshall, who later became an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court..[6]
