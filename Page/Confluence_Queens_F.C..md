In 2006, after the club gained promotion to the second division for the first time in her history, the state government led by Governor Ibrahim Idris provided funds and took over the administrative control of the team. In 2009, Confluence Queens was promoted to the elite division for the first time in her history. When the pro-league was re-branded to the Nigeria Women Premier League in 2013, Confluence Queens was one of the twelve teams selected to compete in the inaugural season.
