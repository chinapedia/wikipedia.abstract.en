This article is about the DEMOGRAPHICS OF SAINT HELENA, ASCENSION AND TRISTAN DA CUNHA, a British overseas territory in the south Atlantic Ocean.


Nationality

The citizens of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha hold British Overseas Territories citizenship. On 21 May 2002 they were granted access to full British citizenship by the British Overseas Territories Act 2002 and there is a special Saint Helena passport issued to them.


Saint Helena

Saint Helena is the most populous part of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. The language spoken in Saint Helena is English.

The island has a small population of a few thousand inhabitants, mainly descended from Africans, Mixed race African and Europeans, British settlers, East India Company employees and indentured labourers from the South Asian sub-Continent, East Indies, Madagascar and China.[1]

The people of Saint Helena are _Saint Helenians_ (though locally they are known as "Saints"); the demonym being _Saint Helenian_.

A census in February 2016 recorded a population of 4,534 on the island.[2] This compares with a figure of 4,257 recorded in 2008[3] and a figure of 5,157 recorded in 1998. The fall between 1998 and 2008 can be explained mostly by emigration, especially since 2002 when the islanders were granted full British citizenship. The main diasporas are to the United Kingdom, South Africa and more recently to the Falkland Islands, as well as on Ascension Island. The population density, based on the 2016 figure, is 37.3 persons per km², or 95.3 per sq mile.


Districts of Saint Helena

The island of Saint Helena is administratively divided into eight districts,[4] each with a community centre. The districts also serve as statistical subdivisions. The island is a single electoral area, sending twelve representatives to the Legislative Council. District_map_of_Saint_Helena.png

Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha

Ascension Island has no native inhabitants officially. A transient population of approximately 1,000 live on the Island, made up mainly of members of the American and British militaries, supporting civilian contractors who serve on the joint Anglo-American airbase, and members of their families (a few of whom were born on the island).

Tristan da Cunha has a population of about three hundred inhabitants of mainly mixed-British, -African, and -Italian descent.
