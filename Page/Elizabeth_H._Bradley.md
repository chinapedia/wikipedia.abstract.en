International Work

Bradley has led health system strengthening projects in international settings including China, Ethiopia, India, Liberia, Rwanda, South Africa and the United Kingdom and with Vassar is implementing a liberal arts curriculum in collaboration with the University of Global Health Equity and Partners in Health in Rwanda.

Bradley first arrived in Ethiopia in 2006 as part of an international coalition that included the Yale Global Health Leadership Institute (GHLI), the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), Harvard University, and others.[19] Dr. Tedros Adhanom, then the Minister of Health, asked Bradley to advise 90 hospital CEOs and senior managers as part of the Ethiopian Hospital Management Initiative.[20][21] Later, Bradley served as the principal investigator for the Ethiopian Hospital Management Initiative, a program run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to improve the functionality and quality of government hospitals in Ethiopia.[22] She also served as the principal investigator for a project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Developing the Long-Term Capability of Ethiopia’s Health Extension Program Platform.[23] Bradley’s efforts focused on healthcare leadership capacity and management systems to advance Ethiopia’s healthcare reform.[24]

Bradley also assisted in establishing the Rwanda Human Resources for Health Program,[25] which was recognized by the Clinton Global Initiative for its innovativeness. She was also the recipient of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grant that developed a framework of diffusion, dissemination, and widespread take up of health innovations.[26]

In the United Kingdom, Bradley and National Health Service (NHS) partners established an executive leadership training program for mid-career professionals working in health and social care in the NHS. The Yale Health and Social Care Strategic Leadership Program integrates traditional management and leadership training, professional development, and project-based learning to equip executives with the skills needed to be effective contributors to the transformational change required by the NHS.[27]


Brady-Johnson Program in Grand Strategy

Bradley was appointed as the Director of the Brady-Johnson Program in Grand Strategy in January 2016.[28] The Brady-Johnson Program in Grand Strategy prepares students to develop strategic thinking and leadership capacity across multiple sectors.

Publications

-   _“Grand Strategy and Global Health: The Case of Ethiopia”_
-   _“Achieving Large Ends with Limited Means: Grand Strategy in Global Health”_

Grand Strategy in the World

The concept of grand strategy, which is the interdisciplinary study of achieving large ends with limited means, has expanded to include practitioners in the field. The Brady-Johnson Program in Grand Strategy sponsors symposia at Yale University focused on leadership and strategic problem solving.[29]

One such forum, The Leadership Forum for Strategic Impact, aims to increase the knowledge and skills of African women in senior positions within their nations’ governments, and amplify women’s effectiveness and influence by building a leadership network across Africa.[30]
