GUIDES CATHOLIQUES DE BELGIQUE (GCB) is the French speaking Catholic Girl Guiding movement in Belgium, open to all from age five since 1979. In most sections it is girls-only, and it is active mainly in the Walloon region and Brussels.

GCB is a member of the GSB (French: _Guidisme et Scoutisme en Belgique_ / Dutch: _Gidsen- en Scoutsbeweging in België_ / German: _Pfadfinderinnen und Pfadfinder in Belgien_ / English: _Guiding and Scouting in Belgium_), and it is a founding-member (1928) of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGS).[1]

The Albanian Shoqata e Guidave dhe Skoutëve në Shqipëri Girl Guiding association's development is supported by the GCB and the Italian Associazione Guide e Scouts Cattolici Italiani.[2]
