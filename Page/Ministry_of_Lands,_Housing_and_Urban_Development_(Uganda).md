The MINISTRY OF LANDS, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT (MLHUD), is a cabinet-level government ministry of Uganda. It is responsible for "policy direction, national standards and coordination of all matters concerning lands, housing and urban development".[1] The ministry is headed by a cabinet minister, currently Betty Amongi.[2]

Tasks

In February 2010, the government of Uganda, in partnership with Thomson Reuters and with funding from the World Bank, began implementation of the Land information System. The system involves the digitization of Uganda's land registry, beginning with key geographical and administrative areas and then rolling the program out to include the entire country. This has improved the country's rank in the ease of doing business and has shortened turn-around times in processes like obtaining a mortgage, selling and buying land, and performing land surveys.[7]
