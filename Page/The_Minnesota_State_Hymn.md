Lyrics

_MINNESOTA STATE, WE HAIL; HAIL THE PURPLE AND THE GOLD
_ALL ALUMNI, OLD AND NEW, TAKE YOU WITH THEM WHEN THEY GO.
_FROM THE HILLTOP, FROM THE PRAIRIE_
_WHERE THE RIVER BENDS TO LEAD THEM_
_WE ARE WALKING PROUD AND STRONG, MINNESOTA STATE ON AND ON.''
_RACHA MACHA, MSU, NOW AND ALWAYS WE'LL BE TRUE_
_IN THE CLASSROOM, ON THE MALL, BY THE FOUNTAIN, SPRING OR FALL_
_IN THE CITIES, IN THEIR TOWERS, IN THE NATIONS FAR FROM HOME._
_MINNESOTA STATE we hail to you._
_Purple and gold we're ever true.''
