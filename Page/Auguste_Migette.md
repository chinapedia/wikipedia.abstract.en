Auguste_Migette-Auguste_Hussenot_mg_9494.jpg CHARLES JOSEPH AUGUSTE MIGETTE (1802 – 1884) was a French artist. A leader of the Metz School style of painting, he was a painter, stage designer, and art teacher.[1]


Life and career

Migette was born 18 June 1802 in Trier in what was then the Sarre Department of France (now part of Germany),[2] the son of Jean Michel Migette and Antoinette Migette (née Neufforg).[3] After the collapse of the French Empire in 1814 the family retreated to Metz in France. Migette was first employed by the Army as a supply hand, then in 1818 enrolled in art school in Metz. In 1825 he was graduated with distinction and moved to Paris to continue his training, first under Eugene Cicéri, then with Louis Hersent.[4]

Migette died 30 October 30, 1884 in Longeville-lès-Metz.[6]


Works

Migette is, with Charles-Laurent Maréchal, one of the major protagonists of the artistic movement which Charles Baudelaire described as the Metz School. His work is primarily concerned with the landscapes of his home city. On his death he bequeathed his works to the city of Metz, to be cataloged by his friend Adolphe Bellevoye. In 1951 his works were integrated into the collection of the Metz Museum of Fine Arts.
