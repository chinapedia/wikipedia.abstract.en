Reviews

Reviewing the 2015 re-issue of the novel, Peter Craven, in _The Sydney Morning Herald_, noted that the novel "is some kind of psychological thriller and it is not one of the books by which all others are to be judged, but it does have a strange confounding power of its own." He went on: "_The Refuge_ is a monument to both the sophistication and the isolation of Australia during the early 1950s. It is an unwieldy book, self-indulgent in its articulation, by a writer of genius slumming it in a popular mode. It is, in various ways, corrupted by both the pretentiousness of its burbling arabesques of style and opinionation and by the vulgarity of the form with flashiness working to adorn a trashiness that lacks any principle of economy. However, _The Refuge_ is also a stunning enactment of its central idea."[3]

In _Kirkus Reviews_ the reviewer was not overly impressed: "Mackenzie is contrasting the literal and figurative isolation of Australia with the turmoil that had already touched the rest of the world. He seems to have intended to write a thriller saturated in the particularly noir mixture of longing, regret, and obsessiveness. Those elements, along with any tension, are lost in the thickets of more than 400 pages, which feel too much like a philosophical inquiry."[4]
