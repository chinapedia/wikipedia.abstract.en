When the Zamindar makes his last will and testament, he wants Gopi to marry Annapurna. And indeed, after his death, Gopi and Annapurna get married. Soon Annapurna gives birth to a boy, Raja (Narayana Rao), and a few months later gets pregnant again. However, before she gives birth, she finds out that Gopi has been seeing his former girlfriend Krishna (Vijayalalitha), not understanding that he is treating her sick daughter. One night, Krishna calls the house seeking Gopi's help for her daughter. Annapurna, who receives the call and suspects an affair, refuses to relay the message to Gopi. Consequently, Krishna's daughter dies. An intense rift happens between Annapurna and Gopi, and Annapurna leaves the house. Angry about how Annapurna was responsible for Krishna's daughter's death, he does not let her take their son with her. Raja is brought up by his father, while Gauri gives birth to another son, Mohan (Lakshmikanth), and does her best to bring him up.
