180 px NITROLIC ACIDS are organic compounds with the functional group RC(NO₂)=NOH. They are prepared by the reaction of nitroalkanes with base and nitrite sources:[1]

    RCH₂NO₂ + HNO₂ → RC(NO₂)=NOH + H₂O

The conversion was first demonstrated by Victor Meyer using nitroethane.[2] The reaction proceeds via the intermediacy of the nitronate anion.


Occurrence

Most nitrolic acids are laboratory curiosities. One exception is the compound HO₂C(CH₂)₄C(NO₂)=NOH, which is produced by the oxidation of cyclohexanone with nitric acid.[3] This species decomposes to adipic acid and nitrous oxide:

    HO₂C(CH₂)₄C(NO₂)=NOH → HO₂C(CH₂)₄CO₂H + N₂O

This conversion is thought to be the largest anthropogenic route to N₂O, which, on a molecule-to-molecule basis, has 298 times the atmospheric heat-trapping ability of carbon dioxide.[4] Adipic acid is a precursor to many nylon polymers. In the end, nitrous oxide is produced in about one to one mole ratio to the adipic acid.[5]
