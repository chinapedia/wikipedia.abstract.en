_LIVE AT BIRDLAND_ is an album by saxophonist Lee Konitz, with pianist Brad Mehldau, bassist Charlie Haden and drummer Paul Motian.


Background

Three of the four musicians on this album – Konitz, Mehldau, and Haden – had recorded together in 1996 and 1997.[1]


Music and recording

All six tracks are standards.[2] The album was recorded at New York's Birdland club on December 9 and 10, 2009.[3] No set list was used; instead, "Konitz or Mehldau would back his way into a classic of his choosing, and the others would join in".[4]


Critical reception

Reviews of the album were mixed. _The Daily Telegraph_ suggested that "Konitz's solos are masterly in their economy, but one senses the other players lowering their voices in respect."[5] John Fordham was enthusiastic, and described it as a "captivating live set".[6]
