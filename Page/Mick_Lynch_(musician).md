MICK LYNCH (11 October 1959 â€“ 17 December 2015) was an Irish musician, best known for his work in the Irish-English band Stump.[1]

Lynch was the son of Tadhg and Noreen Lynch and was one of five siblings. He was born in Limerick and grew up in Cork.[2]

His band project Stump was popular among the indie scene as well as the British music press in the 80s and beginning of the 90s. The well-known DJ John Peel was a fan of their music. Stump was led by Mick Lynch and influenced by Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart and others. Lynch was especially popular for his excellent lyrics. Stump - with Lynch as one of their main actors - released a mini-album in 1986, titled _Quirk Out_. Two years later, they released their only proper full-length album _A Fierce Pancake_. Following the band's dissolution in 1988, Lynch moved back to Cork and worked as an English and Irish language writer for the city's Dowtcha Puppets theatre.[3]

Lynch died on 17 December 2015 of cancer, aged 56.[4]
