ABRAHAM F. ARVIZU (1928-1988) was a pioneering community activist and youth developer from Phoenix, Arizona, and is credited with being the "driving force" of Sacred Heart Church's Southside Catholic Youth Center (SCYC), the forerunner of the Barrio Youth Project.[1] Barrio Youth Project organized the boycott against the Phoenix Union High School District from October 9 - November 2, 1970, which led to systematic wide changes to end the discrimination of Mexican-Americans within the local school system.[2] These events at the end of the civil rights era catalyzed the creation of Phoenix-based community organizations, such as Chicanos Por La Causa and Valle Del Sol. Arvizu was eventually elected to the board of directors of Chicanos Por La Causa, and many of the youth he developed went on to be political activists, elected officials, and contributing members to society.[3] Abraham F. Arvizu was married to Mariana Ochoa until his death. The couple had four children: Abraham J. Arvizu (living), Michael Arvizu (living), Cynthia "Cindi" Arvizu (deceased), and Linda Arvizu (deceased). Abraham F. Arvizu's grandsons include Abraham "Aj" Arvizu III (1990–Present), Gilbert Arvizu (1992-Present), and Andrew Arvizu (1997–Present).
