SHIH-HSIEN YU is a mathematician at the National University of Singapore (NUS). He is known for his work on hyperbolic conservation laws and kinetic equations.


Biography

Yu attended Taichung first senior high School. He did his undergraduate studies and master courses at National Taiwan University, followed by graduate studies at Stanford University, working under Tai-Ping Liu and obtaining his PhD in 1994. He was subsequently a postdoc fellow at University of Minnesota (1994–1995), faculty member at University of California, Los Angeles (1995–1999), Osaka University (1999–2000), City University of Hong Kong (2000–2007), before moving to the National University of Singapore in 2007.


Contributions

With Tai-Ping Liu, Yu has solved several basic problems in conservation laws and kinetic equations such as the existence of discrete shock wave for Lax-Friedrichs scheme, and the positive-valued function property of the Boltzmann shock profile, pointwise structure of the Green’s functions for linearized Boltzmann equation, and invariant manifolds for stationary Boltzmann flows.
