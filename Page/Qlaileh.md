QLAILEH, Leileh, () is a village in the Tyre District in South Lebanon.


Name

According to E. H. Palmer in 1881, the name _Leileh_ comes from a female proper name; it also means “night”.[1]


History

In 1875 Victor Guérin describes a ruin here, which he calls _Kh. Kleileh_. The upright of oil-presses, a winepress cut in the rock, with two compartments, one round and one square, and three broken sarcophagi, are all that remain here. A short distance south of this place he found another ruined hamlet, having a cistern cut in the rock, and an enormous millstone lying on the ground, called _Kh. Ratieh_.[2]

In 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's _Survey of Western Palestine_ (SWP) described it: "A small well-built stone village, containing about 50 Moslems, surrounded by olives and arable ground. The water supply is from _'Ain Zaheiriyeh._"[3]
