Critical reception

A reviewer in _The Queenslander_ saw the possibilities in this collection: "A perusal of Roderic Quinn's first book of verse, "The Hidden Tide," sets the reader thinking. Is he a poet or only a very subtle versifier? He seems at first to partake of both, but the lines which appear to lay most claim to the title 'poetry' are few and far between. He is illusive and allusive. His imagination always outstrips his verses. Either he cannot keep pace with the thoughts that race through his brain, or, having caught them, he lacks the complete art of putting them into expression. But now and again he gets very near to the perfect interpretation of a mood. And it is that near approach that bears a promise that the day is not far distant when Roderic Quinn will take a place in the front rank of Australian poets."[3]

In _The W.A. Record_ the reviewer was rather more enthusiastic: "Small in size is Mr. Roderic Quinn's "Hidden Tide" but the book contains an abundance of poetry of a very high order and poetry of an artistic class seldom produced in Australia. Amongst Australian poets Mr. Quinn holds a place of his own 'distinct and apart, for although he has strong points of resemblance to Henry Kendall and Mr. Daley, he has still stronger points of contrast. The poems in this booklet are preeminently the work of an artist soul; but the artist never loses the singer and the seer. Picturesque they are, but into the woof of his vivid art, Mr. Quinn has woven the weft of high emotion, an emotion that has been touched into life by the vivifying love of Nature, animate and inanimate."[4]
