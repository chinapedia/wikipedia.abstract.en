-   Samogitian highway - old highway built in 1930s, connecting Kaunas and Klaipėda. As for today, road section between Kaunas and Ariogala is completely refurbished to motorway. From Ariogala to Klaipėda, it serves as alternative road for a parallel-built motorway A1 and connects local towns such as Ariogala, Raseiniai, Rietavas.
-   Aukštaitian Highway - old highway built in the 1930s. It connects Kaunas, Kėdainiai, Panevėžys and Biržai. Currently road is a part of land road 229 (Cinkiškiai interchange-Kėdainiai), Via Baltica (part from Kėdainiai to Pasvalys) and land road 125 (from Pasvalys to Biržai)
