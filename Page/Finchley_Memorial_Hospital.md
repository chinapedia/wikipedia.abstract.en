History

Finchley_Memorial_Hospital_-_geograph.org.uk_-_119298.jpg The hospital was originally established as the Finchley Cottage Hospital and opened with 20 beds in May 1908.[1] An extension financed by public subscription which would form a lasting memorial for the Finchley dead of the First World War was opened by General Sir Ian Hamilton in 1922.[2] The facility was renamed the Finchley Memorial Hospital that year.[3]

A casualty department opened in 1926 and a two-story accommodation block for nurses opened in 1933.[4] A geriatric day facility was opened by Margaret Thatcher, the local MP, in January 1987.[5]

A new three-storey hospital building was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2010.[6] It was built by Galliford Try at a cost of Â£28 million and was opened by the Duke of Gloucester in September 2013.[7]


Facilities

The hospital does not include an accident and emergency department, but it does offer a walk-in centre for minor injuries that do not present an immediate threat to life.[8]
