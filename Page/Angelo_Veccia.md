ANGELO VECCIA (21 March 1963) is an Italian operatic baritone.


Biography

Angelo Veccia began his musical studies in the Academy of St Cecilia in Rome, the city of his birth, with his father, tenor Luigi Veccia who won in 1964 the important Spoleto Competition for young singers.[1] After winning the Battistini Competition in 1983 and in 1984 he had his debut as a bass first in the United States of America in the role of Grenvil in _La traviata_ and then as Colline in a production of _La bohème_ which allowed him to sing in many theaters of central Italy. Thanks to a scholarship he continued his studies in New York in the prestigious Juilliard School in the class of Daniel Ferro. As a bass, he debuted many roles, often in English, like, among others, Figaro in Mozart's _The Marriage of Figaro_, Basilio in Rossini's _The Barber of Seville_, Raimondo in _Lucia di Lammermoor_ and Don Profondo in the American première of _Il viaggio a Reims_.

After the discovery and the development of the vocal range of a baritone, in 1988 he had his debut as Silvio in _Pagliacci_ and Belcore in _L'elisir d'amore_ and in 1990 he performed for the first time the role of Figaro in Rossini's opera, character which he interpreted for a long time in Italy and abroad. As a baritone, Veccia began a career which brought him to sing in many halls and theaters of all the world (Teatro alla Scala, Arena di Verona, Concertgebouw in Amsterdam).[2]

His brother is the conductor Simone Veccia], founder of Piccola Orchestra '900 in Rome.
