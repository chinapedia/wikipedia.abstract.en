Rear Admiral JOHN STORR (18 August 1709 â€“ 10 January 1783),[1] was an officer of the Royal Navy. He served during the Seven Years' War, reaching the rank of Rear admiral of the Red.


Early life

Storr was born on 18 August 1709 at Humbleton, East Riding of Yorkshire,[2] the son of Joseph Storr.[3]


Career

Storr was appointed commander on 3 July 1746,[4] and captain on 1 November 1748.[5][6] He was given command of HMS _Gloucester_ on 1 November 1748, a position he held until 1753. He was later posted on HMS _St George_, a 90-gun second-rate ship, in January 1755, a post which he retained until the following year.

In 1757 he took command of HMS _Revenge_ and kept it until 1760. On board, he took part in the Battle of Cartagena on 28 February 1758 off the Spanish port of Cartagena in the Mediterranean. A British fleet under the command of Admiral Osborn, who blocked the French fleet inside the port of Cartagena, attacked and defeated a French fleet under the orders of Michel-Ange Duquesne de Menneville, who had come to their aid. The interception of the French fleet was intended to limit the reinforcements sent to the aid of Louisbourg in North America, which was then besieged by the British.

He participated in the Battle of Quiberon Bay, 20 November 1759, still on HMS _Revenge_. He was then part of the Red Squadron, the central body of the fleet, under the command of Edward Hawke, admiral of the Blue.

From 1760 to 1762 he commanded HMS _Monmouth_. Storr was appointed rear admiral of the White, 19 March 1779[7] and then rear admiral of the Red, 26 September 1780.[8]
