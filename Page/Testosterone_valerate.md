TESTOSTERONE VALERATE, or TESTOSTERONE PENTANOATE, also known as ANDROST-4-EN-17Β-OL-3-ONE 17Β-VALERATE, is a synthetic, steroidal androgen and an androgen ester – specifically, the C17β valerate ester of testosterone – which is used in veterinary medicine.[1] It is administered via intramuscular injection and acts as a long-lasting prodrug of testosterone.[2] The medication is available as a component of the veterinary drug DEPOSTERONA, which is marketed in Mexico and also contains testosterone acetate and testosterone undecanoate.[3] Testosterone valerate is a short-to-medium duration ester of testosterone, with a terminal half-life of approximately twice that of the short-acting testosterone propionate.[4]
