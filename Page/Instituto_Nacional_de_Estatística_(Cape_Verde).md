History

Until 1975, under Portuguese rule, statistics were done by the Provincial Statistics Bureau (_Repartição Provincial de Estatística_), part of the Instituto Nacional de Estatística of Portugal. When Cape Verde became independent, the _Serviço Nacional de Estatística_ (SNE, Portuguese for the National Statistics Service) was established, part of the Ministry of Economy. Its first president was Edgard Chrysostome Pinto. At the end of 1985, the Directorate-General of Statistics was created. In 1996, the new law of the National Statistics System was approved, and the _Istituto Nacional de Estatística_ (INE) was created under the direction of Francisco Fernandes Tavares.[4]
