Al-Magar was a prehistoric culture of the Neolithic whose epicenter lied in modern-day southwestern Najd in Saudi Arabia. Al-Magar is possibly one of the first cultures in the world where widespread domestication of animals occurred, particularly the horse, during the Neolithic period.[1]

The inhabitants of Al-Magar were also one of the first communities in the world to practice the art of agriculture and animal husbandry before climate changes in the region resulted in desertification and lived in stone houses built with dry masonry.[2] Radiocarbon dating of objects discovered indicate an age of about 9,000 years.[3]

The inhabitants of Al-Magar were thus likewise among some of the first communities in the world to practice the art of agriculture and animal husbandry before climate changes in the region resulted in desertification. The people of Al-Magar lived in stone houses built with dry masonry.[4]

In November 2017 hunting scenes showing images of most likely domesticated dogs, resembling the Canaan dog, wearing leashes were discovered in Shuwaymis, Saudi Arabia. Dated at 8000 years before present, these are the earliest known depictions of dogs in the world.[5]
