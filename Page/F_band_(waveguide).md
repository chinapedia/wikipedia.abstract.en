The waveguide F BAND is the range of radio frequencies from 90 GHz to 140 GHz in the electromagnetic spectrum,[1][2] corresponding to the recommended frequency band of operation of WR8 waveguides. These frequencies are equivalent to wave lengths between 3.33 mm and 2.14 mm. The E band is in the EHF range of the radio spectrum.
