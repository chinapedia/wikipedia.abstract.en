DOSTOYEVSKY'S PUSHKIN SPEECH was a speech delivered by Fyodor Dostoyevsky in honour of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin on at the unveiling of the Pushkin Monument in Moscow.[1] The speech is considered a crowning achievement of his final years and elevated him to the rank of a prophet while cementing his stature further as the greatest contemporary Russian writer.[2]

The Pushkin Speech, which Dostoyevsky gave less than a year before his death, was delivered at the Strastnaya Square after a two-hour religious service at the monastery across the street.[3] The address praised Pushkin as a beloved poet, a prophet, and the embodiment of Russia's national ideals.[4] There are some who note that the speech was not really about Pushkin but about Russia, and also Dostoyevsky himself.[5]
