LANKILL STANDING STONE is a standing stone and National Monument located in County Mayo, Ireland.[1]


Location

Lankill Standing Stone stands in a field west-southwest of Aughagower, south of Knappaghbeg Lough. Toberbrendan, an early monastic site, is immediately to the southwest.[2]


History

The stone possibly dates to the Bronze Age period but was Christianised centuries later with a cross carved on it.[3]

The purpose of standing stones is unclear; they may have served as boundary markers, ritual or ceremonial sites, burial sites or astrological alignments.[4]


Description

The stone is a spike of shale tall. On the west face is a cross with a V-shaped ornament beneath it, and on the east face is a Latin cross in a double circle and four concentric circles; this probably indicates a "pagan" monument that was later appropriated by Christians.[5][6]
