MAN'HA GARREAU-DOMBASLE, born GERMAINE MASSENET (June 11, 1898 – August 4, 1999), was the French-American singer, actress and director Arielle Dombasle's grandmother. She was born in Calais and died in Deauville.[1]

Garreau-Dombasle was a writer, a poet as well as a translator. Among others, she translated her friend Ray Bradbury's _Fahrenheit 451_ into French. He later dedicated his 1972 novel, _The Halloween Tree_, to her: "With love for Madame Man'ha Garreau-Dombasle met twenty-seventh years ago in the graveyard at midnight on the Island of Janitzio at Lake Pátzcuaro, Mexico, and remembered on each anniversary of the Day of the Dead."[2]
