_FOREVER CHANGES_ is the third studio album by the American psychedelic rock band Love.[1] It was released by Elektra Records in November 1967 and would be the final album by the original band, as subsequent albums featured leader Arthur Lee backed by a variety of new players.

_Forever Changes_ failed to achieve commercial success when it was first released in 1967, but it has since become recognized as one of the greatest albums ever made, ranking 40th on _Rolling Stone_ magazine's 2003 list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time,[2] being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008, and being added to the National Recording Registry in 2011.[3] The album was also included in Robert Christgau's "Basic Record Library" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in _Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies_ (1981).[4]


Background

In 1966, Love had released two albums in relatively rapid succession, including their second LP _Da Capo_, which spawned their only Top 40 hit, "7 and 7 Is".[5] However, the group's opportunity for major national success dwindled as a consequence of frontman Arthur Lee's unwillingness to tour, Lee's deteriorating relationship with Love's other songwriter Bryan MacLean, and the overshadowing presence of label-mates The Doors.[6][7] In a 1992 interview, MacLean spoke of him and Lee "competing a bit like Lennon and McCartney to see who would come up with the better song. It was part of our charm. Everybody had different behaviour patterns. Eventually, the others couldn't cut it".[8] Throughout this period the band – reduced to a quintet with the departures of Alban "Snoopy" Pfisterer and Tjay Cantrelli – were known to retreat to Bela Lugosi's mansion in Hollywood, nicknamed "The Castle", where the group became further stagnated by their use of LSD and heroin.[9]

Rather than base his writings on Los Angeles's burgeoning hippie scene, Lee's material for _Forever Changes_ was drawn from his lifestyle and environment.[10] The songs reflected upon grim but blissful themes and Lee's skepticism with the flower power movement.[11] Writer Andrew Hultkrans explained Lee's frame of mind at the time: "Arthur Lee was one member of the '60s counterculture who didn't buy flower-power wholesale, who intuitively understood that letting the sunshine in wouldn't instantly vaporize the world's (or his own) dark stuff".[12] Love's third studio album also brought about a sense of urgency for Lee. With his band in disarray and growing concerns over his own mortality, Lee envisioned _Forever Changes_ as a lament to his memory.[13]

At this juncture, Elektra Records founder Jac Holzman suggested to Love to "advance backwards" by embracing the more subtle approach of folk music. While typically independent in his musical directions, Lee accepted Holzman's proposal, setting the foundational approach to the _Forever Changes_ recording sessions.[14] Having already produced the group's first two albums, Bruce Botnick was enlisted in overseeing the production of the third album along with Lee.[15] Botnick, who had just finished working on Buffalo Springfield's _Buffalo Springfield Again_, invited Neil Young to co-produce the upcoming Love album, but Young, after initially agreeing, excused himself from the project.[16] As Botnick recalled "Neil really had the burning desire to go solo and realize his dream without being involved in another band".[17] According to the liner notes in the compilation album _Love Story_, Young was involved in _Forever Changes_ long enough to arrange the track "The Daily Planet." Young, however, has denied such involvement.[18]

The title of the album came from a story that Lee had heard about a friend-of-a-friend who had broken up with his girlfriend. She exclaimed, "You said you would love me forever!" and he replied, "Well, forever changes." Lee also noted that since the name of the band was Love, the full title was actually _Love Forever Changes_.[19]


Recording

Love started recording _Forever Changes_ in June 1967 at Sunset Sound Recorders. However, beginning with the early recording sessions, the band, except Lee, was plagued by internal conflicts and lack of preparation for Lee's intricate arrangements. Through Holzman's perspective, Botnick was an "album savior", guiding and motivating Lee's bandmates out of their trying period.[20] In order to compel the band to participate, Botnick enlisted top session musicians, the Wrecking Crew's Billy Strange (guitar), Don Randi (piano), Hal Blaine (drums), and Carol Kaye (bass guitar) to work with Lee, completing the sessions.[21] Shocked by the implications of losing their role in the album's development, Botnick's plan succeeded in motivating the Love members in recording the other nine tracks appearing on _Forever Changes_.[22]

Botnick recalls that the use of session musicians "sparked" the band, and they "realized they had blown it, got their act together and recorded the rest of the album." After much rehearsal, the group returned to the studio in August and continued through September, quickly laying down the remaining nine tracks, at a total estimated cost of $2,257.

Lee spent three weeks with David Angel, the arranger of the strings and horns, playing and singing the orchestral parts to him. Lee envisioned the horns and strings from the beginning, and they were not added as an afterthought.[23] A September 25 recording session finished the album, adding the horns and strings, as well as some additional piano from Randi, who played all the keyboard parts on the album as the band now had no keyboard player.


Reception

Upon its release in late 1967, _Forever Changes_ was largely unsuccessful commercially. It spent 10 weeks on the Billboard 200 album chart, according to Joel Whitburn's _Top Pop Albums_, peaking at No. 154 in 1968, by far the worst showing among Love's first three albums. _Forever Changes_ had a much stronger showing in Great Britain, where it reached No. 24 on the UK album chart in 1968. It peaked at No. 63 when it re-entered the chart in 2001.

Initial reviews were positive. Writing for _Rolling Stone_ in 1968, Jim Bickhart regarded _Forever Changes_ as Love's "most sophisticated album yet", applauding the orchestral arrangements and recording quality.[24] In _Esquire_, Robert Christgau said it is an elaboration on Love's original musical style and "a vast improvement" over their previous recordings, because "Lee has stopped trying to imitate Mick Jagger with his soft voice, and the lyrics, while still obscure, now have an interesting surface as well."[25] Pete Johnson of the _Los Angeles Times_ believed the album "can survive endless listening with no diminishing either of power or of freshness", adding that "parts of the album are beautiful; others are disturbingly ugly, reflections of the pop movement towards realism". Gene Youngblood of _LA Free Express_ also praised the album, calling it "melancholy iconoclasm and tasteful romanticism."[26]

Music critics and writers have described _Forever Changes_ as folk rock,[27] psychedelic folk,[28] baroque pop,[29] psychedelic pop[30] and psychedelic rock.[31]

The 1979 edition of _The Rolling Stone Record Guide_ gave the album a rating of five stars (out of five). It also received five stars in the 1983 edition of the guide and in the 1992 guide four.[32]In a special issue of _Mojo_ magazine, _Forever Changes_ was ranked the second greatest psychedelic album of all time. In the January 1996 issue, _Mojo_ readers selected _Forever Changes_ as #11 of the "100 Greatest Albums Ever Made."[33] _Forever Changes_ was praised by a group of members of the British Parliament in 2002 as being one of the greatest albums of all time.[34] _Rolling Stone_ ranked the album 40th in its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in the December 11, 2003 issue. In 2013, _NME_ ranked the album number 37 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Publishers such as AllMusic, Slant Magazine and Sputnikmusic have praised the album as well.[35] In a 2005 survey held by British television's Channel 4, the album was ranked 83rd in the 100 greatest albums of all time.[36] The album was included in the 2005 book _1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die_.[37] According to the _New Musical Express_, The Stone Roses' relationship with their future producer John Leckie was settled when they all agreed that _Forever Changes_ was the "best record ever".[38]


Reissues

_Forever Changes_ was included in its entirety on the 2-CD retrospective Love compilation _Love Story 1966–1972_, released by Rhino Records in 1995. The album was re-released in an expanded single-CD version by Rhino in 2001, featuring alternate mixes, outtakes and the group's 1968 single, "Your Mind and We Belong Together"/"Laughing Stock", the final tracks ever to feature the _Forever Changes_ line-up of Arthur Lee, Johnny Echols, Ken Forssi, Michael Stuart-Ware and Bryan MacLean (Forssi and MacLean both died in 1998).[39][40]
