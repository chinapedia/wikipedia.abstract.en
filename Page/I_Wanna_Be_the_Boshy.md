_I WANNA BE THE BOSHY_ is a free, notoriously difficult 2D platform game created by Danish game developer Jesper "Solgryn" Erlandsen.

The game is a fangame of I Wanna Be the Guy with the title being a reference to it and many other fangames with similar titles.

The creation was inspired by a game streamer known as BoshyTime whom Solgryn enjoyed watching.[1]

It is known for being extremely difficult often including unforeseeable traps, extreme random chance, intentionally poor hitboxes and very hard platforming.

Many elements such as bosses, playable characters and npcs are tributes/parodies of popular video games, such as Super Mario, Kirby and Street Fighter while other elements are references to obscure games such as The Cheetahmen or originally made.

The game received mixed reviews some enjoying the references and difficulty while others criticizing it for unfair gameplay[2]

It has become popular in the speedrunning community, and has been featured at multiple Games Done Quick events.[3][4]
