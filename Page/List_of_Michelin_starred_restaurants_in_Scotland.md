Details of individual restaurants

21212

This restaurant serves a menu focusing on a contemporary French cooking style. The menu doesn't have more than three choices for each individual course.

The menu is changed weekly. 21212 also has a wine list that claims it "suits every palate".[14]

The Michelin guide described the restaurant in their guide as: "Stunningly refurbished Georgian townhouse designed by William Playfair. The glass-fronted kitchen is the focal point of the stylish, high-ceilinged dining room. Cooking is skilful, innovative and features quirky combinations; '21212' reflects the number of dishes per course at lunch - at dinner it's '31313'.[15]

Braidwoods

Cuisine_Trois_étoiles.jpg Braidwoods is run by a husband and wife Keith and Nicola Braidwood. Both are chefs of the restaurant.[16]

The restaurant began 22 years ago, and prides itself on its devotion to the finest ingredients, which are sourced locally, and a respect for the traditions of haute-cuisine.

The Michelin guide described the restaurant in their guide as: "An old crofter's cottage hidden away in the countryside; it's cosy and charming, with just a handful of tables in each of its two rooms. Concise menus offer confident, classical cooking using good quality seasonal ingredients and dishes have clearly defined flavours."[17]

Loch Bay

The restaurant opened in March 2016 and is owned by Chef Michael Smith and his wife Laurence. Billed as a "Contemporary Scottish restaurant with classic French influences on the Isle of Skye", the restaurant was awarded a Michelin star in the 2018 guide.

The Michelin guide wrote: "This pretty little crofter's cottage sits in an idyllic hamlet and is a pleasingly simple place with a wood-burning stove and Harris Tweed covered chairs. The experienced chef skilfully prepares intensely flavoured Scottish dishes with French overtones; opt for the well-judged Loch Bay Seafood tasting menu."[18]

Number One

This restaurant is based in The Balmoral hotel. It has had its Michelin star for 17 years.

The restaurant serves modern Scottish cuisine using seasonal ingredients from an exceptional list of trusted suppliers. Designed by Rocco Forte Hotels’ Director of Design, Olga Polizzi, the rich red lacquered walls in Number One are adorned by art in the form of a large format triptych print of a Scottish oak tree by Adam Ellis and artwork from the Royal College of Art in London. Standout design elements include striking dove grey wool banquettes with golden yellow leather accents, elegant Lyndon Albany chairs with distinctive button backs and solid timber oak flooring throughout the restaurant.

The Michelin guide summaries the restaurant in their guide as: "A stylish, long-standing restaurant with a chic cocktail bar, set in the basement of a grand hotel. Richly upholstered banquettes and red lacquered walls give it a plush, luxurious feel. Cooking is modern and intricate and prime Scottish ingredients are key."[19]

Peat Inn

The restaurant serves French, Portuguese, and Russian cuisine.

It is based in the village of Peat Inn near Cupar and dates back to the 1700s. It has also gained the AA wine list of the year for Scotland in previous years.[20]

The Michelin guide described the restaurant in their guide: "Whitewashed former pub; now a contemporary restaurant run by a charming team. The smart lounge still has its original log fireplace; ask for a table overlooking the floodlit gardens. Accomplished, classical cooking has subtle modern touches and local ingredients are to the fore."[21]

Restaurant Martin Wishart

The restaurant serves French cuisine. It opened in 1999 and continues to bring French cuisine to Edinburgh.

The menu changes regularly to suit the best of seasonal produce.[22]

The Michelin guide described the restaurant in their guide as: "This elegant, modern restaurant is becoming something of an Edinburgh institution. Choose between three 6 course menus - Classic, Seafood and Vegetarian - and a concise à la carte. Top ingredients are used in well-judged, flavourful combinations; dishes are classically based but have elaborate, original touches."[23]

The Cellar

The Cellar serves Scottish food.

The restaurant gets all of its food locally, including beers, gins, whisky, and wines.[24]

The Michelin guide described the restaurant in their guide as: "Previously a smokehouse and a cooperage - now an iconic restaurant with exposed beams, stone walls and a cosy, characterful feel; pleasingly run by a local lad. Delicious, deftly prepared dishes are light, well-balanced and have subtle modern influences."[25]

The Kitchin

The Kitchin serves French cuisine influenced by modern Britain. It selects only the highest quality ingredients from Scotland. The restaurants head chef Tom Kitchin, believes in the philosophy of 'From Nature to Plate'. All butchering and filleting is done in-house.[26]

The Michelin guide described the restaurant in their guide as: "Set in a smart, converted whisky warehouse. 'From nature to plate' is the eponymous chef-owner's motto and the use of natural features like bark wall coverings, alongside the more traditional Harris tweed, reflect his passion for using the freshest and best quality Scottish ingredients. Refined, generously proportioned classic French dishes are packed with vivid flavours."[27]

Restaurant Andrew Fairlie

The restaurant serves French and Scottish cuisine. It is the only two Michelin-starred restaurant in Scotland.

The restaurant is based in the Gleneagles Hotel.[28]

The Michelin guide described the restaurant as: "An elegant restaurant hung with portraits of its famous chef. The à la carte focuses on refined French classics, with home-smoked lobster a signature dish, while the 8 course dégustation menu showcases their top picks 'en miniature'. Much of the produce is from their walled garden. Accomplished, carefully balanced cooking is coupled with professional, good-humored service." [29]
