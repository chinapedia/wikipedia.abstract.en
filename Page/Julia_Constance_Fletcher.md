JULIA CONSTANCE FLETCHER (1853–1938)[1] was an author and playwright who professionally went by the pseudonym of GEORGE FLEMING.

She was born in Brazil in 1853,[2][3] the daughter of James Cooley Fletcher (1823-1901) and granddaughter of the banker Calvin Fletcher. Her mother was Henriette Malan, the daughter of a Swiss clergyman.[4] She went to Abbot Academy, in Andover, Massachusetts, and was in the class of 1867.[5]

After her parents' divorce, Julia went to live with her mother in Venice. Henriette had remarried, her second husband being a painter, Eugene Benson. Julia also spent some time in London.[6] One of the sponsors of her early novels was Alfred Sassoon, a junior member of the wealthy Sassoon family and the father of Siegfried Sassoon. Alfred's infatuation with Julia was the catalyst for his desertion of his wife, Theresa.[7] Julia's other supporters included her grandfather's friend Henry James, and she also knew Rudyard Kipling, Robert Browning and Walter Pater.[8]

Two of her books, _Kismet_ and _Mirage_, were published as "no name novels" by Roberts Brothers in Boston.[9] Both books deal with Americans' adventures while traveling abroad, along the Nile and in Syria, respectively. _Mirage_ has been described by Oscar Wilde scholar S. I. Salamensky, as a _roman-á-clef_ fiction in which "a dangerously appealing, if slightly bi- or asexual, figure based on Wilde romantically pursues" a woman who is thought to represent Fletcher.[10]
