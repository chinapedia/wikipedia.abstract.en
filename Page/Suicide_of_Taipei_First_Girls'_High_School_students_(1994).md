The SUICIDE OF TWO TAIPEI FIRST GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS happened in Yilan County, Taiwan in 1994. The two school girls were called Lin Qinghui and Shi Jiya, Grade 2. They went together to a motel in Su'ao Town, Yilan County and committed suicide by burning charcoal with insufficient ventilation. Their bodies as well as the suicide note were found by the motel staff at noon on 25 July 1994. The staff then called the police. The suicide of the two school girls was one of the biggest social news events of the year in Taiwan. There was no clue found about the motivation of the suicides in the suicide note. Their parents also thought they had no reason to do so. News media once speculated that the tragedy resulted from the complex feelings of being lesbians.


Background

Lin Qinghui (18-year-old, Taipei County, Xinzhuang City) and Shi Jiya (17-year-old, Taipei City) were second-grade students in the Liang (14th) class, which was a gifted class of science in Taipei First Girls' High School. Jiya Shi was the conductor of the school orchestra with a good academic record. The school was going to send her to the International Mathematical Olympiad. Qinghui Lin was a member of the school basketball team and also good at Chemistry. The two girls were good friends and about to be taught individually by professors of Chemistry and Mathematics in National Taiwan University in holiday according to the school.

On 23 July 1994, the two girls left home for Jindu Motel in front of Su'ao Station of Yilan County. At noon on 25 July, the motel staff found their bodies in the bathroom together with the suicide note. When Liao Songyun, the prosecutor and Dong Xirong, the medical examiner of Yilan District Prosecutors Office came to the spot, they found some burned charcoal in the bathroom where the door and window were sealed up. There was no sign of struggle or poison-taking. They died of carbon monoxide poisoning and asphyxia. The prosecutor deduced that the two girls committed suicide together late at night on 23 July.


Suicide note

The suicide note was written by both girls in three paragraphs. The contents are as follows:

  My dear family:

  Be not sad when you read the letter. What we decide to do now has been thought about for a long time. The reason why we choose to leave the world behind is complicated. I hope the following words may give you some hints. It has been so hard to be a human being. The setback or pressure that has defeated us is beyound most people's imagination, and there is even no place for us in this society. We feel it so difficult to deal with daily life. More often, we succumb to depression. Our life is worthless, so is our death. With a peaceful mind, we finish this letter. (Written by Lin Qinghui)

  Please burn all my belongings, including the bill, or send them to others. Candies and _Prophet_ in the classroom were from Xiuwei and Lifen. Please give those back to them. (Written by Shi Jiya)

  Please find in my room all the letters and diaries in the big drawer and the second right drawer of my desk (with the computer on), and in the closed cupboard, and burn them all. Except the basketball, which I wish will still be put in my room, I would love to leave all other stuffs to my brother, and hope he can work hard with a faithful heart. If the soul is truly exist after I die, I would always remember you all and deliver you my best wishes. (Written by Lin Qinghui)
