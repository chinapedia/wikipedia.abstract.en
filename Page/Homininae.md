HOMININAE, also called "AFRICAN HOMINIDS" or "AFRICAN APES", is a subfamily of Hominidae.[1][2] It includes two tribes, with their extant as well as extinct species: 1) the Hominini tribe (with the genus _Homo_ including modern humans and numerous extinct species; the subtribe Australopithecina, comprising at least two extinct genera; and the subtribe Panina, represented only by the genus _Pan_, which includes common chimpanzees and bonobos)―and 2) the Gorillini tribe (gorillas). Alternatively, the genus _Pan_ is sometimes considered to belong to its own third tribe, Panini. Homininae comprises all hominids that arose after orangutans (subfamily Ponginae) split from the line of great apes. The Homininae cladogram has three main branches, which lead to gorillas (through the tribe Gorillini), and to humans and chimpanzees via the tribe Hominini and subtribes Hominina and Panina (see the evolutionary tree below). There are two living species of Panina (chimpanzees and bonobos) and two living species of gorillas, but only one extant human species. Traces of hypothetical _Homo_ species, including _Homo floresiensis_ and _Homo denisova_, have been found with dates as recent as 40,000 years ago. Organisms in this subfamily are described as HOMININE or HOMININES (not to be confused with the terms hominins or hominini).


History of discoveries and classification

Homininae.svg of the superfamily Hominoidea, emphasizing the subfamily Homininae: after an initial separation from the main line (some 18 million years ago) of Hylobatidae (current gibbons), the line of subfamily Ponginae broke away—leading to the current orangutan; and later the Homininae split into the tribe Hominini (with subtribes Hominina and Panina), and the tribe Gorillini.]] Until 1980, the family (and term) Hominidae meant humans only; the non-human great apes were assigned to the family Pongidae.[3] Later discoveries led to revised classifications, with the great apes then united with humans (now in subfamily Homininae) as members of family Hominidae [4] Further discoveries indicated that gorillas and chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than they are to orangutans, leading to their (gorillas and chimpanzees) placement in subfamily Homininae as well.[5]

The subfamily Homininae can be further subdivided into three branches: the tribe Gorillini (gorillas), and the tribe Hominini with subtribes Panina (chimpanzees) and Hominina (humans and their extinct relatives). The Late Miocene fossil _Nakalipithecus nakayamai_, described in 2007, is a basal member of this clade, as is, perhaps, its contemporary _Ouranopithecus_; that is, they are not assignable to any of the three extant branches. Their existence suggests that the Homininae tribes diverged not earlier than about 8 million years ago (see Human evolutionary genetics).

Today, chimpanzees and gorillas live in tropical forests with acid soils that rarely preserve fossils. Although no fossil gorillas have been reported, four chimpanzee teeth about 500,000 years old have been discovered in the East-African rift valley (Kapthurin Formation, Kenya), where many fossils from the human lineage (hominins)[6] have been found.[7] This shows that some chimpanzees lived close to _Homo_ (_H. erectus_ or _H. rhodesiensis_) at the time; the same is likely true for gorillas.

Evolution

The age of the subfamily Homininae (of the Homininae-Ponginae last common ancestor) is estimated at some 14[12] to 12.5 million years (_Sivapithecus_).[13][14] Its separation into Gorillini and Hominini (the "gorilla-human last common ancestor", GHLCA) is estimated to have occurred at about (T_(GHLCA)) during the late Miocene, close to the age of _Nakalipithecus nakayamai_.[15]

There is evidence there was interbreeding of Gorillas and the Pan-Homo ancestors until right up to the Pan-Homo split.[16]

Evolution of bipedalism

Recent studies of _Ardipithecus ramidus_ (4.4 million years old) and _Orrorin tugenensis_ (6 million years old) suggest some degree of bipedalism. _Australopithecus_ and early _Paranthropus_ may have been bipedal. Very early hominins such as _Ardipithecus ramidus_ may have possessed an arboreal type of bipedalism.[17]

Brain size evolution

There has been a gradual increase in brain volume (brain size) as the ancestors of modern humans progressed along the timeline of human evolution, starting from about 600 cm³ in _Homo habilis_ up to 1500 cm³ in _Homo neanderthalensis_. However, modern _Homo sapiens_ have a brain volume slightly smaller (1250 cm³) than Neanderthals, women have a brain slightly smaller than men and the Flores hominids (_Homo floresiensis_), nicknamed hobbits, had a cranial capacity of about 380 cm³ (considered small for a chimpanzee), about a third of the _Homo erectus_ average. It is proposed that they evolved from _H. erectus_ as a case of insular dwarfism. In spite of their smaller brain, there is evidence that _H. floresiensis_ used fire and made stone tools at least as sophisticated as those of their proposed ancestors _H. erectus_.[18] In this case, it seems that for intelligence, the structure of the brain is more important than its size.[19]

Evolution of family structure and sexuality

Sexuality is related to family structure and partly shapes it. The involvement of fathers in education is quite unique to humans, at least when compared to other Homininae. Concealed ovulation and menopause in women both also occur in a few other primates however, but are uncommon in other species. Testis and penis size seems to be related to family structure: monogamy or promiscuity, or harem, in humans, chimpanzees or gorillas, respectively.[20][21] The levels of sexual dimorphism are generally seen as a marker of sexual selection. Studies have suggested that the earliest hominins were dimorphic and that this lessened over the course of the evolution of the genus _Homo_, correlating with humans becoming more monogamous, whereas gorillas, who live in harems, show a large degree of sexual dimorphism. Concealed (or "hidden") ovulation means that the phase of fertility is not detectable in women, whereas chimpanzees advertise ovulation via an obvious swelling of the genitals. Women can be partly aware of their ovulation along the menstrual phases, but men are essentially unable to detect ovulation in women. Most primates have semi-concealed ovulation, thus one can think that the common ancestor had semi-concealed ovulation, that was inherited by gorillas, and that later evolved in concealed ovulation in humans and advertised ovulation in chimpanzees. Menopause also occurs in rhesus monkeys, and possibly in chimpanzees, but does not in gorillas and is quite uncommon in other primates (and other mammal groups).[22]
