WORKING HOURS IN SOUTH KOREA define the length of time workers are allowed to be on the job in South Korea.

In the 1960s, South Korea began to transform from an agricultural economy to an industrial, service and high-tech economy.[1] The country's per capita GDP increased from US $100 in 1963 to US $35,300 in 2014, making South Korea the world's 20th largest economy.[2] In the process, work hours increased. According to OECD figures, work hours in South Korea were 2,124 per worker in 2014.[3] Korea ranks 3rd worldwide, compared to 1,789 hours in the US, 1,677 hours in the UK, and 1,366 hours in Germany (the shortest).[4]

Koreans work such long hours because of the Korean industrial system and nighttime culture. South Korea's corporate culture resembles that of Japanâ€“hierarchical and with significant subcontracting.[5] Even though Korea has a statutory working week of 40 hours and allows 12 hours of paid overtime on weekdays and 16 hours on weekends, manufacturing industries such as the automobile industry operate non-stop.[6] In addition, cafes, transportation, pubs, restaurants, private study rooms, shopping malls, and fast food restaurants also operate continuously.[7] Although the Labor Standard Act sets statutory limits, enforcement is weak and employers routinely violate the Act.


Different working hours in terms of jobs and productivity

As of 2014, 80.7% of the Labor Standard Act had been implemented.[8] The 40 hour working week met with 93% success in the manufacturing industry as compared with 73.1% elsewhere.[9] Implementation in the public sector (99%) is higher than in the private sector (80.5%).[10]

Male workers in manufacturing industry are allowed 24.10 overtime work hours while non-manufacturing workers get 10.90 hours.[11] Public sector can work 11.06 hours overtime, while private sector workers are allowed 16.06 hours.[12] Even though Korea has implemented the 40 hour work week, workers in South Korea appear satisfied with their job and lives. A higher salary has a positive and significant impact on worker' job and life satisfaction.[13] They tend to be satisfied with longer hours. However, longer work hours do not necessarily mean greater productivity. Employers use overtime because the costs are much less (9,045 won/hr or $8) than e.g., in France, where businesses are heavily taxed.[14]
