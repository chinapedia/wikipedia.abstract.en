MUMMIES are commonly featured in horror genres as undead creatures wrapped in bandages.


History

The mummy genre has its origins in the nineteenth century when Egypt was being colonized by Victorian Britain. The first living mummies in fiction were mostly female, and they were presented in a romantic and sexual light, often as love interests for the protagonist; this metaphorically represented the sexualized Orientalism and the colonial romanticization of the East. Notable examples of this trend include _The Jewel of Seven Stars_ by Bram Stoker, _Smith and the Pharaohs_ by H. Rider Haggard, _My New Year's Eve Among the Mummies_ by Grant Allen, _The Unseen Man's Story_ by Julian Hawthorne, and _Iras: A Mystery_ by H. D. Everett; the latter actually has the protagonist marry a mummy which takes on the form of a beautiful woman.[1][2]

Starting from the 1930s, the "romantic mummy" was supplanted by the "monster mummy", pioneered by Boris Karloff in the 1932 movie _The Mummy_; mummies thus joined the pantheon of nineteenth century gothic monsters, alongside Dracula and Frankenstein.[3]

However, the end of the twentieth century saw the revival of interest in the "romantic mummy" archetype, starting with the 1989 novel _The Mummy, or Ramses the Damned_ by Anne Rice, which involved a sexual relationship between a benevolent male mummy and a female archeologist.[4] The trend intensified throughout the late 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s: modern works of fiction featuring romanticized living mummies include the 1997 horror fiction novella _Don't Tell Mummy_ by Tom B. Stone,[5], the 2006 fantasy novel _Freaks: Alive on the Inside_ by Annette Curtis Klause, and the 2011 video game _The Next Big Thing_ by Pendulo Studios.[6]

Film

During the 20th century, horror films and other mass media popularized the notion of a curse associated with mummies (_see Curse of the pharaohs_). The 1922 discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb by archaeologist Howard Carter brought mummies into the mainstream.

-   One of the earliest appearances was _The Jewel of Seven Stars_, a horror novel by Bram Stoker first published in 1903 that concerned an archaeologist's plot to revive an ancient Egyptian mummy. This book later served as the basis for the 1971 film _Blood from the Mummy's Tomb_.
-   Films representing such a belief include the 1932 movie _The Mummy_ starring Boris Karloff as Imhotep; four subsequent 1940s' Universal Studios mummy films which featured a mummy named Kharis, and a 1959 Hammer remake of _The Mummy's Hand_ and _The Mummy's Tomb_ which also featured Kharis. The belief in cursed mummies probably stems in part from the supposed curse on the tomb of Tutankhamun.
-   In 1979, the American Broadcasting Company aired a TV holiday show, _The Halloween That Almost Wasn't_, in which a mummy from Egypt (Robert Fitch) arrived at Count Dracula's castle without speaking.
-   Slapstick comedy trio The Three Stooges humorously exploited the discovery in the short film _We Want Our Mummy_, in which they explored the tomb of the midget King Rutentuten (and his Queen, Hotsy Totsy). A decade later, they played crooked used chariot salesmen in _Mummy's Dummies_, in which they ultimately assisted a different King Rootentootin (Vernon Dent) with a toothache.

The first two movies featured the mummy of Imhotep (portrayed by Arnold Vosloo) and the third movie featured the mummy of Emperor Han (portrayed by Jet Li).
-   The _Night at the Museum_ franchise centers around the tablet of Ahkmenrah (portrayed by Rami Malek), intended to keep his family together forever, by granting life to his mummy. Later, his parents are also seen in _Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb_ with the tablet providing similar effects. Unlike in most portrayals of mummies, the magic is so thorough that the mummies are restored to full lifelike appearance as opposed to simple reanimation.
