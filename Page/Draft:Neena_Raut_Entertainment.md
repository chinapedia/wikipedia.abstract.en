Lokmanya: Ek Yug Purush

Lokmanya: Ek Yug Purush, Om's dream project, was his directorial debut & also Neena Raut Films' first feature length production. The film was equally praised by audience as well as critics.[8] The Times of India gave 4 stars to the film adding "Very rarely does a Marathi film get a standing ovation from the audience and Lokmanya: Ek Yug Purush is one of them".

  It was my dream to make a film on Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak and therefore, I spent three years into research and planning, though it has taken only seven months to shoot the entire film. My entire team has worked very hard and I am sure, the film will make a great overall success!

Om Raut said in an interview with Zee Talkies.[9]
