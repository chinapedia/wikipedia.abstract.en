SAVE THE DUNES CONSERVATION FUND, originally known as Save the Dunes Council, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization out of Northwest Indiana. Save the Dunes' mission is to preserve, protect and restore the Indiana dunes and all natural resources in Northwest Indianaâ€™s Lake Michigan Watershed for an enhanced quality of life.[1]


History

Save the Dunes council was established in June 1952 by Dorothy Richardson Buell when 21 women met at her home to create what would become the campaign to establish the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Their credo became, "We are prepared to spend the rest of our lives, if necessary, to save the Dunes.".[2] Indiana Representative, Charles A. Halleck aggressively challenged Save the Dunes Council and their ally, Illinois Senator, Paul Douglas. Halleck carried an unwavering support for creating a port on the Lakeshore. The port would removed the large central dunes of the Indiana Dunes. The battle between Douglas and Halleck ended with a compromise with the Port of Indiana being created and the authorization of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.[3][4]

As a result of the more than century long advocacy effort, on February 15, 2019, the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore became the Indiana Dunes National Park. It is the first national park in Indiana, and the 61st national park in the country.[5]


Today

In partnership with Hitchcock Design Group, Save the Dunes published a homeowner's guide to landscaping in the Dunes called _Living in the Dunes_ to help landowners protect their part of the landscape_._ The guide won a 2018 Honor Award from the American Society for Landscape Architects.[6]
