Early life

Harry Connick Jr. was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana.[6] His mother, Anita Frances Livingston (née Levy)[7] was a lawyer and judge in New Orleans and, later, a Louisiana Supreme Court justice. His father, Joseph Harry Fowler Connick Sr., was the district attorney of Orleans Parish from 1973 to 2003.[8][9] His parents also owned a record store. Connick's father is a Catholic of Irish, English, and German ancestry.[10][11] Connick's mother, who died from ovarian cancer, was Jewish (her parents had emigrated from Minsk and Vienna).[12][13][14] Connick and his sister, Suzanna, were raised in the Lakeview neighborhood of New Orleans.[15]

Connick's musical talents came to the fore when he started learning keyboards at age three, playing publicly at age five, and recording with a local jazz band at ten.[16] When he was nine years old, Connick performed the Piano Concerto No. 3 Opus 37 of Beethoven with the New Orleans Symphony Orchestra (now the Louisiana Philharmonic). Later he played a duet with Eubie Blake at the Royal Orleans Esplanade Lounge in New Orleans. The song was "I'm Just Wild About Harry". This was recorded for a Japanese documentary called _Jazz Around the World_.[17][18] The clip was also shown in a Bravo special, called _Worlds of Harry Connick, Junior._ in 1999. His musical talents were developed at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts and under the tutelage of Ellis Marsalis Jr. and James Booker.[19][20]

Connick attended Jesuit High School, Isidore Newman School, Lakeview School, and the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, all in New Orleans. Following an unsuccessful attempt to study jazz academically, and having given recitals in the classical and jazz piano programs at Loyola University, Connick moved to the 92nd Street YMHA in New York City to study at Hunter College and the Manhattan School of Music. There he met Columbia Records executive, Dr. George Butler, who persuaded him to sign with Columbia. His first record, _Harry Connick Jr._, was a mainly instrumental album of standards. He soon acquired a reputation in jazz because of extended stays at high-profile New York venues. His next album, _20_, featured his vocals and added to this reputation.


Career

_When Harry Met Sally..._, chart and movie success

With Connick's reputation growing, director Rob Reiner asked him to provide a soundtrack for his romantic comedy, _When Harry Met Sally..._ (1989), starring Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal. The soundtrack consisted of several standards, including "It Had to Be You", "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off" and "Don't Get Around Much Anymore", and achieved double-platinum status in the United States. He won his first Grammy Award for Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance for his work on the soundtrack.

Connick made his screen debut in _Memphis Belle_ (1990), a fictional story about a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber crew in World War II. In that year he began a two-year world tour. In addition, he released two albums in July 1990: the instrumental jazz trio album _Lofty's Roach Souffle_ and a big-band album of mostly original songs titled _We Are in Love_, which also went double platinum. _We Are in Love_ earned him his second consecutive Grammy for Best Jazz Male Vocal.

"Promise Me You'll Remember", his contribution to the _Godfather III_ soundtrack, was nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award in 1991. In a year of recognition, he was also nominated for an Emmy Award for Best Performance in a Variety Special for his PBS special _Swingin' Out Live_, which was also released as a video. In October 1991, he released his third consecutive multi-platinum album, _Blue Light, Red Light_, on which he wrote and arranged the songs. Also in October 1991, he starred in _Little Man Tate_, directed by Jodie Foster, playing the friend of a child prodigy who goes to college.

In November 1992, Connick released _25_, a solo piano collection of standards that again went platinum. He also re-released the album _Eleven_. Connick contributed "A Wink and a Smile" to the _Sleepless in Seattle_ soundtrack, released in 1993. His multi-platinum album of holiday songs, _When My Heart Finds Christmas_, was the best-selling Christmas album in 1993.

Mid–1990s: funk

In 1994, Connick decided to branch out. He released _She_, an album of New Orleans funk that also went platinum. In addition, he released a song called "(I Could Only) Whisper Your Name" for the soundtrack of _The Mask_, starring Jim Carrey, which is his most successful single in the United States to date.[21]

Connick took his funk music on a tour of the United Kingdom in 1994, an effort that did not please some of his fans, who were expecting a jazz crooner. Connick also went on a tour of the People's Republic of China in 1995, playing at the Shanghai Center Theatre. The performance was televised live in China for what became known as the Shanghai Gumbo special. In his third film _Copycat_, Connick played a serial killer who terrorizes a psychiatrist (played by Sigourney Weaver). Released in 1995, _Copycat_ also starred Holly Hunter and Sigourney Weaver. The following year, he released his second funk album, _Star Turtle_, which did not sell as well as previous albums, although it did reach No. 38 on the charts. However, he appeared in the most successful movie of 1996,[22] _Independence Day_, with Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum.

Late 1990s: Jazz and _Hope Floats_

For his 1997 release _To See You_, Connick recorded original love songs, touring the United States and Europe with a full symphony orchestra backing him and his piano in each city. As part of his tour, he played at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway, with his final concert of that tour in Paris being recorded for a Valentine's Day special on PBS in 1998. He also continued his film career, starring in _Excess Baggage_ (1997) opposite Alicia Silverstone and Benicio del Toro.

In May 1998, he had his first leading role in director Forest Whitaker's _Hope Floats_, with Sandra Bullock as his female lead. He released _Come By Me_, his first album of big band music in eight years in 1999, and embarked on a world tour visiting the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia. In addition, he provided the voice of Dean McCoppin in the animated film _The Iron Giant_.

2000–02: Broadway debut, musicals, _Will & Grace_

Connick wrote the score for Susan Stroman's Broadway musical _Thou Shalt Not_, based on Émile Zola's novel _Thérèse Raquin_, in 2000; it premiered in 2001. His music and lyrics earned a Tony Award nomination. He was also the narrator of the film _My Dog Skip_, released in that year.

In March 2001, Connick starred in a television production of _South Pacific_ with Glenn Close, televised on the ABC network. He also starred in his twelfth movie, _Mickey_, featuring a screenplay by John Grisham that same year. In October 2001, he again released two albums: _Songs I Heard_, featuring big band re-workings of children's show themes, and _30_, featuring Connick on piano with guest appearances by several other musical artists. _Songs I Heard_ won Connick another Grammy for Best Traditional Pop Album and he toured performing songs from the album, holding matinees at which each parent had to be accompanied by a child.

In 2002, he received a for a "system and method for coordinating music display among players in an orchestra."[23] Connick appeared as Grace Adler's boyfriend (and later husband) Leo Markus on the NBC sitcom _Will & Grace_ from 2002 to 2006.

A collection of 1950s and 1960s ballads, _Only You_, went top ten on both sides of the Atlantic and was certified gold in the United States in March 2004. The _Only You_ tour with big band went on in America, Australia and a short trip to Asia. _Harry for the Holidays_ was certified platinum in November 2004. A music DVD _Harry Connick Jr."Only You" in Concert_ was released in March 2004, after it had first aired as a _Great Performances_ special on PBS. The special won him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Direction. The DVD received a Gold & Platinum Music VideoLong Form awards from the RIAA in November 2005.

An animated holiday special, _The Happy Elf_, aired on NBC in December 2005, with Connick as the composer, the narrator, and one of the executive producers. Shortly after, it was released on DVD.
