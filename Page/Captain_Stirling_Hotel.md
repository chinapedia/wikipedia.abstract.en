The CAPTAIN STIRLING HOTEL is a heritage-listed building located at 80 Stirling Highway, Nedlands, Western Australia. The building was designed by Marshall Clifton in 1935,[1] and is an Inter-War Mediterranean/Spanish Mission style two-storey hotel.[2]


History

The Captain Stirling Hotel, is situated on Stirling Highway between Stanley Street and Florence Road. It was constructed between April and December 1935 for Edward Bartram "Bertie" Johnston. The newspapers at the time reported that the hotel was constructed for N. B. Robinson,[3] however Robinson was actually Johnston’s solicitor (from the legal firm Abbott, Abbott, Andrews & Robinson) who made the license application on Johnston's behalf,[4] whilst he was out of the state.[5] It was designed by the architectural partnership of George Herbert Parry and Marshall Clifton.[6] The Captain Stirling Hotel was the first of three Inter-War Spanish Mission style hotels designed by Parry & Clifton, the second being the Inglewood Hotel (1935)[7] and the third was the Big Bell Hotel near Cue (1936).[8] The hotel was constructed by E. A. Allwood for a cost of £10,000.[9][10] Allwood was also responsible for constructing the Inglewood Hotel, the Capitol Theatre, New Oxford Theatre and the Plaza Theatre.[11]

During the 1950s, the eastern end of the building was extended with an office, associated entrance area, manager’s quarters and a staircase.[12] In 1958 the owners opened the state’s first drive-through bottle shop with vehicular access from Stirling Highway.[13] It was designed with a modern butterfly roof by Bill Evans, from Marshall Clifton's architectural practice.[14]

In 1986 Marie Wordsworth, the daughter of Bertie Johnston, commissioned architects, Overman & Ziudeveld, to undertake extensive remodelling of the building, which included landscaping works and the expansion of the ground floor space to make it larger and more viable for functions.[15]
