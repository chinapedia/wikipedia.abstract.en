_VIDEO SINGLES COLLECTION_ is a 2016 three-DVD music video compilation by Depeche Mode, containing all the videos released for singles by the band between 1981 and 2013.[1]

Video Singles Collection is the first official Depeche Mode archival title to be released under the Sony imprimatur since SME acquired rights to the DM catalog in July 2015.[2] The videos have been restored for this collection, and some of the videos have audio commentaries from the remaining members of Depeche Mode[3] (Dave Gahan, Martin Gore, Andrew Fletcher).

Most videos on the DVDs are in 4:3 aspect ratio (including ten videos recorded in 16:9, which are letterboxed), but a few later videos are in anamorphic 16:9.[4]
