The DREHMANN SIGN describes a clinical test of examining orthopedic patients and is widely used in the functional check of the hip joint. It was first described by Gustav Drehmann (Breslau, 1869â€“1932).[1]

The Drehmann sign is positive if an unavoidable passive external rotation of the hip occurs when performing a hip flexion. In addition, an internal rotation of the respective hip joint is either not possible or accompanied by pain when forcefully induced.[2]

The positive Drehmann sign is a typical clinical feature in slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), the impingement syndrome of the acetabulum-hip, or in osteoarthritis of the hip joint.[3]
