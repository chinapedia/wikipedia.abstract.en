Professional career

Pierce was not invited to the NFL combine. At his Pro Day, he ran 10 meter split faster than any DL at the combine (1.67 vs Alex McCalister's 1.68) and performed a broad jump inside the Top 15 for DL.[1][2]

On May 3, 2016, Pierce signed with the Baltimore Ravens as an undrafted free agent.[3] As a rookie in the 2016 season, Pierce appeared in all 16 games and finished the season with 35 tackles, two sacks, and one pass defended.

On September 10, in the 2017 season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals, Pierce recovered a Terrell Suggs-forced fumble, which came off of quarterback Andy Dalton, in the 20â€“0 victory.[4]

On March 9, 2019, the Ravens placed a second-round restricted free agent tender on Pierce.[5] On May 1, 2019, the Ravens re-signed Pierce.[6]

On June 11, 2019, Yahoo Sports reported that he was pulled from a mini-camp for not showing up at offseason practices and being out of shape. [7]
