MAOL SEACHLAINN Ó DOMHNAILL (died 1247) was King of Tír Chonaill and a member of the Uí Domhnaill. He was a son of Domhnall Mór Ó Domhnaill, King of Tír Chonaill (died 1241),[1] a man who was married to Lasairfhíona, daughter of Cathal Crobhdhearg Ó Conchobhair, King of Connacht. Maol Seachlainn had two brothers: Gofraidh (died 1257) and Domhnall Óg (died 1281).[2]


Reign

In 1245, Maol Seachlainn ravaged North Connacht. The following year, Maurice fitz Gerald invaded Tír Chonaill, seizing several hostages and secured them within Sligo Castle.[3] The year afterwards, Maol Seachlainn counter-attacked Maurice, and the hostages were killed in retaliation.[4]

In 1247, Fitz Gerald invaded Tír Chonaill again, and was halted at Ballyshannon by the combined forces of Cineál Chonaill and Cineál Eoghain. When Cormac Ó Conchobhair forded the River Erne and came upon Maol Seachlainn's combined forces from the rear,[5] and Maol Seachlainn fell in the resulting Battle of Ballyshannon.[6]

Following Maol Seachlainn's death, Fitz Gerald installed Ruaidhrí Ó Cannanáin as King of Tír Chonaill. The latter, however, was later repulsed and slain by Gofraidh.[7]

Maol Seachlainn is the subject of a contemporary elegy composed by Giolla Brighde Mac Con Midhe (died c. 1272).[8]
