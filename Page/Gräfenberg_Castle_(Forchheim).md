GRÄFENBERG CASTLE () is the older of two former castles in Gräfenberg in the Upper Franconian county of Forchheim in the south German state of Bavaria. Today, there is little left of the castle; it is classed as a _burgstall_ and the site is in the area of _Bahnhofstraße_ 11 to 21. The castle was first recorded in the year 1477; its last remains were removed from about 1563.
