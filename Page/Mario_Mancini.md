MARIO MANCINI (born LEONARD INZITARI; June 21, 1966) is a retired American professional wrestler who mainly worked in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as a babyface jobber from 1984 to 1991.


Wrestling career

Mancini debuted in the WWF in 1984 on July 31, 1984, and turned professional only six weeks after his 18th birthday, making him the youngest wrestler in the WWF at the time.[1] He had his first match against Greg Valentine. Mancini had very little success, as he has never appeared on a pay-per-view card, and his record shows he only scored three wins out of 128 matches in the WWF.[2] The first occurred in 1984, when he teamed with Swede Hanson and defeated the team of Johnny Rodz and AJ Petrucci at the Herbert H. Lehman High School in New York City.[3] In 1985, he defeated fellow non-entity Gino Carabello at a house show in New Haven, Connecticut.[4] His final win was over a jobber named Vance Veron in a match in Newington, Connecticut, in 1991.[5] He was the first televised opponent of King Kong Bundy in 1985 The Hart Foundation, Hercules Hernandez, Demolition, Big Bully Busick and The Undertaker in 1990.[6]
