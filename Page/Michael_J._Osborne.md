MICHAEL J. OSBORNE (born September 20, 1949, in Amarillo, Texas) is an author, inventor, entrepreneur, visionary and energy policymaker. He has been a pioneer in promoting Texas renewable energy resources for over three decades. He was one of three founding members of the Texas Renewable Energy Industries Alliance (TREIA).[1] His public service appointments have included the steering committees of the [Texas|State of Texas]] Energy Policy Partnership (STEPP)[2] and the Sustainable Energy Development Council[3] under _Governor Ann Richards;_ and later, the Texas Energy Coordination Council[4] appointed by Governor George W. Bush. As chair of the Austin Electric Utility Commission,[5] Osborne has traveled internationally to speak and consult about the Texas energy experience.[6] In 2015 he was part of the Austin, Texas delegation to the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris, France.


Early life and education

The youngest of two sons born to Maxine Joan Chambers Osborne (a businesswoman and investor) and Jack Harold Osborne (a World War II navy pilot and rancher), Michael was born in Amarillo, Texas on September 20, 1949. When he was six, his family moved to the small town of Pampa, Texas, where he later became captain of the Pampa High School golf team and played guitar and piano in two rock-and-roll bands. He graduated in 1967. At the age of seventeen Michael moved to Austin, Texas to attend the University of Texas and majored in aerospace engineering and later, business marketing. He withdrew from school one semester short of a degree after his business school dean denied him project credit for an advertising agency, Directions Company, he had started on the side.


Professional life

MARKETING MUSIC. As founder of _Directions Company,_[7] Michael focused on marketing music venues such as _Castle Creek,_ _Mother Earth_, and the legendary _Armadillo World Headquarters_[8] (1973-1980), a famed venue that led the Music of Austin Texas to national prominence. The _Armadillo_ became a springboard for the careers of celebrated musicians such as: _Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Marcia Ball, Joe Ely, Jerry Jeff Walker, Bruce Springsteen, Shiva’s Headband,_ and many more.

RENEWABLE ENERGY BUSINESS  Influenced by architect, inventor and philosopher, _Buckminster Fuller_, who believed in the importance of _renewable energy_, Osborne began to focus on the renewable energy business in the late 1970s by building _passive solar homes_ and selling energy-saving wood stoves. In 1981 he developed the first _wind energy_ project (consisting of five 25-kilowatt _wind turbines_) that sold energy to an _electric utility_ in Texas. in 1983, he signed on as the first distributor in Texas for _Solarex_,[9] a now-defunct maker of _solar cells_[10] used then as power sources for such things as ranch gates, railroad signals and other places where stringing power lines was difficult or expensive. In the 1990s he ran the Texas operations for _Zond Energy_, which is now part of _GE Wind Energy_,[11] the largest U.S. _wind turbine_ maker. Throughout the 80's and 90s, Osborne documented and leased the wind resource for Texas wind fields. Many of his exploits are documented in the book, _The Great Texas Wind Rush_.[12]

In 1999, Osborne was awarded Patent No. US5961739A for his invention of the hemispheric moving focus power plant.[13]

RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICY.  In 1984 Osborne co-founded the _Texas Renewable Energy Industries Association (now Alliance) (TREIA)_[14] with two partners and worked with other key individuals and organizations to bring the nascent _renewable energy_ industry to the attention of policymakers on the state and federal level. Governor Ann Richards appointed him to the steering committees of the State of _Texas Energy Policy Partnership_ and the _Sustainable Energy Development Council_ followed by an appointment by Richards’ successor, George W. Bush to the _Texas Energy Coordination Council._

In 2002, Osborne was commissioned by the _City of Austin_ to write a white paper funded by a _U.S. Department of Energy_ (DOE) Grant, to develop a _Sustainable Energy_ Plan for the City. The white paper was published as the book, _Silver In The Mine_.[15] He was subsequently hired by the City to implement this sustainable energy plan as Director of Grants, Patents and R&D. Osborne served as Special Assistant to two _Austin Energy_ General Managers and was charged with developing a vision for Austin which included a successful national campaign to get the automakers to support mass production of _plug-in hybrid electric vehicles_.

Upon leaving Austin Energy in 2014, Osborne served as Chairman of the _City of Austin Electric Utility Commission_[16] from 2014 to 2016 and currently serves as a member of that body. He was also appointed Chairman of the _City of Austin Generation Resource Planning Task Force_,[17] which resulted in an adopted generation plan[18] to bring Austin (the nation's 7th largest public power utility and the 11th largest city in America) to 55% renewable energy by 2025.[19] Michael is also the principal of The Osborne Companies. He lives in Austin with his longtime partner, Dr. Dana Sprute.[20]


Author

Osborne is a published writer. His book, _Lightland_,[21] is a philosophical look at the human potential in light of the challenge of climate change. His book, _Silver in the Mine_,[22] is a long-term comprehensive energy plan for the City of Austin, Texas. His third is an allegory called _Day of the Heart_.[23] His most recent work is _Beyond Light and Dark_.[24]
