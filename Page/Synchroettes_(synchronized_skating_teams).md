SYNCHROETTES - synchronized skating teams, formed by the head coach Geri Lynch Tomich in 2001, represent the Essex Skating Club of New Jersey, United States. The Synchroettes skaters are from around the world, including China, Russia, Ukraine, Great Britain, Uruguay and Colombia in the season of 2016-2017. However the teams are composed primarily of skaters from the New York City and New Jersey.


Teams

The U.S. Figure Skating Association has chosen the Synchroettes Junior team to represent the country at the international competitions during the seasons of 2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, recognizing it as one of the most successful synchronized skating teams in U.S. history. As the Junior Team USA, the Synchroettes went to earn silver medals in 2014 and bronze medals in 2013 at the highly regarded Leon Lurje Trophy international competition in Sweden.[1][2][3]

In the season of 2016-2017, most of the Synchroettes teams have 16 members. In addition to that, each of the teams has up to four reserve skators who practice with their teams and perform at competitions in case main skaters become injured or unavailable to skate due to any other reason. Reserves skaters are called “spot sharers” in the sport.

The Synchroettes teams of the season 2016-2017 include teams of the following levels:

-   Junior (Skaters are at least 13 years old and under 19, they all have passed at least the Intermediate Moves in the Field test)
-   Novice (Most of the team members are under 16 and have passed at least the Juvenile Moves in the Field test, this is a cross-skater team)
-   Intermediate (Skaters are under 18 and all of them have passed the Pre-Juvenile Moves in the Field test, the team was cut as of the 2017-18 season)
-   Juvenile (skaters are under 13, all of the team’s members have passed the Preliminary Moves in the Field test, however, to skate at competitions, skaters must have passed the pre-juvenile moves in the field test, abbreviation “Juv”)
-   Pre-juvenile (the majority of the team are under 12 years old, abbreviation “Pre-Juv”)
-   Preliminary (skaters are under 12 years old, with the majority of the team under 10, abbreviation “Prelim”)
-   Beginner-1, Beginner-2 are the two teams for young skaters, who have not yet passes any USFSA ice skating tests.

In the season of 2016-2017 the Synchroetts debuted the Unified team, giving an opportunity for kids and adults with special needs to skate on the same team with competitive skaters.

The Synchroettes teams won in many regional competitions and competed in national competitions for many years. They also performed in many public appearances and participated in community service skating events such as Toys for Tots and a show to benefit Susan G. Komen for the Cure.[4] In 2010, its Juvenile team won the gold medal of the 2010 U.S. Synchronized Skating Championships in Minneapolis, Minnesota.[5] The success of the Essex Skating Club's synchronized skating teams was recognized by the U.S. Figure Skating in its publication, _Guide to Basic Skills and Beginner Synchronized Skating_, as one of the two featured clubs to inspire skating clubs around the U.S. to start a basic skills/beginner synchronized skating program.[6]

In 2012, the Junior-level team of Synchroettes was selected by the U.S. Figure Skating to be part of the Team USA for 2012-13 season to compete in Leon Lurje Trophy international competition in Sweden.[7] The team won a bronze medal in the competition.[8]

All of the Synchroettes teams typically hold their tryout sessions for skaters seeking to join the teams for next season during March and April. The skates are strongly encouraged to practice several times a week on ice and off ice, including instructions with private coaches. Members of the teams competing on the national level are expected to demonstrate advanced figure skating skills and pass special tests approved by the U.S. Figure Skating Association, such as a set of tests called Moves in the Field, ice dance and freestyle ice skating tests.

The Synchroettes’ home rink is Codey Arena in West Orange, New Jersey, the teams also practice at Clary Andresen Arena in Montclair, New Jersey.
