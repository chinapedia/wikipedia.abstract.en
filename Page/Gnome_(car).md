Power was provided by a single cylinder, air cooled, two stroke engine, 343 cc Villiers engine mounted at the rear of the car and driving the rear wheels through a Friction drive arranged to give four forward ratios and reverse. [2]

The car had a combined body and chassis made of steel and plywood and could seat two. The front bonnet could be removed to reveal a luggage compartment. An unusual feature was the lack of any suspension, the only springing was provided by inflating the tyres to only . [3]

The cars were priced at £75.
