ELIZABETH COOPER (fl. 1865â€“1874) was an English historian and biographer of the mid-Victorian period, known for three publications on the history of America, on Lady Arbella Stuart, and on Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford.


Biography

Little appears to be known of Cooper apart from her publications, and a few reviews and commentaries relating to them; she appears to have been unmarried, at least during the period in which she was published.[1]

In 1865 she published _A Popular History of America_, subtitled '' From the Discovery by Columbus to the Establishment of the Federal Republic of the United States In Three Periods: I. The Discovery and Conquest of the West Indies and South America II. The Colonization of the United States III. The War of Independence and the Establishment of the Federal Government''. The history, covering both the north and south of the continent, runs to 527 pages and includes two fold-out maps.[2][3]

In the following year, 1866, she published a two-volume _The Life and Letters of Lady Arabella Stuart_, based on her studies of Stuart-related papers held by Thomas Phillipps, Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton, George Digby Wingfield Digby and others.[4][5] The _Westminster and Foreign Quarterly Review_ described the work as a carefully painted portrait, built on 'numerous original and hitherto unpublished documents', and written with 'quiet taste and sober treatment'.[6]

She next published _The Life of Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Stafford_ in 1874; the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography speculates that the gap between this and the _Arabella Stuart_ might arise out of illness; her dedication in _Stafford_ is to Edward Lane, a medical doctor and hydrotherapist who ran establishments at Moor Park, Farnham and Sudbrook Park, Petersham; Cooper evidently believed he had rescued her from certain death.[7] The two-volume _Stafford_ was the first scholarly treatise on Wentworth, and was received with generally good reviews.[8]
