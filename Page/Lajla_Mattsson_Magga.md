Biography

Born in Kali in central Sweden's Åre Municipality, Magga is the daughter of the reindeer herder Gustaf Edvard Mattson (1897–1973) and Elin Margareta Larsson (1887–1973), also a reindeer herder.[3] A qualified teacher, she attended the University of Oslo where she studied the South Sami language. She has a wide field of interest, comprising fiction and non-fiction, translation, teaching, acquisition of language material, and lexicography. In addition to teaching South Sami in both Norway and Sweden, she has acted as an examiner for the Nord-Trøndelag University College.[4]

In 1984, she published her first book _Maahke ryöknie_, followed by other children's books and textbooks. Magga has carried out research on the South Sami language and its terminology, leading for example to the standardization of place names.[5]

In 1993, together with Knut Bergsland, she published the Southern Sami-Norwegian dictionary _Åarjelsaemiendaaroen baakoegaerja/Sydsamisk-norsk ordbok_.[6] She had also published children's books in the South Sami language as well as a Norwegian-South Sami dictionary.[7]

In 2010, Magga was awarded the Nordic Sami language prize, Gollegiella. Not only had Magga taught Southern Sami for many years, she had also published dictionaries. She was currently working on a translation of the Bible into South Sami and was writing a grammar of South Sami together with her husband.[8][9]
