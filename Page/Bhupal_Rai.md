About his life and career

[2] Poet Bhupal Rai was born in Bastim Village of Bhojpur(also known as Maajh Kirat),eastern hilly district of Nepal.

After his high school education, he moved to Kathmandu for higher studies. His literary journey started with publication of his first poem in "Chhahara" monthly magazine around 1977 AD. The magazine was published by his elder brother Gopal Chhanchha. Bhupal became regular columnist in that magazine later with sattirical column called "Bela ko boli".

He indulged himself in song writing and music composing in 1980s. He also recorded a number of songs as Radio Nepal Singer during that decade. But after 1990s, he quit singing to focus in writing. He believes that not only in his poems but also in his songs, he has written about the racial discriminations, class struggles and Kirat culture and values.[3]
