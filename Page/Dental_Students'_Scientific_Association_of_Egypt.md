DENTAL STUDENTS' SCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATION OF EGYPT () is a non-governmental organization that aims mainly to promote public awareness of oral and dental health among Egyptian society, and to improve the scientific knowledge and soft skills of Egyptian and non-Egyptian dental students all over Arab Republic of Egypt.[1]


History

In September 1969, group of students from Alexandria Faculty of Dentistry with Prof. Dr. Mahmoud Elhadary (dean of faculty at that time) traveled to Prague (capital of Czechoslovakia Republic at that time) to attend the annual meeting of the International Association of Dental Students.[2]

They were impressed by activities and projects which are organized by IADS and its national and local member organizations worldwide, so they decided to bring this idea to their home country.

Later 1970, Dental Students' Scientific Association of Egypt was officially established and recognized by its headquarters university (Alexandria University). Then two years later, the International Association of Dental Students has accepted the application for Full Country Membership of DSSA-Egypt.[3]

In 2005, Faculty of Dentistry â€“ Tanta University has decided to join this national association which represents Egyptian dental students globally. By the next year, Tanta Scientific Association of Dental Students (TSADS) won the Full Local Membership in DSSA-Egypt to be the second Local member after Alexandria.[4]
