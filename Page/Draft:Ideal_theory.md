Let _R_ be a ring and _M_ a module. Given a prime ideal 𝔭, let f : M → M_(𝔭) be the localization map. Then, for each submodule _N_⊂ _M_, f(N)R_(𝔭) is the submodule of M_(𝔭) and the pre-image f^( − 1)(f(N)R_(𝔭)) is called the 𝔭-primary component of _N_ in _M_. We have:

𝔭
is a minimal prime over Ann_(R)(M) and M → M_(𝔭) is injective if and only if

Let _R_ be a ring. Given ideals _J_ ⊂ _I_ in _R_, the ideal _I_ is said to be INTEGRAL over _J_ if the Rees algebra _R_[_It_] is an integral ring extension of _R_[_Jt_].

By definition, the FIBER RING of a local ring (_R_, 𝔪) along an ideal _I_ is

$$\mathcal{F}_I(R) = R[It] \otimes_R \kappa(\mathfrak{m}) \simeq \bigoplus_{n=0}^{\infty} I^n/\mathfrak{m} I^n$$
. The Krull dimension of ℱ_(I)(R) is called the ANALYTIC SPREAD of _I_ and is denoted by an(I). If κ(𝔪) is infinite, then an(I) is the integer _n_ such that _I_ is integral over an ideal generated by _n_ elements. Indeed, if n = an(I), then


Extensions of ideals

Let 𝔭 be a prime ideal in a ring _R_. Given a ring homomorphism _f_: _R_→ _S_, we write 𝔭S for the ideal generated by f(𝔭) (which need not be a prime ideal.) We say

-   𝔭 _splits_ in _S_ if 𝔭S is not a primary ideal.
-   𝔭 is _unramified_ in _S_ if 𝔭S is a radical ideal; otherwise 𝔭 is said to ramify.


Reduction theory

The reduction theory goes back to the influential 1954 paper by Northcott and Rees, the paper that introduced the basic notions.

Given ideals _J_ ⊂ _I_ in a ring _R_, the ideal _J_' is said to be a _reduction_ of _I_ if there is some integer _m_ > 0 such that JI^(m) = I^(m + 1). Note for any _k_, we then have J^(k)I^(m) = J^(k − 1)I^(m + 1) = ⋯ = I^(m + k).

If _R_ is a Noetherian ring, then _J_ is a reduction of _I_ if and only if, for all maximal ideal 𝔪, J_(𝔪) is a reduction of I_(𝔪).[1] Also, if _R_ is a Noetherian ring, then _J_ is a reduction of _I_ if and only if the Rees algebra _R_[_It_] is finite over _R_[_Jt_]. Thus, when _J_ is a reduction of _I_ and _R_ is a Noetherian local ring, since _I_ is then integral over _J_, the minimum number of the generators of _J_ is bounded below by the analytic spread of _I_.

Assume _R_ is a Noetherian local ring. Let Σ be the set of all reductions of _I_ contained in _J_. We claim it has a minimal element.


The multiplicity of an ideal

The references for this section are and .

Let _R_ be a Noetherian local ring and 𝔮 a primary ideal. Then we can write (TODO: assumption?)

$$\operatorname{length}_R(R/\mathfrak{q}^n) = e(\mathfrak{q}){n^d \over d!} + \text{lower-order term}$$
. It turns out (how?) that e(𝔮) is a positive integer and is called the multiplicity of the ideal 𝔮.


Local cohomology in ideal theory

Local cohomology can sometimes be used to obtain information on an ideal. This section assumes some familiarity with sheaf theory and scheme theory.

Let M be a module over a ring R and I an ideal. Then M determines the sheaf M̃ on Y = Spec (R) − V(I) (the restriction to _Y_ of the sheaf associated to _M_). Unwinding the definition, one sees:

$$\Gamma_I(M) := \Gamma(Y, \widetilde{M}) = \varinjlim \operatorname{Hom}(I^n, M)$$
. Here, Γ_(I)(M) is called the IDEAL TRANSFORM of M with respect to I.[2]
