KORNBLUTH (July 2, 1923[1] – March 21, 1958) was an American science fiction author and a member of the Futurians. He used a variety of pen-names, including CECIL CORWIN, S. D. GOTTESMAN, EDWARD J. BELLIN, KENNETH FALCONER, WALTER C. DAVIES, SIMON EISNER, JORDAN PARK, ARTHUR COOKE, PAUL DENNIS LAVOND, and SCOTT MARINER.[2] The "M" in Kornbluth's name may have been in tribute to his wife, Mary Byers;[3] Kornbluth's colleague and collaborator Frederik Pohl confirmed Kornbluth's lack of any actual middle name in at least one interview.[4]


Biography

Kornbluth was born and grew up in the uptown Manhattan neighborhood of Inwood, in New York City.[5] He was of Polish Jewish descent,[6] the son of a "second-generation [American] Jew" who ran his own tailor shop. According to his widow, Kornbluth was a "precocious child", learning to read by the age of three and writing his own stories by the time he was seven. He graduated from high school at thirteen, received a CCNY scholarship at fourteen, and was "thrown out for leading a student strike" without graduating.[7]

As a teenager, he became a member of the Futurians, an influential group of science fiction fans and writers. While a member of the Futurians, he met and became friends with Frederik Pohl, Donald A. Wollheim, Robert A. W. Lowndes, and his future wife Mary Byers. He also participated in the Fantasy Amateur Press Association.

Kornbluth served in the US Army during World War II (European 'Theatre').[8] He received a Bronze Star for his service in the Battle of the Bulge, where he served as a member of a heavy machine gun crew. Upon his discharge, he returned to finish his education at the University of Chicago under the G.I. Bill.[9] While living in Chicago he also worked at Trans-Radio Press, a news wire service. In 1951 he started writing full-time,[10] returning to the East Coast where he collaborated on novels with his old Futurian friends Frederik Pohl and Judith Merril.


Work

Kornbluth began writing at 15. His first solo story, "The Rocket of 1955", was published in Richard Wilson's fanzine _Escape_ (Vol. 1, No 2, August 1939); his first collaboration, "Stepsons of Mars," written with Richard Wilson and published under the name "Ivar Towers", appeared in the April 1940 _Astonishing_. His other short fiction includes "The Little Black Bag", "The Marching Morons", "The Altar at Midnight", "MS. Found in a Chinese Fortune Cookie", "Gomez" and "The Advent on Channel 12".

"The Little Black Bag" was first adapted for television live on the television show _Tales of Tomorrow_ on May 30, 1952. It was later adapted for television by the BBC in 1969 for its _Out of the Unknown_ series. In 1970, the same story was adapted by Rod Serling for an episode of his _Night Gallery_ series. This dramatization starred Burgess Meredith as the alcoholic Dr. William Fall, who had long lost his doctor's license and become a homeless alcoholic. He finds a bag containing advanced medical technology from the future (2098), which, after an unsuccessful attempt to pawn it, he uses benevolently.

"The Marching Morons" is a look at a far future in which the world's population consists of five billion idiots and a few million geniuses – the precarious minority of the "elite" working desperately to keep things running behind the scenes. In his introduction to _The Best of C.M. Kornbluth_, Pohl states that "The Marching Morons" is a direct sequel to "The Little Black Bag": it is easy to miss this, as "Bag" is set in the contemporary present while "Morons" takes place several centuries from now, and there is no character who appears in both stories. The titular black bag in the first story is actually an artifact from the time period of "The Marching Morons": a medical kit filled with self-driven instruments enabling a far-future moron to "play doctor". A future Earth similar to "The Marching Morons" – a civilisation of morons protected by a small minority of hidden geniuses – is used again in the final stages of Kornbluth & Pohl's _Search the Sky_.[11]

"MS. Found in a Chinese Fortune Cookie" (1957) is supposedly written by Kornbluth using notes by "Cecil Corwin", who has been declared insane and incarcerated, and who smuggles out in fortune cookies the ultimate secret of life. This fate is said to be Kornbluth's response to the unauthorized publication of "Mask of Demeter" (as by "Corwin" and "Martin Pearson" (Donald A. Wollheim)) in Wollheim's anthology _Prize Science Fiction_ in 1953.[12]

Biographer Mark Rich describes the 1958 story "Two Dooms" as one of several stories which are "concern[ed] with the ethics of theoretical science" and which "explore moral quandaries of the atomic age":

Many of Kornbluth's novels were written as collaborations: either with Judith Merril (using the pseudonym Cyril Judd), or with Frederik Pohl. These include _Gladiator-At-Law_ and _The Space Merchants_.[13] _The Space Merchants_ contributed significantly to the maturing and to the wider academic respectability of the science fiction genre, not only in America but also in Europe.[14] Kornbluth also wrote several novels under his own name, including _The Syndic_ and _Not This August_.


Death

Kornbluth died at age 34 in Levittown, New York. Scheduled to meet with Bob Mills in New York City to interview for the position of editor of _The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction_,[15] Kornbluth had to shovel snow from his driveway, which delayed him. Running to meet his train, he suffered a fatal heart attack on the platform of the station.[16]

A number of short stories remained unfinished at Kornbluth's death; these were eventually completed and published by Pohl. One of these stories, "The Meeting" (_The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction_, November 1972), was the co-winner of the 1973 Hugo Award for Best Short Story; it tied with R. A. Lafferty's "Eurema's Dam."[17] Almost all of Kornbluth's solo SF stories have been collected as _His Share of Glory: The Complete Short Science Fiction of C. M. Kornbluth_ (NESFA Press, 1997).


Personality and habits

Frederik Pohl, in his autobiography _The Way the Future Was_, Damon Knight, in his memoir _The Futurians_, and Isaac Asimov, in his memoirs _In Memory Yet Green_ and _I. Asimov: A Memoir_, all give descriptions of Kornbluth as a man of odd personal habits and eccentricities.

Kornbluth, for example, decided to educate himself by reading his way through an entire encyclopedia from A to Z; in the course of this effort, he acquired a great deal of esoteric knowledge that found its way into his stories, in alphabetical order by subject. When Kornbluth wrote a story that mentioned the _ballista_, an Ancient Roman weapon, Pohl knew that Kornbluth had finished the 'A's and had started on the 'B's.

According to Pohl, Kornbluth never brushed his teeth, and they were literally green. Deeply embarrassed by this, Kornbluth developed the habit of holding his hand in front of his mouth when speaking.

Kornbluth disliked black coffee, but felt obliged to acquire a taste for it because he believed that professional authors were "supposed to" drink black coffee. He trained himself by putting gradually less cream into each cup of coffee he drank, until he eventually "weaned himself" (Knight's description) and switched to black coffee.

Spider Robinson praised this collection, saying "I haven't enjoyed a book so much in years."[20] Mark Rich wrote, "Critics judging Kornbluth by this anthology, edited by Pohl, have seen a growing bitterness in his later stories. This reflects editorial choice more than reality, because Kornbluth also wrote delightful humor in his last years, in stories not collected here. These tales demonstrate Kornbluth's effective use of everyday individuals from a variety of ethnic backgrounds as well as his well-tuned ear for dialect."[21]
