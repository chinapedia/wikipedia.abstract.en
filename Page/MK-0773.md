MK-0773, also known as PF-05314882, is a steroidal, orally active selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) that was under development by Merck and GTx for the treatment of sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass) in women and men.[1][2][3] Clinical trials for sarcopenia began in late 2007 but the collaboration between Merck and GTx ended in early 2010 and GTx terminated development of MK-0773 shortly thereafter.[4]

MK-0773 is a 4-azasteroid[5] and a potent and selective agonist of the androgen receptor (AR).[6] It binds to the AR with an IC₅₀ of 6.6 nM and is a partial agonist in transactivation modulation of the AR with an IP of 25 nM and E_(max) of 78% and has a TRAF2 E_(max)of 29% and a virilization (N/C interaction) counterscreen assay E_(max) of 2%.[7] That is, it produces promoter activation but induces the N/C interaction almost negligibly.[8] MK-0773 is reportedly four times as potent as testosterone as an agonist of the AR.[9] The drug is selective and does not bind to other steroid hormone receptors such as the progesterone receptor or glucocorticoid receptor and shows no significant inhibition of 5α-reductase (IC₅₀ > 10 μM).[10] In addition, it is non-aromatizable and hence has no potential for estrogenic effects or side effects, like gynecomastia.[11] MK-0773 had similar effects on lipid metabolism relative to DHT, including a decrease in total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) of a similar magnitude.[12]

MK-0773 shows tissue-selective androgenic effects _in vivo_ in animals.[13] It increases lean body mass with maximal anabolic effects that are approximately 80% of those of dihydrotestosterone (DHT).[14] However, it had less than 5% of the effect of DHT on uterine weight, about 30 to 50% of the increase of sebaceous gland area induced by DHT, and increased the weight of the seminal vesicles by 12% of that of DHT at the highest dosage assessed.[15] It had similarly reduced effects on the prostate gland.[16] No significant increase in gene expression of six candidate genes of virilization was observed.[17] As such, MK-0773 shows a profile of an anabolic SARM with limited effects on sebaceous glands and reproductive tissues in animals and a minimal propensity for virilization.[18]

In human clinical studies, MK-0773 produced anabolism in women and men while producing no or very low effects on sebaceous glands, the endometrium, or the prostate gland after 12 weeks of treatment.[19][20] A decrease in total cholesterol and HDL was also observed in the clinical studies.[21] MK-0773 produced a significant increase in lean body mass in elderly (≥65 years of age) women with sarcopenia and moderate physical dysfunction.[22][23][24] It also increased muscle strength relative to placebo but this failed to reach statistical significance.[25][26] MK-0773 has been associated with elevated liver enzymes in clinical studies.[27]
