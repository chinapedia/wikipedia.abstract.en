Subspecies

-   _Meringopus calescens persicus_ Heinrich, 1937
-   _Meringopus calescens robustus_ (Cresson, 1864)


Distribution

Description

_Meringopus calescens_ can reach a length of about in females and about in males. These relatively large Ichneumonid have a black head and a well defined clypeus, with some heavy punctures. Thorax is black and sculptured. Mesoscutum is polished, with irregular punctures. Wings are quite infuscate. Legs show black coxae and trochanters, but the remaining parts are orange. Abdomen has a mostly fuscous 1st segment, 2nd and 3rd segments are orange, while the apical segments are mostly black. Ovipositor is slightly upcurved and can reach about 5Â mm.[4]


Behavior

These ichneumonid wasps have been observed apparently attempting to parasitize the sphecids _Ammophila sabulosa_ and _Podalonia affinis_, but they also parasitize _Saturnia pyri_.[5][6]
