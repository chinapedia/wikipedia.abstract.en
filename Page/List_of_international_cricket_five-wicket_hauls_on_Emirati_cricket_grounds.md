United Arab Emirates became an associate member of the ICC in 1990 and played first ODI in 1994 against India and Pakistan in the Austral-Asia Cup.

There are many world-famous cricket grounds in UAE, starts play international cricket way before the hosts played internationally. Sharjah Cricket Stadium, which was earlier known as the heart of limited over cricket, recorded the most number of ODIs held up to date, passing 215 in 2016.

In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a "five-for" or "fifer")[1][2] refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement.[3] The following list is about the five-wicket hauls taken at Emirati cricket grounds.
