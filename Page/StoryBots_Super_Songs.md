_STORYBOTS SUPER SONGS_ is an American animated children's television series based on the characters from the StoryBots educational apps and videos. It was created and produced by JibJab Bros. Studios (now StoryBots Inc.) and premiered on Netflix on October 7, 2016.[1] Episodes have also been released in full monthly on StoryBots' official YouTube channel.[2]

_StoryBots Super Songs_ serves as a companion show to _Ask the StoryBots_, the inaugural television series in the StoryBots franchise, which premiered on August 12, 2016, also on Netflix.

Plot

_StoryBots Super Songs_ centers on the StoryBots, who are curious little creatures who live in the world beneath our screens. However, while its predecessor _Ask the StoryBots_ follows Beep, Bing, Bang, Boop and Bo as they answer a child’s single question (like “why is the sky blue?”), the music-centric _Super Songs_ has the characters exploring broader subject areas.

“From the day _Ask the StoryBots_ launched back in August, we’ve been inundated with requests from kids, parents and teachers all over the world for more episodes,” said show co-creator Gregg Spiridellis. “We’re happy to be able to answer that call in a fun, new way with _StoryBots Super Songs_.”

“StoryBots caught fire online because of our catchy, short-form music videos on subjects like dinosaurs, shapes, colors, the alphabet and more,” said Evan Spiridellis, show co-creator. “This new format lets us tap into that heritage by mixing our trademark tunes with animated and live-action vignettes featuring our lead characters interacting with real kids.”[3]


Episodes

The series premiered with 5 episodes. Each half-hour episode focuses on two separate topics:[4]

-   “Outer Space / The Body”
-   “Dinosaurs / Vehicles”
-   “Shapes / Colors”
-   “Animals / Emotions”
-   “Professions / Farm Animals”


Reception

_StoryBots Super Songs_ was rated "excellent" by Brigham Young University's Children's Book & Media Review, which noted that the StoryBots "present interesting, complex, and sometimes goofy pieces of information together in a simple, entertaining, and memorable way that children will appreciate," while "the different mix of animation styles and live action in this TV show will keep children on the edge of their seats."[5]
