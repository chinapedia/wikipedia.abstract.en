The FIG TREE FORMATION, also called FIG TREE GROUP, is a stromatolite-containing geological formation in South Africa. The rock contains fossils of microscopic life forms of about 3.26 billion years old.[1] Identified organisms include the bacterium _Eobacterium isolatus_ and the algae-like _Archaeosphaeroides barbertonensis_. The fossils in the Fig Tree Formation are considered some of the oldest known organisms on Earth, and provide evidence that life may have existed much earlier than previously thought. The formation comprises shales, turbiditic, lithic greywackes, volcanoclastic sandstones, chert, turbiditic siltstone, conglomerate, breccias, mudstones, and iron-rich shales.[2]
