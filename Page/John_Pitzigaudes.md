JOHN PITZIGAUDES (), his surname variously also given as Pitzigaudios (Πιτζιγαύδιος), Pitzogabdes (Πιτζογάβδης), and Pittigaudes (Πιττιγαύδης) by different Byzantine chroniclers, was a Byzantine official and envoy.

He is mentioned by Theophanes the Confessor, as well as the later chroniclers Symeon Logothetes, Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople, Theodosius of Melitene, George Monachos, Kedrenos, Zonaras, and in Emperor Constantine VII's _De administrando imperio_. According to these accounts, he was of noble origin, a _patrikios_, and was highly experienced in political matters. Following the failed First Arab Siege of Constantinople he was sent, probably in 678, by Emperor Constantine IV, to conclude a peace treaty with the Umayyad caliph Mu'awiya I. According to Henry Yule, he is to be identified with the Byzantine envoy "Yenyo", who is mentioned in the Chinese _Old Book of Tang_ as leading the negotiations with the _Ta shi_ (the Arabs).
