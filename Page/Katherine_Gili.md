KATHERINE GILI is a British sculptor. Born in Oxford in 1948, she graduated from Bath Academy of Art in 1970 and then studied for two years at St Martin's School of Art. Gili subsequently taught at a number of art schools; most notably St Martin's and Norwich between 1972 and 1985.

Her sculpture was exhibited for the first time in 1973 and well over a hundred times since. Gili's career is marked by solo shows in London and New York and by contributions to seminal survey exhibitions at major venues such as the Hayward Gallery. In recent years she has regularly shown in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibitions and notably in 2013 her sculpture "Ripoll" won the Sculpture Prize.

Katherine Gili's work is represented in the Arts Council Collection and other public and corporate collections in the UK, Switzerland and the USA. Lord Foster selected one of her pieces to stand alongside the Cranfield University Institute of Technology Library which was designed by Foster Associates in 1992.
