_LETTERS TO LIVE POETS_ (1969) is the fourth poetry collection by Australian poet Bruce Beaver. It won the Grace Leven Prize for Poetry in 1970.[1]

The collection consists of 34 poems, all of which are published in this collection for the first time.[2]


Contents

All poems in the collection are titled and numbered in sequence using Roman numerals, except for the first which is titled "Letters to Live Poets : Frank O'Hara". Frank O'Hara was an American poet who was killed in a car accident in 1966.


Critical reception

_The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature_ called it Beaver's "major work" and noted that the book formed a "_livre composé_", a volume designed not as a collection of poems, but as a single poem, sustained through changing moods and verse-forms. They also note that the book was written "with obsessional purpose and speed, because Beaver believed he was losing his rationality."[3]

In a long essay examining the book's legacy and influence, Robert Savage notes "The American influences on _Letters to Live Poets_, particular the influence of American confessional poetry, are well documented, and prompt James Tulip to call _Letters_ «the most American work to have come out of Australia.»"[4]
