AMITABH BACHCHAN (; born INQUILAAB SRIVASTAVA;[1] 11 October 1942) is an Indian film actor, film producer, television host, occasional playback singer and former politician. He first gained popularity in the early 1970s for films such as _Zanjeer_, _Deewaar_ and _Sholay_, and was dubbed India's "angry young man" for his on-screen roles in Bollywood. Referred to as the _Shahenshah of Bollywood_, _Sadi ka Mahanayak_ (Hindi for, "Greatest actor of the century"), _Star of the Millennium_, or _Big B_,[2][3][4] he has since appeared in over 190 Indian films in a career spanning almost five decades.[5] Bachchan is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential actors in the history of Indian cinema as well as world cinema.[6][7][8][9][10] So total was his dominance on the Indian movie scene in the 1970s and 1980s that the French director François Truffaut called him a "one-man industry".[11] Beyond the Indian subcontinent, he also has a large overseas following in markets including Africa (such as South Africa), the Middle East (especially Egypt), United Kingdom, Russia and parts of the United States.[12][13][14]

Bachchan has won numerous accolades in his career, including four National Film Awards as Best Actor and many awards at international film festivals and award ceremonies. He has won fifteen Filmfare Awards and is the most nominated performer in any major acting category at Filmfare, with 41 nominations overall. In addition to acting, Bachchan has worked as a playback singer, film producer and television presenter. He has hosted several seasons of the game show _Kaun Banega Crorepati_, India's version of the game show franchise, _Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?_. He also entered politics for a time in the 1980s.

The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri in 1984, the Padma Bhushan in 2001 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2015 for his contributions to the arts. The Government of France honoured him with its highest civilian honour, Knight of the Legion of Honour, in 2007 for his exceptional career in the world of cinema and beyond. Bachchan also made an appearance in a Hollywood film, Baz Luhrmann's _The Great Gatsby_ (2013), in which he played a non-Indian Jewish character, Meyer Wolfsheim.


Early life and family

Bachchan was born in Allahabad.[15] His ancestors on his father's side came from a village called Babupatti, in the Raniganj tehsil, in the Pratapgarh district, in the present-day state of Uttar Pradesh, in India.[16] His mother, Teji Bachchan, was a social activist and Punjabi Sikh woman from Lyallpur, Punjab, British India (present-day Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan).[17] His father Harivansh Rai Bachchan was a Hindi-speaking Kayastha Hindu poet, who was also fluent in the related Hindustani dialects of Awadhi[18] and Urdu.[19]

Bachchan was initially named _Inquilaab_, inspired by the phrase _Inquilab Zindabad_ (which translates into English as "Long live the revolution") popularly used during the Indian independence struggle. However, at the suggestion of fellow poet Sumitranandan Pant, Harivansh Rai changed the boy's name to Amitabh, which, according to a _The Times of India_ article, means "the light that will never die".[20] Although his surname was Shrivastava, Amitabh's father had adopted the pen name Bachchan ("child-like" in colloquial Hindi), under which he published all of his works.[21] It is with this last name that Amitabh debuted in films and for all other practical purposes, Bachchan has become the surname for all of his immediate family.[22] Bachchan's father died in 2003, and his mother in 2007.[23]

Bachchan is an alumnus of Sherwood College, Nainital. He later attended Kirori Mal College, University of Delhi.[24] He has a younger brother, Ajitabh. His mother had a keen interest in theatre and was offered a feature film role, but she preferred her domestic duties. Teji had some influence in Amitabh Bachchan's choice of career because she always insisted that he should "take the centre stage".[25]

He is married to actress Jaya Bhaduri.[26]


Acting career

Early career (1969–1972)

Bachchan made his film debut in 1969, as a voice narrator in Mrinal Sen's National Award-winning film _Bhuvan Shome_.[27] His first acting role was as one of the seven protagonists in the film _Saat Hindustani_,[28] directed by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and featuring Utpal Dutt, Anwar Ali (brother of comedian Mehmood), Madhu and Jalal Agha.[29][30]

_Anand_ (1971) followed, in which Bachchan starred alongside Rajesh Khanna. His role as a doctor with a cynical view of life garnered Bachchan his first Filmfare _Best Supporting Actor_ award. He then played his first antagonist role as an infatuated lover-turned-murderer in _Parwana_ (1971). Following Parwana were several films including _Reshma Aur Shera_ (1971). During this time, he made a guest appearance in the film _Guddi_ which starred his future wife Jaya Bhaduri. He narrated part of the film _Bawarchi._ In 1972 he made an appearance in the road action comedy _Bombay to Goa_ directed by S. Ramanathan which was moderately successful.[31][32][33] Many of Bachchan's films during this early period did not do well, but that was about to change.[34]

Rise to stardom (1973–1974)

BigB_N_JayaB.jpg in 2013; the couple got married in 1973, after the release of _Zanjeer_.]]

Bachchan was struggling, seen as a "failed newcomer" who, by the age of 30, had twelve flops and only two hits (as a lead in _Bombay to Goa_ and supporting role in _Anand_). Bachchan was soon discovered by screenwriter duo Salim-Javed, consisting of Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar.[35] Salim Khan wrote the story, screenplay and script of _Zanjeer_ (1973), and conceived the "angry young man" persona of the lead role. Javed Akhtar came on board as co-writer,[36] and Prakash Mehra, who saw the script as potentially groundbreaking, as the film's director. However, they were struggling to find an actor for the lead "angry young man" role; it was turned down by a number of actors, owing to it going against the "romantic hero" image dominant in the industry at the time.[37] Salim-Javed soon discovered Bachchan and "saw his talent, which most makers didn’t. He was exceptional, a genius actor who was in films that weren’t good."[38] According to Salim Khan, they "strongly felt that Amitabh was the ideal casting for _Zanjeer_".[39] Salim Khan introduced Bachchan to Prakash Mehra,[40] and Salim-Javed insisted that Bachchan be cast for the role.[41]

_Zanjeer_ was a crime film with violent action,[42] in sharp contrast to the romantically themed films that had generally preceded it, and it established Amitabh in a new persona—the "angry young man" of Bollywood cinema.[43] He earned his first Filmfare Award nomination for Best Actor, with _Filmfare_ later considering this one of the most iconic performances of Bollywood history.[44] The film was a huge success and one of the highest-grossing films of that year, breaking Bachchan's dry spell at the box office and making him a star.[45] It was the first of many collaborations between Salim-Javed and Amitabh Bachchan; Salim-Javed wrote many of their subsequent scripts with Bachchan in mind for the lead role, and insisted on him being cast for their later films, including blockbusters such as _Deewaar_ (1975) and _Sholay_ (1975).[46] Salim Khan also introduced Bachchan to director Manmohan Desai with whom he formed a long and successful association, alongside Prakash Mehra and Yash Chopra.[47] Eventually, Bachchan became one of the most successful leading men of the film industry. Bachchan's portrayal of the wronged hero fighting a crooked system and circumstances of deprivation in films like _Zanjeer_, _Deeewar_, _Trishul_, _Kaala Patthar_, _Shakti_, resonated with the masses of the time, especially the youth who harbored a simmering discontent owing to social ills such as poverty, hunger, unemployment, corruption, social inequality and the brutal excesses of The Emergency. This led to Bachchan being dubbed as "angry young man", a journalistic catchphrase which became a metaphor for the dormant rage, frustration, restlessness, sense of rebellion and anti-establishment disposition of an entire generation, prevalent in 1970s India.[48][49][50][51]

The year 1973 was also when he married Jaya, and around this time they appeared in several films together: not only _Zanjeer_ but also subsequent films such as _Abhimaan_, which was released only a month after their marriage and was also successful at the box office. Later, Bachchan played the role of Vikram, once again along with Rajesh Khanna, in the film _Namak Haraam_, a social drama directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee and scripted by Biresh Chatterjee addressing themes of friendship. His supporting role won him his second Filmfare _Best Supporting Actor_ award.

In 1974, Bachchan made several guest appearances in films such as _Kunwara Baap_ and _Dost_, before playing a supporting role in _Roti Kapda Aur Makaan_. The film, directed and written by Manoj Kumar, addressed themes of honesty in the face of oppression and financial and emotional hardship, and was the top-earning film of 1974. Bachchan then played the leading role in the film _Majboor_. The film was a success at the box office.[52]

Superstardom (1975–1986)

In 1975, he starred in a variety of film genres, from the comedy _Chupke Chupke_ and the crime drama _Faraar_ to the romantic drama _Mili_. This was also the year in which Bachchan starred in two films regarded as important in Hindi cinema history, both written by Salim-Javed, who again insisted on casting Bachchan.[53] The first was _Deewaar_, directed by Yash Chopra, where he worked with Shashi Kapoor, Nirupa Roy, Parveen Babi, and Neetu Singh, and earned another Filmfare nomination for Best Actor. The film became a major hit at the box office in 1975, ranking in at number four.[54] _Indiatimes Movies_ ranks _Deewaar_ amongst the _Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films_.[55] The other, released on 15 August 1975, was _Sholay_, which became the highest-grossing film ever in India at the time,[56] in which Bachchan played the role of Jaidev. _Deewaar_ and _Sholay_ are often credited with exalting Bachchan to the heights of superstardom, two years after he became a star with _Zanjeer_, and consolidating his domination of the industry throughout the 1970s and 1980s.[57][58] In 1999, BBC India declared _Sholay_ the "Film of the Millennium" and, like _Deewar_, it has been cited by _Indiatimes Movies_ as amongst the _Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films_.[59] In that same year, the judges of the 50th annual Filmfare Awards awarded it with the special distinction award called the Filmfare Best Film of 50 Years.

In 1976, he was cast by Yash Chopra in the romantic family drama _Kabhie Kabhie_. Bachchan starred as a young poet, Amit Malhotra, who falls deeply in love with a beautiful young girl named Pooja (Rakhee Gulzar) who ends up marrying someone else (Shashi Kapoor). The film was notable for portraying Bachchan as a romantic hero, a far cry from his "angry young man" roles like _Zanjeer_ and _Deewar_. The film evoked a favourable response from critics and audiences alike. Bachchan was again nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for his role in the film. That same year he played a double role in the hit _Adalat_ as father and son. In 1977, he won his first Filmfare Best Actor Award for his performance in _Amar Akbar Anthony_, in which he played the third lead opposite Vinod Khanna and Rishi Kapoor as Anthony Gonsalves. The film was the highest-grossing film of that year. His other successes that year include _Parvarish_ and _Khoon Pasina_.[60]

He once again resumed double roles in films such as _Kasme Vaade_ (1978) as Amit and Shankar and _Don_ (1978) playing the characters of Don, a leader of an underworld gang and his look-alike Vijay. His performance won him his second Filmfare Best Actor Award. He also gave towering performances in Yash Chopra's _Trishul_ and Prakash Mehra's _Muqaddar Ka Sikandar_ both of which earned him further Filmfare Best Actor nominations. 1978 is arguably considered his most successful year at the box office since all of his six releases the same year, namely _Muqaddar Ka Sikandar_, _Trishul_, _Don_, _Kasme Vaade_, _Ganga Ki Saugandh_ and _Besharam_ were massive successes, the former three being the consecutive highest-grossing films of the year, remarkably releasing within a couple of months of each other, a rare feat in Indian cinema.[61][62][63]

In 1979, Bachchan starred in _Suhaag_ which was the highest earning film of that year. In the same year he also enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success with films like _Mr. Natwarlal_, _Kaala Patthar_, _The Great Gambler_ and _Manzil_. Amitabh was required to use his singing voice for the first time in a song from the film _Mr. Natwarlal_ in which he starred with Rekha. Bachchan's performance in the film saw him nominated for both the Filmfare Best Actor Award and the _Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer_. He also received Best Actor nomination for _Kaala Patthar_ and then went on to be nominated again in 1980 for the Raj Khosla directed film _Dostana_, in which he starred opposite Shatrughan Sinha and Zeenat Aman. _Dostana_ proved to be the top-grossing film of 1980.[64] In 1981, he starred in Yash Chopra's melodrama film _Silsila_, where he starred alongside his wife Jaya and also Rekha. Other successful films of this period include _Shaan_ (1980), _Ram Balram_ (1980), _Naseeb_ (1981), _Lawaaris_ (1981), _Kaalia_ (1981), _Yaarana_ (1981), _Barsaat Ki Ek Raat_ (1981) and _Shakti_ (1982), also starring Dilip Kumar.

In 1982, he played double roles in the musical _Satte Pe Satta_ and action drama'' Desh Premee'' which succeeded at the box office along with mega hits like action comedy _Namak Halaal_, action drama _Khud-Daar_ and the critically acclaimed drama _Bemisal_.[65] In 1983, he played a triple role in _Mahaan_ which was not as successful as his previous films.[66] Other releases during that year included _Nastik_, _Andha Kanoon_ (in which he had an extended guest appearance) which were hits and _Pukar_ was an average grosser[67] During a stint in politics from 1984 to 1987, his completed films _Mard_ (1985) and _Aakhree Raasta_ (1986) were released and were major hits.[68]

_Coolie_ injury (1982–1983)

On 26 July 1982, while filming _Coolie_, in the University Campus in Bangalore, Bachchan suffered a near-fatal intestinal injury during the filming of a fight scene with co-actor Puneet Issar.[69] Bachchan was performing his own stunts in the film and one scene required him to fall onto a table and then on the ground. However, as he jumped towards the table, the corner of the table struck his abdomen, resulting in a splenic rupture from which he lost a significant amount of blood. He required an emergency splenectomy and remained critically ill in hospital for many months, at times close to death. The overwhelming public response included prayers in temples and offers to sacrifice limbs to save him, while later, there were long queues of well-wishing fans outside the hospital where he was recuperating.[70]

Nevertheless, he resumed filming later that year after a long period of recuperation. The film was released in 1983, and partly due to the huge publicity of Bachchan's accident, the film was a box office success and the top-grossing film of that year.[71]

The director, Manmohan Desai, altered the ending of _Coolie_ after Bachchan's accident. Bachchan's character was originally intended to have been killed off but after the change of script, the character lived in the end. It would have been inappropriate, said Desai, for the man who had just fended off death in real life to be killed on screen. Also, in the released film the footage of the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption appears onscreen marking this as the instant of the actor's injury and the ensuing publicity of the accident.[72]

Later, he was diagnosed with Myasthenia gravis. His illness made him feel weak both mentally and physically and he decided to quit films and venture into politics. At this time he became pessimistic, expressing concern with how a new film would be received, and stating before every release, "Yeh film to flop hogi!" ("This film will flop").[73]

Career decline and retirement (1988–1992)

Amitabhbachchan28529.jpg]] After a three year stint in politics from 1984 to 1987, Bachchan returned to films in 1988, playing the title role in _Shahenshah_, which was a box office success.[74] After the success of his comeback film however, his star power began to wane as all of his subsequent films like _Jaadugar_, _Toofan_ and _Main Azaad Hoon_ (all released in 1989) failed at the box office. Successes during this period like the crime drama _Aaj Ka Arjun_ (1990) and action crime drama _Hum_ (1991), for which he won his third Filmfare Best Actor Award, looked like they might reverse the trend, but this momentum was short-lived and his string of box office failures continued.[75][76] Notably, despite the lack of hits, it was during this era that Bachchan won his first National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance as a Mafia don in the 1990 cult film _Agneepath._ These years would see his last on-screen appearances for some time. After the release of the critically acclaimed epic _Khuda Gawah_ in 1992, Bachchan went into semi-retirement for five years. With the exception of the delayed release of _Insaniyat_ (1994), which was also a box office failure, Bachchan did not appear in any new releases for five years.[77]

Productions and acting comeback (1996–1999)

Bachchan turned producer during his temporary retirement period, setting up Amitabh Bachchan Corporation, Ltd. (ABCL) in 1996. ABCL's strategy was to introduce products and services covering an entire cross-section of India's entertainment industry. ABCL's operations were mainstream commercial film production and distribution, audio cassettes and video discs, production and marketing of television software, and celebrity and event management.[78] Soon after the company was launched in 1996, the first film it produced was _Tere Mere Sapne,_ which was a moderate success and launched the careers of actors like Arshad Warsi and southern film star Simran.

In 1997, Bachchan attempted to make his acting comeback with the film _Mrityudata_, produced by ABCL. Though _Mrityudaata_ attempted to reprise Bachchan's earlier success as an action hero, the film was a failure both financially and critically.[79] ABCL was the main sponsor of the _1996 Miss World beauty pageant_, Bangalore, but lost millions. The fiasco and the consequent legal battles surrounding ABCL and various entities after the event, coupled with the fact that ABCL was reported to have overpaid most of its top-level managers, eventually led to its financial and operational collapse in 1997.[80][81] The company went into administration and was later declared a failed company by the Indian Industries board. The Bombay high court, in April 1999, restrained Bachchan from selling off his Bombay bungalow 'Prateeksha' and two flats till the pending loan recovery cases of Canara Bank were disposed of. Bachchan had, however, pleaded that he had mortgaged his bungalow to raise funds for his company.[82]

Bachchan attempted to revive his acting career, and eventually had commercial success with _Bade Miyan Chote Miyan_ (1998) and _Major Saab_ (1998),[83] and received positive reviews for _Sooryavansham_ (1999),[84] but other films such as _Lal Baadshah_ (1999) and _Hindustan Ki Kasam_ (1999) were box office failures.

Return to prominence (2000–present)

Bachan_mohanlal.jpg]] In 2000, Amitabh Bachchan appeared in Yash Chopra's box-office hit, _Mohabbatein_, directed by Aditya Chopra. He played a stern, elder figure who rivalled the character of Shahrukh Khan. His role won him his third Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award. Other hits followed, with Bachchan appearing as an older family patriarch in _Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love_ (2001), _Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..._ (2001) and _Baghban_ (2003). As an actor, he continued to perform in a range of characters, receiving critical praise for his performances in _Aks_ (2001), _Aankhen_ (2002), _Kaante_ (2002), _Khakee_ (2004) and _Dev_ (2004). His performance in _Aks_ won him his first Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor.

One project that did particularly well for Bachchan was Sanjay Leela Bhansali's _Black_ (2005). The film starred Bachchan as an aging teacher of a deaf-blind girl and followed their relationship. His performance was unanimously praised by critics and audiences and won him his second National Film Award for Best Actor, his fourth Filmfare Best Actor Award and his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. Taking advantage of this resurgence, Amitabh began endorsing a variety of products and services, appearing in many television and billboard advertisements. In 2005 and 2006, he starred with his son Abhishek in the films _Bunty Aur Babli_ (2005), the _Godfather_ tribute _Sarkar_ (2005), and _Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna_ (2006). All of them were successful at the box office.[85][86] His later releases in 2006 and early 2007 were _Baabul_ (2006),[87] _Ekalavya_ and _Nishabd_ (2007), which failed to do well at the box office but his performances in each of them were praised by critics.[88]

In May 2007, two of his films: the romantic comedy _Cheeni Kum_ and the multi-starrer action drama _Shootout at Lokhandwala_ were released. _Shootout at Lokhandwala_ did well at the box office and was declared a hit in India, while _Cheeni Kum_ picked up after a slow start and was a success.[89][90][91][92] A remake of his biggest hit, _Sholay_ (1975), entitled _Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag_, released in August of that same year and proved to be a major commercial failure in addition to its poor critical reception.[93] The year also marked Bachchan's first appearance in an English-language film, Rituparno Ghosh's _The Last Lear_, co-starring Arjun Rampal and Preity Zinta. The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival on 9 September 2007. He received positive reviews from critics who hailed his performance as his best ever since _Black_.[94] Bachchan was slated to play a supporting role in his first international film, _Shantaram_, directed by Mira Nair and starring Hollywood actor Johnny Depp in the lead. The film was due to begin filming in February 2008 but due to the writer's strike, was pushed to September 2008.[95] The film is currently "shelved" indefinitely.[96]

Vivek Sharma's _Bhoothnath_, in which he plays the title role as a ghost, was released on 9 May 2008. _Sarkar Raj_, the sequel of the 2005 film _Sarkar_, released in June 2008 and received a positive response at the box office. _Paa_, which released at the end of 2009 was a highly anticipated project as it saw him playing his own son Abhishek's Progeria-affected 13-year-old son, and it opened to favourable reviews, particularly towards Bachchan's performance and was one of the top-grossing films of 2009.[97] It won him his third National Film Award for Best Actor and fifth Filmfare Best Actor Award. In 2010, he debuted in Malayalam film through _Kandahar_, directed by Major Ravi and co-starring Mohanlal.[98] The film was based on the hijacking incident of the Indian Airlines Flight 814.[99] Bachchan declined any remuneration for this film.[100]

In 2013 he made his Hollywood debut in _The Great Gatsby_ making a special appearance opposite Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire. In 2014, he played the role of the friendly ghost in the sequel _Bhoothnath Returns_. The next year, he played the role of a grumpy father suffering from chronic constipation in the critically acclaimed _Piku_ which was also one of the biggest hits of 2015.[101][102][103] A review in _Daily News and Analysis_ (DNA) summarized Bachchan's performance as "The heart and soul of Piku clearly belong to Amitabh Bachchan who is in his elements. His performance in Piku, without doubt, finds a place among the top 10 in his illustrious career."[104] Rachel Saltz wrote for The New York Times, "“Piku,” an offbeat Hindi comedy, would have you contemplate the intestines and mortality of one Bhashkor Banerji and the actor who plays him, Amitabh Bachchan. Bhashkor's life and conversation may revolve around his constipation and fussy hypochondria, but there's no mistaking the scene-stealing energy that Mr. Bachchan, India's erstwhile Angry Young Man, musters for his new role of Cranky Old Man."[105] Well known Indian critic Rajeev Masand wrote on his website, "Bachchan is pretty terrific as Bhashkor, who reminds you of that oddball uncle that you nevertheless have a soft spot for. He bickers with the maids, harrows his hapless helper, and expects that Piku stay unmarried so she can attend to him. At one point, to ward off a possible suitor, he casually mentions that his daughter isn’t a virgin; that she’s financially independent and sexually independent too. Bachchan embraces the character’s many idiosyncrasies, never once slipping into caricature while all along delivering big laughs thanks to his spot-on comic timing.[106] _The Guardian_ summed up, "Bachchan seizes upon his cranky character part, making Bashkor as garrulously funny in his theories on caste and marriage as his system is backed-up."[107] The performance won Bachchan his fourth National Film Award for Best Actor and his third Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor.

In 2016, he appeared in the women centric courtroom drama film _Pink_ which was highly praised by critics and with an increasingly good word of mouth, was a resounding success at the domestic and overseas box office.[108][109][110][111][112] Bachchan's performance in the film received acclaim. According to Raja Sen of Rediff.com, "Amitabh Bachchan, a retired lawyer suffering from bipolar disorder, takes up cudgels on behalf of the girls, delivering courtroom blows with pugilistic grace. Like we know from Prakash Mehra movies, into each life some Bachchan must fall. The girls hang on to him with incredulous desperation, and he bats for them with all he has. At one point Meenal hangs by Bachchan's elbow, words entirely unnecessary. Bachchan towers through Pink – the way he bellows "et cetera" is alone worth having the heavy-hitter at play—but there are softer moments like one where he appears to have dozed off in court, or where he lays his head by his convalescent wife's bedside and needs his hair ruffled and his conviction validated."[113] Writing for Hindustan Times, noted film critic and author Anupama Chopra said of Bachchan's performance, "A special salute to Amitabh Bachchan, who imbues his character with a tragic majesty. Bachchan towers in every sense, but without a hint of showboating.[114] Meena Iyer of The Times of India wrote, "The performances are pitch-perfect with Bachchan leading the way.[115] Writing for NDTV, Troy Ribeiro of Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) stated, 'Amitabh Bachchan as Deepak Sehgall, the aged defence lawyer, shines as always, in a restrained, but powerful performance. His histrionics come primarily in the form of his well-modulated baritone, conveying his emotions and of course, from the well-written lines.'[116] Mike McCahill of The Guardian remarked, "Among an electric ensemble, Tapsee Pannu, Kirti Kulhari and Andrea Tariang give unwavering voice to the girls’ struggles; Amitabh Bachchan brings his moral authority to bear as their sole legal ally.[117]

In 2017, he appeared in the third installment of the Sarkar film series: Ram Gopal Varma's _Sarkar 3_. That year, he started filming for the swashbuckling action adventure film _Thugs Of Hindostan_ with Aamir Khan, Katrina Kaif and Fatima Sana Shaikh which released in November 2018.[118] He co-starred with Rishi Kapoor in _102 Not Out_, a comedy-drama film directed by Umesh Shukla based on a Gujarati play of the same name written by Saumya Joshi.[119][120][121] This film released in May 2018 and reunited him with Kapoor onscreen after a gap of twenty-seven years. In October 2017, it was announced that Bachchan will appear in Ayan Mukerji's _Brahmastra_, alongside Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt.[122]


Other work

Politics

In 1984, Bachchan took a break from acting and briefly entered politics in support of a long-time family friend, Rajiv Gandhi. He contested Allahabad's seat for the 8th Lok Sabha against H. N. Bahuguna, former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and won by one of the highest victory margins in general election history (68.2% of the vote).[123] His political career, however, was short-lived: he resigned after three years, calling politics a cesspool. The resignation followed the implication of Bachchan and his brother in the "Bofors scandal" by a newspaper, which he vowed to take to court.[124] Bachchan was eventually found not guilty of involvement in the ordeal. He was framed in the scam and falsely alleged. This was cleared by Swedish police chief Sten Lindstrom.[125]

His old friend, Amar Singh, helped him during the financial crisis caused by the failure of his company, ABCL. Thereafter Bachchan started supporting the Samajwadi Party, the political party to which Amar Singh belonged. Furthermore, Jaya Bachchan joined the Samajwadi party and represented the party as an MP in the Rajya Sabha.[126] Bachchan has continued to do favours for the Samajwadi party, including appearing in advertisements and political campaigns. These activities have recently got him into trouble in the Indian courts for false claims after a previous incident of submission of legal papers by him, stating that he is a farmer.[127]

A 15-year press ban against Bachchan was imposed during his peak acting years by _Stardust_ and some of the other film magazines. In defence, Bachchan claimed to have banned the press from entering his sets until late 1989.[128]

Bachchan has been accused of using the slogan "blood for blood" in the context of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Bachchan has denied the allegation.[129] In October 2014, Bachchan was summoned by a court in Los Angeles for "allegedly instigating violence against the Sikh community".[130][131][132][133]
