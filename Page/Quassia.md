_QUASSIA_ ( or ) is a plant genus in the family Simaroubaceae. Its size is disputed; some botanists treat it as consisting of only one species, _Quassia amara_ from tropical South America, while others treat it in a wide circumscription as a pantropical genus containing up to 40 species of trees and shrubs. The genus was named after a former slave from Suriname, Graman Quassi in the eighteenth century. He discovered the medicinal properties of the bark of _Quassia amara_.

Broader treatments of the genus include the following and other species:

-   _Quassia africana_
-   _Quassia amara_
-   _Quassia arnhemensis_ – Australia
-   _Quassia bidwillii_
-   _Quassia indica_
-   _Quassia_ sp. 'Moonee Creek' – Australia
-   _Quassia_ sp. 'Mount Nardi' – Australia
-   _Quassia sanguinea_
-   _Quassia silvestris_
-   _Quassia undulata_

It is the source of the quassinoids quassin and neo-quassin.[1]
