Munmorah_Sand_Dunes_in_2017.jpg Munmorah Sand Dune site have been in Northern Lake Munmorah for nearly a century now. The eight sand-dunes were formed during a huge sandstorm in 1942, covering vast amounts of bush. In 1942, reports came across the radios stating a sand storm from nearby Birdie Beach would pick up a great amount of sand and would send it flying for a couple of kilometers. Nowadays, all the sand from the storm sits in its location and name today, making one of the biggest sand-dune sights in the Central Coast. These sand-dunes are 74 years old (in 2016) and they have been sitting in an end of town not many people would think to come to.


1942 Sand-Storm Deaths

Aboriginals and the homeless were in these bushes, where their homes were. They were not aware about the storm, and most people were covered by these dunes. About 11 people passed away, with 1 surviving. Layout_Of_Site.jpg


Names for Dunes

The nearby Aboriginals had names for these dunes, years after the storm in '42.
