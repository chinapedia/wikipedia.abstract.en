History

The North Miami Library was created in 1932 in City Hall of the town of North Miami, Florida by the Biscayne Park Woman's Club. The library was directed under the supervision of E. May Avil, who served 37 years as City Clerk for North Miami, Florida. The library was mostly funded through donation and membership fees. In 1948 the Biscayne Park Woman's Club transferred the library under the authority of the town of North Miami, and in 1949 the library became a free public library funded and administered under the Florida Statutes. Mrs. Edla Lunden and Mrs. Alma Anderson were appointed Librarian and Librarian Assistant. The North Miami town council transferred its property to the library in 1952.

The library’s first professional librarian was Miss Phyllis Gray, who served from 1955-1959. Succeeding Miss Gray was Mrs. Julia Wanner who completed an addition of the building that doubled it in size in 1964. The library operated a branch on the west side of the city from 1957-1967. In 1970 the city council renamed the library as the E. May Avil North Miami Public Library. In 1978 Mrs. Gloria Zavish succeeded Mrs. Wanner and became the director of the library. The library continued to expand with the construction and furnishing of a $1.3 million addition completed in early 1991.
