History

The territory of present-day Huangshi was largely reclaimed from tidal marshes through land reclamation efforts begun during the late Tang and continuing til the mid-Ming, a period stretching from the 9th to the 16th centuries.[3] Huangshi proper was a market town by the time of the Ming.[4]

Religion

The village of Qiaodou, known as Ninghai during the Song and Ming,[6] is the site of the earliest-attested temple to the Chinese sea goddess Mazu, the deified form of the 10th-century shamaness Lin Moniang.[7] Supposedly, Lin was born on nearby Meizhou Island, usually regarded as the cradle of her cult, but she probably spent her adult life on the mainland.[8]

At present, Shuinan's Tianhou Palace () is Huangshi's main temple. It was first constructed during the Hongwu Era of the Ming. It was rebuilt and adapted for use as Shuinan's guildhall () in 1795. The town holds religious processions every year on the 15th day of the first month of the Chinese lunar calendar and during the intercalary month of each year which has one.[9] The main temple in the Qiaodou area is its Jiucha Temple () honoring the Great God of Jiucha (). Its religious processions occur on the second and third days of the second lunar month.[10]


Transportation

The S201 highway connects central Huangshi to Hanjiang to the north and Xiuyu to the south. The G15 Expressway is nearby.
