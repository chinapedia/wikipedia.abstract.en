RAVEN SOFTWARE (or RAVEN ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE, INC.) is an American video game developer based in Wisconsin and founded in 1990. In 1997, Raven made an exclusive publishing deal with Activision and was subsequently acquired by them. After the acquisition, many of the studio's original developers, largely responsible for creating the _Heretic_ and _Hexen: Beyond Heretic_ games, left to form Human Head Studios.


History

Raven Software was founded in 1990 by brothers Brian and Steve Raffel. The company was independent until 1997 when it was acquired by Activision.

Raven has a history of working with id Software, who were briefly located on the same street.[1] They used id's engines for many of their games, such as _Heretic_ in 1994. They took over development of id's _Quake_ franchise for _Quake 4_ and the 2009 iteration of id's _Wolfenstein_ series.[2]

The company started with three development teams. In August 2009 following poor performance and possible over-budget of _Wolfenstein,_[3][4] the company made a major layoff of 30-35 staff, leaving two development teams. This was reduced to one after more layoffs in October 2010, after delays with _Singularity;_ as many as 40 staff were released. Following the layoffs, Raven has been focused on assisting with the Call of Duty series ever since.[5][6][7]


Games

In 2012, Raven began hiring employees for a game,[8] and were announced as collaborating with Infinity Ward on _Call of Duty: Ghosts_ in May 2013.[9]

On April 3, 2013 following the closure of LucasArts, Raven Software released the source code for _Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast_ and _Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy_ on Sourceforge.[10]

As of April 2014, the company is the lead developer of the free-to-play Chinese _Call of Duty_ title, _Call of Duty: Online_.[11] The company also remastered _Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,_ titled _Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered_.[12]
