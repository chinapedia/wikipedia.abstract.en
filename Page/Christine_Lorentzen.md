CHRISTINE GYRSTING LORENTZEN (born January 13, 1979), also known as LORE, is a Danish singer-songwriter, project manager and former television presenter, best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band Cryoshell. Prior to joining the band, she competed in _Scenen er din_ and later co-presented the third series of _Vild med dans_ with Claus Elming.


Career and education

Prior to and during her college education, Lorentzen freelanced as a model and recorded music in Los Angeles for various advertising agencies. She studied Project Management in Advertising at Den Danske Reklameskole (The Danish Advertising School) in 2004 and went on to study various project management-related courses at Roskilde University between 2005 and 2010. She managed her time as a student while working at Advance, a creative advertising agency based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Starting in 2000 as a receptionist, she rose through the company's ranks before leaving in 2010 with project manager experience.

After competing in the game show _Scenen er din_, Lorentzen replaced Andrea Elisabeth Rudolph as co-presenter in the third season of talent show _Vild med dans_ with Claus Elming, however, both Lorentzen and Elming received negative criticism.[1][2] She did not return for the show's fourth season and was replaced by her predecessor, Rudolph.

In late 2006, Lorentzen was offered the opportunity to provide vocals for the song "Creeping in My Soul" after auditioning for the part. Composed with Mikkel Maltha and Kasper Søderlund, the track was utilized in the promotional campaign for the _Barraki_ wave of Lego Bionicle toys in 2007, and went on to become a popular MP3 download from the official Lego website. The song's success prompted Lego to produce further musical scores for later Bionicle campaigns, and by 2008, Lorentzen, Maltha and Søderlund released "Closer to the Truth", used to promote the Bionicle _Mistika_ wave, under the band name Cryoshell.

Cryoshell spent the majority of 2009 recording their self-titled debut album. Released on June 7, 2010, it garnered critical success and sprawled the singles "Bye Bye Babylon" and "Creeping in My Soul" (a re-recording of the original). Lorentzen took maternity leave from the band between November 2011–October 2013 and was temporarily replaced by Tine Midtgaard. Upon her return, the group began plans to record their sophomore effort, _Next to Machines_. Prior to and during recording of the album, Lorentzen freelanced as a project manager specializing in marketing and advertizing for the companies Robert/Boisen & Like-Minded, FC Nordsjælland and Patchwork Group.


Personal life

Lorenzten was born in Denmark and currently resides in Farum with her partner and daughter, born in 2011. Prior to her pregnancy, she lived in Copenhagen. As well as being a native Danish speaker, she is fluent in English, French, German and Swedish.
