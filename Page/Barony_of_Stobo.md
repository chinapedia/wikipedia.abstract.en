STOBO is a title in the Baronage of Scotland which takes its name from Stobo in the Scottish Borders.

The barony has played an important role in Scottish history for almost five centuries. It was closely associated with the rise and fall of Stuart power in Scotland, its granting or forfeiture being used by turns to reward or punish those loyal to the House of Stuart.[1]


Origins

The origins of the barony lie in the twelfth century; there being records of a de Stobhou family as early as 1174.[2]

By the fourteenth century, the barony had come into the possession of the bishopric of Glasgow.

Since the creation of today’s barony in 1577, there has been a succession of thirty Barons of Stobo; the first of these being James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton,[3] one of the four Regents of Scotland during the minority of King James VI, later James I of England.[4]

Morton's possession of the barony was short-lived. He was executed in 1581 for his part in the murder of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, King Consort to Mary, Queen of Scots.[5]

The barony was re-granted in 1587 to Sir John Maitland, Lord Chancellor of Scotland, who in 1590 became 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane[6] in recognition of his role in arranging the King's marriage to Anne of Denmark.[7] Maitland is generally considered the principal architect of Stuart rule during this period.[8]


History

Over the following century, ownership of the barony alternated between two competing sets of Stuart supporters: Maitland's descendants, the powerful Earls of Lauderdale,[9] chiefs of Clan Maitland and hereditary bearers of the National Flag of Scotland[10] and the Dukes of Lennox and Richmond,[11] chiefs of the Clan Stewart of Darnley and favoured kinsmen of James I, Charles I and Charles II.[12][13]

In the wake of the Glorious Revolution, the barony passed to another family of staunch Stuart supporters, the Murrays of Stanhope; at which point in 1697 it was erected into a free barony by Crown Charter.[14]

The Murrays, wealthy baronets, were ruined by their support for the Jacobite cause, with Sir David Murray, 4th baronet, forfeiting both land and title for his role in the 1745 Rebellion, alongside many other prominent lowland Scots families.[15] Murray died in exile in 1770.[16][17]


Forfeiture

In 1767, Stobo was purchased out of forfeiture for £40,000, along with the baronetcy of Stanhope, by James Montgomery, Lord Advocate of Scotland, later Sir James Montgomery, 1st baronet.

In 1767, Montgomery also acquired a substantial and highly lucrative interest in the colonisation of Canada's Prince Edward Island;[18] an investment which funded his son, the 2nd baronet to build Stobo Castle between 1805-11 in place of an earlier fortified tower house.

The barony of Stobo remained in the possession of the Graham-Montgomery family until 1905[19] and then, in the possession of the Earls of Dysart until 1972.[20][21]


The seat of barony and its extent

The seat (“caput”) of the barony is Stobo Castle. The listed castle and its grounds have operated as a luxury spa hotel since the mid-1970s.[22]

The barony is situated in historic Peeblesshire, north of the River Tweed, and according to Bearhop's map of 1740, encompasses the lands of Stobo, West Dawyck, Easttoun and Westtoun, Dreva, and Muirburn.[23]
