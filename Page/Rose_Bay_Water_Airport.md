ROSE BAY WATER AIRPORT (IATA: RSE) is an Australian water airport located in the Sydney suburb of Rose Bay, New South Wales. The airport is 8 kilometres (5 miles) from Sydney's central business district. It is one of two water airports serving Sydney, with the other one being Palm Beach Water Airport. The only carriers servicing the water aerodrome are Sydney Seaplanes,[1] Sydney by Seaplane[2] and Seawing Airways,[3] all of which are based at Rose Bay.


History

On 4 August 1938, Rose Bay Water Airport was officially opened.[4] However, it already had been established as a flying boat base on a 'temporary basis', and was the starting point for the London-Sydney flights that were operated by Qantas Empire Airways and Imperial Airways in a codeshare agreement.[5] This made it Australia's first international airport. In 1942, due to the outbreak of WWII, commercial flights were suspended.[6] Due to the arrival of passenger jetliners in the 1950s, a gradual demise in flying boats begun. In 1955, Qantas discontinued its flying boat service and sold its fleet of flying boats to Ansett Airways.[7] Ansett continued to operate flying boat services from Rose Bay Water Airport to Lord Howe island until that was discontinued in 1974.[8]
