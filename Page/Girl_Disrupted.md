Background and promotion

On March 9, 2015, the albums title was announced as _On the Verge_ via Streeter's Instagram account, "ON THE VERGE the moment before something great happens… you can feel it! This album is my "something great". My thoughts, desires, fears, tears, emotional ups, downs, good times, drunken nights and unforgettable memories all rolled up into on body of work."[5][6] On November 29, 2016, Streeter announced a preliminary release date and the title for _Girl Disrupted_, scheduled to be January 27, 2017.[7] The title is a reference and a nod to the 1999 psychological drama film _Girl, Interrupted_ with, as Streeter says, "this crazy industry" as a stand-in for the bizarre cast of characters at the movie's mental hospital:[8] "I love that movie and always watch it in bed. But one night, for some reason, the story connected to me in a different way. It was like, ‘God, that's me and this crazy music industry.’ I'm not interrupted — just ‘disrupted.’"[9]

On January 19, 2017, in an interview with Hip Hop Weekly, she revealed the collaborations on the album: "I have a record with August Alsina called 'Been A Minute,' I have a record with Ty Dolla $ign called 'Fallen,' I have a record with Dave East, I got a record with Jeremih, and I got a couple of more surprises imma keep in my back pocket."[10] On June 7, 2017, Streeter announced the release date of the album along with the artwork via her Instagram account.[11] The following day the track listing was announced.[12][13][14]
