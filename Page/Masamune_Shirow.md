is the fixed pen name[1] of Japanese manga artist MASANORI OTA. The pen name is derived from the legendary sword-smith Masamune. Shirow is best known for the manga _Ghost in the Shell_, which has since been turned into three theatrical anime movies, two anime television series, an anime television movie, an anime OVA series, a theatrical live action movie, and several video games. Shirow is also known for creating erotic art.


Life and career

Born in the Hyōgo Prefecture capital city of Kobe, he studied oil painting at Osaka University of Arts. While in college, he developed an interest in manga, which led him to create his own complete work, _Black Magic_, which was published in the manga dōjinshi _Atlas_. His work caught the eye of Seishinsha President Harumichi Aoki, who offered to publish him.

The result was best-selling[2] manga _Appleseed_, a full volume of densely plotted drama taking place in an ambiguous future. The story was a sensation, and won the 1986 Seiun Award for Best Manga. After a professional reprint of _Black Magic_ and a second volume of _Appleseed_, he released _Dominion_ in 1986. Two more volumes of _Appleseed_ followed before he began work on _Ghost in the Shell_.

In 2007, he collaborated again with Production I.G to co-create the original concept for the anime television series _Shinreigari/Ghost Hound_, Production I.G's 20th anniversary project. A further original collaboration with Production I.G began airing in April 2008, titled _Real Drive_.

Galgrease

_Galgrease_ (published in _Uppers Magazine_, 2002) is the collected name of several erotic manga and poster books by Shirow. The name comes from the fact that the women depicted often look "greased".

The first series of _Galgrease_ booklets included four issues each in the following settings:

-   _Wild Wet West_ (Wild West-themed)
-   _Hellhound_ (Horror-themed)
-   _Galhound_ (Near-future science fiction–themed)

The second series included another run of 12 booklets in the following worlds:

-   _Wild Wet Quest_ (A _Tomb Raider_ or _Indiana Jones_–style sequel to _Wild Wet West_)
-   _Hellcat_ (Pirate-themed)
-   _Galhound 2_ (Near-future science fiction–themed)

After each regular series, there were one or more bonus poster books that revisited the existing characters and settings.
