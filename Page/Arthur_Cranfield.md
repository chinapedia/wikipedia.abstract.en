ARTHUR LESLIE CRANFIELD (19 June 1892 â€“ 9 October 1957) was a British newspaper editor.

Born in St Ives, then in Huntingdonshire, Cranfield attended St Ives Grammar School. During World War I, he served in the Essex Regiment as a captain and a brigade signalling officer. After the war, he became a journalist, working on a variety of local papers before, in 1922, becoming chief sub-editor for the _Evening News_.[1]

In 1926, Cranfield was appointed as the first editor-in-chief of the Press Association. Two years later, he returned to the _Evening News_ as assistant editor, then held the same post at the _Daily Mail_ from 1930 to 1935, when he was chosen as the paper's editor. In 1939, he instead became managing editor of the _Evening Standard_, then in 1941 moved to become editor of _The Star_.[2]

Cranfield retired in 1957, and died later in the year.[3]
