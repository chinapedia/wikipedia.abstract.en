MOSSVILLE ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION NOW has worked since the 1980s as environmental justice advocates to address the industrial toxins that pollute their community, Mossville, Louisiana.[1] The organization is significant for its role in advocating for people affected by pollution.[2]

MEAN became incorporated as non-profit, tax-exempt organization in the state of Louisiana in 1999.[3] In 2005, MEAN became party to a petition before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights seeking to hold the United States government accountable for violation of Mossville residentsâ€™ human rights.[4] Mossville Environmental Action Now is one of the first environmental justice organizations to bring the US government before an international human rights body on charges of violating a community's right to a clean environment and environmental racism.[5]
