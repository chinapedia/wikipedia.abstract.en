_BIKINI RED_ is the third release by The Screaming Blue Messiahs and the follow up to _Gun-Shy_. The album, which was notable for being one of the last recordings by renowned producer Vic Maile, well known for his work with Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Eric Clapton. _Bikini Red_ was also one of two albums by The Screaming Blue Messiahs (along with _Gun-Shy_) that brought them to the attention of David Bowie and that led to him promoting the band:[1] "Well! The band this week – I've only just discovered them, so they're my pet project – is The Screaming Blue Messiahs. They're the best band I've heard out of England in a long time" (_Musician_ magazine, August 1987) and "There’s an English band I like very much. Nobody seems to have heard of them. They’re called The Screaming Blue Messiahs and I’m pushing them like mad." (_Words And Music_ magazine, January 1988), and when asked by Rolling Stone magazine in 1987 who is favorite band were, Bowie replied, "The Screaming Blue Messiahs. I love them. I think they're terrific."[2]


Reviews

The album has a 4.5/5 star rating on All Music. John Duggan wrote: "The Messiahs' follow-up to Gun-Shy was this devastating hunk of noise, which didn't pull any punches when it came to raw emotion and intensity. Side One, especially, is a rave-up from the gut-bustin' raunch of 'Sweet Water Pools' to the closer 'Big Brother Muscle.' As always, Carter's obsessions are a little hard to understand, but the images and lyric fragments fly at you like shards of broken glass; you'll remember when they hit you. 'I Wanna Be a Flintstone' kicks off Side Two, and it remains as funky and funny as it was the first time you hear it. Great production work by Vic Maile";[3] and "The sophomore disc, _Bikini Red_, was even better. Packing a ferocious wallop accentuated by the production of famed English producer Vic Maile (Dr. Feelgood, Motörhead), and the goofy_I Wanna Be a Flintstone_."[4]


Singles

"Bikini Red" and "I Can Speak American" were both released as singles in 1987. January 1988 saw the release of "I Wanna Be A Flintstone" (a reworked song from an album by an earlier band of Carter's, Motor Boys Motor) as a single. The record became an instant hit, peaking at number 28 in the UK charts.[5] The song's success saw the band appearing on the BBC's Top of the Pops and Saturday morning kids' show _No. 73_. Two videos were made for the song, both making use of cartoon clips from the _Flintstones_ TV series. The single appeared in multiple formats, including picture discs and extended 12" remix versions.
