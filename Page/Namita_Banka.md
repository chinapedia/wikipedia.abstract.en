Education

Namita is a science graduate from Delhi University, with a post graduate degree in metal designing, she also worked at jewellery designing and manufacturing for eight years in Surat, Gujarat.[1][2][3] Namita began her career as a jewelry designer in Surat in 1999.[4][5] While working with fine jewels impressed her, she did not feel fulfilled by the work.[6]


Social entrepreneurship

After her husband was transferred to Hyderabad in 2008, Namita began a complete career path change because the city had fewer prohibitions and more opportunities. She enrolled in a course on social entrepreneurship and tried her hand at selling ink cartridges and green office supplies, tendering to Indian Railways.[7][8][9][10] This initial social enterprise failed.[11] The following year, through her contacts, she learnt about one of their big problems facing both rail roads and Indians living in rural areas: sanitation.[12][13][14][15] At the time, she was also working on organizing a women's fair in Hyderabad.[16]

In 2009, Banka joined a course in NGO management, after which she started her own company which initially worked as a service agent for Vibhu Composite Works and Aikon Technologies, original equipment manufactures of controlled discharge toilets.[17] In 2012, Banka set up Banka BioLoo.[18] That year, Banka won a `1.2 crore annual toilet maintenance contract on certain East Coast Railways lines.[19] Early customers contracted her company to build and maintain toilets in a variety of locations including schools, private residences, construction sites, and plantations.[20]

Banka BioLoo is environmentally friendly and sustainable solutions for sanitation. Banka BioLoo uses bio-digester technology.[21] The toilets were installed on the Gomti Express from Lucknow to Delhi in 2014.[22] Clients for installation and maintenance in 2015 included Indian Railways, Integral Coach Factory, Larsen & Toubro, International Paper and the Andhra Pradesh government.[23][24] That year, the company saw a 70% increase in revenue.[25] By 2017, the company was doing business in 20 Indian states and had yearly growth of 50 to 60%.[26] According to Banka, she has been unable to identify a lower cost solution to the problem her product solves.[27] While the technology is officially gender neutral, one of the primary benefactors of her product has been women as it allows them to preserver their dignity in public spaces.[28]

Banka started looking towards other technologies in 2015, including how to better use biogas.[29]

Despite being a woman in a traditionally male dominated space, Banka told _The Guardian_ that she does not feel she has been disadvantaged. The inclusiveness of her product has won her favor from a number of groups. At the same time, she has received a lot of support from Indian economic forums because her work supports women's welfare.[30] At the same time, she has acknowledged that being a woman in India can be very difficult.[31] She has also said that guilt can be one of the biggest things holding back women entrenepenuers.[32]


Philanthropy

Recognizing the need to assist female children, Banka began philanthropic efforts shortly after setting up Banka BioLoo.[33] One of her programs is called “Gift a Loo”, which facilitates others donating toilets to schools, villages and public spaces that can be used by girls and others to enable them to leave the house more often.[34]


Awards and recognition

Banka BioLoo won the coveted Sankalp Award for social enterprises at the Sankalp Unconvention Summit 2013 in Mumbai.[35] Banka is a 2013 laureate of the Cartier Women's Initiative Awards.[36][37][38]
