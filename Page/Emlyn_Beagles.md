The EMLYN BEAGLES is a Welsh beagle pack founded in 1966.


History

The Hunt was founded in 1966 by three sportsmen, a café owner, butcher and agricultural salesman, living in Newcastle Emlyn.[1] Initially the hounds were kept in a banana container behind the café with sufficient food sourced from the café and butcher shop.[2]

Traditionally the Emlyn Beagles was a hare hunting pack, since the Hunting Act 2004 they have made use of the exemptions for trail and rabbit hunting.[3]


Hunt country

The Hunt's country ranges from Ffair Rhos in Ceredigion to St Clears in Carmarthenshire, encompassing the Cambrian Mountains, Tregaron Bog, the Tywi valley and upland pasture around Newcastle Emlyn.[4]

The Hunt's country is principally mountain and moorland, with some more cultivated areas around Newcastle Emlyn and Cilycwm.[5] The best centres are around Llanddewi Brefi and Tregaron to the north, and Cwrt-y-Cadno and Cilycwm to the south.[6]
