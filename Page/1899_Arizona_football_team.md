The 1899 ARIZONA FOOTBALL TEAM was an American football team that represented the University of Arizona as an independent during the 1899 college football season. In its first season of football, the team compiled a 1–1–1 record and outscored all opponents, 24 to 16.[1] The team was organized in January 1899 by Professor R. H. Forbes, but no games were played until the fall when a student committee raised $70 from merchants in the Old Pueblo to purchase uniforms.[2] Stuart Forbes was the team's coach, George M. Parker was the manager and team captain.[3][4][5] The team's colors during the 1899 season were sage green and silver.[6][7]
