Criticism

When Pimenova's mother managed her social media accounts, there was some criticism of the content as an example of sexualisation of an under-age model.[18][19] The mother disagreed, maintaining that all the photos were perfectly innocent and "you must think like a pedophile in order to see something sexual in these pictures".[20]
