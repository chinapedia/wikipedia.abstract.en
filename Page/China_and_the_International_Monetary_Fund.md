In 1945, CHINA COFOUNDED THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (IMF) with 34 other nations. In April 1980, the People’s Republic of China, established a formal relationship with the IMF. The Chinese-IMF relationship mainly operates around affairs associated with IMF governance and the IMF Special Drawing Rights (SDR).[1][2]


China and IMF governance

China has been trying to expand its political and decision-making power within the IMF. The IMF's voting system weights each country's vote based on the amount of that country's monetary contribution to the Fund. China has been trying to raise its quota. In May 1980, the Chinese government appealed to adjust its IMF quota. With approval from the IMF board, the quota of China was increased from 1.2 billion SDRs to 1.8 billion SDRs. China also obtained a single-country seat on the IMF executive board, which expanded the number of IMF directors to 22 members. As of 2017 the quota of China in the IMF was 30.5 billion SDRs, giving it 6.09% of the total vote.[3]

To further rebalance power in the IMF, China appealed for changes that would transfer voting power to developing economies.[4] In 2010, the Chinese executive director of the Fund, Zhou Xiaochuan, addressed the board and asserted that giving more power to the emerging economies was critical for the group's legitimacy, accountability and long-term health.[5]

China cooperated with other developing countries to advance its rebalancing project. China cooperated with the BRICS, a coalition of the nations of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. With a larger combined voting share and voice, the BRICS has been more effective at renegotiating IMF governance.[6]


China and IMF SDR

On October 1, 2016, the Chinese Yuan officially joined the SDR basket and became a foreign exchange reserve currency of the IMF, along with U.S. Dollar, British Pound, Euro and Japanese Yen.[7]

The IMF conducts a quarterly survey called COFER, or the Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves. This survey collects information on member states’ foreign exchange reserves. With the recent inclusion of the Chinese Yuan, the currency varieties in the 4th quarter of 2016 COFER report includes the U.S. Dollar, the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the British Pound, the Swiss Franc, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, and the Chinese Yuan. For the five SDR reserved currencies, their respective global foreign exchange reserve sums were as follows:

-   U.S. Dollar: 5,052.94 billion USD
-   Euro: 1,559.26 billion USD
-   Chinese Yuan: 84.51 billion USD
-   Japanese Yen: 332.77 billion USD
-   British Pound: 349.33 billion USD[8][9]

The currency composition of the SDR basket is reviewed every five years. The current weights for the component currencies are as follows:

-   U.S. Dollar: 41.73%
-   Euro: 30.93%
-   Chinese Yuan: 10.92%
-   Japanese Yen: 8.33%
-   British Pound: 8.09%[10]

The current value of SDR is determined by these five SDR reserved currencies and equals the sum of the following currency values:

-   U.S. Dollar: 0.58252
-   Euro: 0.38671
-   Chinese Yuan: 1.0174
-   Japanese Yen: 11.900
-   British Pound: 0.085946[11]
