Bandai_Entertainment_Company.png is a Japanese video game development company. The company in its current form is a result of a merger between Bandai Entertainment Company and Banpresto video game assets, by their parent company, Bandai Namco Entertainment.[1]

BEC (Bandai Entertainment Company), formerly known as Interbec, was a joint venture by Bandai and Human Co, Ltd. for video game development. They were best known for developing licensed video games for Bandai including _Digimon_, _Dragon Ball Z_ and _Mobile Suit Gundam_.[2] Once Bandai and Namco merged as Bandai Namco, Bandai Entertainment Company became a video game development subsidiary for the merged company.

Before Bandai merged with Namco, both Banpresto and BEC were video game development subsidiaries for Bandai. On April 2011, Bandai Namco merged BEC with Banpresto in order to streamline and unify the Bandai gaming subsidiaries under one division.[3] whilst the Banpresto brand was re-established as a toy company as part of Bandai Namco's toys and hobby business.[4]
