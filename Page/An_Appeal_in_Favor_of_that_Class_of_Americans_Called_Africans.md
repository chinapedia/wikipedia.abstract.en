An_Appeal_in_Favor_of_that_Class_of_Americans_Called_Africans_p16.jpg _AN APPEAL IN FAVOR OF THAT CLASS OF AMERICANS CALLED AFRICANS_ is an 1833 book by American writer Lydia Maria Child in favor of the immediate emancipation of the slaves without compensation to slaveholders.[1][2][3]

It is the first book in support of this policy written by a white woman.[4][5][6] It was published by Allen & Ticknor in Boston, a predecessor to Ticknor and Fields, at the expense of the author.[7] She spent about three years researching and writing the book and often drew from William Lloyd Garrison's antislavery newspaper _The Liberator_ and likely David Walker's 1829 _Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World_.[8]

Child's argument includes a distrust of the growing political power of the Southern states which she perceived as a proslavery oligarchy. She addresses her concern in a chapter titled "Influence of Slavery on the Politics of the United States" and specifically uses the Missouri Compromise as an example.[9]
