, also known as or , was the 15th Emperor of Japan,[1] according to the traditional order of succession.[2]

No firm dates can be assigned to this Emperor's life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 270 to 310.[3]


Legendary narrative

Ōjin is regarded by historians as a "legendary Emperor" of the 5th century.[4] The reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571 AD), the 29th Emperor,[5] is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates;[6] however, the conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kanmu (737–806), the 50th sovereign of the Yamato dynasty.[7]

The name Ōjin Tennō was assigned to him posthumously by later generations. Ōjin is also identified by some as the earliest "historical" Emperor.[8]

According to the _Kojiki_ and the _Nihon Shoki_, Ōjin was the son of the Emperor Chūai and his consort Empress Jingū. As Chūai died before Ōjin's birth, his mother Empress Jingū became the de facto ruler. The history book written to the 8th century, alleged that the boy Ōjin was conceived but unborn when Chūai died. His widow, Empress Jingū, then spent three years in conquest of a promised land, which is conjectured to be Korea, but the story is largely dismissed by scholars for lack of evidence. Then, after her return to Japanese islands, the boy was born, three years after the death of the father.

Either a period of less than nine months contained three "years" (some seasons), e.g. three harvests, or the paternity is just mythical and symbolic, rather than real. Ōjin was born (in 200 according to the traditional) in Tsukushi Province upon the return of his mother from the invasion of the promised land, and was named Prince Hondawake. He became the crown prince at the age of four. He was crowned (in 270) at the age of 70 and reigned for 40 years until his death in 310, although none of the TC dates around his reign have any historical basis. He supposedly lived in two palaces, both of which are in present-day Osaka.

Ōjin was traditionally identified as the father of Emperor Nintoku, who acceded after Ōjin's death.[9] Ōjin has been deified as Hachiman Daimyōjin, regarded as the guardian of warriors. The Hata clan considered him their guardian Kami.

The actual site of Ōjin's grave is not known.[10] The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (_misasagi_) at Osaka.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Ōjin's mausoleum. It is formally named _Eega no Mofushi no oka no misasagi_.[11]
