'' PARORCHIS ACANTHUSI'' is a parasitic flatworm of the class Trematoda. It is a parasitic castrator of the common periwinkle _Littorina littorea_. The resulting decline in the numbers of that mollusc can lead to more ungrazed algae, with corresponding increases in invertebrate populations and a greater diversity of smaller _Littorina_ snails. The increased numbers of small prey items makes the affected rocky coasts more attractive to birds such as the purple sandpiper and Eurasian rock pipit.[1]
