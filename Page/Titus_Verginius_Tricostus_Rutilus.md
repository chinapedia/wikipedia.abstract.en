TITUS VERGINIUS TRICOSTUS RUTILUS was consul of the Roman republic in 479 BC.[1][2] He held the office with Caeso Fabius.

According to Livy, he was assigned the war with the Veientes, but because of his temerity his army was almost cut off, saved only by his colleague Fabius, marching from fighting the Aequi.[3]

His filiation suggests his father was Opiter Verginius Tricostus (consul in 502 BC) and that his brothers were Proculus Verginius Tricostus Rutilus (consul in 486 BC) and Aulus Verginius Tricostus Rutilus (consul in 476 BC), and possibly also Opiter Verginius Tricostus Esquilinus (suffect consul in 478 BC and possibly consul in 473 BC).
