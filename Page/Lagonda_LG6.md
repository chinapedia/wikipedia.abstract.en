Only one LG6, chassis number 12341, was sold into the Netherlands, to the architect Jan Frederik van Erven Dorens for 13,200 guilders in 1938.[5] After the Liberation of the Netherlands in 1945, it was used by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery for victory parades in Amsterdam. The car was not returned after the war but became part of Prince Bernhard's collection. In 2003, Erven Dorens' grandson Robin produced a film _Lagonda_ about the car.[6][7]
