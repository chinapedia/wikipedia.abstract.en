EDWARD ELMER SMITH (May 2, 1890 – August 31, 1965), better known by his pen name E. E. "DOC" SMITH, was an American food engineer (specializing in doughnut and pastry mixes) and science-fiction author, best known for the _Lensman_ and _Skylark_ series. He is sometimes called the father of space opera.


Biography

Family and education

Edward Elmer Smith was born in Sheboygan, Wisconsin on May 2, 1890, to Fred Jay Smith and Caroline Mills Smith, both staunch Presbyterians of British ancestry.[1] His mother was a teacher born in Michigan in February 1855; his father was a sailor, born in Maine in January 1855 to an English father.[2] They moved to Spokane, Washington, the winter after Edward Elmer was born,[3] where Mr. Smith was working as a contractor in 1900.[4] In 1902, the family moved to Seneaquoteen,[5] near the Pend Oreille River, in Kootenai County, Idaho.[6] He had four siblings, Rachel M. born September 1882, Daniel M. born January 1884, Mary Elizabeth born February 1886 (all of whom were born in Michigan), and Walter E. born July 1891 in Washington.[7] In 1910, Fred and Caroline Smith and their son Walter were living in the Markham Precinct of Bonner County, Idaho; Fred is listed in census records as a farmer.[8]

Smith worked primarily as a manual laborer until he injured his wrist, at the age of 19, while escaping from a fire. He attended the University of Idaho. (Many years later he would be installed in the 1984 Class of the University of Idaho Alumni Hall of Fame.[9]) He entered its prep school in 1907, and graduated with two degrees in chemical engineering in 1914. He was president of the Chemistry Club, the Chess Club, and the Mandolin and Guitar Club, and captain of the Drill and Rifle Team; he also sang the bass lead in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas.[10] His undergraduate thesis was _Some Clays of Idaho_, co-written with classmate Chester Fowler Smith, who died in California of tuberculosis the following year, after taking a teaching fellowship at Berkeley.[11] Whether the two were related is not known.

On October 5, 1915, in Boise, Idaho[12] he married Jeanne Craig MacDougall, the sister of his college roommate, Allen Scott (Scotty) MacDougall.[13] (Her sister was named Clarissa MacLean MacDougall; the heroine of the _Lensman_ novels would later be named Clarissa MacDougall.) Jeanne MacDougall was born in Glasgow, Scotland; her parents were Donald Scott MacDougall, a violinist, and Jessica Craig MacLean. Her father had moved to Boise when the children were young, and later sent for his family; he died while they were en route in 1905. Jeanne's mother, who remarried businessman and retired politician John F. Kessler in 1914[14] worked at, and later owned, a boarding house on Ridenbaugh Street.

The Smiths had three children:

-   Roderick N., born June 3, 1918, in the District of Columbia, was employed as a design engineer at Lockheed Aircraft.
-   Verna Jean (later Verna Smith Trestrail), born August 25, 1920, in Michigan, was his literary executor until her death in 1994. (Her son Kim Trestrail is now the executor.[15]) Robert A. Heinlein in part dedicated his 1982 novel _Friday_ to Verna.[16]
-   Clarissa M. (later Clarissa Wilcox), was born December 13, 1921, in Michigan.[17]

Early chemical career and the beginning of _Skylark_

Amazbuck.jpg After college, Smith was a junior chemist for the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., developing standards for butter and for oysters.[18] He may have served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army during World War I, but details are unknown.[19] His draft card, partly illegible, seems to show that Smith requested exemption from military service, based on his wife's dependence and on his contribution to the war effort as a civilian chemist.[20]

One evening in 1915, the Smiths were visiting a former classmate from the University of Idaho, Dr. Carl Garby, who had also moved to Washington, D.C. He lived nearby in the Seaton Place Apartments with his wife, Lee Hawkins Garby. A long discussion about journeys into outer space ensued, and it was suggested that Smith should write down his ideas and speculations as a story about interstellar travel. Although he was interested, Smith believed after some thought that some romantic elements would be required and he was uncomfortable with that.

Mrs. Garby offered to take care of the love interest and the romantic dialogue, and Smith decided to give it a try. The sources of inspirations for the main characters in the novel were themselves; the "Seatons" and "Cranes" were based on the Smiths and Garbys, respectively.[21] About one third of _The Skylark of Space_ was completed by the end of 1916, when Smith and Garby gradually abandoned work on it.

Smith earned his master's degree in chemistry from the George Washington University in 1917, studying under Dr. Charles E. Munroe.[22][23][24] Smith completed his PhD in chemical engineering[25] in 1918,[26] with a food engineering focus; his dissertation, _The effect of bleaching with oxides of nitrogen upon the baking quality and commercial value of wheat flour_, was published in 1919.[27] (Warner and Fleischer give the title _The Effect of the Oxides of Nitrogen upon the Carotin Molecule – C40H56_, which is difficult to explain. Sam Moskowitz gives the degree date 1919,[28] perhaps reflecting different dates for thesis submission, thesis defense, and degree certification.)

Writing _Skylark_

In 1919, Smith was hired as chief chemist for F. W. Stock & Sons of Hillsdale, Michigan, at one time the largest family-owned mill east of the Mississippi,[29] working on doughnut mixes.[30]

One evening late in 1919, after moving to Michigan, Smith was baby-sitting (presumably for Roderick) while his wife attended a movie; he resumed work on _The Skylark of Space_, finishing it in the spring of 1920.[31][32] He submitted it to many book publishers and magazines, spending more in postage than he would eventually receive for its publication. Bob Davis, editor of _Argosy_, sent an encouraging rejection letter in 1922, saying that he liked the novel personally, but that it was too far out for his readers.[33] (According to Warner, but no other source, Smith began work on the sequel, _Skylark III_, before the first book was accepted.) Finally, upon seeing the April 1927 issue of _Amazing Stories_, he submitted it to that magazine; it was accepted, initially for $75, later raised to $125.[34] It was published as a three-part serial in the August to October 1928 issues[35] and it was such a success that managing editor Sloane requested a sequel before the second installment had been published.[36]

Mrs. Garby was not interested in further collaboration, so Smith began work on _Skylark Three_ alone.[37] It was published as another three-part serial, in the August to October 1930 issues of _Amazing_, introduced as the cover story for August.[38] (In 1930, the Smiths were living in Michigan, at 33 Rippon Avenue in Hillsdale.)[39] This was as far as he had planned to take the _Skylark_ series; it was praised in _Amazing_{{'}}s letter column,[40] and he was paid ¾¢ per word, surpassing _Amazing_{{'}}s previous record of half a cent.[41]

The early 1930s: between _Skylark_ and _Lensman_

Smith then began work on what he intended as a new series, starting with _Spacehounds of IPC,_[42] which he finished in the autumn of 1930.[43] In this novel, he took pains to avoid the scientific impossibilities which had bothered some readers of the _Skylark_ novels.[44] Even in 1938, after he had written _Galactic Patrol_, Smith considered it his finest work;[45] he later said of it, "This was really scientific fiction; not, like the Skylarks, pseudo-science";[46] and even at the end of his career, he considered it his only work of true science fiction.[47] It was published in the July through September 1931 issues of _Amazing,_ with Sloane making unauthorized changes.[48] Fan letters in the magazine complained about the novel's containment within the solar system, and Sloane sided with the readers. So when Harry Bates, editor of _Astounding Stories_, offered Smith 2¢/word—payable on publication—for his next story, he agreed; this meant that it could not be a sequel to _Spacehounds._[49]

This book would be _Triplanetary_, "in which scientific detail would not be bothered about, and in which his imagination would run riot."[50] Indeed, characters within the story point out its psychological[51] and scientific[52] implausibilities, and sometimes even seem to suggest self-parody.[53] At other times, they are conspicuously silent about obvious implausibilities.[54][55] The January 1933 issue of _Astounding_ announced that _Triplanetary_ would appear in the March issue, and that issue's cover illustrated a scene from the story, but _Astounding_{{'}}s financial difficulties prevented the story from appearing.[56] Smith then submitted the manuscript to _Wonder Stories_, whose new editor, 17-year-old Charles D. Hornig, rejected it, later boasting about the rejection in a fanzine.[57] He finally submitted it to _Amazing_, which published it beginning in January 1934, but for only half a cent a word. Shortly after it was accepted, F. Orlin Tremaine, the new editor of the revived _Astounding_, offered one cent a word for _Triplanetary_; when he learned that he was too late, he suggested a third _Skylark_ novel instead.[58]

In the winter of 1933–34, Smith worked on _The Skylark of Valeron_, but he felt that the story was getting out of control; he sent his first draft to Tremaine, with a distraught note asking for suggestions. Tremaine accepted the rough draft for $850, and announced it in the June 1934 issue, with a full-page editorial and a three-quarter-page advertisement. The novel was published in the August 1934 through February 1935 issues.[59] _Astounding_'s circulation rose by 10,000 for the first issue, and its two main competitors, _Amazing_ and _Wonder Stories_, fell into financial difficulties, both skipping issues within a year.[60]

The _Lensman_ series

In January 1936, a time period where he was already an established science-fiction writer, he took a job for salary plus profit-sharing, as a food technologist (a cereal chemist) at the Dawn Doughnut Company of Jackson, Michigan.[61] This initially entailed almost a year's worth of 18-hour days and seven-day workweeks. Individuals who knew Smith confirmed that he had a role in developing mixes for doughnuts and other pastries, but the contention that he developed the first process for making powdered sugar adhere to doughnuts cannot be substantiated.[62] Smith was reportedly dislocated from his job at Dawn Doughnuts by prewar rationing in early 1940.[63]

Smith had been contemplating writing a "space-police novel" since early 1927;[64] once he had "the Lensmen's universe fairly well set up", he reviewed his science-fiction collection for "cops-and-robbers" stories. He cites Clinton Constantinescue's "War of the Universe" as a negative example, and Starzl and Williamson as positive ones.[65] Tremaine responded extremely positively to a brief description of the idea.[66]

Once Dawn Doughnuts became profitable in late 1936, Smith wrote an 85-page outline for what became the four core _Lensman_ novels; in early 1937, Tremaine committed to buying them.[67] Segmenting the story into four novels required considerable effort to avoid dangling loose ends; Smith cites Edgar Rice Burroughs as a negative example.[68] After the outline was complete, he wrote a more detailed outline of _Galactic Patrol_, plus a detailed graph of its structure, with "peaks of emotional intensity and the valleys of characterization and background material." He notes, however, that he was never able to follow any of his outlines at all closely, as the "characters get away from me and do exactly as they damn please."[69] After completing the rough draft of _Galactic Patrol_, he wrote the concluding chapter of the last book in the series, _Children of the Lens._[70] _Galactic Patrol_ was published in the September 1937 through February 1938 issues of _Astounding_; unlike the revised book edition, it was not set in the same universe as _Triplanetary_.[71]

_Gray Lensman_, the fourth book in the series, appeared in _Astounding_{{'}}s October 1939 through January 1940 issues. (Note that the frequent British spelling "grey" is simply a recurrent mistake, starting with the cover of the first installment; Moskowitz's usage, _"The Grey Lensman",_ is even harder to justify.[72]) _Gray Lensman_ (and its cover illustration) was extremely well received. Campbell's editorial in the December issue suggested that the October issue was the best issue of _Astounding_ ever, and _Gray Lensman_ was first place in the Analytical Laboratory statistics "by a lightyear", with three runners-up in a distant tie for second place.[73] The cover was also praised by readers in _Brass Tacks_, and Campbell noted, "We got a letter from E. E. Smith saying he and Hubert Rogers agreed on how Kinnison looked."[74]

Smith was the guest of honor at Chicon I, the second World Science Fiction Convention, held in Chicago over Labor Day weekend 1940,[75] giving a speech on the importance of science fiction fandom entitled "What Does This Convention Mean?"[76] He attended the convention's masquerade as C. L. Moore's Northwest Smith, and met fans living near him in Michigan, who would later form the Galactic Roamers, which previewed and advised him on his future work.[77]

Smith worked for the US Army between 1941 and 1945. An extended segment in the novel version of _Triplanetary_, set during World War II, suggests intimate familiarity with explosives and munitions manufacturing. Some biographers cite as fact that, just as Smith's protagonist in this segment lost his job over failure to approve substandard munitions, Smith did, as well. Smith began work for the J. W. Allen Company (a manufacturer of doughnut and frosting mixes) in 1946 and worked for them until his professional retirement in 1957.[78]

Retirement and late writing

After Smith retired, his wife and he lived in Clearwater, Florida,[79] in the fall and winter, driving the smaller of their two trailers to Seaside, Oregon, each April, often stopping at science fiction conventions on the way. (Smith did not like to fly.[80]) In 1963, he was presented the inaugural First Fandom Hall of Fame award at the 21st World Science Fiction Convention in Washington, D.C.[81] Some of his biography is captured in an essay by Robert A. Heinlein, which was reprinted in the collection _Expanded Universe_ in 1980. A more detailed, although allegedly[82] error-ridden biography is in Sam Moskowitz's _Seekers of Tomorrow._

Robert Heinlein and Smith were friends. (Heinlein dedicated his 1958 novel _Methuselah's Children_ "To Edward E. Smith, PhD".[83]) Heinlein reported that E. E. Smith perhaps took his "unrealistic" heroes from life, citing as an example the extreme competence of the hero of _Spacehounds of IPC_. He reported that E. E. Smith was a large, blond, athletic, very intelligent, very gallant man, married to a remarkably beautiful, intelligent, red-haired woman named MacDougal (thus perhaps the prototypes of 'Kimball Kinnison' and 'Clarissa MacDougal'). In Heinlein's essay, he reports that he began to suspect Smith might be a sort of "superman" when he asked Smith for help in purchasing a car. Smith tested the car by driving it on a back road at illegally high speeds with their heads pressed tightly against the roof columns to listen for chassis squeaks by bone conduction—a process apparently improvised on the spot.

In his nonseries novels written after his professional retirement, _Galaxy Primes_, _Subspace Explorers_, and _Subspace Encounter_, E. E. Smith explores themes of telepathy and other mental abilities collectively called "psionics", and of the conflict between libertarian and socialistic/communistic influences in the colonization of other planets. _Galaxy Primes_ was written after critics such as Groff Conklin and P. Schuyler Miller in the early '50s accused his fiction of being passé, and he made an attempt to do something more in line with the concepts about which _Astounding_ editor John W. Campbell encouraged his writers to make stories. Despite this, it was rejected by Campbell, and it was eventually published by _Amazing Stories_ in 1959. His late story "The Imperial Stars" (1964), featuring a troupe of circus performers involved in sabotage in a galactic empire, recaptured some of the atmosphere from his earlier works and was intended as the first in a new series, with outlines of later parts rumored to still exist.[84]

The fourth _Skylark_ novel, _Skylark DuQuesne_, ran in the June to October 1965 issues of _If_, beginning once again as the cover story. Editor Frederik Pohl introduced it with a one-page summary of the previous stories, which were all at least 30 years old.[85]

Lord Tedric

Smith published two novelettes entitled "Tedric" in _Other Worlds Science Fiction Stories_ (1953) and "Lord Tedric" in _Universe Science Fiction_ (1954). These were almost completely forgotten until after Smith's death. In 1975, a compendium of Smith's works was published, entitled _The Best of E. E. "Doc" Smith_, containing these two short stories, excerpts from several of his major works, and another short story first published in _Worlds of If_ in 1964 entitled "The Imperial Stars".

In Smith's original short stories, Tedric was a smith (both blacksmith and whitesmith) residing in a small town near a castle in a situation roughly equivalent to England of the 1200s. He received instruction in advanced metallurgy from a time-traveler who wanted to change the situation in his own time by modifying certain events of the past. From this instruction, he was able to build better suits of armor and help defeat the villains of the piece. Unlike Eklund's later novels based on these short stories, the original Tedric never left his own time or planet, and fought purely local enemies of his own time period.

A few years later and 13 years after Smith's death, Verna Smith arranged with Gordon Eklund to publish another novel of the same name about the same fictional character, introducing it as "a new series conceived by E. E. 'Doc' Smith". Eklund later went on to publish the other novels in the series, one or two under the pseudonym "E. E. 'Doc' Smith" or "E. E. Smith". The protagonist possesses heroic qualities similar to those of the heroes in Smith's original novels and can communicate with an extra-dimensional race of beings known as the Scientists, whose archenemy is Fra Villion, a mysterious character described as a dark knight, skilled in whip-sword combat, and evil genius behind the creation of a planetoid-sized "iron sphere" armed with a weapon capable of destroying planets. As a result, Smith is believed by many to be the unacknowledged progenitor of themes that would appear in _Star Wars_. In fact, however, these appear in the sequels written by others after Smith's death.


Critical opinion

Smith's novels are generally considered to be classic space operas,[86] and he is sometimes called the first of the three "novas" of 20th-century science fiction (with Stanley G. Weinbaum and Robert A. Heinlein as the second and third novas).[87]

Heinlein credited him for being his main influence:

  I have learned from many writers—from Verne and Wells and Campbell and Sinclair Lewis, et al.—but I have learned more from you than from any of the others and perhaps more than for all the others put together...[88]

Smith expressed a preference for inventing fictional technologies that were not strictly impossible (so far as the science of the day was aware) but highly unlikely: "the more highly improbable a concept is—short of being contrary to mathematics whose fundamental operations involve no neglect of infinitesimals—the better I like it" was his phrase.[89]

_Lensman_ was one of five finalists when the 1966 World Science Fiction Convention judged the Isaac Asimov's _Foundation_ the Best All-Time Series.[90]

The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Smith in 2004.[91]


Extending the _Lensman_ universe

_Vortex Blasters_ (also known as _Masters of the Vortex_) is set in the same universe as the _Lensman_ novels. It is an extension to the main storyline which takes place between _Galactic Patrol_ and _Children of the Lens_, and introduces a different type of psionics from that used by the Lensmen. _Spacehounds of IPC_ is not a part of the series, despite occasional erroneous statements to the contrary. (It is listed as a novel in the series in some paperback editions of the 1970s.)

Robert A. Heinlein reported that Smith had planned a seventh _Lensman_ novel, set after the events described in _Children of the Lens_, which was unpublishable at that time (the early 1960s).[92] Smith told Heinlein that the new novel proceeded inexorably from matters left unresolved in _Children_, a statement easily supported by a careful reading of _Children_. Careful searches by people who knew Smith well (including Frederik Pohl, Smith's editor, and Verna Smith Trestrail, Smith's daughter) have failed to locate any material related to such a story. Smith apparently never wrote any of it down.

On July 14, 1965, barely a month before his death, Smith gave written permission to William B. Ellern to continue the _Lensman_ series, which led to the publishing of "Moon Prospector" in 1965 and _New Lensman_ in 1976. Smith's long-time friend, Dave Kyle, wrote three authorized added novels in the _Lensman_ series that provided background about the major nonhuman Lensmen: _Dragon Lensman_, _Lensman from Rigel_, and _Z-Lensman_.


Influence on science and the military

Smith was widely read by scientists and engineers from the 1930s into the 1970s. Literary precursors of ideas which arguably entered the military-scientific complex include SDI (_Triplanetary_), stealth (_Gray Lensman_), the OODA loop, C3-based warfare, and the AWACS (_Gray Lensman_).

An inarguable influence was described in a June 11, 1947, letter[93] to Smith from John W. Campbell (the editor of _Astounding_, where much of the _Lensman_ series was originally published). In it, Campbell relayed Captain Cal Laning's[94] acknowledgment that he had used Smith's ideas for displaying the battlespace situation (called the "tank" in the stories) in the design of the United States Navy's ships' Combat Information Centers. "The entire set-up was taken specifically, directly, and consciously from the _Directrix_. In your story, you reached the situation the Navy was in—more communication channels than integration techniques to handle it. You proposed such an integrating technique and proved how advantageous it could be. You, sir, were 100% right. As the Japanese Navy—not the hypothetical Boskonian fleet—learned at an appalling cost."

One underlying theme of the later _Lensman_ novels was the difficulty in maintaining military secrecy—as advanced capabilities are revealed, the opposing side can often duplicate them. This point was also discussed extensively by John Campbell in his letter to Smith.[95] Also in the later _Lensman_ novels, and particular after the "Battle of Klovia" broke the Boskonian's power base at the end of _Second Stage Lensmen_, the Boskonian forces and particularly Kandron of Onlo reverted to terroristic tactics to attempt to demoralize Civilization, thus providing an early literary glimpse into this modern problem of both law enforcement and military response. The use of "Vee-two" gas by the pirates attacking the _Hyperion_ in _Triplanetary_ (in both magazine and book appearances) also suggests anticipation of the terrorist uses of poison gases. (But note that Smith lived through WW I, when the use of poison gas on troops was well known to the populace; extending the assumption that pirates might use it if they could obtain it was no great extension of the present-day knowledge.)

The beginning of the story _Skylark of Space_ describes in relative detail the protagonist's research into separation of platinum group residues, subsequent experiments involving electrolysis, and the discovery of a process evocative of cold fusion (over 50 years before Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann). He describes a nuclear process yielding large amounts of energy and producing only negligible radioactive waste—which then goes on to form the basis of the adventures in the Skylark books. Smith's general description of the process of discovery is highly evocative of Röntgen's descriptions of his discovery of the X-ray.

Another theme of the _Skylark_ novels involves precursors of modern information technology. The humanoid aliens encountered in the first novel have developed a primitive technology called the "mechanical educator", which allows direct conversion of brain waves into intelligible thought for transmission to others or for electrical storage. By the third novel in the series, _Skylark of Valeron_, this technology has grown into an "Electronic Brain" which is capable of computation on all "bands" of energy—electromagnetism, gravity, and "tachyonic" energy and radiation bands included. This is itself derived from a discussion of reductionist atomic theory in the second novel, _Skylark Three_, which brings to mind modern quark and sub-quark theories of elementary particle physics.


Literary influences

In his 1947 essay "The Epic of Space", Smith listed (by last name only) authors he enjoyed reading: John W. Campbell, L. Sprague de Camp, Robert A. Heinlein, Murray Leinster, H. P. Lovecraft, and A. Merritt (specifically _The Ship of Ishtar_, _The Moon Pool_, _The Snake Mother_, and _Dwellers in the Mirage_, as well as the character John Kenton), C. L. Moore (specifically "Jirel of Joiry"), Roman Frederick Starzl, John Taine, A. E. van Vogt, Stanley G. Weinbaum (specifically "Tweerl"[96]), and Jack Williamson. In a passage on his preparation for writing the _Lensman_ novels, he notes that Clinton Constantinescu's "War of the Universe" was not a masterpiece,[97][98] but says that Starzl and Williamson were masters; this suggests that Starzl's Interplanetary Flying Patrol may have been an influence on Smith's Triplanetary Patrol, later the _Galactic Patrol_. The feeding of the Overlords of Delgon upon the life-force of their victims at the end of chapter five of _Galactic Patrol_ seems a clear allusion to chapter 29 of _The Moon Pool_, Merritt's account of the Taithu and the power of love in chapters 29 and 34 also bear some resemblance to the end of _Children of the Lens._[99] Smith also mentions Edgar Rice Burroughs, complaining about loose ends at the end of one of his novels.

Smith acknowledges the help of the Galactic Roamers writers' workshop, plus E. Everett Evans, Ed Counts, an unnamed aeronautical engineer, Dr. James Enright, and Dr. Richard W. Dodson. Smith's daughter, Verna, lists the following authors as visitors to the Smith household in her youth: Lloyd Arthur Eshbach, Heinlein, Dave Kyle, Bob Tucker, Williamson, Pohl, Merritt, and the Galactic Roamers. Smith cites Bigelow's _Theoretical Chemistry–Fundamentals_ as a justification for the possibility of the inertialess drive. Also, an extended reference is made to Rudyard Kipling's "Ballad of Boh Da Thone" in _Gray Lensman_ (chapter 22, "Regeneration", in a conversation between Kinnison and MacDougall).

Sam Moskowitz's biographical essay on Smith in _Seekers of Tomorrow_ states that he regularly read _Argosy_ magazine, and everything by H. G. Wells, Jules Verne, H. Rider Haggard, Edgar Allan Poe, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Moskowitz also notes that Smith's "reading enthusiasms included poetry, philosophy, ancient and medieval history, and all of English literature".[100] (Smith's grandson notes that he spoke, and sang, German.[101]) The influence of these is not readily apparent, except in the Roman section of _Triplanetary_, and in the impeccable but convoluted grammar of Smith's narration. Some influence of 19th-century philosophy of language may be detectable in the account in _Galactic Patrol_ of the Lens of Arisia as a universal translator, which is reminiscent of Frege's strong realism about _Sinn_, that is, thought or sense.

Both Moskowitz and Smith's daughter Verna Smith Trestrail report that Smith had a troubled relationship with John Campbell, the editor of _Astounding_. Smith's most successful works were published under Campbell, but the degree of influence is uncertain. The original outline for the _Lensman_ series had been accepted by F. Orlin Tremaine,[102] and Smith angered Campbell by showing loyalty to Tremaine at his new magazine, _Comet_, when he sold him "The Vortex Blaster" in 1941.[103] Campbell's announcement of _Children of the Lens_, in 1947, was less than enthusiastic.[104] Campbell later said that he published it only reluctantly,[105] though he praised it privately,[106] and bought little from Smith thereafter.


Derivative works and influence on popular culture

-   Randall Garrett wrote a parody entitled _Backstage Lensman_ which Smith reportedly enjoyed. Harry Harrison also parodied Smith's work in the novel, _Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers_.
-   Garrett also included a reference to Smith in his _Lord Darcy_ novels; the badge of the Royal Messengers resembles the Lens, and the spell to activate one was devised by a wizard named Dr Edward Elmer.
-   Sir Arthur C. Clarke's space battle in _Earthlight_ was based on the attack on the Mardonalian fortress in chapter seven of _Skylark Three_.[107]
-   Steve 'Slug' Russell wrote one of the first computer games, _Spacewar!_, with inspiration from the space battles from the Lensman series.
-   The GURPS role-playing game includes a worldbook based on the Lensman series.
-   The Japanese _Lensman_ anime is more an imitation of _Star Wars_ than a translation of the _Lensman_ novels. Efforts to print translations of the associated manga in the United States in the early 1990s without payment of royalties to the Smith family were successfully blocked in court by Verna Smith Trestrail with the help of several California science-fiction authors and fans.
-   In his biography, George Lucas reveals that the _Lensman_ novels were a major influence on his youth. J. Michael Straczynski, creator of the science-fiction television series _Babylon 5_, also has acknowledged the influence of the _Lensman_ books.[108][109]
-   Superman creator Jerry Siegel was impressed, at an early age, with the optimistic vision of the future presented in _Skylark of Space_.[110]
-   Two members of the Green Lantern Corps are named Arisia and Eddore.
-   An attempt to create a feature film based on the _Lensman_ series by Ron Howard's Imagine Entertainment and Universal Studios began in 2008 with J. Michael Straczynski, the creator of _Babylon 5_, as writer,[111] but in 2014 the project was scrapped due to budget limitations.[112]


Fictional appearances

Smith himself appears as a character in the 2006 novel _The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril_ by Paul Malmont. The novel describes friendship and rivalry among pulp writers of the 1930s. He also appears as "Lensman Ted Smith" in the 1980 novel _The Number of the Beast_ and as "Commander Ted Smith" in the 1985 novel _The Cat Who Walks Through Walls_, both by Robert A. Heinlein. It is also suggested that he was one of the inspirations for Heinlein's character Lazarus Long. Christopher Nuttall incorporates a fictional quote from “Edward E. Smith, Professor of Sociology” in his military science fiction book, “No Worse Enemy”.

[32] "Doughnut Specialist Smith" says "It wasn't until 1919 that work really began ... Five years passed before acceptance by the first science-fiction magazine on the American market, and two more years elapsed before it was published." This is not consistent with other sources.

[71] The Commandant's account of the Patrol's early history at the beginning of the magazine version of _Galactic Patrol_ does not describe what happened in the magazine version of _Triplanetary_; the reference to Virgil Samms and the Triplanetary Patrol is a later interpolation. (_Astounding_ September 1937 pp. 12–13; cp. Fantasy Press edition pp. 8–9.) The reference to "the days of the semi-inert drive" and the Third Galactic Survey on page 34 of the same issue is not consistent with the history of partial inertialessness in either version of _Triplanetary_, and is omitted from page 42 of the Fantasy Press edition. (_Amazing_ March 1934 pp. 28 & 33; cp. Fantasy Press edition pp. 223 & 231.) See also Gharlane's Lens FAQ Question 1. The Arisians' near-omniscience about the future is also interpolated, e.g., _Astounding_ January 1938 p. 127 vs. first edition p. 205.
