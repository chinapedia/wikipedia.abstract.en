OMEGA2 is a personal single-board computer created by a Toronto-based startup company called _Onion_, released on Kickstarter. It is advertised as "the world's smallest Linux Server".[1] The system combines the tiny form factor and power-efficiency of the Arduino, with the power and flexibilities of the Raspberry Pi and is identified with FCC Identifier 2AJVP-OMEGA2.[2] It runs Linux kernel based lightweight operating system for embedded system called OpenWRT.

The SoC is planned to be shipped in the end of November 2016.


History

Omega2 is the next generation of the old product Onion makes, Omega.[3] The original Omega was based on the Qualcomm Atheros AR9331 (MIPS architecture)[4] SoC which runs a full Linux operating system designed for embedded system and sold for $19.99. The company has discontinued development of the Omega, and replaced it with the successor, Omega2, using another SoC chip - Mediatek MT7688[5] which also has a metal cover over the chip. They have also drastically cut the price to $5 (but later increased it to $7.5).

As of the beginning of 2017, Onion has already attracted crowdfunding of more than $850,000 for the Omega2, which has greatly exceeded their initial goal of $440,000.Omega2+_with_Expansion_Dock.jpg


Hardware Features

Omega2 comes in two versions, the basic OMEGA2 and OMEGA2 PLUS. Omega2 CPU is based on MIPS architecture[6] running at 580 MHz clock speed, equipped with 64 MB of RAM and 16 MB of flash memory. Omega2 Plus is similar to Omega2, except it has 128 MB RAM and 32 MB memory and a MicroSD slot, sold for $9 USD. The system comes in a small PCB footprint with dual-in-line 16x2mm pins. The board runs at 3.3 volts of power with average power consumption of 0.6W.[7] Both devices are intended for as headless computers with no graphical interfaces in Embedded systems.
