RUMPELSTILTSKIN is a musical based on the Brother's Grimm Fairytale of the same name, featuring a score by Broadway composer / music director Steve Marzullo,[1] lyrics by Amelia DeMayo, and book by Deb Roberts. This adaptation differs slightly from its source material but honors the story.[2] _Rumpelstiltskin_ is currently unavailable for licensing.


Synopsis


Background

In 2008, a draft of the show was workshopped in New Jersey by the writers DeMayo, Marzullo, and Roberts featuring young actors from New Jersey. After this workshop, the project was put on hold for three years.


Productions

Reading

In 2011, the show resumed development and was presented as a reading in NYC under the direction of the book writer, Deb Roberts featuring a cast solely of Broadway kids and teenagers. The book underwent much development after this process due to critical reception from producers.

Off-Broadway

The show was first presented Off-Broadway by the WorkShop Theater in association with the Broadway Youth Ensemble.[3] Produced by Jeff Paul and Evan Bernardin, the production opened in January 2012 after one week of previews. This production contained a large cast of young Broadway stars.[4] It also featured direction by Kathy Gail MacGowan, choreography by Steve Petrillo, lighting and sets by Michael Selkirk, costumes by Miriam Hyfler and Stefania Diana Schramm, and musical direction by Marzullo, the show’s composer.[5] After only a four month run, the production closed in April.[6] However, in its short run, the cast underwent much change and saw many swings and understudies who soon became replacements.[7]

New Jersey

No more than a month after closing at the WorkShop Theater, the production was revived in New Jersey for one weekend only featuring some members of the original cast, replications of most set pieces, costumes, and lighting, and new musical direction / arrangements by Joseph Baker.[8]
