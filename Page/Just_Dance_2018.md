_JUST DANCE 2018_ is a dance rhythm game developed by Ubisoft. It was unveiled on June 12, 2017, during its E3[1] press conference, and was released on October 24, 2017 for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch.

This was the last _Just Dance_ game released on the PlayStation 3 console, and by extension, the final PlayStation 3 video game to be published by Ubisoft. Online services for every year-titled _Just Dance_ game prior to _Just Dance 2019_ on seventh-generation consoles ended on November 19, 2018.[2][3]


Gameplay

As with the previous installments of the franchise, players must mimic the on-screen dancer's choreography to a chosen song using either motion controllers or the game's associated Just Dance Controller app on a smartphone. A new "Super" judgment was added between "Good" and "Perfect".[4] The "Dance Lab" mode features medleys of choreography representing different professions and animals,[5] while a new "Kids Mode" was designed to provide a gameplay experience and choreography tailored towards younger players.[6]

The Nintendo Switch version of the game features a new "Double Rumble" mode, which features routines based on different professions that leverage the "HD Rumble" functionality in the console's Joy-Con controllers to provide feedback.[7]
