MIRTH PROVISIONS is a company that sells cannabis-infused beverages. Mirth was founded in 2014 by Adam Stites[1] and is based in Longview, Washington.[2]

Mirth's beverage brand is Legal, which is available in several flavors, the first of which was cold-brewed coffee.[3][4] Legal beverages contain cannabinoids, either THC or CBD,[5] and are sold for both recreational and medical purposes. As of March 2016, they were available in Washington, Oregon, California, and Arizona.[6]

During its first year, the company had a problem with Legal bottles exploding on some dispensary shelves, probably due to excessive yeast.[7]

Beverages were about 4% of the cannabis market in 2014 but had fallen to around 1.5% of the market in 2016.[8] Mirth had 36% of the cannabis-infused beverage market in the middle of 2016.[9]
