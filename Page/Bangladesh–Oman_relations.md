BANGLADESH–OMAN RELATIONS are the bilateral relations between Bangladesh and Oman.[1]


History

The Sultanate of Oman recognized Bangladesh in 1974. Bangladesh established her diplomatic mission in Oman in March 1983. Since then the two countries have been maintaining cordial relations. Oman was one of the first Arab countries to extend support to Bangladesh's membership at the UN and other international organizations. Bangladesh upgraded its mission in Oman in 1996 at the level of Ambassador. The Sultanate of Oman established its full-fledged embassy in Dhaka in 2012.

Bangladesh has a resident embassy in Oman.[2] Bangladeshi employees fall under the Kafala system, which bounds them to their employers and according to Human Rights Watch it leaves them vulnerable to abuse.[3] In 2013, some 1,34,028 Bangladeshi workers entered into Oman with different categories of work permits and the Mission remains vigilant in facilitating the process. In 2014, 1,05,748 Bangladeshis came to Oman on different categories of visas. Approximately US$700 million has been remitted by Bangladeshi expatriates living in Oman during the FY July 2013-June 2014.
