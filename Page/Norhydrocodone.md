NORHYDROCODONE is the major metabolite of the opioid analgesic hydrocodone.[1] It is formed from hydrocodone in the liver via N-demethylation predominantly by CYP3A4.[2] Unlike hydromorphone, a minor metabolite of hydrocodone, norhydrocodone is described as inactive.[3] However, norhydrocodone is actually an agonist of the Î¼-opioid receptor with similar potency to hydrocodone, but has been found to produce only minimal analgesia when administered peripherally to animals.[4] This is likely due to poor blood-brain-barrier and thus central nervous system penetration.[5]
