KARAMOKO KADER DEMBÉLÉ (born 22 February 2003) is a footballer who plays as a winger for Celtic, and has been called up to represent both Scotland and England at youth level. He attracted media attention in October 2016 when he made his debut for Celtic's under-20 development team at the age of 13.


Early life

Dembélé was born in 2003 in Lambeth, South London. His parents were born in the Ivory Coast. His family moved north to Scotland, to Govan in Glasgow, when he was one year old.[1] Dembélé, or "Kaddy" as he is known, attended St Constantine’s Primary School in Drumoyne.[2][3]


Club career

Dembélé started playing football for Park Villa Boys Club at the age of five and was recognised as a prodigy from a young age.[4] He joined Celtic aged 10 in 2013.[5] In July 2016, Dembélé was named as player of the tournament when representing Celtic U13 at the St Kevin's Boys Academy Cup.[6] Soon after his appointment as Celtic head coach, Brendan Rodgers invited Dembélé to participate in a light technical training session with the first team squad.[7][8][9]

On 3 October 2016, Dembélé gained widespread media attention after making his debut for Celtic's Under-20 side aged 13 playing with and against players who were up to seven age groups above him.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16] He was named on the bench because several regular starters were away playing for Scotland’s Under-19 team and was brought in during the 81st minute, replacing the youngest first-team player in Celtic’s history, the 16-year-old Jack Aitchison.[17] A match report on the official Celtic website stated that "the diminutive playmaker didn’t look out of place and played his part in the closing stages."[18] The response to Dembélé's U20 debut included concern about the physical and mental impact of such a young player being fast-tracked through the developmental ranks.[19][20][21][22][23][24]

On 2 June 2017, Dembélé signed a youth registration contract to stay at Celtic.[25]

On 24 December 2018, Dembélé signed his first professional contract at 15-years-old with Celtic, set to keep him at the club until 2021.[26] In April 2019, he featured for Celtic's academy team in the seasonal finals of both the Scottish Youth Cup and the Glasgow Cup, losing out 3–2 to Rangers in the first[27] and beating the same opposition by the same scoreline in the second.[28]

Dembélé made his senior debut on 19 May 2019 in a 2–1 victory against Hearts, coming on as a second half substitute. After the match, Dembélé collected his winners' medal and helped to lift the Scottish Premiership trophy as Celtic ended the season 9 points clear at the top of the league.[29] His performance was praised by manager Neil Lennon.[30] Six days later, he was named in the squad for the 2019 Scottish Cup Final, also against Hearts. This time he did not leave the bench, but collected a winner's medal following Celtic's 2–1 victory.[31]


International career

Dembélé is eligible to represent Scotland, England or the Ivory Coast internationally.[32][33] On 19 October 2016, he was called up to the Scotland national under-16 football team for the 2016 Victory Shield.[34][35] He made his debut for the Scotland U16s on 1 November, coming on as a second-half substitute during a 2–2 draw against Wales. Coach Brian McLaughlin commented, "He [Dembélé] gave us a little bit of energy. He's very, very brave on the ball".[36] Dembélé made a further appearance a few days later in a 3–0 defeat against the Republic of Ireland, again coming on as a second-half substitute.[37]

However, prior to participating in the Victory Shield, Dembélé traveled south in October 2016 to train with England under-15s at St George's Park.[38][39] On 18 November 2016, Dembélé confirmed his intention to join up with the England U15s ahead of a match against Turkey that December.[40] On 17 December 2016, Dembélé came off the bench against Turkey to make his England debut and assisted a goal in a 5–2 victory.[41][42][43] On 16 February 2017, Dembélé made his first start for England U15 in a match against Belgium [44]

Nevertheless, he also continued to represent Scotland, playing an integral part in the Scotland U16 squads for two UEFA development tournaments in 2017, both of which Scotland won. Most notably Dembélé featured in a Scotland victory over England in July 2017.[45] On 19 August 2018 he made his debut for Scotland under-17's in a 1–0 away win against Russia coming on as a 50th minute substitution for Connor Barron and went on to start 2 days later against Russia.[46][47]


Personal life

Dembélé has an older brother, winger Siriki Dembélé, who plays for Peterborough United.[48] Both are eligible to play for England, Scotland or Ivory Coast respectively as they are of Ivorian descent.[49] Another brother, Hassan, was playing for the Celtic under-9s in November 2017.[50] Their sister Macoula studied law and was signed to a Scottish modelling agency.[51]
