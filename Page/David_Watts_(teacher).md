DAVID WATTS was a British teacher and amateur sound recordist. He was head teacher of Kingsmead School at Hoylake for thirty years.[1][2] The British Library's National Sound Archive holds his collection of wildlife sound recordings, many of which were made in South Africa.[3]

Watts was the son of Arthur Watts, the founding headmaster of Kingsmead.[4]

Watts died in 2013, aged 100.[5] He was survived by his wife Dorothy and their three children, who attended a memorial service in his honour at Kingsmead School on 11 May 2013.[6] His obituary, which described him as "eccentric and affable", was published in _The Times_.[7]
