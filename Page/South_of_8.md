Production

The story was written by the director Tony Olmos in July 2013. In September, it was pitched to executive producer Luke Pensabene. Brian Patrick Butler was cast as the film's lead actor by October and in January 2014, the screenplay was complete. Its third producer Jeanette Di Pinza had joined forming the production name "Rosewood Five."

Planning and casting continued with lead actor George Jac, supporting actor Shane P. Allen, and three of four "Lolas." Filming began in March 2014 starting with a car chase and shootout scene in National City which featured a 1971 Plymouth Barracuda. Jennifer Paredes and Kate Schott were the next two actresses who were confirmed shortly after that as filming continued through August 2014. Referred actress Raye Richards was then auditioned and cast in a supporting role for a filming schedule in Alpine, CA.

In September 2014 production slowed as producers constructed a private studio in downtown San Diego to film four very crucial scenes needed for completion. Construction began in January 2015, and all shoots were wrapped by April 2015. Filming of the filler scenes continued until July 2015, when principal photography wrapped on an aggregated micro budget with an entirely San Diego based cast and crew.[7]
