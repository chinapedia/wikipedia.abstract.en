CHINA GUARDIAN AUCTIONS CO. LTD., or simply CHINA GUARDIAN (), is a mainland Chinese auction house that specialises in the auction of Chinese artwork of all types.[1][2][3] It is particularly known for its sale of Chinese calligraphy and ink paintings.[4][5]

First founded in May 1993 by Chen Dongsheng,[6] China Guardian is China's oldest art-auction firm.[7][8] China Guardian was a leader of the Chinese art auction market until the emergence of Beijing Poly International Auction Co Ltd in the mid-2000s.[9] China Guardian is now considered to be Mainland China's 'number 2 auctioneer' behind Beijing Poly International Auction.[10][11] The auction house was also reported to be the world's 4th largest auction house as at November 2012.[12] The current CEO and managing director is Hu Yanyan, who was included in a 2015 Financial Times list as one of the five most powerful women in Asia’s art world.

Aside from its headquarters in Beijing and offices in Shanghai and Guangzhou, China Guardian also has offices in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and North America (New York and Canada).[14]


Formation, structure and target market

When China Guardian was first established in 1993, it focused primarily on the Mainland Chinese market until it decided to expand to Hong Kong in 2012.[15][16] The Chinese artwork regularly sold by China Guardian includes Chinese paintings, calligraphy, porcelain, furniture, sculptures, rare books, rubbings, jewellery and watches.[17] Approximately 60% of China Guardian's sales are in the categories of ink painting and calligraphy.[18] China Guardian insists that it does not purchase and resell art works; instead China Guardian generates its revenue solely from commission fees on transactions.[19] As of July 2016, China Guardian owns a 24% stake in Taiking Life Insurance Co.[20] Taiking Life Insurance Co, in turn, owns a 13.5% stake in the British auction house Sotheby's.[21][22] Taiking Life Insurance Co and China Guardian were both founded by Chen Dongsheng.[23] In the past 23 years, China Guardian has successfully held more than 1,200 auctions, with a total sales volume of nearly 50 billion yuan. Nearly 450,000 items were sold at the China Guardian’s auctions.[24]
