Notable cases

_United States ex rel. Cody v. Mantech International Corp._, No. 1:16-cv-132 (E.D. Va. May 19, 2017)

Representing plaintiffs Kevin and Muge Cody, Oswald won the first jury verdict under new provisions of the Defense Contractor Whistleblower Protection Act. The case is under appeal; if given full effect, the damages award will exceed $2.5 million plus attorney fees.

_Kramer v. Trans-Lux Corp._, No. 3:11-cv-1424 (D. Conn. Sept. 25, 2012)

With colleague Nicholas Woodfield, Oswald represented plaintiff Richard Kramer in the first Dodd Frank Act retaliation case to reach discovery in federal court. Oswald successfully argued that Kramer met the law's definition of a "whistleblower" despite not having made a report the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission â€” an issue that would ultimately reach the U.S. Supreme Court in _Digital Realty Trust, Inc. v. Somers_, a case with which Oswald was not involved.[3][4]

_Huang v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Virginia_, No. 3:11-cv-50 (W.D. Va. June 12, 2012)

With colleague Adam Carter, Oswald represented plaintiff Weihua Huang in the first successful jury verdict under stronger anti-retaliation provisions added to the False Claims Act by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, winning a damages award of almost $820,000.

_United States ex rel. Oberg v. Nelnet, Inc._, No. 1:07-cv-960 (E.D. Va. Oct. 25, 2010)

Oswald represented whistleblower Jon Oberg in a qui tam lawsuit against multiple student-aid lenders that Oberg alleged were collecting U.S. government subsidies to which they were not entitled.[5] In a 2010 settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, four of these lenders agreed to repay nearly $58 million to taxpayers.[6] Oberg, who had uncovered the scheme while working at the U.S. Department of Education, received a reward of $16.65 million.[7]

_Kalkunte v. DVI Financial Services, Inc._, No. 05-139 (Dep't of Labor ARB Feb. 27, 2009)
