In this perspective, technology becomes a medium that gathers individuals, groups and social movements, which consequently emerge as new protagonists in the world of the high media connection. The engine of the individual emancipation is, indeed, the empowerment of these social actors, that allows them to become active subjects and essential social networks hubs. Events include:
