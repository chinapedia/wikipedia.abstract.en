SY ROGERS is an American Christian pastor who was formerly part of the ex-gay movement. In the late 1980s, Rogers was a President of Exodus International,[1][2][3] and became one of the earliest noted personalities associated with the ex-gay movement during the early 1980s. He wrote a life-story testimony entitled "The Man in the Mirror," which was published in pamphlet form by Last Days Ministries.[4][5]


Life and career

Rogers, who as a young man had lived as a woman and begun the process of arranging to have sex-change surgery,[6][7][8] credited his conversion to Christianity for igniting personal growth and a new-found security in gender identity which enabled a shift in his sexuality to heterosexual.[9] As he states in his personal story, "My goal was not to be straight--it was God". He married a woman he met in a Bible-study group, began to identify as heterosexual,[10][11] and they reared a family together.[12][13][14]

In 1988 Rogers, then 30, a married father, living in Florida, self-describing as a former homosexual and former transsexual, told a reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times that the ex-gay movement was not anti-gay, "If you want to stay gay, that's your business,... But the bottom line is, you have a choice to overcome it. You can change."[15] "The goal is God--not going straight. Straight people don't go to Heaven, redeemed people do."

During Rogers' involvement in the mid to late 1980s, Exodus International had offices on five continents and declared that "all homosexual relationships are sinful."[16] In conducting a speaking tour in 2008 Rogersâ€™ message included "Happily, homosexuality can be turned around,... Homosexuality is out of tune with religion; it is not what God planned for human sexuality." [17][18][19][20][21] Writing in The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide, gay rights advocate Wayne Besen argues that during the AIDS epidemic "some men were literally scared straight - or at least into making the futile attempt," bringing a degree of momentary success to Exodus International.[22]

Rogers is portrayed in the 1993 documentary _One Nation Under God_.[23][24][25]

In 2016, _The Daily Beast_ reported that Rogers's ministry had moved away from the ex-gay message many years earlier, and that although Rogers has not stated as much publicly, Christian pastor Brian Houston of Hillsong Church informed a blogger that Rogers probably regrets his involvement with Exodus International.[26]

Rogers and his wife Karen have been married since 1982 with children and grandchildren.[27][28] Since 2012, he has been a Teaching Pastor with the multi-campus LIFE Church & College in Auckland, New Zealand and conducts conference events.[29][30]
