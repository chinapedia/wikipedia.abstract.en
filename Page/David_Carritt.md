HUGH DAVID GRAHAM CARRITT (15 April 1927 – 3 August 1982) was a British art historian, dealer and critic, who was described by _The New York Times_ as being "responsible for more sensational discoveries in the field of Old Master painting since World War II than any other man".[1]


Early life

Hugh David Graham Carritt was born on 15 April 1927, the only son of the musician and lecturer Reginald Graham Carritt and his wife Christian Norah Begg, of 2 Royal Avenue, Chelsea, London.[2] He had an older sister and a twin sister.[3] He attended Rugby School before reading modern history at Christ Church, Oxford where he won an open scholarship, but graduated with a third-class degree in 1948.[4][5]

After university, Carritt worked for himself as an art dealer, and wrote on art for the _Burlington Magazine_, the _Evening Standard_, and _The Spectator_.[6]

In 1952, at the age of 25, Carritt discovered a painting by Caravaggio in the remote home of a British Navy retired surgeon captain. _The Concert_ is now owned by New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.[7][8]

He joined the auction house Christie's in London, alongside William Mostyn-Owen, Noel Annesley, and Brian Sewell, becoming a director in 1964.[9][10] Sewell "conceived a violent dislike of Carritt, a colleague who committed the dual sins of being a better connoisseur and a Rugbeian".[11]

At a "heavily attended auction" of works from Lord Rosebery's Mentmore Towers collection in 1977, Carritt realised that _The Toilet of Venus_, attributed to Carle van Loo, a minor painter, was a painting by Jean-Honoré Fragonard, _Psyche Showing her Sisters her Gifts from Cupid_. He bought it for £8,000 (or about $14,000), and in 1978 it was acquired by London's National Gallery for £495,000.[12][13][14][15]

At the cottage of Joan, Lady Baird, he discovered an unrecorded painting by Rogier van der Weyden, which is now in London's National Gallery.[16] He also discovered an allegorical painting by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo on the ceiling of the dining room of the Egyptian embassy in London.[17] In a shed in Dublin, he found five large and very dirty canvases by Francesco Guardi.[18]

He founded David Carritt Limited, which is now known as Artemis Fine Arts.[19]


Personal life

Carritt was gay.[20][21] According to Michael Bloch's biography of the politician, Carritt had an affair with Jeremy Thorpe in the late 1950s.[22]

He died of cancer on 3 August 1982 in his London flat at 120 Mount Street, aged 55.[23][24]
