JAVIER ÁLVAREZ DE LOS MOZOS (born 9 February 1976) is a Spanish football manager, who is currently in charge of Arandina.


Career

Born in Burgos, Castile and León, De los Mozos started his managerial career at Vadillos CF's youth setup. In 1998, aged only 22, he was appointed manager of Tercera División side Racing Lermeño.[1]

In 2000, De los Mozos moved to hometown club Burgos CF, as Carlos Terrazas' assistant. He remained in the role in the following years, working with Enrique Martín and again with Terrazas before leaving in 2004.[2]

In December 2005, De los Mozos was named CD Móstoles manager, but was sacked the following 27 April.[3] He subsequently had spells at CF Norma San Leonardo and Mérida UD, the latter as Fabri's assistant, before returning to Burgos in July 2008 now as a head coach.[4]

De los Mozos resigned in 2010, and later rejected offers from CD Aguilar[5] and CD Guijuelo.[6] On 9 February 2012 he returned to coaching with CD Bupolsa, Burgos' reserve team,[7] but stepped down in August.[8]

On 7 March 2013 De los Mozos was appointed at GCE Villaralbo,[9] remaining in charge until the end of the campaign, which ended in relegation. He only returned to action the following 23 January with CD Cristo Atlético,[10] but resigned due to "personal reasons" on 30 March.[11]

On 19 June 2014 De los Mozos was named CD Mirandés assistant manager, joining Terrazas for a third time.[12] On 1 December 2016, after the latter's dismissal, he was named interim manager in Segunda División.[13] Two days later he appeared in his first professional match, a 1–0 home win against Elche CF.[14]

De los Mozos returned to his previous duties after the appointment of Claudio Barragán, but after the latter's dismissal on 18 January 2017, he was again named manager.[15] On 28 March, after only one win in ten matches, he was relieved from his duties.
