In ancient Greek religion and mythology, the ERINYES (; sing. ERINYS , ;[1] , pl. of , _Erinys_),[2] also known as the FURIES, were female chthonic deities of vengeance, sometimes referred to as "infernal goddesses" (). A formulaic oath in the _Iliad_ invokes them as "the Erinyes, that under earth take vengeance on men, whosoever hath sworn a false oath."[3] Walter Burkert suggests they are "an embodiment of the act of self-cursing contained in the oath."[4] They correspond to the DIRAE in Roman mythology.[5] The Roman writer Maurus Servius Honoratus wrote that they are called "Eumenides" in hell, "Furiae" on earth, and "Dirae" in heaven.[6][7]

According to Hesiod's _Theogony_, when the Titan Cronus castrated his father, Uranus, and threw his genitalia into the sea, the Erinyes (along with the Giants and the Meliae) emerged from the drops of blood which fell on the earth (Gaia), while Aphrodite was born from the crests of sea foam.[8] According to variant accounts,[9] they emerged from an even more primordial level—from Nyx ("Night"), or from a union between air and mother earth.[10] Their number is usually left indeterminate. Virgil, probably working from an Alexandrian source, recognized three: Alecto or Alekto ("endless"), Megaera ("jealous rage"), and Tisiphone or Tilphousia ("vengeful destruction"), all of whom appear in the _Aeneid_. Dante Alighieri followed Virgil in depicting the same three-character triptych of Erinyes; in Canto IX of the _Inferno_ they confront the poets at the gates of the city of Dis. Whilst the Erinyes were usually described as three maiden goddesses, the Erinys Telphousia was usually a by-name for the wrathful goddess Demeter, who was worshipped under the title of Erinys in the Arkadian town of Thelpousa.


Etymology

The word _Erinyes_ is of uncertain etymology; connections with the verb ὀρίνειν _orinein_, "to raise, stir, excite", and the noun ἔρις _eris_, "strife" have been suggested; Beekes, pp. 458–459, has proposed a Pre-Greek origin. The word _Erinys_ in the singular and as a theonym is first attested in Mycenaean Greek, written in Linear B, in the following forms: , _e-ri-nu_, and , _e-ri-nu-we_. These words are found on the KN Fp 1, KN V 52,[11] and KN Fh 390 tablets.[12]


Description

The Erinyes live in Erebus and are more ancient than any of the Olympian deities. Their task is to hear complaints brought by mortals against the insolence of the young to the aged, of children to parents, of hosts to guests, and of householders or city councils to suppliants—and to punish such crimes by hounding culprits relentlessly. The Erinyes are crones and, depending upon authors, described as having snakes for hair, dog's heads, coal black bodies, bat's wings, and blood-shot eyes. In their hands they carry brass-studded scourges, and their victims die in torment.[13]


Three sisters

According to some sources, the three classic Furies sprang forth from the spilled blood of Uranus when he was castrated by his son Cronus. The sisters are:

-   Alecto – Punisher of moral crimes (anger, etc.)
-   Megaera – Punisher of infidelity, oath breakers, and theft
-   Tisiphone – Punisher of murderers


Cult

Pausanias describe a sanctuary in Athens dedicated to the Erinyes under the name Semnai:

    "Hard by [the Areopagos the murder court of Athens] is a sanctuary of the goddesses which the Athenians call the August, but Hesiod in the Theogony calls them Erinyes (Furies). It was Aeschylus who first represented them with snakes in their hair. But on the images neither of these nor of any of the under-world deities is there anything terrible. There are images of Pluto, Hermes, and Earth, by which sacrifice those who have received an acquittal on the Hill of Ares; sacrifices are also offered on other occasions by both citizens and aliens."[14]


In ancient Greek literature

Tantalizing myth fragments dealing with the Erinyes are found among the earliest extant records of ancient Greek culture. The Erinyes are featured prominently in the myth of Orestes, which recurs frequently throughout many works of ancient Greek literature.

Aeschylus

Featured in ancient Greek literature, from poems to plays, the Erinyes form the Chorus and play a major role in the conclusion of Aeschylus's dramatic trilogy the _Oresteia_. In the first play, _Agamemnon_, King Agamemnon returns home from the Trojan War, where he is slain by his wife, Clytemnestra, who wants vengeance for her daughter Iphigenia, who was sacrificed by Agamemnon in order to obtain favorable winds to sail to Troy. In the second play, _The Libation Bearers_, their son Orestes has reached manhood and has been commanded by Apollo's oracle to avenge his father's murder at his mother’s hand. Returning home and revealing himself to his sister Electra, Orestes pretends to be a messenger bringing the news of his own death to Clytemnestra. He then slays his mother and her lover Aegisthus. Although Orestes’ actions were what Apollo had commanded him to do, Orestes has still committed matricide, a grave sacrilege.[15] Because of this, he is pursued and tormented by the terrible Erinyes, who demand yet further blood vengeance.[16]

In _The Eumenides_, Orestes is told by Apollo at Delphi that he should go to Athens to seek the aid of the goddess Athena. In Athens, Athena arranges for Orestes to be tried by a jury of Athenian citizens, with her presiding. The Erinyes appear as Orestes' accusers, while Apollo speaks in his defense. The trial becomes a debate about the necessity of blood vengeance, the honor that is due to a mother compared to that due to a father, and the respect that must be paid to ancient deities such as the Erinyes compared to the newer generation of Apollo and Athena. The jury vote is evenly split. Athena participates in the vote and chooses for acquittal. Athena declares Orestes acquitted because of the rules she established for the trial.[17] Despite the verdict, the Erinyes threaten to torment all inhabitants of Athens and to poison the surrounding countryside. Athena, however, offers the ancient goddesses a new role, as protectors of justice, rather than vengeance, and of the city. She persuades them to break the cycle of blood for blood (except in the case of war, which is fought for glory, not vengeance). While promising that the goddesses will receive due honor from the Athenians and Athena, she also reminds them that she possesses the key to the storehouse where Zeus keeps the thunderbolts that defeated the other older deities. This mixture of bribes and veiled threats satisfies the Erinyes, who are then led by Athena in a procession to their new abode. In the play, the "Furies" are thereafter addressed as "Semnai" (Venerable Ones), as they will now be honored by the citizens of Athens and ensure the city's prosperity.[18]

Euripides

In Euripides' _Orestes_ the Erinyes are for the first time "equated" with the EUMENIDES[19] (Εὐμενίδες, pl. of Εὐμενίς; literally "the gracious ones", but also translated as "Kindly Ones").[20] This is because it was considered unwise to mention them by name (for fear of attracting their attention), the ironic name is similar to how Hades, god of the dead is styled Pluton, or Pluto, "the Rich One".[21] Using euphemisms for the names of deities serves many religious purposes.

Sophocles

In Sophocles's play, _Oedipus at Colonus_, it is significant that he comes to his final resting place in the grove dedicated to the Erinyes. It shows that he has paid his penance for his blood crime, as well as come to integrate the balancing powers to his early over-reliance upon Apollo, the god of the individual, the sun, and reason. He is asked to make an offering to the Erinyes and complies, having made his peace.

The Erinyes persist as a theme that appears in modern literature. They are mentioned in the poem "To Brooklyn Bridge" by Hart Crane. The Eumenides are also featured in T. S. Eliot's play, _The Family Reunion_, Neil Gaiman's comic book series, _The Sandman_, and Rick Riordan's novel, _The Lightning Thief_. In the comic opera Trial by Jury (1875) words W.S. Gilbert music Arthur Sullivan the Learned Judge describes himself as having once "danced a dance like a semi-despondent fury" while in Westminster Hall.
