LESLIE CONWAY "LESTER" BANGS (December 14, 1948 – April 30, 1982)[1] was an American music journalist, critic, author, and musician. He wrote for _Creem_ and _Rolling Stone_ magazines, and was known for his leading influence in rock music criticism.[2][3] The music critic Jim DeRogatis called him "America's greatest rock critic".[4]


Biography

Early life

Bangs was born in Escondido, California. He was the son of Norma Belle (_née_ Clifton) and Conway Leslie Bangs, a truck driver.[5] Both of his parents were from Texas: his father from Enloe and his mother from Pecos County.[6] Norma Belle was a devout Jehovah's Witness. Conway died in a fire when his son was young. When Bangs was 11, he moved with his mother to El Cajon, also in San Diego County.[7] His early interests and influences ranged from the Beats (particularly William S. Burroughs) and jazz musician John Coltrane and Miles Davis, to comic books and science fiction.[8] He had a connection with _The San Diego Door_, an underground newspaper of the late 1960s.

_Rolling Stone_ magazine

Bangs became a freelance writer in 1969, after reading an ad in _Rolling Stone_ soliciting readers' reviews. His first piece was a negative review of the MC5 album _Kick Out the Jams_, which he sent to _Rolling Stone_ with a note requesting, if the magazine were to decline to publish the review, that he be given a reason for the decision; no reply was forthcoming, as the magazine did indeed publish the review.

His 1970 review of Black Sabbath's first album in _Rolling Stone_ was scathing, rating them as imitators of the band Cream:

Bangs wrote about the death of Janis Joplin in 1970 from a drug overdose: "It's not just that this kind of early death has become a fact of life that has become disturbing, but that it's been accepted as a given so quickly."[9]

In 1973, Jann Wenner fired Bangs from _Rolling Stone_ for "disrespecting musicians" after a particularly harsh review of the group Canned Heat.[10]

_Creem_ magazine

Bangs began freelancing for Detroit-based _Creem_ in 1970.[11] In 1971, he wrote a feature for _Creem_ on Alice Cooper, and soon afterward he moved to Detroit. Named _Creem_'s editor in 1971,[12] Bangs fell in love with Detroit, calling it "rock's only hope", and remained there for five years.[13]

During the early 1970s, Bangs and some other writers at _Creem_ began using the term _punk rock_ to designate the genre of 1960s garage bands and more contemporary acts, such as MC5 and Iggy and the Stooges.[14][15] Their writings would provide some of the conceptual framework for the later punk and new wave movements that emerged in New York, London, and elsewhere later in the decade.[16][17] They would be quick to pick up on these new movements at their inception and provide extensive coverage of the phenomenon. Bangs was enamored of the noise music of Lou Reed,[18] and _Creem_ gave significant exposure to artists such as Reed, David Bowie, Roxy Music, Captain Beefheart, Blondie, Brian Eno, and the New York Dolls years earlier than the mainstream press. Bangs wrote the essay/interview "Let Us Now Praise Famous Death Dwarves" about Reed in 1975.[19] _Creem_ was also among the earliest publications to give sizable coverage to hard rock and metal artists such as Motörhead, Kiss, Judas Priest, and Van Halen.

Freelance career

After leaving _Creem_ in 1976, he wrote for _The Village Voice_, _Penthouse_, _Playboy_, _New Musical Express_, and many other publications.

Writing in _Stereo Review_, Bangs described the album _Funky Kingston_ by Toots and the Maytals as "perfection, the most exciting and diversified set of reggae tunes by a single artist yet released".[20]

Death

Bangs died in New York City on April 30, 1982, at the age of 33, of an accidental overdose of dextropropoxyphene (an opioid analgesic), diazepam (a benzodiazapine), and NyQuil.[21][22]


Writing style

Bangs's criticism was filled with cultural references, not only to rock music but also to literature and philosophy.[23] He was known for his radical and critical style of working, apparent in this quotation:

On one occasion, while the J. Geils Band were playing in concert, Bangs climbed onto the stage, typewriter in hand, and typed a supposed review of the event, in full view of the audience.[24]

In 1979, writing for the Village Voice, Bangs wrote a poignant piece about the White supremacy from a Punk music scene perspective, called "The white noise supremacists".[25]


Music

Bangs was also a musician in his own right. In 1976, he and Peter Laughner recorded an acoustic improvisation in the _Creem_ office. The recording included covers/parodies of songs like "Sister Ray" and "Pale Blue Eyes", both by the Velvet Underground.

In 1977, Bangs recorded, as a solo artist, a 7" vinyl single named "Let It Blurt/Live", mixed by John Cale and released in 1979.

In 1977, at the famous New York City nightclub, CBGB's, while Bangs was talking to guitarist Mickey Leigh, Joey Ramone's brother, the idea for a band named "Birdland" came to fruition. Although they both had their roots in jazz, the two wanted to create an old school rock & roll group. Leigh brought in his post-punk band, The Rattlers (David Merrill on bass; Matty Quick on drums), and cut "Birdland with Lester Bangs". The recording took place at the under renovation Electric Lady Studios. Bassist David Merrill, who was working on the construction of the studio, had the keys to the building and they snuck the band in on April Fool's Day, 1979 for an impromptu and somewhat illegal late night recording session. The end result was a completely uncut and un-dubbed recording that displayed completely raw music. Birdland broke up within two months of this rare recording (in which the cassette tape from the session became the master, mixed by Ed Stasium and released by Leigh only in 1986).

In 1980 Lester Bangs traveled to Austin, Texas, and met a surf/punk rock group "The Delinquents". In early December of the same year, they recorded an album as "Lester Bangs and the Delinquents", entitled _Jook Savages on the Brazos_, released the following year.

In 1990 the Mekons released the EP _F.U.N. 90_ with Bangs' declamation in the song "One Horse Town".
