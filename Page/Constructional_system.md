A CONSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEM or a CONSTITUTION SYSTEM is a system of objects or concepts of a certain domain in which all objects or concepts of that domain can be logically constructed from a proper subset of those objects or concepts, called the _basis_ of the system. [1]

German philosopher Rudolf Carnap in his _Der logische Aufbau der Welt_ (1928) (referring to them as "Konstitutionssystems") and American philosopher Nelson Goodman in his _The Structure of Appearance_ (1951) studied the structure of constructional systems.
