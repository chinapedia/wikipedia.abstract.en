The DIOCESAN MUSEUM OF BRESCIA is a museum in Italy dedicated to the artistic patrimony of the Diocese of Brescia, and is located in the greater cloister of the Monastery of Saint Joseph in via Gasparo Salò, a short distance from the _Piazza della Loggia_.

The museum, founded in 1978 by Bishop Luigi Morstabilini, contains numerous works of art from the entire diocesan territory, throughout the province of Brescia, including paintings, sculpture, gold and silver work, and liturgical vestments. In addition, the museum is the usual setting for the exposition of sacred art in the region.


History

The idea for the creation of a museum for the diocese of Brescia first developed in the 1970s. The initiative was taken up by Monsignor Angelo Pietrobelli who identified the greater cloister of Saint Joseph as a site sufficiently spacious and prestigious. The diocese's acquisition of the property was lengthy and complicated, and ultimately required special governmental legislation.

On December 23, 1978 the bishop of Brescia, Luigi Morstabilini, inaugurated a canonical religious foundation known as the "Diocesan Museum of Sacred Art".

On April 21, 1988 the bishop of Brescia, Bruno Foresti, substituted the old statute with a new one, to which, in addition to the collection and preservation of diocesan works of art that might be in danger of dispersion or ruin, he added initiatives of restoration as well as of cultural and educational outreach. Also, thanks to Bishop Foresti, the greater cloister of Saint Joseph was completely restored. The newer statute, revised by Bishop Giulio Sanguineti, was the basis for the civil recognition of the religious foundation.

From February 2010 the Diocesan Museum of Brescia has been recognized by the Italian state as a _Fondazione di Religione e di Culto_.


Works

The museum is divided into four sections:

-   The diocesan gallery;
