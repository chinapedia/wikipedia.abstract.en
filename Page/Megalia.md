MEGALIA () was a radical feminist online community based in South Korea.


Overview

In the spring of 2015, South Korean Internet forum DC Inside started "MERS Gallery" as a forum for sharing information on the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak.

When a false rumor spread that two women who may have contracted the MERS disease refused quarantine to go on a shopping trip to Hong Kong, it prompted bashing in this forum. These supposed health code violators were derided using the term "Kimchi woman" (; _gimchi-nyeo_), a stereotype for the female gender who only has shopping on her mind.[1]

As this situation continued, an influx of feminist users started using offensive terms, coining "Kimchi man" (; _gimchi-nam_) a counterpart male-bashing term which mocks Korean males in general. DC Inside intervened by instituting a language policy, forbidding use of "Kimchi man". The feminist users regarded the measure as discriminatory, and finding these rules too constraining for posting their rhetoric, moved to other forums at DC Inside, and eventually, launched their own website, "Megalia". The name "Megalia" is a portmanteau of "MERS Gallery" and "_Egalia's Daughters_", a feminist novel by Gerd Brantenberg.[2][3]


Culture

In Megalia, there are several boards, including the "best" board, "new posts" board, "Menyeom (meaning suitable for Megalia) board", "news" board, "data" board, "lecture" board, "capture" board, "humor" board, and "free" board.[4]

When it was founded Megalia claimed that it was a feminist website and that its goal was to "promote women's rights and remove misogyny widespread in the Korean society."

Megalia began a movement to halt the porn-sharing site SoraNet (소라넷)'s practice which permitted uploads of privacy-violating secretly photographed video content, and has moved on to petition the shutdown of the site itself, which was notorious for various types of illicit pornographic content.[5] Eventually, SoraNet was shutdown.[6][7]


Controversies

Megalia is widely perceived as an extremist, feminist community, which consciously mirrors the misogynistic language deployed in male-dominated forums like Ilbe.[8] To critics, Megalians’ mirroring tactic is hateful and misandrist; to supporters, they are reclaiming a male-centered language that threatens and diminishes women.[9]

Many, including some feminists, say Megalia’s tactics have opened the group up to accusations of misandry, and exacerbate the gender wars.[10] Although Megalia users claim that their misandric posts are a countermeasure against particular misogynists, most of the target are all Korean men. Megalia users make extreme posts which exceeds that of the websites that show a misogynist nature such as Ilbe. This raises a question whether they are simply expressing misandry rather than a countermeasure against misogyny. They show a high level of homophobia and treat transgender individuals differently. That includes outing gay men who are married to women.[11][12][13][14]

On October 17, 2015, one user, who was a kindergarten teacher, uploaded a salacious post declaring their desire to have sex with a _Jonnini_ 좆린이, which is slang for a very young male child. This caused an uproar, especially after her identity was outed, even though she had posted anonymously. The poster (referred to in the media as "Ms. A") later addressed this, and while admitting the gravity of her message which caused serious concerns, explained that she was merely trying to bring awareness to the fact that male-dominated boards such as Ilbe routinely discuss sexual desires for underage girls (referred to as _lolini_ 로린이 ("Lolita girl").[15]

Users of Megalia have posted gory images of sliced penises, and mocked war heroes who died in the Korean War.[16] Megalia promotes abortion of male fetuses.[17] One of Megalia's activities is the manipulation of public opinion. Megalia users share news articles’ URLs and manipulate comment sections led by their administrative team with a suggested guideline.[18] Since December 2015, administrators and financial backers of the website have continuously received criticism on their lack of transparency, but no official statement has been released.[19]

On October 2018, following the Isu Station assault case, more than 129,500 Koreans signed an online petition asking for the presidential office to take measure against the extremist feminist communities, including Womad and Megalia.[20]
