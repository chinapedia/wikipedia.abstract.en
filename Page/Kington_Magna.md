KINGTON MAGNA is a village and civil parish in the Blackmore Vale in the English county of Dorset, situated about south-west of the town of Gillingham, in the North Dorset administrative district.


History

The name Kington Magna means 'great King's Town';[1][2] it derives from _cyne-_ (later _cyning_) and _tÅ«n_, Old English for 'royal estate or manor'. The affix _magna_, Latin for great, was added to distinguish it from Little Kington, a smaller settlement nearby.[3][4] In 1086 in the Domesday Book these were recorded together in three entries as _Chintone_, which had 27 households and a total taxable value of 13 geld units, and was in the hundred of Gillingham.[5][6] In 1243 it was recorded as Magna Kington.[7] Most of the current buildings in the village are no older than the seventeenth century. In 1851 a Primitive Methodist chapel was built in the village; it was on Chapel Hill, which runs parallel to Church Hill.[8] In 1860 a pottery was established at Bye Farm, north of the main village; it manufactured tiles, drainpipes, bricks, and chimney and flower pots. The parish church of All Saints was restored and enlarged in 1862;[9] most of the building, except for the late 15th-century west tower, was rebuilt.[10] Near the church is a pond which was a medieval fishpond.[11]


Geography

The parish covers about and, as well as the main village, includes the small settlement of Nyland in the west.[12] The main village is sited on the slopes of a Corallian limestone hill,[13] overlooking the flat Oxford Clay valley of the small River Cale, which drains into the Stour. In 1906 Sir Frederick Treves wrote in his _Highways & Byways in Dorset_ that the village "straggles down hill like a small mountain stream."[14]


Demography

In the 2011 census the parish had 180 dwellings,[15] 169 households and a population of 389.[16]
