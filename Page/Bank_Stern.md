History

Antoine Jacob Stern and his brother LÃ©opold Stern (1810-1846) create in June 1842 the investment bank _A. J. Stern & Cie_, at 33 rue Laffitte, Paris to formed one of the ten main investment banks in Europe with their cousins who formed in 1844 the _Stern Brothers_ in London.

In the 20th century the Stern family was a shareholder of the Banque de France and was one of the main banking families in Paris with Lazard and Rothschild & Co in France. In 1977-1978, the bank Rothschild takes 48% of shareholders of Bank Stern.

During the 1980s, Edouard Stern take the control of the family bank and revamped the bank, expanding its activity in financial markets, as well as in mergers and acquisitions.[1] In 1985, Stern sold the bank for 300 million francs[2] ($60 million in 2005 dollars) to Lebanese investors and become Bank Pallas-Stern. Thanks to a clause attached to the contract, Stern got to keep the copyright over his last name Stern. Immediately after the sale went through, Stern started a new bank,[3] with a similar name and business profile, drawing in many of his former clients. He sold this second institution for an estimated 1.75 billion francs [4] in 1988 to the Swiss Bank Corporation (SBS, which will later merge with UBS to form UBS S.A.). As a result of these transactions, Stern shot up the ranks of the richest families in France, occupying the 38th spot, according to Forbes.[5] In 2011 the trademark was purchased by investors to continue the activities of Investment bank and a multi family office in Paris called Stern & Cie [6]
