Early life

Legendary wrestler Rustam-e-Hind Mangla Rai was born in the month of October, 1916 in a humble farmer’s family of Joga Musahib Village in Ghazipur district of Uttar Pradesh. His father Ramchandra Rai and his uncle Radha Rai, were also well-known wrestlers. After attaining 16 years of age he joined police services as constable but his destiny was waiting for something very different and significant. He left his job and moved to Barma (Myanmar) where his father and uncle were residing and pursuing their professional careers. In Rangoon, Mangla started taking lessons in wrestling. In those days the great wrestler Shiv Murat Tiwari of Benaras was also practicing in an Akhara in Rangoon. He saw the physique of this young aspirant and began to train him. Shiv Murat Tiwari made Mangala a master of south-east Asian moves of wrestling. After a few years Mangla Rai came back to his motherland but he never forgot his first guru. He named his elder daughter 'Shiv Murat' paying gratitude to his guru.[1]
