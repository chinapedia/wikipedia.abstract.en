The 1981 CORK SENIOR HURLING CHAMPIONSHIP was the 93rd staging of the Cork Senior Hurling Championship since its establishment by the Cork County Board in 1887. The championship began on 10 May 1981 and ended on 13 September 1981.

St. Finbarr's entered the championship as the defending champions.

On 13 September 1981, St. Finbarr's won the championship following a 1-12 to 1-09 defeat of Glen Rovers in the final. This was their 21st championship title overall and their second title in succession.[1]

Christy Ryan from the St, Finbarr's club was the championship's top scorer with 6-05.


Format change

At the County Convention on 25 January 1981, it was decided to end the three-year experiment of playing the championship on a league basis in the preliminary rounds and reverted to an open, seeded draw. The four semi-finalists from the 1980 championship (Midleton, Blackrock, St. Finbarr's and Glen Rovers) were the four seeded teams and were separated in the quarter-final stage.

Miscellaneous

-   After two postponements due to inclement weather, the Midleton-Carrigdhoun second round game was finally played on 21 June 1981. That game featured a 28-minute delay as a number of Carrigdhoun players were caught in heavy traffic in Cork.
-   At a meeting on 30 June 1981, the Cork County Board ordered that the quarter-final between Glen Rovers and Youghal be replayed. Glen Rovers won the initial game, however, Youghal objected, alleging that one of the Glen players, Red Crowley, was under suspension on the date of the match. The board upheld the objection after an investigation.
