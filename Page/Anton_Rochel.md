ANTON ROCHEL (18 June 1770, in Neunkirchen – 12 May 1847, in Graz) was an Austrian surgeon and naturalist, known for his botanical investigations of Banat and the Carpathians.

Up until 1798 he served as a surgeon in the Austrian army, then from 1798 to 1820 worked as a physician in Moravia and Hungary. From 1820 to 1840 he was a curator at the botanical garden in Pest.[1] The botanical genus _Rochelia_ (family Boraginaceae) was named in his honor by Ludwig Reichenbach.[2]
