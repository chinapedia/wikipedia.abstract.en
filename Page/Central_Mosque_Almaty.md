ALMATY CENTRAL MOSQUE () is one of the largest mosques in Almaty, and in Kazakhstan. Designed for 7000 visitors, it was built on the site of the old mosque that dated to 1890 and caught fire in 1987. The foundation of the mosque was laid in 1993.[1] Construction was completed in 1999.[2] In 2000, the large dome was decorated by verses from the Quran rendered by Turkish calligraphers.

On December 22, 2006, the National Bank of Kazakhstan depicted the mosque on a limited-edition 500-tenge coin of sterling silver.
