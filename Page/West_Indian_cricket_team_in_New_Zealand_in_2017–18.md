The West Indies cricket team toured New Zealand in December 2017 and January 2018 to play two Tests, three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches.[1][2][3] Three Tests were originally planned, but it was reduced to two by New Zealand Cricket (NZC) to conform to the expected tour make-up when the ICC World Test Championship is implemented.[4][5] Ahead of the Test series, a three-day tour match was planned, which started on 25 November 2017.[6]

New Zealand won the Test series 2–0[7] and the ODI series 3–0.[8] New Zealand also won the T20I series 2–0, after the second match was washed out with no result possible.[9] It was the first time since January 2000 that the West Indies failed to win a single match during a tour to New Zealand.[10] With the 2–0 victory in the T20I series, New Zealand returned to the top of the ICC T20I Championship.[11]
