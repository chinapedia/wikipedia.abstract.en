The ACCADEMIA DI BELLE ARTI DI MACERATA is an academy of fine arts located in Macerata, Italy. It was founded in 1972.[1]

Initially, the Accademia was located in the Palazzo Buonaccorsi. After the Umbria and Marche earthquake of 1997, it was moved to its current location, in an 18th-century former convent.[2] Among its directors were painters and art critics, including Remo Brindisi.[3]
