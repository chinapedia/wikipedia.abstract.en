The next year they again won Nordic, beating the _Svedjan_ and _Kastrup_.[4] In 2013 the VISMANN took silver (a milder version of Kraftkar).[5] During _World Cheese Awards_ 2014 in London, they won bronze with the EDEL FRUE (soft white) and MILD MESTER (semi-hard white).[6] Mild Mester was in 2015 made a "Super Gold" and among 62 cheeses nominated to win _World Cheese Awards_ 2015 in Birmingham, Edel frue and Vismann taking bronse, while Kraftkar won silver.

Background

It was founded in 2003 by the Waagen family in conjunction with the _Saghaug Gård_, a farm dating from the 1300s.[8] Production manager Egil Smith-Meyer, chief executive officer is Kristin Waagen, daughter of farmer Gunnar Waagen and senior cheese maker Solvår Waagen who describes production as handmade (no machinery).

The startup was partially due to minister of agriculture Lars Sponheim in 2003 allowing milk farmers to make cheese from their own milk (not from the TINE quota).[9]
