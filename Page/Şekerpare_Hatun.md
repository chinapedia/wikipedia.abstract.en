ŞEKERPARE HATUN () was a lady-in-waiting to Sultan Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire.


Career

Şekerpare, who was previously known as Şehsuvar, began her career as the Hazinedar Usta (treasurer) of the imperial harem. She was later appointed Kethüde Hatun (mistress housekeeper).

In 1644 the Grand vizier Kemankeş Mustafa Pasha's standing was threatened by a powerful faction which was controlling the appointment and dismissal of certain individuals, even enriching its members in the process. This party included Şekerpare as well as Ibrahim's other male favourites. Mustafa Pasha was executed and Ibrahim appointed his favourite Sultanzade Mehmed Pasha as the new Grand Vizier.

It was known that Ebezade Hamide Hatun, wife of Hasan Pasha, the governor of Aleppo, was a friend of Şekerpare Hatun.


Personal life

In 1647, Şekerpare married Grand vizier Kara Musa Pasha, and because of her, he was appointed to the position of Grand Admiral. The treasure of Egypt was lavished on Ibrahims favourite wives and women, which also included Şekerpare. A house was also bought for her. In early 1648 she endowed a fountain in Istanbul, and commissioned the building of her own mausoleum at Eyüp. After Ibrahim's deposition in 1648, women of Ibrahim's harem were sent to the Old Palace. However, Şekerpare Hatun was exiled to Egypt. The mausoleum that she had commissioned remained empty.
