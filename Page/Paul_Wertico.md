During his time with Metheny, Wertico played on ten albums and four videos, appeared on television, and toured around the world.

In 2009, Wertico became a member of the jazz-rock group Marbin with Israeli musicians Danny Markovitch and Dani Rabin. The group performed as Paul Wertico's Mid-East/Mid-West Alliance and recorded an album for the Chicago Sessions label that received accolades from the _Chicago Tribune_, _DRUM!_, and _Modern Drummer_.

Critical reception

Wertico's debut CD as a leader, _The Yin and the Yout_, received a four-star rating in _DownBeat_. His 1998 trio CD, _Live in Warsaw!_, received four and a half stars from _DownBeat_ and featured guitarist John Moulder and bassist Eric Hochberg. The trio's 2000 studio recording, entitled _Don't Be Scared Anymore_, received reviews of "This album is like the soundtrack to the world's coolest vacation" from _All About Jazz_ and "Jazz-rock in the truest sense" from _Allmusic_.

Wertico's 2004 CD, _StereoNucleosis_, was released to extremely positive reviews. The _Chicago Tribune_ wrote: "A brilliant release – Wertico shows a thrilling disregard for stylistic boundaries. _StereoNucleosis_ is one of the most intelligent, creative and alluring percussion recordings of the past decade. Wertico reaffirms his position among the most restlessly inventive drummers working today." _Allmusic_ reported: "Wertico and his players have done something wonderful and rare: they've actually created something not only different, but also truly new." _LA Weekly_ wrote: "His recent records, such as 2000's _Don't Be Scared Anymore_ and the new _StereoNucleosis_ are stunning examples of the electronic, rhythmic and intellectual directions jazz could be going." Wertico's 2006 CD, _Another Side_, was released on the audiophile Naim Label; it was described as "a brilliant collaborative effort between these three uniquely talented musicians."

His 2010 CD, _Impressions of a City_, featuring his band, Paul Wertico's Mid-East/Mid-West Alliance, has been described in reviews as "One of the most impressively spontaneous albums you'll find on this planet – or any other"; "Haunting and memorable…an engaging musical experiment and one that is highly unique."; "This is musical narrative at its finest. A fanfare for the common (and mechanically exploited) 21st century man and woman."; "Sometimes beautiful, other times tense or just plain spooky, _Impressions of a City_ ought to go some way toward correcting the dubious reputation of avant-garde music."; "A wildly unpredictable journey into one man's apparently inexhaustible sonic imagination."

_DownBeat_ magazine awarded it four and a half stars, listed it as of the Best CDs of 2010, and wrote "What makes the music work is not only that Wertico is not content to just "play it straight" as a drummer but that his skills as a conceptualist/leader may even be greater. A heads-up for all budding drummers (check out Wertico's inventive pause of a solo on "My Side of the Story") who would like to hear and create music that goes beyond just keeping time."

This band also released a live in concert DVD, entitled _Live from SPACE_, that has been reviewed by the _Chicago Examiner_ as "More than setting tones, moods, and the stage for future, like-minded experimentation, these talented musicians have managed to also push the limits of what jazz can be, while entertaining a wider form of audience."; and thiszine.org wrote "For Wertico fans, this DVD is a must have, showcasing innovative, finely tuned jazz talent. For new fans of modern jazz, this would be a staple, and a great place to start before your journey backwards."

In 2007 Wertico and Brian Peters released their CD, _Ampersand_, which Drummerszone.com called "Simply a musical masterpiece" and _Classic Drummer_ described as "one of the most ambitious records ever released. Recorded over a period of four years, it documents a completely new approach to combine elements of both rock and jazz music while resulting in a very listenable and captivating final product." That same year he released _Jazz Impressions 1_ with pianist Silvano Monasterios and bassist Mark Egan. _Chicago Jazz_ wrote: "From the first note of _Jazz Impressions 1_, you know you're in for something interesting and different. What these three do with that format, however, is nothing short of breathtaking."
