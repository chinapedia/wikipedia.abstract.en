A bomb explosion occurred at the shrine of Ali al-Ridha, the eighth Imam of Shia, on 20 June 1994 in a crowded prayer hall in Mashhad, Iran. To maximize the amount of casualties, the explosion took place on Ashura, one of the holiest days for Shia muslims,[1] when hundreds of pilgrims had gathered to commemorate the death of their third Imam, Husayn ibn Ali.[2]

The attack left at least 25 dead and at least 70 injured.[3] The bomb was equivalent to 10 pounds of TNT, according to experts.[4] Although a Sunni group claimed responsibility, the Iranian government laid the blame on the People's Mujahedin of Iran, and others have accused a Pakistani militant.


Bombing

On 20 June, the shrine was crowded with self-flagellating mourners, celebrating Ashura and commemorating the death of Husayn ibn Ali. At 14:26, a bomb exploded in a crowded prayer hall in the women's section of the shrine.[5] _The Independent_ described it as "the first attack on such a holy place" or "the worst terrorist atrocity in Iran since 1981".[6][7] In protest, people gathered outside the mosque and hospitals.[8]

Damage included the destruction of one wall and the prayer hall's dome, and the breaking of crystal chandeliers.[9]


Suspects

The Iranian government blamed the Iraqi-backed People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK).[10] According to IRNA, the official Iranian news agency, a caller claimed responsibility for the event in the name of MEK. However, MEK condemned the attack.[11] Ramzi Yousef, a member of al-Qaeda who was responsible for several terrorist attacks worldwide, was also accused of being responsible, supposedly having been hired by MEK.[12][13][14] According to an anonymous US official, Yousef built the bomb and MEK agents placed it in the shrine.[15] According to the analysts, he was suspected of having connections with MEK because of his Iraqi background.[16] However, Raymond Tanter, a member of the United States National Security Council under President Ronald Reagan, believes that MEK was not involved, and that a Pakistani militant connected to Yousef was the perpetrator.[17] _News_, A Pakistani daily newspaper, identified that person to be Abdul Shakoor, a young religious radical living in Lyari in Karachi.[18]

A month after the attack, a Sunni group calling itself “al-haraka al-islamiya al-iraniya” claimed responsibility for the attack. Despite this, the Iranian government continued to hold the MEK responsible.[19] According to the National Council of Resistance of Iran, in a trial in November 1999, Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri claimed it was a false flag attack by the Iranian regime to blame MEK.[20][21]


Aftermath

Strict security measures were applied after this attack, and visitors are now searched before entering the shrine.[22] The event caused further political unrest in Iran.[23]


Portrayals

A 2013 play entitled "the picture of Aziz's event" narrated the life of a woman who was going to visit Imam Reza shrine on the day of the bombing.[24]
