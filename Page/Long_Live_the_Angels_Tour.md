Birmingham Show

Several complaints were received by Ticketmaster and Genting Arena following Sande's gig on 25 October. The show was cut considerably short, only lasting one-hour compared to the near two-hour set at all other UK dates.[3] The tour organisers refused to provide any refunds, and Sande herself did not comment, though it is believed vocal strain led to the incident.[4] The original full set list was restored for the final tour date on 27 October.
