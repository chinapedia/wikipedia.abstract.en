_DROSOPHILA_ () is a genus of flies, belonging to the family Drosophilidae, whose members are often called "small fruit flies" or (less frequently) pomace flies, vinegar flies, or wine flies, a reference to the characteristic of many species to linger around overripe or rotting fruit. They should not be confused with the Tephritidae, a related family, which are also called fruit flies (sometimes referred to as "true fruit flies"); tephritids feed primarily on unripe or ripe fruit, with many species being regarded as destructive agricultural pests, especially the Mediterranean fruit fly. One species of _Drosophila_ in particular, _D. melanogaster_, has been heavily used in research in genetics and is a common model organism in developmental biology. The terms "fruit fly" and "_Drosophila_" are often used synonymously with _D. melanogaster_ in modern biological literature. The entire genus, however, contains more than 1,500 species[1] and is very diverse in appearance, behavior, and breeding habitat.


Etymology

The term "_Drosophila_", meaning "dew-loving", is a modern scientific Latin adaptation from Greek words , __, "dew", and , __, "loving" with the Latin feminine suffix _-a_.


Morphology

_Drosophila_ species are small flies, typically pale yellow to reddish brown to black, with red eyes. Many species, including the noted Hawaiian picture-wings, have distinct black patterns on the wings. The plumose (feathery) arista, bristling of the head and thorax, and wing venation are characters used to diagnose the family. Most are small, about 2–4 mm long, but some, especially many of the Hawaiian species, are larger than a house fly.


Lifecycle and ecology

Habitat

_Drosophila_ species are found all around the world, with more species in the tropical regions. _Drosophila_ made their way to the Hawaiian Islands and radiated into over 800 species.[2] They can be found in deserts, tropical rainforest, cities, swamps, and alpine zones. Some northern species hibernate. Most species breed in various kinds of decaying plant and fungal material, including fruit, bark, slime fluxes, flowers, and mushrooms. The larvae of at least one species, _D. suzukii_, can also feed in fresh fruit and can sometimes be a pest.[3] A few species have switched to being parasites or predators. Many species can be attracted to baits of fermented bananas or mushrooms, but others are not attracted to any kind of baits. Males may congregate at patches of suitable breeding substrate to compete for the females, or form leks, conducting courtship in an area separate from breeding sites.

Several _Drosophila_ species, including _D. melanogaster_, _D. immigrans_, and _D. simulans_, are closely associated with humans, and are often referred to as domestic species. These and other species (_D. subobscura_, _Zaprionus indianus_[4][5][6]) have been accidentally introduced around the world by human activities such as fruit transports. Drosophila_residua_head.jpg

Reproduction

Males of this genus are known to have the longest sperm cells of any studied organism on Earth, including one species, _Drosophila bifurca_, that has sperm cells that are long.[7] The cells are mostly tail, and are delivered to the females in tangled coils. The other members of the genus _Drosophila_ also make relatively few giant sperm cells, with that of _D. bifurca_ being the longest.[8] _D. melanogaster_ sperm cells are a more modest 1.8 mm long, although this is still about 35 times longer than a human sperm. Several species in the _D. melanogaster_ species group are known to mate by traumatic insemination.[9]

_Drosophila_ species vary widely in their reproductive capacity. Those such as _D. melanogaster_ that breed in large, relatively rare resources have ovaries that mature 10–20 eggs at a time, so that they can be laid together on one site. Others that breed in more-abundant but less nutritious substrates, such as leaves, may only lay one egg per day. The eggs have one or more respiratory filaments near the anterior end; the tips of these extend above the surface and allow oxygen to reach the embryo. Larvae feed not on the vegetable matter itself, but on the yeasts and microorganisms present on the decaying breeding substrate. Development time varies widely between species (between 7 and more than 60 days) and depends on the environmental factors such as temperature, breeding substrate, and crowding. Fruit flies lay eggs in response to environmental cycles. Eggs laid at a time (e.g., night) during which likelihood of survival is greater than in eggs laid at other times (e.g., day) yield more larvae than eggs that were laid at those times. _Ceterus paribus_, the habit of laying eggs at this 'advantageous' time would yield more surviving offspring, and more grandchildren, than the habit of laying eggs during other times. This differential reproductive success would cause _D. melanogaster_ to adapt to environmental cycles, because this behavior has a major reproductive advantage.[10]

Their median lifespan is 35–45 days.[11]

Mating systems

Courtship behavior

The following section is based on the following _Drosophila_ species: _Drosophila simulans_, and _Drosophila melanogaster_. Courtship behavior of male _Drosophila_ is an attractive behaviour.[12] Females respond via their perception of the behavior portrayed by the male.[13] Male and female _Drosophila_ use innate complex behaviors use a variety of sensory cues to initiate and assess courtship readiness of a potential mate.[14][15][16] The cues include the following behaviours: positioning, pheromone excretion, following females, making tapping sounds with legs, singing, wing spreading, creating wing vibrations, genitalia licking, bending the stomach, attempt to copulate, and the copulatory act itself.[17][18][19][20] The songs of _Drosophila melanogaster_ and _Drosophila simulans_ have been studied extensively. These luring songs are sinusoidal in nature and varies within and between species.[21] The courtship behavior of _Drosophila melanogaster_ has also been assessed for sex-related genes, which have been implicated in courtship behavior in both the male and female.[22] Recent experiments explore the role of fruitless (_fru_) and doublesex (_dsx_), a group of sex-behaviour linked genes.[23][24] This research is currently being explored.

Polyandry

The following section is based on the following _Drosophila_ species: _Drosophila serrata_, _Drosophila pseudoobscura_, _Drosophila melanogaster_, and _Drosophila neotestacea_. Polyandry is a prominent mating system among _Drosophila_.[25][26][27][28] Females mating with multiple sex partners has been a beneficial mating strategy for _Drosophila_.[29][30][31][32] The benefits include both pre and post copulatory mating. Pre-copulatory strategies are the behaviours associated with mate choice and the genetic contributions, such as production of gametes, that are exhibited by both male and female _Drosophila_ regarding mate choice.[33][34] Post copulatory strategies include sperm competition, mating frequency, and sex-ratio meiotic drive.[35][36][37][38] These lists are not inclusive. Polyandry among the _Drosophila pseudoobscura_ in North America vary in their number of mating partners.[39] There is a connection between the number of time females choose to mate and chromosomal variants of the third chromosome.[40] It is believed that the presence of the inverted polymorphism is why re-mating by females occurs.[41] The stability of these polymorphisms may be related to the sex-ratio meiotic drive.[42]

Sperm competition

The following section is based on the following _Drosophila_ species: _Drosophila melanogaster_, _Drosophila simulans_, and _Drosophila mauritiana_. Sperm competition is a process that polyandrous _Drosophila_ females use to increase the fitness of their offspring.[43][44][45][46][47] The female _Drosophila_ has two sperm storage organs that allows her to choose the sperm that will be used to inseminate her eggs.[48] Females have little control when it comes to cryptic female choice.[49][50] Female _Drosophila_ through cryptic choice, one of several post-copulatory mechanisms, which allows for the detection and expelling of sperm that reduces inbreeding possibilities.[51][52] Manier et al. 2013 has categorized the post copulatory sexual selection of _Drosophila melanogaster_, _Drosophila simulans_, and _Drosophila mauritiana_ into the following three stages: insemination, sperm storage, and fertilizable sperm.[53] Among the preceding species there are variations at each stage that play a role in the natural selection process.[54]

Laboratory-cultured animals

_D. melanogaster_ is a popular experimental animal because it is easily cultured en masse out of the wild, has a short generation time, and mutant animals are readily obtainable. In 1906, Thomas Hunt Morgan began his work on _D. melanogaster_ and reported his first finding of a white eyed mutant in 1910 to the academic community. He was in search of a model organism to study genetic heredity and required a species that could randomly acquire genetic mutation that would visibly manifest as morphological changes in the adult animal. His work on _Drosophila_ earned him the 1933 Nobel Prize in Medicine for identifying chromosomes as the vector of inheritance for genes. This and other _Drosophila_ species are widely used in studies of genetics, embryogenesis, chronobiology, speciation, neurobiology, and other areas.

However, some species of _Drosophila_ are difficult to culture in the laboratory, often because they breed on a single specific host in the wild. For some, it can be done with particular recipes for rearing media, or by introducing chemicals such as sterols that are found in the natural host; for others, it is (so far) impossible. In some cases, the larvae can develop on normal _Drosophila_ lab medium, but the female will not lay eggs; for these it is often simply a matter of putting in a small piece of the natural host to receive the eggs. The Drosophila Species Stock Center located at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, maintains cultures of hundreds of species for researchers.[55]

Microbiome

Like other metazoans, _Drosophila_ is associated with various bacteria in its gut. The fly gut microbiota or microbiome seems to have a central influence on _Drosophila_ fitness and life history characteristics. The microbiota in the gut of _Drosophila_ represents an active current research field.

_Drosophila_ species also harbour vertically transmitted endosymbionts such as _Wolbachia_ and _Spiroplasma_. These endosymbionts can act as reproductive manipulators, such as cytoplasmic incompatibility induced by _Wolbachia_ or male-killing induced by the _D. melanogaster Spiroplasma poulsonii_ (named MSRO). The male-killing factor of the _D. melanogaster_ MSRO strain was discovered in 2018, solving a decades-old mystery of the cause of male-killing. This represents the first bacterial factor that affects eukaryotic cells in a sex-specific fashion, and is the first mechanism identified for male-killing phenotypes.[56] Alternatively, they may protect theirs hosts from infection. _Drosophila Wolbachia_ can reduce viral loads upon infection, and is explored as a mechanism of controlling viral diseases (_e.g._ Dengue fever) by transferring these _Wolbachia_ to disease-vector mosquitoes.[57] The _S. poulsonii_ strain of _Drosophila neotestacea_ protects its host from parasitic wasps and nematodes using toxins that preferentially attack the parasites instead of the host.[58][59][60]

Predators

_Drosophila_ species are prey for many generalist predators such as robber flies. In Hawaii, the introduction of yellowjackets from the mainland United States has led to the decline of many of the large species. The larvae are preyed on by other fly larvae, staphylinid beetles, and ants.


Systematics

Drosophila_setosimentum.jpg'', a species of Hawaiian picture-wing fly]] The genus _Drosophila_ as currently defined is paraphyletic (see below) and contains 1,450 described species,[61][62] while the total number of species is estimated at thousands.[63] The majority of the species are members of two subgenera: _Drosophila_ (about 1,100 species) and _Sophophora_ (including _D. (S.) melanogaster_; around 330 species). The Hawaiian species of _Drosophila_ (estimated to be more than 500, with roughly 380 species described) are sometimes recognized as a separate genus or subgenus, _Idiomyia_,[64][65] but this is not widely accepted. About 250 species are part of the genus _Scaptomyza_, which arose from the Hawaiian _Drosophila_ and later recolonized continental areas.

Evidence from phylogenetic studies suggests these genera arose from within the genus _Drosophila_:[66][67]

-   _Liodrosophila_ Duda, 1922
-   _Mycodrosophila_ Oldenburg, 1914
-   _Samoaia_ Malloch, 1934
-   _Scaptomyza_ Hardy, 1849
-   _Zaprionus_ Coquillett, 1901
-   _Zygothrica_ Wiedemann, 1830
-   _Hirtodrosophila_ Duda, 1923 (position uncertain)

Several of the subgeneric and generic names are based on anagrams of _Drosophila_, including _Dorsilopha_, _Lordiphosa_, _Siphlodora_, _Phloridosa_, and _Psilodorha_.


_Drosophila_ species genome project

_Drosophila_ species are extensively used as model organisms in genetics (including population genetics), cell biology, biochemistry, and especially developmental biology. Therefore, extensive efforts are made to sequence drosphilid genomes. The genomes of these species have been fully sequenced:[68]

-   _Drosophila (Sophophora) melanogaster_
-   _Drosophila (Sophophora) simulans_
-   _Drosophila (Sophophora) sechellia_
-   _Drosophila (Sophophora) yakuba_
-   _Drosophila (Sophophora) erecta_
-   _Drosophila (Sophophora) ananassae_
-   _Drosophila (Sophophora) pseudoobscura_
-   _Drosophila (Sophophora) persimilis_
-   _Drosophila (Sophophora) willistoni_
-   _Drosophila (Drosophila) mojavensis_
-   _Drosophila (Drosophila) virilis_
-   _Drosophila (Drosophila) grimshawi_

The data have been used for many purposes, including evolutionary genome comparisons. _D. simulans_ and _D. sechellia_ are sister species, and provide viable offspring when crossed, while _D. melanogaster_ and _D. simulans_ produce infertile hybrid offspring. The _Drosophila_ genome is often compared with the genomes of more distantly related species such as the honeybee _Apis mellifera_ or the mosquito _Anopheles gambiae_.

The modEncode consortium is currently sequencing eight more _Drosophila_ genomes,[69] and even more genomes are being sequenced by the i5K consortium.[70]

Curated data are available at FlyBase.
