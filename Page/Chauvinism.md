CHAUVINISM is a form of extreme patriotism and nationalism and a belief in national superiority and glory. It can be also defined as "an irrational belief in the superiority or dominance of one's own group or people".[1] Moreover, the chauvinist's own people are seen as unique and special while the rest of the people are considered weak or inferior.[2]

According to legend, French soldier Nicolas Chauvin was badly wounded in the Napoleonic Wars. He received a pension for his injuries but it was not enough to live on. After Napoleon abdicated, Chauvin was a fanatical Bonapartist despite the unpopularity of this view in Bourbon Restoration France. His single-minded blind devotion to his cause, despite neglect by his faction and harassment by its enemies, started the use of the term.[3]

_Chauvinism_ has extended from its original use to include fanatical devotion and undue partiality to any group or cause to which one belongs, especially when such partisanship includes prejudice against or hostility toward outsiders or rival groups and persists even in the face of overwhelming opposition.[4][5][6] This French quality finds its parallel in the British term _jingoism_, which has retained the meaning of _chauvinism_ strictly in its original sense; that is, an attitude of belligerent nationalism.[7][8][9]

In modern English, the word has come to be used in some quarters as shorthand for _male chauvinism_, a trend reflected in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary, which, as of 2018, begins its first example of use of the term _chauvinism_ with "an attitude of superiority toward members of the opposite sex".[10][11][12]


As nationalism

In 1945, political theorist Hannah Arendt described the concept thus:


Male chauvinism

Male chauvinism is the belief that men are superior to women. The first documented use of the phrase "male chauvinism" is in the 1935 Clifford Odets play _Till the Day I Die_.[13]

In the workplace

The balance of the workforce changed during World War II. As men left their positions to enlist in the military and fight in the war, women started replacing them. After the war ended, men returned home to find jobs in the workplace, male chauvinism was on the rise, according to Cynthia B. Lloyd. Previously, men had been the main source of labour, and they expected to come back to their previous employments, but they soon realized women had taken over many of their positions to fill the void, says Lloyd.[14]

Lloyd and Michael Korda have argued that as they integrated back into the workforce, men returned to predominate, holding positions of power while women worked as their secretaries, usually typing dictations and answering telephone calls. This division of labor was understood and expected, and women typically felt unable to challenge their position or male superiors, argue Korda and Lloyd.[15][16]

Causes

Chauvinism is seen by some as an influential factor in the TAT, a psychological personality test. Through cross-examinations, the TAT exhibits a tendency toward chauvinistic stimuli for its questions and has the "potential for unfavorable clinical evaluation" for women.[17]

An often cited study done in 1976 by Sherwyn Woods, Some Dynamics of Male Chauvinism, attempts to find the underlying causes of male chauvinism.


Female chauvinism

The term _female chauvinism_ has been adopted by critics of some types or aspects of feminism; second-wave feminist Betty Friedan is a notable example.[18] Ariel Levy used the term in similar, but opposite sense in her book, _Female Chauvinist Pigs_, in which she argues that many young women in the United States and beyond are replicating male chauvinism and older misogynist stereotypes.[19]
