This is a LIST OF CHARACTERS from the American-Japanese animated television series, _HI HI PUFFY AMIYUMI_, which was created by Sam Register, and which originally aired on Cartoon Network from November 19, 2004 to June 27, 2006.


Main characters

Ami Onuki

    Voiced by Janice Kawaye

AMI ONUKI, the older one of the duo is depicted in the show as a 16-year old peppy, optimistic, and cute girl with rose hair and eyes. She favors bubblegum pop and wears a 1960s go-go dress, also sporting a flower in her hair and white knee-high go-go boots. As the optimist, Ami always looks on the bright side of things and finds a solution to every situation (being two years older and more mature).

Ami can drive the tour bus, talk to bees, make a huge mess and clean in the form of a tornado, and play her drums with her bare feet, as seen in both "Ami Goes Bad" and "Mean Machine". Ami can crush a handheld gaming device with her hand as seen in The Legend of Mei Pie. She is also a ninja like Yumi in "Ninjcompoop", though not as skillful or as Yumi (Which leads to her ultimate demise later). Ami can also throw things far away as seen in "Gridiron Maidens", due to always pounding on the drums.

Yumi Yoshimura

    Voiced by Grey DeLisle

YUMI YOSHIMURA, the younger of the duo, is depicted in the show as a 14-year old cynical, sarcastic punk rocker with lavender hair and blue eyes. She dresses in a heavy metal/grunge/goth style with studded necklaces and bracelets, a light purple T-shirt with a skull that has the same facial expressions as she does and seems to have a mind of its own, a black miniskirt, purple bike shorts, and black army boots. Being younger, Yumi is also more impetuous than Ami and rushes headlong into a decision before thinking. However, Yumi has a mature side, too, and sometimes reasons with Ami's childish obsessions, although she herself is two years younger.

Yumi loves things like ninjas, monster trucks, car crushers and anything else rough and tough. In the episode "Opera Yumi", it is shown that she was an opera singer since birth, but rebelled to pursue her interest in rock music. She also commonly disrespects Kaz.

In some episodes she can be seen biting her nails intentionally or not. Yumi can also drive the tour bus, understand animals, eat a lot of food if she's very bored and make a huge mess like Kaz and Ami. Yumi is also a fighter and at times, a ninja due to her training in "Ninjcompoop".

Yumi would never make an appearance in a Cartoon Network show after the show's cancellation until 2018, when she later appeared as a cameo in "Crossover Nexus", alongside Robot Jones, Chowder and Schnitzel, Festro, Moxy, Ilana, High-Five Ghost, and Weasel.

Kazuo "Kaz" Harada

    Voiced by Keone Young

KAZ HARADA is the duo's well-intentioned yet money-grubbing manager, whose successes are usually balanced out by his foolish decisions. His appearance and name are based on Puffy AmiYumi's real-life manager, Kaz Harada. Veteran character actor Keone Young provides his voice. He is also a huge fan of sumo wrestling, as seen in the episode "Sumo Kaz".


Recurring characters

-   JANG-KENG (voiced by Grey DeLisle) and TEKIRAI (voiced by Janice Kawaye) are Yumi's and Ami's pet cats, respectively. Jang-Keng (sometimes called "Jengo") is a black cat and Tekirai ("Teki" for short) is a fluffy white cat. The girls adore their cats, but Kaz is a constant victim of their mischief.[1]
-   HARMONY (voiced by Sandy Fox) is the self-proclaimed "Number One Fan" of the girls and of Kaz by the end of the episode "Dis-Harmony" and in "Fan Clubs". She is a six-year-old psycho girl who is so obsessed with the duo that she follows it around the world, annoying Ami and Yumi to no end. At the end of her first appearance, she becomes obsessed with Kaz's singing and this becomes a running gag in some episodes, appearing from nowhere and telling Kaz she is his #1 fan.
-   WALL (voiced by Will Ryan) is a hulking yet slow-witted man hired by Kaz as the girls' bodyguard. He is overprotective, pummeling anyone with whom Ami and Yumi attempt to make contact. He also speaks in the 3rd person. Kaz later hired him as a bouncer for a party he was throwing and, more recently, Ami had him try being a roadie. He later appeared in the unaired episode "Sound Off".
-   DOMO (voiced by Keone Young) is Kaz's dog. He looks much like his owner, even sharing a similar style of glasses (Kaz is the only one who doesn't see the resemblance). Like Kaz, he is constantly in conflict with the cats, especially since he enjoys eating their food.
-   TALENT SUCKERS are a vampire rock trio from Transylvania who first appeared in the eponymous episode, "sucking" Ami and Yumi's talent from them. They returned in three other episodes. The straight man of the trio is VLAD (Nathan Carlson), a tall vampire who speaks with a Transylvanian accent. The second band member is a short vampire, NICOLAI (Corey Burton), who is easily made nervous. (A running gag has Vlad slapping Nicolai back to his senses.) The third Talent Sucker is MITCH (also voiced by Nathan Carlson), a vampire who does not talk, but instead grunts and groans.


Minor characters

-   ELDWIN BLAIR (voiced by Nathan Carlson) is a sinister land developer, and the antagonist in the two episodes in which he appears. He usually tries to tear down beloved places for his own selfish needs.
-   KING CHAD (voiced by Katie Leigh) is "a bad boy super hunk", as once described by Ami and Yumi. He is obsessed with the card game Stu-Pi-Doh! (a parody of _Yu-Gi-Oh!_) and thinks highly of himself. In "Janice Jealous", he had a girlfriend named Janice who shared his interests in video games, yo-yo tricks, and comics. True to his name, King Chad wears a fur-lined cape and gold crown, and sits on a beautifully-adorned throne. In the episode "Janice Jealous", the character King Chad goes out with is based on Janice Kawaye, Ami's voice actress. She also voiced the character Janice.
-   ATCHAN (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is a character Ami and Yumi met at Camp Youwannasushi. He thinks he is a superhero. He is based on Vo Atsushi, the lead singer of the J-Pop band New Rote'ka who is friends with the real-life Yumi Yoshimura and made two cameos in the series last season's live-action sequences. Atchan constantly refers to himself in the 3rd person. Before becoming a superhero, Atchan's face resembles Mac from _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_. After he declares himself a hero, his looks change to look more like Kamen Rider's. He has a painted star over his right eye resembling that of Kiss guitarist Paul Stanley.
-   JULIE (voiced by Lara Jill Miller) is Yumi's friend in the episode "Julie AmiYumi", which was not aired in the United States. She is a former band member whose signature color is green and she plays a keyboard guitar. She treats Yumi kindly, but is always mean to Ami. In the episode, she tries to take out Ami and Yumi as revenge for them stealing the stardom which she believed to be rightfully hers. She could not remember Ami's name and called her Arthur. At the end when she is standing in the rain she swore revenge.
-   JANICE (voiced by Janice Kawaye) is a girl King Chad dates in "Janice Jealous".
-   TEAM TEEN is a trio of superheroes. The members are Jarhead (voiced by Nathan Carlson), Prom Queen, and Pizza Face. They appear in the Team Teen episode. In the episode, they appeared and tried to stop Mega Bully from harassing the kids at the park. They made Ami and Yumi part of the team when they accepted the offer. Ami became Pom Pom, given her a cheerleader-styled heroine costume with powerful "Whirling Pom Poms of Power". Yumi became The Rebel, complete with a biker-styled outfit, tall hair, and a supersonic switchblade boomerang comb. After working with the team, Ami and Yumi find out that Team Teen is not that good of a superhero team. They were going to quit at that time, but Jarhead calls them because Mega Bully returned and attacked them. Ami and Yumi fought Mega Bully but had trouble the first time, so they won fighting their own way. Even though they saved the team, Jarhead fires Ami and Yumi for using violence to stop Mega Bully and popping his costume. Ami and Yumi don't care because they didn't want the team's "super squareness" to rub off of them. The team was last seen comforting Mega Bully. Team Teen is a pun for "Teen Titans", another show that Puffy AmiYumi sang the theme song and played K2G for.
