TRACIE CHIMA UTOH, also known as TRACIE UTOH-EZEAJUGH, is a Nigerian playwright and Professor of Film and Theatre Design at Nnamdi Azikiwe University.[1][2] In 2015 she was an ACLS/ASA Presidential Fellow, a scheme which invites "outstanding Africa-based scholars" to attend the African Studies Association annual conference and spend a week in an American institution before the conference.[3]

Her academic speciality is the study of the use of costume, makeup and body art, "both as art and as aids to characterisation on stage and in films".[4]

N.E. Izuu, writing in _Creative Artist: A Journal of Theatre and Media Studies_ said that Utoh "exhibits a profound proclivity towards the reiteration of humanist agitation (rather than feminist) which aims at rechannelling literary emphasis to more debilitating phenomena in contemporary society other than the re-inscription of gendered disputations".[5]
