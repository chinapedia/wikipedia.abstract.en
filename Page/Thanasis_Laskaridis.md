Biography

Early life and education

He was born in Athens, Greece, to Konstantinos (Constantine) and Aikaterini (Kaiti) Laskaridis and has one older brother, Panos Laskaridis.[12] He graduated from the German School of Athens in 1970[13] and went on to receive a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering[14] at Aston University of Birmingham in 1973, a Master's degree in Systems Engineering at Imperial College London in 1974 and a second Master's degree in Economics and Finance at the London School of Economics in 1975.

Business interests

During the mid-'70s he started his occupation in shipping by taking control of the small family fishing company along with his brother, Panos.[15][16] The two brothers are the majority shareholders[17][18] of _Lavinia Corporation_, a shipping group holding company that controls _Laskaridis Shipping_, an Athens-based management company founded in 1977[19][20] which operates reefer ships, petrol tankers, dry bulk carriers,[21][22][23] ship repair facilities, and marine terminals.[24]

His business activities also span across the hospitality (Laskaridis and his family controls numerous hotels in European countries like the landmark hotels Grande Bretagne[25] and King George[26][27] of Athens, Hyatt Regency Belgrade,[28] Lucknam Park[29] in UK etc.), real estate, and airline industries (as a minority shareholder in Aegean Airlines[30]), and other enterprises.

Charity and donations

In 1993, the Laskaridis brothers[31] founded _Aikaterini Laskaridis Foundation_ in memory of their mother. The foundation actively supports cultural and educational projects in Greece.[32][33] Laskaridis and his brother have donated to numerous causes such as the Hellenic Coast Guard,[34][35][36] the Greek navy,[37] the Union of Greek Shipowners' charitable trust, fresh water supply projects for refugees in northern Greece and a number of Greek charitable organisations engaged with the wellbeing of children in need. Laskaridis has also donated to the London School of Economics in support of the _Hellenic Observatory_, where he sits on the Advisory Board.[38]

In 2014, he financed with €1.5 million[39] the restoration of Syntagma Square, the central square of Athens that had been damaged during riots and vandalism in previous years.[40][41][42][43] The mayor of Athens, Giorgos Kaminis, unveiled a plaque in his honour in September 2018, for Laskaridis' contribution to the square.[44]

Thanasis Laskaridis is also the founder of _The People's Trust_[45] in Greece, a charitable trust dedicated to small grants for startup companies and general charity.[46]

For his donations to the Greek Navy and coast guard, Laskaridis has been awarded by the Ministry of Shipping and Island Policy and the Hellenic Coast Guard.[47][48] He is also an honorary member of the latter organisation.[49]

In 2016, Laskaridis founded the A.C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation, a non-profit organisation which aims to build partnerships and implement programmes that focus on the environment and education in Greece.[50][51]
