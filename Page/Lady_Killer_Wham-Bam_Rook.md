In shogi, the LADY KILLER WHAM-BAM ROOK or LADY KILLER RUSHING ROOK (女殺しドッカン飛車 _onna koroshi dokkan hisha_) or ONIROKU DAN DOKKAN ROOK (鬼六流ドッカン飛車 or 鬼六流どっかん飛車 _dan oniroku-ryuu dokkan hisha_) is a surprise opening that was used by BDSM pornography author Oniroku Dan to defeat a woman professional shogi player.

The opening is basically a Ranging Rook opening played against a Static Rook opponent, which plans for an Opposing Rook position with the threat of a bishop trade.


Initial positioning

1. R-58. The opening starts with an uncommon first move of the rook to the central file.

1. ...P-34. If White opens their bishop diagonal by advancing their third file pawn, then Black may attempt the Lady Killer Wham-Bam Rook opening.

2. G-38. Black's second move is a rare move of the right gold to the third file.


Further development

2. ...P-84. White starts to activate their rook as well by pushing their rook pawn – thus selecting a Static Rook position.

3. K-49. Black starts moving their king away from left side of the board.

The aim here is to quickly position the king into a Gold Mino castle.

3. ...P-85. White advances their rook pawn aiming for a pawn exchange.

4. P-76. In response to White's pawn push, Black opens their bishop diagonal to allow their bishop an escape route.

4. ...S-62, 5. S-48. White moves their right silver up toward the center – a typical response to a Ranging Rook opponent. Black does likewise.

5. ...K-42, 6. K-39 K-32. Both players shift their kings to the right side of the board for castle development.

White is developing a Boat castle, which is typical for a Static Rook player positioned against a Ranging Rook opponent.

7. K-28. By move 13, Black has finished moving their king into the Gold Mino.

Here is the basic position of Lady Killer Wham-Bam Rook before the rook is moved to the eighth file.

Variant orderings

The above position can be reached via other transpositions.


Attack sequences

7. ...P-86. White initiates the pawn exchange on the eighth file.

8. PX86 RX86. Pawn exchange.

9. BX22 SX22. An early bishop exchange initiated by Black.

With the bishops off the board, Black can now play Opposing Rook.

10. R-88. Black swings their rook over to the eighth file for an Opposing Rook position.

Since White's rook is unprotected on the 86 square, White must respond to Black's threat.

10. ...P*87. White continues their attack by dropping a dangling pawn above Black's rook threatening to capture it.
