(1882)]]

CAPT. JOHN ALDEN SR. ( 15981687)[1] was a crew member on the historic 1620 voyage of the Pilgrim ship _Mayflower_. Rather than return to England with the ship, he stayed at what became Plymouth Colony. He was hired in Southampton, England, as the ship's cooper, responsible for maintaining the ship's barrels. He was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact. He married fellow _Mayflower_ passenger Priscilla Mullins, whose entire family perished in the first winter.

He served in a number of important government positions such as Assistant Governor, Duxbury Deputy to the General Court of Plymouth, Captain Myles Standish's Duxbury militia company, a member of the Council of War, Treasurer of Plymouth Colony, and Commissioner to Dartmouth.[2]


English origins

Many theories have been ventured about the English origins of John Alden.[3] Robert Charles Anderson, general editor of the multi-decade "Great Migration" effort to establish the earliest European immigrants to New England, says that although one or two of the hypothesized origins are "tempting," none of them are proved.[4]

The only certainty about John Alden's English background were Bradford's words that Alden "was hired for a cooper, (barrel maker) at Southampton, where the ship victuled; and being a hopeful young man, was much desired, but left to his liking to go or stay when he came here; but he stayed, and maryed here." Author Charles Edward Banks states that the employment of Alden "at Southampton" does not necessarily mean that he was a resident of the seaport and may have only been there to work temporarily when the _Mayflower_ arrived.[5]
Research by Charles Edward Banks published in 1929 theorized that John Alden may have come from the Alden family of Harwich in Essex, England. Harwich is an ancient North Sea port, northeast of London, which was the homeport of the Pilgrim ship _Mayflower_ and home of its captain, Christopher Jones. The Alden family of Harwich had distant connections to Jones, residing there in the 17th century and possibly related to him by marriage. Banks notes a young John Alden of the Harwich Aldens was about the same age as the Mayflower passenger.[6]
Banks also reports that John Alden "may have been the son of George Alden the fletcher [arrow maker], who disappeared – probably dying in that year – leaving John, an orphan, free to take employment overseas. Jane, the widow, may have been his mother and Richard and Avys his grandparents." The tax list of Holyrood Ward, Southampton, in 1602 list the names of George Alden and John's future father-in-law William Mullins.[7] Banks points out, however, that this theory cannot be proven. None of the records that mention this George Alden mention John, and none of John's children or grandchildren were named George, in a time when it was common to name one's children after their grandparents.[8][9]

Alycia Crane Williams analyzed these and several other theories in _The Mayflower Descendant_. She also pointed out that some have connected John Alden of the Mayflower with John Alden, a gentleman, "son and heir of John Alden of Swanscomb, Kent," who obtained a Patent of Arms in 1607. There is no evidence that John Alden of the Mayflower was connected to this family or inherited this coat of arms. Williams states, "This Alden coat of arms was published in the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ and has led many unsuspecting [beginning genealogists] astray."[10]


Voyage of the Mayflower

    _Main article: Mayflower_

1899]]

The _Mayflower_ departed Plymouth, England, on September 6, 1620. The 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way, there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come. After arriving at their destination, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in the cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.[11]

On November 9, 1620, after a month of delays in England and about two months at sea, they spotted the Cape Cod Hook. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor, where they anchored on November 11. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day.[12][13]


In Plymouth Colony

John Alden was among the original settlers of the Plymouth Colony. Although not himself a Separatist, he had been hired to be a cooper (barrel maker) and decided to join the journey when she set sail, perhaps with the hope of becoming prosperous in the New World. Alden's rivalry with Miles Standish for the affection of Priscilla Mullins is recounted elaborately in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem "The Courtship of Miles Standish" (1858).

From 1633 until 1675, he was assistant to the governor of the Plymouth Colony, frequently serving as acting governor and also on many juries.


Dispute of 1634

In 1634, Alden was jailed, in Boston, for a fight at Kenebeck in Maine between members of the Plymouth Colony and the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The fight involved a fur trading dispute that escalated into a killing of Plymouth colonist Moses Talbot by John Hocking by a shot to the head. Hocking was then immediately killed by Plymouth colonists by a shot to the head.[14][15]

While Alden did not participate in the fight, he was the highest-ranking member from Plymouth that the Massachusetts Bay colonists found to arrest. It was only through the intervention of Bradford that he was eventually released.


Family

John Alden married Priscilla Mullins on May 12, 1622. She was the only survivor of the Mayflower Mullins family. They had ten children. Priscilla died in Duxbury between 1651 and her husband's death in 1687. Both were buried in the Myles Standish Burial Ground in Duxbury, Massachusetts.[16][17]

Children of John Alden and Priscilla Mullins

-   Elizabeth was born in 1623 and died in Little Compton, Rhode Island, on May 31, 1717. She married William Pabodie on December 26, 1644 in Duxbury MA, and had thirteen children. Her grave and that of her husband are in the Old Commons Cemetery in Little Compton.
-   John Jr. was born about 1626 and died in Boston on March 14, 1701/2. He married Elizabeth (Phillips) Everill on April 1, 1660, and had fourteen children. He was a survivor of the Salem witch trials, of which he wrote a notable account.
-   Joseph was born about 1628 and died in Bridgewater on February 8, 1696/7. He married Mary Simmons about 1660 and had seven children.
-   Priscilla was born about 1630. She married Samuel Cheeseborough in 1699.[18]
-   Jonathan was born about 1632 and died in Duxbury on February 14, 1697. He married Abigail Hallett on December 10, 1672, and had six children. Jonathan was buried in the Old Cemetery in South Duxbury.[19]
-   Sarah was born about 1634 and died before the settlement of her father's estate in 1688. She married Alexander Standish about 1660 and had eight children.[20]
-   Ruth was born about 1636 and died in Braintree on October 12, 1674. She married John Bass in Braintree on February 3, 1657/8, and had seven children.[21] Among her children was Hannah Bass, paternal grandmother of future United States President John Adams.
-   Mary was born about 1638. She was alive and unmarried in 1688.[22]
-   Rebecca was born about 1640.[23] She married Thomas Delano in 1677 and had nine children.[24] She died between June 12, 1696 and October 5, 1722.[25] She is buried in The Old Burying Ground (Myles Standish Cemetery) in Duxbury, Massachusetts.
-   David was born about 1642 and died in Duxbury between July 2, 1718, and April 1, 1719. He married Mary Southworth by 1674 and had six children.[26]

Priscilla Alden who married Samuel Cheeseborough of Stonington, Connecticut was the daughter of David, who is the youngest child of John and Pricilla Alden. There is confusion here in this documentation. John and Pricilla Alden of the Mayflower were her grandparents.


Final days and legacy

, the final resting place of John and Priscilla Alden]] , built ca. 1653, in Duxbury, Massachusetts]]

John Alden was the last survivor of the signers of the Mayflower Compact. He died at Duxbury[27] on September 12, 1687. Both he and his wife Priscilla lie buried in the Myles Standish Burial Ground.

The Alden residence is also in Duxbury, on the north side of the village, on a farm which is still in possession of their descendants of the seventh generation. He made no will, having distributed the greater part of his estate among his children during his lifetime.[28]

A wheel-lock carbine owned by John Alden is housed at the NRA's National Firearms Museum; it is the only known surviving firearm to have crossed the Atlantic aboard the Mayflower. The rifle was found hidden in the Alden house during a 1924 restoration.[29][30]

John Alden's House, now a National Historic Landmark, was built in 1653 and is open to the public as a museum. It is run by the Alden Kindred of America,[31] an organization which provides historical information about him and his home, including genealogical records of his descendants. John and Priscilla had the following children who survived to adulthood: Elizabeth, John (accused during the Salem witch trials), Joseph, Priscilla, Robert, Jonathan, Sarah, Ruth, Mary, Rebecca, and David. They have the most descendants today of all the pilgrim families.[32]


Notable Descendants

-   John Alden was an extreme ancestor to president John Adams and his family.
-   A direct descendant of John was Scott Alden (1907–1977), who served as an assistant to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover.[33]
-   Also a descendant was Vernon Alden who served as President of Ohio University from 1962 until 1967. The main campus library at OU is named in his honor.
-   Another descendant is the Academy Award-winning actress Jodie Foster.
-   Emily Gilmore Alden, author and educator, is a descendant.
