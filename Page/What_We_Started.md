Reception

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 15 reviews, and an average rating of 7.3/10.[20]

The film opened to rave reviews, which noted that it shines as "the premier film on Electronic Music history"[21] and that it is a "dance music film that gets it right."[22][23] _The Nocturnal Times_ stated that "What We Started is the best electronic music film of our time, offering a precisely accurate adaptation of the rapidly growing electronic scene and its worldwide domination," and that the film"gets it all right."[24] One reviewer notes that "as one watches WHAT WE STARTED, one of the striking elements which rings forth is the idea of "resiliency", and that "thanks to detailed research and a self-imposed mantra to remain unbiased in the presentation of the documentary, the filmmakers peel back the glossy layers of bright lights and enthusiastic concerts and delve into the darker aspects of culture that all but wiped out EDM prior to its rebirth and resurgence."[25]

EDM Tunes stated that "no matter what side of the spectrum you fall on, be you a techno purist or a bass head, What We Started is a film that speaks to all dance music enthusiasts." They also said that "Director Bert Marcus (previous producer of 'How to Make Money Selling Drugs' and 'Teenage Paparazzo') masterfully tells the story of how the legends of old throwing raves in empty fields and abandoned warehouses inspired the biggest boom in popularity that any musical genre has ever seen."[26] Dancing Astronaut also stated that the "new documentary film What We Started looks to be our generation's first veritable attempt at capturing the history of dance music in its entirety. It's an ambitious undertaking, especially considering the traditional portrayal of dance music in Hollywood, which, more often than not, appears out-of-touch or overtly contrived. Fortunately, What We Started is not one of those films. Where Bert Marcus's new documentary succeeds is in its ability to present the paralleling narratives of the underground and the mainstream in tandem."[27] Nerd Reactor also gave the film 4/5 stars[28] and Your EDM calls it "brilliant."[29]

When the film was released on Netflix on July 1, 2018, there was another wave of critical acclaim for the film from high-profile journalists and bloggers.[30][31][32][33][34]
