"" ("In the Midst of Life we are in Death") is a Lutheran hymn, with words written by Martin Luther based on the Latin antiphon "Media vita in morte sumus". The hymn in three stanzas was first published in 1524. The hymn inspired composers from the Renaissance to contemporary to write chorale preludes and vocal compositions. Catherine Winkworth translated Luther's song to English in 1862. It has appeared in hymnals of various denominations.


History

The Latin antiphon "Media vita in morte sumus" dates back to the 11th century. A German version appeared in Salzburg in 1456. Martin Luther added in 1524 two stanzas following the same scheme. The hymn appeared first that year in , (booklet of spiritual song), collected by Johann Walter with a melody that Walter adapted from the antiphon.[1] The same year it appeared also in _Eyn Enchiridion_ in Erfurt, titled "Der Lobsanck / Mitten wir ym leben synd." (The song of praise /).

Catherine Winkworth translated Luthers hymn to English in 1862, titled "In the Midst of Life".[2] A translation titled "In the Very Midst of Life" appeared in 1941 in _The Lutheran Hymnal_.[3] It has appeared in hymnals of various denominations. The song is part of the Protestant hymnal _Evangelisches Gesangbuch_ as EG 518.[4] The first stanza is included in the Catholic hymnal _Gotteslob_ as GL 503.[5]


Text

The Latin text has ten lines of different length, with irregular meter.[6] Lines 7 to 9 are reminiscent of the Trisagion, "Sanctus deus, Sanctus fortis, Sanctus immortalis, miserere nobis" (Holy God, Holy Strong One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us).[7]

When Luther added two stanzas, he kept the structure, rendering the final request for mercy in each stanza as the Greek "Kyrieleis". From stanza to stanza, a line explains the respective line in the previous stanza, leading from death in the midst of life to hell in the midst of death, in the third stanza to sin as the reason for fear of hell.[8][9] Biblical sources for Luther's stanzas are , and .[10]
