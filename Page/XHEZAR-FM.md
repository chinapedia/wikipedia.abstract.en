XEZAR-AM/XHEZAR-FM is a radio station on 920 AM and 96.1 FM in Puebla, Puebla, with AM transmitter at San Bernardino Tlaxcalancingo. It carries the Arroba FM pop format from Grupo Radiorama.


History

XEZAR received its concession on January 6, 1989. It was owned by Alberto Guilbot Serros and located in Cholula. In 1998, Serros sold his stations, including XEZAR, to Grupo ACIR, which in turn later sold XEZAR to Radiorama.

XEZAR migrated to FM on September 13, 2018, as XHEZAR-FM 96.1. A new tower was installed at the Radiorama studios.
