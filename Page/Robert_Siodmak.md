ROBERT SIODMAK (; 8 August 1900 – 10 March 1973) was a German film director who also worked in the United States. He is best remembered as a thriller specialist[1] and for a series of stylish, unpretentious Hollywood films noirs he made in the 1940s, such as _The Killers_ (1946).


Early life

Siodmak was born in Dresden, Germany, the son of Rosa Philippine (née Blum) and Ignatz Siodmak and the brother of Curt, Verner and Roland.[2] His parents were both from Jewish families in Leipzig (the myth of his American birth in Memphis, Tennessee was necessary for him to obtain a visa in Paris during World War II). He worked as a stage director and a banker before becoming editor and scenarist for Curtis Bernhardt in 1925 (Bernhardt would direct a film of Siodmak's story _Conflict_ in 1945). At twenty-six he was hired by his cousin, producer Seymour Nebenzal, to assemble original silent movies from stock footage of old films. Siodmak worked at this for two years before he persuaded Nebenzal to finance his first feature, the silent chef d'oeuvre, _Menschen am Sonntag_ (_People on Sunday_) in 1929. The script was co-written by Billy Wilder and Siodmak's brother Curt Siodmak, later the screenwriter of _The Wolf Man_ (1941). It was the last German silent and also included such future Hollywood artists as Fred Zinnemann, Edgar G. Ulmer, and Eugen Schufftan. His next film—the first at UFA to use sound—was the 1930 comedy _Abschied_ for writers Emeric Pressburger and Irma von Cube, followed by _Der Mann, der seinen Mörder sucht_, another comedy, yet quite different and unusual, a likely product of Billy Wilder's imagination (remade a noir, _DOA_, in 1950). But in his next film, the crime thriller _Stürme der Leidenschaft_, with Emil Jannings and Anna Sten, Siodmak found a style that would become his own.

With the rise of Nazism and following an attack in the press by Hitler's minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels in 1933 after viewing _Brennendes Geheimnis_ (_The Burning Secret_), Siodmak left Germany for Paris. His creativity flourished, as he worked for the next six years in a variety of film genres, from comedy (_Le sexe faible_ and _La Vie Parisienne_ ) to musical (_La crise est finie_, with Danielle Darrieux) to drama (_Mister Flow_, _Cargaison blanche_, _Mollenard_—compare Gabrielle Dorziat's shrewish wife with that of Rosalind Ivan in _The Suspect_— and _Pièges_, with Maurice Chevalier and Erich Von Stroheim). While in France, he was well on his way to becoming successor to Rene Clair, until Hitler again forced him out. Siodmak arrived in California in 1939, where he made 23 movies, many of them widely popular thrillers and crime melodramas, which critics today regard as classics of film noir.


Hollywood career

Beginning in 1941, he first turned out several B-films and programmers for various studios before he gained a seven-year contract with Universal Studios in 1943. The best of those early films are the thriller _Fly by Night_ in 1942, with Richard Carlson and Nancy Kelly, and in 1943 _Someone to Remember_, with Mable Paige in a signature role. As house director, his services were often used to salvage troublesome productions at the studio. On Mark Hellinger's production _Swell Guy_ (1946), for instance, Siodmak was brought in to replace Frank Tuttle only six days after completing work on _The Killers_. Siodmak worked steadily while under contract, overshadowed by high-profile directors, like Alfred Hitchcock, with whom he had been often compared by the press.

At Universal, Siodmak made yet another B-film, _Son of Dracula_ (1943), the third in the studio's series of Dracula movies (based on his brother Curt's original story). His second feature was the Maria Montez/Jon Hall vehicle, _Cobra Woman_ (1944), made in Technicolor.

His first all-out noir was _Phantom Lady_ (1944), for staff producer Joan Harrison, Universal's first female executive and Alfred Hitchcock's former secretary and script assistant. It showcased Siodmak's skill with camera and editing to dazzling effect, but no more so than in the iconic jam-session sequence with Elisha Cook Jr. in throes on the drums. Following the critical success of _Phantom Lady_, Siodmak directed _Christmas Holiday_ (1944) with Deanna Durbin and Gene Kelly (Hans J. Salter received an Oscar nomination for best music). Beginning with this film, his work in Hollywood attained the stylistic and thematic characteristics that are evident in his later noirs. _Christmas Holiday_, adapted from a W. Somerset Maugham novel by Herman J. Mankiewicz, was Durbin's most successful feature. Siodmak's use of black-and-white cinematography and urban landscapes, together with his light-and-shadow designs, followed the basic structure of classic noir films. In fact, he had a number of collaborations with cinematographers, such as Nicholas Musuraca, Elwood Bredell, and Franz Planer, in which he achieved the Expressionist look he had cultivated in his early years at UFA. During Siodmak's tenure, Universal made the most of the noir style in _The Suspect_, _The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry_ and _The Dark Mirror_, but the capstone was _The Killers_. Released in 1946, it was Burt Lancaster's film debut and Ava Gardner's first dramatic, featured role. A critical and financial success, it earned Siodmak his only Oscar nomination for direction in Hollywood (his German production _Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam_ (_The Devil Strikes at Night_), based on the true story of serial killer Bruno Lüdke, was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film in 1957).[3]

While still under contract at Universal, Siodmak worked on loan out to RKO for producer Dore Schary in the thriller _The Spiral Staircase_, a masterly blending of suspense and horror, which Siodmak said he edited as he pleased, due to a strike in Hollywood in 1945 (the film earned Ethel Barrymore a supporting-Oscar nomination). For 20th Century Fox and producer Darryl F. Zanuck, he directed, partly on location in New York City, the crime noir _Cry of the City_ in 1948, and in 1949 for MGM he tackled its lux production _The Great Sinner_, but the prolix script proved unmanageable for Siodmak who relinquished direction to the dependable and bland Mervyn LeRoy. On loan out to Paramount in 1949, he made for producer Hal B. Wallis his penultimate American noir _The File on Thelma Jordon_, with Barbara Stanwyck at her most fatal—and sympathetic. Siodmak saw in this film a thematic link with _The Suspect_ and _The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry_, with the failed lovers of these films and significantly their tragic conclusions (ten years later he addressed the same theme in _The Rough and the Smooth_). Perhaps his finest American noir—although not his last—is _Criss Cross_ that was to reunite him not only with Lancaster, but also _The Killers_ producer Mark Hellinger, who died suddenly before production began in 1949. Working without the hands-on control of Hellinger again, Siodmak was able to make this film his own as he could not the earlier film. Yvonne De Carlo's working-class femme fatal (a high mark in her career) completes the deadly triangle, along with Lancaster and Dan Duryea: the archetype of doomed attraction central to all Siodmak's noirs, but the one he could fully express to its nihilistic conclusion.

Siodmak immersed himself in the creative process and genuinely loved working with actors; in fact, he was considered an actor's director, discovering Burt Lancaster, Ernest Borgnine, Tony Curtis, Debra Paget, Maria Schell, Mario Adorf, and skillfully directing actresses, such as Ava Gardner, Olivia de Havilland, Dorothy McGuire, Yvonne de Carlo, Barbara Stanwyck, Geraldine Fitzgerald, and Ella Raines.[4]

He directed Charles Laughton (a close friend) and George Sanders, actors with indelible personas, and got from both perhaps the unlikeliest, most natural and under-acted performances of their careers. He managed with Lancaster to capture a youthful vulnerability in "The Killer"—despite the actor's age (he was 33). He was able to get a believable, dramatic performance from Gene Kelly. He also helped raise Ava Gardner's public profile.


Return to Europe

Before leaving for Europe in 1952, following the problematic production _The Crimson Pirate_ for Warner Bros. and producer Harold Hecht, his third and last film with Burt Lancaster (Siodmak dubbed the chaotic experience "The Hecht Follies"), Siodmak had directed some of the era's best films noirs (twelve in all), more than any other director who worked in that style. However, his identification with film noir, generally unpopular with American audiences, may have been more of a curse than a blessing.

He often expressed his desire to make pictures "of a different type and background" than the ones he had been making for ten years. Nevertheless, he ended his Universal contract with one last noir, the disappointing _Deported_ (1951) which he filmed partly abroad (Siodmak was among the first refugee directors to return to Europe after making American films). The story is loosely based on the deportation of gangster Charles "Lucky" Luciano. Siodmak had hoped Loretta Young would star, but settled for the Swedish actress Märta Torén.

Those "different type" of films he had made—_The Great Sinner_ (1949) for MGM, _Time Out of Mind_ (1947) for Universal (which Siodmak also produced), _The Whistle at Eaton Falls_ (1951) for Columbia Pictures (Ernest Borgnine's debut and Dorothy Gish's return to the screen)—all proved ill-suited to his noir sensibilities (although in 1952 _The Crimson Pirate_, despite the difficult production, was a surprising and pleasing departure—in fact, Lancaster believed it was inspiration for the tongue-in-cheek style of the James Bond films).

The five months he collaborated with Budd Schulberg on a screenplay tentatively titled _A Stone in the River Hudson_, an early version of _On the Waterfront_, was also a major disappointment for Siodmak. In 1954 he sued producer Sam Spiegel for copyright infringement. Siodmak was awarded $100,000, but no screen credit. His contribution to the original screenplay has never been acknowledged.

Siodmak's return to Europe in 1954 with a Grand Prize nomination at the Cannes Film Festival for his remake of Jacques Feyder's _Le grand jeu_ was a misstep, despite its stars, Gina Lollobrigida (two of them) and Arletty in the role originated by Françoise Rosay, Feyder's wife. In 1955, Siodmak returned to the Federal Republic of Germany to make _Die Ratten_, with Maria Schell and Curd Jurgens, winning the Golden Berlin Bear at the 1955 Berlin Film Festival.[5] It was the first in a series of films critical of his homeland, during and after Hitler, which included the remarkable _Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam_, both thriller and social artifact of Germany under Nazi rule, shot in documentary style reminiscent of _Menschen am Sonntag_ and _Whistle at Eaton Falls_, and in 1960, _Mein Schulfreund_, an absurdist comedy, dark and strange, with Heinz Ruhmann as a postal worker attempting to reunite with childhood friend Hermann Göring. Between these films, and _Mein Vater, der Schauspieler_ in 1956, with O. W. Fischer (the West German Rock Hudson), he took a detour into Douglas Sirk territory with the sordid melodrama, _Dorothea Angermann_ in 1959, featuring Germany's star Ruth Leuwerik. Later the same year he left Germany for Great Britain to film _The Rough and the Smooth_, with Nadja Tiller and Tony Britton, yet another noir, but much meaner and gloomier than anything he had made in America (compare its downbeat ending with that of _The File on Thelma Jordan_). He followed with _Katia_ also in 1959, a tale of Czarist Russia, with twenty-one-year-old Romy Schneider, mistakenly titled in America _The Magnificent Sinner_, recalling—unfavorably—Siodmak's other costume melodrama. In 1961, _L'affaire Nina B_, with Pierre Brasseur and Nadja Tiller (again), returned Siodmak to familiar ground in a slick, black-and-white thriller about a pay-for-hire Nazi hunter, which could be argued was the start of the many spy themed films so popular in the 1960s. In 1962, the entertaining _Escape from East Berlin_, with Don Murray and Christine Kaufman, had all the characteristic style of a Siodmak thriller, but was one that he later dismissed as something he had made for "little kids in America." His work in Germany returned to programmers like those that had begun his career in Hollywood 23 years earlier. From 1964 to 1965, he made a series of films with former Tarzan Lex Barker: _Der Schut_, _Der Schatz der Azteken_, and _Die Pyramide des Sonnengottes_, all taken from the western, adventure novels of Karl May and made (presumably) for little kids in both Germany and America.


Later career

Siodmak's return to Hollywood filmmaking in 1967 with the wide-screen western _Custer of the West_ was another disappointment, receiving mostly negative reviews from critics and failing to generate box-office appeal. Siodmak ended his career with a six-hour, two-part toga and chariot epic, _Kampf um Rom_ (1968), a more campy work (perhaps intentionally) than _Cobra Woman_ had been. There was a brief and profitable foray into television in Great Britain with the series _O.S.S._ (1957–58). Siodmak was last seen publicly in an interview for Swiss television at his home in Ascona in 1971. He died alone in 1973 in Locarno of a heart attack,[6] seven weeks after his wife's death.

The British Film Institute held a retrospective of his career in April and May 2015.[7]
