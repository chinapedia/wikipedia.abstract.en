History

A church at the site was present since 1173, known _as San Michele in Cameri_. Later the church was also known as the _Chiesa dei Bianchi_ (Church of the Whites), as opposed to the Chiesa del Santissimo Sacramento (Chiesa dei Rossi). Both churches belonged to flagellant confraternities, identifiable by their respectively colored robes. This church was erected by the _Confraternity of St Michael Archangel_, established officially in 1565.

The church fa√ßade has eight pilasters over two stories, with empty niches. The interior is simple until the presbytery with a baroque main altar made of colored marble. The large wooden altarpiece has a painting depicting St Michael. On the counterfacade is an organ with a wooden balustrade.[1]
