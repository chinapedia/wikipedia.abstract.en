History

Founding

In 1948, a group of nine lay leaders of Beth Tfiloh Congregation advocated for holding mixed-gender religious services and expanded b'nai mitvah ceremonies.[12] Their advocacy was unsuccessful, and instead they formed Beth El Congregation.[13]

Beth El Congregation was established in 1948 as the first Conservative congregation in Maryland.[14] Beth El's establishment was announced at an inaugural dinner held at Baltimore's Sheraton-Belvedere Hotel on May 10, 1948.[15]

First synagogue

Located on of land at the corner of Hilton Road and Dorithan Road[16] in the Ashburton neighborhood of Baltimore, Beth El's original synagogue included a 1,500-seat chapel, an auditorium, social rooms, a gymnasium, a kitchen, and preschool classrooms.[17][18] The synagogue was designed by architect Erich Mendelsohn[19] and built by Cogswell Construction Company.[20]

New synagogue

When Beth El's membership increased from 97 families to 1,100 families between 1950 and 1955, Beth El needed a larger place of worship.[21] Groundbreaking on the new synagogue in Pikesville began on June 7, 1959.[22] Rabbi Jacob B. Agus and Cantor Saul Z. Hammerman were present.[23]

Built on of land with a construction budget of $1,500,000, the synagogue was designed by architect Sigmund Braverman and built by Cogswell Construction Company.[24] The masonry work was done by McCullough Brothers.[25]

The main synagogue was designed with a 1,500-seat sanctuary, religious school classrooms for 600 students, an assembly hall for 350 people, a social hall designed for 1,000 people, and dining facilities with a capacity of 600 people.[26] The main entrance was surrounded by two large granite pillars, representing pillars built by King Solomon at the First Holy Temple.[27] The main entrance was built with three brass and ceramic plaques that use the Hebrew letters for the word truth, symbolizing creation, revelation, and redemption.[28] The sanctuary was built with ten stained glass windows symbolizing the Jewish festivals.[29] The sanctuary's 24 narrow windows symbolize the 24 books of the Tanakh.[30]

The synagogue was dedicated in 1960.[31]

In 1961, the Building Congress and Exchange gave an award for craftsmanship for the design and construction of the synagogue.[32]
