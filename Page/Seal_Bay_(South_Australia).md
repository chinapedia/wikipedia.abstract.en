Seal Bay}} __NOTOC__ SEAL BAY is a bay in the Australian state of South Australia located on the south coast of Kangaroo Island about southwest of the state capital of Adelaide and about south of the municipal seat of Kingscote.[1][2]

The name ‘Seal Bay’ refers to the section of coastline associated with both the visitor facilities and the prohibited areas located within the Seal Bay Conservation Park.[3][4]

The name was gazetted in 1992 after being in use since at least the 1950s.[5][6]

Protected areas located within the bay’s extent include the Seal Bay Aquatic Reserve and the South Kangaroo Island Marine Park.[7][8]
