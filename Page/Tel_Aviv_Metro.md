The TEL AVIV METRO is a proposed metro system for the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area. It will augment the Tel Aviv Light Rail and Israel Railways suburban lines to form a rapid transit transportation solution for the city.


History

The plan for the metro was born in 2015 in the Israeli ministry of finance, bypassing the transportation ministry. The ministry's rationale was that the light rail plan would not be sufficient to answer Tel Aviv's transportation needs as early as the 2020s, when the first lines would be completed. Multiple alternatives were proposed in internal discussions. At the time, the plan was met with surprise at the transportation ministry.[1]

By early 2016 the two ministries agreed on a general outline that would include three of the seven planned light rail lines, in addition to three new metro lines.[2] In September 2016, the government-owned company NTA (Hebrew acronym for Urban Transportation Lines) released a feasibility study tender for the metro lines. The final cost of all lines is estimated at NIS 130–150 billion (USD – billion).[3][4]

In July 2018, NTA published a tender for the planning of the three subway lines.[5] In July 2018, McKinsey submitted a report on the financial aspects of the project to the Israeli government.[6]

On the April 15, 2019 the National Infrastructures Committee approved the route of all three metro lines.[7]


Plan

Construction is slated to start around 2024–2026.[8]
