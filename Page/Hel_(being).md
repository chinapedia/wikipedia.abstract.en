Hel_(1889)_by_Johannes_Gehrts.jpg, pictured here with her hound Garmr.]]

In Norse mythology, HEL is a being who presides over a realm of the same name, where she receives a portion of the dead. Hel is attested in the _Poetic Edda_, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the _Prose Edda_, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In addition, she is mentioned in poems recorded in _Heimskringla_ and _Egils saga_ that date from the 9th and 10th centuries, respectively. An episode in the Latin work _Gesta Danorum_, written in the 12th century by Saxo Grammaticus, is generally considered to refer to Hel, and Hel may appear on various Migration Period bracteates.

In the _Poetic Edda_, _Prose Edda_, and _Heimskringla_, Hel is referred to as a daughter of Loki. In the _Prose Edda_ book _Gylfaginning_, Hel is described as having been appointed by the god Odin as ruler of a realm of the same name, located in Niflheim. In the same source, her appearance is described as half blue and half flesh-coloured and further as having a gloomy, downcast appearance. The _Prose Edda_ details that Hel rules over vast mansions with many servants in her underworld realm and plays a key role in the attempted resurrection of the god Baldr.

Scholarly theories have been proposed about Hel's potential connections to figures appearing in the 11th-century _Old English Gospel of Nicodemus_ and Old Norse _Bartholomeus saga postola_, that she may have been considered a goddess with potential Indo-European parallels in Bhavani, Kali, and Mahakali or that Hel may have become a being only as a late personification of the location of the same name.


Etymology

The Old Norse feminine proper noun _Hel_ is identical to the name of the location over which she rules, Old Norse _Hel_. The word has cognates in all branches of the Germanic languages, including Old English _hell_ (and thus Modern English _hell_), Old Frisian _helle_, Old Saxon _hellia_, Old High German _hella_, and Gothic _halja_. All forms ultimately derive from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic feminine noun *_xaljō_ or *_haljō_ ('concealed place, the underworld'). In turn, the Proto-Germanic form derives from the o-grade form of the Proto-Indo-European root *_kel-_, *_kol_-: 'to cover, conceal, save'.[1]

The term is etymologically related to Modern English _hall_ and therefore also _Valhalla_, an afterlife 'hall of the slain' in Norse Mythology. _Hall_ and its numerous Germanic cognates derive from Proto-Germanic *_hallō_ 'covered place, hall', from Proto-Indo-European *_kol-_.[2]

Related early Germanic terms and concepts include Proto-Germanic *_xalja-rūnō(n)_, a feminine compound noun, and *_xalja-wītjan_, a neutral compound noun. This form is reconstructed from the Latinized Gothic plural noun *_haliurunnae_ (attested by Jordanes; according to philologist Vladimir Orel, meaning 'witches'), Old English _helle-rúne_ ('sorceress, necromancer', according to Orel), and Old High German _helli-rūna_ 'magic'. The compound is composed of two elements: *_xaljō_ (*_haljō_) and *_rūnō_, the Proto-Germanic precursor to Modern English _rune_.[3] The second element in the Gothic _haliurunnae_ may however instead be an agent noun from the verb _rinnan_ ("to run, go"), which would make its literal meaning "one who travels to the netherworld".[4][5])

Proto-Germanic *_xalja-wītjan_ (or *_halja-wītjan_) is reconstructed from Old Norse _hel-víti_ 'hell', Old English _helle-wíte_ 'hell-torment, hell', Old Saxon _helli-wīti_ 'hell', and the Middle High German feminine noun _helle-wīze_. The compound is a compound of *_xaljō_ (discussed above) and *_wītjan_ (reconstructed from forms such as Old English _witt_ 'right mind, wits', Old Saxon _gewit_ 'understanding', and Gothic _un-witi_ 'foolishness, understanding').[6]


Attestations

_Poetic Edda_

The _Poetic Edda_, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, features various poems that mention Hel. In the _Poetic Edda_ poem _Völuspá_, Hel's realm is referred to as the "Halls of Hel."[7] In stanza 31 of _Grímnismál_, Hel is listed as living beneath one of three roots growing from the world tree Yggdrasil.[8] In _Fáfnismál_, the hero Sigurd stands before the mortally wounded body of the dragon Fáfnir, and states that Fáfnir lies in pieces, where "Hel can take" him.[9] In _Atlamál_, the phrases "Hel has half of us" and "sent off to Hel" are used in reference to death, though it could be a reference to the location and not the being, if not both.[10] In stanza 4 of _Baldrs draumar_, Odin rides towards the "high hall of Hel."[11]

Hel may also be alluded to in _Hamðismál_. Death is periphrased as "joy of the troll-woman"[12] (or "ogress"[13]) and ostensibly it is Hel being referred to as the troll-woman or the ogre (_flagð_), although it may otherwise be some unspecified _dís_.[14][15]

_Prose Edda_

Hel is referred to in the _Prose Edda_, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In chapter 34 of the book _Gylfaginning_, Hel is listed by High as one of the three children of Loki and Angrboða; the wolf Fenrir, the serpent Jörmungandr, and Hel. High continues that, once the gods found that these three children are being brought up in the land of Jötunheimr, and when the gods "traced prophecies that from these siblings great mischief and disaster would arise for them" then the gods expected a lot of trouble from the three children, partially due to the nature of the mother of the children, yet worse so due to the nature of their father.[16]

High says that Odin sent the gods to gather the children and bring them to him. Upon their arrival, Odin threw Jörmungandr into "that deep sea that lies round all lands," Odin threw Hel into Niflheim, and bestowed upon her authority over nine worlds, in that she must "administer board and lodging to those sent to her, and that is those who die of sickness or old age." High details that in this realm Hel has "great Mansions" with extremely high walls and immense gates, a hall called Éljúðnir, a dish called "Hunger," a knife called "Famine," the servant Ganglati (Old Norse "lazy walker"[17]), the serving-maid Ganglöt (also "lazy walker"[18]), the entrance threshold "Stumbling-block," the bed "Sick-bed," and the curtains "Gleaming-bale." High describes Hel as "half black and half flesh-coloured," adding that this makes her easily recognizable, and furthermore that Hel is "rather downcast and fierce-looking."[19]

In chapter 49, High describes the events surrounding the death of the god Baldr. The goddess Frigg asks who among the Æsir will earn "all her love and favour" by riding to Hel, the location, to try to find Baldr, and offer Hel herself a ransom. The god Hermóðr volunteers and sets off upon the eight-legged horse Sleipnir to Hel. Hermóðr arrives in Hel's hall, finds his brother Baldr there, and stays the night. The next morning, Hermóðr begs Hel to allow Baldr to ride home with him, and tells her about the great weeping the Æsir have done upon Baldr's death.[20] Hel says the love people have for Baldr that Hermóðr has claimed must be tested, stating:

  If all things in the world, alive or dead, weep for him, then he will be allowed to return to the Æsir. If anyone speaks against him or refuses to cry, then he will remain with Hel.[21]

Later in the chapter, after the female jötunn Þökk refuses to weep for the dead Baldr, she responds in verse, ending with "let Hel hold what she has."[22] In chapter 51, High describes the events of Ragnarök, and details that when Loki arrives at the field Vígríðr "all of Hel's people" will arrive with him.[23]

In chapter 5 of the _Prose Edda_ book _Skáldskaparmál_, Hel is mentioned in a kenning for Baldr ("Hel's companion").[24] In chapter 16, "Hel's [...] relative or father" is given as a kenning for Loki.[25] In chapter 50, Hel is referenced ("to join the company of the quite monstrous wolf's sister") in the skaldic poem _Ragnarsdrápa_.[26]

_Heimskringla_

In the _Heimskringla_ book _Ynglinga saga_, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, Hel is referred to, though never by name. In chapter 17, the king Dyggvi dies of sickness. A poem from the 9th-century _Ynglingatal_ that forms the basis of _Ynglinga saga_ is then quoted that describes Hel's taking of Dyggvi:

      I doubt not
      but Dyggvi's corpse
      Hel does hold
      to whore with him;
      for Ulf's sib
      a scion of kings
      by right should
      caress in death:
      to love lured
      Loki's sister
      Yngvi's heir
      o'er all Sweden.[27]

In chapter 45, a section from _Ynglingatal_ is given which refers to Hel as "howes'-warder" (meaning "guardian of the graves") and as taking King Halfdan Hvitbeinn from life.[28] In chapter 46, King Eystein Halfdansson dies by being knocked overboard by a sail yard. A section from _Ynglingatal_ follows, describing that Eystein "fared to" Hel (referred to as "Býleistr's-brother's-daughter").[29] In chapter 47, the deceased Eystein's son King Halfdan dies of an illness, and the excerpt provided in the chapter describes his fate thereafter, a portion of which references Hel:

      Loki's child
      from life summoned
      to her thing
      the third liege-lord,
      when Halfdan
      of Holtar farm
      left the life
      allotted to him.[30]

In a stanza from _Ynglingatal_ recorded in chapter 72 of the _Heimskringla_ book _Saga of Harald Sigurdsson_, "given to Hel" is again used as a phrase to referring to death.[31]

_Egils saga_

The Icelanders' saga _Egils saga_ contains the poem _Sonatorrek_. The saga attributes the poem to 10th century skald Egill Skallagrímsson, and writes that it was composed by Egill after the death of his son Gunnar. The final stanza of the poem contains a mention of Hel, though not by name:

      Now my course is tough:
      Death, close sister
      of Odin's enemy
      stands on the ness:
      with resolution
      and without remorse
      I will gladly
      await my own.[32]

_Gesta Danorum_

In the account of Baldr's death in Saxo Grammaticus' early 13th century work _Gesta Danorum_, the dying Baldr has a dream visitation from Proserpina (here translated as "the goddess of death"):

  The following night the goddess of death appeared to him in a dream standing at his side, and declared that in three days time she would clasp him in her arms. It was no idle vision, for after three days the acute pain of his injury brought his end.[33]

Scholars have assumed that Saxo used Proserpina as a goddess equivalent to the Norse Hel.[34]


Archaeological record

It has been suggested that several imitation medallions and bracteates of the Migration Period (ca. first centuries AD) feature depictions of Hel. In particular the bracteates IK 14 and IK 124 depict a rider traveling down a slope and coming upon a female being holding a scepter or a staff. The downward slope may indicate that the rider is traveling towards the realm of the dead and the woman with the scepter may be a female ruler of that realm, corresponding to Hel.[35]

Some B-class bracteates showing three godly figures have been interpreted as depicting Baldr's death, the best known of these is the Fakse bracteate. Two of the figures are understood to be Baldr and Odin while both Loki and Hel have been proposed as candidates for the third figure. If it is Hel she is presumably greeting the dying Baldr as he comes to her realm.[36]

Seo Hell

The _Old English Gospel of Nicodemus_, preserved in two manuscripts from the 11th century, contains a female figure referred to as _Seo hell_ who engages in flyting with Satan and tells him to leave her dwelling (Old English _ut of mynre onwununge_). Regarding Seo Hell in the _Old English Gospel of Nicodemus_, Michael Bell states that "her vivid personification in a dramatically excellent scene suggests that her gender is more than grammatical, and invites comparison with the Old Norse underworld goddess Hel and the Frau Holle of German folklore, to say nothing of underworld goddesses in other cultures" yet adds that "the possibility that these genders _are_ merely grammatical is strengthened by the fact that an Old Norse version of Nicodemus, possibly translated under English influence, personifies Hell in the neutral (Old Norse _þat helvíti_)."[37]

_Bartholomeus saga postola_

The Old Norse _Bartholomeus saga postola_, an account of the life of Saint Bartholomew dating from the 13th century, mentions a "Queen Hel." In the story, a devil is hiding within a pagan idol, and bound by Bartholomew's spiritual powers to acknowledge himself and confess, the devil refers to Jesus as the one which "made war on Hel our queen" (Old Norse _heriaði a Hel drottning vara_). "Queen Hel" is not mentioned elsewhere in the saga.[38]

Michael Bell says that while Hel "might at first appear to be identical with the well-known pagan goddess of the Norse underworld" as described in chapter 34 of _Gylfaginning_, "in the combined light of the Old English and Old Norse versions of _Nicodemus_ she casts quite a different a shadow," and that in _Bartholomeus saga postola_ "she is clearly the queen of the Christian, not pagan, underworld."[39]

Origins and development

Jacob Grimm theorized that Hel (whom he refers to here as _Halja_, the theorized Proto-Germanic form of the term) is essentially an "image of a greedy, unrestoring, female deity" and that "the higher we are allowed to penetrate into our antiquities, the less hellish and more godlike may _Halja_ appear. Of this we have a particularly strong guarantee in her affinity to the Indian Bhavani, who travels about and bathes like Nerthus and Holda, but is likewise called _Kali_ or _Mahakali_, the great _black_ goddess. In the underworld she is supposed to sit in judgment on souls. This office, the similar name and the black hue [...] make her exceedingly like _Halja_. And _Halja_ is one of the oldest and commonest conceptions of our heathenism."[40]

Grimm theorizes that the Helhest, a three legged-horse that roams the countryside "as a harbinger of plague and pestilence" in Danish folklore, was originally the steed of the goddess Hel, and that on this steed Hel roamed the land "picking up the dead that were her due." In addition, Grimm says that a wagon was once ascribed to Hel, with which Hel made journeys.[41] Grimm says that Hel is an example of a "half-goddess;" "one who cannot be shown to be either wife or daughter of a god, and who stands in a dependent relation to higher divinities" and that "half-goddesses" stand higher than "half-gods" in Germanic mythology.[42]

Hilda Ellis Davidson (1948) states that Hel "as a goddess" in surviving sources seems to belong to a genre of literary personification, that the word _hel_ is generally "used simply to signify death or the grave," and that the word often appears as the equivalent to the English 'death,' which Davidson states "naturally lends itself to personification by poets." Davidson explains that "whether this personification has originally been based on a belief in a goddess of death called Hel is another question," but that she does not believe that the surviving sources give any reason to believe so. Davidson adds that, on the other hand, various other examples of "certain supernatural women" connected with death are to be found in sources for Norse mythology, that they "seem to have been closely connected with the world of death, and were pictured as welcoming dead warriors," and that the depiction of Hel "as a goddess" in _Gylfaginning_ "might well owe something to these."[43]

In a later work (1998), Davidson states that the description of Hel found in chapter 33 of _Gylfaginning_ "hardly suggests a goddess." Davidson adds that "yet this is not the impression given in the account of Hermod's ride to Hel later in _Gylfaginning_ (49)" and points out that here Hel "[speaks] with authority as ruler of the underworld" and that from her realm "gifts are sent back to Frigg and Fulla by Balder's wife Nanna as from a friendly kingdom." Davidson posits that Snorri may have "earlier turned the goddess of death into an allegorical figure, just as he made Hel, the underworld of shades, a place 'where wicked men go,' like the Christian Hell (_Gylfaginning_ 3)." Davidson continues that:

  On the other hand, a goddess of death who represents the horrors of slaughter and decay is something well known elsewhere; the figure of Kali in India is an outstanding example. Like Snorri's Hel, she is terrifying to in appearance, black or dark in colour, usually naked, adorned with severed heads or arms or the corpses of children, her lips smeared with blood. She haunts the battlefield or cremation ground and squats on corpses. Yet for all this she is "the recipient of ardent devotion from countless devotees who approach her as their mother" [...].[44]

Davidson further compares to early attestations of the Irish goddesses Badb (Davidson points to the description of Badb from _The Destruction of Da Choca's Hostel_ where Badb is wearing a dusky mantle, has a large mouth, is dark in color, and has gray hair falling over her shoulders, or, alternatively, "as a red figure on the edge of the ford, washing the chariot of a king doomed to die") and The Morrígan. Davidson concludes that, in these examples, "here we have the fierce destructive side of death, with a strong emphasis on its physical horrors, so perhaps we should not assume that the gruesome figure of Hel is wholly Snorri's literary invention."[45]

John Lindow states that most details about Hel, as a figure, are not found outside of Snorri's writing in _Gylfaginning_, and says that when older skaldic poetry "says that people are 'in' rather than 'with' Hel, we are clearly dealing with a place rather than a person, and this is assumed to be the older conception," that the noun and place _Hel_ likely originally simply meant "grave," and that "the personification came later."[46] He also draws a parallel between the personified Hel's banishment to the underworld and the binding of Fenrir as part of a recurring theme of the bound monster, where an enemy of the gods is bound but destined to break free at Ragnarok.[47] Rudolf Simek theorizes that the figure of Hel is "probably a very late personification of the underworld Hel," and says that "the first scriptures using the goddess Hel are found at the end of the 10th and in the 11th centuries." Simek states that the allegorical description of Hel's house in _Gylfaginning_ "clearly stands in the Christian tradition," and that "on the whole nothing speaks in favour of there being a belief in Hel in pre-Christian times."[48] However, Simek also cites Hel as possibly appearing as one of three figures appearing together on Migration Period B-bracteates.[49]


Modern influence

In January 2017, the Icelandic Naming Committee ruled that parents could not name their child _Hel_ "on the grounds that the name would cause the child significant distress and trouble as it grows up".[50] [51]
