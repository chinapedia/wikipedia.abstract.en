A GENERALIZATION is the formulation of general concepts from specific instances by abstracting common properties. Generalizations posit the existence of a domain or set of elements, as well as one or more common characteristics shared by those elements (thus creating a conceptual model). As such, they are the essential basis of all valid deductive inferences. The process of verification is necessary to determine whether a generalization holds true for any given situation.

Generalization is the process of identifying the parts of a whole, as belonging to the whole. The parts, completely unrelated may be brought together as a group, belonging to the whole by establishing a common relation between them.

It must be stated that, the parts cannot be generalized into a whole until a common relation is established among ALL the parts. But this does not mean that the parts are unrelated, only that no common relation has been established yet for the generalization.

The concept of generalization has broad application in many connected disciplines, sometimes having a specialized context or meaning.

Of any two related concepts, such as _A_ and _B_, _A_ is a "generalization" of _B_, and _B_ is a special case of _A_, if and only if

-   every instance of concept _B_ is also an instance of concept _A_; and
-   there are instances of concept _A_ which are not instances of concept _B_.

For instance, _animal_ is a generalization of _bird_ because every bird is an animal, and there are animals which are not birds (dogs, for instance). (See also: Specialisation (biology)).


Hypernym and hyponym

The connection of _generalization_ to _specialization_ (or _particularization_) is reflected in the contrasting words hypernym and hyponym. A hypernym as a generic stands for a class or group of equally ranked items—for example, _tree_ stands for equally ranked items such as _peach_ and _oak_, and _ship_ stands for equally ranked items such as _cruiser_ and _steamer_. In contrast, a hyponym is one of the items included in the generic, such as _peach_ and _oak_ which are included in _tree_, and _cruiser_ and _steamer_ which are included in _ship_. A hypernym is superordinate to a hyponym, and a hyponym is subordinate to a hypernym.


Examples

Biological generalization

An animal is a generalization of a mammal, a bird, a fish, an amphibian and a reptile.

Cartographic generalization of geo-spatial data

Generalization has a long history in cartography as an art of creating maps for different scale and purpose. Cartographic generalization is the process of selecting and representing information of a map in a way that adapts to the scale of the display medium of the map. In this way, every map has, to some extent, been generalized to match the criteria of display. This includes small cartographic scale maps, which cannot convey every detail of the real world. Cartographers must decide and then adjust the content within their maps to create a suitable and useful map that conveys geospatial information within their representation of the world.

Generalization is meant to be context-specific. That is to say, correctly generalized maps are those that emphasize the most important map elements while still representing the world in the most faithful and recognizable way. The level of detail and importance in what is remaining on the map must outweigh the insignificance of items that were generalized, as to preserve the distinguishing characteristics of what makes the map useful and important.

Geometric generalizations

A polygon is a generalization of a 3-sided triangle, a 4-sided quadrilateral, and so on to _n_ sides.

A hypercube is a generalization of a 2-dimensional square, a 3-dimensional cube, and so on to _n_ dimensions.

A quadric, such as a hypersphere, ellipsoid, paraboloid, or hyperboloid, is a generalization of a conic section to higher dimensions.
