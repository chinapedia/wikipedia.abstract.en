The club was one of the first hockey clubs in Cardiff.[2] The first game was played on 5 December 1898, however within a few months the club had changed its name to Cardiff Hockey Club.[3] The Club moved from its original ground at Roath Park to Llandaff Fields and the Whitchurch Polo Fields.[4]

In 1920 when a ladies hockey club was formed, called Cardiff United.[5] In 1927 the club became part of the Cardiff Athletic Club, and played under the name of Cardiff Athletic Ladies HC until 1939.[6]

In May 1945 the Management Committee of Cardiff Athletic Club decided to form a Hockey Section by inviting the Cardiff Hockey Club to become a section of the Cardiff Athletic Club.[7] Around 2008 the club merged with the University of Wales Institute Cardiff to form the Cardiff & UWIC Hockey Club, which later became the Cardiff Metropolitan University.[8]

The home pitch is based at Sophia Gardens with training facilities at the Cardiff Metropolitan University.[9]
