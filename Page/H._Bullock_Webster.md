HAROLD BULLOCK WEBSTER (1855–1942) was a self-taught painter who worked in Canada, the U.K., and New Zealand.

Webster was born in England but emigrated as an adolescent to Canada. He began an apprenticeship as a clerk for the Hudson's Bay Company in 1874. He made many business trips to the Company's posts in the western part of Canada, such as northern Alberta and British Columbia.[1]

By 1878 he managed the trading post at Fort Connelly on Bear Lake in northern British Columbia. In 1880 he returned to Britain and emigrated from there to New Zealand, where he worked as a farmer's agent. On behalf of his employer, Thomas Russell, he travelled to Waikato, the Bay of Plenty, East Coast and Wanganui.[2] At the age of 83, he published in 1938 his _Memories of Sport and Travel Fifty Years Ago: From the Hudson's Bay Company to New Zealand_.[3]

While working at the Hudson's Bay Company from 1874 to 1880, he created an album of approximately 93 colour sketches that portrayed social life, activities, customs, and dress in the Company's posts, particularly near Stuart Lake and Fort McLeod. Several of his sketches show First Nations and Métis people, who participated in the Canadian fur trade. Some sketches were reprinted in _The Graphic_ magazine in England.[4]
