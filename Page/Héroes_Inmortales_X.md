_HÉROES INMORTALES_ X (Spanish for "Immortal Heroes Ten") was a professional wrestling event produced and scripted by the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA). The event took place on October 2, 2016 at Arena Monterrey in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. It was the tenth annual AAA show held in honor of deceased founder Antonio Peña and featured the _Copa Antonio Peña_ tournament named in his honor won by Pimpinela Escarlata.

The main event was scheduled to be a tag team match with the team of Psycho Clown and El Patrón Alberto facing off against Dr. Wagner Jr. and Pagano, but El Patrón Alberto did not show for the match after he was legitimately stabbed outside a restaurant in San Antonio, Texas. That match was moved down to the fifth match of the night and made a three-way match between the remaining competitors. During the match Psycho Clown's long time tag team partners, Murder Clown and Monster Clown, turned _rudo_ on him to allow Dr. Wagner Jr. to win the match. Dr. Wagner Jr. then proceeded to unmask Psycho Clown in the middle of the ring. After the reshuffled card Johnny Mundo defend the AAA Latin American Championship against Garza Jr. in the main event. In the sixth match of the night Daga defeated Australian Suicide in a _Lucha de Apuestas_, or bet match, forcing Australian Suicide to unmask.


Production

Background

In 1992 then-_Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre_ (CMLL) booker and match maker Antonio Peña left the company alongside a number of wrestlers to form the Mexican professional wrestling, company _Asistencia Asesoría y Administración_, later known simply as "AAA".[1][2] Over the next decade-and-a-half Peña and the team behind AAA built the promotion into one of the biggest wrestling companies in the world.[3] On October 5, 2006 Peña died from a heart attack.[4][5] After Peña's death his brother-in-law Jorge Roldan took control of the company with both his wife Marisela Peña, Antonio's sister, and Dorian Roldan (their son) also taking an active part in AAA. On October 7, 2007,AAA held a show in honor of Peña's memory, the first ever "Antonio Peña Memorial Show" (_Homenaje a Antonio Peña_ in Spanish).[6] The following year AAA held the second ever "Antonio Peña Memorial Show", making it an annual tradition for the company to commemorate the passing of their founder. In 2008 the show was rebranded as _Héroes Inmortales_ (Spanish for "Immortal Heroes"), retroactively rebranding the 2007 and 2008 event as _Héroes Inmortales_ I and _Héroes Inmortales_ II.[7]

AAA has held a _Héroes Inmortales_ every year since then, with the 2016 version of the show being _Héroes Inmortales_ X (10). The _Héroes Inmortales_ hosts the _Copa Antonio Peña_ ("Antonio Peña Cup") tournament each year, a multi-man tournament with various wrestlers from AAA or other promotions competing for a trophy. The tournament format has usually been either a gauntlet match or a multi-man _torneo cibernetico_ elimination match. Outside of the actual _Copa Antonio Peña_ trophy the winner is not guaranteed any other "prizes" as a result of winning the tournament. [8][9]

Storylines

The _Héroes Inmortales_ X show featured seven professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed either heels (referred to as _rudos_ in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or faces (_técnicos_ in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.[10]

In the early part of 2016 Pagano started a storyline feud with Psycho Clown, an AAA wrestler who, like Pagano, used a clown ring character. In Pagano's first match with AAA he, Damián 666 and Nicho defeated _Los Psycho Circus_ (Psycho Clown, Murder Clown and Monster Clown) by count-out.[11][12] Subsequently, Pagano and Psycho Clown faced off in a Hardcore wrestling match. During the match Pagano lit a wooden table on fire and then threw Psycho Clown through it to win the match.[13] Two weeks later the two clashed again, this time in a match that also included Pentagón Jr., a match that was once again won by Pagano.[14] After defeating Psycho Clown once more on July 8 and stealing Psycho Clown's wrestling mask, Pagano challenged Psycho Clown to put his mask on the line while Pagano would put up his hair in a _Luchas de Apuestas_, or "bet match". At the time Psycho Clown did not respond to the challenge.[15] At _Triplemanía_ XXIV Psycho Clown defeated Pagano, forcing Pagano to have all his hair shaved off. During the closing moments of the match Dr. Wagner Jr. came to the ring and after the match was over he challenged Psycho Clown to put his mask on the line at _Triplemanía_ XXV the following year.[16]

El Patrón Alberto defeated El Texano Jr. to win the AAA Mega Championship at the 2014 _Guerra de Titanes_ show.[17] Over the next year El Patrón defended the championship on several occasions, until he signed a contract with WWE in late 2015, which led to AAA announcing that since the WWE would not allow El Patrón to defend the championship it was vacated and they would hold a tournament to determine a new champion.[18] In September 2016 El Patrón Alberto left WWE, followed by AAA announcing that El Patrón would work the main event of _Héroes Inmortales_ X, teaming with Psycho Clown to take on Pagano and Dr. Wagner Jr.[19]

Long time rivals Daga and Australian Suicide first started to cross paths in early 2014, with their first high-profile match taking place at that year's _Rey de Reyes_ ("King of Kings") show. At _Rey de Reyes_ Daga successfully defended the AAA World Cruiserweight Championship against Australian Suicide, Argenis and Super Fly.[20][21] In subsequent months the two found themselves on opposite sides of various trios matches as their rivalry intensified. At _Triplemanía_ XXII Daga put his championship on the line in a multi-man match that also included Australian Suicide and several other wrestlers. During the match Daga eliminated Australian Suicide, but in the end El Hijo del Fantasma pinned Angélico to win the championship.[22][23] Over the following months Daga and Australian Suicide would interfere in each other's matches as a measure of revenge. During one run in Australian Suicide threw a steel chair at Daga's face with so much force that it gave Daga a black eye and lacerations to the face.

The team of Averno and Chessman, also known as _Los Hell Brothers_ won the vacant AAA World Tag Team Championship by defeating the teams of Aero Star/Fénix and Máscara Año 2000 Jr./Villano IV at the _Guerra de Titanes_ show.[24] _Los Hell Brothers_ subsequently made several successful title defenses and began bragging about how there were no challengers left for them to deal with, that "no man" could defeat them. In the spring of 2016 sisters-turned-rivals Mari Apache and Faby Apache reunited as Mari returned to the _tecnico_ side and started to team up with her sister on a regular basis. The two teamed up with their former step-mother Lady Apache and won the women's version of the 2016 _Lucha Libre_ World Cup.[25] Around the time of the World Cup Mari and Faby Apache challenged _Los Hell Brothers_, demanding that they put the tag team championship on the line, a challenge that Averno and Chessman turned down, acting very dismissing and sexist in the process. During the July 8 AAA Television taping Averno and Chessman dressed up as a pair of frumpy women as they mocked _Los Apaches_.[26] At the subsequent taping _Los Apaches_ distracted Averno and Chessman during a title defense against Jack Evans and Angélico, which led to Averno and Chessman losing the tag team title. Afterwards it was announced that Averno and Chessman had finally agree to face _Los Apaches_ at _Triplemanía_ XXIV.[27]
