MEXICO–TAIWAN RELATIONS refers to the diplomatic relations between Mexico and the Republic of China (Taiwan). Both nations are members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.


History

Beginning in 1949, Mexico maintained diplomatic relations with the Kuomintang government of the Republic of China.[1] However, official relations between Mexico and the Republic of China (Taiwan) ended in 1971 when Mexico voted in favor of the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 which recognized the People's Republic of China (mainland China) "as the only legitimate representative of China to the United Nations".[2][3] Since the adoption of UN Resolution 2758, Mexico has maintained official diplomatic relations with mainland China and unofficial diplomatic relations with Taiwan since 1972.[4]

In order to promote trade, in 1990 Mexico opened a "Mexican Trade Services" office in Taipei (which held no diplomatic status). The office was later upgraded in 1991 to include a consular section and it was known as the "Mexican Trade Services, Documentation and Cultural Office".[5] In 1993, Taiwan opened a 'Taipei Economic and Cultural Office' in Mexico City.[6] Both representative offices are unofficially _de facto_ embassies in each nations' capitals, respectively.

Both Mexico and Taiwan are members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. In November 2002, Taiwanese Representative of the President, Yuan T. Lee, visited Los Cabos, Mexico to attend the APEC summit. He was the first high ranking representative to visit the country.[7]
