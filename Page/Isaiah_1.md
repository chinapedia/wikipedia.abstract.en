ISAIAH 1 is the first chapter of the Book of Isaiah in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet Isaiah, and is one of the Book of the Prophets.[1][2] This chapter provides an introduction to the issues of sin, judgement, and hoped-for restoration which form the overarching structure of the whole book. It concludes (verse 31) with 'a reference to the burning of those who trust in their own strength', in a fire which cannot be 'quenched' (Heb. root: k-b-h), a relatively rare word which is also used in the last verse of the book (verse 66:24: 'their fire shall not be quenched'), thereby linking together beginning and ending of this whole book.

Structure

The New King James Version organises this chapter as follows:

-   Isaiah 1:1 = Subtitle or superscription: the vision of Isaiah
-   = The Wickedness of Judah

-   = The Degenerate City


Superscription (1:1)

The introductory verse of the Book of Isaiah is closely comparable to the opening of the books of Jeremiah, Hosea, Amos, Micah, and Zephaniah.

Verse 1

    _The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah._[4]

-   "Vision" (Hebrew: ◊ó◊ñ◊ï◊ü _chƒÉz√¥n_, from the verb, ◊ó◊ñ◊î _ch√¢z√¢h_, "to see, to behold"): Introducing the whole book as a vision in the title (see Obadiah 1, Nahum 1:1, Amos 1:1, Micah 1:1, Habakkuk 1:1), as well as in : _Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold they are written in the vision of Isaiah._
-   "The son of Amoz": not of Amos the prophet. Jewish tradition has a note that Amoz, the father of Isaiah, was the brother of Amaziah, king of Judah, so that Isaiah was of the royal family.[5]

According to the Pulpit Commentary, the prophecies of Isaiah "concern primarily the kingdom of Judah, not that of Israel".[6] This verse "is probably best understood as the heading of the first great collection of prophecies" in chapters 1-12. Chapter 13 initiates a proclamation against Babylon.[7]


The great accusation (1:2-4)

Isaiah calls the people of Judah "a thoughtless people".[8]

Verse 2

    _Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth;_

        _for the Lord has spoken:_

    _"Children have I reared and brought up,_

        _but they have rebelled against me."_[9]

Isaiah's opening words recall those of Moses in Deuteronomy 32:1:

    ''"Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak;
    _And hear, O earth, the words of my mouth._[10]

The New Century Version combines these two exhortations into one:

    _Heaven and earth, listen, because the Lord is speaking._[11]

Verse 3

    _"The ox knows its owner,_

        _and the donkey its master's crib,_

    _but Israel does not know,_

        _my people do not understand."_[12]

This verse has played an important part in Christian Christmas tradition, as much of Isaiah prophecy treated as pointing forward to the time of Christ, and the mention of "the ox and the donkey/ass" regarded to be connected the accounts of the birth of Jesus. The animals in the Christmas crib are first mentioned in the apocryphal Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew (dated to the eighth or ninth century CE), where it is said that Mary 'put her child in a manger, and an ox and an ass worshipped him. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: "The ox knows his owner and the ass his master's crib"'[13]


The devastation of Judah (1:5‚Äì9)

Isaiah uses images of the sick individual (verses 5-6) and the desolate nation (verses 7-8) to portray the sinfulness of his nation. The "daughter of Zion" (i.e. the city of Jerusalem) remained an isolated stronghold when Sennacherib, king of Assyria attacked the fortified cities of Judah in 701 BCE.[14]


Pious corruption and its cleansing (1:10‚Äì20)

Considered 'the most powerful and sustained' prophetic outburst at religious unreality (cf. ; ; ; ; ), the vehemence of this prophecy is built up together in its form and content. First, God rejected the offerings, then the offerers (verses 11‚Äì12), the specific accusation in the lurid conclusion of verse 15: _Your hands are full of blood_, followed by the command to 'have done with evil' in 'eight thunderous calls', ending in the reminder of the life-and-death alternatives similar to .

Verse 11

    ''I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams
    ''And the fat of fed cattle.
    ''I do not delight in the blood of bulls,
    _Or of lambs or goats_.[15]

Anglican bishop Robert Lowth translates as _I am cloyed with the burnt offerings of rams ..._[16]

According to the Torah, burnt offerings formed a part of the required sacrifice on all great occasions, as at the Passover (), at the Feast of Weeks (), at the Feast of Tabernacles (, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 36), at the Feast of Trumpets (), and on the great Day of Atonement (), as well as being commanded as the sole sacrifice for a trespass offering (, 18).[17]

Verse 18

    _Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord:_

        _though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;_
        _though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool._[18]

The phrase "reason together" has a tone of "legal argument"; similar wording appears in .


God's lament and resolve (1:21‚Äì31)

The theme of this part is the vanished glory as in a funeral dirge, lamenting the moral loss or justice, but not concerning the wealth.

Verse 26

    _"And I will restore your judges as at the first,_

        _and your counselors as at the beginning._

    _Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness,_

        _the faithful city."_[19]

The King James Version and American Standard Version speak of "judges" but the New International Version translates (_shaphat_) as "leaders".

Verses 29-31

The Jerusalem Bible separates out verses 29-31 as an oracle "against tree worship", suggesting that the prophet "possibly has Samaria in mind".[20]

Verse 29

    _For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen._[21]

-   "Oaks", or "terebinths" (_Pistacia palaestina_),[22] may refer to the "oaks" in .
-   "Which ye have desired" or "which give you such pleasure"[23]

Verse 30

    _For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water._[24]

-   "Garden": may refer to the "gardens" in .

Verse 31

    _And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them._[25]

-   "Quench": Illusion of a fire ("spark") which cannot be 'quenched', from the Hebrew root: k-b-h (, _kabah_, "to be quenched or extinguished, to go out"[26]), links this verse (the beginning chapter) to the last verse (of the ending chapter) of the whole book (Isaiah 66:24: 'their fire shall not be quenched'). Moreover, it is also used in three other places: (1) of the servant in 42:3, that 'a dimly burning wick ("smoking flax") he will not quench'; (2) that 'the fire devouring Edom "will not be quenched"' (34:10), and (3) those who oppose the LORD'S path are 'quenched like a wick' (43:17).
