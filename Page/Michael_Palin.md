SIR MICHAEL EDWARD PALIN, (; born 5 May 1943),[1] is an English comedian, actor, writer and television presenter. He was a member of the comedy group Monty Python. Since 1980 he has made a number of travel documentaries.[2]

Palin wrote most of his comedic material with fellow Python member Terry Jones. Before Monty Python, they had worked on other shows such as the _Ken Dodd Show_, _The Frost Report_, and _Do Not Adjust Your Set_. Palin appeared in some of the most famous Python sketches, including "Argument Clinic", "Dead Parrot sketch", "The Lumberjack Song", "The Spanish Inquisition", "Bicycle Repair Man" and "The Fish-Slapping Dance".

Palin continued to work with Jones after Python, co-writing _Ripping Yarns_. He has also appeared in several films directed by fellow Python Terry Gilliam and made notable appearances in other films such as _A Fish Called Wanda_ (1988), for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.[3] In a 2005 poll to find _The Comedians' Comedian_, he was voted the 30th favourite by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.[4]

After Python, he began a new career as a travel writer and travel documentarian. His journeys have taken him across the world, including the North and South Poles, the Sahara Desert, the Himalayas, Eastern Europe, Brazil, and North Korea. Having been awarded a CBE for services to television in the 2000 New Year Honours, Palin received a knighthood in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to travel, culture and geography.[5][6] From 2009–2012 Palin was the president of the Royal Geographical Society.[7]

On 12 May 2013, Palin was made a BAFTA fellow, the highest honour that is conferred by the organisation.[8]


Early and personal life

Palin was born in Ranmoor, Sheffield,[9] the second child and only son of Edward Moreton Palin (1900–1977)[10][11] and Mary Rachel Lockhart (née Ovey; 1903–1990). His father was a Shrewsbury School and Cambridge University-educated engineer working for a steel firm.[12] His maternal grandfather, Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Lockhart Ovey, DSO, was High Sheriff of Oxfordshire in 1927.[13] He was educated at Birkdale and Shrewsbury School. His sister Angela was nine years older than he was. Despite the age gap the two had a close relationship until her suicide in 1987.[14][15] He has ancestral roots in Letterkenny, County Donegal.[16]

When he was five years old, Palin had his first acting experience at Birkdale playing Martha Cratchit in a school performance of _A Christmas Carol_. At the age of 10, Palin, still interested in acting, made a comedy monologue and read a Shakespeare play to his mother while playing all the parts.[17] After his school days in 1962 he went on to read modern history at Brasenose College, Oxford.[18] With fellow student Robert Hewison he performed and wrote, for the first time, comedy material at a university Christmas party.[19] Terry Jones, also a student in Oxford, saw that performance and began writing together with Hewison and Palin.[20] In the same year Palin joined the Brightside and Carbrook Co-operative Society Players and first gained fame when he won an acting award at a Co-op drama festival.[21] He also performed and wrote in the Oxford Revue (called the Et ceteras) with Jones.[22]

In 1966 he married Helen Gibbins, whom he first met in 1959 on holiday in Southwold in Suffolk.[23] This meeting was later fictionalised in Palin's play _East of Ipswich_.[24] The couple have three children and four grandchildren.[25] Daughter Rachel is a BBC TV director, whose work includes _MasterChef: The Professionals_, shown on BBC Two throughout October and November 2010.[26][27] Son William is Director of Conservation at the Old Royal Naval College, Greenwich, London [28] and oversaw the 2018-19 restoration of the Painted Hall [29]. A photograph of William as a baby briefly appeared in _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ as "Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film".

His nephew is the theatre designer Jeremy Herbert.[30]

Palin is an agnostic.[31]


Early career

After finishing university in 1965 Palin became a presenter on a comedy pop show called _Now!_ for the television contractor Television Wales and the West.[32] At the same time Palin was contacted by Jones, who had left university a year earlier, for assistance in writing a theatrical documentary about sex through the ages.[33] Although this project was eventually abandoned, it brought Palin and Jones together as a writing duo and led them to write comedy for various BBC programmes, such as _The Ken Dodd Show_, _The Billy Cotton Bandshow_, and _The Illustrated Weekly Hudd_.[34] They collaborated in writing lyrics for an album by Barry Booth called Diversions. They were also in the team of writers working for _The Frost Report_, whose other members included Frank Muir, Barry Cryer, Marty Feldman, Ronnie Barker, Ronnie Corbett, Dick Vosburgh and future Monty Python members Graham Chapman, John Cleese and Eric Idle. Although the members of Monty Python had already encountered each other over the years, _The Frost Report_ was the first time all the British members of Monty Python (its sixth member, Terry Gilliam, was at that time an American citizen) worked together.[35] During the run of _The Frost Report_ the Palin/Jones team contributed material to two shows starring John Bird: _The Late Show_ and _A Series of Birds_. For _A Series of Birds_ the Palin/Jones team had their first experience of writing narrative instead of the short sketches they were accustomed to conceiving.[36]

Following _The Frost Report_ the Palin/Jones team worked both as actors and writers on the show _Twice a Fortnight_ with Graeme Garden, Bill Oddie and Jonathan Lynn, and the successful children's comedy show _Do Not Adjust Your Set_ with Idle and David Jason. The show also featured musical numbers by the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, including future Monty Python musical collaborator Neil Innes. The animations for _Do Not Adjust Your Set_ were made by Terry Gilliam. Eager to work with Palin[37] sans Jones, Cleese later asked him to perform in _How to Irritate People_ together with Chapman and Tim Brooke-Taylor. The Palin/Jones team were reunited for _The Complete and Utter History of Britain_.

_Monty Python_

On the strength of their work on _The Frost Report_ and other programmes, Cleese and Chapman had been offered a show by the BBC, but Cleese was reluctant to do a two-man show for various reasons, among them Chapman's reputedly difficult personality. During this period Cleese contacted Palin about doing the show that would ultimately become _Monty Python's Flying Circus_.[38] At the same time the success of _Do Not Adjust Your Set_ had led Palin, Jones, Idle and Gilliam to be offered their own series and, while it was still in production, Palin agreed to Cleese's proposal and brought along Idle, Jones and Gilliam. Thus the formation of the Monty Python troupe has been referred to as a result of Cleese's desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.[39]

In _Monty Python_, Palin played various roles, which ranged from manic enthusiasm (such as the lumberjack of the Lumberjack Song, or Herbert Anchovy, host of the game show "Blackmail") to unflappable calmness (such as the Dead parrot vendor or Cheese Shop proprietor). As a straight man he was often a foil to the rising ire of characters portrayed by John Cleese. He also played timid, socially inept characters such as Arthur Putey, the man who sits quietly as a marriage counsellor (Eric Idle) makes love to his wife (Carol Cleveland), and Mr. Anchovy, a chartered accountant who wants to become a lion tamer. He also appeared as the "It's" man at the beginning of most episodes.

Palin frequently co-wrote sketches with Terry Jones and also initiated the "Spanish Inquisition sketch", which included the catchphrase "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!" He also composed songs with Jones including "The Lumberjack Song", "Every Sperm is Sacred" and "Spam". His solo musical compositions included "Decomposing Composers" and "Finland".[40]


Other work

After the _Monty Python_ television series ended in 1974, the Palin/Jones team worked on _Ripping Yarns_, an intermittent television comedy series broadcast over three years from 1976. They had earlier collaborated on the play _Secrets_ from the BBC series _Black and Blue_ in 1973. He starred as Dennis the Peasant in Terry Gilliam's 1977 film _Jabberwocky_. Palin also appeared in _All You Need Is Cash_ (1978) as Eric Manchester (based on Derek Taylor), the press agent for the Rutles. In 1980, Palin co-wrote _Time Bandits_ with Terry Gilliam. He also acted in the film.

In 1982, Palin wrote and starred in _The Missionary_, co-starring Maggie Smith. In it, he plays the Reverend Charles Fortescue, who is recalled from Africa to aid prostitutes. He co-starred with Maggie Smith again in the 1984 comedy film _A Private Function_. In 1984, he reunited with Terry Gilliam to appear in _Brazil_. He appeared in the comedy film _A Fish Called Wanda_, for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.[41] Cleese reunited the main cast almost a decade later to make _Fierce Creatures_. After filming for _Fierce Creatures_ finished, Palin went on a travel journey for a BBC documentary and, returning a year later, found that the end of _Fierce Creatures_ had failed at test screenings and had to be reshot.

After _Fierce Creatures_ and a small part in _The Wind in the Willows_, a film directed by and starring Terry Jones, it would be twenty more years until Palin's next film role, as Soviet politician Vyacheslav Molotov in the 2017 satirical black comedy _The Death of Stalin_. Palin also appeared with John Cleese in his documentary, _The Human Face_. Palin was cast in a supporting role in the Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan romantic comedy _You've Got Mail_, but his role was eventually cut entirely.[42]

Palin has also appeared in serious drama. In 1991 Palin appeared in a film, _American Friends_, he wrote based upon a real event in the life of his great-grandfather, a fellow at St John's College, Oxford.[43][44] In that same year he also played the part of a headmaster in Alan Bleasdale's Channel 4 drama series _GBH_.

Palin also had a small cameo role in Australian soap opera _Home and Away_. He played an English surfer with a fear of sharks, who interrupts a conversation between two main characters to ask whether there were any sharks in the sea. This was filmed while he was in Australia for the _Full Circle_ series, with a segment about the filming of the role featuring in the series. In November 2005, he appeared in the _John Peel's Record Box_ documentary.[45]

In 2013 Michael Palin appeared in a First World War drama titled _The Wipers Times_ written by Ian Hislop and Nick Newman.[46] At the Cannes Film Festival in 2016, it was announced that Palin was set to star alongside Adam Driver in Terry Gilliam's _The Man Who Killed Don Quixote_.[47] Palin, however, dropped out of the film after it ran into a financial problem.[48]

Palin while speaking at the Edinburgh International Film Festival announced that he was presenting the two-part documentary _Michael Palin in North Korea_ to be broadcast on the British television network Channel 5.[49] The documentary was broadcast in September 2018, in two one-hour segments on Channel 5 in the UK and in a single two-hour programme on National Geographic in the United States.[50][51][52] It was broadcast again by Channel 5, in a single two-hour programme in December 2018.[53]

Activism

Palin assisted Campaign for Better Transport and others with campaigns on sustainable transport, particularly those relating to urban areas, and has been president of the campaign since 1986.[54] On 2 January 2011, he became the first person to sign the UK-based Campaign for Better Transport's Fair Fares Now campaign. In July 2015, he signed an open letter and gave an interview to support "a strong BBC at the centre of British life" at a time the government was reviewing the corporation's size and activities.[55]

In July 2010, Palin sent a message of support for the Dongria Kondh tribe of India, who are resisting mining on their land by the company Vedanta Resources. Palin said, "I've been to the Nyamgiri Hills in Orissa and seen the forces of money and power that Vedanta Resources have arrayed against a people who have occupied their land for thousands of years, who husband the forest sustainably and make no great demands on the state or the government. The tribe I visited simply want to carry on living in the villages that they and their ancestors have always lived in".[56]


Television documentaries

Travel

Palin's first travel documentary was segment 4 of the 1980 BBC Television series _Great Railway Journeys of the World_, entitled _Confessions of a Trainspotter_. Throughout the hour long show, Palin humorously reminisces about his childhood hobby of train spotting, while he travels throughout the UK by train, from London to the Kyle of Lochalsh, via Manchester, York, Newcastle upon Tyne, Edinburgh and Inverness. He rides vintage train lines and trains including _Flying Scotsman_. At the Kyle of Lochalsh, Palin bought the station's long metal platform sign and is seen lugging it back to London with him.

In 1994, Palin travelled through Ireland for the same series, entitled "Derry to Kerry". In a quest for family roots, he attempted to trace his great grandmother – Brita Gallagher – who set sail from Ireland years ago during the Great Famine (1845–1849), bound for a new life in Burlington, New Jersey. The series is a trip along the Palin family line.

Starting in 1989, Palin appeared as presenter in a series of travel programmes made for the BBC. It was after the veteran TV globetrotter Alan Whicker and journalist Miles Kington turned down presenting the first of these, _Around the World in 80 Days with Michael Palin_, that gave Palin the opportunity to present his first and subsequent travel shows.[57] These programmes have been broadcast worldwide in syndication, and were also sold on VHS tape and later on DVD:

-   _Around the World in 80 Days with Michael Palin_ (Travel 1988; Programme release 1989): travelling as closely as possible the path described in the famous Jules Verne story without using aircraft.
-   _Pole to Pole with Michael Palin_ (Travel 1991; Programme release 1992): travelling from the North Pole to the South Pole, following as closely as possible the 30-degree line of longitude, over as much land as possible, i.e., through Europe and Africa.
-   _Full Circle with Michael Palin_ (Travel 1995/96; Programme release 1997): in which he circumnavigated the lands around the Pacific Ocean anti-clockwise; a journey of almost starting on Little Diomede Island in the Bering Strait and taking him through Asia, Oceania and the Americas.
-   _Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure_ (1999): retracing the footsteps of Ernest Hemingway through the United States, Europe, Africa and the Caribbean.
-   _Sahara with Michael Palin_ (Travel 2001/02; Programme release 2002): in which he trekked around and through the world's largest desert.
-   _Himalaya with Michael Palin_ (Travel 2003/04; Programme release 2004): in which he travels through the Himalaya region.
-   _Michael Palin's New Europe_ (Travel 2006/07; Programme release 2007): in which he travels through Central and Eastern Europe.
-   _Brazil with Michael Palin_ (2012) in which he travels through Brazil.[58]
-   _Michael Palin in North Korea_ (2018, released in the US as _North Korea From the Inside with Michael Palin_) in which he visits North Korea at the time of the April 2018 inter-Korean summit.[59]

Following each trip, Palin wrote a book about his travels, providing information and insights not included in the TV programme. Each book is illustrated with photographs by Basil Pao, the stills photographer who was on the team. (Exception: the first book, _Around the World in 80 Days_, contains some pictures by Pao but most are by other photographers.)

All seven of these books were also made available as audio books, and all of them are read by Palin himself. _Around the World in 80 Days_ and _Hemingway Adventure_ are unabridged, while the other four books were made in both abridged and unabridged versions, although the unabridged versions can be very difficult to find.[60]

For four of the trips a photography book was made by Pao, each with an introduction written by Palin. These are large coffee-table style books with pictures printed on glossy paper. The majority of the pictures are of various people encountered on the trip, as informal portraits or showing them engaged in some interesting activity. Some of the landscape photos are displayed as two-page spreads.

Palin's travel programmes are responsible for a phenomenon termed the "Palin effect": areas of the world that he has visited suddenly become popular tourist attractions – for example, the significant increase in the number of tourists interested in Peru after Palin visited Machu Picchu.[61] In a 2006 survey of "15 of the world's top travel writers" by _The Observer_, Palin named Peru's Pongo de Mainique (canyon below the Machu Picchu) his "favourite place in the world".[62]

Palin notes in his book of _Around the World in 80 Days_ that the final leg of his journey could originally have taken him and his crew on one of the trains involved in the Clapham Junction rail crash, but they arrived ahead of schedule and caught an earlier train.

Art and history

In recent years, Palin has written and presented occasional documentary programmes on artists that interest him. The first, on Scottish painter Anne Redpath, was _Palin on Redpath_ in 1997. In _The Bright Side of Life_ (2000), Palin continued on a Scottish theme, looking at the work of the Scottish Colourists. Two further programmes followed on European painters; _Michael Palin and the Ladies Who Loved Matisse_ (2004) and _Michael Palin and the Mystery of Hammershøi_ (2005), about the French artist Henri Matisse and Danish artist Vilhelm Hammershøi respectively. The DVD _Michael Palin on Art_ contains all these documentaries except for the Matisse programme.

In November 2008, Palin presented a First World War documentary about Armistice Day, 11 November 1918, when thousands of soldiers lost their lives in battle after the war had officially ended. Palin filmed on the battlefields of Northern France and Belgium for the programme, called the _Last Day of World War One_, produced for the BBC's _Timewatch_ series.[63]


Awards and honours

.]] Palin was instrumental in setting up the Michael Palin Centre for Stammering Children in 1993.[64] Also in 1993, each member of Monty Python had an asteroid named after them. Palin's is Asteroid 9621 Michaelpalin.[65] In 2003, inside the Globe a commemorative stone was placed - Palin has his own stone, to mark donors to the theatre, but it is misspelt as "Michael Pallin". The story goes that John Cleese paid for the stone, and mischievously insisted on misspelling his name.[66]

In honour of his achievements as a traveller, especially rail travel, Palin has two British trains named after him. In 2002, Virgin Trains' new £5 million high speed Super Voyager train number 221130 was named "Michael Palin" – it carries his name externally and a plaque is located adjacent to the onboard shop with information on Palin and his many journeys.[67] Also, National Express East Anglia named a British Rail Class 153 (unit number 153335) after him. (He is also a model railway enthusiast.[68])

plaque in Palin's home city of Sheffield, England]] In 2008, he received the James Joyce Award of the Literary and Historical Society in Dublin. In recognition of his services to the promotion of geography, Palin was awarded the Livingstone Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in March 2009, along with a Fellowship of this Society (FRGS).[69] In June 2013, he was similarly honoured in Canada with a gold medal for achievements in geography by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society.[70] In June 2009, Palin was elected for a three-year term as President of the Royal Geographical Society.[71][72] Because of his self-described "amenable, conciliatory character" Michael Palin has been referred to as unofficially "Britain's Nicest Man."[73]

In September 2013, Moorlands School, Leeds named one of their school houses "Palin" after him.[74] The University of St Andrews awarded Palin an honorary Doctor of Science degree during their June 2017 graduation ceremonies, with the degree recognising his contribution to the public's understanding of contemporary geography.[75] He joins his fellow Pythons John Cleese and Terry Jones in receiving an honorary degree from the Fife institution.[76] In October 2018, the Royal Canadian Geographical Society awarded Palin the first Louie Kamookak Medal for advances in geography, for his book on the history of the polar exploration vessel HMS _Erebus_.[77]

He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2000 New Year Honours.[78]

Palin was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to travel, culture and geography. Palin is the only member of the Monty Python team to receive a knighthood[79] (John Cleese had turned down a CBE in 1996, calling it "too silly", and declined a life peerage in 1999).[80]
