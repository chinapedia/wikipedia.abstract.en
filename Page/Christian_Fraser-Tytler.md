Early life

Christian Fraser-Tytler was born at Elie in Fifeshire, the daughter of John Campbell Shairp, a lawyer and the 9th Laird of Houstoun, Uphall, in Linlithgowshire, and his wife Harriet Caroline, daughter of Sir Thomas Erskine, 2nd Baronet of Cambo. She was educated at home by a governess. In 1917, during World War I, she joined the Foreign Office as a clerical officer.[1][2][3][4]


Marriage

Aldourie_Castle_-_geograph.org.uk_-_885399.jpg In 1919 she was working with the British delegation to the negotiations for the Treaty of Versailles. There she met Major Neil Fraser-Tytler of Aldourie and Balnain, Inverness-shire, who had won a DSO and Bar with the Royal Field Artillery (RFA) during the recent war. They were married on 19 June 1919, and she became the Châtelain of Aldourie Castle on the shores of Loch Ness.[5][6]

Neil Fraser-Tytler continued in the Territorial Army in the 1920s, commanding his old Inverness battery in the 75th (Highland) Brigade, RFA, and being promoted to Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel in 1924.[7] He also published his wartime letters to his father under the title of _Field Guns in France_.[8] However, his health became increasingly poor, believed to be the result of having been gassed during the war. He died in 1937 after a long illness through which his wife nursed him.[9][10]


Auxiliary Territorial Service

In 1938, as international tensions rose towards the Munich Crisis, the British government established the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) as the women's branch of the British Army. Christian Fraser-Tytler raised the Inverness unit of the ATS. This was based at the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders' depot and its members wore skirts of the regiment's Cameron of Erracht tartan rather than khaki.[11]

When told that she had been ordered to revert to khaki when she joined the WO, he replied 'Well, we'll have to see about that', and shortly afterwards she was permitted to wear the kilt once more.[13]

From 1941 onwards all Heavy Anti-Aircraft gun batteries and regiments coming from the training regiments were designated 'Mixed', with women comprising about two-thirds of their personnel. Despite practical difficulties there were some mixed searchlight batteries and one regiment (93rd Searchlight Regiment) that was almost wholly female. By the time Fraser-Tytler joined AA Command at its headquarters at Hillingdon House, Uxbridge, more than half the total strength of the ATS was employed in or supporting its units.[15][16]

Operation Diver involved the relocation of hundreds of static AA guns to temporary sites along the South Coast of England, with the ATS housed in hastily constructed tented camps until huts could be provided.[17][18] In the winter of 1944–45 the V-1 attacks were switched to Brussels and Antwerp, and several Mixed HAA regiments were withdrawn from AA Command to defend those cities.[19][20]

Christian Fraser-Tytler was appointed a CBE (Military) – one of the first awarded to a woman – in 1941, and received the Territorial Decoration.[21][22]


Voluntary service

On leaving the ATS at the end of World War II, Christian Fraser-Tytler returned to Aldourie Castle and took up voluntary work. Locally, she organised the building of the village hall and founded the local branch of the Women's Rural Institute. She became a Justice of the peace, led the Women's Voluntary Service in Inverness-shire and Ross and Cromarty, and played a prominent part in the Young Women's Christian Association, serving as Scottish representative on the national executive.[23][24]


Family

She had two daughters by Lt-Col Neil Fraser-Tytler:[25]

-   Ann Fraser-Tytler, born 17 April 1920, married, 4 October 1947, her kinsman Sir Thomas David Erskine of Cambo, 5th Baronet.[26]
-   Mary Hermione Fraser-Tytler, born 6 June 1922.

Christian Fraser-Tytler died on 1 July 1995.[27][28]
