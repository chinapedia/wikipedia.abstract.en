A suicide bombing occurred in Iraq on 24 November 2016[1] when a truck bomb exploded at a petrol station in Hillah, some 100 kilometers (62 miles) from southern Baghdad, killing at least 125 people and injuring many others.

Shia pilgrims were en route back to Iran after the 2016 Arba'een Pilgrimage.[2][3][4][5] Besides Iranians, people from Basra and Nasiriyah were also killed in the attack.[6][7]

The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for it.


Bombing

The pilgrims were on their way back to Iran from the holy city of Karbala after participating in the annual Arba'een Pilgrimage. According to a police official, five buses filled with pilgrims stopped by a famous restaurant, next to a petrol station, burst into flames after the detonation of an "explosives-laden truck".[8] According to a report, the bomb had been packed with 500 liters of ammonium nitrate.[9]

Reportedly, the Hillah suicide truck bombing happened a day after dozens of bombings in and around Baghdad by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in which 31 people were killed and over 100 injured.[10][11] There were some attacks during Arba'een this year, but these were insignificant compared to incidents in previous years. Despite ongoing dangers, people from around the world continued their journey to Karbala.[12] According to Iraqi officials, approximately three million Iranians visited Iraq, making them the largest contingent of foreigners at the Arba'een Pilgrimage in 2016.[13]


Perpetrator

The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for the attack.[14]
