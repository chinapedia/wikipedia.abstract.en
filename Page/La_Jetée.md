_LA JETÉE_ () ("The Jetty", here referring to the publicly accessible top of an infrastructural pier or jetty at an airport) is a 1962 French Left Bank science fiction featurette by Chris Marker. Constructed almost entirely from still photos, it tells the story of a post-nuclear war experiment in time travel. It is 28 minutes long and shot in black and white.

It won the Prix Jean Vigo for short film. The 1995 science fiction film _12 Monkeys_ was inspired by and borrows several concepts directly from _La Jetée_, as does the 2015 _12 Monkeys_ television series developed from the film.


Plot

A man (Davos Hanich) is a prisoner in the aftermath of World War III in post-apocalyptic Paris, where survivors live underground in the _Palais de Chaillot_ galleries. Scientists research time travel, hoping to send test subjects to different time periods "to call past and future to the rescue of the present". They have difficulty finding subjects who can mentally withstand the shock of time travel. The scientists eventually settle upon the prisoner; his key to the past is a vague but obsessive memory from his pre-war childhood of a woman (Hélène Chatelain) he had seen on the observation platform ("the jetty") at Orly Airport shortly before witnessing a startling incident there. He did not understand exactly what happened, but knew he had seen a man die.

After several attempts, he reaches the pre-war period. He meets the woman from his memory, and they develop a romantic relationship. After his successful passages to the past, the experimenters attempt to send him into the far future. In a brief meeting with the technologically advanced people of the future, he is given a power unit sufficient to regenerate his own destroyed society.

Upon his return, with his mission accomplished, he discerns that he is to be executed by his jailers. He is contacted by the people of the future, who offer to help him escape to their time permanently; but he asks instead to be returned to the pre-war time of his childhood, hoping to find the woman again. He is returned to the past, placed on the jetty at the airport, and it occurs to him that the child version of himself is probably also there at the same time. He is more concerned with locating the woman, and quickly spots her. However, as he rushes to her, he notices an agent of his jailers who has followed him and realizes the agent is about to kill him. In his final moments, he comes to understand that the incident he witnessed as a child, which has haunted him ever since, was his own death.

Production

_La Jetée_ is constructed almost entirely from optically printed photographs playing out as a photomontage of varying rhythm. It contains only one brief shot (of the woman mentioned above sleeping and suddenly waking up) originating on a motion-picture camera, this due to the fact that Marker could only afford to hire one for an afternoon. The stills were taken with a Pentax Spotmatic[1] and the motion-picture segment was shot with a 35 mm Arriflex.[2] The film has no dialogue aside from small sections of muttering in German and people talking in an airport terminal. The story is told by a voice-over narrator. The scene in which the hero and the woman look at a cut-away trunk of a tree is a reference to Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film _Vertigo_ which Marker also references in his 1983 film _Sans soleil_.[3]


Interpretation

In _Black and Blue_, her study of postwar French fiction, Carol Mavor describes _La Jetée_ as taking "place in a no-place (u-topia) in no-time (u-chronia)" which she connects to the time and place of the fairy tale. She goes on to say "even the sound of the title resonates with the fairy-tale surprise of finding oneself in another world: La Jetée evokes 'là j'étais' (there I was)". By "u-topia", Mavor does not refer to "utopia" as the word is commonly used; she also describes an ambiguity of dystopia/utopia in the film: "It is dystopia with the hope of utopia, or is it utopia cut by the threat of dystopia."[4]

Tor Books blogger Jake Hinkson summed up his interpretation in the title of an essay about the film, "There's No Escape Out of Time". He elaborated:

Hinkson also addresses the symbolic use of imagery: "The Man is blindfolded with some kind of padded device and he sees images. The Man is chosen for this assignment because ... he has maintained a sharp mind because of his attachment to certain images. Thus a film told through the use of still photos becomes about looking at images." He further observes that Marker himself did not refer to _La Jetée_ as a film, but as photo novel.[5]


Reception

In 2010, _Time_ ranked _La Jetée_ first in its list of "Top 10 time-travel movies".[6] In 2012, in correspondence with the _Sight & Sound_ Poll, the British Film Institute deemed _La Jetée_ as the 50th greatest film of all time.[7]

Science fiction writer William Gibson considers the film one of his main influences.[8]


Legacy

The video for Sigue Sigue Sputnik's 1989 single "Dancerama" is also an homage to _La Jetée_.[9]

The film is one of the influences in the video for David Bowie's "Jump They Say" (1993).[10]

Terry Gilliam's _12 Monkeys_ (1995) was inspired by and takes several concepts directly from _La Jetée_ (acknowledging this debt in the opening credits).

The 2003 short film _La puppé_ is both an homage to and a parody of _La Jetée_.[11]

The 2007 Mexican film _Year of the Nail_, which is told entirely through still photographs, was inspired by _La Jetée_.

Kode9 in collaboration with Ms. Haptic, Marcel Weber (aka MFO), and Lucy Benson created an homage to _La Jetée_ in 2011, for the Unsound Festival.[12]

Northern Irish rock band Two Door Cinema Club screened the film at the launch party for their 2016 album _Gameshow_. The final track on the album, "Je viens de la", is inspired by _La Jetée_ and describes the journey of the film's protagonist.[13]


Related media

In 1996, Zone Books released a book which reproduced the film's original images along with the script in both English and French.[14]
