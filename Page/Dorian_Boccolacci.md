On 22 August 2018 Roberto Merhi left the FIA Formula 2 Championship, as MP Motorsport promoted the French driver for the next round at Spa-Francorchamps. In the GP3 Series, Richard Verschoor replaced him at the team. Later, Merhi joined the Campos Racing team for the Sochi round, replacing Roy Nissany.

On 22 March 2019 it was announced that Dorian would join Campos Racing for the 2019 season alongside Jack Aitken.[9] Dorian struggled in the opening rounds in Bahrain but performed well on the street circuits of Baku and Monaco with a high of 4th place in the Monaco feature race.[10] After suffering from mechanical failure in the feature race at his home race at Circuit Paul Ricard, Boccolacci recovered to 13th in the sprint race.[11]

On 25th June 2019 Arjun Maini was announced as replacing Boccolacci in Campos Racing,[12] shortly followed by Boccolacci announcing on social media that Paul Ricard was his last race in Formula 2.[13] However, after missing the next round in Austria, Boccolacci secured a drive with Trident Racing for the Silverstone race weekend in July.[14]
