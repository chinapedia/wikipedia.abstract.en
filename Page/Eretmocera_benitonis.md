_ERETMOCERA BENITONIS_ is a moth of the Scythrididae family. It was described by Strand in 1913. It is found in Equatorial Guinea.[1][2]

The length of the forewings is about 5.3 mm. The forewings are black with a blue-green sheen dorsally and irregularly and sparsely scattered with reddish, indistinct scales. The ventral side is purplish, brown-black, towards the base paler. The hindwings are as the ventral side of the forewings dorsally and ventrally, but are sometimes slightly lighter. Adults have been recorded on wing in August.[3]
