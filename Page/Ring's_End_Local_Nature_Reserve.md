RING'S END is an 8.5 hectare Local Nature Reserve which runs south from the hamlet of Ring's End towards March in Cambridgeshire. It is owned and managed by Cambridgeshire County Council.[1][2]

This is a linear site along a disused railway embankment, with views over the Fens. There are also three ponds, reedbeds and areas of scrub.[3] The soil is poor in nutrients, which has allowed uncommon flowering plants such as coltsfoot to become established. Trees include ash and white willow.[4]

The southern end of the site can be accessed from Twenty Foot Road, and National Cycle Route 63 runs through it. There is no access to the northern end.[5]
