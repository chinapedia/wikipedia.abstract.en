The 2017 MIAMI MARLINS SEASON was the 25th season for the Major League Baseball (MLB) Marlins franchise, all in the National League, and the sixth as the "Miami" Marlins. The Marlins played their home games at Marlins Park and hosted the 2017 MLB All-Star Game. The Marlins were managed by Don Mattingly in his second season as manager of the team. They finished the season 77–85 to finish in second place, 20 games behind the Washington Nationals, in the National League East Division. They failed to make the playoffs for the 14th consecutive season.

The season marked the last season under Jeffrey Loria's ownership of the team as Loria agreed to sell the team to a group led by Derek Jeter for $1.2 billion.[1]


Regular season

On June 3, Edinson Vólquez threw his first career no-hitter and the sixth in Marlins history, defeating the Arizona Diamondbacks, 3–0, at Marlins Park. Vólquez threw 98 pitches, struck out 10 and walked two batters (both of whom were both erased on double plays), facing the minimum number of batters.[2] On June 14, outfielder Ichiro Suzuki singled for his 365th interleague hit, passing Derek Jeter to becoming the all-time leader in interleague hits.[3]

On June 25, Ichiro became the oldest player to start a game in center field since at least 1900, breaking the record previously held by Rickey Henderson.[4] Ichiro singled twice on July 6 against the St. Louis Cardinals, bringing his hits total to 3,054 and surpassing Panamanian-born Rod Carew as the all-time leader in MLB hits among foreign-born players.[5]

The Marlins hosted the 2017 MLB All-Star Game at Marlins Park. Right fielder Giancarlo Stanton (fourth time) and left fielder Marcell Ozuna (second) were selected to the National League team. At the time, Stanton led the NL with 26 home runs and batted .277/.360/.572.[6]

The Marlins' 22–10 win over the Texas Rangers on July 26 set a new franchise record for the most runs scored in a single game.[7]

While playing the San Francisco Giants on August 14, Stanton hit his 43rd home run, setting the Marlins franchise record for most home runs in a season, which passed Gary Sheffield's mark of 42 set in 1996. Stanton hit the home run versus Ty Blach and had homered in five consecutive games, setting another franchise record.[8] In a duration of 35 games through August 15, Stanton advanced in a historic run, producing 23 home runs, including in six games in a row. Only Sammy Sosa (1998) and Barry Bonds (2001) had ever hit more in a 35-game span.[9]

On August 26, Ichiro set the Marlins' single-season franchise record for pinch-hits with his 22nd pinch hit.[10] On August 27, Stanton became the first player since Chris Davis in 2013 to hit 50 home runs in one season. Stanton also became the sixth player in history to reach 50 home runs before the end of August.[11] In the August 29 game versus the Washington Nationals, he hit his 18th home run of the month, tying Rudy York for his record of home runs in August set in 1937.[12]

Stanton won the NL Player of the Month Award for August, leading the major leagues with 18 home runs, 37 RBI, 28 runs scored and .899 slugging percentage.[13]

On September 8, Ichiro became the sixth player all-time to hit 2,500 career singles,[14] as well as the eighth right fielder of all-time to record over 4,000 putouts at the position. Stanton hit his 57th home run and drove in four runs on September 23 versus Arizona, giving him 125 on the season, and passing Preston Wilson's franchise record of 121 set in 2000.[15] In spite of Stanton's historic season, ESPN ranked Marlins Park as one of the six most difficult stadiums in which to hit a home run in 2017.[16]
