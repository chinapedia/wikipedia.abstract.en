_VERTICORDIA_ SECT. _JUGATA_ is one of seven sections in the subgenus _Chrysoma_. It includes seven species of plants in the genus _Verticordia_. Plants in this section are mostly bushy shrubs to tall with bright yellow flowers which in some species turn red as they age. They have sepals with fringed lobes, petals which have lobes arranged like the fingers of a hand and bracteoles which are joined together and remain attached to the flower after it opens.[1] When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991, he described the section and gave it the name _Jugata_.[2][3] The name _Jugata_ is from the Latin word _jugis_ meaning "yoked together"[4] referring to the arrangement of the bracteoles in these species.

The type species for this section is _Verticordia chrysantha_ and the other six species are _V. chrysanthella_, _V. galeata_, _V. brevifolia_ _V. coronata_, _V. amphigia_ and _V. laciniata_.[5]
