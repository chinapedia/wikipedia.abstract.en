THE KILIMANJARO DARKJAZZ ENSEMBLE is a Dutch band formed in Utrecht, Netherlands, in 2000. The group is composed of Jason Kohnen, Gideon Kiers, trombonist Hilary Jeffery, cellist Nina Hitz, singer Charlotte Cegarra, guitarist Eelco Bosman, and violinist Sadie Anderson. The group is no longer active. Its live counterpart is Mount Fuji Doomjazz Corporation.


History

Kohnen and Kiers initially formed the group, often abbreviated as TKDE, as a project for scoring silent movies such as Nosferatu and Metropolis. Kohnen and Kiers knew each other from studying at the Utrecht School of Arts. The hitherto electronic project was altered in 2004 when British trombonist Jeffery and Swiss cellist Hitz joined. As a quartet, the group released their debut album. Since then, the group has added Cegarra and Bosman in 2006, and Anderson in 2008. Since 2007, all members of the group reside in the Netherlands. The group formed the Mount Fuji Doomjazz Corporation in 2007 as an improvisational side project. The group released their crowd-funded _From the Stairwell_ in 2011. In 2014, the group unofficially split up. Jason Kohnen confirmed this on his new project's Facebook page.
