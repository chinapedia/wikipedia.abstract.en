_THE MIDNIGHT RIDE OF PAUL REVERE_ is a 1931 painting by the American artist Grant Wood. It depicts the American patriot Paul Revere during his midnight ride on April 18, 1775. The perspective is from a high altitude as Revere rides through a brightly lit Lexington, Massachusetts. It was inspired by the poem "Paul Revere's Ride" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.[1] Wood used a child's hobby horse as model for Revere's horse.[2]

The painting is located at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, but is not on view as of spring, 2017.[3]
