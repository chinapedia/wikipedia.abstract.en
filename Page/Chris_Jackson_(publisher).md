CHRIS JACKSON is publisher and editor-in-chief of the One World imprint of Random House.


Early life

Jackson grew up outside of Harlem, New York, and attended Hunter College High School and Columbia University.[1]


Career

From 2006 to 2016 Jackson was executive editor of Spiegel and Grau[2] before becoming head of One World. _The New York Times_ describes Jackson as a "rare public star in the world of book publishing."[3] Calling Jackson "someone you need to know," _Ebony_ cites his work with Ta-Nehisi Coates, Jay-Z and Beyonc√© as well as Jackson's "background and understanding of how to take Black stories and turn them into something that the entire market should--and could--appreciate."[4] Critic Vinson Cunningham, writing for _The New York Times Magazine_, says, "To the extent that 21st-century literary audiences have been introduced to the realities and absurdities born of the phenomenon of race in America, Jackson has done a disproportionate amount of that introducing."[5]
