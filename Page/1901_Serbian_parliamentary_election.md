PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS were held in Serbia in July, 1901. They followed the introduction of a new, liberal constitution in April, which created a bicameral People’s Representative Body consisting of an elected National Assembly and a largely appointed Senate, 60% of whose members the King could appoint.[1]

The elections were marred by demonstrations in Belgrade, during which the police arrested and killed several demonstrators.[2] Although the People's Radical Party won a majority of seats,[3] they were only offered three ministerial positions by King Alexander,[4] with independent Aleksa Jovanović becoming Prime Minister.

The Assembly met for the first time on 1 October.[5] Rista Popović was elected as Speaker of the National Assembly and Dimitrije Marinković as Speaker of the Senate.[6]
