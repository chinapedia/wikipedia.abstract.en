PETER OF COMPOSTELA () is the name given to the author of _De consolatione rationis_ (_The Consolation of Reason_). This was a prosimetrum based on Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy. He is now thought to have been a grammar teacher in Santiago de Compostela between 1317 and 1330, but was previously conjectured to have been a bishop in the twelfth century.
