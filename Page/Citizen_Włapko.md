Obywatel_Włapko.jpg CITIZEN WŁAPKO (_Citizen Skimmer, Polish: Obywatel Włapko_) - the symbol of corrupt official, hindering a man's life.[1] Sculpture, a satirical figure shows a naked boy with the head of a mature man wearing glasses with a mustache and beard, with hands arranged in such a way as if the finger of the right hand was pointing to it and asking for somebody to give him something into the other hand.

It is 1.10 meters high. There is a bomb next to his left foot, which symbolizes its explosive nature, and the nudity symbolizes the whole, "naked" truth.

The creator of the sculpture is Wiesław Adamski from Szczecinek, Poland. The satirical figure was presented for the first time during the Happening on June 25, 2015 in Szczecinek, and then it visited many cities throughout the country.[2]

One of the city's officials personally rendered justice to the author of the sculpture assaulting the artist in front of his apartment.[3][4]

The Social Monument Building Committee of Citizen Włapko was created in Szczecinek, with the goal of constructing the monument in the city.[5][6]

During the session of the City Council in Szczecinek, the poster with the image of Citizen Włapko caused confusion, when the councillor, Jacek Pawłowicz, with the support of the councillor Andrzej Grobelny, tried to give the poster for the mayor. The poster was not accepted by the mayor, and he took two councillors to court.[7]
