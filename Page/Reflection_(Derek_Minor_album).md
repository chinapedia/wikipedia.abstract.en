_REFLECTION_ is the sixth studio album by American Christian hip hop artist Derek Minor, released on October 14, 2016.[1] It was released through RMG and Entertainment One.


Album concept

Derek Minor explained that the concept of the album addresses identity crisis in the United States, in an interview with Rapzilla, Derek Minor said "I feel like many of the issues that we face are based on identity issues. People, they don’t value themselves, they don’t value others, they don’t value family... Everyone has an identity crisis, and I wanted to contribute to that conversation with the record to say, ‘Nah, you were made for greatness. You weren’t made for no reason. You aren’t an accident. You weren’t just an afterthought by God. He made you, crafted you with an amazing purpose,’ and that’s the whole idea of the album — reflect God, reflect greatness".[2]


Reception

Commercial performance

The album debuted at number 7 on the Billboard Christian Albums chart, number 5 on the Rap Albums chart, and number 15 on the Independent Albums chart.

Critical reception

Kevin Hoskins from Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album a 4 out of 5, saying "this is a very solid album that should be owned by all rap fans. It may not be as great as Dying to Live or Empire, but Reflection is still an excellent album. The focus and thought process is delivered in such a straightforward manner that Minor's point can't be missed."[3]
