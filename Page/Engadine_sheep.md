The ENGADINE or RED ENGADINE is a breed of domestic sheep from Switzerland that originated from Bergamasca and Alpines Steinschaf breeds in the Lower Engadine and bordering valleys in Tyrol and Bavaria.[1] The breed was close to extinction in the 1980s, but today helps to preserve centuries-old grassland in the Alps by feeding on the stems of green alder and thinning the invasive population.[2]
