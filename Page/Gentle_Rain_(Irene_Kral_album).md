_GENTLE RAIN_ is the final album by vocalist Irene Kral performing with pianist Alan Broadbent which was recorded in 1977 and originally released on the Choice label and rereleased by Candid on CD in 2001.[1][2][3]


Reception

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow stated "Throughout her second set of duets with pianist Alan Broadbent, Kral is almost up to the same emotional level as her previous effort, _Where Is Love_ ... Few other singers could interpret a full program of slow ballads and hold one's interest throughout".[4]
