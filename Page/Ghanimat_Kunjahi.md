MUHAMMAD AKRAM GHANIMAT KUNJAHI (b. Kunjah, d. c. 1695 CE) was a Persian poet in The Mughal Empire. He belongs to the Banu Hashim family. One of his ancestors was Ali's son Imam Abu al-Qasim Muhammad bin Hanffiyah (Alvi.Hashmi), but he used the Kunjahi name in the first half of the seventeenth century CE.[1]


Life

Most of Kunjahi's life was spent in and around his native village. He traveled to, and stayed in, Kashmir, Delhi and Lahore. He was an adherent of the Ḳādiriyya, a Sufi order.[2]


Works

Kunjahi wrote in Persian, in the style known as _sabk-i hindī_, the so-called 'Indian style'. This style was characterised by an enthusiasm for the _ghazal_ form; an increased interest in realistic images, often in erotic themes; conceptual complexity of images and themes; and complex syntax.[3] It has been suggested that Kunjahi's 'fondness for lengthy compound expressions echoes the enormous compound epithets of Sanskrit poetry of the Kāvya style, especially as Ghanīmat’s century was one of considerable Muslim-Hindu cultural interaction, in which, for instance, several Sanskrit works were translated into Persian at the Mughal court'.[4]

Kunjahi's _diwan_ is dominated by _ghazals_, including a poem of praise, _Aurangzeb_,[5] along with the _Nayrang-i ʿishḳ_ ('Talisman of Love'), from 1681 CE. This is a sentimental, sensuous romantic poem in _mathnawī_ form , set in the India of Kunjahi's day, characterized by 'mystical and symbolical overtones'.[6]


Reception

The _Nayrang-i ʿishḳ_ was translated into Pashto around 1600 by ʿAbd al-Hamīd Mohmand.[7]

By the mid-twentieth century, Kunjahi had 'come to maintain a dim afterlife in popular local memory only as a miracle worker with some notable but minor specialist powers of the kind attributed to the lesser sort of departed Sufi saint, all over the Muslim world'. His tomb was associated with improving mental faculties, curing insanity and helping aspiring poets.[8]

Kunjahi gave his name to the Bazm-i-Ghanimat, a Pakistani literary organization.[9] By his own request, the Pakistani poet Shareef Kunjahi (1914–2007) was interred in the compound of Kunjahi's _mazar_ in Kunjah.[10]
