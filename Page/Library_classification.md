arranged using the Dewey classification]]

A LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION is a system of knowledge organization by which library resources are arranged and ordered systematically. Library classifications use a notational system that represents the order of topics in the classification and allows items to be stored in that order. Library classification systems group related materials together, typically arranged as a hierarchical tree structure. A different kind of classification system, called a faceted classification system, is also widely used which allows the assignment of multiple classifications to an object, enabling the classifications to be ordered in multiple ways.


Description

Library classification is an aspect of library and information science. It is distinct from scientific classification in that it has as its goal to provide a useful ordering of documents rather than a theoretical organization of knowledge.[1] Although it has the practical purpose of creating a physical ordering of documents, it does generally attempt to adhere to accepted scientific knowledge.[2]

Library classification is distinct from the application of subject headings in that classification organizes knowledge into a systematic order, while subject headings provide access to intellectual materials through vocabulary terms that may or may not be organized as a knowledge system.[3] The characteristics that a bibliographic classification demands for the sake of reaching these purposes are: a useful sequence of subjects at all levels, a concise memorable notation, and a host of techniques and devices of number synthesis[4]


History

Library classifications were preceded by classifications used by bibliographers such as Conrad Gessner. The earliest library classification schemes organized books in broad subject categories. The earliest known library classification scheme is the Pinakes by Callimachus, a scholar at the Library of Alexandria during the third century BC. During the Renaissance and Reformation era, "Libraries were organized according to the whims or knowledge of individuals in charge."[5] This changed the format in which various materials were classified. Some collections were classified by language and others by how they were printed.

After the printing revolution in the sixteenth century, the increase in available printed materials made such broad classification unworkable, and more granular classifications for library materials had to be developed in the nineteenth century.[6]

Although libraries created order within their collections from as early as the fifth century BC,[7] the Paris Bookseller's classification, developed in 1842 by Jacques Charles Brunet, is generally seen as the first of the modern book classifications. Brunet provided five major classes: theology, jurisprudence, sciences and arts, belles-lettres, and history.[8]


Types

There are many standard systems of library classification in use, and many more have been proposed over the years. However, in general, classification systems can be divided into three types depending on how they are used:

Universal schemes: Covers all subjects, e.g. the Dewey Decimal Classification, Universal Decimal Classification and Library of Congress Classification.
Specific classification schemes: Covers particular subjects or types of materials, e.g. Iconclass, British Catalogue of Music Classification, and Dickinson classification, or the NLM Classification.
National schemes: Specially created for certain countries, e.g. the Swedish library classification system, SAB (Sveriges Allmänna Biblioteksförening).

In terms of functionality, classification systems are often described as:

Enumerative: Subject headings are listed alphabetically, with numbers assigned to each heading in alphabetical order.
Hierarchical: Subjects are divided hierarchically, from most general to most specific.
Faceted/analytico-synthetic: Subjects are divided into mutually exclusive orthogonal facets.

There are few completely enumerative systems or faceted systems; most systems are a blend but favouring one type or the other. The most common classification systems, LCC and DDC, are essentially enumerative, though with some hierarchical and faceted elements (more so for DDC), especially at the broadest and most general level. The first true faceted system was the colon classification of S. R. Ranganathan.


Methods or systems

Classification types denote the classification or categorization according to the form or characteristics or qualities of a classification scheme or schemes. Method and system has similar meaning. Method or methods or system means the classification schemes like Dewey Decimal Classification or Universal Decimal Classification. The types of classification is for identifying and understanding or education or research purposes while classification method means those classification schemes like DDC, UDC.

English language universal classification systems

The most common systems in English-speaking countries are:

-   Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC)
-   Library of Congress Classification (LCC)
-   Colon classification (CC)
-   Universal Decimal Classification (UDC)

Other systems include:

-   Harvard-Yenching Classification, an English classification system for Chinese language materials
-   V-LIB 1.3 (2018 Vartavan Library Classification for over 700 fields of knowledge, based on the V-FRAME (http://projectis.co.uk/v-frame) and currently sold under license in the UK by PROJECTIS CONSULTANTS Ltd (http://projectis.co.uk/v-lib)
-   London Education Classification used at the UCL Institute of Education
-   Garside Classification Scheme used in most libraries of University College London[9]
-   Bliss bibliographic classification used in some British libraries

Non-English universal classification systems

-   German Regensburger Verbundklassifikation (RVK)
-   A system of book classification for Chinese libraries (Liu's Classification) library classification for user
    -   New Classification Scheme for Chinese Libraries
-   Nippon Decimal Classification (NDC)
-   Chinese Library Classification (CLC)
-   Korean Decimal Classification (KDC)
-   Russian Library-Bibliographical Classification (BBK)

Universal classification systems that rely on synthesis (faceted systems)

-   Bliss bibliographic classification
-   Colon classification
-   Cutter Expansive Classification
-   Universal Decimal Classification

Newer classification systems tend to use the principle of synthesis (combining codes from different lists to represent the different attributes of a work) heavily, which is comparatively lacking in LC or DDC.


The practice of classifying

Library classification is associated with library (descriptive) cataloging under the rubric of _cataloging and classification_, sometimes grouped together as _technical services_. The library professional who engages in the process of cataloging and classifying library materials is called a _cataloger_ or _catalog librarian_. Library classification systems are one of the two tools used to facilitate subject access. The other consists of alphabetical indexing languages such as Thesauri and Subject Headings systems.

Library classification of a piece of work consists of two steps. Firstly, the "aboutness" of the material is ascertained. Next, a call number (essentially a book's address) based on the classification system in use at the particular library will be assigned to the work using the notation of the system.

It is important to note that unlike subject heading or thesauri where multiple terms can be assigned to the same work, in library classification systems, each work can only be placed in one class. This is due to shelving purposes: A book can have only one physical place. However, in classified catalogs one may have main entries as well as added entries. Most classification systems like the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and Library of Congress Classification also add a cutter number to each work which adds a code for the author of the work.

Classification systems in libraries generally play two roles. Firstly, they facilitate subject access by allowing the user to find out what works or documents the library has on a certain subject.[10] Secondly, they provide a known location for the information source to be located (e.g. where it is shelved).

Until the 19th century, most libraries had closed stacks, so the library classification only served to organize the subject catalog. In the 20th century, libraries opened their stacks to the public and started to shelve library material itself according to some library classification to simplify subject browsing.

Some classification systems are more suitable for aiding subject access, rather than for shelf location. For example, Universal Decimal Classification, which uses a complicated notation of pluses and colons, is more difficult to use for the purpose of shelf arrangement but is more expressive compared to DDC in terms of showing relationships between subjects. Similarly faceted classification schemes are more difficult to use for shelf arrangement, unless the user has knowledge of the citation order.

Depending on the size of the library collection, some libraries might use classification systems solely for one purpose or the other. In extreme cases, a public library with a small collection might just use a classification system for location of resources but might not use a complicated subject classification system. Instead all resources might just be put into a couple of wide classes (travel, crime, magazines etc.). This is known as a "mark and park" classification method, more formally called reader interest classification.[11]


Comparing classification systems

As a result of differences in notation, history, use of enumeration, hierarchy, and facets, classification systems can differ in the following ways:

-   Type of Notation: Notation can be pure (consisting of only numerals, for example) or mixed (consisting of letters and numerals, or letters, numerals, and other symbols).
-   Expressiveness: This is the degree to which the notation can express relationship between concepts or structure.
-   Whether they support mnemonics: For example, the number 44 in DDC notation often means it concerns some aspect of France. For example, in the Dewey classification 598.0944 concerns "Birds in France", the 09 signifies geographical division, and 44 represents France.
-   Hospitality: The degree to which the system is able to accommodate new subjects.
-   Brevity: The length of the notation to express the same concept.
-   Speed of updates and degree of support: The better classification systems are frequently being reviewed.
-   Consistency
-   Simplicity
-   Usability
