His debut for Motagua occurred on 24 August 1997, where he saved two penalty kicks in the 1–0 victory over C.D.S. Vida.[4] According to Diego, his most memorable event as a player took place in the final series of the 1999–2000 Honduran Liga Nacional season against Club Deportivo Olimpia where after a 0–0 global score, the title had to be decided by penalty shoot-outs in which Vásquez saved the decisive kick to give Motagua its 8th national championship.[5]
