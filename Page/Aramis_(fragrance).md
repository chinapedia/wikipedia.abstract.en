ARAMIS is fragrance introduced by Estée Lauder in 1964.[1] It was the first prestige men’s fragrance widely available in department stores, and is now sold in 120 countries.[2] Aramis was created by perfumer Bernard Chant.[3]

It is classified as a leather chypre; its top notes are fresh/bitter herb combined with a body odor note from cumin, followed by gardenia, jasmine, amber and sandalwood.[4]

Perfumer and fragrance historian Roja Dove has called it "an incredibly refined and distinctive fragrance”[5] that is "as much of a legend as the hero it was named after."[6]
