LEE MARVIN (February 19, 1924 – August 29, 1987) was an American film and television actor.[1]

Known for his distinctive voice and premature white hair, Marvin initially appeared in supporting roles, mostly villains, soldiers, and other hardboiled characters. A prominent television role was that of Detective Lieutenant Frank Ballinger in the NBC crime series _M Squad_ (1957–1960).

One of Marvin's most notable film projects was _Cat Ballou_ (1965), a comedy Western in which he played dual roles. For portraying both gunfighter Kid Shelleen and criminal Tim Strawn, he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, along with a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, an NBR Award, and the Silver Bear for Best Actor.


Early life

Marvin was born in New York City. He was the son of Lamont Waltman Marvin, an advertising executive and later the head of the New York and New England Apple Institute, and Courtenay Washington (née Davidge), a fashion and beauty writer/editor.[2]

As with his elder brother, Robert, he was named in honor of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, who was his first cousin, four times removed. His father was a direct descendant of Matthew Marvin Sr., who emigrated from Great Bentley, Essex, England, in 1635, and helped found Hartford, Connecticut.[3]

Marvin studied violin when he was young.[4] As a teenager, Marvin "spent weekends and spare time hunting deer, puma, wild turkey, and bobwhite in the wilds of the then-uncharted Everglades".[5]

He attended Manumit School, a Christian socialist boarding school in Pawling, New York, during the late 1930s, and later attended St. Leo College Preparatory School, a Catholic school in St. Leo, Florida, after being expelled from several other schools for bad behavior.[6]


Military service

World War II

Marvin left school at 18 to enlist in the United States Marine Corps Reserve on August 12, 1942. He served with the 4th Marine Division in the Pacific Theater during World War II.[7] While serving as a member of "I" Company, 3rd Battalion, 24th Marines, 4th Marine Division, he was wounded in action on June 18, 1944, during the assault on Mount Tapochau in the Battle of Saipan, during which most of his company were casualties.[8] He was hit by machine gun fire, which severed his sciatic nerve,[9] and then was hit again in the foot by a sniper.[10] After over a year of medical treatment in naval hospitals, Marvin was given a medical discharge with the rank of private first class (he had been a corporal years earlier but had been demoted after causing trouble)[11] in 1945 Philadelphia.[12]

Marvin's military awards include: the Purple Heart Medal, the Presidential Unit Citation, the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal, Combat Action Ribbon.

Early acting career

After the war, while working as a plumber's assistant at a local community theatre in upstate New York, Marvin was asked to replace an actor who had fallen ill during rehearsals. He caught the acting bug and got a job with the company at $7 a week. He moved to Greenwich Village and used the GI Bill to study at the American Theatre Wing.[13][14]

He appeared on stage in a production of _Uniform of Flesh_, an adaptation of _Billy Budd_ (1949).[15] It was done at the Experimental Theatre, where a few months later Marvin also appeared in _The Nineteenth Hole of Europe_ (1949).[16]

Marvin began appearing on television shows like _Escape_, _The Big Story_, and _Treasury Men in Action_.

He made it to Broadway with a small role in a production of _Uniform of Flesh_, now called _Billy Budd_ in February 1951.[17]

Hollywood

Marvin's film debut was in _You're in the Navy Now_ (1951), directed by Henry Hathaway, a film which also marked the debuts of Charles Bronson and Jack Warden. This required some filming in Hollywood. Marvin decided to stay there.[18]

He had a similar small part in _Teresa_ (1951) directed by Fred Zinnemann. As a decorated combat veteran, Marvin was a natural in war dramas, where he frequently assisted the director and other actors in realistically portraying infantry movement, arranging costumes, and the use of firearms.

He guest starred on episodes of _Fireside Theatre_, _Suspense_ and _Rebound_. Hathaway used him again on _Diplomatic Courier_ (1952) and he could be seen in _Down Among the Sheltering Palms_ (1952), directed by Edmund Goulding, _We're Not Married!_ (1952), also for Goulding, _The Duel at Silver Creek_ (1952) directed by Don Siegel, and _Hangman's Knot_ (1952), directed by Roy Huggins.

He guest starred on _Biff Baker, U.S.A._ and _Dragnet_, and had a decent role in a feature with _Eight Iron Men_ (1952), a war film produced by Stanley Kramer (Marvin's role had been played on Broadway by Burt Lancaster).[19]

He was a sergeant in _Seminole_ (1953), a Western directed by Budd Boetticher, and was a corporal in _The Glory Brigade_ (1953), a Korean War film.

Marvin guest starred in _The Doctor_, _The Revlon Mirror Theater_, _Suspense_ again and _The Motorola Television Hour_.

He was now in much demand for Westerns: _The Stranger Wore a Gun_ (1953) with Randolph Scott, and _Gun Fury_ (1953) with Rock Hudson.

_The Big Heat_ and _The Wild One_

Marvin received much acclaim for his portrayal as villains in two films: _The Big Heat_ (1953) where he played Gloria Grahame's vicious boyfriend, directed by Fritz Lang; and _The Wild One_ (1953) opposite Marlon Brando (Marvin's gang in the film was called "The Beetles"), produced by Kramer.[20]

He continued in TV shows such as _The Plymouth Playhouse_ and _The Pepsi-Cola Playhouse_. He had support roles in _Gorilla at Large_ (1954) and had a notable small role as smart-aleck sailor Meatball in _The Caine Mutiny_ (1954), produced by Kramer.[21]

Marvin was in _The Raid_ (1954), _Center Stage_, _Medic_ and _TV Reader's Digest_.[22]

He had an excellent part as Hector, the small-town hood in _Bad Day at Black Rock_ (1955) with Spencer Tracy.[23] Also in 1955, he played a conflicted, brutal bank-robber in _Violent Saturday_. A latter-day critic wrote of the character, "Marvin brings a multi-faceted complexity to the role and gives a great example of the early promise that launched his long and successful career."[24]

Marvin played Robert Mitchum's friend in _Not as a Stranger_ (1955), a medical drama produced by Kramer. He had good support roles in _A Life in the Balance_ (1955) (he was third billed), and _Pete Kelly's Blues_ (1955) and appeared on TV in _Jane Wyman Presents The Fireside Theatre_ and _Studio One in Hollywood._

Marvin was in _I Died a Thousand Times_ (1955) with Jack Palance, _Shack Out on 101_ (1955), _Kraft Theatre_, and _Front Row Center._

Aldrich_Attack_movie_trailer_screenshot2.jpg'']] Marvin was the villain in _7 Men from Now_ (1956) with Randolph Scott directed by Boetticher. He was second billed to Palance in _Attack_ (1956) directed by Robert Aldrich.

Marvin had good roles in _Pillars of the Sky_ (1956) with Jeff Chandler, _The Rack_ (1956) with Paul Newman, _Raintree County_ (1956) and _The Missouri Traveler_ (1958). He also guest starred on _Climax!_ (several times), _Studio 57_, _The United States Steel Hour_ and _Schlitz Playhouse_.

_M Squad_

Lee_Marvin_1959.JPG'']] Marvin finally got to be a leading man in 100 episodes as Chicago cop Frank Ballinger in the successful 1957–1960 television series _M Squad_. One critic described the show as "a hyped-up, violent _Dragnet_ ... with a hard-as-nails Marvin" playing a tough police lieutenant. Marvin received the role after guest-starring in a memorable _Dragnet_ episode as a serial killer.[25]

When the series ended Marvin appeared on _Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse_, _Sunday Showcase_, _The Barbara Stanwyck Show_, _The Americans_, _Wagon Train_, _Checkmate_, _General Electric Theater, Alcoa Premiere_, _The Investigators_, _Route 66_ (he was injured during a fight scene[26]), Ben Casey, _Bonanza_, _The Untouchables_ (several times), _The Virginian_, _The Twilight Zone_ ("The Grave", "Steel") and _The Dick Powell Theatre_.[27]

Early 1960s

Marvin returned to features with a prominent role in _The Comancheros_ (1961) starring John Wayne. He played in two more films with Wayne, both directed by John Ford: _The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance_ (1962), and _Donovan's Reef_ (1963). As the vicious Liberty Valance, Marvin played his first title role and held his own with two of the screen's biggest stars (Wayne and James Stewart).[28]

He continued to guest star on shows like _Combat!_, _Dr. Kildare_ and _The Great Adventure_. He did _The Case Against Paul Ryker_ for _Kraft Suspense Theatre._

For director Don Siegel, Marvin appeared in _The Killers_ (1964) playing an efficient professional assassin alongside Clu Gulager. _The Killers_ was also the first film in which Marvin received top billing.[29]

He guest starred on _Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre_.

_Cat Ballou_ and stardom

Marvin finally became a star for his comic role in the offbeat Western _Cat Ballou_ starring Jane Fonda. This was a surprise hit and Marvin won the 1965 Academy Award for Best Actor. He also won the 1965 Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 15th Berlin International Film Festival.[30]

Playing alongside Vivien Leigh and Simone Signoret, Marvin won the 1966 National Board of Review Award for male actors for his role in _Ship of Fools_ (1965) directed by Kramer.[31]

Marvin next performed in the hit Western _The Professionals_ (1966), in which he played the leader of a small band of skilled mercenaries (Burt Lancaster, Robert Ryan, and Woody Strode) rescuing a kidnap victim (Claudia Cardinale) shortly after the Mexican Revolution.

He followed that film with the hugely successful World War II epic _The Dirty Dozen_ (1967) in which top-billed Marvin again portrayed an intrepid commander of a colorful group (future stars John Cassavetes, Charles Bronson, Telly Savalas, Jim Brown, and Donald Sutherland) performing an almost impossible mission. Robert Aldrich directed.

In the wake of these two films and after having received an Oscar, Marvin was a huge star, given enormous control over his next film _Point Blank_. In _Point Blank_, an influential film for director John Boorman, he portrayed a hard-nosed criminal bent on revenge. Marvin, who had selected Boorman himself for the director's slot, had a central role in the film's development, plot line, and staging.[32]

In 1968, Marvin also appeared in another Boorman film, the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful World War II character study _Hell in the Pacific_, also starring famed Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. John Boorman recounted his work with Lee Marvin on these two films and Marvin's influence on his career in the 1998 documentary _Lee Marvin: A Personal Portrait by John Boorman_. _Paul Ryker_, which Marvin shot for TV in 1963 was released theatrically as _Sergeant Ryker_.[33]

Marvin was originally cast as Pike Bishop (later played by William Holden) in _The Wild Bunch_ (1969), but fell out with director Sam Peckinpah and pulled out to star in the Western musical _Paint Your Wagon_ (1969), in which he was top-billed over a singing Clint Eastwood. Despite his limited singing ability, he had a hit song with "Wand'rin' Star". By this time, he was getting paid a million dollars per film, $200,000 less than top star Paul Newman was making at the time, yet he was ambivalent about the film business, even with its financial rewards:[34]

  You spend the first forty years of your life trying to get in this business, and the next forty years trying to get out. And then when you're making the bread, who needs it?

1970s

Marvin had a much greater variety of roles in the 1970s, with fewer 'bad-guy' roles than in earlier years. His 1970s films included _Monte Walsh_ (1970), a Western with Palance and Jeanne Moreau; the violent _Prime Cut_ (1972) with Gene Hackman; _Pocket Money_ (1972) with Paul Newman, for Stuart Rosenberg; _Emperor of the North_ (1973) opposite Ernest Borgnine for Aldrich; as Hickey in _The Iceman Cometh_ (1973) with Fredric March and Robert Ryan, for John Frankenheimer; _The Spikes Gang_ (1974) with Noah Beery Jr. for Richard Fleischer; _The Klansman_ (1974) with Richard Burton; _Shout at the Devil_ (1976), a World War One adventure with Roger Moore, directed by Peter Hunt; _The Great Scout and Cathouse Thursday_ (1976), a comic Western with Oliver Reed; and _Avalanche Express_ (1978), a Cold War thriller with Robert Shaw who died during production. None of these films were big box office hits.[35][36]

Marvin was offered the role of Quint in _Jaws_ (1975) but declined, stating "What would I tell my fishing friends who'd see me come off a hero against a dummy shark?".[37]

1980s

Marvin's last big role was in Samuel Fuller's _The Big Red One_ (1980), a war film based on Fuller's own war experiences.

His remaining films were _Death Hunt_ (1981), a Canadian action film with Charles Bronson, directed by Hunt; _Gorky Park_ (1983) with William Hurt; and _Dog Day_ (1984), shot in France.[38]

For TV he did _The Dirty Dozen: Next Mission_ (1985; a sequel with Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, and Richard Jaeckel picking up where they had left off despite being 18 years older).

His final appearance was in _The Delta Force_ (1986) with Chuck Norris, playing a role turned down by Charles Bronson.[39][40]


Personal life

Marvin was a Democrat who opposed the Vietnam War. He publicly endorsed John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election.[41]

Marriages, children and partners

Marvin married Betty Ebeling in February 1951 and together they had four children, son Christopher Lamont (1952–2013),[42] and three daughters: Courtenay Lee (b. 1954), Cynthia Louise (b. 1956), and Claudia Leslie (1958–2012).[43][44] Married 16 years, they divorced in 1967.

Marvin reunited with his high school sweetheart, Pamela Feeley, following his divorce. They married in October 1970. She had four children with three previous marriages, they had no children together and remained married until his death in 1987.[45]

Community property case

    _See also Marvin v. Marvin_

In 1971, Marvin was sued by Michelle Triola, his live-in girlfriend from 1965 to 1970, who legally changed her surname to "Marvin".[46] Although the couple never married, she sought financial compensation similar to that available to spouses under California's alimony and community property laws. Triola claimed Marvin made her pregnant three times and paid for two abortions, while one pregnancy ended in miscarriage.[47] She claimed the second abortion left her unable to bear children.[48] The result was the landmark "palimony" case, _Marvin v. Marvin_, 18 Cal. 3d 660 (1976).[49]

In 1979, Marvin was ordered to pay $104,000 to Triola for "rehabilitation purposes", but the court denied her community property claim for one-half of the $3.6 million which Marvin had earned during their six years of cohabitation – distinguishing nonmarital relationship contracts from marriage, with community property rights only attaching to the latter by operation of law. Rights equivalent to community property only apply in nonmarital relationship contracts when the parties expressly, whether orally or in writing, contract for such rights to operate between them. In August 1981, the California Court of Appeal found that no such contract existed between them and nullified the award she had received.[50][51] Michelle Triola died of lung cancer on October 30, 2009, having been with actor Dick Van Dyke since 1976.[52]

Later there was controversy after Marvin characterized the trial as a "circus", saying "everyone was lying, even I lied". There were official comments about possibly charging Marvin with perjury, but no charges were filed.[53]

This case was used as fodder for a mock debate skit on _Saturday Night Live_ called "Point Counterpoint",[54] and on _The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson_ as a skit with Carson as Adam, and Betty White as Eve.[55]


Death

Pfc_Lee_Marvin_cemetery_headstone.jpg In December 1986, Marvin was hospitalized for more than two weeks because of a condition related to coccidioidomycosis. He went into respiratory distress and was administered steroids to help his breathing. He had major intestinal ruptures as a result, and underwent a colectomy. Marvin died of a heart attack on August 29, 1987, aged 63.[56] His body was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.[57][58]
