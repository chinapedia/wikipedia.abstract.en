The phrase alludes to the historical draining of swamps to keep mosquito populations low to combat malaria.[1] It has been used as a metaphor by:

-   Winfield R. Gaylord (1870–1943) to describe the socialist desire to "drain" the "capitalist swamp".[2]
-   Victor L. Berger (1860–1929), who in his book _Broadsides_ referred to changing the capitalist system as "drain[ing] the swamp".[3]
-   Ronald Reagan, who called to "drain the swamp" of bureaucracy in the federal government in 1983.[4][5]
-   Jessica Stern in "Preparing for a War on Terrorism", where she calls on the U.S. to see failing and failed states as sources and sanctuaries for terrorists and terrorism (the swamp) and to use foreign aid and soft power to combat them (the draining).[6]
-   Pat Buchanan during his 2000 presidential campaign, when he invoked the saying in opposition to the dominant political parties: "Neither Beltway party is going to drain this swamp: it's a protected wetland; they breed in it, they spawn in it".[7]
-   Nancy Pelosi in 2006 while announcing her 100-Hour Plan in response to more than a decade of Republican rule.[8][9]
-   Donald Trump to describe his plan to fix problems in the federal government.[10][11] Subsequent protests against the role of Goldman Sachs alumni in his administration also used the metaphor.[12]
-   Traditional Unionist Voice on the front cover of their manifesto for the 2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election[13]
-   Henry Bolton, the leader of UKIP when referring to the NEC on 22 January 2018.[14]
