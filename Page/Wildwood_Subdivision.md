The WILDWOOD SUBDIVISION is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in Florida. It runs along CSX’s S Line from Baldwin south to Zephyrhills via Ocala and Wildwood for a total of 155.7 miles.

The north end of the line is at Baldwin Junction, where it connects with the Jacksonville Terminal Subdivision to the east, the Callahan Subdivision to the north, and the Florida Gulf & Atlantic Railroad to the west. At its south end, it connects to the Yeoman Subdivision, which continues to Tampa. It also connects with the Vitis Subdivision just south of Dade City[1][2]


Operation

Wildwood_US301_RR_tracks_north01.jpg The Wildwood Subdivision and the Yeoman Subdivision (which both run along CSX’s S Line) together are CSX’s main freight route through Peninsular Florida. The line is double tracked in many places to accommodate the large amount of freight traffic and is dispatched through a Centralized traffic control signal system.[3]

Some of the double track was installed in the mid 2010s to further increase capacity since through trains no longer use the adjacent A Line, which is now partially state owned.[4][5]

The Wildwood Subdivision is used exclusively for freight. Passenger service previously operated over the line which diminished in the late 1980s when CSX abandoned parts of Seaboard's branch at Wildwood to West Palm Beach and Miami (the Florida Western and Northern Railroad). Amtrak's Silver Star to Miami used this route up until then, which was subsequently shifted to the A Line through Orlando.[6] Passenger service was discontinued completely in 2004 when Amtrak truncated the Palmetto to Savannah, Georgia.[7]

Wildwood Yard

A notable location on the Wildwood Subdivision is Wildwood Yard. Today, Wildwood yard serves as a small CSX maintenance and switching yard. It was historically a busy classification yard in the days of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad. From the 1920s to the 1980s, the yard was significant since the Seaboard's division points to Tampa, Orlando, and Miami were located just to the south.[8] Trains to Orlando previously turned towards Leesburg and Tavares just south of the yard (the wye at the south end of the yard is all that remains of that connection).[9] Trains to Miami turned in Coleman down Seaboard's Florida Western and Northern Railroad.

Wildwood station still stands and is co-located in the yard, though passenger service has long been discontinued. In 2013, new double-tracked main lines were built to bypass the yard. The station's platforms were removed to accommodate this expansion.[10]


History

Owensboro_Historic_Plaque.jpg The Wildwood Subdivision from Baldwin to Lacoochee (at a point previously known as Owensboro Junction) was originally built incrementally from 1861 to 1890 by railroads that would make up the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad.[11] The line would later become the main line of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, who acquired the FC&P, in 1903.

From Owensboro south to what is now Vitis Junction was originally a branch of the South Florida Railroad, and from Vitis Junction to Zephyrhills, it was originally part of the Tampa and Thonotosassa Railroad. Both of those lines would become part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad.

The Seaboard line originally had its own alignment from Owensboro to Zephyrhills via Dade City, but that segment was abandoned shortly after the Seaboard Air Line merged with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1967. The abandonment was part of an effort to consolidate the merged network, which would become CSX Transportation by 1986. The Atlantic Coast Line route was kept in favor of the Seaboard route since is it went around the downtowns of Dade City and Zephyrhills. Despite its Atlantic Coast Line heritage, it is unofficially considered part of the S Line since it carries all S Line traffic (though, this segment still retains its ACL milepost numbering with AR and ARF prefixes).[12][13]
