Biography

Hamilton was born in Toronto and had lived in Europe and Canada before her parents decided to settle in France.[2] She grew up in Beaune a small town in France before moving to England to study History of Art at King's College in Cambridge University.[3] She later moved back to France for work after graduation. She currently lives in London.


Work

_Rebel of the Sands_ is Hamilton's debut novel and she wrote two more books to make it a trilogy.[4] The book is written for young adults and is part of the fantasy genre.[5] In _Rebel_, Amani leaves her hometown, Dustwalk,and travels through a magical countryside to reach the fictional nation of Miraji,[6] in order to avoid an arranged marriage to her uncle.[7] _Publishers Weekly_ wrote that "Hamilton successfully mingles romance with thrilling stakes, and hints at a welcome sequel."[8] _Rebel_ made YALSA's nominations for the Teen's Top 10 list in 2017.[9]

_Traitor to the Throne_, the sequel to _Rebel of the Sands_, continues to follow the story of Amani, who happens to be half-Djinn and have elemental powers.[10] The _Deseret News_ wrote that _Rebel_ "was good, but this second book is far and away better."[11]

_The Globe and Mail_ describes the series as _Lonesome Dove_ meets _Aladdin_.[12] Hamilton says that _One Thousand and One Nights_ was a big influence on her work.[13]

Film rights to _Rebel_ were bought by Willow Smith in 2017.[14] Smith will lead the film's project and says of _Rebel_, "The nonphysical, creative and, wild nature of a female heroine's journey calls for a unique narrative structure that permeates the very foundation of the story."[15]
