AUSTIN DURANT MOZÉE CARR (born December 25, 1993) is an American football wide receiver for the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Northwestern.


College career

A former walk-on at Northwestern University,[1] Carr earned a scholarship and became a starter in his junior year.[2] In his senior year in 2016, Carr led the Big Ten Conference in receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns.[3] Following the 2016 season, Carr was named the Richter–Howard Receiver of the Year and was named First Team All-Big Ten by the coaches and media.[4]


Professional career

New England Patriots

On April 30, 2017, the New England Patriots signed Carr as an undrafted free agent to a three-year, $1.67 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $7,000.[5][6][7]

Carr shined in the preseason, recording 14 catches for 153 yards and two touchdowns in the four games. Despite a strong training camp and preseason, Carr was waived by the Patriots on September 2, 2017.[8]

New Orleans Saints

On September 3, 2017, Carr was claimed off waivers by the New Orleans Saints.[9] He was active for two games during his rookie season but did not catch any passes.


Personal life

In November 2015, after registering with Be The Match two and a half years earlier, Carr was contacted that he may be a potential match to donate peripheral blood stem cells. Through a five hour procedure, he was able to donate his stem cells via a blood transfusion, which ultimately saved the life of the recipient, a retired locomotive engineer for the Union-Pacific railroad who had non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.[10]
