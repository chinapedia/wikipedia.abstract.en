EXERCISE CROIX DU SUD is a military exercise held every two years in New Caledonia, its surrounding waters and airspace. Many countries in the Pacific region take part in these exercises, which usually focus on delivering humanitarian aid, evacuating civilians, and reestablishing security in the wake of a simulated disaster.


Overview

_Croix du Sud_ is the French term for Southern Cross.[1] It is the largest humanitarian assistance and disaster relief training exercise in the South Pacific.[2] France hosts and organises the exercises through its New Caledonian Armed Forces, headquartered in Noumea.[3]

In alternate years, the concept for the next Croix du Sud is developed through a desktop exercise called Equateur.[4][5] A typical scenario would be a category-four cyclone disaster, resulting in poor sanitation, hunger, disease, and an outbreak of looting and rape which targets foreigners.[6][7] Other scenarios have included extremists disrupting government control and inciting riots.[8]

The Australian Department of Defence says Croix du Sud aims to maintain interoperability among regional defence and police forces. The exercise is also an opportunity to practise maritime surveillance, along with stability and security operations.[9][10]

The exercise takes place in accordance with a 1992 agreement between France, Australia and New Zealand.[11] In recent years, Australia has increased its military ties with France, buying submarines and acknowledging in white papers that France has interests in the region.[12][13]
