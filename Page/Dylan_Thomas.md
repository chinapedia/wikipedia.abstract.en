DYLAN MARLAIS THOMAS (27 October 1914 – 9 November 1953) was a Welsh poet and writer whose works include the poems "Do not go gentle into that good night" and "And death shall have no dominion"; the 'play for voices' _Under Milk Wood_; and stories and radio broadcasts such as _A Child's Christmas in Wales_ and _Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog_. He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his premature death at the age of 39 in New York City. By then he had acquired a reputation, which he had encouraged, as a "roistering, drunken and doomed poet".[1]

Thomas was born in Swansea, Wales, in 1914. An undistinguished pupil, he left school at 16 and became a journalist for a short time. Many of his works appeared in print while he was still a teenager, and the publication in 1934 of "Light breaks where no sun shines" caught the attention of the literary world. While living in London, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara, whom he married in 1937. In 1938, they moved to the Welsh fishing village of Laugharne where from 1949 they settled permanently and brought up their three children.

Thomas came to be appreciated as a popular poet during his lifetime, though he found earning a living as a writer difficult. He began augmenting his income with reading tours and radio broadcasts. His radio recordings for the BBC during the late 1940s brought him to the public's attention, and he was frequently used by the BBC as an accessible voice of the literary scene.

Thomas first travelled to the United States in the 1950s. His readings there brought him a degree of fame, while his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened. His time in America cemented his legend, however, and he went on to record to vinyl such works as _A Child's Christmas in Wales_. During his fourth trip to New York in 1953, Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma, from which he never recovered. He died on 9 November 1953. His body was returned to Wales, where he was interred at the churchyard of St Martin's in Laugharne on 25 November 1953.

Although Thomas wrote exclusively in the English language, he has been acknowledged as one of the most important Welsh poets of the 20th century. He is noted for his original, rhythmic and ingenious use of words and imagery. His position as one of the great modern poets has been much discussed, and he remains popular with the public.


Life and career

Early life

, birthplace of Dylan Thomas|alt=On a hill street stands a two storied semi-detached house with bay windows to the front and a sloped tiled roof with a chimney.]]

Dylan Thomas was born on 27 October 1914 in Swansea, the son of Florence Hannah (_née_ Williams; 1882–1958), a seamstress, and David John Thomas (1876–1952), a teacher. His father had a first-class honours degree in English from University College, Aberystwyth and ambitions to rise above his position teaching English literature at the local grammar school.[2] Thomas had one sibling, Nancy Marles (1906–1953), who was eight years his senior.[3] The children spoke only English, though their parents were bilingual in English and Welsh, and David Thomas gave Welsh lessons at home. Thomas's father chose the name Dylan, which could be translated as "son of the sea", after Dylan ail Don, a character in _The Mabinogion_.[4] His middle name, Marlais, was given in honour of his great-uncle, William Thomas, a Unitarian minister and poet whose bardic name was Gwilym Marles.[5][6] Dylan, pronounced ˈ [ˈdəlan] (Dull-an) in Welsh, caused his mother to worry that he might be teased as the "dull one".[7] When he broadcast on Welsh BBC, early in his career, he was introduced using this pronunciation. Thomas favoured the Anglicised pronunciation and gave instructions that it should be Dillan .[8][9]

The red-brick semi-detached house at 5 Cwmdonkin Drive (in the respectable area of the Uplands), in which Thomas was born and lived until he was 23, had been bought by his parents a few months before his birth.[10] His childhood featured regular summer trips to Llansteffan where his maternal relatives were the sixth generation to farm there.[11] His mother's family, the Williamses, lived in such farms as Waunfwlchan, Llwyngwyn, Maesgwyn and Penycoed.[12] The memory of Fernhill, a dairy farm owned by his maternal aunt, Ann Jones,[13] is evoked in the 1945 lyrical poem "Fern Hill".[14] Thomas had bronchitis and asthma in childhood and struggled with these throughout his life. Thomas was indulged by his mother and enjoyed being mollycoddled, a trait he carried into adulthood, and he was skilful in gaining attention and sympathy.[15] Thomas' formal education began at Mrs Hole's dame school, a private school on Mirador Crescent, a few streets away from his home.[16] He described his experience there in _Quite Early One Morning_:

  Never was there such a dame school as ours, so firm and kind and smelling of galoshes, with the sweet and fumbled music of the piano lessons drifting down from upstairs to the lonely schoolroom, where only the sometimes tearful wicked sat over undone sums, or to repent a little crime – the pulling of a girl's hair during geography, the sly shin kick under the table during English literature.[17]

Of the 90 poems he published, half were written during these years.[26]

In his free time, he joined the amateur dramatic group at the Little Theatre in Mumbles, visited the cinema in Uplands, took walks along Swansea Bay, and frequented Swansea's pubs, especially the Antelope and the Mermaid Hotels in Mumbles.[27][28] In the Kardomah Café, close to the newspaper office in Castle Street, he met his creative contemporaries, including his friend the poet Vernon Watkins. The group of writers, musicians and artists became known as "The Kardomah Gang".[29] In 1933, Thomas visited London for probably the first time.

1933–1939

Thomas was a teenager when many of the poems for which he became famous were published: "And death shall have no dominion", "Before I Knocked" and "The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower". "And death shall have no dominion" appeared in the _New English Weekly_ in May 1933.[30] When "Light breaks where no sun shines" appeared in _The Listener_ in 1934, it caught the attention of three senior figures in literary London, T. S. Eliot, Geoffrey Grigson and Stephen Spender.[31][32][33] They contacted Thomas and his first poetry volume, _18 Poems_, was published in December 1934. _18 Poems_ was noted for its visionary qualities which led to critic Desmond Hawkins writing that the work was "the sort of bomb that bursts no more than once in three years".[34][35] The volume was critically acclaimed and won a contest run by the _Sunday Referee_, netting him new admirers from the London poetry world, including Edith Sitwell and Edwin Muir.[36] The anthology was published by Fortune Press, in part a vanity publisher that did not pay its writers and expected them to buy a certain number of copies themselves. A similar arrangement was used by other new authors including Philip Larkin.[37] In September 1935, Thomas met Vernon Watkins, thus beginning a lifelong friendship.[38] Thomas introduced Watkins, working at Lloyds Bank at the time, to his friends, now known as The Kardomah Gang. In those days, Thomas used to frequent the cinema on Mondays with Tom Warner who, like Watkins, had recently suffered a nervous breakdown. After these trips, Warner would bring Thomas back for supper with his aunt. On one occasion, when she served him a boiled egg, she had to cut its top off for him, as Thomas did not know how to do this. This was because his mother had done it for him all his life, an example of her coddling him.[39] Years later, his wife Caitlin would still have to prepare his eggs for him.[40][41] In December 1935 Thomas contributed the poem "The Hand That Signed the Paper" to Issue 18 of the bi-monthly _New Verse_.[42] In 1936, his next collection _Twenty-five Poems_, published by J. M. Dent, also received much critical praise.[43] In all, he wrote half his poems while living at Cwmdonkin Drive before moving to London. It was the time that Thomas's reputation for heavy drinking developed.[44][45]

In early 1936, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara (1913–94), a 22-year-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed dancer of Irish and French descent. She had run away from home, intent on making a career in dance, and aged 18 joined the chorus line at the London Palladium.[46][47][48] Introduced by Augustus John, Caitlin's lover, they met in The Wheatsheaf pub on Rathbone Place in London's West End.[49][50][51] Laying his head in her lap, a drunken Thomas proposed.[52][53] Thomas liked to comment that he and Caitlin were in bed together ten minutes after they first met.[54] Although Caitlin initially continued her relationship with John, she and Thomas began a correspondence, and in the second half of 1936 were courting.[55] They married at the register office in Penzance, Cornwall, on 11 July 1937.[56] In early 1938 they moved to Wales, renting a cottage in the village of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire.[57] Their first child, Llewelyn Edouard, was born on 30 January 1939.[58]

By the late 1930s, Thomas was embraced as the "poetic herald" for a group of English poets, the New Apocalyptics.[59] Thomas refused to align himself with them and declined to sign their manifesto. He later stated that he believed they were "intellectual muckpots leaning on a theory".[60] Despite this, many of the group, including Henry Treece, modelled their work on Thomas.[61]

During the politically charged atmosphere of the 1930s, Thomas's sympathies were very much with the radical left, to the point of holding close links with the communists, as well as decidedly pacifist and anti-fascist.[62] He was a supporter of the left-wing No More War Movement and boasted about participating in demonstrations against the British Union of Fascists.[63]

Wartime, 1939–1945

In 1939, a collection of 16 poems and seven of the 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934, appeared as _The Map of Love_.[64] Ten stories in his next book, _Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog_ (1940), were based less on lavish fantasy than those in _The Map of Love_ and more on real-life romances featuring himself in Wales.[65] Sales of both books were poor, resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees from writing and reviewing. At this time he borrowed heavily from friends and acquaintances.[66] Hounded by creditors, Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 and moved to the home of critic John Davenport in Marshfield, Gloucestershire. There Thomas collaborated with Davenport on the satire _The Death of the King's Canary_, though due to fears of libel the work was not published until 1976.[67][68]

At the outset of the Second World War, Thomas was worried about conscription, and referred to his ailment as "an unreliable lung". Coughing sometimes confined him to bed, and he had a history of bringing up blood and mucus.[69] After initially seeking employment in a reserved occupation, he managed to be classified Grade III, which meant that he would be among the last to be called up for service. Saddened to see his friends going on active service, he continued drinking and struggled to support his family. He wrote begging letters to random literary figures asking for support, a plan he hoped would provide a long-term regular income.[70] Thomas supplemented his income by writing scripts for the BBC, which not only gave him additional earnings but also provided evidence that he was engaged in essential war work.[71]

In February 1941, Swansea was bombed by the Luftwaffe in a "three nights' blitz". Castle Street was one of many streets that suffered badly; rows of shops, including the Kardomah Café, were destroyed. Thomas walked through the bombed-out shell of the town centre with his friend Bert Trick. Upset at the sight, he concluded: "Our Swansea is dead".[72] Soon after the bombing raids, Thomas wrote a radio play, _Return Journey Home_, which described the café as being "razed to the snow".[73] The play was first broadcast on 15 June 1947. The Kardomah Café reopened on Portland Street after the war.[74]

In May 1941, Thomas and Caitlin left their son with his grandmother at Blashford and moved to London.[75] Thomas hoped to find employment in the film industry and wrote to the director of the films division of the Ministry of Information (MOI).[76] After being rebuffed, he found work with Strand Films, providing him with his first regular income since the _Daily Post_.[77] Strand produced films for the MOI; Thomas scripted at least five films in 1942, _This Is Colour_ (a history of the British dyeing industry) and _New Towns For Old_ (on post-war reconstruction). _These Are The Men_ (1943) was a more ambitious piece in which Thomas's verse accompanies Leni Riefenstahl's footage of an early Nuremberg Rally. _Conquest of a Germ_ (1944) explored the use of early antibiotics in the fight against pneumonia and tuberculosis. _Our Country_ (1945) was a romantic tour of Britain set to Thomas's poetry.[78][79]

In early 1943, Thomas began a relationship with Pamela Glendower; one of several affairs he had during his marriage.[80] The affairs either ran out of steam or were halted after Caitlin discovered his infidelity.[81] In March 1943 Caitlin gave birth to a daughter, Aeronwy, in London.[82] They lived in a run-down studio in Chelsea, made up of a single large room with a curtain to separate the kitchen.[83]

In 1944, with the threat of German flying bombs on London, Thomas moved to the family cottage at Blaen Cwm near Llangain,[84] where Thomas resumed writing poetry, completing "Holy Spring" and "Vision and Prayer".[85] In September Thomas and Caitlin moved to New Quay in Cardiganshire (Ceredigion), which inspired Thomas to pen the radio piece _Quite Early One Morning_, a sketch for his later work, _Under Milk Wood_.[86] Of the poetry written at this time, of note is "Fern Hill", believed to have been started while living in New Quay, but completed at Blaen Cwm in mid-1945.[87][88]

Broadcasting years 1945–1949

Although Thomas had previously written for the BBC, it was a minor and intermittent source of income. In 1943 he wrote and recorded a 15-minute talk entitled "Reminiscences of Childhood" for the Welsh BBC. In December 1944 he recorded _Quite Early One Morning_ (produced by Aneirin Talfan Davies, again for the Welsh BBC) but when Davies offered it for national broadcast BBC London turned it down.[89] On 31 August 1945 the BBC Home Service broadcast _Quite Early One Morning_, and in the three years beginning October 1945, Thomas made over a hundred broadcasts for the corporation.[90] Thomas was employed not only for his poetry readings, but for discussions and critiques.[91][92]

By late September 1945 the Thomases had left Wales and were living with various friends in London.[93] The publication of _Deaths and Entrances_ in 1946 was a turning point for Thomas. Poet and critic Walter J. Turner commented in _The Spectator_, "This book alone, in my opinion, ranks him as a major poet".[94]

In the second half of 1945 Thomas began reading for the BBC Radio programme, _Book of Verse_, broadcast weekly to the Far East.[95] This provided Thomas with a regular income and brought him into contact with Louis MacNeice, a congenial drinking companion whose advice Thomas cherished.[96] On 29 September 1946, the BBC began transmitting the _Third Programme_, a high-culture network which provided opportunities for Thomas.[97] He appeared in the play _Comus_ for the Third Programme, the day after the network launched, and his rich, sonorous voice led to character parts, including the lead in Aeschylus' _Agamemnon_ and Satan in an adaptation of _Paradise Lost_.[98][99] Thomas remained a popular guest on radio talk shows for the BBC, who regarded him as "useful should a younger generation poet be needed".[100] He had an uneasy relationship with BBC management and a staff job was never an option, with drinking cited as the problem.[101] Despite this, Thomas became a familiar radio voice and within Britain was "in every sense a celebrity".[102]

Thomas visited the home of historian A. J. P. Taylor in Disley. Although Taylor disliked him intensely, he stayed for a month, drinking "on a monumental scale", up to 15 or 20 pints of beer a day. In late 1946 Thomas turned up at the Taylors' again, this time homeless and with Caitlin. Margaret Taylor let them take up residence in the garden summerhouse.[103] After a three month holiday in Italy, Thomas and family moved, in September 1947, into the Manor House in South Leigh, just west of Oxford. He continued with his work for the BBC, completed a number of film scripts and worked further on his ideas for _Under Milk Wood_. In May 1949 Thomas and his family moved to his final home, the Boat House at Laugharne, purchased for him at a cost of £2,500 in April 1949 by Margaret Taylor.[104] Thomas acquired a garage a hundred yards from the house on a cliff ledge which he turned into his writing shed, and where he wrote several of his most acclaimed poems.[105] Just before moving into there, Thomas rented "Pelican House" opposite his regular drinking den, Brown's Hotel, for his parents[106][107] who lived there from 1949 until 1953. It was there that his father died and the funeral was held.[108] Caitlin gave birth to their third child, a boy named Colm Garan Hart, on 25 July 1949.[109]

American tours, 1950–1953

Canadian poet John Brinnin invited Thomas to New York, where in 1950 they embarked on a lucrative three-month tour of arts centres and campuses.[110] The tour, which began in front of an audience of a thousand at the Kaufmann Auditorium of the Poetry Centre in New York, took in about 40 venues.[111][112][113] During the tour Thomas was invited to many parties and functions and on several occasions became drunk – going out of his way to shock people – and was a difficult guest.[114] Thomas drank before some of his readings, though it is argued he may have pretended to be more affected by it than he actually was.[115] The writer Elizabeth Hardwick recalled how intoxicating a performer he was and how the tension would build before a performance: "Would he arrive only to break down on the stage? Would some dismaying scene take place at the faculty party? Would he be offensive, violent, obscene?"[116] Caitlin said in her memoir, "Nobody ever needed encouragement less, and he was drowned in it."[117]

On returning to Britain Thomas began work on two further poems, "In the white giant's thigh", which he read on the _Third Programme_ in September 1950, and the incomplete "In country heaven".[118] 1950 is also believed to be the year that he began work on _Under Milk Wood_, under the working title 'The Town That Was Mad'.[119] The task of seeing this work through to production was assigned to the BBC's Douglas Cleverdon, who had been responsible for casting Thomas in 'Paradise Lost'.[120] Despite Cleverdon's urges, the script slipped from Thomas's priorities and in early 1951 he took a trip to Iran to work on a film for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The film was never made, with Thomas returning to Wales in February, though his time there allowed him to provide a few minutes of material for a BBC documentary entitled 'Persian Oil'.[121] Early that year Thomas wrote two poems, which Thomas's principal biographer, Paul Ferris describes as "unusually blunt"; the ribald "Lament" and an ode, in the form of a villanelle, to his dying father "Do not go gentle into that good night".[122]

Despite a range of wealthy patrons, including Margaret Taylor, Princess Marguerite Caetani and Marged Howard-Stepney, Thomas was still in financial difficulty, and he wrote several begging letters to notable literary figures including the likes of T. S. Eliot.[123] Taylor was not keen on Thomas taking another trip to the United States, and thought that if Thomas had a permanent address in London he would be able to gain steady work there.[124] She bought a property, 54 Delancey Street, in Camden Town, and in late 1951 Thomas and Caitlin lived in the basement flat.[125] Thomas would describe the flat as his "London house of horror" and did not return there after his 1952 tour of America.[126]

Thomas undertook a second tour of the United States in 1952, this time with Caitlin – after she had discovered he had been unfaithful on his earlier trip.[127] They drank heavily, and Thomas began to suffer with gout and lung problems. The second tour was the most intensive of the four, taking in 46 engagements.[128] The trip also resulted in Thomas recording his first poetry to vinyl, which Caedmon Records released in America later that year.[129] One of his works recorded during this time, _A Child's Christmas in Wales_, became his most popular prose work in America.[130] The original 1952 recording of _A Child's Christmas in Wales_ was a 2008 selection for the United States National Recording Registry, stating that it is "credited with launching the audiobook industry in the United States".[131]

In April 1953 Thomas returned alone for a third tour of America.[132] He performed a "work in progress" version of _Under Milk Wood_, solo, for the first time at Harvard University on 3 May.[133] A week later the work was performed with a full cast at the Poetry Centre in New York. He met the deadline only after being locked in a room by Brinnin's assistant, Liz Reitell, and was still editing the script on the afternoon of the performance; its last lines were handed to the actors as they put on their makeup.[134][135]

During this penultimate tour Thomas met the composer Igor Stravinsky who had become an admirer after having been introduced to his poetry by W. H. Auden. They had discussions about collaborating on a "musical theatrical work" for which Thomas would provide the libretto on the theme of "the rediscovery of love and language in what might be left after the world after the bomb." The shock of Thomas's death later in the year moved Stravinsky to compose his _In Memoriam Dylan Thomas_ for tenor, string quartet, and four trombones. The first performance in Los Angeles in 1954 was introduced with a tribute to Thomas from Aldous Huxley.[136]

Thomas spent the last nine or ten days of his third tour in New York mostly in the company of Reitell, with whom he had an affair.[137] During this time Thomas fractured his arm falling down a flight of stairs when drunk. Reitell's doctor, Milton Feltenstein, put his arm in plaster and treated him for gout and gastritis.[138]

After returning home, Thomas worked on _Under Milk Wood_ in Wales before sending the original manuscript to Douglas Cleverdon on 15 October 1953. It was copied and returned to Thomas, who lost it in a pub in London and required a duplicate to take to America.[139][140] Thomas flew to the States on 19 October 1953 for what would be his final tour.[141] He died in New York before the BBC could record _Under Milk Wood_.[142][143] Richard Burton starred in the first broadcast in 1954, and was joined by Elizabeth Taylor in a subsequent film.[144] In 1954 the play won the Prix Italia for literary or dramatic programmes.

Thomas's last collection _Collected Poems, 1934–1952_, published when he was 38, won the Foyle poetry prize.[145] Reviewing the volume, critic Philip Toynbee declared that "Thomas is the greatest living poet in the English language".[146] Thomas's father died from pneumonia just before Christmas 1952. In the first few months of 1953 his sister died from liver cancer, one of his patrons took an overdose of sleeping pills, three friends died at an early age and Caitlin had an abortion.[147]

Death

, in 2011|alt= A simple white cross engraved with a memorial message to Thomas stands in a grave yard]] Thomas arrived in New York on 20 October 1953 to undertake another tour of poetry-reading and talks, organised by John Brinnin.[148] Although he complained of chest trouble and gout while still in Britain, there is no record that he received medical treatment for either condition.[149][150] He was in a melancholy mood about the trip and his health was poor; he relied on an inhaler to aid his breathing and there were reports that he was suffering from blackouts.[151][152] His visit to say goodbye to BBC producer Philip Burton, a few days before he left for New York, was interrupted by a blackout. On his last night in London he had another in the company of his fellow poet Louis MacNeice. The next day he visited a doctor for a smallpox vaccination certificate.[153]

Plans called for a first appearance at a rehearsal of _Under Milk Wood_ at the Poetry Centre. Brinnin, who was director of the Poetry Centre, did not travel to New York but remained in Boston to write.[154] He handed responsibility to his assistant, Liz Reitell, who was keen to see Thomas for the first time since their three-week romance early in the year. She met Thomas at Idlewild Airport and was shocked at his appearance, as he looked "pale, delicate and shaky, not his usual robust self".[155] Thomas told her he had had a terrible week, had missed her terribly and wanted to go to bed with her. Despite Reitell's previous misgivings about their relationship, they spent the rest of the day and night together. After being taken by Reitell to check in at the Chelsea Hotel, Thomas took the first rehearsal of _Under Milk Wood_. They then went to the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, before returning to the Chelsea Hotel.[156]

The next day Reitell invited him to her apartment, but he declined. They went sightseeing, but Thomas felt unwell and retired to his bed for the rest of the afternoon. Reitell gave him half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of phenobarbitone to help him sleep and spent the night at the hotel with him. Two days later, on 23 October, Herb Hannum, a friend from an earlier trip, noticed how sick Thomas looked and suggested an appointment with Feltenstein before the performances of _Under Milk Wood_ that evening. Feltenstein administered injections and Thomas made it through the two performances, but collapsed immediately afterwards.[157] Reitell later said that Feltenstein was "rather a wild doctor who thought injections would cure anything".[158] |alt= On the corner of a block is a building with large glass fronts on both sides; a sign displaying the tavern's name shines brightly above in red neon.]]

On the evening of 27 October Thomas attended his 39th birthday party but felt unwell and returned to his hotel after an hour.[159] The next day he took part in _Poetry and the Film_, a recorded symposium at Cinema 16, with panellists Amos Vogel, Arthur Miller, Maya Deren, Parker Tyler, and Willard Maas.[160][161]

A turning point came on 2 November. Air pollution in New York had risen significantly and exacerbated chest illnesses such as Thomas had. By the end of the month over 200 New Yorkers had died from the smog.[162] On 3 November, Thomas spent most of the day in bed drinking.[163] He went out in the evening to keep two drink appointments. After returning to the hotel he went out again for a drink at 2 am. After drinking at the White Horse, a pub he had found through Scottish poet Ruthven Todd, Thomas returned to the Hotel Chelsea, declaring, "I've had 18 straight whiskies. I think that's the record!"[164] The barman and the owner of the pub who served him later commented that Thomas could not have imbibed more than half that amount.[165] Thomas had an appointment at a clam house in New Jersey with Todd on 4 November.[166] When phoned at the Chelsea that morning, he said he was feeling ill and postponed the engagement. Later he went drinking with Reitell at the White Horse and, feeling sick again, returned to the hotel.[167] Feltenstein came to see him three times that day, administering the cortisone secretant ACTH by injection and, on his third visit, half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of morphine sulphate, which affected his breathing. Reitell became increasingly concerned and telephoned Feltenstein for advice. He suggested she get male assistance, so she called upon the painter Jack Heliker, who arrived before 11 pm.[168] At midnight on 5 November Thomas's breathing became more difficult and his face turned blue.[169] An ambulance was summoned.[170][171]

Thomas was admitted to the emergency ward at St Vincent's Hospital at 1:58 am. He was comatose, and his medical notes state that "the impression upon admission was acute alcoholic encephalopathy damage to the brain by alcohol, for which the patient was treated without response".[172] Caitlin flew to America the following day and was taken to the hospital, by which time a tracheotomy had been performed. Her reported first words were, "Is the bloody man dead yet?"[173] She was allowed to see Thomas only for 40 minutes in the morning[174] but returned in the afternoon and, in a drunken rage, threatened to kill John Brinnin. When she became uncontrollable, she was put in a straitjacket and committed, by Feltenstein, to the River Crest private psychiatric detox clinic on Long Island.[175]

It is also now believed, however, that Thomas had been suffering from bronchitis and pneumonia, as well as emphysema, immediately before his death. In their 2004 book _Dylan Remembered 1935–1953, Volume 2_, David N. Thomas and Dr Simon Barton disclose that Thomas was found to have pneumonia when he was admitted to hospital in a coma. Doctors took three hours to restore his breathing, using artificial respiration and oxygen. Summarising their findings, they conclude: "The medical notes indicate that, on admission, Dylan's bronchial disease was found to be very extensive, affecting upper, mid and lower lung fields, both left and right."[176] Thomas died at noon on 9 November, having never recovered from his coma.[177][178]

Aftermath

, largely untouched since his death]] Rumours circulated of a brain haemorrhage, followed by competing reports of a mugging or even that Thomas had drunk himself to death.[179] Later, speculation arose about drugs and diabetes. At the post-mortem, the pathologist found three causes of death – pneumonia, brain swelling and a fatty liver. Despite his heavy drinking, the poet's liver showed no sign of cirrhosis.[180]

The publication of John Brinnin's 1955 biography _Dylan Thomas in America_ cemented Thomas's legacy as the "doomed poet"; Brinnin focuses on Thomas's last few years and paints a picture of him as a drunk and a philanderer.[181] Later biographies have criticised Brinnin's view, especially his coverage of Thomas's death. David Thomas in _Fatal Neglect: Who Killed Dylan Thomas?_ claims that Brinnin, along with Reitell and Feltenstein, were culpable.[182] FitzGibbon's 1965 biography ignores Thomas's heavy drinking and skims over his death, giving just two pages in his detailed book to Thomas's demise. Ferris in his 1989 biography includes Thomas's heavy drinking, but is more critical of those around him in his final days and does not draw the conclusion that he drank himself to death. Many sources have criticised Feltenstein's role and actions, especially his incorrect diagnosis of delirium tremens and the high dose of morphine he administered.[183] Dr C. G. de Gutierrez-Mahoney, the doctor who treated Thomas while at St. Vincents, concluded that Feltenstein's failure to see that Thomas was gravely ill and have him admitted to hospital sooner "was even more culpable than his use of morphine".[184]

Caitlin Thomas's autobiographies, _Caitlin Thomas – Leftover Life to Kill_ (1957) and _My Life with Dylan Thomas: Double Drink Story_ (1997), describe the effects of alcohol on the poet and on their relationship. "Ours was not only a love story, it was a drink story, because without alcohol it would never had got on its rocking feet", she wrote,[185] and "The bar was our altar."[186] Biographer Andrew Lycett ascribed the decline in Thomas's health to an alcoholic co-dependent relationship with his wife, who deeply resented his extramarital affairs.[187] In contrast, Dylan biographers Andrew Sinclair and George Tremlett express the view that Thomas was not an alcoholic.[188] Tremlett argues that many of Thomas's health issues stemmed from undiagnosed diabetes.[189]

Thomas died intestate, with assets to the value of £100.[190] His body was brought back to Wales for burial in the village churchyard at Laugharne.[191] Thomas's funeral, which Brinnin did not attend, took place at St Martin's Church in Laugharne on 24 November. Six friends from the village carried Thomas's coffin.[192] Caitlin, without her customary hat, walked behind the coffin, with his childhood friend Daniel Jones at her arm and her mother by her side.[193][194] The procession to the church was filmed and the wake took place at Brown's Hotel.[195][196] Thomas's fellow poet and long-time friend Vernon Watkins wrote _The Times_ obituary.[197]

Thomas's widow, Caitlin, died in 1994 and was buried alongside him.[198] Thomas's father "DJ" died on 16 December 1952 and his mother Florence in August 1958. Thomas's elder son, Llewelyn, died in 2000, his daughter, Aeronwy in 2009 and his youngest son Colm in 2012.[199][200][201]


Poetry

Poetic style and influences

Thomas's refusal to align with any literary group or movement has made him and his work difficult to categorise.[202] Although influenced by the modern symbolism and surrealism movement he refused to follow its creed.[203] Instead Thomas is viewed as part of the modernism and romanticism movements, though attempts to pigeon-hole him within a particular neo-romantic school have been unsuccessful.[204] Elder Olson, in his 1954 critical study of Thomas's poetry, wrote "... a further characteristic which distinguished Thomas's work from that of other poets. It was unclassifiable." Olson continued that in a postmodern age that continually attempted to demand that poetry have social reference, none could be found in Thomas's work, and that his work was so obscure that critics could not explicate it.[205]

Thomas's verbal style played against strict verse forms, such as in the villanelle "Do not go gentle into that good night". His images were carefully ordered in a patterned sequence, and his major theme was the unity of all life, the continuing process of life and death and new life that linked the generations. Thomas saw biology as a magical transformation producing unity out of diversity, and in his poetry sought a poetic ritual to celebrate this unity. He saw men and women locked in cycles of growth, love, procreation, new growth, death, and new life. Therefore, each image engenders its opposite. Thomas derived his closely woven, sometimes self-contradictory images from the Bible, Welsh folklore, preaching, and Sigmund Freud.[206] Explaining the source of his imagery, Thomas wrote in a letter to Glyn Jones: "My own obscurity is quite an unfashionable one, based, as it is, on a preconceived symbolism derived (I'm afraid all this sounds wooly and pretentious) from the cosmic significance of the human anatomy".[207]

Thomas's early poetry was noted for its verbal density, alliteration, sprung rhythm and internal rhyme, and he was described by some critics as having been influenced by the English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins.[208] This is attributed to Hopkins, who taught himself Welsh and who used sprung verse, bringing some features of Welsh poetic metre into his work.[209] When Henry Treece wrote to Thomas comparing his style to that of Hopkins, Thomas wrote back denying any such influence.[210] One poet Thomas greatly admired, and who is regarded as an influence, was Thomas Hardy.[211][212] When Thomas travelled in America, he recited Hardy's work in his readings.[213]

Other poets from whom critics believe Thomas drew influence include James Joyce, Arthur Rimbaud and D. H. Lawrence. William York Tindall, in his 1962 study, _A Reader's Guide to Dylan Thomas_, finds comparison between Thomas's and Joyce's wordplay, while he notes the themes of rebirth and nature are common to the works of Lawrence and Thomas.[214][215] Although Thomas described himself as the "Rimbaud of Cwmdonkin Drive", he stated that the phrase "Swansea's Rimbaud" was coined by poet Roy Campbell.[216][217][218] Critics have explored the connection between the creation of Thomas's mythological pasts into his works such as "The Orchards", which Ann Elizabeth Mayer believes reflects the Welsh myths of the _Mabinogion_.[219][220][221] Thomas's poetry is notable for its musicality,[222] most clear in "Fern Hill", "In Country Sleep", "Ballad of the Long-legged Bait" and "In the White Giant's Thigh" from _Under Milk Wood_.

Thomas once confided that the poems which had most influenced him were _Mother Goose_ rhymes which his parents taught him when he was a child:

  I should say I wanted to write poetry in the beginning because I had fallen in love with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance ... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.[223]

Thomas was an accomplished writer of prose poetry, with collections such as _Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog_ (1940) and _Quite Early One Morning_ (1954) showing he was capable of writing moving short stories.[224] His first published prose work was _After the Fair_, printed in The New English Weekly on 15 March 1934.[225] Jacob Korg believes that Thomas's fiction work can be classified into two main bodies, vigorous fantasies in a poetic style and, after 1939, more straightforward narratives.[226] Korg surmises that Thomas approached his prose writing as an alternate poetic form, which allowed him to produce complex, involuted narratives that do not allow the reader to rest.[227]

As a 'Welsh' poet

Thomas disliked being regarded as a provincial poet, and decried any notion of 'Welshness' in his poetry.[228] When he wrote to Stephen Spender in 1952, thanking him for a review of his _Collected Poems_, he added "Oh, & I forgot. I'm not influenced by Welsh bardic poetry. I can't read Welsh."[229] Despite this his work was rooted in the geography of Wales. Thomas acknowledged that he returned to Wales when he had difficulty writing, and John Ackerman argues that "His inspiration and imagination were rooted in his Welsh background".[230][231] Caitlin Thomas wrote that he worked "in a fanatically narrow groove, although there was nothing narrow about the depth and understanding of his feelings. The groove of direct hereditary descent in the land of his birth, which he never in thought, and hardly in body, moved out of."[232]

Head of Programmes Wales at the BBC, Aneirin Talfan Davies, who commissioned several of Thomas's early radio talks, believed that the poet's "whole attitude is that of the medieval bards." Kenneth O. Morgan counter-argues that it is a 'difficult enterprise' to find traces of _cynghanedd_ (consonant harmony) or _cerdd dafod_ (tongue-craft) in Thomas's poetry.[233] Instead he believes his work, especially his earlier more autobiographical poems, are rooted in a changing country which echoes the Welshness of the past and the Anglicisation of the new industrial nation: "rural and urban, chapel-going and profane, Welsh and English, Unforgiving and deeply compassionate."[234] Fellow poet and critic Glyn Jones believed that any traces of _cynghanedd_ in Thomas's work were accidental, although he felt Thomas consciously employed one element of Welsh metrics; that of counting syllables per line instead of feet. Constantine Fitzgibbon, Thomas's first in-depth biographer, wrote "No major English poet has ever been as Welsh as Dylan".[235]

Although Thomas had a deep connection with Wales, he disliked Welsh nationalism. He once wrote, "Land of my fathers, and my fathers can keep it".[236][237] While often attributed to Thomas himself, this line actually comes from the character Owen Morgan-Vaughan, in the screenplay Thomas wrote for the 1948 British melodrama _The Three Weird Sisters_. Robert Pocock, a friend from the BBC, recalled "I only once heard Dylan express an opinion on Welsh Nationalism. He used three words. Two of them were Welsh Nationalism."[238] Although not expressed as strongly, Glyn Jones believed that he and Thomas's friendship cooled in the later years as he had not 'rejected enough' of the elements that Thomas disliked – "Welsh nationalism and a sort of hill farm morality".[239] Apologetically, in a letter to Keidrych Rhys, editor of literary magazine _Wales_, Thomas's father wrote that he was "afraid Dylan isn't much of a Welshman".[240] Though FitzGibbon asserts that Thomas's negativity towards Welsh nationalism was fostered by his father's hostility towards the Welsh language.[241]


Critical reception

Thomas's work and stature as a poet have been much debated by critics and biographers since his death. Critical studies have been clouded by Thomas's personality and mythology, especially his drunken persona and death in New York. When Seamus Heaney gave an Oxford lecture on the poet he opened by addressing the assembly, "Dylan Thomas is now as much a case history as a chapter in the history of poetry", querying how 'Thomas the Poet' is one of his forgotten attributes.[242] David Holbrook, who has written three books about Thomas, stated in his 1962 publication _Llareggub Revisited_, "the strangest feature of Dylan Thomas's notoriety—not that he is bogus, but that attitudes to poetry attached themselves to him which not only threaten the prestige, effectiveness and accessibility to English poetry, but also destroyed his true voice and, at last, him."[243] The Poetry Archive notes that "Dylan Thomas's detractors accuse him of being drunk on language as well as whiskey, but whilst there's no doubt that the sound of language is central to his style, he was also a disciplined writer who re-drafted obsessively".[244]

Many critics have argued that Thomas's work is too narrow and that he suffers from verbal extravagance.[245] Those that have championed his work have found the criticism baffling. Robert Lowell wrote in 1947, "Nothing could be more wrongheaded than the English disputes about Dylan Thomas's greatness ... He is a dazzling obscure writer who can be enjoyed without understanding."[246] Kenneth Rexroth said, on reading _Eighteen Poems_, "The reeling excitement of a poetry-intoxicated schoolboy smote the Philistine as hard a blow with one small book as Swinburne had with _Poems and Ballads_."[247] Philip Larkin in a letter to Kingsley Amis in 1948, wrote that "no one can 'stick words into us like pins'... like he [Thomas] can", but followed that by stating that he "doesn't use his words to any advantage".[248] Amis was far harsher, finding little of merit in his work, and claiming that he was 'frothing at the mouth with piss.'[249] In 1956, the publication of the anthology _New Lines_ featuring works by the British collective The Movement, which included Amis and Larkin amongst its number, set out a vision of modern poetry that was damning towards the poets of the 1940s. Thomas's work in particular was criticised. David Lodge, writing about The Movement in 1981 stated "Dylan Thomas was made to stand for everything they detest, verbal obscurity, metaphysical pretentiousness, and romantic rhapsodizing".[250]

Despite criticism by sections of academia, Thomas's work has been embraced by readers more so than many of his contemporaries, and is one of the few modern poets whose name is recognised by the general public.[251] In 2009, over 18,000 votes were cast in a BBC poll to find the UK's favourite poet; Thomas was placed 10th.[252] Several of his poems have passed into the cultural mainstream, and his work has been used by authors, musicians and film and television writers.[253] The BBC Radio programme, Desert Island Discs, in which guests usually choose their favourite songs, has heard 50 participants select a Dylan Thomas recording.[254] John Goodby states that this popularity with the reading public allows Thomas's work to be classed as vulgar and common.[255] He also cites that despite a brief period during the 1960s when Thomas was considered a cultural icon, that the poet has been marginalized in critical circles due to his exuberance, in both life and work, and his refusal to know his place. Goodby believes that Thomas has been mainly snubbed since the 1970s and has become "... an embarrassment to twentieth-century poetry criticism",[256] his work failing to fit standard narratives and thus being ignored rather than studied.[257]


Memorials

In Swansea's maritime quarter are the Dylan Thomas Theatre, home of the Swansea Little Theatre of which Thomas was once a member, and the former Guildhall built in 1825 and now occupied by the Dylan Thomas Centre, a literature centre, where exhibitions and lectures are held and setting for the annual Dylan Thomas Festival.[258] Outside the centre stands a bronze statue of Thomas, by John Doubleday.[259] Another monument to Thomas stands in Cwmdonkin Park, one of his favourite childhood haunts, close to his birthplace. The memorial is a small rock in an enclosed garden within the park cut by and inscribed by the late sculptor Ronald Cour [260][261] with the closing lines from Fern Hill.



        Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means
        Time held me green and dying
        Though I sang in my chains like the sea.[262]

, Westminster Abbey]] Thomas's home in Laugharne, the Boathouse, is a museum run by Carmarthenshire County Council.[263] Thomas's writing shed is also preserved.[264] In 2004, the Dylan Thomas Prize was created in his honour, awarded to the best published writer in English under the age of 30.[265] In 2005, the Dylan Thomas Screenplay Award was established. The prize, administered by the Dylan Thomas Centre, is awarded at the annual Swansea Bay Film Festival. In 1982 a plaque was unveiled in Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey.[266] The plaque is also inscribed with the last two lines of Fern Hill.

In 2014, to celebrate the centenary of Thomas's birth, the British Council Wales undertook a year-long programme of cultural and educational works.[267] Highlights included a touring replica of Thomas's work shed, Sir Peter Blake's exhibition of illustrations based on _Under Milk Wood_ and a 36-hour marathon of readings, which included Michael Sheen and Sir Ian McKellen performing Thomas's work.[268][269][270] The Royal Patron of The Dylan Thomas 100 Festival was Charles, Prince of Wales, who made a recording of _Fern Hill_ for the event.[271]

[215] In reply to a student's questions in 1951, Thomas stated: "I do not think that Joyce has had any hand at all in my writing; certainly his _Ulysses_ has not. On the other hand, I cannot deny on the shaping of some of my _Portrait_ stories might owe something to Joyce's stories in the volume, _Dubliners_. But then _Dubliners_ was a pioneering work in the world of the short story, and no good storywriter since can have failed, in some way, however little, to have benefited by it." FitzGibbon (1965), p. 370

[218] In his notes to page 186, Ferris (1989) states that in a BBC Home Service programme aired in 1950, _Poetic Licence_, in which Campbell and Thomas appeared, Thomas said "I won't forgive you for the Swansea's Rimbaud, because you called me that first Roy".

[221] "The Orchard" makes reference to the 'Black Book of Llareggub'. Here Thomas makes links with religion and the mythic Wales of the White Book of Rhydderch and the Black Book of Carmarthen.
