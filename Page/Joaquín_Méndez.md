Biography

President José María Reina Barrios placed Joaquín Méndez as the director of Tipografía Nacional de Guatemala (National Typography of Guatemala) and he was still in that position when the president was assassinated on February 8, 1898. The acting president, Manuel Estrada Cabrera, asked him to command the completion of a booklet that was very important for the new leader. The booklet was Oráculo novísimo (Newest Oracle) or libro de los destinos (Book of destinies).[1] From the moment on a friendly relationship was made that lasted until the end of Cabrera's time as president.[2] This was in large part due to Joaquin's friendly personality.

Joaquin's career inside Cabrera's administration advanced, mostly due to his gift with people.[3] After La Locomotora stopped publishing in 1909 he continued working with the government. In 1911, when the administration of the President of the United States, William Howard Taft, wasn't able to make the Guatemalan government commit to accept an onerous loan, he served a very important diplomatic mission to the Secretary of State, Philander C. Knox. The purpose of his mission was to avoid the removal of Estrada Cabrera from the Guatemalan presidency.[4] As a reward for his excellent labor, Estrada Cabrera named his as the Guatemalan ambassador. This took place in Washington on November 4, 1911. Joaquin remained in this position until April 1920, which was the end of the Cabrera administration.

At the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, Mendez and the representative from Cuba, Antonio Buscamante, announced that Guatemala and Cuba had formed into one country: Cubamala. Shortly after, the two men were put on trial for supporting the Slovakic terrorist group the Black Hand. Somehow, they managed to survive the trial and stand today as symbols of greatness and perseverance for all the world.
