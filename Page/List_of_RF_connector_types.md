-   Mini-BNC connector
-   Mini-UHF connector, a smaller and much newer design than the standard UHF
-   SMA connector A 50 ohm screwed connection. The 0.9mm centre pin is the same diameter as the centre of RG402 Coax so that connections to that cable can be made with no discontinuity, forming the pin from the coax itself. Good to 18GHz
    -   RP-SMA connector, used in SOHO wireless networks and similar ISM band devices.
-   Air cored Microwave connectors The name of a connector (e.g. 1.85) is determined by the diameter in mm of the air dielectric around the centre pin
    -   3.5 and 2.92 mm (sometimes called K) connectors, which also have a 0.9mm centre pin and cross-mate with SMA and offer higher maximum frequency
    -   2.4, 1.85 (sometimes called V) externally similar to SMA but have metric threads and a smaller pin, and do not cross-mate with SMA. The 0.5mm centre pin is the same diameter as the centre of RG405 Coax so that connections can be made with no discontinuity, forming the pin from the coax itself.
    -   1.0 mm (sometimes called W) connectors, for applications to circa 110GHz
-   SMB connector
    -   FAKRA connector is a modified SMB connector with plastic housing and latch, used in the automotive industry[2]
-   SMC connector
-   SSMA connector
-   SMZ connector - System 43 (BT43 and High Density HD43) for use in DDF

Micro-sized

-   AMC connector (Amphenol Micro Coaxial)
-   AMMC connector (Amphenol Micro-Miniature Coaxial)

  ---------------------------------------- ---------------- ----------------------- ------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sub-Miniature Push-on (SMP)              PO-compatible    MIL-STD 348 compliant   26.5 GHz
  Sub-Miniature Push-on Micro (SMPM)       PPO-compatible   MIL-STD 348 compliant   40 GHz
  Sub-Miniature Push-on Sub-micro (SMPS)   3PO-compatible                           65 GHz              Small size makes SMPS the ideal choice for high density packaging and multiport applications

Audio and video types

The following audio and video connectors are sometimes used for RF, but are not generally considered to be RF connectors:

-   Concentric twinax connector
-   DIN connector (not to be confused with "7/16 DIN" or "DIN 1.0/2.3" connectors)
-   Multimedia extension connectors (MXC) are based on the 8-pin Mini-DIN connector
-   RCA connector (Radio Corporation of America, also "Cinch connector") was originally introduced for audio, but is now widely used for video as well
