Saint MAONACAN, otherwise MANCHAN (, , fl. A.D. 500) OF ATHLEAGUE (, "the stony-ford of St. Manchan" or "ford of flagstones", ), was an early Irish Christian saint. He founded a church in Athleague, in county Roscommon. Saint Manchan's feast day is celebrated on February 18 (February 7 in the Old Calendar), by Roman Catholics, and Anglicans. The life of Manchan of Athleague is obscured because many persons named Manchan are to be found among the monastically-inclined medieval Irish Christians.


Life

Nothing is known about the life of _Manchán of Athleague_. The period of this saint is unknown. He founded an early Christian monastery of Athleague, in county Roscommon. Moran (2010), provides the following local perspective:-

-   "_Another saint, Fionn Monganan is recorded as the true patron saint of Athleague and the village was known as ATHLIAG MONGANAN in the earliest annals. His powers of keeping pestilence and disease at bay is also remembered and the site of his hallowed cell is near the present Angling Centre beside the former ford._"{{#tag:ref|The name "Fionn Monganan" is mistaken, because "Fionn" relates to "_Ath-Liag-Finn_", otherwise Ballyleague, not Ath-Liag-Manchain. The name "Saint Monganan" is just another corruption of Mainchín.|group=n|name=noFionn}}

The sanctity of _Manchán of Athleague_ is first recorded in the _Annals of the Four Masters_ which records "_A.D. 1493, .. ()_", which confirms he was patron saint of Athleague, in County Roscommon. The "Martyrology of Donegal" records the Saint as "_, Maonacan, of Ath-liacc_", while "The martyrology of Gorman" notes "_Moenucan, of Ath liacc, Feb. 7. _".

The multiplicity of Saints called _Maenucan_, _Maonacan_, _Moenagain_ is because the name is a diminutive of , A MONK, so the real names of each recorded _Saint Manchan_ are unknown. Saint Manchan of Athleague was contemporary with the Twelve Apostles of Ireland, and Manchan of Mohill, as the establishment of the early Christian site of Athleague is given as c. A.D. 500. The Annals of the Four Masters calls Athleague the medieval names of- "_, and _".
