A SCREWDRIVER is a popular alcoholic highball drink made with orange juice and vodka. While the basic drink is simply the two ingredients, there are many variations. Many of the variations have different names in different parts of the world. The International Bartenders Association has designated this cocktail as an IBA Official Cocktail.
