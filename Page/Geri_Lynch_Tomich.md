Professional career

Coach Geri Lynch Tomich, once member of the Disney on Ice show, was invited by the Essex Skating Club in 2001 to start and lead its synchronized skating organization.[2][3]

Geri Lynch Tomich is the founder and the head coach of the Synchroettes synchronized skating teams, a not for profit organization that spans 10 teams and includes about 200 figure skaters. Synchroettes is one of the biggest such organizations in the United States and no longer represents the Essex Skating Club of New Jersey.[4][5][6][7]

The first practice of the newly formed Synchroettes was scheduled on September 11, 2001, the day when terrorists attacked the World Trade Center in New York City, killing nearly 3,000 people. In order to honor the 9/11 victims Synchroettes has added the U.S. flag to all team attires.[8]

She led her Synchroettes juvenile team to win gold medals at the U.S. National competition in 2010, pewter medals in 2012 and 2015. Her Synchroettes junior team won the U.S. East Coast Champions title in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Synchroettes preliminary team won the U.S. East Coast championship in 2016 and 2010[9][10]

In 2016, she debuted the Synchroettes Unified Team that gives an opportunity for kids with disabilities such as autism spectrum disorders to skate on the same team with competitive skaters. According to a number of recent scientific studies, therapeutic ice skating in kids with autism spectrum disorders was found to improve balance, motor skills, overall functional capacity as well as emotional health.[11][12][13][14][15])

New Jersey Governo Chris Christie came in September 2012 to see Synchroettes junior team practice as the sports has rapidly expanded throughout the country. He met Coach Geri Lynch Tomich and the skaters after the practice.[16]

In recognition of Synchroettes’ success in the national competitions, the U.S. Figure Skating Association selected its junior team as the Junior Team USA for three seasons in a row, including in 2012-2013, 2013–2014 and 2014-2015. As the Junior Team USA, the Synchroettes went to earn silver medals in 2014 and bronze medals in 2013 at the highly regarded Leon Lurje Trophy international competition in Sweden.[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48]

Due to the national and international achievements of the Synchroettes teams Dec. 18 is Synchroettes Day in Essex county, New Jersey, where their home rink is located.[49][50]
