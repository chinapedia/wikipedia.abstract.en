Gameplay

NEOGEO_Soccer_Brawl.png It is a futuristic soccer game that uses either bionic people or cyborgs for the players. It is a two-player game where you pick a home land from one of eight countries. After selecting one of two stadiums, either a dome or an open field, the 5-on-5 soccer match begins with a goalie for each team. You can hold either A for a power shot while on offense, or A for a super shot to disable opponents while on defense. You can perform tackle and slide. Captain wears a kerchief, can't shoot and can make super shot. Power shots rebound from walls except walls behind the goalie.

Rules

There are no fouls. Throw-in is made in case of the ball landing outside of field line. Match time is 2 min 30 sec.
