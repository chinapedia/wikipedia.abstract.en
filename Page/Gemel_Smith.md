In his first major junior season in 2010–11 with the Attack he finished with 16 points in 66 games.

After completing his OHL career with the London Knights, he was signed by the Dallas Stars to a three-year, entry-level contract on May 31, 2014.[1] He made his professional debut in the following 2014–15 season, after he was assigned by the Stars to AHL affiliate, the Texas Stars. In 68 games with Texas, Smith contributed with 10 goals and 27 points in 68 games as a rookie.

In the 2016–17 season, with a rash of injuries suffered in Dallas, Smith received his first recall to the NHL on October 22, 2016.[2] He made his NHL debut with the Stars that night, skating on the fourth-line in a 3–0 loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets.[3] In his seventh game with the Stars, Smith sscored his first two NHL goals in a 4–3 overtime loss to the Chicago Blackhawks on November 6, 2016.[4]

On July 11, 2017, the Stars re-signed Smith to a one-year, two-way contract worth $650,000.[5] In his first full season with the club, Smith recorded six goals and 11 points in 46 games, often finding himself as a healthy scratch.

On August 3, 2018, the Stars re-signed Smith to a one-year, $720,000 contract extension.[6] During the 2018–19 season, on December 6, Smith was claimed off waivers by the Boston Bruins.[7][8] Smith appeared in 3 games with Boston before he was re-assigned to affiliate, the Providence Bruins, upon clearing waivers on December 19, 2018.[9] In playing out his contract in Providence, Smith was an offensive presence in contributing with 40 points in 47 games.
