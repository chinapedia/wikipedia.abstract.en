Pauline_Bradford_Mackie_Hopkins.png PAULINE BRADFORD MACKIE HOPKINS (July 5, 1873 - 1956) was an American writer of historical fiction.

Pauline Bradford Mackie was born in Fairfield, Connecticut on July 5, 1873. Her father, Rev. Andrew Mackie, was an Episcopal clergyman and a scholarly man, from whom she inherited her literary talent. For two years after her graduation from the Toledo High School, she was engaged as a writer on the _Toledo Blade_. She soon abandoned this for a literary career, and most of her stories appeared in magazines and newspapers. "Mademoiselle de Berny" and "Ye Lyttle Salem Maide" were, after most trying experiences with publishers, printed in book form. "A Georgian Actress" was written in Berkeley, California, where Hopkins had gone with her husband, Dr. Herbert MÃ¼ller Hopkins (b. Hannibal, Missouri, 1870), who later became the chair of Latin in Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut, where she also wrote two novels of Washington life during the American Civil War.


Selected works

_The Washingtonians_, with a frontispiece by Philip R. Goodwin, deals with Washington D.C. official society in the early 1860s. The plot is based upon the career of a brilliant and well-known woman, who was at that time a power in official circles. _Mademoiselle de Berny_, with five full-page photogravures from drawings by Frank T. Merrill, is a historical story in which Washington is made to figure. _A Georgian Actress_, illustrated by E. W. D. Hamilton, is a historical novel dealing with the life of the early settlers in the Mohawk Valley, just before the American Revolution. The heroine is a daughter of Sir William Johnson, Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Mohawk Valley. From the strange life in the wilderness the ambitious girl is transplanted to the happy life of the court of George III, and becomes famous as an actress in David Garrick's company. _Ye Lyttle Salem Maide: a Story of Witchcraft_, is a tale of the days of the reign of superstition in New England, and of a brave "1yttle maide" of Salem Town, whose faith and hope and unyielding adherence to her word of honor form the basis of the story. A convincing picture is drawn of Puritan life during the latter part of the 17th century. _The Story of Kate - a Tale of California Life for Girls_, contains illustrations by L. J. Bridgman. Kate is a California girl, whose university course has been interrupted, owing to her father's financial losses. The energetic Kate, not to be daunted by such difficulties, takes a district school in the mountains. The story recounts her experiences among the mountaineers.
