She was the first person to sing on the then high-definition standard (405 lines) in test transmissions by the BBC for the RadiOlympia Exhibition on 26 August 1936.[1] During the transmission, McKay sang _Here's Looking At You_, written especially for the transmission by Ronnie Hill.[2] McKay gave an interview to The National Museum of Photography, Film and Television in 1986, in which she spoke about her experience.[3]

During the 1930s, McKay was a vocalist in the Lew Stone dance band. In the 1940s McKay was a contributor to the war effort with ENSA concerts on the forces programme.[4] McKay was a member of the Debonaires,[5] a quartet, including Alex Dore, Nadia Dore and Harry Brooker.[6] The Debonaires sang with the Ambrose Orchestra, Felix Mendelssohn's Hawaiian Serenaders, Eric Winstone and his band, and also had a late night radio show.

In the 1950s, the personnel of the Debonaires changed to Nadia Dore, Bob Brown, Helen McKay and Bob Winette. McKay was to marry Bob Winnette, a singer, musician and songwriter. Together, they formed The Song Pedlars quartet.
