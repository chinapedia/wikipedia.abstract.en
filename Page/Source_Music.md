History

2009–2012

Source Music was founded on November 17, 2009. In 2010, Kan Mi-youn released her first digital single titled "Going Crazy".[2][3] The music video features Lee Joon and Mir from MBLAQ.[4] The song proved to be quite successful, and reached its peak at #11 on South Korea's national chart Gaon.

2012–2015

In 2012, Glam was formed. The group was a collaboration between Source Music and Big Hit Entertainment and consisted of members Dahee, Trinity, Zinni, Miso and Jiyeon. However, Trinity resigned before her debut due to personal reasons. The group was active until 2014 and was disbanded after Dahee was sentenced to one year in prison for a case of extortion against actor Lee Byung-hun. At that time, Glam's contract with Big Hit Entertainment ended. The members did not want to renew the contract, partly due to the Dahee scandal.[5]

2015–present

In 2015, GFriend was formed. The group is consisting of members Sowon, Yerin, Eunha, Yuju, SinB, and Umji.[6] They made their debut with extended play _Season of Glass_ on January 15, 2015.[7]
