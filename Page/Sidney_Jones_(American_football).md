Professional career

Coming out of college, Jones was projected as a first round pick by the majority of scouts and analysts. Prior to the NFL Combine, Jones was ranked as the fifth best cornerback in the draft by Pro Football Focus.[8] He attended the combine and decided to forgo performing the bench. On March 11, 2017, Jones attended Washington's highly anticipated pro day. On the final positional drill, he suffered an achilles injury and had to be carted off the field. The injury caused his stock to plummet, going from a projected first round pick to a second or third round pick by the majority of draft experts and analysts. After he was injured at Washington's Pro Day, he was ranked the ninth best cornerback by Sports Illustrated, the 13th best by ESPN, and the 13th best cornerback by NFLDraftScout.com.[9][10][11]

The Philadelphia Eagles selected Jones in the second round (43rd overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft.[12] He was the seventh cornerback selected in the draft. On May 11, 2017, the Eagles signed Jones to a four-year, $6.14 million contract with $3.34 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $2.60 million.[13] He was placed on the Reserve/Non-Football Injury list to start the season due to the Achilles injury.[14] On December 30, 2017, Jones was activated to the 53-man roster for the regular season finale against the Cowboys.[15] Jones was inactive for the playoffs, but the Eagles won Super Bowl LII 41-33 against the New England Patriots.[16]
