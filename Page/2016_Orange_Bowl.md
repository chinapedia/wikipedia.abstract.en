The 2016 ORANGE BOWL was a college football bowl game played on December 30, 2016 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, played between the Michigan Wolverines of the Big Ten Conference against the Florida State Seminoles of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). It was one of the 2016–17 bowl games that concluded the 2016 NCAA Division I FBS football season. Florida State won the game by a score of 33–32. Dalvin Cook, running back for the Seminoles, was named the game's MVP.

The game was played on the 30th instead of on December 31 or January 1, as the following day's College Football Playoff semi-final bowls were played with earlier kick-off times that intruded into the New Year's Six early-afternoon scheduling window.[1][2]
