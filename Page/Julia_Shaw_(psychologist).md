JULIA SHAW (born 1987) is a German-Canadian psychologist and popular science writer who specialises in false memories.


Education and academic career

Shaw was born in Cologne, Germany and grew up in Canada. In 2004 she started a BSc in psychology at the Simon Fraser University.[1] She went on to complete a Masters in Psychology and Law at Maastricht University in the Netherlands.[2] In 2009, she returned to Canada and was awarded a PhD at the University of British Columbia. Her doctoral thesis was entitled "Constructing Rich False Memories of Committing Crime".[3] Shaw remained in Canada, a lecturer at the University of Waterloo and the University of British Columbia.[4] In 2013 she became Lecturer in forensic psychology at University of Bedfordshire.[5] She joined London South Bank University as a Senior Lecturer in Criminology in 2015, before becoming an honorary[6] Research Associate at University College London in 2017.[7][8]

Shaw's expertise is in false memories and how law enforcement can use "tactics [that] may lead people to recall crimes that never occurred".[9] In one of her studies, she succeeded in getting 70% of the participants to create false memories or beliefs of events from their childhood that never took place, and this study was covered extensively in mainstream media.[10][11][12] The validity of this 70% finding has, however, been criticised by colleagues.[13] Shaw addressed the criticism in a 2018 article in _Psychological Science_.[14]


Public engagement

Shaw is a contributor to Scientific American.[15] She gives public lectures on psychology and memory.[16][17][18] In 2016 she created a NOVA PBC documentary, "Memory Hackers".[19] She contributes to podcasts and radio, and her work has been featured on the Discovery Channel and BBC, as well as appearing in Der Spiegel, Russia Today and The Times.[20][21][22][23][24][25] In 2016, Random House published her first book "_The Memory Illusion"_, which has since been translated into 14 different languages.[26][27] In 2017 she gave a TEDx talk "How False Memories Corrupt Our Identities, Politics and Justice System" at TEDxBergen and "Is Your Memory Just an Illusion?" at TEDxPorto.[28][29]
