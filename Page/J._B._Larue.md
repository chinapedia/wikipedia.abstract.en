J. B. LARUE was a California businessman and politician who founded the village of San Antonio in what is now Oakland, California.[1]


Life and work

Larue was born James Buskirk Larue[2] in Franklin, New Jersey on February 6, 1800.[3][4]

In 1835, Larue migrated from New jersey to Pipestone Township, Michigan, where he purchased land and built a sawmill.[5] From 1840 to 1841, Larue served as a representative in the Michigan legislature.[6][7] In 1850 he left Michigan for the California gold rush.[8]

Once in California, Larue purchased part of the Rancho San Antonio lands from Luis Maria Peralta in 1851, building a wharf and store at the same location.[9][10][11]

In 1857, Larue was elected to the California State Senate representing the county of Alameda.[12]

In 1858, Larue began the Oakland and San Antonio Steam Navigation Company, operating a cut-rate passenger ferry between Oakland and San Francisco.[13][14][15] Larue was sued by his competitor Minturn, who claimed an exclusive contract with the city of Oakland to operate the Oakland-San Francisco ferry route. The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme court, with Minturn's exclusivity claims being rejected.[16]

Larue died January 7, 1872 in Alameda county.[17][18]
