DEMONICIDUTH is a Swiss extreme metal band formed in 1998.


Background

Demoniciduth formed in October 1998 in Switzerland.[1][2] The band has had several member changes, minus bassist and vocalist Taanak. The band formed with Taanak and his brother Annihilith.[3] Annihilith departed from the band and hired on several members, Ashtaroth-Karnaïm (vocals), Nahalal (guitars) and Kisloth (drums).[4] The band was originally named Satanicide, but changed names due to an already existing band named Satanicide from the United States.[5] The band then renamed themselves, Demonicide.[6] And for third and final time, the band switched to their current name, Demoniciduth.[7] The band is bold in their faith with Christian lyrics.[8] The band even included an advisory sticker, stating:

There were several lineup changes during this time, which subsequently forced the band to go on hiatus in March 2002.[9] The band played at Elements of Rock in 2004.[10] The band reunited around 2010, and released an EP in 2011 with the style similar to bands such as Mortification.[11][12] In 2016, the band announced they had signed to Vision of God Records and will be releasing their second full-length, entitled, _Enemy of Satan_.[13]
