The DISSOCIATION RATE in chemistry, biochemistry, and pharmacology is the rate or speed at which a ligand dissociates from a protein, for instance, a receptor.[1] It is an important factor in the binding affinity and intrinsic activity (efficacy) of a ligand at a receptor.[2] The dissociation rate for a particular substrate can be applied to enzyme kinetics, including the Michaelis-Menten model.[3] Substrate dissociation rate contributes to how large or small the enzyme velocity will be.[4] In the Michaelis-Menten model, the enzyme binds to the substrate yielding an enzyme substrate complex, which can either go backwards by dissociating or go forward by forming a product.[5] The dissociation rate constant is defined using K_(off).[6]
