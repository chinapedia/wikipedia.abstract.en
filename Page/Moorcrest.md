MOORCREST is a house in Beachwood Canyon, Los Angeles, California, United States. It was built in 1921 for the utopian Krotona Colony in Beachwood Canyon and was designed by Marie Russak Hotchener, an architect who designed several buildings for the Theosophist community; Moorcrest is thought of as one of her most famous pieces.[1]

In the heart of the Hollywood Hills, Moorcrest was once the home of actor Charlie Chaplin, the first international star of the modern era. Later, Mary Astor, the star of _The Maltese Falcon_ among many other films, sometimes lived at Moorcrest. Her parents, Otto and Helen Langhanke, owned the home for a time.[2]

The house is now owned by musician Joanna Newsom and her husband, actor Andy Samberg.[3]
