The NANÇAY RADIO OBSERVATORY or NANÇAY RADIOASTRONOMY FACILITY' includes a number of radio telescopes:

-   The Nançay radio telescope
-   the Radio Heliograph, a T-shaped array (1.6 km by 1.25 km) composed of 47 antennas operating between frequencies of 150 and 450 MHz;
-   the Decametric Array composed of 144 spiral antenna operating between wavelengths of 3 m and 30 m;
-   the Radio Frequency Monitoring Antenna, mounted on a tower 22 metres above the ground, and observing at regular intervals each day on two frequency bands between 100 and 500 MHz and between 1 and 4 GHz.
-   the CODALEMA project, dedicated to the study of cosmic rays;
-   an international LOFAR station (named FR606), along with NenuFAR - a LOFAR Super Station with an extended low frequency range, capable of also operating in standalone mode;
-   one of the two experimental EMBRACE (Electronic MultiBeam Radio Astronomy ConcEpt) phased array telescopes, part of the Research and Development program for the Phase 2 of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project.[1]
