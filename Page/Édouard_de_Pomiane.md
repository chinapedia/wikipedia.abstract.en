ÉDOUARD ALEXANDRE DE POMIANE, sometimes ÉDOUARD POZERSKI (20 April 1875 in Paris – 26 January 1964 in Paris) was a French scientist, radio broadcaster and food writer.[1]

His parents emigrated from Poland in 1863, changed their name from _Pozerski_ to _de Pomiane_, and became French citizens.

De Pomiane worked as a physician at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, where he gave Félix d'Herelle a place to work on bacteriophages.

His best known works that have been translated into English are _Cooking in Ten Minutes_ and _Cooking with Pomiane_. His writing was remarkable in its time for its directness (he frequently uses a strange second-person voice, telling you—the reader—what you are seeing and smelling as you follow a recipe) and for his general disdain for upper-class elaborate French cuisine. He travelled widely and quite a few of his recipes are from abroad. His recipes often take pains to demystify cooking by explaining the chemical processes at work.
