ALPER ERTURK is the Woodruff Professor in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology.[1]


Research

Erturk leads the Smart Structures and Dynamical Systems Laboratory[2] at Georgia Tech. His publications are mostly in the areas of dynamics and vibration of smart structures and energy harvesting.[3] Erturk made fundamental contributions in the field of energy harvesting from dynamical systems. His distributed-parameter piezoelectric energy harvester models[4][5] have been widely used by several research groups. He was one of the first researchers to explore nonlinear dynamic phenomena for frequency bandwidth enhancement in energy harvesting, specifically by using a bistable Duffing oscillator with electromechanical coupling, namely the piezomagnetoelastic energy harvester.[6] His early energy harvesting work also opened new multiphysics avenues, such as the use of aeroelastic flutter to enable scalable airflow energy harvesting through piezoaeroelastic systems.[7] His recent collaborative work[8] aims to exploit flexoelectricity (strain gradient-induced polarization) for the enhancement of energy harvesting at the nanoscale.[9]

Erturk's group at Georgia Tech also contributed to smart material-based bio-inspired aquatic locomotion by developing the first untethered piezoelectric swimmer[10] as a platform to explore multiphysics fluid-electroelastic structure interactions.[11] Another multiphysics research topic recently explored by his group is acoustic-electroelastic structure interaction for wireless power transfer using ultrasound waves.[12]

Erturk and collaborators have lately been conducting research at the intersection of metamaterials and smart structures. Recently they developed the first Gradient-Index Phononic Crystal Lens-based piezoelectric energy harvester.[13] Low-frequency broadband vibration attenuation via locally-resonant finite elastic metamaterials is another research area explored by Erturk and collaborators.[14]
