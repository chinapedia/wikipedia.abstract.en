Professional wrestling career

Daga made his pro wrestling debut on April 12, 2009 in International Wrestling Revolution Group. He spent the next two years in the promotion. Also, Daga worked with other independent promotions, like Toryumon Mexico, International Wrestling League and Desastre Total Ultraviolento. On September 25, 2010, Daga won his first pro wrestling championship, the IWL Internet Championship. On December 18, 2010, Daga participated in a tournament to crown the first DTU Alto Impacto Champion, but he was defeated by Flamita.

AAA (2011–2017)

Daga made his first appearance in AAA Lucha Libre in 2011. In 2012, Daga became a regular wrestler, working with _Los Perros del Mal_ or _La Sociedad_ stables. At _Héroes Inmortales VI_, he participated in the _Copa Antonio Peña_ Royal Rumble, but was defeated by El Texano Jr.[1] At _Guerra de Titanes_, Daga won a six-way Ladder match to win the AAA World Cruiserweight Championship.[2] He retained the title for 623 days. At Rey De Reyes participated in a match for the recently created title AAA Fusion Championship, but he was defeated by Fénix.[3] At _Triplemanía XXI_, Los Perros del Mal (Daga and Psicosis) tried to win the vacant AAA World Tag Team Championship, but they failed.[4] At _Héroes Inmortales VII_ he participated in a fatal four-way for the _Copa Antonio Peña_, but was defeated by El Hijo del Fantasma.[5] At _Rey de Reyes_, Daga had his first AAA defense for the Cruiserweight title, defeating Argenis, Australian Suicide and Super Fly.[6] At _TripleMania XXII_, Daga participated in a ten-man unification match between the Cruiserweight championship and the AAA Fusion Championship (held by Fenix), which was won by El Hijo del Fantasma.[7] At _Verano de Escándalo 2015_, Daga participated in a ten-way match for the _Alas de Oro_ ("Wings of Gold"). However, he was defeated by Drago.[8] On 2015, Daga focused in the tag team division with various partners. At _Héroes Inmortales IX_, Daga and Steve Pain tried to win the AAA World Tag Team Championship from Los Perros del Mal (Pentagón Jr. and Joe Líder). However, the winners were _Los Güeros del Cielo_ (Angélico and Jack Evans).[9] On February 19, 2016, Los Perros del Mal (Daga and Taya Valkyrie) faced Pentagón Jr., one-half of the AAA World Mixed Tag Team Champions. However, Pentagon retained the title. Four days later, at _Rey de Reyes_, Los Perros del Mal (Daga and Joe Líder) faced the World Tag Team Champions Averno and Chessman and Argenis and Australian Suicide in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match. However, the champions retained the titles. At _Triplemanía XXIV_, Daga participated in a 12-man battle royal for the _Copa Triplemanía_, but was the last man eliminated from the match as rival Australian Suicide won the _Copa Triplemanía_.[10] At _Héroes Inmortales X_, Daga defeated Australian Suicide in a _Lucha de Apuestas_, hair vs mask match.[11]

During a January 21, 2017 for The Crash promotion, Daga, Pentagón Jr. and Garza Jr. all came to the ring and later confirmed that they had left AAA only one day after all appearing at AAA's 2017 _Guerra de Titanes_ show.[12] As Daga had been using that name prior to joining AAA, he was also able to continue using it afterwards.[13] The three hoped to able to use the _Perros del Mal_ name on the independent circuit, but were unable to obtain the right and on January 24, Daga announced he was leaving the group.[14] On January 27, 2017, Daga, Garza, Pentagon Jr. and Fénix el Rey announced the formation of a new stable named _La Rebelión_ ("The Rebellion").[15]

Independent circuit (2017–present)

At the end of Season 3 of Lucha Underground, Daga was seen as part of Kobra Moon's Reptile Tribe. He made his return in June 2018, during the Aztec Warfare IV. On February 5, 2019, Major League Wrestling (MLW) revealed that Daga would start appearing for their company on a regular basis starting in March 2019. He had one previous match for the promotion, against Low Ki that took place in 2018.[16] However, MLW released Daga on June.[17]
