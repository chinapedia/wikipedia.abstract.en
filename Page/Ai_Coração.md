Plagiarism accusation

The song was charged with plagiarism. Composed by Louro Santos, who confirmed to have given it to Joelma, the song was recorded by the singer Jade in December of the previous year, in album with production of Ximbinha, which revolted the fans . Through the press office, Jade complained about the repercussion: "It is an honor that talented and great singer Joelma also recorded a composition by Louro Santos, which is already part of the repertoire of singer Jade's album since July 2015, as explained. However, some fans of Joelma (a minority, it is emphasized) are distilling, in the social networks, hatred against Jade, the producer [Ximbinha] and its team, in social networks. You can not modify your playlist, which is already recorded."[2]
