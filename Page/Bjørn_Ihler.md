BJØRN MAGNUS JACOBSEN IHLER is a Norwegian peace activist and public speaker who survived the Utøya mass shooting on 22 July 2011. He is involved with the project _Extremely together_[1] through the Kofi Annan Foundation.[2]

Ihler has written editorials for _The Guardian, Huffington Post_[3] and other publications on the topic of terrorism,[4] and has participated in the Oslo Freedom Forum, where he spoke in 2016 about his experience of terrorism and his work to counter violent extremism.[5][6]

His work in countering violent extremism has led him to talk to many former members of extremist and radical groups. A BBC profile of his work has noted that "He claims the unusual and unenviable record of meeting more reformed extremists than anyone else."[7]

Ihler has said that he believes that Anders Breivik should be treated humanely by the Norwegian prison system.[8] He told BBC Radio 4 that "Breivik denied us all humanity and all human rights. But that does not ever make it right for us to deny him the same thing. If we do that, we follow the same logic as him I think.”[9]
