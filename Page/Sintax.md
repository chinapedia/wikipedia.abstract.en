SINTAX is a thrash metal & heavy metal band formed in JERUSALEM, ISRAEL[1] in 2010 as the band SHWORCHTSECHAYE disbanded. Sintax is considered a super group in the Israeli metal scene. The band has had many lineups throughout its inception as well as many variations in its style and musical approach fluctuating from punk, crossover and metal core influence into a heavy metal, NWOBHM, thrash and death metal sound, due to lineup change.
