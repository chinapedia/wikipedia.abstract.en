Critical reception

Critical reception of the film was overwhelmingly positive.[4][5][6]

David Rooney of _The Hollywood Reporter_ called the film a “lovingly assembled documentary” and stated that “Mickey and Judy would have loved it, bittersweet ending and all.”[7]

Michael Schulman of The New Yorker called it a “moving documentary” and wrote: “It’s hard now to imagine the audience members who stormed out, exasperated, during the original run, but seeing the cast members reflect on the ordeal shows how devastating it was to realize they were on a sinking ship—and that those 'gods' Sondheim and Prince were mortal after all.”[8]

Odie Anderson of the Village Voice said the film “...is sure to satisfy theater wonks, Sondheim fans, curious moviegoers and lovers of Broadway.”[9]

Jude Dry of IndieWire gave the film an “A” rating, saying “’Best Worst Thing’ is more than a story about a Broadway show; its most poignant moments examine the thrill of dreams coming true, and the inevitable come down afterwards.”[10]
