Biography

At the request of his father, he began by studying law at the University of Bonn, but switched to the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in 1829, where he studied art with Rudolf Wiegmann instead. His early works were mostly religious in nature.[1]

In addition to painting, he worked as an art critic; providing reviews for numerous local and foreign publications. In 1842, he moved to Neuwied, where he served as a tutor for Prince Maximilian.[2] Over the next few years, he produced historical paintings and created frescoes for the Elberfeld Town Hall (now the Von der Heydt Museum).

During the Revolution, he served as a Deputy Commander of the Bürgerwehr (Vigilance committee). When his cousin, , resigned, he was promoted to Commander.[3]

From 1847 to 1849, he was Chief Editor of the __, a satirical monthly. Then, after a brief stay in Berlin, he settled permanently in Leipzig sometime in the early 1850s. While there, he served as an editor at the _Familien-Journal_.[4] Later, he produced "Germania at Watch by the Sea", but it never became as popular as the original.
