The _HERO SYSTEM_ is a generic role-playing game system that was developed from the superhero RPG _Champions_. After _Champions_ fourth edition was released in 1989, a stripped-down version of its ruleset with no superhero or other genre elements was released as _The Hero System Rulesbook_ in 1990. As a spinoff of _Champions_, the _Hero System_ is considered to have started with 4th edition (as it is mechanically identical to _Champions_ 4th edition), rather than on its own with a 1st edition. However, the first three editions of the game are typically referred to as _Champions_, rather than the Hero System, as the game for its first three editions was not sold as a universal toolkit, instead largely focusing on superheroes.

The _Hero System_ is used as the underlying mechanics of other Hero Games role-playing games such as _Fantasy Hero_, _Star Hero_, and _Pulp Hero_. It is characterized by point-based character creation and the rigor with which it measures character abilities. It uses only six-sided dice.


System features

The _Hero System_ uses _Champions_' key system features. Tasks are resolved using three six-sided dice and power effects (especially damage) are resolved by rolling a number of dice based on the power's strength.

Like _Champions_, it uses a tool-kit approach to creating effects. While the system does have more typical features of many RPGs, such as a skill system, most abilities in the _Hero System_ rules are listed as generic "powers". Most powers are meant to be able to model a vast number of potential effects. When creating a character, a player decides on what effect they wish to create, then constructs this effect by consulting the powers in the rulebook. Most powers have a set of modifiers that alter their base performance to more finely-tune their representation of the effect desired. Each such modifier makes the power more or less capable, and correspondingly more or less expensive to purchase with character points (the "currency" used to buy powers; see the section following). The result is that many effects are possible from exactly the same base power. For example, while systems such as Dungeons & Dragons would list a wide variety of separate ranged attack powers that deal damage (such as a fireball, a lightning bolt, an acid spray, a magic missile, and dozens more), the vast majority of such effects in the _Hero System_ would be constructed out of the same base two powers, "Blast" or "Killing Attack".

The _Hero System_ rules only define an ability's very basic mechanical effects—the player is the one who defines what the ability looks like when used. For example, if a player wishes to model the ability to project a jet of fire, they could choose the "Blast" power. However, the power's text has no mention of what it looks like or how it operates beyond some very base notes concerning damage and range. To make it a jet of fire, the player simply states that this Blast is a jet of fire. To some degree this is simply cosmetic. However, in the game, that power now is treated as a fire attack, with all that implies as decided by the gamemaster in each situation: it has the possibility of starting secondary fires; it looks, smells and sounds like a jet of fire; will not work in water; will terrify people with a phobia of fire; etc. The system does have mechanical effect alterations as well: a Blast could be altered by any number of power modifiers such as "Explosion", "Area of Effect", "Megascale", etc.: both advantages and disadvantages are available. As players are typically attempting to model something with at least a partial real-life analogue, limitations on a power are as much about making it more accurate a representation as they are making it less expensive to purchase (for example, to model a firearm, the limitation that it requires ammunition is expected, regardless of the fact that this happens to make a firearm cost fewer character points). The system also allows players to construct very exacting modifiers not specifically detailed in the base rules. For example, a player could define one or more powers as not working when the moon is full, or when it is Tuesday, or any other limitation that the player can imagine and the gamemaster feels is applicable.

Also like _Champions_, the _Hero System_ uses a point-based system for character creation. Instead of templates which define what a character is, how it performs mechanically, and the new abilities gained after a certain amount of play, a player is given a fixed number of points and allowed to create what they want. As this is a much more freeform process than in most games, the system encourages close involvement between players and gamemasters to ensure that all participants have the same understanding regarding the type of effects permitted, relative power levels, and the like.

Character creation

Each player creates his character starting with a pool of points to buy abilities (such as the aforementioned "Energy Blast" and "Armor"), increase characteristics (such as "Strength" and "Intelligence") and buy skills (such as "Computer Programming" and "Combat Driving"). This pool can be increased by taking disadvantages for your character (such as being hunted by an enemy, a dependency of some sort or having people who depend on your character in some way). The initial pool, as well as the final pool size, is determined by the Game Master (GM), as well as the point limits on each individual ability.

Unlike the d20 System and many other game systems, experience awards are in the form of character points, which have the same value as those used in character creation and can be applied directly to the character's abilities upon receipt.

Powers

The powers system are the variables players can manipulate in the characters of Hero System. The powers in the Hero System are categorized roughly as follows:

:*ADJUSTMENT POWERS — Modify the Characteristics of self or another.

:*ATTACK POWERS — Inflict physical damage or some other negative effect on an opponent.

:*BODY-AFFECTING POWERS — Change shape, size, density, etc.

:*DEFENSE POWERS — Protect against an attack or mishap.

:*MENTAL POWERS — Detect and/or affect the mind of another.

:*MOVEMENT POWERS — Employ various forms of movement.

:*SENSE-AFFECTING POWERS — Alter or hinder a character's senses.

:*SENSORY POWERS — Improve or expand upon the sensory abilities.

:*SIZE POWERS — Growth and Shrinking.

:*SPECIAL POWERS — Powers with some unusual quality, including ones that do not fall into the other categories.

:*STANDARD POWERS — A "catch-all" for Powers that are not Adjustment, Mental, Movement, Size, or Special Powers.

Within each of these categories are multiple Powers that have more specialized effects. Thus for the movement category there are powers that can be used for Running, Swimming, Climbing, Leaping, Gliding, Flying, Tunneling through solid surfaces, and even Teleportation. For certain game genres there are even powers for traveling to other dimensions or moving faster than light.

Also, many Powers appear in at least two categories. For example, most Attack Powers are also Standard Powers, and Size Powers are basically just a subcategory of Body-Affecting Powers. Darkness is in three categories — Standard, Attack, and Sense-Affecting.

Point Cost

Each power has a base point cost for a given effect. This could be, for example, a certain number of points per six-sided-die (or "d6") of damage inflicted upon a foe.

Powers can have both advantages and limitations. Both are modifiers applied at different stages in calculating cost. These modifiers are typically changes of ±¼, but can range up to ±2 or even higher.

After the base cost is calculated, advantages are applied. These, which can make a power more useful, typically expand its effectiveness or make it more powerful, and thus make it more expensive. Once advantages are applied, the base cost becomes the Active Cost.

The Active Cost is calculated as an intermediate step as it is required to calculate certain figures, such as range, END usage, difficulty of activation rolls, and other things.

The formula for calculating the Active Cost is:

    ACTIVE COST = BASE COST × (1 + _Advantages_)

Once Active Cost is calculated, limitations are applied. These represent shortcomings in the power, lessened reliability or situations in which the power can not be used. Limitations are added separately as positive numbers, even though they are listed as negative.

The Real Cost of the power is then determined by:

    REAL COST = ACTIVE COST / (1 + _Limitations_)

The Real Cost is the amount the character must actually pay for the Power.

Power Frameworks

The rules also include schemes for providing a larger number of powers to a character for a given cost. These power frameworks reduce the cost either by requiring the group of powers to have a common theme as in an Elemental Control Framework, or by limiting the number of powers that can be active at one time with a Multipower Framework. Powers within a framework can share common limitations, further reducing the cost. A third type of power framework, the Variable Power Pool (VPP), trades thrift for flexibility. With it, powers can be arbitrarily chosen on the fly, granting enhanced in-game flexibility. The price is a premium on points, called the Control Cost. Additionally, it is marked as potentially unbalancing, so not all GMs will permit VPP's.

Elemental Controls were eliminated in the Sixth Edition.


Publishing history

Although several games based on what would become known as the _Hero System_ were published in the 1980s, including _Champions_, _Danger International_, _Justice, Inc._, _Robot Warriors_ and the original versions of _Fantasy Hero_ and _Star Hero_, each of the RPGs was self-contained, much as Chaosium's Basic Role-Playing games are. The _Hero System_ itself was not released as an independent entity until 1990, as Steve Jackson Games' _GURPS_ (_Generic Universal Roleplaying System_) became more popular. As a joint venture between Hero Games and Iron Crown Enterprises, a stand-alone _Hero System Rulebook_ was published alongside the fourth edition of Champions. The content was identical to the opening sections of the Champions rules, but all genre-related material was removed. Afterward, genre books such as _Ninja Hero_ (written by Aaron Allston) and _Fantasy Hero_ were published as sourcebooks for the _Hero System Rulebook_ as opposed to being independent games.

With the collapse of the Hero-ICE alliance, the _Hero System_ went into limbo for several years. The _Champions_ franchise released a new version under the Fuzion system, which had been a joint development with R. Talsorian Games, called _Champions: the New Millennium_. Although two editions were published, it was very poorly received by _Champions_ fans. In 2001, a reconstituted Hero Games was formed under the leadership of Steven S. Long, who had written several books for the earlier version of the system. It regained the rights to the _Hero System_ and to the _Champions_ trademark.

In 2001, the Fifth Edition of the _Hero System Rulebook_ was released, incorporating heavy revisions by Long. A large black hardcover, it was critically well received and attained a degree of commercial success. (Following problems with fragile bindings on Fourth Edition rulebooks, the planned binding for the larger Fifth Edition was tested using a clothes dryer.[1]) The Fifth Edition is often referred to as "FREd", which is a backronym for "Fifth Rules Edition". The name actually comes from Steve S. Long's reply when asked what the standard abbreviation for the Fifth Edition would be: "I don't care if you call it 'Fred', as long as you buy it." This was made the unofficial nickname by several replies on the same board affirming it after a reply from Willpower, who coined the backronym by saying, "OK. FREd it is, "Fifth Rules Edition"!"

A revised version () was issued in 2004, along with _Hero System Sidekick_, a condensed version of the rulebook with a cover price of under $10. Fans often call the revised Fifth Edition "Fiver," ReFREd," or "5ER" (from "Fifth Edition revised"; "Fiver" also alludes to _Watership Down_). This rulebook is so big (592 pages) that some fans speculated that it might be bulletproof, and it did indeed stop some bullets when tested by Hero Games staffers.[2][3]

On February 28, 2008, Cryptic Studios purchased the _Champions_ intellectual property, and sold the rights back to Hero Games to publish the 6th edition books. One of the new features will be to allow players to adapt their _Champions Online_ characters to the pen-and-paper game.[4]

On 28 November 2011, Hero Games announced a restructuring, with Darren Watts and long-time developer Steven S. Long relinquishing their full-time statuses to work freelance. In late 2012 _Champions Complete_ was released, which contained all of the core 6th edition rules as well as enough information to play a superhero campaign in a single 240-page book. This compact presentation reflected criticism that the 6th edition rules had become too unwieldy.

Computer Release

"Heromaker", an MS-DOS program, was distributed with some versions of Champions. Today, "Hero Designer"[5] for the Fifth and Sixth Editions is available on several platforms, and is supported by numerous character packs and other extensions linked to Hero Games book releases. In late 2008, Hero released a licensed RPG for Aaron Williams's popular comic PS238 using a simplified version of the Fifth Edition rules.

In late 2009, Hero Games released the 6th Edition of the Hero System. The game has so far had a mostly positive reception, with little in the way of 'Edition Wars'. The largest rules change was the removal of Figured Characteristics (meaning that character stats that were previously linked intrinsically—such as Speed automatically increasing when sufficient amounts of Dexterity were purchased—were no longer connected, and instead bought entirely separately). Other, more minor rules changes include folding Armor and Force field into Resistant Defense and reestablishing Regeneration as a separate power. The rules were released in two volumes, with the first covering character creation in depth and the second describing campaigns and the running of games. The new genre book for Champions came out shortly thereafter, and a new _Fantasy Hero_ was released in the summer of 2010. A new version of Sidekick was released in late 2009 under the title _The Hero System Basic Rulebook_, while an _Advanced Player Guide_ was published that had additional options for character creation. Other recent releases included a large book of pre-constructed Powers, a set of pre-generated Martial Arts styles, abilities and skills, a large bestiary, a new grimoire for Fantasy Hero and a three-volume set of villains for _Champions_. A new edition of _Star Hero_ was released in 2011, along with a second _Advanced Player Guide_.

Hero Games now maintains an irregular release schedule, with a minimal staff, and has successfully used Kickstarter to raise funds for new projects. One of these new products, _Fantasy Hero Complete_, was released in early 2015.
