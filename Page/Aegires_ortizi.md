The specific name _ortizi_ is in honour of Dr. Manuel Ortiz from the Center for Marine Research, University of Havana.[1]


Distribution

The distribution of _Aegires ortizi_ includes the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas, Venezuela, Cuba and Panama.[2]


Description

The body is elongate.[3] The tubercles are large, varying from conical to mushroom-shaped, with flat tops in some individuals.[4] Gill leaves forming a semicircle on the posterior portion of the dorsum.[5] The background color is usually mottled white, sometimes with noticeable brown spots.[6] It can be up to 8 mm long.[7][8]


Ecology

Minimum recorded depth is 2 m.[9] Maximum recorded depth is 5 m.[10]

A single specimen was found on cyanobacteria over coral rubble and sand patches in the Bocas del Toro Archipelago, Panama.[11] In the Bahamas, this species has been found on algae of the genera _Cladophora_ and _Sargassum_.[12]
