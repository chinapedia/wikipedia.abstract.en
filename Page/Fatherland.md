It can be viewed as a nationalist concept, in so far as it is evocative of emotions related to family ties and links them to national identity and patriotism, but in the English language it can also simply mean the country of one's birth or origin. It can be compared to motherland and homeland, and some languages will use more than one of these terms. [1] The national anthem of the Netherlands between 1815 and 1932, "Wien Neêrlands Bloed", makes extensive use of the parallel Dutch word, as does the current Dutch national anthem, Het Wilhelmus.

The Ancient Greek _patris_, fatherland, led to _patrios_, _of our fathers_ and thence to the Latin _patriota_ and Old French _patriote_, meaning compatriot; from these the English word patriotism is derived. The related Ancient Roman word _Patria_ led to similar forms in modern Romance languages.

"Fatherland" was first encountered by the vast majority of citizens in countries that did not themselves use it during World War II, when it was featured in news reports associated with Nazi Germany.[2][3] German government propaganda used its appeal to nationalism when making references to Germany and the state.[4][5] It was used in _Mein Kampf_,[6] and on a sign in a German concentration camp, also signed, Adolf Hitler.[7] As such, the word "Vaterland" could be connected with National Socialism outside Germany; in Germany, this is not the case.
