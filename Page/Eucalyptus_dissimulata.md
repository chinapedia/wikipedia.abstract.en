_EUCALYPTUS DISSIMULATA_, commonly known as the RED-CAPPED MALLEE,[1] is a species of mallee that is endemic to Western Australia. It has smooth greyish bark that is shed in strips, glossy green, narrow elliptic to narrow lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, creamy white flowers and short cylindrical to stubby barrel-shaped fruit.


Description

_Eucalyptus dissimulata_ is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth light grey to greenish brown bark that is shed in strips. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile leaves arranged in opposite pairs and long and wide. Adult leaves are glossy green, arranged alternately, narrow elliptic to narrow lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven, nine or eleven, the groups on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to diamond shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum long. Flowering occurs between October and March and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, shortly cylindrical or stubby barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed below the rim. The seeds are brown-grey and a flattened oval shape.[2][3][4]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus dissimulata_ was first formally described by the botanist Ian Brooker in 1988 in the journal _Nuytsia_ from a specimen he collected in 1984 about north of Needilup.[5][6] The specific epithet (_dissimulata_) is a Latin word meaning "pretending", referring to the superficial similarity of this species to _E. albida_.[7]

This species is part of the _Eucalyptus_ subgenus _Symphyomyrtus_ in the section _Bisectae_ and the subsection _Destitutae_.


Distribution and habitat

Red-capped mallee is found on sand-plains and near creeks, along a narrow, near-coastal strip in the Wheatbelt and Goldfields-Esperance regions between Corrigin and Munglinup where it grows in sandy-loamy soils.[8][9]


Conservation status

_Eucalyptus dissimulata_ is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[10]
