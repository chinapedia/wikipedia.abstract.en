Early life and education

Butcher grew up outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[2] She received her BA from Gettysburg College[3] and her MFA from the University of Iowa's Nonfiction Writing Program.[4]


Career

Butcher's debut memoir, _Visiting Hours: A Memoir of Friendship and Murder_,[5] was published in April 2015 by Penguin-Random House imprint Blue Rider Press. It recounts her struggle to reconcile her friendship with her college friend Kevin Schaeffer, who violently murdered his girlfriend after a psychotic break.[6][7] The book was featured on NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday with Rachel Martin,[8] WAMC's The Roundtable,[9] and _Poets & Writers Magazine_.[10] The _New York Times Sunday Review of Books_ said that "at the heart of this story, beyond Butcher's search to understand the incomprehensible, lies our societal failure to recognize serious depression as the potentially fatal illness that it is..." and that "her research offers a tragic portrait of the turn of events that left one young woman dead and another forever changed."[11] Her second book, _Mothertrucker,_ is forthcoming from Amazon Publishing literary press Little A Books in 2021.[12]

Butcher's March 2016 opinion piece, "Emoji Feminism",[13] published in _The Times Sunday Review_,[14] was cited by Google as the inspiration for thirteen new professional female-empowered emojis,[15][16][17] accepted in July 2016 by the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee and released in December 2016.[18] In August 2017, these emojis were nominated as Design of the Year by the Design Museum in London,[19] where they are on display alongside a hijab designed by Nike, Wolfgang Tillmansâ€™ Remain Campaign for the Brexit referendum and items from Kanye West's clothing line, among other artifacts.[20]

Butcher's essays have been published in _Granta_,[21] _The New York Times_,[22] _The Washington Post_,[23] _Harper's Magazine_,[24] _The Paris Review_,[25] _Literary Hub_,[26] _The Kenyon Review_,[27] _The Iowa Review_,[28] _The American Scholar_,[29] _Salon_[30] and _Guernica_.[31] Her May 2018 essay, "Women These Days," was listed as a "Best of 2018" essay by _Entropy Magazine_[32] and nominated for a Pushcart Prize and for inclusion in the _Best American Essays_[33] series by the editors at _Brevity Magazine._ Her February 2018 _Lit Hub_ essay "MIA: The Liberal Men We Love" was featured in Rebecca Traister's book[34] _Good And Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women's Anger_.[35] Her December 2018 essay, "Flight Path," was awarded grand prize in _Sonora Review_s 2018 flash prose contest[36] as judged by Nicole Walker. Of the essay, Walker writes, "Referencing cultural touchstones as diverse W.H. Auden and Jeopardy, this piece stacks everything we thought we knew about Icarus and Daedalus and then piles more on. The images of the would-be immigrants tucked into the wheelhouses of airplanes makes those thick stories immediate. Too immediate and hard to hear, but necessary. The final stark image of not wax but metal becomes a hot, stark mirror."[37]

Additional essays have been anthologized in _The Best Travel Writing 2016_,[38] _The Soul Of A Great Traveler_,[39] _Beautiful Flesh: A Body of Essays_,[40] _Writing True: The Art and Craft of Creative Nonfiction_[41] and _The Best Of Vela_.[42]
