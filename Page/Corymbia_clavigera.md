The tree typically grows to a height of and can form a lignotuber. It has smooth white to pale grey over nearly all of the trunk, sometimes with a partially thin, rough and irregularly flaky-tessellated at the base of the trunk. The dull, concolorous green adult leaves are alternately arranged. The leaf blade has a lanceolate or elliptical shape with a length of and a width of with a pointed apex and the base tapering to the petiole.[2] It produces white flowers in September and October.[3] The axillary compound inflorescence forms groups of three or seven buds per umbel. The smooth mature buds have an obovoid to pyriform shape and are in length and with a shallowly rounded operculum. The pedicellate fruits that form later are urceolate to barrel-shaped with alength of and a width of with a descending disc and three enclosed valves.[4]


Taxonomy

The species was first formally described by the botanist Johannes Conrad Schauer as _Eucalyptus clavigera_ in 1843 as part of Wilhelm Gerhard Walpers work _Repertorium Botanices Systematicae_. It was reclassified as _Corymbia watsoniana_ in 1995 by Kenneth Hill and Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson in 1995 as part of the work _Systematic studies in the eucalypts. A revision of the bloodwoods, genus Corymbia (Myrtaceae)_ as published in the journal _Telopea_.[5]


Distribution

The tree is only found in coastal area of the Kimberley region of Western Australia.[6] The type specimen was collected at Careening Bay in 1820 by Alan Cunningham during the voyage of and collected there again in 1984 by Kevin Kenneally in an area he described as "on basalt slope behind the beach". It is also likely to be growing on nearby off-shore islands and areas of the Carson River volcanics between Port Warrender and the Mitchell Plateau.[7]
