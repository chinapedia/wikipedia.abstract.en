_MOSES THE LAWGIVER_ (1975) is a novel by Australian writer Thomas Keneally.[1] The novel is based on the British television series "Moses the Lawgiver", for which Anthony Burgess wrote the script.[2]


Story outline

The novel follows the story of the biblical figure Moses who found the Ten Commandments and parted the Red Sea.


Critical reception

In her review of the book in _The Australian Women's Weekly_ Nicola Worsley concluded: "I will admit to being beguiled by the whole publication. Thomas Keneally, with a novelist's imagination and insight, has taken familiar and unfamiliar aspects of Moses' life to bring to interesting reality this dramatic tale."[3]
