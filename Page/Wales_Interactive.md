History

The company was formed in 2012 by co-founders David Banner and Richard Pring. Both founders previously co-managed GamesLab Wales together under University of Glamorgan (now University of South Wales).[4] David Banner, a former employee of Pivotal Games and Eidos Interactive, also founded the Wales Games Development Show.[5] Wales Interactive was formed with an aim to create original games that entertain the world as well as put Wales on the video games map.[6] The studio began and remains as a tenant of the Sony UK Technology Centre in Pencoed, Bridgend.[7][8]

Most of Wales Interactive's early work consisted of mobile apps and games as well as a series of Welsh e-books which were supported by S4C's digital fund.[9] In 2013, they shifted development to focus on PC and consoles with their title, _Gravity Badgers_, and the psychological horror, _Master Reboot_.[10][11][12] The development team then released _Infinity Runner_ with Oculus Rift support, a first for the company. _Infinity Runner_ went on to being the first ever PlayStation 4 and Xbox One game to be made entirely in Wales.[13][14] The studio gained a major publication feature in a studio profile for Edge (magazine) which coincided with the Early access development stages of their Science fiction Adventure game, Soul Axiom.[15][16]

In 2015, Wales Interactive established their third-party publishing label. They partnered with UK independent developers, Milky Tea, to bring their title, _Coffin Dodgers_, to Xbox One and PlayStation 4.[17] Since then, the studio continues to develop their label by co-developing and publishing the FMV horror video game, The Bunker.[18][19]
