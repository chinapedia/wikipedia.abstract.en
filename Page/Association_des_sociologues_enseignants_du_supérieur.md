L'ASSOCIATION DES SOCIOLOGUES ENSEIGNANTS DU SUPÉRIEUR (ASES) is a French association organised on January 11, 1989 by two French sociologists, Catherine and Pierre Paradeise Tripier, to ensure "the defense and promotion of sociology in higher education".[1] Its articles of association were published on May 26, 1989.

ASES serves as a forum for reflection on teaching and research in sociology and demography, as well as academic hiring and career development in these disciplines. In 2001, it participated in organizing debates and a petition against the awarding of a thesis to Élizabeth Teissier. In 2009, it participated in the protest against the self-promotions to professorship within section 19 of the Conseil National des Universités (CNU).

Its past presidents were all French sociologists: Catherine Paradeise, Pierre Tripier, Maryse Tripier, Bruno Péquignot, Philippe Cibois, Daniel Filâtre, Régine Bercot and Charles Gadéa.[2]
