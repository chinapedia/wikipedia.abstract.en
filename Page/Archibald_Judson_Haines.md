ARCHIBALD JUDSON HAINES (October 13, 1878 â€“ September 24, 1950) was a winery owner, fruit grower and politician in Ontario, Canada. He represented Lincoln in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1937 to 1942 as a Liberal.[1][2]

The son of Webster George Haines and Sarah Elizabeth Laws, he was born in Jordan and was educated there and in St. Catharines. Haines served on the Niagara Parks Commission[3] and as chair of the Rainbow Bridge commission. In 1920, he was one of two founders of the Jordan Winery. Haines married Lucetta Overholt.[4]

He resigned from the Ontario assembly in August 1941 to protest the granting of a license to sell beer and wine to a St. Catharines hotel adjoining the local arena. The Liquor Control Board of Ontario had given a written guarantee to the city that no license would be granted to that establishment.[5]

Haines died in Wellesley Hospital at the age of 72 after an extended illness.[6]
