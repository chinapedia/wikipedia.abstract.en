_PHRYNE BEFORE THE AREOPAGUS_ () is an 1861 painting by the French artist Jean-Léon Gérôme. The subject matter is Phryne, a legendary courtesan in ancient Greece who was put on trial for impiety. Phryne was acquitted after her defender Hypereides removed her robe and exposed her naked bosom to the jury.[1]

The painting was exhibited at the 1861 Salon.[2] It is kept at the Kunsthalle Hamburg in Germany.


Legacy

Bernhard Gillam made a famous caricature drawing in 1884, titled _Phryne before the Chicago tribunal_, where Phryne is replaced by the Republican Party presidential candidate James G. Blaine and Hypereides by the newspaper editor Whitelaw Reid.[3]
