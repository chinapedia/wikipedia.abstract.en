Reception

_The Dog Who Had Kittens_ has been reviewed by _Books for Keeps_ that wrote "A really good book: it doesn't duck the issues, the animals remain true to their likely characteristics and we're left with wry smiles on our faces."[1] and _Kirkus Reviews_ called it "Good fun."[2]

_Booklist_ found it "An amusing combination of text and art, especially appealing for children who know and love dogs."[3] and the _School Library Journal_ wrote "The story .. is fairly long and often descriptive, but the unusual situation and large pictures should sustain the attention of older preschoolers and will definitely appeal to primary-grade children."[4]

It has also been recommended by public libraries,[5]
