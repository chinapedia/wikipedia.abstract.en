Bautista signed with the Washington Nationals as an international free agent in January 2012.[1] He began his professional career in 2012 with the rookie-league-level Dominican Summer League Nationals in the Dominican Summer League,[2] where he batted .329 with 25 runs batted in (RBIS) and 47 stolen bases.[3] In 2013 he played in the rookie-league-level Gulf Coast League for the Gulf Coast League Nationals,[4] who that year finished their regular season with a record of 49-9, giving them the highest winning percentage (.845) for a full regular season ever achieved by a minor-league baseball team based in the United States.[5] The team then won all three of its playoff games, defeating the Gulf Coast League Pirates in a single-game semifinal playoff and sweeping the Gulf Coast League Red Sox in the best-of-three league championship series, to become the 2013 Gulf Coast League champions.[6][7] Bautista appeared in 52 games during the championship season, batting .322 with one home run, 27 RBIs, and 26 stolen bases.[8]

Bautista spent 2014 with the Class A Hagerstown Suns in the South Atlantic League,[9] hitting .290 with five home runs, 54 RBIs, and 69 stolen bases.[10] He split 2015 between the Class A Advanced Potomac Nationals in the Carolina League, the Class A Short Season Auburn Doubledays in the New York-Penn League, and the Gulf Coast League Nationals,[11], batting a combined .275 for the year with a home run, 14 RBIs, and 26 stolen bases,[12] and over the 2015-2016 offseason played in the Dominican Winter League with Leones del Escogido.[13] He advanced to the Class AA Harrisburg Senators in the Eastern League for the 2016 season,[14] hitting .282 with four home runs, 39 RBIs, and 56 stolen bases, and after that season the Washington Nationals added him to their 40-man roster.[15] He again played winter ball with Leones del Escogido during the 2016-2017 offseason.[16]

2017

Bautista began the 2017 season with the Class AAA Syracuse Chiefs in the International League.[17] The Washington Nationals promoted him to the major leagues on April 29, 2017.[18] He made his major league debut on April 30 in a 23-5 Nationals victory over the New York Mets at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., batting twice and going 0-for-2 against Mets catcher Kevin Plawecki, who was making his first-ever major league appearance as a pitcher.[19] On May 6, in a 6–2 Nationals victory over the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, he made his first career major-league start, playing right field, and got his first career major-league hit, a single through the infield off Phillies pitcher Vince Velasquez.[20] The Nationals optioned Bautista back to Syracuse on May 8.[21]

The Nationals recalled Bautista on August 27,[22] but optioned him back to Syracuse the next day.[23] They called him back up again on September 7,[24] and he finished the regular season with the Nationals. He completed the season having played in 17 major-league games, batting .160 with four hits – all singles – in 25 at-bats, scoring two runs, and with a slugging percentage of .160 and an on-base percentage of .222.[25]

In the minor leagues, Bautista played 43 games for Syracuse and 13 for the Gulf Coast League Nationals during 2017.[26] He hit a combined .259 for the two teams, with 14 RBIs and nine stolen bases.[27]

2018

Bautista participated in 2018 major-league spring training before the Nationals optioned him to the Class AAA Syracuse Chiefs on March 14.[28] He was reassigned to the Class AA Harrisburg Senators on April 2[29] and began the season with them, but was promoted back to Syracuse on April 12.[30] He had made 45 plate appearances for Syracuse, batting .429 with a .966 on-base-plus-slugging percentage (OPS)[31] when, on April 24, the Nationals called him up to the major leagues.[32] He appeared in nine games, usually as a late-game replacement or a pinch-runner, made one start, and went 0-for-6, striking out once and scoring a run[33][34] before the Nationals optioned him back to Syracuse on May 7 to make room on their 25-man roster when they activated right-handed relief pitcher Shawn Kelley from the 10-day disabled list.[35] Bautista made another 46 plate appearances for Syracuse, batting .300 with a .749 OPS,[36] before colliding with another player during a game against the Rochester Red Wings at Rochester, New York, on May 17, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament, lateral collateral ligament, and meniscus in his left knee.[37] The injury required season-ending surgery.[38] He ended his season with an overall .303 batting average in the minor leagues, with three doubles, a triple, a home run, seven RBIs, and six stolen bases in the minors for the year.[39] On June 9, the Nationals released Bautista to make room for Adam Eaton on their roster when they activated Eaton from the 60-day disabled list.[40] On June 13, Washington re-signed Bautista to a minor league deal.[41]
