DR. LINDA SUSAN ARANAYDO(born 1948) is an award-winning Native American physician.[1] Recognizing the health issues related to her Muscogee Indian Tribe, as a single mother of two she decided to get a B.A. in social sciences at University of California, Berkley, and later an M.D. at the University of California, San Francisco. After earning her M.D., she worked in a variety of careers, from being a provider at Native American clinics, providing technical assistance to Native American clinics, direct, individual teaching services to Indian clinics.[2]

Dr. Aranaydo's work to help her Native American community avoid preventable diseases earned her the David Vanderryn Award for Outstanding Community Service as a Family Physician in 1995. She has served on several councils and boards, including the Governor's Task Force on Early Childhood Education in 1977, the California State American Indian Education Council from 1978 to 1980, and is the current Director of Medical Services for the California Rural Indian Health Board.[3]
