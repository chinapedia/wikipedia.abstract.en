Overall it is unbeatable to ASC Diaraf's 54 goals scored in a season and their 72 points made in 2003-04 season, Génération Foot's records are one of the highest in Senegalese top flight football competition, but the highest in the professional Ligue 1. Niane was the best scorer for the season scoring a record number of 19 goals.[2] Last two positions were ASC Linguère and US Gorée who was last year's champion, Gorée was relegated.
