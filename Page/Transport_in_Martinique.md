Road transport

As of 2000, Martinique had 2,105 km of paved highways.

There is a part of the N5 road that has been upgraded as a MOTORWAY, running from the capital Fort-de-France through Lamentin, Ducos and Rivière Salée until Les Coteaux.

Rail transport

Train-des-plantations.jpg]] Martininique has now⁽²⁰¹⁸⁾ only one railway line in operation: The little-known 2.5 km long Le Train des Plantations is a heritage railway that runs from the Rhum Museum in Sainte-Marie through some sugarcane and banana plantations over two Bailey bridges to the Banana Museum.

In former times several narrow gauge sugarcane railways existed.[1] Saint-Pierre had horse-drawn trams, which had an unusally narrow gauge. At least two steam locomotives are preserved in an optically refurbished condition, but not operational.


Sea transport

There are harbours at Fort-de-France and La Trinité.


Air transport

It has three airports,[2] the main one being Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport. See List of Airports in Martinique.
