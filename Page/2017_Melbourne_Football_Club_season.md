Fixture summary

After having a _home_ game at Etihad Stadium every season since 2011, the club didn't have to play a _home_ match at Etihad in 2017, which drew pleasure from both the club and fans alike.[8][9] The team played its first seven matches in Victoria and then travelled to Adelaide to play at Adelaide Oval in round eight;[10] the final three matches of the season were played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against non-finalists in 2016.[11] The club again hosted in the annual Queen's Birthday clash in round twelve and played in the Anzac Day eve match in round five;[12] due to an ongoing sponsorship with Tourism NT, the club hosted two matches in the Northern Territory, the first was against at TIO Traeger Park in round ten and the second was at TIO Stadium against in round seventeen.[13] The club played its first Friday night match since the 2015 season and the second in total since the 2012 season, when they hosted at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in round fifteen.[14] The club had the equal-most six day breaks with eight in total, including two back-to-back from rounds thirteen to fifteen.[15]

In addition to the Friday night match, the club played eleven Saturday matches (five afternoons, three twilights, and three nights), eight Sunday matches (all afternoon matches) and two Monday matches (one afternoon and one night).[16] Nine matches were broadcast on free-to-air on the Seven Network and thirteen were broadcast on pay TV on Fox Footy.[17] The teams the club played twice were Adelaide, , Collingwood, and , with Adelaide and North Melbourne the only teams finishing in the top eight in 2016.[18] With the off-season recruitment of player, Jordan Lewis, both _AFL Media_ and the _Herald Sun_ noted the round seven match against Hawthorn as the "match to watch" for Melbourne's season.[19][20] Analysis by _Champion Data_ ranked the fixture difficulty as the eighth hardest out of the eighteen teams.[21]
