Over the last few decades, transgender individuals have been able to obtain elected and appointed political office in many parts of the world. Transgender individuals have different life experiences and thus policy goals, ranging from access to restrooms and health care, to protection from discrimination and violence. Because of this, the election and appointment of transgender officials can potentially change discriminating legislation.[1] As of 2018, only 16 openly transgender individuals have been elected to office in the United States.[2] A few transgender individuals who have been elected, were not open about their gender identity, and were later outed.
