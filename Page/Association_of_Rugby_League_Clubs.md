The ASSOCIATION OF RUGBY LEAGUE CLUBS (Russian: _Ассоциация Регбилиг Клубов_) is the governing body for rugby league in Russia. The association was formed in 2010, bringing together amateur clubs and regional RRLF clubs after the expulsion of the Russian Rugby League Federation and essentially rugby league itself by the Order of the Ministry of Tourism RUSSIA № 21 from State Register of Sports of Russia.


History

After the turmoil of the RRLF losing clubs and players after "the crisis of 2009-2010", Edward Taturian split from the previous body and formed the "Association of Rugby League Clubs" (ARLC). After no clear framework or competition was introduced by the RRLF in 2010, the ARLC conducted regional league of "North-West", "Center" and "South" all originally consisting of 6 teams each. The following year it was inducted into the "SNNVS Russia" and followed with becoming a full-member of the Rugby League European Federation on the 22 February 2013 and the Rugby League International Federation on the 8 August 2013 after years of progress.
