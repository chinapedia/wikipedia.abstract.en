HAROLD R. JOHNSON is a Canadian lawyer and writer, whose book _Firewater: How Alcohol Is Killing My People (And Yours)_ was a shortlisted nominee for the Governor General's Award for English-language non-fiction at the 2016 Governor General's Awards.[1] The book, an examination of the problem with alcohol consumption among Canadian First Nations, draws on Johnson's work as a Crown prosecutor in northern Saskatchewan.[2]

Johnson told CBC Radio interviewer Shelagh Rogers in 2016 that his father was a Swedish immigrant and his mother a Cree aboriginal in Saskatchewan, where he was born. He enlisted in the Royal Canadian Navy and worked as a logger, trapper and miner before going to university as an adult, completing his education in law with an MA at Harvard. [3]
