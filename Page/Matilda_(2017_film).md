Reception

The film received mixed reviews in Russian media.[3] Yury Grymov and Stas Tyrkin from Komsomolskaya Pravda differed in their opinion; Grymow criticized the film, citing the muddled nature of the picture,[4] while Tyrkin gave a positive review.[5]

Egor Belikov from Time Out and Andrey Piskov from The Hollywood Reporter described the film as an overblown melodrama.[6][7]

Meduza's Anton Dolin praised the film; he complimented the fairy-tale like atmosphere, cinematography, sets and costumes.[8]


Controversy

In 2016 when the official trailer of the film which contained in particular erotic love scenes was released,[9] representatives of the public movement "King's Cross" found in the upcoming film a "distortion of historical events", and an "anti-Russian and anti-religious provocation in the field of culture". One cinema chain pulled out of showing the film after a group of self-described Orthodox militants threatened the film’s director and cinemas preparing to screen it.[10]

After a request to the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation State from the Duma deputy Natalia Poklonskaya known for her veneration of Nicholas II,[11] the film's material was audited and no violations were found.[12] Chairman of the Duma committee on culture, film director Stanislav Govoruhin criticized the idea of checking the film, he expressed confidence that such scandalous initiatives should be "nipped right in the bud." In the Kremlin, Poklonskaya’s request caused confusion and an uncertain delayed response. The Ministry of Culture of Russia said that the question of issuing certificates for rental of the film will be decided upon the completion of work on the picture.[13][14][15][16]

Somewhat later in December 2016 it was reported that the prosecutor's office will request the movie's script for inspection at the request of deputy Poklonskaya.[17][18]

In September 2017 Cinema Park and Formula Kino group, the Russia's biggest cinema chain, cancelled screenings of the film due to "extreme actions by opponents of the film" and threats made against cinemas. They later reversed the decision.[19] Two cars were torched outside the Moscow office of a lawyer acting for Alexey Uchitel, the director of the film.[20]

Attempts of a ban

Director of the office of the Russian Imperial House, Aleksandr Zakatov called the film "blasphemy", but added that "such works should be condemned, but to inflate a scandal around them and make a formal ban does not make sense".[21] A similar position was taken by the Bishop of Egoryevsk Tihon (Shevkunov), who reviewed the film highly critically, but said that the demand to ban the film - "is an absolutely dead-end and wrong approach":[22][23]

Nevertheless, Bishop Tihon pointed out, "most likely, individuals and groups, including Orthodox, will demand its prohibition".[24]


Production

More than 17 tons of fabric were used to create a total of more than 5,000 costumes.[25]
