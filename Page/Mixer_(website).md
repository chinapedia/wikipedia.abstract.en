MIXER (formerly BEAM) is a Seattle-based video game live streaming platform owned by Microsoft. The service officially launched on January 5, 2016.[1]

Like competing services, Mixer focuses on video gaming, including playthroughs of video games and live streaming, but is primarily distinguished by features designed to allow viewers to interact with streams. Using an SDK (software development kit), features can be integrated into games to allow users to affect gameplay or vote on elements using buttons displayed alongside the stream. Users earn "Sparks" for watching and participating in streams, which can then be spent to activate these features. Mixer advertises that there is a latency of less than a second between the original broadcast and when it is received by users, rather than 10â€“20 seconds, which facilitates these features and encourages real-time interaction between streamers and their viewers without delays.[2][3]


History

On August 11, 2016, Beam was acquired by Microsoft for an undisclosed amount. The service's team was integrated into the Xbox division.[4][5][6] On October 26, 2016, Microsoft announced that Beam would be integrated into Windows 10.[7] Beam broadcasting was also integrated into Xbox One on the March 2017 software update.[8]

On May 25, 2017, Microsoft announced that Beam had been renamed Mixer, as the previous name could not be used globally.[9] The re-branding came alongside the introduction of several new features, such as the ability for a user to co-host up to three other streams on their channel at once, as well as the companion mobile app Mixer Create. It was also announced that Mixer would receive top-level integration within the Xbox One dashboard, with a new tab curating Mixer streams.[10]

In November 2018, the site unveiled a major update branded as "Season 2", adding new features, including: automatic quality adjustment for the player, a new system known as "Skills" that integrates with the existing Sparks currency and a future microtransaction currency that will be known as "Embers", as well as plans for a level-based system for tracking users' engagement with a particular channel over time.[11]
