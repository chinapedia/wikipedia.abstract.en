_BACTRIANOSCYTHRIS PAMIRICA_ is a moth of the Scythrididae family. It was described by Pietro Passerin d'Entrèves and Angela Roggero in 2008.[1] It is found in Afghanistan,[2] where it has been recorded from the Pamir Mountains.

The wingspan is about 20 mm. The forewings are brown, with the apex very dark brown and with a narrow, whitish line subapically at the costal margin, one third long as the wing. There are two whitish patches in the middle of the wing surface, one long and Y-shaped, extended to two thirds of the wing, and the second rounded at the cell end. The hindwings are greyish and glossy. Adults have been recorded on wing in July.[3]
