IAN FRASER "LEMMY" KILMISTER (24 December 1945 – 28 December 2015), was an English singer, songwriter, and musician, best known as the founder, lead singer, bassist, and primary songwriter of the rock band Motörhead.

Lemmy's music was one of the foundations of the heavy metal genre.[1] He was known for his appearance, including his friendly mutton chops ; gravelly, raspy singing voice, which was declared "one of the most recognisable voices in rock"; and his way of singing, looking up towards "a towering microphone tilted down into his weather-beaten face".[2] He was also known for his bass playing style, using his Rickenbacker bass to create an "overpowered, distorted rhythmic rumble".[3] Another unique aspect of Lemmy's bass sound is that he often played power chords using growling overdriven Marshall tube bass stacks. Alongside his music career, he also had minor roles and cameos in film and television.

Lemmy was born in Stoke-on-Trent, growing up between there and later Anglesey. He was influenced by rock and roll and the early works of The Beatles, which led to him playing in several rock groups in the 1960s; including The Rockin' Vickers. He worked as a roadie for Jimi Hendrix and The Nice, before joining the space rock band Hawkwind in 1971, singing lead vocals on their hit "Silver Machine". After being fired from Hawkwind for drug possession in 1975, he founded Motörhead during the same year as the lead singer, bassist, and songwriter. Motörhead's success peaked in 1980 and 1981 and included the hit single "Ace of Spades" and the chart-topping live album _No Sleep 'til Hammersmith_.

Lemmy continued to record and tour regularly with Motörhead until his death in December 2015 in Los Angeles, California, where he had lived since 1990. Aside from his musical activities, he was well known for his hard-living lifestyle, which included chain-smoking and regular consumption of alcohol and amphetamines.


Early life

Lemmy was born on 24 December 1945 in the Burslem area of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire.[4] When he was three months old, his father, an ex-Royal Air Force chaplain and concert pianist,[5] separated from his mother. His mother and grandmother moved to nearby Newcastle-under-Lyme, then to Madeley.[6] When Lemmy was 10, his mother married former George L Willis (Tool Maker) who already had two older children from a previous marriage, Patricia and Tony, with whom Lemmy did not get along.

The family moved to a farm in the Welsh town of Benllech, Anglesey, with Lemmy later commenting that "funnily enough, being the only English kid among 700 Welsh ones didn't make for the happiest time, but it was interesting from an anthropological point of view".[7] He attended Sir Thomas Jones' School in Amlwch, where he was nicknamed "Lemmy". It was later suggested by some that the name originated from the phrase "lemmy [lend me] a quid 'til Friday" because of his alleged habit of borrowing money from people to play slot machines,[8][9][10][11] although Lemmy himself said that he did not know the origin of the name.[12] He soon started to show an interest in rock and roll music, girls, and horses.

At school, Lemmy noticed a pupil who had brought a guitar to school and had been "surrounded by chicks". His mother had a guitar, which he then took to school, even though he could not play, and was himself surrounded by girls. By the time he left school, his family had moved to Conwy. Whilst there, he worked at menial jobs, including one at the local Hotpoint electric appliance factory, while also playing guitar for local bands such as the Sundowners and spending time at a horse-riding school.[13] Lemmy saw the Beatles perform at the Cavern Club when he was sixteen, and then learned to play along on guitar to their first album _Please Please Me_. He also admired the sarcastic attitude of the group, particularly that of John Lennon.[14]


Career

1960–1970: Early years

In Stockport, Lemmy joined local bands the Rainmakers and then the Motown Sect who played northern clubs for three years. In 1965, he joined The Rockin' Vickers[15] who signed a deal with CBS, released three singles and toured Europe, reportedly being the first British band to visit the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Rockin' Vickers moved to Manchester, where they shared a flat together. There, Lemmy got involved with a woman named Tracy who bore a son, Paul Inder. Lemmy did not have any involvement in his life until the boy was six.[16]

Leaving the Rockin' Vickers, Lemmy moved to London in 1967. He shared a flat with Noel Redding, bassist of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and with Neville Chesters, their road manager. He got a job as a roadie for the band.[17] In 1968, he joined the psychedelic rock band Sam Gopal under the name Ian Willis and recorded the album _Escalator_ which was released in 1969.[18] After meeting Simon King at a shopping centre in Chelsea in 1969, he joined the band Opal Butterfly; but the group soon disbanded, having failed to raise enough interest with their singles.[19]

1971–1975: Hawkwind

In August 1971, Lemmy joined the space rock band Hawkwind, who were based in Ladbroke Grove, London, as a bassist and vocalist. He had no previous experience as a bass guitarist, and was cajoled into joining immediately before a benefit gig in Notting Hill by bandmate Michael "Dik Mik" Davies, to have two members who enjoyed amphetamines. Lemmy states that he originally auditioned for Hawkwind as a guitarist, but on the morning of the Notting Hill gig, they decided not to get another guitarist. By chance, the bass player didn't show up and left his equipment in the van. He often said, "Their bass player was pretty much saying 'please steal my gig!' So I stole his gig." Lemmy quickly developed a distinctive style that was strongly shaped by his early experience as a rhythm guitarist, often using double stops and chords rather than the single note lines preferred by most bassists. His bass work was a fundamental part of the Hawkwind sound during his tenure, perhaps best documented on _Space Ritual_. He also provided the lead vocals on several songs, including the band's biggest UK chart single, "Silver Machine", which reached #3 in 1972.

In 1975, Lemmy was arrested at the Canada/United States border in Windsor, Ontario, on drug possession charges; he spent five days in jail but was released without charge. Nonetheless, he was fired from Hawkwind.[20]

He once said of Hawkwind: ""I did like being in Hawkwind, and I believe I'd still be playing with them today if I hadn't been kicked out. It was fun onstage, not so much offstage. They didn't want to mesh with me. Musically, I loved the drummer, the guitar player. It was a great band.” [21]

1975–2015: Motörhead

After Hawkwind, Lemmy formed a new band called "Bastard" with guitarist Larry Wallis (former member of the Pink Fairies, Steve Took's Shagrat and UFO) and drummer Lucas Fox. Lemmy and Took were friends, and Took was the stepfather to Lemmy's son Paul. When his manager informed him that a band by the name of "Bastard" would never get a slot on _Top of the Pops_, Lemmy changed the band's name to "Motörhead" – the title of the last song he had written for Hawkwind.[22]

Soon after, both Wallis and Fox were replaced with guitarist "Fast" Eddie Clarke and drummer Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor and with this line-up, the band began to achieve success. Lemmy's guttural vocals were unique in rock at that time, and were copied during the time when punk rock became popular. The band's sound appealed to Lemmy's original fans and, eventually, to fans of punk. Lemmy asserted that he generally felt more kinship with punks than with metalheads; he even played with the Damned for a handful of gigs when they had no regular bassist.[23] The band's success peaked in 1980 and 1981 with several UK chart hits, including the single "Ace of Spades", which remained a crowd favourite throughout the band's career, and the UK #1 live album _No Sleep 'til Hammersmith_. Motörhead became one of the most influential bands in the heavy metal genre. Their – and Lemmy's – final live performance was in Berlin, Germany on 11 December 2015.[24]


Personal life

Lemmy-04.jpg Motörhead_-_Rock_am_Ring_2015-0343.jpg At the age of 17, Lemmy met a holidaying girl named Cathy. He followed her to Stockport, Greater Manchester, where she gave birth to his son Sean, who was put up for adoption.[25] In the 2010 documentary film _Lemmy_, he mentioned having a son whose mother has only recently "found him" and "hadn't got the heart to tell him who his father was", indicating that the boy – perhaps Sean – was given up for adoption.

In the 2005 Channel 4 documentary _Motörhead: Live Fast, Die Old_, it was claimed that Lemmy had slept with over 2,000 women. He later quipped, "I said more than a thousand, the magazine made two thousand of it." _Maxim_ had Lemmy at #8 on its top ten "Living Sex Legends" list, as they claimed that he had slept with around 1,200 women.[26] Lemmy is one of the characters in the book _Sex Tips from Rock Stars_ by Paul Miles.[27]

Dave Grohl, on his Probot website, describes musicians with whom he has worked. In his entry for Lemmy, he wrote:

Lemmy was well known for his alcohol abuse. The documentary _Motörhead: Live Fast Die Old_ stated that he drank a bottle of Jack Daniel's every day and had done so since he was 30 years old.[28] In 2013, Lemmy stopped drinking Jack Daniel's for health reasons.[29] During his time with Hawkwind, he developed an appetite for amphetamines and LSD, particularly the former. Before joining Hawkwind, he recalled Dik Mik, a former Hawkwind sound technician, visiting his squat in the middle of the night and taking amphetamines with him. They became interested in how long "you could make the human body jump about without stopping", which they did for a few months until Mik ran out of money and wanted to return to Hawkwind, taking Lemmy with him.[30]

In November 2005, he was invited to the National Assembly for Wales as a guest speaker by Conservative member William Graham. He was asked to express his views on the detrimental effects of drugs and called for the legalization of heroin. He stated that legalization would eradicate the drug dealer from society and generate money from its taxation (similar to drug laws in Portugal), however hard this would be to accept.[31]

Lemmy collected German military regalia; he had an Iron Cross encrusted on his bass, which led to accusations of Nazi sympathies. He stated that he collected the memorabilia because he liked the way it looked, and considered himself an anarchist or libertarian.[32][33] Lemmy said he was against religion, government, and established authority.[34][35] In 2011, he identified as agnostic, saying, "I can find out when I die. I can wait. I'm not in a hurry."[36] Jeff Hanneman, the founder of the thrash metal band Slayer, befriended Lemmy due to their shared fondness for collecting Nazi memorabilia.[37] According to Keith Emerson's autobiography, Lemmy gave him two of his Hitler Youth knives during his time as a roadie for the Nice. Emerson used these knives many times as keyholders when playing the Hammond organ during concerts with the Nice and Emerson, Lake & Palmer before destroying them. Lemmy defended his collection by saying that if his then-girlfriend (who was black) had no problem with it, nobody else should.[38]


Illness and death

Lemmy lived in Los Angeles from 1990 until his death in 2015, his last residence being a two-room apartment two blocks away from his favourite hangout, the Rainbow Bar and Grill.[39]

In December 2000, his tour was cancelled when he was hospitalised in Italy with flu, exhaustion and a lung infection.[40] He was hospitalised with extreme dehydration and exhaustion in Germany in July 2005.[41] As he grew older, he used less alcohol and drugs as he suffered from diabetes and hypertension. In June 2013, it was reported that he had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator fitted.[42] His tour was cancelled in July 2013 due to a severe haematoma.[43] He referred to his continuing drug use as "dogged insolence in the face of mounting opposition to the contrary".[44] Towards the end of his life he had to use a walking stick.[45] He had started smoking at the age of 11.[46] In August 2015, he said he had cut down his smoking habit from two packs a day to one pack a week.[47] He was hospitalised with a lung infection in September 2015, after having breathing problems when performing onstage.[48]

Lemmy's_Grave.jpg]]

On 28 December 2015, four days after his 70th birthday, Lemmy died at his apartment in Los Angeles from prostate cancer, cardiac arrhythmia and congestive heart failure.[49][50][51] Motörhead announced his death on their official Facebook page later that day. According to the band, his cancer had only been diagnosed two days prior to his death.[52]

Lemmy's manager, Todd Singerman, later revealed:

Lemmy's doctor had given him between two and six months to live. Following the terminal diagnosis, Rainbow Bar owner Mikael Maglieri brought a video game machine that Lemmy was fond of playing at the establishment over to his apartment so he could continue playing it from his bedside.[53] Although his manager had planned to keep the news private until his eventual death, Lemmy strongly encouraged him to make the diagnosis public in early 2016, but he died before a press release could be drafted.[54]

Funeral

Lemmy's memorial service took place at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills, on 9 January 2016.[55] The service was streamed live over YouTube with more than 230,000 people logging on to watch,[56] while others gathered at the Rainbow. His body was cremated following the funeral. His remains were placed in a 3D-printed mantelpiece shaped like his trademark cavalry hat and emblazoned with the slogan "born to lose, lived to win".[57] The piece was on display during his funeral and was later interred at Forest Lawn.[58]

Tributes

In various media, additional tributes appeared from fellow rock stars such as Ozzy Osbourne,[59] Alice Cooper, Metallica,[60] Scott Ian of Anthrax,[61] and Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi.[62]

Reviewing his career after his death, _The Daily Telegraph_ said:

In 2005, the UK magazine _Classic Rock_ presented Lemmy with its first "Living Legend" award.[63] In a 2013 interview with the magazine, Lemmy said he had never expected to make it to 30, but he spoke very pointedly about the future, indicating neither he nor the band was obsessing about the end:

In February 2016, the Hollywood Vampires performed at the Grammy Award ceremony as a tribute to Lemmy.[64] On 11 June, Download Festival paid tribute to Lemmy by renaming the main stage the "Lemmy Stage", and in the slot where Motorhead were due to play, there was a video tribute to Lemmy in which they played his music and his peers talked about him.[65] On 17 November, Metallica released a tribute song titled "Murder One", named after Lemmy's frequently used amp. The song, from their album _Hardwired... to Self-Destruct_, depicts Lemmy's rise to fame. On 18 January 2017, Lemmy was inducted into the Hall of Heavy Metal History for being the creator of thrash metal.[66] In 2017, the extinct crocodile relative _Lemmysuchus_[67] was named after Lemmy.[68] On 14 November 2016, asteroid 243002 was officially named 243002 Lemmy,[69] complimenting asteroid 250840 Motorhead, named after the band in 2014.[70]

In 2018, Hawkwind recorded a new acoustic version of Lemmy's "The Watcher" (originally recorded on _Doremi Fasol Latido_, 1972) on the album _The Road to Utopia_ with production, arrangement and additional orchestrations by Mike Batt and a guest appearance from Eric Clapton.[71]


Collaborations

Lemmy worked with several musicians, apart from his Motörhead bandmates, over the course of his career. He wrote the song "R.A.M.O.N.E.S" for the Ramones, which he played in his live sets as a tribute to the band. He also produced a Ramones E.P and an album for Warfare entitled _Metal Anarchy_ in which Wurzel guested on guitar, He was brought in as a songwriter for Ozzy Osbourne's 1991 _No More Tears_ album, providing lyrics for the tracks "Hellraiser," (which Motörhead later recorded themselves and released as a single), "Desire," "I Don't Want to Change the World" and the single "Mama I'm Coming Home". Lemmy noted in several magazine and television interviews that he made more money from the royalties of that one song that he had in his entire time with Motörhead. After being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2000, for which he was hospitalized briefly, Lemmy again appeared with Motörhead at WrestleMania X-Seven. Lemmy published his autobiography, _White Line Fever_, in November 2002. In 2005 Motörhead won their first Grammy in the Best Metal Performance category with their cover of Metallica's "Whiplash". In the same year he began recording an unreleased solo album titled _Lemmy & Friends_, which was intended to include a collaboration with Janet Jackson.[72]

In 2014, he established his own recording label, Motorhead Music, to promote and develop new talent. Acts he signed to the label and helped develop include Barb Wire Dolls, Budderside, Others, and Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons.[73]

The appendage is thrown from the window of a moving car and lands at Lemmy's feet who exclaims: "Looks like a dick! Fucking hell! Ah well, it's not mine at least." The film's soundtrack also features the Motörhead song "Under the Knife".[76]

The other Motörhead bandmates' armour is also available.


Equipment

Lemmy-03.jpg Lemmy positioned his microphone in an uncommonly high position, angled so that he appeared to be looking up at the sky rather than at the audience. He said that it was for "personal comfort, that's all. It's also one way of avoiding seeing the audience. In the days when we only had ten people and a dog, it was a way of avoiding seeing that we only _had_ ten people and a dog."[88]

Lemmy's first electric guitar was a used Hofner Club 50. After Upon joining the Motown Sect in 1962 he used EKO 40V guitar, Harmony Meteor, Gibson 330, Fender Jazzmaster with a Telecaster neck. He traded each guitar sequentially right up until Hawkwind (1972).

Once a member of Hawkwind. Lemmy used current bassist Dave Anderson's Rickenbacker. Anderson failed to show up to a charity event and Kilmister took his place. Following the departure of Anderson, Kilmister bought a Hopf Studio bass off Hawkwind synth player Del Detmar.[89]

Subsequently Kilmister would return to Rickenbacker basses and used a Rickenbacker 4000. This guitar was heavily modified with stickers, hardware and tone control knobs[90].

Another bass also used in Hawkwind was an early Thunderbird 2, prior to it being stolen.

Lemmy and Rickenbacker basses

For the majority of his career, he used Rickenbacker basses.[91] In September 1996, his Rickenbacker bass was featured in the _Bang Your Head_ exhibition at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, US.[92] Rickenbacker has introduced a signature 4004LK "Lemmy Kilmister" bass.[93]

When asked what the appeal is Lemmy said _"The shape. I'm all for the image—always. If you get one that looks good, you can always mess with the pickups if it sounds bad."_[94] He had many Rickenbackers over the years and not limited to.
