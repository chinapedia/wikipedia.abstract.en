is the fifth major studio album by Gentouki, released on September 21, 2016. The album has the official names _Tanjoubi_ and _Birth Day_, meaning the day of being born, rather than the anniversary of birth.[1] It includes a cover of the Kaoru Miyazaki song "Bye-Bye" and a bonus acoustic version of the single "Sutekina, Ano Hito". _Tanjoubi_ is Gentouki's first release since the best-of album in 2007. This album, as well as past Gentouki albums, features artwork by illustrator Yusuke Nakamura.
