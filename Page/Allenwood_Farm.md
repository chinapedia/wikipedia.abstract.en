The ALLENWOOD FARM is a historic farm property on United States Route 2 in Plainfield, Vermont. Developed in 1827 by Allen Martin, the son of an early settler, it is a well-preserved example of a transitional Federal-Greek Revival detached farmstead. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.[1]


Description and history

Allenwood Farm is located at the western edge of Plainfield village, on the north side of United States Route 2 just east of its junction with Vermont Route 214. The farm property, now just , consists of rolling fields arrayed on three sides of the farm complex. Included in that complex are a farmhouse, two barns, and several smaller outbuildings. The farmhouse, set close to the road but screened by a dense growth of hedge-like trees, is a 1-1/2 story brick Cape style structure, five bays wide and three deep, with a side gable roof. It has Greek Revival window treatments, and a Greek Revival door topped by a Federal style frieze and flanked by sidelight windows. The interior retains a similar combination of original woodwork. To the house's northwest are two barns of 19th-century construction, one of which may be older than the house.[2]

The farm property is part of land acquired around the turn of the 19th century by Jesse Martin, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War. The brick house was built in 1827 by his son Allen, and has remained since then in the hands of his descendants. A wing of the house, of log construction, may have been built by Jesse Martin; it was known in the family as Allen's Cottage, and was where Jesse Martin lived the last few years of his life. Allen Martin's grandnephew, Willard S. Martin, Jr., was a successful businessman who developed the opulent Greatwood estate on land west of the farmstead; it is now the Goddard College Greatwood Campus.[3]
