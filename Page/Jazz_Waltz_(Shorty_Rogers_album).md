_JAZZ WALTZ_ is an album by American jazz trumpeter, composer and arranger Shorty Rogers, released on the Reprise label in 1963.[1]


Reception

On All About Jazz Dave Rickert said "the novelty of Â¾ time in music is still fresh even today and Joe Mondragon and Mel Lewis create a seemingly infinite variety of ways to swing in waltz time. Rogers contributes a few catchy melodies (in particular the title track) and creates lovely charts".[2] Allmusic noted "Shorty Rogers' _Jazz Waltz_ is exactly that, an exploration of ten compositions played in waltz settings. Only these big-band charts are hardly the waltzes heard on Lawrence Welk's long-running television series".[3]
