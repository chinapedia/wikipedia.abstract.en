GEORG ULMER (5 March 1877, in Hamburg – 15 January 1963, in Hamburg) was a German entomologist who specialized in research of Trichoptera (caddisflies) and Ephemeroptera (mayflies).

In 1899 he qualified as an instructor, and up until 1934 he worked as a schoolteacher in Hamburg. In 1912 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Basel, largely based on his work involving caddisflies of Baltic amber. In 1952 he became an honorary member of the Royal Entomological Society.[1]

Throughout his career, he conducted extensive studies involving the faunistics, biology, systematics and taxonomy of caddisflies and mayflies. He conducted research of species native to Germany and also specimens collected by others from worldwide locations. From 1900 up until his death he was the author of 175 scientific publications. In 1964 his insect collection was donated to the Zoological Museum of Hamburg.[2]

He is credited with describing 381 living and 129 fossil species of Trichoptera, as well as 111 species of Ephemeroptera. He is also the taxonomic authority of the mayfly families Oligoneuriidae (1914), Ecdyonuridae (1920) and Siphlonuridae (1920). The Leptophlebiidae genera _Ulmeritoides_, _Ulmeritus_ and _Ulmerophlebia_ commemorate his name.[3][4]
