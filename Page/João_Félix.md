JOÃO FÉLIX SEQUEIRA (;[1] born 10 November 1999) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for Spanish club Atlético Madrid and the Portugal national team as a striker. He can also play as a winger or an attacking midfielder.

Félix initially trained at Porto's youth ranks before moving to rivals Benfica in 2015. He began playing for the club's reserve side a year later and was promoted to the first-team in 2018, making his professional debut at 18 years old. He then starred as a goalscorer and helped Benfica win the league title in his first and only season, being awarded as the league's Best Young Player of the Year. He also became the youngest ever player to score a hat-trick in the UEFA Europa League, aged 19.

Félix's performances sparked the interest of several European clubs, with Atlético Madrid signing him in 2019 as the fourth most expensive association football transfer – the second most ever paid for a teenager – in a transfer fee worth €126 million (£113 million).

After being capped for Portugal's youth teams at under-18, under-19 and under-21 levels, Félix made his senior debut in the semi-finals of the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals, won by Portugal on home soil.


Club career

Born in Viseu, Félix started playing football at Os Pestinhas in 2007 before joining the youth ranks of FC Porto a year later. When Félix move to Porto, he wanted to quit football, but his father convinced him on pursuing his career. He was released by the club in 2014 because of his slight frame and moved on to Lisbon rivals Benfica in 2015.[2][3]

Benfica

Félix debuted professionally at the age of 16 for Benfica's reserve team in LigaPro on 17 September 2016, coming on as an 83rd-minute substitute for Aurélio Buta in a goalless draw at Freamunde. In doing so, he became the youngest player to debut for Benfica B.[4] He played 13 matches and scored three goals over the season, the first being a consolation in a 2–1 loss to his hometown team Académico de Viseu on 15 February 2017.[5] Later, on 30 January 2018, he scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 home win over Famalicão.[6] During that season, Félix played in the 2016–17 UEFA Youth League, in which he was a key part of Benfica reaching the final of the competition, lost to Red Bull Salzburg (2–1); he scored six goals in the tournament.

Félix was then promoted to Benfica's first team for the 2018–19 season, making his debut in a 2–0 Primeira Liga win at Boavista on 18 August. A week later, he scored his first Primeira Liga goal, thus becoming the youngest player to score in the Lisbon derby, which ended in a 1–1 tie.[7] On 16 January 2019, he scored the qualifying goal against Vitória de Guimarães in the Portuguese Cup quarter-finals.[8] After Bruno Lage took over as coach of Benfica, his first decision was to use Félix more regularly, partnering him with Haris Seferović in the attack.[9] Later on, Félix was praised for his performance in a 4–2 away win over Sporting CP in the league on 3 February,[10] subsequently sparking interest from several European clubs.[11] A month later, he scored the equaliser in a 2–1 away win over Porto in the league.[12]

On 11 April 2019, Félix scored a hat-trick in a 4–2 UEFA Europa League win over Eintracht Frankfurt. In doing so, he became the youngest ever player (aged 19 years and 152 days) to score a hat-trick in the competition, breaking Marko Pjaca's record by 67 days.[13] Félix finished his first season with 20 goals for his team, including one on the final day of the league campaign, in a 4–1 win over Santa Clara to seal the title;[14] his 15 league goals put him joint-fourth for the season.[15] Across Europe's seven best leagues, he ranked second among teenagers for goals and assists, behind Kai Havertz and Jadon Sancho, respectively.[16]

Atlético Madrid

On 3 July 2019, Félix signed a seven-year contract with Spanish club Atlético Madrid for a transfer fee of €126 million (£113 million), the fourth highest ever paid in football[17] (Benfica's biggest transfer and Atlético's most expensive signing) as well as the second highest for a teenager (after Kylian Mbappé), with the La Liga side initially paying €30 million and the rest €96 million via installments, thus surpassing Félix's €120 million release clause, and with Benfica paying €12 million in mediation services.[18][19][20]


International career

On 14 June 2017, Félix began his international career with Portugal's under-18 team, debuting against Norway, replacing Elves Baldé in the 58th minute. In this friendly match, Félix scored two goals in a 3–0 victory in Lisbon. During his international youth career, he would go on to represent the under-18, under-19 and under-21 teams, amassing 14 youth caps and scoring 6 goals overall.

In March 2019, manager Fernando Santos called up Félix to the senior side for the first time, ahead of the opening UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying matches.[21] During training with the national squad, Félix injured his foot and thus missed Portugal's match against Serbia on 25 March.[22]

Félix was also selected for the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals squad on home soil.[23] He made his international debut for the senior team on 5 June against Switzerland in the semi-finals, where he was substituted in the 71st minute of a 3–1 win.[24] Four days later, Portugal defeated Netherlands 1–0 in the tournament's final.[25]


Style of play

Considered by Benfica to be one of the most promising players from their youth ranks, Félix has received comparisons to former Benfica players Rui Costa and João Pinto.[26] While primarily an attacking midfielder, Félix has also been used either as a striker, second striker or a winger.[27]
