JEREMIAH 1 is the first chapter of the Book of Jeremiah in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. This book, one of the Nevi'im or Books of the Prophets, contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet Jeremiah. This chapter serves as an introduction to the Book of Jeremiah and relates Jeremiah's calling as a prophet.


Text

The original text of this chapter, as with the rest of the Book of Jeremiah, was written in Hebrew. Since the division of the Bible into chapters in the medieval period, this chapter is divided into 19 verses.

Textual witnesses

Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008).

There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; ùîä^(B); 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: ùîä^(S); 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; ùîä^(A); 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; ùîä^(Q); 6th century).

    -   The divine charge and promise ()


Superscription

The superscription (verses 1‚Äì3) gives the introduction to the whole book by stating authoritative claims for its content. For 40 years Jeremiah conveyed the word of the Lord to the people, from the 13th year of king Josiah (627 BCE) until the deportation of the people from Jerusalem (587 BCE).

Verse 1

    _The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,_[2]

This verse is an "editorial introduction" which is reasonably comprehensive as it contains the prophet's "name, family, status and place of origin," and more complete than most books of prophets. According to , Anathoth was one of the levitical or priestly cities located within the land of the tribe of Benjamin, about 3 miles northeast of Jerusalem. The prophecies of Jeremiah and Amos (Amos 1:1) are attributed to them individually in the opening words of the relevant biblical books, while in other cases, such as Hosea 1:1, Joel 1:1 and Micah 1:1, their prophecies are described from the outset as "the word of the Lord". Septuagint version has "The word of God which came to Jeremiah" for "The words of Jeremiah".

Verse 2

    _to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign._[3]

-   Cross reference: Jeremiah 25:3

"The 13th year of his reign": The prophetic career of Jeremiah started in about "627 BC". An argument that this is the year of Jeremiah's birth cannot be reconciled with the expression "the word of the Lord came". This verse (as emphasizes further in Jeremiah 25:3) affirms that the conveyed words are not Jeremiah's own creation, but of supernatural origin, that is, from Yahweh. This time period was five years after Josiah, king of Judah, initiated the religious reformation (in his 8th year of reign, 632 BC) and five years before the finding of the Book of Law in his 18th year of reign in 622 BC. Although Josiah was 16 years old when he "began to seek after the God of David his father" (), it was in his 12th year of reign (he was 20 years old; 629/628 BC) when he began the repudiation of the "official Assyrian cult" with a "radical purge of all kinds of idolatrous practices both in Judah and in Northern Israel" (cf. ), one year before Jeremiah was called and about the same time Sinsharishkun took the throne of Assyria, following the chaos after Ashurbanipal's death, as Assyria rapidly diminished.

Verse 3

    _It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month._[4]

"The fifth month": The official ministry of Jeremiah ends at the time of the deportation of the people from Jerusalem (July/August 587 BCE) in the early part of the 6th century BCE.


The Call of Jeremiah

Schnorr_von_Carolsfeld_Bibel_in_Bildern_1860_140.png]] The call account of Jeremiah certifies him to be a true prophet. Verses 4-10 contains the poetic audition in form of a dialogue between Jeremiah, speaking in the first person, and Yahweh (the ), whose words are written as quoted statements. The subsequent part (verses 11-19) is in the form of prose visions.

Verse 4

    _Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:_[5]

The formula of this statement is reused in Jeremiah 2:1.

Verse 5

    _"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you;_
    _Before you were born I sanctified you;_
    _I ordained you a prophet to the nations."_[6]

"I sanctified you": "_I set you apart_"[7] ( NIV) - this was "a designation for the prophetic function rather an inward sanctification".[8]

Verse 6

    _Then said I,_

        _Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child._[9]

"_Ah_" is rendered _Alas_ in the Darby Translation and New International Version, and this Hebrew word in the opinion of biblical commentator A. W. Streane: "expresses not so much an entreaty that things should be arranged otherwise, as a lament that they are as they are".[10]

Verse 7

    _But the Lord said unto me,_

        ''Say not, I am a child:
        _for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee,_[11]

Just as with Moses and Isaiah, Yahweh rejected any excuses and proceeded with His instruction: "for you will go," and Jeremiah has to say all what Yahweh commanded him.

Verse 8

    _Be not afraid of their faces:_

        _for I am with thee to deliver thee,_

    _saith the Lord._[12]

Repeated again at the end of verse 19, closing this chapter:



        "_... for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee._" ()

-   "Saith [the Lord]": is translated from Hebrew word , (can be translated as "to declare" or "to whisper"; could suggest an "intimate revelation") which is used 176 times in the Book of Jeremiah, while only found 83 times in Ezekiel, 23 times in Isaiah, 21 times in Amos, 20 times in Zechariah, 11 times in Haggai and rarely in the rest of the Hebrew Bible.

Verse 9

    _Then the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth._
    _And the Lord said unto me,_

        _Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth._[13]

Yahweh commissioned Jeremiah to be His spokesperson by a "symbolic gesture of touching Jeremiah's mouth" (cf. ; , ; ).


The Two Visions

Verses 11-16 records the dialogue between Jeremiah, speaking in the first person, and Yahweh (the ), whose words are written as quoted statements. Jeremiah saw a visions of "a branch of an almond tree" (verses 11-12) and then a vision of "a boiling pot tilt away from the north" (verses 13-16). Yahweh, not Jeremiah, interprets both visions: the first one to assure the prophet (and the audience) of the certainty of the prophecies, and the second to point at "the foe from the north" which is revealed in as Babylon.

Verses 11-12

ÿ®ÿßÿØÿßŸÖ_Ÿà_ÿ¥⁄©ŸàŸÅŸá_ÿ®ÿßÿØÿßŸÖ.JPG's series of Almond Blossom paintings, 1888-1890]]

    ''The word of the Lord came to me, saying, "Jeremiah, what do you see?"

        ''And I said, "I see a branch of an almond tree"

    ''Then the Lord said to me,

        ''"You have seen well, for I am watching over my word to perform it".[14]

"Branch" is alternatively translated as a "rod" of an almond tree (KJV, ASV). The meaning is poetic, referring to a blossoming almond tree. These verses contain a play on words using the Hebrew (branch) and (watching over). Thompson notes that in modern times Anathoth (modern village Anata) is still "a center for almond growing" and display memorable views of blooming almond trees in the early spring.

Verse 15

    _"For behold, I am calling_
    _All the families of the kingdoms of the north," says the Lord;_
    _"They shall come and each one set his throne_
    _At the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem,_
    _Against all its walls all around,_
    _And against all the cities of Judah."_[15]

The medieval Jewish commentator Rashi considered this prophecy, "_They shall come and each one set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem_", fulfilled as reported in Jeremiah 39:3: "_All the officials of the king of Babylon entered and sat at the Middle Gate_".[16]


The Divine Charge and Promise

The verses 17-19 can be seen as connecting back to verses 4-10 or be a separate fragment where Yahweh gave a charge (verse 17) and a promise (verses 18-19) to Jeremiah in connection to the call. Speaking directly using imperatives Yahweh prepares Jeremiah for the battle, that Jeremiah must announce everything in the face of opposition and he will prevail because Yahweh strengthens him as "a fortified city, an iron pillar, and a bronze wall". Although the encouraging assurance is directed to Jeremiah, but it may also have resonances for the readers in exile.
