ÃŽLHAM EHMED () is a Syrian-Kurdish politician in Rojava in Northern Syria. She is a former co-chairperson of the Syrian Democratic Council (SDC),[1][2] the umbrella organisation of secular, democratic, non-Islamist opposition in Syria. She is a senior member of the Democratic Union Party (PYD)[3] and a member of the executive committee of the Movement for a Democratic Society (TEV-DEM) coalition.[4][5]

Ehmed is particularly outspoken on the aim of a programmatically polyethnic character of a future Syria. At the start of the Northern Raqqa offensive in November 2016, she was quoted saying that "such an administration could provide a good example for democratic change in Raqqa, especially that the city has been for years a de facto capital for the ISIS terrorist group. This accomplishment would be a major change in the overall situation in Syria, and would help the country move towards stability, democratic change. Raqqa will be an example for the whole country."[6] She took part in negotiations with the Syrian Government in Damascus concerning services that shall be provided also in the areas governed by the SDC in July 2018.[7] After President Donald Trump declared the USA is redrawing its troops from the territories governed by the SDC in December 2018, and Turkey threatened to attack, she travelled to Paris together with her Co-chair Riad Darar, to discuss with France the further cooperation between the french troops stationed in the areas governed by the SDC.[8]
