The Fussball Club Basel 1893 1976–77 SEASON was their 83rd season since the club was founded. It was their 31st consecutive season in the top flight of Swiss football after they won promotion during the season 1945–46. They played their home games in the St. Jakob Stadium.


Overview

Helmut Benthaus was first team manager for the eleventh consecutive season.

The Swiss Football Association had reformed the Swiss football league system that year reducing the number of teams in the Nationalliga A from 14 to 12 and increasing the Nationalliga B teams from 14 to 16. The Nationalliga A season 1976–77 was contested by the first 11 teams from the previous season and the sole promoted team AC Bellinzona. The Nationalliga A was played in two stages. The qualification phase was played by all teams in a round robin and after completion was dived into two groups. The first six teams contended in the championship group (with half the obtained points as bonus) and the positions seventh to twelfth contended the relegation group. Basel finished the qualification phase in second position with 33 points from 22 games and so entered the championship group with a bonus of 17. At the end of the championship phase Servette FC Genève and Basel were level on 29 points. They therefore had to play a play-off for champions. This play-off was held at the Wankdorf Stadium in Bern in front of 55,000 supporters. Basel won the match 2–1, their goals being scored by Walter Mundschin and Arthur von Wartburg.
