After brief stints in the Vitesse 1892 and N.E.C. youth systems, Albertus found early success at Feyenoord, making his U19 team debut at the age of 16.[3]

In May 2015, he signed with FC Emmen,[4] and spent the rest of the 2014/15 season with their U19 team.[5] He was called up to the first team in July, but did not end up signing a professional contract because he was deemed overweight at the first team training session. Instead, he signed with local fourth division club WKE.[6] In his only season at WKE, he scored 8 goals in 19 matches.[7]

Albertus was released from his contract (along with the rest of his teammates) in early 2016 after the club went bankrupt and dropped out of the league.[8] He initially signed a contract with semi-pro club Kozakken Boys in March.[9][10] However, after noticing his weight loss, he was bought back by FC Emmen in May, taking advantage of a clause in the Kozakken contract allowing them to offer him a more lucrative contract.[11][12] He made his professional debut during on August 12, 2016, during a 1-0 victory over RKC Waalwijk. He came on as a 78' sub for Issa Kallon.[13]
