Early life

Career

Rye began her career in legislative advocacy at the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, an umbrella association for America's 120 historically black colleges and universities. Here, she served as the Coordinator of Advocacy and Legislative Affairs. Prior to this, she worked in district office of Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) and served as the Western Region Director of the National Black Law Students Association.

Upon moving to Washington, DC, Rye co-founded IMPACT, an organization that seeks to encourage young professionals in three core areas: economic empowerment, civic engagement, and political involvement. The organization has quickly become a powerful voice and advocate for today's young professionals of color nationwide. Under her leadership, IMPACT formed critical partnerships with the National Bar Association, Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, National Urban League, Rainbow/PUSH, Congressional Black Caucus Political Education and Leadership Institute, Black Leadership Forum, and many other organizations.[8]

In 2013, Rye founded IMPACT Strategies, a political advocacy firm.

Rye is also the only recurring guest on the widely popular radio station The Breakfast Club. On December 6, 2016, Twitter users began championing her name to Charlamagne The God after he received backlash from tweeting he wished women of color had a platform "like Tomi Lahren did." [9] This led to the two conversing and fostering a friendship they still have to this day. In January 2017, she made her first appearance and since frequents the show almost quarterly to discuss updates on the Trump administration, current policy change, and other pop culture topics.

She also served as the Senior Advisor and Counsel to the House Committee on Homeland security, where she developed the general political strategy, focusing on modernizing government contracting practices and opening doors of opportunity for small businesses. She then served as the Executive Director and General Counsel to the Congressional Black Caucus for the 112th Congress. During her time as director, she was "tasked with developing the overall legislative and political strategy for the Caucus".[10]

Rye is currently a political commentator on CNN and has been featured as an on-air personality on several media outlets, including CNN, _HuffPost Live_, TV One, and BET.


Opinions

Rye believes that statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, like those of Robert E. Lee, should be taken down because they were slave owners.[11]
