_YOURSELF AND YOURS_ () is a 2016 South Korean drama film directed by Hong Sang-soo. The film was screened at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival.

The plot revolves around the couple Yeong-soo (played by Kim Joo-hyuk) and Min-jeong (played by Lee Yoo-young). After a fight between them, they decide to take a break in their relationship. The next day, Min-jeong vanishes without a trace. Instead a woman shows up looking exactly like Min-jeong. She seems interested in looking for "Mr. Right" and dating every man in the town where they live. One day Min-jeong returns.

In his review for _Variety_, Scott Tobias described the plot as an "inspired reversal" of the film _That Obscure Object of Desire_.[1]
