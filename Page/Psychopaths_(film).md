Reception

Although praising Keating's ability to avoid retreading previous films, Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting criticized the lack of characterization and called _Psychopaths_ "a beautiful work of art that's void of any real meaning". Miska highlighted Trimbur's character and said she should have been the focus of the film.[18] Michael Gingold of _Rue Morgue_ described the film as a homage to Keating's directorial influences. Commenting on the acting, Gingold wrote, "More than just a technical exercise, _Psychopaths_ is also a showcase for several different styles of unhinged acting, which is what truly holds the attention." Gingold concluded with the hope that Bell and Keating will continue collaborating.[19]
