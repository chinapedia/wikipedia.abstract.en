YOKNEAM–KFAR YEHOSHUA RAILWAY STATION () is an Israel Railways passenger station situated on the Jezreel Valley railway. The station serves Yokneam Illit, Kiryat Tiv'on, Ramat Yishai and the surrounding area. The station is located between Yokneam and Kfar Yehoshua, east of Highway 70 and south of Highway 722. It is served by one to two trains per hour in each direction.


The new station

The Yokneam–Kfar Yehoshua railway station was built as part of the New Jezreel Valley railway, next to the Tishbi junction. The cost of constructing the station is estimated at 92 million NIS and was planned by architectural company Kuriel-Amar. The inspiration for the stations form came from the stations in the historical Jezreel Valley railway and also from the many agricultural structures that can be seen in the area with a similar design, a rectangular structure with a 2 sided roof.
In addition to the station, there is also a water tower, inspired from the water towers that the historical line used. The original water towers were used for refilling the steam locomotives, but the modern tower was added to ensure constant water pressure in the station itself. The tracks are on ground level, but the access to the platforms requires the use of an underpass.
The station is located approximately 3 k"m north-east of Yokneam, 2.5 k"m west of Kfar Yehoshua and 2 k"m east of Kiryat HaRoshet.
The station is located outside of the urban areas and requires passengers to reach the station by vehicle, therefor the number of passengers has remained low. According to the numbers published by Israel Railways for 2017, 154,977 passengers used the station compared to 221,636 in the Beit She'an railway station and 346,536 in the Afula railway station.
