Criticism

According to Newton-John's daughter, Chloe Lattanzi, the series was created without Olivia's knowledge, participation or consent. Lattanzi told _Women's Day_ "What's upsetting is the way it's been done. Not one part of it has come directly from our family, it is completely unauthorised. Nobody asked us to take part or consulted us about accuracy. [sic] and it's weird that some of the heaviest and saddest times of our lives have been turned into a fictional TV miniseries for the sole purpose of entertainment."[10] Olivia later consented to the series providing the profits went to her cancer hospital.[11]
