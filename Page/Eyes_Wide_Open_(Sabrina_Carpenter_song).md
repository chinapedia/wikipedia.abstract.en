Critical reception

Dolph Malone of _Headline Planet_ criticized the song as an emotionless song, but technically correct. He said "[...] “We’ll Be the Stars” and “Eyes Wide Open” are two of the album’s weaker moments. [...] The latter is the generic pop fodder one would expect of a technically proficient but emotionally vacant artist. Neither label describes Carpenter. As a result, both songs serve to mute what actually makes her special."[19] Taylor Weatherby of _Billboard_ pointed ""Eyes Wide Open" as one of Carpenter's best songs by saying "[...] "Eyes Wide Open" served as her declaration of independence that showed the world she was ready for what was to come despite her young age. The lyrics in themselves are powerful enough ("All I have is just this moment / And I don't want to miss a second / 'Cause it could all be gone in an instant"), but with the anthemic beat she put behind it, Carpenter seems unstoppable with this track."[20]
