THE CONSERVATIVE NEWS AGENCY OF NEW YORK (CNA-NY) is a non-profit organization. It operates as a cooperative, unincorporated association. CNA-NY is run and managed by its contributing journalists in the United States, Canada, Europe and the Middle East, with a focus on third world issues in its early phase.[1] Until 2016 CNA-NY was a cooperation partner of the Cyprus News Agency network.


History and development

CNA-NY is a not-for-profit news cooperative founded in its current form in 2007 by a group of investigative journalists to pool their strengths and to share information gathered individually. Its predecessor organization "The Journalist's Club of New York" existed from 1977 until 2007 as a network of journalist reporting from and about developing countries.[2] Since its foundation the Conservative News Agency of New York has grown steadily and opened a second office for international relations in 2012. The agency's core competence is the investigative research for newspapers and other news providers.[3]


Work for Blasting News

In the first half of 2017, CNA-NY delivered the editorials and reports for Blasting News German for Germany, Austria and Switzerland, with a total of about 400 news articles and more than 300.000 generically obtained readers. This focus team was led by Richard Barker as the responsible manager, with Stefan Schmidt as his Head of Operations. CNA-NY acted on request of its partners as _Team Politik_ (“team for political news and topics”). However, CNA-NY presented itself publicly as the entity behind “Team Politik” on its Blasting News profile page.[4]

This was one of the rare exceptions in which CNA-NY was recognizable to the reader. Normally CNA-NY only delivers ready-to-use news articles, which publishers in the United States and Europe bring to their readers under their own brand.

After Blasting News German had repositioned itself as a progress-liberal medium in the summer of 2017, the basis for an alliance with a strictly conservative news cooperative had no basis any longer. Both sides parted in a friendly and amicable manner. The last article for Blasting News German written by CNA-NY staff was a farewell contribution, warning against modern form of censorship in general.[5]


Political views

CNA-NY defines itself as a conservative association. However, the agency has ever since been showing a moderate approach towards socio-political topics.[6]
