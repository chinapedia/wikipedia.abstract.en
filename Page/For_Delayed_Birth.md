The so-called "FOR DELAYED BIRTH" is an Old English poetic medical text found in the manuscript London, British Library, Harley 585, ff. 185r-v, in a collection of medical texts known since the nineteenth century as _Lacnunga_ (‘remedies’). The manuscript was probably copied in the early eleventh century, though its sources may have been older.

The text is in fact a set of prose instructions which include a series of short poems which should be recited as part of one or more rituals. The text is an important witness to non-orthodox Anglo-Saxon Christian religious practice and to women's history:[1] it is unique among Anglo-Saxon medical texts for being explicitly for use and recitation by a woman.[2] However, 'this charm is perhaps misnamed, because it deals, not with delayed birth as such, but with the inability of the _wifman_ [woman] for whom it is written to conceive at all, or to bring a child to term without miscarriage.'[3]
