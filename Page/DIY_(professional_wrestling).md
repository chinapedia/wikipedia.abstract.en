DIY (often stylized as #DIY) was a professional wrestling tag team, composed of Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa. The team, also known for wrestling for independent promotions, was best known for performing in WWE's NXT brand, where they are former NXT Tag Team Champions.

Created on August 13, 2015, the team broke up at NXT TakeOver: Chicago on May 20, 2017 when Ciampa turned on Gargano. The two would then go on to have a lengthy feud over 2017 and 2018, including facing each other for the NXT Championship. They later reunited from January to March 2019, with Ciampa at the time being NXT Champion while Gargano was NXT North American Champion.


History

Formation and success (2015–2017)

On September 2, 2015, Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa were announced as part of the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic tournament.[1][2] On September 9, they successfully advanced in the first round of the tournament, defeating the also newly formed duo of Tyler Breeze and Bull Dempsey.[3][4] On the September 16 episode of _NXT_, Ciampa and Gargano lost to Baron Corbin and Rhyno, thus eliminating them from the tournament.[5] On the October 28 edition of _NXT_, Gargano and Ciampa were defeated by American Alpha (Jason Jordan and Chad Gable).[6]

On April 2, it was confirmed that Ciampa had signed with WWE earlier in the week.[7] Ciampa's NXT contract was a so-called "Tier 2" contract, which allowed him to continue working independent dates alongside his now regular NXT bookings.[8] On the April 13 episode of _NXT_, Ciampa and Gargano defeated The Vaudevillains.[9] On the May 25 edition of _NXT_, Ciampa and Gargano defeated TM-61.[10] On June 1, Gargano and Ciampa defeated The Revival (Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson) after calling them out earlier that night. After the match, Dawson and Wilder attacked them and attempted to injure Ciampa's knee, but they were saved by American Alpha.[11] On July 21, it was reported that Gargano was signing a new full-time NXT deal, which would prevent him from taking further independent bookings.[12]

On June 23, Gargano and Ciampa entered the Cruiserweight Classic tournament, which saw Gargano defeat Ciampa in a first round match.[13] On July 14, Gargano was eliminated from the tournament by the eventual winner T.J. Perkins.[14] On August 20 at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn II, Ciampa and Gargano unsuccessfully challenged The Revival for the NXT Tag Team Championship.[15] On the November 9 episode of _NXT_, Ciampa and Gargano, now collectively billed as "#DIY", were defeated by The Authors of Pain (Akam and Rezar) in the semi-finals of the 2016 Dusty Rhodes Classic, due to interference from The Revival.[16] Ciampa and Gargano received another title shot in a two out of three falls match on November 19 at NXT TakeOver: Toronto, where they defeated The Revival to become the new NXT Tag Team Champions.[17]

DIY went on to successfully defend the NXT Tag Team Championship against the team of Tajiri and Akira Tozawa in Japan, as well as TM-61 in Australia, respectively. On the January 11, 2017 episode of _NXT_, DIY defeated The Revival in a rematch to retain the NXT Tag Team Championship, but were assaulted by The Authors of Pain afterwards. At NXT TakeOver: San Antonio, they lost the NXT Tag Team Championship to The Authors of Pain. They would receive their rematch on the March 1 episode of _NXT_, which ended in a no contest after The Revival interfered and attacked both teams. On April 1 at NXT TakeOver: Orlando, all three teams competed in a triple threat elimination match for the NXT Tag Team Championship, but DIY failed to regain the titles after being the first team eliminated. [18]

On the May 10 episode of _NXT_, NXT General Manager William Regal announced that DIY would face The Authors of Pain in the first-ever ladder match for the NXT Tag Team Championship at NXT TakeOver: Chicago, which they lost.[19] Following the match, Ciampa turned on Gargano and attacked him, thus turning Ciampa heel and disbanding the team.[20][21]

Break-up and feud (2017–2018)

It was later revealed that Ciampa had suffered a ruptured ACL in his right knee and would await surgery.[22] In a further update, it was reported that his surgery was successful and the timetable for his return was estimated for early-to-mid 2018.[23]

At NXT TakeOver: Philadelphia, Gargano failed to capture the NXT Championship from Andrade "Cien" Almas. After the match, Ciampa returned to attack Gargano from behind with a crutch. On the February 21 episode of _NXT_, Gargano challenged Almas to a rematch for the NXT Championship, which he lost due to interference from Ciampa, forcing Gargano to leave NXT as per the pre-match stipulation.[24] The two then fought in the main event of NXT TakeOver: New Orleans in an unsanctioned match which Gargano won, resulting in Gargano being reinstated in NXT. On the April 25 episode of _NXT_, Gargano was attacked by Ciampa during his entrance for his NXT Championship match against Aleister Black. Two weeks later on _NXT_, Gargano called out Ciampa, leading to a brawl in which Gargano's wife Candice LeRae was knocked unconscious. The two then fought at NXT TakeOver: Chicago II in a Chicago Street Fight, which Ciampa won. Gargano's character then began a darker turn, becoming more unstable, showing a more aggressive style, and using a spike DDT to defeat EC3 on the July 4 episode of _NXT_, similar to the one Ciampa pinned him with at TakeOver: Chicago II. At the July 18 _NXT_ tapings of the July 25 episode, Gargano interfered in Ciampa's NXT Championship match against Black and accidentally hit Black with the title belt, causing Ciampa to win the championship. The following week, as Black attempted to confront Ciampa, Gargano ran past him and attacked Ciampa, but was then attacked by Black. The following week, Gargano and Black were both attacked by Ciampa during their scheduled match. The three men were then scheduled to compete in a triple threat match for the NXT Championship at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn IV, but Black was removed from the match after being found unconscious in the parking lot after the show, rendering him unable to compete. The title match was then changed to a Last Man Standing match between Gargano and Ciampa, which Gargano lost. On the October 24 episode of _NXT_, Gargano was revealed as the one who attacked Black prior to their original TakeOver: Brooklyn 4 title match, thus turning heel. The two faced off at NXT TakeOver: WarGames, where Black defeated Gargano.

Reunion (2018–2019)

On the December 19 episode of _NXT_, Black and Gargano competed in a steel cage match, which Gargano won after Ciampa interfered and they both performed their former tag team finisher _Meeting in the Middle_ on Black, hinting a potential reunion. On January 26, 2019 at NXT TakeOver: Phoenix, Gargano defeated Ricochet to become the new NXT North American Champion while Ciampa retained the NXT Championship against Black in the main event. After Ciampa won, he was joined by Gargano and posed together with their respective titles.[25]

This would mark the reformation of their team (although they would not immediately re-use the DIY monicker) and the two had their first match as a team since 2017 on February 3, 2019 at _Halftime Heat_, teaming with Adam Cole in a losing effort against Black, Ricochet and Velveteen Dream.[26] On the February 18 episode of _Raw_, Ciampa and Gargano made their main roster debut and defeated former rivals Raw Tag Team Champions The Revival in a non-title match.[27] They made their _SmackDown_ debut the following night, defeating The Bar (Cesaro and Sheamus).[28]

On the January 30 episode of _NXT_ (aired on February 20), Gargano lost the NXT North American Championship to Velveteen Dream.[29][30] The two also took part in the 2019 Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic tournament, defeating The Undisputed Era (Kyle O'Reilly and Bobby Fish) in the first round and losing to Aleister Black and Ricochet in the second. Afterwards, Ciampa attempted to attack Gargano, similar to their breakup at TakeOver: Chicago, only for Gargano to reverse the attack and superkick Ciampa, thus turning face and disbanding DIY again.[31]
