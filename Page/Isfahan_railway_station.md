ISFAHAN RAILWAY STATION (_Persian:_ايستگاه راه آهن اصفهان, _Istgah-e Rah Ahan-e Isfahan_) is located in Isfahan, Isfahan Province, the third largest city and second largest metropolitan area of Iran. The station is owned by IRI Railway and currently has two tri-weekly services, one to Mashhad and one to Bandarabbas.

The station is designed as a terminal station, with railways branching off of the main line and ending at the station. This has made some of the lines passing through Isfahan to bypass the station altogether, to save one to two hours of time wasted on going into the branch and reversing out.

There is a metro station under construction at the station connecting the station to the city centre, and Isfahan's two main inter-urban bus terminals.
