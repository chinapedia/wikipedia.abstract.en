Some of his works were set in post-apocalyptic landscapes. His best known works include _The Day of the Triffids_ (1951) and _The Midwich Cuckoos_ (1957), the latter filmed twice as _Village of the Damned_.


Early life

Wyndham was born in the village of Dorridge near Knowle, Warwickshire (now West Midlands), England, the son of George Beynon Harris, a barrister, and Gertrude Parkes, the daughter of a Birmingham ironmaster.[2]

His early childhood was spent in Edgbaston in Birmingham, but when he was 8 years old his parents separated and he and his younger brother, the writer Vivian Beynon Harris, spent the rest of their childhood at a number of English preparatory and public schools, including Blundell's School in Tiverton, Devon, during World War I. His longest and final stay was at Bedales School near Petersfield in Hampshire (1918–21), which he left at the age of 18, and where he blossomed and was happy.


Early career

After leaving school, Wyndham tried several careers, including farming, law, commercial art and advertising, but mostly relied on an allowance from his family. He eventually turned to writing for money in 1925. In 1927, he published the detective novel _The Curse of the Burdens_ as JOHN B. HARRIS, and by 1931, he was selling short stories and serial fiction to American science fiction magazines. His debut short story, 1931's "Worlds To Barter", appeared under the byline John B. Harris; subsequent stories through about 1935 were credited to JOHN BEYNON HARRIS. By mid-1935, the Harris surname was dropped, and his work was signed as by JOHN BEYNON. Three novels by Benyon were published in 1935/36, two of them works of science fiction, the other being a detective story. He also used the pen name WYNDHAM PARKES for one short story in the UK's _Fantasy Magazine_ in 1939, as 'John Benyon' had already been credited for another story in the same issue.


World War II

During World War II, Wyndham first served as a censor in the Ministry of Information,[3] then joined the British Army, serving as a Corporal cipher operator in the Royal Corps of Signals.[4] He participated in the Normandy landings, although he was not involved in the first days of the operation.[5]


Postwar

After the war, Wyndham returned to writing, still using the pen name John Beynon. Inspired by the success of his younger brother, who had four novels published starting in 1948, he altered his writing style; and, by 1951, using the JOHN WYNDHAM pen name for the first time, he wrote the novel _The Day of the Triffids_. His pre-war writing career was not mentioned in the book's publicity, and people were allowed to assume that it was a first novel from a previously unknown writer.

The book proved to be an enormous success[6] and established Wyndham as an important exponent of science fiction. During his lifetime, he wrote and published six more novels under the name John Wyndham, and used that name professionally from 1951 forward. Note that his 1959 novel _The Outward Urge_ was credited to John Wyndham and LUCAS PARKES, but "Lucas Parkes" is yet another pseudonym for Wyndham himself.


Personal life

In 1963, he married Grace Isobel Wilson, whom he had known for more than 20 years; the couple remained married until he died. He and Grace lived for several years in separate rooms at the Penn Club, London and later lived near Petersfield, Hampshire, just outside the grounds of Bedales School. A collection of his letters to Grace written during the Second World War are held in the University of Liverpool archive. Wyndham explores the issues around women being forced by their biology to choose between careers and love in _Trouble with Lichen_.


Death

He died in 1969, aged 65, at his home in Petersfield, survived by his wife and his brother.[7] Subsequently, some of his unsold work was published and his earlier work was re-published. His archive was acquired by Liverpool University.[8]

On 24 May 2015 an alley in Hampstead that appears in _The Day of the Triffids_ was formally named Triffid Alley as a memorial to him.[9]

Critical reception

John Wyndham's reputation rests mainly on the first four of the novels published in his lifetime under that name. _The Day of the Triffids_ remains his best-known work, but some readers consider that _The Chrysalids_ was really his best.[10][11]

He also wrote several short stories, ranging from hard science fiction to whimsical fantasy. A few have been filmed: _Consider Her Ways_, _Random Quest_, _Dumb Martian_, _A Long Spoon_, _Jizzle_ (filmed as _Maria_) and _Time to Rest_ (filmed as _No Place Like Earth_).[12] There is also a radio version of _Survival_.

Most of Wyndham's novels are set in the 1950s among middle-class English people. Brian Aldiss, another British science fiction writer, disparagingly labelled some of them "cosy catastrophes", especially _The Day of the Triffids_, but the critic L.J. Hurst pointed out that in _Triffids_ the main character witnesses several murders, suicides and misadventures, and is frequently in mortal danger himself.[13]
