The village of Bathkump was founded by a muslim cleric named Sulaiman Jabbie in the late nineteenth century.[3] Sulaiman Jabbie was a Mandinka trader. Jabbie was an educated and wealthy Muslim merchant. Jabbie fought in battles in defending Bathkump from being invaded by outsiders and he establish complete autonomy in Bathkump. Jabbie establish a madrassa (an Islamic school) in Bathkump and many of the people of Bathkump were encouraged to accept Islam. Due to cleric Sulaiman Jabbie's influence, Muslims soon came to be a majority in the village. This has remained the case years after Sulaiman Jabbie's death.
