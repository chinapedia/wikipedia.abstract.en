NOVIAL [_nov-_ ("new") + _IAL, International Auxiliary Language_] is a constructed international auxiliary language (IAL) for universal communication between speakers of different native languages. It was devised by Otto Jespersen, a Danish linguist who had been involved in the Ido movement, and later in the development of Interlingua de IALA.

Its vocabulary is based largely on the Germanic and Romance languages and its grammar is influenced by English.

Novial was introduced in Jespersen's book _An International Language_ in 1928.[1] It was updated in his dictionary _Novial Lexike_ in 1930,[2] and further modifications were proposed in the 1930s, but the language became dormant with Jespersen's death in 1943.[3] In the 1990s, with the revival of interest in constructed languages brought on by the Internet, some people rediscovered Novial.[4]


_An International Language_

Novial was first described in Jespersen’s book _An International Language_ (1928). Part One of the book discusses the need for an IAL, the disadvantages of ethnic languages for that purpose, and common objections to constructed IALs. He also provides a critical overview of the history of constructed IALs with sections devoted to Volapük, Esperanto, Idiom Neutral, Ido, Latino sine Flexione and Occidental (Interlingue). The author makes it clear that he draws on a wealth of earlier work on the problem of a constructed IAL, not only the aforementioned IALs.

Part Two of _An International Language_ describes Novial in detail. Alternative possible solutions for problems in the phonology, orthography, grammar and vocabulary are considered. The choices made are explained by comparison with ethnic languages and previously constructed IALs.


Alphabet and pronunciation

[TABLE]

: Novial alphabet

-   The letter S occurring among vowels may sound /z/.
-   The letter J may be pronounced /dʒ/.
-   The digraph CH may be pronounced /ʃ/.

Jespersen suggested that it might be possible instead of the digraph SH to use the phonetic symbol ʃ.[5]

In Novial, nominative and oblique pronouns are identical.

The standard word order is subject-verb-object, as in English. Therefore, the object need not be marked to distinguish it from the subject: E.g.:

-   _me observa vu_ – "I observe you"
-   _vu observa me_ – "you observe me"

The accusative (direct object) is therefore most often identical to the nominative (subject). However, in case of an ambiguity problem, an optional accusative ending, _-M'' (_-EM'' after a consonant), is available but is rarely used. The preposition _EM_ is equivalent to this ending.

The personal possessive adjectives are formed from the pronouns by adding _-N_ or after a consonant _-EN_. This is in fact the genitive (possessive) of the pronoun so _men_ means both "my" and "mine" ("of me"): E.g.:

-   "My dog" = Men Hunde
-   "The dog is mine" = Li Hunde es men

Possession may also be expressed with the preposition _DE_: _de me_, _de vu_, and so on.

Verbs

Verb forms never change with person or number. Most verb tenses, moods and voices are expressed with auxiliary verbs preceding the root form of the main verb. The auxiliaries follow the same word order as the English equivalent. The pronouns are indicated with parentheses and are given for example purposes.

Novial clearly distinguishes the passive of becoming and the passive of being. In English the forms are often the same, using the auxiliary verb _to be_ followed by the past participle. However, the passive of becoming is also often expressed with the verb _to get_ which is used in the examples below.

The passive voice of becoming is formed with the auxiliary _BLI_ followed by the root verb form.

Articles

The definite article is _li_ which is invariant. It is used as in English.

There is no indefinite article, although _un_ (one) can be used.

Nouns

The plural noun is formed by adding _–S'' TO THE SINGULAR (_-ES'' after a consonant).

The accusative case is generally identical to the nominative but can optionally be marked with the ending _-M'' (_-EM'' after a consonant) with the plural being _-SEM'' (_-ESEM'' after a consonant) or with the preposition _EM_.

The genitive is formed with the ending _-N'' (_-EN'' after a consonant) with the plural being _-SEN'' (_-ESEN'' after a consonant) or with the preposition _DE_.

Other cases are formed with prepositions.

Adjectives

All adjectives end in _-I_, but this may be dropped if it is easy enough to pronounce and no confusion will be caused. Adjectives precede the noun qualified. Adjectives do not agree with the noun but may be given noun endings if there is no noun present to receive them.

Comparative adjectives are formed by placing various particles (_plu, tam,_ and _min_) in front of the adjective receiving the comparison. Likewise, the superlative particles (_maxim_ and _minim_) precede the adjective. The adjective does not receive an inflection to its ending.

Adverbs

An adjective is converted to a corresponding adverb by adding _-M_ after the _-I_ ending of the adjective.

Comparative and superlative adverbs are formed in the same manner as comparative and superlative adjectives: by placing a specific particle before the adverb receiving the comparison.

Novial compared to Esperanto and Ido

Jespersen was a professional linguist, unlike Esperanto's creator. He disliked the arbitrary and artificial character that he found in Esperanto and Ido. Additionally, he objected to those languages' inflectional systems, which he found needlessly complex. He sought to make Novial at once euphonious and regular while also preserving useful structures from natural languages.

In Novial:

-   Syntax is largely a matter of word order, as in English and modern Scandinavian languages. There is no obligatory accusative marker as in Esperanto, but the accusative may optionally be marked with either an accusative ending or an accusative preposition.
-   A genitive or possessive case is available as an alternative to the preposition _de_. This is based on Jespersen's observation that many modern languages have lost complex noun inflections, yet retain a possessive form.
-   Auxiliary particles express most verb tenses. An inflectional ending is available as a shorthand for the simple past tense.

A major difference between Novial and Esperanto/Ido concerns noun endings. Jespersen rejected a single vowel to terminate all nouns (-o in Esperanto/Ido), finding it unnatural and potentially confusing. Instead, Novial nouns may end in _-o_, _-a_, _-e_, or _-u_ or _-um_. These endings may be taken to indicate natural sex according to the custom in Romance languages. Also there is no grammatical gender or requirement for adjectives to agree with nouns.

Criticism

As Jespersen relates in his autobiography, in 1934 he proposed an orthographic reform to Novial, which displeased a part of the users. Jespersen abandoned the essential principle of _one sound, one letter_ :[6]

Some of Jespersen's colleagues among philologists jokingly referred to Novial as _Jesperanto_, combining his surname with Esperanto, the prototypical auxiliary language.
