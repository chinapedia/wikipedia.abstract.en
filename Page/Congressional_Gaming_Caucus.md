The CONGRESSIONAL GAMING CAUCUS is a Congressional Member Organization within the United States House of Representatives, as approved by the Committee on House Administration.


History of the Caucus

The Congressional Gaming Caucus was originally formed in the 20th Century, as a means for Gambling and Casino Companies to have their voices heard on Congressional Issues. However, since many states at the time had imposed a ban on gambling, the Congressional Caucus went under the name of the Congressional Gaming Caucus. The Caucus was dissolved in the latter half of the 20th Century, but continued to exist informally until it was officially reestablished in 2013 by Rep. Joe Heck (R-NV) and Bennie Thompson (D-MS). The new Congressional Gaming Caucus, while still focusing on gambling and casinos, now has an additional focus on electronic video games and board games.[1][2]


Information and purpose

According to Co-Chair and founding member Joe Heck (R-NV), the purpose of the Congressional Gaming Caucus is to:[3]

-   Address employment and economic issues pertaining to the gaming industry, as well as working with the gaming industry to find solutions.
-   To promote training and skills improvement which can make jobs available to constituents and economically empower gaming communities;
-   Interacting with gaming companies and their representatives to hear their concerns and to share Memberâ€™s concerns
-   Holding Member and staff level meetings on a regular basis to assure the effectiveness, viability, and relevance of the Caucus.


Membership

As of the 115th Congress, the Congressional Gaming Caucus has 12 members.[4] With only 12 members, the Congressional Gaming Caucus is one of the smallest bi-partisan caucuses in the United States Congress.

Controversy

In recent years, the Caucus has received scrutiny from members of the press and public for its connections to the Gambling and Casino industry. Some examples include:

-   In 2007, it was reported that Former Co-Chair of the Congressional Gaming Caucus, Rep. Shelley Berkley (NV-1), received over $161,000 for her 2006 reelection campaign from various gambling and Casino Special Interest Groups.[9]

-   In 2015, the Caucus lobbied the IRS to cancel its plans to lower the tax-reporting threshold for gambling earnings, a ruling intended to prevent tax fraud, despite the IRS receiving over 10,000 signatures requesting the measure to be enacted. In the letter to the Internal Revenue Service, the Caucus stated: _"We strongly believe the IRS should not consider any reduction of this reporting threshold, as any lowering from $1,200 would have significantly negative impacts on casino operations and customers. Any reduction in this threshold would dramatically raise costs to comply, decrease gaming revenue due to more frequent slot machine 'lock-ups,' and would greatly increase the burden workload for IRS."_[10]

-   From 2007 to 2017, Representative Bennie Thompson (MS-2) has received $97,672 from MGM Corporations, and $69,525 from Caesars Entertainment, Inc.[11]

-   From 2007 to 2017, Representative Dina Titus has received $130,050 from MGM Resorts International, and $38,850 from Caesars Entertainment, Inc.[12]

-   From 2007 to 2014, Representative Steven Horsford has received $95,150 from MGM Resorts International, and $24,000 from Boyd Gaming in campaign contributions. [13]
