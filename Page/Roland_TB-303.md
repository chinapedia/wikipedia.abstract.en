The ROLAND TB-303 BASS LINE is a bass synthesizer released by Roland Corporation in 1981. Designed to simulate bass guitars, it was a commercial failure and was discontinued in 1984. However, cheap second-hand units were adopted by electronic musicians, and its "squelching" or "chirping" sound became a foundation of electronic dance music genres such as acid house, Chicago house and techno. It has inspired numerous clones.


Design and features

The TB-303 was designed by Tadao Kikumoto, who also designed the Roland TR-909 drum machine.[1] It was marketed as a "computerised bass machine" to replace the bass guitar.[2] However, according to _Forbes,_ it instead produces a "squelchy tone more reminiscent of a psychedelic mouth harp than a stringed instrument".[3]

The TB-303 has a single oscillator, which produces either a "buzzy" sawtooth wave or a "hollow-sounding" square wave.[4] This is fed into a 24dB[5] low-pass filter, which is manipulated by an envelope generator.[6] Users program notes and slides using a basic sequencer.[7]


Impact and legacy

The 303's unrealistic sound made it unpopular with its target audience, those who wanted to replace bass guitars. It was discontinued in 1984,[8] and Roland sold off remaining units cheaply.[9]

"Rip It Up", by the Scottish post-punk band Orange Juice, which reached #8 in the UK singles chart in February 1983, was the first UK top 10 hit to feature the 303.[10]

Another early use of a TB-303 (in conjunction with a TR-808 drum machine) is Indian musician Charanjit Singh's 1982 album _Synthesizing: Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat._ It remained obscure until the early 21st century, and is now recognized as a precursor to acid.[11]

The Chicago group Phuture bought a cheap 303 and began experimenting.[12][13] By manipulating the synthesizer as it played, they created a unique "squelching, resonant and liquid sound".[14] This became the foundation of "Acid Tracks", which was released in 1987 and created the acid genre.[15] Acid, with the 303 as a staple sound, became popular worldwide, particularly as part of the UK's emerging rave culture known as the second summer of love.[16][17]

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, as new acid styles emerged, the TB-303 was often overdriven, producing a harsher sound, such as on Hardfloor's 1992 EP "Acperience" and Interlect 3000's 1993 EP "Volcano".[18] In other instances the TB-303 was distorted and processed, such as on Josh Wink's 1995 hit "Higher State of Consciousness".[19][20]

As only 10,000 units were manufactured, the popularity of acid caused a dramatic increase in the price of used 303 units.[21] According to the _Guardian_, as of 2014, units sold for over Â£1,000.[22] In 2011, the _Guardian_ listed the release of the TB-303 as one of the 50 key events in the history of dance music.[23] It has inspired numerous clones.[24]
