_VERTICORDIA_ SECT. _SIGALANTHA_ is one of seven sections in the subgenus _Chrysoma_. It includes two species of plants in the genus _Verticordia_. Plants in this section are rigid shrubs with a single main stem and are up to tall. They have golden-yellow flowers with prominent shining petals. The flowers are arranged in corymb-like groups and become pale or grey as they age. The bracteoles fall off the flower as it opens.[1] When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991, he described the section and gave it the name _Sigalantha_.[2][3] The name _Sigalantha_ is derived from the Ancient Greek words _sigaloeis_ meaning "shiny"[4] and _anthos_ meaning "flower"[5] referring to the shiny petals of these species.

The type species for this section is _Verticordia serrata_ and the other species is _V. integra_.[6]
