Reviews

GIAMPIETRO BALIA wrote in the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival catalogue:[11] " A stifling symphony of defeat for human kind as a whole, "Lines" is a necessary film in times in which numbers and ideological yarns dominate the political agenda, much to the disadvantage of the millions of individuals ensnared in a system that has proven to be frail and unreliable." Also in the same festival's OFFICIAL PAGE is written : "Director Vasilis Mazomenos offers a uncompromisingly bleak, ghastly and haunting view of modern Greece in "Lines". Seven chapters about seven broken individuals, about what it means to live in Greece in these hard times of financial restraint".[12] LIINA LAUGESAAR wrote in Cineuropa:[13] "Lines does not focus on the political side of the crisis, but concentrates on the people who had to endure it. Everything extraneous is left out of the story. Mazomenos puts faces back on the numbers and creates a harrowing testament to the challenging years that have left scars on many." ÉLIE CASTIEL wrote in Séquences:[14] "A movie shock, surprising, nocturnal, shouting his rage through seven tables, seven paintings of durations approximately equal, the whole forming a coherent whole despite the side Byzantine intentionally of each Party. Straight lines, circulars, symmetrical, disordered also, as if the logic of the ancient Greece had disappeared for ever"
