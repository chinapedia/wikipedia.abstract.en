The CONFECTIONERY WORKERS' UNION OF AUSTRALIA (CWUA) was an Australian trade union which existed between 1925 and 1992. It represented production workers in the confectionery industry, including many female members.


History

In 1925 the FEDERATED CONFECTIONERS' ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA (FCA) registered with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC). In 1945 it absorbed the _Female Confectioners' Union_, which had been formed in 1916.[1] In 1985 the FCA was involved in the landmark Dollar Sweets Dispute. In 1986 they changed their name to the Confectionery Workers Union of Australia. In 1992 CWUA merged with the Food Preservers Union of Australia to form the _Confectionery Workers & Food Preservers Union of Australia_. This new union then amalgamated with the Automotive Metals & Engineering Union in 1994 to form the Automotive Food Metals & Engineering Union.
