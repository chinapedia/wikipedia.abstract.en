Personal life

She was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, attended the University of Hawaii and graduated from Yenching University in Peking before receiving a master's degree in English literature from Mills College in Oakland, CA. She married Norman Tet Fo Soong, a photo journalist and war correspondent. At the time of the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong she escaped as a refugee with her infant son, Colin, to the war time capital of Nationalist China, Chungking. She returned to Los Angeles after a DC3 flight over the "hump", the Himalyas, to Bombay and then by freighter to Los Angeles. Soong was raised in Honolulu's Chinatown by Cantonese-speaking parents. She loved to read as a child and later wrote poetry as a young woman. She had seven siblings: sisters Pina Lee, Fannie Ching, Janet Lee; and brothers Peter Tam, Paul Tam, James S.T. Tam and Edward S.T. Tam.[1]

She is the mother of one son—Dr. Colin Soong—a physician in Carson City, Nevada. She also had two grandchildren: Tamara Thunder Soong and Andrew Soong. She also has four great-grandchildren: James Benjamin Soong, Ian Thunder, Avery Thunder, and Hannah Soong. Irma taught English at Hwa Nan College in Fuzhou, China, Pomona College in Claremont, California, and Kaimuki High School in Honolulu, Hawaii. She retired from teaching in 1970.

After retiring, Soong was the founder and executive director of the Hawaii Chinese History Center (HCHC) in Honolulu, Hawaii. She established the center on October 31, 1970 and incorporated it on March 17, 1971 with the help of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the United Chinese Society.[2] The goals of the center are to stimulate interest and research about Hawaiian-Chinese history; assist and guide Chinese-Americans in Hawaii to make their experiences available; and collect, inventory, record and preserve historical materials, documents and photographs related to the Chinese in Hawai'i.

Soong died in 2001.[3]
