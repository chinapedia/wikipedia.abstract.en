Running career

High school

Noelle grew up in upstate New York and competed for Greene Central High School. He played soccer for a number of years before focusing on track later in high school. He first drew attention in 2009 when ran 4:21.84 for 1600m as only a sophomore at the New York State Championship.[1] The next year he started working with Robb Munro, a coach at a nearby high school, as his school did not have indoor track or a cross-country team.[2] His first ever high school cross-country race he won the Foot Locker Northeast Regional in 2010 and then placed 10th at the Foot Locker National Championships.[3] He finished his high school career with 5 New York State titles, a 5 time All-American, a win at the 2011 Milrose Games in the mile and a runner-up finish at the 2011 Penn Relays.[4] He set NYS Section 4 records in the 1600m (4:10.54), mile (4:09.02) and 3200m (8:56.02).[5] He also ran 1:53.54 for the 800m.[6]

College

Noelle was highly recruited out of high school and elected to attend the University of Oregon.[7] At Oregon he broke 4 minutes in the mile as a red shirt freshman in 2013 running 3:59.57 at only 19 years old.[8] Outdoors he was an All-American in the 1500m and ran 3:41.09.[9] He also ran 1:49.31 at 800m while competing for Oregon.[10] At the end of 2013 he transferred to Oklahoma State University.

Over the next 3 years at OSU Noelle improved dramatically. He became a 4 time Big 12 Champion, set the school records at 1000m (2:22.55) and the DMR (9:26.60),[11] earned 4 more All-American honors, and helped the Cowboys to multiple Big 12 team titles. In 2015 during the indoor season he ran the mile in 3:57.78 at the Iowa State Classic. That season he anchored the Cowboys to a Big 12 title in the DMR and won the mile. He then placed 5th in the mile at the NCAA Indoor Track Championships. He followed that with an undefeated outdoor season, winning every final he ran in. At the Payton Jordan Invite he ran an impressive 3:38.35, which remained the #1 time in the NCAA that season.[12] He later won the NCAA 1500m title, closing his last lap in under 52 seconds.[13] In 2016 he ran a PR of 7:56.06 in the 3000m[14] then later competed in the 2016 U.S. Olympic Trials but didn't advance past the first round.
