CANNABIS IN GREECE is illegal for recreational purposes. In 2017 medical use of cannabis was legalized, although the law has not yet been implemented.[1]


History

In 1890, Greece outlawed the production and usage of hashish, but the laws were largely ineffective. Cannabis use rose following World War I, as Greek soldiers and refugees from now-Turkish Asia Minor arrived in mainland Greece, bringing the cannabis habit with them. This upsurge faded after World War II due to the substantial death and disorder of the German occupation.[2]


Medical cannabis

In July 2016, the Greek government formed a working group to assess the possibilities of medical cannabis, with a report to be issued in October.[3]

In June 2017, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras announced that a joint ministerial decision regarding the legality of medical cannabis had been made. The decision, published in the Government Gazette, declared the medical use of cannabis to be legal for patients with a doctor's prescription. With the announcement, Tsipras commented "From now on, the country is turning its page, as Greece is now included in countries where the delivery of medical cannabis to patients in need is legal."[4][5]

In March 2018, the Greek Parliament approved a law authorizing the cultivation and production of medical cannabis in Greece.[6]
