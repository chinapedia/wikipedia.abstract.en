The TRAFFORD PARK LINE is a tram line under construction on the Manchester Metrolink network in Greater Manchester, England, running from Pomona to the Trafford Centre. Its name derives from Trafford Park, an area of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, and the first planned industrial estate in the world.


History

Between July and September 2014, Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) conducted a public consultation to build the line.[1][2] In November 2014, TfGM applied for power under the Transport and Works Act 1992 to build and operate the line.[3] In October 2016, power to build the line was granted by the Secretary of State for Transport.[4][5][6][7] Construction commenced in January 2017, and it is expected to be open in 2020.[8][9]


Route description

The line will branch off from the Eccles Line immediately beyond Pomona, where provision was made for a future junction at the south–western end when the viaduct on which it sits was built in the late 1990s. Stops will be built at Wharfside, Imperial War Museum, Village, Parkway, EventCity and the Trafford Centre. Future provision will be made to extend the line to Port Salford.[10]

Crumpsall, on the Bury Line, will eventually become the northern terminus for Trafford Park line services. The line will run from Crumpsall (via the Bury line, city zone and Eccles line) to the Trafford Centre on completion. TfGM announced in July 2017 that works would begin at Crumpsall from 31 July 2017 "in preparation for the new Trafford Park line joining the Metrolink network", and expected completion for this section would be in March 2018.[11]


Rolling stock

No new rolling stock will be required to operate the line; it will absorb capacity within the existing M5000 fleet, provision for the line's operation having been made when finalising the number ordered.[12]
