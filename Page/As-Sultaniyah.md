AS-SULTANIYAH () is a village in the Bint Jbeil District, in southern Lebanon, located just north of Tebnine. It was earlier called _el Yehudiyeh_.


Name

According to E. H. Palmer in 1881, _El Yehûdîyeh_ meant "the Jews" or "Jewish woman."[1]


History

In 1881, it was named _el Yehudiyeh_, and the Palestine Exploration Fund's _Survey of Western Palestine_ (SWP) described it as: "A small village, containing about 100 Metawileh, situated in a valley, with olives, figs, and arable land. There is a spring and cisterns at the village."[2] They further noted that south of the village was a perennial spring, built up with masonry.[3]
