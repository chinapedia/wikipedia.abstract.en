Plot

Saroja and Lalitha are sisters. They always quarrel with each other. Their mother tried her best to pacify them, but couldn't. Mother went sick and died.

Pancharatna Bhagavathar is a Dance and Music teacher. He helps the two sisters. He sends Lalitha to Chennai to continue her education in a college. He finds a job for Saroja at the residence of Bhoopathiya Pillai.

Doctor Sundaram, son of Bhoopathiya Pillai decides to leave the house due to ill-treatment by his step-mother. Saroja talks him into dropping his decision. Sundaram is attracted towards Saroja and wants to marry her.

Lalitha lost her money in Chennai. Vasudevan helps her. But he misbehaves with her. He abandons Lalitha when she gives birth to a child.

Lalitha comes to Saroja's place with the child. Saroja is shocked to see her sister's plight. In order to save the family honour, Saroja leaves the house with Lalitha and goes elsewhere.

Sundaram searches for Saroja and finally finds her. But he sees that she is affectionate with a child. He changes his mind and goes away.

Saroja is in a quandary. She writes a letter to Bhagavathar to come and help them.

How she, with the help of Bhagavathar, finds Vasudevan and unites her sister with him and how she pacifies Sundaram and marries him forms the rest of the story.[2]
