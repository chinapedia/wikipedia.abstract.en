In Norse mythology, ÆGIR (also Aegir) (Old Norse "sea")[1] is a sea jötunn associated with the ocean. He is also known for being a friend of the gods and hosting elaborate parties for them.

He is the namesake for the exoplanet previously known as Epsilon Eridani b.

Ægir's servants are Fimafeng (killed by Loki) and Eldir.


Description

The _Nafnaþulur_ attached _Prose Edda_ list Ægir as a giant.[2] Richard Cleasby and Guðbrandur Vigfússon saw his name as pre-Norse, derived from an ancient Indo-European root.[3]


Attestations

Both _Hversu Noregr byggðist_ and Snorri Sturluson in _Skáldskaparmál_ state that Ægir is the same as the sea-giant HLÉR, who lives on the Hlésey ("Hlér island", modern Danish _Læsø_), and this is borne out by kennings.[4][5] Snorri uses his visiting the Æsir as the frame of that section of the Prose Edda.

In _Lokasenna_, Ægir hosts a party for the gods where he provides the ale brewed in an enormous pot or cauldron provided by Thor and Týr. The story of their obtaining the pot from the giant Hymir is told in _Hymiskviða_.

The prose introduction to _Lokasenna_ and Snorri's list of kennings state that Ægir is also known as Gymir, who is Gerðr's father, but this is evidently an erroneous interpretation of kennings in which different giant-names are used interchangeably.[6]


Family

According to _Fundinn Noregr_, Ægir is a son of the giant Fornjótr, the king of _"Jotlandi, Kvænlandi and Finnlandi"_, and brother of Logi ("fire") and Kári ("wind").[7]

Ægir's wife is Rán. She is mother of the Nine Daughters of Ægir.
