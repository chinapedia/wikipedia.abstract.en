PIERRE LOUIS ANDRÉ FAUVEL (8 October 1866, in Cherbourg – 12 September 1958, in Angers) was a French zoologist, who specialized in the study of _polychaetes_.

He worked as a préparateur of zoology at the faculty of sciences in Caen, and in 1897 received his doctorate at the Sorbonne with a thesis on _Ampharetidae_. During the same year, he became a professor of zoology at the Université Catholique de l'Ouest in Angers, where he remained until his retirement in 1951.[1][2]

The polychaete family _Fauveliopsidae_ bears his name, as does the genera _Fauveliopsis_.[3] Along with his many writings on _Polychaeta_, he was also the author of publications in the fields of physiology and dietetics.[4]
