In abstract algebra, the FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM ON HOMOMORPHISMS, also known as the FUNDAMENTAL HOMOMORPHISM THEOREM, relates the structure of two objects between which a homomorphism is given, and of the kernel and image of the homomorphism.

The homomorphism theorem is used to prove the isomorphism theorems.


Group theoretic version

Given two groups _G_ and _H_ and a group homomorphism _f_ : _G_→_H_, let _K_ be a normal subgroup in _G_ and φ the natural surjective homomorphism _G_→_G_/_K_ (where _G_/_K_ is a quotient group). If _K_ is a subset of ker(_f_) then there exists a unique homomorphism _h_:_G_/_K_→_H_ such that _f_ = _h_ φ.

In other words, the natural projection φ is universal among homomorphisms on _G_ that map _K_ to the identity element.

The situation is described by the following commutative diagram:

By setting _K_ = ker(_f_) we immediately get the first isomorphism theorem.

Similar theorems are valid for monoids, vector spaces, modules, and rings.
