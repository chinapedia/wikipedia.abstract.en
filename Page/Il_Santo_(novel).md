IL SANTO is an Italian novel written by Antonio Fogazzaro and published by Baldini & Castoldi in 1905 in Milan. The novel is the third and last of a trilogy in which _Piccolo Mondo Antico_ is the first and _Piccolo Mondo Moderno_ is the second.[1] Despite the fact that Fogazzaro was a devout and loyal Catholic, _Il Santo_ was listed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.[2] The Vatican's prohibition of this novel helped Fogazzaro achieve a worldwide reputation.[3]


Plot summary

As a sequel to _Piccolo Mondo Moderno_, the novel takes up the story of Piero Maironi.

After a dramatic meeting with Jeanne Dessale, the reformed Maironi (now Benedetto) takes refuge as a monk in a religious community in the mountain village of Jenne and acquires a reputation among the peasants there as a saint who sometimes works miracles of healing. Bendetto calls for a thorough reform of Christian spirituality and thought. Benedetto/Maironi's program of spiritual reform is developed by Fogazzaro from ideas of the Italian philosopher Antonio Rosmini.[4] Benedetto forms with Don Clemente and Professor Giovanni Selva (in whom the critic Jean Lebrec recognizes Friedrich von Hügel, a close friend of Fogazzaro[5]) the nucleus of a latter-day Cénacle who call themselves _Le Catacombe_.

Benedetto goes to Rome and works among the poor of the Trastevere and Testaccio quarters, but then gains notoriety and becomes enmeshed in clerical and anti-clerical politics. Eventually Benedetto meets with Pope Pius X.
