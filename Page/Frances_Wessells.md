In 2016, at its annual Artsie Awards gala at Virginia Repertory Theatre's November Theatre, with local acting/singing star Desirée Roots hosting, the Richmond Theater Critics Circle awarded Wessells the _Liz Marks Memorial Award for Ongoing Contribution to Richmond Area Theater_ for her significant long-term contributions to the Richmond Art Community as a VCU professor of dance performance, choreography, and history. Wessells received the award along with Marie Goodman Hunter, an "African-American actor, singer and educator who helped break down racial barriers in teaching and performance in central Virginia."[8][9][10]


Dance performer

One of her earliest teachers was Hanya Holm.[11]

Wessells performed in the Latin Ballet of Virginia's[12] 2016 production of _The Legend of the Poinsettia_.[13] Her nomination for an Artsie award was announced in 2016 by the _Richmond Times-Dispatch_.[14] Many of her performances have been demonstrations of the healthful importance of agility and strength gained from dancing at any age.[15] She has frequently performed with Robbie Kinter.[16][17] Wessells and Kinter performed _Marda_ in 2008 at the Carpenter Center in Richmond,[18] and in 2012 they participated together in the _10th Annual Richmond Choreographers Showcase_ produced by Starr Foster Dance Project at the Grace Street Theatre in Richmond.[19] Kinter choreographed _Them_, which was performed with Wessells at the Choreographers Showcase at the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center, University of Maryland.[20]

Wessells is the grande dame of Richmond dance. She performed in March 2011 at Paris' Théâtre National de Chaillot. Jason Akira Somma, her 31-year-old dance partner, confirmed that the last of her three performances in Paris brought the audience to tears.[21]
