MICAH (; ) is a given name.

Micah is the name of several people in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), and means "Who is like God?" The name is sometimes found with theophoric extensions. Suffix theophory in _Yah_ and in _Yahweh_ results in MICHAIAH or MICHAIHU (), meaning _who is like Yahweh?_[1] Suffix theophory in _El_ results in _Michael_ (), meaning "who is like god".

In German and Dutch, Micah is spelled and the _ch_ in the name is pronounced either or ; the first is more common in female names, the latter in male names. The name is not as common as Michael or Michiel.
