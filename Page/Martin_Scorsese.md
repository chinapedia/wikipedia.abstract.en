MARTIN CHARLES SCORSESE (,[1][2] ; born November 17, 1942) is an American and naturalized-Italian[3][4] filmmaker and historian, whose career spans more than 50 years. Scorsese's body of work addresses such themes as Italian-American identity (most notably Sicilian), Roman Catholic concepts of guilt and redemption,[5] faith,[6] machismo, modern crime, and gang conflict. Many of his films are also known for their depiction of violence and liberal use of profanity.

Part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmaking, he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and influential filmmakers in cinematic history. In 1990, he founded The Film Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to film preservation, and in 2007 he founded the World Cinema Foundation. He is a recipient of the AFI Life Achievement Award for his contributions to the cinema, and has won an Academy Award, a Palme d'Or, Cannes Film Festival Best Director Award, Silver Lion, Grammy Award, Emmys, Golden Globes, BAFTAs, and Directors Guild of America Awards.

He has directed works such as the crime film _Mean Streets_ (1973), the vigilante-thriller _Taxi Driver_ (1976), the biographical sports drama _Raging Bull_ (1980), the black comedies _The King of Comedy_ (1983), and _After Hours_ (1985), the religious epic drama _The Last Temptation of Christ_ (1988), the crime film _Goodfellas_ (1990), the psychological thriller _Cape Fear_ (1991) and the crime film _Casino_ (1995), some of which he collaborated on with actor and close friend Robert De Niro.[7] Scorsese has also been noted for his successful collaborations with actor Leonardo DiCaprio, having directed him in five films, beginning with _Gangs of New York_ (2002) and most recently _The Wolf of Wall Street_ (2013). Their third film together, _The Departed_ (2006), won Scorsese the Academy Award for Best Director in addition to the film winning the award for Best Picture. Their collaborations have resulted in numerous Academy Award nominations for both as well as them winning several other prestigious awards.

Scorsese's other film work includes the biographical drama _The Aviator_ (2004), the psychological thriller _Shutter Island_ (2010), the historical adventure drama _Hugo_ (2011) and the religious epic _Silence_ (2016). His work in television includes the pilot episodes of the HBO series _Boardwalk Empire_ and _Vinyl_, the latter of which he also co-created. With eight Best Director Oscar nominations, he is the most nominated living director and is tied with Billy Wilder for the second-most nominations overall. As a fan of rock music, he has directed several documentaries on the subject, including _The Last Waltz_ (1978), _No Direction Home_ (2005), _Shine a Light_ (2008), _George Harrison: Living in the Material World_ (2011), and _Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese_ (2019).


Early life

Cuccia-Scorsese-Deseta.jpg, Scorsese and Vittorio De Seta at the 2005 Tribeca Film Festival]]

Scorsese was born on November 17, 1942, in New York City's Queens borough.[8][9] His family moved to Little Italy, before he started school.[10] His father, Charles Scorsese, and mother, Catherine Scorsese (born Cappa), both worked in New York's Garment District. His father was a clothes presser and an actor, and his mother was a seamstress and an actress.[11] His father's parents emigrated from Polizzi Generosa, in the province of Palermo, Sicily, and his maternal grandparents were also from Palermo, precisely from Ciminna. Scorsese was raised in a devoutly Catholic environment.[12] As a boy, he had asthma and could not play sports or do any activities with other children, so his parents and his older brother would often take him to movie theaters; it was at this stage in his life that he developed a passion for cinema. As a teenager in the Bronx, Scorsese frequently rented Powell and Pressburger's _The Tales of Hoffmann_ (1951) from a store that had one copy of the reel. Scorsese was one of only two people who regularly rented that reel; the other was future _Night of the Living Dead_ director George A. Romero.[13]

Scorsese has cited Sabu and Victor Mature as his favorite actors during his youth. He has also spoken of the influence of the 1947 Powell and Pressburger film _Black Narcissus_, whose innovative techniques later impacted his filmmaking.[14] Enamored of historical epics in his adolescence, at least two films of the genre, _Land of the Pharaohs_ and _El Cid_, appear to have had a deep and lasting impact on his cinematic psyche. Scorsese also developed an admiration for neorealist cinema at this time. He recounted its influence in a documentary on Italian neorealism, and commented on how _Bicycle Thieves_ alongside _Paisà_, _Rome, Open City_ inspired him and how this influenced his view or portrayal of his Sicilian roots. In his documentary, _Il Mio Viaggio in Italia_, Scorsese noted that the Sicilian episode of Roberto Rossellini's _Paisà_, which he first saw on television alongside his relatives, who were themselves Sicilian immigrants, made a significant impact on his life.[15] He acknowledges owing a great debt to the French New Wave and has stated that "the French New Wave has influenced all filmmakers who have worked since, whether they saw the films or not."[16] He has also cited filmmakers including Satyajit Ray, Ingmar Bergman, Michelangelo Antonioni, and Federico Fellini as a major influence on his career.[17][18][19][20][21] His initial desire to become a priest, initially attending preparatory seminary but failing after the first year[22] while attending Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx gave way to cinema and consequently, Scorsese enrolled in NYU's Washington Square College (now known as the College of Arts and Science), where he earned a B.A. in English in 1964. He went on to earn his M.F.A. from NYU's School of the Arts (now known as the Tisch School of the Arts) in 1966, a year after the school was founded.[23]


Career

Early career

Scorsese attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts (B.A., English, 1964; M.F.A., film, 1966)[24] making the short films _What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This?_ (1963) and _It's Not Just You, Murray!_ (1964). His most famous short of the period is the darkly comic _The Big Shave_ (1967), which features Peter Bernuth. The film is an indictment of America's involvement in Vietnam, suggested by its alternative title _Viet '67_.[25] Scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at New York University by film professor Haig P. Manoogian.

In 1967, Scorsese made his first feature-length film, the black and white _I Call First_, which was later retitled _Who's That Knocking at My Door_ with his fellow students actor Harvey Keitel and editor Thelma Schoonmaker, both of whom were to become long-term collaborators. This film was intended to be the first of Scorsese's semiautobiographical J. R. Trilogy, which also would have included a later film, _Mean Streets_.

1970s

Scorsese became friends with the influential "movie brats" of the 1970s: Brian De Palma, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.[26] It was Brian De Palma who introduced Scorsese to Robert De Niro. During this period he worked as the assistant director and one of the editors on the documentary _Woodstock_ (1970) and met actor–director John Cassavetes, who would also go on to become a close friend and mentor.

In 1972, Scorsese made the Depression-era exploiter _Boxcar Bertha_ for B-movie producer Roger Corman, who also helped directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, James Cameron, and John Sayles launch their careers.[27] It was Corman who taught Scorsese that entertaining films could be shot with very little money or time, preparing the young director well for the challenges to come with _Mean Streets_. Following the film's release, Cassavetes encouraged Scorsese to make the films that he wanted to make, rather than someone else's projects.

Championed by influential film critic Pauline Kael, _Mean Streets_ was a breakthrough for Scorsese, De Niro, and Keitel. By now the signature Scorsese style was in place: macho posturing, bloody violence, Catholic guilt and redemption, gritty New York locale (though the majority of _Mean Streets_ was actually shot in Los Angeles), rapid-fire editing and a soundtrack with contemporary music. Although the film was innovative, its wired atmosphere, edgy documentary style, and gritty street-level direction owed a debt to directors Cassavetes, Samuel Fuller and early Jean-Luc Godard.[28]

In 1974, actress Ellen Burstyn chose Scorsese to direct her in _Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore_, for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Although well regarded, the film remains an anomaly in the director's early career as it focuses on a central female character. Returning to Little Italy to explore his ethnic roots, Scorsese next came up with _Italianamerican_, a documentary featuring his parents Charles and Catherine Scorsese.

_Taxi Driver_ followed in 1976Scorsese's dark, urban nightmare of one lonely man's slow descent into insanity. The film established Scorsese as an accomplished filmmaker and also brought attention to cinematographer Michael Chapman, whose style tends towards high contrasts, strong colors, and complex camera movements. The film starred Robert De Niro as the troubled and psychotic Travis Bickle. The film co-starred Jodie Foster in a highly controversial role as an underage prostitute, and Harvey Keitel as her pimp, Matthew, called "Sport". _Taxi Driver_ also marked the start of a series of collaborations between Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader, whose influences included the diary of would-be assassin Arthur Bremer and _Pickpocket_, a film by the French director Robert Bresson. Writerdirector Schrader often returns to Bresson's work in films such as _American Gigolo_, _Light Sleeper_, and Scorsese's later _Bringing Out the Dead_.[29] Already controversial upon its release, _Taxi Driver_ hit the headlines again five years later, when John Hinckley Jr. made an assassination attempt on then-president Ronald Reagan. He subsequently blamed his act on his obsession with Jodie Foster's _Taxi Driver_ character (in the film, De Niro's character, Travis Bickle, makes an assassination attempt on a senator).[30] _Taxi Driver_ won the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival,[31] also receiving four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture.

The critical and financial success of _Taxi Driver_ encouraged Scorsese to move ahead with his first big-budget project: the highly stylized musical _New York, New York_. This tribute to Scorsese's home town and the classic Hollywood musical was a box-office failure. The film was the director's third collaboration with Robert De Niro, co-starring with Liza Minnelli. The film is best remembered today for the title theme song, which was popularized by Frank Sinatra. Although possessing Scorsese's usual visual panache and stylistic bravura, many critics felt its enclosed studio-bound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison with his earlier work. Despite its weak reception, the film is positively regarded by some critics. Richard Brody in _The New Yorker_ wrote:

The disappointing reception that _New York, New York_ received drove Scorsese into depression. By this stage the director had also developed a serious cocaine addiction. However, he did find the creative drive to make the highly regarded _The Last Waltz_, documenting the final concert by The Band. It was held at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, and featured one of the most extensive lineups of prominent guest performers at a single concert, including Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Ringo Starr, Muddy Waters, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Paul Butterfield, Neil Diamond, Ronnie Wood, and Eric Clapton. However, Scorsese's commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978.

Other works in 1970s

Another Scorsese-directed documentary, titled _American Boy_, also appeared in 1978, focusing on Steven Prince, the cocky gun salesman who appeared in _Taxi Driver_. A period of wild partying followed, damaging the director's already fragile health. Scorsese also helped provide footage for the documentary _Elvis on Tour_. In 1977 he directed the Broadway musical _The Act_, starring Liza Minnelli.[32]

1980s

By several accounts (Scorsese's included), Robert De Niro practically saved Scorsese's life when he persuaded Scorsese to kick his cocaine addiction to make his highly regarded film _Raging Bull_. Convinced that he would never make another movie, he poured his energies into making this violent biopic of middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta, calling it a kamikaze method of film-making.[33] The film is widely viewed as a masterpiece and was voted the greatest film of the 1980s by Britain's _Sight & Sound_ magazine.[34][35] It received eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Robert De Niro, and Scorsese's first for Best Director. De Niro won, as did Thelma Schoonmaker for editing, but Best Director went to Robert Redford for _Ordinary People_. From this work onwards, Scorsese's films are always labeled as "A Martin Scorsese Picture" on promotional material. _Raging Bull_, filmed in high contrast black and white, is where Scorsese's style reached its zenith: _Taxi Driver_ and _New York, New York_ had used elements of expressionism to replicate psychological points of view, but here the style was taken to new extremes, employing extensive slow-motion, complex tracking shots, and extravagant distortion of perspective (for example, the size of boxing rings would change from fight to fight).[36] Thematically too, the concerns carried on from _Mean Streets_ and _Taxi Driver_: insecure males, violence, guilt, and redemption.

Although the screenplay for _Raging Bull_ was credited to Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin (who earlier co-wrote _Mean Streets_), the finished script differed extensively from Schrader's original draft. It was rewritten several times by various writers including Jay Cocks (who went on to co-script later Scorsese films _The Age of Innocence_ and _Gangs of New York_). The final draft was largely written by Scorsese and Robert De Niro.[37] The American Film Institute chose _Raging Bull_ as the No. 1 American sports film on their list of the top 10 sports films. In 1997, the Institute ranked _Raging Bull_ as the 24th greatest film of all time on their AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list. In 2007, they ranked _Raging Bull_ as the 4th greatest film of all time on their AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) list.

Scorsese's next project was his fifth collaboration with Robert De Niro, _The King of Comedy_ (1983). It is a satire on the world of media and celebrity, whose central character is a troubled loner who ironically becomes famous through a criminal act (kidnapping).[38] The film was an obvious departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with. Visually, it was far less kinetic than the style Scorsese had previously developed, often using a static camera and long takes.[39] The expressionism of his previous work, here gave way to moments of almost total surrealism. It still bore many of Scorsese's trademarks, however. The _King of Comedy_ failed at the box office, but has become increasingly well regarded by critics in the years since its release. German director Wim Wenders numbered it among his 15 favorite films.[40]

With _After Hours_ (1985), Scorsese made an aesthetic shift back to a pared-down, almost "underground" film-making style. Filmed on an extremely low budget, on location, and at night in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild New York word processor (Griffin Dunne) and featured cameos by such disparate actors as Teri Garr and Cheech and Chong.

Along with the 1987 Michael Jackson music video "Bad", in 1986 Scorsese made _The Color of Money_, a sequel to the much admired Robert Rossen film _The Hustler_ (1961) with Paul Newman, which co-starred Tom Cruise. Although adhering to Scorsese's established style, _The Color of Money_ was the director's first official foray into mainstream film-making. The film finally won actor Paul Newman an Oscar and gave Scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a longtime goal for him: _The Last Temptation of Christ_.

In 1983, Scorsese began work on a long-cherished personal project, _The Last Temptation of Christ_, based on the 1951 novel written by Nikos Kazantzakis that retold the life of Christ in human rather than divine terms. Barbara Hershey recalls introducing Scorsese to the book while they were filming _Boxcar Bertha_.[41] The film was slated to shoot under the Paramount Pictures banner, but shortly before principal photography was to commence, Paramount pulled the plug on the project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version, Aidan Quinn was cast as Jesus, and Sting was cast as Pontius Pilate. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played respectively by Willem Dafoe and David Bowie.) However, following his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal filmmaking with the project, which was ultimately released in 1988. Even prior to its release, the film (adapted by _Taxi Driver_ and _Raging Bull_ veteran Paul Schrader) caused a massive furor, with worldwide protests against its perceived blasphemy effectively turning a low-budget independent film into a media sensation.[42] Most controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family with Mary Magdalene in a Satan-induced hallucination while on the cross.

Looking past the controversy, _The Last Temptation of Christ_ gained critical acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese's canon: an explicit attempt to wrestle with the spirituality underpinning his films up until that point. The director went on to receive his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing to Barry Levinson for _Rain Man_).

Other works in 1980s

Scorsese made a brief cameo appearance in the film _Anna Pavlova_ (also known as _A Woman for All Time_), originally intended to be directed by one of his heroes, Michael Powell. This led to a more significant role in Bertrand Tavernier's jazz film _Round Midnight_. He also made a brief venture into television, directing an episode of Steven Spielberg's _Amazing Stories_.

Along with directors Woody Allen and Francis Ford Coppola, in 1989 Scorsese provided one of three segments in the portmanteau film _New York Stories_, called "Life Lessons".

1990s

After a decade of mostly mixed results, gangster epic _Goodfellas_ (1990) was a return to form for Scorsese and his most confident and fully realized film since _Raging Bull_. De Niro and Joe Pesci offered a virtuoso display of the director's bravura cinematic technique in the film and re-established, enhanced, and consolidated his reputation. After the film was released Roger Ebert, a friend and supporter of Scorsese, named _Goodfellas_ "the best mob movie ever" and is ranked No. 1 on Roger's movie list for 1990, along with Gene Siskel and Peter Travers, the film is widely considered one of the director's greatest achievements.[43][44][45] The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Scorsese earned his third Best Director nomination for _Goodfellas_ but again lost to a first-time director, Kevin Costner (_Dances with Wolves_). Joe Pesci earned the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in _Goodfellas_. Scorsese and the film won numerous awards, including five BAFTA Awards, a Silver Lion and more. The American Film Institute put _Goodfellas_ at No. 94 on the AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list. On the 2007 updated version, they moved _Goodfellas_ up to No. 92 on the AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list (10th Anniversary Edition) and they put _Goodfellas_ at No. 2 on their list of the top 10 gangster films (after _The Godfather_).

In 1990, he also released his only short-form documentary: _Made in Milan_ about fashion designer Giorgio Armani. The following year brought _Cape Fear_, a remake of a cult 1962 movie of the same name and the director's seventh collaboration with De Niro. Another foray into the mainstream, the film was a stylized thriller taking its cues heavily from Alfred Hitchcock and Charles Laughton's _The Night of the Hunter_ (1955). _Cape Fear_ received a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depicting misogynistic violence. However, the lurid subject matter gave Scorsese a chance to experiment with visual tricks and effects. The film garnered two Oscar nominations. Earning $80 million domestically, it stood as Scorsese's most commercially successful release until _The Aviator_ (2004), and then _The Departed_ (2006). The film also marked the first time Scorsese used wide-screen Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.

_The Age of Innocence_ (1993) was a significant departure for Scorsese, a period adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel about the constrictive high society of late-19th century New York. It was highly lauded by critics upon original release, but was a box office bomb, making an overall loss. As noted in _Scorsese on Scorsese_ by editor–interviewer Ian Christie, the news that Scorsese wanted to make a film about a failed 19th-century romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity; all the more when Scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio for-hire job.

Scorsese was interested in doing a "romantic piece". His friend Jay Cocks gave him the Wharton novel in 1980, suggesting that this should be the romantic piece Scorsese should film as Cocks felt it best represented his sensibility. In _Scorsese on Scorsese_ he noted that

Scorsese, who was strongly drawn to the characters and the story of Wharton's text, wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book was to him rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works. To this aim, Scorsese sought influence from diverse period films that made an emotional impact on him. In _Scorsese on Scorsese_, he documents influences from films such as Luchino Visconti's _Senso_ and his _Il Gattopardo_ as well as Orson Welles's _The Magnificent Ambersons_ and also Roberto Rossellini's _La prise de pouvoir par Louis XIV_. Although _The Age of Innocence_ was ultimately different from these films in terms of narrative, story, and thematic concern, the presence of a lost society, of lost values as well as detailed re-creations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films. It came back into the public eye, especially in countries such as the UK and France, but still is largely neglected in North America. The film earned five Academy Award nominations (including for Scorsese for Best Adapted Screenplay), winning the Costume Design Oscar. This was his first collaboration with the Academy Award–winning actor Daniel Day-Lewis, with whom he would work again in _Gangs of New York_.

_Casino (1995)_, like _The Age of Innocence_ before it, focused on a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is disrupted by the arrival of unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to fans of the director who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. _Casino_ was a box office success,[46] but the film received mixed notices from critics. In large part this was due to its huge stylistic similarities to his earlier _Goodfellas_, and its excessive violence that garnered it a reputation as possibly the most violent American gangster film ever made. Indeed, many of the tropes and tricks of the earlier film resurfaced more or less intact, most obviously the casting of both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Pesci once again playing an unbridled psychopath. Sharon Stone was nominated for the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance. During the filming Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.

Scorsese still found time for a four-hour documentary in 1995, titled _A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies_, offering a thorough trek through American cinema. It covered the silent era to 1969, a year after which Scorsese began his feature career, stating, "I wouldn't feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries." In the four-hour documentary, Scorsese lists the four aspects of the director he believes are the most important as (1) the director as storyteller; (2) the director as an illusionist: D.W. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on; (3) the director as a smuggler—filmmakers such as Douglas Sirk, Samuel Fuller, and Vincente Minnelli, who used to hide subversive messages in their films; and (4) the director as iconoclast.

If _The Age of Innocence_ alienated and confused some fans, then _Kundun_ (1997) went several steps further, offering an account of the early life of Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, the People's Liberation Army's entering of Tibet, and the Dalai Lama's subsequent exile to India. Not least a departure in subject matter, _Kundun_ also saw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach. Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaborate tableau of colorful visual images.[47] The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor, Buena Vista Pictures, which was planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurting _Kundun_{{'}}s commercial profile. In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director's reputation. In the long term, however, it generally appears _Kundun_ has been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour. _Kundun_ was the director's second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader, following _The Last Temptation of Christ_.

_Bringing Out the Dead_ (1999) was a return to familiar territory, with the director and writer Paul Schrader constructing a pitch-black comic take on their own earlier _Taxi Driver_.[48] Like previous Scorsese–Schrader collaborations, its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recalled the films of Robert Bresson.[49] (It is also worth noting that the film's incident-filled nocturnal setting is reminiscent of _After Hours_.) It received generally positive reviews,[50] although not the universal critical acclaim of some of his other films. It stars Nicolas Cage, Ving Rhames, John Goodman, Tom Sizemore, and Patricia Arquette.

Other works in 1990s

In 1990, Scorsese acted in a small role as Vincent van Gogh in the film _Dreams_ by Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. Scorsese's 1994 cameo appearance in the Robert Redford film _Quiz Show_ is remembered for the telling line: "You see, the audience didn't tune in to watch some amazing display of intellectual ability. They just wanted to watch the money." De Fina-Cappa was the production company he formed that same year with producer Barbara De Fina.[51]

Since the 1990s, Scorsese has increased his role as a film producer. Scorsese produced a wide range of films, including major Hollywood studio productions (_Mad Dog and Glory_, _Clockers_), low-budget independent films (_The Grifters_, _Naked in New York_, _Grace of My Heart_, _Search and Destroy_, _The Hi-Lo Country_), and even foreign film (_Con gli occhi chiusi_).

2000s

In 1999, Scorsese also produced a documentary on Italian filmmakers titled _Il Mio Viaggio in Italia_, also known as _My Voyage to Italy_. The documentary foreshadowed the director's next project, the epic _Gangs of New York_ (2002), influenced by (amongst many others) major Italian directors such as Luchino Visconti and filmed in its entirety at Rome's famous Cinecittà film studios.

With a production budget said to be in excess of $100 million, _Gangs of New York_ was Scorsese's biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. Like _The Age of Innocence_, it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing on the other end of the social scale (and like that film, also starring Daniel Day-Lewis). The film also marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who since then has become a fixture in later Scorsese films. The production was highly troubled, with many rumors referring to the director's conflict with Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein.[52] Despite denials of artistic compromise, _Gangs of New York_ revealed itself to be the director's most conventional film: standard film tropes that the director had traditionally avoided, such as characters existing purely for exposition purposes and explanatory flashbacks, here surfaced in abundance.[53][54][55] The original score composed by regular Scorsese collaborator Elmer Bernstein was rejected at a late stage for a score by Howard Shore and mainstream rock artists U2 and Peter Gabriel.[56]

The final cut of the movie ran to 168 minutes, while the director's original cut was over 180 minutes in length.[57] The film still received generally positive reviews with the review tallying website Rotten Tomatoes reporting that 75 percent of the reviews they tallied for the film were positive and summarizing the critics by saying, "Though flawed, the sprawling, messy _Gangs of New York_ is redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis's electrifying performance."[58] The themes central to the film were consistent with the director's established concerns: New York, violence as culturally endemic, and subcultural divisions down ethnic lines. Originally filmed for a release in the winter of 2001 (to qualify for Academy Award nominations), Scorsese delayed the final production of the film until after the beginning of 2002; the studio consequently delayed the film for nearly a year until its release in the Oscar season of late 2002.[59] _Gangs of New York_ earned Scorsese his first Golden Globe for Best Director. In February 2003, _Gangs of New York_ received 10 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Daniel Day-Lewis; however, it did not win in any category.

The following year, Scorsese completed production of _The Blues_, an expansive seven-part documentary tracing the history of blues music from its African roots to the Mississippi Delta and beyond. Seven film-makers including Wim Wenders, Clint Eastwood, Mike Figgis, and Scorsese himself each contributed a 90-minute film (Scorsese's entry was titled "Feel Like Going Home").

Martin_Scorsese_at_the_65th_Annual_Peabody_Awards.jpg Scorsese's film _The Aviator_ (2004) is a lavish, large-scale biopic of eccentric aviation pioneer and film mogul Howard Hughes and reunited Scorsese with actor Leonardo DiCaprio. The film received highly positive reviews.[60][61][62][63][64] The film also met with widespread box office success and gained Academy recognition.

_The Aviator_ was nominated for six Golden Globe awards, including Best Motion Picture—Drama, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor—Motion Picture Drama for Leonardo DiCaprio. It won three, including Best Motion Picture—Drama and Best Actor—Motion Picture Drama. In January 2005 _The Aviator_ became the most-nominated film of the 77th Academy Awards nominations, nominated in 11 categories including Best Picture. The film also garnered nominations in nearly all of the other major categories, including a fifth Best Director nomination for Scorsese, Best Actor in a Leading Role (Leonardo DiCaprio), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Cate Blanchett), and Alan Alda for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Despite having a leading tally, the film ended up with only five Oscars: Best Actress in a Supporting Role, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography. Scorsese lost again, this time to director Clint Eastwood for _Million Dollar Baby_ (which also won Best Picture).

_No Direction Home_ is a documentary film by Martin Scorsese that tells of the life of Bob Dylan, and his impact on American popular music and culture of the 20th century. The film does not cover Dylan's entire career; it focuses on his beginnings, his rise to fame in the 1960s, his then-controversial transformation from an acoustic guitar–based musician and performer to an electric guitar–influenced sound and his "retirement" from touring in 1966 following an infamous motorcycle accident. The film was first presented on television in both the United States (as part of the PBS _American Masters_ series) and the United Kingdom (as part of the BBC Two _Arena_ series) on September 26 to 27, 2005. A DVD version of the film was released that same month. The film won a Peabody Award and the Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video. In addition, Scorsese received an Emmy nomination for it.

Martin_Scorsese_by_David_Shankbone.jpg in 2007]] Scorsese returned to the crime genre with the Boston-set thriller _The Departed_, based on the Hong Kong police drama _Infernal Affairs_ (which is co-directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak). The film continued Scorsese's collaboration streak with Leonardo DiCaprio, and was his first collaboration with Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, and Martin Sheen.

_The Departed_ opened to widespread critical acclaim, with some proclaiming it as one of the best efforts Scorsese had brought to the screen since 1990s _Goodfellas_,[65][66] and still others putting it at the same level as Scorsese's most celebrated classics _Taxi Driver_ and _Raging Bull_.[67][68] With domestic box office receipts surpassing million, _The Departed_ was Scorsese's highest-grossing film (not accounting for inflation) until 2010's _Shutter Island_.

Martin Scorsese's direction of _The Departed_ earned him his second Golden Globe for Best Director, as well as a Critics' Choice Award, his first Directors Guild of America Award, and the Academy Award for Best Director. While being presented with the award, Scorsese poked fun at his previous track record of nominations, asking "Could you double-check the envelope?" It was presented to him by his longtime friends and colleagues Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg. _The Departed_ also received the Academy Award for the Best Motion Picture of 2006, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing by longtime Scorsese editor Thelma Schoonmaker, her third win for a Scorsese film.

_Shine a Light_ is a concert film of rock and roll band The Rolling Stones' performances at New York City's Beacon Theater on October 29 and November 1, 2006, intercut with brief news and interview footage from throughout the band's career.

The film marked the fifth collaboration between Scorsese and DiCaprio and the second between Scorsese and Winter after _Boardwalk Empire_. It was released on December 25, 2013.

The film tells the story of a New York stockbroker, played by DiCaprio, who engages in a large securities fraud case involving corruption on Wall Street, stock manipulation, namely the practice of "pump and dump" and the corporate banking world. DiCaprio was given the award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at the 2014 Golden Globe Awards, with the film being nominated for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy as well. Also, _The Wolf of Wall Street_ was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Leonardo DiCaprio, Best Supporting Actor for Jonah Hill, Best Director for Martin Scorsese, and Best Adapted Screenplay for Terence Winter but did not win in any category.[86] In a 2016 critics' poll conducted by BBC, the film was ranked one of the 100 greatest motion pictures since 2000.[87]

Scorsese and David Tedeschi made a documentary about the history of the _New York Review of Books_, titled _The 50 Year Argument_.

Scorsese directed _The Audition_, a short film that also served as a promotional piece for casinos Studio City in Macau and City of Dreams in Manila, Philippines. The short brought together Scorsese's long-time muses Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro for the first time under his direction. The short film featured the two actors, playing fictionalized versions of themselves, competing for a role in Scorsese's next film. It was Scorsese's first collaboration with De Niro in two decades.[98] The film premiered in October 2015 in conjunction with the grand opening of Studio City.[99]

Scorsese directed the pilot for _Vinyl_ written by Terence Winter and George Mastras, with Mick Jagger producing and Mastras as showrunner. The series stars Bobby Cannavale as Richie Finestra, founder and president of a top-tier record label, set in 1970s New York City's drug-and sex-fueled music business as punk and disco were breaking out, all told through the eyes of Finestra trying to resurrect his label and find the next new sound. On July 25, 2014, Mick Jagger tweeted from the set, confirming that the filming had started.[100] Co-stars include Ray Romano, Olivia Wilde, Juno Temple, Andrew Dice Clay, Ato Essandoh, Max Casella, and James Jagger. On December 2, 2014, _Vinyl_ was picked up by HBO.[101] The series lasted one season.

Scorsese has long anticipated filming an adaptation of Shūsaku Endō's novel _Silence_, a drama about the lives of two Portuguese Jesuit priests in Japan during the 17th century. Scorsese had originally planned _Silence_ as his next project following _Shutter Island._[102] On April 19, 2013, financing was secured for _Silence_ by Emmett/Furla Films,[103] and filming began in January 2015. By November 2016, the film had completed post-production. It was written by Jay Cocks and Scorsese, based on the novel, and stars Andrew Garfield, Liam Neeson, and Adam Driver.[104] The film was released on December 23, 2016.[105][106]

On January 10, 2019, Chris Willman from _Variety_ reported that the long-anticipated documentary of Bob Dylan's 1975 tour, the Rolling Thunder Revue, would be released by Netflix: "_Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese_ captures the troubled spirit of America in 1975 and the joyous music that Dylan performed during the fall of that year. Part documentary, part concert film, part fever dream, 'Rolling Thunder' is a one of a kind experience, from master filmmaker Martin Scorsese."[107] On April 25, 2019 it was announced that the documentary would be released on Netflix on June 12, 2019 with a concurrent theatrical engagement in twenty American, European, and Australian cities the night before and an extended theatrical schedule in Los Angeles and New York so that the film will qualify for award consideration: "The June 11 "road show" screenings will take place in London, Paris, Washington, D.C., Nashville, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Boston, Austin, Dallas, Houston, Portland, Tulsa, Tempe, Chicago, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Bologna and Sydney—as well as in L.A. and New York, the two cities where the film will continue to play the following day and beyond."[108] Later, Milwaukee, Wisconsin's Oriental Theatre was added as a venue for the June 11, 2019 screening.[109]

He also acted as executive producer of several indie films, likes _The Third Side of the River_ (directed by Scorsese's protege Celina Murga), _Revenge of the Green Dragons_ (co-directed by Andrew Lau, whose film _Infernal Affairs_ inspired _The Departed_),[110] _Bleed for This_ and _Free Fire_.[111]

Future films

After years of development, principal photography on Scorsese's film _The Irishman_ began in August 2017, starring Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino.[112] He had also reported that his long-planned Frank Sinatra biopic was coming up, with Phil Alden Robinson writing the screenplay.[113] However, while promoting _Silence_, Scorsese confirmed that the Sinatra biopic had been cancelled due to a lack of support from the Sinatra estate.[114]

In March 2015, it was reported that Scorsese will direct a Mike Tyson biopic. The film is set to star Oscar-winning actor Jamie Foxx to play Tyson. Foxx mentioned that, "This will be the first boxing movie that Martin Scorsese has done since _Raging Bull_." The Mike Tyson film that Terence Winter (_The Wolf of Wall Street_, _Boardwalk Empire_) is penning will cover the full breadth of his career, reportedly using the aging technology deployed in David Fincher's _The Curious Case of Benjamin Button_.[115] It has since been announced that Scorsese will instead produce, rather than direct the project.[116] On August 10, 2015, it was announced that Scorsese will direct an adaptation of _The Devil in the White City_, which will star Leonardo DiCaprio and be written by Billy Ray,[117] which was revived in 2019, since Hulu began developing a series based on the book. Leonardo DiCaprio and Scorsese will executive produce the project along with Stacey Sher, Rick Yorn, Emma Koskoff, and Jennifer Davisson. Paramount Television will produce.[118]

_Variety_ reported in January 2016 that Scorsese is also producing a biopic based on the life of classical pianist Byron Janis, with Peter Glanz writing a screenplay based on Janis' own book, _Chopin and Beyond: My Extraordinary Life in Music and the Paranormal_. Paramount Pictures will distribute the film.[119]

On April 29, 2016, it was announced that Scorsese was in early talks to direct _The General_, a film based on the life of George Washington, in which he hopes to get Leonardo DiCaprio on board.[120][121] He has also expressed interest in directing an adaptation of _Home_, the 2008 novel by Marilynne Robinson.[122] In July 2017 it was reported that Scorsese and DiCaprio were working on a possible film adaptation of the book _Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI_, which investigates the murders of wealthy Osage people in Oklahoma in the early 1920s. In September 2017, Scorsese and DiCaprio were also reported to be developing a biopic in which DiCaprio will portray President Theodore Roosevelt.[123]

On August 23, 2017, it was reported that Scorsese would be producing a Joker origin story, to be directed by Todd Phillips.[124] Meant to be a "gritty and grounded hard-boiled crime film" in Gotham City in the early '80s, the movie was reportedly intended to feel like no other iteration of the DC comic universe.[125] In July 2018, it was announced that Scorsese is no longer involved with the project.[126]


Personal life

Scorsese has been married five times. His first wife was Laraine Marie Brennan; they have a daughter, Catherine. He married the writer Julia Cameron in 1976; they have a daughter (Domenica Cameron-Scorsese, who is an actress and appeared in _The Age of Innocence_), but the marriage lasted only a year. The divorce was acrimonious and served as the basis of Cameron's first feature, the dark comedy _God's Will_,[127] which also starred their daughter, Domenica.[128][129] Their daughter also had a small role in _Cape Fear_ using the name Domenica Scorsese and has continued to act, write, direct, and produce.[130] Scorsese was married to actress Isabella Rossellini from 1979 to their divorce in 1983.[131] He then married producer Barbara De Fina in 1985; their marriage ended in divorce in 1991, as well. From 1989 until 1997, he dated actress Illeana Douglas.[132] Scorsese has been married to Helen Schermerhorn Morris since 1999. They have a daughter, Francesca, who appeared in _The Departed_ and _The Aviator_. He lives and works in New York City.

Scorsese has commented, "I'm a lapsed Catholic. But I am Roman Catholic; there's no way out of it."[133] In 2010, _The Wall Street Journal_ reported that Scorsese was supporting the David Lynch Foundation's initiative to help 10,000 military veterans overcome posttraumatic stress disorder through Transcendental Meditation,[134] and Scorsese has publicly discussed his own practice of TM.[135]

In 2009, Scorsese signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski, calling for his release from custody after he was detained in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges.[136]

Scorsese was recognized as an Italian citizen by birth in 2018.[137]

Themes and style

Scorsese is known for his frequent use of slow motion, for example, in _Who's That Knocking at My Door_ (1967) and _Mean Streets_ (1973).[160] Also known for using freeze frame, such as the opening credits of _The King of Comedy_ (1983), and throughout _Goodfellas_ (1990). Such a shot is also used in _Casino_ (1995) and _The Departed_ (2006). His blonde leading ladies are usually seen through the eyes of the protagonist as angelic and ethereal; they wear white in their first scene and are photographed in slow motion (Cybill Shepherd in _Taxi Driver_; Cathy Moriarty's white bikini in _Raging Bull_; Sharon Stone's white minidress in _Casino_).[161] This may possibly be a nod to director Alfred Hitchcock.[162] Scorsese often uses long tracking shots,[163] as seen in _Taxi Driver_, _Goodfellas_, _Casino_, _Gangs of New York_, and _Hugo_. Use of MOS sequences set to popular music or voice-over, often involving aggressive camera movement and/or rapid editing.[164] Scorsese sometimes highlights characters in a scene with an iris, an homage to 1920s silent film cinema (as scenes at the time sometimes used this transition). This effect can be seen in _Casino_ (it is used on Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci), _Life Lessons_, _The Departed_ (on Matt Damon), and _Hugo_. Some of his films include references/allusions to Westerns, particularly _Rio Bravo_, _The Great Train Robbery_, _Shane_, _The Searchers_, and _The Oklahoma Kid_. Slow motion flashbulbs and accented camera/flash/shutter sounds are often used, as is song "Gimme Shelter" by The Rolling Stones; heard in several of Scorsese's films: _Goodfellas_, _Casino_, and _The Departed_.

Usually has a quick cameo in his films (_Who's That Knocking at My Door_, _Boxcar Bertha_, _Mean Streets_, _Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore_, _Taxi Driver_, _The King of Comedy_, _After Hours_, _The Last Temptation of Christ_ (albeit hidden under a hood), _The Age of Innocence_, _Gangs of New York_, _Hugo_). Also, often contributes his voice to a film without appearing on screen (e.g. as in _The Aviator_ and _The Wolf of Wall Street_). He provides the opening voice-over narration in _Mean Streets_ and _The Color of Money_; plays the off-screen dressing room attendant in the final scene of _Raging Bull_; provides the voice of the unseen ambulance dispatcher in _Bringing Out the Dead_.[165]

More recently, his films have featured corrupt authority figures, such as policemen in _The Departed_[166] and politicians in _Gangs of New York_[167] and _The Aviator_.[168] Guilt is a prominent theme in many of his films, as is the role of Catholicism in creating and dealing with guilt (_Who's That Knocking at My Door_, _Mean Streets_, _Raging Bull_, _Bringing Out the Dead_, _The Departed_, _Shutter Island_). He has also been known for his liberal usage of profanity, dark humor, and violence.[169]

Frequent collaborators

Scorsese often casts the same actors in his films, particularly Robert De Niro, who collaborated with Scorsese for eight feature films and one short film. Included are the three films (_Taxi Driver_, _Raging Bull_, and _Goodfellas_) that made AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list. Scorsese has often said he thinks De Niro's best work under his direction was Rupert Pupkin in _The King of Comedy_. After the turn of the century, Scorsese found a new muse with younger actor Leonardo DiCaprio, collaborating for five feature films to date, along with one short.[170] Several critics have compared Scorsese's new partnership with DiCaprio with his previous one with De Niro.[171][172] Frequent collaborators also include Victor Argo (6), Harry Northup (6), Harvey Keitel (5), Murray Moston (5), J. C. MacKenzie (3), Joe Pesci (3), Frank Vincent (3) and Verna Bloom (3). Others who have appeared in multiple Scorsese films include Daniel Day-Lewis, who had become very reclusive to the Hollywood scene, Alec Baldwin, Ben Kingsley, Jude Law, Emily Mortimer, John C. Reilly, Frank Sivero, Ray Winstone and Nick Nolte. Before their deaths, Scorsese's parents, Charles Scorsese and Catherine Scorsese, appeared in bit parts, walk-ons or supporting roles, most notably in _Goodfellas_.

For his crew, Scorsese frequently worked with editor Thelma Schoonmaker,[173] cinematographers Michael Ballhaus,[174] Robert Richardson, Michael Chapman and Rodrigo Prieto, screenwriters Paul Schrader, Mardik Martin, and John Logan, costume designer Sandy Powell, production designer Dante Ferretti, music producer Robbie Robertson, and composers Howard Shore[175] and Elmer Bernstein.[176] Schoonmaker, Richardson, Powell, and Ferretti have all won Academy Awards in their respective categories on collaborations with Scorsese. Elaine and Saul Bass, the latter being Hitchcock's frequent title designer, designed the opening credits for _Goodfellas_, _The Age of Innocence_, _Casino_ and _Cape Fear_. He was the executive producer of the film _Brides_, which was directed by Pantelis Voulgaris and starred Victoria Haralabidou, Damian Lewis, Steven Berkoff, and Kosta Sommer.
