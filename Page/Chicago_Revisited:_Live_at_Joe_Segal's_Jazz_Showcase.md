_CHICAGO REVISITED: LIVE AT JOE SEGAL'S JAZZ SHOWCASE_ is a live album by American jazz pianist Ahmad Jamal featuring performances recorded in Chicago in 1992 and released on the Telarc label.[1]


Critical reception

In his review for Allmusic Scott Yanow states: "Although it had been more than 40 years since his debut recording, pianist Ahmad Jamal's playing was as viable as ever in the 1990s. Teamed up with bassist John Heard and drummer Yoron Israel for this live Telarc CD, Jamal plays a particularly inspired repertoire that includes "All the Things You Are," Clifford Brown's "Daahoud," John Handy's "Dance to the Lady" and "Be My Love" among its nine selections. Jamal's style had developed since his early days, but his basic approach was unchanged while still sounding quite fresh. This date is an excellent example of Ahmad Jamal's unique sound and highly appealing music in the '90s.".[2]
