_GENERATION OF VIPERS_ is a 1943 book by Philip Wylie. In it Wylie criticizes various aspects and beliefs of contemporary American society, including Christianity; prominent figures such as politicians, teachers, and doctors;[1] and "momism" or the adoration of mothers. Dalkey Archive Press publishes the book.[2]


History

Wylie wrote the book in Miami Beach, Florida beginning on May 12, 1942 and ending on July 4, 1942; he felt disillusioned after having a job with the U.S. government providing information about World War II. The book was published in January 1943.[3]

By 1955 the book had twenty printings; by then a new edition of the book came out.[4]


Reception

Mike Wallace stated in his 1957 interview of Wylie that many viewers had criticized Wylie's conclusions about mothers, and Wylie responded by stating that he was only talking about a certain type of mother.[5]

In 1999 Miles Kington of _The Independent_ stated that the book was one of several "forgotten classics".[6]

In 2005 Jonathan Yardley of the _Washington Post_ argued that the book had not aged well in his second reading; he had first read the book in the 1960s.[7]
