CUB CREEK is a stream in northern Miller County in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] It is a tributary of the Osage River.

The stream headwaters arise southeast of the community of Marys Home (at [2]) and it flows generally southeast before turning east in a broad bend to enter the Osage (at [3]). The confluence is about two miles north of Capps and two miles west of St. Elizabeth.[4]

Cub Creek most likely was named for bear cubs in the area.[5]
