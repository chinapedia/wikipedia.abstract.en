The Principality of Waldeck and Pyrmont was abolished in 1918 during the German Revolution, following the defeat of the Central Powers in the First World War. The succession, as with most former states of the Holy Roman Empire, was semi-salic, with the nearest female kinswoman of the last male inheriting the crown upon extinction of the dynasty in the male line.[1] The current pretender to the throne and head of the house is Wittekind, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont, grandson of Friedrich, the last ruling prince.[2]
