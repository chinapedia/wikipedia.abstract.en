_WHO'S YOUR DADDY?_ is a simulation video game created by Joe Williams.[1] The game funded $1,500 through the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter and received support on Steam Greenlight. An early access version of the game was made available in late December 2015.[2]


Gameplay

The game includes a single-player mode as well as a competitive multiplayer mode, in which one player controls the father and the other player controls the infant. In both modes, the father must prevent the baby's death, through methods such as locking cabinets and placing dangerous objects out of the baby's reach, as the baby attempts to commit suicide in various ways, including drinking bleach and sticking forks in electrical outlets.[3][4]

The game takes place in a two-story home with several common rooms. Players often swap roles each round.[5]
