_LONGBRANCH PENNYWHISTLE_ is an early-in-genre country rock album by Longbranch Pennywhistle, a duo featuring the then-little-known Glenn Frey and John David Souther.[1] It also contains strains of folk rock.[2] It was released in 1970; the duo split up shortly afterwards.

AllMusic's review of the album called it low-key and less commercial than the Eagles would be.[3]

One of the album's songs, "Kite Woman", would resurface on Souther's 1972 debut solo album, _John David Souther_.[4]
