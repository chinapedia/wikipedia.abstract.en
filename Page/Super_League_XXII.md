The 2017 SUPER LEAGUE SEASON, known as the Betfred Super League XXII for sponsorship reasons,[1] was the 22nd season of Super League and 123rd season of rugby league in Britain. Twelve teams competed over 23 rounds, including the Magic Weekend, which took place at St James' Park, Newcastle upon Tyne, after which the eight highest entered the Super League play-offs for a place in the Super League Grand Final. The four lowest teams then entered the qualifying play-offs, along with the four highest teams from the Championship, to determine which teams will play again in Super League XXIII.

Super League XXII featured twelve teams, the third year in which this number has taken part. This was also the third year since promotion and relegation was reintroduced into the competition, seeing Leigh promoted and Hull KR relegated from last season.


Teams

Eleven teams in Super League are from the North of England. Six teams hail from the historic county of Lancashire, west of the Pennines: Warrington, St. Helens, Salford, Wigan, Leigh, and Widnes. Five teams hail from the historic county of Yorkshire, east of the Pennines: Huddersfield, Wakefield Trinity, Leeds, Castleford, and Hull F.C. Catalans Dragons, located in Perpignan, France, are the only team outside the North of England. St Helens, Wigan Warriors, Warrington Wolves, and Leeds Rhinos are the only teams to have played in every season of Super League since 1996.

Leigh were promoted from the Kingstone Press Championship after finishing in 2nd place in The Qualifiers for 2016. Leigh became the first club promoted to the Super League under the Super 8s system, and the first club promoted to Super League since Widnes received a license for Super League XVII. Leigh last competed in the top flight in Super League X. Hull Kingston Rovers were relegated to the Championship after losing the 2016 Million Pound Game to Salford.

Super 8s

Format

After 23 games the league table was frozen and the teams were split up into 2 of the 5 "SUPER 8S". The teams finishing in the top 8 went on to contest the "SUPER LEAGUE SUPER 8S" to determine which teams would go through to the semi-final play-offs to compete for a place in the Grand Final. Teams finishing in the bottom four (9-12) were put alongside the top 4 teams from the Championship, in "THE QUALIFIERS" Super 8 group, where these teams will reset their season standings to 0 and also play 7 extra games each, as they attempt to earn a place in the following Super League competition.

Castleford Tigers topped the Super League Super 8s and were awarded the League Leaders Shield as well as a home advantage in the play-off semi-finals. The other home advantage was won by Leeds Rhinos with Hull and St Helens taking the other two places in the play-offs.
