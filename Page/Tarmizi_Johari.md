Soldadu MOHAMMAD TARMIZI BIN HAJI MAT JOHARI (born 26 December 1983) is a Bruneian international footballer who plays for MS ABDB and the Brunei national team as a goalkeeper.[1] He had a brief spell with professional club Brunei DPMM FC in 2014.


Club career

Tarmizi began playing league football with QAF FC,[2] then transferred to the football team of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces, MS ABDB from the 2007-08 season onwards.[3] He has won four league titles and six FA Cups with the Armymen to date.

Tarmizi moved to Brunei DPMM FC in early 2014 to serve as third-choice goalkeeper behind Wardun Yussof and Azman Ilham Noor. He was released and promptly rejoined MS ABDB after the season ended.[4]


International career

Tarmizi was first selected for the Brunei national football team at the 2018 World Cup qualifying matches against Chinese Taipei in early 2015.[5] He became a regular squad member for the Wasps but was finally handed his first appearance at the 2016 AFC Solidarity Cup held in Malaysia. At the semi-final against Macau on 12 November, first-choice goalkeeper Wardun Yussof was sent off for a foul outside the box, Tarmizi conceded the resulting free-kick after a deflection.[6] He held on between the goalposts until the game went to penalties, where Brunei missed twice to lose the shootout 4-3. He started the ensuing third place match which Brunei was defeated 3–2.[7]

Tarmizi was selected for the 2018 AFF Suzuki Cup qualification matches against Timor-Leste in September.[8]
