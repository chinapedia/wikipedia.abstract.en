DAN TAULAPAPA MCMULLIN (born May 23, 1957) is an American Samoan artist, known for his poetry, visual art and film. His major themes are his indigenous Samoan heritage and his fa'afafine gender identity. McMullin has been creating literary and artistic works for over 35 years, and has received numerous awards, fellowships, and grants.[1] He works in a variety of literary styles and visual art modes. In his adult life, he has spent time in Los Angeles (where he worked for many years), and now live with his partner in Laguna, California, and Hudson, New York.[2][3]

The interviewer Daniel Michael Satele writes of McMullin:


Childhood and education

McMullin was born in Japan into a military family, and spent his toddler years in Germany, before moving to American Samoa as a young child where he was raised on Tutuila Island in the villages of Maleola and Leone.[4][5][6] He is of Samoan and Jewish-Irish descent. His childhood home on Samoa has been described as "a traditional Samoan fale roundhouse with coral stone flooring and sugarcane thatching, brought up making indigenous siapo barkcloth painting by his great-grandmother Fa'asapa."[7] He has his MFA from Claremont Graduate University and a BA from University of California, Irvine. He spent much of his professional career in television, film, and theater, before leaving those industries to focus on poetry and his own art. He has taught both poetry and painting at the University of the South Pacific, for the California Arts Council, for the American Samoa Arts Council and the American Samoan Humanities Council.[8]


Gender and heritage

The prominence of McMullin's indigenous heritage and queer identity in his artistic work cannot be overstated. These have been major influences since his early career. McMullin often cites these topics not only as areas of exploration for his art, but also as the major inspiration. In an interview in 2013 when asked which non-artist most influences his work, he replied: "My old man, my boyfriend, usually in bed after yadda yadda, looking out the windows at the hills of Laguna, California where we are. It's moments like that I'm back in Samoa again, my soul is; and ideas come easily, like mangoes hitting a tin roof in the rain."[9]

McMullin identifies himself as fa'afafine, a Samoan third gender for which there is no perfect English translation, but which is often described as a man who lives as a woman.[10] McMullin generally uses male pronouns, including on his own website.[11] Describing fa'afafine in an artist statement introducing his poetry and photography for the USC Cinema journal _Spectator_, McMullin writes:

McMullin, in another statement accompanying his work in June 2016, says "Often, not always, but often my work looks at sexuality and the body. The body as memory, a key to our historical presences, to my own story and my oratory. There is a great cleft and an eternal return to the past, but the past is only a way to continue the journey into the future. A looking back as a way of setting the sale toward whatever my own indigenous futurism defines."[12]

In addition to artistic and activist work, McMullin has also written personal narratives reflecting on both his gender and indigenous identity. Of particular note is an expansive essay written for the Amerasia Journal in 2011, which explores what it means to be Fa'afafine both from a personal and historical context.[13] In an essay for _The Poetry Foundation_ blog, McMullin says "Identity is not something we claim, it is something that claims us."[14]


Creative works

Writing

McMullin's poetry and essays have been widely published, especially in anthologies focused on LGBTQ or Pacific Island indigenous literature. McMullin's first full-length poetry collection, _Coconut Milk_ (2013) was named in the American Library Association's Over the Rainbow top-ten overall category.[15] The Native American poet Qwo-Li Driskill said of this collection "He [McMullin] balances humor, rage, and the erotic through his words." Brandy Nalani McDougall, another Native writer says of the work, "McMullin's _Coconut Milk_ is a brilliant collection of both narrative and avant-garde poems descended from traditional storytelling that gives voice to Samoan fa'afafine culture as it continues to flourish in Samoa in the colonial diaspora."[16] The publisher says of the book:

"McMullin seamlessly flows between exposing the ironies of Tiki kitsch-inspired cultural appropriation and intimate snapshots of Samoan people and place. In doing so, he disrupts popular notions of a beautiful Polynesia available for the taking, and carves out new avenues of meaning for Pacific Islanders of Oceania. Throughout the collection, McMullin illustrates various manifestations of geopolitical, cultural, linguistic, and sexual colonialism. His work illuminates the ongoing resistance to colonialism and the remarkable resilience of Pacific Islanders and queer-identified people."[17]

Much of _Coconut Milk_ read nearly biographically, such as the poem "Sa Moana Poem Number Two" which opens:

Of McMullin's more experimental poetry, such as his poetry published in Poetry Magazine in 2016, he often blends the boundaries between poetry, visual poetry, and visual art.[18][19] The language in his poems often takes quick turns and have a sense of controlled stream of consciousness. They are rich in both visual and other concrete details, such as these lines from a poem called "The Doors of the Sea":

Before the publication of _Coconut Milk_, McMullin has already been widely published, and his solo collections included a poetry chapbook, _A Drag Queen Named Pipi_ (2004) from Tinfish Press and a children's book _My Name is Laloifi_ (2005).[20]

Visual art

McMullin began making visual art around 2004 while living in Apia Samoa. McMullin describes the origins of his work as an 'ironic take on romantic island painting', but soon turned towards themes of connection to his great grandmother and his own indigenous identity. Around 2011 or slightly earlier, he began to explore the concept of the cultural appropriation of Samoan art and culture, or Tiki Kitsch as it is sometimes called. Much of his work since that time has been influenced by this shift.[21] In a 2012 artist statement McMullin writes:

In addition to painting, McMullin also does a significant amount of work in sculpture, collage, installation and photography. McMullin's work has been featured in over a dozen solo exhibits – including most notably installations at the American Museum of Natural History in New York (2016) and at the De Young Museum in San Francisco (2010) – and in over 50 group exhibitions across the United States.[22]

When asked about the materials he uses in a 2010 interview as artist in residence at de Young, McMullin response gives some insight not only into the physical make up of his works, but also in how the many modes in which he works organically influence each other:

Film

Of McMullin's three short films _Sinaela_ has received the most acclaim, and has been shown at film festivals internationally including Australia and New Zealand.[23] It was filmed on a hand held camera in American Samoa, and draws on the fairy tale Cinderella as well as a Samoan proverbial tale (a fa'agogo). Since _Sinaela,_ McMullin also made the films _ULA: The Garland_ which was shown in 2011 in New Zealand at the Pacific Art Summit as a work in progress,[24] and _100 Tikis_, a short film on the theme of cultural appropriation.
