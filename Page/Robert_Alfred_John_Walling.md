ROBERT ALFRED JOHN WALLING (11 January 1869, Exeter – 4 December 1949) was an English journalist and author of detective novels, who signed his works "R. A. J. Walling".[1]


Career

Walling worked as a reporter for the newspaper _Western Daily Mercury_ in Plymouth before working as the company's sales representative in western Cornwall. In 1891 in Plymouth he started a newspaper specialising in football. In 1893 he became editor-in-chief of the _Bicycling News_ in Coventry. In 1894 he returned to Plymouth, where he participated in the April 1895 launch of the _Western Evening Herald_, Plymouth's first evening newspaper. In 1904 he became the managing director/editor of the Western Newspaper Company and joined the board of directors in 1915. In 1910 he became a magistrate in addition to his other work but resigned a few years later. He also chaired for some time Plymouth's Chamber of Commerce. In 1921 Sir Leicester Harmsworth (as owner of the _Western Morning News_) acquired _The Western Daily Mercury_ from the Western Newspaper Company, which before the acquisition owned the _Western Daily Mercury_ and the _Western Evening Herald_. Upon the acquisition, Walling resigned as managing director/editor from the Western Newspaper Company and became editor-in-chief of the weekly newspaper _Western Independent_, where he continued until his retirement in 1945. He remained on the board of directors of the Western Newspaper Company until his death in 1949.

In addition to his editorial and managerial work, Walling wrote news stories, travel articles, biographies, short detective novels published as newspaper serials, and, in his later years, detective novels published in book form. His detective novel _The Third Degree_ (1923) was adapted and published in book form by Albert Pigasse in France in the collection _Le Masque_ under the title _L’Agenda de M. Lanson_. Walling's first detective novel (not published first in serial form) was _The Dinner Party at Bardolph's_ (1927), published in Paris in 1931 as _Le Financier Bardolph_ and published by Mondadori in Milan in 1932 as _Se a tavola_. In 1932 there appeared in _The Fatal Five Minutes_ Walling's recurrent protagonist Philip Tolefree, a private detective often asked by an insurance company to solve whodunit puzzles.

The character Philip Tolefree has a friend, Scotland Yard's Inspector Pierce, who appears in many of the novels and engages in friendly competition with, and occasionally helps, Tolefree.

Will Cuppy wrote a blurb for Walling's detective novel _The Corpse with the Floating Foot_.[2]


Family

In 1894 Walling married Florence Victoria Greet. Robert Victor Walling was their son.
