History

The Mercado del Carmen is a market located in a southern neighborhood of Mexico City called San Ángel.[2] It is inspired by American and European markets where its possible to buy items such as organic groceries, coffee and a variety of products. It opened on September 4, 2014 and it is located on a colonial Mexican house that has been remodeled for business purposes.[3] It is divided in two floors and it has restaurants, coffee shops, boutiques and more. At first, the market had only 23 different establishments, growing to 31 shops with organic stores, bakeries, coffee shops, a winery, artisanal beer, a tea house, vegan cookies, and a grand variety of traditional and exotic foods.[4]

It was founded by Jan Toussaint, lead singer from a Mexican band called Jetlag, and his partners. Toussaint mentions that the idea surged when he and his friends realized that there were not any establishments like this one in the city. They wanted to go to a place where they could choose what to eat from a variety of options and also to promote Mexican small business and have them being part of this great project.[5]
