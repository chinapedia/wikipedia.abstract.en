_LOUCHÉBEM_ or _LOUCHERBEM_ () is Parisian and Lyonnaise butchers' (French _boucher_) slang, similar to Pig Latin and Verlan. It originated in the mid-19th century and was in common use until the 1950s.


Process

The _louchébem_ word-creation process resembles that of _largonji_, _verlan_, and _javanais_, in that existing words are camouflaged according to a set of rules. Strictly speaking, _louchébem_ is a more rigid variety of _largonji_ in which the ending _-èm_ is obligatory. _Largonji_ substitutes for the consonant or consonant cluster at the beginning of the word, or, if the word begins with an or a vowel, the second syllable; the initial consonant is then reattached to the end of the word along with a suffix particular to the argot: _-ji_ , _-oc_ , _-ic_ , _-uche_ , _-ès_ , or in the case of louchébem, _-em/ème_ .

Note that _louchébem_ is first and foremost an oral language, and spelling is usually phoneticized.


History

Despite the name, _louchébem_ seems to have been created not by butchers but by inmates at Brest Prison, with records dating back to 1821.[1]

Edmund Clerihew Bentley used the language as a plot point in his 1937 short story "The Old-Fashioned Apache".

During the Nazi occupation _louchébem_ was used by Parisian members of the Resistance.

Even today, _louchébem_ is still well-known and used among those working at point-of-sale in the meat retail industry. Some words have even leaked into common, everyday use by the masses; an example is the word _loufoque_, meaning "eccentric".

There is another French argot called _largonji_, which differs from _louchébem_ only in the suffix that is added (-i instead of -em); the term is derived from _jargon_.[2]
