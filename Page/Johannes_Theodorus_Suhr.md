He owned the Suhr House at Gammeltorv in Copenhagen as well as Sølyst north of the city and was the founder of foundation, Den Suhrske Stiftelse. [1]


Early life

Suhr was born into a wealthy family of merchants in Copenhagen in 1792. His father was Pæd Berendt Suhr, owner of J. P. Suhr & Søn which had been founded by Johan Peter Suhr (1712-1785). The company traded with a wide range of products, including coal, salt, linum and hemp. It survived the difficult years during the war with England in the 1800s. Theordor Stuhr finished school and had plans to study theology.


Career

When their father died in 1815, he and his elder brother Didrik Suhr joined the management of the company which was formally owned by their mother until her death in 1842. The company went through a difficult period with the settlement of its activities in Norway followed by an agricultural crisis but experienced new growth in the late 1820s and early 1830s. The company increasingly specialized in import of coal and iron from Sweden and England. In the 1830s, J. P. Suhr & Søn had a market share of more than 20% of the Danish import of coal and it later grew to 33 &. The company was also active as a money lender with ties to leading bankers in Hamburg.

In 1827, Suhr moved into the industrial sector when he leased the rolling mill in Frederiksberg. He established a production of copper plates and installed the first large, Danish-built steam engine (20 jp) in 1828. In 1830, he acquired Brede Copper Mill (_Brede Værk_). In the 1850s, he sold those activities but continued to have investments in industrial enterprises such as Ørholm, Strandmøllen and M. P. Allerup. He had also investments in industrial enterprises abroad.[2]

When his mother died in 1842, Suhr became the sole owner of the company after buying out his brother and sisters. At this point he had an estimated net worth of 800,000 Danish rigsdaler and by 1853 it had doubled to 1.6 million rigsdaler. In late 1855 he ceded the company to his nephew Ole Berendt Suhr (1813–1875) but remained active in it for another few years.[3][4]


Property

In 1840, he acquired the Schimmelmann family's country house Sølyst in Klampenborg. He kept a large household and socialized with the cultural and political elite. Suhr acquired Bonderup in Holbæk during 1853 and Merløsegaard in 1856. [5] [6] [7]
