JESSE BONDS WEAVER JR. (born June 22, 1962), better known by the stage name SCHOOLLY D (sometimes spelled Schooly D), is an American rapper from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[1]


Career

Schoolly D teamed up with DJ Code Money in the mid-1980s. His lyrics reflected urban realism, violence, and sexual bravado, making Schoolly D the first gangsta rapper (see below). He is also interviewed in the 1986 cult documentary _Big Fun in the Big Town_.[2] He later embraced an Afrocentric style, bringing Afrocentric culture to hip hop along with KRS-One.[3]

Schoolly D contributed songs and music to many Abel Ferrara films, including "P.S.K." and "Saturday Night" (from _Saturday Night! – The Album_) as well as "King of New York" to Ferrara's film of the same name and the title track from _Am I Black Enough For You?_ that was played during the climactic shoot-out in that film, the title track from _How a Black Man Feels_, and "Signifying Rapper" (from _Smoke Some Kill_), which was used in Ferrara's film _Bad Lieutenant_.[4] Because Led Zeppelin successfully sued due to an uncleared interpolation of its song "Kashmir" in "Signifying Rapper", the song was omitted from the soundtrack of the film and from subsequent releases of the film.[5]

Composer Joe Delia tapped Schoolly to co-write and record "The Player" for Ferrara's film _The Blackout_, which Delia scored. Schoolly also wrote the score to Ferrara's _'R Xmas_. In 2006, Schoolly D co-wrote the indie film soundtrack of the historical science fiction thriller _Order of the Quest_ with Chuck Treece. The project series is produced by Benjamin Barnett, and Jay D Clark of Media Bureau. His last album, _Funk 'N Pussy_, on Jeff "Met" Thies' Chord Recordings features guest appearances by Public Enemy's Chuck D, Chuck Chillout, Lady B and a drum and bass remix of the classic Schoolly D track "Mr. Big Dick" (remixed by UK trip hop crew The Sneaker Pimps).

Schoolly also performed the music and occasional narration for the cult animated series _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_ on the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block. He was a guest on an episode of _Space Ghost Coast to Coast_. He also created the song "Sharkian Nights" for the _12 oz. Mouse_. The character Jesse B. Weaver from _The Rudy and Gogo World Famous Cartoon Show_ was also named after him.

In November 2006 Schoolly D and Cartoon Network were sued over the _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_ theme music. A drummer by the name of Terence Yerves claimed he had also written the theme music alongside Schoolly D in 1999 while working at the Meat Locker Studio. Yerves was aware the song would be used for a television series but did not approve of it being used for _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_, however, did not file the copyright to the Library of Congress until May 2006, after the series' fourth season had already started airing. In the lawsuit Yerves demanded he receive $150,000 for every time the series was aired after the lawsuit was filed, he also demanded that all existing copies of the series' DVDs be impounded and for _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_ to cease broadcast.[6]


Legacy

Rapper Ice-T, who is often given credit for the creation of gangsta rap, says that Schoolly D was the first gangsta rapper.[7]

In the DVD extra on the _King of New York_, Schoolly D claims to have independently invented the sport of snowboarding by sledding down Philadelphia hills on pieces of linoleum. (Snowboarding has roots in snurfing, which was invented in 1965.)

Funk metal band Primus mentions Schoolly D in their song "Harold of the Rocks" on the album _Frizzle Fry_.

The Beastie Boys sampled Schoolly D's song "Gucci Time" on their 1986 hit "Time to Get Ill."
