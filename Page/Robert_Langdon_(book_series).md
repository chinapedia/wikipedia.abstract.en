Robert_Langdon_book_series.png The _ROBERT LANGDON_ BOOK SERIES is named after Robert Langdon, the protagonist of the novels by American author Dan Brown. Langdon is portrayed as a Harvard University professor of religious iconology and symbology, a fictional field related to the study of historic symbols, which is not methodologically connected to the actual discipline of semiotics. Brown's novels that feature the lead character also include historical themes and Christianity as motifs, and as a result have generated controversy. Brown states on his website that his books are not anti-Christian, and that he is on a "constant spiritual journey" himself.


Books of the series


Fictional books

In the book series, Langdon is himself an author of six (fictional) books:

-   _The Symbology of Secret Sects_
-   _The Art of the Illuminati: Part 1_
-   _The Lost Language of Ideograms_
-   _The History of Kontology_
-   _Religious Iconology_
-   _Symbols of the Lost Sacred Feminine_
-   _Christian Symbols in the Muslim World_

In the real book _The Lost Symbol_ on page 8, a minor character, Pam, refers to the (fictional) _Symbols of the Lost Sacred Feminine_ as creating 'a delicious scandal'.


Reception

The series has sold over 120 million copies.[1][2]


Film adaptations

The novels were a success around the world and became bestsellers, and soon adapted into films in which Ron Howard directed and produced 3 of 5 novels: _The Da Vinci Code_ (2006), _Angels & Demons_ (2009), and _Inferno_ (2016), with Tom Hanks portraying the lead character, Professor Robert Langdon. All three were released by Columbia Pictures.
