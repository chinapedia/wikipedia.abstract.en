Peutinger-Bida.jpg showing "Tigisi"]] __NOTOC__ TIGISIS, also known as TIGISIS IN MAURETANIA to distinguish it from another Tigisis in Numidia, was an ancient Berber town (__) in the province of Mauretania Caesariensis. It was mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary.[1]

Tigisis is identified with ruins situated between present-day Dellys and Taourga in Algeria.


Diocese

The city was also the seat of an ancient diocese.[2][3] There are three known bishops of this diocese. The rival Catholic and Donatist bishops Solemnio and Pascasio both attended the 411 Council of Carthage, which gathered together the bishops of Roman North Africa. Passinato intervened at the 484 Council of Carthage called by the Vandal king Huneric, after which he was exiled.

Today, Tigisis in Mauritania survives as titular see (; ) in the Roman Catholic Church.[4] The current bishop is Tadeusz Bronakowski, auxiliary bishop of Łomża.[5]
