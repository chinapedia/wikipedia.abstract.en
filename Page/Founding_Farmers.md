History

In 2005, members of North Dakota Farmers Union (NDFU) were interested in developing a restaurant where guests could have access to, and benefit from, food grown, raised, and harvested on American family farms. NDFU first started a restaurant called Agraria, which failed due to numerous factors.[5] North Dakota Farmers Union soon partnered with restaurateurs, Dan Simons and Michael Vucurevich, and opened the first of their restaurants, Founding Farmers DC, in 2008.[6]
