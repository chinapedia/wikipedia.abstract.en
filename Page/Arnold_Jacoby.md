_' Victor Arnold Rosenblad Jacoby_' (September 10, 1913 – January 15, 2002) was a Norwegian writer and translator.[1] He produced a large volume of juvenile literature for boys, comics, crime fiction, and biographies, and he worked as a translator of children's and young adult fiction from English into Norwegian.[2]


Personal life and family

Jacoby was born and grew up in Brooklyn,[3] where his aunt, her husband and two children also lived. His parents had emigrated to America, but the family moved back to Larvik[4] when Jacoby's grandfather Georg Jacoby died and his nursery on _Dronningensgate_ (Queen Street) stood empty without someone to take care of it. While still a young man, Jacoby moved to Oslo, where he made a living writing and producing advertising and illustrations. During the Second World War he moved to Ula, and later back to Larvik. In 1961, he bought an 800-year-old house in Andora, Italy, where he spent extensive time and worked. He was the father of Marianne Rosenblad Jacoby Steina, a translator, proofreader, and publishing editor at Fogdal Publishing, and editor at Bonnier A/S, the singer and writer Louis Jacoby, and the illustrator and graphic designer Tom Rosenblad Jacoby.[5] He was married to Ellen née Dahl (1918–2012). Arnold Jacoby died in Larvik.


Career

In 1941, the magazine _Mystikk_ announced a competition to obtain Norwegian feature stories. Jacoby won the competition with his story "Mysteriet 'Robusta Gloria'" (The Mystery of Robusta Gloria), which was published in issue no. 11 (1942) under a pseudonym consisting of the author's two given names: Victor Arnold. The detective in the story was the "criminal agent" Herlofsen. Jacoby also wrote a feature story for _Mystikk_'s Christmas issue that year, called "Røntgenplatens hemmelighet" (The X-Ray Plate Secret), featuring the agent Erik Drag as the protagonist, and also the crime novel _Døden annonserer ikke_ (Death Does Not Advertise). Because of the war, Jacoby wrote under several pseudonyms. The novel _Døden og skipperen_ (Death and the Captain) was written under the name Sven (Tor) Winge, and the children's books _Jon i verden_ (John in the World) and _Krussedulle_ (Doodles) were written under the name Tone Silje.

Jacoby translated nearly 200 children's books over a 50-year span, including series such as The Hardy Boys, the Bobbsey Twins, Twin Connection, Vicky Austin, Conny, Cherry, Honey Bunch, and others. He was an illustrator and had a drawing office in Oslo in the early part of the Second World War together with the brothers Trygve and Olav Mosebekk. He was responsible for several comics, including _Atlantis_ in _Norsk Ukeblad_ under the pseudonym Erik Glende.[6][7] The comic _Atlantis_ was launched in the fall of 1942 and ceased when _Norsk Ukeblad_ was shut down by the Germans in the spring of 1943.[8] The same year he produced the comic _Cyklon-Kid_ (The Cyclone Kid) together with Trygve Mosebekk in the magazine _Mystikk_. This was published 17 times before it was also shut down by the Germans. The series was reworked after the war and was published under the name _Sabotasjegjengen_ (The Sabotage Gang) in the revived magazine, now renamed _Alle Menns Blad_.[9][10] During the war he also produced the comic _Bimba - hele verdens lille venn_ (Bimba: The Whole World's Little Friend), which was published in a Christmas and Easter magazine for children.[11]

Jacoby was a close childhood friend of the adventurer and researcher Thor Heyerdahl,[12][13] and he wrote several biographies about him, including _Señor Kon-Tiki_, which was published globally.[14] The two of them lived near each other in the municipality of Andora on the Ligurian coast in northern Italy.

Jacoby's most influential book was _Det angår også deg_ (It Also Applies to You), which deals with Herman Sachnowitz's time as a prisoner at the Auschwitz concentration camp and was written in collaboration with him. The book was first published in 1976 and it has been translated into many languages.[15][16]

In 1984 he published the book _Min afrikanske gullalder_ (My African Golden Age), which describes the adventures of Jacob Matheson (Thor Heyerdahl's half-brother) in Africa.
