WILLIAM EDGAR ODDIE, (born 7 July 1941)[1] is an English writer, comedian, composer, musician, artist, birder, conservationist, television presenter and actor. He became famous as one of The Goodies.

A birder since his childhood in Quinton, Birmingham,[2] Oddie has established a reputation as a naturalist, conservationist, and television presenter on wildlife issues. Some of his books are illustrated with his own paintings and drawings.[3] His wildlife programmes for the BBC include: _Springwatch/Autumnwatch_, _How to Watch Wildlife_, _Wild In Your Garden_, _Birding with Bill Oddie_, _Britain Goes Wild with Bill Oddie_ and _Bill Oddie Goes Wild_.


Early life

Oddie was born in Rochdale, Lancashire but moved to Birmingham at a young age; his father was assistant chief accountant at the Midlands Electricity Board.[4] His mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and, during most of his youth, lived in a hospital.[5] He was educated at Lapal Primary School, Halesowen Grammar School (now The Earls High School, Halesowen) and King Edward's School, Birmingham, an all-boys direct grant school (since 1976, an independent school), where he captained the school's rugby union team.[6] He then studied English Literature at Pembroke College, Cambridge.


Career

Comedy

Whilst at Cambridge University Oddie appeared in several Footlights Club productions. One of these, a revue called _A Clump of Plinths_, was so successful at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe that it was renamed _Cambridge Circus_ and transferred to the West End in London, then New Zealand and Broadway in September 1964. Meanwhile, still at Cambridge, Oddie wrote scripts for and appeared briefly in TV's _That Was the Week That Was_.[7]

He appeared in Bernard Braden's television series _On The Braden Beat_ in 1964. Subsequently, he was a key member of the performers in the BBC radio series _I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again_, where many of his musical compositions were featured. Some were released on the album _Distinctly Oddie_ (Polydor, 1967). He was one of the first performers to parody a rock song, arranging the traditional Yorkshire folk song "On Ilkla Moor Baht'at" in the style of Joe Cocker's hit rendition of the Beatles' "With a Little Help from My Friends" (released on John Peel's Dandelion Records in 1970 and featured in Peel's special box of most-treasured singles), and singing "Andy Pandy" in the style of a brassy soul number such as Wilson Pickett or Geno Washington might perform. In many shows he would do short impressions of Hughie Green.

On television Oddie was co-writer and performer in the comedy series _Twice a Fortnight_ with Graeme Garden, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and Jonathan Lynn. Later, he was co-writer and performer in the comedy series _Broaden Your Mind_ with Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden, for which Oddie became a cast member for the second series.

Oddie, Brooke-Taylor and Garden then co-wrote and appeared in their television comedy series _The Goodies_. The Goodies also released records, including "Father Christmas Do Not Touch Me"/"The In-Betweenies", "Funky Gibbon", and "Black Pudding Bertha", which were hit singles in 1974–75. They reformed, briefly, in 2005, for a successful 13-date tour of Australia.

Oddie, Brooke-Taylor and Garden voiced characters on the 1983 animated children's programme _Bananaman_.[8][9][10]

In the Amnesty International show _A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)_, Oddie, Brooke-Taylor and Garden sang their hit song "Funky Gibbon". They also appeared on _Top of the Pops_ with the song. Together with Garden (who is a qualified doctor), Oddie co-wrote many episodes of the television comedy series _Doctor in the House_, including most of the first season and all of the second season. He has occasionally appeared on the BBC Radio 4 panel game _I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue_, on which Garden and Brooke-Taylor are regular panellists. In 1982 Garden and Oddie wrote, but did not perform in, a six-part science fiction sitcom called _Astronauts_ for Central and ITV. The show was set in an international space station in the near future.[11]

Natural history

Oddie's first published work was an article about the birdlife of Birmingham's Bartley Reservoir in the West Midland Bird Club's 1962 Annual Report[12] (he is first credited in the 1956 report, in which reports of his bird observations are tagged with his initials "WEO"[13][14]). He has since written a number of books about birds and birdwatching, as well as articles for many specialist publications including _British Birds_, _Birdwatching Magazine_ and _Birdwatch_.

He discussed bird song recordings with Derek Jones in an August 1973 BBC Radio 4 programme called _Sounds Natural_.[15]

In the autumn of 1976 Oddie was involved in the successful identification of Britain's first ever record of Pallas's reed bunting on Fair Isle, Shetland.[16]

One of Oddie's first forays in the world of television natural history was as a guest on _Animal Magic_ in December 1977.[17] Another early natural history radio appearance was in October, as the guest on Radio 4's _Through My Window_, discussing the birds of Hampstead Heath.[18]

On 30 July 1985, he was the subject of a 50-minute _Nature Watch Special: Bill Oddie – Bird Watcher_, in which he was interviewed by Julian Pettifer[19] at places where he had spent time birding, including Bartley Reservoir, the Christopher Cadbury Wetland Reserve at Upton Warren, RSPB Titchwell Marsh and Blakeney Point.[20]

Oddie has since hosted a number of successful nature programmes for the BBC, many produced by Stephen Moss, including:[21]

-   _The Great Bird Race_ (1983; Channel 4)
-   _The Great Kenyan Bird Safari_ (BBC)
-   _Favourite Walks_: "A Bird Walk" (1985; BBC; filmed on Fair Isle)

-   _Bill Oddie In Tiger Country_ (2004)
-   _Bill Oddie's How to Watch Wildlife_ (two series, 2005 and 2006; also on DVD)
-   _Seven Natural Wonders_ (London edition) (2005)
-   _The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs_ (2005; also on DVD)
-   _Springwatch_ (2005–2008)
-   _Autumnwatch_ (2006–2008)
-   _Bill Oddie Back in the USA_ (2007)
-   _Bill Oddie's Top Ten Birds_ (2007; BBC Four)
-   _100 Years of Wildlife_ (2007)
-   _Bill Oddie's Wild Side_ (2008)
-   _Bill Oddie's Top 10_ (2008)

On its first evening of broadcast in 2004, _Britain Goes Wild_ set a record for its timeslot of 8 pm on BBC Two of 3.4 million viewers, one million more than the Channel 4 programme showing at that time. _Britain Goes Wild_, renamed _Springwatch_ the following year, became a wildlife broadcasting phenomenon, attracting up to 5 million viewers.

He became president of the West Midland Bird Club in 1999,[22] having been Vice-President since 1991,[23] and is a former member of the council of the RSPB. Oddie is also a President of the League Against Cruel Sports[24] and a vice-president of the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers.[25] He practised as a bird ringer, but allowed his licence to lapse.[26]

In 2003 Oddie set up a half-marathon to raise money for various wildlife charities in his birth-town of Rochdale.[27] Celebrities who have participated in the event include Ray Mears, Catherine Jenkins and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.

In 2011, Oddie featured as an investigator in _Snares Uncovered: killers in the countryside_.[28] The film carried out an exposé of snaring in Scotland and was commissioned by animal protection charity OneKind. During the investigation, Oddie discovered over 70 snare traps and several stink pits.

Music

Oddie wrote original music at Cambridge University for the Footlights and later wrote comic songs for _I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again_. He also wrote a number of comic songs for The Goodies, most of them performed by Oddie.

In the 1960s and early 1970s, Oddie released a number of singles and at least one album. One of the former, issued in 1970 on John Peel's Dandelion Records label (Catalogue No: 4786), was _On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at_,[29] performed in the style of Joe Cocker's _With a Little Help from my Friends_. The B-side, _Harry Krishna_, featured the Hare Krishna chant, substituting the names of contemporary famous people called Harry, including Harry Secombe, Harry Worth, Harry Lauder, and Harry Corbett, as well as puns such as "Harry [Hurry] along now", "Harrystotle [Aristotle]" and ending with "Harry-ly [I really] must go now". Both tracks appear on the compilation CD _Life Too, Has Surface Noise: The Complete Dandelion Records Singles Collection 1969–1972_ (2007).

He played the drums and saxophone and appeared as Cousin Kevin in a production of The Who's rock opera _Tommy_ at the Rainbow Theatre, Finsbury Park, London, on 9 December 1972. He has also contributed vocals to a Rick Wakeman album, _Criminal Record_.

Oddie took part in the English National Opera production of the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera _The Mikado_, in which he appeared in the role of the "Lord High Executioner", taking over the role from Eric Idle. During the early 1990s, Oddie was a DJ for London-based jazz radio station 102.2 Jazz FM.

In 2007 Oddie appeared on the BBC series _Play It Again_.[30] In the episode he attempts to realise his dream of becoming a rock guitarist. Initially teacher Bridget Mermikides tries to teach him using traditional methods but he rebels: instead he turns to old friends Albert Lee, Dave Davies (of The Kinks) and Mark Knopfler for advice and strikes out on his own. He succeeds in the target of playing lead guitar for his daughter Rosie's band at her 21st birthday party, and even manages to impress his erstwhile teacher.

In November 2010, he agreed, along with fellow members of The Goodies, to re-release their 1970s hit "The Funky Gibbon" to raise funds for the International Primate Protection League's Save the Gibbon appeal.

Other television and audio appearances

Oddie appeared as the hapless window cleaner in the Eric Sykes' comedy story _The Plank_ in 1967. He also presented the live children's Saturday morning entertainment show _Saturday Banana_ (ITV/Southern Television) during the late 1970s. In the late 1980s he was a presenter of the BBC TV show _Fax_ (a show about 'facts').

In 1981 he appeared as a Telethon celebrity in New Zealand, hosted by TV1.[31] He voices Asterix in the UK dub of the 1989 animated film _Asterix and the Big Fight_ (an animated adaptation of the books _Asterix and the Big Fight_ and _Asterix and the Soothsayer_, novelized as _Operation Getafix_).

In the 1990s he became better known as a presenter of birdwatching, and later wildlife-related, programmes such as _Springwatch_. Although he remains almost unknown to US audiences, in 1992 he was a guest star in the US comedy television series _Married... with Children_ for a 3-part episode set in England.[32]

In 1997–98 he appeared on the Channel 4 archaeological programme _Time Team_, as the team excavated a Roman villa site in Turkdean, Gloucestershire.

He was the compère of a daytime BBC gameshow _History Hunt_ (in 2003); and has appeared in the _Doctor Who_ audio drama _Doctor Who and the Pirates_. In 2004, he appeared in the BBC show _Who Do You Think You Are?_, in which he looked into his ancestry – he was visibly moved by its revelations. His story, in fact, was that long-running series' very first episode. In 2005, he took part in _Rolf on Art – the big event at Trafalgar Square_ and in September that year was also a celebrity guest along with Lynda Bellingham on the ITV1 programme _Who Wants to be a Millionaire_. He also gave out opinions in 100 greatest cartoons on Channel 4 that year, talking about cartoon incidents such as the Asses of Fire skit in South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut [33].

In 2006 Oddie appeared in the BBC show _Never Mind the Buzzcocks_,[34] and also appeared on the topical quiz show _8 out of 10 Cats_. He was also the voice behind many B&Q adverts throughout 2006/2007. On 25 May 2007, Oddie made a cameo appearance on Ronni Ancona's new comedy sketch show, _Ronni Ancona & Co_.

Also in 2007, three artists each painted a portrait of Oddie, as part of the BBC programme "Star Portraits with Rolf Harris". one of the artists, Mark Roscoe, later revealed a dislike of Oddie, claiming to have included hidden insults in his work.[35]

He hosted the genealogy-based series _My Famous Family_, broadcast on UKTV History in 2007.[36] In 2008, Oddie was a guest on Jamie Oliver's television special _Jamie's Fowl Dinners_, talking about free-range chickens.[37]

He also appeared on _Would I Lie To You?_ in 2011 where he revealed that he was saved from drowning by Freddy from popular children's series _Rainbow_ and _Rod, Jane and Freddy_ while on holiday in the Seychelles. Bill_Oddie_Live_(Perth_June_27_2013).jpg

In February 2015, Oddie appeared in _The Keith Lemon Sketch Show_ as the narrator of the sketch _Ed Sheeran Watch_.

He appeared as a contestant on a celebrity edition of _Fifteen to One_ in August 2015.

2013 Australian tour

Oddie undertook an Australian tour during June 2013 in all of the mainland states capital cities – Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth – in a series of one-off shows, "_An Oldie but a Goodie_". A video message from Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden was shown during the performances.[38] Oddie made personal appearances on both _The Project_ and _Adam Hills Tonight_ TV shows during the tour; he also filmed a guest-programming spot for the ABC-TV's all-night music video show _Rage_.[39]


Personal life

Family

In 1967 Oddie married Jean Hart,[40][41] and from this marriage he has two daughters, Bonnie Oddie and Kate Hardie, an actress, as well as three grandchildren.

In 1983 he married Laura Beaumont-Giles,[42] with whom he has worked on a variety of projects for children, including film scripts, drama and comedy series, puppet shows and books. They have a daughter, Rosie, born in October 1985,[43][44] and live in Hampstead, North London. Rosie Oddie is a musician, also using the name Rosie Bones.[45]

Depression and bipolar disorder

Oddie has suffered from depression for most of his life and was diagnosed with clinical depression in 2001.[46] On 11 March 2009 it was reported that he had been admitted to Capio Nightingale psychiatric hospital in Marylebone, to deal with his depression. His then agent David Foster said: "Bill gets these bouts every two or three years where he gets down for about two weeks and recovers. He sometimes goes into hospital or takes a break or has a change of scenery to recharge his batteries."[47] In January 2010 Oddie spoke to the media, revealing that he had in fact had two separate stays in different hospitals, only being discharged "in time for Christmas". He said that he was dealing with depression and bipolar disorder, describing the period as "probably the worst 12 months of my life". Oddie stated that he was planning to meet with BBC executives to discuss his return to television work.[48][49]

His illness meant that Oddie did not appear in the 2009 and 2010 series of _Springwatch_, although he made a guest appearance in the penultimate episode of the latter. He subsequently claimed he was dismissed from _Springwatch_ and that this had caused the depressive illness.[50]

Oddie presented the BBC Radio 4 Appeal programme on 10 August 2014 on behalf of the charity Bipolar UK. He revealed that as a consequence of his bipolar disorder he had attempted suicide during one of his depressive episodes.[51] On the UK TV programme _Who Do You Think You Are?_ he attributed his depression and bipolar disorder as an adult to his minimal and painful relationship with his mother.[52]

Political views

Oddie supports the Green Party.[53] In October 2014, on the BBC's _Sunday Morning Live_, he stated that he wanted a limit on the number of children that British families can have, saying that he was "very often ashamed" to be British, whom he called "a terrible race".[54][55]


Honours

In 2001, Oddie became the third person to decline to appear on _This Is Your Life_. He changed his mind a few hours later and agreed to appear on the show. On 16 October 2003, Oddie was made an OBE for his service to Wildlife Conservation in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. He played down the event, choosing to wear a camouflage shirt and crumpled jacket to receive his medal. In June 2004, Oddie and Johnny Morris were jointly profiled in the first of a three part BBC Two series, _The Way We Went Wild_, about television wildlife presenters. In May 2005, he received the British Naturalists' Association's Peter Scott Memorial Award, from BNA president David Bellamy, "in recognition of his great contribution to our understanding of natural history and conservation."[56][57] He is a recipient of the RSPB Medal.[58]

On 30 June 2009, he was proposed for inclusion in the Birmingham Walk of Stars, with the public invited to vote.[59]

In popular culture

In the fictional world of comedy character Alan Partridge, Oddie is an unseen presence in Alan's life.

He has also been referenced, often humorously, by the hosts of _Top Gear_. Jeremy Clarkson even used a mask with Oddie's face to escape speed cameras while racing the Nissan GT-R against the Bullet train in Japan in Episode 4 of _Top Gear_{{'}}s 11th series. James May also raced in Finland against an Oddie lookalike who won the race.
