ERIN BOW (born April 1, 1972), born Erin Noteboom, is an American-born Canadian author.


Biography

Early life

Erin Noteboom was born in Des Moines, Iowa, and raised in Omaha, Nebraska.[1] She had at least one sibling, a younger sister named Wendy.[2] As a child she was interested in science, writing, and exploring the woods.[3][4] In her eighth grade year, Noteboom moved from a suburb in Des Moines to a suburb in Omaha.[5] She then attended Mercy High School and graduated in 1990.[6] In high school, she founded the math club and was the captain of the debate team.[7][8]

She went to Creighton University, where she was interested in studying both physics and writing.[9][10][11] Noteboom ultimately chose physics as a major, because she believed that it would be easier to become a self-taught writer rather than a self-taught physicist.[12]

Professional life

Bow began a graduate school doctoral program studying particle physics in Twin Cities, Minnesota.[13][14] She found that physics graduate school offered her little time for anything other than school work, including writing.[15][16] She worked briefly as a physicist, including a job as a summer student at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva, Switzerland.[17][18]

During graduate school, Noteboom was diagnosed with a brain tumor.[19] Though doctors initially thought the tumor was fatal, it was ultimately found to be a removable glioma.[20] This diagnosis contributed to a change of priorities for Noteboom, leading her to drop out of graduate school and return to poetry.[21]

She wrote poetry and a memoir before focusing on writing young adult works. Additionally, she worked as the poetry editor for the _New Quarterly_ and led writing workshops in Kitchener, Ontario.[22][23] She also worked as a part-time writer at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics.[24] She participated in the Vancouver Writers Fest Writer-in-Residence program at Rossland Summit School.[25]

Personal life

In 1997, Noteboom moved to Canada.[26] There, she married fellow author and Canadian James Bow, and changed her name to Erin Bow.[27] In 2005, her younger sister, a painter named Wendy Ewell, drowned.[28][29][30] Bow lives with her husband, two daughters, and two pets in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada.[31] She writes in a modified backyard shed[32][33] and enjoys cooking.[34]
