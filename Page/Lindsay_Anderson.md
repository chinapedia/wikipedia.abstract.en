LINDSAY GORDON ANDERSON (17 April 1923 – 30 August 1994)[1] was a British feature film, theatre and documentary director, film critic, and leading light of the Free Cinema movement and the British New Wave.[2][3] He is most widely remembered for his 1968 film _if...._, which won the _Palme d'Or_ at Cannes Film Festival and was Malcolm McDowell's cinematic debut.[4] He is also notable, though not a professional actor, for playing a minor role in the Academy Award winning film _Chariots of Fire_. McDowell produced a 2007 documentary about his experiences with Anderson, _Never Apologize_.[5]


Early life

Lindsay Gordon Anderson was born in Bangalore, South India, where his father had been stationed with the Royal Engineers, on the 17th of April 1923.[6][7] His father Captain (later Major General) Alexander Vass Anderson[8][9][10] was a British Army Officer that had been born in North India and his mother Estelle Bell Gasson was born in Queenstown, South Africa, the daughter of a wool merchant.[11][12] Lindsay's parents separated in 1926 and Estelle returned to England with her sons; however, they tried to reconcile in 1932 in Bangalore, and when Estelle returned to England she was pregnant with her third son, Alexander Vass Anderson.[13] The Andersons divorced and Estelle remarried Major Cuthbert Sleigh in 1936.[14] Lindsay's father re-married in India; although Gavin Lambert writes, in 'Mainly About Lindsay Anderson: A Memoir' (Faber and Faber, 2000, p. 18), that Alexander Vass Anderson 'cut (his first family) out of his life', making no reference to them in his 'Who's Who' entry, Lindsay often saw his father and looked after his house and dogs when he was away.[15]

Both Lindsay and his older brother Murray Anderson (1919-2016) were educated at Saint Ronan's School in Worthing, West Sussex, and at Cheltenham College.[16][17] It was at Cheltenham that Lindsay had met his lifelong friend and biographer, the screenwriter and novelist Gavin Lambert.[18] Lindsay won a scholarship for classical studies at Wadham College at the University of Oxford, in 1942.[19]

Anderson served in the Army from 1943 until 1946, first with the 60th King's Royal Rifle Groups, and then in the final year of World War II as a cryptographer for the Intelligence Corps, at the Wireless Experimental Centre in Delhi.[20] Anderson assisted in nailing the Red flag to the roof of the Junior Officers' mess in Annan Parbat, in August 1945, after the victory of the Labour Party in the general election was confirmed.[21] The colonel did not approve, he recalled a decade later, but no disciplinary action was taken against them.

Lindsay returned to Oxford in 1946 but changed from classical studies to English;[22] he graduated with an MA in 1948.[23]


Career

Film criticism

Before going into film-making, Anderson was a prominent film critic writing for the influential _Sequence_ magazine (1947–52), which he co-founded with Gavin Lambert, Peter Ericsson and Karel Reisz;[24] later writing for the British Film Institute's journal _Sight and Sound_ and the left-wing political weekly the _New Statesman_.[25] In a 1956 polemical article, "Stand Up, Stand Up" for _Sight and Sound_, he attacked contemporary critical practices, in particular the pursuit of objectivity. Taking as an example some comments made by Alistair Cooke in 1935, where Cooke claimed to be without politics as a critic, Anderson responded:

Following a series of screenings which he and the National Film Theatre programmer Karel Reisz organized for the venue of independently-produced short films by himself and others, he developed a philosophy of cinema which found expression in what became known, by the late-1950s, as the Free Cinema movement.[26] This was the belief that the British cinema must break away from its class-bound attitudes and that non-metropolitan Britain ought to be shown on the nation's screens. He had already begun to make films himself, starting in 1948 with _Meet the Pioneers_, a documentary about a conveyor-belt factory.[27]

Filmmaking

Along with Karel Reisz, Tony Richardson, and others, he secured funding from a variety of sources (including Ford of Britain) and they each made a series of short documentaries on a variety of subjects. One of Anderson's early short films, _Thursday's Children_ (1954), concerning the education of deaf children, made in collaboration with Guy Brenton, a friend from his Oxford days, won an Oscar for Best Documentary Short in 1954.[28]

These films, influenced by one of Anderson' heroes, the French filmmaker Jean Vigo, and made in the tradition of the British documentaries of Humphrey Jennings, foreshadowed much of the social realism of British cinema that emerged in the next decade, with Reisz's _Saturday Night and Sunday Morning_ (1960), Richardson's _The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner_ (1962) and Anderson's own _This Sporting Life_ (1963), produced by Reisz. Anderson's film met with mixed reviews at the time, and was not a commercial success.

Anderson is perhaps best remembered as a filmmaker for his "Mick Travis trilogy", all of which star Malcolm McDowell as the title character: _if...._ (1968), a satire on public schools; _O Lucky Man!_ (1973) a _Pilgrim's Progress_ inspired road movie; and _Britannia Hospital_ (1982), a fantasia taking stylistic influence from the populist wing of British cinema represented by Hammer horror films and Carry On comedies.[29]

In 1981, Anderson played the role of the Master of Caius College at Cambridge University in the film _Chariots of Fire_.

Anderson developed an acquaintance from 1950 with John Ford, which led to what has come to be regarded as one of the standard books on that director, Anderson's _About John Ford_ (1983). Based on half a dozen meetings over more than two decades, and a lifetime's study of the man's work, the book has been described as "One of the best books published by a film-maker on a film-maker".[30]

In 1985, producer Martin Lewis invited Anderson to chronicle Wham!'s visit to China, among the first-ever visits by Western pop artists, which resulted in Anderson's film _Foreign Skies: Wham! In China_. He admitted in his diary on 31 March 1985, to having "no interest in Wham!", or China, and he was simply "'doing this for the money'".[31] In 1986, he was a member of the jury at the 36th Berlin International Film Festival.[32]

Anderson was also a significant British theatre director. He was long associated with London's Royal Court Theatre, where he was Co-Artistic Director 1969–70, and Associate Artistic Director 1971–75, directing premiere productions of plays by David Storey, among others.

In 1992, as a close friend of actresses Jill Bennett and Rachel Roberts, Anderson included a touching episode in his autobiographical BBC film _Is That All There Is?_, with a boat trip down the River Thames (several of their professional colleagues and friends aboard) to scatter their ashes on the waters while musician Alan Price sang the song "Is That All There Is?".

Every year, the International Documentary Festival in Amsterdam (IDFA) gives an acclaimed filmmaker the chance to screen his or her personal Top 10 favorite films. In 2007, Iranian filmmaker Maziar Bahari selected _O Dreamland_ and _Every Day Except Christmas_ (1957), a record of a day in the old Covent Garden market, for his top 10 classics from the history of documentary.[3]


Personal life

Gavin Lambert's memoir, _Mainly About Lindsay Anderson_, in which he wrote that Anderson repressed his homosexuality, was seen as a betrayal by his other friends.[33] In November 2006 Malcolm McDowell told _The Independent_:


Death

Anderson died from a heart attack on 30 August 1994 at the age of 71.
