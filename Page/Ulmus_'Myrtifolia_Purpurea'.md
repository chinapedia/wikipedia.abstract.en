The Elm cultivar _ULMUS_ 'MYRTIFOLIA PURPUREA', the PURPLE MYRTLE-LEAVED ELM, was first mentioned by Louis de Smet of Ghent (1877) as _Ulmus myrtifolia purpurea_.[1] An _U. campestris myrtifolia purpurea_ Hort. was distributed by Louis van Houtte in the 1880s,[2] by the Späth nursery, Berlin, in the 1890s and early 1900s,[3] and by the Hesse Nursery, Weener, Germany, till the 1930s.[4]

Schneider,[5] Henry,[6] and Green[7] believed 'Myrtifolia Purpurea' a synonym of _U. minor_ 'Purpurascens',[8] which was also first listed in 1877.

It is not known whether the later cultivar _U._ 'Myrtifolia' was related to 'Myrtifolia Purpurea'.


Description

The catalogue of the Späth nursery described _U. campestris myrtifolia purpurea_ as having very small reddish leaves.[9]

Cultivation

'Myrtifolia Purpurea' was occasionally cultivated as an ornamental. One tree was planted in 1893, as _U. campestris myrtifolia purpurea_, at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, Canada.[10] Three specimens were supplied by the Späth nursery to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902 as _U. campestris myrtifolia purpurea_, and may still exist in Edinburgh as it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city (viz. the Wentworth Elm);[11] the current list of Living Accessions held in the Garden _per se_ does not list the plant.[12] _U. myrtifolia purpurea_, a small tree with "elegant foliage of beautiful color", appeared in the 1902 catalogue of the Bobbink and Atkins nursery, Rutherford, New Jersey,[13] and in Kelsey's 1904 catalogue, New York.[14]


Notable trees

Three small-leaved purple-flushing elms survive in Hove, one of them the UK champion (see 'Accessions'). Until 2018 one was misidentified as the large-leaved purple elm _U._ × _hollandica_ 'Purpurascens'.[15] Of the two names for small-leaved purple-flushing elm – _U._ 'Myrtifolia Purpurea' and _U. minor_ 'Purpurascens' (likely synonyms) – the former was the commoner in nursery lists.
