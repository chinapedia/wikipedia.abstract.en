, also romanized as JEDO, YEDO or YEDDO, is the former name of Tokyo.[1] It was the seat of power for the Tokugawa shogunate, which ruled Japan from 1603 to 1868. During this period, it grew to become one of the largest cities in the world and home to an urban culture centered on the notion of a "floating world".[2]


History

From the establishment of the Tokugawa _bakufu_ headquarters at Edo, the town became the _de facto_ capital and center of political power, although Kyoto remained the formal capital of the country. Edo grew from what had been a small, little-known fishing village in 1457 into the largest metropolis in the world with an estimated population of 1,000,000 by 1721.[3][4]

Edo was repeatedly devastated by fires, with the Great fire of Meireki in 1657 being the most disastrous. An estimated 100,000 people died in the fire. During the Edo period, there were about 100 fires mostly begun by accident and often quickly escalating and spreading through neighborhoods of wooden _machiya_ which were heated with charcoal fires. Between 1600 and 1945, Edo/Tokyo was leveled every 25–50 years or so by fire, earthquakes, or war.

In 1868, when the shogunate came to an end, the city was renamed _Tokyo_ ("eastern capital"). The emperor moved his residence to Tokyo, making the city the formal capital of Japan:

-   _Keiō 4_: On the 17th day of the 7th month (September 3, 1868), Edo was renamed Tokyo.[5]
-   _Keiō 4_: On the 27th day of the 8th month (October 12, 1868), Emperor Meiji was crowned in the _Shishin-den_ in Kyoto.[6]
-   _Keiō 4_: On the eighth day of the ninth month (October 23, 1868), the nengō was formally changed from _Keiō_ to _Meiji_ and a general amnesty was granted.[7]
-   _Meiji 2_: On the 23rd day of the 10th month (1868), the emperor went to Tokyo and Edo castle became an imperial palace.[8]

Magistrate

Ishimaru Sadatsuga was the magistrate of Edo in 1661.[9]


Government and administration

During the Edo period, Roju were senior officials that looked over the entire Shogunate government. Machi-bugyō (City Commissioners) were in charge of protecting the citizens and merchants of Edo, and Kanjō-bugyō (finance commissioners) were responsible for the financial matters of the Shogunate. [10]


Geography

The city was laid out as a castle town around Edo Castle. The area surrounding the castle known as _Yamanote_ consisted largely of _daimyō_ mansions, whose families lived in Edo as part of the _sankin kōtai_ system; the _daimyō_ made journeys in alternating years to Edo, and used the mansions for their entourages. It was this extensive samurai class which defined the character of Edo, particularly in contrast to the two major cities of Kyoto and Osaka neither of which were ruled by a _daimyō_ or had a significant samurai population. Kyoto's character was defined by the Imperial Court, the court nobles, its Buddhist temples and its history; Osaka was the country's commercial center, dominated by the _chōnin_ or the merchant class.

Areas further from the center were the domain of the _chōnin_ (町人, "townsfolk"). The area known as Shitamachi (下町, "lower town" or "downtown"), northeast of the castle, was a center of urban culture. The ancient Buddhist temple of Sensō-ji still stands in Asakusa, marking the center of an area of traditional Shitamachi culture. Some shops in the streets near the temple have existed continuously in the same location since the Edo period.

The Sumida River, then called the Great River (大川, _Ōkawa_), ran along the eastern edge of the city. The shogunate's official rice-storage warehouses,[11] other official buildings and some of the city's best-known restaurants were located here.

'' print by Hiroshige|alt=Illustration of people crossing the wooden Edo Bridge]] The "Japan Bridge" (日本橋, _Nihon-bashi_) marked the center of the city's commercial center, an area also known as _Kuramae_ (蔵前, "in front of the storehouses"). Fishermen, craftsmen and other producers and retailers operated here. Shippers managed ships known as _tarubune_ to and from Osaka and other cities, bringing goods into the city or transferring them from sea routes to river barges or land routes such as the Tōkaidō. This area remains the center of Tokyo's financial and business district.

The northeastern corner of the city was considered a dangerous direction in traditional _onmyōdō_ (cosmology), and is protected from evil by a number of temples including Sensō-ji and Kan'ei-ji. Beyond this were the districts of the _eta_ or outcasts, who performed "unclean" work and were separated from the main parts of the city. A path and a canal, a short distance north of the _eta_ districts, extended west from the riverbank leading along the northern edge of the city to the Yoshiwara pleasure districts. Previously located near Ningyocho, the districts were rebuilt in this more-remote location after the Great Fire of Meireki in 1657, as the city expanded.
