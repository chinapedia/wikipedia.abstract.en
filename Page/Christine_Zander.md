CHRISTINE ZANDER is an American television writer and producer. She is best known for her work as a writer on NBC's _Saturday Night Live_ (1986–1993).1 She began her comedy career performing for Second City in Chicago.[1]


Personal life

Zander is the daughter of Marie Zander, who died in May 2001. She has one brother Ernie Zander.[2] She married actor and writer Mark Nutter in 1987, and together they had son Andrew Nutter.[3][4] Nutter and Zander first met at the cabaret Cross-Currents in Chicago where they were both performing improvisational comedy, and Nutter also played keyboard for the Second City touring company.[5] The couple relocated from Chicago to New York City when Zander was offered a position at _Saturday Night Live_ in 1986. After six years of working for _Saturday Night Live_, Mark Nutter and Zander relocated with their baby to Los Angeles for Nutter to find more opportunities as a writer.[6] They have since divorced.[7]


Career

_Saturday Night Live_

Christine Zander joined the 1986 season of _Saturday Night Live_ along with other famous comedy writers such as Kevin Nealon and Phil Hartman. The first sketch Zander was able to get on the air starred Bill Murray as the one night stand of cast member Jan Hooks.[8] During her time there, she worked closely with Nora Dunn on various sketches.[9] When Dunn left the show, she became very close with Julia Sweeney, helping her craft sketches for the famous character “Pat,” an androgynous and cripplingly awkward boss.[10] Zander and Sweeney later collaborated on a fictional biography for the character, _It’s Pat! My Life Exposed_, which was published by Hyperion in September 1992.2 Her favorite sketches to write on the show were “Pat,” “Attitudes” starring John Malcovich, and “Their Eyes Evolved to Be on Their Breasts,” which involved women who developed eyes on their breasts so as to better meet the male gaze.[11]

When Zander joined the staff of _Saturday Night Live_, she and Rosie Shuster were the only two females on the writing staff.[12] In 1992 Zander told the _New York Times_,

  “If you don't have a lot of women to bounce ideas off or back you up it can get a little crazy around here. None of the men are individually sexist; it's just hard for them to have faith in something from a woman's point of view."[13]

Dunn, Zander, and cast member Jan Hooks developed a sketch about two female party singers called “The Sweeney Sisters.” Dunn recalls the sketch being ignored by the male-dominated writing staff.[14]

_3rd Rock from the Sun_

Zander began working as a producer and writer of the NBC sitcom _3rd Rock from the Sun_ in 1996.3 The sitcom followed a group of extraterrestrials sent to Earth to investigate human society, and it starred famous actors John Lithgow and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.[15] The show was fairly popular; its ratings ranked 22nd in the 1995 television season and 27th in the 1996 season. Zander eventually became executive producer of the series in 1999 and remained at that position until the show’s end in 2001.4
