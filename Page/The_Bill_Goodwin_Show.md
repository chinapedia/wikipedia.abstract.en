_THE BILL GOODWIN SHOW_ is a variety program that was broadcast on NBC television September 11, 1951 - March 27, 1952.[1]


Schedule

The program was seen on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, initially alternating days with _The Bert Parks Show_.[2] When the Parks program moved to CBS, a program headed by Ralph Edwards replaced it on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.[3]


Format

Sponsored by General Electric appliances,[4] the program featured music, songs, guest and interviews.[5] A reviewer for the trade publication Billboard found that the show's debut broadcast left much to be desired:

  The new _Bill Goodwin Show_ is described by NBC as "A variety-musical comedy-audience participation series with guest personalities." In a do-or-die attempt to live up to this ever-stuffed analysis of its content, the initial program fell flat on its format. . . Goodwin has a lot of charm and should click big in TV once NBC decides to let him be himself instead of Berle-Parks-and-O'Neill all rolled up into one impossible package.[6]


Personnel

Generally known as an announcer, Bill Goodwin left that role with _The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show_ to become the host of his own daytime program.[7] Eileen Barton and Roger Dann were vocalists, and the Joe Bushkin Trio provided instrumental music. Louis Cowan and Sherman Marks produced the show;[8] Bob E. Emerick was a writer.[9]
