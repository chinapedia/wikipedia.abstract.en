GILBERT AND SULLIVAN refers to the Victorian-era theatrical partnership of the dramatist W. S. Gilbert (1836–1911) and the composer Arthur Sullivan (1842–1900) and to the works they jointly created. The two men collaborated on fourteen comic operas between 1871 and 1896, of which _H.M.S. Pinafore_, _The Pirates of Penzance_ and _The Mikado_ are among the best known.[1]

Gilbert, who wrote the libretti for these operas, created fanciful "topsy-turvy" worlds where each absurdity is taken to its logical conclusion—fairies rub elbows with British lords, flirting is a capital offence, gondoliers ascend to the monarchy, and pirates emerge as noblemen who have gone astray.[2] Sullivan, six years Gilbert's junior, composed the music, contributing memorable melodies[3] that could convey both humour and pathos.[4]

Their operas have enjoyed broad and enduring international success and are still performed frequently throughout the English-speaking world.[5][6] Gilbert and Sullivan introduced innovations in content and form that directly influenced the development of musical theatre through the 20th century.[7] The operas have also influenced political discourse, literature, film and television and have been widely parodied and pastiched by humorists. Producer Richard D'Oyly Carte brought Gilbert and Sullivan together and nurtured their collaboration.[8] He built the Savoy Theatre in 1881 to present their joint works (which came to be known as the Savoy Operas) and founded the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which performed and promoted Gilbert and Sullivan's works for over a century.


Beginnings

Gilbert before Sullivan

Gentle_Alice_Brown.jpg'' "Gentle Alice Brown"]] Gilbert was born in London on 18 November 1836. His father, William, was a naval surgeon who later wrote novels and short stories, some of which included illustrations by his son.[9] In 1861, to supplement his income, the younger Gilbert began writing illustrated stories, poems and articles of his own, many of which would later be mined as inspiration for his plays and operas, particularly Gilbert's series of illustrated poems, the _Bab Ballads_.[10]

In the _Bab Ballads_ and his early plays, Gilbert developed a unique "topsy-turvy" style in which humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences, however absurd. Director and playwright Mike Leigh described the "Gilbertian" style as follows:

Gilbert developed his innovative theories on the art of stage direction, following theatrical reformer Tom Robertson.[11] At the time Gilbert began writing, theatre in Britain was in disrepute.[12] Gilbert helped to reform and elevate the respectability of the theatre, especially beginning with his six short family-friendly comic operas, or "entertainments", for Thomas German Reed.[13]

Ages_Ago.png'', during a rehearsal for which Frederic Clay introduced Gilbert to Sullivan]] At a rehearsal for one of these entertainments, _Ages Ago_, in 1870, the composer Frederic Clay introduced Gilbert to his friend, the young composer Arthur Sullivan.[14][15] Over the next year, before the two first collaborated, Gilbert continued to write humorous verse, stories and plays, including the comic operas _Our Island Home_ (1870) and _A Sensation Novel_ (1871), and the blank verse comedies _The Princess_ (1870), _The Palace of Truth_ (1870) and _Pygmalion and Galatea_ (1871).

Sullivan before Gilbert

Sullivan was born in London on 13 May 1842. His father was a military bandmaster, and by the time Arthur had reached the age of eight, he was proficient with all the instruments in the band. In school he began to compose anthems and songs. In 1856, he received the first Mendelssohn Scholarship and studied at the Royal Academy of Music and then at Leipzig, where he also took up conducting. His graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a suite of incidental music to Shakespeare's _The Tempest_. Revised and expanded, it was performed at the Crystal Palace in 1862 and was an immediate sensation. He began building a reputation as England's most promising young composer, composing a symphony, a concerto, and several overtures, among them the _Overture di Ballo_, in 1870.[16]

Crystal_Palace.PNG, where several early Sullivan works were first performed]] His early major works for the voice included _The Masque at Kenilworth_ (1864); an oratorio, _The Prodigal Son_ (1869); and a dramatic cantata, _On Shore and Sea_ (1871). He composed a ballet, _L'Île Enchantée_ (1864) and incidental music for a number of Shakespeare plays. Other early pieces that were praised were his _Symphony in E_, _Concerto for Cello and Orchestra_, and _Overture in C (In Memoriam)_ (all three of which premiered in 1866).[17] These commissions, however, were not sufficient to keep Sullivan afloat. He worked as a church organist and composed numerous hymns, popular songs, and parlour ballads.[18]

Sullivan's first foray into comic opera was _Cox and Box_ (1866), written with librettist F. C. Burnand for an informal gathering of friends. Public performance followed, with W. S. Gilbert (then writing dramatic criticism for the magazine _Fun_) saying that Sullivan's score "is, in many places, of too high a class for the grotesquely absurd plot to which it is wedded."[19] Nonetheless, it proved highly successful, and is still regularly performed today. Sullivan and Burnand's second opera, _The Contrabandista_ (1867) was not as successful.


Operas

First collaborations

_Thespis_

Thespis_-_Illustrated_London_News_Jan_6_1872.png of 6 January 1872]] In 1871, producer John Hollingshead brought Gilbert and Sullivan together to produce a Christmas entertainment, _Thespis_, at his Gaiety Theatre, a large West End house. The piece was an extravaganza in which the classical Greek gods, grown elderly, are temporarily replaced by a troupe of 19th-century actors and actresses, one of whom is the eponymous Thespis, the Greek father of the drama. Its mixture of political satire and grand opera parody mimicked Offenbach's _Orpheus in the Underworld_ and _La belle Hélène_, which (in translation) then dominated the English musical stage.[20][21]

_Thespis_ opened on Boxing Day and ran for 63 performances. It outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season, and its run was extended beyond the length of a normal run at the Gaiety,[22] but no one at the time anticipated that this was the beginning of a great collaboration. Unlike the later Gilbert and Sullivan works, it was hastily prepared, and its nature was more risqué, like Gilbert's earlier burlesques, with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors. Two of the male characters were played by women, whose shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that Gilbert later condemned.[23] The musical score to _Thespis_ was never published and is now lost, except for one song that was published separately, a chorus that was re-used in _The Pirates of Penzance_, and the Act II ballet music.[24]

Over the next three years, Gilbert and Sullivan did not have occasion to work together again, but each man became more eminent in his field. Gilbert worked with Frederic Clay on _Happy Arcadia_ (1872) and with Alfred Cellier on _Topsyturveydom_ (1874), and wrote _The Wicked World_ (1873) _Sweethearts_ (1874) and several other libretti, farces, extravaganzas, fairy comedies, dramas and adaptations. Sullivan completed his _Festival Te Deum_ (1872); another oratorio, _The Light of the World_ (1873); his only song cycle, _The Window; or, The Song of the Wrens_ (1871); incidental music to _The Merry Wives of Windsor_ (1874); and more songs, parlour ballads, and hymns, including "Onward, Christian Soldiers" (1872). At the same time, the audience for theatre was growing because of the rapidly expanding British population; improvement in education and the standard of living, especially of the middle class; improving public transportation; and installation of street lighting, which made travel home from the theatre safer. The number of pianos manufactured in England doubled between 1870 and 1890 as more people began to play parlour music at home and more theatres and concert halls opened.[25][26]

_Trial by Jury_

In 1874, Gilbert wrote a short libretto on commission from producer-conductor Carl Rosa, whose wife would have played the leading role, but her death in childbirth cancelled the project. Not long afterwards, Richard D'Oyly Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre and needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach's _La Périchole_. Carte knew about Gilbert's libretto for Rosa and suggested that Sullivan write a score for it. Gilbert read the piece to Sullivan in February 1875, and the composer was delighted with it; _Trial by Jury_ was composed and staged in a matter of weeks.[27]

Trial_by_Jury_-_Chaos_in_the_Courtroom.png's engraving of the original production of _Trial by Jury_]] The piece is one of Gilbert's humorous spoofs of the law and the legal profession, based on his short experience as a barrister. It concerns a breach of promise of marriage suit. The defendant argues that damages should be slight, since "he is such a very bad lot," while the plaintiff argues that she loves the defendant fervently and seeks "substantial damages." After much argument, the judge resolves the case by marrying the lovely plaintiff himself. With Sullivan's brother, Fred, as the Learned Judge, the opera was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of _La Périchole_. Provincial tours and productions at other theatres quickly followed.[28]

Fred Sullivan was the prototype for the "patter" (comic) baritone roles in the later operas. F. C. Burnand wrote that he "was one of the most naturally _comic little men_ I ever came across. He, too, was a first-rate practical musician.... As he was the most absurd person, so was he the very kindliest...."[29] Fred's creation would serve as a model for the rest of the collaborators' works, and each of them has a crucial _comic little man_ role, as Burnand had put it. The "patter" baritone (or "principal comedian", as these roles later were called) would often assume the leading role in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas, and was usually allotted the speedy patter songs.

After the success of _Trial by Jury_, Gilbert and Sullivan were suddenly in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of _Thespis_ for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but he was unable to obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.[30]

Early successes

_The Sorcerer_

Carte's real ambition was to develop an English form of light opera that would displace the bawdy burlesques and badly translated French operettas then dominating the London stage. He assembled a syndicate and formed the Comedy Opera Company, with Gilbert and Sullivan commissioned to write a comic opera that would serve as the centrepiece for an evening's entertainment.

Sorc-Pin-Trial.jpg Gilbert found a subject in one of his own short stories, "The Elixir of Love," which concerned the complications arising when a love potion is distributed to all the residents of a small village. The leading character was a Cockney businessman who happened to be a sorcerer, a purveyor of blessings (not much called for) and curses (very popular). Gilbert and Sullivan were tireless taskmasters, seeing to it that _The Sorcerer_ (1877) opened as a fully polished production, in marked contrast to the under-rehearsed _Thespis_.[31] While _The Sorcerer_ won critical acclaim, it did not duplicate the success of _Trial by Jury_. Nevertheless, Carte and his syndicate were sufficiently encouraged to commission another full-length opera from the team.

_H.M.S. Pinafore_

Gilbert and Sullivan scored their first international hit with _H.M.S. Pinafore_ (1878), satirising the rise of unqualified people to positions of authority and poking good-natured fun at the Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status (building on a theme introduced in _The Sorcerer_, love between members of different social classes). As with many of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise twist changes everything dramatically near the end of the story.

Gilbert oversaw the designs of sets and costumes, and he directed the performers on stage.[32] He sought realism in acting, shunned self-conscious interaction with the audience, and insisted on a standard of characterisation where the characters were never aware of their own absurdity.[33] Gilbert insisted that his actors know their words perfectly and obey his stage directions, which was something new to many actors of the day.[34] Sullivan personally oversaw the musical preparation. The result was a new crispness and polish in the English musical theatre.[35][36] As Jessie Bond wrote later:

_H.M.S. Pinafore_ ran in London for 571 performances,[37] the second longest run of any musical theatre piece in history up to that time (after the operetta _Les cloches de Corneville_).[38] Hundreds of unauthorised, or "pirated", productions of _Pinafore_ appeared in America.[39] During the run of _Pinafore_, Richard D'Oyly Carte split up with his former investors. The disgruntled former partners, who had invested in the production with no return, staged a public fracas, sending a group of thugs to seize the scenery during a performance. Stagehands successfully managed to ward off their backstage attackers.[40] This event cleared the way for Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan to form the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which then produced all of their succeeding operas.

The libretto of _H.M.S. Pinafore_ relied on stock character types, many of which were familiar from European opera (and some of which grew out of Gilbert's earlier association with the German Reeds): the heroic protagonist (tenor) and his love-interest (soprano); the older woman with a secret or a sharp tongue (contralto); the baffled lyric baritone—the girl's father; and a classic villain (bass-baritone). Gilbert and Sullivan added the element of the comic patter-singing character. With the success of _H.M.S. Pinafore_, the D'Oyly Carte repertory and production system was cemented, and each opera would make use of these stock character types. Before _The Sorcerer_, Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for, as had been the case with _Thespis_ and _Trial by Jury_. Building on the team he had assembled for _The Sorcerer_, Gilbert no longer hired stars; he created them. He and Sullivan selected the performers, writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars.

Pirate_King1.jpg The repertory system ensured that the comic patter character who performed the role of the sorcerer, John Wellington Wells, would become the ruler of the Queen's navy as Sir Joseph Porter in _H.M.S. Pinafore_, then join the army as Major-General Stanley in _The Pirates of Penzance_, and so on. Similarly, Mrs. Partlet in _The Sorcerer_ transformed into Little Buttercup in _Pinafore_, then into Ruth, the piratical maid-of-all-work in _Pirates_. Relatively unknown performers whom Gilbert and Sullivan engaged early in the collaboration would stay with the company for many years, becoming stars of the Victorian stage. These included George Grossmith, the principal comic; Rutland Barrington, the lyric baritone; Richard Temple, the bass-baritone; and Jessie Bond, the mezzo-soprano soubrette.

_The Pirates of Penzance_

_The Pirates of Penzance_ (New Year's Eve, 1879) also poked fun at grand opera conventions, sense of duty, family obligation, the "respectability" of civilisation and the peerage, and the relevance of a liberal education. The story also revisits _Pinafore_{{'}}s theme of unqualified people in positions of authority, in the person of the "modern Major-General" who has up-to-date knowledge about everything except the military. The Major-General and his many daughters escape from the tender-hearted Pirates of Penzance, who are all orphans, on the false plea that he is an orphan himself. The pirates learn of the deception and re-capture the Major-General, but when it is revealed that the pirates are all peers, the Major-General bids them: "resume your ranks and legislative duties, and take my daughters, all of whom are beauties!"

The piece premiered in New York rather than London, in an (unsuccessful) attempt to secure the American copyright,[41] and was another big success with both critics and audiences.[42] Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte tried for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas, without success.[43] Nevertheless, _Pirates_ was a hit both in New York, again spawning numerous imitators, and then in London, and it became one of the most frequently performed, translated and parodied Gilbert and Sullivan works, also enjoying successful 1981 Broadway[44] and 1982 West End revivals by Joseph Papp that continue to influence productions of the opera.[45]

In 1880, Sullivan's cantata _The Martyr of Antioch_ premiered at the Leeds Triennial Music Festival, with a libretto modified by Gilbert from an 1822 epic poem by Henry Hart Milman concerning the 3rd century martyrdom of St. Margaret of Antioch. Sullivan became the conductor of the Leeds festival beginning in 1880 and conducted the performance. The Carl Rosa Opera Company staged the cantata as an opera in 1898.[46]

Savoy Theatre opens

_Patience_

George_Grossmith_as_Bunthorne,_Patience,_1881.jpg as Bunthorne in _Patience_, 1881]] _Patience_ (1881) satirised the aesthetic movement in general and its colourful poets in particular, combining aspects of Algernon Charles Swinburne, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Oscar Wilde, James McNeill Whistler and others in the rival poets Bunthorne and Grosvenor. Grossmith, who created the role of Bunthorne, based his makeup, wig and costume on Swinburne and especially Whistler, as seen in the adjacent photo.[47] The work also lampoons male vanity and chauvinism in the military. The story concerns two rival "aesthetic" poets, who attract the attention of the young ladies of the village, who had been engaged to the members of a cavalry regiment. But both poets are in love with Patience, the village milkmaid, who detests one of them and feels that it is her duty to avoid the other despite her love for him. Richard D'Oyly Carte was the booking manager for Oscar Wilde, a then lesser-known proponent of aestheticism, and dispatched Wilde on an American lecture tour in conjunction with the opera's U.S. run, so that American audiences might better understand what the satire was all about.

During the run of _Patience_, Carte built the large, modern Savoy Theatre, which became the partnership's permanent home. It was the first theatre (indeed the world's first public building) to be lit entirely by electric lighting.[48] _Patience_ moved into the Savoy after six months at the Opera Comique and ran for a total of 578 performances, surpassing the run of _H.M.S. Pinafore_ and becoming the second longest-running work of musical theatre up to that time in history.[49]

_Iolanthe_

_Iolanthe_ (1882) was the first of the operas to open at the Savoy. The fully electric Savoy made possible numerous special effects, such as sparkling magic wands for the female chorus of fairies. The opera poked fun at English law and the House of Lords and made much of the war between the sexes. The critics felt that Sullivan's work in _Iolanthe_ had taken a step forward. _The Daily Telegraph_ wrote, "The composer has risen to his opportunity, and we are disposed to account _Iolanthe_ his best effort in all the Gilbertian series."[50] Similarly, the _Theatre_ asserted that "the music of _Iolanthe_ is Dr Sullivan's _chef d'oeuvre_. The quality throughout is more even, and maintained at a higher standard, than in any of his earlier works..."[51]

Barnett_as_Fairy_Queen.jpg as The Fairy Queen]] _Iolanthe_ is one of a number of Gilbert's works, including _The Wicked World_ (1873), _Broken Hearts_ (1875), _Princess Ida_ (1884) and _Fallen Fairies_ (1909), where the introduction of men and "mortal love" into a tranquil world of women wreaks havoc with the status quo.[52] Gilbert had created several "fairy comedies" at the Haymarket Theatre in the early 1870s. These plays, influenced by the fairy work of James Planché, are founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference.[53]

In 1882, Gilbert had a telephone installed in his home and at the prompt desk at the Savoy Theatre so that he could monitor performances and rehearsals from his home study. Gilbert had referred to the new technology in _Pinafore_ in 1878, only two years after the device was invented and before London even had telephone service. Sullivan had one installed as well, and on 13 May 1883, at a party to celebrate the composer's 41st birthday, the guests, including the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), heard a direct relay of parts of _Iolanthe_ from the Savoy. This was probably the first live "broadcast" of an opera.[54]

During the run of _Iolanthe_, in 1883, Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria. Although it was the operas with Gilbert that had earned him the broadest fame, the honour was conferred for his services to serious music. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera—that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera.[55] Sullivan, despite the financial security of writing for the Savoy, increasingly viewed his work with Gilbert as unimportant, beneath his skills, and repetitious. Furthermore, he was unhappy that he had to simplify his music to ensure that Gilbert's words could be heard. But paradoxically, in February 1883, just after _Iolanthe_ opened, Sullivan had signed a five-year agreement with Gilbert and Carte requiring him to produce a new comic opera on six months' notice.[56]

_Princess Ida_

William_Russell_Flint_-_W._S._Gilbert_-_Savoy_Operas_-_Princess_Ida_6.jpg _Princess Ida_ (1884) spoofed women's education and male chauvinism and continued the theme from _Iolanthe_ of the war between the sexes. The opera is based on Tennyson's poem _The Princess: A Medley_. Gilbert had written a blank verse farce based on the same material in 1870, called _The Princess_, and he reused a good deal of the dialogue from his earlier play in the libretto of _Princess Ida_. _Ida_ is the only Gilbert and Sullivan work with dialogue entirely in blank verse and is also the only one of their works in three acts. Lillian Russell had been engaged to create the title role, but Gilbert did not believe that she was dedicated enough, and when she missed a rehearsal, he dismissed her.[57]

_Princess Ida_ was the first of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas that, by the partnership's previous standards, was not a success. A particularly hot summer in London did not help ticket sales. The piece ran for a comparatively short 246 performances and was not revived in London until 1919. Sullivan had been satisfied with the libretto, but two months after _Ida_ opened, Sullivan told Carte that "it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself."[58] As _Princess Ida_ showed signs of flagging, Carte realised that, for the first time in the partnership's history, no new opera would be ready when the old one closed. On 22 March 1884, he gave Gilbert and Sullivan contractual notice that a new opera would be required in six months' time.[59] In the meantime, when _Ida_ closed, Carte produced a revival of _The Sorcerer_.

Dodging the magic lozenge

_The Mikado_

The_Mikado_Three_Little_Maids.jpg The most successful of the Savoy Operas was _The Mikado_ (1885), which made fun of English bureaucracy, thinly disguised by a Japanese setting. Gilbert initially proposed a story for a new opera about a magic lozenge that would change the characters,[60] which Sullivan found artificial and lacking in "human interest and probability", as well as being too similar to their earlier opera, _The Sorcerer_. As dramatised in the film _Topsy-Turvy_,[61] the author and composer were at an impasse until 8 May 1884, when Gilbert dropped the lozenge idea and agreed to provide a libretto without any supernatural elements.

The story focuses on a "cheap tailor," Ko-Ko, who is promoted to the position of Lord High Executioner of the town of Titipu. Ko-Ko loves his ward, Yum-Yum, but she loves a musician, who is really the son of the emperor of Japan (the Mikado), and who is in disguise to escape the attentions of the elderly and amorous Katisha. The Mikado has decreed that executions must resume without delay in Titipu. When news arrives that the Mikado will be visiting the town, Ko-Ko assumes that he is coming to ascertain whether Ko-Ko has carried out the executions. Too timid to execute anyone, Ko-Ko cooks up a conspiracy to misdirect the Mikado, which goes awry. Eventually, Ko-Ko must persuade Katisha to marry him, in order to save his own life and the lives of the other conspirators.

With the opening of trade between England and Japan, Japanese imports, art and styles became fashionable in London, making the time ripe for an opera set in Japan. Gilbert said, "I cannot give you a good reason for our... piece being laid in Japan. It... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, and I think that the idea of a chief magistrate, who is... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public."[62]

Setting the opera in Japan, an exotic locale far away from Britain, allowed Gilbert and Sullivan to satirise British politics and institutions more freely by clothing them in superficial Japanese trappings. Gilbert wrote, "The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution."[63] G. K. Chesterton compared it to Jonathan Swift's _Gulliver's Travels_: "Gilbert pursued and persecuted the evils of modern England till they had literally not a leg to stand on, exactly as Swift did... I doubt if there is a single joke in the whole play that fits the Japanese. But all the jokes in the play fit the English. ... About England Pooh-bah is something more than a satire; he is the truth."[64] Several of the later operas are similarly set in foreign or fictional locales, including _The Gondoliers_, _Utopia Limited_, and _The Grand Duke_.

_The Mikado_ became the partnership's longest-running hit, enjoying 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre, which was the second longest run for any work of musical theatre (surpassing the 571 performances of _Pinafore_ and 576 of _Patience_) and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that time.[65] _The Mikado_ remains the most frequently performed Savoy Opera.[66] It has been translated into numerous languages and is one of the most frequently played musical theatre pieces in history.[67]

_Ruddigore_

_Ruddigore_ (1887), a topsy-turvy take on Victorian melodrama, was less successful than most of the earlier collaborations with a run of 288 performances. The original title, _Ruddygore_, together with some of the plot devices, including the revivification of ghosts, drew negative comments from critics.[68] Gilbert and Sullivan respelled the title and made a number of changes and cuts.[69] Nevertheless, the piece was profitable,[70] and the reviews were not all bad. For instance, the _Illustrated London News_ praised the work and both Gilbert and, especially, Sullivan: "Sir Arthur Sullivan has eminently succeeded alike in the expression of refined sentiment and comic humour. In the former respect, the charm of graceful melody prevails; while, in the latter, the music of the most grotesque situations is redolent of fun."[71] Further changes were made, including a new overture, when Rupert D'Oyly Carte revived _Ruddigore_ after the First World War, and the piece was regularly performed by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company thereafter.[72]

Some of the plot elements of _Ruddigore_ were introduced by Gilbert in his earlier one-act opera, _Ages Ago_ (1869), including the tale of the wicked ancestor and the device of the ghostly ancestors stepping out of their portraits.[73][74] When _Ruddigore_ closed, no new opera was ready. Gilbert again proposed a version of the "lozenge" plot for their next opera, and Sullivan reiterated his reluctance to set it.[75] While the two men worked out their artistic differences, and Sullivan finished other obligations, Carte produced revivals of such old favourites as _H.M.S. Pinafore_, _The Pirates of Penzance_, and _The Mikado_.[76]

_The Yeomen of the Guard_

Denny_and_Bond.jpg as Wilfred and Jessie Bond as Phoebe in _Yeomen_]]_The Yeomen of the Guard_ (1888), their only joint work with a serious ending, concerns a pair of strolling players—a jester and a singing girl—who are caught up in a risky intrigue at the Tower of London during the 16th century. The dialogue, though in prose, is quasi-early modern English in style, and there is no satire of British institutions. For some of the plot elements, Gilbert had reached back to his 1875 tragedy, _Broken Hearts_. _The Times_ praised the libretto: "It should... be acknowledged that Mr. Gilbert has earnestly endeavoured to leave familiar grooves and rise to higher things."[77] Although not a grand opera, the new libretto provided Sullivan with the opportunity to write his most ambitious score to date. The critics, who had recently lauded the composer for his successful oratorio, _The Golden Legend_, considered the score to _Yeomen_ to be Sullivan's finest, including its overture, which was written in sonata form, rather than as a sequential pot-pourri of tunes from the opera, as in most of his other overtures. The _Daily Telegraph_ wrote:

_Yeomen_ was a hit, running for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions. During the run, on 12 March 1889, Sullivan wrote to Gilbert,

Sullivan insisted that the next opera must be a grand opera. Gilbert did not feel that he could write a grand opera libretto, but he offered a compromise that Sullivan eventually accepted. The two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan a grand opera (_Ivanhoe_) for a new theatre that Carte was constructing to present British grand opera. After a brief impasse over the choice of subject, Sullivan accepted an idea connected with Venice and Venetian life, as "this seemed to me to hold out great chances of bright colour and taking music."[78]

_The Gondoliers_

Marco_and_Giuseppe.jpg and Courtice Pounds as Giuseppe and Marco in _The Gondoliers_]] _The Gondoliers_ (1889) takes place partly in Venice and partly in a kingdom ruled by a pair of gondoliers who attempt to remodel the monarchy in a spirit of "republican equality."[79] Gilbert recapitulates a number of his earlier themes, including the satire of class distinctions figuring in many of his earlier librettos. The libretto also reflects Gilbert's fascination with the "Stock Company Act", highlighting the absurd convergence of natural persons and legal entities, which plays an even larger part in the next opera, _Utopia Limited_. Press accounts were almost entirely favourable. The _Illustrated London News_ reported:

Sullivan's old collaborator on _Cox and Box_ (later the editor of _Punch_ magazine), F. C. Burnand, wrote to the composer: "Magnificento!...I envy you and W.S.G. being able to place a piece like this on the stage in so complete a fashion."[80] The opera enjoyed a run longer than any of their other joint works except for _H.M.S. Pinafore_, _Patience_ and _The Mikado_. There was a command performance of _The Gondoliers_ for Queen Victoria and the royal family at Windsor Castle in 1891, the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be so honoured. _The Gondoliers_ was Gilbert and Sullivan's last great success.

Carpet quarrel

Gilbert and Sullivan sometimes had a strained working relationship, partly caused by the fact that each man saw himself as allowing his work to be subjugated to the other's, and partly caused by the opposing personalities of the two—Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin-skinned (though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness), while Sullivan eschewed conflict.[81] In addition, Gilbert imbued his libretti with "topsy-turvy" situations in which the social order was turned upside down. After a time, these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan's desire for realism and emotional content.[82] Also, Gilbert's political satire often poked fun at the wealthy and powerful whom Sullivan sought out for friendship and patronage.[83]

1881_Savoy_Theatre.jpg c.1881]] Gilbert and Sullivan disagreed several times over the choice of a subject. After both _Princess Ida_ and _Ruddigore_, which were less successful than the seven other operas from _H.M.S. Pinafore_ to _The Gondoliers_, Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.[84]

In April 1890, however, during the run of _The Gondoliers_, Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production. Among other items to which Gilbert objected, Carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership.[85] Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Gilbert confronted Carte, who refused to reconsider the accounts. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that "I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen".[86] Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte "in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial."[87] As scholar Andrew Crowther has explained:

PeaceOfferingG&S.jpg Things soon degraded, a legal hearing was held, and Sullivan supported Carte by making an affidavit erroneously stating that there were minor legal expenses outstanding from a battle Gilbert had in 1884 with Lillian Russell.[88] On 5 May 1890, Gilbert had written to Sullivan: "The time for putting an end to our collaboration has at last arrived."[89] Gilbert later asked Sullivan to say he had been mistaken in his affidavit, but Sullivan refused. Gilbert felt it was a moral issue, and could not look past it. Sullivan felt that Gilbert was questioning his good faith, and in any event, Sullivan had other reasons to stay in Carte's good graces: Carte was building a new theatre, the Royal English Opera House, to produce Sullivan's only grand opera, _Ivanhoe_.[90] Gilbert brought suit, and after _The Gondoliers_ closed in 1891, he withdrew the performance rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy.[91]

Gilbert next wrote _The Mountebanks_ with Alfred Cellier and the flop _Haste to the Wedding_ with George Grossmith,[92] and Sullivan wrote _Haddon Hall_ with Sydney Grundy. Gilbert eventually won the lawsuit, but his actions and statements had been hurtful to his partners. Nevertheless, the partnership had been so profitable that, after the financial failure of the Royal English Opera House, Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer.[93] In late 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation, Gilbert and Sullivan's music publisher, Tom Chappell, stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks he had succeeded, eventually leading to two further collaborations between Gilbert and Sullivan.[94]

Last works

Utopia_Limited_Poster.jpg'']] _Utopia, Limited_ (1893), their penultimate opera, was a very modest success, and their last, _The Grand Duke_ (1896), was an outright failure.[95] Neither work entered the canon of regularly performed Gilbert and Sullivan works until the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s. Gilbert had also offered Sullivan another libretto, _His Excellency_ (1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh, his protege from _Utopia_, led to Sullivan's refusal, and _His Excellency_ was instead composed by F. Osmond Carr.[96] Meanwhile, the Savoy Theatre continued to revive the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, in between new pieces, and D'Oyly Carte touring companies also played them in repertory.

Glad_to_See_You_Together.png After _The Grand Duke_, the partners saw no reason to work together again. A last unpleasant misunderstanding occurred in 1898. At the premiere of Sullivan’s opera _The Beauty Stone_ on 28 May, Gilbert arrived at the Savoy Theatre with friends, assuming that Sullivan had reserved some seats for him. Instead, he was informed that Sullivan objected to his presence. The composer later denied that this was true.[97] The last time they met was at the Savoy Theatre on 17 November 1898 at the celebration of the 21st anniversary of the first performance of _The Sorcerer_. They did not speak to each other.[98] Sullivan, by this time in exceedingly poor health, died in 1900, although to the end he continued to write new comic operas for the Savoy with other librettists, most successfully with Basil Hood in _The Rose of Persia_ (1899). Gilbert also wrote several works, some with other collaborators, in the 1890s. By the time of Sullivan's death in 1900, Gilbert wrote that any memory of their rift had been "completely bridged over," and "the most cordial relations existed between us."[99][100] He stated that "Sullivan ... because he was a composer of the rarest genius, was as modest and as unassuming as a neophyte should be, but seldom is...I remember all that he has done for me in allowing his genius to shed some of its lustre upon my humble name."[101]

Richard D'Oyly Carte died in 1901, and his widow, Helen, continued to direct the activities of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy and on tour. Gilbert went into semi-retirement, although he continued to direct revivals of the Savoy Operas and wrote new plays occasionally. Between 1906 and 1909, he assisted Mrs. Carte in staging two repertory seasons at the Savoy Theatre. These were very popular and revived interest in the works.[102] Gilbert was knighted during the first repertory season.[103] After Sullivan's death, Gilbert wrote only one more comic opera, _Fallen Fairies_ (1909; music by Edward German), which was not a success.[104][105]


Legacy and assessment

Gilbert died in 1911, and Richard's son, Rupert D'Oyly Carte, took over the opera company upon his step-mother's death in 1913. His daughter, Bridget, inherited the company upon his death in 1948. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company toured nearly year-round, except for its many London seasons and foreign tours, performing exclusively the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, until it closed in 1982. During the 20th century, the company gave well over 35,000 performances.[106][107] The Savoy operas, from the beginning, were produced extensively in North America and Australasia, and soon afterwards in Germany, Russia, and elsewhere in Europe and around the world.[108]

D'oyly-carte-the-joy-of-three-generations-1921.jpg In 1922, Sir Henry Wood explained the enduring success of the collaboration as follows:

G. K. Chesterton similarly praised the combination of the two artists, anticipating the operas' success into the "remote future". He wrote that Gilbert's satire was "too intelligent to be intelligible" by itself, and that perhaps only Sullivan could have given "wings to his words ... in exactly the right degree frivolous and exactly the right degree fastidious. [The words'] precise degree of levity and distance from reality ... seemed to be expressed ... in the very notes of the music; almost ... in the note of the laughter that followed it."[109] In 1957, a review in _The Times_ gave this rationale for "the continued vitality of the Savoy operas":

Because of the unusual success of the operas, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company were able, from the start, to license the works to other professional companies, such as the J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company, and to amateur troupes. For almost a century, until the British copyrights expired at the end of 1961, and even afterwards, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company influenced productions of the operas worldwide, creating a "performing tradition" for most of the operas that is still referred to today by many directors, both amateur and professional.[110] Indeed, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte had an important influence on amateur theatre. Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that, prior to the creation of the Savoy operas, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals. After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies in the 1880s licensed to perform the operas, professionals recognised that the amateur performing groups "support the culture of music and the drama. They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites."[111] Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to "the popularity of, and infectious craze for performing, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas".[112] The National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) was founded in 1899. It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 British troupes were performing Gilbert and Sullivan that year, constituting most of the amateur companies in the country (this figure included only the societies that were members of NODA). The association further reported that almost 1,000 performances of the Savoy operas had been given in Britain that year, many of them to benefit charities.[113] Cellier and Bridgeman noted that strong amateur groups were performing the operas in places as far away as New Zealand.[114] In the U.S., and elsewhere where British copyrights on the operas were not enforced, both professional and amateur companies performed the works throughout the 20th century – the Internet Broadway Database counts about 150 productions on Broadway alone from 1900 to 1960. The Savoy Company, an amateur group formed in 1901 in Philadelphia, continues to perform today.[115][116] In 1948, _Life_ magazine reported that about 5,000 performances of Gilbert and Sullivan operas were given annually in the US, exceeding the number of performances of Shakespeare plays.[117]

After the copyrights on the operas expired, other professional companies were free to perform and record the operas. Many performing companies arose to produce the works, such as Gilbert and Sullivan for All in Britain[118] and Light Opera Works in the U.S., and existing companies, such as English National Opera, Carl Rosa Opera Company and Australian Opera, added Gilbert and Sullivan to their repertories.[119] In 1980, a Broadway and West End production of _Pirates_ produced by Joseph Papp brought new audiences to Gilbert and Sullivan. Between 1988 and 2003, the revived D'Oyly Carte Opera Company revived the operas on tour and on the West End.[120] Today, many professional repertory companies, such as NYGASP, Opera della Luna, Opera a la Carte, National Gilbert & Sullivan Opera Company Opera North, Ohio Light Opera and other small opera companies, and numerous amateur societies, churches, schools and universities continue to produce the works.[121][122] The most popular G&S works also continue to be performed from time to time by major opera companies,[123][124] and recordings of the operas, overtures and songs from the operas continue to be released.[125][126] Since 1994, the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival has been held every August in England, with some two dozen or more performances of the operas given on the main stage, and several dozen related "fringe" events given in smaller venues.[127][128] The Festival records and offers videos of its most popular professional and amateur productions.[129] In connection with the 2009 festival, a contemporary critic wrote, "The appeal of G&S’s special blend of charm, silliness and gentle satire seems immune to fashion."[130] There continue to be hundreds of amateur companies performing the Gilbert and Sullivan works worldwide.[131]

Recordings and broadcasts

Mikado-1917.jpg'', 1917]] The first commercial recordings of individual numbers from the Savoy operas began in 1898. In 1917 the Gramophone Company (HMV) produced the first album of a complete Gilbert and Sullivan opera, _The Mikado_, followed by recordings of eight more.[132] Electrical recordings of most of the operas were then issued by HMV and Victor, beginning in the late 1920s, supervised by Rupert D'Oyly Carte.[133] The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to produce well-regarded recordings until 1979, helping to keep the operas popular through the decades. Many of these recordings have been reissued on CD.[134] After the company was revived in 1988, it recorded seven of the operas.[135]

After the copyrights on the operas expired, numerous companies around the world released popular audio and video recordings of the operas.[136][137] In 1966 and again in the 1980s, BBC Radio presented complete cycles of the thirteen extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas, with dialogue.[138] Ad hoc casts of operatic singers conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent in the 1950s and 60s[139] and Sir Charles Mackerras in the 1990s[140] have made audio sets of several Savoy operas, and in the 1980s Alexander Faris conducted video recordings of eleven of the operas (omitting the last two) with casts including show-business stars as well as professional singers.[141] Joseph Papp's Broadway production of _The Pirates of Penzance_ was put on record in 1981.[142][143] Since 1994, the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival has released numerous professional and amateur CDs and videos of its productions.[144] Ohio Light Opera has recorded several of the operas in the 21st century.[145]

Cultural influence

Detail_from_Design_for_an_Aesthetic_theatrical_poster.png'' cartoon, showing Sullivan and Gilbert.]] In the past 125 years, Gilbert and Sullivan have pervasively influenced popular culture in the English-speaking world,[146] and lines and quotations from their operas have become part of the English language (even if not originated by Gilbert), such as "short, sharp shock", "What never? Well, hardly ever!", "let the punishment fit the crime", and "A policeman's lot is not a happy one".[147][148] The operas have influenced political style and discourse, literature, film and television, have been widely parodied by humorists, and have been quoted in legal rulings.[149]

The American and British musical owes a tremendous debt to G&S,[150][151] who were admired and copied by early musical theatre authors and composers such as Ivan Caryll, Adrian Ross, Lionel Monckton, P. G. Wodehouse,[152][153] Guy Bolton and Victor Herbert, and later Jerome Kern, Ira Gershwin, Yip Harburg,[154] Irving Berlin, Ivor Novello, Oscar Hammerstein II, and Andrew Lloyd Webber.[155] Gilbert's lyrics served as a model for such 20th-century Broadway lyricists as Cole Porter,[156] Ira Gershwin,[157] and Lorenz Hart.[158] Noël Coward wrote: "I was born into a generation that still took light music seriously. The lyrics and melodies of Gilbert and Sullivan were hummed and strummed into my consciousness at an early age. My father sang them, my mother played them, my nurse, Emma, breathed them through her teeth.... My aunts and uncles... sang them singly and in unison at the slightest provocation...."[159]

Professor Carolyn Williams has noted, however: "The influence of Gilbert and Sullivan – their wit and sense of irony, the send ups of politics and contemporary culture – goes beyond musical theater to comedy in general. Allusions to their work have made their way into our own popular culture".[160] Gilbert and Sullivan expert and enthusiast Ian Bradley agrees:

The works of Gilbert and Sullivan are themselves frequently pastiched and parodied.[161][162] Well known examples of this include Tom Lehrer's _The Elements_ and _Clementine_;[163] Allan Sherman's _I'm Called Little Butterball_, _When I Was a Lad_, _You Need an Analyst_ and _The Bronx Bird-Watcher_;[164][165] and The Two Ronnies' 1973 Christmas Special.[166] Other comedians have used Gilbert and Sullivan songs as a key part of their routines, including Hinge and Bracket,[167] Anna Russell,[168] and the _HMS Yakko_ episode of the animated TV series _Animaniacs_. Songs from Gilbert and Sullivan are often pastiched in advertising, and elaborate advertising parodies have been published, as have the likenesses of various Gilbert and Sullivan performers throughout the decades.[169] Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas are commonly referenced in literature, film and television in various ways that include extensive use of Sullivan's music or where action occurs during a performance of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, such as in the film _The Girl Said No_.[170] There are also a number of Gilbert and Sullivan biographical films, such as Mike Leigh's _Topsy-Turvy_ (2000) and _The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan_ (1953), as well as shows about the partnership, including a 1938 Broadway show, _Knights of Song_[171] and a 1975 West End show called _Tarantara! Tarantara!_[172][173]

It is not surprising, given the focus of Gilbert on politics, that politicians and political observers have often found inspiration in these works. Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist added gold stripes to his judicial robes after seeing them used by the Lord Chancellor in a production of _Iolanthe_.[174] Alternatively, Lord Chancellor Charles Falconer is recorded as objecting so strongly to _Iolanthe_'s comic portrayal of Lord Chancellors that he supported moves to disband the office.[175] British politicians, beyond quoting some of the more famous lines, have delivered speeches in the form of Gilbert and Sullivan pastiches. These include Conservative Peter Lilley's speech mimicking the form of "I've got a little list" from _The Mikado_, listing those he was against, including "sponging socialists" and "young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue".[176] Political humour based on Gilbert and Sullivan's style and characters continues to be written.[177]

Overtures

The overtures from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas remain popular, and there are many recordings of them.[178] Most of them are structured as a _potpourri_ of tunes from the operas. They are generally well-orchestrated, but not all of them were composed by Sullivan. However, even those delegated to his assistants were based on an outline he provided,[179] and in many cases incorporated his suggestions or corrections.[180] Sullivan invariably conducted them (as well as the entire operas) on opening night, and they were included in the published scores approved by Sullivan.[181]

Those Sullivan wrote himself include the overtures to _Thespis_, _Iolanthe_, _Princess Ida_, _The Yeomen of the Guard_, _The Gondoliers_ and _The Grand Duke_. Sullivan's authorship of the overture to _Utopia, Limited_ cannot be verified with certainty, as his autograph score is now lost, but it is likely attributable to him, as it consists of only a few bars of introduction, followed by a straight copy of music heard elsewhere in the opera (the Drawing Room scene). _Thespis_ is now lost, but there is no doubt that Sullivan wrote its overture.[182] Very early performances of _The Sorcerer_ used a section of Sullivan's incidental music to Shakespeare's _Henry the VIII_, as he did not have time to write a new overture, but this was replaced in 1884 by one executed by Hamilton Clarke.[183] Of those remaining, the overtures to _H.M.S. Pinafore_ and _The Pirates of Penzance_ are by Alfred Cellier,[184] the overture to _Patience_ is by Eugene d'Albert,[185] and those to _The Mikado_ and _Ruddigore_ are by Hamilton Clarke (although the _Ruddigore_ overture was later replaced by one written by Geoffrey Toye).[186]

Most of the overtures are in three sections: a lively introduction, a slow middle section, and a concluding allegro in sonata form, with two subjects, a brief development, a recapitulation and a coda. However, Sullivan himself did not always follow this pattern. The overture to _Princess Ida_, for instance, has only an opening fast section and a concluding slow section. The overture to _Utopia Limited_ is dominated by a slow section, with only a very brief original passage introducing it.[187]

In the 1920s, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company commissioned its musical director at the time, Geoffrey Toye, to write new overtures for _Ruddigore_ and _The Pirates of Penzance_. Toye's _Ruddigore_ overture entered the general repertory, and today is more often heard than the original overture by Clarke.[188] Toye's _Pirates_ overture, however, did not last long and is now presumed lost.[189] Sir Malcolm Sargent devised a new ending for the overture to _The Gondoliers_, adding the "cachucha" from the second act of the opera. This gave the _Gondoliers_ overture the familiar fast-slow-fast pattern of most of the rest of the Savoy Opera overtures, and this version has competed for popularity with Sullivan's original version.[190][191]


Alternative versions

Translations

Gilbert and Sullivan operas have been translated into many languages, including Portuguese, Yiddish, Hebrew, Swedish, Dutch, Danish, Estonian, Hungarian, Russian, Japanese, French, Italian, Spanish (reportedly including a version of _Pinafore_ transformed into zarzuela style), Catalan and others.[192]

There are many German versions of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, including the popular _Der Mikado_. There is even a German version of _The Grand Duke_. Some German translations were made by Friedrich Zell and Richard Genée, librettists of _Die Fledermaus_ and other Viennese operettas, who even translated one of Sullivan's lesser-known operas, _The Chieftain_, as _(Der Häuptling)_.

Ballets

-   _Pirates of Penzance - The Ballet!_, created for the Queensland Ballet in 1991
-   _Pineapple Poll_, created by John Cranko in 1951 at Sadler's Wells Theatre; in repertoire at the Birmingham Royal Ballet. The ballet is based on Gilbert's 1870 Bab Ballad "The Bumboat Woman's Story", as is _H.M.S. Pinafore_. Cranko expanded the plotline of Gilbert's poem and added a happy ending. The music is arranged by Sir Charles Mackerras from themes by Sullivan.

Adaptations

W._S._Gilbert_-_Alice_B._Woodward_-_The_Pinafore_Picture_Book_-_Frontispiece.jpg Gilbert adapted the stories of _H.M.S. Pinafore_ and _The Mikado_ into children's books called _The Pinafore Picture Book_ and _The Story of The Mikado_ giving, in some cases, backstory that is not found in the librettos.[193][194][195] Many other children's books have since been written retelling the stories of the operas or adapting characters or events from them.[196] In the 19th century, the most popular Gilbert and Sullivan songs and music were adapted as dance pieces.[197]

Many musical theatre and film adaptations of the operas have been produced, including the following:

-   _The Swing Mikado_ (1938; Chicago – all-black cast)
-   _The Hot Mikado_ (1939) and _Hot Mikado_ (1986)
-   _The Jazz Mikado_ (1927, Berlin)
-   _Hollywood Pinafore_ (1945)
-   _The Cool Mikado_ (1962 film)
-   _The Black Mikado_ (1975)
-   _Dick Deadeye, or Duty Done_ (1975 animated film)
-   _The Pirate Movie_ (1982 film)
-   _The Ratepayers' Iolanthe_ (1984; Olivier Award-winning musical) adapted by Ned Sherrin and Alistair Beaton[198]
-   _Metropolitan Mikado_ (political satire adapted by Sherrin and Beaton, first performed at Queen Elizabeth Hall (1985) starring Louise Gold, Simon Butteriss, Rosemary Ashe, Robert Meadmore and Martin Smith)[199]
-   _Di Yam Gazlonim_ by Al Grand (1986; a Yiddish adaptation of _Pirates_; a New York production was nominated for a 2007 Drama Desk Award)[200]
-   _Pinafore! (A Saucy, Sexy, Ship-Shape New Musical)_ (adapted by Mark Savage, first performed at the Celebration Theater in Los Angeles, California in 2001; only one character is female, and all but one of the male characters are gay.[201]
-   _Gondoliers_: A Mafia-themed adaptation of the opera, broadly rewritten by John Doyle and orchestrated and arranged Sarah Travis, was given at the Watermill Theatre and transferred to the Apollo Theatre in the West End in 2001. The production utilised Doyle's signature conceit of the actors playing their own orchestra instruments.[202]
-   _Parson's Pirates_ by Opera della Luna (2002)
-   _The Ghosts of Ruddigore_ by Opera della Luna (2003)
-   _Pinafore Swing_, Watermill Theatre (2004: another Doyle adaptation in which the actors double as the orchestra)[203]

"Gilbert and Sullivan", Madison Savoyards, Ltd., accessed 21 May 2007, quotes Sullivan's recollection of Gilbert reading the libretto of _Trial by Jury_ to him: "As soon as he had come to the last word he closed up the manuscript violently, apparently unconscious of the fact that he had achieved his purpose so far as I was concerned, in as much as I was screaming with laughter the whole time."

D'Albert was a seventeen-year-old student at the National Training School (where Sullivan was the principal and supervisor of the composition dept.) and winner of the Mendelssohn Scholarship that year._" Several months before that, Sullivan had given d'Albert the task of preparing a piano reduction of _The Martyr of Antioch_ for use in choral rehearsals of that 1880 work. David Russell Hulme studied the handwriting in the score's manuscript and confirmed that it is that of Eugen, not of his father Charles (as had erroneously been reported by Jacobs), both of whose script he sampled and compared to the _Patience_ manuscript.
