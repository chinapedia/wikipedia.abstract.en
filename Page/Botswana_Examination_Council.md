Botswana General Certificate of Secondary Education (BGCSE)

Grading

The pass grades for BGCSE are, from highest to lowest, A*, A, B, C, D, E, F, G and U. The process to decide these grades involves the uniform mark scheme (UMS). Achieving less than 29% results in a U (unclassified). The maximum points a student can get is 48 points by six subjects. The table below shows the general grading system which is used when grading students in senior secondary which may be changed by BEC due to standardization.

  Grade   Percentage (%)   Points
  ------- ---------------- --------
  A*      85 - 100         8
  A       75 - 84          8
  B       65 - 74          7
  C       55 - 64          6
  D       45 - 54          5
  E       40 - 44          4
  F       35 - 39          3
  G       30 - 34          2
  U       0 - 29           0

Studying

The number of exams taken by students can vary. A typical route is to study eight+ subjects including core subjects. Five is usually the minimum number of credits required for university entrance, with some universities specifying the need for six subjects that are all C+. There is no limit set on the number of subjects one can study, and a number of students take 9 or more subjects.
