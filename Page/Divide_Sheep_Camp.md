The DIVIDE SHEEP CAMP, also known as NILAND'S CABINS, is a ranch site on the Little Snake River in Carbon County, Wyoming, near Baggs. The camp was established in 1909 for summer use by sheepmen of the Niland-Tierney Sheep Company and others in the Little Snake valley. Eventually becoming the Divide Sheep Company the company operated until 1974, leaving the structures intact. The principal elements are a one-story log cabin with a finished attic, measuring about by built in the early 1920s, a log bunkhouse dating to about 1914, a spring house and a generator shed. The site represents a moderately-well-preserved turn-of-the-century sheep camp.[1]

The Divide Sheep Camp was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 9, 1984.[2]
