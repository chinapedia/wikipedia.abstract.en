JOE GRACE was an Ireland international footballer.[1][2]


International career

On 21 March 1926, Grace made his only appearance for the Irish Free State national football team in a 3-0 defeat to Italy in Turin.[3]

His appearance at international level was controversial as the selectors included the former Belfast Celtic defender who was playing in the Leinster Senior League with Drumcondra at the time.

Grace had previously appeared for the Ireland amateur international team in November 1920 in a 4-0 defeat to England at Solitude, Belfast. This was an all island team.[4]


Club career

In 1927, Drumcondra became the first non-senior team south of the border to win the FAI Cup. They were competing in the Leinster Senior League at the time.

Grace, a tall, commanding, centre-half was hugely influential as Drumcondra defeated Brideville 1-0 in the final.

Drumcondra further enhanced their reputation and paved their way for promotion to the League of Ireland by reaching the final again the following year losing 2-1 to Bohemians.
