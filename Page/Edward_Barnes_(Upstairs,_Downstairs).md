'''Edward Barnes '''(born 24 January 1889), is a fictional character in the British television series, _Upstairs, Downstairs_. He was portrayed by Christopher Beeny.

He replaced Alfred as footman in 1906, but Alfred Harris in _Rose's Pigeon_ returns to the house Eaton Place . Alfred is on the run from the police having murdered his previous employer, with holding Edward hostage at knifepoint and taking Edward hostage in the coal cellar.[1][2] In _The Bolter_ Edward goes as James Bellamy's footman for a weekend visit to Somerby, the country house of James' school-friend Lord "Bunny" Newbury. During his visit to Somerby Edward sees Lord Gilmour and Lady Tewkesbury together. In _What the Footman Saw_ he claims that he saw Gilmour and the married Lady Tewkesbury sleeping together. That leads to the scandalous divorce case of Lord and Lady Tewkesbury.[3][4]

Edward stays until he leaves to go to war in 1915, having just married Daisy. Edward is a high-spirited, honest and happy fellow and the source of happy banter, but suffers from severe shell shock after returning from the front. After the war, and following a short period in which he and Daisy leave service, he becomes chauffeur and under butler to the Bellamys, and in 1930 becomes butler to Lord and Lady Stockbridge.
