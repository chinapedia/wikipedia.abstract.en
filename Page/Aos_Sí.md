Riders_of_the_Sidhe.jpg]]

The __ (; older form ) is the Irish term for a supernatural race in Irish mythology and Scottish mythology (where it is usually spelled Sìth, but pronounced the same), comparable to the fairies or elves. They are said to live underground in fairy mounds, across the western sea, or in an invisible world that coexists with the world of humans. This world is described in the _Lebor Gabála Érenn_ as a parallel universe in which the _aos sí_ walk amongst the living. In the Irish language, _aos sí_ means "people of the mounds" (the mounds are known in Irish as "the _sídhe_{{-"}}). In modern Irish the people of the mounds are also called _DAOINE SÍDHE_ ; in Scottish mythology they are _DAOINE SÌTH_.[1] They are variously said to be the ancestors, the spirits of nature, or goddesses and gods.[2]

Some secondary and tertiary sources, including well-known and influential authors such as W. B. Yeats, refer to _aos sí_ simply as "the _sídhe_{{-"}} (lit. "mounds").[3]


In Gaelic folklore

In many Gaelic tales, the _aos sí_ are later, literary versions of the Tuatha Dé Danann ("People of the Goddess Danu")—the deities and deified ancestors of Irish mythology. Some sources describe them as the survivors of the Tuatha Dé Danann who retreated into the Otherworld—the mortal Sons of Míl Espáine who, like many other early invaders of Ireland, came from Iberia. As part of the terms of their surrender to the Milesians, the Tuatha Dé Danann agreed to retreat and dwell underground. (In later interpretations, each tribe of the Tuatha Dé Danann was given its own mound.) Geoffrey Keating, an Irish historian of the late 17th century, equates Iberia with the Land of the Dead, providing a possible connection to the _aos sí._

In folk belief and practice, the _aos sí_ are often appeased with offerings, and care is taken to avoid angering or insulting them. Often they are not named directly, but rather spoken of as "The Good Neighbors", "The Fair Folk", or simply "The Folk". The most common names for them, _aos sí_, _aes sídhe_, _daoine sídhe_ (singular _duine sídhe_) and _daoine sìth_ mean, literally, "people of the mounds" (referring to the _sídhe_). The _aos sí_ are generally described as stunningly beautiful, though they can also be terrible and hideous.

_Aos sí_ are seen as fierce guardians of their abodes—whether a fairy hill, a fairy ring, a special tree (often a hawthorn) or a particular loch or wood. It is believed that infringing on these spaces will cause the _aos sí_ to retaliate in an effort to remove the people or objects that invaded their homes. Many of these tales contribute to the changeling myth in west European folklore, with the _aos sí_ kidnapping trespassers or replacing their children with changelings as a punishment for transgressing. The _aos sí_ are often connected to certain times of year and hours; as the Gaelic Otherworld is believed to come closer to the mortal world at the times of dusk and dawn, the _aos sí_ correspondingly become easier to encounter. Some festivals such as Samhain, Beltane and Midsummer are also associated with the _aos sí._


The _sídhe_

S_ídhe_ are the hills or tumuli that dot the Irish landscape. In modern Irish the word is _sí_; in Scottish Gaelic, _sìth_; in Old Irish _síde_ and the singular is _síd_.[4] In a number of later, English-language texts, the word _sídhe_ is incorrectly used both for the mounds and the people of the mounds. However _sidh_ in older texts refers specifically to "the palaces, courts, halls or residences" of the otherworldly beings that supposedly inhabit them.[5] The fact that many of these _sídhe_ have been found to be ancient burial mounds has contributed to the theory that the _aos sí_ were the pre-Celtic occupants of Ireland.

Others present these stories as mythology deriving from Greek cultural influence, deriving arguments mainly from Hesiod's _Works and Days_, which portrays the basic moral foundation and plantation techniques of the citizens of Greece and describes the races of men, created by the Greek deities. However, many of these views have been deemed unlikely, and the influence can be explained by the similar moral foundations stemming from the two cultures' Indo-European background.


Types

The banshee or _bean sídhe_ (from ), which means "woman of the _sídhe_",[6] has come to indicate any supernatural woman of Ireland who announces a coming death by wailing and keening. Her counterpart in Scottish mythology is the _bean sìth_ (sometimes spelled _bean-sìdh_). Other varieties of _aos sí_ and _daoine sìth_ include the Scottish _bean nighe_: the washerwoman who is seen washing the bloody clothing or armour of the person who is doomed to die; the _leanan sídhe_: the "fairy lover"; the _cat sìth_: a fairy cat; and the _Cù Sìth_: fairy dog.

The _sluagh sídhe_—"the fairy host"—is sometimes depicted in Irish and Scottish lore as a crowd of airborne spirits, perhaps the cursed, evil or restless dead. The _siabhra_ (anglicised as "sheevra"), may be a type of these lesser spirits, prone to evil and mischief.[7][8] However, an Ulster folk song also uses "sheevra" simply to mean "spirit" or "fairy".[9]

_Creideamh Sí_

Common_hawthorn.jpg tree, considered in local Irish lore, and Celtic folklore in general, to be sacred to the _Aos Sí_]] __ is Irish for the "Fairy Faith", a collection of beliefs and practices observed by those who wish to keep good relationships with the __ and avoid angering them.[10] The custom of offering milk and traditional foods—such as baked goods, apples or berries—to the __ have survived through the Christian era into the present day in parts of Ireland, Scotland and the diaspora.[11] Those who maintain some degree of belief in the __ also are aware to leave their sacred places alone and protect them from damage through road or housing construction.[12][13]
