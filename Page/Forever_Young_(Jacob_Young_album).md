_FOREVER YOUNG_ is an album by Norwegian guitarist and composer Jacob Young released on the ECM label in 2014.[1][2]


Reception

The _Allmusic_ review by Thom Jurek says "Young's playing throughout offers great technical facility, but he is a democratic bandleader, never showy. _Forever Young_ stands out in his catalog because it reveals an almost immeasurable growth in his compositional skills since 2007. These tunes inspire this fine band; they play as if they'd been playing them for ages".[3] In _JazzTimes_ John Murph wrote "The airy arrangements afford Young plenty of room to showcase his comely, full-bodied sound and his effortless manner of unraveling melodically cogent improvisations. His gifts as a composer are on full display as well, and he demonstrates an intriguing way of enveloping pop and rock motifs into soft-hued modern jazz".[4] On _All About Jazz_ John Kelman noted "_Forever Young_ demonstrates an ability to simmer in a way that his previous ECM recordings did not. It also represents a first outing by a quintet with plenty of potential; hopefully six years won't have to pass before this intimate yet delicately expressionistic quintet can once again reconvene".[5]
