VINTAGE TV was a Canadian English language exempt Category B specialty channel broadcasting music-related programming, including music videos, concerts, interviews, and more from an array of genres including rock, pop, country, soul, R&B, blues, folk, and more, primarily dating from the 1940s to 1990s. Its name and majority of programming are licensed from the U.K.-based television channel, Vintage TV.[1] The channel is owned by Vintage Entertainment Canada Limited, a consortium owned by Nathalia Browning Ribeiro, Koa Padolsky, Blue Wolverine Media and Arts Ltd., and Brain Dead Dog Productions Inc. all owning a 16.75% interest in the service, and Vintage Entertainment Limited, the parent company of the UK channel, owning a 33% interest.


History

The channel launched in standard definition on October 20, 2016, on Shaw Cable and Shaw Direct in Canada,[2] despite being previously listed on the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission's (CRTC) website for launched exempted television services.[3] The channel achieved wider coverage in June 2017, when it was added to Rogers Cable lineup.[4]

After passing the 200,000 subscribers mark, Vintage TV was granted a CRTC broadcast licence on January 23, 2018.[5]

In August 2018, The UK channel was shut down after being dropped by all UK service providers. This meant that the Canadian channel lost its only source to new programming.[6]

Without warning, on September 29th, 2018, the channel dropped all programming and became a de facto 24-hour infomercial for Sessions X, an on-demand video service, continually repeating the same programming and single commercial block which first aired on that day.[7] In October 2018, the UK channel went into administration.[8]

In November 2018 without warning, the channel stopped broadcasting. A Shaw-generated graphic has been shown in the channel's space on Shaw Cable & Direct. As of February 2019, Shaw's program guide has shown 'No Data'.[9]
