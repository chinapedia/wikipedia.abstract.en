_YESTERDAY, TODAY AND FOREVER_ is an album by saxophonist/flautist Bud Shank and flugelhornist/trumpeter Shorty Rogers recorded in 1983 and released on the Concord Jazz label.[1]


Reception

Scott Yanow of Allmusic said "Rogers is in pretty good form on the quintet date although occasionally overshadowed by altoist Bud Shank (who doubles on flute). The rhythm section is excellent, the repertoire is full of vehicles for swinging improvisations and the musicians sound fairly inspired. Recommended".[2]
