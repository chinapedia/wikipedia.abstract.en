CHRISTINA LILJENBERG HALSTRØM (born 1977 in Glostrup, Denmark) is a Danish architect and designer. The daughter of a Swedish mother and a Danish father, she has studied design in both Stockholm and in Copenhagen at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, graduating in 2007.[1] She specializes in furniture design.[2][3]

Now based in Copenhagen, Halstrøm's designs reflect the lightness of form typical of Scandinavian minimalism. Like most of her furniture, her four-legged George Stool, named after her eldest son, is tinted in hues of charcoal grey and natural wood. Made of ash with a grey woolen cushion, it is carefully crafted with a cushion extending slightly over the seat.[4]
