In commutative algebra, a STANLEY DECOMPOSITION is a way of writing a ring in terms of polynomial subrings. They were introduced by .


Definition

Suppose that a ring _R_ is a quotient of a polynomial ring _k_[_x_₁,...] over a field by some ideal. A Stanley decomposition of _R_ is a representation of _R_ as a direct sum (of vector spaces)

    R = ⨁_(α)x_(α)k(X_(α))

where each _x__(_α_) is a monomial and each _X__(_α_) is a finite subset of the generators.
