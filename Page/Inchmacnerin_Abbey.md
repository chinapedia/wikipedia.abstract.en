INCHMACNERIN ABBEY[1] is a former monastery and National Monument located in Lough Key, Ireland.[2][3]


Location

Inchmacnerin Abbey is located on Church Island, an island of 2.1 ha (5.1 ac) in the western part of Lough Key.[4]


History

A monastic site existed on the island from the 6th century AD, supposedly founded by Columba (Saint Colum Cille). The name derives from _Inis Mac nEirinn_, "island of a son of Ireland",

It was refounded as an Augustinian priory some time between 1140 and 1170.[5] Some of the Annals of Loch CÃ© may have been written here, as well as at Holy Trinity Abbey located on the same lake.[6][7]

It was dissolved c. 1569 and the land granted to William Taaffe in 1596.

The island was excavated in 2000, recovering parts of a stone church.[8]
