The _NEW OXFORD AMERICAN DICTIONARY'' (_NOAD'') is a single-volume dictionary of American English compiled by American editors at the Oxford University Press.

_NOAD_ is based upon the _New Oxford Dictionary of English_ (_NODE_), published in the United Kingdom in 1998, although with substantial editing, additional entries, and the inclusion of illustrations. It is based on a corpus linguistics analysis of Oxford's 200 million word database of contemporary American English.

_NOAD_ includes a diacritical respelling scheme to convey pronunciations, as opposed to the Gimson phonemic IPA system that is used in _NODE_.

Fictitious entry

The dictionary includes an entry for the word "esquivalience", which it defines as meaning "the willful avoidance of one's official responsibilities". This is a fictitious entry, intended to protect the copyright of the publication. The entry was invented by Christine Lindberg, one of the editors of the _NOAD_.[3]

With the publication of the second edition, a rumor circulated that the dictionary contained a fictitious entry in the letter 'e'. _New Yorker_ contributing editor Henry Alford combed the section, and discussed several unusual entries he found with a group of American lexicographers. Most found "esquivalience" to be the most likely candidate, and when Alford approached _NOAD_ editor in chief Erin McKean she confirmed it was a fake entry, which had been present since the first edition, in order to protect the copyright of the CD-ROM edition. Of the word, she said "its inherent fakeitude is fairly obvious".[4][5]

The fake entry apparently ensnared dictionary.com, which included an entry for it (that has since been removed) which it attributed to _Webster's New Millennium Dictionary_, both of which are owned by the private company Lexico.[6] Possibly due to its licensing of Oxford dictionaries, Google Dictionary included the word, listing three meanings and giving usage examples.
