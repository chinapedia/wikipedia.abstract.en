The BLUE RIBAND was a greyhound racing competition held annually at Wembley Stadium and Hall Green Stadium. It was inaugurated in 1981 as a replacement competition for the Wembley Spring Cup which finished in 1980.[1] [2]

Following the end of the Wembley Greyhounds the race transferred to Greyhound Racing Association (GRA) sister track Hall Green in 1999.[3] The race was discontinued by the GRA after the 2012 running despite being a category one race.
