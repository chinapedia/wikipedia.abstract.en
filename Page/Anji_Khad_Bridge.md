The ANJI KHAD BRIDGE is a cable-stayed bridge proposed to connect Katra and Reasi Section of Jammu–Baramulla line. Earlier, an arch bridge similar to the Chenab Bridge was proposed. Due to concerns regarding the geological stability of the region, the plan was abandoned.[1]


History

The Anji Khad bridge was initially proposed to be an arch bridge. It was designed as a long steel arches span bridge. Its main arch span was 265 m and the deck height is 189 m. The bridge lies southeast of the Chenab Bridge, near Reasi, along which the alignment of the new railway line crosses the deep gorges of Anji Khad. Quality aspects, construction standards, indigenous materials and the painting scheme were proposed to be similar to the Chenab Bridge. Later, a committee headed by a former railway board chairman has recommended that the location is not suitable for an arch bridge.

In October 2016 Indian Railways has decided to build a cable-stayed bridge at Anji Khad. The plan to build an arch bridge similar to the Chenab bridge was abandoned due to the vulnerability of the structure primarily due to concerns over geological stability of the region.[2] The proposed bridge will connect tunnel T2 on Katra side and tunnel T3 on Reasi side. The ₹ 458 crore project consists of 290 meters span at a height of 196 meters. [3]
