WASP_Elizabeth_Maxine_Chambers_WesternUnion.jpg instructing her to report for duty]] ELIZABETH "BETTY" MAXINE CHAMBERS (August 25, 1920 − May 11, 1961)[1] was one of the first female pilots in the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) program in which women took on non-combat flying duties so more male pilots were available for combat.[2][3] She was in WASP Class of 44-W-3 as part of the 318th Army Air Forces Flying Training Detachment.[4][5] She became a pilot shortly after her husband lost his life while flying, despite the fact that she had a new baby,[6] and was the only recent widow and mother to have served as a WASP.


Early life

Chambers was born in Los Angeles, California, to Samuel Cramsey and Gertrude Cramsey (née Hulse).[7] She grew up in Hollywood, California.[8][9][10]


Career

Prior to World War II Chambers worked for the Walt Disney Company and Universal Pictures, where she did post-production work that involved inking outlines for cartoon celluloid cells in preparation for painting during the picture process stage of film production.[11][12][13]

Chambers was married to Robert William Chambers, a United States Army pilot who had previously worked at Lockheed in the engineering department.[14] Later, during her service as a WASP, Chambers would be sent on a mission to tour a Lockheed plant.[15]

In 1942 during the war, Robert was killed in an aircraft crash.[16][17] After his death, Chambers and her baby moved in with her parents and she got a job as a telephone operator at Southern California Telephone Company.[18]

Chambers applied to be a WASP. She said: "Just the day before [my husband's] accident Bob had heard about the WASPs and he wanted me to fly ... in fact, he wanted to teach me, but it didn't work out that way. I love flying as he did, and I hope to be able to replace a man to do the job that Bob wanted to do."[19] She entered training on October 4, 1943, and graduated on April 15, 1944.[20]

Chambers trained at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Texas, and then was sent to Turner Field in Albany, Georgia. She then attended the Army Air Force Tactical School in Orlando, Florida.[21][22] Chambers was stationed at Greenwood Army Air Field in Greenwood, Mississippi.[23] At Greenwood, Chambers accrued over 420 hours of flight time up until December 20, 1944.[24]

As a pilot she flew North American AT-6 advanced trainers, PT-17 biplane primary trainers, Beechcraft AT-10 twin-engineer trainers, and the BT-25.[25]

Chambers' service ended when the WASP program was disbanded at the end of 1944.[26]

After the war, Chambers worked at American Airlines at LaGuardia Airport in New York City until 1946. She eventually lost touch with the WASP community, a close-knit group who often held reunions and get-togethers.[27]


Honors

On November 2, 1977, President Jimmy Carter passed Public Law 95-202, which gave those that served in the WASP program military veteran status. They were previously considered civilians.[28] In July 2009, President Barack Obama signed a bill that gave the WASPs the Congressional Gold Medal.[29][30]


Personal life

In 1941, Chambers married Robert William Chambers, a United States Army pilot.[31] Their son, Robert Michael "Mike" Chambers, who was born in 1942, was in the 1943 movie _Heaven Can Wait_, playing Don Ameche's character as a baby.[32][33][34]

In 1947, she married Robert Edward Black, a lumberman.[35] She died in 1961.[36]
