GÖRAN FREDRIK GÖRANSSON (20 January 1819 – 12 May 1900) was a Swedish merchant, ironmaster and industrialist. He was the founder of the company _Sandvikens Jernverks AB_ (now called Sandvik AB) and was the first person to implement the Bessemer process successfully on an industrial scale.[1]


Early life

Göran Fredrik Göransson was born on 20 January 1819 in Gävle, Sweden, to Maria Catharina Elfstrand and Anders Petter Göransson. He was the oldest son in the family of three girls and four boys. He went to school in Gävle and also spent 18 months in Germany, France, England and the United States in order to acquire experience in conducting international business.[2][3]


Career

In 1841, Göransson became a partner in the firm _Daniel Elfstrand & Co._, his family business, and its director in 1856.[4] In 1856, the company also acquired the iron-works in Högbo along with the Edske blast furnace. He traveled to England in 1857 to acquire a steam engine for the Edske furnace but after a change in business plans, bought one-fifth of Henry Bessemer's patent for the production of steel from pig-iron.[5] Upon his return, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences gave him a sum of 50,000 Swedish crowns for financing steel production using the Bessemer process. The Bessemer method involved blasting a strong current of air through molten iron to burn off the carbon and other impurities. However, it proved difficult to keep the temperature high enough throughout the process.[6] After initial difficulties, Göransson successfully managed to produce steel on an industrial scale using the new process on 18 July 1858.[7][8][9][10]

He founded the firm _Högbo Stål & Jernwerks AB_ on 31 January 1862 in Sandviken, Sweden.[11][12] However, Göransson and the company entered into receivership in 1866 due to bad capital resources.[13] In 1868, the company was acquired and reconstructed into _Sandvikens Jernverks AB_[14] with his eldest son, Anders Henrik Göransson as managing director and Per Murén as chairman. The firm was able to quickly expand in large foreign industrial markets such as Germany, Great Britain and the United States mainly due to Göransson's extensive connections abroad, cultivated during his time as general manager in Elfstrand & Co.[15] Göransson would succeed Murén as the company's chairman in 1883.[16]


Personal life and legacy

Göransson married Catharina Elisabeth Sehlberg on 31 May 1842. They had four sons and two daughters. His eldest son, Anders Henrik, would become managing director of Sandvikens Jernverks AB and would later succeed his father as chairman after his death.[17][18]

He is responsible for the founding of the town of Sandviken which grew around the steelworks that he had established on the bay of the Storsjön lake in 1862.[19]

In the 1860s, Göransson founded _Stiftelsen den Göranssonska Fonden_, a foundation to help his firm's employees and their families to make ends meet. Along with two other foundations established by his descendants, the Foundation funds students' grants and treatment for the elderly, disabled and the chronically ill in the Sandviken Municipality.[20] The Foundation also financed the construction of Göransson Arena, a multi-purpose indoor arena used for entertainment, sporting and cultural activities, which is named after him.[21]

He died on 12 May 1900 in Sandviken and is buried in the Sandviken cemetery.[22]
