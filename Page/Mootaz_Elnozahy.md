Early life and education

Born Elmootazbellah Nabil Elnozahy ( المعتزبالله نبيل النزهي ) on March 21, 1962 in Cairo, Egypt where he attended the Lycée Francais du Caire from 1966 to 1979. He obtained his B.S. in electrical engineering (1984), M.S. in computer engineering (1987) - both from Cairo University. He moved to Houston, Texas to attend Rice University where he earned his M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science (1990 and 1993).

In 1993, he received the Ralph Budd Award for the best Ph.D. thesis in Engineering from Rice University. For 3 years, he was holder of IBM graduate fellowship while a graduate student at Rice. Mootaz won a Research Division Award at Thomas J. Watson Research Center(1992) for his contributions to the Highly Available Network File Server (HANFS) Project.


Career

In 1993, he joined Carnegie Mellon as an assistant professor of Computer Science until he accepted a Staff Research Member position at IBM Research division in 1997. From 1994 to 1997, he was a Visiting Research Scientist at Bell Communications Research (Bellcore) as well as a consultant at Bell Laboratories Research (Lucent Technologies).

In 2005, he joined the Systems and Technology division at IBM as a Senior technical staff, then, later, assumed a Senior Management position at IBM research in 2007 until 2012. In 2006, IBM awarded him the Master Inventor for life title, in recognition of his 56 U.S. Patents. Dr. Elnozahy collected various other IBM awards including the Outstanding Invention Award, for innovative solutions in the Bureau of Census project in 2002, the President’s Award in 2003, and the Outstanding Technical Achievement Award in 2008.

In 1998, he accepted an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin and became an adjunct professor in the same department and University in 2012 before accepting his current position at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.
