_LOVEGRASS_ is the fifth studio album by Australian country music singer Sara Storer. It was released in August 2013[1] [2]and peaked at number 25 on the ARIA Charts.

The title track is a song written about her husband Dave. “This is my love song for Dave. How lucky is he to have a song written for him about a noxious weed, every now and then I threaten him with Roundup!” Storer said. The album was launched at the 2013 Gympie Music Muster.[3]

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2013, the album was nominated for ARIA Award for Best Country Album, losing to _Wreck & Ruin_ by Kasey Chambers and Shane Nicholson [4]

At the Country Music Awards of Australia of 2014, Storer won Female Vocalist of the Year and Album of the Year.


Critical reception

Scott Fitzsimons from The Music AU gave the album 3.5 out of 5 saying; "Storytelling is at the heart of any great country artist and Sara Storer is still a great storyteller. _Lovegrass_...comes after marriage and family life – experiences that are on this album's sleeve. She openly admits the title track is written for her husband and other cuts – "Come On Rain", "Heart & Sold", "You're My Everything" – can be attributed to that same family muse. Even when it's not about them, a romanticised Australian country life underpins everything here" adding "Storer doesn't need to prove anything on _Lovegrass_ after the career she's had, and the break has given her a chance to choose the time and manner of her return. This feels right, it feels natural and it feels comfortable." [5]

Katie Davern from Alt Media said "The stories are intimate and unique." adding "_Lovegrass_ toes the line between folk and Storer’s distinctively Australian brand of country; the former finds a home nestled in the title track whose feel-good melodies intertwine to tell Storer’s own tale of a lover’s rejoice.
