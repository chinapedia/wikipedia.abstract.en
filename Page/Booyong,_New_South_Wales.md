"Booyong" is a locality in northern New South Wales, partially in Byron Shire and partially in the City of Lismore.[1] It is named after the Booyong, or ironwood tree.[2]

For census purposes the locality is included in the village of Clunes.

It is the location of the Booyong Flora Reserve, now part of the Andrew Johnston Big Scrub Nature Reserve,[3] which is one of the few known locations of Isoglossa eranthemoides.[4]

The village is located on the North Coast railway line. The track work, bridges and platform for the former Booyong railway station remains. There are no buildings left in the station precinct.
