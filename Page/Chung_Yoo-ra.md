CHUNG YOO-RA (born CHUNG YOO-YEON, 30 October 1996) is a South Korean equestrian.[1] She competed in the 2014 Asian Games, where her team won a gold medal.[2]

She is a daughter of Chung Yoon-hoi and his ex-wife Choi Soon-sil,[3][4] who has been arrested amid the 2016 South Korean political scandal for using her friendship with the president Park Geun-hye to illegally interfere in the state affairs, and solicit business donations from top South Korean firms, including Samsung, for a non-profit fund she controlled.[5]


Legal issues

During the investigations of the 2016 South Korean political scandal, Chung Yoo-ra's admission to Ewha Womans University was cancelled due to "preferential treatment in admissions and grading".[6][7][8] Her high school diploma has been cancelled as well due to falsified high school records.[9]

In December 2016, South Korea put out an arrest warrant for Chung Yoo-ra for charges including obstruction of justice, after she refused to return from Germany to attend a parliamentary inquiry into her role in the scandal.[10] The South Korean government announced that it would invalidate her passport and seek her arrest and extradition from Germany.[11] The South Korean government also sought the help of Interpol to track her down.[12] On January 1, 2017, she was arrested in Aalborg, Denmark after a tip from South Korean journalists who had tracked her.[13][14]

The German Federal Police are investigating Chung Yoo-ra and her mother for money laundering involving assets estimated at more than 1 billion US dollars.[15][16] [17][18][19]
