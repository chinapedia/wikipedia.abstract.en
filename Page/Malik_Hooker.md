As a result, Hooker could not participate in the combine.[9]


Professional career

2017 NFL Draft

In February 2017, Hooker went through two surgeries to repair a hernia and a torn labrum. He attended the NFL Scouting Combine, but was unable to participate in any of the drills. 122 NFL scouts and representatives attended Ohio State's Pro Day and met with multiple head coaches, including Bill Belichick (Patriots), Todd Bowles (Jets), Jim Caldwell (Lions), John Harbaugh (Ravens), Hue Jackson (Browns), Marvin Lewis (Bengals), Mike Mularkey (Titans), Sean Payton (Saints), and Mike Tomlin (Steelers). Hooker was projected to be a top 15 pick by NFL draft experts and analysts.[10] He was ranked the top free safety in the draft by DraftScout.com and was ranked the second best safety in the draft, behind Jamal Adams, by _Sports Illustrated_, ESPN, Pro Football Focus, NFL analyst Mike Mayock, and NFL analyst Bucky Brooks.[11][12][13][14][15]

Indianapolis Colts

2017 SEASON The Indianapolis Colts selected Hooker in the first round (15th overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft.[16] He was the second safety selected, behind LSU's Jamal Adams.

On May 18, 2017, the Indianapolis Colts signed Hooker to a fully guaranteed four-year, $12.59 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $2.29 million.[17]

Hooker missed offseason workouts while recovering from surgery and suffered a groin injury during the first day of training camp. A shoulder injury further stunted his process and he was only able to appear in a single preseason game.[18] Head coach Chuck Pagano named Hooker the backup free safety to begin the regular season behind Darius Butler, who began the season alongside strong safety Matthias Farley.[19]

He made his professional regular season debut in the Indianapolis Colts' season-opener at the Los Angeles Rams and recorded four combined tackles in their 46–9 loss.[20] On September 17, 2017, Hooker earned his first career start in place of Darius Butler, who was inactive after sustaining a hamstring injury in the season-opener.[21] Hooker recorded two combined tackles, deflected a pass, and recorded his first career interception off a pass by quarterback Carson Palmer during their 16–13 overtime loss to the Arizona Cardinals in Week 2.[22] The following week, he made three combined tackles, broke up a pass, and intercepted a pass by Deshone Kizer in the Colts' 31–28 victory against the Cleveland Browns.[23] In Week 4, Hooker made three combined tackles, a pass deflection, and had another interception off Russell Wilson in their 46–18 loss at the Seattle Seahawks.[24] It marked his third consecutive game with an interception. On October 8, 2017, Hooker collected a season-high five combined tackles during a 26–23 victory against the San Francisco 49ers.[25] In Week 7, Hooker made two solo tackles before leaving the Colts' 27–0 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in the second quarter after suffering a torn ACL and MCL.[26] On October 24, 2017, the Indianapolis Colts placed Hooker on injured reserve after it was discovered he would require surgery and miss the remainder of the season.[27] He finished his rookie season with 22 combined tackles (16 solo), four pass deflections, and three interceptions in seven games and six starts.[28]
