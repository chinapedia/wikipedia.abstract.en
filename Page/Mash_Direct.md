MASH DIRECT is a farming and food production enterprise based in Comber, County Down, Northern Ireland.[1]

In 2016, Mash Direct employed 180 people at its farm. The company produces and supplies vegetable and potato products to supermarkets (including Asda[2][3] and Morrisons[4][5]) and independent retailers across the UK and Ireland and exports to the USA and the Middle East.[6]

Mash Direct was founded by Martin and Tracy Hamilton as a family business, in 2004 diversifying from their potato and vegetable farm to producing products more convenient to consumers.[7] Their products include prepared potato, croquettes, potato cakes and vegetable burgers.


Company history

The company opened its first factory in 2004, supplying mashed potato products to retailers Mace, N. Aiken, and Creighton's in Belfast, branching out to the Republic of Ireland in 2005, supplying Dunne's Stores.

Between 2006 and 2007, the company developed sauce-based recipes, including red cabbage and beetroot; broccoli and cheese sauce; creamy garlic potatoes. Coverage on BBC Radio 4 led to the first visit of Jamie Oliver[8].

The company expanded distribution into Scotland in 2006, the USA in 2009, Dubai in 2012. In 2013, all products were made gluten free[9].
