Production

The film was mainly funded by the director Eriprando Visconti. The first choice for the Maria's role was Giuliana De Sio, but the distributors rejected the idea because at the time they considered De Sio just as a television actress.[2] Edwige Fenech was also offered the role but refused.[3]


Reception

The film was both a critical and commercial failure.[4]
