Club career

Early years / Viitorul Constanța

Cicâldău was raised in Satu Nou, a village near Medgidia, Constanța County, and started playing football at the age of 8. He later joined the Gheorghe Hagi Academy, which serves as youth setup of Viitorul Constanța.[1]

Cicâldău made his debut in the first division for Viitorul on 31 March 2016, aged 18, in a 1–1 away draw with ASA Târgu Mureș.[2] He became a regular starter for the club in the 2017–18 season,[3] amassing 38 appearances and one goal all competitions comprised.

Universitatea Craiova

On 6 July 2018, Cicâldău agreed to a four-year contract with CS Universitatea Craiova, being assigned the number 10 shirt.[4] Press reported the fee at figures between €750,000 and €1 million plus interest on the capital gain of a potential future transfer.[5][6][7] He made his first appearance for "the White-Blues" eight days later in the Supercupa României, playing the full match as CFR Cluj came victorious 1–0.[8]

Cicâldău netted his first goal in a 3–0 away league win over Astra Giurgiu, on 26 October.[9] He found the net again after four days, this time in the Cupa României in an eventual 4–1 victory against Turris Turnu Măgurele.[10] On 31 March 2019, Cicâldău scored a header in a 2–3 away loss to FCSB.[11]

He recorded his first goal in European competitions on 18 July that year, scoring the opener in a 3–2 home success against Azerbaijani club Sabail in the second leg of the UEFA Europa League first qualifying round.[12]


International career

Cicâldău received his first call up for the Romania senior team in March 2018.[13] On the 24th that month, he made his debut as an 83rd-minute substitute in a friendly with Israel, which his team won 2–1.[14] His first official game for the country came on 17 November, in a 3–0 UEFA Nations League defeat of Lithuania.[15]

The following year he represented his country under-21 side at the 2019 UEFA European Championship, where they managed to progress past the group stage before being eliminated by defending champions Germany in the semi-finals.[16] He earned four caps during the final tournament, all as a starter.


Style of play

Cicâldău is capable of aiding his teammates in both defense and attack, being described as a box-to-box midfielder by former Romanian international Gheorghe Craioveanu.[17] A player with good technique, he has been noted for his work ethic.[18][19]
