SPAIN participated in the EUROVISION SONG CONTEST 2017 with the song "Do It for Your Lover" written by Manel Navarro and Antonio Rayo "Rayito". The song was performed by Manel Navarro. The Spanish broadcaster Televisión Española (TVE) organised the national final _Objetivo Eurovisión 2017_ in order to select the Spanish entry for the 2017 contest in Kiev, Ukraine. Six artists and songs competed in the televised show where a professional jury and a public televote selected "Do It for Your Lover" performed by Manel Navarro as the winner.

As a member of the "Big 5", Spain automatically qualified to compete in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest. Performing in position 16, Spain placed twenty-sixth (last) out of the 26 participating countries with 5 points.


Background

Prior to the 2017 contest, Spain had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest fifty-six times since its first entry in .[1] The nation has won the contest on two occasions: in 1968 with the song "La, la, la" performed by Massiel and in 1969 with the song "Vivo cantando" performed by Salomé, the latter having won in a four-way tie with France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Spain has also finished second four times, with Karina in 1971, Mocedades in 1973, Betty Missiego in 1979 and Anabel Conde in 1995. In 2016, Spain placed twenty-second with the song "Say Yay!" performed by Barei.

The Spanish national broadcaster, Televisión Española (TVE), broadcasts the event within Spain and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. TVE confirmed their intentions to participate at the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest on 14 September 2016.[2] The Spanish broadcaster had used both national finals and internal selection to choose the Spanish entry in the past. In 2016, TVE selected the entry that would compete at the Eurovision Song Contest via the multi-artist national final _Objetivo Eurovisión_. For their 2017 entry, the broadcaster revealed details regarding their selection procedure on 26 October 2016 and announced the organization of a further edition of _Objetivo Eurovisión_.[3]

The show was broadcast live on La 1 as well as online via TVE's official website rtve.es.[24][25][26] Six competing artists, including LeKlein who won the wildcard spot by a public vote, were revealed live during the _Eurocasting_ concert on 12 January 2017 broadcast via TVE's Botón Rojo service and TVE's official website. Among the competing artists was Mirela, who was runner-up in the 2007 national final and finished fourth in the 2009 national final.[27][28]

NOTES:
    a. As Manel Navarro and Mirela both finished with 58 points, the jury decided the winner between the two in a tie-break voting round. Xavi Martínez and Virginia Díaz voted for Manel Navarro, while Javier Cárdenas voted for Mirela.[33]

Incidents

During the tie-break voting round, when the jury panel selected Manel Navarro over the public vote's favourite Mirela, and before the reprise performance of the winning song, loud boos and accusations of rigging could be heard, which resulted in uneasy moments: Manel Navarro responded with a bras d'honneur as he was being booed while on stage.[34] He would apologise for the gesture two days later during a TVE press conference.[35]

Following the events at the national final, the selection of Xavi Martínez as a judge was challenged over potential conflict of interest since Martínez had promoted eventual winner Manel Navarro and his entry "Do It for Your Lover" on his radio program on Los 40.[36] On 13 February 2017, Member of Spanish Parliament for Toledo José Miguel Camacho, from the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, placed a motion to request TVE for clarification on the details of the selection process for Eurovision and on the possibility of nullifying the results of the national final.[37] On 15 February 2017, Member of Parliament for Valencia Ricardo Sixto, from Unidos Podemos, registered a similar motion.[38] On 22 February 2017, TVE's Head of Entertainment and responsible for _Objetivo Eurovisión 2017_ Toñi Prieto was summoned to appear before TVE's Audit Committee to clarify allegations of mishandling.[39]

TVE issued a statement on 26 February 2017, stating that the selection process had been conducted following the regulations set by the European Broadcasting Union and that all candidates had accepted the rules at every stage of the process. The statement also defended the criteria of the members of the jury panel in the final, stating that, as music radio hosts from the three main media groups in the country, it is "evident" that they "usually have contact with artists, singers and music producers for professional reasons".[40]

Preparation

The official video of the song, directed by Mauri D. Galiano, was filmed in February 2017 on the north coast of Tenerife, Canary Islands.[41] The video premiered on Manel Navarro's YouTube Vevo channel on 9 March 2017.[42] The music video served as the official preview video for the Spanish entry.

Promotion

Manel Navarro made appearances across Europe to specifically promote "Do It for Your Lover" as the Spanish Eurovision entry. On 18 February 2017, Manel Navarro performed "Do It for Your Lover" during the third semi-final of the Ukrainian Eurovision national final.[43] On 5 March, Manel Navarro performed during the Romanian Eurovision national final.[44] On 2 April, Manel Navarro performed during the _London Eurovision Party_, which was held at the Café de Paris venue in London, United Kingdom.[45] Manel Navarro also performed during the _Israel Calling_ event which was held in Tel Aviv, Israel on 5 April.[46] On 8 April, Manel Navarro performed during the _Eurovision in Concert_ event which was held at the Melkweg venue in Amsterdam, Netherlands.[47] On 26 and 27 April, Manel Navarro promoted the song in Lisbon, Portugal: on 26 April he performed the song on RTP1 talk show _Agora Nós_ and held a meet-and-greet session at the Instituto Cervantes centre, and on the following day he made a guest appearance on RTP1 late night talk show _5 Para A Meia-Noite_.[48][49]

In addition to his international appearances, he performed the song on talk show _¡Qué tiempo tan feliz!_ on Telecinco on 25 February.[50] On 15 April, he performed during the _Eurovision-Spain Pre-Party_ event which was held at the Sala La Riviera venue in Madrid.[51] On 25 April, a farewell reception was held for Manel Navarro before he travelled to Kiev for the contest, which took place at the Ukrainian Embassy in Madrid, hosted by Ambassador Anatoly Scherba.[52]


At Eurovision

The _Eurovision Song Contest 2017_ took place at the International Exhibition Centre in Kiev, Ukraine and consisted of two semi-finals on 9 and 11 May and the final on 13 May 2017.[53] According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the "Big 5" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final. As a member of the "Big 5", Spain automatically qualified to compete in the final. In addition to their participation in the final, Spain is also required to broadcast and vote in one of the two semi-finals.[54] At the semi-final allocation draw on 31 January 2017, Spain was drawn to vote in the first semi-final on 9 May; the country also performed in the first semi-final jury show on 8 May, and an extended clip of the performance was broadcast in the televised semi-final show the following evening.

In Spain, both semi-finals were broadcast on La 2, while the final was televised on La 1 with commentary by José María Íñigo and Julia Varela.[55] The Spanish spokesperson, who announced the top 12-point score awarded by the Spanish jury during the final, was Nieves Álvarez.[56] The Spanish song placed 26th (last) in the final with 5 points.

Staging and performance

The staging director for the Spanish performance was Hans Pannecoucke, who had worked with the Dutch entrants in 2014, 2015 and 2016 and the Belgian entrant in 2016 in a similar role.[57] Manel Navarro was joined in stage by backing singers Álex González and Alejandro de los Santos, bass player Edgar Regincos, drum player Marc Montserrat and guitarist Pol Niubó.[58]
