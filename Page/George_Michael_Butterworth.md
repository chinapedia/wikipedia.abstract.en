-   1970-1973, Basil Rebera of the Bible Society of India,
-   1971-1973, G. Babu Rao who was entrusted by the Bible Society of India with the OT Telugu language translation,[12]
-   1972-1974, S. J. Theodore of the Church of South India, Diocese of Karimnagar,
-   1972-1975, N. K. Achumi, also associated with the Bible Society of India in its Naga language translation,
-   1975-1977, R. Daniel Premkumar, associated with the Church of South India Synod,[13]

When Butterworth began teaching at the seminary in 1972 in Bangalore, his colleague was E. C. John and a year later in 1973, they were joined by Gerhard Wehmeier, a notable Old Testament scholar and the three of them led the Old Testament scholarship in Bangalore. While this was so, the Old Testament studies in Serampore College, Serampore were led by the notable Old Testament Scholar, John D. W. Watts[15] and G. Babu Rao who had by then moved to Serampore to begin his teaching.[16] Incidentally, it was Butterworth who guided the graduate thesis of John Sadananda, the present Master of the Senate of Serampore College (University).[17]
