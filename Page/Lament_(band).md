LAMENT is a Mexican death metal/power metal band.[1] that originated in Mexico City in 1993.


Background

Lament formed in 1993 under the name BEHEADED.[2] The original genre was along the lines of grindcore and brutal death metal.[3] In 1996, the band switched their name to Lament after the death of Drummer Arturo Guzman.[4] Soon after changing names, the band went to a music festival, where the band met Steve Rowe of Mortification.[5] In 1997, the band recorded their debut album _Tears of a Leper_. The artwork was apparently controversial, so the band had to use an alternative cover.[6] In 1998, the band was dropped by Rowe Productions and lost their original vocalist Marcos Pérez.[7] The band released their third album, _Breathless_ in 2001 through Kingdom. Eight years later, the band released _Renaissance_, through LAMENT RECORDS, label that the band formed as a way to independently release their material. Four years later, the band released _Left Behind_ in 2013.[8] In 2017, it was announced that Lament, alongside Dehumanize, had signed to Vision of God Records and were reissuing _Tears of a Leper_ and were working on new material.[9]

Lament Records has signed additional bands and they have distribution through Vision of God Records in the United States.[10]
