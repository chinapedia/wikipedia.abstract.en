_DOCTOR WHO_ is a British science fiction television programme produced by the BBC since 1963. The programme depicts the adventures of a Time Lord called "the Doctor", an extraterrestrial being, to all appearances human, from the planet Gallifrey. The Doctor explores the universe in a time-travelling space ship called the TARDIS. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Accompanied by a number of companions, the Doctor combats a variety of foes while working to save civilisations and help people in need.

The show is a significant part of British popular culture,[1][2] and elsewhere it has gained a cult following. It has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series.[3] The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989. There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot, in the form of a television film titled _Doctor Who_. The programme was relaunched in 2005, and since then has been produced in-house by BBC Wales in Cardiff. _Doctor Who_ has also spawned numerous spin-offs, including comic books, films, novels, audio dramas, and the television series _Torchwood_ (2006–2011), _The Sarah Jane Adventures_ (2007–2011), _K-9_ (2009–2010), and _Class_ (2016), and has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture.

Thirteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the concept of regeneration into a new incarnation, a plot device in which a Time Lord "transforms" into a new body when the current one is too badly harmed to heal normally. Each actor's portrayal is unique, but all represent stages in the life of the same character. Together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor is currently portrayed by Jodie Whittaker, who took on the role after Peter Capaldi's exit in the 2017 Christmas special "Twice Upon a Time".


Premise

_Doctor Who_ follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who goes by the name "the Doctor". The Doctor fled Gallifrey in a stolen TARDIS ("Time and Relative Dimension in Space"), a time machine that travels by materialising into and dematerialising out of the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a "chameleon circuit" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise; due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British police box.

Across time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile sonic screwdriver. The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more companions to share these adventures. These companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force UNIT when the Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to regenerate in case of mortal damage to the body, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during their travels, including the Daleks, the Cybermen, and the Master, another renegade Time Lord.


History

_Doctor Who_ first appeared on BBC TV at 17:16:20 GMT on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, due to the assassination of John F. Kennedy the previous day.[4][5] It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The head of drama Sydney Newman was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C. E. Webber. Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series.[6][7]

The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience[8] as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title _The Mutants_. As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any "bug-eyed monsters". According to producer Verity Lambert; "We didn't have a lot of choice — we only had the Dalek serial to go ... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that." Nation's script became the second _Doctor Who_ serial – _The Daleks_ (also known as _The Mutants_). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.[9]

The BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on BBC 1. Falling viewing numbers, a decline in the public perception of the show and a less-prominent transmission slot saw production suspended in 1989 by Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC 1.[10] Although it was effectively cancelled with the decision not to commission a planned 27th season, which would have been broadcast in 1990, the BBC repeatedly affirmed, over several years, that the series would return.[11]

While in-house production had ceased, the BBC hoped to find an independent production company to relaunch the show. Philip Segal, a British expatriate who worked for Columbia Pictures' television arm in the United States, had approached the BBC about such a venture as early as July 1989, while the 26th season was still in production.[12] Segal's negotiations eventually led to a _Doctor Who_ television film, broadcast on the Fox Network in 1996 as an international co-production between Fox, Universal Pictures, the BBC and BBC Worldwide. Although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1 million viewers), it was less so in the United States and did not lead to a series.[13]

Licensed media such as novels and audio plays provided new stories, but as a television programme _Doctor Who_ remained dormant until 2003. In September of that year,[14] BBC Television announced the in-house production of a new series after several years of attempts by BBC Worldwide to find backing for a feature film version. The executive producers of the new incarnation of the series were writer Russell T Davies and BBC Cymru Wales head of drama Julie Gardner.

_Doctor Who_ finally returned with the episode "Rose" on BBC One on 26 March 2005.[15] There have since been ten further series in 2006–2008, 2010–2015 and 2017–2018, and Christmas Day specials every year since 2005. No full series was broadcast in 2009,[16] although four additional specials starring David Tennant were made. Davies left the show in 2010 after the end of series 4 and the David Tennant specials were completed. Steven Moffat, a writer under Davies was announced as Davies' successor along with Matt Smith as the new doctor.[17] In January 2016, Moffat announced that he would step down after the 2017 finale, to be replaced by Chris Chibnall in 2018.[18] The tenth series debuted in April 2017, with a Christmas special preceding it in 2016.[19]

The 2005 version of _Doctor Who_ is a direct plot continuation of the original 1963–1989 series[20] and the 1996 telefilm. This is similar to the 1988 continuation of _Mission Impossible_,[21] but differs from most other series relaunches which have either been reboots (for example, _Battlestar Galactica_[22] and _Bionic Woman_) or set in the same universe as the original but in a different time period and with different characters (for example, _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ and spin-offs).

The programme has been sold to many other countries worldwide (see Viewership).

Public consciousness

It has been claimed that the transmission of the first episode was delayed by ten minutes due to extended news coverage of the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy the previous day; in fact it went out after a delay of eighty seconds.[23] The BBC believed that many viewers had missed this introduction to a new series due to the coverage of the assassination, as well as a series of power blackouts across the country, and they broadcast it again on 30 November 1963, just before episode two.[24]

The programme soon became a national institution in the United Kingdom, with a large following among the general viewing audience.[25][26] Many renowned actors asked for or were offered guest-starring roles in various stories.[27][28][29][30]

With popularity came controversy over the show's suitability for children. Morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse repeatedly complained to the BBC in the 1970s over what she saw as the show's frightening and gory content. John Nathan-Turner produced the series during the 1980s and was heard to say that he looked forward to Whitehouse's comments, as the show's ratings would increase soon after she had made them.[31]

The phrase "Hiding behind (or 'watching from behind') the sofa" entered British pop culture, signifying in humour the stereotypical early-series behaviour of children who wanted to avoid seeing frightening parts of a television programme while remaining in the room to watch the remainder of it.[32] The phrase retains this association with Doctor Who, to the point that in 1991 the Museum of the Moving Image in London named their exhibition celebrating the programme "Behind the Sofa". The electronic theme music too was perceived as eerie, novel, and frightening, at the time. A 2012 article placed this childhood juxtaposition of fear and thrill "at the center of many people's relationship with the show",[33] and a 2011 online vote at Digital Spy deemed the series the "scariest TV show of all time".[34]

During Jon Pertwee's second series as the Doctor, in the serial _Terror of the Autons_ (1971), images of murderous plastic dolls, daffodils killing unsuspecting victims, and blank-featured policemen marked the apex of the show's ability to frighten children.[35] Other notable moments in that decade include a disembodied brain falling to the floor in _The Brain of Morbius_[36] and the Doctor apparently being drowned by a villain in _The Deadly Assassin_ (both 1976).[37]

prop used from 2010–2017.]] A BBC audience research survey conducted in 1972 found that, by their own definition of violence ("any act[s] which may cause physical and/or psychological injury, hurt or death to persons, animals or property, whether intentional or accidental") _Doctor Who_ was the most violent of the drama programmes the corporation produced at the time.[38] The same report found that 3% of the surveyed audience regarded the show as "very unsuitable" for family viewing.[39] Responding to the findings of the survey in _The Times_ newspaper, journalist Philip Howard maintained that, "to compare the violence of _Dr Who_, sired by a horse-laugh out of a nightmare, with the more realistic violence of other television series, where actors who look like human beings bleed paint that looks like blood, is like comparing Monopoly with the property market in London: both are fantasies, but one is meant to be taken seriously."[40]

The image of the TARDIS has become firmly linked to the show in the public's consciousness; BBC scriptwriter Anthony Coburn, who lived in the resort of Herne Bay, Kent, was one of the people who conceived the idea of a police box as a time machine.[41] In 1996, the BBC applied for a trade mark to use the TARDIS' blue police box design in merchandising associated with _Doctor Who_.[42] In 1998, the Metropolitan Police Authority filed an objection to the trade mark claim; but in 2002, the Patent Office ruled in favour of the BBC.[43]

The programme's broad appeal attracts audiences of children and families as well as science fiction fans.[44]

The 21st century revival of the programme has become the centrepiece of BBC One's Saturday schedule, and has "defined the channel".[45] Since its return, _Doctor Who_ has consistently received high ratings, both in number of viewers and as measured by the Appreciation Index.[46] In 2007, Caitlin Moran, television reviewer for _The Times_, wrote that _Doctor Who_ is "quintessential to being British".[47] Director Steven Spielberg has commented that "the world would be a poorer place without _Doctor Who_".[48]

On 4 August 2013, a live programme titled _Doctor Who Live: The Next Doctor_[49] was broadcast on BBC One, during which the actor who was going to play the Twelfth Doctor was revealed.[50] The live show was watched by an average of 6.27 million in the UK, and was also simulcast in the United States, Canada and Australia.[51][52]


Episodes

_Doctor Who_ originally ran for 26 seasons on BBC One, from 23 November 1963 until 6 December 1989. During the original run, each weekly episode formed part of a story (or "serial") — usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years. Some notable exceptions were: _The Daleks' Master Plan_, which aired twelve episodes (plus an earlier one-episode teaser,[53] "Mission to the Unknown", featuring none of the regular cast[54]); almost an entire season of seven-episode serials (season 7); the ten-episode serial _The War Games_;[55] and _The Trial of a Time Lord_, which ran for fourteen episodes (albeit divided into three production codes and four narrative segments) during season 23.[56] Occasionally serials were loosely connected by a story-line, such as season 8 focusing on the Doctor battling a rogue Time Lord called the Master,[57][58] season 16's quest for the Key to Time,[59] season 18's journey through E-Space and the theme of entropy,[60] and season 20's Black Guardian trilogy.[61]

The programme was intended to be educational and for family viewing on the early Saturday evening schedule.[62] It initially alternated stories set in the past, which taught younger audience members about history, and with those in the future or outer space, focusing on science.[63] This was also reflected in the Doctor's original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher.[64]

However, science fiction stories came to dominate the programme, and the history-orientated episodes, which were not popular with the production team,[65] were dropped after _The Highlanders_ (1967). While the show continued to use historical settings, they were generally used as a backdrop for science fiction tales, with one exception: _Black Orchid_ (1982), set in 1920s England.[66]

The early stories were serialised in nature, with the narrative of one story flowing into the next, and each episode having its own title, although produced as distinct stories with their own production codes.[67] Following _The Gunfighters_ (1966), however, each serial was given its own title, and the individual parts were simply assigned episode numbers.[68]

Of the programme's many writers, Robert Holmes was the most prolific,[69] while Douglas Adams became the most well known outside _Doctor Who_ itself, due to the popularity of his _Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ works.[70][71]

The serial format changed for the 2005 revival, with a series usually consisting of thirteen 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes with adverts, on overseas commercial channels), and an extended 60-minute episode broadcast on Christmas Day. This system was shortened to twelve episodes and one Christmas special following the revival's eighth series, and ten episodes from the eleventh series. Each series includes both standalone and multiple episodic stories, linked with a loose story arc that is resolved in the series finale. As in the early "classic" era, each episode, whether standalone or part of a larger story, has its own title. Occasionally, regular-series episodes will exceed the 45-minute run time; notably, the episodes "Journey's End" from 2008 and "The Eleventh Hour" from 2010 exceeded an hour in length.

_Doctor Who_ instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging between 25-minute episodes (the most common format for the classic era), 45/50-minute episodes (for _Resurrection of the Daleks_ in the 1984 series, a single season in 1985, and the most common format for the revival era since 2005), two feature-length productions (1983's _The Five Doctors_ and the 1996 television film), twelve Christmas specials (most of 60 minutes' duration, one of 72 minutes), and four additional specials ranging from 60 to 75 minutes in 2009, 2010 and 2013. Four mini-episodes, running about eight minutes each, were also produced for the 1993, 2005 and 2007 Children in Need charity appeals, while another mini-episode was produced in 2008 for a _Doctor Who_-themed edition of The Proms. The 1993 2-part story, entitled _Dimensions in Time_, was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera _EastEnders_ and was filmed partly on the _EastEnders_ set. A two-part mini-episode was also produced for the 2011 edition of Comic Relief. Starting with the 2009 special "Planet of the Dead", the series was filmed in 1080i for HDTV,[72] and broadcast simultaneously on BBC One and BBC HD.

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the show, a special 3D episode, "The Day of the Doctor", was broadcast in 2013.[73] In March 2013, it was announced that Tennant and Piper would be returning,[74] and that the episode would have a limited cinematic release worldwide.[75]

In April 2015, Steven Moffat confirmed that _Doctor Who_ would run for at least another five years, extending the show until 2020.[76] In June 2017, it was announced that due to the terms of a deal between BBC Worldwide and SMG Pictures in China, the company has first right of refusal on the purchase for the Chinese market of future series of the programme until and including Series 15.[77][78]

Missing episodes

Between about 1967 and 1978, large amounts of older material stored in the BBC's various video tape and film libraries were either destroyed,[79] wiped, or suffered from poor storage which led to severe deterioration from broadcast quality. This included many old episodes of _Doctor Who_, mostly stories featuring the first two Doctors: William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton. In all, 97 of 253 episodes produced during the first six years of the programme are not held in the BBC's archives (most notably seasons 3, 4, 5, from which 79 episodes are missing). In 1972, almost all episodes then made were known to exist at the BBC,[80] while by 1978 the practice of wiping tapes and destroying "spare" film copies had been brought to a stop.[81]

No 1960s episodes exist on their original videotapes (all surviving prints being film transfers), though some were transferred to film for editing before transmission, and exist in their broadcast form.[82]

Some episodes have been returned to the BBC from the archives of other countries who bought prints for broadcast, or by private individuals who acquired them by various means. Early colour videotape recordings made off-air by fans have also been retrieved, as well as excerpts filmed from the television screen onto 8 mm cine film and clips that were shown on other programmes. Audio versions of all of the lost episodes exist from home viewers who made tape recordings of the show. Short clips from every story with the exception of _Marco Polo_ (1964), "Mission to the Unknown" (1965) and _The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve_ (1966) also exist.

In addition to these, there are off-screen photographs made by photographer John Cura, who was hired by various production personnel to document many of their programmes during the 1950s and 1960s, including _Doctor Who_. These have been used in fan reconstructions of the serials. These amateur reconstructions have been tolerated by the BBC, provided they are not sold for profit and are distributed as low-quality copies.[83]

One of the most sought-after lost episodes is part four of the last William Hartnell serial, _The Tenth Planet_ (1966), which ends with the First Doctor transforming into the Second. The only portion of this in existence, barring a few poor-quality silent 8 mm clips, is the few seconds of the regeneration scene, as it was shown on the children's magazine show _Blue Peter_.[84] With the approval of the BBC, efforts are now under way to restore as many of the episodes as possible from the extant material.

"Official" reconstructions have also been released by the BBC on VHS, on MP3 CD-ROM, and as special features on DVD. The BBC, in conjunction with animation studio Cosgrove Hall, reconstructed the missing episodes 1 and 4 of _The Invasion_ (1968), using remastered audio tracks and the comprehensive stage notes for the original filming, for the serial's DVD release in November 2006. The missing episodes of _The Reign of Terror_ were animated by animation company Theta-Sigma, in collaboration with Big Finish, and became available for purchase in May 2013 through Amazon.com.[85] Subsequent animations made in 2013 include _The Tenth Planet_, _The Ice Warriors_ (1967) and _The Moonbase_ (1967).

In April 2006, _Blue Peter_ launched a challenge to find missing _Doctor Who_ episodes with the promise of a full-scale Dalek model as a reward.[86]

In December 2011, it was announced that part 3 of _Galaxy 4_ (1965) and part 2 of _The Underwater Menace_ (1967) had been returned to the BBC by a fan who had purchased them in the mid-1980s without realising that the BBC did not hold copies of them.[87]

On 10 October 2013, the BBC announced that films of eleven episodes, including nine missing episodes, had been found in a Nigerian television relay station in Jos.[88] Six of the eleven films discovered were the six-part serial _The Enemy of the World_ (1968), from which all but the third episode had been missing.[89] The remaining films were from another six-part serial, _The Web of Fear_ (1968), and included the previously missing episodes 2, 4, 5, and 6. Episode 3 of _The Web of Fear_ is still missing.[90]


Characters

The Doctor

, Patrick Troughton, Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, Paul McGann, Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant, Matt Smith, Peter Capaldi and Jodie Whittaker.]] The Doctor was initially shrouded in mystery. In the programme's early days, the character was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice while exploring time and space in an unreliable time machine, the "TARDIS" (an acronym for Time and Relative Dimension in Space), which notably appears much larger on the inside than on the outside (a quality referred to as "dimensional transcendentality").[91][92]

The initially irascible and slightly sinister Doctor quickly mellowed into a more compassionate figure and was eventually revealed to be a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, which the Doctor fled by stealing the TARDIS.

Changes of appearance

Producers introduced the concept of regeneration to permit the recasting of the main character. This was prompted by the poor health of the original star, William Hartnell. The term "regeneration" was not conceived until the Doctor's third on-screen regeneration; Hartnell's Doctor merely described undergoing a "renewal", and the Second Doctor underwent a "change of appearance".[93][94] The device has allowed for the recasting of the actor various times in the show's history, as well as the depiction of alternative Doctors either from the Doctor's relative past or future.[95]

The serials _The Deadly Assassin_ (1976) and _Mawdryn Undead_ (1983) established that a Time Lord can only regenerate 12 times, for a total of 13 incarnations. This line became stuck in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated, and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the Doctor a thirteenth time.[96][97] The episode "The Time of the Doctor" (2013) depicted the Doctor acquiring a new cycle of regenerations, starting from the Twelfth Doctor, due to the Eleventh Doctor being the product of the Doctor's twelfth regeneration from his original set. [98][99]

Although the idea of casting a woman as the Doctor had been suggested by the show's writers several times, including by Newman in 1986 and Davies in 2008, until 2017, all official depictions were played by men.[100][101] Jodie Whittaker took over the role as the Thirteenth Doctor at the end of the 2017 Christmas special, and is the first woman to be cast as the character. Whittaker had previously starred in television series such as _Return to Cranford_, _Broadchurch_ alongside David Tennant (Tenth Doctor) and the dystopian anthology _Black Mirror_.[102] The show introduced the Time Lords' ability to change gender on regeneration in earlier episodes, first in dialogue, then with Michelle Gomez's version of The Master.

In addition to those actors who have headlined the series, others have portrayed versions of the Doctor in guest roles. Notably, in 2013, John Hurt guest-starred as a hitherto unknown incarnation of the Doctor known as the War Doctor in the run-up to the show's 50th anniversary special "The Day of the Doctor".[104] He is shown in mini-episode "The Night of the Doctor" retroactively inserted into the show's fictional chronology between McGann and Eccleston's Doctors, although his introduction was written so as not to disturb the established numerical naming of the Doctors.[105] Another example is from the 1986 serial _The Trial of a Time Lord_, where Michael Jayston portrayed the Valeyard, who is described as an amalgamation of the darker sides of the Doctor's nature, somewhere between the twelfth and final incarnation.

On rare occasions, other actors have stood in for the lead. In _The Five Doctors_, Richard Hurndall played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later David Bradley similarly replaced Hartnell in _Twice Upon a Time_. In _Time and the Rani_, Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. For more information, see the list of actors who have played the Doctor. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including Peter Cushing in two films.

The casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's gender (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors to date have been white) and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).[106][107][108]

Meetings of different incarnations

There have been instances of actors returning at later dates to reprise the role of their specific Doctor. In 1973's _The Three Doctors_, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's _The Five Doctors_, Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted _Shada_ episode. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's _The Two Doctors_ with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short "Time Crash" alongside David Tennant, and in 2013's 50th anniversary special episode, "The Day of the Doctor", David Tennant's Tenth Doctor appeared alongside Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and John Hurt as the War Doctor, as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.[109] In 2017, the First Doctor (this time portrayed by David Bradley) returned alongside Peter Capaldi in "The Doctor Falls" and "Twice Upon a Time" (both 2017). In "The Name of the Doctor" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor meets a previously unseen incarnation of himself, subsequently revealed to be the War Doctor.[110] Additionally, multiple incarnations of the Doctor have met in various audio dramas and novels based on the television show.

Revelations about the Doctor

Throughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In _The Brain of Morbius_ (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor might not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted might have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In _Mawdryn Undead_ (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special _The Five Doctors_, the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms "Fourth", the First Doctor excitedly replies "Goodness me. So there are five of me now." In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself "the Eleventh" in "The Lodger". In the 2013 episode "The Time of the Doctor," the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied "Fall of the Eleventh" which had been trailed throughout the series.

During the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord. In the 1996 television film, the Eighth Doctor describes himself as being "half human".[111] The BBC's FAQ for the programme notes that "purists tend to disregard this",[112] instead focusing on his Gallifreyan heritage.

The programme's first serial, _An Unearthly Child_, shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, Susan Foreman. In the 1967 serial, _Tomb of the Cybermen_, when Victoria Waterfield doubts the Doctor can remember his family because of, "being so ancient", the Doctor says that he can when he really wants to—"The rest of the time they sleep in my mind". The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in "The Empty Child" (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, "Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither." The Doctor remarks in response, "Yeah, I know the feeling." In "Smith and Jones" (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, "No, not any more." In both "Fear Her" (2006) and "The Doctor's Daughter" (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.

In "The Wedding of River Song" (2011), it is implied that the Doctor's true name is a secret that must never be revealed; this is explored further in "The Name of the Doctor" (2013), when River Song speaking his name allows the Great Intelligence to enter his tomb, and in "The Time of the Doctor" (2013) where speaking his true name becomes the signal by which the Time Lords would know they can safely return to the universe.

Companions

The companion figure – generally a human – has been a constant feature in _Doctor Who_ since the programme's inception in 1963. One of the roles of the companion is to be a reminder for the Doctor's "moral duty".[113] The Doctor's first companions seen on screen were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell). These characters were intended to act as audience surrogates, through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure.[114] The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is _The Deadly Assassin_ (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), a Time Lady; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); and Jo Grant (Katy Manning). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes — or loves — on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.

Since the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role. Steven Moffat described the companion as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor.[115][116] The primary companions of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors were Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), and Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) with Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) recurring as secondary companion figures.[117] The Eleventh Doctor became the first to travel with a married couple, Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill), whilst out-of-sync meetings with River Song (Alex Kingston) and Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) provided ongoing story arcs. The tenth series introduced Pearl Mackie as Bill Potts, the Doctor's newest traveling companion.[118] Bill Potts is the Doctor's first openly gay companion. Pearl Mackie said that the increased representation for LGBTQ people is important on a mainstream show.[119]

Some companions have gone on to re-appear, either in the main series or in spin-offs. Sarah Jane Smith became the central character in _The Sarah Jane Adventures_ (2007–11) following a return to _Doctor Who_ in 2006. Guest stars in the series included former companions Jo Grant, K9, and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney). The character of Jack Harkness also served to launch a spin-off, _Torchwood_, (2006–2011) in which Martha Jones also appeared.

Adversaries

When Sydney Newman commissioned the series, he specifically did not want to perpetuate the cliché of the "bug-eyed monster" of science fiction.[120] However, monsters were popular with audiences and so became a staple of _Doctor Who_ almost from the beginning.

With the show's 2005 revival, executive producer Russell T Davies stated his intention to reintroduce classic icons of _Doctor Who_.[121] The Autons with the Nestene Consciousness and Daleks returned in series 1, Cybermen in series 2, the Macra and the Master in series 3, the Sontarans and Davros in series 4, and the Time Lords including Rassilon in the 2009–10 Specials. Davies' successor, Steven Moffat, has continued the trend by reviving the Silurians in series 5, Cybermats in series 6, the Great Intelligence and the Ice Warriors in Series 7, and Zygons in the 50th Anniversary Special.[122] Since its 2005 return, the series has also introduced new recurring aliens: Slitheen (Raxacoricofallapatorians), Ood, Judoon, Weeping Angels and the Silence.

Besides infrequent appearances by enemies such as the Ice Warriors, Ogrons, the Rani, and Black Guardian, three adversaries have become particularly iconic: the Daleks, the Cybermen, and the Master.

Daleks

The Dalek race, which first appeared in the show's second serial in 1963,[123] are _Doctor Who_{{'}}s oldest villains. The Daleks are Kaleds from the planet Skaro, mutated by the scientist Davros and housed in mechanical armour shells for mobility. The actual creatures resemble octopuses with large, pronounced brains. Their armour shells have a single eye-stalk, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a directed-energy weapon. Their main weakness is their eyestalk; attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to "exterminate" all non-Dalek beings. They even attack the Time Lords in the Time War, as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show. They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the Doctor Who franchise, their most recent appearance being the 2019 episodes "Resolution". Davros has also been a recurring figure since his debut in _Genesis of the Daleks_, although played by several different actors.

The Daleks were created by writer Terry Nation (who intended them to be an allegory of the Nazis)[124] and BBC designer Raymond Cusick.[125] The Daleks' début in the programme's second serial, _The Daleks_ (1963–64), made both the Daleks and _Doctor Who_ very popular. A Dalek appeared on a postage stamp celebrating British popular culture in 1999, photographed by Lord Snowdon. In "Victory of the Daleks" a new set of Daleks were introduced that come in a range of colours; the colour denoting its role within the species.[126]

Cybermen

Cybermen were originally a wholly organic species of humanoids originating on Earth's twin planet Mondas that began to implant more and more artificial parts into their bodies. This led to the race becoming coldly logical and calculating cyborgs, with emotions usually only shown when naked aggression was called for. With the demise of Mondas, they acquired Telos as their new home planet. They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the _Doctor Who_ franchise.

The 2006 series introduced a totally new variation of Cybermen. These Cybus Cybermen were created in a parallel universe by the mad inventor John Lumic; he was attempting to preserve the humans by transplanting their brains into powerful metal bodies, sending them orders using a mobile phone network and inhibiting their emotions with an electronic chip.

The Master

The Master is the Doctor's archenemy, a renegade Time Lord who desires to rule the universe. Conceived as "Professor Moriarty to the Doctor's Sherlock Holmes",[127] the character first appeared in 1971. As with the Doctor, the role has been portrayed by several actors, since the Master is a Time Lord as well and able to regenerate; the first of these actors was Roger Delgado, who continued in the role until his death in 1973. The Master was briefly played by Peter Pratt and Geoffrey Beevers until Anthony Ainley took over and continued to play the character until Doctor Who's hiatus in 1989. The Master returned in the 1996 television movie of _Doctor Who_, and was played by American actor Eric Roberts.

Following the series revival in 2005, Derek Jacobi provided the character's re-introduction in the 2007 episode "Utopia". During that story, the role was then assumed by John Simm who returned to the role multiple times through the Tenth Doctor's tenure.[128] As of the 2014 episode "Dark Water", it was revealed that the Master had become a female incarnation or "Time Lady", going by the name of "Missy" (short for Mistress, the feminine equivalent of "Master"). This incarnation is played by Michelle Gomez.

John Simm returned in his role as the Master in the tenth series.[129]


Music

Theme music

The _Doctor Who_ theme music was one of the first electronic music signature tunes for television, and after more than a half century remains one of the most easily recognised. The original theme was composed by Ron Grainer and realised by Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, with assistance from Dick Mills and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964. The various parts were built up using musique concrète techniques, by creating tape loops of an individually struck piano string and individual test oscillators and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of season 17 (1979–80). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators, intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow mixing of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, "Jeez, Delia, did I write that?"[130] Although Grainer was willing to give Derbyshire the co-composer credit, it was against BBC policy at the time.[131][132]

A different arrangement was recorded by Peter Howell for season 18 (1980), which was in turn replaced by Dominic Glynn's arrangement for the season-long serial _The Trial of a Time Lord_ in season 23 (1986). Keff McCulloch provided the new arrangement for the Seventh Doctor's era which lasted from season 24 (1987) until the series' suspension in 1989. American composer John Debney created a new arrangement of Ron Grainer's original theme for _Doctor Who_ in 1996. For the return of the series in 2005, Murray Gold provided a new arrangement which featured samples from the 1963 original with further elements added; in the 2005 Christmas episode "The Christmas Invasion".

A new arrangement of the theme, once again by Gold, was introduced in the 2007 Christmas special episode, "Voyage of the Damned"; Gold returned as composer for the 2010 series.[133] He was responsible for a new version of the theme which was reported to have had a hostile reception from some viewers.[134] In 2011, the theme tune charted at number 228 of radio station Classic FM's Hall of Fame, a survey of classical music tastes. A revised version of Gold's 2010 arrangement had its debut over the opening titles of the 2012 Christmas special "The Snowmen", and a further revision of the arrangement was made for the 50th Anniversary special "The Day of the Doctor" in November 2013.[135]

Versions of the "Doctor Who Theme" have also been released as pop music over the years. In the early 1970s, Jon Pertwee, who had played the Third Doctor, recorded a version of the Doctor Who theme with spoken lyrics, titled, "Who Is the Doctor".[136] In 1978 a disco version of the theme was released in the UK, Denmark and Australia by the group Mankind, which reached number 24 in the UK charts. In 1988 the band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (later known as The KLF) released the single "Doctorin' the Tardis" under the name The Timelords, which reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in Australia; this version incorporated several other songs, including "Rock and Roll Part 2" by Gary Glitter (who recorded vocals for some of the CD-single remix versions of "Doctorin' the Tardis").[137] Others who have covered or reinterpreted the theme include Orbital,[138] Pink Floyd,[139] the Australian string ensemble Fourplay, New Zealand punk band Blam Blam Blam, The Pogues, Thin Lizzy, Dub Syndicate, and the comedians Bill Bailey and Mitch Benn. Both the theme and obsessive fans were satirised on _The Chaser's War on Everything_. The theme tune has also appeared on many compilation CDs, and has made its way into mobile-phone ringtones. Fans have also produced and distributed their own remixes of the theme. In January 2011 the Mankind version was released as a digital download on the album _Gallifrey And Beyond_.

On 26 June 2018, producer Chris Chibnall announced that the musical score for series 11 would be provided by Royal Birmingham Conservatoire alumnus Segun Akinola.[140]

Incidental music

Most of the innovative incidental music for _Doctor Who_ has been specially commissioned from freelance composers, although in the early years some episodes also used stock music, as well as occasional excerpts from original recordings or cover versions of songs by popular music acts such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys. Since its 2005 return, the series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the 1970s to the 2000s.

The incidental music for the first _Doctor Who_ adventure, _An Unearthly Child_, was written by Norman Kay. Many of the stories of the William Hartnell period were scored by electronic music pioneer Tristram Cary, whose _Doctor Who_ credits include _The Daleks_, _Marco Polo_, _The Daleks' Master Plan_, _The Gunfighters_ and _The Mutants_. Other composers in this early period included Richard Rodney Bennett, Carey Blyton and Geoffrey Burgon.

The most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was Dudley Simpson, who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for _Blake's 7_, and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of _The Tomorrow People_. Simpson's first _Doctor Who_ score was _Planet of Giants_ (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with _The Horns of Nimon_ (1979). He also made a cameo appearance in _The Talons of Weng-Chiang_ (as a Music hall conductor).

In 1980 starting with the serial _The Leisure Hive_ the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop. Paddy Kingsland and Peter Howell contributed many scores in this period and other contributors included Roger Limb, Malcolm Clarke and Jonathan Gibbs.

The Radiophonic Workshop was dropped after 1986's _The Trial of a Time Lord_ series, and Keff McCulloch took over as the series' main composer until the end of its run, with Dominic Glynn and Mark Ayres also contributing scores.

From the 2005 revival to the 2017 Christmas episode "Twice Upon a Time",[141] all incidental music for the series was composed by Murray Gold and Ben Foster, and has been performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales from the 2005 Christmas episode "The Christmas Invasion" onwards. A concert featuring the orchestra performing music from the first two series took place on 19 November 2006 to raise money for Children in Need. David Tennant hosted the event, introducing the different sections of the concert. Murray Gold and Russell T Davies answered questions during the interval and Daleks and Cybermen appeared whilst music from their stories was played. The concert aired on BBCi on Christmas Day 2006. A Doctor Who Prom was celebrated on 27 July 2008 in the Royal Albert Hall as part of the annual BBC Proms. The BBC Philharmonic and the London Philharmonic Choir performed Murray Gold's compositions for the series, conducted by Ben Foster, as well as a selection of classics based on the theme of space and time. The event was presented by Freema Agyeman and guest-presented by various other stars of the show with numerous monsters participating in the proceedings. It also featured the specially filmed mini-episode "Music of the Spheres", written by Russell T Davies and starring David Tennant.[142]

On 26 June 2018, producer Chris Chibnall announced that the musical score for the eleventh series would be provided by Royal Birmingham Conservatoire alumnus Segun Akinola.[143]

Six soundtrack releases have been released since 2005. The first featured tracks from the first two series,[144] the second and third featured music from the third and fourth series respectively. The fourth was released on 4 October 2010 as a two disc special edition and contained music from the 2008–2010 specials (_The Next Doctor_ to _End of Time Part 2_).[145][146] The soundtrack for Series 5 was released on 8 November 2010.[147] In February 2011, a soundtrack was released for the 2010 Christmas special: "A Christmas Carol",[148] and in December 2011 the soundtrack for Series 6 was released, both by Silva Screen Records.[149]

In 2013, a 50th-anniversary boxed set of audio CDs was released featuring music and sound effects from Doctor Who's 50-year history. The celebration continued in 2016 with the release of Doctor Who: The 50th Anniversary Collection Four LP Box Set by New York City-based Spacelab9. The company pressed 1,000 copies of the set on "Metallic Silver" vinyl, dubbed the "Cyberman Edition".[150]


Viewership

United Kingdom

is iconic in British popular culture.]] Premiering the day after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the first episode of _Doctor Who_ was repeated with the second episode the following week. _Doctor Who_ has always appeared initially on the BBC's mainstream BBC One channel, where it is regarded as a family show, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers; episodes were also repeated on BBC Three, before its transition to an online-only channel . The programme's popularity has waxed and waned over the decades, with three notable periods of high ratings.[151] The first of these was the "Dalekmania" period (circa 1964–1965), when the popularity of the Daleks regularly brought _Doctor Who_ ratings of between 9 and 14 million, even for stories which did not feature them.[152][153] The second was the mid to late 1970s, when Tom Baker occasionally drew audiences of over 12 million.[154]

An audience survey during the 1970s revealed that at the time 60% of the viewership were adults.

During the ITV network strike of 1979, viewership peaked at 16 million. Figures remained respectable into the 1980s, but fell noticeably after the programme's 23rd series was postponed in 1985 and the show was off the air for 18 months. At the time of Season 19's broadcast in 1982 the show was being watched by a global audience of 98 million, 88 million in 38 foreign countries, and an average of ten million in the United Kingdom.

Its late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers was seen as poor at the time and was, according to the BBC Board of Control, a leading cause of the programme's 1989 suspension. Some fans considered this disingenuous, since the programme was scheduled against the soap opera _Coronation Street_, the most popular show at the time.[155][156] During Tennant's run (the third notable period of high ratings), the show had consistently high viewership; with the Christmas specials regularly attracting over 10 million.[157]

The BBC One broadcast of "Rose", the first episode of the 2005 revival, drew an average audience of 10.81 million, third highest for BBC One that week and seventh across all channels.[158][159][160] The current revival also garners the highest audience Appreciation Index of any drama on television.[161]

International

_Doctor Who_ has been broadcast internationally outside of the United Kingdom since 1964, a year after the show first aired. , the modern series has been or is currently broadcast weekly in more than 50 countries.

_Doctor Who_ is one of the five top-grossing titles for BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm.[162] BBC Worldwide CEO John Smith has said that _Doctor Who_ is one of a small number of "Superbrands" which Worldwide will promote heavily.[163]

Only four episodes have ever had their premiere showings on channels other than BBC One. The 1983 20th anniversary special _The Five Doctors_ had its début on 23 November (the actual date of the anniversary) on a number of PBS stations two days prior to its BBC One broadcast. The 1988 story _Silver Nemesis_ was broadcast with all three episodes airing back to back on TVNZ in New Zealand in November, after the first episode had been shown in the UK but before the final two instalments had aired there. Finally, the 1996 television film premiered on 12 May 1996 on CITV in Edmonton, Canada, 15 days before the BBC One showing, and two days before it aired on Fox in the United States.

Oceania

New Zealand was the first country outside the United Kingdom to screen _Doctor Who_, beginning in September 1964, and continued to screen the series for many years, including the new series from 2005. In 2018, the series is aired on Fridays on TVNZ 2, and on TVNZ On Demand on the same episode as the UK.[164]

In Australia, the show has had a strong fan base since its inception, having been exclusively first run by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) since January 1965. (See Doctor Who in Australia) The ABC has periodically repeated episodes; of note were the weekly screenings of all available classic episodes starting in 2003, for the show's 40th anniversary, and the weekdaily screenings of all available revived episodes in 2013 for the show's 50th anniversary. The ABC broadcasts the modern series first run on ABC1 and ABC ME, with repeats on ABC2. The ABC also provided partial funding for the 20th anniversary special _The Five Doctors_ in 1983.

Americas

The series also has a fan base in the United States, where it was shown in syndication from the 1970s to the 1990s, particularly on PBS stations.[165]

TVOntario picked up the show in 1976 beginning with _The Three Doctors_ and aired each series (several years late) through to series 24 in 1991. From 1979 to 1981, TVO airings were bookended by science-fiction writer Judith Merril who would introduce the episode and then, after the episode concluded, try to place it in an educational context in keeping with TVO's status as an educational channel. Its airing of _The Talons of Weng-Chiang_ was cancelled as a result of accusations that the story was racist; the story was later broadcast in the 1990s on cable station YTV. CBC began showing the series again in 2005. The series moved to the Canadian cable channel Space in 2009.

For the Canadian broadcast, Christopher Eccleston recorded special video introductions for each episode (including a trivia question as part of a viewer contest) and excerpts from the _Doctor Who Confidential_ documentary were played over the closing credits; for the broadcast of "The Christmas Invasion" on 26 December 2005, Billie Piper recorded a special video introduction. CBC began airing series two on 9 October 2006 at 20:00 E/P (20:30 in Newfoundland and Labrador), shortly after that day's CFL double header on Thanksgiving in most of the country.

Series three began broadcasting on CBC on 18 June 2007 followed by the second Christmas special, "The Runaway Bride" at midnight,[166] and the Sci Fi Channel began on 6 July 2007 starting with the second Christmas special at 8:00 pm E/P followed by the first episode.[167]

Series four aired in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel (now known as Syfy), beginning in April 2008.[168] It aired on CBC beginning 19 September 2008, although the CBC did not air the _Voyage of the Damned_ special.[169] The Canadian cable network Space broadcast "The Next Doctor" (in March 2009) and all subsequent series and specials.[170]

Home media

A wide selection of serials are available from BBC Video on DVD, on sale in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and the United States. Every fully extant serial has been released on VHS, and BBC Worldwide continues to regularly release serials on DVD. The 2005 series is also available in its entirety on UMD for the PlayStation Portable. Eight original series serials have been released on Laserdisc[171] and many have also been released on Betamax tape and Video 2000. One episode of Doctor Who (The Infinite Quest) was released on VCD. Only the series from 2005 onwards are also available on Blu-ray, except for the 1970 story _Spearhead from Space_, released in July 2013 and the 1996 TV film _Doctor Who_ released in September 2016.[172] Many early releases have been re-released as special editions, with more bonus features.


Adaptations and other appearances

Dr. Who films

There are two Dr. Who feature films: _Dr. Who and the Daleks_, released in 1965 and _Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D._ in 1966. Both are retellings of existing television stories (specifically, the first two Dalek serials, _The Daleks_ and _The Dalek Invasion of Earth_ respectively) with a larger budget and alterations to the series concept.

In these films, Peter Cushing plays a human scientist[173] named "Dr. Who", who travels with his granddaughter and niece and other companions in a time machine he has invented. The Cushing version of the character reappears in both comic strips and a short story, the latter attempting to reconcile the film continuity with that of the series.

In addition, several planned films were proposed, including a sequel, _The Chase_, loosely based on the original series story, for the Cushing Doctor, plus many attempted television movie and big screen productions to revive the original _Doctor Who_, after the original series was cancelled.

Paul McGann starred in the only television film as the eighth incarnation of the Doctor. After the film, he continued the role in audio books and was confirmed as the eighth incarnation through flashback footage and a mini episode in the 2005 revival, effectively linking the two series and the television movie.

In 2011, David Yates announced that he had started work with the BBC on a _Doctor Who_ film, a project that would take three or more years to complete. Yates indicated that the film would take a different approach to _Doctor Who_,[174] although then _Doctor Who_ showrunner Steven Moffat stated later that any such film would not be a reboot of the series and a film should be made by the BBC team and star the current TV Doctor.[175][176]

Spin-offs

_Doctor Who_ has appeared on stage numerous times. In the early 1970s, Trevor Martin played the role in _Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday_. In the late 1980s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a play titled _Doctor Who – The Ultimate Adventure_. For two performances, while Pertwee was ill, David Banks (better known for playing Cybermen) played the Doctor. Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while Terry Nation wrote _The Curse of the Daleks_, a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor.

A pilot episode ("A Girl's Best Friend") for a potential spinoff series, _K-9 and Company_, was aired in 1981 with Elisabeth Sladen reprising her role as companion Sarah Jane Smith and John Leeson as the voice of K9, but was not picked up as a regular series.

Concept art for an animated _Doctor Who_ series was produced by animation company Nelvana in the 1980s, but the series was not produced.[177]

Following the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled _Torchwood_ (an anagram of "Doctor Who"), set in modern-day Cardiff and investigating alien activities and crime. The series debuted on BBC Three on 22 October 2006.[178] John Barrowman reprised his role of Jack Harkness from the 2005 series of _Doctor Who_.[179] Two other actresses who appeared in Doctor Who also star in the series; Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, who also played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 _Doctor Who_ episode "The Unquiet Dead",[180] and Naoko Mori who reprised her role as Toshiko Sato first seen in "Aliens of London". A second series of _Torchwood_ aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her _Doctor Who_ role of Martha Jones. A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called _Children of Earth_ which was set largely in London. A fourth series, _Torchwood: Miracle Day_ jointly produced by BBC Wales, BBC Worldwide and the American entertainment company Starz debuted in 2011. The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting.

_The Sarah Jane Adventures_, starring Elisabeth Sladen who reprised her role as investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, was developed by CBBC; a special aired on New Year's Day 2007 and a full series began on 24 September 2007.[181] A second series followed in 2008, notable for (as noted above) featuring the return of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. A third in 2009 featured a crossover appearance from the main show by David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. In 2010, a further such appearance featured Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor alongside former companion actress Katy Manning reprising her role as Jo Grant. A final, three-story fifth series was transmitted in autumn 2011 – uncompleted due to the death of Elisabeth Sladen in early 2011.

An animated serial, _The Infinite Quest_, aired alongside the 2007 series of _Doctor Who_ as part of the children's television series _Totally Doctor Who_. The serial featured the voices of series regulars David Tennant and Freema Agyeman but is not considered part of the 2007 series.[182] A second animated serial, _Dreamland_, aired in six parts on the BBC Red Button service, and the official _Doctor Who_ website in 2009.[183]

_Class_, featuring students of Coal Hill School, was first aired on-line on BBC Three from 22 October 2016, as a series of eight 45 minute episodes, written by Patrick Ness.[184][185] Peter Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor appears in the show's first episode.[186] The series was picked up by BBC America on 8 January 2016 and by BBC One a day later.[187] On 7 September 2017, BBC Three controller Damian Kavanagh confirmed that the series had officially been cancelled.[188]

Numerous other spin-off series have been created not by the BBC but by the respective owners of the characters and concepts. Such spin-offs include the novel and audio drama series _Faction Paradox_, _Iris Wildthyme_ and _Bernice Summerfield_; as well as the made-for-video series _P.R.O.B.E._; the Australian-produced television series _K-9_, which aired a 26-episode first season on Disney XD;[189] and the audio spin-off _Counter-Measures_.[190]

Aftershows

When the revived series of _Doctor Who_ was brought back, an aftershow series was created by the BBC, titled _Doctor Who Confidential_. There have been three aftershow series created, with the latest one titled _Doctor Who: The Fan Show_, which began airing from the tenth series. Each series follows behind-the-scenes footage on the making of _Doctor Who_ through clips and interviews with the cast, production crew and other people, including those who have participated in the television series in some manner. Each episode deals with a different topic, and in most cases refers to the _Doctor Who_ episode that preceded it.

Charity episodes

In 1983, coinciding with the series' 20th anniversary, _The Five Doctors_ was shown as part of the annual BBC Children in Need Appeal, however it was not a charity-based production, simply scheduled within the line-up of Friday 25 November 1983. This was the programme's very first co-production with Australian broadcaster ABC.[191] Featuring three of the first five Doctors, a new actor to replace the deceased William Hartnell, and unused footage to represent Tom Baker.[192] This was a full-length, 90-minute film, the longest single episode of _Doctor Who_ produced to date (the television movie ran slightly longer on broadcast where it included commercial breaks).[193]

In 1993, for the franchise's 30th anniversary, another charity special, titled _Dimensions in Time_ was produced for Children in Need, featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera _EastEnders_, the action taking place in the latter's Albert Square location and around Greenwich. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the Pulfrich effect requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.

In 1999, another special, _Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death_, was made for Comic Relief and later released on VHS. An affectionate parody of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with cliffhangers, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes). In the story, the Doctor (Rowan Atkinson) encounters both the Master (Jonathan Pryce) and the Daleks. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, Richard E. Grant, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant and Joanna Lumley. The script was written by Steven Moffat, later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series.[194]

Since the return of _Doctor Who_ in 2005, the franchise has produced two original "mini-episodes" to support Children in Need. The first, aired in November 2005, was an untitled seven-minute scene which introduced David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. It was followed in November 2007 by "Time Crash", a 7-minute scene which featured the Tenth Doctor meeting the Fifth Doctor (played once again by Peter Davison).

A set of two mini-episodes, titled "Space" and "Time" respectively, were produced to support Comic Relief. They were aired during the Comic Relief 2011 event.[195]

During 2011 Children in Need, an exclusively filmed segment showed the Doctor addressing the viewer, attempting to persuade them to purchase items of his clothing, which were going up for auction for Children in Need. The 2012 edition of CiN featured the mini-episode _The Great Detective_.

Spoofs and cultural references

_Doctor Who_ has been satirised and spoofed on many occasions by comedians including Spike Milligan (a Dalek invades his bathroom — Milligan, naked, hurls a soap sponge at it) and Lenny Henry. Jon Culshaw frequently impersonates the Fourth Doctor in the BBC _Dead Ringers_ series.[196] _Doctor Who_ fandom has also been lampooned on programs such as _Saturday Night Live_, _The Chaser's War on Everything_, _Mystery Science Theater 3000_, _Family Guy_, _American Dad!_, _Futurama_, _South Park_, _Community_ as Inspector Spacetime, _The Simpsons_ and _The Big Bang Theory_. As part of the 50th anniversary programmes, former Fifth Doctor Peter Davison directed, wrote and co-starred in the parody _The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot_, which also starred two other former Doctors, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy, and cameo appearances from cast and crew involved in the programme, including showrunner Steven Moffat and Doctors Paul McGann, David Tennant and Matt Smith.[197]

The Doctor in his fourth incarnation has been represented on several episodes of _The Simpsons_[198] and Matt Groening's other animated series _Futurama_.[199][200]

There have also been many references to _Doctor Who_ in popular culture and other science fiction, including _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ ("The Neutral Zone")[201] and _Leverage_. In the Channel 4 series _Queer as Folk_ (created by later _Doctor Who_ executive producer Russell T. Davies), the character of Vince was portrayed as an avid _Doctor Who_ fan, with references appearing many times throughout in the form of clips from the programme. In a similar manner, the character of Oliver on _Coupling_ (created and written by current show runner Steven Moffat) is portrayed as a _Doctor Who_ collector and enthusiast. References to _Doctor Who_ have also appeared in the young adult fantasy novels _Brisingr_[202] and _High Wizardry_,[203] the video game _Rock Band_,[204] the Adult Swim comedy show _Robot Chicken_, the _Family Guy_ episodes "Blue Harvest" and "420", and the game _RuneScape_. It has also be referenced in _Destroy All Humans! 2_, by civilians in the game's variation of England,[205] and multiple times throughout the _Ace Attorney_ series.[206]

_Doctor Who_ has been a reference in several political cartoons, from a 1964 cartoon in the _Daily Mail_ depicting Charles de Gaulle as a Dalek[207] to a 2008 edition of _This Modern World_ by Tom Tomorrow in which the Tenth Doctor informs an incredulous character from 2003 that the Democratic Party will nominate an African-American as its presidential candidate.[208]

The word "TARDIS" is an entry in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary[209] and the iOS dictionary.

Museums and exhibitions

There have been various exhibitions of _Doctor Who_ in the United Kingdom, including the now closed exhibitions at:

-   Land's End (Cornwall)
-   Blackpool
-   Llangollen
-   Kelvingrove Museum, Glasgow
-   Coventry Transport Museum, Coventry
-   Centre for Life, Newcastle upon Tyne
-   Melbourne, Australia (only international DW concert to be performed)
-   Kensington Olympia Two, London
-   Longleat, which ran for 30 years.[210]
-   Cardiff (the city where the series is filmed).[211]

The exhibition closed down on the 9th of September 2017

Merchandise

Since its beginnings, _Doctor Who_ has generated hundreds of products related to the show, from toys and games to collectible picture cards and postage stamps. These include board games, card games, gamebooks, computer games, roleplaying games, action figures and a pinball game. Many games have been released that feature the Daleks, including Dalek computer games.

Audios

The earliest _Doctor Who_-related audio release was a 21-minute narrated abridgement of the First Doctor television story _The Chase_ released in 1966. Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on LP record; _Doctor Who and the Pescatons_ featuring the Fourth Doctor. The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story _State of Decay_ in 1981. In 1988, during a hiatus in the television show, _Slipback_, the first radio drama, was transmitted.

Since 1999, Big Finish Productions has released several different series of Doctor Who audios on CD. The earliest of these featured the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, with Paul McGann's Eight Doctor joining the line in 2001. Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor began appearing for Big Finish in 2012. Along with the main range, adventures of the First, Second and Third Doctors have been produced in both limited cast and full cast formats, as well as audiobooks. The 2013 series _Destiny of the Doctor_, produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show. Along with this, in May 2016 the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, appeared alongside Cathrine Tate in a collection of three audio adventures.

In addition to these main lines, both the BBC and Big Finish have produced original audio dramas and audiobooks based on spin-off material, such as _Torchwood_ and _The Sarah Jane Adventures_ series.

Books

_Doctor Who_ books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day. From 1965 to 1991 the books published were primarily novelised adaptations of broadcast episodes; beginning in 1991 an extensive line of original fiction was launched, the Virgin New Adventures and Virgin Missing Adventures. Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by BBC Books. Numerous non-fiction books about the series, including guidebooks and critical studies, have also been published, and a dedicated _Doctor Who Magazine_ with newsstand circulation has been published regularly since 1979. This is published by Panini, as is the _Doctor Who Adventures_ magazine for younger fans.

Video games

Numerous _Doctor Who_ video games have been created from the mid-80s through to the present day. One of the recent ones is a match-3 game released in November 2013 for iOS, Android, Amazon App Store and Facebook called _Doctor Who: Legacy_. It has been constantly updated since its release and features all of the Doctors as playable characters as well as over 100 companions.[212]

Another video game instalment is LEGO Dimensions – in which Doctor Who is one of the many "Level Packs" in the game. At the moment, the pack contains the Twelfth Doctor (who can reincarnate into the others), K9, the TARDIS and a Victorian London adventure level area. The game and pack released in November 2015.

Another recent game is called _Doctor Who Infinity_, which was released on Steam on 7 August 2018.[213] It was nominated for "Best Start-up" at The Independent Game Developers' Association Awards 2018.[214][215]


Chronology and canonicity

Since the creation of the _Doctor Who_ character by BBC Television in the early 1960s, a myriad of stories have been published about _Doctor Who_, in different media: apart from the actual television episodes that continue to be produced by the BBC, there have also been novels, comics, short stories, audio books, radio plays, interactive video games, game books, webcasts, DVD extras, and stage performances. The BBC takes no position on the canonicity of any of such stories, and producers of the show have expressed distaste for the idea of canonicity.[216]


Awards

The show has received recognition as one of Britain's finest television programmes, winning the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005–2010) awards at the National Television Awards during Russell T Davies' tenure as executive producer.[217][218] In 2011, Matt Smith became the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA Television Award for Best Actor and in 2016, Michelle Gomez became the first female to receive a BAFTA nomination for the series, getting a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her work as Missy. , Jenna Louise Coleman and Steven Moffat accepting an award for _Doctor Who_]]In 2013, the Peabody Awards honoured _Doctor Who_ with an Institutional Peabody "for evolving with technology and the times like nothing else in the known television universe."[219] The programme is listed in _Guinness World Records_ as the longest-running science fiction television show in the world,[220] the "most successful" science fiction series of all time—based on its overall broadcast ratings, DVD and book sales, and iTunes traffic—[221] and for the largest ever simulcast of a TV drama with its 50th anniversary special.[222] During its original run, it was recognised for its imaginative stories, creative low-budget special effects, and pioneering use of electronic music (originally produced by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop).

In 1975, Season 11 of the series won a Writers' Guild of Great Britain award for Best Writing in a Children's Serial. In 1996, BBC television held the "Auntie Awards" as the culmination of their "TV60" series, celebrating 60 years of BBC television broadcasting, where _Doctor Who_ was voted as the "Best Popular Drama" the corporation had ever produced, ahead of such ratings heavyweights as _EastEnders_ and _Casualty_.[223] In 2000, _Doctor Who_ was ranked third in a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, produced by the British Film Institute and voted on by industry professionals.[224] In 2005, the series came first in a survey by _SFX_ magazine of "The Greatest UK Science Fiction and Fantasy Television Series Ever". Also, in the 100 Greatest Kids' TV shows (a Channel 4 countdown in 2001), the 1963–1989 run was placed at number eight.

The revived series has received recognition from critics and the public, across various awards ceremonies. It won five BAFTA TV Awards, including Best Drama Series, the highest-profile and most prestigious British television award for which the series has ever been nominated.[225] It was very popular at the BAFTA Cymru Awards, with 25 wins overall including Best Drama Series (twice), Best Screenplay/Screenwriter (thrice) and Best Actor.[226] It was also nominated for 7 Saturn Awards, winning the only Best International Series in the ceremony's history. In 2009, _Doctor Who_ was voted the 3rd greatest show of the 2000s by Channel 4, behind _Top Gear_ and _The Apprentice_. The episode "Vincent and the Doctor" was shortlisted for a Mind Award at the 2010 Mind Mental Health Media Awards for its "touching" portrayal of Vincent van Gogh.[227]

It has won the Short Form of the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, the oldest science fiction/fantasy award for films and series, six times since 2006. The winning episodes were "The Empty Child"/"The Doctor Dances" (2006), "The Girl in the Fireplace" (2007), "Blink" (2008), "The Waters of Mars" (2010), "The Pandorica Opens"/"The Big Bang" (2011), and "The Doctor's Wife" (2012).[228][229][230][231] The 2016 Christmas special "The Return of Doctor Mysterio" is also a finalists for the 2017 Hugo Awards.[232] Doctor Who star Matt Smith won Best Actor in the 2012 National Television awards alongside Karen Gillan who won Best Actress. _Doctor Who_ has been nominated for over 200 awards and has won over a hundred of them.

In 2004 and 2007, _Doctor Who_ was ranked #18 and #22 on TV Guide's Top Cult Shows Ever.[233][234] In 2013, TV Guide ranked it as the #6 sci-fi show.[235]

As a British series, the majority of its nominations and awards have been for national competitions such as the BAFTAs, but it has occasionally received nominations in mainstream American awards, most notably a nomination for "Favorite Sci-Fi Show" in the 2008 People's Choice Awards and the series has been nominated multiple times in the Spike Scream Awards, with Smith winning Best Science Fiction Actor in 2011. The Canadian Constellation Awards have also recognised the series.

This analysis is framed specifically by the Freudian notion of the uncanny, and suggests that Moffat's work on Doctor Who confronts unconscious perceptions, repressed fears and death itself through storytelling techniques which attempt to connect directly with the audience by deconstructing the distance between material reality and the series's fantasy space.

[7] Newman is often given sole creator credit for the series. Some reference works such as _The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947–1979_ by Vincent Terrace erroneously credit Terry Nation with creating _Doctor Who_, because of the way his name is credited in the two Peter Cushing films.
Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode "Human Nature", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity.
