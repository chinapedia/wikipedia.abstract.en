JOSHIA GRAY[1] (born September 9, 1993) is an American professional basketball player who is currently a free agent. He played college basketball for Texas Tech, Odessa College and LSU.


Early life and high school career

Born in Lake Charles, Louisiana, Gray had a difficult time growing up, losing his mother when he was 16 and getting trouble with the law as a teenager, being arrested multiple times, forcing him to bounce from school to school.[2]

Gray first attended Washington-Marion Magnet High School, leading them to the 2010 Louisiana Class 4A State Semifinals in his sophomore season. As a junior, he transferred to Christian Life Center Academy, where he averaged 20 points per game and led them to a 20–4 record. In his senior season, he transferred to Wheatley High School where he averaged 24 points, six assists and three steals and led them to the Class 4A playoffs.[3]


College career

Gray began his college career at Texas Tech, averaging 26.7 minutes per game, 9.3 points, 3.2 assists and 2.5 steals as a freshman. In his sophomore season, he transferred to Odessa College, averaging 34.7 points, 5.9 assists and 2.7 steals, earning First Team JC All-America honors and the conference MVP.[4]

As a junior, he transferred to LSU and was able to play immediately for them due to Odessa being a junior college. He would then average 7.1 points, 2.3 rebounds, and 3.8 assists as a junior and 5.4 points, 2.1 rebounds and 1.8 assists as a senior, with the latter season having eventual #1 pick Ben Simmons as a teammate that year.[5][6]


Professional career

Northern Arizona Suns (2016–2018)

After going undrafted in the 2016 NBA draft, Gray tried out with the Orlando Magic in the 2016 NBA Summer League. Gray was then acquired by the Northern Arizona Suns on October 31, 2016, after multiple successful local tryouts, which included paid tryouts with the Los Angeles D-Fenders and Austin Spurs.[7] On November 12, he made his professional debut in a 121–104 win over the Iowa Energy, recording 13 points, three rebounds and three assists in 18 minutes off the bench.[8]

Phoenix Suns (2018)

On February 1, 2018, after Isaiah Canaan fractured his tibula the previous night against the Dallas Mavericks, the Phoenix Suns signed Gray to a 10-day contract[9] to help shore up the point guard spot a bit.[10] He made his debut a day later, recording 7 points, 1 rebound, and 1 assist in 8 minutes of play in a blowout loss to the Utah Jazz. Gray would put up season-highs of 9 points and a team-high 7 assists in a February 6 blowout loss to the San Antonio Spurs. He would sign his second 10-day contract on February 11 before being waived on February 21 for Shaquille Harrison.[11]

On August 18, 2018, Changwon LG Sakers of the Korean Basketball League was reported to have signed Gray.[12] In July 2019, Gray joined the Brooklyn Nets for the 2019 NBA Summer League.
