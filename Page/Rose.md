Rosa}}

A ROSE is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus _ROSA_, in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa. Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.[1]


Etymology

The name _rose_ comes from French, itself from Latin _rosa_, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ρόδον _rhódon_ (Aeolic βρόδον _wródon_), itself borrowed from Old Persian _wrd-_ (_wurdi_), related to Avestan _varəδa_, Sogdian _ward_, Parthian _wâr_.[2][3]


Botany

The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (–13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.

The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of _Rosa sericea_, which usually has only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some _Rosa sericea_, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes.[4] Roses are insect-pollinated in nature.

The aggregate fruit of the rose is a berry-like structure called a rose hip. Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are so tightly petalled that they do not provide access for pollination. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. _Rosa pimpinellifolia_) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 "seeds" (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (_Rosa canina_) and rugosa rose (_Rosa rugosa_), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some birds, particularly finches, also eat the seeds.

The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as _Rosa rugosa_ and _Rosa pimpinellifolia_ have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Species

]] The genus _Rosa_ is subdivided into four subgenera:

-   _HULTHEMIA_ (formerly _Simplicifoliae_, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, _Rosa persica_ and _Rosa berberifolia_, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
-   _HESPERRHODOS_ (from the Greek for "western rose") contains _Rosa minutifolia_ and _Rosa stellata_, from North America.
-   _PLATYRHODON_ (from the Greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, _Rosa roxburghii_ (also known as the chestnut rose).
-   _ROSA_ (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called _Eurosa_) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
    -   _BANKSIANAE_ – white and yellow flowered roses from China.
    -   _BRACTEATAE_ – three species, two from China and one from India.
    -   _CANINAE_ – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa.
    -   _CAROLINAE_ – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America.
    -   _CHINENSIS_ – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed-color roses from China and Burma.
    -   _GALLICANAE_ – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.
    -   _GYMNOCARPAE_ – one species in western North America (_Rosa gymnocarpa_), others in east Asia.
    -   _LAEVIGATAE_ – a single white flowered species from China.
    -   _PIMPINELLIFOLIAE_ – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.
    -   _ROSA_ (syn. sect. _Cinnamomeae_) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.
    -   _SYNSTYLAE_ – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas.


Uses

Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Ornamental plants

The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as _Rosa glauca_ and _Rosa rubiginosa_), ornamental thorns (such as _Rosa sericea_) or for their showy fruit (such as _Rosa moyesii_).

Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China.[5] Many thousands of rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having mutated into additional petals.

In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

Cut flowers

Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.

In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.[6]

Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.

Perfume

Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (_Rosa_ × _damascena_ 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world _Rosa_ × _centifolia_ is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.

The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil.[7] β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Food and drink

'' hips]] ]] Rose hips are occasionally made into jam, jelly, marmalade, and soup or are brewed for tea, primarily for their high vitamin C content. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.[8] made with rose water]] Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used heavily in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, gumdrops, kanafeh, nougat, and Turkish delight.

Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas.

In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.[9][10]

Rose flowers are used as food, also usually as flavouring or to add their scent to food.[11] Other minor uses include candied rose petals.[12]

Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.

Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,[13] there are only certain _Rosa_ species, varieties, and parts are on the _Generally Recognized as Safe_ lists.

-   Rose absolute: _Rosa alba_ L., _Rosa centifolia_ L., _Rosa damascena_ Mill., _Rosa gallica_ L., and vars. of these spp.
-   Rose (otto of roses, attar of roses): Ditto
-   Rose buds: Ditto
-   Rose flowers: Ditto
-   Rose fruit (hips): Ditto
-   Rose leaves: _Rosa_ _spp._[14]

Medicine

The rose hip, usually from _R. canina_, is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. _Rosa chinensis_ has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth.[15] In pre-modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, "compound of roses", from ῥόδων, "of roses"[16]) is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Art and symbolism

illuminated with roses, illustrated between 1305 and 1340 in Zürich. It contains love songs in Middle High German ]] The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite.[17][18] In the _Iliad_, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the "immortal oil of the rose"[19][20] and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him "among rose blossoms".[21][22] The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood.[23][24] Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel _The Golden Ass_ by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.[25]

Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The color of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation.[26] [27][28] The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.[29][30] of the scene in the Temple Garden, where supporters of the rival factions in the Wars of the Roses pick either red or white roses]] Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary.[31] In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens.[32] Albrecht Dürer's painting _The Feast of the Rosary_ (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.[33]

Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.

Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.

Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist.

Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works.


Pests and diseases

Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae.

Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.


Floral emblem of the United States

In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose[34] the floral emblem of the United States.[35]
