ELWYN BROOKS WHITE (July 11, 1899 – October 1, 1985)[1] was an American writer. For more than fifty years, he was a contributor to _The New Yorker_ magazine. He was also a co-author of the English language style guide _The Elements of Style._ In addition, he wrote books for children, including _Stuart Little_ (1945), _Charlotte's Web_ (1952), and _The Trumpet of the Swan_ (1970). In a 2012 survey of _School Library Journal_ readers, _Charlotte's Web_ was voted the top children's novel.[2]


Life

White was born in Mount Vernon, New York, the youngest child of Samuel Tilly White, the president of a piano firm, and Jessie Hart White, the daughter of Scottish-American painter William Hart.[3] Elwyn's older brother Stanley Hart White, known as Stan, a professor of landscape architecture and the inventor of the Vertical Garden, taught E. B. White to read and to explore the natural world.[4] White graduated from Cornell University with a bachelor of arts degree in 1921. He got the nickname "Andy" at Cornell, where tradition confers that moniker on any male student whose surname is White, after Cornell co-founder Andrew Dickson White.[5] While at Cornell, he worked as editor of _The Cornell Daily Sun_ with classmate Allison Danzig, who later became a sportswriter for _The New York Times_. White was also a member of the Aleph Samach[6] and Quill and Dagger societies and Phi Gamma Delta ("Fiji") fraternity.

After graduation, White worked for the United Press (now United Press International) and the American Legion News Service in 1921 and 1922. In 1922–23, he was a cub reporter for _The Seattle Times_. On one occasion, when White was stuck writing a story, a Times editor said, "Just say the words."[7] He then worked for almost two years with the Frank Seaman advertising agency as a production assistant and copywriter[8] before returning to New York City in 1924. When _The New Yorker_ was founded in 1925, White submitted manuscripts to it. Katharine Angell, the literary editor, recommended to editor-in-chief and founder Harold Ross that White be hired as a staff writer. However, it took months to convince him to come to a meeting at the office and additional weeks to convince him to work on the premises. Eventually, he agreed to work in the office on Thursdays.[9]

White was shy around women, claiming he had “too small a heart, too large a pen."[10] But in 1929, culminating an affair which led to her divorce, White and Katherine Angell were married. They had a son, Joel White, a naval architect and boat builder, who later owned Brooklin Boat Yard in Brooklin, Maine. Katharine's son from her first marriage, Roger Angell, has spent decades as a fiction editor for _The New Yorker_ and is well known as the magazine's baseball writer.

In her foreword to _Charlotte's Web_, Kate DiCamillo quotes White as saying, "All that I hope to say in books, all that I ever hope to say, is that I love the world."[11] White also loved animals, farms and farming implements, seasons, and weather formats.

James Thurber described White as a quiet man who disliked publicity and who, during his time at _The New Yorker_, would slip out of his office via the fire escape to a nearby branch of Schrafft's to avoid visitors whom he didn't know.

White had Alzheimer's disease and died on October 1, 1985, at his farm home in North Brooklin, Maine.[12] He is buried in the Brooklin Cemetery beside Katharine, who died in 1977.[13]


Career

E. B. White published his first article in _The New Yorker_ in 1925, then joined the staff in 1927 and continued to contribute for almost six decades. Best recognized for his essays and unsigned "Notes and Comment" pieces, he gradually became the magazine's most important contributor. From the beginning to the end of his career at _The New Yorker,_ he frequently provided what the magazine calls "Newsbreaks" (short, witty comments on oddly worded printed items from many sources) under various categories such as "Block That Metaphor." He also was a columnist for _Harper's Magazine_ from 1938 to 1943.

In 1949, White published _Here Is New York_, a short book based on an article he had been commissioned to write for _Holiday_. Editor Ted Patrick approached White about writing the essay telling him it would be fun. "Writing is never 'fun,' " replied White.[14] That article reflects the writer's appreciation of a city that provides its residents with both "the gift of loneliness and the gift of privacy." It concludes with a dark note touching on the forces that could destroy the city that he loved. This prescient "love letter" to the city was re-published in 1999 on his centennial with an introduction by his stepson, Roger Angell.

In 1959, White edited and updated _The Elements of Style_. This handbook of grammatical and stylistic guidance for writers of American English was first written and published in 1918 by William Strunk Jr., one of White's professors at Cornell. White's reworking of the book was extremely well received, and later editions followed in 1972, 1979, and 1999. Maira Kalman illustrated an edition in 2005. That same year, a New York composer named Nico Muhly premiered a short opera based on the book. The volume is a standard tool for students and writers and remains required reading in many composition classes. The complete history of ''The Elements of Style ''is detailed in Mark Garvey's _Stylized: A Slightly Obsessive History of Strunk & White's The Elements of Style_.

In 1978, White won a special Pulitzer Prize citing "his letters, essays and the full body of his work".[15] He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963 and honorary memberships in a variety of literary societies throughout the United States. The 1973 Oscar-nominated Canadian animated short _The Family That Dwelt Apart_ is narrated by White and is based on his short story of the same name.[16]


Children's books

In the late 1930s, White turned his hand to children's fiction on behalf of a niece, Janice Hart White. His first children's book, _Stuart Little_, was published in 1945, and _Charlotte's Web_ appeared in 1952. _Stuart Little_ initially received a lukewarm welcome from the literary community. However, both books went on to receive high acclaim, and _Charlotte's Web_ won the Newbery Medal from the American Library Association.

White received the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal from the U.S. professional children's librarians in 1970. It recognized his "substantial and lasting contributions to children's literature." [17] That year he was also the U.S. nominee and eventual runner-up for the biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award, as he was again in 1976.[18][19] Also in 1970, White's third children's novel was published, _The Trumpet of the Swan_. In 1973 it won the Sequoyah Award from Oklahoma and the William Allen White Award from Kansas, both selected by students voting for their favorite book of the year. In 2012, School Library Journal sponsored a survey of readers which identified _Charlotte's Web_ as the best children's novel ("fictional title for readers 9–12" years old). The librarian who conducted it said, "It is impossible to conduct a poll of this sort and expect [White's novel] to be anywhere but #1."[20][21]
