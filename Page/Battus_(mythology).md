BATTUS (means "tongue-tied"[1])was a figure in Greek mythology who witnessed Hermes stealing Apollo's cattle in Maenalus in Arcadia. Hermes gave him a heifer on condition Battus kept the theft secret. On returning in disguise, Hermes offered to reward Battus if he would tell him the location of the cattle; Battus did so, and for his greed was punished by being turned into stone.[2][3]
