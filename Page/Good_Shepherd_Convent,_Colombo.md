__NOTOC__ GOOD SHEPHERD CONVENT is a semi- government Catholic Girls' school founded in May 1869 in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Located in the neighbourhood of Kotahena, the Convent- School educates girls from kindergarten to age 19.The students who are educated and guided by these good shepherd convent sisters are specially given the name 'shepherdians' where they use it with more pride.

The Good Shepherd congregation marked the beginning of the sisters' mission to British Ceylon and the Far East.[1] Nuns from this original convent opened Good Shepherd Convent in Kandy, St Mary's School in Pettah (closed) and St Bridget's Convent in Cinnamon Gardens.[2][3] In 1939, sisters based in Colombo expanded to Singapore, then part of the Straits Settlements, and present-day Malaysia.[4]
