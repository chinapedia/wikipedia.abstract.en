BO CARINAE (BO CAR / HD 93420 / SAO 238447) is a variable star in the constellation Carina.

BO Car has a maximum apparent magnitude of +7.18. Its distance and membership is uncertain, but its possible membership to the star cluster Trumpler 15 allows a distance estimate of approximately 2,500 parsecs (8,150 light-years).[1][2]

BO Car is a red supergiant of spectral type M4Ib with an effective temperature of 3,525 K. It is one of largest stars with a radius of 790 solar radii. Its bolometric luminosity is .[3] Mass-loss is on the order of 0.3 × 10^(−9) solar masses per year.[4]

Billed as an irregular variable like TZ Cassiopeiae or V528 Carinae; its apparent brightness fluctuates between magnitude +7.18 and +8.50 without periodicity.[5]
