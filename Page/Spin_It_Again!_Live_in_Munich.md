_SPIN IT AGAIN! LIVE IN MUNICH_ is a live album and video by the Canadian band Saga. It was recorded in 2012 at the end of their 20/20 tour and celebrates the reunion with original singer Michael Sadler. It was also the first Saga release featuring their new drummer Mike Thorne.[1] Besides three songs from _20/20_, it includes mainly songs from the first five Saga albums. The concert was released on different formats by edel records/earMUSIC, including a double CD, DVD (Super Jewel Box packaging) and Blu-Ray. The video formats also include a twenty-minute tour documentary. The CD has edited applause between the main set and the encores, but otherwise the performance is identical. As is typical for Saga shows in Germany, Michael Sadler does some German announcements. The concert also includes a litte "unplugged" set. After returning to the stage, Sadler says "What shall I play?". He starts on "Images (Chapter 1)", then stops, goes into "No Regrets (Chapter 5)", stops again and finally declares "I got it!" before launching into "Tired World (Chapter 6)".

The live version of "On the Loose" was on radio rotation around the time of release, so it can be viewed as the "single" from the album.
