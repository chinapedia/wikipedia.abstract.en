History

The roots of Royal Institute go back to 1971 when its founder and current Chairman G.T. Bandara commenced preparing students for Local A/Levels examinations and BSc degrees (External) of the University of Peradeniya in Physical and Biological Sciences.

Royal Institute International School of Higher Education was established in 1982 as a private limited liability company to provide international education by introducing London O/Level and A/Level courses.

With a view to provide a continuity of education up to tertiary level, after negotiating with the University of London, the Institute commenced preparing students for the internationally reputed degrees of the University of London in 1990.

As a part of the general development plan to expand activities further, a branch school was established in Nugegoda in 1993 to provide primary education which has since been upgraded to a fully fledged International School. In the year 1996 another branch was established in Maharagama followed by starting an International Girls school in Colombo 6 in 2008 in order to accommodate the aspirations of certain parents who wished to educate their daughters in a school exclusively meant for girls.
