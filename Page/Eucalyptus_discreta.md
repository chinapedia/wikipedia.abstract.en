Description

_Eucalyptus discreta_ is a shrub or mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The bark is smooth creamy brown and pale grey, often with coarse ribbons of loose bark toward the base of the stem. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull green, linear to narrow oblong leaves that are long, wide and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same slightly glossy green on both sides, narrow lance-shaped to elliptic or curved, long, wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are borne in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval, long, wide, usually with a hemispherical operculum that is up to the same length as the floral cup. Flowering occurs between January and April and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, shortly barrel-shaped fruit long and wide, with the valves at about the level of the rim.[1][2][3]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus discreta_ was first formally described by the botanist Ian Brooker in 1979 in the journal _Brunonia_. The type specimen was collected by Brooker in 1974 about east of Esperance[4] and the specific epithet (_discreta_) is a Latin word meaning "separated"[5] referring to the juvenile leaves.[6]

This species is part of the _Eucalyptus_ subgenus _Symphyomyrtus_ in the section _Bisectae_ and the subsection _Destitutae_. It is closely related to _E. uncinata_ in which the juvenile leaves are joined at the base.[7]


Distribution and habitat

This mallee grows in open shrubland on flats in coastal areas in the Goldfields-Esperance region between Ravensthorpe and the Nullarbor Plain in sandy-loamy soils usually over limestone or granite.[8][9]


Conservation status

_Eucalyptus discreta_ is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[10]
