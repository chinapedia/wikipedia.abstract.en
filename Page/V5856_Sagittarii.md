V5856 SAGITTARII, or _ASASSN-16ma_, was a bright nova in the constellation Sagittarius discovered by All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae the 25th of October 2016[1], which peaked at magnitude of 5.4 in early November 2016.[2] It is one of the brightest novae in recent history, and the brightest since V5668 Sagittarii in 2015. Being in one of the densest regions of the sky (the galactic core) it is nearly impossible to determine the culprit system, but due to the nature of the nova, a white dwarf and giant star binary system is the most likely origin.
