CHENG WEI (; born 19 May 1983) is a Chinese billionaire businessman.[1] He is the founder of DiDi (formerly known as Didi Kuaidi and Didi Chuxing), China's largest mobile transportation platform.[2] In 2012, after 8 years at Alibaba Group's regional and Alipay's operations, Wei founded Beijing Orange Technology Co Ltd in Zhongguancun, and soon launched Didi Dache, a taxi-hailing app.[3] In February 2015, the company merged with Kuaidi Dache and was renamed Didi Kuaidi.[4] In August 2016, DiDi acquired the Chinese division of Uber.[5]


Biography

Wei was born in 1983 in Shangrao, Jiangxi, China. He received a bachelor's degree in administration from Beijing University of Chemical Technology.[6][7][8]

After graduation, Wei served as an assistant to a chairman at a foot massage company. He soon found that the job was not quite what he had expected, and, about one year later, applied to join Alibaba as a sales person for its business-to-business e-commerce service in 2005. In his six years at Alibaba, Wei rose to being a sales manager for the northern region of China. Then, he moved to China's largest third-party online payment platform, Alipay, where he quickly gained a reputation as a talented manager despite his age and rose through the ranks to become the company's youngest regional manager.[9][10][11]

In 2012, Wei left Alibaba and founded Beijing Orange Technology Co and launched Didi Dache - meaning "Beep Beep Call a Taxi" - the initial incarnation of his ride-hailing service.[12] In 2014, he hired Jean Liu(Liu Qing), a former Goldman Sachs Asia managing director as the COO of his company.[13] In February 2015, the company merged with its rival Kuaidi Dache and was renamed Didi Kuaidi.[14] In August 2016, DiDi acquired all assets of the Chinese division of Uber, including its brand, business operations and data for operation within mainland China. Under the terms of the deal, Wei is set to become a board member of Uber and Uber's CEO also gets a seat on DiDi's board.[15]

Since the company was founded in 2012, under the leadership of Cheng Wei and Jean Liu, DiDi has grown to become one of the worldâ€™s highest valued tech start-ups.[16] The company has evolved from a simple taxi-hailing app to taxi hailing, private car hailing, hitch (social ride-sharing), bus, minibus, chauffeur service, car rental service, enterprise solutions and bike-sharing service.[17]

Wei is among those advocating that China needs to focus intensely on development of artificial intelligence. DiDi has established a big data research center to focus on AI technologies including machine learning and computer vision, which will optimize its dispatch system and route planning.[18]


Other activities

In September 2015, Wei was selected as a Co-Chair of the Summer Davos in Asia: Annual Meeting of the New Champions 2015 and delivered a speech at the forum.[19]
