CRISTÓBAL SENQUIS RIVERA (born November 16, 1946), known professionally as CHAMACO RIVERA, is a Puerto Rican singer and songwriter.[1]


Early life

Rivera was born in Guayama, Puerto Rico to parents Vicenta Senquis and Carmelo Rivera. At the age of 14, Rivera discovered his passion for singing when composer Alfonso Pillot gave him the opportunity to sing in his band.[2]


Career

In 1962, Rivera moved to New York City. The following year, he joined the band New Jersey Swing Combo. He also sang in Mike Hernández's band, where he was given the nickname "Chamaco" as Rivera was the youngest member of the band.[3][4]

In 1970, Rivera began performing with Willie Rosario's band and was featured in his album _De Donde Nace el Ritmo_, in which he recorded his well-known hit "La Vida". He also recorded a second album, _Mas Ritmo_, with Rosario in 1972. Rivera was also one of the featured artists in Rafael Cortijo's 1974 album, _Con las Siete Potencias_.[5]

In 1974, Rivera formed his own band and recorded his first solo album, _Chamaco_. Various solo recordings followed, including _Mi Chamaco_ (1976), _El Juicio_ (1978), _Canción, Hombre y Pueblo_ (1980), and _Chamaco Para Buen Rato_ (1981). Rivera's 1984 album _Por Fin_ features the song "Consuelo", a duet recorded alongside José Feliciano. In 1987, Rivera returned to collaborate with Willie Rosario for a live concert in Cali, Colombia. Rivera continued to record songs and produce new albums well into the 1990s. In 1994, he wrote and recorded the song "Contestame Dios Mio" (a tribute song to fellow singer Hector Lavoe, who died the previous year) for his album _Aqui Estoy_. [6]

In 2011, Rivera recorded two new songs, "Matalas" and "Milagro 33", the latter being a tribute to the 33 miners involved in the 2010 Copiapó mining accident. Rivera teamed up with fellow singer Meñique as well as bandleader Ivan Marrero for the album _El Gran Meñique y Chamaco Rivera Presentan Iván Marrero y su Charanga_, which was released in 2013.[7][8]
