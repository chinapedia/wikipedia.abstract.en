Biography

Career

Over the past thirty years, Hamel has penned hundreds of articles on secular and religious themes. His articles have appeared in national magazines, including James Dobson's Focus on the Family.[5]

Hamel has also researched and written scientific articles, ranging in topics from Big Pharma[6] to surviving cancer[7] for such notable organizations as the Institute for Justice, which litigates liberty issues in the nation’s highest courts.[8] Hamel was himself an IJ plaintiff in a case that was won in Federal Court.[9]

Hamel has contributed to _Religion at the Margins_[10] and the internationally distributed _Solutions Journal_[11] and has reviewed books,[12] spanning subjects from religion[13] to neuroscience.[14]

Hamel is a multi-time cancer survivor,[15] having gone through two bone marrow transplants and multiple other treatments to fight lymphoma. He wrote about his experience in a seminal book that explores his journey from diagnosis to treatment to surviving, called _Stumbling Toward Heaven_.[16] Hamel also produced a video series about his cancer journey in order to demystify the experience of cancer treatment.[17]

In recommending Hamel's book, _We Will Be Landing Shortly: Now What?_,[18] nationally-renowned author and speaker, Brian D. McLaren,[19] who was recognized by _Time Magazine_ as one of the most influential evangelical leaders in the U.S.[20] said, "I trust Mike Hamel's questions more than I trust most people’s answers. I also trust his wisdom… a treasure which nobody gains without pain and struggle. It is a rare gift to enter into the thoughts of a good and wise man who faces something daily we all must face someday."[21]

In _We Will Be Landing Shortly: Now What?_ Hamel also explained how he turned the bedtime stories he had told his four children into Young Adult (YA) novels.[22] He completed the decade-long effort, resulting in a YA novel series called _Matterhorn the Brave_, which was published in 2006 by Living Ink Books, an imprint of AMG Publishers. Each book in the series is set in a different location and time period and features a supporting cast of diverse characters, modeled after his own children. _Matterhorn the Brave_ features four adolescents (ages 12–14) who are recruited by the Praetorians of First Realm — a mirror world of Earth — to keep an eye on the development of civilization. To do this, they time-travel through portals and physically mature to adulthood in the process. When heretics murder the king of First Realm, his daughter, Queen Bea, enlists the kids’ help to recover some of the Ten Talis hidden on Earth. The Talis were fashioned by The Maker as tangible symbols of his power. The heretics need these sacred objects for their scheme of taking over the Earth by rewriting its history.[23]

The Pulitzer Prize winning daily newspaper, _The Gazette_, called Hamel’s _Matterhorn the Brave_ series "a blend of adventure, fantasy and science fiction. There are sword fights, a cast of characters that includes leprechauns, Sasquatch and merpeople, and time travel to various lands and centuries, accompanied by heady physics discussions of how it all works. He [Hamel] eschews interior monologue for action and dialogue and engaging the senses."[24]

The book titles[25] in the _Matterhorn_ series are:

-   Book 1 — _The Sword and the Flute_: Ireland, AD 700
-   Book 2 — _Talis Hunters_: Pacific Northwest, 10,000 BC
-   Book 3 — _Pyramid Scheme_: Egypt, 1325 BC
-   Book 4 – _Jewel Heist_: Bermuda Triangle, AD 1292
-   Book 5 – _Dragon’s Tale_: China, 246 BC
-   Book 6 – _Rylan the Renegade_: Greenland, AD 985
-   Book 7 – _Tunguska Event_: Siberia, AD 1908 and Asia, 160 BC
-   Book 8 – _The Book of Stories_: Chicago, AD 1983

Hamel went on to write _The Lighthouse Company_(TLC) book series, which chronicles a group of kids in the fictional Washington town of Cape Myra, near the Northwest tip of the continental U.S. They meet in the basement of the lighthouse run by Mr. Tyler, aka The Captain. His grandson, JJ, comes to live with him every summer and leads TLC in solving mysteries, finding treasures and helping Cape Myra’s two-man police force.[26] The book titles in the series are:

-   _UFO on the Rez_
-   _Bezer’s Billions_
-   _Zack’s Cavern_
-   _The Long Walk Home_
-   _The Green Bees_

The _Matterhorn_ books fell out-of-print in 2015 and were picked-up by pop culture development and publishing company, Pangea Corporation under their imprint Pangea Press. Both series, _Matterhorn the Brave_ and _TLC_ were released in the Fall of 2016.[27] Because of Hamel's religious background and non-religious writing style, and his multi-volume alternate reality novels for children, he has been likened to "a 21st century C.S. Lewis."[28]
