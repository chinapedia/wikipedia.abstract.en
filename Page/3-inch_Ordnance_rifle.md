The 3-INCH ORDNANCE RIFLE, MODEL 1861 was a wrought iron muzzle-loading rifled cannon that was adopted by the United States Army in 1861 and widely used in field artillery units during the American Civil War. It fired a projectile to a distance of at an elevation of 5°. The 3-inch rifle was not as effective in firing canister shot as the heavier 12-pounder Napoleon, but it proved to be highly accurate at longer ranges when firing shell or shrapnel. There was only one reported case of a 3-inch Ordnance rifle bursting in action. This was in stark contrast to the cast iron 10- and 20-pounder Parrott rifles which occasionally burst without warning, inflicting injury on the gun crews. The Confederate States of America lacked the technology to manufacture successful copies of the 3-inch Ordnance rifle. However, the Confederate States Army respected the weapons and employed those captured from Federal forces.


Background

Griffen gun

By 1835, so many 6-pounder cast iron cannons had burst during proofing tests that the United States Ordnance Board decided to abandon cast iron and produce field artillery from bronze. The successful M1841 6-pounder field gun was the result of this decision. Gun founders had tried to produce cannons from wrought iron, but the material had not fulfilled its promise. In 1844, the 12-inch wrought iron "Peacemaker" cannon burst during a demonstration aboard the _USS Princeton_, killing the Secretaries of State and the Navy and others. The accident was caused by bad forging and burned metal.

In 1854, Safe Harbor Iron Works of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania produced the highest-quality iron rods used in lighthouse construction. The company's superintendent John Griffen proposed manufacturing a cannon by welding together a bundle of wrought iron rods and then drilling out the bore. Later, the process was refined by winding a bar spirally around the bundle. Two additional bars were wound around the bundle and then the mass was subjected to welding heat. Finally, trunnions were added and a bore was drilled out. Samuel J. Reeves, president of Safe Harbor's parent company Phoenix Iron Works, approved of Griffen's method and a cannon was manufactured in late 1854.

The approximately Griffen gun was sent to Fort Monroe for trial but it was not immediately tested. Meanwhile, Griffen was issued a patent on 25 December 1855. Captain Alexander Brydie Dyer undertook proofing tests of the gun in 1856 with Griffen as a witness. The gun passed the proofing tests and when Dyer asked if he wanted to continue, Griffen challenged him to burst the gun. The Griffen gun was subsequently fired 500 times with no apparent damage. Then the gun was fired nine more times with increasing numbers of shot and heavier gunpowder charges. The gun finally burst on the tenth shot when the bore was filled to the muzzle with 13 shot and of gunpowder. After Dyer's highly favorable report, four more Griffen guns were manufactured and sent to be tested.

Reeves's process

The Ordnance Department requested four wrought iron guns of caliber on 21 February 1861. The government paid $370 apiece for two of these guns but neither survived. Phoenix Iron Company also produced a few 6-pounders of caliber of which seven survivors are dated 1861 and have Griffen's 1855 patent stamped on one trunnion. On 24 July 1861, General James Wolfe Ripley of the U.S. Army ordered 300 wrought iron rifled cannons from Phoenix Iron Works. The Ordnance Department designed a gun that eliminated all decorations so that the gun barrel consisted of a sweeping curve. The rifling consisted of seven lands and grooves with a right-hand twist.

Reeves soon discovered that using Griffen's original technique produced only one good gun out of three attempts. A modification to Griffen's process still resulted in 40% of the gun barrels being unusable. A frustrated Reeves then invented an entirely new method of production. He started with a hollow tube or solid bar of wrought iron and wrapped it with sheets of iron until the pile was the diameter of the gun's bore. Sheets of iron were wrapped around the pile and forged and welded to the pile. The finished gun block was then bored out, removing almost all of the original pile. Reeves convinced the patent examiners that his new method was different from a 29 April 1862 patent granted to David T. Yeakel. His process received a patent on 9 December 1862. While the Confederate states manufactured some Parrott rifles, they were unable to produce copies of the 3-inch Ordnance rifle because they lacked the technology.

The Ordnance rifle had a bore (caliber) with a diameter of . Its gun barrel weighed and fired a projectile weighing . The gunpowder charge weighed and fired the projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a distance of at 5° elevation. The 3-inch rifle could hurl a shell at 16° elevation. Unlike a smoothbore cannon, the 3-inch rifle's projectile retained two-thirds of its muzzle velocity at – or – so that its rifled projectile was invisible in flight. A smoothbore cannon's projectile retained only one-third of its muzzle velocity at that range and its round shot could be seen in the air. However, a rifled projectile could become visible if the shell began to tumble out of control. Tumbling occurred when the shell failed to take the grooves inside the gun barrel or when the spin wore off in flight.

The 3-inch Ordnance rifle was mounted on the standard carriage for the 6-pounder field gun. Because its projectile was heavier than a 6-pound shot, the 3-inch rifle's greater recoil sometimes caused damage to the trail or the cheek pieces of the carriage. The 6-pounder carriage weighed . The 3-inch rifle fired case shot (shrapnel), time and percussion shell, and canister shot. The use of bolts (solid shot) was rare. Either Hotchkiss or Schenkl ammunition could be used. Parrott ammunition could be used in an emergency, but it performed poorly since it was designed for the 10-pounder Parrott gun which had only three grooves. For two reasons, canister shot fired from the 3-inch rifle was less effective than canister fired from a 12-pounder Napoleon or a M1841 12-pounder howitzer. First, its 3-inch bore was narrower than the 12-pounder's bore and could blast fewer canister balls. Second, the rifling of the barrel caused the canister to be thrown in an irregular pattern. For these reasons, Union General Henry Jackson Hunt believed that the 3-inch Ordnance rifle's effective canister range was less than half that of the 12-pounder Napoleon's range.

Early in the war, Union batteries were organized with six guns of identical type. At the Battle of Gettysburg on 1–3 July 1863, 50 of the 65 Union batteries numbered six guns and 64 of those batteries had guns of identical type. The exception was Sterling's 2nd Connecticut Light Artillery Battery. Each 6-gun battery required 14 6-horse teams and seven spare horses. The teams pulled the six artillery pieces and limbers, six caissons, one battery wagon, and one traveling forge. Each caisson carried two ammunition chests. The limber carried one additional ammunition chest. The 3-inch Ordnance rifle carried 50 rounds in each ammunition chest. A memo from November 1863 stated that rifled guns ought to have 25 shells, 20 shrapnel (case shot), and five canister rounds in each ammunition chest. In March 1865, a memo recommended that each chest carry 30 shell, 15 shrapnel, and five canister rounds for rifled guns of the horse artillery.

History

Over 350 3-inch Ordnance rifles still existed in 2004, many of them in National Military Parks. Guns with registry numbers from 1 to 235 do not have a patent stamp. Guns numbered from 236 to 543 were inspected between 20 February and 25 November 1862 and have the patent stamp "Patented Dec. 9, 1862" on the left trunnion. The authors suppose that the guns in this second batch were warehoused until the patent date, then stamped. This may have occurred due to bureaucratic errors or because the federal government was not able to provide enough equipment to put the guns in the field. The real reason is not known. Guns numbered 544 through 678 were inspected in 1863; guns 679 through 841 were inspected in 1864; guns 842 through 934 were inspected in 1865; and guns numbered 935 through 965 were inspected in 1866 and 1867.

The 3-inch Ordnance rifle proved to be extremely durable in action, with only one reported case of failure. During the Battle of the Wilderness on 5 May 1864, a 3-inch Ordnance rifle in R. Bruce Ricketts's Battery F, 1st Pennsylvania Light Artillery blew its muzzle off when firing double-canister on the Plank Road. The damaged gun was buried near Todd's Tavern according to a letter Ricketts wrote in 1897. By 1864, the Parrott rifles were being phased out because they had a troubling propensity to burst in action. In addition, the 10-pounder Parrott was heavier than the 3-inch rifle. The 3-inch Ordnance rifle was also capable of extraordinary accuracy. During one of the battles of the Atlanta Campaign in 1864, a Confederate gunner in Lumsden's battery reported that one of his guns was placed in a fortification with an embrasure about one foot wide. Within a short time, three shells came through this opening from a 3-inch Ordnance rifle without exploding. The first struck the gun between the trunnions and vent, gouging out some metal. The second damaged the left cheek of the gun carriage. The third struck the gun's muzzle, crushing it inward, making the gun impossible to load and putting it out of action.

At the Battle of Antietam on 17 September 1862, the Union army employed 93 3-inch Ordnance rifles while the Confederate army had 48. Among the Union army batteries, the 3-inch Ordnance rifle was distributed as follows. One battery (Battery A, Maryland Light Artillery) – 8 guns, eight batteries – 6 guns, eight batteries – 4 guns, two batteries – 2 guns, and one battery – 1 gun. On the Confederate side, one battery (Milledge's Georgia) had 4 guns, 14 batteries had 2 guns, and 16 batteries had 1 gun. While many 3-inch Ordnance rifles survive, only four have a recorded history. The gun with registry number 1 served in Gilbert H. Reynolds's Battery L, 1st New York Light Artillery at the Battle of Gettysburg and was captured by the Confederates. It was recaptured at the Battle of Spottsylvania Court House in May 1864. Gun number 100 served in Samuel Sherer Elder's Battery B, 1st U.S. Artillery and fired the last shot at the Battle of Appomattox Court House. Gun number 233 served in John H. Calef's Battery A, 2nd U.S. Artillery and fired the first shot at Gettysburg. Gun number 247 served in the same battery at Gettysburg, which was previously commanded by John C. Tidball.

The 3-inch Ordnance rifle was utilized until the 1880s. In the years 1879–1881, six of these guns were re-bored to a caliber of , re-rifled, converted to breechloaders, and renamed 3.2-inch Breechloading Rifles (Converted). The guns performed well in their new configuration and this experiment eventually led to the adoption of the 3.2-inch gun M1897. In 1903, more than 200 obsolete 3-inch Ordnance rifles were converted to saluting guns.
