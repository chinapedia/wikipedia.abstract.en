TASCHENPHILHARMONIE (Pocket philharmonic) is a German orchestra, founded in 2005 by Peter Stangel. The chamber ensemble plays symphonic works in three series, with most concerts held at the Allerheiligen-Hofkirche of the Munich Residenz. In addition to concerts which juxtapose classical and contemporary music, they address children in a second series and listeners interested in the making of a composition in a third. The ensemble has styled its name first as DIE TASCHENPHILHARMONIE.


History and program

The ensemble continues a tradition that Arnold Schönberg began in Vienna in 1918 in Wien: the _Verein für musikalische Privataufführungen_ played chamber versions of orchestral works.[1] The format has been compared to the pocket book.[2] The ensemble has been called "das kleinste Sinfonieorchester der Welt" (the world's smallest orchestra).[3]

One concert series of the Taschenphilharmonie is called _Abenteuer für die Ohren_ (Adventure for the ears), combining works by two or three composers, usually contrasting classical and contemporary.[4] A concert on 20 November contrasted Beethoven's 2nd symphony with Jan Václav Voříšek's Symphony in D and a work by Graham Waterhouse,[5] whose _Concerto da camera_ they had premiered in 1911.[6] Another premiere was _=11=_ by , played at the Black Box of the Gasteig.[7] The ensemble performed works such as Wilhelm Killmayer's _Sinfonia 2_ on the occasion of the composer's 80th birthday in 2007, 's _Hamelin_ in 2008, Stravinsky's Concerto in E-flat "Dumbarton Oaks" in 2009, Kurt Weill's Second Symphony in 2010, and Schoenberg's _A Survivor from Warsaw_ in 2015.[8]

A second series addresses children age four to nine. _Große Musik für kleine Hörer_ (Great music for small listeners) introduces classical music to children focusing on a single composer, with the presentation of the music being embedded in a story with Stangel as the narrator.[9][10] Concerts are also played at kindergartens and schools.[11] The 2016 season began with a concert on Humperdinck's _Hänsel und Gretel_.[12] The concerts reach about thousand children per year in live concerts.[13] The series was awarded the Leopold in 2011,[14] _Sommernachtstraum_ was in the "Bestenliste" (List of the best) of the Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik in 2013[15]

A third series is called _Hörakademie_ (Listening academy), offering background information for one work with sound examples before intermission, the complete work afterwards.[16] In 2010, the topic were Mahler's _Rückert-Lieder_, performed with the baritone Wolfgang Wirsching at the _Kleiner Konzertsaal_ of the Gasteig.[17] On 3 March 2016 they analysed and played Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony,[18] on 27 November 2016 Beethoven's 2nd symphony is explored.[19] The series is organized in collaboration with the Munich Volkshochschule[20] and the Hochschule für Musik und Theater München.[21] It was transferred to the Künstlerhaus in the Lenbachhaus beginning in 2016.[22][23]
