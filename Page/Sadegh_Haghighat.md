"Confluence Theory" and "Religious Leadership Theory"

According to "Confluence Theory", political philosophy and political fiqh (jurisprudence) have constructive interactions, and each Islamic political issue, such as justice and distribution of power, should be argued in both disciplines. In his _Six Theories about the Islamic Revolutionâ€™s Victory_, Haghighat has put forward a new theory about the Iranian Revolution. Although modernization has prepared the mainstream of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, charismatic and religious leadership of Imam Khomeini has played an important role in this regard.
