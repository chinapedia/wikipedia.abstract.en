KARL VON KORFF (born 6 October 1867, in Hajen near Gröhnde) was a German anatomist and histologist.

From 1890 to 1895 he studied medicine at the universities of Freiburg, Berlin and Kiel, receiving his doctorate at Kiel in 1895 with the dissertation _Beitrag zur Lehre vom Ulcus corneae serpens_.[1] In 1896/97 he served as a ship's physician for a Hamburg shipping company traveling to China and Japan, and afterwards worked as an assistant to Walther Flemming at the anatomical institute in Kiel. In 1902 he obtained his habilitation for anatomy, and in 1913 was named an associate professor at the University of Tübingen.[2][3]

In 1905 he described what would later become known as "Korff fibers", defined as fibers that pass between odontoblasts at the periphery of the dental pulp and fan out into the dentin.[4][5]
