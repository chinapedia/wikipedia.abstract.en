A.B. ORIGINAL is an Australian hip hop duo made up of Briggs and Trials. A.B. Original stands for Always Black, Original. Both members are Indigenous Australians; Briggs is a Yorta Yorta man and Trials is Ngarrindjeri.[1] Their music is overtly political and has been described as "angry, polemical, brutally frank and meant to inspire a response, good or bad".[2]

A.B. Original's single "January 26" (featuring Dan Sultan), released in August 2016, which comments on the use of that date for Australia Day.[3] This was followed up by an album entitled _Reclaim Australia_ in November.[4] The provocatively titled[5][6] album features many guests including Thelma Plum, G. Yunupingu and Archie Roach.[7]

At the 2017 AIR independent Music Awards, the duo won five awards; Breakthrough Independent Artist of the Year, Best Independent Hip Hop Album, Best Independent Single, Best Independent Artist and Best Independent Album or EP.[8] At the APRA Music Awards of 2018 the duo won Songwriter of the Year.[9]
