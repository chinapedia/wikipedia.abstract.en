_FLOOD PLAIN_ is a 1986 painting by the American artist Andrew Wyeth. It depicts a part of the artist's family's land in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania in the winter, with patches of ice in the grass. In the foreground is a pile of hay with the remnants of an old hay wagon. Two icy wheel tracks lead to a mill and a granary in the background.


Creation

In his 1995 autobiography, Wyeth said about this painting that he "wanted to capture the clean-swept character of the beginning of the winter after the floods".[1]


Provenance

The painting was acquired by the art dealer Frank E. Fowler and sold to the actor Charlton Heston in 1988.[2] Heston was a friend and promoter of Wyeth and owned several of his paintings. In 1991 he received Wyeth's study for _Flood Plain_ as a Christmas gift from the artist.[3]

The painting was sold through Sotheby's in 2015 for 5,178,000 US dollars. The estimated value at the auction was 2,000,000â€”3,000,000 US dollars.[4]
