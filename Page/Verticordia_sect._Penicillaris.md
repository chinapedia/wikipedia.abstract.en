_VERTICORDIA_ SECT. _PENICILLARIS_ is one of eleven sections in the subgenus _Verticordia_. It includes two species of plants in the genus _Verticordia_. Plants in this section are small, rounded shrubs with tiny leaves and sticky flowers. Like those in section _Micrantha_, the plants often smell faintly of mice.[1] When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991 he formally described this section, publishing the description in the journal Nuytsia.[2][3] The name _Penicillaris_ is from the type species from this section.[4]

The type species for this section is _Verticordia penicillaris_ and the other species is _V. dasystylis_.[5]
