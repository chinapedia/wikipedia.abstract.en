METALLICA is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles, California, by drummer Lars Ulrich and vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield, and has been based in San Francisco, California for most of its career.[1][2] The group's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who went on to form Megadeth) and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.

Metallica earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first five albums.[3] The band's third album, _Master of Puppets_ (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums; its eponymous fifth album, _Metallica_ (1991), the band's first to root predominantly in heavy metal, appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, the band returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of its ninth album, _Death Magnetic_ (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums.

In 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster, in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent; after reaching a settlement, Napster became a pay-to-use service in 2003. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film _Some Kind of Monster_, which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album, _St. Anger_ (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band wrote the screenplay for and starred in the 2013 IMAX concert film _Metallica: Through the Never_, in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.

Metallica has released ten studio albums, four live albums, a cover album, five extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos. The band has won nine Grammy Awards from 23 nominations, and its last six studio albums (beginning with _Metallica_) have consecutively debuted at number one on the _Billboard_ 200. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 125 million albums worldwide as of 2018.[4] Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines such as _Rolling Stone_, which ranked them at no. 61 on its _100 Greatest Artists of All Time_ list.[5] As of 2017, Metallica is the third best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991,[6] selling a total of 58 million albums in the United States.[7]


History

Formation and early years (1981–1982)

Metallica_wordmark.svg

Metallica was formed in Los Angeles, California, in late 1981 when Danish-born drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper, _The Recycler_, which read, "Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden."[8] Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album, _Metal Massacre_. Slagel accepted, and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar.[9] The band was officially formed on October 28, 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met.[10][11]

The bandname came from Ulrich's friend Ron Quintana, who was brainstorming names for a fanzine and was considering _MetalMania_ or _Metallica_. After hearing the two names, Ulrich wanted Metallica for his band, so he suggested Quintana use MetalMania instead.[12] Dave Mustaine replied to an advertisement for a lead guitarist; Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him after seeing his expensive guitar equipment. In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first original song, "Hit the Lights", for the _Metal Massacre I_ compilation. Hetfield played bass, rhythm guitar and sang while Lloyd Grant was credited with a guitar solo and Lars Ulrich played drums.[13] _Metal Massacre I_ was released on June 14, 1982; early pressings listed the band incorrectly as "Mettallica", angering the band.[14] The song generated word of mouth and the band played its first live performance on March 14, 1982, at Radio City in Anaheim, California, with newly recruited bassist Ron McGovney.[15] Their first live success came early; they were chosen to open for British heavy metal band Saxon at one gig of their 1982 US tour. This was Metallica's second gig. Metallica recorded its first demo, _Power Metal_, whose name was inspired by Quintana's early business cards in early 1982.

The term "thrash metal" was coined in February 1984 by _Kerrang!_ journalist Malcolm Dome in reference to Anthrax's song "Metal Thrashing Mad".[16] Prior to this, Hetfield referred to Metallica's sound as "power metal". In late 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the West Hollywood nightclub Whisky a Go Go, which featured bassist Cliff Burton in the band Trauma. The two were "blown away" by Burton's use of a wah-wah pedal and asked him to join Metallica. Hetfield and Mustaine wanted McGovney to leave because they thought he "didn't contribute anything, he just followed".[17] Although Burton initially declined the offer, by the end of the year, he had accepted on the condition the band move to El Cerrito in the San Francisco Bay Area.[18] Metallica's first live performance with Burton was at the nightclub The Stone in March 1983, and the first recording to feature Burton was the _Megaforce_ demo (1983).[19]

Metallica was ready to record their debut album, but when Metal Blade was unable to cover the cost, they began looking for other options. Concert promoter Johny "Z" Zazula, who had heard the demo _No Life 'til Leather_ (1982), offered to broker a record deal between Metallica and New York City-based record labels. After those record labels showed no interest, Zazula borrowed enough money to cover the recording budget and signed Metallica to his own label, Megaforce Records.[20]

_Kill 'Em All_ and _Ride the Lightning_ (1983–1985)

In May 1983, Metallica traveled to Rochester, New York to record its debut album, _Metal Up Your Ass_, which was produced by Paul Curcio.[21] The other members decided to eject Mustaine from the band because of his drug and alcohol abuse, and violent behavior just before the recording sessions on April 11, 1983.[22] Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett replaced Mustaine the same afternoon.[23]

Priest_feast_22_-_megadeth_05.jpg after being released from the band in 1983.]] Mustaine, who went on to form Megadeth, has expressed his dislike for Hammett in interviews, saying Hammett "stole" his job.[24] Mustaine was "pissed off" because he believes Hammett became popular by playing guitar leads that Mustaine himself had written.[25] In a 1985 interview with _Metal Forces_, Mustaine said, "it's real funny how Kirk Hammett ripped off every lead break I'd played on that _No Life 'til Leather_ tape and got voted No. 1 guitarist in your magazine".[26] On Megadeth's debut album _Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!_ (1985), Mustaine included the song "Mechanix", which Metallica had previously reworked and retitled "The Four Horsemen" on _Kill 'Em All_. Mustaine said he did this to "straighten Metallica up" because Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and said he could not play guitar.[27] Metallica's first live performance with Hammett was on April 16, 1983, at a nightclub in Dover, New Jersey called The Showplace;[28] the support act was Anthrax's original line-up, which included Dan Lilker and Neil Turbin.[29] This was the first time the two bands performed live together.[30]

Because of conflicts with its record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album titled _Metal Up Your Ass_, the album was renamed _Kill 'Em All_. It was released on Megaforce Records in the U.S. and on Music for Nations in Europe, and peaked at number 155 on the _Billboard_ 200 in 1986.[31] Although the album was not initially a financial success, it earned Metallica a growing fan base in the underground metal scene.[32] To support the release, Metallica embarked on the Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven.[33] In February 1984, Metallica supported Venom on the Seven Dates of Hell tour, during which the bands performed in front of 7,000 people at the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle, Netherlands.[34]

Metallica recorded its second studio album, _Ride the Lightning_, at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was released in August 1984 and reached number 100 on the _Billboard_ 200.[35] A French printing press mistakenly printed green covers for the album, which are now considered collectors' items. Mustaine received writing credit for "Ride the Lightning" and "The Call of Ktulu".[36]

Elektra Records A&R director Michael Alago, and co-founder of Q-Prime Management Cliff Burnstein, attended a Metallica concert in September 1984. They were impressed with the performance, signed Metallica to Elektra, and made the band a client of Q-Prime Management.[37] Metallica's growing success was such that the band's British label Music for Nations released _Creeping Death_ as a limited edition single, which sold 40,000 copies as an import in the U.S. Two of the three songs on the recordcover versions of Diamond Head's "Am I Evil?" and Blitzkrieg's "Blitzkrieg"appeared on the 1988 Elektra reissue of _Kill 'Em All_.[38] Metallica embarked on its first major European tour with Tank to an average crowd of 1,300. Returning to the U.S., it embarked upon a tour co-headlining with W.A.S.P. and supported by Armored Saint. Metallica played its largest show at the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park, England, on August 17, 1985, with Bon Jovi and Ratt, playing to 70,000 people. At a show in Oakland, California, at the Day on the Green festival, the band played to a crowd of 60,000.[39]

_Master of Puppets_ and Burton's death (1986–1987)

Metallica's third studio album, _Master of Puppets_, was recorded at Sweet Silence Studios and was released in March 1986. The album reached number 29 on the _Billboard_ 200 and spent 72 weeks on the chart.[40] It was the band's first album to be certified gold on November 4, 1986, and was certified six times platinum in 2003.[41] Steve Huey of AllMusic considered the album "the band's greatest achievement".[42] Following the release of the album, Metallica supported Ozzy Osbourne on a U.S. tour.[43] Hetfield broke his wrist while skateboarding; he continued with the tour, performing vocals, with guitar technician John Marshall playing rhythm guitar.[44]

On September 27, 1986, during the European leg of Metallica's Damage, Inc. Tour, members drew cards to determine which bunks on the tour bus they would sleep in. Burton won and chose to sleep in Hammett's bunk. At around sunrise near Dörarp, Sweden, the bus driver lost control and skidded, which caused the bus to overturn several times. Ulrich, Hammett, and Hetfield sustained no serious injuries; however, bassist Burton was pinned under the bus and died. Hetfield said:

  I saw the bus lying right on him. I saw his legs sticking out. I freaked. The bus driver, I recall, was trying to yank the blanket out from under him to use for other people. I just went, 'Don't fucking do that!' I already wanted to kill the [bus driver]. I don't know if he was drunk or if he hit some ice. All I knew was, he was driving and Cliff wasn't alive anymore.[45]

Jason_Curtis_Newsted.jpg Burton's death left Metallica's future in doubt. The three remaining members decided Burton would want them to carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings the band sought a replacement.[46] Roughly 40 people, including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus, Troy Gregory of Prong, and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam, auditioned for the band. Newsted learned Metallica's entire set list; after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; Newsted's first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi.[47]

After Newsted joined Metallica, the band left its El Cerrito practice spacea suburban house formerly rented by sound engineer Mark Whitaker dubbed "the Metalli-mansion"and relocated to the adjacent cities of Berkeley and Albany before eventually settling in the Marin County city of San Rafael, north of San Francisco.[48][49]

Metallica finished its tour in the early months of 1987. In March 1987, Hetfield again broke his wrist while skateboarding, forcing the band to cancel an appearance on _Saturday Night Live_. In August 1987, an all-covers extended play (EP) titled _The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited_ was released. The EP was recorded in an effort to use the band's newly constructed recording studio, test Newsted's talents, and to relieve grief and stress following the death of Burton. A video titled _Cliff 'Em All_ commemorating Burton's three years in Metallica was released in 1987; the video included bass solos, home videos, and pictures.[50]

_...And Justice for All_ and _Metallica_ (1988–1993)

Metallica's first studio album since Burton's death, _...And Justice for All_, was released in 1988. The album was a commercial success, reaching number six on the _Billboard_ 200, and was the band's first album to enter the top 10.[51] The album was certified platinum nine weeks after its release.[52] There were complaints about the production; Steve Huey of AllMusic said Ulrich's drums were clicking more than thudding, and the guitars "buzz thinly".[53] To promote the album, Metallica embarked on a tour called Damaged Justice.[54]

Metallica_Damaged_Justice_Tour.jpg tour in 1988]] In 1989, Metallica received its first Grammy Award nomination for _...And Justice for All_ in the new Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrument category. Metallica was the favorite to win but the award was given to Jethro Tull for the album _Crest of a Knave_.[55] The award was controversial with fans and the press; Metallica was standing off-stage waiting to receive the award after performing the song "One". Jethro Tull had been advised by its manager not to attend the ceremony because he was expecting Metallica to win.[56] The award was named in _Entertainment Weekly_{{'s}} "Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets".[57]

Following the release of _...And Justice for All_, Metallica released its debut music video for the song "One", which the band performed in an abandoned warehouse. The footage was remixed with the film _Johnny Got His Gun_. Rather than organize an ongoing licensing deal, Metallica purchased the rights to the film. The remixed video was submitted to MTV with an alternative, performance-only version that was held back in case MTV banned the remixed version. MTV accepted the remixed version; the video was viewers' first exposure to Metallica. In 1999, it was voted number 38 in MTV's "Top 100 Videos of All Time" countdown;[58] it was featured in the network's 25th Anniversary edition of _ADD Video_, which showcased the most popular videos on MTV in the last 25 years.[59]

In October 1990, Metallica entered One on One Recording's studio in North Hollywood to record its next album. Bob Rock, who had worked with Aerosmith, The Cult, Bon Jovi, and Mötley Crüe, was hired as the producer. _Metallica_also known as _The Black Album_was remixed three times, cost , and ended three marriages.[60] Although the release was delayed until 1991, _Metallica_ debuted at number one in ten countries, selling 650,000 units in the U.S. during its first week.[61] The album brought Metallica mainstream attention; it has been certified 16 times platinum in the U.S., which makes it the 25th-best-selling album in the country.[62] The making of _Metallica_ and the following tour was documented in _A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica_. The tour in support of the album, called the Wherever We May Roam Tour, lasted 14 months and included dates in the U.S., Japan, and the UK.[63] In April 1992, Metallica appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and performed a three-song set.[64] Hetfield later performed "Stone Cold Crazy" with the remaining members of Queen and Tony Iommi.[65]

On August 8, 1992, during the co-headlining Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour, Hetfield suffered second and third degree burns to his arms, face, hands, and legs. There had been some confusion with the new pyrotechnics setup, which resulted in Hetfield walking into a flame during "Fade to Black". Newsted said Hetfield's skin was "bubbling like on _The Toxic Avenger_".[66] Metallica returned to the stage 17 days later with guitar technician and Metal Church member John Marshall replacing Hetfield on guitar for the remainder of the tour, although Hetfield was able to sing. Later in 1993, Metallica went on the Nowhere Else to Roam Tour, playing five shows in Mexico City. _Live Shit: Binge & Purge_, the band's first box set, was released in November 1993. The collection contained three live CDs, three home videos, and a book filled with riders and letters.[67]

_Load_, _Reload_, _Garage Inc._ and _S&M_ (1994–1999)

After almost three years of touring to promote _Metallica_, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of _Load_ in 1996. _Load_ debuted at number one on the _Billboard_ 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album.[68] The cover art, _Blood and Semen III_, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass.[69] The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996.[70][71]

James_Hetfield_-_Cardiff_1996.jpg'' tour in 1996]] During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled _Reload_. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine.[72] _Reload_ debuted at number one on the _Billboard_ 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart.[73] Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film _Some Kind of Monster_ that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were "polished and reworked" until judged releasable.[74] To promote _Reload_, Metallica performed "Fuel" and "The Memory Remains" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's _Saturday Night Live_ in December 1997.[75]

In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, _Garage Inc._ The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy, Mercyful Fate, Black Sabbath, and others. The second disc featured the original version of _The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited_, which had become a scarce collectors' item. The album entered the _Billboard_ 200 at number two.[76][77]

On April 21 and 22, 1999, Metallica recorded two performances with the San Francisco Symphony conducted by Michael Kamen, who had previously worked with producer Rock on "Nothing Else Matters". Kamen approached Metallica in 1991 with the idea of pairing the band's music with a symphony orchestra. Kamen and his staff of over 100 composed additional orchestral material for Metallica songs. Metallica wrote two new Kamen-scored songs for the event, "No Leaf Clover" and "-Human". The audio recording and concert footage were released in 1999 as the album and concert film _S&M_. It entered the _Billboard_ 200 at number two and the Australian ARIA charts and Top Internet Albums chart at number one.[78]

Napster controversy, Newsted's departure and _St. Anger_ (2000–2005)

In 2000, Metallica discovered that a demo of its song "I Disappear", which was supposed to be released in combination with the _Mission: Impossible II_ soundtrack, was receiving radio airplay. Tracing the source of the leak, the band found the file on the Napster peer-to-peer file-sharing network, and also found that the band's entire catalogue was freely available.[79] Legal action was initiated against Napster; Metallica filed a lawsuit at the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, alleging that Napster violated three areas of the law: copyright infringement, unlawful use of digital audio interface device, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).[80]

Lars_Mexico_2012.jpg for Metallica.]] Ulrich provided a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding copyright infringement on July 11, 2000.[81] Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site to place a filter on the program within 72 hours or be shut down.[82] A settlement between Metallica and Napster was reached when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann BMG showed interest in purchasing the rights to Napster for $94 million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do not want their music shared.[83] On June 3, 2002, Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale of Napster to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.[84]

At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Ulrich appeared with host Marlon Wayans in a skit that criticized the idea of using Napster to share music. Marlon played a college student listening to Metallica's "I Disappear". Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation. Ulrich responded to Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just "sharing" by saying that Wayans' idea of sharing was "borrowing things that were not yours without asking". He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost naked in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt, saying, "I borrowed this shirt from a friend. Maybe, if I like it, I'll buy one of my own." Ulrich was later booed on stage at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink-182.[85][86]

Newsted left Metallica on January 17, 2001, as plans were being made to enter the recording studio. He said he left the band for "private and personal reasons, and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love".[87] During a _Playboy_ interview with Metallica, Newsted said he wanted to release an album with his side project, Echobrain. Hetfield was opposed to the idea and said, "When someone does a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica", and that a side project is "like cheating on your wife in a way".[88] Newsted said Hetfield had recorded vocals for a song used in the film _South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut_, and appeared on two Corrosion of Conformity albums. Hetfield replied, "My name isn't on those records. And I'm not out trying to sell them", and raised questions such as, "Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band?"[89]

Robert_Trujillo_live_in_London_2008-09-15.jpg''.]] In April 2001, filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky began following Metallica to document the recording process of the band's next studio album. Over two years they recorded more than 1,000 hours of footage. On July 19, 2001, before preparations to enter the recording studio, Hetfield entered rehab to treat his "alcoholism and other addictions". All recording plans were put on hold and the band's future was in doubt.[90] Hetfield left rehab on December 4, 2001,[91] and the band returned to the recording studio on April 12, 2002. Hetfield was required to limit his work to four hours a day between noon and 4 pm, and to spend the rest of his time with his family.[92] The footage recorded by Berlinger and Sinofsky was compiled into the documentary _Some Kind of Monster_, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004. In the documentary, Newsted said his former bandmates' decision to hire a therapist to help solve their problems which he felt they could have solved on their own was "really fucking lame and weak".[93]

For the duration of the recording period, producer Bob Rock played bass on the album and in several live shows at which Metallica performed during that time.[94] Once the record was completed in early 2003, the band started to hold auditions for Newsted's permanent replacement. Bassists Pepper Keenan, Jeordie White, Scott Reeder, Eric Avery, Danny Lohner, and Chris Wyseamong othersauditioned for the role. After three months of auditions, Robert Trujillo, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne's band, was chosen as the new bassist.[95] As Metallica moved on, Newsted joined Canadian thrash metal band Voivod in 2002, and was Trujillo's replacement in Osbourne's band during the 2003 Ozzfest tour, which included Voivod.[96]

Metallica_46.jpg in 2004]] In June 2003, Metallica's eighth studio album, _St. Anger_, debuted at number one on the _Billboard_ 200, and drew mixed reactions from critics. Ulrich's "steely" sounding snare drum and the absence of guitar solos received particular criticism.[97] Kevin Forest Moreau of _Shakingthrough.net_ said, "the guitars stumble in a monotone of mid-level, processed rattle; the drums don't propel as much as struggle to disguise an all-too-turgid pace; and the rage is both unfocused and leavened with too much narcissistic navel-gazing".[98] Brent DiCrescenzo of _Pitchfork_ described it as "an utter mess".[99] However, _Blender_ magazine called it the "grimiest and grimmest of the band's Bob Rock productions", and _New York Magazine_ called it "utterly raw and rocking".[100] The title track, "St. Anger", won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2004; it was used as the official theme song for WWE's _SummerSlam 2003_.[101]

Before the band's set at the 2004 Download Festival, Ulrich was rushed to the hospital after having an anxiety seizure and was unable to perform.[102] Hetfield searched for last-minute volunteers to replace Ulrich. Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo and Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison volunteered. Lombardo performed "Battery" and "The Four Horsemen", Ulrich's drum technician Flemming Larsen performed "Fade to Black", and Jordison performed the remainder of the set.[103] Having toured for two years in support of _St. Anger_ on the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003 and the Madly in Anger with the World Tour, with multi-platinum rock band Godsmack in support, Metallica took a break from performing and spent most of 2005 with friends and family. The band opened for The Rolling Stones at SBC Park in San Francisco on November 13 and 15, 2005.[104]

_Death Magnetic_, _Lulu_ and _Beyond Magnetic_ (2006–2011)

In December 2006, Metallica released a DVD titled _The Videos 1989–2004_, which sold 28,000 copies in its first week and entered the _Billboard_ Top Videos chart at number three.[105] Metallica recorded a guitar-based interpretation of Ennio Morricone's "The Ecstasy of Gold" for a tribute album titled _We All Love Ennio Morricone_, which was released in February 2007. The track received a Grammy nomination at the 50th Grammy Awards for the category "Best Rock Instrumental Performance".[106] A recording of "The Ecstasy of Gold" has been played to introduce Metallica's performances since the 1980s.[107] Earlier that year, Metallica announced on its official website that after 15 years, long-time producer Bob Rock would not be producing the band's next studio album. Instead, the band chose to work with producer Rick Rubin.[108] Metallica scheduled the release of _Death Magnetic_ as September 12, 2008, and the band filmed a music video for the album's first single, "The Day That Never Comes".

Metallica_London_2008-09-15_Kirk_and_James.jpg in 2008]] On September 2, 2008, a record store in France began selling copies of _Death Magnetic_ nearly two weeks before its scheduled worldwide release date,[109] which resulted in the album being made available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band's UK distributor Vertigo Records to officially release the album on September 10, 2008. Rumors of Metallica or Warner Bros. taking legal action against the French retailer were unconfirmed, though drummer Lars Ulrich responded to the leak by saying, "...We're ten days from release. I mean, from here, we're golden. If this thing leaks all over the world today or tomorrow, happy days. Happy days. Trust me",[110] and, "By 2008 standards, that's a victory. If you'd told me six months ago that our record wouldn't leak until 10 days out, I would have signed up for that."[111]

_Death Magnetic_ debuted at number one in the U.S. selling 490,000 units; Metallica became the first band to have five consecutive studio albums debut at number one in the history of the _Billboard_ 200.[112] A week after its release, _Death Magnetic_ remained at number one on the _Billboard_ 200 and the European album chart; it also became the fastest selling album of 2008 in Australia.[113]

_Death Magnetic_ remained at number one on the _Billboard_ 200 album chart for three consecutive weeks. Metallica was one of two artists whose albumthe other being Jack Johnson's album _Sleep Through the Static_remained on the _Billboard_ 200 for three consecutive weeks at number one in 2008. _Death Magnetic_ also remained at number one on _Billboard_'s Hard Rock, Modern Rock/Alternative and Rock album charts for five consecutive weeks. The album reached number one in 32 countries outside the U.S., including the UK, Canada, and Australia.[114][115] In November 2008, Metallica's record deal with Warner Bros. ended and the band considered releasing its next album through the internet.[116][117]

Although he was not to be inducted with them, Metallica invited Dave Mustaine to take part in the induction ceremony. Mustaine declined because of his touring commitments in Europe.[122]

In a June 2009 interview with Italy's Rock TV, Ulrich said Metallica was planning to continue touring until August 2010, and that there were no plans for a tenth album. He said he was sure the band would collaborate with producer Rick Rubin again.[129] According to Blabbermouth.net, the band was considering recording its next album in the second half of 2011.[130] In November 2010, during an interview with The Pulse of Radio, Ulrich said Metallica would return to writing in 2011. Ulrich said, "There's a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, but I think the main one is we really want to get back to writing again. We haven't really written since, what, '06, '07, and we want to get back to kind of just being creative again. Right now we are going to just chill out and then probably start up again in, I'd say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap back on and start writing some songs."[131]

In an interview at the April 2011 Big Four concert, Robert Trujillo said Metallica will work with Rick Rubin again as producer for the new album and were "really excited to write some new music. There's no shortage of riffage in Metallica world right now." He added, "The first album with Rick was also the first album for me, so in a lot of ways, you're kind of testing the water. Now that we're comfortable with Rick and his incredible engineer, Greg Fidelman, who worked with Slayer, actually, on this last recordit's my heroit's a great team. And it's only gonna better; I really believe that. So I'm super-excited."[132] In June 2011, Rubin said Metallica had begun writing its new album.[133] On November 9, 2010, Metallica announced it would be headlining the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro on September 25, 2011.[134][135]

On June 15, 2011, Metallica announced that recording sessions with singer-songwriter Lou Reed had concluded. The album, which was titled _Lulu_, was recorded over several months and comprised ten songs[143] based on Frank Wedekind's "Lulu" plays _Earth Spirit_ and _Pandora's Box_.[144] The album was released on October 31, 2011. The recording of the album was problematic at times; Lars Ulrich later said Lou Reed challenged him to a "street fight".[145] On October 16, 2011, Robert Trujillo confirmed that the band was back in the studio and writing new material. He said, "The writing process for the new Metallica album has begun. We've been in the studio with Rick Rubin, working on a couple of things, and we're going to be recording during the most of next year."[146]

Metallica also confirmed that it would headline the festival on both days and would perform two of its most critically acclaimed albums in their entirety: _The Black Album_ on one night, and _Ride the Lightning_ on the other.[158] In a July 2012 interview with Canadian radio station 99.3 The Fox, Ulrich said Metallica would not release its new album until at least early 2014.[159] In November 2012, Metallica left Warner Bros. Records and launched an independent record label, Blackened Recordings, which will produce the band's future releases.[160][161] The band has acquired the rights to all of its studio albums, which will be reissued through the new label.

In an interview with _Classic Rock_ on January 8, 2013, Ulrich said regarding the band's upcoming album, "What we're doing now certainly sounds like a continuation [of _Death Magnetic_]". He also said, "I love Rick [Rubin]. We all love Rick. We're in touch with Rick constantly. We'll see where it goes. It would stun me if the record came out in 2013."[166] Also in 2013, the band starred in a 3D concert film titled _Metallica: Through the Never_, which was directed by Antal Nimród and was released in IMAX theaters on September 27.[167] In an interview dated July 22, 2013, Ulrich told _Ultimate Guitar_, "2014 will be all about making a new Metallica record"; he said the album will most likely be released during 2015.[168] Kirk Hammett and Robert Trujillo later confirmed the band's intention to enter the studio.[169] At the second Orion Music + More festival held in Detroit, the band played under the name "Dehaan"a reference to actor Dane DeHaan, who starred in _Metallica: Through the Never_.[170] The band performed its debut album _Kill 'Em All_ in its entirety, celebrating the 30th anniversary of its release.[171] On December 8, 2013, the band played a show called "Freeze 'Em All" in Antarctica, becoming the first band to play on all seven continents.[172] The performance was filmed and released as a live album the same month.[173]

MetallicaO2241017-67_(37955260666).jpg In April 2016, during the week leading up to Record Store Day, for which the band was its ambassador for 2016, Ulrich told _Billboard_ that the band's expanded role within the music industry had played a part in the amount of time that it had taken to write and record the album. "The way we do things now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of _Kill 'Em All_ and _Ride the Lightning_. Nowadays we like to do so many different things." Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. "Unless something radical happens it would be difficult for me to believe that it won't come out in 2016".[188]

On August 18, 2016, the band announced via their website that their tenth studio album, _Hardwired... to Self-Destruct_, would be released worldwide on November 18, 2016, via their independent label, Blackened Recordings. They also unveiled the track listing, album artwork, and released a music video for the album's first single, "Hardwired".[189] The album was released as scheduled[190] and debuted at number one on the _Billboard_ 200.[191]

Upcoming eleventh studio album (2019–present)

In a March 2019 interview with Australia's The Music podcast, bassist Robert Trujillo stated that Metallica has begun "jamming" on new material for the band's eleventh studio album, which is to be released "a lot sooner than the previous two did." He also said, "We've all vowed to get this one going sooner than later. Now, how soon? I don't know. We've been touring non-stop. It's been over two years now. At some point, sure, we'll need to take a little bit of a break. It's sort of the right thing for us to do because we've been going so hard."[197]

In an interview with Australia's _Mixdown_ magazine in April 2019, guitarist Kirk Hammett mentioned tentative plans for Metallica to enter the studio after the conclusion of the WorldWired Tour in November. He stated, "We're in our third year since _Hardwired_. Maybe we can get a bit more focus and go into the studio a bit sooner. I have a ton of material. I've over-compensated, so I'm ready to go anytime."[198]


Style and lyrical themes

Metallica was influenced by early heavy metal and hard rock bands and artists Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Ted Nugent, AC/DC, Rush, Aerosmith, Judas Priest, Scorpions[199] and by new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) bands Venom, Motörhead, Saxon, Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, and Iron Maiden, and early punk rock bands Ramones, Sex Pistols, and the Misfits also influenced Metallica's style as did post-punk band Killing Joke.[200] The band's early releases contained fast tempos, harmonized leads, and nine-minute instrumental tracks. Steve Huey of AllMusic said _Ride the Lightning_ featured "extended, progressive epics; tight, concise groove-rockers".[201] Huey said Metallica expanded its compositional technique and range of expression to take on a more aggressive approach in following releases, and lyrics dealt with personal and socially conscious issues.[202] Religious and military leaders, rage, insanity, monsters, and drugsamong other themeswere explored on _Master of Puppets_.[203]

In 1991, Huey said Metallica with new producer Bob Rock simplified and streamlined its music for a more commercial approach to appeal to mainstream audiences.[204] Robert Palmer of _Rolling Stone_ said the band abandoned its aggressive, fast tempos to expand its music and expressive range.[205] The change in direction proved commercially successful; _Metallica_ was the band's first album to peak at number one on the _Billboard_ 200. Metallica noticed changes to the rock scene created by the grunge movement of the early 1990s. In _Load_—an album that has been described as having "an almost alternative rock" approach—the band changed musical direction and focused on non-metal influences.[206] Metallica's new lyrical approach moved away from drugs and monsters, and focused on anger, loss, and retribution. Some fans and critics were not pleased with this change, which included haircuts, the cover art of _Load_, and headlining the Lollapalooza festival of 1996.[207] David Fricke of _Rolling Stone_ described the move as "goodbye to the moldy stricture and dead-end Puritanism of no-frills thrash", and called _Load_ the heaviest record of 1996.[208] With the release of _ReLoad_ in 1997, the band displayed blues and early hard rock influences, incorporating more rhythm and harmony in song structures.[209]

_St. Anger_ marked another large change in the band's sound. Guitar solos were excluded from the album, leaving a "raw and unpolished sound".[210] The band used drop C tuning; Ulrich's snare drum received particular criticism. _New York Magazine_{{'}}s Ethan Brown said it "reverberates with a thwong". The album's lyrics deal with Hetfield's drug rehabilitation and include references to the devil, anti-drug themes, claustrophobia, impending doom, and religious hypocrisy.[211][212] At the advice of producer Rick Rubin, for its ninth studio album _Death Magnetic_, the band returned to standard tuning and guitar solos.[213] As a return to Metallica's thrash roots, _Death Magnetic_ was a riff-oriented album featuring intense guitar solos and subtle lyrics dealing with suicide and redemption.[214]


Legacy and influence

Metallica has become one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time, and is credited as one of the "big four" of thrash metal, along with Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth.[215] The band has sold more than 125 million records worldwide,[216] including an RIAA-certified 66 million and Nielsen SoundScan-reported 58,000,000 in the US, making Metallica one of the most commercially successful bands of all time.[217][218] The writers of _The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll_ said Metallica gave heavy metal "a much-needed charge".[219] Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Greg Prato of Allmusic said Metallica "expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions", and called the band "easily the best, most influential heavy metal band of the '80s, responsible for bringing the music back to Earth".[220]

Jonathan Davis of Korn said he respects Metallica as his favorite band; he said, "I love that they've done things their own way and they've persevered over the years and they're still relevant to this day. I think they're one of the greatest bands ever."[221] Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin said Metallica has been the biggest influence on the band, stating, "they really changed my life when I was 16 years oldI'd never heard anything that heavy".[222] Vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn of Machine Head said that when creating the band's 2007 album, _The Blackening_, "What we mean is an album that has the power, influence and epic grandeur of that album _Master of Puppets_and the staying powera timeless record like that".[223] Trivium guitarists Corey Beaulieu and Matt Heafy said that when they heard Metallica they wanted to start playing guitar.[224][225] M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold said touring with Metallica was the band's career highlight, and said, "Selling tons of records and playing huge shows will never compare to meeting your idols _Metallica_".[226] God Forbid guitarists Doc and Dallas Coyle were inspired by Metallica as they grew up, and the band's bassist John Outcalt admires Burton as a "rocker".[227] Ill Niño drummer Dave Chavarri said he finds early Metallica releases are "heavy, raw, rebellious. It said, 'fuck you'",[228] and Adema drummer Kris Kohls said the band is influenced by Metallica.[229]

On April 4, 2009, Metallica were inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. They entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame the second year they were eligible and first year they were nominated. Metallica's induction into the Hall included its current lineup, James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, Robert Trujillo, and Lars Ulrich, and former members Jason Newsted and Cliff Burton.[230]

_Kerrang!_ released a tribute album titled _Master of Puppets: Remastered_ with the April 8, 2006, edition of the magazine to celebrate the 20th anniversary of _Master of Puppets_. The album featured cover versions of Metallica songs by Machine Head, Bullet for My Valentine, Chimaira, Mastodon, Mendeed, and Triviumall of which are influenced by Metallica. At least 15 Metallica tribute albums have been released. On September 10, 2006, Metallica guest starred on _The Simpsons_{{'}} eighteenth-season premiere, "The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer".[241] Hammett's and Hetfield's voices were used in three episodes of the animated television series _Metalocalypse_.[242] Finnish cello metal band Apocalyptica released a tribute album titled _Plays Metallica by Four Cellos_, which features eight Metallica songs played on cellos. A parody band named Beatallica plays music using a combination of The Beatles and Metallica songs. Beatallica faced legal troubles when Sony, which owns The Beatles' catalog, issued a cease and desist order, claiming "substantial and irreparable injury" and ordering the group to pay damages. Ulrich, a fan of Beatallica, asked Metallica's lawyer Peter Paterno to help settle the case.[243]

On March 7, 1999, Metallica was inducted into the San Francisco Walk of Fame. The mayor of San Francisco, Willie Brown, proclaimed the day "Official Metallica Day".[244] The band was awarded the MTV Icon award in 2003, and a concert paying tribute to the band with artists performing its songs was held. Performances included Sum 41 and a medley of "For Whom the Bell Tolls", "Enter Sandman", and "Master of Puppets". Staind covered "Nothing Else Matters", Avril Lavigne played "Fuel", hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg performed "Sad but True", Korn played "One", and Limp Bizkit performed "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)".[245]

The album _Death Magnetic_ was later released as purchasable, downloadable content for the game. "Trapped Under Ice" was featured in the sequel, _Guitar Hero World Tour_. In 2009, Metallica collaborated with the game's developers to make _Guitar Hero: Metallica_, which included a number of Metallica's songs.
