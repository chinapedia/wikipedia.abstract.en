NGC 370 is a triple star located in the constellation Pisces. It was recorded on October 7, 1861 by Heinrich d'Arrest. It was described by Dreyer as "very faint, 13th magnitude star 15 arcsec to south, diffuse." However, there is nothing there. It is now presumed to be either a lost or "non-existent" object, although it is possible it could be a duplication of NGC 372.[1]
