In linguistics, FALSE FRIENDS are words in different languages that look or sound similar, but differ significantly in meaning. An example is the English _embarrassed_ and the Spanish _embarazada_ (which means _pregnant_), the word _parents_ and the Portuguese _parentes_ (which means _relatives_), or the word _sensible_, which means _reasonable_ in English, but _sensitive_ in French and Spanish.

The term originates from a book by French linguists describing the phenomenon, which was translated in 1928 and entitled, "false friend of a translator".

As well as producing completely false friends, the use of loanwords often results in the use of a word in a restricted context, which may then develop new meanings not found in the original language. For example, _angst_ means "fear" in a general sense (as well as "anxiety") in German, but when it was borrowed into English in the context of psychology, its meaning was restricted to a particular type of fear described as "a neurotic feeling of anxiety and depression".[1] Also, _gymnasium_ meant both 'a place of education' and 'a place for exercise' in Latin, but its meaning was restricted to the former in German and to the latter in English, making the expressions into false friends in those languages as well as in Greek, where it started out as 'a place for naked exercise'.[2]


Definition and origin

False friends, or bilingual homophones[3] are words in two or more languages that look or sound similar, but differ significantly in meaning.[4][5]

The origin of the term is as a shortened version of the expression "false friend of a translator", the English translation of a French expression () introduced by linguists Maxime Kœssler and Jules Derocquigny in their 1928 book,[6] _False Friends, or the Pitfalls of the English Vocabulary_ (_Les Faux Amis ou les trahisons du vocabulaire anglais_)[7] with a sequel, _Autres Mots anglais perfides_.


Causes

From the etymological point of view, false friends can be created in several ways.

Shared etymology

If language A borrowed a word from language B, or both borrowed the word from a third language or inherited it from a common ancestor, and later the word shifted in meaning or acquired additional meanings in at least one of these languages, a native speaker of one language will face a false friend when learning the other. Sometimes, presumably both senses were present in the common ancestor language, but the cognate words got different restricted senses in Language A and Language B.

_Actual_, which in English is usually a synonym of _real_, has a different meaning in other European languages, in which it means 'current' or 'up-to-date', and has the logical derivative as a verb, meaning 'to make current' or 'to update'. _Actualise_ (or 'actualize') in English means 'to make a reality of'.[8]

The word _friend_ itself has cognates in the other Germanic languages; but the Scandinavian ones (like Swedish _frände_, Danish _frænde_) predominantly mean 'relative'. The original Proto-Germanic word meant simply 'someone whom one cares for' and could therefore refer to both a friend and a relative, but lost various degrees of the 'friend' sense in Scandinavian languages, while it mostly lost the sense of 'relative' in English. (The plural _friends_ is still rarely used for "kinsfolk", as in the Scottish proverb _Friends agree best at a distance_, quoted in 1721.)

The Estonian and Finnish languages are closely related, which gives rise to false friends:[9]

  Estonian   Finnish    English
  ---------- ---------- ------------
  _lõuna_    _etelä_    south
  _edel_     _lounas_   south-west

Or Estonian _vaimu_ (spirit; ghost) and Finnish _vaimo_ (wife), ; or Estonian _huvitav_ (interesting) and Finnish _huvittava_ (amusing).[10]

A high level of lexical similarity exists between German and Dutch,[11] but shifts in meaning of words with a shared etymology have in some instances resulted in 'bi-directional false friends':[12][13]

  German   Dutch    English
  -------- -------- ---------
  _See_    _meer_   lake
  _Meer_   _zee_    sea

  German     Dutch          English
  ---------- -------------- ---------------
  _mögen_    _houden van_   like, love
  _dürfen_   _mogen_        be allowed to
  _wagen_    _durven_       dare

In Belgium, similarities between Dutch and French words often lead to confusion when several different meanings of the same word are mixed up and thus mistranslated. In satirical sketch comedy _Sois Belge et tais-toi!_, performed by Joël Riguelle in 2009, the following examples are given:[14]

+-----------+------------------------------------------+
| French    | Dutch                                    |
+===========+==========================================+
| _bureau_  | _bureau_ ("desk") or                     |
|           | _kantoor_ ("office")                     |
+-----------+------------------------------------------+
| _tasse_   | _kop_ ("teacup" or "head") or            |
|           | _tas_ ("teacup" or "bag")                |
+-----------+------------------------------------------+
| _sacoche_ | _sacoche_ or _handtas_ ("handbag") or    |
|           | _zak_ ("bag", "sack", "pouch", "pocket") |
+-----------+------------------------------------------+
| _poche_   | _zak_ ("bag", "sack", "pouch", "pocket") |
+-----------+------------------------------------------+

The Italian word _confetti_ (sugared almonds) has acquired a new meaning in English, French and Dutch; in Italian, the corresponding word is _coriandoli_.[15]

English and Spanish, both of which have borrowed from Greek and Latin, have multiple false friends.

English and Japanese also have diverse false friends, many of them being _wasei-eigo_ and _gairaigo_ words.[16]

Homonyms

In Swedish, the word _rolig_ means 'fun': _ett roligt skämt_ ("a funny joke"), while in the closely related languages Danish and Norwegian it means 'calm' (as in "he was calm despite all the commotion around him"). However, the Swedish original meaning of 'calm' is retained in some related words such as _ro_, 'calmness', and _orolig_, 'worrisome, anxious', literally 'un-calm'.[17] The Danish and Norwegian word _semester_ means term (as in school term), but the Swedish word _semester_ means holiday. The Danish word _frokost_ means lunch, the Norwegian word _frokost_ means breakfast.

Pseudo-anglicisms

Pseudo-anglicisms are new words formed from English morphemes independently from an analogous English construct and with a different intended meaning.[18]

Japanese is replete with pseudo-anglicisms, known as _wasei-eigo_ ("Japan-made English").


Semantic change

In bilingual situations, false friends often result in a semantic change—a real new meaning that is then commonly used in a language. For example, the Portuguese _humoroso_ ('capricious') changed its referent in American Portuguese to 'humorous', owing to the English surface-cognate _humorous._

_Corn_ was originally the dominant type of grain in a region (indeed _corn_ and _grain_ are themselves cognates from the same Indo-European root). It means usually cereals in general in the British Isles, but has come to mean exclusively maize in North America.

The American Italian _fattoria_ lost its original meaning 'farm' in favor of 'factory' owing to the phonetically similar surface-cognate English _factory_ (cf. Standard Italian _fabbrica_ 'factory'). Instead of the original _fattoria_, the phonetic adaptation American Italian _farma_ became the new signifier for 'farm' (Weinreich 1963: 49; see "one-to-one correlation between signifiers and referents").

This phenomenon is analyzed by Ghil'ad Zuckermann as "(incestuous) phono-semantic matching".[19]
