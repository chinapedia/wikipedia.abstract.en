"LAY MY LILY DOWN" is a song written by Bob Weir, Josh Kaufman and Josh Ritter. It is the third single from Weir's third solo album, _Blue Mountain_. The producers are Josh Kaufman and Daniel Goodwin.

On September 12, 2016, the song had its premiere on NPR's _World Cafe_ for streaming.

Weir wrote the song with Ritter and Kaufman, with lyrics in the voice of a father as he buries his daughter, over a mix of guitars.[1] Weir described the song as the "brainchild of Josh Kaufman", incorporating the folksong "Lay My Corey Down". Weir tried to make the song "banjo-oriented", using the clawhammer banjo technique for his guitar playing.[2]
