During his visit, he met with Mexican President Vicente Fox.[5] In February 2014, King Abdullah paid a second visit to Mexico and met with President Enrique Peña Nieto.[6] During the King's visit, memorandums were signed to increase cooperation in education and cultural exchanges; to increase technical and bilateral relations and to explore a free trade agreement.[7]

In July 2014, Mexican Foreign Minister José Antonio Meade paid a visit to Jordan and began negotiations on a free trade agreement with the country. During his visit, he announced that Mexico would open an embassy in the Jordanian capital.
