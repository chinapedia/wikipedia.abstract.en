The MARRIAGE ALLIANCE is an Australian lobby group based in Sydney, New South Wales which supports the definition of marriage between a man and a woman as found in the Marriage Amendment Act 2004 .[1] According to the group's website, it "is an independent alliance bringing together individuals and organisations supporting a common cause. We exist to voice the opinion of the silent majority of Australians that respect same-sex attracted people, but do not want to change the current definition of marriage."[2] They campaign against same-sex marriage.

In November 2018 the group rebranded as _Binary Australia_ with the stated aim to "carry on the fight for traditional values that celebrate the inherent differences between boys and girls, men and women".[3][4]


Campaigns

Marriage Alliance partnered with the Coalition for Marriage and other groups opposed to same-sex marriage, to campaign for a 'No' vote in the 2017 Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey.

They have conducted an extensive and controversial anti-gay marriage campaign in the media and on social media:

-   Ads initially accepted for broadcast by Channels 7 and 10, with management of those channels later deciding to not do so,[5] were subsequently, and controversially, broadcast by Foxtel.[6]
-   a 'rainbow noose' advert 'claiming that same-sex marriage will increase suicide because people who are against it will be bullied over their views if it becomes law'.[7]
-   a YouTube presentation 'It's not as simple as you think'.[8]
-   anti-Safe Schools pamphlets.[9]


Other activities

They have also

-   published articles attacking proponents of gay marriage, such as _Totalitarianism and the Hypocrisy of the Homosexual Agenda_.[10]
-   created an iOS and Android app to disseminate their material.[11][12][13]
