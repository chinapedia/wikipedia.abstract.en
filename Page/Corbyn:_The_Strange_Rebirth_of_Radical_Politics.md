_CORBYN: THE STRANGE REBIRTH OF RADICAL POLITICS_ is a 2016 book by Irish writer Richard Seymour, published by Verso Books. The book examines the political conditions which contributed to the rise of UK opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn during 2015 Labour leadership election, and attempts to predict the future of Corbyn, the Labour Party, and leftist politics in coming years.[1]


Synopsis

Seymour draws on Marxist and Gramscian theory to examine the broader political context surrounding Jeremy Corbyn's unlikely election as leader of the UK Labour Party in 2015.[2] The book recounts the events of the election as well as the organizing methods and media strategies developed by the Corbyn campaign. It explores the significance and challenges posed by his win for the future development of Labour, democratic politics, and broader left-wing movements, and sets Corbynism against the past political strategies of New Labour, Blairism, and establishment media channels.

_Corbyn_ was released in July 2016, coinciding with the announcement of the 2016 Labour leadership challenge.


Reception

The book received positive critical reception. Liam Young of the _New Statesman_ called it "the fullest and fairest account of Jeremy Corbyn’s rise released to date," adding that "It would be wrong to suggest that it is a positive, self-fulfilling account of Corbyn’s rise. In many ways it is a hard hitting and realistic look at what lies ahead."[3] Tom Mills of _Ceasefire_ called it "an analysis – and an astute one – of the socio-political conditions which have given rise to Corbynism, its future prospects and the substantial obstacles it will inevitably face."[4] Journalist Laurie Penny wrote that "Seymour is an essential voice on the left, and this book is a necessary intervention, explaining this daunting political moment and bringing the focus back to strategy."[5] Author Corey Robin wrote that "you'll find here the most sophisticated diagnosis of why men and women across the globe are turning to the left and why their aspirations are so continuously being frustrated."[6] Douglas Beat of _Camden Review_ wrote that "for anyone with an interest in Labour, inside the party or not, Seymour has written a serious, thoughtful, necessary and timely work."[7]
