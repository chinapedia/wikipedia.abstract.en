He was editor of DAIL Magazine during the 1990s, has worked as Diversity Officer at Arts Council England, was Associate Director at Graeae Theatre Company, is a Senior Associate at Diverse City and Director of The Big Lounge Collective which he co-founded in 2011.

Early/Personal Life

Beddard attended Thomas Delarue School[2] in Tonbridge, Kent, which, established by The National Spastics Society in 1955, was the first grammar school for disabled people. The Headmaster, Richard Tomlinson was a co-founder of Graeae Theatre Company,[3] where Beddard would later work as an actor, writer and director. Beddard was among the first disabled students to graduate from the University of Kent,[4] with a degree in Sociology. Not all of Beddard's family were in creative professions. His grandfathers were both sportsmen; one being a fencer in the London Olympics and the other a Cambridge Blue.[5] Beddard followed the Olympic tradition by directing 'Breathe/Battle of the Winds' for the Opening Ceremony (Sailing) of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games on Weymouth Beach.[6] Beddard lives in North London with his partner Jo and children Llewelyn and Willow.


Career

Beddard is an established artist who entered into the Disability arts world with no traditional performance training. In his own words, his career began "through a bizarre set of circumstances [when I] was jettisoned onto a film set, and a journey through the hinterlands of performance began."[7] According to Jonathan Meth in the Guardian, seeing Beddard on a poster for Graeae Theatre Company's production of Ubu inspired Daryl Beeton, former Artistic Director of Kazzum Theatre to enter the profession.[8]

Acting

Beddard has an extensive Acting career which include roles in Theatre, TV and Film.

Stage Work

Beddard's most recent appearance was in _The_ _Threepenny Opera_ (National Theatre) in 2016 which was heralded as "a brilliant move" in a review by The Telegraph, which awarded the show three stars.[14] Variety's review was equally mixed, though it praised Beddard's contribution: "Jamie Beddard, an actor with cerebral palsy, scor[es] with every punchline."[15] His performance was also picked up on in the _Financial Times:_ "Jamie Beddard plays the most astute of Macheath's lieutenants, largely from a wheelchair due to cerebral palsy, but makes every expletive ring through the Olivier."[16] Beddard's appearance in the production was mentioned by Vikki Heyward in _The Stage_ as indicative of "a new era of theatre, an era of acceptance and realisation that Deaf and disabled people should be – and can be – involved in a variety of shows"[17] Mark Shenton in his review of the show, also in _The Stage_ remarked: "It is also notable, because it’s so rare, to see a wheelchair-using actor, Jamie Beddard, among the ensemble."[18]

This came at a time when the National Theatre were starting to change its auditioning policy by responding to The Creative Case and opening its doors to disabled actors.[19] As Disability Arts Online's Editor, Colin Hambrook observed in a review of the show: "aside from Nabil Shaban, Beddard is the only other wheelchair-using actor to tread the boards of the National Theatre in a pivotal role."[20] Rufus Norris, Artistic Director at National Theatre who directed the production, has since reiterated his desire to work with Beddard again, telling _The Stage_: "Next time [I want to work with a disabled actor] I will think of Jamie, I won't think 'I need to find some disabled performers'".[21]

Prior to becoming Associate Director at Graeae Theatre Company, Beddard had a number of acting roles with the company. These include the title role in _Ubu_ (1994), and Christian in _Fittings_ (2000). Beddard's portrayal of Corbaccio in _Flesh Fly_ (1997) garnered commentary in literary criticism volumes about Ben Jonson's play. Marshall Botvinick described Graeae's production as 'possibly the most innovative staging [of the play] to date' and remarked: 'Jamie Beddard, an actor with cerebral palsy played the part of Corbaccio, making it much harder for an audience to laugh at Corbaccio's many ailments'.[22] Beddard's portrayal was also singled out in _Ben Jonson and Theatre: Performance, Practice and Theory_ for the way it confronted the prejudices of non-disabled audience members: 'it was less easy for the able-bodied members of the audience to laugh...though the disabled members of the audience found [Beddard's] performance uproarious, as if they had earned the right to laugh. Here that factionalising of the audience which Jonson frequently promotes came forcefully alive to one's awareness, causing one to question the grounds on which one might laugh.'[23]

Beddard played the role of Mathieu in Traverse Theatre's 2007 production, _15 Seconds_ which was awarded three stars by the Guardian, with Mark Fisher highlighting Beddard's performance: "[Mathieu] is played by Jamie Beddard with a great forlorn frown, dreamy eyes and a deadpan black humour that cleverly undercuts our expectations of the character and the actor's disability."[24]

His other theatre roles are

-   Estragon in _Waiting for Godot,_ Tottering Bipeds (1998)
-   The Dormouse in _Alice in Wonderland,_ Nottingham Playhouse (1998)
-   Voldov in _The Bound Man,_ Battersea Arts Centre (1999)
-   Francious in _The Fly,_ Manchester Royal Exchange (2003)
-   Quassimodo in _The Kings of Fools,_ DASH (2006)
-   Roger in _Natural Diversions,_ Natural Theatre Company (2013)

Beddard has performed in _Carrie's War_ twice, both times playing Mr Johnny at Apollo, Shaftsbury Avenue (2009), and for Novel Theatre (2011).[25] The former was awarded four stars by _The Telegraph_ with Beddard described as providing "fine support".[26]

TV and film

In the 1990s, Beddard played the lead Arthur in the BBC2 Screenplay _Skalligrigg_ (1994)[27][28] and Mike Bradley in _ID_ for BBC Films (1995). He starred as Terry in Poland Productions' _Trouble with Terry_ (1998) and played Gavin in BBC TV's production of _Common as Muck_ (1999).[29] In the same year Beddard played Rolandn Adams on the BBC made-for-TV film All the King's Men.[30]

In the 2000s, he played the leading role of Man, in Channel 4's production of _Access All Areas_ (2000), going on to play Nobby in Hartwood Films' _Wonderful You_ (2001) and a few years later played Gobber in _Quills_ for Carlton Films (2005).[31] He played Johnny for BBC Wales' production of _Carrie's War_ (2004),[32] with The Movie Scene praising the "great casting".[33] In 2002, Beddard played the leading role of Driver, this time for BBC1's _The Egg._[34][35]

He played Elvis for Beaconsfield Films' _The Outcasts_ and Jamie for Turtle Canyon's _Wheels,_ both in 2012.[36]

Beddard starred alongside Jason Williamson from the Sleaford Mods in the 2017 short film, _Lost Dog_, which _The Irish News_ described as "a tiny yet thought-provoking slice of life in 'austerity Britain'".[37]


Disability rights work

Beddard has been an outspoken advocate of rights for disability rights and for more disabled people to have roles within the creative industries. Beddard has commented "I aint broke, you don't need to fix me."[38] This came as part of his focus group response for the 'Re-framing Disability' Exhibition in 2011 which looked at judgements and portrayal of historical representations of disabled people with comparisons to today. In an interview in 2016 with Disability Arts Online Beddard remarked:

  "I’d like to see theatre become more inclusive. I love football and having relaxed performances makes theatre more like football. You should be able to go to theatre and engage with it. It is a scary time to be a disabled person, and so many of my contemporaries are desperately struggling, both, to work and survive. I feel a responsibility to the majority of disabled people who are finding life increasingly difficult, as Access to Work, the Independent Living Fund and care packages are savaged, and any gains we have made over last thirty years are consigned to history."[39]

Beddard has also been critical of non-disabled actors playing disabled roles, writing in 2009 article for the Guardian:

  "Unfortunately, some industry people still struggle with the idea that disabled actors may be best-placed to play disabled characters, and continue to represent disability through clouded prisms of metaphor and caricature. Non-disabled actors boost their red carpet prospects by offensively replicating impairments, as if physical appearance alone is shorthand for capturing the essence and character of a disabled protagonist. If he can imitate impairment, give him an Oscar."[40]
