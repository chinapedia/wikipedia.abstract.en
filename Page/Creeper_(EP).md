_CREEPER_ is the self-titled debut extended play (EP) by English horror punk band Creeper. Recorded at The Ranch Production House in Southampton with producer Neil Kennedy, it was originally released independently as a digital download on 19 June 2014, before it was later issued on limited edition 12" vinyl by Palm Reader Records on 8 December 2014. "Gloom" and "VCR" were released as music videos.

Written primarily by vocalist Will Gould and guitarist Ian Miles (with two tracks co-written by second guitarist Sina Nemati), Creeper's debut EP was recorded shortly after the band's formation in 2014. The EP received positive reviews from music critics, who praised it as a strong example of modern punk rock and a promising debut from the band, as well as comparing its sound to that of Alkaline Trio and AFI.


Background

After forming in early 2014, Creeper recorded their debut EP at The Ranch Production House in their hometown of Southampton with producer and engineer Neil Kennedy.[1] The EP was self-released by the band as a digital download on the website Bandcamp on 19 June 2014,[2] and was later made available for streaming on the _Kerrang!_ website in July.[3] Following its digital release, _Creeper_ was issued as a limited edition 12" vinyl on 8 December 2014 by Palm Reader Records limited to 300 copies – 100 on "Creeper Purple" vinyl and 200 on black vinyl.[4] The EP was written primarily by vocalist Will Gould and guitarist Ian Miles, with second guitarist Sina Nemati co-writing "We Had a Pact" and "Gloom".[5]

In promotion of the EP, a music video for "Gloom" was released on 3 September 2014.[6] The track was also included on the _Rock Sound_ compilation _Rock Sound 100% Volume #192_, released in October.[7] The first music video was followed in January 2015 by a video for "VCR", which was filmed "in the heart of [the] Leicestershire countryside".[8] Both videos were produced by the company Rolling Vision.[9][10] "VCR" was also later made available as a free download from the _Kerrang!_ website as part of the magazine's #KerrangFreshBlood feature.[11]

After making their live debut at the _Creeper_ EP release show on 1 August 2014 at the Joiners Arms in Southampton,[12] the band played their first live show in London on 13 September at The Old Blue Last.[13] They later supported Welsh band Funeral for a Friend on a UK tour in January 2015,[14] as well as opening for Gallows in May and playing at Download Festival in June.[15][16]


Critical reception

Media response to _Creeper_ was generally positive. Tom Connick of _DIY_ magazine described the EP as "perfectly executed punk rock", praising vocalist Will Gould's "impassioned accounts of love and loss" in his lyrics and the "soaring vocal harmonies and three-chord melodies" present on many of the songs, which he compared to the style of bands like Alkaline Trio and AFI.[17] _Rock Sound_ writer Chris Hidden described _Creeper_ as a "highly accomplished debut EP", describing the band's style as "a dark, slightly gothic twist on peppy punk rock" and also comparing them to Alkaline Trio.[18] Katie Clare of _Louder Than War_ remarked that the EP contained "five flawless tracks of dark hued pop punk".[19]
