[4]  Б: How did the gig go at Exit? Branko: We loved every single moment. It was a lot of fun, you know, to actually be part of the festival line up and have an opportunity to get up and there and play an hour long set; it was unreal, definitely a wish come true.

[5]  EP: What was it liked playing the EXIT Festival? Victor: They gave us a great opportunity. We had only released our debut EP ‘Love Is Like War’, which contained 5 songs, and they let us play in front of great bands like Gossip and the legendary Duran Duran. The most important thing was why they said they brought us to EXIT…The director said he really liked our sound; he probably thought we’d be a good warm up act before the headliners took to the stage.
