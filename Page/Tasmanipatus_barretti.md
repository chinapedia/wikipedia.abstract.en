The GIANT VELVET WORM (_Tasmanipatus barretti_) is a species of velvet worm in the Peripatopsidae family.[1]


Taxonomy

_Tasmanipatus barretti_ was described by Ruhberg et al. in 1991.. The generic name _Tasmanipatus_ refers to the species' distribution in Tasmania, Australia. The specific name _barretti_ refers to Australian naturalist Charles Leslie Barrett, who was sent a specimen from St Marys. Barrett is thought to have published the first record of the species, though he did not recognise it as a new species.[2]


Description

The dorsal surface is mauve with a darker median stripe. The ventral surface is creamy-white. There are 15 pairs of oncopods. Adults are typically 35–40 mm long, but may extend to 75 mm while walking.[3]
