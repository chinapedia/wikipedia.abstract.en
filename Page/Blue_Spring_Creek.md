BLUE SPRING CREEK is a stream in eastern Morgan County and western Miller County in the U.S. state of Missouri. It is a tributary of Little Gravois Creek.[1]

The stream headwaters arise about seven miles southwest of Eldon near Rocky Mount on Missouri Route Y at and it flows generally southeast to its confluence with Little Gravois at about three miles northwest of the community of Bagnell.[2] Springs including Blue Spring occur about midway along the stream course near the Missouri Route Z crossing.[3]

Blue Spring Creek is fed by a spring characterized by its blue water, hence the name.[4]
