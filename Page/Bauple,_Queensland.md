Geography

Sugarcane_workers_in_the_canefields_in_the_Bauple_District_Queensland_circa_1920.jpg Bauple is principally flat farming land (elevation 50 metres) with Mount Bauple rising to 450 metres in the west of the locality with some hills (elevation 150 metres) in the north-east. The town is located centrally within the locality. The Bruce Highway passes through the location from south to north, bypassing the town to the east. The town is now accessed Bauple Drive, the former route of the Bruce Highway before the town was bypassed.[4]

Sugarcane is the major crop in the area.[5]


History

The town was originally called _Raby_ but the name was changed to _Bauple_ on 20 November 1896, named after Mount Bauple. _Bauple_ is believed to be derived from an Aboriginal word _baupval_ in the Kabi language referring to a frilled lizard. In the Dreamtime, the spirit of the lizard guarded the sacred place on the mountain where stone axes were obtained.[6][7]

In 1858 bauple nuts were discovered in Bauple; they are now known as macadamia nuts.[8]

The Mount Bauple sugar mill was established in 1896; it was the largest in the district. It closed in 1951, as the sugarcane was then being sent to mills in Nambour and Maryborough.[9][10]

Raby State School opened on 8 July 1901 with 58 students. It was renamed Bauple State School on 16 May 1935.[11][12][13]
