Sambuca_1l.jpg

SAMBUCA () is an Italian anise-flavoured, usually colourless, liqueur. Its most common variety is often referred to as _white sambuca_ to differentiate it from other varieties that are deep blue in colour (_black sambuca_) or bright red (_red sambuca_).[1] Like other anise-flavoured liqueurs, the ouzo effect is sometimes observed when combined with water.


Ingredients

Sambuca is flavoured with essential oils obtained from star anise, or less commonly, green anise. Other spices such as elderflower, liquorice and others may be included, but are not required as per the legal definition. It is bottled at a minimum of 38% alcohol by volume.[2][3] The oils are added to pure alcohol, a concentrated solution of sugar, and other flavouring.


History

The _Oxford English Dictionary_ states that the term comes from the Latin word _sambucus_, meaning "elderberry".[4]

The Greek word _sambuca_ was first used as the name of another elderberry liquor that was created in Civitavecchia about 130 years ago.[5]

The first commercial version of such a drink started at the end of 1800 in Civitavecchia, where Luigi Manzi sold _Sambuca Manzi_. In 1945, soon after the end of Second World War, commendatore Angelo Molinari started producing _Sambuca Extra Molinari_, which helped popularise Sambuca throughout Italy.

Both having originated as anise-based spirits containing elderberry, Sambuca has some commonality with the Basque drink Patxaran.


Serving

Sambuca may be served neat. It may also be served on the rocks or with water, resulting in the ouzo effect from the anethole in the anise.

Sambuca is considered to go particularly well with coffee. Like other anise liqueurs, it may be drunk after coffee as a ammazzacaffè or added directly to coffee in place of sugar to produce a _caffè corretto_.[6]

A serving of sambuca can be a shot with seven coffee beans, representing the seven hills of Rome. Likewise, a shot with one coffee bean, called _con la mosca_, which means "with the fly", is as common. The traditional serving is with three coffee beans, each representing health, happiness and prosperity.[7][8] The shot may be ignited to toast the coffee beans with the flame extinguished immediately before drinking.[9]
