The OCETÁ PÁRAMO (Spanish: _Páramo de Ocetá_) is a páramo at altitudes between and in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes. It covers parts of the municipalities Monguí, Mongua and Tópaga, belonging to the Sugamuxi Province, Boyacá. The Ocetá Páramo is known for its collection of frailejones and other flora, as well as Andean fauna. Hiking tours from Monguí or Mongua to the páramo take a full day.

The Páramo de Ocetá in the times before the Spanish conquest of the Muisca was inhabited by the Muisca, loyal to the _iraca_ of Suamox, who considered the region sacred. Myths and legends exist from pre-Columbian and Spanish colonial times and in the lower part of the páramo the Muisca women gave birth in little man-made pools (_Tortolitas_).

The Ocetá Páramo is considered the most beautiful páramo in the world and one of the treasures of Colombia.


Description

The Ocetá Páramo is considered the most beautiful páramo in the world and one of the national treasures of Colombia.[1][2] It is located at from the Colombian capital Bogotá and from the departmental capital Tunja.[3] Colombia is the country with the most páramos in the world; more than 60% of the Andean ecosystem is found within Colombian territories.[4] Boyacá is the department where 18.3% of the national total area is located.[5]

Geography and climate

The Ocetá Páramo is situated in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes at altitudes between and .[6][7] The páramo with an area of lies east of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, southwest of the Pisba National Natural Park and north of Siscuinsí Lake.[8] Farther to the northeast are the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy and to the southwest Lake Tota. The climate varies between in winter nights and on sunny days.[9] Foggy blankets are common in the area.[10]

Páramos are "sponges"; sources of water for lower lying terrains and the Ocetá Páramo is no exception.[11] In the upper part of the páramo, marshes and small lakes exist. The biggest waterbody is the Laguna Negra and the Calicanto, Tejar and Morro Rivers as well as numerous creeks (_quebradas_) have their origin on the Páramo de Ocetá. The Penagos waterfall feeds the Laguna Negra.[12]

Geology

The Ocetá Páramo is part of the El Cocuy sub-basin, an inverted basin in the Eastern Ranges.[13] During the Hauterivian, the El Cocuy and Tablazo sub-basins formed a continuous basin due to the flooding of the Santander-Floresta paleohigh.[14] The main uplift in the Eastern Ranges occurred between the late Oligocene and Pleistocene, with increased tectonic uplift in the Plio-Pleistocene.[15] The Neogene compression led to the formation of alluvial fans in the intermontane valleys of the Eastern Cordillera. Pollen analysis has shown the transition from lowland tropical forests to colder mountainous vegetation over the last 5 million years.[16] The youngest uplifted eastern chain of the Colombian Andes formed the provenance area for the Magdalena River.[17] In the vicinity of the area of Ocetá, to the southwest in Iza and Paipa for the Eastern Cordillera unique volcanic and magmatic activity is noted from 4.7 to 2.1 Ma.[18]

The stratigraphical units encountered on the Ocetá Páramo are Paleocene sandstones and shales of the Socha Formation in the _Peña de Ortí_, and the Late Cretaceous Guadalupe sandstone and shale formations, Guaduas Formation, and the organic shales of the Chipaque Formation.[19] The Guaduas Formation contains coal seams that are mined in the area.[20] The Cretaceous-Paleocene Guaduas Formation is the most important source for the rich coal deposits in the Andean interior of Colombia.[21]

During the Miocene, establishing the current ecosystem in the Pliocene, the vegetation became that of a páramo.[22]

Flora

The typical flora of a páramo are frailejones, that are plants of the genus _Espeletia_. The lower altitude parts of the páramo are characterised by _Espeletia barclayana_, _Espeletia jaramilloi_, _Espeletia congestiflora_ and _Espeletia argentea_, while _Espeletia grandiflora_ is growing in a wider altitude distribution. _Chusquea tessellata_ is characteristic of the Eastern Ranges.[23] On the Ocetá Páramo, formerly written as Oseta, various species have been described by Thomas van der Hammen; _Bryum argenteum_, _Breutelia polygastrica_, _Calamagrostis effusa_, _Ceratodon stenocarpus_, _Didymodon laevigatus_, _Leptodontium flexifolium_ and _Sphagnum sancto-josephense_.[24][25][26][27][28][29] Other flora occurring on the páramo are _Pentacalia vernicosa_, _Ageratina tinifolia_, _Bidens andicola_, _Lupinus alopecuroides_, _Viola sp._, _Arnica sp._ and various types of mosses and lychen.[30][31][32]

Fauna

Among the fauna that can be observed on the páramo are Andean condor, black agouti, eastern cottontail, frogs, mountain paca, spectacled bear, white-tailed deer.[33] The spectacled bear is very rare and possibly extinct.[34] The white tailed deer, the main ingredient of the diet of the Muisca and pre-Muisca, has been extensively hunted and captured over time.[35]

History

The Páramo de Ocetá was a sacred place for the Muisca, who inhabited the Altiplano Cundiboyacense and surrounding areas before the Spanish conquest.[36] The region of Monguí was populated by the Sanoa tribe.[37]

Sights

Along the route from Monguí to the highest point of the Ocetá Páramo, a series of sights are present. From most of the route, to the (south)west, a view of the Duitama-Sogamoso Valley, especially the settlements of Tibasosa, Nobsa and Duitama, is visible. From the _Mirador de Cóndores_ and the _Cerro de Águilas_ on clear days it is possible to see the snowy peaks of the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy and even the Llanos Orientales.[38]

Tortolitas

The _Tortolitas_ (English: "Sweethearts") are oval-shaped depressions that were made by the Muisca. They served as "baths" where the Muisca women bore their babies. Close to the Tortolitas, Muisca petroglyphs have been found.[39]

Peña de Otí

The _Peña de Otí_ (English: "Rock of Otí") is an outcrop of alternating shales and sandstones of the Socha Formation.[40] It is observed to the southwest from the main trail leading to the _Mirador de los Cóndores_ on the páramo. The rocks of the _Peña de Otí_ were used to construct the churches and convent in Monguí. Legends about the Peña include tales of witches dancing with the devil on October 31, the origin of the scratches on the rock face from the devil who was riding a donkey on the hilltop and fell down, when the hoofs created the scratches and that the hill opened one day revealing the Calicanto Bridge and church made of gold. The end of the world would come when the hill closed again.[41]

Caja del Rey

The _Caja del Rey_ (English: "The King's Box") is a monolith of about high, wide and long. Legend says it is a box of rock with a lid on top where the _cacique_ Sanoha hid a fifteen-year-old girl inside, who during a night in April exited naked.[42] The monolith contains an upper part where a natural fractured zone has been excavated more by humans. The rock is also a viewpoint for the western area.[43]

Ciudad de Piedra

_Ciudad de Piedra_ or _Ciudad Perdida_ (English: "The Stone or Lost City"), not to be confused with its famous counterpart in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, is a series of rock formations of high, wide and long.[44][45][46] In the _Ciudad de Piedra_, a tabular stone, thought to have served for human sacrifices, called _Mesa de los Sacrificios_ is present.[47]

_El Pulpito del Diablo_ (English: "The Devil's Pulpit") is a raised mesa-type hill to the south of the main hiking trail on the Páramo de Ocetá.[48]

Playa de los Frailejones

The _Playa_ or _Valle de Frailejones_ or _Jardines de Ocetá_ (English: "Frailejon Beach or Valley" or "Ocetá Gardens") is a relatively flat portion on the páramo where a large quantity of frailejones are growing.[49][50] The frailejones grow a year.[51]

Cerro de Águilas

The _Cerro de Águilas_ (English: "Eagles Hill") is a hill on the páramo consisting of alternating shales and sandstone formations of the Guadalupe Group.[52]

Mirador de Cóndores

The _Mirador de Cóndores_ (English: "Condor Viewpoint") is the highest point of the páramo and offers a view on the Laguna Negra. Andean condors can be sighted from this viewpoint.

Laguna Negra

_Laguna Negra_ (English: "Black Lake") is a permanent lake on the páramo that can be viewed from the _Cerro de Águilas_ or the _Mirador de Cóndores_.[53] The lake drains towards Mongua and it is possible to reach from that village. Legend tells that a young boy is living in the lake, whose singing can be heard close to the Penagos waterfall.[54]


Tourism

The Ocetá Páramo is mostly accessed from Monguí along the _Camino de la Otra Vida_; a full-day hike, ascending and back descending , that takes between six and eleven hours.[55] A steep and pebbly access to the Ocetá Páramo is indicated with a gate called _Portal de la Gloria_. It is possible to access the páramo by horse and do wild camping on the páramo.[56] The use of a trained guide is recommended, as the journey contains many paths and the sudden mist can be cold and dangerous due to the loss of orientation.[57] The best months to visit the páramo are November and December.[58]

An alternative route towards the Ocetá Páramo starts in Mongua and reaches the Laguna Negra first.
