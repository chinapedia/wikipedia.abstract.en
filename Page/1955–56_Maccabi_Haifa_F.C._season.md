The 1955–56 MACCABI HAIFA SEASON was the club's 43rd season since its establishment in 1913, and 8th since the establishment of the State of Israel.

At the start of the season, the league which started during the previous season was completed, with the club finishing 6th. The new league season, with the top division being re-named Liga Leumit, began on 3 December 1955 and was completed on 3 June 1956, with the club finishing 5th.[1]

During the season, the club also competed in the State Cup, which was also carried over the summer break. The club eliminated city rivals Hapoel Haifa in the quarter finals, winning 4–0,[2][3] but was defeated by Maccabi Tel Aviv 0–5 in the semi-finals.[4]

On 15 September 1955 a new stadium, Kiryat Eliezer Stadium, officially called Haifa Municipal Stadium or Luigi Antonini Stadium,[5][6] was opened with a match between a Haifa XI and a Tel Aviv XI.[7] Maccabi Haifa started playing home matches in the stadium on 24 September 1955, starting with a match against Hapoel Haifa.[8]

State Cup

Shapira Cup

In October and November, while the promotion playoffs and the State Cup were being played, two cup competitions were organized by Liga Leumit Clubs, the second edition of the Shapira Cup, and the Netanya 25th Anniversary Cup. Maccabi Haifa, Hapoel Petah Tikva, Maccabi Tel Aviv and Hapoel Tel Aviv played for the Shapira Cup, named after former Hapoel Tel Aviv treasurer Yosef Shapira. The competition was designed to be played as a double round-robin tournament but the competition was delayed after the teams playing only two matches each, as the third round matches were postponed due to weather conditions and then due to the 1954–55 Israel State Cup final, which involved Maccabi Tel Aviv and Hapoel Petah Tikva. As league matches started on 3 December 1955, the competition was abandoned altogether.
