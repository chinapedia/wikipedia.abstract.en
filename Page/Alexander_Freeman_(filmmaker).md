Documentary Films


_The Last Taboo_ (2013)

Freeman's feature documentary _The Last Taboo_ (2013) about the sexual lives of people with disabilities,[16][17][18][19][20] which he wrote, produced and directed on a $1,575 crowdfunded budget while at Emerson College,[21] with a crew of 30 people whom all volunteered their time, gained Freeman worldwide attention. In an interview with WBUR, Freeman said "We might be in a chair, but everything still works. I’ve got a heart. I’ve got a mind, and I’ve got a body [...] Everyone deserves to be touched.[22] People need to have the attitude of ‘Hey, I may not have done it before but, yeah, let's give it a try.’"[23] Later in an interview with ABC News, he said "If we are denied our right to sensuality, we are denied being human."[24] In another interview, when asked about his message regarding sex and relationships with people with disabilities, he said, "I think more able-bodied people have to ask that question to themselves and be open to having relationships with people who might not line up with the guidelines that they have in their minds. It has nothing to do with the person's physical ability or challenges at all. The film won Best Screenplay at the 2013 BOSIFEST in Serbia and is now released on Vimeo On Demand. [25]


_The Wounds We Cannot See_ (2017)

Freeman's feature documentary _The Wounds We Cannot See_, tells the gripping story of former US Navy Airman Nancy Ross of Hingham, Massachusetts. Ross was violently raped during her service in 1988 and has since struggled with addiction, mental illness and depression. She continues to battle Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a direct result of her attack and subsequent abusive relationships. While Nancy has undergone extensive therapy since her honorable discharge from the Navy, she still suffers from addiction and mental illness, living in constant fear of the future. In an interview with Emerson College, Freeman said “What people have to remember about addiction and mental illness is that it is not something that you choose. It’s just part of you, and we need to open up the door and help people instead of pushing them away,” [26] Later in an interview with Jewish Boston, Freeman said "no one has to stay the way they were before. They can always get better if the help and acceptance is there.” [27] The film was made possible by a $7,000 grant that Freeman received as the Winner of The HSC Foundation's National 2014 Advocates in Disability Award and by his crew, who donated their time. The film was also made possible by support from the City of Mlawa in Poland, who sponsored Freeman's composer Miro Kepinski.[28] and was finished by Freeman's friend and former colorist Darin Wooldridge at Technicolor, where Freeman had interned in 2014. _The Wounds We Cannot See_ has won multiple awards and recognition at the following festivals and is now released on multiple platforms including Amazon Video,[29] Google Play,[30] YouTube Red[31] and is distributed by Indie Rights.
