JOE ALLEN is an American restaurant known as Broadway meeting place for working actors, theater staff and fans. The restaurant is located at 326 W 46th Street, New York, NY 10036. Opened in 1965 by a former actor of the same name.[1][2] Joe Allen is known for having its wall lined with posters of Broadway flops such as _Laughing Room Only_, _Moose Murders_, and _Dance of the Vampires_.[3] The restaurant featured in scenes in the films _No Way to Treat a Lady_ (1968) and Woody Allen's _Melinda and Melinda_ (2004).

A branch opened in the Les Halles district of Paris in 1972 [4] and UK branch in London's Covent Garden in 1977.[5][6]. In 2018 these are in different ownerships [7] but retain the name and, in the case of the London branch, the theatrical atmosphere at a venue 100 metres from its original location. [8]

An egalitarian place, Joe Allen is popular with kids in the chorus as well as with superstars like Elizabeth Taylor, who could usually be found dining on Joe Allen's famous chili after the curtain came down on her Broadway debut run in The Little Foxes in 1981."
