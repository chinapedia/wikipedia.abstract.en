Format

The _Oldsmobile Program_ featured "Ted Husing's sport talks" and music.[3]


Personnel

Ted Husing was the program's host. The _Encyclopedia of American Radio, 1920-1960, 2nd Edition_ says that Leon Belasco's orchestra provided the music, with contralto Barbara Mauel as soloist and the Hummingbirds as the vocal group.[4] The April 1933 issue of _Radio News_ indicates that George Olsen and his orchestra were the musicians for the program, with Ethel Shutta, Fran Frey and Richard Gardner singing and that Gus Van was "continuing the comedy and character songs which were identified with the Van and Schenck stage partnership of twenty years. [5]

In 1934, Husing continued as the host, with Ruth Etting as soloist, backed by Johnny Green and his orchestra.[6]
