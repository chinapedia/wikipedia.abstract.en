Reception

Though the film was well made with melodious music, it did not fare as well as expected. The reason may be that by this time, the interest in epic-based stories started waning among the viewers. Specially because it was only the same Jupiter Pictures that previously made _Velaikaari_, a socially themed story that was well received by the people.
