Early life

Kidman was born 20 June 1967, in Honolulu, Hawaii,[11] while her Australian parents were temporarily in the United States on student visas. Her mother, Janelle Ann (née Glenny), is a nursing instructor who edited her husband's books and was a member of the Women's Electoral Lobby. Her father was Antony Kidman (1938–2014), a biochemist, clinical psychologist and author, who died of a heart attack in Singapore aged 75.[12][13][14][15] Kidman's ancestry includes Irish and Scottish heritage.[16]

Being born in Hawaii, she was given the Hawaiian name "Hōkūlani", meaning "Heavenly Star". The inspiration came from a baby elephant born around the same time at the Honolulu Zoo.[17][18]

At the time of Kidman's birth, her father was a graduate student at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. He became a visiting fellow at the National Institute of Mental Health of the United States. Opposed to the war in Vietnam, Kidman's parents participated in anti-war protests while living in Washington, D.C.[19] The family returned to Australia when Kidman was four and her mother now lives on Sydney's North Shore. Kidman has a younger sister, Antonia Kidman, a journalist and TV presenter.[20]

Kidman grew up in Sydney and attended Lane Cove Public School and North Sydney Girls' High School. She was enrolled in ballet at three and showed her natural talent for acting in her primary and high school years.[21] She says that she was first inspired to become an actress upon seeing Margaret Hamilton's performance as the Wicked Witch of the West in _The Wizard of Oz_.[22] Kidman has revealed that she was timid as a child, saying, "I am very shy – really shy – I even had a stutter as a kid, which I slowly got over, but I still regress into that shyness. So I don't like walking into a crowded restaurant by myself; I don't like going to a party by myself."[23]

She initially studied at the Phillip Street Theatre in Sydney. At Philip Street, Kidman studied alongside Naomi Watts who had attended the same high school.[24] She also attended the Australian Theatre for Young People.[25] Here she took up drama, mime and performing in her teens, finding acting to be a refuge. Owing to her fair skin and naturally red hair, the Australian sun forced the young Kidman to rehearse in halls of the theatre. A regular at the Phillip Street Theatre, she received both encouragement and praise to pursue acting full-time.[26]


Career

Beginnings (1983–1994)

In 1983, aged 16, Kidman made her film debut in a remake of the Australian holiday season favourite _Bush Christmas_.[27] By the end of 1983, she had a supporting role in the television series _Five Mile Creek_. In 1984, her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, which caused Kidman to halt her acting work temporarily while she studied massage so she could help her mother with physical therapy.[28] She began gaining popularity in the mid-1980s after appearing in several film roles, including _BMX Bandits_ (1983), _Watch the Shadows Dance_ (1987 aka _Nightmaster_), and the romantic comedy _Windrider_ (1986), which earned Kidman attention due to her racy scenes. Also during the decade, she appeared in several Australian productions, including the soap opera _A Country Practice_[29] and the 1987 miniseries _Vietnam_.[30] She also made guest appearances on Australian television programs and TV movies.

In 1988, Kidman appeared in _Emerald City_, based on the play of the same name. The Australian film earned her an Australian Film Institute award for Best Supporting Actress. Kidman next starred with Sam Neill in _Dead Calm_ (1989) as Rae Ingram, playing the wife of a naval officer. The thriller brought Kidman to international recognition; _Variety_ commented: "Throughout the film, Kidman is excellent. She gives the character of Rae real tenacity and energy."[31] Meanwhile, critic Roger Ebert noted the excellent chemistry between the leads, stating, "Kidman and Zane do generate real, palpable hatred in their scenes together."[32] She followed that up with the Australian miniseries _Bangkok Hilton_. She next moved on to star alongside her then-boyfriend and future husband, Tom Cruise, in the 1990 auto racing film _Days of Thunder_, as a young doctor who falls in love with a NASCAR driver. It is Kidman's American debut and was among the highest-grossing films of the year.[33]

In 1991, she co-starred with Thandie Newton and former classmate Naomi Watts in the Australian independent film _Flirting_.[34] They portrayed high school girls in this coming of age story, which won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Film.[35] That same year, her work in the film _Billy Bathgate_ earned Kidman her first Golden Globe Award nomination, for Best Supporting Actress. _The New York Times_, in its film review, called her "a beauty with, it seems, a sense of humor".[36] The following year, she and Cruise re-teamed for Ron Howard's Irish epic _Far and Away_ (1992), which was a modest critical[37][38] and commercial[39] success. In 1993, she starred in the thriller _Malice_ opposite Alec Baldwin[40] and the drama _My Life_ opposite Michael Keaton.[41]

Worldwide recognition (1995–2003)

In 1995, Kidman played Dr. Chase Meridian, the damsel in distress, in the superhero film _Batman Forever_, opposite Val Kilmer as the film's title character. The same year, she starred in Gus Van Sant's critically acclaimed dark comedy _To Die For_, in which she played the murderous newcaster Suzanne Stone. Of Kidman's Golden Globe award-winning performance, Mick LaSalle of the _San Francisco Chronicle_ said "[she] brings to the role layers of meaning, intention and impulse. Telling her story in close-up – as she does throughout the film – Kidman lets you see the calculation, the wheels turning, the transparent efforts to charm that succeed in charming all the same."[42] Kidman next appeared, alongside Barbara Hershey and John Malkovich, in _The Portrait of a Lady_ (1996), based on the novel of the same name, and starred in _The Peacemaker_ (1997) as White House nuclear expert Dr. Julia Kelly, opposite George Clooney. The latter film grossed US$110 million worldwide.[43][44] Kidman starred in comedy _Practical Magic_ (1998) with Sandra Bullock as two witch sisters who face a curse which threatens to prevent them ever finding lasting love. While the film opened atop the chart on its North American opening weekend, it flopped at the box office.[45][46] She returned to her work on stage the same year in the David Hare play _The Blue Room_, which opened in London.[47]

premiere of _Moulin Rouge!_]] In 1999, Kidman reunited with then husband, Tom Cruise, to portray a Manhattan couple on a sexual odyssey, in _Eyes Wide Shut_, the final film of director Stanley Kubrick. It was subject to censorship controversies due to the explicit nature of its sex scenes.[48] After a brief hiatus and a highly publicized divorce from Cruise,[49] Kidman returned to the screen to play a mail-order bride in the British-American drama _Birthday Girl_.[50] In 2001, Kidman played the cabaret actress and courtesan Satine in Baz Luhrmann's musical _Moulin Rouge!_, opposite Ewan McGregor. Her performance and her singing received positive reviews; Paul Clinton of _CNN.com_ called it her best work since _To Die For_, and wrote "[she] is smoldering and stunning as Satine. She moves with total confidence throughout the film [...] Kidman seems to specialize in "ice queen" characters, but with Satine, she allows herself to thaw, just a bit."[51] Subsequently, Kidman received her second Golden Globe Award, for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, as well as many other acting awards and nominations. She also received her first Academy Award nomination, for Best Actress.

Kidman also starred in Alejandro Amenábar's horror film _The Others_ (2001), as Grace Stewart, a mother living in the Channel Islands during World War II who suspects her house is haunted. Grossing over US$210 million worldwide, the film also earned several Goya Awards award nominations, including a Best Actress nomination for Kidman. She received her second BAFTA[52] and fifth Golden Globe[53] nominations. Roger Ebert commented that "Alejandro Amenábar has the patience to create a languorous, dreamy atmosphere, and Nicole Kidman succeeds in convincing us that she is a normal person in a disturbing situation, and not just a standard-issue horror movie hysteric."[54] Kidman was named the World's Most Beautiful Person by _People_ magazine.[55]

In 2002, Kidman won critical praise for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in Stephen Daldry's _The Hours_, which stars Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. Kidman famously wore prosthetics that were applied to her nose making her almost unrecognisable playing the author during her time in 1920s England, and her bouts with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel, _Mrs. Dalloway_. The film earned positive notices and several nominations, including for an Academy Award for Best Picture. _The New York Times_ wrote that, "Ms. Kidman, in a performance of astounding bravery, evokes the savage inner war waged by a brilliant mind against a system of faulty wiring that transmits a searing, crazy static into her brain".[56] Kidman won numerous critics' awards, including her first BAFTA, third Golden Globe, and the Academy Award for Best Actress. As the first Australian actress to win an Academy Award, Kidman made a teary acceptance speech about the importance of art, even during times of war, saying, "Why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil? Because art is important. And because you believe in what you do and you want to honour that, and it is a tradition that needs to be upheld."[57]

Following her Oscar win, Kidman appeared in three very different films in 2003. The first, a leading role in _Dogville_, by Danish director Lars von Trier, was an experimental film set on a bare soundstage. Though the film divided critics in the United States, Kidman still earned praise for her performance. Peter Travers of _Rolling Stone_ magazine stated: "Kidman gives the most emotionally bruising performance of her career in Dogville, a movie that never met a cliche it didn't stomp on."[58] The second was an adaptation of Philip Roth's novel _The Human Stain_, opposite Anthony Hopkins. Her third film was Anthony Minghella's war drama _Cold Mountain_. Kidman appeared opposite Jude Law and Renée Zellweger, playing Southerner Ada Monroe, who is in love with Law's character and separated by the Civil War. _TIME_ magazine wrote, "Kidman takes strength from Ada's plight and grows steadily, literally luminous. Her sculptural pallor gives way to warm radiance in the firelight".[59] The film garnered several award nominations and wins for its actors; Kidman received her sixth Golden Globe nomination at the 61st Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress.[60]

Continued success (2004–2009)

In 2004 she appeared in the film _Birth_, which received controversy over a scene in which Kidman shares a bath with her co-star, 10-year-old Cameron Bright. At a press conference at the Venice Film Festival, Kidman addressed the controversy saying, "It wasn't that I wanted to make a film where I kiss a 10-year-old boy. I wanted to make a film where you understand love".[61] Kidman earned her seventh Golden Globe nomination, for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama. That same year, she appeared as a successful producer in the black comedy-science-fiction film _The Stepford Wives_, a remake of the 1975 film of the same name, directed by Frank Oz. In 2005, Kidman appeared opposite Sean Penn in the Sydney Pollack thriller _The Interpreter_, playing UN translator Silvia Broome, and with Will Ferrell in the romantic comedy _Bewitched_, based on the 1960s TV sitcom of the same name. While neither film fared well in the United States, both were international successes.[62][63] Kidman and Ferrell earned the Razzie Award for Worst Screen Couple.

In conjunction with her success in the film industry, Kidman became the face of the _Chanel No. 5_ perfume brand. She starred in a campaign of television and print ads with Rodrigo Santoro, directed by _Moulin Rouge!_ director Baz Luhrmann, to promote the fragrance during the holiday seasons of 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2008. The three-minute commercial produced for _Chanel No. 5_ made Kidman the record holder for the most money paid per minute to an actor after she reportedly earned US$12million for the three-minute advert.[64] During this time, Kidman was also listed as the 45th Most Powerful Celebrity on the 2005 _Forbes_ Celebrity 100 List. She made a reported US$14.5 million in 2004–2005.

She also starred in the fantasy-adventure, _The Golden Compass_ (2007), playing the villainous Marisa Coulter.

In 2008, she reunited with _Moulin Rouge!_ director Baz Luhrmann in the Australian period film _Australia_, set in the remote Northern Territory during the Japanese attack on Darwin during World War II.

Richard Roeper of _The Chicago Sun-Times_ thought that "Kidman gives a powerful and moving performance as Saroo's adoptive mother, who loves her son with every molecule of her being, but comes to understand his quest.

Cullinan, The film was an arthouse success, and Katie Walsh of _Tribune News Service_ found Kidman to be "particularly, unsurprisingly excellent in her performance as the steely Miss Martha. She is controlled and in control, unflappable. Her genteel manners and femininity co-exist easily with her toughness."[103] Kidman had two other films premiere at the festival, the science-fiction romantic comedy _How to Talk to Girls at Parties_, reuniting her with director John Cameron Mitchell,[104][105] and the psychological thriller _The Killing of a Sacred Deer_, directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, which also competed for the Palme d'Or.[106][107] Also in 2017, Kidman played supporting roles in the television series _Top of the Lake: China Girl_ and in the comedy-drama _The Upside_, a remake of the 2011 French comedy _The Intouchables_, starring Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart.[108]

In the June 2006 issue of _Ladies' Home Journal_, she said she still loved Cruise: "He was huge; still is. To me, he was just Tom, but to everybody else, he is huge. But he was lovely to me and I loved him. I still love him." In addition, she has expressed shock about their divorce.[121] In 2015, former Church of Scientology executive Mark Rathbun claimed in a documentary film that he was instructed to "facilitate [Cruise's] break-up with Nicole Kidman".[122] Cruise's auditor further claimed Kidman had been wiretapped on Cruise's suggestion.[123]

Prior to marrying Cruise, Kidman had been involved in relationships with Australian actor Marcus Graham and _Windrider_ (1986) co-star Tom Burlinson.[124][125][126] She was also said to be involved with Adrien Brody.[127] The film _Cold Mountain_ brought rumours that an affair between Kidman and co-star Jude Law was responsible for the break-up of his marriage.

Religious and political views

Kidman is Catholic and even considered becoming a nun at one point.[144][145] She attended Mary Mackillop Chapel in North Sydney. Following criticism of _The Golden Compass_ by Catholic leaders[146] as anti-Catholic,[147] Kidman told _Entertainment Weekly_ that the Catholic Church is part of her "essence", and that her religious beliefs would prevent her from taking a role in a film she perceived as anti-Catholic.[148] During her divorce from Tom Cruise, she stated that she did not want their children raised as Scientologists.[149] She has been reluctant to discuss Scientology since her divorce.[150] In 2014, Kidman said she had been practising Transcendental Meditation since her early twenties.[151]
