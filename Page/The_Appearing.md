Reception

Matt Molgaard of _Horror Freak News_ wrote that the film "isn’t smooth, and it isn’t steady. It’s more like a wheelin’ session with your best buddy in his brand new, lifted truck. It’s everywhere. It’s dirty. And you never know when it may just roll right over, or get stuck in knee-high muck."[2]

Lizzie Duncan of HorrorNews.net wrote that the film "is a fairly average film with no big scares in it and only a moderate twist at the end. It’s not terrible, but not too great either. Nothing was overtly ‘wrong’ with the film, but it could have been explored in a more coherent, gripping manner."[3]
