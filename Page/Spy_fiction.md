SPY FICTION, a genre of literature involving espionage as an important context or plot device, emerged in the early twentieth century, inspired by rivalries and intrigues between the major powers, and the establishment of modern intelligence agencies. It was given new impetus by the development of fascism and communism in the lead-up to World War II, continued to develop during the Cold War, and received a fresh impetus from the emergence of rogue states, international criminal organizations, global terrorist networks, maritime piracy and technological sabotage and espionage as potent threats to Western societies.[1] As a genre, spy fiction is thematically related to the novel of adventure (_The Prisoner of Zenda_, 1894, _The Scarlet Pimpernel_, 1905), the thriller (such as the works of Edgar Wallace) and the politico-military thriller (_The Schirmer Inheritance_, 1953, _The Quiet American_, 1955).[2][3]


History

Nineteenth century

Early examples of the espionage novel are _The Spy_ (1821) and _The Bravo_ (1831), by American novelist James Fenimore Cooper. _The Bravo_ attacks European anti-republicanism, by depicting Venice as a city-state where a ruthless oligarchy wears the mask of the "serene republic".

In nineteenth-century France, the Dreyfus Affair (1894–99) contributed much to public interest in espionage.[4] For some twelve years (ca. 1894–1906), the Affair, which involved elements of international espionage, treason, and anti-Semitism, dominated French politics. The details were reported by the world press: an Imperial German penetration agent betraying to Germany the secrets of the General Staff of the French Army; the French counter-intelligence riposte of sending a charwoman to rifle the trash in the German Embassy in Paris, were news that inspired successful spy fiction.[5]

The major themes of spy in the lead-up to the First World War were the continuing rivalry between the European colonial powers for control of Asia, the growing threat of conflict in Europe, the domestic threat of revolutionaries and anarchists, and historical romance.

_Kim_ (1901) by Rudyard Kipling concerns the Anglo–Russian Great Game of imperial and geopolitical rivalry and strategic warfare for supremacy in Central Asia, usually in Afghanistan. _The Secret Agent_ (1907) by Joseph Conrad examines the psychology and ideology motivating the socially marginal men and women of a revolutionary cell determined to provoke revolution in Britain with a terrorist bombing of the Greenwich Observatory. Conrad's next novel, _Under Western Eyes_ (1911), follows a reluctant spy sent by the Russian Empire to infiltrate a group of revolutionaries based in Geneva. G. K. Chesterton's _The Man Who Was Thursday_ (1908) is a metaphysical thriller ostensibly based on the infiltration of an anarchist organisation by detectives; but the story is actually a vehicle for exploring society's power structures and the nature of suffering.

The fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, created by Arthur Conan Doyle, served as a spyhunter for Britain in the stories "The Adventure of the Second Stain" (1904), and "The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans" (1912). In "His Last Bow" (1917), he served Crown and country as a double agent, transmitting false intelligence to Imperial Germany on the eve of the Great War.

_The Scarlet Pimpernel_ (1905) by Baroness Orczy chronicled an English aristocrat's derring-do in rescuing French aristocrats from the Reign of Terror of the populist French Revolution (1789–99).

But the term "spy novel" was defined by _The Riddle of the Sands_ (1903) by Irish author Erskine Childers. It described amateur spies discovering a German plan to invade Britain. Its success created a market for the invasion literature subgenre, which was flooded by imitators. William Le Queux and E. Phillips Oppenheim became the most widely read and most successful British writers of spy fiction, especially of invasion literature. Their prosaic style and formulaic stories, produced voluminously from 1900 to 1914, proved of low literary merit.

During the First World War

During the War, John Buchan became the pre-eminent British spy novelist. His well-written stories portray the Great War as a "clash of civilisations" between Western civilization and barbarism. His notable novels are _The Thirty-nine Steps_ (1915), _Greenmantle_ (1916) and sequels, all featuring the heroic Scotsman Richard Hannay. In France Gaston Leroux published the spy thriller _Rouletabille chez Krupp_ (1917), in which a detective, Joseph Rouletabille, engages in espionage.

Inter-war period

After the Russian Revolution (1917), the quality of spy fiction declined, perhaps because the Bolshevik enemy won the Russian Civil War (1917–23). Thus, the inter-war spy story usually concerns combating the Red Menace, which was perceived as another "clash of civilizations".

Spy fiction was dominated by British authors during this period, initially former intelligence officers and agents writing from inside the trade. Examples include _Ashenden: Or the British Agent_ (1928) by W. Somerset Maugham, which accurately portrays spying in the First World War, and _The Mystery of Tunnel 51_ (1928) by Alexander Wilson whose novels convey an uncanny portrait of the first head of the Secret Intelligence Service, Mansfield Smith-Cumming, the original 'C'.

At a more popular level, Leslie Charteris' popular and long-running _Saint_ series began, featuring Simon Templar, with _Meet the Tiger_ (1928). _Water on the Brain_ (1933) by former intelligence officer Compton Mackenzie was the first successful spy novel satire.[6] Prolific author Dennis Wheatley also wrote his first spy novel, _The Eunuch of Stamboul_ (1935) during this period.

Second World War

The growing threat of fascism in Germany, Italy and Spain, and the imminence of war, attracted quality writers back to spy fiction.

British author Eric Ambler brought a new realism to spy fiction. _The Dark Frontier_ (1936), _Epitaph for a Spy_ (1938), _The Mask of Dimitrios_ (US: _A Coffin for Dimitrios_, 1939), and _Journey into Fear_ (1940) feature amateurs entangled in espionage. The politics and ideology are secondary to the personal story that involved the hero or heroine. Ambler's Popular Front–period _œuvre_ has a left-wing perspective about the personal consequences of "big picture" politics and ideology, which was notable, given spy fiction's usual right-wards tilt in defence of the Establishment attitudes underpinning empire and imperialism. Ambler's early novels _Uncommon Danger_ (1937) and _Cause for Alarm_ (1938), in which NKVD spies help the amateur protagonist survive, are especially remarkable among English-language spy fiction.

_Above Suspicion_ (1939) by Helen MacInnes, about an anti-Nazi husband and wife spy team, features literate writing and fast-paced, intricate, and suspenseful stories occurring against contemporary historical backgrounds. MacInnes wrote many other spy novels in the course of a long career, including _Assignment in Brittany_ (1942), _Decision at Delphi_ (1961), and _Ride a Pale Horse_ (1984).

Manning Coles published _Drink to Yesterday_ (1940), a grim story occurring during the Great War, which introduces the hero Thomas Elphinstone Hambledon. However, later novels featuring Hambledon were lighter-toned, despite being set either in Nazi Germany or Britain during the Second World War (1939–45). After the War, the Hambledon adventures fell to formula, losing critical and popular interest.

The events leading up to the Second World War, and the War itself, continue to be fertile ground for authors of spy fiction. Notable examples include Ken Follett, _Eye of the Needle_ (1978); Alan Furst, _Night Soldiers_ (1988); and David Downing, the Station series, beginning with _Zoo Station_ (2007).

The early Cold War

The metamorphosis of the Second World War (1939–45) into the Soviet–American Cold War (1945–91) gave new impetus to spy novelists. _Atomsk_ by Paul Linebarger, written in 1948 and published in 1949, appears to be the first espionage novel of the dawning conflict.

British

With _Secret Ministry_ (1951), Desmond Cory introduced Johnny Fedora, the secret agent with a licence to kill, the government-sanctioned assassin. Ian Fleming, a former member of naval intelligence, followed swiftly with the glamorous James Bond, secret agent 007 of the British Secret Service, a mixture of counter-intelligence officer, assassin and playboy. Perhaps the most famous fictional spy, Bond was introduced in _Casino Royale_ (1953). After Fleming's death the franchise continued under other British and American authors, including Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver and William Boyd.

Despite the commercial success of Fleming's extravagant novels, John le Carré, himself a former spy, created anti-heroic protagonists who struggled with the ethical issues involved in espionage, and sometimes resorted to immoral tactics. Le Carré's middle-class George Smiley is a middle-aged spy burdened with an unfaithful, upper-class wife who publicly cuckolds him for sport.

Like Le Carré, former British Intelligence officer Graham Greene also examined the morality of espionage in left-leaning, anti-imperialist novels such as _The Heart of the Matter_ (1948), set in Sierra Leone, the seriocomic _Our Man in Havana_ (1959) occurring in the Cuba of dictator Fulgencio Batista before his deposition by Fidel Castro's popular Cuban Revolution (1953–59), and _The Human Factor_ (1978) about British support for the apartheid National Party government of South Africa, against the Red Menace.

Other novelists followed a similar path. Len Deighton's anonymous spy, protagonist of _The IPCRESS File_ (1962), _Horse Under Water_ (1963), _Funeral in Berlin_ (1964), and others, is a working-class man with a negative view of the Establishment.

Other notable examples of espionage fiction during this period were also built around recurring characters. These include James Mitchell's 'John Craig' series, written under his pseudonym 'James Munro', beginning with _The Man Who Sold Death_ (1964); and Trevor Dudley-Smith's Quiller spy novel series written under the pseudonym 'Adam Hall', beginning with _The Berlin Memorandum_ (US: _The Quiller Memorandum_, 1965), a hybrid of glamour and dirt, Fleming and Le Carré; and William Garner's fantastic Michael Jagger in _Overkill_ (1966), _The Deep, Deep Freeze_ (1968), _The Us or Them War_ (1969) and _A Big Enough Wreath_ (1974).

Other important British writers who first became active in spy fiction during this period include Padraig Manning O'Brine, _Killers Must Eat_ (1951); Michael Gilbert, _Be Shot for Sixpence_ (1956); Alistair MacLean, _The Last Frontier_ (1959); Brian Cleeve, _Assignment to Vengeance_ (1961); Jack Higgins, _The Testament of Caspar Schulz_ (1962); and Desmond Skirrow, _It Won't Get You Anywhere_ (1966). Dennis Wheatley's 'Gregory Sallust' (1934-1968) and 'Roger Brook' (1947-1974) series were also largely written during this period.

American

During the war E. Howard Hunt wrote his first spy novel, _East of Farewell_ (1943). In 1949 he joined the recently created CIA, and continued to write spy fiction for many years. Paul Linebarger, a China specialist for the CIA, published _Atomsk_, the first novel of the Cold War, in 1949. In 1955, Edward S. Aarons began publishing the Sam Durell CIA "Assignment" series, which began with _Assignment to Disaster_ (1955). Donald Hamilton published _Death of a Citizen_ (1960) and _The Wrecking Crew_ (1960), beginning the series featuring Matt Helm, a CIA assassin and counter-intelligence agent.

The Nick Carter-Killmaster series of spy novels, initiated by Michael Avallone and Valerie Moolman, but authored anonymously, ran to over 260 separate books between 1964 and the early 1990s and invariably pitted American, Soviet and Chinese spies against each other. With the proliferation of male protagonists in the spy fiction genre, writers and book packagers also started bringing out spy fiction with a female as the protagonist. One notable spy series is _The Baroness_, featuring a sexy female superspy, with the novels being more action-oriented, in the mould of Nick Carter-Killmaster.

Other important American authors who became active in spy fiction during this period include Ross Thomas, _The Cold War Swap_ (1966).

The later Cold War

The June 1967 Six-Day War between Israel and its neighbours introduced new themes to espionage fiction - the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, against the backdrop of continuing Cold War tensions, and the increasing use of terrorism as a political tool.

British

Notable recurring characters from this era include Adam Diment's Philip McAlpine is a long-haired, hashish-smoking fop in the novels _The Dolly Dolly Spy_ (1967), _The Great Spy Race_ (1968), _The Bang Bang Birds_ (1968) and _Think, Inc._ (1971); James Mitchell's 'David Callan' series, written in his own name, beginning with _Red File for Callan_ (1969); William Garner's John Morpurgo in _Think Big, Think Dirty_ (1983), _Rats' Alley_ (1984), and _Zones of Silence_ (1986); and Joseph Hone's 'Peter Marlow' series, beginning with _The Private Sector_ (1971), set during Israel's Six-Day War (1967) against Egypt, Jordan and Syria. In all of these series the writing is literary and the tradecraft believable.

Noteworthy examples of the journalistic style and successful integration of fictional characters with historical events were the politico–military novels _The Day of the Jackal_ (1971) by Frederick Forsyth and _Eye of the Needle_ (1978) by Ken Follett. With the explosion of technology, Craig Thomas, launched the techno-thriller with _Firefox_ (1977), describing the Anglo–American theft of a superior Soviet jet aeroplane.

Other important British writers who first became active in spy fiction during this period include Ian Mackintosh, _A Slaying in September_ (1967); Kenneth Benton, _Twenty-fourth Level_ (1969); Desmond Bagley, _Running Blind_ (1970); Anthony Price, _The Labyrinth Makers_ (1971); Gerald Seymour, _Harry's Game_ (1975); Brian Freemantle, _Charlie M_ (1977); Bryan Forbes, _Familiar Strangers_ (1979); Reginald Hill, _The Spy's Wife_ (1980); and Raymond Harold Sawkins, writing as Colin Forbes, _Double Jeopardy_ (1982).

American

_The Scarlatti Inheritance_ (1971) by Robert Ludlum is usually considered the first American modern (glamour and dirt) spy thriller weighing action and reflection. In the 1970s, former CIA man Charles McCarry began the Paul Christopher series with _The Miernik Dossier_ (1973) and _The Tears of Autumn_ (1978), which were well written, with believable tradecraft.

The first American techno-thriller was _The Hunt for Red October_ (1984) by Tom Clancy. It introduced CIA deskman (analyst) Jack Ryan as a field agent; he reprised the role in the sequel _The Cardinal of the Kremlin_ (1987).

Other important American authors who became active in spy fiction during this period include Robert Littell, _The Defection of A. J. Lewinter_ (1973); James Grady, _Six Days of the Condor_ (1974); William F. Buckley Jr., _Saving the Queen_ (1976); Nelson DeMille, _The Talbot Odyssey_ (1984); W. E. B. Griffin, the _Men at War_ series (1984–); Stephen Coonts, _Flight of the Intruder_ (1986); Canadian-American author David Morrell, _The League of Night and Fog_ (1987); David Hagberg, _Without Honor_ (1989); Noel Hynd, _False Flags_ (1990); and Richard Ferguson, _Oiorpata_ (1990).

Writers of other nationalities

French journalist Gérard de Villiers began to write his _SAS_ series in 1965. The franchise now extends to 200 titles and 150 million books.

Julian Semyonov was an influential spy novelist, writing in the Eastern Bloc, whose range of novels and novel series featured a White Russian spy in the USSR; Max Otto von Stierlitz, a Soviet mole in the Nazi High Command, and Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Cheka. In his novels, Semyonov covered much Soviet intelligence history, ranging from the Russian Civil War (1917–1923), through the Great Patriotic War (1941–45), to the Russo–American Cold War (1945–91).

Swedish author Jan Guillou also began to write his _Coq Rouge_ series, featuring Swedish spy Carl Hamilton, during this period, beginning in 1986.

Post–Cold War

The end of the Cold War in 1991 mooted the USSR, Russia and other Iron Curtain countries as credible enemies of democracy, and the US Congress even considered disestablishing the CIA. Espionage novelists found themselves at a temporary loss for obvious nemeses. _The New York Times_ ceased publishing a spy novel review column. Nevertheless, counting on the aficionado, publishers continued to issue spy novels by writers popular during the Cold War era, among them _Harlot's Ghost_ (1991) by Norman Mailer.

In the US, the new novels _Moscow Club_ (1991) by Joseph Finder, _Coyote Bird_ (1993) by Jim DeFelice, _Masquerade_ (1996) by Gayle Lynds, and _The Unlikely Spy_ (1996) by Daniel Silva maintained the spy novel in the post–Cold War world. Other important American authors who first became active in spy fiction during this period include David Ignatius, _Agents of Innocence_ (1997); David Baldacci, _Saving Faith_ (1999); and Vince Flynn, with _Term Limits_ (1999) and a series of novels featuring counter-terrorism expert Mitch Rapp.

In the UK, Robert Harris entered the spy genre with _Enigma_ (1995). Other important British authors who became active during this period include Hugh Laurie, _The Gun Seller_ (1996); Andy McNab, _Remote Control_ (1998); Henry Porter, _Remembrance Day_ (2000); and Charles Cumming, _A Spy By Nature_ (2001).

Post–9/11

The terrorist attacks against the US on 11 September 2001, and the subsequent War on Terror, reawakened interest in the peoples and politics of the world beyond its borders. Espionage genre elders such as John le Carré, Frederick Forsyth, Robert Littell, and Charles McCarry resumed work, and many new authors emerged.

Important British writers who wrote their first spy novels during this period include Stephen Leather, _Hard Landing_ (2004); and William Boyd, _Restless_ (2006).

New American writers include Brad Thor, _The Lions of Lucerne_ (2002); Ted Bell, _Hawke_ (2003); Alex Berenson, with John Wells appearing for the first time in _The Faithful Spy_ (2006); Brett Battles, _The Cleaner_ (2007); Ellis Goodman, _Bear Any Burden_ (2008); Olen Steinhauer, _The Tourist_ (2009); and Richard Ferguson, _Oiorpata_ (2012). A number of other established writers began to write spy fiction for the first time, including Kyle Mills, _Fade_ (2005) and James Patterson, _Private_ (2010).

Swede Stieg Larsson, who died in 2004, was the world's second best-selling author for 2008 due to his _Millennium series_, featuring Lisbeth Salander, published posthumously between 2005 and 2007. Other authors of note include Australian James Phelan, beginning with _Fox Hunt_ (2010).

Recognising the importance of the thriller genre, including spy fiction, International Thriller Writers (ITW) was established in 2004, and held its first conference in 2006.


Insider spy fiction

Many authors of spy fiction have themselves been intelligence officers working for British agencies such as MI5 or MI6, or American agencies such as the OSS or its successor, the CIA. 'Insider' spy fiction has a special claim to authenticity, and overlaps with biographical and other documentary accounts of secret service.

The first insider fiction emerged after World War 1 as the thinly disguised reminiscences of former British intelligence officers such as W. Somerset Maugham, Alexander Wilson, and Compton Mackenzie. The tradition continued during World War II with Helen MacInnes and Manning Coles.

Notable British examples from the Cold War period and beyond include Ian Fleming, John le Carré, Graham Greene, Brian Cleeve, Ian Mackintosh, Kenneth Benton, Bryan Forbes, Andy McNab and Chris Ryan. Notable American examples include Charles McCarry, William F. Buckley Jr., W. E. B. Griffin and David Hagberg.

Many post-attack period novels are written by insiders.[7] At the CIA, the number of manuscripts submitted for pre-publication vetting doubled between 1998 and 2005.[8] American examples include Barry Eisler, _A Clean Kill in Tokyo_ (2002); Charles Gillen, _Saigon Station_ (2003); R J Hillhouse, _Rift Zone_ (2004); Gene Coyle, _The Dream Merchant of Lisbon_ (2004) and _No Game For Amateurs_ (2009); Thomas F. Murphy, _Edge of Allegiance_ (2005); Mike Ramsdell, _A Train to Potevka_ (2005); T. H. E. Hill, _Voices Under Berlin_ (2008); Duane Evans, _North from Calcutta_ (2009); Jason Matthews, _Red Sparrow_ (2013).;[9][10] and T.L. Williams, _Zero Day: China's Cyber Wars_ (2017).

British examples include _The Code Snatch_ (2001) by Alan Stripp, formerly a cryptographer at Bletchley Park; _At Risk_ (2004), _Secret Asset_ (2006), _Illegal Action_ (2007), and _Dead Line_ (2008), by Dame Stella Rimington (Director General of MI5 from 1992 to 1996); and Matthew Dunn's _Spycatcher_ (2011) and sequels.


Spy television and cinema

Cinema

Much spy fiction was adapted as spy films in the 1960s, ranging from the fantastical James Bond series to the realistic _The Spy Who Came in from the Cold_ (1965), and the hybrid _The Quiller Memorandum_ (1966). While Hamilton's Matt Helm novels were adult and well written, their cinematic interpretations were adolescent parody. This phenomenon spread widely in Europe in the 1960s and is known as the Eurospy genre.

English-language spy films of the 2000s include _The Bourne Identity_ (2002), _Mission: Impossible_ (1996); _Munich_ (2005), _Syriana_ (2005), and _The Constant Gardener_ (2005).

Among the comedy films focusing on espionage are 1974's _S*P*Y*S_ and 1985's _Spies Like Us_.

In March 2015, filming of Howard Kaplan's best selling "The Damascus Cover" as _Damascus Cover_ wrapped in Casablanca starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers, John Hurt, Jurgen Prochnow and Olivia Thirlby. It is set in Damascus and Jerusalem circa 1989 at the time of the Berlin Wall falling.

Television

The American adaptation of _Casino Royale_ (1954) featured Jimmy Bond in an episode of the _Climax!_ anthology series. The narrative tone of television espionage ranged from the drama of _Danger Man_ (1960–68) to the sardonicism of _The Man from U.N.C.L.E_ (1964–68) and the flippancy of _I Spy_ (1965–68) until the exaggeration, akin to that of William Le Queux and E. Phillips Oppenheim before the First World War (1914–18), degenerated to the parody of _Get Smart_ (1965–70).

In 1973, Semyonov's novel _Seventeen Moments of Spring_ (1968) was adapted to television as a twelve-part mini-series about the Soviet spy Maksim Isaev operating in wartime Nazi Germany as Max Otto von Stierlitz, charged with preventing a separate peace between Nazi Germany and America which would exclude the USSR. The programme _TASS Is Authorized to Declare..._ also derives from his work.

However, the circle closed in the late 1970s when _The Sandbaggers_ (1978–80) presented the grit and bureaucracy of espionage.

In the 1980s, US television featured the light espionage programmes _Airwolf_ (1984–87) and _MacGyver_ (1985–92), each rooted in the Cold War yet reflecting American citizens' distrust of their government, after the crimes of the Nixon Government (the internal, political espionage of the Watergate Scandal and the Vietnam War) were exposed. The spy heroes were independent of government; MacGyver, in later episodes and post-DXS employment, works for a non-profit, private think tank, and aviator Hawke and two friends work free-lance adventures. Although each series features an intelligence agency, the DXS in _MacGyver_, and the FIRM, in _Airwolf_, its agents could alternately serve as adversaries as well as allies for the heroes.

Television espionage programmes of the late 1990s to the early 2010s include _La Femme Nikita_ (1997–2001), _Alias_ (2001–2006), _24_ (2001-2010, 2014), _Spooks_ in the UK (release as _MI-5_ in the USA and Canada) (2002-2011), CBBC's _The Secret Show_ (2006-2011), NBC's _Chuck_ (2007-2012), FX's _Archer_ (2009–present), _Burn Notice_, _Covert Affairs_, _Homeland_ and _The Americans_.

In 2015, _Deutschland 83_ is a German television series starring a 24-year-old native of East Germany who is sent to the West as an undercover spy for the HVA, the foreign intelligence agency of the Stasi.


For children and adolescents

In every medium, spy thrillers introduce children and adolescents to deception and espionage at earlier ages. The genre ranges from action adventure, such as Chris Ryan's _Alpha Force_ series, through the historical espionage dramas of Y. S. Lee, to the girl orientation of Ally Carter's _Gallagher Girls_ series, beginning with _I'd Tell You I Love You, But Then I'd Have to Kill You_.

Leading examples include the _Agent Cody Banks_ film, the Alex Rider adventure novels by Anthony Horowitz, and the CHERUB series, by Robert Muchamore. Ben Allsop, one of England's youngest novelists, also writes spy fiction. His titles include _Sharp_ and _The Perfect Kill_.

Spy-related films that are aimed towards younger audiences include movies such as the Spy Kids series of films and The Spy Next Door.

Other authors writing for adolescents include A. J. Butcher, Joe Craig, Charlie Higson, Andy McNab and Francine Pascal.


Video games and theme parks

In contemporary digital video games, the player can be a vicarious spy, as in the _Metal Gear series_, especially in the series' third installment, _Metal Gear Solid_, unlike the games of the Third-Person Shooter genre, _Syphon Filter_, and _Splinter Cell_. The games feature complex stories and cinematic images. Games such as _No One Lives Forever_ and the sequel _No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way_ humorously combine espionage and 1960s design. _Evil Genius (game)_, contemporary to NOLF series, allows the player to be the villain and its strategy occurs real time.

The _Spyland_ espionage theme park, in the Gran Scala pleasure dome, in Zaragoza province, Spain, opened in 2012.


Subgenres

-   Spy comedy: usually parody the clichés and camp elements characteristic to the espionage genre.
-   Spy horror: spy fiction with horror fiction.
-   Spy-Fi: spy fiction with elements of science fiction.
