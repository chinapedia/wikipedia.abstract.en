Name

The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old _Kvås_ farm (Old Norse: _Kváss_), since that is where the Kvås Church was located. The meaning of the name probably refers to a "valley" or "hollow".[2]


History

The municipality of Kvås was established on 1 January 1909 when the old municipality of Lyngdal was divided into three new municipalities: Austad, Lyngdal, and Kvås (population: 736). On 1 January 1963, Austad (population: 608) and Kvås (population: 493) were re-incorporated into the municipality of Lyngdal along with the Gitlevåg area of the neighboring municipality of Spangereid.[3]
