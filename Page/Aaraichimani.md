Premise

Manuneethi Chozhan was a popular and just king. When a calf is killed by his only son, the mother cow asks for justice. The king orders that his son be killed in the same manner as the calf.[2] The gods come and restore both his son's and the calf's life. This story is downplayed in the film. The film details the aftermath of this popular story.
