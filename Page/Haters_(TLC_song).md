Background and promotion

On October 26, 2016, TLC released two singles "Joyride" and "Haters"[3] exclusively in Japan as a follow up to promote their upcoming fifth studio album TLC.[4] "Joyride" shot to number one on the iTunes chart in Japan upon its release.[5] On November 1, 2016, the song was released in New Zealand.[6] The song was before released as "We Don't Care About That Anyway" by The Rosso Sisters in 2014.[7]


Critical reception

The song was met with positive reviews from critics. _Billboard_ gave a positive review of the song "Last month, Chilli and T-Boz shared the first single from that album, the Snoop Dogg collab "Way Back". And now they've got another new song. This one is called "Haters", and like their 1999 hit "Unpretty", it's a sort of self-empowerment anthem, a call to stop listening to whatever petty criticisms people might have. The production is a throwback, too, to that late-'90s retro-futuristic style."[8] HotNewHipHop called the track an "empowering anthem" stating "Bringing the title to life, T-Boz & Chilli call out their "haters" & naysayers in this empowering new single, while promoting self-confidence in the process. "Haters gonna hate / People gon' say what they gon' say / We don't care about that anyway," they sing."[9]
