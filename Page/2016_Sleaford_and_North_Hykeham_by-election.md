The SLEAFORD AND NORTH HYKEHAM BY-ELECTION was a by-election in England for the House of Commons constituency of Sleaford and North Hykeham held on 8 December 2016.[1] It was triggered by the resignation of Conservative MP Stephen Phillips on 4 November 2016. It was the first by-election to be contested in Lincolnshire since the Great Grimsby by-election in 1977, triggered by the death of previous MP Anthony Crosland.


Background

Phillips had backed Brexit at the 2016 referendum, but criticised the Conservative government under Prime Minister Theresa May for failing to consult Parliament sufficiently.

In his resignation letter to his local Conservative Association, Phillips set out three policy areas where he had fallen out with the Government, including: “its failure to appreciate the constitutional necessity of properly consulting Parliament” on leaving the EU; “the continued shirking of our responsibility for unaccompanied child refugees who have been forced to flee war and conflict;“ and, “the way in which international aid is now apparently to be used other than to assist some of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people.”

He then concluded, saying, "It has become clear to me over the last few months that my growing and very significant policy differences with the current government mean that I am unable properly to represent the people who elected me".[2]

In the Richmond Park by-election that was held one week before the Sleaford vote, the Liberal Democrats won the seat from former Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith on a substantial swing.


Candidates and campaign

The Conservative campaign started on 5 November, with a candidate to be chosen on 10 November.[3][4] Caroline Johnson, a consultant paediatrician, was selected following a hustings. She stood in Scunthorpe at the 2010 general election.[5]

At least four individuals put themselves forth to be UKIP's candidate: the Lincolnshire County Councillors Richard Davies, Robin Hunter-Clarke and Victoria Ayling, and the party leadership candidate Suzanne Evans.[6] Hunter-Clarke pulled out of the contest.[7] Ayling was selected;[8] she stood for UKIP in the 2016 Lincolnshire Police and Crime Commissioner election (coming second to the Conservatives) and in the Great Grimsby constituency in 2015 (coming third). She had previously stood in Great Grimsby in 2010 as the Conservative candidate (coming second to Labour).

The Liberal Democrats selected Ross Pepper on 11 November.[9] He stood in Lincoln in 2015.

The Labour Party selected Jim Clarke, a refuse collector and former postman.[10]

Marianne Overton, leader of the Lincolnshire Independents, stood as their candidate.

Sarah Stock stood as an independent on a "Save the NHS" platform. The Green Party declared that it would not be fielding a candidate, but instead supported Stock.[11]

Also standing were Peter Hill, also known as The Iconic Arty-Pole, of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party; Mark Suffield, a North Kesteven district councillor;[12] and Paul Coyne, a Sleaford Town Councillor, the two of whom appearing with no ballot paper description.[13]
