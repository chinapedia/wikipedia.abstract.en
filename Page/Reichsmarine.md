The _REICHSMARINE_ (, "Navy of the Realm") was the name of the German Navy during the Weimar Republic and first two years of Nazi Germany.[1] It was the naval branch of the _Reichswehr_, existing from 1919 to 1935. In 1935, it became known as the _Kriegsmarine_, a branch of the _Wehrmacht_; a change implemented by Adolf Hitler. Many of the administrative and organizational tenets of the _Reichsmarine_ were then carried over into the organization of the _Kriegsmarine_.[2]


_Vorläufige Reichsmarine_

The _Vorläufige Reichsmarine_ (Provisional Imperial Navy) was formed after the end of World War I from the Imperial German Navy.

The provisions of the Treaty of Versailles restricted the German Navy to 15,000 men and no submarines, while the fleet was limited to six pre-dreadnought battleships, six cruisers, twelve destroyers, and twelve torpedo boats. Replacements for the outdated battleships were restricted to a maximum size of 10,000 tons.


_Reichsmarine_

The _Reichsmarine_ was considered the armed naval force of the _Reichswehrministerium_ (Ministry of the Reichswehr) which was headed by a civilian minister appointed by the government of the Weimar Republic. The senior most naval officer was known until 1920 as the _Chef der Admiralität_ (Chief of the Admiralty), after which the title changed to the Chief of the Naval Command (_Chef der Marineleitung_).[3]

The Naval Command also maintained a headquarters intelligence office (_Marinenachrichtenoffizier_) and a naval archives. Internal to the naval headquarters five offices known as the:

-   _Marinekommandoamt_ (A) – Operations
-   _Allgemeine Marineamt_ (B) – General Administration
-   _Marineverwaltungsamt_ (C) – Personnel and Administration
-   _Marinewaffenamt_ (_MWa_) – Naval War Office
-   _Marinekonstruktionsamt_ (K) – Naval Construction Office

The following officers served as head of the _Reichsmarine_ from 1918 to 1935

Chief of the Admiralty (_Chef der Admiralität_)

Heads of the Naval Command (_Chefs der Marineleitung_)

Fleet command

The fleet command of the Reichsmarine (_Flottenkommando_) was headquartered at Kiel and consisted of a flag staff and fleet commander embarked on board the flagship of the German fleet. During the 1920s, the German flagship was the _SMS Schleswig-Holstein_ with two naval officers serving as fleet commander, _Vizeadmiral_ Hans Zenker and Konrad Mommsen, between 1923 and 1927. The fleet commander position was then left vacant, but the flag staff remained.

The purpose of fleet command was to oversee the four major type commanders of German naval vessels. These commands were in turn responsible for the administration of various German ship classes to include equipment development, vessel deployments, and personnel assignment. Once at sea, operational control of the vessels switched to the commanders of the two main Naval Sea Stations. The four type commands were:

-   _Befehlshaber der Linienschiffe_ – Commander of Ships of the Line, headquartered at Kiel, the flagship in 1933 was the cruiser _Deutschland_
-   _Befehlshaber der Aufklärungsstreitkräfte_ – Commander of Reconnaissance Craft, flagship was the cruiser _Königsberg_ headquartered at Kiel
-   _Führer der Torpedoboote_ – Leader of Torpedo-boats, headquartered at Swinemünde overseeing four flotillas of torpedo boats
-   _Führer der Minsensuchboote_ – Leader of Minesweepers, headquartered at Kiel commanding two minesweeper flotillas and one _Räumbooten_ ("R boat") mine auxiliary unit.

Naval sea stations

The Reichsmarine did not maintain traditional at-sea fleets, but instead assigned two geographical areas (known as _Marinestation_) which oversaw all vessels operationally deployed in the North and Baltic Seas. Each naval station maintained a headquarters staff, general naval inspectorate, training department, artillery arsenal inspector, as well as a medical command unit. The naval stations also served as a senior officer for the commanders of the various German navy ports.[4]

NAVAL STATIONS OF THE REICHSMARINE

-   Marinestation der Nordsee (North Sea naval station) – headquartered at Wilhelmshaven, overseeing the ports of Cuxhaven and Borkum
-   Marinestation der Ostsee (Baltic Sea naval station) – headquartered at Kiel, overseeing the ports of Swinemünde and Pillau

Ships and equipment

The Treaty of Versailles limited the size and armament of the _Reichsmarine_ and prevented it from introducing new technologies. The restrictions were intended to prevent the German Navy from becoming a threat to the Allied powers. On the other hand, the Allies had made certain that the _Reichsmarine_ would be in the foreseeable future the strongest power in the Baltic Sea, in order to serve as a counterweight against the new Soviet Union, which was viewed with distrust by the Allies.

Germany was only allowed six battleships, six cruisers, twelve destroyers, and twelve torpedo boats. The _Reichsmarine_ tried to meet the arms restrictions with secret armament and technical innovations such as the introduction of the pocket battleship.
