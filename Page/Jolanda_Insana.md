JOLANDA INSANA (18 May 1937 â€“ 27 October 2016) was an Italian poet and translator.

Born in Messina, in 1968 Insana moved to Rome where she graduated in Ancient Literature with a thesis on Erinna's _The Distaff_. Active as translator of classical and contemporary authors, she debuted as a poet in 1977, with the collection _Sciarra amara_ ("Bitter Harvest"). In 2002 she won the Viareggio Prize for poetry for _La stortura_.[1][2]

Giovanni Raboni described Insana's poetic style as "visionary concreteness".[3]
