Born as Ayşe, Hubbi Hatun spent her early childhood in the city of Amasya. She was the daughter of Şeyh Akşemseddin, and granddaughter of Beşiktaşlı Şeyh Yahya Efendi. She was very well educated, and had learned Arabic, studied poetry.


Marriage

She married her first cousin, son of her maternal aunt, Prince Selim's tutor, Akşemseddinzade Şemsi Efendi, milk brother of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. She had a daughter married to poet Mehmed Vusuli Efendi, known as Molla Çelebi. A garden in Fındıklı belonged to Hubbi Hatun.


Career

After her husband's death in 1551, she remained at the court and was a boon companion of Prince Selim. Hubbi Hatun was famous for her beauty and poetry. She was rumoured to have had love affairs with several of Selim's courtiers. When Selim ascended the throne in 1566, Hubbi came to Istanbul. After Selim's death in 1574, Hubbi Hatun became a lady-in-waiting to his son, the new Sultan Murad III. She had been influential in the reign of both Sultan Selim II and his son Murad III, along with other musahibes (favourites) of Murad, who included mistress of the housekeeper Canfeda Hatun and mistress of financial affairs Raziye Hatun.

Poetry

She wrote lyric poems (gazef) and odes (kaside). She also wrote a narrative poem (mesnevi) under the title "Hürşid and Cemşid", which consisted of more than three thousands of beyits. Her style of writing poetry was not feminine, and wrote just like her male colleagues. She was praised in tezkires for her poetic skills. The poetic persona (mahlas) “Hubbi”, with which Hubbi Hatun signed her gazels in the last hemistich, can also be found at the end of a risale (message or letter), a short work on religious warfare entitled “İmadu’l-Cihad”.

The following poetry was written by Hubbi.

  Being feminine is no shame to the name of the sun...
  Being masculine is no glory to the crescent moon.

Another set of poetry written by Hubbi Hatun included, "Der Rağbet-i Dua":

  Dua temsili Yusuf gibi her dem
  Kim ana müşteridir halkı alem

  Verir her kişi makdurunca gevher
  Anın ta müşterisinden olalar

  Sen oldun şimdi hem ol zen misali
  Kaçan arz eyledi Yusuf cemali

  Geturüp nice rişte anda bir zen
  Hıridar oldu ana canu dilden
