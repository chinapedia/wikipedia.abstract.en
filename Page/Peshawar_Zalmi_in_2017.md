Pakistan Super League

In their first game of PSL 2017, Peshawar Zalmi lost to the Islamabad United by 7 wickets.[5] In their next game against Karachi Kings, Zalmi won by 7 wickets in pursuit of 120. Eoin Morgan starred in the chase with an unbeaten innings of 80 off 57 balls.[6] Following this the Zalmi were involved in a low-scoring thriller with the Lahore Qalandars that saw the former collapse in the chase of just 60 runs before getting over the line with 3 wickets to spare.[7]

As the tournament moved to Sharjah, Zalmi's first game against Quetta Gladiators was abandoned after repeated showers and the two teams shared the points from the bout.[8] Following this, against Islamabad United, the Zalmis lost a hard-fought game that went down to the last ball. After being put in to bat by United, Zalmi could only manage a below-par score of 137 and never really got going. But the team's bowlers bowled exceedingly well to make a contest out of it.[9] In their final game of the Sharjah leg, the Zalmis continued their losing streak after being beaten by Karachi Kings in a thrilling contest. Setting up a target of 175, the Kings had the Zalmis reduced to 69–6 before Shahid Afridi and Darren Sammy combined in a 70-run partnership that almost won the game for the Zalmis. However, they couldn't see the game through as the Zalmis fell short by 9 runs.[10]

With the tournament shifting back to Dubai, the Zalmis registered consecutive wins against Lahore Qalandars and Quetta Gladiators respectively. Against the Qalandars, the team put up a target of 167 and then successful defended it after inducing a batting collapse of 5 wickets for 6 runs from the opposition. In the end prevailing by 17 runs and securing a play-off spot.[11] But with the Galdiators, the team suffered a batting collapse of their own. Chasing a below-par total of 129, the Zalmis were at one time reduced to 52–6 before a vintage performance from Shahid Afridi, who scored 45 off 23 balls, ensured that his team won with 2 wickets left intact.[12] The team thus qualified Qualifier 1, but were defeated by Quetta Gladiators by 1 run in a close encounter, despite the 77 runs innings of Mohammad Hafeez.
