History

The Biribiri State Park was created by decree 39.909 of 22 September 1998. The park is named after the Fazenda Biribiri, which covered most of its area. It is administered by the State Institute of Forestry (IEF). The objectives are to preserve the area due to its environmental and cultural importance. The park became part of the Espinhaço Mosaic of conservation units, created in 2010.

Infrastructure is minimal. There is one caretaker who works in a shack at the park entrance, and there is a house at one of the highest points used as a lookout at periods of high fire risk. In April 2013, the Public Ministry and Justice department of Minas Gerais charged that the State Forestry Institute had been failing to comply with environmental legislation. There were serious problems such as lack of a management plan, physical structures and personnel, and land tenure issues with the ecological stations of Mata do Acauã and Mata dos Ausentes and the state parks of Biribiri, Alto Cariri, Rio Preto and Serra Negra.


Attractions

The Cachoeira do Sentinela, a waterfall, is about from the entrance. Visitors may bathe in the pool. Further on is the Cachoeira dos Cristais. This waterfall is from the entrance, and may be reached by car. The Caminho dos Escravos (Slave Trail) is a trail that passes through the interior of the park. Other attractions are the Água Limpa and Estudante pools, and the 4 hour waterfall trail. As of 2016 the park was open every day including holidays, and admission was free. Visitors may use bicycles on the trails that lead to the waterfalls. The months from May to July are cold, and suitable for hiking.

Vila de Biribiri

The Estamparia SA, a textile factory, was created in the interior of what is now the park in 1876 by the Bishop of Diamantina, João Antônio dos Santos. This was one of the first and most important textile factories in the state. The workers lived in a small town in the center of a valley, which held a warehouse, school and church. The church bell was made in the factory, and the clock was donated by the Portuguese royal family. The Biribiri River, which runs through the park, powered the hydroelectric turbines that delivered electricity to the factory and the village. The factory had 1,200 workers. It closed in 1976, and the village was emptied. The village is still owned by Estamparia SA, and tourists can rent the houses. There are two restaurants in the village.
