Description

_Eucalyptus captiosa_ is a mallee or mallet that typically grows to a height of and has smooth grey, creamy white or coppery bark, sometimes with ribbons of partly shed bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have oblong, egg-shaped or lance-shaped leaves long and wide. The adult leaves are thick, linear to narrow elliptic, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of three or seven in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are pear-shaped to oval, long and wide, usually ribbed and with a beaked operculum. Flowering mainly occurs from July to November and the flowers are cream-coloured to pale yellow. The fruit is a woody, cylindrical to barrel-shaped or cup-shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel usually long.[1][2][3]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus captiosa_ was first formally described in 1993 by Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper and the description was published in the journal _Nuytsia_ from a specimen near Jerramungup.[4] The specific epithet (_captiosa_) is a word Latin meaning "deceptive",[5] referring to the fine leaves, which are very different from those of the related _E. incrassata_.[6]


Distribution and habitat

This eucalypt grow in sandy and gravelly soils in heath between Tambellup and Jerramungup in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions.[7][8][9]


Conservation status

_Eucalyptus captiosa_ is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[10]
