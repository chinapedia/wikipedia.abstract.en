GIBBERISH, alternatively JIBBER, JABBER, JIBBER-JABBER, or GOBBLEDYGOOK, is speech that is (or appears to be) nonsense. It may include speech sounds that are not actual words,[1] or language games and specialized jargon that seems nonsensical to outsiders.[2]

"Gibberish" is also used as an imprecation to denigrate or tar ideas or opinions the user disagrees with or finds irksome, a rough equivalent of "nonsense", "falderal", or "claptrap". The implication is that the criticized expression or proposition lacks substance or congruence, as opposed to simply being a differing view.

The word _gibberish_ is more commonly applied to informal speech, while _gobbledygook_ (sometimes _gobbledegook_, _gobbledigook_ or _gobbledegoo_) is more often applied to writing or language that is meaningless or is made unintelligible by excessive use of abstruse technical terms. "Officialese", "legalese", or "bureaucratese" are forms of gobbledygook. The related word _jibber-jabber_ refers to rapid talk that is difficult to understand.[3]


Etymology

The etymology of _gibberish_ is uncertain. The term was first seen in English in the early 16th century.[4] It is generally thought to be an onomatopoeia imitative of speech, similar to the words _jabber_ (to talk rapidly) and _gibber_ (to speak inarticulately).[5][6]

It may originate from the word _jib_, which is the Angloromani variant of the Romani language word meaning "language" or "tongue". To non-speakers, the Anglo-Romany dialect could sound like English mixed with nonsense words, and if those seemingly-nonsensical words are referred to as _jib_ then the term _gibberish_ (pronounced "jibberish") could be derived as a descriptor for nonsensical speech. Another theory is that _gibberish_ came from the name of a famous 8th century Arabian alchemist, Jābir ibn Hayyān, whose name was Latinized as _Geber_. Thus, _gibberish_ was a reference to the incomprehensible technical jargon and allegorical coded language used by Jabir and other alchemists.[7][8][9]

A discredited alternative theory asserts that it is derived from the Irish word _gob_ or _gab_ ("mouth")[10] or from the Irish phrase _Geab ar ais_ ("back talk, backward chat").[11] The latter Irish etymology was suggested by Daniel Cassidy, whose work has been criticised by linguists and scholars.[12][13][14] The terms _geab_ and _geabaire_ are certainly Irish words, but the phrase _geab ar ais_ does not exist, and the word _gibberish_ exists as a loan-word in Irish as _gibiris_.[15]

The term _gobbledygook_ was coined by Maury Maverick, a former congressman from Texas and former mayor of San Antonio.[16] When Maverick was chairman of the Smaller War Plants Corporation during World War II, he sent a memorandum that said: "Be short and use plain English. ... Stay off gobbledygook language."[17][18] Maverick defined _gobbledygook_ as "talk or writing which is long, pompous, vague, involved, usually with Latinized words." The allusion was to a turkey, "always gobbledygobbling and strutting with ridiculous pomposity."[19][20]


Use

Gobbledygook

The term "gobbledygook" has a long history of usage in politics. Nixon's Oval Office tape from June 14, 1971, showed H. R. Haldeman describing a situation to Nixon as "... a bunch of gobbledygook. But out of the gobbledygook comes a very clear thing: You can't trust the government; you can't believe what they say."[21] President Ronald Reagan explained tax law revisions in an address to the nation with the word, May 28, 1985, saying that "most didn’t improve the system; they made it more like Washington itself: Complicated, unfair, cluttered with gobbledygook and loopholes designed for those with the power and influence to hire high-priced legal and tax advisers."[22] In 2017, US Supreme Court justice John Roberts dismissed quantitative sociological reasoning as "gobbledygook" in arguing against any numerical test for gerrymandering.[23]

Michael Shanks, former chairman to the National Consumer Council of Great Britain, characterizes professional gobbledygook as sloppy jargon intended to confuse nonspecialists: "'Gobbledygook' may indicate a failure to think clearly, a contempt for one's clients, or more probably a mixture of both. A system that can't or won't communicate is not a safe basis for a democracy."[24]

In acting

Using gibberish whilst acting can be used as an exercise in performance art education.[25] Another usage of gibberish is as part of Osho's "Gibberish meditation"[26] which has been derived from an old Sufi practice.


Other terms and usage

The terms _officialese_ or _bureaucratese_ refer to language used by officials or authorities. _Legalese_ is a closely related concept, referring to language used by lawyers, legislators, and others involved with the law. The language used in these fields may contain complex sentences and specialized jargon or buzzwords, making it difficult for those outside the field to understand.[27] Speakers or writers of officialese or legalese may recognize that it is confusing or even meaningless to outsiders, but view its use as appropriate within their organization or group.[28]

Bafflegab is a synonym, a slang term referring to confusing or a generally unintelligible use of jargon.[29]
