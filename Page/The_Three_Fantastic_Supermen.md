Production

_The Three Fantastic Supermen_ was conceived during the period of a superhero film cycle during the mid-1960s in Italy. Howard Hughes described _The Three Fantastic Supermen_ as being patterned after the film _Superargo and the Faceless Giants_. The director Gianfranco Parolini had worked in several genres including sword-and-sandal films where there are more than one heroes helping each other solve their goals. Gianfranco Parolini commented on the stunts in the film, noting that they were done on set with actor Aldo Canti having to jump out of 20 feet high window, jump into a trampoline and jump into a truck which was moving at full speed. The film was entirely shot in Yugoslavia.


Release

_The Three Fantastic Supermen_ was released in Italy in 1967. In his book _Diabolika: Supercriminals, Superheroes and the Comic Book Universe in Italian Cinema_, Roberto Curti described the film as a "reasonable box office success in Italy". It was released in France on 3 September 1969.[1]

The film spawned several sequels where the trio of heroes showing up in Japan (_Three Supermen at Tokyo_, 1968), Africa (_Three Supermen in the Jungle_, 1970), Hong Kong (_Supermen Against the Orient_, 1973) and the American West (_The Three Supermen in the West_, 1973).


Reception

In a contemporary review, the _Monthly Film Bulletin_ noted that the stunt work of the title characters and their various stunt doubles "provide a welcome relief from the standard secret agent/judo syndrome" as well as that the "ingenuity of this comic strip adventure begins to pall after the first half hour, and the inevitable final holocaust in the master criminal's lair is brightened by the villain's diverting scheme to produce an army of robot villains who all look like the hero."[2]

From retrospective reviews, Roberto Curti described the film as a "mixed bag" taking too much material from its sources such as _The Phantom_, _Zorro_ and _Goldfinger_.
