Playing style

Thampi bowls at a speed in excess of 140 kmph[10] and is known for bowling yorkers consistently. Former India fast bowler and bowling coach of Kerala Tinu Yohannan described Thampi as "athletic" and "quite strong",[11] and added, "He's very deceptive. He has a round-arm action where he can really get the ball to move. He can reverse the old ball."[12] Thampi has stated that he "got [his] yorkers from tennis ball cricket."[13]
