Craig was born in Kalgoorlie to Hilda Dagma (née Thornton) and James Burnett Craig. He attended Scotch College, Perth, and then found work as a clerk with Western Australian Government Railways, working at Welshpool. Craig enlisted in the Australian Army in 1939, and saw active duty in the Middle Eastern theatre. He initially returned to the railways after being discharged in 1942, and then from 1947 served as secretary and accountant for a cooperative based in the Swan Valley. From 1951 to 1952, he was also a member of the Midland Junction Town Council.[1]

Craig entered parliament at the 1959 state election, replacing the retiring Lindsay Thorn.[2] After the 1962 election, he was elevated to the ministry, replacing George Cornell as Minister for Transport and Minister for Police. In a reshuffle after the 1965 election, Craig replaced Ross Hutchinson as Chief Secretary, although he lost the transport portfolio to Charles Court. He remained in the ministry until his retirement at the 1971 state election. Craig died in Perth in January 1989, aged 77. He had married Maria Rhoda Haynes in 1936, with whom he had three children.[3]
