CANADA CUP 2016 was a fighting game event that took place in Toronto, Canada on October 28-30. The seventh incarnation of the Canada Cup hosted 14 tournaments: games that were played at the event ranged from _Street Fighter II Turbo_ to _The King of Fighters XIV_. The _Street Fighter V_ tournament held at Canada Cup 2016 was the last Premier Event of the 2016 Capcom Pro Tour: its champion NuckleDu automatically qualified to compete in the 2016 Capcom Cup.


Background

The sixth incarnation of the annual Canada Cup organised by Lap Chi Duong was hosted in a Holiday Inn in Toronto, Canada on October 28-30.[1] Described by _Motherboard_ as the "largest and most prestigious fighting game tournament in the country," the Canada Cup featured a $15,000 USD prize pool for its _Street Fighter V_ tournament as well as a spot for the 2016 Capcom Cup.[2] The _Street Fighter_ tournament featured a "pool of death" set-up similar to that of NorCal Regionals the same year, allowing players to enter the competition at the door, though with a large disadvantage.[3]

To promote the _Super Smash Bros. Melee_ tournament, Duong "invaded" the Twitch.tv streams of high-level _Super Smash Bros._ players Armada, Hungrybox, and Mang0 – using a donation of $895 USD in order to get their attention – asking them to attend the competition. Duong stated in an interview with _Motherboard_ that the "Five Gods" of _Super Smash Bros._ are difficult to reach due to their large fanbase, giving him the idea of reaching them through a publicity stunt. The stunt greatly increased attendance of the _Super Smash Bros. Melee_ tournament.[4] Mang0 however pulled out of the tournament due to him wanting to spend time with his son on Halloween.[5]

73 people entered the _Super Street Fighter II Turbo_ tournament held at Canada Cup 2016; 18 more than in a similar tournament held at Evo 2016. Despite the age of the game, _Red Bull_ stated that _Super Street Fighter II Turbo_ is going through a kind of "North American renaissance", as new players enter the _Street Fighter V_ scene with memories of their childhood. Canada Cup has been the biggest gathering of high level players of this game since 2014.[6]

The Canada Cup was the first qualifying tournament for the 2017 _King of Fighters XIV_ World Championship.[7] The _Super Smash Bros. for Wii U_ event was won by 15-year old Mexican, Leonardo "MKLeo" Pérez.[8]


_Street Fighter V_ tournament summary

The _Street Fighter V_ tournament at Canada Cup 2016 featured various upsets and surprises. Norwegian player Arman "Phenom" Hanjani dominated most of the tournament – defeating Daigo Umehara 3-0 – until being defeated by Chris Tatarian. Though Kenneth "K-Brad" Bradley managed to defeat Infiltration in a 2-1 set, he lost to NuckleDu in a later round.[9][10]

Canada Cup 2016 was the first Capcom Pro Tour Premier Event since The Fall Classic in October 2014 to be won by an American player: Du "NuckleDu" Dang. However, as he had already qualified for the Capcom Cup through the Global Leaderboards, NuckleDu's automatic qualification primarily freed up a spot for another high-ranking player.[11] NuckleDu won the tournament after defeating Zhuojun "Xiao Hai" Zeng in the grand finals, playing a strong R. Mika.[12][13]
