TESTOSTERONE BENZOATE, or TESTOSTERONE 17Β-BENZOATE, also known as ANDROST-4-EN-17Β-OL-3-ONE 17Β-BENZOATE, is a synthetic, injected anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) and an androgen ester – specifically, the benzoate C17β ester of testosterone – which was never marketed.[1][2] It is a prodrug of testosterone and, when administered via intramuscular injection, is associated with a long-lasting depot effect and extended duration of action.[3][4][5] The drug was first described in 1936 and was the first androgen ester and ester of testosterone to be synthesized.[6]
