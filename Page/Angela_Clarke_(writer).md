Personal life

In April 2012, Clarke was diagnosed with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) III, an inherited connective tissue disorder caused by a defect in the structure, production, or processing of collagen or proteins that interact with collagen.[58][59][60] She has said about her disorder: "My condition has made me look at things in a different way. But it is also a good thing because I'm white, middle class and live in St Albans, I'm comfortable – all things that make me pretty standard, and having a disability makes me other, and gives me different viewpoint on things and that's a good thing when you are writing."[61]
