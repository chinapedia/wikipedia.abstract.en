Career

CITYPOCKETS

In 2010, Yeoh and her co-founder founded her first start-up CityPockets, the very first digital wallet and secondary marketplace for daily deals. CityPockets was among 7 startups selected to participate in an accelerator in North Carolina called LaunchBox Digital.

Some users called CityPockets the "mint.com and ebay for daily deals." The technology supported over 50 of the top daily deal sites including Groupon, Living Social, BuyWithMe, Gilt City, Bloomspot, Google Offers, Restaurant.com and Zozi. CityPockets was featured prominently in many news and media sites including Fox News,[7] ABC7,[8] CNN, WSJ, Forbes, Netted by the Webbys, TechCrunch, GigaOm, AllThingsD, Lifehacker, CNET, Mashable, and TheNextWeb.

At the beginning of Yeoh’s startup journey, she was known to be a scrappy startup entrepreneur where she crashed in a friend’s living room futon for 5 months and put herself on a “kale and quinoa” diet in order to maintain a food budget of $35 a week.[9] Yeoh eventually raised $770,000 from venture capitalists and angel investors in New York in 2011.

RECLIP.IT (ACQUIRED BY WALMART LABS)

When the daily deal space started consolidating,[10] Yeoh shut down CityPockets and pivoted the company to launch Reclip.It in 2012.[11] Reclip.It is a personalized list-making app featuring weekly ads and digital coupons from top retail stores like Walmart, Macy's, Walgreens, Target, BestBuy, Home Depot, CVS, etc. Reclip.It was selected by Instyle Magazine as "2012 Best of the Web," mentioned as the #1 tool to Shop Smarter on Daily Tekk, and also featured on TechCrunch, Huffington Post, FastCompany, USA Today, Xconomy, and Forbes.

In Spring of 2013, Reclip.It was acquired by Walmart Labs. While the sale amount was not disclosed, Yeoh was reported by the media to be one of nine self-made women millionaires who are making a difference to the US economy.[12] The startup had previously received funding from 500Startups, Great Oaks Venture Capital and angel investors in Silicon Valley and NYC, bringing the total funding to just over $1M.

MaGIC was given an initial grant of US$21.4 million [13] and was launched by former President Barack Obama and Malaysian's former Prime Minister Najib Razak on 27 April 2014.

In her time at MaGIC, Yeoh launched programs such as the Malaysia Accelerator Program (MAP),[14] bringing together startups across ASEAN, 500Startups’ Distro Dojo,[15] the MaGIC Academy and also inked a 3-year partnership with Stanford University and Techstars, where she created immersive programs as a bridge for entrepreneurs in Southeast Asia to be exposed to the Silicon Valley startup ecosystem.

Women's Voice

In reports[23] from TechCrunch and other publicly accessible websites, Cheryl reported her unpleasant encounter with a leader of 500 Startups, David McClure, which caused emotional distress.

Sexual Harassment in Silicon Valley

In 2017, Yeoh came forward and published her account of the sexual harassment she experienced in 2014. Yeoh’s claims were against Dave McClure who had recently resigned from 500 Startups after allegation by another woman.[24] In the account, posted online after founder Sarah Kunst and Susan Yin’s accusations,[25] Yeoh alleges that McClure repeatedly harassed her while in Malaysia.[26] In an interview to the BBC, she recounted the incident stating, “I felt like it wasn't a rare thing, it was considered normal in the start-up world, the tech world".[27]

In a follow up interview, Yeoh announced that she would not be pressing charges against McClure as her main goal was to raise awareness about sexual harassment and abuse of power, specifically in the tech world.[28]

#MovingForward

Following the release of her account, Cheryl Yeoh worked with co-founder Andy Coravos[29] to establish the #MovingFoward public directory. The #MovingFoward directory includes dozens of tech oriented top tier venture capital firms that have posted their reporting contacts and have publicly committed to a protocol of improving anti-harassment, anti-discrimination, diversity and inclusion measures in the workplace. Launched to coincide with international Women’s Day in May 2018 the movement is specifically aimed at giving young entrepreneurs who are often reluctant to speak out against investors,[30] a forum where they may speak openly about harassment.[31]
