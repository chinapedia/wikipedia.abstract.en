_CALADENIA CAESAREA_ SUBSP. _TRANSIENS_, commonly known as the DWARF MUSTARD SPIDER ORCHID, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has a single spreading, hairy leaf and up to three small lemon-yellow flowers with red stripes. It is only known from a single small population near the town of Williams.


Description

_Caladenia caesarea_ subsp. _transiens_ is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and about wide. There are up to three lemon-yellow flowers borne on a stem high and each flower is long and wide. The lateral sepals and petals spread widely. The labellum is lemon-yellow coloured with brownish-red stripes, projects prominently with a curled tip, has an irregularly serrated edge and two rows of shiny yellow calli along its centre. Flowering occurs between September and October and is followed by a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing a large number of seeds.[1][2][3]


Taxonomy and naming

This orchid was first formally described by Karel Domin in 1912 and given the name _Caladenia filamentosa_ subsp. _caesarea_. Domin's description was published in _Journal of the Linnean Society, Botany_[4][5] but in 1989 Mark Clements and Stephen Hopper raised it to species status.[6][7] In 2001 Hopper and Andrew Brown described three subspecies, including subspecies _transiens_ and the descriptions were published in _Nuytsia_.[8] The epithet (_transiens_) alludes to the shape of the labellum which is intermediate between that of _Caladenia filamentosa_ and the other subspecies of _Caladenia caesarea_.[9]


Distribution and habitat

Dwarf mustard spider orchid only occurs near Williams in the Jarrah Forest biogeographic region where it grows under dense rock sheoak and wandoo trees.[10][11][12][13]


Conservation

_Caladenia caesarea_ subsp. _transiens_ is classified as "Priority One" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife,[14] meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.[15]
