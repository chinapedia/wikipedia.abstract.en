Biography

s on display occupying two shelves at an Empik bookstore in Katowice, Poland]] Sapkowski studied economics at the University of Łódź, and before turning to writing, he had worked as a senior sales representative for a foreign trade company. He started his literary career as a translator, in particular, of science fiction. He says he wrote his first short story, "The Witcher" ("Wiedźmin", also translated "The Hexer" or "Spellmaker") on a whim, in order to enter a contest by Polish science fiction and fantasy magazine _Fantastyka_. In an interview he said that being a businessman at the time and thus familiar with marketing, he knew how to sell, and indeed, he won the 3rd prize.[2] The story was published in _Fantastyka_ in 1986 and was enormously successful both with readers and critics. Sapkowski has created a cycle of tales based on the world of "The Witcher", comprising three collections of short stories and five novels. This cycle and his many other works have made him one of the best-known fantasy authors in Poland in the 1990s.[3]

The main character of "The Witcher" is Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter trained for this since childhood. Geralt exists in a morally ambiguous universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics. At the same time cynical and noble, Geralt has been compared to Raymond Chandler's signature character Philip Marlowe.[4] The world in which these adventures take place is heavily influenced by Slavic mythology.[5]


Translations of his books and other derivative works

Sapkowski's books have been translated into Czech, Georgian, Hungarian, Russian, Lithuanian, German, Spanish, French, Chinese, Ukrainian, Portuguese, Finnish, Slovak, Bulgarian, Serbian, English, Italian, Dutch, Turkish, Estonian, Romanian and Swedish. An English translation of _The Last Wish_ short story collection was published by Gollancz in 2007.[6] From 2008, the Witcher saga is published by Gollancz.[7] The English translation of Sapkowski's novel _Blood of Elves_ won the David Gemmell Legend Award in 2009.[8][9]

In 2001, a television series based on the _Witcher_ cycle was released in Poland and internationally, entitled _Wiedźmin_ (_The Hexer_). A film by the same title was compiled from excerpts of the television series but both have been critical and box office failures.

The Polish game developer, CD Projekt Red, created a role-playing game series based on _The Witcher_ universe. The first game, titled simply _The Witcher_, was first released in October 2007.[10] The sequel, _The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings_ was released in 2011.[11] The third game in the trilogy, _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_, was released in May 2015.[12]

In May 2017, _The Witcher_ was picked up by Netflix to be adapted as a television series. Sapkowski will serve as a creative consultant on the project.[13]

Sapkowski has won five Zajdel Awards, including three for short stories "Mniejsze zło" ("Lesser Evil") (1990), "Miecz przeznaczenia" ("Sword of Destiny") (1992) and "W leju po bombie" ("In a Bomb Crater") (1993), and two for the novels, _Krew elfów_ (_Blood of Elves_) (1994) and _Narrenturm_ (2002). He also won the Spanish Ignotus Award, best anthology, for _The Last Wish_ in 2003, and for _Muzykanci_ (_The Musicians_), best foreign short story, same year.
