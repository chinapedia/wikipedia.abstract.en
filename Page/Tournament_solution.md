A TOURNAMENT SOLUTION is a function that maps an oriented complete graph to a nonempty subset of its vertices. Tournament solutions originate from social choice theory,[1][2][3][4] but have also been considered in sports competition, game theory,[5] multi-criteria decision analysis, biology,[6][7] webpage ranking,[8] and dueling bandit problems.[9]

In the context of social choice theory, tournament solutions are closely related to Fishburn's C1 social choice functions.[10] 4-tournament.svg


Definition

A tournament (graph) T is a tuple (A,  ≻ ) where A is a set of vertices (called _alternatives_) and ≻ is a connex and asymmetric binary relation over the vertices. In social choice theory, the binary relation typically represents the pairwise majority comparison between alternatives.

A tournament solution is a function f that maps each tournament T = (A,  ≻ ) to a nonempty subset f(T) of the alternatives A (called the _choice set_[11]) and does not distinguish between isomorphic tournaments:

    If h : A → B is a graph isomorphism between two tournaments T = (A,  ≻ ) and $\widetilde{T} = (B,\widetilde{\succ})$, then a ∈ f(T) ⇔ h(a) ∈ f(T̃)


Examples

Common examples of tournament solutions are:[12][13]

-   Copeland's method
-   Top cycle
-   Slater set
-   Bipartisan set
-   Uncovered set
-   Banks set
-   Minimal covering set
-   Tournament equilibrium set
