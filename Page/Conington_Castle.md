Neale(1818)_p2.158_-_Connington_Castle,_Huntingdonshire.jpg CONINGTON CASTLE was a 16th-century house in Conington, Huntingdonshire, England, built for Sir Robert Cotton.[1] It was demolished in 1955 by the then owners, the Heathcote family.[2][3]

Sir John Cotton (1662–1702) never lived in the house and it fell into ruin. His grandson, Sir John Cotton (1702–1731), pulled down part of it, and converted the rest into a farmhouse. The politician John Heathcote restored and improved the house. His eldest son, John Moyer Heathcote, made substantial alterations in 1840.[4]
