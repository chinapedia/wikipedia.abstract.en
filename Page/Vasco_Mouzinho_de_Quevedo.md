Biography

Although Vasco Mouzinho de Quevedo e Castelo Branco is regarded as one of greatest Portuguese poets, very little is known about his personal life. He was born around 1570 and died around 1619.[1] He studied law at the University of Coimbra.[2] He wrote both lyrical poetry and epis poems.[3]


Works

Vasco Mouzinho de Quevedo wrote some short poems, for example sonnets,[4] but is known for long poems. He is regarded as an important successor of Luis de Camões.[5][6][7] His first big work is _Discurso sobre a Vida e Morte de Santa Isabel Rainha de Portugal_[8] which was published in Lisbon 1596 under the title _Discurso sobre a Vida e Morte de Santa Isabel Rainha de Portugal e Outras Várias Rimas_.[9] The work that is always connected with the name of Vasco Mouzinho de Quevedo is a long epic poem _Afonso Africano_ that was published in 1611. It narrates about Portuguese military expedition to Morocco led by king Afonso V who was later called the African for his great deeds. This war was seen and described as a modern crusade.[10]

Both mentioned poems are written in ottava rima, a stanza of eight lines with rhyme scheme abababcc[11] (in Portuguese oitava-rima).[12]
