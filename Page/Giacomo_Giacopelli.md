GIACOMO GIACOPELLI (27 January 1808 – 2 April 1893) was an Italian painter and scenic designer, active in Parma and Piacenza.

He was born in Parma, and trained under Giuseppe Boccaccio, whom he succeeded as scenographer for the Teatro di Parma from 1839 al 1851. Giacopelli collaborated from 1840-1844 with Nicola Aquila, and with Magnani (1848). In 1857, he was named instructor of perspective at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Parma. Together with Vincenzo Bertolotti and Giacomo Gelati they completed the decoration of the theater of Fiorenzuola d’Arda, which opened in 1853.

Few works of Giacopelli remain, including his depiction of the _Interior of the Duomo of Parma during the blessing of the flag of the National Guard_, and the _Atrium of the Palazzo della Pilotta_ in Parma. He painted some of the quadratura behind the mains altars of the churches of Santa Cristina and San Rocco.

Enrico Prati was one of his pupils.[1]
