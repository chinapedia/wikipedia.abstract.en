GIBSON is an unincorporated community in Pemiscot County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]

The community once contained a schoolhouse called Gibson School, which is now defunct.[2] The community and schoolhouse took their names from the nearby Gibson Bayou creek, which in turn was named after Newberry Gibson, an original owner of the site.[3]
