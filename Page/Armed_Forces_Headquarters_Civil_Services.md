The first CAO took over on the 1st of August, 1942.[6] In 1987, the post of Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), was upgraded to the level of a Joint Secretary (JS).[7][8]

Controversies

The Ministry Of Defence (MOD) on 18 October 2016 with the approval of Manohar Parrikar the Defence Ministers issued a letter that equated Armed Forces Headquarter Civil Service ranks and designations with officer ranks in the Indian Armed forces.[53] The new rank equivalences, apparently issued without Armed forces headquarters concurrence, was cause of resentment in the Armed Forces. [54] Armed forces main objections to MOD's 18 October letter was that AFHQCS time scale ranks/designation were shown equal to senior Armed Forces selection grade ranks.[55] For example, according to the 'equivalences' in the 18 October 2016 letter, AFHQCS officers with 9 years of services, called joint directors, are shown equal to colonels and their equivalents in Air Force (Group Captain) and Navy (Captain), all senior selection grade ranks with 16-20 years service.[56] [57] The 18 October 2016 letter was withdrawn in 2018 after considerable controversy that played out in the national media. [58]


Time Line

1 August 1942

In response to the demands of the World War II civilian employees in the War Department in Delhi are consolidated under the Office of Chief Administrative Officer (CAO). The first four CAO were brigadiers of the Indian Army.[59]

16 August 1947

Colonel Pritam Singh becomes the first Indian CAO.[60]

1 March 1968

Armed Forces Headquarters Civil Service constituted as group B Service from the existing staff under the Armed Forces headquarters and inter service organisations. The highest grade in the AFHQ Civil Service is Senior Staff Officer, analogous to a deputy secretary, with pay grade of Lt colonel.[61]

1987

The post of CAO is upgraded to Joint Secretary.[62]

2001

The Armed Forces Headquarters Civil Service Rules, 2001, superseded by Armed Forces Headquarters Civil Service Rules, 1968. Two Existing posts upgraded to JS, and 9 to Director.[63]

31 October 2002

AFHQCS adopts new designations of principal director (Senior Administrative grade); Joint Director (Senior Civilian Staff officer), analogous to civil service time scale post with 9 years; Deputy director (Deputy director), analogous to civil service time scale post with 4 years service; and section officer (Assistant civilian Officer) .[64]

15 April 2011

Principal Director posts increased from 1 to 3: one each in the Military Secretary’s branch, Adjutant General’s branch, and Directorate general of Quality assurance. 20 existing post upgraded to Director post, a post analogous to civil service time scale post with 13 years[65]

2016

Principal Director posts increased from 3 to 4. Directors posts to 21/22. All promotion on time scale basis. All Directors in the service are empaneled to be Principal directors.[66] Strength of AFHQ CS is 3235.[67]

16 October 20

Ministry Of Defence (MOD) issues a letter on the new rank equivalences between the Armed Forces Headquarter Civil Service and officers of the Indian Armed forces. The letter in its last para notes that it has the approval of Mohan Parrikar, the (Defence Minister). The memo titled _Equivalence between Armed forces Officers and officers of AFHQ Civil Service_ addressed to three services is signed by V Anandarajan(Indian Revenue Service1988), Joint Secretary and Chief administrative Officer (CAO), an office under the G.Mohan Kumar, IAS, Defence Secretary. In the letter AFHQCS officers with 9 years of services, called joint directors, are shown equal to full colonels and their equivalents in Air Force (Group Captain) and Navy (Captain), all selection grade senior ranks with 16-20 years service. This equivalence made Joint directors ( 9 years service) a time scale designation senior to Lt Colonels, Wing Commanders, Commanders of the Navy. Brigadiers, Commodores, and Air Commodores, all highly selective senior armed forces ranks, are shown equal to AFHQCS officer with 13 years service, called directors, a time scale designation.[68]The controversial letter it seems was circulated to the services headquarters but did not have their approval or concurrence. [69]

25 October 2016

The new rank equivalences in the 16 October memo was cause of much disappointment and resentment in the Armed forces which found voice through the media, and veteran groups. [70] Parrikar responding to outrage assured the armed forces that he would told reporter on the sidelines of a naval commanders’ conference that “Military officers will be on same platform as their civilian counterparts" Any discrepancy in the ranks would be corrected in a week, ” adding that government has assured the military that any disparity in rank structure of its officers with those in civil administration will be removed ". and that he "will scrutinise the orders to detect anomalies that threaten to widen the civil-military divide “.[71] Despite his assurances to the armed forces there was no follow up, and issue remained unresolved till he was replaced by Nirmala Sitharaman as the defense Minister.
