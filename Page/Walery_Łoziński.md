WALERY WŁADYSŁAW DANIEL ŁOZIŃSKI (1880–1944) was a Polish geographer and soil scientist known for introducing the concept of periglaciation into geomorphology in 1909.[1] Łoziński extended the work of Swedish geologist Johan Gunnar Andersson who had written about periglacial phenomena in Bjørnøya and the Falkland Islands.[2] The concept of "periglaciation" was the subject of an intensive discussion at the 1910 International Geological Congress held in Stockholm.[3]
