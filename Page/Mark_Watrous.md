Biography

Loudermilk (1995–2004)

In 1995,[4] friends Davey Ingersoll (vocals, guitar), Mark Watrous (guitar), Shane Middleton (bass) and Issac Carpenter (drums) formed the hard rock quartet Loudermilk[5][6] in Tri-Cities, Washington.[7][8] They released their own album, _Man with Gun Kills Three!_, independently in 1998.[9][10][11] After hearing an unauthorized demo,[12] American Recordings subsequently signed the group.[13][14] Commenting on the demoes, Ingersoll stated that the demo was made just to get songs down and that "It was something [he] didn't even want people to hear".[15] Despite touring with groups such as Mötley Crüe and Megadeth,[16][17][18] they were dropped from the label.[19][20] Speaking about the group being dropped from the label, Ingersoll stated:

DreamWorks Records signed them in early 2002.[21][22][23] Several months later, they recorded and released their first official major label album, _The Red Record_.[24][25][26][27]

Gosling (2004–2006)

In 2004, Loudermilk changed their name to Gosling,[28] after changing their musical style, retaining all members with Watrous switching from guitar to keyboards.[29] Influenced by the likes of Sunny Day Real Estate,[30] The Smashing Pumpkins,[31] Pink Floyd[32] and Queen,[33][34] they released the _Gosling EP_ through The Control Group in August 2004.[35] Earlier in the year, they supported Velvet Revolver at The Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood, California.[36] They released their debut full-length _Here Is..._ in 2006 through V2[37] and went on to tour with Rose Hill Drive.[38]

A cover of David Bowie's "Cat People (Putting Out Fire)" was included on the soundtrack to the film _Underworld: Evolution_ in 2006.[39]
