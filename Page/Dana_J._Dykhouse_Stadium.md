The DANA J. DYKHOUSE STADIUM is an American football stadium in Brookings, South Dakota, United States, on the campus of South Dakota State University. It is the home venue of the South Dakota State Jackrabbits football team. The stadium, which was constructed in phases on the previous Coughlin-Alumni Stadium site, seats 19,340 spectators. The stadium was funded through private gifts and long-term revenue streams, including expanded club seats, loge boxes, and a premium suite level. Lead gifts totaling $12.5 million from Sioux Falls banker Dana Dykhouse and philanthropist T. Denny Sanford were announced in October 2013. The stadium opened in 2016.

The stadium project was approved by the state Legislature during the 2014 session and signed into law by Governor Dennis Daugaard. Construction began in the fall of 2014 with the east and south stands completed in August 2015. The remainder of the project was finished by the next football season in August 2016.[1] Dana J. Dykhouse Stadium replaced old Coughlinâ€“Alumni Stadium.
