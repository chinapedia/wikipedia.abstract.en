The ILHAS QUEIMADA PEQUENA E QUEIMADA GRANDE AREA OF RELEVANT ECOLOGICAL INTEREST () is an area of relevant ecological interest covering two Atlantic islands off the coast of the state of São Paulo, Brazil.


Location

The Ilhas Queimada Pequena e Queimada Grande Area of Relevant Ecological Interest (ARIE) is in the municipality of Itanhaém, São Paulo. It has an area of . It covers the Queimada Pequena and Queimada Grande islands in the Atlantic Ocean. The main island is about from the coast, and has a lighthouse for navigation. There is no beach and no drinking water. The conservation unit is part of the Lagamar Mosaic.


History

The Ilhas Queimada Pequena e Queimada Grande Area of Relevant Ecological Interest was created by federal decree 91.887 of 5 November 1985. The consultative council was created on 15 May 2012. The ARIE is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). It is classed as IUCN protected area category IV (habitat/species management area). Educational tourism and other non-predatory activities are to be controlled in accordance with the provisions of the National Environmental Council (CONAMA).


Environment

Vegetation on the main island is dense shrubs. Fishermen and other visitors, including the builders of the naval lighthouse at the start of the 20th century, brought in invasive grasses that now cover of the island. The grasses do not provide a habitat for the endemic species and are highly inflammable.

There are two wrecked ships on the west side. The waters are very clear, with visibility up to , and are often used by amateur fishers and divers. There are various species including groupers, gray parrotfish (_Sparisoma axillare_) and Cubera snapper (_Lutjanus cyanopterus_). Larger fish are found on the Parcel de Fora to the south at depths from . Over-fishing is a problem, and creation of a national marine park around the island has been proposed for several years.

The main island is also called the Ilha das Cobras due to the many golden lanceheads (_Bothrops insularis_), a large and venomous pit viper, so landing is not advised. On the mainland the snake's relatives mainly feed on rodents. The island was separated from the mainland by rising sea levels about 9,000 years ago, and the rodent population disappeared, so the snake adapted to eating birds. Its main prey are the migratory white-crested elaenia (_Elaenia albiceps_), yellow-legged thrush (_Turdus flavipes_) and double-collared seedeater (_Sporophila caerulescens_), all of which visit only at certain times of year. Other species include the tiny frog _Scinax peixotoi_, the lizards _Mabuya macrorhyncha_ and _Colobodactylus taunayi_ and the amphisbaena _Amphisbaena hogei_ and _Leposternon microcephalus_.

Protected species on or around the islands include the golden lancehead, Sauvage's snail-eater (_Dipsas albifrons_), green sea turtle (_Chelonia mydas_), hawksbill sea turtle (_Eretmochelys imbricata_), La Plata dolphin (_Pontoporia blainvillei_), smoothback angelshark (_Squatina oculata_), angular angel shark (_Squatina guggenheim_) and royal tern (_Thalasseus maximus_).
