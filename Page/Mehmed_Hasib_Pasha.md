Biography

He was the son of Mehmed Emin Efendi, who died in 1220 AH (1805/1806). He was a scribe in the Ministry of the Sultan's Treasury (_hazine-i hassa_, also translated as "the Privy Purse") during the construction of the Nusretiye Mosque. In 1241 AH (1825/1826) he was promoted to the rank of _hacegan_ and appointed _topçular katibi_. Later he was appointed _kapı kethüdası_ of Baghdad.

Hasib was appointed as the first _nazir_ (minister) of the newly created Ministry of Evkaf in Şaban 1250 AH (December 1834). On 28 Ramazan 1252 AH (c. 6 January 1837) he was promoted to the rank of _vezir_ and appointed Minister of the Privy Purse. In Muharram 1254 AH (April 1838) Hasib was concurrently appointed _nazir_ of the Evkaf Ministry, which in that year had been combined with the Ministry of the Imperial Arsenal (_tophan-i amire_).

In Receb 1255 AH (September/October 1839) following the succession of Abdülmecid to the throne, Hasib was discharged and appointed Vali of Salonica. He was dismissed from the governorship a few months later, in Zilhicce (February/March 1840).

In mid-1258 AH (1842) he was appointed Inspector General (_müfettişi_) for Anatolia. One month later he was again made a member of the Meclis-i Vala.

On 23 Receb 1260 (c. 8 August 1844) he was appointed Minister of Evkaf a third time.

In Şevval 1264 AH (September 1848) he was appointed Vali of Jeddah to replace Mehmet Şerif Pasha. He arrived in the beginning of Muharrem 1265 AH (November 1848) and was dismissed in 1850. Between 1850 and 1861 he was appointed successively to several posts, as listed below:
