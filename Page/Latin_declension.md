LATIN DECLENSION is the set of patterns according to which Latin words are declined, or have their endings altered to show grammatical case, number and gender. Nouns, pronouns, and adjectives are declined (verbs are conjugated), and a given pattern is called a declension. There are five declensions, which are numbered and grouped by ending and grammatical gender. For simple declension paradigms, visit the Wiktionary appendices: first declension, second declension, third declension, fourth declension, fifth declension. Each noun follows one of the five declensions, but some irregular nouns have exceptions.

Adjectives are of two kinds: those like 'good' belong to the first and second declensions, using first-declension endings for the feminine, and second-declension for masculine and neuter. Other adjectives such as belong to the third declension. There are no fourth- or fifth-declension adjectives.

Pronouns are also of two kinds, the personal pronouns such as 'I' and 'you ()', which have their own irregular declension, and the third-person pronouns such as 'this' and 'that' which can generally be used either as pronouns or adjectivally. These latter decline in a similar way to the first and second noun declensions, but there are differences; for example the genitive singular ends in _-īus_ or _-ius_ instead of _-ī_ or _-ae_.

The cardinal numbers 'one', 'two', and 'three' also have their own declensions (_ūnus_ has genitive _-īus_ like a pronoun), and there are also numeral adjectives such as 'a pair, two each', which decline like ordinary adjectives.


Grammatical cases

A complete Latin noun declension consists of up to seven grammatical cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative and locative. However, the locative is limited to few nouns: generally names of cities, small islands and a few other words.

The case names are often abbreviated to the first three letters.

The Latin cases have usually been given in the order –––––(–) in Britain and many Commonwealth countries since the publication of Benjamin Hall Kennedy's _Latin Primer_ (1866). This order reflects the tendencies of different cases to share similar endings (see below). For a discussion of other sequences taught elsewhere, see below.

However, some didactic approaches or schools teach it in the order ––––– or –––––, the order also used before the Latin Primer by Benjamin Hall Kennedy. This order is used in _The School and University Eton Latin Grammar_ (1861),[1] with the ablative case always cited last, and a similar one is used in grammars of Ancient Greek (except without the ablative case, which does not occur in Greek), and has been retained by some modern didactic approaches to allow comparison of Latin and Greek.[2]

Meanings and functions of the various cases

Nominative

It generally marks the sentence subject, or its attributes.

    _AUGUSTUS IMPERĀTOR Imperiī Rōmānī fuit_.
    'Caesar Augustus was the Emperor of the Roman Empire'.

However, there are other uses within the nominative case:

    _URBS RŌMA CAPUT mundī vōcātur_.
    'The city of Rome is called the capital of the world'.

On this sentence, there is a denomination clause (_Rōma_), and a subject predicative clause (_caput_).

Vocative

It is used to address someone or something in direct speech. In English, this function is expressed by intonation or punctuation: "_Mary_, are you going to the store?" or "Mary!" In most declensions, the vocative singular form is identical to the nominative singular form; for example, to say "sailor!" the noun has the vocative form _nauta_. There are a few exceptions. For the masculine singular second declension nouns, _-us_ and _-ius_ become _-e_ and _-ī_, respectively. For example, becomes _Brute_ (English "Brutus!"). Similarly, becomes _Vergilī_ (English "Virgil!"). However, nouns may preserve as _-us_ and _-ius_ in presence of imperative verbs (_Venī huc, Brutus_; or _Dīc nōbīs fabulam, Virgilius_) Finally, in Greek masculine first declension names becomes _Aenēā_ (English "Aeneas!"). In the plural the vocative is always identical to the nominative. In this article, it is assumed the nominative and vocative cases always merge, unless if mentioned on the paradigm tables.[3]

Accusative

It generally marks the direct object of a transitive verb, that is, the object produced on the verb action.

    _Scīpiōnis Āfricānī exercitus incurret HOSTEM_.
    Scipio Africanus's army attacks the enemy.

However, the accusative case may also have other functions:

-   ACCUSATIVE OF EXTENT: indicates the period of time during which the action of the verb is prolonged:

    _TRECENTŌS ANNŌS Rōmanī tōtum Mare Mediterrāneum imperāvērunt_.
    "the Romans controlled the whole Mediterranean Sea for three hundred years".

-   ACCUSATIVE OF DIRECTION: indicates direction of movement. Towns and small islands do not use any prepositions, while most other nouns use the preposition _in_ (movement into a place) or _ad_ (movement to a place).

    _RŌMAM rediit_
    "he returned to Rome"
    _Lēgātus in HISPĀNIAM missus est_
    "The Legatus was sent to Spain"
    _Mīlitēs ad OPPĪDUM appropinquant_
    "The soldiers approach the fortress"

-   IN INFINITIVE COMPLETIVE SENTENCES: the subject of a dependent clause is declined in accusative, while the verb appears in infinitive. This is because the whole subordinate sentence is a direct complement of the verb, called as the "main". It is widespread with verbs like to seem and to say.

    _Dīcō TĒ priōre nocte vēnisse in M. Laecae domum_
    "I say THAT YOU, last night, went to Marcus Laeca's house"

-   WITH CERTAIN PREPOSITIONS:[4]

    _Fretum Gādītānum partem maris inter HISPĀNIAM et ĀFRICAM est_
    "The Strait of Gibraltar is the part of the sea between Spain and Africa"

-   AS A PREDICATIVE CLAUSE OF THE DIRECT CLAUSE: words complementing the direct object are also accusative.

    _Pauperēs existimant dīvitēs FĒLĪCĒS_
    "Poor people consider rich people to be happy"[5]

-   EXCLAMATORY ACCUSATIVE:

    _MĒ MISERAM!_
    "Poor me!"[6]

Genitive case

It generally marks the noun name complement. In most of cases, there is a relation in which the noun is the possessor and the genitive case is the possessed object. The use of the genitive case can be divided between the adjectival and adverbial uses.

Adjectival uses

-   POSSESSIVE GENITIVE: indicates a possessive relationship:

    _castra HOSTIUM_ or _HOSTIUM castra_
    "The camp of the enemy"

-   SUBJECTIVE GENITIVE: indicates a relation between genitive and noun similar to that between subject and verb:

    _CAESARIS mors_
    "Caesar's death" (compare the sentence "Caesar died")

-   OBJECTIVE GENITIVE: indicates a relation between noun and genitive similar to that between verb and object:

    _rēctor DEUM_
    "ruler of the gods" (compare the sentence "he rules the gods")

-   PARTITIVE GENITIVE: indicates that the noun is part of the thing referred to by the genitive:

    _pars Galliae_
    "part of Gaul"

-   GENITIVE OF DEFINITION: where the genitive defines the noun:

    ''virtūs IŪSTITIAE
    "the virtue justice"

-   DESCRIPTIVE GENITIVE: describes an object or person in terms of its quality:

    _vir MAGNĪ INGENIĪ_
    "a man of great ingenuity"

-   GENITIVE OF PRICE: describes the value or the price of something:

    _QUANTĪ ēmit?_
    "For how much did he buy it?"

Adverbial uses

-   with certain memory related verbs ("to forget", "remember", etc.):

    _Dominus oblītus est MEĪ_.
    "God has forgotten about me."

-   with certain verbs such as _potior_, _vescor_ and _opus est_ ("to possess", "to eat" and "to be necessary", respectively):

    _TOTĪUS GALLIAE sēsē potīrī posse sperant_
    "they hope to be able to gain possession of the whole of Gaul"

-   with verbs meaning "to fill", or adjectives with the meaning of "full".

    _hic saccus plēnus est PIRŌRUM_.
    "this bag is full of pears".

-   with verbs having the meaning "to shame", "to bore":

    _Taedet mē HUIUS QUOTĪDIĀNĪ MUNDĪ_
    "I am tired of this everyday world"

-   with verbs referring a legal process, like "to accuse":

    _patrem accusāvit ADULTERIĪ OCCULTĪ_
    "he accused the father of secret adultery"

Dative case

It generally marks indirect object.

    _Pater PUERŌ librum dōnat_
    "The father gives the book to the child"[7]

-   VERBAL REGIME DATIVE: Makes up part of some adjectives, being thus, the regime object. Related to verbs like "to obey", "to pass" or adjectives with meanings like "similar".

    _Quam similis SŌLI est, Naevia, noster amor!_
    "How similar to the Sun is, oh Naevia, our love!"

-   POSSESSIVE DATIVE: it denotes possession by part of the dative noun.

    _CAESARĪ multī inimīcī erant_.
    "Caesar had many enemies". (literallly "There were many enemies for Caesar")

-   PURPOSE DATIVE: indicates the purpose of the action:

    _Non omnes mīlitēs GLŌRIAE pugnant_.
    "Not all soldiers fight for glory".

-   DOUBLE DATIVE: a mixture of possessive and purpose datives.

    _Ipsum bellum est MIHI CŪRAE_
    "This war is a concern for me"

-   ORIGIN DATIVE: indicates a point of view.

    _Vir bonus REGĪ vidētur_.
    "This man seems good to the king".

-   AGENT OBJECT DATIVE: in combination with the gerundive, it is used to indicate the action doer:

    _Haec NŌBĪS agenda sunt_
    "These things must be done by us"

-   BENEFICIAL DATIVE: indicates for whom the action is:

    _GRAECĪS terrās colimus_
    "We till the lands for the Greeks"

-   ETHICAL DATIVE: it emphasizes the person interested in the action, usually with affective implications:

    _Quid mihi Celsus agit?_
    "What is Celsus doing to me?" (indicating there is a special interest)

Ablative case

In Latin, the ablative case is the most flexible of all cases. It could be summarized as being a complement of circumstances, either of place, time, etc. Several uses of the ablative case can be translated as adverbs: _cum celeritate_ ("quickly", literally "with speed"). The ablative case merges three Proto-indoeuropean cases: the separative case, the instrumental case and the locative case.

-   PLACE ABLATIVE: indicates the action from and/or where the action was done (note: the accusative case is used to indicate to where the action is done)

    _Hannibal, fīlius Hamilcaris, CARTHĀGINE nātus est_.

    "The Allobroges, positioning guards around the Rhône, defend their borders with vigilance and energy"[8]

-   TIME ABLATIVE: indicates the time frame when the action is done.

    _Nē quis tamen īgnōrāret, quibus in locīs Caesar exercitusque EŌ TEMPORE fuissent_ [...]
    "For no one ignore where Cesar and his army were in that time [...]"

-   ABSOLUTE ABLATIVE: indicates the circunstances the action is produced.

    _URBE CAPTĀ, Aenēas fugit_
    "[One] the city [is] captured, Aeneas flees out"

-   EXPECTING CIRCUNSTANCES ABLATIVE: just like the absolute ablative, but the circunstances "wait" for the action.

    _Cum MAGNŌ CLĀMŌRE cīvium ad urbem perveniunt_.
    "With a great clamour, they arrive to the city by part of the population".

    "Atticus was adopted by Caecilius".
    _Populus MĪLITIĀ atque INOPIĀ urgēbātur_.
    "The people were overwhelmed by the military and misery".

    _Vīlius argentum est AURŌ, VIRTŪTIBUS aurum_.
    "Silver is less valious than gold, and gold [is less valious] than virtue".

-   CAUSE ABLATIVE: indicates the action cause.

Locative

It expresses the place where an action is performed. In early Latin the locative case had extensive use, but in Classical Latin the locative case was very rarely used, applying only to the names of cities and small islands and to a few other isolated words. For this purpose, the Romans considered all the islands they would know (in most of cases, European islands) to be small except for Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Crete, Cyprus, Britain and Ireland; in general, small island cities like Ithaca and Thēra would be the only ones using the locative case. Much of the case's function had been absorbed into the ablative. In the first and second declension singular, the locative is identical to the genitive singular, and in the third declension singular it is identical to the dative singular. For plural nouns of all declensions, the locative is also identical to the ablative. The few fourth- and fifth-declension place names would also use the ablative form for the locative case. However, a few nouns use the locative instead of a preposition: → _bellī_ 'at war'; → _domī_ 'at home'; → _rūrī_ 'in the country'; → _humī_ 'on the ground'; → _mīlitiae_ 'in military service, in the field'; → _focī_ 'at the hearth', 'at the center of the community'. In archaic times, the locative singular of third declension nouns was interchangeable between the ablative and dative but, in the Augustan period, the use of the dative became fixed. The locative cannot express being located at multiple locations; plural forms only exist because certain proper names such as Athēnae happen to be plural (pluralia tantum). "[He/She/It] is at home" can be expressed by "Est domī" using the locative, but "They are at their (individual and separate) homes" cannot be expressed by the locative (_Sunt in domibus suī_). Adjectives do not have the locative form case.[10]

Syncretism

Syncretism, where one form in a paradigm shares the ending of another form in the paradigm, is common in Latin. The following are the most notable patterns of syncretism:

Gender-specific

-   For pure Latin neuter nouns, the nominative singular, vocative singular, and accusative singular are identical; and the nominative plural, vocative plural, and accusative plural all end in _-a_ (both of these features are inherited from Proto-Indo-European, and so are not true syncretism as the case endings were never attested as separate in the first place).

Case-specific

-   The vocative form is always the same as the nominative in the plural, and usually the same as the nominative in the singular except for second-declension masculine nouns ending in _-us_ and a few nouns of Greek origin. For example, the vocative of the first-declension is _Aenēā_.
-   The genitive singular is the same as the nominative plural in first-, second-, and fourth-declension masculine and feminine pure Latin nouns.
-   The dative singular is the same as the genitive singular in first- and fifth-declension pure Latin nouns.
-   The dative is always the same as the ablative in the plural, and in the singular in the second declension, the third-declension full _i_-stems (i.e. neuter _i_-stems, adjectives), and fourth-declension neuters.
-   The dative, ablative, and locative are always identical in the plural.
-   The locative is identical to the ablative in the fourth and fifth declensions.


History of cases

Old Latin had essentially two patterns of endings. One pattern was shared by the first and second declensions, which derived from the Proto-Indo-European thematic declension. The other pattern was used by the third, fourth and fifth declensions, and derived from the athematic PIE declension.


Nouns

There are two principal parts for Latin nouns: the nominative singular and the genitive singular. Each declension can be unequivocally identified by the ending of the genitive singular (-_ae_, -_i_, -_is_, -_ūs_, -_ei_). The stem of the noun can be identified by the form of the genitive singular as well.

There are five declensions for Latin nouns:

 First declension (_a_ stems)

Nouns of this declension usually end in _-a_ in the nominative singular and are mostly feminine, e.g. ('road') and ('water'). There is a small class of masculine exceptions generally referring to occupations, e.g. ('poet'), ('farmer') and ('sailor').

The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is _a_. The nominative singular form consists of the stem and the ending _-a_, and the genitive singular form is the stem plus _-ae_.

               First declension paradigm
  ------------ ---------------------------
  Singular     Plural
  Nominative   -a
  Accusative   -am
  Genitive     -ae
  Dative       -īs
  Ablative     -ā

+------------+-------------------+------------+
|            |                   |            |
+------------+-------------------+------------+

The locative endings for the first declension are _-ae_ (singular) and _-īs_ (plural), similar to the genitive singular and ablative plural, as in __ 'in war' and __ 'at Athens'.[11]

 First declension Greek nouns

The first declension also includes three types of Greek loanwords, derived from Ancient Greek's Alpha Declension. They are declined irregularly in the singular, but sometimes treated as native Latin nouns, e.g. nominative ('athlete') instead of the original _athlētĒS_. Archaic (Homeric) first declension Greek nouns and adjectives had been formed in exactly the same way as in Latin: _nephelēgerétA Zeus_ ('Zeus the cloud-gatherer') had in classical Greek become _nephelēgerétĒS_.

For full paradigm tables and more detailed information, see the Wiktionary appendix First declension.

 Second declension (_o_ stems)

The second declension is a large group of nouns consisting of mostly masculine nouns like ('horse') and ('boy') and neuter nouns like ('fort'). There are several small groups of feminine exceptions, including names of gemstones, plants, trees, and some towns and cities.

In the nominative singular, most masculine nouns consist of the stem and the ending _-us_, although some end in _-er_, which is not necessarily attached to the complete stem. Neuter nouns generally have a nominative singular consisting of the stem and the ending _-um_. However, every second-declension noun has the ending _-ī_ attached as a suffix to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is _o_.

: Neuter

The locative endings for the second declension are _-ī_ (singular) and _-īs_ (plural); "at Corinth", "at Milan", and "at Philippi".[12]

 Second-declension _-ius_ and _-ium_ nouns

Nouns ending in _-ius_ and _-ium_ have a genitive singular in _-ī_ in earlier Latin, which was regularized to _-iī_ in the later language. Masculine nouns in _-ius_ have a vocative singular in _-ī_ at all stages. These forms in _-ī_ are stressed on the same syllable as the nominative singular, sometimes in violation of the usual Latin stress rule. For example, the genitive and vocative singular _Vergilī_ (from ) is pronounced _Vergílī_, with stress on the penult, even though it is short.[13] In Old Latin, however, the vocative was declined regularly, using _-ie_ instead, e.g. _fīlie_ "[Oh] son", archaic vocative of _fīlius_.

There is no contraction of _-iī(s)_ in plural forms and in the locative.

+------------+--------+-----------+
| Ablative   |        |           |
+------------+--------+-----------+

In the older language, nouns ending with _-vus_, _-quus_ and _-vum_ take _o_ rather than _u_ in the nominative and accusative singular. For example, ('slave') could be _servos_, accusative _servom_.

 Second-declension _-r_ nouns

Some masculine nouns of the second declension end in _-er_ or _-ir_ in the nominative singular. For such nouns, the genitive singular must be learned to see if the _e_ is dropped. For example, ('father-in-law') keeps its _e_. However, the noun ('teacher') drops its _e_ in the genitive singular. Nouns with _-ir_ in the nominative singular, such as , never drop the _i_.

The declension of second-declension _-r_ nouns is identical to that of the regular second declension, being the vocative suffix _-e_ optional.

For declension tables of second-declension nouns, see the corresponding Wiktionary appendix.

 Second-declension Greek nouns

The second declension contains two types of masculine Greek nouns and one form of neuter Greek noun. These nouns are irregular only in the singular, as are their first-declension counterparts. Greek nouns in the second declension are derived from the Omicron declension.

Some Greek nouns may also be declined as normal Latin nouns. For example, can appear as _theātrum_.

 Irregular forms

Deus

The inflection of ('god') is irregular. The vocative singular of _deus_ is not attested in Classical Latin. In Ecclesiastical Latin the vocative of _Deus_ ('God') is _Deus_.

In poetry, _-um_ may substitute _-ōrum_ as the genitive plural ending.

Virus

The Latin word _vīrus_ (the _ī_ indicates a long _i_) means "1. slimy liquid, slime; 2. poison, venom", denoting the venom of a snake. This Latin word is probably related to the Greek (_ios_) meaning "venom" or "rust" and the Sanskrit word __ meaning "toxic, poison".[14]

Since _vīrus_ in antiquity denoted something uncountable, it was a mass noun. Mass nouns pluralize only under special circumstances, hence the non-existence of plural forms in the texts.[15]

In Neo-Latin, a plural form is necessary in order to express the modern concept of ‘viruses’, which leads to the following declension:[16][17][18]

+------------+----------------------+

 Third declension (_i_ and consonant stems)

The third declension is the largest group of nouns. The nominative singular of these nouns may end in _-a_,_-e_, _-ī_, _-ō_, _-y_, _-c_, _-l_, _-n_, _-r_, _-s_, _-t_, or _-x_. This group of nouns includes masculine, neuter, and feminine nouns. Examples are ('river'), ('flower'), and ('peace'). Each noun has the ending _-is_ as a suffix attached to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. Masculine, feminine and neuter nouns each have their own special nominative singular endings. For instance, many masculine nouns end in _-or_ (, 'love'). Many feminine nouns end in _-īx_ (, 'phoenix'), and many neuter nouns end in _-us_ with an _r_ stem in the oblique cases ( 'burden'; 'time').

The locative endings for the third declension are _-ī_ or _-e_ (singular) and _-ibus_ (plural), as in 'in the country' and 'at Tralles'.[19]

 Third declension _i_-stem nouns

The third declension also has a set of nouns that are declined differently. They are called _I_-STEMS. _i_-stems are broken into two subcategories: pure and mixed. Pure _i_-stems are indicated by the parisyllabic rule or special neuter endings. Mixed _i_-stems are indicated by the double consonant rule.

Masculine and feminine
    PARISYLLABIC RULE: Some masculine and feminine third-declension _i_-stem nouns have the same number of syllables in the genitive as they do in the nominative. For example: ('stream'). The nominative ends in _-is_.
    DOUBLE CONSONANT RULE: The rest of the masculine and feminine third-declension _i_-stem nouns have two consonants before the _-is_ in the genitive singular. For example: ('part').

Neuter
    SPECIAL NEUTER ENDING: Neuter third-declension _i_-stems have no rule. However, all of them end in _-al_, _-ar_ or _-e_. For example: ('animal'); ('spoon'); ('sea').

Pure _i_-stems may exhibit peculiar endings in both singular and plural. Mixed _i_-stems employ normal (consonant) 3rd declension endings in the singular but _i_-stem endings in the plural.

The rules for determining _i_-stems from non-_i_-stems and mixed _i_-stems should be thought of more as guidelines than rules: even among the Romans themselves, the categorization of a third-declension word as an _i_-stem or non-_i_-stem was quite fluid. The result is that many words that _should_ be _i_-stems according to the parisyllabic and consonant stem rules actually are not, such as ('dog') or ('youth'). By the parisyllabic rule, _canis_ should be a masculine _i_-stem and thus differ from the non-_i_-stems by having an extra _-i-_ in the plural genitive form: *_canium_. In reality, the plural genitive of _canis_ is _canum_, the form of a non-_i_-stem. This fluidity even in Roman times results in much more uncertainty in Medieval Latin, as scholars were trying to imitate what was fluid to begin with.

Peculiarities

In the third declension, there are four irregular nouns.

 Fourth declension (_u_ stems)

The fourth declension is a group of nouns consisting of mostly masculine words such as ('wave') and ('port') with a few feminine exceptions, including ('hand'). The fourth declension also includes several neuter nouns including ('knee'). Each noun has the ending _-ūs_ as a suffix attached to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is _u_, but the declension is otherwise very similar to the third-declension _i_ stems.

+------------+---------------------+----------+

In the dative and ablative plural, _-ibus_ is sometimes replaced with _-ubus_. This is so for only a few nouns, such as , ('limbs').

The locative endings for the fourth declension are _-ī_ (singular), and probably _-ū_ (singular) as well; "at [the] senate", "at home".

('house, dwelling, building, home, native place, family, household, race') is an irregular noun, mixing fourth and second declension nouns at the same time (especially in literature). However, in practice, it is generally declined as a regular _-us_ stem fourth declension noun (except by the ablative singular and accusative plural, using _-ō_ and _-ōs_ instead).[20]

 Fifth declension (_e_ stems)

The fifth declension is a small group of nouns consisting of mostly feminine nouns like ('affair, matter, thing') and _diēs, diēī_ ('day'; but in names of days). Each noun has either the ending _-ēī_ or _-eī_ as a suffix attached to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form.

Nouns ending in _-iēs_ have long _ēī_ in the dative and genitive, while nouns ending in a consonant + _-ēs_ have short _eī_ in these cases.

The locative ending of the fifth declension was _-ē_ (singular only), identical to the ablative singular, as in ('today').


Pronouns

Personal pronouns

The first and second persons are irregular, and both pronouns are indeclinable for gender; and the third person reflexive pronoun sē, suī always refers back to the subject, regardless of whether the subject is singular or plural.

The genitive forms , , , , are used as complements in certain grammatical constructions, whereas , are used with a partitive meaning ('[one] of us', '[one] of you'). To express possession, the possessive pronouns (essentially adjectives) , , , are used, declined in the first and second declensions to agree in number and case with the thing possessed, e.g. _pater meus_ 'my father', _māter mea_ 'my mother'. The vocative singular masculine of _meus_ is _mī_: _mī Attice_ 'my dear Atticus'.[21]

Usually, to show the ablative of accompaniment, would be added to the ablative form. However, with personal pronouns (first and second person), the reflexive and the interrogative, _-cum_ is added onto the end of the ablative form. That is: 'with me', 'with us', 'with you', , and (sometimes ).

Pronouns have also an emphatic form bi using the suffix _-met_ (, /, , ), used in all cases, except by the genitive plural forms.

In accusative case, the forms _mēmē_ and _tētē_ exist as emphatic, but they are not widely used.

has a possessive adjective: , meaning 'his/her/its/their own':

    _Patrem SUUM numquam vīderat._ (Cicero)[22]
    "He had never seen HIS [own] father."

When 'his' or 'her' refers to someone else, not the subject, the genitive pronoun _eius_ (as well as _eōrum_ and _eārum_) 'of him' is used instead of _suus_:

    _Fit obviam Clodiō ante fundum EIUS._ (Cicero)[23]
    "He met Clodius in front of THE LATTER'S farm."

When one sentence is embedded inside another with a different subject, _sē_ and _suus_ can refer to either subject:

    _Patrēs conscrīptī ... lēgātōs in Bīthȳniam miserunt quī ab rēge peterent, nē inimīcissimum SUUM SECUM haberet SIBIque dēderet._ (Nepos)[24]
    "The senators ... sent ambassadors to Bithynia, who were to ask the king not to keep THEIR greatest enemy WITH HIM but hand him over TO THEM."

For the third-person pronoun 'he', see below.

Demonstrative pronouns and adjectives

Relative, demonstrative and indefinite pronouns are generally declined like first and second declension adjectives, with the following differences:

-   the nominatives are often irregular
-   the genitive singular ends in _-īus_ rather than _-ae_ or _-ī_.
-   the dative singular ends in _-ī_: rather than _-ae_ or _-ō_.

These differences characterize the pronominal declension, and a few special adjectives ( 'whole', 'alone', 'one', 'no', 'another', 'another [of two]', etc.) are also declined according to this pattern.

All demonstrative, relative, and indefinite pronouns in Latin can also be used adjectivally, with some small differences; for example in the interrogative pronoun, 'who?' and 'what?' are usually used for the pronominal form, and 'which?' for the adjectival form.

Third person pronoun

The weak demonstrative pronoun , , 'that' also serves as the third person pronoun 'he, she, it':

+--------------+
| Third person |
+--------------+
| he, she, it  |
+--------------+
| Singular     |
+--------------+
| Masculine    |

| Nominative   |

+--------------+
| Dative       |
+--------------+
| Ablative     |
+--------------+
|              |
+--------------+

This pronoun is also often used adjectivally, e.g. _is homo_ 'that man', _ea pecunia_ 'that money'. It has no possessive adjective; the genitive is used instead: _pater eius_ 'his/her father'; _pater eōrum_ 'their father'.

Declension of _īdem_

The pronoun or pronominal adjective means 'the same'. It is derived from _is_ with the suffix _-dem_. However, some forms have been assimilated.

Interrogative pronouns

The interrogative pronouns are used strictly for asking questions. They are distinct from the relative pronoun and the interrogative adjective (which is declined like the relative pronoun). Interrogative pronouns rarely occur in the plural. The plural interrogative pronouns are the same as the plural relative pronouns.

Adjectives

First- and second-declension adjectives

First- and second-declension adjective are inflected in the masculine, the feminine and the neuter; the masculine form typically ends in _-us_ (although some end in _-er_, see below), the feminine form ends in _-a_, and the neuter form ends in _-um_. Therefore, some adjectives are given like .

It is important noticing that _-ius_ ending adjectives use the vocative _-ie_ (_ebrie_, "[Oh] drunk man", vocative of _ebrius_), just as in Old Latin all _-ius_ nouns did (_fīlie_, "[Oh] son", archaic vocative of _fīlius_).

First- and second-declension _-r_ adjectives

Some first- and second-declension adjectives' masculine form end in _-er_. As with second-declension _-r_ nouns, some adjectives retain the _e_ throughout inflection, and some omit it. omits its _e_ while keeps it.

First and second declension pronominal adjectives

Nine first and second declension pronominal adjectives are irregular in the genitive and the dative in all genders. They can be remembered by using the mnemonic acronym _ūnus nauta_. They are:

-   'any';

-   'no, none';

-   'which [of two], either';

-   'sole, alone';

-   'neither';

-   'another' (the genitive singular _alīus_ is often replaced by _alterīus_ or by _aliēnus_ 'of another');[27]

-   'one';

-   'whole';

-   'other [of two]'.

Third-declension adjectives

Third-declension adjectives are normally declined like third-declension _i_-stem nouns, except for the fact they usually have _-ī_ rather than _-e_ in the ablative singular (unlike _i_-stem nouns, in which only pure i-stems have _-ī_). Some adjectives, however, like the one-ending ('old, aged'), have _-e_ in the ablative singular, _-um_ in the genitive plural, and _-a_ in the nominative and accusative neuter plural.

Third-declension adjectives with one ending

These have a single nominative ending for all genders, although as usual the endings for the other cases vary. As with nouns, a genitive is given for the purpose of showing the inflection.

Third-declension adjectives with two endings

Third-declension adjectives that have two endings have one form for the masculine and feminine, and a separate form for the neuter. The ending for the masculine and feminine is _-is_, and the ending for the neuter is _-e_. It is not necessary to give the genitive, as it is the same as the nominative masculine singular.

Third-declension adjectives with three endings

Third-declension adjectives with three endings have three separate nominative forms for all three genders. Like third and second declension _-r_ nouns, the masculine ends in _-er_. The feminine ends in _-ris_, and the neuter ends in _-re_. The genitive is the same as the nominative feminine singular.

Comparative and superlative forms of adjectives

As in English, adjectives have superlative and comparative forms. For regular first and second declension and third declension adjectives with one or two endings, the comparative is formed by adding _-ior_ for the masculine and feminine, and _-ius_ for the neuter to the stem. The genitives for both are formed by adding _-iōris_. Therefore, they are declined in the third declension, but they are not declined as _i_-stems. Superlatives are formed by adding _-issimus, -issima, -issimum_ to the stem and are thus declined like first and second declension adjectives.

Comparatives and superlatives of _-er_ adjectives

Adjectives (in the first and second as well as third declensions) that have masculine nominative singular forms ending in _-er_ are slightly different. As with normal adjectives, the comparative is formed by adding _-ior_ to the stem, but for the superlative, _-rimus_ is added to the nominative masculine singular.

+------------------------+----------+-------------+-------------+
| Adjective              | Positive | Comparative | Superlative |
+========================+==========+=============+=============+
| ('pretty, beautiful')  |          |             |             |

Comparatives and superlatives of _-lis_ adjectives

Some third declension adjectives with two endings in _-lis_ in the masculine–feminine nominative singular have irregular superlative forms. The following are the only adjectives that do.

+------------------------+----------+-------------+-------------+
| Adjective              | Positive | Comparative | Superlative |

Comparatives and superlatives of _-eus/-ius_ adjectives

First and second declension adjectives that end in _-eus_ or _-ius_ are unusual in that they do not form the comparative and superlative by taking endings at all. Instead, ('more') and ('most'), the comparative and superlative degrees of ('much, greatly'), respectively, are used.

Many adjectives in _-uus_, except those in _-quus_ or _-guus_, also follow this rule.

Irregular comparatives and superlatives

As in most languages, Latin has adjectives that have irregular comparatives and superlatives.

Declension of numerals

There are several different kinds of numeral words in Latin: the two most common are cardinal numerals and ordinal numerals. There are also several more rare numerals, e.g., distributive numerals and adverbial numerals.

Cardinal numerals

All cardinal numerals are indeclinable, except ('one'), ('two'), ('three'), plural hundreds ('two hundred'), ('three hundred') etc., and ('thousand'), which have cases and genders like adjectives. is declined like a first- and second-declension pronoun with _-īus_ in the genitive, and _-ī_ in the dative. is declined irregularly, is declined like a third-declension plural adjective, _-centī_ ('hundred') numerals decline like first- and second-declension adjectives, and is invariable in the singular and declined like a third-declension _i_-stem neuter noun in the plural:

The existence of plural endings for _ūnus_ might seem unnecessary; however, they are used with _pluralia tantum_ nouns, e. g. _ūna castra_ (one [military] camp), _ūnae scālae_ (one ladder).

The word ('both'), is declined like _duo_ except that its _o_ is long. Both declensions derive from the Indo-European dual number, otherwise defunct in Latin, rather than the plural.

The word _mīlle_ 'thousand' is a singular indeclinable adjective. However, its plural, _mīlia_, is a plural third-declension _i_-stem neuter noun. To write the phrase "four thousand horses" in Latin, the genitive is used: _quattuor mīlia equōrum_, literally, "four thousands of horses".

Adverbs and their comparatives and superlatives

Adverbs are not declined. However, adverbs must be formed if one wants to make an adjective into an adverb.

Adverbs from first- and second-declension adjectives

First and second declension adjectives' adverbs are formed by adding _-ē_ onto their stems.

+--------------------+------------------------+
| Adjective          | Adverb                 |
+====================+========================+
| ('clear, famous')  | ('clearly, famously')  |
+--------------------+------------------------+
| ('strong, robust') | ('strongly, robustly') |
+--------------------+------------------------+
| ('weak')           | ('weakly')             |
+--------------------+------------------------+
| ('complete, firm') | ('completely, firmly') |
+--------------------+------------------------+
| ('whole, fresh')   | ('wholly, freshly')    |
+--------------------+------------------------+
| ('free')           | ('freely')             |
+--------------------+------------------------+

Adverbs from third declension adjectives

Typically, third declension adjectives' adverbs are formed by adding _-iter_ to the stem. However, most third declension adjectives with one ending simply add _-er_ to the stem.

+--------------------------+------------------------------+
| Adjective                | Adverb                       |
+==========================+==============================+
| ('prudent')              | ('prudently')                |
+--------------------------+------------------------------+
| ('bold')                 | ('boldly')                   |
+--------------------------+------------------------------+
| ('courageous, spirited') | ('courageously, spiritedly') |
+--------------------------+------------------------------+
| ('wholesome')            | ('wholesomely')              |
+--------------------------+------------------------------+
|                          |                              |
+--------------------------+------------------------------+

Comparative and superlative of adverbs

Adverbs' comparative forms are identical to the nominative neuter singular of the corresponding comparative adjective. Adverbs' superlative forms are simply formed by attaching the regular ending _-ē_ to the corresponding superlative adjective. As with their corresponding adjectival forms, first and second declensions adjectives ending in _-eus_ or _-ius_ use and as opposed to distinct endings.

+------------------------+----------------+-----------------+
| Positive               | Comparative    | Superlative     |
+========================+================+=================+
| ('clearly, famously')  |                |                 |
+------------------------+----------------+-----------------+
| ('completely, firmly') |                |                 |
+------------------------+----------------+-----------------+
| ('suitably, properly') | _magis idōneē_ | _maximē idōneē_ |
+------------------------+----------------+-----------------+
| ('prudently')          |                |                 |
+------------------------+----------------+-----------------+
| ('wholesomely')        |                |                 |
+------------------------+----------------+-----------------+

Peculiarities within declension

Irregularity in number

Some nouns are only used in the singular (singulare tantum) such as:

-   materials, such as ('gold') and ('copper, bronze')
-   abstract nouns, such as ('speed') and ('knowledge'')

Some nouns are only used in the plural (plurale tantum) such as:

-   many festivals, such as ('Saturnalia')
-   ('camp') and ('arms')

-   a few geographical names are plural such as ('Thebes', both the Greek and the Egyptian cities)

Indeclinable nouns

Indeclinable nouns are nouns which only have one form in all cases (of the singular).

-   ('fate, divine law')

-   ('likeness')

-   ('morning')

-   ('sin, abomination')

-   , ('nothing, none')

-   ('sex')

Heterogeneous nouns

Heterogeneous nouns are nouns which vary in respect to gender.

-   A few nouns in the second declension occur in both the neuter and masculine. However, their meanings remain the same.
-   Some nouns are one gender in the singular, but become another gender in the plural. They may also change in meaning.

Order of the cases

In modern textbooks of Latin, there is no single international standard for the sequence of cases.

–()–––––()

This order reflects the syncretic trends of different cases to share similar endings. Usually the vocative and locative cases are omitted because they appear in the paradigm of only a few word classes and are dealt with separately. This makes the paradigm appear normally in the format ––––, which is also roughly the order of how frequently the cases appear in Latin text, meaning that the cases are introduced in teaching in this order. This paradigm has been the usual order in the United Kingdom and many Commonwealth countries since the publication of Benjamin Hall Kennedy's _Latin Primer_ (1866). It is the only method nowadays used in Hungary and Finland. It is also usual in France, Belgium, Spain, and Portugal.

––––()––()

This alternative sequence arose from Byzantine grammarians who were originally writing about Greek. It is standard in the United States, although modern texts increasingly move the vocative at the end to minimize disruption to the declensions in which it is identical to the nominative; some introductory texts such as _Wheelock's Latin_ almost entirely ignore the vocative and locative except for a few brief notes, giving the format –––––(). This paradigm is also used in Poland, as it closely corresponds to the conventional case order in the Polish language, except for the latter's use of an instrumental case instead of an ablative. The same sequence is predominant in the Netherlands, although the modern Dutch language has largely lost its case system; instead, the rationale is that this general order is convenient for the consistent teaching of three different commonly studied declensional languages: Latin, Ancient Greek, and modern German. The order ––––()– is also used in Germany itself to echo the conventional order of German cases (–––), and also in Lithuania because the conventional order of Lithuanian noun cases is the same. The locative is dealt with separately as it is seldom used in Latin and might be considered to be on the verge of extinction in Classical Latin.

The order ––––– is the standard order used in Greece (both for the teaching of Ancient and Modern Greek as well as Latin) and Italy (with the vocative case before the ablative). Here again, the locative is dealt with separately.

Others

Brazilian grammarian Napoleão Mendes used the unusual sequence –––––. The Latinum podcast uses –––––, as this facilitates memorisation. Latinum deals with the locative separately.
