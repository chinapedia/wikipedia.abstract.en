_ROLLING STONE_ is an American monthly magazine that focuses on popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco, California in 1967 by Jann Wenner, who is still the magazine's publisher, and music critic Ralph J. Gleason, which became famous for its coverage of rock music, and for political reporting by authors such as Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine broadened and shifted its focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. [1] In recent years, it has resumed its traditional mix of content.

Rolling Stone Press is the magazine's associated book publishing imprint. Straight Arrow Press was the magazine's associated book publishing imprint, Straight Arrow Publishing Co., Inc. was the publishing company that published _Rolling Stone_.[2][3]


History

Founding and early history

_Rolling Stone_ magazine was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by Jann Wenner and Ralph Gleason.[4] To get it off the ground, Wenner borrowed $7,500 from his own family and from the parents of his soon-to-be wife, Jane Schindelheim.[5] The first issue carried a cover date of November 9, 1967,[6] and was in newspaper format with a lead article on the Monterey Pop Festival.[7] The cover price was 25¢ (equivalent to $ in 2016).

In the first issue,[8] Wenner explained that the title of the magazine referred to the 1950 blues song "Rollin' Stone", recorded by Muddy Waters, and Bob Dylan's hit single "Like a Rolling Stone":

Some authors have attributed the name solely to Dylan's hit single: "At [Ralph] Gleason's suggestion, Wenner named his magazine after a Bob Dylan song."[9] _Rolling Stone_ initially identified with and reported the hippie counterculture of the era. However, it distanced itself from the underground newspapers of the time, such as _Berkeley Barb_, embracing more traditional journalistic standards and avoiding the radical politics of the underground press. In the very first edition, Wenner wrote that _Rolling Stone_ "is not just about the music, but about the things and attitudes that music embraces".

In the 1970s, _Rolling Stone_ began to make a mark with its political coverage, with the likes of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson writing for the magazine's political section. Thompson first published his most famous work _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_ within the pages of _Rolling Stone_, where he remained a contributing editor until his death in 2005.[10] In the 1970s, the magazine also helped launch the careers of many prominent authors, including Cameron Crowe, Lester Bangs, Joe Klein, Joe Eszterhas, Ben Fong-Torres, Patti Smith and P. J. O'Rourke. It was at this point that the magazine ran some of its most famous stories, including that of the Patty Hearst abduction odyssey. One interviewer, speaking for a large number of his peers, said that he bought his first copy of the magazine upon initial arrival on his college campus, describing it as a "rite of passage".[11]

In 1977, the magazine moved its headquarters from San Francisco to New York City. Editor Jann Wenner said San Francisco had become "a cultural backwater".[12]

During the 1980s, the magazine began to shift towards being a general "entertainment" magazine. Music was still a dominant topic, but there was increasing coverage of celebrities in television, films and the pop culture of the day. The magazine also initiated its annual "Hot Issue" during this time.

_Rolling Stone_ was initially known for its musical coverage and for Thompson's political reporting. In the 1990s, the magazine changed its format to appeal to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors and popular music. This led to criticism that the magazine was emphasizing style over substance.[13] In recent years, the magazine has resumed its traditional mix of content, including in-depth political stories. It has also expanded content to include coverage of financial and banking issues. As a result, the magazine has seen its circulation increase and its reporters invited as experts to network television programs of note.[14]

The printed format has gone through several changes. The first publications, in 1967–72, were in folded tabloid newspaper format, with no staples, black ink text, and a single color highlight that changed each edition. From 1973 onwards, editions were produced on a four-color press with a different newsprint paper size. In 1979, the bar code appeared. In 1980, it became a gloss-paper, large format (10"×12") magazine. As of edition of October 30, 2008, _Rolling Stone_ has had a smaller, standard-format magazine size.[15]

2000s

After years of declining readership, the magazine experienced a major resurgence of interest and relevance with the work of two young journalists in the late 2000s, Michael Hastings and Matt Taibbi.

In 2005, Dana Leslie Fields, former publisher of _Rolling Stone_, who had worked at the magazine for 17 years, was an inaugural inductee into the Magazine Hall of Fame.[16]

In 2009, Taibbi unleashed an acclaimed series of scathing reports on the financial meltdown of the time. He famously described Goldman Sachs as "a great vampire squid".

2010s

Bigger headlines came at the end of June 2010. _Rolling Stone_ caused a controversy in the White House by publishing in the July issue an article by journalist Michael Hastings entitled, "The Runaway General",[17] quoting criticism by General Stanley A. McChrystal, commander of the International Security Assistance Force and U.S. Forces-Afghanistan commander, about Vice President Joe Biden and other Administration members of the White House. McChrystal resigned from his position shortly after his statements went public.[18][19][20][21]

In 2010, Taibbi documented illegal and fraudulent actions by banks in the foreclosure courts, after traveling to Jacksonville, Florida and sitting in on hearings in the courtroom. His article, _Invasion of the Home Snatchers_ also documented attempts by the judge to intimidate a homeowner fighting foreclosure and the attorney Taibbi accompanied into the court.[22][23]

In January 2012, the magazine ran exclusive excerpts from Hastings' book just prior to publication.[24] The book, _The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America's War in Afghanistan_, provided a much more expansive look at McChrystal and the culture of senior American military and how they become embroiled in such wars. The book reached Amazon's bestseller list in the first 48 hours of release, and it received generally favorable reviews. Salon's Glenn Greenwald described it as "superb," "brave" and "eye-opening".[25]

In 2012, Taibbi, through his coverage of the Libor scandal,[26] emerged as an expert on that topic, which led to media appearances outside _Rolling Stone_.[27][28]

On November 9, 2012, the magazine published its first Spanish-language section on Latino music and culture, in the issue dated November 22.[29][30]

In September 2016, Advertising Age reported that Wenner is in the process of selling a 49% stake of the magazine to a company from Singapore called BandLab. The new investor will have no direct involvement in the editorial content of the magazine.[31]

In September 2017, Wenner Media announced that the remaining 51% of Rolling Stone magazine is up for sale.[32] In December 2017, Penske Media acquired the remaining stake from Wenner Media.[33] On January 31, 2019, Penske acquired BandLab's 49% stake in _Rolling Stone_, gaining full ownership of the magazine.[34]


Website

_Rolling Stone_{{'}}s website features selected current articles, reviews, blogs, MP3s. The website also has other features, such as searchable and free encyclopedic articles about artists, with images and sometimes sound clips of their work. The articles and reviews are sometimes in a revised form of the published versions. The website also carries political and cultural articles and entries selected from the magazine's archives.

The site at one time had an extensive message-board forum. By the late 1990s, this had developed into a thriving community, with a large number of regular members and contributors worldwide. However, the site was also plagued with numerous Internet trolls and malicious code-hackers, who vandalized the forum substantially.[35] The magazine abruptly deleted the forum in May 2004, then began a new, much more limited message board community on their site in late 2005, only to remove it again in 2006. In March 2008, the website started a new message board section once again, then deleted it in April 2010.

_Rolling Stone_ devotes one of its table of contents pages to promoting material currently appearing on its website, listing detailed links to the items. The magazine also has a page at MySpace, Facebook and Twitter.

On April 19, 2010, the website was updated drastically and now features the complete archives of _Rolling Stone_.[36] The archive was first launched under a for-pay model, but has since transitioned to a free-with-print-subscription model.[37] In the spring of 2012, _Rolling Stone_ launched a federated search feature which searches both the website and the archive.[38]

The website has become an interactive source of biographical information on music artists in addition to historical rankings from the magazine. Users can cross-reference lists and they are also provided with historical insights. For example, one group that is listed on both Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time is Toots and the Maytals, with biographical details from Rolling Stone that explain how Toots and the Maytals are responsible for coining the term "reggae" in their song "Do the Reggay".[39][40] For biographical information on all artists, the website contains a directory listed alphabetically.[41]

_Glixel_

In May 2016, Wenner Media announced plans to create a separate online publication dedicated to the coverage of video games and their culture. Gus Wenner, Jann Wenner's son, stated that "gaming is today what rock 'n' roll was when _Rolling Stone_ was founded". _Glixel_ was originally hosted on _Rolling Stone_{{'}}s website and transitioned to its own domain by October 2016. Stories from _Glixel_ are included on the _Rolling Stone_ website, while writers for _Rolling Stone_ were also able to contribute to _Glixel_. The site was headed by John Davison, and its offices were located in San Francisco.[42][43] _Rolling Stone_ closed down the offices in June 2017 and fired the entire staff, citing the difficulties of working with the remote site from their main New York office. Brian Crecente, founder of Kotaku and co-founder of bigger Polygon, was hired as editorial director and runs the site from the main New York office.[44] Following the sale of _Rolling Stone_{{'}}s assets to Penske Media Corporation, the _Glixel_ content was merged into the routine publishing of _Variety_, with Crecente still as editorial director.[45]


Editorial stance

The _Rolling Stone_ endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[46]


Restaurant

In December 2009, the _Los Angeles Times_ reported that the owners of _Rolling Stone_ magazine planned to open a _Rolling Stone_ restaurant in the Hollywood & Highland Center in Hollywood in the spring of 2010.[47] The expectation was that the restaurant could become the first of a national chain if it was successful.[48] As of November 2010, the "soft opening" of the restaurant was planned for December 2010.[49] In 2011, the restaurant was open for lunch and dinner as well as a full night club downstairs on the weekends.[50] The restaurant closed in February 2013.[51]


Criticism

One major criticism of _Rolling Stone_ involves its generational bias toward the 1960s and 1970s. One critic referred to the _Rolling Stone_ list of the "500 Greatest Songs" as an example of "unrepentant rockist fogeyism".[52] In further response to this issue, rock critic Jim DeRogatis, a former _Rolling Stone_ editor, published a thorough critique of the magazine's lists in a book called _Kill Your Idols: A New Generation of Rock Writers Reconsiders the Classics_, which featured differing opinions from many younger critics.[53]

_Rolling Stone_ magazine has been criticized for reconsidering many classic albums that it had previously dismissed, and for frequent use of the 3.5-star rating. For example, Led Zeppelin was largely written off by _Rolling Stone_ magazine critics during the band's most active years in the 1970s, but by 2006, a cover story on the band honored them as "the Heaviest Band of All Time".[54] A critic for _Slate_ magazine described a conference at which 1984's _The Rolling Stone Record Guide_ was scrutinized. As he described it, "The guide virtually ignored hip-hop and ruthlessly panned heavy metal, the two genres that within a few years would dominate the pop charts. In an auditorium packed with music journalists, you could detect more than a few anxious titters: How many of us will want our record reviews read back to us 20 years hence?"[55]

The hiring of former _FHM_ editor Ed Needham further enraged critics who alleged that _Rolling Stone_ had lost its credibility.[56]

The 2003 _Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Guitarists of all Time_ article, which named only two female musicians, resulted in _Venus Zine_ answering with their own list, entitled "The Greatest Female Guitarists of All Time".[57]

Conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg stated that _Rolling Stone_ had "essentially become the house organ of the Democratic National Committee".[58] _Rolling Stone_ editor Jann Wenner has made all of his political donations to Democrats.[59]

_Rolling Stone_{{'}}s film critic, Peter Travers, has been criticized for his high number of repetitively used blurbs.[60][61]

Tsarnaev cover

The August 2013 _Rolling Stone_ cover, featuring then-accused (later convicted) Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, drew widespread criticism that the magazine was "glamorizing terrorism" and that the cover was a "slap in the face to the great city of Boston".[62] The online edition of the article was accompanied by a short editorial stating that the story "falls within the traditions of journalism and _Rolling Stone_'s long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day".[63] The controversial cover photograph that was used by _Rolling Stone_ had previously featured on the front page of _The New York Times_ on May 5, 2013.[64]

In response to the outcry, New England-based CVS Pharmacy and Tedeschi Food Shops banned their stores from carrying the issue.[65] Also refusing to sell the issue were Walgreens;[66] Rite-Aid and Kmart;[67] Roche Bros. and Stop & Shop;[68] H-E-B and Walmart;[69] 7-Eleven;[70] Hy-Vee, Rutter's Farm, and United Supermarkets;[71] Cumberland Farms and Market Basket;[72] and Shaw's.[73] Boston mayor Thomas Menino sent a letter to _Rolling Stone_ publisher Jann Wenner, calling the cover "ill-conceived, at best ... [it] reaffirms a message that destruction gains fame for killers and their 'causes'." Menino also wrote, "To respond to you in anger is to feed into your obvious market strategy", and that Wenner could have written about the survivors or the people who came to help after the bombings instead. In conclusion he wrote, "The survivors of the Boston Marathon deserve _Rolling Stone_ cover stories, though I no longer feel that ''Rolling Stone ''deserves them."[74]

UVA false rape story

In the November 19, 2014 issue, the story "A Rape on Campus" was run about an alleged gang rape on the campus of the University of Virginia.[75] Separate inquiries by Phi Kappa Psi, the fraternity accused by _Rolling Stone_ of facilitating the alleged rape, and _The Washington Post_ revealed major errors, omissions and discrepancies in the story.[76][77] Reporter Sabrina Erdely's story was subject to intense media criticism.[78][79] _The Washington Post_ and _Boston Herald_ issued calls for magazine staff involved in the report to be fired.[80] _Rolling Stone_ subsequently issued three apologies for the story. Some suggested that legal action against the magazine by persons accused of the rape might result.[81]

On December 5, 2014, _Rolling Stone_{{'}}s managing editor, Will Dana, apologized for not fact-checking the story.[82] _Rolling Stone_ commissioned an outside investigation of the story and its problems by the dean of the Columbia School of Journalism. The report uncovered journalistic failure in the UVA story and institutional problems with reporting at _Rolling Stone_.[83] _Rolling Stone_ retracted the story on April 5, 2015.[84] On April 6, 2015, following the investigation and retraction of the story, Phi Kappa Psi announced plans to pursue all available legal action against _Rolling Stone_, including claims of defamation.[85]

On May 12, 2015, UVA associate dean Nicole Eramo, chief administrator for handling sexual assault issues at the school, filed a $7.5 million defamation lawsuit in Charlottesville Circuit Court against _Rolling Stone_ and Erdely, claiming damage to her reputation and emotional distress. Said the filing, "_Rolling Stone_ and Erdely's highly defamatory and false statements about Dean Eramo were not the result of an innocent mistake. They were the result of a wanton journalist who was more concerned with writing an article that fulfilled her preconceived narrative about the victimization of women on American college campuses, and a malicious publisher who was more concerned about selling magazines to boost the economic bottom line for its faltering magazine, than they were about discovering the truth or actual facts."[86] On November 4, 2016, after 20 hours of deliberation,[87] a jury consisting of eight women and two men found _Rolling Stone_, the magazine's publisher and Erdely liable for defaming Eramo.[88]

On July 29, 2015, three graduates of the fraternity Phi Kappa Psi filed a lawsuit against _Rolling Stone_, its publisher Wenner Media, and a journalist for defamation and infliction of emotional distress.[89] The same day, and just months after the controversy began, _The New York Times_ reported that managing editor Will Dana was departing the magazine with his last date recorded as August 7, 2015.[90] On November 9, 2015, the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity filed suit for $25 million for damages to its reputation caused by the magazine's publication of this story, "with reckless disregard for the truth".[91][92]


In popular culture

George Harrison's song "This Guitar" (1975), a lyrical sequel to his Beatles track "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" (1968), references the magazine in its second verse: "Learned to get up when I fall / Can even climb'' Rolling Stone ''walls". The song was written in response to some highly unfavorable reviews from _Rolling Stone_ and other publications for Harrison's 1974 North American tour and the _Dark Horse_ album.[93][94]

The 2000 film _Almost Famous_ centers on a teenage journalist writing for the magazine in the early 1970s while covering the fictional band Stillwater. The film was directed by Cameron Crowe and based on his own experiences as a young journalist for the magazine in the same time period.[95]

"The Cover of Rolling Stone" is a song written by Shel Silverstein and first recorded by American rock group Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show. The song satirizes success in the music business; the song's narrator laments that his band, despite having the superficial attributes of a successful rock star (including drug usage, "teenage groupies, who'll do anything we say" and a frenetic guitar solo) has been unable to "get their pictures/on the cover of the _Rolling Stone_".


Covers

Some artists have been featured on the cover many times, and some of these pictures went on to become iconic. The Beatles, for example, have appeared on the cover more than 30 times, either individually or as a band.[96] The first 10 issues featured, in order of appearance, the following:

-   John Lennon
-   Tina Turner
-   The Beatles
-   Jimi Hendrix, Donovan & Otis Redding
-   Jim Morrison
-   Janis Joplin
