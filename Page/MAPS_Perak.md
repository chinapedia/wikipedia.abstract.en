Attendance and operations

MAPS Perak management claims that the monthly visitors number up to 50,000 visitors[11] however this was only noted in its first month of operations in 2017. State assemblyman for the Canning Wong Kah Koh was reported to have said daily attendance to MAPS only numbered up to 200 people.[12]The operations of the park is further hampered with the delays of Dreamzone, which eventually resulted in the termination of licensing agreement with Dreamworks[13] However, its shareholders are playing a positive note in hoping to turn the numbers around.
