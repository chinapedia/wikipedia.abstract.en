The VICTORIA HOTEL is a major hotel in Amsterdam, Netherlands. It is on the corner of the Damrak and Prins Hendrikkade, close to Amsterdam Centraal station. The Victoria Hotel is one of the oldest and most iconic hotels in The Netherlands. [1]

The hotel opened on 19 August 1890 and was designed by J.F. Henkenhaf. It was the first hotel in the country to have electric lighting. During the years it has attracted well-known clientele, including Billy Graham, Louis Armstrong, Zarah Leander, Fats Domino, Glenda Jackson and more recently Katy Perry, Anastacia, Marilyn Manson and Iron Maiden.[2]

The building is designed around two older properties, Nos.Â 45 - 47 Prins Hendrikkade, that the hotel was unable to purchase owing to high prices.[3] This idiosyncrasy was explored in the book and subsequent film _Publieke werken_ (_Public Works_)[4][5]. The film is also known as _A Noble Intention_ (2015).

On July 13 2001, the Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed selected the Victoria hotel as a National heritage site.
