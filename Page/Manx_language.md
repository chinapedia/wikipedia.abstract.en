MANX (native name or , pronounced or or ),[1] also known as MANX GAELIC, and also historically spelled MANKS,[2] is a member of the Goidelic (Gaelic) language branch of the Celtic languages of the Indo-European language family, that was spoken as a first language by the Manx people on the Isle of Man until the death of the last native speaker, Ned Maddrell, in 1974. Despite this, the language has never fallen completely out of use, with a minority having some knowledge of it; in addition, Manx still has a role as an important part of the island's culture and heritage. Manx has been the subject of language revival efforts with estimates, in 2015, of around 1,800 people with varying levels of second language conversational ability. Since the late 20th century, Manx has become more visible on the island, with increased signage, radio broadcasts and a bilingual primary school. The revival of Manx has been made easier because the language was well-recorded; for example, the Bible had been translated into Manx, and audio recordings had been made of native speakers.


Names of the language

In Manx

In Manx, the language is called _Gaelg_ or _Gailck_ (pronounced "gilk" or "gilg" or "gelg" with hard Gs), a word which shares the same etymology as the word "Gaelic", borrowed from Northern Irish. The sister languages of Irish and Scottish Gaelic use _Gaeilge_ (dialect variants Gaoluinn, Gaedhlag, Gaelge and Gaelic) and _Gàidhlig_, respectively, for their languages. As with Irish and Scottish, the form with the definite article is frequently used in Manx, e.g. _y Ghaelg_ or _y Ghailck_ (Irish _an Ghaeilge_, Scottish _a' Ghàidhlig_).

To distinguish it from the two other forms of Gaelic, the phrases _Gaelg_/_Gailck Vannin_ (Gaelic of Mann) and _Gaelg_/_Gailck Vanninnagh_ (Manx Gaelic) also are used. In addition, the nickname "Çhengey ny Mayrey" (the mother tongue/tongue of the mother, lit. the mother's tongue) is occasionally used.

In English

The language is usually referred to in English as "Manx". The term "Manx Gaelic" is often used, for example when discussing the relationship between the three Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx) or to avoid confusion with Anglo-Manx, the form of English spoken on the island. Scottish Gaelic is often referred to in English as simply "Gaelic", but this is less common with Manx and Irish.

A feature of Anglo-Manx deriving from Gaelic is the use of the definite article, e.g. "the Manx", "the Gaelic", in ways not generally seen in standard English.

The word "Manx" is frequently spelled "Manks" in historical sources, particularly those written by natives of the island; the word means "Mannish", and originates from the Old Norse _Mannisk_. The name of the island, Man, is frequently spelled "Mann". It is sometimes accompanied by a footnote explaining that it is a two-syllable word, with the stress on the first syllable, "MAN-en". The island is named after the Irish god Manannán mac Lir, thus _Ellan Vannin_ (Irish _Oileán Mhannanáin_) 'Mannanán's Island'.


History

on a stone in the Manx Museum written in Primitive Irish and which reads DOVAIDONA MAQI DROATA, "Of Dovaido, son of Droata"[3]]] (Brown-haired William)]] (Hill of the Day Watch). The Manx language has had a substantial influence on the island's toponymy and nomenclature.]]

Manx is a Goidelic language, closely related to Irish and Scottish Gaelic. On the whole it is partially mutually intelligible with these, and native speakers of one find it easy to gain passive, and even spoken, competency in the other two.

The earliest known language of the Isle of Man was a form of Brythonic (like modern Welsh, Cornish and Breton). However, the basis of the modern Manx language is Primitive Irish (like modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic). The island lends its name to _Manannán_, the Brythonic and Gaelic sea god who is said in myth to have once ruled the island. Primitive Irish is first attested in Ogham inscriptions from the 4th century AD. These writings have been found throughout Ireland and the west coast of Great Britain. Primitive Irish transitioned into Old Irish through the 5th century. Old Irish, dating from the 6th century, used the Latin script and is attested primarily in marginalia to Latin manuscripts, but there are no extant examples from the Isle of Man.

On the Isle of Man, the transition from Manx Brythonic to Old Irish (or Manx Gaelic) may have been gradual and appears to have occured after speakers of Primitive Irish settled on the Isle of Man, in large numbers, from about the 5th century AD. Their influence is evident in a change of language in Ogham inscriptions on Man.

It is possible that Old Irish did not survive the conquest and domination of the island by Norse-speaking Vikings, so that modern Manx language may represent a later, revived form (derived from Middle Irish). During the 8th century AD, the Isle of Man, like the people in coastal areas of Scotland and Ireland, was significantly influenced by Norse speakers. While Norse had very little impact on the Manx language overall,[4][5] its legacy in Manx includes loanwords, personal names, and place names such as Laxey (Laksaa) and Ramsey (Rhumsaa).

By the 10th century, Middle Irish had emerged and was spoken throughout Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man.

During the later Middle Ages, the Isle of Man fell increasingly under the influence of England, and from then on the English language has been the chief external factor in the development of Manx. Beginning in 1405, Manx experienced even more English influence under the rule of Sir John Stanley. As contact between Manx speakers and Gaelic speakers from Scotland and Ireland declined, the language diverged further from its related neighbours.[6][7]

In the 17th century, some university students left the Isle of Man to attend school in England. At the same time, teaching in English was required in schools founded by governor Isaac Barrow. Barrow also promoted the use of English in churches; he considered that it was a superior language for reading the Bible; however, because the majority of ministers were monolingual Manx speakers, his views had little practical impact.[8][9]

Thomas Wilson began his tenure as Bishop of Mann in 1698 and was succeeded by Mark Hildesley. Both men held positive views of Manx; Wilson was the first person to publish a book in Manx, a translation of _The Principles and Duties of Christianity_ (_Coyrie Sodjey_), and Hildesley successfully promoted the use of Manx as the language of instruction in schools. The New Testament was first published in Manx in 1767. In the late 18th century, nearly every school was teaching in English. This decline continued into the 19th century, as English gradually became the primary language spoken on the Isle of Man.[10][11]

In 1848, J. G. Cumming wrote, "there are ... few persons (perhaps none of the young) who speak no English." Henry Jenner estimated in 1874 that about 30% of the population habitually spoke Manx (12,340 out of a population of 41,084). According to official census figures, 9.1% of the population claimed to speak Manx in 1901; in 1921 the percentage was only 1.1%.[12] Since the language was used by so few people, it had low linguistic "prestige", and parents tended to not teach Manx to their children, thinking it would be useless to them compared with English.[13]


Revival

Following the decline in the use of Manx during the nineteenth century, (The Manx Language Society) was founded in 1899. By the middle of the twentieth century, only a few elderly native speakers remained (the last of them, Ned Maddrell, died on December 27, 1974), but by then a scholarly revival had begun and a few people had started teaching it in schools. The Manx Language Unit was formed in 1992, consisting of three members and headed by Manx Language Officer Brian Stowell, a language enthusiast and fluent speaker, "which was put in charge of all aspects of Manx language teaching and accreditation in schools."[14] This led to an increased interest in studying the Manx language and encouraged a renewed sense of ethnic identity. The revival of Manx has been aided by the recording work done in the twentieth century by researchers. Most notably, the Irish Folklore Commission was sent in with recording equipment in 1948 by Éamon de Valera. Also important in preserving the Manx language was work conducted by the late Brian Stowell, who is considered personally responsible for the current revival of the Manx language.[15] The Manx Language Strategy was released in 2017, outlining a five-year plan for the language's continued revitalisation.[16][17] Culture Vannin employs a Manx Language Development Officer (Manx: _Yn Greinneyder_) to encourage and facilitate the use of the language.

In 2009, UNESCO's Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger declared Manx an extinct language, despite the presence of hundreds of speakers on the Isle of Man.[18] Since then, UNESCO's classification of the language has changed to "critically endangered".[19]

In the 2011 census, 1,823 out of 80,398 Isle of Man residents, or 2.27% of the population, claimed to have knowledge of Manx,[20] an increase of 134 people from the 2001 census.[21] These were spread roughly uniformly over the island: in Douglas 566 people professed an ability to speak, read or write Manx; 179 in Peel, 146 in Onchan, and 149 in Ramsey.

Traditional Manx given names are once again becoming common on the island, especially _Moirrey_ and _Voirrey_ (Mary, properly pronounced similarly to the Scottish _Moira_, but often mispronounced as _Moiree/Voiree_ when used as a given name by non-Manx speakers), _Illiam_ (William), _Orry_ (from the Manx king Godred Crovan of Norse origin), _Breeshey_ (also _Breesha_) (Bridget), _Aalish_ (also _Ealish_) (Alice), _Juan_ (Jack), _Ean_ (Ian), _Joney_ (John), _Fenella_ (Fionnuala), _Pherick_ (Patrick) and _Freya_ (from the Norse goddess) remain popular.

Literature

Because Manx has never had a large number of speakers, it has never been practical to produce large amounts of written literature. However, a body of oral literature did exist. The "Fianna" tales and others like them are known, including the Manx ballad _Fin as Oshin_, commemorating Finn MacCool and Ossian.[31] With the coming of Protestantism, Manx spoken tales slowly disappeared, while a tradition of _carvals_ - religious songs or carols - developed with religious sanction.

As far as is known, there was no distinctively Manx written literature before the Reformation. By that time, any presumed literary link with Ireland and Scotland, such as through Irish-trained priests, had been lost. The first published literature in Manx was _The Principles and Duties of Christianity (Coyrie Sodjey)_, translated by Bishop of Man Thomas Wilson.[32]

The Book of Common Prayer was translated by John Phillips, the Welsh-born Bishop of Sodor and Man (1605–33). The early Manx script has some similarities with orthographical systems found occasionally in Scotland and in Ireland for the transliteration of Gaelic, such as the Book of the Dean of Lismore, as well as some extensive texts based on English and Scottish English orthographical practices of the time. Little secular Manx literature has been preserved.

The New Testament was first published in 1767. When the Anglican church authorities started to produce written literature in the Manx language in the 18th century, the system developed by John Philips was further "anglicised"; the one feature retained from Welsh orthography was the use of to represent schwa (e.g. "horse" and "help" as well as (e.g. "knowledge"), though it is also used to represent , as in English (e.g. "John" (vocative), "fish").

Other works produced in the 18th and 19th century include catechisms, hymn books and religious tracts. A translation of _Paradise Lost_ was made in 1796.

A considerable amount of secular literature has been produced in the 20th and 21st centuries as part of the language revival. In 2006, the first full-length novel in Manx, _Dunveryssyn yn Tooder-Folley_ (_The Vampire Murders_) was published by Brian Stowell, after being serialised in the press. There is an increasing amount of literature available in the language, and recent publications include Manx versions of the _Gruffalo_ and _Gruffalo's Child_.[33]


Official recognition

Manx is not officially recognised by any national or regional government, although its contribution to Manx culture and tradition is acknowledged by some governmental and non-governmental bodies. For example:

The Standing Orders of the House of Keys provide that: "The proceedings of the House shall be in English; but if a Member at any point pronounces a customary term or sentence in Manx Gaelic or any other language, the Speaker may call upon the Member for a translation."[34] An example was at the sitting on 12 February 2019, when an MHK used the expression _boghtnid_,[35] stated to mean "nonsense".[36][37]

Manx is used in the annual Tynwald ceremony and Manx words are used in official Tynwald publications.[38]

For the purpose of strengthening its contribution to local culture and community, Manx is recognised under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and in the framework of the British-Irish Council.

Manx is taught as a second language at all of the island's primary and secondary schools. The lessons are optional and instruction is provided by the Department of Education's Manx Language Team which teach up to A Level standard.[39]

The Bunscoill Ghaelgagh, a primary school at St John's, has 67 children, as of September 2016, who receive nearly all of their education through the medium of the language. Children who have attended the school have the opportunity to receive some of their secondary education through the language at Queen Elizabeth II High School in Peel.

The playgroup organisation Mooinjer Veggey, which operates the , runs a series of preschool groups that introduce the language.


Learning the language

There are an increasing number of resources available for those wanting to learn the language. The Manx Language Development Officer for Culture Vannin manages the Learnmanx.com website which has a wide variety of resources. These include mobile apps a new podcast in Manx, the 1000 words-in-Manx challenge and the Video-a-day in Manx series. The most recent development on the adult language front is the creation of a new on-line course, Say Something in Manx 4 which has been created in conjunction with the Say Something in Welsh 5 It is hoped that this will be the main way on-line learners will access the language from now on. 2016 also saw the launch of a new dictionary for learners published by Culture Vannin [40]

Media

Two weekly programmes in Manx are available on medium wave on Manx Radio: _Traa dy liooar_ on Monday and _Jamys Jeheiney_ on Friday. The news in Manx is available on-line from Manx Radio, who have three other weekly programmes that use the language: _Clare ny Gael_; _Shiaght Laa_ and _Moghrey Jedoonee_.

The _Isle of Man Examiner_ has a monthly bilingual column in Manx.

The first film to be made in Manx – the 22-minute-long _Ny Kirree fo Niaghtey_ (The Sheep [plural] Under the Snow) – premiered in 1983 and was entered for the 5th Celtic Film and Television Festival in Cardiff in 1984. It was directed by Shorys Y Creayrie (George Broderick) for Foillan Films of Laxey, and is about the background to an early 18th-century folk song. In 2013, a short film, Solace in Wicca, was produced with financial assistance from Culture Vannin, CinemaNX and Isle of Man Film.[41] A series of short cartoons about the life of Cuchulain which were produced by BBC Northern Ireland are available[42] as are a series of cartoons on Manx mythology.[43] Most significant is a 13-part DVD series Manx translation of the award-winning series _Friends and Heroes_.[44]

Signage

, underneath the English]] Bilingual road, street, village and town boundary signs are common throughout the Isle of Man. All other road signs are in English only.

Business signage in Manx is gradually being introduced but is not mandated by law.

The Manx Bible

    _In the time of Bishop Wilson it had been a constant source of complaint among the Manx clergy that they were the only church in Christendom that had no version of the Bible in the vulgar tongue. Wilson set to work to remedy the defect, and, with the assistance of some of his clergy, managed to get some of the Bible translated, and the Gospel of St. Matthew printed. Bishop Hildesley, his successor, with the help of the whole body of Manx clergy, completed the work, and in 1775 the whole Bible was printed._[45]

The Bible was first produced in Manx by a group of Anglican clergymen on the island. The Gospel of Matthew was printed in 1748. The four Gospels were produced in 1763 and Conaant Noa nyn Jiarn as Saualtagh Yeesey Creest (the New Testament of our Lord & Saviour Jesus Christ) in 1767 by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SPCK). In 1772 the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew and printed, together with the Books of Wisdom of Solomon and Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) from the Apocrypha. Yn Vible Casherick (The Holy Bible) of the Old and New Testaments was published as one book by the SPCK in 1775. The bicentenary was celebrated on the Isle of Man in 1975 and included a set of stamps from the Isle of Man Post Office.

This 1775 edition effectively fixed the modern orthography of Manx Gaelic, which has changed little since. Jenner claims that some bowdlerisation had occurred in the translation, e.g. the occupation of Rahab the prostitute is rendered as _ben-oast_, a hostess or female inn-keeper.[46]

There was a translation of the Psalmyn Ghavid (Psalms of David) in metre in Manx by the Rev John Clague, vicar of Rushen, which was printed with the Book of Common Prayer of 1768. Bishop Hildesley required that these Metrical Psalms were to be sung in churches. These were reprinted by the Manx Language Society in 1905.

The British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) published the Conaant Noa (New Testament) in 1810 and reprinted it in 1824. Yn Vible Casherick (the Holy Bible) of the Old Testament and New Testament (without the two books of the Apocrypha) was first printed as a whole in 1819. BFBS last printed anything on paper in Manx in 1936 when it reprinted Noo Ean (the Gospel of St John); this was reprinted by Yn Çheshaght Ghailckagh (The Manx Gaelic Society) in 1968. The Manx Bible was republished by Shearwater Press in July 1979 as Bible Chasherick yn Lught Thie (Manx Family Bible), which was a reproduction of the BFBS 1819 Bible.

Since 2014 the BFBS 1936 Manx Gospel of John has been available online on YouVersion and Bibles.org.

Church

Manx was used in some churches into the late 19th century.[47] Although church services in Manx were once fairly common, they occur infrequently now. Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh, the Manx Language Society, hold an annual Christmas Service at locations around the island.


Classification and dialects

Manx is one of the three descendants of Old Irish (via Middle Irish and early Modern Gaelic), and is closely related to Irish and Scottish Gaelic. It shares a number of developments in phonology, vocabulary and grammar with Irish and Scottish Gaelic (in some cases only with dialects of these) and shows a number of unique changes. There are two attested dialects of Manx, Northern Manx and Southern Manx.[48] A third dialect may have existed in-between, around Douglas.

Manx shares with Scottish Gaelic the partial loss of contrastive palatalisation of labial consonants; thus while in Irish the velarised consonants contrast phonemically with palatalised , in Scottish Gaelic and Manx, the phonemic contrast has been lost to some extent.[49] A consequence of this phonemic merger is that Middle Irish unstressed word-final (spelled _-(a)ibh_, _-(a)imh_ in Irish and Gaelic) has merged with (_-(e)abh_, _-(e)amh_) in Manx; both have become , spelled _-oo_ or _-u(e)_. Examples include ("to stand"; Irish ), ("religion"; Irish ), ("fainting"; Early Modern Irish , lit. _in clouds_), and ("on you (plural)"; Irish ).[50]

Medial and final *bh and *mh have become and in general in Manx, thus _shiu_ 'you PL', Scottish and Irish Gaelic _sibh_ (_siph_ in Northern Irish, _sib_ in South Connacht Irish; Lewis Gàidhlig has the variant _siù_, besides the more general _sibh_), -bh in final consonant clusters, e.g. Manx _sharroo_ 'bitter', Scottish _searbh_ , Northern and Western Irish _searbh_ , Southern Irish _searbh_ , between vowels, e.g. Manx _awin_ 'river' , Scottish _abhainn_ , Irish _abhainn_ , word-finally in monosyllables, e.g. Manx _laaue_ 'hand', Scottish _làmh_ , Northern Irish , Western Irish _lámh_ , Southern Irish , at the end of stressed syllables (see further below), as in _sourey_ 'summer', Scotland and Ireland _samhradh_, Scottish , Northern Irish , Western and Southern Irish . In all this Manx is most like Northern Irish. Rare retentions of the older pronunciation of "bh" include _Divlyn_, _Divlin_ 'Dublin', Middle Irish _Duibhlinn_ , also written _Duibhlinn_ in Modern Irish and Scots Gaelic.

Moreover, similarly to Munster Irish, historical _bh_ and _mh_ (nasalised ) tend to be lost in the middle or at the end of a word in Manx, either with compensatory lengthening or vocalisation as U resulting in diphthongisation with the preceding vowel. For example, Manx ("winter") and ("mountains") correspond to Irish and (Southern Irish dialect spelling and pronunciation _gíre_ () and _sléte_ ()).[51] Another similarity to Munster Irish is the development of the Old Irish diphthongs before velarised consonants (spelled _ao_ in Irish and Scottish Gaelic) to in many words, as in ("carpenter") and ("narrow") (spelled and in Irish and Scottish, and pronounced virtually the same in Munster).[52]

Like western and northern dialects of Irish (cf. Irish phonology) and most dialects of Scottish Gaelic, Manx has changed the historical consonant clusters to . For example, Middle Irish ("mockery") and ("women") have become and respectively in Manx.[53] The affrication of to is also common to Manx, northern Irish, and Scottish Gaelic.[54]

Also like northern and western dialects of Irish, as well as like southern dialects of Scottish Gaelic (e.g. Arran, Kintyre), the unstressed word-final syllable of Middle Irish (spelled _-(a)idh_ and _-(a)igh_) has developed to in Manx, where it is spelled _-ee_, as in ("buy"; cf. Irish ) and ("apparatus"; cf. Gaelic ).[55]

Another property Manx shares with Ulster Irish and some dialects of Scottish Gaelic is that rather than appears in unstressed syllables before (in Manx spelling, _agh_), for example ("straight") (Irish ), ("to remember") (Gaelic ).[56]

Like southern and western varieties of Irish and northern varieties of Scottish Gaelic, but unlike the geographically closer varieties of Ulster Irish and Arran and Kintyre Gaelic, Manx shows vowel lengthening or diphthongisation before the Old Irish fortis and lenis sonorants. For example, ("children") , ("brown") , ("butter") correspond to Irish/Scottish Gaelic , , and respectively, which have long vowels or diphthongs in western and southern Irish and in the Scottish Gaelic dialects of the Outer Hebrides and Skye, thus western Irish , Southern Irish/Northern Scottish , , ), but short vowels and 'long' consonants in northern Irish, Arran, and Kintyre, , and .[57]

Another similarity with southern Irish is the treatment of Middle Irish word-final unstressed , spelled _-(e)adh_ in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. In nouns (including verbal nouns), this became in Manx, as it did in southern Irish, e.g. ("war") , ("to praise") ; cf. Irish and , pronounced and in southern Irish.[58] In finite verb forms before full nouns (as opposed to pronouns) became in Manx, as in southern Irish, e.g. ("would praise"), cf. Irish , pronounced in southern Irish.[59]

Linguistic analysis of the last few dozen native speakers reveals a number of dialectal differences between the northern and the southern parts of the island. Northern Manx is reflected by speakers from towns and villages from Maughold in the northeast of the island to Peel on the west coast. Southern Manx is used by speakers from the Sheading of Rushen. It is possible that written Manx represents a 'midlands' dialect of Douglas and surrounding areas.

In Southern Manx, older _á_ and in some cases _ó_ have become . In Northern Manx the same happens, but _á_ sometimes remains as well. For example, ("day", cf. Irish ) is in the south but or in the north. Old _ó_ is always in both dialects, e.g. ("young", cf. Irish ) is in both dialects.[60] In many words before _rt_, _rd_ and _rg_, and in one or two other words _á_, lengthened _a_ and _ó_ have become /œ:/, as in _paayrt_ 'part' /pœ:rt/, _ard_ 'high' /œ:rd/, _jiarg_ 'red' /dʒœ:rg/, _argid_ 'money, silver' /œ:rgid/ and _aarey_ 'gold GEN' /œ:rə/.

In Northern Manx, older _(e)a_ before _nn_ in the same syllable is diphthongised, while in Southern Manx it is lengthened but remains a monophthong. For example, ("head", cf. Irish ) is in the north but in the south.[61]

Words with _ua_ and in some cases _ao_ in Irish and Scottish are spelled with _eay_ in Manx. In Northern Manx, this sound is , while in Southern Manx it is , , or . For example, ("wind", cf. Irish ) is in the north and in the south, while ("coal", cf. Irish ) is in the north and , , or in the south.[62]

In both the north and the south, there is a tendency to insert a short sound before a word-final in monosyllabic words, as in for ("whole") and for ("woman"). This phenomenon is known as pre-occlusion. In Southern Manx, however, there is pre-occlusion of before and of before , as in for ("walking") and for ("ship"). These forms are generally pronounced without pre-occlusion in the north. Preocclusion of before , on the other hand, is more common in the north, as in ("heavy"), which is in the north but or in the south.[63] This feature is also found in Cornish.

Southern Manx tends to lose word-initial before , while Northern Manx usually preserves it, e.g. ("glen") is in the north and in the south, and ("knee") is in the north and in the south.[64]

Orthography

The Manx orthography is unlike that of Irish and Scottish Gaelic, both of which use similar spelling systems derived from written Early Modern Irish, which was language of the educated Gaelic elite of both Ireland and Scotland (where it was called Classical Gaelic) until the mid-19th century. In general, these orthographies retain spelling and derivation from older Gaelic, which means that there is not in a one-to-one system. Both systems use only 18 letters to represent around 50 phonemes. While Manx in effect uses the English spelling system, except for and , the 24 letters used in its orthography likewise do not cover a similar range of phonemes, and therefore many digraphs and trigraphs are used.

The Manx orthography was developed by people who were unaware of traditional Gaelic orthography, as they had learned literacy in Welsh and English (the initial development in the 16th century), then only English (later developments). Therefore, the orthography is based on early Modern English pronunciation, and to a small extent Welsh, rather than from a pan-Gaelic point of view.[65] The result is an inconsistent and only partially phonemic spelling system, in a similar way as spelling in English. T. F. O'Rahilly expressed the opinion that Gaelic in the Isle of Man was saddled with an inadequate spelling which is neither traditional nor phonetic; if the traditional Gaelic orthography had been preserved, the close kinship that exists between Manx Gaelic and Scottish Gaelic would be obvious to all at first sight.[66]

There is no evidence of Gaelic script having been used on the island.

Cedilla

Manx uses relatively few diacritics, but a cedilla is often (but not exclusively) used to differentiate between the two pronunciations of _ch_:

-   _Çhiarn_ (), meaning _lord_, is pronounced with the palato-alveolar affricate , as in the English "CHurch"
-   _Chamoo_ (), meaning _nor_ or _neither_, is pronounced with the velar fricative , as in the Scottish pronunciation of the word "loCH" (), a sound which is commonly represented by _gh_ at the ends of words in Manx (as it often is in the English of Ireland).

Examples

The following examples are taken from Broderick 1984–86, 1:178–79 and 1:350–53. The first example is from a speaker of Northern Manx, the second from Ned Maddrell, a speaker of Southern Manx.

She said that she used to say it when she was a little girl, but she has forgotten it all, and she wanted to learn it again to say it at a class or something.

Phonology

Consonants

The consonant phonemes of Manx are as follows:[69]

[TABLE]

: MANX CONSONANT PHONEMES

The voiceless plosives are pronounced with aspiration. The dental, postalveolar and palato-velar plosives are affricated to in many contexts.

Manx has an optional process of lenition of plosives between vowels, whereby voiced plosives and voiceless fricatives become voiced fricatives and voiceless plosives become either voiced plosives or voiced fricatives. This process introduces the allophones to the series of voiced fricatives in Manx. The voiced fricative may be further lenited to , and may disappear altogether. Examples include:[70]

Voiceless plosive to voiced plosive

-   > : "flag, rag"

-   > : "sin"

Voiceless plosive to voiced fricative

-   > : "cup"

-   > : "boat"

-   > : "tooth"

Voiced plosive to voiced fricative

-   > : "horse"

-   > : "face"

-   > : "prayer"

-   >  > : "stick"

-   > : "born"

Voiceless fricative to voiced fricative

-   > or : "married"

-   > : "stand"

-   > : "easy"

-   >  > : "beginning"

-   > : "live"

-   >  > ∅: "past"

Another optional process of Manx phonology is pre-occlusion, the insertion of a very short plosive consonant before a sonorant consonant. In Manx, this applies to stressed monosyllabic words (i.e. words one syllable long). The inserted consonant is homorganic with the following sonorant, which means it has the same place of articulation. Long vowels are often shortened before pre-occluded sounds. Examples include:[71]

-   > :  > "heavy"

-   > :  > "head"

-   > :  > "birds"

-   > :  > "ship"

-   > :  > "walking"

The trill is realised as a one- or two-contact flap at the beginning of syllable, and as a stronger trill when preceded by another consonant in the same syllable. At the end of a syllable, can be pronounced either as a strong trill or, more frequently, as a weak fricative , which may vocalise to a nonsyllabic or disappear altogether.[72] This vocalisation may be due to the influence of Manx English, which is itself a non-rhotic accent.[73] Examples of the pronunciation of include:

-   "snare"

-   "bread"

-   "big"

: Manx vowel phonemes

The status of and as separate phonemes is debatable, but is suggested by the allophony of certain words such as "is", "women", and so on. An alternative analysis is that Manx has the following system, where the vowels and have allophones ranging from through to . As with Irish and Scottish Gaelic, there is a large amount of vowel allophony, such as that of . This depends mainly on the 'broad' and 'slender' status of the neighbouring consonants:

Stress

Stress generally falls on the first syllable of a word in Manx, but in many cases, stress is attracted to a long vowel in the second syllable.[76] Examples include:

-   "sprite"

-   "busy"

-   "royal"

-   "advantage"


Morphology

Initial consonant mutations

Like all modern Celtic languages, Manx shows initial consonant mutations, which are processes by which the initial consonant of a word is altered according to its morphological and/or syntactic environment.[77] Manx has two mutations: LENITION and ECLIPSIS, found on nouns and verbs in a variety of environments; adjectives can undergo lenition but not eclipsis. In the late spoken language of the 20th century the system was breaking down, with speakers frequently failing to use mutation in environments where it was called for, and occasionally using it in environments where it was not called for.

: Initial consonant mutation in Manx

In the corpus of the late spoken language, there is also one example of the eclipsis (nasalisation) of : the sentence ("I have found the lamb"), where _ng_ is pronounced . However, probably this was a mis-transcription; the verbal noun in this case is not "get, fetch", but rather "find".[87]

Nouns

Manx nouns fall into one of two genders, masculine or feminine. Nouns are inflected for number. The plural is formed in a variety of ways, most commonly by addition of the suffix , but also by vowel change, changing to or or by adding other endings. There is usually no inflection for case, except in a minority of nouns that have a distinct genitive singular form, which is formed in various ways. (Most common is the addition of the suffix _-ey_ to feminine nouns.) Historical genitive singulars are often encountered in compounds even when they are no longer productive forms; for example "cowhouse" uses the old genitive of "cattle".[88] There are also traces of a dative singular in set phrases such as "on foot", contrasting with nominative and genitive (cf. "footwear", "football, soccer, rugby").[89]

Adjectives

Certain adjectives have plural as well as singular forms (through the addition _-ey_ ), although the use of the singular adjective with a plural noun is usual. Most adjectives end in _-agh_ and form their comparative/superlative form by replacing this with _-ee_ , e.g. _atçhimagh_ "terrible" becomes _atçhimee_, giving _ny s'atçhimee_ "more terrible" and _s'atçhimee_ "most terrible". As in Irish and Scottish Gaelic, the comparative-superlative is commonly marked by the copula verb _s_ (_is_) in the present, and _by_ in the past; the superlative is often shown by the word "nys" /nis/, from Middle Irish _ní as_ "thing that is" (cf. Irish _níos_, past _ní ba_).[90] A number of adjectives form their comparative/superlative irregularly:

The comparative/superlative can also be formed using "more" with the positive form e.g. = .

Pronouns

In common with Irish and Scottish Gaelic, in addition to its regular personal pronouns, Manx has also a series used for emphasis. Under certain phonological circumstances, these can be used as unemphatic pronouns, e.g. "you were not" is as sounds too similar to "they/he/she was not".

Notice the only difference between the masculine and feminine third person singular possessive pronouns is the initial sound change, namely lenition and h-prefixing, they cause, e.g. "her laptop", "his laptop", _e ooh_ "his egg", _e hooh_ "her egg".

An alternative to using the possessive pronouns is to precede a noun with the definite article and follow it with the inflected form of "at" to show the person, e.g. "my house" (literally "the house at me") instead of "my house". This is especially useful in the plural, where all persons share one possessive pronoun, e.g. "their house", as opposed to "our/your/their house".

+-----------------+-----------+----------+------------+
| Person          | Regular   | Emphatic | Possessive |
+=================+===========+==========+============+
| First singular  |           |          | ^([1])     |
+-----------------+-----------+----------+------------+
| Second singular |           |          | ^([1])     |

2.^ Causes eclipsis.

Verbs

Manx verbs generally form their finite forms by means of periphrasis: inflected forms of the auxiliary verbs "to be" or "to do" are combined with the verbal noun of the main verb. Only the future, conditional, preterite, and imperative can be formed directly by inflecting the main verb, but even in these tenses, the periphrastic formation is more common in Late Spoken Manx.[91] Examples:

+-----------------+----------------------------+----------------+----------------+
| Tense           | Periphrastic form          | Inflected form | Gloss          |
|                 | (literal translation)      |                |                |
+=================+============================+================+================+

: MANX FINITE VERB FORMS

The future and conditional tenses (and in some irregular verbs, the preterite) make a distinction between "independent" and "dependent" forms. Independent forms are used when the verb is not preceded by any particle; dependent forms are used when a particle (e.g. "not") does precede the verb. For example, "you will lose" is with the independent form ("will lose"), while "you will not lose" is with the dependent form (which has undergone eclipsis to after ). Similarly "they went" is with the independent form ("went"), while "they did not go" is with the dependent form .[94] This contrast is inherited from Old Irish, which shows such pairs as ("(s)he carries") vs. ("(s)he does not carry"), and is found in Scottish Gaelic as well, e.g. ("will take") vs. ("will not take"). In Modern Irish, the distinction is found only in irregular verbs (e.g. ("saw") vs. ("did not see").

The fully inflected forms of the regular verb "to throw" are as follows. In addition to the forms below, a past participle may be formed using : "thrown".

1.^ First person singular, making the use of a following subject pronoun redundant

2.^ First person plural, making the use of a following subject pronoun redundant

3.^ Used with all other persons, meaning an accompanying subject must be stated, e.g. "he will throw", "they will throw"

: Forms of verb "to be"

Adverbs

Manx adverbs can be formed from adjectives by means of the word (< Middle Irish _go_ "with, until"), e.g. "good", "well" (CF. Irish _maith_, _go maith_, Gaelic _math_, _gu maith_); "cheerful", "cheerfully". This is not used when preceded by such words as "too" and "very" or followed by "enough", e.g. "very good, very well", "cheerful(ly) enough". The prepositional phrase for "home(wards)" is formed with "to" and the noun "place, town, homestead" to give , Cf. Irish _abhaile_, older _do bhaile_, whereas the noun "house, home" can be used unchanged to convey the same meaning.

The language has a number of adverbs corresponding to English "up" and "down", the meaning of which depend upon such things as motion or lack thereof and starting point in relation to the speaker.

+-----------------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
|                                   | above the speaker | below the speaker |
+===================================+===================+===================+
| Stationary                        |                   |                   |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
| Movement towards the speaker from |                   |                   |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
| Movement away from the speaker to |                   |                   |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+

: Manx adverbs expressing "up" and "down"

Examples of practical usage are "There's a man down the street" and "I'm going down the street", "Climb up (towards me)" and "Climb up (away from me)".

Prepositions

Like the other Insular Celtic languages, Manx has so-called inflected prepositions, contractions of a preposition with a pronominal direct object, as the following common prepositions show. Note the sometimes identical form of the uninflected preposition and its third person singular masculine inflected form.

: Conjugation of Manx prepositions using pronominal ending

In addition to the above "simple" prepositions, Manx has a number of prepositional phrases based on a noun; being based on nouns, the possessive personal pronouns are used to refer to what would in English be pronominal prepositional objects. This also happens in English phrases such as "for my sake".

Syntax

Like most Insular Celtic languages, Manx uses verb–subject–object word order: the inflected verb of a sentence precedes the subject, which itself precedes the direct object.[96] However, as noted above, most finite verbs are formed periphrastically, using an auxiliary verb in conjunction with the verbal noun. In this case, only the auxiliary verb precedes the subject, while the verbal noun comes after the subject. The auxiliary verb may be a modal verb rather than a form of ("be") or ("do"). Particles like the negative ("not") precede the inflected verb. Examples:

+---------------------------------------+-----+--------+
|                                       |     |        |
+---------------------------------------+-----+--------+
|                                       |     |        |
+---------------------------------------+-----+--------+
| put-                                  | the | priest |
+---------------------------------------+-----+--------+
| "The priest put his hand on her."[97] |     |        |
+---------------------------------------+-----+--------+

 

+----------------------------------------+-----+-------+------+
|                                        |     |       |      |
+----------------------------------------+-----+-------+------+
|                                        |     |       |      |
+----------------------------------------+-----+-------+------+

+----------------------------------------+-----+-------+------+
| "The lambs used to eat the gorse."[98] |     |       |      |
+----------------------------------------+-----+-------+------+

 

+-------------------------------+-----+------+------+----------+
|                               |     |      |      |          |
+-------------------------------+-----+------+------+----------+
|                               |     |      |      |          |
+-------------------------------+-----+------+------+----------+
| not                           | can | you- | see- | anything |

| "You can't see anything."[99] |     |      |      |          |
+-------------------------------+-----+------+------+----------+

When the auxiliary verb is a form of ("do"), the direct object precedes the verbal noun and is connected to it with the particle :

+-----------------------------+------+----+-------+--+
|                             |      |    |       |  |
+-----------------------------+------+----+-------+--+
|                             |      |    |       |  |
+-----------------------------+------+----+-------+--+
| did                         | they | my | voice |  |
+-----------------------------+------+----+-------+--+
| "They heard my voice."[100] |      |    |       |  |
+-----------------------------+------+----+-------+--+

As in Irish (cf. Irish syntax#The forms meaning "to be"), there are two ways of expressing "to be" in Manx: with the substantive verb , and with the copula. The substantive verb is used when the predicate is an adjective, adverb, or prepositional phrase.[101] Examples:

+----------------------------+----+-------------------+
|                            |    |                   |
+----------------------------+----+-------------------+
| is                         | it | awful/frightening |
+----------------------------+----+-------------------+
| "It is awful/frightening." |    |                   |
+----------------------------+----+-------------------+

 

+--------------+----+------+
|              |    |      |
+--------------+----+------+
| is           | he | well |
+--------------+----+------+
| "He is well" |    |      |
+--------------+----+------+

 

+---------------------------------+----+----+-----+-----------------+
|                                 |    |    |     |                 |
+---------------------------------+----+----+-----+-----------------+
| is                              | he | in | the | house-ale (pub) |
+---------------------------------+----+----+-----+-----------------+
| "He is in the ale-house (pub)." |    |    |     |                 |
+---------------------------------+----+----+-----+-----------------+

Where the predicate is a noun, it must be converted to a prepositional phrase headed by the preposition ("in") + possessive pronoun (agreeing with the subject) in order for the substantive verb to be grammatical:

+--------------------------------------------------------+----+--------+-----+------+
|                                                        |    |        |     |      |
+--------------------------------------------------------+----+--------+-----+------+
| is                                                     | he | in-his | man | good |
+--------------------------------------------------------+----+--------+-----+------+
| "He is a good man" (lit. "He is in his good man")[102] |    |        |     |      |
+--------------------------------------------------------+----+--------+-----+------+

Otherwise, the copula is used when the predicate is a noun. The copula itself takes the form or in the present tense, but it is often omitted in affirmative statements:

+------------------------+---------+----+
|                        |         |    |
+------------------------+---------+----+
|                        | Manxman | me |
+------------------------+---------+----+
| "I am a Manxman."[103] |         |    |
+------------------------+---------+----+

 

+------+-----+-----+
|      |     |     |
+------+-----+-----+
| this | the | man |
+------+-----+-----+

In questions and negative sentences, the present tense of the copula is :

+----------------------+--+----+-----+
|                      |  |    |     |
+----------------------+--+----+-----+
| not                  |  | me | him |
+----------------------+--+----+-----+
| "I am not him."[104] |  |    |     |
+----------------------+--+----+-----+

 

+--------------------------+------+-----+------+
|                          |      |     |      |
+--------------------------+------+-----+------+
|                          | this | the | book |
+--------------------------+------+-----+------+
| "Is this the book?"[105] |      |     |      |
+--------------------------+------+-----+------+


Vocabulary

Manx vocabulary is predominantly of Goidelic origin, derived from Old Irish and closely related to words in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. However, Manx itself, as well as the languages from which it is derived, borrowed words from other languages as well, especially Latin, Old Norse, French (particularly Anglo-Norman), and English (both Middle English and Modern English).[106]

Loanwords

, a Manx breed of primitive sheep. The name means "mousy grey" in Manx.]] Foreign loanwords are primarily Norse and English, with a smaller number coming from French. Some examples of Norse loanwords are _garey_ ("garden", from _garðr_, "enclosure") and _sker_ meaning a sea rock (from _sker_, compare with _skjær_ and _sker_). Examples of French loanwords are _danjeyr_ ("danger", from _danger_) and _vondeish_ ("advantage", from _avantage_).

English loanwords were common in late (pre-revival) Manx, e.g. _boy_ ("boy"), _badjer_ ("badger"), rather than the more usual Gaelic _guilley_ and _brock_. Henry Jenner, on asking someone what he was doing, was told _Ta mee smokal pipe_ ("I am smoking a pipe"), and that "[he] certainly considered that he was talking Manx, and not English, in saying it." In more recent years, there has been a reaction against such borrowing, resulting in coinages for technical vocabulary. Despite this, calques exist in Manx, not necessarily obvious to its speakers.

Some religious terms come ultimately from Latin, Greek and Hebrew, e.g. _casherick_ (holy), from the Latin _consecrātus_; _mooinjer_ (people) from the Latin _monasterium_ (originally a monastery; _agglish_ (church) from the Greek _ἐκκλησία_ (_ekklesia_, literally meaning assembly) and _abb_ (abbot) from the Hebrew "אבא" (_abba_, meaning "father"). These did not necessarily come directly into Manx, but via Old Irish. In more recent times, _ulpan_ has been borrowed from modern Hebrew. Many Irish and English loanwords also have a classical origin, e.g. _çhellveeish_ (Irish _teilefís_) and _çhellvane_ meaning television and telephone respectively. Foreign language words (usually known via English) are used occasionally especially for ethnic food, e.g. chorizo, spaghetti.

To fill gaps in recorded Manx vocabulary, revivalists have referred to modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic for words and inspiration.

Going in the other direction, Manx Gaelic has influenced Manx English (Anglo-Manx). Common words and phrases in Anglo-Manx originating in the language include _tholtan_ (the "th" is pronounced as a "t") meaning a ruined farmhouse, _quaaltagh_ meaning a first-foot, _keeill_ meaning a church (especially an old one), _cammag_, _traa-dy-liooar_ meaning "time enough", and Tynwald (_tinvaal_), which is ultimately of Norse origin, but comes via Manx. It is suggested that the House of Keys takes its name from _Kiare as Feed_ (four and twenty), which is the number of its sitting members.

[49] Jackson 1955, 66. Jackson claims that northern Irish has also lost the contrast between velarised and palatalised labials, but this seems to be a mistake on his part, as both Mayo Irish and Ulster Irish are consistently described as having the contrast (cf. Mhac an Fhailigh 1968, 27; Hughes 1994, 621; see also Ó Baoill 1978, 87)
