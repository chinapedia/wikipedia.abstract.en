[1][2] The drug was acquired by Pfizer in 2005 [3] and then sold to Conatus Pharmaceuticals in 2010.[4] Conatus in turn licensed emricasan to Novartis in 2017 for exclusive development and commercialization.[5]

The substance acts as a pan-caspase inhibitor and has antiapoptotic and antiinflammatory effects.[6] It was developed for the treatment of liver disease[7] and has been granted fast track designation by the FDA for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis[8][9][10] The susbtance is the first pan-caspase inhibitor to advance to broad clinical testing, and its novel mechanism of action has led to research using it for other potential applications.[11][12]
