LLUÍS PLANAGUMÀ RAMOS (born 25 October 1980) is a Spanish football manager, currently in charge of Hércules CF.


Career

Born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Planagumà started his managerial career on RCD Espanyol's youth categories. After eleven seasons in charge, he left the club and joined CE Pubilla Casas.[1]

In December 2011, Planagumà was appointed UDA Gramenet manager in Tercera División, after previously starting the campaign in charge of the B-side.[2] After only two matches in charge he left the club, and moved to fellow league team Villarreal CF C.[3]

In July 2012, Planagumà was confirmed as manager of the reserves in Segunda División B.[4] On 3 June 2014 he returned to his former club Espanyol, being appointed at the helm of the B-team also in the third division.[5]

On 29 June 2016, after rejecting a renewal offer from Espanyol, Planagumà moved to another reserve team, taking over Granada CF's reserves.[6] On 28 September, after Paco Jémez's dismissal, he was named as interim first team manager in La Liga.[7]

Planagumà appeared in his first match as a professional on 1 October 2016, a 0–1 home defeat against newly promoted CD Leganés.[8] He was subsequently replaced by Lucas Alcaraz, and returned to his previous duties.[9]

On 23 June 2017, Planagumà was named manager of UCAM Murcia CF, newly relegated from Segunda División.[10] The following 11 June, he was appointed at the helm of Hércules CF.[11]
