IVAN MARION GREENBERG (8 December 1896 â€“ 11 March 1966) was an English journalist. He served as the editor of _The Jewish Chronicle_ from 1935 to 1946. He was a Revisionist Zionist.[1]


Early life

Ivan Greenberg was born in 1896 in London.[2][3] His father, L. J. Greenberg, was the editor of _The Jewish Chronicle_ and close to Theodore Herzl;[4] his mother was Marion Gates.[5] During World War I, he served in the Royal Artillery.[6]


Journalistic career

Greenberg worked as a journalist in South Africa and Australasia.[7] He became editorial assistant at _The Jewish Chronicle_ in 1925.[8] He served as its editor from 1935 to 1946,[9][10] when he was fired by the managing director David F. Kessler.[11] Under his editorial leadership, the JC took a decidedly Zionist stance.[12] Kessler dismissed him on the grounds that he was too divisive, and he was succeeded by John Maurice Shaftesley.[13]


Political activism

Greenberg was a proponent of Vladimir Jabotinsky's Revisionist Zionism.[14] Additionally, he routinely criticised Britain's foreign policy towards Palestine (later known as Israel).[15] During World War II, he called for European Jews to be allowed to emigrate to Palestine, and he became associated with the Committee for a Jewish Army.[16]

Greenberg translated _The Revolt_ by Menachem Begin into English.[17][18]


Death

Greenberg died on 11 March 1966 in London.[19][20]
