_YUEBEIPOTAMON CALCIATILE_ is a species of potamid crab from hill streams and pools in north Guangdong, China.[1][2] Although essentially a freshwater crab, its long legs are believed to allow it to easily walk over land between streams.[3] It was first discovered in a Chinese pet market.[4][5] It is the only species in the genus _YUEBEIPOTAMON_. The legs and claws are bright red to purplish and the carapace, which typically is between wide, is mainly maroon to dark brown.[6]
