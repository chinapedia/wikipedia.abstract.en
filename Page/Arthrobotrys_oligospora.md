_ARTHROBOTRYS OLIGOSPORA_ was discovered in Europe in 1850 by Georg Fresenius.[1][2] 'A. oligospora' is the model organism for interactions between fungi and nematodes.[3] It is the most common nematode capturing fungus,[4][5][6] and most widespread nematode trapping fungus in nature.[7][8] It was the first species of fungi documented to actively capture nematodes.[9][10] The species epithet, _oligospora_, derives from the Greek, ολιγο ('oligo') meaning "few" and σπορά ('spora') meaning "spores".


Growth and morphology

This fungus reproduces by means of 2-celled, pear-shaped conidia, in which the cells are of unequal size with the smaller cell nearer to the attachment point on the conidiophore.[11][12] During germination, the germ tube typically erupts from the smaller cell.[13] In environments rich with nematodes, the spores range from 22-32 by 12-20 µm,[14][15] though the spores are smaller in environments devoid of nematodes.[16][17] Conidium germination has a success rate of 100% but the formation of trapping organs are not always observed.[18] Conidia have been found to disintegrate both in the air and on impact with an agar plate.[19] Condiophores and conidia grow from hyphae sprouted outside of a trapped dead nematode,[20] and condiophores have been found to change and grow into art of the adhesive net.[21] Under ideal conditions, a colony can reach 65 mm in diameter after 7 days incubation,[22] with colourless, pale pink or yellow mycelium.[23] The optimal growth temperature for the fungus in nematode-free and nematode-infested environments is and , respectively.[24] The growth rate of colonies is greater in the presence of light than in darkness.[25]


Physiology

_A. oligospora_ is considered a saprobe and is more saprotrophic than other nematode capturing fungi.[26][27] At first the fungus was considered largely saprophytic in nature but this interpretation was later questioned.[28] Saprophytic growth uses D-xylose, D-mannose, and cellobiose.[29] The fungus uses nitrite, nitrate, and ammonium for its nitrogen sources and uses pectin, cellulose, and chitin for its carbon sources.[30] When predating on nematodes, the fungus uses cellobiose, L-asparagine, L-arginine, DL glutamic acid for its carbon and nitrogen sources.[31]

Nematode capturing

Predation of nematodes occurs in low nitrogen environments,[32] as the nematode becomes the main nitrogen source for the fungi.[33] It has been found that the presence of ammonium causes a higher decrease of predation when compared to presence of nitrate or nitrite.[34] Adding green manure or carbohydrates has been found to increase nematode trapping behaviors.[35] A complex 3 dimensional net of hyphae is formed to trap the nematodes under conditions of pH 4.9-8.1 and a temperature less than .[36][37][38][39] Nematodes, and specifically "nemin" (an extract derived from nematodes) were found to stimulate net formation.[40][41] Nematodes are not as attracted to _A. oligospora_ colonies that have not manifested traps, suggesting that these structures serve an additional attractant role possibly through the expression of pheromones.[42][43]

A full net is not needed to catch nematodes as smaller nematodes can be caught with a single loop.[44] Lectins are used in attaching nematode to fungi[45] The entire surface of net is covered in adhesive material.[46][47] Strong adhesion keeps the nematode trapped and when the nematode struggles, it often results in multiple points of adhesion of the nematode to the net.[48][49] It was even found that the adhesion of the nematode to the fungus remained under washing of agar plate with water.[50] The net is flexible which results in 'hyphal drag' tiring the nematode.[51] Multiple points of adhesion and 'hyphal drag' allow the net to be capable of catching both large and small nematodes easily.[52] _In vitro_, bait nematodes are consumed often leaving _Bunonema_ nematodes.[53]

A substance found in paralyzed nematodes was found to be capable of paralyzing healthy nematodes,[54][55] and it was later determined that a paralyzing substance, Subtilisin (A serine protease),[56] is excreted into nematode.[57][58] An unstable toxin was thought to be made by the fungus,[59][60] and it was later found that toxic levels of linoleic acid for nematodes (lethal dose of linoleic acid for _C. elegans_ is 5–10 μg/ml)[61] were found in the fungus.[62][63] Enzymatic hyphal invasion, likely using collagenases which are found in 'Arthrobotrys',[64] of a trapped nematode is followed by the digestion of contents of the nematode.[65][66] Shortly after hyphal invasion, a hyphal bulb appears where hyphae grow outwards from the bulb along the entire body of the nematode.[67]

Not all nematodes are caught by the net as the nematode needs to be in contact with the net for a short period of time in order for adhesion to occur.[68] Nematodes were found to quickly move away from any net followed by curling if instantaneous contact occurs.[69][70] The nematode then proceeds to move forward until out of the area of the net and unless prolonged contact is made the nematode is safe.[71] This means one or several instantaneous contacts are not enough for adhesion between the nematode and net to occur.[72]

No competing fungi or bacteria are found in nematodes which are being consumed by the fungus which means it is possible an antibiotic is released inside the nematode.[73] In 1993, secondary metabolites (oligosporon, oligosporol A, and oligosporal B) which can act as antibiotics were found in the fungus.[74][75] Oligosporon, oligosporol A, oligosporal B have hemolytic effects and are cytotoxic to nematodes, however they are not toxic to the _C. elegans_.[76] Other oligosporon-type secondary metabolites also found in _A. oligospora_ include (4S,5R,6R)-4′,5′- dihydrooligosporon, (4S,5R,6R)-hydroxyoligosporon, and (4S,5R,6R)-10′11 ′-epoxyoligosporon.[77]

Net formation

A branch of hyphae grows out of a vegetative hyphae eventually arching back to the parent hyphae and fuses with it to make a loop.[78][79][80] This process repeats from any hyphae along any existing branches or a new parent hyphae.[81][82] The nets are immediately adhesive,[83] and hyphae in the loop have different organelles to trap nematodes which are not found in vegetative cells.[84]


Habitat and ecology

_A. oligospora_ has been found in many different geographical regions which include Asia, Africa, North America & South America and Australasia.[85] Some countries it has been found in include Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Poland, Canada, New Zealand, and India.[86] The presence of insects infected by nematodes increased presence of _A. oligospora_ but not other nematode capturing fungi.[87]

The fungus can be found in soil in grassland, shrubland, plantations, sheep and cattle yards,[88] and domesticated and non-domesticated animal feces.[89] It colonizes forest steppe soil, mixed forest soil, and Mediterranean brown soil (pH 6.9-8.0) where the pH can be as low as 4.5, but is typically above 5.5.[90] The fungus has also been found in aquatic environments,[91] and heavily polluted areas, specifically heavy metal poisoned mines, fungicide, or nematicide infested soil,[92][93] decayed plant material, leaves, roots, moss,[94] and in the rhizosphere of various bean plants, barley,[95][96] and the tomato plant.[97] Larger populations of the fungus can be found in late spring and summer.[98]


Industrial uses

The fungus is a biological indicator of nematodes.[99] The annual global cost of plant-parasitic nematodes is approximately 100 billion USD.[100] Nematode capturing fungi such as the _A. oligospora_ can be used to control growth of nematodes.[101][102] This means that they can be potentially used as a bio-control agent to protect crops against nematode infestations.[103] This may not be feasible since the nematodes occasionally eat the fungi.[104]
