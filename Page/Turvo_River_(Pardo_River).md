The TURVO RIVER () is a river in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. It joins the Pardo River in the town of Barra do Turvo. The Pardo is in turn a tributary of the Ribeira de Iguape River.

The Rio Turvo State Park is named after the river, which has several waterfalls and rapids along its course through the park.[1] The Barreiro/Anhemas Sustainable Development Reserve lies on the right bank of the river.[2]
