DENISE MASSON (5 August 1901[1] – 10 November 1994), nicknamed "the Lady of Mrrakech", was a 20th-century French islamologist who translated the Quran from Arabic into French, published in 1967. According to her colleague André Chouraqui, she may have been inspired by the Latin translation of Louis Maracci (1698), repeated by Christian Reineccius.[2]
