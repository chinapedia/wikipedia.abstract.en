Nu metal became popular in the late 1990s with bands and artists such as Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Kid Rock all releasing albums that sold millions of copies. Nu metal's popularity continued during the early 2000s, with bands such as Papa Roach, Staind, and P.O.D. all selling multi-platinum albums, and came to a peak with Linkin Park's diamond-selling album _Hybrid Theory_. However, by the the oversaturation of bands combined with the under-performance of a number of releases led to nu metal's decline, leading to the rise of metalcore and many nu metal bands disbanding or abandoning their established sound in favor of other genres.

During the 2010s, there has been a minor nu metal revival; many bands that combine nu metal with other genres (for example, metalcore) emerged and some nu metal bands from the 1990s and early 2000s returned to the nu metal sound.

Terminology and origins

Nu metal is also known as nü-metal[1][2] and aggro-metal.[3][4] It is a subgenre of alternative metal.[5][6] MTV states that the early nu metal group Korn "arrived in 1993 into the burgeoning alternative metal scene, which would morph into nü-metal the way college rock became alternative rock."[7] _Stereogum_ has similarly claimed that nu metal was a "weird outgrowth of the Lollapalooza-era alt-metal scene".[8] Nu metal merges elements of heavy metal music[9][10][11] with elements of other music genres such as grunge,[12] hip hop,[13][14] and alternative rock.[15]

Nu metal bands have been influenced by and have used elements of a variety of musical genres, including electronic music, funk, gothic rock, hardcore punk, punk rock, dance music, new wave, jazz, post-punk, symphonic rock and synth-pop.[16][17][18][19] Nu metal bands also are influenced by and use elements of genres of heavy metal music such as death metal, rap metal, groove metal, funk metal, and thrash metal.[20][21] Some nu metal bands, such as Static-X[22] and Dope,[23] made nu metal music with elements of industrial metal. In contrast with other heavy metal subgenres, nu metal tends to use the same structure of verses, choruses and bridges as those in pop music.[24][25]

Musical characteristics

Instrumentation

(_pictured_) cites bassists such as Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers and Les Claypool of Primus as influences.[26][27]]]

Nu metal is heavily syncopated and is based mostly on guitar riffs.[28] Mid-song bridges and a general lack of guitar solos contrasts it with other genres of heavy metal.[29][30] Kory Grow of _Revolver_ wrote, "... [i]n its efforts to tune down and simplify riffs, effectively drove a stake through the heart of the guitar solo".[31] Another contrast with other heavy metal genres is nu metal's emphasis on rhythm, rather than on complexity or mood, often its rhythm sounds like that of groove metal.[32] The wah pedal is occasionally featured in nu metal music.[33] Nu metal guitar riffs occasionally are similar to those of death metal.

Nu metal bassists and drummers are often influenced by funk and hip hop, respectively, adding to nu metal's rhythmic nature.[34][35] Blast beats, which are common in heavy metal subgenres such as black metal and death metal, are extremely rare in nu metal.[36] Nu metal's similarities with many heavy metal subgenres include its use of common time, distorted guitars, power chords and note structures primarily revolving around Dorian, Aeolian or Phrygian modes.[37] While loud and heavily distorted electric guitars are a core feature of all metal genres, nu metal guitarists took the sounds of "violence and destruction" to new levels with their overdriven guitar tone, which music journalists Kitts and Tolinski compared to the "...sound [of] a Mack truck being crushed by a collapsing skyscraper."[38]

Some nu metal bands use seven-string guitars[39] that are generally down-tuned,[40][41] rather than traditional Likewise, some bass guitarists use five-string and six-string instruments.[42] in nu metal often features an emphasis on funk elements.[43] In nu metal music, DJs are sometimes featured to provide instrumentation such as sampling, turntable scratching and electronic backgrounds. tends to have hip hop grooves and rhythms.[44][45]

Vocals

Vocal styles used in nu metal music include singing, rapping,[46][47] screaming[48][49] and growling.[50] Vocals in nu metal are often rhythmic and influenced by hip hop.[51] Although some nu metal bands, such as Limp Bizkit[52] and Linkin Park[53][54] have rapping in their music, some nu metal bands, such as Godsmack[55] and Staind,[56] do not feature rapping.

Nu metal bands occasionally feature hip hop musicians as guests in their songs; Korn's song "Children of the Korn" features the rapper Ice Cube, who performed on the band's 1998 Family Values Tour.[57][58] The hip hop musician Nas was featured on Korn's song "Play Me", which is on the band's album _Take a Look in the Mirror_.[59] Limp Bizkit has recorded with multiple hip hop musicians including Method Man,[60] Lil Wayne,[61] Xzibit,[62] Redman,[63] DMX[64] and Snoop Dogg.[65] Linkin Park collaborated with hip hop musician Jay Z on their 2004 extended play _Collision Course_.[66] Kid Rock has recorded with hip hop musicians Eminem[67] and Snoop Dogg.[68] Trevor Baker of _The Guardian_ wrote, "Bands such as Linkin Park, Korn and even the much reviled Limp Bizkit ... did far more to break down the artificial barriers between 'urban music' and rock than any of their more critically acceptable counterparts."[69]

Lyrics

Lyrics in nu metal songs are often angry or nihilistic;[70][71] many of the genre's lyrics focus on topics such as pain,[72][73] angst,[74][75] bullying,[76] emotional issues,[77][78] abandonment,[79][80] betrayal,[81] and personal alienation,[82][83] in a way similar to those of grunge.[84][85][86][87] A lot of nu metal lyrics that are about these topics tend to be in a very direct tone.[88] However, some songs have lyrics that are about other topics. P.O.D. have used positive lyrics about promise and hope.[89] The nu metal[90] song "Bodies" by Drowning Pool is about moshing.[91] Saliva guitarist Wayne Swinny said that the band's song "Badass" was "meant to be one of those 'sports anthem kind of songs'".[92] _The Michigan Daily_ wrote about Limp Bizkit's lyrics, writing that the band "used the nu-metal sound as a way to spin testosterone fueled fantasies into snarky white-boy rap. Oddly, audiences took frontman Fred Durst more seriously than he wanted, failing to see the intentional silliness in many of his songs".[93] Limp Bizkit's lyrics also have been described as misogynistic. Dope's lyrics are usually about sex, drugs, parties, women, violence and relationships.[94] According to Josh Chesler of the _Phoenix New Times_, the lyrics of Deftones, who were once a nu metal band, "tend to have complex allusions and leave the songs open to many different interpretations."[95]

Fashion

Nu metal clothing typically consists of baggy pants,[96][97][98][99] shirts, and shorts,[100][101] JNCO jeans,[102][103] Adidas tracksuits,[104] sports jerseys,[105] baseball caps,[106] baggy hoodies,[107] cargo pants, and sweatpants.[108] Nu metal hairstyles and facial hairstyles include dreadlocks,[109] spiky hair,[110][111] chin beards,[112][113] bald heads,[114][115] goatees,[116] frosted tips,[117] and bleached or dyed hair.[118][119] Common accessories in nu metal fashion include wallet chains,[120][121][122] tattoos,[123][124][125] and piercings,[126][127][128][129] especially facial piercings.[130][131] Nu metal fashion has been compared to hip hop fashion.[132]

Some nu metal bands such as Motograter,[133] Mushroomhead,[134] Mudvayne,[135][136] and Slipknot[137][138] wear masks, jumpsuits, costumes, face paint, corpse paint or body paint. A few nu metal bands, such as Coal Chamber,[139] Evanescence,[140] and Kittie,[141] are known for having gothic appearances.


History

1980s–1993: Predecessors and influences

, thrash metal, punk rock and funk.[142]]]

Many heavy metal, alternative metal, industrial, funk metal, alt ernative rock, rap metal, and industrial metal artists and bands of the 1980s and early 1990s have been credited with laying groundwork for the development of nu metal by combining heavy guitar riffs with pop music structures and drawing influences from subgenres of heavy metal and other music genres; Faith No More,[143][144] Primus,[145][146] Helmet,[147][148] Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E., Tool,[149] Fear Factory, 24-7 Spyz, Hot Dawgz, Fishbone, Biohazard, Suicidal Tendencies, Infectious Grooves, Godflesh,[150] Red Hot Chili Peppers,[151][152] Nine Inch Nails,[153][154] White Zombie,[155] Mr. Bungle,[156] Prong,[157] Rage Against the Machine,[158] and Ministry[159] all have been highlighted as examples of this.

Groove metal and thrash metal bands of the same period such as Machine Head, Sepultura,[160][161] Metallica,[162][163] Pantera,[164] Slayer,[165] and Anthrax[166] all have been cited as influential to nu metal as well. For example, Anthrax pioneered the rap metal genre by combining hip hop and rap with heavy metal on their 1987 EP _I'm the Man_,[167] which laid groundwork for development.[168] Korn's lead vocalist Jonathan Davis said about Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell, "if there was no Dimebag Darrell, there would be no Korn".[169]

helped create rap rock in the 1980s with hip hop groups such as the Beastie Boys and Run-D.M.C.[170]]]

In the 1990s, bands described as "neo-metal" by the author Garry Sharpe-Young emerged; these bands include Pantera, Strapping Young Lad, Machine Head, Biohazard and Fear Factory. Sharpe-Young wrote that these bands "had chosen to strip metal down to its raw, primal element" and that "neo-metal paved the way for nu-metal".[171]

Nu metal is often influenced by hip hop.[172] hip hop musicians Dr. Dre and Ice Cube have been a big influence on nu metal creators and pioneers Korn;[173][174] guitarist Munky said the band were trying to emulate the samples of Dr. Dre's 1992 album _The Chronic_.[175] Munky and fellow Korn guitarist Head also said they tried to emulate samples by the hip hop group Cypress Hill.[176][177] Both the Geto Boys and N.W.A. also have been a major influence on Korn.[178] Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit has cited the hip hop group The Fat Boys as a major influence on him.[179] The nu metal band Papa Roach cited rapper Nas and hip hop groups and Fugees as influences.[180][181] Shifty Shellshock of the nu metal band Crazy Town cited Run–D.M.C. and Beastie Boys as influences.[182] Josey Scott of the nu metal band Saliva cited LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Public Enemy, N.W.A., Chuck D, Doug E. Fresh, and Whodini as influences.[183] Sonny Sandoval of the nu metal band P.O.D. cited hip hop groups Boogie Down Productions and Run–D.M.C. as influences.[184] Linkin Park member Mike Shinoda's hip hop influences include Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, N.W.A., and the Juice Crew.[185] Chester Bennington, another member of Linkin Park, cited A Tribe Called Quest, KRS-One, Run–D.M.C., Public Enemy, N.W.A., Beastie Boys, and Rob Base as influences.[186] Beastie Boys are a hip hop music group that influenced nu metal.[187] Hip hop group Run–DMC was one of the first groups to combine rap with rock,[188][189] paving the way for nu metal.[190]

1993–1998: Early development and rise

Joel McIver acknowledged Korn as the band that created and pioneered the nu metal genre with its demo _Neidermayer's Mind_, which was released in 1993. McIver also acknowledged Korn as the band that started the new wave of American heavy metal, which is a heavy metal music movement that started in the 1990s.[191][192] The aggressive riffs of Korn, the rapping of Limp Bizkit, and the melodic ballads of Staind created the sonic template for nu metal.[193] The origins of the term "nu metal" are often attributed to the work of producer Ross Robinson, who has been called "The Godfather of Nu Metal" between producers. Robinson has produced for nu metal bands such as Korn,[194][195] Limp Bizkit[196] and Slipknot.[197][198] Many of the first nu metal bands, such as Korn[199] and Deftones,[200] came from California; however, the genre soon spread across the United States and many bands arose from various states, including Limp Bizkit from Florida,[201] Staind from Massachusetts, and Slipknot from Iowa.[202] In the book _Brave Nu World_, Tommy Udo wrote about the nu metal band Coal Chamber, "There's some evidence to suggest that Coal Chamber were the first band to whom the tag 'nu metal' was actually applied, in a live review in Spin magazine."

"most nü-metal track".[203] }}

In 1994, Korn released their self-titled debut album, which is widely considered the first nu metal album.[204][205] Korn had experienced underground popularity at this time; their debut album peaked at number 72 on the _Billboard_ 200.[206] In the same year, P.O.D.'s album _Snuff the Punk_ was also released, which was later recognized as another early example of nu metal.[207] In 1995, the band Sugar Ray released its debut studio album _Lemonade and Brownies_, an album described as nu metal.[208] In 1995, Deftones released their debut album _Adrenaline_. The album peaked at number 23 on the Heatseekers Albums chart on October 5, 1996.[209] Deftones also were temporarily controversial in 1996 when their vocalist Chino Moreno was blamed by TV news reports for a riot that occurred at the 1996 U-Fest festival.[210] Deftones' 1997 album _Around the Fur_ peaked at number 29 on the _Billboard_ 200 on November 15, 1997.[211] Both _Adrenaline_ and _Around the Fur_ were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the summer of 1999._Adrenaline_ and _Around the Fur_ were certified platinum by the RIAA in September 2008 and June 2011, respectively.

Sepultura's 1996 album _Roots_ features nu metal elements that were considered influential to the genre,[212][213] while _Roots_ itself was influenced by Korn's self-titled debut album.[214][215][216] Few bands were playing nu metal until 1997 when bands such as Coal Chamber,[217] Limp Bizkit,[218] and Papa Roach[219] all released their debut albums. Attention through MTV and Ozzy Osbourne's 1995 introduction of Ozzfest was integral to the launching of the careers of many nu metal bands, including Limp Bizkit in 1998.

Nu metal began to rise in popularity when Korn's 1996 album _Life Is Peachy_ peaked at number 3 on the _Billboard_ 200[220] and sold 106,000 copies in its first week of release. In 1997, Sugar Ray released its second studio album _Floored_. The album achieved mainstream success very quickly and was certified 2x platinum by the RIAA on February 20, 1998. Although _Floored_ is a nu metal album,[221] the only song from the album that achieved chart success was the song "Fly",[222] which is instead a reggae song.[223] Although Sugar Ray continued to be extremely popular,[224] the band abandoned the nu metal genre and became a pop rock band with its 1999 studio album _14:59_.[225]

American Head Charge, Primer 55, Adema, Cold, the Union Underground, Dope, Apartment 26, Hed (Planet Earth) and Skrape—all of whom released albums between 2000 and 2001—left more of a collective impression than individual ones".[331]

Linkin Park's remix album _Reanimation_ was released in July 2002[341] and sold more than a million copies that year, which MTV described as "impressive for a remix album".[342] Trapt's 2002 song "Headstrong" launched the band into the mainstream; the song peaked at number 16 on the _Billboard_ Hot 100,[343] number 4 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart[344] and number 1 on the _Billboard_ Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.[345] Trapt's song "Still Frame" peaked at number 69 on the _Billboard_ Hot 100.[346] The band's self-titled album was certified platinum by the RIAA in 2003.

Johnny Loftus of AllMusic noted the nu metal sound of the album.[347] _Fallen_{{'s}} Grammy Award-winning[348][349] lead single "Bring Me to Life" peaked at number 5 on the _Billboard_ Hot 100 chart[350] and number 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart.[351] In 2003, Linkin Park's album _Meteora_ peaked at number 1 on the _Billboard_ 200[352] and sold at least 810,000 copies in its first week of being released.[353] _Meteora_ by Linkin Park and _Fallen_ by Evanescence ranked third and fourth respectively on the best-selling albums of 2003.[354] Both Linkin Park and Evanescence released high-charting singles throughout 2003 to _Fallen_ by Evanescence sold at least 7,600,000 copies in the United States[355] and _Meteora_ by Linkin Park sold at least 6,100,000 copies in the United States.[356] In 2003, Korn released a song called "Did My Time", which peaked at number 38 on the _Billboard_ Hot 100.[357] That same year, Godsmack released their third studio album _Faceless_, which peaked at number 1 on the _Billboard_ 200[358][359] and was certified platinum by the RIAA in its first five weeks of being released.[360]

2003–2009: Decline

Most of nu metal's mainstream popularity sharply declined in 2003 and 2004.[361][362][363] After a period of mainstream success with bands such as Godsmack, Trapt, Linkin Park and Evanescence, nu metal declined in popularity. Limp Bizkit's 2003 album _Results May Vary_, which features alternative rock music[364] and peaked at number 3 on the _Billboard_ 200,[365] with sales of at least 325,000 copies in its first week of being released.[366] In three weeks of being released, the album had sold at least 500,000 copies.[367] In 2004, Blabbermouth.net reported that, according to Nielsen SoundScan, _Results May Vary_ sold 1,337,356 copies in the United States.[368] However, the album garnered very poor critical reception[369] and consequently performed much weaker than previous Limp Bizkit albums such as _Significant Other_ and _Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water_.[370] Although Korn's album _Take a Look in the Mirror_{{'s}} song "Did My Time" peaked at number 38 on the _Billboard_ Hot 100,[371] the album sold less than previous Korn albums _Issues_ and _Untouchables_.[372] In 2004, post-punk revival bands such as Jet and The Darkness were achieving mainstream success as the popularity of nu metal declined.[373] During the the popularity of emo exceeded the declining popularity of nu metal.[374] Also, during the metalcore, a fusion of extreme metal and hardcore punk, became one of the most popular genres in the new wave of American heavy metal.[375]

In the mid-to-late 2000s, many nu metal bands experimented with other genres and sounds. Linkin Park's third studio album _Minutes to Midnight_, released in 2007, was noted for its complete departure from the band's nu metal sound.[376] Nu metal bands such as Disturbed[377][378] and Drowning Pool[379] moved to a hard rock or standard heavy metal sound. Slipknot also departed from their nu metal sound[380] and included elements of groove metal, death metal and thrash metal into their music.[381][382] Staind and Papa Roach moved to lighter sounds.[383][384] Staind's 2003 album _14 Shades Of Grey_ does not express as much anger as the band's previous albums[385] and shows the band's departure from heavy metal elements and a movement towards a lighter sound.[386] Papa Roach abandoned the nu metal genre with their 2004 album _Getting Away with Murder_,[387] moving to a hard rock style.[388][389]

Soulfly moved away from the nu metal style[390][391][392] and moved to styles such as death metal[393] and thrash metal.[394][395] Kittie abandoned the style and started making music with elements of genres such as black metal and death metal.[396] Korn and Mudvayne continued being mainstream during the mid-2000s. Nonetheless, they did not completely abandon the nu metal style. Korn combined their earlier sound with influences from other genres, such as industrial. Korn's songs "Coming Undone" and "Twisted Transistor", which both are on their 2005 album _See You on the Other Side_, both reached the _Billboard_ Hot 100;[397] Pop music producers The Matrix helped produce the album.[398] Mudvayne's 2005 album _Lost and Found_ was seen as gravitating towards a more accessible sound.[399] The album's song "Happy?" peaked at number 89 on the _Billboard_ Hot 100 and at number 91 on _Billboard_{{'s}} Pop 100 chart.[400] In 2005, Limp Bizkit released a record called _The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)_ without promoting and advertising the record.[401] The album was not very popular;[402] its sales fell 67% during its second week of release.[403] In 2006, Limp Bizkit went on hiatus.[404]

2010–present: Recent years

During the 2010s, there was a discussion within media of a possible nu metal revival because of bands fusing nu metal with other genres, the return of nu metal bands, extant bands going back to the nu metal genre and nu metal bands forming.[405][406][407][408][409] Despite the lack of radio play and popularity, some nu metal bands recaptured some of their former popularity as they released albums in a nu metal style. Korn's 2010 studio album _Korn III: Remember Who You Are_ sold 63,000 copies during its first week of release and peaked at number 2 on the _Billboard_ 200.[410] As of December 6, 2011, the album had sold at least 185,000 units in the United States.[411] Korn's vocalist Jonathan Davis said with their new album the band "want to go back to that old-school vibe".[412] He also said "It's gonna be very raw, it's gonna be old school like the first Korn records".[413]

In 2011, Limp Bizkit's sixth studio album _Gold Cobra_ was released; it sold 27,000 copies during its first week in the United States and peaked at number 16 on the _Billboard_ 200.[414][415] That same year, Staind's self-titled album was released; it shows the band returning to their heavier nu metal style.[416] The album debuted at number 5 on the _Billboard_ 200, selling 47,000 copies in its first week of release, making it the band's fifth consecutive top-five album.[417] In October 2011, Evanescence's self-titled album debuted at number 1 on the _Billboard_ 200 and other United States charts and sold over 127,000 copies in the first week.[418] In December that year,[419] Korn released their album _The Path of Totality_, which sold 55,000 copies in its first week.[420] The album combines nu metal with dubstep.[421] Both the _Phoenix New Times_ and the _LA Weekly_ cited _The Path of Totality_ as a new direction for nu metal.[422][423] The album won a Revolver Golden God award for "Album of the Year".[424]

is one of several metalcore bands that added elements of nu metal to later albums.]]

In 2014, Linkin Park returned to their nu-metal roots with their sixth studio album _The Hunting Party_.[425] The album peaked at number three on the _Billboard_ 200, with first-week sales of 110,000 copies in the United States.[426] In 2014, Slipknot released its fifth studio album _.5: The Gray Chapter_. With _.5: The Gray Chapter_, Slipknot returned to the nu metal genre.[427] _.5: The Gray Chapter_ peaked at number one on the _Billboard_ 200.[428]

Many metalcore and deathcore groups[429] such as Emmure,[430][431][432] Of Mice & Men,[433][434][435] Suicide Silence,[436][437] and Issues,[438][439] all gained moderate popularity in the 2010s for drawing influence from nu metal. This fusion has sometimes been referred to as NU METALCORE.[440] Suicide Silence's 2011 album _The Black Crown_, which features elements of nu metal and deathcore,[441] peaked at number 28 on the _Billboard_ 200.[442][443] In 2014, Issues' self-titled debut album peaked at number 9 on the same chart.[444] The album features elements of metalcore, nu metal, pop and R&B.[445] Of Mice & Men's 2014 album _Restoring Force_, which features elements of nu metal,[446] peaked at number 4 on the _Billboard_ 200.[447] Bring Me the Horizon, previously known for a much heavier style of music, released their fifth album _That's the Spirit_, which peaked at number 2 on the _Billboard_ 200, in 2015.[448] The album draws from multiple genres, including nu metal; however, the band completely abandoned their metalcore style.[449][450] In the mid–late 2010s, genres like emo rap and trap metal emerged.[451][452]


Reception and controversy

Despite its popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s, nu metal has often been criticized by many fans of heavy metal music,[453][454] often being labelled with derogatory terms such as "mallcore" and "whinecore". Gregory Heaney of AllMusic called nu metal "one of metal's more unfortunate pushes into the mainstream".[455] Lucy Jones of _NME_ called nu metal "the worst genre of all time".[456] In ''Metal: The Definitive Guide : Heavy, NWOBH, Progressive, Thrash, Death ... '', Garry Sharpe-Young described as "a dumbed-down and—thankfully short[-]lived exercise".[457] When Machine Head moved to the nu metal genre with their album _The Burning Red_ and their vocalist Robb Flynn spiked his hair in the fashion of many nu metal musicians, the band were accused of "selling out" and many fans criticized their change of appearance and musical style.[458][459] Machine Head's drummer Dave McClain said, "Pissing people off isn't a bad thing, you know? For people to be narrow-minded is bad ... [i]t doesn't bother us at all, we know we're going to piss people off with this record, but some people hopefully will actually sit down and listen to the whole record".[460] Robb Flynn, Machine Head's vocalist, said

Jonathan Davis, the vocalist of Korn, spoke about the criticism of nu metal from heavy metal fans, saying Lamb of God's vocalist Randy Blythe criticized the nu metal genre and spoke about its loss of popularity in 2004, saying, "Nu-metal sucks, so that's why that's dying off. And I think ... ... people are ready for angrier music. I think people are ready for something that's real, not, you know, 'I did it all for the nookie.'"[461] Dave Mustaine of the heavy metal band Megadeth said he would "rather have his eyelids pulled out" than listen to nu metal.[462] Gary Holt, a member of the thrash metal bands Exodus and Slayer, said that he "was so glad about" the decline of .[463] Despite the large amount of criticism that the genre received, Jack Porter of _The Michigan Daily_ defended , writing Additionally, Jody Macgregor of FasterLouder called nu metal "music's most hated genre" and wrote that nu metal is "not as bad as people think".[464]

Some musicians who influenced nu metal have tried to distance themselves from the subgenre and its bands. Mike Patton, the vocalist of Faith No More and Mr. Bungle, tried to distance himself from the subgenre and criticized it, even though he is featured on the song "Lookaway" on heavy metal band Sepultura's album _Roots_, which also features Jonathan Davis.[465] Patton said of his music's influence on nu metal, "I feel no responsibility for that, it's their mothers' fault, not mine".[466] Helmet member Page Hamilton said, "It's frustrating that people write [us] off because we're affiliated with or credited with or discredited with creating and rap metal ... which we sound nothing like".[467] However, Page Hamilton appeared on the song "All for Nothing" on Linkin Park's album _The Hunting Party_,[468]

While Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails has said he knows some Korn members and that he thinks they are "cool guys",[469] he also criticized nu metal, saying:

In response to reports that Fred Durst, lead singer of Limp Bizkit, is a big fan of Tool, the latter's vocalist Maynard James Keenan said, "If the lunch-lady in high school hits on you, you appreciate the compliment, but you're not really gonna start dating the lunch-lady, are ya?"[470] While Durst has cited Rage Against the Machine as a major influence,[471][472] Tim Commerford of Rage Against the Machine is open about hating Limp Bizkit's music. At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Limp Bizkit won the Best Rock Video category for their song "Break Stuff", beating Rage Against the Machine's "Sleep Now in the Fire".[473] When Limp Bizkit accepted their award, Commerford went on stage and climbed up a backdrop, rocking back and forth.[474][475] After the incident, Commerford was arrested and spent a night in jail.[476][477] Years later, Tim Commerford called Limp Bizkit "one of the dumbest bands in the history of music".[478] Years later, Commerford also said, "I do apologize for Limp Bizkit. I really do. I feel really bad that we inspired such bullshit ... They're gone, though. That's the beautiful thing."[479][480]

Rejection of nu metal label

Some nu metal musicians have rejected the label nu metal and have tried to distance themselves from it. Slipknot prefer to distance themselves from other nu metal groups, describing their own music as "metal metal" and equate their link to nu metal as a coincidence of their time of emergence.

Jonathan Davis has rejected the nu metal label, saying "We're not 'rap rock,' we're not 'nu-metal ... We might have invented a new genre of heavy music or rock, but I believe the term 'nu-metal' was made up for all the bands that followed us. Those guys to me are nu-metal. And we're just Korn."[481] In 2014, Davis spoke about the nu metal label, saying:

Staind's vocalist Aaron Lewis rejected the nu metal label, saying, "if we get called a 'nu metal' band one more time, I don't even know what I'm going to do!"[482] Chino Moreno, vocalist of Deftones, rejected the nu metal label saying "We told motherfuckers not to lump us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we aren't going to be with them".[483] As Deftones abandoned the nu metal sound of their early work, Moreno tried to distance himself from nu metal bands and began to criticize the bands and their albums, including Korn's 2002 album _Untouchables_; he said, "As Korn go on, it's the same things—bad childhoods and mean moms. It gets too old after a while. How old is Jonathan [Davis]? Thirty? How long has it been since he lived with his parents?"[484][485] Davis responded saying, "Obviously, Chino hasn't listened to the words on the rest of my albums because they're nothing about my parents or my childhood."[486] Moreno also said, "A big problem for me was opening for Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park, two bands that wouldn't exist if it weren't for me, straight up!".[487] Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park spoke about the nu metal label in an interview with _NME_, saying "We never held the flag for nu-metal—it was associated with frat rock. Arrogant, misogynistic, and full of testosterone; we were reacting against that."[488][489] Wes Borland of Limp Bizkit said that he "never liked or condoned" the term "nu metal" in any way, and said he does not understand "how so many bands that sound nothing alike can be put into" the nu metal genre.[490] Mike Wengren of Disturbed said that he doesn't think Disturbed "were ever a nu-metal band to begin with".[491]

Despite the fact that multiple nu metal musicians rejected the nu metal label, Limp Bizkit's vocalist Fred Durst defended it, saying "Nu metal let people open up and it meant something to people. It really did."[492] Coal Chamber's vocalist Dez Fafara also defended nu metal. He said he is proud to be associated with the subgenre[493] and that nu metal bands "broke new musical ground" saying, "I think 'hair metal' was cheesy. [But] I think 'nu metal' was different. I think what's beautiful about 'nu metal' is it's different. And you've got so many different influences."[494] Chester Bennington of Linkin Park said he accepted the nu metal label, saying:

Association with heavy metal

In addition to criticizing nu metal, many heavy metal musicians and fans of heavy metal music have rejected nu metal as a legitimate subgenre of heavy metal, saying it is not "true heavy metal".[495][496] Some nu metal musicians have tried to distance themselves from being heavy metal at all. For example, Korn's Jonathan Davis rejected the "heavy metal" label.[497][498][499] When talking with _Vice_, Davis spoke about Korn being called a heavy metal band, saying, "I never thought of us to be metal to begin with. Yeah, we're heavy and downtuned, but metal, to me, is like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. That's metal, man. I always thought of us as a funk band. That funky, groovy shit."[500] Godsmack's vocalist Sully Erna also rejected the "heavy metal" label and said he views Godsmack as a hard rock band.[501][502] Though he was originally more tolerant of the concept,[503] Linkin Park's vocalist Chester Bennington later expressed some disagreement with his band being labeled a heavy metal group because he felt the term limited the scope of the band's actual style. He elaborated:
