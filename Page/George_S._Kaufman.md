GEORGE SIMON KAUFMAN (16 November 1889 – 2 June 1961) was an American playwright, theatre director and producer, humorist, and drama critic. In addition to comedies and political satire, he wrote several musicals for the Marx Brothers and others. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the musical _Of Thee I Sing_ (with Morrie Ryskind and Ira Gershwin) in 1932, and won again in 1937 for the play _You Can't Take It with You_ (with Moss Hart). He also won the Tony Award for Best Director in 1951 for the musical _Guys and Dolls_.


Early years

George S. Kaufman was born to Joseph S. Kaufman, a hatband manufacturer,[1] and Nettie Meyers[2] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He had a younger sister, Ruth.[3] His other sister was Helen, nicknamed "Helse." He graduated from high school in 1907 and studied law for three months. He grew disenchanted and took on a series of odd jobs,[4] selling silk[5] and working in wholesale ribbon sales.[6]


Career

Kaufman began contributing humorous material to the column that Franklin P. Adams wrote for the _New York Mail_. He became close friends with F.P.A., who helped him get his first newspaper job—humor columnist for _The Washington Times_—in 1912. By 1915 he was a drama reporter on _The New York Tribune_, working under Heywood Broun. In 1917 Kaufman joined _The New York Times_, becoming drama editor and staying with the newspaper until 1930.[7]

Kaufman took his editorial responsibilities seriously. According to legend, on one occasion a press agent asked: "How do I get our leading lady's name in the _Times_?" Kaufman: "Shoot her."[8]

Theatre

in 1937]] Kaufman's Broadway debut was September 4, 1918 at the Knickerbocker Theatre, with the premiere of the melodrama _Someone in the House_.[9][10] He coauthored the play with Walter C. Percival, based on a magazine story written by Larry Evans.[11] The play opened on Broadway (running for only 32 performances) during that year's serious flu epidemic, when people were being advised to avoid crowds. With "dour glee", Kaufman suggested that the best way to avoid crowds in New York City was to attend his play.[12]

In every Broadway season from 1921 through 1958, there was a play written or directed by Kaufman. Since Kaufman's death in 1961,[13] there have been revivals of his work on Broadway in the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s, the 2000s and the 2010s.[14] Kaufman wrote only one play alone, _The Butter and Egg Man_ in 1925.[15] With Marc Connelly, he wrote _Merton of the Movies_, _Dulcy_, and _Beggar on Horseback_; with Ring Lardner he wrote _June Moon_; with Edna Ferber he wrote _The Royal Family_, _Dinner at Eight_, and _Stage Door_; with John P. Marquand he wrote a stage adaptation of Marquand's novel _The Late George Apley_; and with Howard Teichmann he wrote _The Solid Gold Cadillac_. According to his biography on PBS, "he wrote some of the American theater's most enduring comedies" with Moss Hart.[16] Their work includes _Once in a Lifetime_ (in which he also performed), _Merrily We Roll Along_, _The Man Who Came to Dinner_ and _You Can't Take It with You_, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937.[17]

For a period, Kaufman lived at 158 West 58th Street in New York City. The building later would be the setting for _Stage Door_.[18] It is now the Park Savoy Hotel and for many years was considered a single room occupancy hotel.[19]

Musical theatre

Despite his claim that he knew nothing about music and hated it in the theatre, Kaufman collaborated on many musical theatre projects. His most successful of such efforts include two Broadway shows crafted for the Marx Brothers, _The Cocoanuts_, written with Irving Berlin, and _Animal Crackers_, written with Morrie Ryskind, Bert Kalmar, and Harry Ruby. According to Charlotte Chandler, "By the time _Animal Crackers_ opened ... the Marx Brothers were becoming famous enough to interest Hollywood. Paramount signed them to a contract".[20] Kaufman was one of the writers who excelled in writing intelligent nonsense for Groucho Marx, a process that was collaborative, given Groucho's skills at expanding upon the scripted material. Though the Marx Brothers were notoriously critical of their writers, Groucho and Harpo Marx expressed admiration and gratitude towards Kaufman. Dick Cavett, introducing Groucho onstage at Carnegie Hall in 1972, told the audience that Groucho considered Kaufman to be "his god".

While _The Cocoanuts_ was being developed in Atlantic City, Irving Berlin was hugely enthusiastic about including the song "Always", which he had written as a wedding present for his bride. Kaufman was less enthusiastic, and refused to rework the libretto to include this number. The song ultimately a huge hit for Berlin, recorded by many popular performers. According to Laurence Bergreen, "Kaufman's lack of enthusiasm caused Irving to lose confidence in the song, and 'Always' was deleted from the score of _The Cocoanuts_ – though not from its creator's memory. ... Kaufman, a confirmed misogynist, had had no use for the song in _The Cocoanuts_ but his disapproval did not deter Berlin from saving it for a more important occasion."[21] _The Cocoanuts_ would remain Irving Berlin's only Broadway musical – until his last one, _Mr. President_ – that did not include at least one eventual hit song.

Humor derived from political situations was of particular interest to Kaufman. He collaborated on the hit musical _Of Thee I Sing_, which won the 1932 Pulitzer Prize, the first musical so honored,[22] and its sequel _Let 'Em Eat Cake_, as well as one troubled but eventually successful satire that had several incarnations, _Strike Up the Band_. Working with Kaufman on these ventures were Ryskind, George Gershwin, and Ira Gershwin. Also, Kaufman, with Moss Hart, wrote the book to _I'd Rather Be Right_, a musical starring George M. Cohan as Franklin Delano Roosevelt (the U.S. President at the time), with songs by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. He also co-wrote the 1935 comedy-drama _First Lady_. In 1945, Kaufman adapted _H.M.S. Pinafore_ into _Hollywood Pinafore_.

Kaufman also contributed to major New York revues, including _The Band Wagon_ (which shared songs but not plot with the 1953 film version) with Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz. His often anthologized sketch "The Still Alarm" from the revue _The Little Show_ lasted long after the show closed. Another well-known sketch of his is "If Men Played Cards As Women Do." There have also been musicals based on Kaufman properties, such as the 1981 musical version of _Merrily We Roll Along_, adapted by George Furth and Stephen Sondheim.[23] The musical _Sherry!_ (1967) was based on his play _The Man Who Came to Dinner_.[24]

Directing and producing

'' (1928)]] and Broderick Crawford]] Kaufman directed the original or revival stage productions of many plays and musicals, including_The Front Page_ by Charles MacArthur and Ben Hecht (1928), _Of Thee I Sing_ (1931 and 1952), _Of Mice and Men_ by John Steinbeck (1937), _My Sister Eileen_ by Joseph Fields and Jerome Chodorov (1940), _Hollywood Pinafore_ (1945), _The Next Half Hour_ (1945), _Park Avenue_ (1946, also co-wrote the book), _Town House_ (1948), _Bravo!_ (1948, also co-wrote the script), _Metropole_ (1949), the Frank Loesser musical _Guys and Dolls_, for which he won the 1951 Best Director Tony Award, _The Enchanted_ (1950), _The Small Hours_ (1951, also co-wrote the script), _Fancy Meeting You Again_ (1952, also co-wrote the script), _The Solid Gold Cadillac_ (1953, also co-wrote the script), and _Romanoff and Juliet_ by Peter Ustinov (1957).[25]

Kaufman produced many of his own plays as well as those of other writers. For a short time, approximately from 1940 to circa 1946, Kaufman, with Moss Hart and Max Gordon, owned and operated the Lyceum Theatre.[26]

Film and television

Many of Kaufman's plays were adapted into Hollywood films. Among the more well-received were _Dinner At Eight_, _Stage Door_ (almost completely rewritten by others for the film version) and _You Can't Take It with You_ (changed significantly by others for the film version), which won the Best Picture Oscar in 1938. He also occasionally wrote directly for the movies, most significantly the screenplay for _A Night at the Opera_ for the Marx Brothers. His only credit as a film director was _The Senator Was Indiscreet_ (1947) starring William Powell.

From 1949 until midway through the 1952–1953 season, he appeared as a panelist on the CBS television series _This Is Show Business_.[27][28] On the December 21, 1952 episode of the show—telecast live—Kaufman made an offhand remark about the excessive airing of "Silent Night" during the Christmas season. "Let's make this one program," he said, "on which no one sings 'Silent Night'." The resulting public outcry prompted his dismissal by CBS.[29] In response, Fred Allen said, "There were only two wits on television: Groucho Marx and George S. Kaufman. Without Kaufman, television has reverted to being half-witted."[30] It would be more than a year before Kaufman appeared on TV again.[31]

Bridge

Kaufman was a prominent player of bridge, probably both auction bridge and contract bridge. _The New Yorker_ published many of his humorous items about the card game; at least some have been reprinted more than once, including:

-   "Kibitzers' Revolt" and the suggestion that bridge clubs should post notice whether the North–South or the East–West pairs are holding good cards.[32]
-   Kaufman was notoriously impatient with poor players. One such partner asked permission to use the men's room, according to legend, and Kaufman replied: "Gladly. For the first time today I'll know what you have in your hand."[33][34]
-   On sitting South: (1) "No matter who writes the books or articles, South holds the most terrific cards I ever saw. There is a lucky fellow if ever I saw one." [35] (2) Oswald Jacoby reported a deal that Kaufman played marvelously in 1952, after which he cracked, "I'd rather sit South than be the President."[36]
-   On , "I'd like a review of the bidding with all the original inflections."[37]

His first wife Beatrice Bakrow Kaufman was also an avid bridge player, and an occasional poker player with Algonquin men, who wrote at least one _New Yorker_ article on bridge herself, in 1928.[38]


Personal life

in 1934]]

In the 1920s, Kaufman was a member of the Algonquin Round Table, a circle of writers and show business people. From the 1920s through the 1950s, Kaufman was as well known for his personality as he was for his writing. In the Moss Hart autobiography _Act One_, Hart portrayed Kaufman as a morose and intimidating figure, uncomfortable with any expressions of affection between human beings—in life or on the page. Hart writes that Max Siegel said: "Maybe I should have warned you. Mr Kaufman hates any kind of sentimentality--can't stand it!"[39] This perspective, along with a number of taciturn observations made by Kaufman himself, led to a simplistic but commonly held belief that Hart was the emotional soul of the creative team while Kaufman was a misanthropic writer of punchlines. Kaufman preferred never to leave Manhattan. He once said: "I never want to go any place where I can't get back to Broadway and 44th by midnight."[40]

Called "Public Lover Number One", he "dated some of the most beautiful women on Broadway".[41] Kaufman found himself in the center of a scandal in 1936 when, in the midst of a child custody suit, the former husband of actress Mary Astor threatened to publish one of Astor's diaries purportedly containing extremely explicit details of an affair between Kaufman and the actress.[42] The diary was eventually destroyed unread by the courts in 1952, but details of the supposed contents were published in _Confidential_ magazine, _Hollywood Babylon_ by Kenneth Anger, and various other scandal sheets. Some of the sexually explicit portion, involving Kaufman, were reprinted in _New York_ magazine in 2012 and _Vanity Fair_ magazine in 2016.[43][44] Kaufman had an affair with actress Natalie Schafer during the 1940s.[45] Kaufman joined the theatre club, The Lambs, in 1944.[46]

Kaufman was married to his first wife Beatrice from 1917 until her death in 1945.[47][48] They had one daughter, Anne Kaufman (Booth).[49] Four years later, he married actress Leueen MacGrath on May 26, 1949,[50] with whom he collaborated on a number of plays before their divorce in August 1957. Kaufman died in New York City on June 2, 1961, at the age of 71.[51] His granddaughter, Beatrice Colen, was an actress who had recurring appearances on both _Happy Days_ and _Wonder Woman_.[52]

In 1979, Donald Oliver compiled and edited a collection of Kaufman's humorous pieces, with a foreword by Dick Cavett.[53]


Portrayals

Kaufman was portrayed by the actor David Thornton in the 1994 film _Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle_[54] and by Jason Robards in the 1963 film _Act One_. In the 2014 Broadway adaptation of the latter by James Lapine, he was played by Tony Shalhoub.

The title character of the 1991 Coen brothers film _Barton Fink_ bears a strong physical resemblance to Kaufman.[55]
