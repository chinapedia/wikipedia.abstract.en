_REVERSE DECEPTION: ORGANIZED CYBER THREAT COUNTER-EXPLOITATION_ is a textbook which investigates two topics; first it provides methods and criteria to rectify Advanced Persistent Threats.[1] and secondly it covers cyber deception where in an IEEE review it was noted as a "masterful presentation of deception".[2] It details how to identity APTs and prioritize actions by applying skilled field-tested private- and government- sector processes and methods which often involves cyber deception.[3]


Content

Identified by Richard Austin in an IEEE review as a "masterful presentation of deception",[4] it is clear why this work is of interest to different governments with several currently involved in or considering future actions in weaponizing cyber capabilities. It appears on the recommended reading lists for notable U.S. military institutions including the U.S. Navy War College in the Counterintelligence: Cyber Threat section[5] and at the Joint Special Operations University[6] site. Other military organizations have made efforts in a similar manner. In the People's Republic of China (PRC) considered to be the most active in the APT market,[7] a special military effort was undertaken to translate it into Simplified Chinese at the PRC National Defense University Press.[8]

The authors introduce the first theory and model for classifying a threat on the opportunistic-APT continuum as either persistent on non-persistent. It is now widely used in the industry and is built off evaluation of these following criteria:[9][10][11]

APT CRITERIA[12]

-   Objectives
-   Timeliness
-   Resources
-   Risk tolerance (by the adversary)
-   Skills and methods
-   Actions
-   Attack origination points
-   Numbers involved in the attack
-   Knowledge source

SOME ADDITIONAL CONTENT INCLUDES:[13]

-   Threat Intelligence
-   Analysis of cyber espionage tactics contrasted with types of permissible countermeasures
-   How to use deception and disinformation campaigns
-   Case studies and real stories from the authors’ FBI, DOD, NSA, and private sector work.
-   Value Chain Management
-   Counter espionage and espionage
-   Legal interpretations of capacities, limitations, and stipulations for assisting law enforcement investigations.
