History

KAMALAPATI PALACE lies on the eastern side of the ancient embankment known as Bhojpal, built by the Parmara King Bhoj (AD 1010-1055) from which the present name Bhopal is derived. The existing structure is a part of the palace which was constructed by RANI KAMLAPATI, the widow of Nizam Shah, General Chief of Ginnogarh in AD 1722. On the Western side of this palace are the remains of Fatehgarh Fort on the hill which was built by Sardar Dost Mohammad of Bhopal (AD 1708-1726) who laid the foundation of modern Bhopal. KAMLAPATI PALACE is an example of contemporary secular architecture of the early eighteenth century and the earliest extant example in the Bhopal Town. This double storied building is constructed of lakhauri bricks having a facade with cusped arches supported on the fluted pillars, merlons having the shape of lotus petals and brackets supporting the Chhajjas.This monument was declared protected by the Government of India in 1989 and since then Archaeological Survey of India remains the custodian.
