Military Academy}} A MILITARY ACADEMY or SERVICE ACADEMY (in the United States) is an educational institution which prepares candidates for service in the officer corps. It normally provides education in a military environment, the exact definition depending on the country concerned.

Three types of academy exist: pre-school-level institutions awarding academic qualifications, university-level institutions awarding bachelor's degree level qualification, and those preparing officer cadets for commissioning into the armed services of the state.

A naval academy is either a type of military academy (in the broad sense of that term) or is distinguished from one (in the narrow sense). In U.S. usage, the United States Military Academy and the United States Naval Academy are both service academies.


History

The first military academies were established in the 18th century to provide future officers for technically specialized corps, such as engineers and artillery, with scientific training.

The Royal Danish Naval Academy was set up in 1701, making it the oldest military academy in existence.[1] The Royal Military Academy, Woolwich was set up in 1720[2] as the earliest military academy in Britain. Its original purpose was to train cadets entering the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers. In France, the École Royale du Génie at Mézières was founded in 1748, followed by a non-technical academy in 1751, the École Royale Militaire offering a general military education to the nobility. French military academies were widely copied in Prussia, Austria, Russia and even minor powers, including Turin and the Kingdom of Savoy, in the late 18th century.

By the turn of the century, under the impetus of the Napoleonic Wars and the strain that the armies of Europe subsequently came under, military academies for the training of commissioned officers of the army were set up in most of the combatant nations. These military schools had two functions: to provide instruction for serving officers in the functions of the efficient staff-officer, and to school youngsters before they gained an officer's commission.[3] The Kriegsakademie in Prussia was founded in 1801 and the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr was created by order of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802 as a replacement for the École Royale Militaire of the Ancien Régime (the institution that Napoleon himself had graduated from).

The Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in England was the brainchild of John Le Marchant in 1801,[4] who established schools for the military instruction of officers at High Wycombe and Great Marlow, with a grant of £30,000 from Parliament. The two original departments were later combined and moved to Sandhurst. In the United States, the military academy at West Point was founded in 1802 and became popular in the 1860s.


Types

Pre-collegiate institutions

A military school teaches children (primarily boys) of various ages (elementary school, middle school or high school) in a military environment which includes training in military aspects, such as drill. Many military schools are also boarding schools, and others are simply magnet schools in a larger school system. Many are privately run institutions, though some are public and are run either by a public school system (such as the Chicago Public Schools) or by a state.

A common misconception results because some states have chosen to house their juvenile criminal populations in higher-security boarding schools that are run in a manner similar to military boarding schools. These are also called reform schools, and are functionally a combination of school and prison. They attempt to emulate the environment of military boarding schools in the belief that a strict structured environment can reform these children. This may or may not be true. However, their environment and target population are different from those of military schools.[5]

Popular culture sometimes shows parents sending or threatening to send unruly children off to military school (or boarding school) to teach them good behavior (e.g., in the "Army of One" episode of _The Sopranos_, Tony and Carmela Soprano consider sending their son, AJ, to the Hudson Military Institute). A similar situation appears in _Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure_, while other fictional depictions don't show military academies as punishment (threats) (ex. _Damien: Omen II_ and _The Presidio_.

Adult institutions

A college-level MILITARY ACADEMY is an institute of higher learning of things military. It is part of a larger system of military education and training institutions. The primary educational goal at military academies is to provide a high quality education that includes significant coursework and training in the fields of military tactics and military strategy. The amount of non-military coursework varies by both the institution and the country, and the amount of practical military experience gained varies as well.

Military academies may or may not grant university degrees. In the U.S., graduates have a major field of study, earning a Bachelor's degree in that subject just as at other universities. However, in British academies, the graduate does not achieve a university degree, since the whole of the one-year course (nowadays undertaken mainly but not exclusively by university graduates) is dedicated to military training.

There are two types of military academies: national (government-run) and state/private-run.

-   Graduates from national academies are typically commissioned as officers in the country's military. The new officers usually have an obligation to serve for a certain number of years. In some countries (e.g. Britain) all military officers train at the appropriate academy, whereas in others (e.g. the United States) only a percentage do and the service academies are seen as institutions which supply service-specific officers within the forces (about 15 percent of US military officers).
-   State or private-run academy graduates have no requirement to join the military after graduation, although some schools have a high rate of graduate military service. Today, most of these schools have ventured away from their military roots and now enroll both military and civilian students. The only exception in the United States is the Virginia Military Institute which remains all-military.

Canada

Royal_Military_College_of_Canada_band_piper_and_bugler,_Remembrance_Day.jpg band piper and bugler. Established in 1876, the College is Canada's only post-secondary military college with degree-granting powers.]] Canada currently has one military-theme private boarding school open for students at the pre-university level, Robert Land Academy (RLA), which is located in West Lincoln, Ontario. Founded in 1978, it is an all-boys' institute whose funding arises solely from tuition fees. The Academy is an institute fully accredited by the province of Ontario, which accepts students from Grade 6 to Grade 12 (the Ontario Academic Credit level).

Canada formerly had three university level service academies, the Canadian Military Colleges. These included the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) in Kingston, Ontario, Royal Roads Military College (RRMC) in Victoria, British Columbia and the Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean (CMR) in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Québec. RMC was founded in 1876, RRMC in 1941 and CMR in 1954.[11] By the 1960s all three institutions were providing military education to officer cadets of all three elements in the Canadian Forces; the navy, army and air force; and RMC received the authority to grant academic degrees in Arts, Science and Engineering.[12]

Graduates of the Colleges are widely acknowledged to have had a disproportionate impact in the Canadian services and society, thanks to the solid foundations provided by their military education.[13] Military discipline and training, as well as a focus on physical fitness and fluency in both of Canada's two official languages, English and French, provided cadets with ample challenges and a very fulfilling experience.[14] In 1995 the Department of National Defence was forced to close Royal Roads Military College and Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean due to budget considerations, but Royal Military College of Canada continues to operate.[15] Royal Roads reopened as a civilian university in the fall of 1995, and is maintained by the Government of British Columbia. In 2007, the Department of National Defence reopened Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean as a preparatory and first year college.

Georgia

National Defense Academy (NDA) of Georgia is a descendant of the first Georgian "Junker School" which was established in 1919 right after the declaration of independence. Establishment of the military school was very important for the identity of a new democratic nation-state. The school was abolished after Soviet occupation of Georgia in 1921.

"Davit Aghmashenebeli National Defense Academy of Georgia" was founded on May 28, 1993. The length of studies at the Academy had been defined for 4 years. In 2005, due to the need of the growth of the personnel strength of the Georgian Armed Forces (GAF), the system of the Academy has been transformed to retain only the 18-month-long officer training courses. A bachelor's degree has been defined as a prerequisite for the admission of the cadets.

IN 2010, the NDA has undergone a new wave of the reforms to include entire officer education system. As a result, in 2011, Cadet Bachelor School, Junior Officer Basic School, Aviation and Air Defense Officer Basic School, Medical Officer School, Captain Career School, Command and General Staff School, School of Advance Defense Studies and Language Training School were included within the NDA.[17]

Upon entry into NDA, cadets sign a contract with the MoD for 10 years of military service, of which 4 years are dedicated to studies and 6 years – to consequent military service. Cadets receive the rank of Lieutenant upon graduation.

NDA is established by the MoD with the status of the Legal Entity of Public Law. At the same time, NDA maintains very strong link with The Ministry of Education and Science according to the process of Bologna.

Germany

Germany has a unique system for civil and military education. The only true military academy is the _Führungsakademie der Bundeswehr_ where mainly future staff officers and general staff officers are further trained.

The standard education in military leadership is the task of the _Offizierschulen_ (officers' schools) run by the three branches. The contents differ from branch to branch. In the army all officers are at least trained to lead a platoon. There they also have to pass an officer exam to become commissioned later on.

Moreover, there exist so called _Waffenschulen_ (school of weapons) like infantry school or artillery school. There the officers learn to deal with the typical tasks of their respective corps.

A specialty of the German concept of officer formation is the academic education. Germany runs two _Universities of the German Federal Armed Forces_ where almost every future officer has to pass non-military studies and achieve a bachelor's or master's degree. During their studies (after at least three years of service) the candidates become commissioned _Leutnant_ (second lieutenant).

The three officer's schools are:

-   The German Navy supervises:
    -   Naval Academy at Mürwik, located in Flensburg-Mürwik
-   The German Army supervises:
    -   _Offizierschule des Heeres_, located in Dresden

The institution is the military academy of the Indonesian Army.]] Indonesian_air_force_cadets.png in formation before parading for the Air force anniversary ceremony. The Academy is operated by the Indonesian Air Force.]] The Indonesian Military Academy [19] was founded in Yogyakarta, October 13, 1945 by the order of General Staff Chief of Indonesia Army Lieutenant General Urip Sumohardjo as the MILITAIRE ACADEMIE (MA) Yogyakarta.

Currently, the _Tentara Nasional Indonesia_ or the "TNI" (Indonesian National Armed Forces), under the supervision of the Commanding General of the Indonesian National Armed Forces Academy System (a three-star officer in billet) in the HQ of the Indonesian National Armed Forces, has divided the academies into the three respective services:

-   _Indonesian Military Academy_ – "AKMIL" (_Akademi Militer_ abbreviated Akmil), located in Magelang, Central Java, is under the supervision of the Indonesian Army Chief of Staff, operated since 1946.
-   _Indonesian Naval Academy_ – "A.A.L." (_Akademi Angkatan Laut_ abbreviated AAL), located in Surabaya, East Java, is under the supervision of the Indonesian Navy Chief of Staff. The Indonesian Naval Academy also educates and forms officers to serve in the Indonesian Marine Corps. In existence since 1951.
-   _Indonesian Air Force Academy_ – "A.A.U." (_Akademi Angkatan Udara_ abbreviated AAU), located in Yogyakarta, is under the supervision of the Indonesian Air Force Chief of Staff. The academy has three majorings which are: electronics, engineering, and administration. Following graduation, students who are selected as Pilot and Navigator conduct further training in the Pilot and Navigator Flight School prior bearing the Pilot/Navigator designation. Active since 1945, but also inherits the traditions of former Dutch military aviation schools.

Each service academy is headed by a two-star general, and his/her deputy is a one-star officer. All the students (cadets/midshipman) are recruited from senior high school graduates from all over Indonesia. Shortly after graduation, they are commissioned as _Letnan Dua_ (Second Lieutenant) in their respective services and get the _Diploma IV_ (Associate degree, 4th Grade) comparable to civil academies or universities. The length term is now 4 years and is divided into 5 grades of cadet's rank, starting from the lowest:

-   _Prajurit Taruna/Kadet/Karbol_ (Cadet Private), 1st year (4 months)
-   _Kopral Taruna/Kadet/Karbol_ (Cadet Corporal), 1st year (8 months)
-   _Sersan Taruna/Kadet/Karbol_ (Cadet Sergeant), 2nd year
-   _Sersan Mayor Dua Taruna/Kadet/Karbol_ (Cadet Second Sergeant Major), 3rd year
-   _Sersan Mayor Satu Taruna/Kadet/Karbol_ (Cadet First Sergeant Major), 4th year

_Taruna_ refers to cadets in the Military Academy, _Kadet_ refers to cadets in the Naval Academy, and _Karbol_ refers to cadets in the Air Force Academy, respectively.

Until 1999, before the Indonesian National Police officially separated from the armed forces, the Indonesian Police Academy ("AKPOL") also stood under the National Armed Forces Academy but now has separated from the Military and is under the auspices of the President of Indonesia controlled by the National Police Headquarters (_Mabes Polri_), where in the other hand the Armed Forces (Army, Naval, and Air Force) Academies of Indonesia is under the auspices of the Ministry of Defense controlled by the Armed Forces General Headquarters (_Mabes TNI_). Presently, the Police Academy is located in Semarang (Central Java), and is supervised under the supervision of the Chief of Indonesian National Police (_Kapolri_).

All 3 academies and the Police Academy have a joint 4th class cadet training program since 2008, after completing it the cadets go to their respective academies to continue with the 3 remaining years of study before commissioning.

As of January 2018, Rear Admiral Siwi Sukma Adji, S.E.,M.M is the Commanding General, INAF Academies System, with Major General Dody Usodo Hargo, S.Ip.,M.M as the assistant commander. The Academies System was founded on 16 December 1965.

Philippines

Pma_cadets.JPG at a homecoming.]] National_Defense_College_of_the_Philippines_in_Camp_Aguinaldo,_Quezon_City.png is a graduate-level military college established in 1963.]] The Philippines patterned all its military academies after the United States Military Academy (WEST POINT) and the United States Merchant Marine Academy.

These colleges are operated by the Philippine Government which serves 4 years of different baccalaureate degrees:

-   Philippine Military Academy, City of Baguio – It is a primary training school for regular commissioning as officers of the Philippine Army, Philippine Navy, Philippine Marine Corps and the Philippine Air Force, and it is under the control of the Department of National Defense. It was formerly named as the Philippine Constabulary School but was renamed before the 30's. during the American era, U.S. Army Cavalry Officers established the school for the professionalization of the defunct Philippine Constabulary enlisted personnel. In 1992, PMA stopped producing constabulary cadets after the creation of the Republic Act 6975 which as a result the Philippine Constabulary and the Integrated National Police were officially merged and renamed as The Philippine National Police. Beginning in 1993 this has become a co-educational military academy.
-   Philippine Merchant Marine Academy, Zambales – It is a school for midshipmen who shall serve in different private shipping companies, foreign or local. Its midshipmen may serve in the Philippine Coast Guard and the Philippine Navy as an ensign after graduation depending upon their choice. All PMMA midshipmen are also automatically appointed by the president of the Philippines as ensigns or 2nd lieutenants in the Philippine Navy Reserve. This is the oldest of the Philippine service academies having been established in 1820 during the long period of Spanish rule in the country, and was first situated in Manila for so many years.
-   Philippine National Police Academy, Cavite – during the 1980s, it served as a school for selected enlisted personnel and civilians to join as a Police/Fire Lieutenants in the defunct Integrated National Police. After the merging of the Philippine Constabulary and INP in January 1, 1991 it became the primary officers school for the new Philippine National Police, the Bureau of Fire Protection and the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, all under the Department of the Interior and Local Government. The Philippine National Police Academy graduates are automatically appointed as Inspectors/Lieutenants in the Philippine National Police, Bureau of Fire Protection, and the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology according to their choice of public safety curriculum during their cadetship. This is under the supervision of the DILG and the Philippine Public Safety College.

Aside from the PMA and the PMMA, all three branches of the AFP have their own Officer Candidate Course Programs for both men and women, patterned after their US counterparts.

The nation's higher military colleges are:

-   Armed Forces of the Philippines Command and General Staff College, Quezon City – educates officers of the AFP not exceeding the ranks of Colonel or Navy Captain
-   National Defense College of the Philippines, Quezon City – is a school for senior AFP officers for military/naval planning and to ready them in holding the ranks of Brigadier General/Commodore. Notable civilians may enroll and be given the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel/Commander in the AFP Reserve upon graduation.

Pre-University level institution

WelbeckParade.JPG. The College is one of two pre-university level institutions in the country.]]

-   Welbeck Defence Sixth Form College – Sixth form college for 16- to 18-year-olds providing A-Level education in preparation for entry into the British Armed Forces or Ministry of Defence Civil Service as Technical Officers, following undergraduate education sponsored under the Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme (DTUS).
-   Duke of York's Royal Military School – Military based secondary school in Dover, Kent; students are influenced to join the forces after education, but have no commitment to do so.

There are also numerous Cadet forces that operate for all branches of the armed forces for children aged 10–20. These are not designed to recruit people into the armed forces but rather are simply Ministry of Defence sponsored youth organisations.

Undergraduate Service

Although an undergraduate degree is not a pre-requisite for Officer training, the majority of potential Officers will have attended University before joining the Armed Forces. At some universities there may be the option for people to join either a University Royal Naval Unit, a University Officer Training Corps (UOTC) or a University Air Squadron; which are designed to introduce students to life in the Forces and show them the careers that are available. People sponsored under the Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme will join one of the four Support Units attached to universities participating in DTUS. There is a requirement for bursars of DTUS to join the military for 3 years after completion of their degree, there no requirement for students of any other organisation to join the military after they finish their degree programs; and the great majority have no further contact with the armed forces. Although service with these organisations may give some initial benefit to cadets attending the military colleges/academies, the next stage of the officer training programs assumes no prior military experience/knowledge, and those that did not partake in military activities at university are not disadvantaged.

Officer training

United States

Introduction

In the United States, the term "military academy" does not necessarily mean a government-owned institution run by the armed forces to train its own officers. It may also mean a middle school, high school, or college, whether public or private, which instructs its students in military-style education, discipline and tradition. Students at such civilian institutions can earn a commission in the U.S. military through the successful completion of a Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps program along with their college or university's academic coursework.

-   The term MILITARY SCHOOL primarily refers to pre-collegiate secondary-school-level military institutions, which were more common before the 1970s and 1980s.
-   The term MILITARY ACADEMY commonly refers to a pre-collegiate, collegiate, and post-collegiate institution, especially the U.S. military-run academies.
-   The term US MILITARY STAFF COLLEGES refers to separate graduate schools catering to officers on active duty .

Most state-level military academies maintain both a civilian student body and a traditional corps of cadets. The only exception is the Virginia Military Institute, which remains all-military.[39]

Federal Service Academies

USMA is one of five federal service academies.]] The colleges operated by the U.S. Federal Government are referred to as FEDERAL SERVICE ACADEMIES and are:

-   United States Military Academy, West Point, New York
-   United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland
-   United States Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado
-   United States Coast Guard Academy, New London, Connecticut
-   United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York

Post-graduate School

-   Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland

Senior and junior military colleges

Fishreviewfall06.jpg has transformed into a state university, it still maintains a corps of cadets along with a civilian student body.]] MMI_BC_and_Staff.jpg after the Alumni Weekend parade. The Institute is one of four junior military colleges in the United States.]] There is one all-military state-sponsored military academy:

-   The Virginia Military Institute (VMI), Lexington, Virginia

In addition, these five institutions that were military colleges at the time of their founding now maintain both a corps of cadets and a civilian student body. Many of these institutions also offer on-line degree programs:

-   University of North Georgia, Dahlonega, Georgia — Formed by a 2013 merger with Gainesville State College, its main predecessor institution, last known as North Georgia College & State University, was chartered as a military college. However, when NGCSU was founded in 1873 as North Georgia Agricultural College, it had both a corps and a civilian student body, and was also the state's first coeducational college.
-   Norwich University Corps of Cadets. Norwich University, Northfield, Vermont is a private university located in Northfield, Vermont. It is the oldest private military college in the United States. The university was founded in 1819 at Norwich, Vermont, as the American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy. It is the oldest of six senior military colleges, and is recognized by the United States Department of Defense as the "Birthplace of ROTC"
-   Texas A&M Corps of Cadets, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas
-   The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina
-   Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia

Along with VMI, these institutions are known as the Senior Military Colleges of the US.

Today four institutions are considered Military Junior Colleges (MJC). These four military schools participate in the Army's two-year Early Commissioning Program, an Army ROTC program where qualified students can earn a commission as a Second Lieutenant after only two years of college. The four Military Junior Colleges are as follows:

-   Georgia Military College, Milledgeville, Georgia
-   Marion Military Institute, Marion, Alabama
-   New Mexico Military Institute, Roswell, New Mexico
-   Valley Forge Military Academy and College, Wayne, Pennsylvania

Merchant Marine Academies that have military academy style operations

TS_State_of_Michigan_on_Grand_Traverse_Bay.jpg learning how to row a boat. The institution is one of six military-styled maritime academies in the United States.]] There are six (6) state-operated Merchant Marine academies:

-   Massachusetts Maritime Academy
-   Maine Maritime Academy
-   State University of New York Maritime College (part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system)
-   Texas A&M Maritime Academy (part of the Texas A&M University System)
-   Great Lakes Maritime Academy (a division of Northwestern Michigan College)
-   California State University Maritime Academy (part of the California State University system)

These merchant marine academies operate on a military college system. Part of the training that the cadets receive is naval and military in nature. Cadets may apply for Naval Reserve commissions upon obtaining their Merchant Marine Officer's licenses. Most if not all also offer some form of military commissioning program into the active duty US Navy, US Marine Corps, or US Coast Guard.
