Plot

James Bellamy and Angus Hudson are going for a weekend visit to Somerby, the country house of James' school-friend Lord "Bunny" Newbury. Angus Hudson is depicted as an exemplary butler at Somerby Park. Max Weinberg is a wealthy Jewish gentleman and businessman and he is appreciating Hudson's capabilities and his manner. During his visit to Somerby Hudson gets a job offer. He is offered the job of the butler Makepiece in Somerby. They want him to be the new butler at Somerby Park instead of the old butler Makepiece. But his loyalty towards the Bellamy Family is without question.[1][2]
