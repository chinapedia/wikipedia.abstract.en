Reception

The series was a commercial success with over 25% ratings and topped popularity charts.[12][13] It received praise for its plot-focused narrative, impressive acting performance of lead actors Ji Sung and Um Ki-joon and its ability to resonate with the public. _Korea Times_ said the drama is like a "warning sign to the evil and powerful figures of the real world"; and _Yonhap News Agency_ praise Ji's character as "putting a relatable human face on a tale that is often disturbingly grim and somber". However, it also had criticisms about its unrealistic plot and its tendency to repeat the same pattern of twists and turns to keep viewers hooked.[14][15][16]
