GREGOR AICHINGER (c. 1565 â€“ 21 January 1628) was a German composer.


Life

He was organist to the Fugger family of Augsburg in 1584.[1] In 1599 he went for a two-year visit to Rome for musical, rather than religious reasons, although he had taken holy orders before his appointment under the Fuggers. Proske, in the preface to vol. 2 of his _Musica Divina_, calls him a priest of Regensburg, and is inclined to give him the palm for the devout and ingenuous mastery of his style. Certainly this impression is fully borne out by the beautiful and somewhat quaint works included in that great anthology.
