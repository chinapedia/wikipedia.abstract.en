_LOIS THE WITCH AND OTHER TALES_ is an 1861 collection of five stories by Elizabeth Gaskell. The book was published by Bernhard Tauchnitz in Leipzig.

The 1861 book's five stories are _Lois the Witch_ (124 pages), _The Grey Woman_ (78 pages), _The Doom of the Griffiths_ (52 pages), _The Half-Brothers_ (20 pages), and _The Crooked Branch_ (63 pages).[1] _Lois the Witch_ is a long short story or novella of historical fiction, which first appeared in 3 parts in October 1859 in the weekly _All the Year Round_ edited by Charles Dickens.[2] The story's protagonist Lois Barclay is raised in a parsonage in Barford, Warwickshire but as she becomes a young woman both her parents die. In 1691 she crosses the Atlantic to live with her uncle and his family in Salem, Massachusetts and then becomes involved in the Salem witch trials.[3] The book's second-longest story _The Grey Woman_ is a Gothic tale of a young woman who, with her lady's maid, escapes from the castle of her rich, but abusive, husband Monsieur de la Tourelle. The stories _The Doom of the Griffiths_ and _The Half-Brothers_ were published in the 1859 collection _Round the Sofa_ after previous publication in periodicals. _The Crooked Branch_ was first published as _The Ghost in the Garden Room_ in the 1859 extra Christmas issue of _All the Year Round_ as part of the "portmanteau" story _The Haunted House_.[4]

The original manuscripts of _The Grey Woman_ and _The Crooked Branch_ are in the Elizabeth Gaskell Manuscript Collection of the John Rylands Library of the University of Manchester.[5]
