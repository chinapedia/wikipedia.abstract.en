_OSWALD_, also known as _OSWALD OF THE ICE FLOES_,[1] is a 1988 Danish computer game for Amiga and Commodore 64. The game was designed by Ivan Sølvason for use as a game controlled over a push-button telephone, for Danish TV2's Friday night prime time program Eleva2ren. The game sold well in Denmark due to the exposure in Eleva2ren.[2]

Sølvason later designed _Hugo the TV Troll_, also for Eleva2ren and using the same push-button telephone concept. Hugo the TV Troll went on to be an international success.


Super OsWALD

A new version of the game named _SUPER OSWALD_, featuring two-player mode, was created for Eleva2ren in 1989.[3]
