CLIFFORD (1890â€“1917)[1] was a Thoroughbred racehorse who was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2014.[2]


Background

Clifford was a dark bay or brown horse who to many was perceived as ugly and weak. The _New York Times_ said "As a yearling he was one of the poorest-looking animals of the lot in which he was offered for sale, and nothing great was expected of him," but as he turned into a legend the times said "one of the most brilliant performers the American turf has ever known." He was foaled in Nashville, Tennessee at W. H. Jackson's Belle Meade Stud. He was purchased for $900 at Bell Meade's April 27, 1891 auction by W. J. Cherry who sold him shortly thereafter to Clifford Porter who named the horse after himself. Clifford was sired by the stallion Bramble and was out of the good racemare Duchess who was sired by Kingfisher.


Career

Clifford had an unexceptional maiden season, winning a maiden special weight but not returning to the races that year.

The biggest and best year for Clifford was the 3-year-old-season. In this season he won a total of 18 races from 24 starts.[3] With 11 consecutive races in 5 weeks and carrying over 25 more pounds than his rivals. He also won multiple big races such as the Phoenix Handicap and the Latonia Spring Prize and was named American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse.

This year Clifford was able to repeat the Second Special Stakes. He also won the Omnium Handicap, Club Members and Oriental Handicaps.

The big win for his final season was the Long Island Handicap after which he then retired after coming up sore after his 3rd place Finnish in the Omnium Handicap.
