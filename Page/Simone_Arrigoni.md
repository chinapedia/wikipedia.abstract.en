SIMONE ARRIGONI (born in Rome, Italy, on 4 September 1973) is an Italian free-diver. He holds multiple free-diving world records. He is an ActionAid Ambassador and Honorary Member of the Centro Studi Cetacei, a non-profit Italian association that is concerned with the study and rescue of marine mammals and reptiles since 1986.[1]


Free-diving

Since 2008, Arrigoni has collaborated with biologists and students at _Zoomarine Italia_ to carry on research projects on the study of free-diving and the comparative physiology of humans and dolphins.[2]

New disciplines

He opened two new specialties of dynamic apnea:

-   _Horizontal Free Immersion_, devised by Arrigoni in 2009 to allow disabled persons to play this aquatic sport, in which the freediver covers a horizontal distance pulling on a rope;
-   _Dolphin's Breath_, which consists of freediving with monofin along a horizontal distance of predetermined length, periodically resurfacing to take a single breath of 1 second, and aiming at taking as few breaths as possible during the declared distance. The Dolphin's Breath was inaugurated by Arrigoni to disseminate two important slogans: "Mind the dolphins", to raise public awareness to protect marine mammals and their environment, and "Never alone", to remind people to never practice freediving alone for safety reasons, following the example given by dolphins which live and swim in a group, always helping each other in case of difficulty.[3]

Photography

Since 2010 he has been developing his interest in photography – in which he looks for unusual perspectives, details, lights and symmetries. His photos and reportage have been published in print and online magazines, and received awards in international photo contests, such as the International Photography Awards.[5]


Publications

Arrigoni has self-published an autobiography: _Seven Breaths. A Tale of Music, Freediving, World Records and Dolphins_, Charleston, CreateSpace, 2017 (translated from the Italian _Sette respiri. In apnea tra musica, record e delfini_, Charleston, CreateSpace, 2016).[6]
