LIMP BIZKIT is an American rap rock band from Jacksonville, Florida. Their lineup consists of Fred Durst (lead vocals), Sam Rivers (bass, backing vocals), John Otto (drums, percussion), DJ Lethal (turntables), and Wes Borland (guitars, backing vocals). Their music is marked by Durst's angry vocal delivery and Borland's sonic experimentation. Borland's elaborate visual appearance, which includes face and body paint, masks and uniforms, also plays a large role in the band's live shows. The band has been nominated for three Grammy Awards, have sold 40 million records worldwide and won several other awards.[1]

Formed in 1994,[2] Limp Bizkit became popular playing in the Jacksonville underground music scene in the late 1990s, and signed with Flip Records, a subsidiary of Interscope, which released their debut album, _Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$_ (1997). The band achieved mainstream success with their second and third studio albums, _Significant Other_ (1999) and _Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water_ (2000), although this success was marred by a series of controversies surrounding their performances at Woodstock '99 and the 2001 Big Day Out festival.

Borland left the group in 2001, but Durst, Rivers, Otto and Lethal continued to record and tour with guitarist Mike Smith. Following the release of their album, _Results May Vary_ (2003), Borland rejoined the band and recorded _The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)_ (2005) with Durst, Rivers, Lethal and drummer Sammy Siegler before entering a hiatus. In 2009, the band reunited with Borland playing guitar and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album _Gold Cobra_ (2011), after which they left Interscope and later signed with Cash Money Records, but DJ Lethal quit the band soon after. As of 2018, the band is currently recording their sixth studio album, _Stampede of the Disco Elephants_.


History

Formation and early years (1994–96)

Drummer_John_Otto_of_Limp_Bizkit_in_2006.jpg studied jazz drumming and played in local avant garde bands before joining Limp Bizkit.]] Fred Durst grew up in Jacksonville, where he took an interest in breakdancing, hip hop, punk rock and heavy metal. He began to rap, skate, beatbox and deejay. While mowing lawns and working as a tattoo artist, he developed an idea for a band that combined elements of rock and hip hop.[3] Durst played with three other bands, Split 26, Malachi Sage, which were unsuccessful, and 10 Foot Shindig, which Durst left to form a new band.[4] Durst told Sam Rivers, the bassist for Malachi Sage, "You need to quit this band and start a band with me that's like this: rappin' and rockin'."[5] Rivers suggested that his cousin, John Otto, who was studying jazz drumming at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts and playing in local avant garde bands, become their drummer.[6] Durst, Rivers and Otto jammed and wrote three songs together, and Wes Borland later joined as a guitarist.[7]

Durst named the band Limp Bizkit because he wanted a name that would repel listeners. According to Durst, "The name is there to turn people's heads away. A lot of people pick up the disc and go, 'Limp Bizkit. Oh, they must suck.' Those are the people that we don't even want listening to our music."[8] Other names that were considered by Durst included Gimp Disco, Split Dickslit, Bitch Piglet, and Blood Fart.[9] Every record label that showed an interest in the band pressured its members to change its name.[10] Limp Bizkit developed a cult following in the underground music scene, particularly at the Milk Bar, an underground punk club in Jacksonville. The band's local popularity was such that Sugar Ray, who had a major label contract, opened for a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit at Velocity with hip hop group Funkdoobiest.[11] Milkbar owner, Danny Wimmer, stated that Limp Bizkit "had the biggest draw for a local band. They went from playing [for] ten people to eight hundred within months. Fred ... was always marketing the band. He would go to record stores and get people involved, he was in touch with high schools."[12] However, the band knew that to achieve national success, they would have to distinguish themselves in their live performances.[13] Attracting crowds by word of mouth, the band gave energetic live performances, covering George Michael's "Faith" and Paula Abdul's "Straight Up", and featuring Borland in bizarre costumes.[14] Borland's theatrical rock style was the primary attraction for many concert attendees.[15]

Durst unsuccessfully tried to attract attention from A&R representatives at various labels by pretending to be the band's manager.[16] Later, when Korn performed in town as the opening act for Sick of It All, Durst invited Korn to drink beer and tattoo them. Although Durst's tattoos were unimpressive, he was able to persuade Reginald "Fieldy" Arvizu to listen to a demo, consisting of the songs "Pollution", "Counterfeit" and "Stuck". Korn added a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit to two tours, which exposed the band to a new audience.[17][18] The band attempted to expand their sound by auditioning an additional guitarist, but Borland soon determined that another guitarist was not the answer, and DJ Lethal, formerly of the hip hop group House of Pain, joined the band as a turntablist after a successful practice performance. Joining the band gave Lethal an opportunity to experiment with his turntable technique in ways that hip hop had not allowed him to do, helping shape the band's style. Due to creative differences, Borland left the band at this point.[19]

_Three Dollar Bill, Yall_ (1997–98)

After their performance opening for Korn at the Dragonfly in Hollywood was well received, Limp Bizkit signed with Mojo, a subsidiary of MCA Records. While heading to California to record their first album, the band wrecked their van. As a result of the near death experience, Durst made amends with Borland, who rejoined the band.[20] After a dispute with Mojo, Limp Bizkit signed with Flip, a subsidiary of Interscope Records. Arvizu persuaded Ross Robinson to listen to the demo. Robinson neglected to listen to it until it was appraised by his girlfriend. Impressed by the band's motivation and sound, Robinson produced Limp Bizkit's debut, which was recorded at Indigo Ranch. Durst's problems with his girlfriend inspired him to write the song "Sour".[21] The mood and tone set by Robinson in the studio allowed the band to improvise; a recording of the band improvising appeared as the last track on the album, "Everything".[22]

Despite the success of live performances of the band's cover of the song "Faith", Robinson was opposed to recording it, and tried to persuade the band not to play it on the album. However, the final recording, which incorporated heavier guitar playing and drumming, as well as DJ scratching, impressed him.[23] Robinson also bonded with Borland, who he perceived as not taking the band seriously.[24] The progressive metal band Tool provided a strong influence in shaping the album's sound, particularly in the song "Nobody Loves Me", which contains a breakdown in which Durst imitated the singing style of Maynard James Keenan.[25]

Continuing the band's policy of using names that would repulse potential listeners, the band named the album by using part of the phrase "queer as a three dollar bill" and adding the word "Y'all" for Florida flavor, naming the album, _Three Dollar Bill, Yall_.[26] The completed album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Limp Bizkit used to attract listeners to their music.[27] After the band completed recording, they toured with Korn and Helmet in 1997. Critics reacted unfavorably to performances of Korn and Limp Bizkit; _Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel_ music critic Jon M. Gilbertson criticized Durst's performance, stating "The one attention-grabbing moment of Limp Bizkit's rap/thrash show was when the lead singer expressed a desire for gay men to be 'stomped'. Which isn't remotely rebellious. It's just puerile."[28] That same year, they also notably served as an opening act for Faith No More, a band often credited as paving the way for Limp Bizkit and the nu metal genre.[29] The group's keyboardist Roddy Bottum later recalled "That guy Fred Durst had a really bad attitude. He was kind of a jerk. I remembered he called the audience faggots at one show when they booed him. Not a good scene."[30]

Interscope proposed to the band that the label pay $5,000 to guarantee that a Portland, Oregon radio station play the song "Counterfeit" fifty times, preceded and concluded with an announcement that the air time was paid for by Interscope.[31][32] The paid air time was criticized by the media, who saw it as "payola".[33][34] The band's manager Jeff Kwatinetz later termed the plan as a "brilliant marketing move".[35] Durst stated, "It worked, but it's not that cool of a thing."[36] Following the release of "Counterfeit" as a single, _Three Dollar Bill, Yall_ was released on July 1, 1997, and was met with minimal response. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, "They might not have many original ideas ... but they do the sound well. They have a powerful rhythm section and memorable hooks, most of which make up for the uneven songwriting."[37] However, Robert Christgau panned the album.[38] Despite the minimal response to his band's album, Durst was appointed Senior Vice President of A&R at Interscope.[39]

Limp Bizkit joined the Warped Tour, performing alongside the bands Pennywise, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Sick of It All, Lagwagon and Blink-182.[40] Preceding their first tour with DJ Lethal, Otto became familiar with Lethal's contributions to collaborate with him better on stage.[41] In addition to touring with Primus and Deftones, Limp Bizkit headlined the Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour, which was intended to diversify the band's fanbase, which was largely male, by offering free tickets to female attendees. This plan successfully increased the band's female fanbase.[42]

In 1998, Limp Bizkit toured with Soulfly and Cold on Soulfly's first European tour.[43] Touring consistently increased Limp Bizkit's success, and the second single from _Three Dollar Bill, Yall_, a cover of George Michael's "Faith", became a successful radio hit, leading to a slot on Ozzfest, a tour organized by Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne.[44] In July, Snot singer Lynn Strait was arrested after he emerged nude from Limp Bizkit's prop toilet, and was charged with indecent exposure.[45][46] Because Limp Bizkit's fans would often break through the barricades, the band was almost kicked off the tour after two days.[47] In August, John Otto spent the night in jail in Auburn Hills, Michigan, on a misdemeanor charge of carrying a concealed weapon, after allegedly firing a BB gun and being arrested for carrying a switchblade.[48]

After completing Ozzfest, Limp Bizkit took a break from performing, and later performed on Korn's Family Values Tour. Durst also directed a music video for the band's single "Faith" in promotion for its appearance in the film _Very Bad Things_, but was unsatisfied with it, and directed a second video which paid tribute to tourmates like Primus, Deftones and Korn, who appeared in the video.[49] Borland stated in an interview that George Michael, the writer of the song, hated the cover and "hates us for doing it".[50]

_Significant Other_ (1999–2000)

DJ_Lethal_2011.jpg'' (1999), DJ Lethal expanded his role as sound designer for the band.]]

Following the radio success of "Faith", the band was determined to record the follow-up to their first album in order to show that they weren't a Korn soundalike or a cover band; the band began writing an album which dealt with issues deriving from their newfound fame.[51] Terry Date, who had produced albums for Pantera, White Zombie and Deftones, was chosen to produce the album.[52] The band allowed Durst and Lethal to explore their hip hop origins by recording a song with Method Man. The song was originally titled "Shut the Fuck Up", but was retitled "N 2 Gether Now" for marketing purposes.[53] Durst also recorded with Eminem, but the collaboration, "Turn Me Loose", was left off the album.[54] The album also featured guest appearances by Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland, Korn's Jonathan Davis and Staind singer Aaron Lewis, and interludes by Les Claypool and Matt Pinfield.[55]

_Significant Other_ saw Limp Bizkit reaching a new level of commercial success; the band was featured on the covers of popular music magazines, including _Spin_, and now found themselves repeatedly mobbed for autographs; the band was allowed to interact directly with their fans on a website established by Dike 99.[56] Durst also moved from Jacksonville to Los Angeles. _Significant Other_ was seen as an improvement over their debut, and was generally well received by critics with mixed to positive reviews. However, the band also continued to be criticized by the media; an article profiling the band in _Spin_ and discussing _Significant Other_ claimed that "Limp Bizkit had yet to write a good song", and musicians Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor criticized the band.[57]

The band promoted the album by playing unannounced concerts in Detroit and Chicago, as radio stations received a strong number of requests for the album's first single, "Nookie".[58] _Significant Other_ climbed to No. 1 on the _Billboard_ 200, selling 643,874 copies in its first week of release.[59] In its second week of release, the album sold an additional 335,000 copies.[60] On the opening night of the band's Limptropolis tour with Kid Rock, Sam Rivers smashed his bass in frustration over the venue's poor sound, cutting his hand. After his hand was stitched up at a hospital, Rivers returned to finish the set.[61] On July 12, Durst allegedly kicked a security guard in the head during a performance in St. Paul, Minnesota, and was later arrested on assault charges.[62] Further criticisms of the band appeared in _Rolling Stone_ and _The New York Times_.[63] _New York Times_ writer Ann Powers wrote, "DJ Lethal used his turntables as a metal guitar, riffing expansively and going for effects instead of rhythm. John Otto on drums and Sam Rivers on bass never even tried to get funky, instead steering hip-hop's break-beat-based structure into a backbone for power chords. This makes for a hybrid that would be more interesting if the band did not constantly mire itself in boring tempos, and if Mr. Durst had any talent as a singer".[64]

In the summer of 1999, Limp Bizkit played at the highly anticipated Woodstock '99 show in front of approximately 200,000 people. Violent action sprang up during and after their performance, including fans tearing plywood from the walls during a performance of the song "Break Stuff". Several sexual assaults were reported in the aftermath of the concert.[65][66][67] Durst stated during the concert, "People are getting hurt. Don't let anybody get hurt. But I don't think you should mellow out. That's what Alanis Morissette had you motherfuckers do. If someone falls, pick 'em up. We already let the negative energy out. Now we wanna let out the positive energy".[68] Durst later stated in an interview, "I didn't see anybody getting hurt. You don't see that. When you're looking out on a sea of people and the stage is twenty feet in the air and you're performing, and you're feeling your music, how do they expect us to see something bad going on?"[69] Les Claypool told _The San Francisco Examiner_, "Woodstock was just Durst being Durst. His attitude is 'no press is bad press', so he brings it on himself. He wallows in it. Still, he's a great guy."[70]

Durst saw the band as being scapegoated for the event's controversy, and reflected on the criticisms surrounding the band in his music video for the single "Re-Arranged", which depicted the band members receiving death sentences for their participation in the concerts. The video ended with angry witnesses watching as the band drowned in milk while performing the song.[71] Durst later stated that the promoters of Woodstock '99 were at fault for booking his band, due to their reputation for raucous performances.[72] Despite this controversy, _Significant Other_ remained at No. 1 on the _Billboard_ charts, and the band headlined the year's Family Values Tour.[73] Durst directed a music video for "N 2 Gether Now" which featured Method Man and Pauly Shore, and was inspired by Inspector Clouseau's fights with his butler, Cato Fong, in the _Pink Panther_ film series.[74]

_Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water_ (2000–01)

In 2000, Durst announced that the band's third studio album would be titled _Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water_. The press thought he was joking about this title.[75] The album title is intended to sound like a fictional band; the phrase "Chocolate Starfish" refers to the human anus, and Durst himself, who has frequently been called an "asshole".[76] Borland contributed the other half of the album's title when the band was standing around at a truck stop, looking at bottles of flavored water, and Borland joked that the truck stop didn't have hot dog or meat-flavored water.[77]

In June 2000, Limp Bizkit performed at the WXRK Dysfunctional Family Picnic, but showed up an hour late for their set.[78] An Interscope spokesman stated that there was confusion over the band's set time.[79] During the band's performance, Durst criticized Creed singer Scott Stapp, calling him "an egomaniac".[80] Creed's representatives later presented Durst with an autographed anger management manual.[81] In the summer, Limp Bizkit's tour was sponsored by the controversial file sharing service Napster, doing free shows with a metal cage as the only thing separating them from the audience.[82] Durst was an outspoken advocate of file sharing.[83] They also did a "Guerrilla Tour" which involved the band setting up illegally and impromptu public gigs on rooftops and alleyways, some being shut down by the police.

During the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Durst performed "Livin' It Up", a song from the upcoming album, as a duet with Christina Aguilera. In response to the performance, Filter frontman Richard Patrick was quoted as saying "Fred getting onstage with Christina Aguilera embarrassed us all."[84] In response to the negative reactions to the performance, Durst remarked, "I already told you guys before, I did it all for the nookie, man."[85] In response to Durst's remark, Aguilera commented, "He got no nookie."[86]

Released on October 17, _Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water_ set a record for highest first-week sales for a rock album with over one million copies sold in the US in its first week of release. 400,000 of those sales happened during the first day, making it the fastest-selling rock album ever, breaking the record held for 7 years by Pearl Jam's _Vs._[87] _Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water_ was certified Gold, Platinum and six times Multi-Platinum.[88] The album received mixed reviews,[89] with Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing, "Durst's self-pitying and the monotonous music give away that the band bashed Chocolate Starfish out very quickly – it's the sound of a band determined to deliver a sequel in a finite amount of time."[90] _Entertainment Weekly_ writer David Browne named it as the worst album title of 2000.[91]

During a 2001 tour of Australia at the Big Day Out festival in Sydney, fans rushed the stage in the mosh pit, and teenager Jessica Michalik died of asphyxiation. In court, Durst, represented by long-time attorney, Ed McPherson, testified he had warned the concert's organizers Aaron Jackson, Will Pearce and Amar Tailor, and also the promoter Vivian Lees, of the potential dangers of such minimal security.[92] After viewing videotapes and hearing witness testimony, however, the coroner said it was evident that the density of the crowd was dangerous at the time Limp Bizkit took the stage, stating that Fred Durst should have acted more responsibly when the problem became apparent.[93] Durst stated that he was "emotionally scarred" because of the teenager's death.[94]

Later in 2001, numerous hip-hop artists including P. Diddy, Timbaland, Bubba Sparxxx and Everlast remixed famous songs from the band into hip-hop versions adding their own styles and modifications. The album was called _New Old Songs_.

Departure of Borland and _Results May Vary_ (2001–03)

In October 2001, Durst released a statement on their website stating that "Limp Bizkit and Wes Borland have amicably decided to part ways. Both Limp Bizkit and Borland will continue to pursue their respective musical careers. Both wish each other the best of luck in all future endeavors."[95] Durst also stated that the band would "comb the world for the illest guitar player known to man" to replace Borland.[96]

After holding a nationwide audition for a new guitarist, called "Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is",[97] the band recorded with Snot guitarist Mike Smith, but later scrapped their recording sessions with Smith.[98] Durst told a fan site that he had a falling out with Smith, saying "We are the type of people that stay true to our family and our instincts and at any moment will act on intuition as a whole. Mike wasn't the guy. We had fun playing with him but always knew, in the back of our minds, that he wasn't where we needed him to be mentally."[99]

After recording another album without Smith, the band scrapped the new sessions and assembled a new album combining songs from different sessions.[100] During the album's production, the working title changed from _Bipolar_[101] to _Panty Sniffer_,[102] and was completed under the title _Results May Vary_. Under Durst's sole leadership, the album encompassed a variety of styles,[103] and featured a cover of The Who's "Behind Blue Eyes", which differed from the original's arrangement in its inclusion of a Speak & Spell during the song's bridge.[104]

In the summer of 2003, Limp Bizkit participated on the Summer Sanitarium Tour, headlined by Metallica.[105] At the tour's stop in Chicago, attendees of the concert threw items and heckled Durst from the moment he walked on stage. With the crowd chanting "Fuck Fred Durst" and continuing their assault on him, Durst threw the mic down after six songs and walked off stage, but not before heckling the crowd back. He repeatedly said, "Limp Bizkit are the best band in the world!" until a roadie took his microphone away.[106] An article in the _Sun-Times_ stated that the hostility was started by radio personality Mancow.[107]

_Results May Vary_ was released on September 23, 2003, and received largely unfavorable reviews.[108] Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine panned the album, writing, "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [and] all attention is focused on the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?"[109] _The Guardian_ reviewer Caroline Sullivan wrote, "At least Limp Bizkit can't be accused of festering in the rap-rock ghetto ... But Durst's problems are ever-present – and does anybody still care?"[110] Despite criticisms of the album, it was a commercial success, peaking at No. 3 on the _Billboard_ 200.[111]

Borland's return, _The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)_ and hiatus (2004–08)

In August 2004, Borland rejoined Limp Bizkit, which began recording an EP, _The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)_.[112]

In May, _The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)_ was released. Sammy Siegler took over drumming duties for the band for much of the EP, which featured a more experimental sound, described by Allmusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine as "neo-prog alt-metal".[113] At Durst's insistence, the album was released as an underground album, without any advertising or promotion.[114][115] Borland disagreed with the decision, suggesting that it was "self-sabotage": "Maybe he was already unhappy with the music, and he didn't really want to put it out there."[116]

The EP received mixed reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the music, calling it "a step in the right direction – it's more ambitious, dramatic, and aggressive, built on pummeling verses and stop-start choruses." However, he felt that the band was being "held back" by Durst, whom he called "the most singularly unpleasant, absurd frontman in rock."[117] IGN writer Spence D. similarly gave it a mixed review, as he felt that the album lacked direction, but that showed potential for the band's musical growth.[118]

_The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)_ sold over 37,000 copies worldwide, peaking at No. 24 on the _Billboard_ 200.[119][120] Following the release of the band's _Greatest Hitz_ album, the band went on hiatus.[121][122] Borland stated that it was unlikely that a sequel to _The Unquestionable Truth_ would be produced and that "As of right now, none of my future plans include Limp Bizkit."[123][124]

Reunion, _Gold Cobra_ and departure from Interscope (2009–11)

Limp_Bizkit.jpg In 2009, Limp Bizkit reunited with Borland playing guitar and launched the Unicorns N' Rainbows Tour.[125] Durst announced that they had begun to record a new album, which Borland titled _Gold Cobra_.[126][127] Borland said that the title does not have any meaning, and that it was chosen because it fit the style of music the band was writing for the album.[128] The band recorded a spoken intro written by Durst and performed by Kiss member Gene Simmons for the album, but it was left off the completed album.[129][130] The band also recorded additional "non-album" tracks, including "Combat Jazz", which featured rapper Raekwon and "Middle Finger", featuring Paul Wall.[131] "Shotgun" was released as a single on May 17, 2011. The song is noted for featuring a guitar solo by Borland, something that the band is not known for.[132] "Shotgun" received favorable reviews, with Artistdirect writing, "['Shotgun'] feels like Bizkit approached the signature style on _Three Dollar Bill Y'All_ and _Significant Other_ with another decade-plus of instrumental experience and virtuosity, carving out a banger that could get asses moving in the club or fists flying in the mosh pit."[133]

_Gold Cobra_ was released on June 28 and received mixed to positive reviews.[134] AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it "a return to the full-throttled attack of _Three Dollar Bill Y'All_.[135] IGN writer Chad Grischow wrote, "Though far from their best work, Limp Bizkit's latest at least proves that their 2005 _Greatest Hitz_ album may have been premature."[136] _Metal Hammer_ writer Terry Bezer appraised the album, writing "Aside from the odd duff moment, Gold Cobra throws out the hot shit that'll make you bounce in the mosh pit over and over again."[137] The band launched the Gold Cobra Tour in support of the album. A music video for the title track was released.[138] Gold Cobra has sold nearly 80,000 copies in the United States alone and peaked at No. 16 on the _Billboard_ 200; however, the band left Interscope after the album's release.[139]

_Stampede of the Disco Elephants_ (2012–present)

In February 2012, the band returned to Australia for the first time in 11 years, to perform at the Soundwave festival.[140] Durst dedicated the shows to Jessica Michalik, who died during the Limp Bizkit performance at Big Day Out 2001.[141] On February 24, Limp Bizkit signed with Cash Money Records, and revealed plans to release a new single, "Ready to Go", a full-length album, _Stampede of the Disco Elephants_, and an EP, _The Unquestionable Truth (Part 2)_.[142][143][144] Due to mounting tensions and following a dispute between Durst and bandmates Lethal and Otto about the latter two's alleged chronic drug and alcohol use, DJ Lethal angrily left the band.[145]

Fred Durst was featured in the song "Champions" by Kevin Rudolf, used as theme for WWE's Night of Champions. The song debuted on _WWE Raw_ televised event on September 3, 2012. This was the first time Limp Bizkit has worked with WWE since 2003. On October 11, 2012, DJ Lethal posted an apology to the band on Twitter,[146] but was ultimately not allowed back into the band.[147][148][149]

It was announced on October 26, 2012 on Fred Durst's official Twitter account that a video for the first Cash Money single with Lil Wayne, "Ready to Go" was currently being filmed. Limp Bizkit also "leaked" a new song on the web called "Lightz (City of Angels)" via YouTube.[150] The band was recording their seventh studio album, _Stampede of the Disco Elephants_[151] with producer Ross Robinson,[152][153] who also produced the band's debut album, _Three Dollar Bill, Yall,_ and their 2005 album _The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)_. The album was scheduled for a July 2014 release.[154]

On March 24, 2013, the first single from the album, "Ready to Go" (featuring Lil Wayne) was released on limpbizkit.com and the accompanying music video was released on July 22.[155]

In April 2013, the band announced 34 tour dates, 25 being in the U.S. Their touring schedule included Welcome to Rockville, the Carolina Rebellion, Rock Am Ring in Germany, and Rome.

On November 1, 2013, a new track from the album, a cover of the Ministry song "Thieves" was released by the band via their official Facebook and Twitter accounts.[156] On December 11, the band released a new single, the previously leaked song, "Lightz" along with an accompanying music video.[157]

The next single off the album, "Endless Slaughter" was originally set to be released only on cassette and during concerts,[158] beginning from June 2014 in Europe and culminating at Knotfest in Makuhari Messe, Tokyo, where Limp Bizkit performed along with festival founders Slipknot, and Korn, Lamb of God, Five Finger Death Punch, Trivium and In Flames,[159] however the single currently can be streamed and downloaded at the band's official website.

In October 2014, Fred Durst revealed that the band had left Cash Money, and became independent again. The split was carried out amicably, and Fred says that "We really love the jam we did with Lil Wayne, though. We love that song." (the song "Ready to Go").[160]

The band started 2015 with news that _Stampede of the Disco Elephants_ was in the final stages of production, however no news came of release of the album.[161] A few days later, the band announced their major 2015 tour called "Money Sucks" (for which Stanislav Lanovoy was videographer), a Russian 20-date tour to take place during October and November, celebrating the 20th anniversary of Limp Bizkit. The tour name was a nod to the difficult economic situation that Russia was facing at the time.[162][163]

Limp Bizkit performed as headliners of the ShipRocked 2015 cruise from February 2 to 6. Other bands present were Chevelle, Black Label Society, P.O.D., Sevendust among others.[164] But some days before the event, Borland took to Instagram[165] to express his discontent, posting a photo of his luggage with a caption reading: "Can't wait to see me some roided out tribal tattooed spray tanned Jell-O shot filled bohunks do their best drunk MMA impressions in the top deck mosh pit."[166] Speaking to _NME_, Borland moved to clarify the comments, saying "When I first read the description of the cruise I realized it is what it is and I thought I'd have some fun with it ... I'll retract everything if I don't see a big muscly frat boy moshing in the pit. I think that is going to happen though so I feel safe. I'm turning 40 next week and I think it's funny that I'm spending the last week of my [30s] on ShipRocked. It's funny to me. It's a joke with truth in it. I just don't want our fans to get all butthurt and thinking I'm criticising them, because I'm not." [167]

Before the band traveled to Europe to attend some shows and the "Money Sucks" Tour through Russia, Sam Rivers was diagnosed with a degenerative disease of the discs of the spine and that was complicated due to a pinched nerve, causing a lot of pain in such area, which prevented him from being with the band. Through the Armpit.net forums Sam offered this statement, adding that he will have surgery, following for rehabilitation.[168] 23-year-old old German bassist Samuel Gerhard Mpungu replaced Rivers for the tour.[169] Fred_Durst_&_Wes_Borland_@_KROQ_Weenie_Roast_2019_(Quintin_Soloviev).jpg Limp Bizkit offered several concerts in the United Kingdom during winter 2016 alongside Korn, two of the most prominent nu metal acts from the 1990s.[170] Regarding this nostalgic tour Fred says: "You may have experienced a lot of cool concerts in your life, but I can guarantee you that an evening with Korn and Limp Bizkit will always and forever be your favorite. No one brings the party harder, heavier, and more exciting than us. No one. And ... make sure you get plenty of rest the night before. It's time to bring it back!"[171]

Because of little information and constant delays for the release of _Stampede_, in an interview/talk with the podcast "Someone Who Isn't Me", Wes said that Fred "isn't happy" with what he was working on. The original idea was to follow the spirit of Beastie Boys' _Paul's Boutique_ album, but Borland commented that right now he didn't know exactly what Durst's idea was. The guitarist said that he (Durst) will "just keep working on something until he's happy with it, even if it takes years and years".[172]

DJ Lethal resumed performing with the band on March 17, 2018 at the Storm the Gates festival in Auckland, New Zealand.[173]

On Saturday, June 8, 2019, Limp Bizkit performed at the KROQ Weenie Roast 2019 at Doheny State Beach in Dana Point, CA. The festival also featured artists Snoop Dogg, The Lumineers, 311 and more. Limp Bizkit wasn't even supposed to play until The Kevin & Bean Show started their own petition to get Limp Bizkit added to the lineup.

Through a bit of "social harassment," Kevin & Bean launched a #BizkitForWeenie campaign that just couldn't be ignored, even by the band's front man Fred Durst, who agreed to perform on-air. Songs performed were Thieves (Ministry cover), My Generation, Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle), My Way, Break Stuff & Take a Look Around

On June 25, 2019, _The New York Times Magazine_ listed Limp Bizkit among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[174]

On July 8, 2019 the band played a new song from their forthcoming album called "Wasteoid" live in Paris.[175]


Style, influences, and legacy

Music, influences, and lyrics

Durst wanted Limp Bizkit to be a "megaband" which could cross over into as many different styles of music as possible.[176] Limp Bizkit's music has predominately been described as ,[177][178][179][180][181][182][183] [184][185][186][187] and rap rock.[188][189][190][191][192][193] Limp Bizkit have also been described as alternative metal,[194][195] alternative rock[196] and .[197] In 2000, the _New York Daily News_ labelled the band as "frat-metal".[198]

Limp Bizkit's music is noted for its "kinetic, frenzied energy".[199] Otto is adept in drumming in a variety of styles ranging from Brazilian and Afro-Cuban music to bebop and funk.[200] DJ Lethal functions as a sound designer for the band, shaping their sound. According to Lethal, "I try and bring new sounds, not just the regular chirping scratching sounds. ... It's all different stuff that you haven't heard before. I'm trying to be like another guitar player."[201] Borland's guitar playing is experimental and nontraditional, and he is noted for his creative use of six and seven-string guitars.[202] _Three Dollar Bill, Yall_ features him playing without a guitar pick, performing with two hands, one playing melodic notes, and the other playing chord progressions.[203] His guitar playing has made use of octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound.[204] Borland has also made use of unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes to create a disorienting effect, and hypnotic, droning licks.[205] The song "Stuck" uses a sustain pedal in the first bar, and muted riffs in the second bar.[206]

AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that their album, _Significant Other_, contains "flourishes of neo-psychedelia on pummeling metal numbers" and "swirls of strings, even crooning, at the most unexpected background".[207] The band did not employ solos until _Gold Cobra_ (except for the song "Underneath The Gun" out of _Results May Vary_), however, during the recording of _Significant Other_, drummer John Otto performed an extended solo in the middle of the song "Nobody Like You".[208] Durst's lyrics are often profane, scatological or angry.[209][210] Much of Durst's lyrical inspiration came from growing up and his personal life.[211] The song "Sour", from the album _Three Dollar Bill, Yall_, was inspired by Durst's problems with his girlfriend.[212] His breakup with her inspired the _Significant Other_ songs "Nookie" and .[213] When describing Limp Bizkit's lyrics, The Michigan Daily said "In a less-serious vein, Limp Bizkit used the nu-metal sound as a way to spin testosterone fueled fantasies into snarky white-boy rap. Oddly, audiences took frontman Fred Durst more seriously than he wanted, failing to see the intentional silliness in many of his songs."[214] Furthermore, Limp Bizkit's lyrics were described as "misogynistic".[215] _The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)_ focuses on more serious and darker lyrical subject matter, including Catholic sex abuse cases, terrorism and fame.[216]

Limp Bizkit's influences include The Jesus Lizard, Tomahawk, Dave Matthews Band, Portishead, Mr. Bungle, Sepultura, Ministry, Prong, Tool, Primus, Pantera, Minor Threat, Angry Samoans, Black Flag, the Fat Boys, the Treacherous Three, the Cold Crush Brothers, Urban Dance Squad, Rage Against the Machine, and Korn.[217][218][219][220][221][222]

Awards and recognition

Limp Bizkit has been nominated for and won several awards.[223] Limp Bizkit has been nominated for three Grammy Awards including Best Hard Rock Performance ("Nookie"), Best Rock Album (Significant Other), and Best Hard Rock Performance ("Take A Look Around"). Limp Bizkit has been nominated for 3 American Music Awards for Favorite Alternative Artist winning one of them in 2002.

In 1999, the band won the Maximum Vision Award at the Billboard Music Video Awards for their music video "Nookie".[224] At the 2000 and 2001 Blockbuster Awards, the band won the Favorite Group (Rock) award.[225][226] That year also saw the band winning a MuchMusic Award for Best International Video, honoring their video for the song "Break Stuff".[227] At the 2001 ECHO Awards, the band won the Best International Metal Band award.[228] At the 2009 Kerrang! Awards, the band won the Hall of Fame award.[229] Further expanding upon the group's achievements and popularity, they were also the first group inducted into MTV's _Total Request Live_ "Hall of Fame" on May 26, 2001.[230][231]

Richard Cheese performed a lounge rendition of the songs "Nookie" and "Break Stuff" on his debut album, _Lounge Against the Machine_.[232] "Weird Al" Yankovic's "Angry White Boy Polka" medley included Limp Bizkit's song "My Way".[233] The Vitamin String Quartet recorded a tribute album called _The String Quartet Tribute to Limp Bizkit: Break Stuff_, which contains reinterpretations of the band's songs performed by a violinist backed by cellos, synthesizers, and keyboard percussion.[234] Girl Talk sampled "Nookie" and "Break Stuff" in the song "Friends-4-Ever", which appears on his album _Secret Diary_.[235] The Blackout covered "My Generation" for the compilation _Higher Voltage!: Another Brief History of Rock_.[236] Bands citing Limp Bizkit as an influence on their music include the progressive metal band Proyecto Eskhata.[237]

While Limp Bizkit's popularity has declined in the United States since the mid-2000s, it has been noted in the media that the band still remains highly popular in Russia.[238][239]

Live performances

13-06-09_RiP_Limp_Bizkit_Wes_Borland_1.JPG.]] Borland is known for performing in costumes and body paint during concerts, appearing in bunny and kung fu suits,[240] and painted as a skeleton and what he describes as a "burnt match". Describing the character, he stated, "I go onstage wearing almost nothing. I have underwear and my boots on, and I paint my whole head black—from the neck up—and I have the black contacts. All you can see is these glowing teeth."[241] Borland's black contacts were customized for him by a company noted for making contacts for the science fiction TV series _Babylon 5_.[242]

In addition to Borland's visual appearance, the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances. Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually paid tribute to the film _Apocalypse Now_, with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep, camouflage mesh and palm trees.[243] During the band's tour with Primus, Limp Bizkit took inspiration from Primus' trademark self-deprecatory slogan "Primus sucks": Durst, Borland, Rivers, Otto and Lethal took the stage with middle fingers raised. According to Borland, "they finger us back—and you know what that means to us—that they love us. It's kind of like saying something is bad when you really mean good. Les Claypool came out the first night of the tour and got a big kick out of it. We figured it was the right idea. It makes hecklers go 'huh.'"[244]

During the band's sets at Ozzfest, audience members at the tour heckled Limp Bizkit, leading the band to use a 30-foot toilet as a stage prop, which they would emerge from during each performance; the band punctuated their sets by "flushing" cardboard cutouts of pop stars like Hanson and the Spice Girls.[245] During their appearance at the first Family Values Tour, Limp Bizkit performed on a set which the _Los Angeles Times_ described as "a mix of _The War of the Worlds_ and _Mars Attacks_". The band emerged from a spaceship during the tour, and Borland continued to experiment with visual appearances.[246] During the band's Halloween performance on the tour, each of the band's members dressed as Elvis Presley at various stages in his career.[247]
