TOM CURRY (born in Hounslow, England) is an English rugby union player, currently playing with the Sale Sharks. He plays as a flanker.


Club career

Curry made his professional debut against Scarlets on 15 October 2016 in the European Champions Cup, becoming the fourth-youngest English player and youngest Sale Sharks player to have played in the competition.[1] He scored on his Aviva Premiership debut on 30 October 2016, becoming the third-youngest scorer in the competition.[2] At the end of the 2016-17 season, he was named a joint recipient of Sale Sharks' Young Player of the Season award, sharing the award with his brother Ben.[3]


International career

Curry was named in the England U20 squad for the 2016/17 season on 14 October 2016, having previously represented England U18.[4] Curry was part of the England U20 squad that won a Grand Slam in the 2017 Six Nations Under 20 Championship.

He was called up to the senior England squad by Eddie Jones for their 2017 summer tour of Argentina.[5] In his first England appearance against the Barbarians on 28 May 2017 he was named Man of the Match.[6] The match against the Barbarians was a 'non-test' fixture, so he did not receive an official cap. Curry made his first capped appearance for England at flanker in the first test against Argentina in June 2017[7]. He became the youngest player to start at flanker for England[8], and the youngest England forward since 1912.[9]

Curry was named in England's 2019 Six Nations Squad and started at No 7 in all of England's games. He scored tries in the matches against Wales and Scotland.
