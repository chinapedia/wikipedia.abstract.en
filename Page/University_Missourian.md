The _UNIVERSITY MISSOURIAN_ newspaper ran from 1908 to 1916. This newspaper started the same year the University of Missouri School of Journalism opened. The _University Missourian_ provided practical experience for writing articles for journalism students at the university. This would eventually become the _Missourian_ newspaper as it is printed today.[1]


Background

Columbia_Missourian_headquarters.JPG The _University Missourian_ was started September 14, 1908, which was the same day classes started at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. The School of Journalism hired three experienced newsmen and faculty: Walter Williams, editor of the _Columbia Herald_; Silas Bent, from the staff of the _St. Louis Post-Dispatch_; and Charles G. Ross, from the _St. Louis Republic_. According to Dean Williams, the _Missourian_ provided practical experience to journalism students, as the paper afforded "a laboratory course in actual newspaper making." Throughout its early years, faculty members served as editors of the _Missourian_, assigning stories to students. During the early years, the paper suspended publication during summers and university holidays, reflecting its dependence on its student workers. The _Missourian_ continues in print today, and produces a Web version as well (http://www.columbiamissourian.com/). Its emphasis on University students and on campus life has broadened, offering full service as a community paper in Columbia, Boone County, and mid-Missouri.[2]
