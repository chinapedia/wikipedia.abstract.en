MARIA BENEYTO CUÑAT (14 May 1925 – 15 March 2011) was a Spanish poet.


Biography

Born in Valencia, Beneyto moved with her family to Madrid at age three, a city where she remained until 1937. After receiving an education in Castilian, in the first years after the Spanish Civil War she encountered an environment where, for the first time, Valencian occupied a prominent position. It was in these years that her dedication to writing solidified, in an especially self-taught manner which was common to a great number of writers of her generation. She also began a relationship with literary groups of Valencia. This education, straddling the two cultures of the Castilian learned in Madrid and her native Valencian, explains Maria Beneyto's literary bilingualism.

Maria Beneyto died on 15 March 2011.[1]


Work

Beneyto's earliest work was in Castilian: _Canción olvidada_ (1947) and _Eva en el tiempo_ (1952). During the 1950s she published her first two poems in Valencian: _Otra voz_ (1952) and _Rayas al aire_ (1956). In 1958 she produced her first prose work, the Castilian novel _La prometida_. She did not return to publishing in Valencian until the 1960s, with the novels _La gente que vive al mundo_ (1966) and _La mujer fuerte_ (1967). In 1977 she published the poetry collection _Vidrio herido de sangre_, and then began a long period of silence. This continued until the 1990s.[2]

In 1993 she published her _Antología poética_ and the collections _Tras sepulta la ternura_ and _Poemas de las cuatro estaciones_, as well as three collections in Castilian: _Archipiélago_ (unpublished poetry 1975–1993), _Nocturnidad y alevosía y Hojas para algún día de noviembre_, and an _Antología poética_. In 1994 a new collection appeared: _Para desconocer la primavera_. 1997 was again a prolific year in terms of publications, with a reissue of _La gente que vive al mundo_, the anthology _Poesía_ (1952–1993), and a new collection: _Elegías de la piedra quebradiza_. Her last collection was published in 2003: _Bressoleig insomnia anger_.

Throughout her literary career, Beneyto's work had been anthologized in several poetry collections, including _Las voces de la medusa_ (1991), _Paisaje emergente. Treinta poetas catalanas del siglo XX_ (1999), _Contemporáneas. Antología de poetas de los Países Catalanes_ (1999), and _Homenaje a la palabra. Veinticinco años de poesía al País Valenciano_ (1999). This places her as one of the main figures – along with Vicent Andrés Estellés, , and Joan Fuster – of the Valencian poetic generation of the 1950s.
