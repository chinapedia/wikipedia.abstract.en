Political cartoonist

Slorance first began drawing political cartoons during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.[9] His political cartoons subsequently attracted media attention during the 2015 general election after receiving recognition from Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon,[10] following which he live sketched STV's election night coverage.[11] He was then hired by STV to draw the Neil Slorance Sketch, a regular feature. In 2017, he left STV and later moved to The National to draw "The Slorance Sketch".

On January 22, 2016, one of his cartoons signed by Nicola Sturgeon was auctioned at the Govan Kingston SNP's Burns supper event to support her re-election.[12]
