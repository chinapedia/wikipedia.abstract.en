The ship had sails and up to 30 oars (15 on each side). They were short, narrow at bow and stern. and wider midships. They were one of the fasest ships and they were very easy to maneuver.[1] They had a flat hull, so that they could run aground without being damaged. Furthermore, the Navis actuaria could go ashore both forwards and backwards, since it was equipped with rudders fore and aft. The ship could run aground on a beach, unload, and depart without damage. When they took damage they did not sink into the water.[2] The ship was therefore suitable for the transport of supplies and horses.

It is believed that a _navis actuaria_ was long and wide. The ship's draft was low (about . Most of the _naves actuariae_ were not armed. However, ships that were used in 16 CE under general Germanicus, carried light weaponry.

The _navis actuaria_ should not be confused with the _navis lusoria_, which was a small patrol boat used in Late Antiquity.
