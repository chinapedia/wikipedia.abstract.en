    _Not to be confused with the St Mary's Church in the village of Plaistow, Bromley._

ST MARY'S CHURCH is a Church of England church in Plaistow, east London. With the three churches of St Matthias’, St Martin’s, and St Philip and St James’, it now forms part of the Parish of the Divine Compassion. Its Victorian building is now demolished and it worships in a smaller church built in 1981.[1]

It was built as a chapel of ease to All Saints Church, West Ham, then the only parish church in the area. It was promoted to a parish in its own right in 1844. The site was granted by Sir John H Pelly and the church designed in the neo-Gothic style influenced by the late Perpendicular style by Thomas Curtis. Notable among its vicars was Thomas Given-Wilson, who raised is capacity to 1,000 through a comprehensive rebuild. The parish also built several mission churches - St Peter's, Upton Road (1880s), St Katherine's on Chapman Road (1891; replaced by a permanent church in 1894; demolished 1965), St Thomas' on Northern Road (1898-1950) and St Matthias' Canning Town (1887).
