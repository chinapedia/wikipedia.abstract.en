BRIAN CHIBWE MUSHIMBA (born 7 November 1974) is a Zambian engineer with a PhD in Engineering and politician who has been serving in the cabinet of the Zambian government. His first cabinet portfolio was Minister of Transport and Communications and served from September 2016 to July 2019 before a cabinet reshuffle that saw him moved to the ministry of Higher Education in July 2019. Before joining active politics in 2016 as a way of giving back to his community, he studied, graduated and practiced engineering in the USA, Europe and around Africa with increasing responsibilities to become a Regional Director/CEO In the electricity generation, transmission and distribution sector.[1] Prior to being appointed minister, Mushimba stood and won the elections to become member of parliament (MP) for kankoyo constituency in mufulira district. A firm believer of how transformative education can be,by its impact on his personal life from poverty growing up in kankoyo as a child to privilege today, Mushimba has prioritized education and access to education in his rather poor constituency. He launched a "Mushimba Academic Scholarship" in 2017/2018 to take back to school all vulnerable kids in the constituency that had dropped out of school due to lack of financial sponsorship, many of them due to being orphaned. In its first year, the scholarship has sponsored 130 students at a cost of K236, 000 ($25,000). Further, recognizing the challenge of putting three meals on the table per day by the constituents, Mushimba started a farmer input support program that in its first year supported local farmers with farming inputs from fertilizers to seeds totaling k130,000 ($13,000) in its first year; all these programs were funded from personal funds from Mushimba himself.
