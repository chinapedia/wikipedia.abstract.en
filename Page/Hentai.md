Outside of Japan, HENTAI ( or ; __ ; "pervert") is anime and manga pornography. In the Japanese language, however, "hentai" is not a genre of media but any type of perverse or bizarre sexual desire or act. For example, outside of Japan a work depicting lesbian sex might be described as "yuri hentai", but in Japan it would just be described as "yuri".

The word is short for , a perverse sexual desire. The original meaning of _hentai_ in the Japanese language is a transformation or metamorphosis. The implication of perversion or paraphilia was derived from there. Both meanings can be distinguished in context easily.


Terminology

_Hentai_ is a kanji compound of (_hen_; "change", "weird", or "strange") and (_tai_; "appearance" or "condition"). It also means "perversion" or "abnormality", especially when used as an adjective.[1] It is the shortened form of the phrase which means "sexual perversion".[2] The character _hen_ is catch-all for queerness as a peculiarity—it does not carry an explicit sexual reference.[3] While the term has expanded in use to cover a range of publications including homosexual publications,[4] it remains primarily a heterosexual term, as terms indicating homosexuality entered Japan as foreign words.[5][6] Japanese pornographic works are often simply tagged as , meaning "prohibited to those not yet 18 years old", and .[7] Less official terms also in use include , , and the English initialism AV (for "adult video"). Usage of the term _hentai_ does not define a genre in Japan.

_Hentai_ is defined differently in English. The _Oxford Dictionary Online_ defines it as "a subgenre of the Japanese genres of manga and anime, characterized by overtly sexualized characters and sexually explicit images and plots."[8] The origin of the word in English is unknown, but AnimeNation's John Oppliger points to the early 1990s, when a _Dirty Pair_ erotic _doujinshi_ (self-published work) titled _H-Bomb_ was released, and when many websites sold access to images culled from Japanese erotic visual novels and games.[9] The earliest English use of the term traces back to the rec.arts.anime boards; with a 1990 post concerning Happosai of _Ranma ½_ and the first discussion of the meaning in 1991.[10][11] A 1995 glossary on the rec.arts.anime boards contained reference to the Japanese usage and the evolving definition of hentai as "pervert" or "perverted sex".[12] _The Anime Movie Guide_, published in 1997, defines as the initial sound of hentai (i.e., the name of the letter _H_, as pronounced in Japanese); it included that ecchi was "milder than hentai".[13] A year later it was defined as a genre in _Good Vibrations Guide to Sex_.[14] At the beginning of 2000, "hentai" was listed as the 41st most-popular search term of the internet, while "anime" ranked 99th.[15] The attribution has been applied retroactively to works such as _Urotsukidōji_, _La Blue Girl_, and _Cool Devices_. _Urotsukidōji_ had previously been described with terms such as "Japornimation",[16] and "erotic grotesque",[17] prior to being identified as hentai.[18][19]


Etymology

The history of the word _hentai_ has its origins in science and psychology.[20] By the middle of the Meiji era, the term appeared in publications to describe unusual or abnormal traits, including paranormal abilities and psychological disorders.[21] A translation of German sexologist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's text _Psychopathia Sexualis_ originated the concept of _hentai seiyoku_, as a "perverse or abnormal sexual desire".[22] Though it was popularized outside psychology, as in the case of Mori Ōgai's 1909 novel _Vita Sexualis_.[23] Continued interest in _hentai seiyoku_ resulted in numerous journals and publications on sexual advice which circulated in the public, served to establish the sexual connotation of _hentai_ as perverse.[24] Any perverse or abnormal act could be hentai, such as committing _shinjū_ (love suicide).[25] It was Nakamura Kokyo's journal _Abnormal Psychology_ which started the popular sexology boom in Japan which would see the rise of other popular journals like _Sexuality and Human Nature_, _Sex Research_ and _Sex_.[26] Originally, Tanaka Kogai wrote articles for _Abnormal Psychology_, but it would be Tanaka's own journal _Modern Sexuality_ which would become one of the most popular sources of information about erotic and neurotic expression.[27] _Modern Sexuality_ was created to promote fetishism, S&M, and necrophilia as a facet of modern life.[28] The ero-guro movement and depiction of perverse, abnormal and often erotic undertones were a response to interest in _hentai seiyoku_.[29]

Following World War II, Japan took a new interest in sexualization and public sexuality.[30] Mark McLelland puts forth the observation that the term _hentai_ found itself shortened to "H" and that the English pronunciation was "etchi", referring to lewdness and which did not carry the stronger connotation of abnormality or perversion.[31] By the 1950s, the "hentai seiyoku" publications became their own genre and included fetish and homosexual topics.[32] By the 1960s, the homosexual content was dropped in favor of subjects like sadomasochism and stories of lesbianism targeted to male readers.[33] The late 1960s brought a sexual revolution which expanded and solidified the normalizing the terms identity in Japan that continues to exist today through publications such as Bessatsu Takarajima's _Hentai-san ga iku_ series.[34]


History

With the usage of _hentai_ as any erotic depiction, the history of these depictions is split into their media. Japanese artwork and comics serve as the first example of hentai material, coming to represent the iconic style after the publication of Azuma Hideo's _Cybele_ in 1979. Japanese animation (anime) had its first hentai, in both definitions, with the 1984 release of Wonderkid's _Lolita Anime_, overlooking the erotic and sexual depictions in 1969's _One Thousand and One Arabian Nights_ and the bare-breasted Cleopatra in 1970's _Cleopatra_ film. Erotic games, another area of contention, has its first case of the art style depicting sexual acts in 1985's _Tenshitachi no Gogo_. In each of these mediums, the broad definition and usage of the term complicates its historic examination.

Origin of erotic manga

Akibachan5a.jpg.]] Tako_to_ama_retouched.jpg'' (1814), a well-known example of Japanese erotic art (_shunga_)]] Depictions of sex and abnormal sex can be traced back through the ages, predating the term "hentai". _Shunga_, a Japanese term for erotic art, is thought to have and existed in some form since the Heian period. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, _shunga_ works were suppressed by _shōguns_.[35] A well-known example is _The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife_, which depicts a woman being stimulated by two octopuses. _Shunga_ production fell with the introduction of pornographic photographs in the late 19th century.

To define erotic manga, a definition for manga is needed. While the _Hokusai Manga_ uses the term "manga" in its title, it does not depict the story-telling aspect common to modern manga, as the images are unrelated. Due to the influence of pornographic photographs in the 19th and 20th centuries, the manga artwork was depicted by realistic characters. Osamu Tezuka helped define the modern look and form of manga, and was later proclaimed as the "God of Manga".[36][37] His debut work _New Treasure Island_ was released in 1947 as a comic book through Ikuei Publishing and sold over 400,000 copies,[38] though it was the popularity of Tezuka's _Astro Boy_, _Metropolis_, and _Jungle Emperor_ manga that would come to define the media. This story-driven manga style is distinctly unique from comic strips like _Sazae-san_, and story-driven works are now dominating _shōjo_ and _shōnen_ magazines.[39]

Adult themes in manga have existed since the 1940s, but some of these depictions were more realistic than the cartoon-cute characters popularized by Tezuka.[40] Early well-known "_ero-gekiga_" releases were _Ero Mangatropa_ (1973), _Erogenica_ (1975), and _Alice_ (1977).[41] The distinct shift in the style of Japanese pornographic comics from realistic to cartoon-cute characters is accredited to Azuma Hideo, "The Father of Lolicon".[42] In 1979, he penned _Cybele_, which offered the first commentary on unrealistic depictions of sexual acts between Tezuka-style characters. This would start a pornographic manga movement.[43] The lolicon boom of the 1980s saw the rise of magazines such as the anthologies _Lemon People_ and _Petit Apple Pie_.

The publication of erotic materials in the United States can be traced back to at least 1990, when IANVS Publications printed its first _Anime Shower Special_.[44] In March 1994, Antarctic Press released _Bondage Fairies_, an English translation of _Insect Hunter_.[45]

Origin of erotic anime

Because there are fewer animation productions, most erotic works are retroactively tagged as _hentai_ since the coining of the term in English. _Hentai_ is typically defined as consisting of excessive nudity, and graphic sexual intercourse whether or not it is perverse. The term "ecchi" is typically related to fanservice, with no sexual intercourse being depicted.

Two early works escape being defined as hentai, but contain erotic themes. This is likely due to the obscurity and unfamiliarity of the works, arriving in the United States and fading from public focus a full twenty years before importation and surging interests coined the Americanized term _hentai_. The first is the 1969 film _One Thousand and One Arabian Nights_, which faithfully includes erotic elements of the original story.[46] In 1970, _Cleopatra: Queen of Sex_, was the first animated film to carry an X rating, but it was mislabeled as erotica in the United States.[47]

The _Lolita Anime_ series is typically identified as the first erotic anime and original video animation (OVA); it was released in 1984 by Wonder Kids. Containing eight episodes, the series focused on underage sex and rape, and included one episode containing BDSM bondage.[48] Several sub-series were released in response, including a second _Lolita Anime_ series released by Nikkatsu.[49] It has not been officially licensed or distributed outside of its original release.

The _Cream Lemon_ franchise of works ran from 1984 to 2005, with a number of them entering the American market in various forms.[50] _The Brothers Grime_ series released by Excalibur Films contained _Cream Lemon_ works as early as 1986.[51] However, they were not billed as anime and were introduced during the same time that the first underground distribution of erotic works began.[52]

The American release of licensed erotic anime was first attempted in 1991 by Central Park Media, with _I Give My All_, but it never occurred.[53] In December 1992, _Devil Hunter Yohko_ was the first risque (ecchi) title that was released by A.D. Vision.[54] While it contains no sexual intercourse, it pushes the limits of the ecchi category with sexual dialogue, nudity and one scene in which the heroine is about to be raped.

It was Central Park Media's 1993 release of _Urotsukidoji_ which brought the first hentai film to American viewers.[55] Often cited for creating the hentai and tentacle rape genres, it contains extreme depictions of violence and monster sex.[56] As such, it is acknowledged for being the first to depict tentacle sex on screen.[57] When the film premiered in the United States, it was described as being "drenched in graphic scenes of perverse sex and ultra-violence".[58]

Following this release, a wealth of pornographic content began to arrive in the United States, with companies such as A.D. Vision, Central Park Media and Media Blasters releasing licensed titles under various labels.[59] A.D. Vision's label SoftCel Pictures released 19 titles in 1995 alone.[60] Another label, Critical Mass, was created in 1996 to release an unedited edition of _Violence Jack_.[61] When A.D. Vision's hentai label SoftCel Pictures shut down in 2005, most of its titles were acquired by Critical Mass. Following the bankruptcy of Central Park Media in 2009, the licenses for all Anime 18-related products and movies were transferred to Critical Mass.[62]

Origin of erotic games

Hentai_-_yuuree-redraw.jpg'']] The term _eroge_ (erotic game) literally defines any erotic game, but has become synonymous with video games depicting the artistic styles of anime and manga. The origins of _eroge_ began in the early 1980s, while the computer industry in Japan was struggling to define a computer standard with makers like NEC, Sharp, and Fujitsu competing against one another.[63] The PC98 series, despite lacking in processing power, CD drives and limited graphics, came to dominate the market, with the popularity of _eroge_ games contributing to their success.[64][65]

Due to the vague definitions of any erotic game, depending on its classification, citing the first erotic game is a subjective one. If the definition applies to adult themes, the first game was _Softporn Adventure_. Released in America in 1981 for the Apple II, this was a text-based comedic game from On-Line Systems. If _eroge_ is defined as the first graphical depictions or Japanese adult themes, it would be Koei's 1982 release of _Night Life_.[66][67] Sexual intercourse is depicted through simple graphic outlines. Notably, _Night Life_ was not intended to be erotic so much as an instructional guide "to support married life". A series of "undressing" games appeared as early as 1983, such as "Strip Mahjong". The first anime-styled erotic game was _Tenshitachi no Gogo_, released in 1985 by JAST. In 1988, ASCII released the first erotic role-playing game, _Chaos Angel_.[68] In 1989, AliceSoft released the turn-based role-playing game _Rance_ and ELF released _Dragon Knight_.[69]

In the late 1980s, _eroge_ began to stagnate under high prices and the majority of games containing uninteresting plots and mindless sex.[70] ELF's 1992 release of _Dokyusei_ came as customer frustration with _eroge_ was mounting and spawned a new genre of games called dating sims.[71] _Dokyusei_ was unique because it had no defined plot and required the player to build a relationship with different girls in order to advance the story.[72] Each girl had her own story, but the prospect of consummating a relationship required the girl growing to love the player; there was no easy sex.[73]

The term "visual novel" is vague, with Japanese and English definitions classifying the genre as a type of interactive fiction game driven by narration and limited player interaction. While the term is often retroactively applied to many games, it was Leaf that coined the term with their "Leaf Visual Novel Series" (LVNS) with the 1996 release of _Shizuku_ and _Kizuato_.[74] The success of these two dark _eroge_ games would be followed by the third and final installment of the LVNS, the 1997 romantic _eroge_ _To Heart_.[75] _Eroge_ visual novels took a new emotional turn with Tactics' 1998 release _One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e_.[76] Key's 1999 release of _Kanon_ proved to be a major success and would go on to have numerous console ports, two manga series and two anime series.


Censorship

Akihabara_August_2014_07.JPG Japanese laws have impacted depictions of works since the Meiji Restoration, but these predate the common definition of hentai material. Since becoming law in 1907, Article 175 of the Criminal Code of Japan forbids the publication of obscene materials. Specifically, depictions of male–female sexual intercourse and pubic hair are considered obscene, but bare genitalia is not. As censorship is required for published works, the most common representations are the blurring dots on pornographic videos and "bars" or "lights" on still images. In 1986, Toshio Maeda sought to get past censorship on depictions of sexual intercourse, by creating tentacle sex.[77] This led to the large number of works containing sexual intercourse with monsters, demons, robots, and aliens, whose genitals look different from men's. While western views attribute hentai to any explicit work, it was the products of this censorship which became not only the first titles legally imported to America and Europe, but the first successful ones. While uncut for American release, the United Kingdom's release of _Urotsukidoji_ removed many scenes of the violence and tentacle rape scenes.[78]

It was also because of this law that the artists began to depict the characters with a minimum of anatomical details and without pubic hair, by law, prior to 1991. Part of the ban was lifted when Nagisa Oshima prevailed over the obscenity charges at his trial for his film _In the Realm of the Senses_.[79] Though not enforced, the lifting of this ban did not apply to anime and manga as they were not deemed artistic exceptions.[80]

Alterations of material or censorship and banning of works are common. The US release of _La Blue Girl_ altered the age of the heroine from 16 to 18, removed sex scenes with a dwarf ninja named Nin-nin, and removed the Japanese blurring dots.[81] _La Blue Girl_ was outright rejected by UK censors who refused to classify it and prohibited its distribution.[82][83] In 2011, the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan sought a ban on the subgenre _lolicon_.[84][85]


Demographics

Toys_Otaku_Buy_3.jpg The most prolific consumers of hentai are men. _Eroge_ games in particular combine three favored media—cartoons, pornography and gaming—into an experience. The hentai genre engages a wide audience that expands yearly, and desires better quality and storylines, or works which push the creative envelope.[86] Nobuhiro Komiya, a manga censorship worker, states that the unusual and extreme depictions in hentai are not about perversion so much as they are an example of the profit-oriented industry.[87] Anime depicting normal sexual situations enjoy less market success than those that break social norms, such as sex at schools or bondage.[88]

According to clinical psychologist Megha Hazuria Gorem, "Because toons are a kind of final fantasy, you can make the person look the way you want him or her to look. Every fetish can be fulfilled."[89] Sexologist Narayan Reddy noted of _eroge_ games, "Animators make new games because there is a demand for them, and because they depict things that the gamers do not have the courage to do in real life, or that might just be illegal, these games are an outlet for suppressed desire."[90]


Classification

The hentai genre can be divided into numerous subgenres, the broadest of which encompasses heterosexual and homosexual acts. Hentai that features mainly heterosexual interactions occur in both male-targeted (_ero_) and female-targeted ("ladies' comics") form. Those that feature mainly homosexual interactions are known as _yaoi_ (male–male) and _yuri_ (female–female). Both _yaoi_ and, to a lesser extent, _yuri_, are generally aimed at members of the opposite sex from the persons depicted. While _yaoi_ and _yuri_ are not always explicit, their pornographic history and association remain.[91] _Yaoi_{{'s}} pornographic usage has remained strong in textual form through fanfiction.[92] The definition of _yuri_ has begun to be replaced by the broader definitions of "lesbian-themed animation or comics".[93]

Hentai is perceived as "dwelling" on sexual fetishes.[94] These include dozens of fetish and paraphilia related subgenres, which can be further classified with additional terms, such as heterosexual or homosexual types.

Many works are focused on depicting the mundane and the impossible across every conceivable act and situation no matter how fantastical. The largest subgenre of hentai is _futanari_ (hermaphroditism), which most often features a female with a penis or penis-like appendage in place of, or in addition to, normal female genitals.[95] Futanari characters are primarily depicted as having sex with other women and will almost always be submissive with a male; exceptions include Yonekura Kengo's work, which features female empowerment and domination over males.[96]
