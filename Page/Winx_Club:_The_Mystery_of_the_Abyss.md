_WINX CLUB: THE MYSTERY OF THE ABYSS_ (Italian: _Winx Club - Il mistero degli abissi_) is a 2014 Italian computer-animated film based on the television series _Winx Club_. It is the third film based on the show, following 2007's _The Secret of the Lost Kingdom_ and 2010's _Magical Adventure_. It was directed and produced by series creator Iginio Straffi, who also co-wrote the film with Giovanni Masi.

The film takes place after the fifth season of the animated series.[1] It follows the Winx fairies as they work to bring balance back to the Infinite Ocean after the Trix, a trio of witches, team up with a nymph named Politea to find a pearl and destroy the source of the fairies' power. The film's release was timed to coincide with the series' tenth anniversary. The film was first released by 01 Distribution in Italy on 4 September 2014.[2] It was shown in theaters across Europe, while most international releases were televised or direct-to-video.


Plot

The Trix witches are in the Infinite Ocean, unsuccessfully trying to harness the power of the Emperor's Throne. They end up accidentally summoning the cursed nymph Politea and engage in a battle with her. Politea informs them that the throne will only empower the true emperor, Tritannus. The witches make a deal with Politea to return Tritannus from his prison in the Realm of Oblivion, which is only possible with the vital force of a young prince. Once they free Tritannus, the Trix plan to convince him to retrieve the mystical Pearl of the Deep, which will free Politea from her curse so she can help the Trix.

The Trix travel to Gardenia to attack Bloom and her fiancé, Prince Sky. The two manage to hide, but the Trix capture Bloom's pet rabbit, Kiko. The Trix render Sky unconscious after he tries to rescue Kiko. The Trix bring Sky to the Infinite Ocean and tie him to the Emperor's Throne. The Trix and Politea cast a spell and Tritannus appears in front of them. Politea leaves, warning the Trix not to tell Tritannus anything about her. After Tritannus gains his consciousness, Trix leader Icy helps him regain his memory. He tells them that a powerful nymph, Omnia, has hidden the Pearl of the Deep. Tritannus and the Trix head towards Omnia's cave.

At Alfea College, Bloom's friends agree to help her journey to the Infinite Ocean to save Sky. They discover that Tritannus has sealed every gateway to the ocean except for the Oblivion Portal. The Winx enter the portal and are led through a dangerous dimension. Bloom wakes up in an empty void, where a dark illusion of herself appears to tell her that she has abandoned Sky. When Bloom eventually realizes that she is inside the Realm of Oblivion, she wakes the other Winx. They break free from the dimension with a convergence spell.

The Winx hurry towards the Emperor's Throne, where they fight Politea. Sky gains consciousness and tells them to visit Omnia, who tells them that the Pearl of the Deep has been hidden in the Coral Barrier. They arrive at the barrier to find the Trix and Tritannus, who grabs the pearl and leaves the Winx trapped in the barrier. The girls escape through an underground tunnel and hurry back to the throne, where Politea appears in front of Tritannus and snatches the pearl from him. She sits on the throne, revealing that she fooled the Trix and will not follow through on their deal.

The Trix try to fight Politea, but she hypnotizes them and Tritannus. Sky breaks free from the throne and Bloom's bonded selkie, Serena, snatches the pearl from Politea's hand. She gives the pearl to Bloom, who uses it in a convergence spell to destroy Politea. Later, Omnia uses the pearl's energy to heal Sky. The friends return to Alfea, where Sky wakes up and asks what happened to the Trix and Tritannus. The Winx explain that the Trix have fled, Tritannus is once again banished to the Oblivion, and the pearl is back where it should be. Bloom and Sky share a kiss.

Production

In November 2007, Iginio Straffi stated that Rainbow was "counting on" producing a trilogy of _Winx_ films,[3] and that the movies would be given theatrical releases if the box office response to _The Secret of the Lost Kingdom_ was positive.[4]

_The Mystery of the Abyss_ was animated using Autodesk Maya and other programs over a period of two years.[5] Around 400 people worked on the film at the Rainbow CGI studio in Rome.[6] The Rainbow team drew around 112 preparatory sketches to design the 34 three-dimensional sets and 167 character models that were rendered for the production.[7] The completed film contains a total of 113,221 key frames, made up of over 6 million layers.[8] Each animator was able to produce between 0.5 and 5 seconds of animation a day.[9] 70 minutes of music, including four original songs, were recorded for the film.[10]


Reception

Box office

In its opening weekend, _Winx Club: The Mystery of the Abyss_ grossed $972,838 in 328 theaters across Italy, ranking  3 at the box office and averaging $2,966 per venue.[11] The film made $469,301 in its second weekend, finishing seventh, and then $240,575 in its third weekend, finishing tenth.[12] At the end of its run, Box Office Mojo recorded that _The Mystery of the Abyss_ had grossed $5.3 million in eleven territories (including $2.3 million in Italy),[13] against a production budget of €12 million.[14] Box office information for the rest of the 30[15] territories is unknown. In a 2014 _Il Fatto Quotidiano_ article about the decline of the Italian box office, _The Mystery of the Abyss_ was highlighted as the only currently-playing Italian film which had grossed over a million euros (according to data from box office compiler Cinetel).[16]


Release

Rainbow announced that a third _Winx_ film was in production at the Brand Licensing Europe event in October 2013.[17] A teaser trailer for the film was released to YouTube on 16 April 2014. Its release date was first announced in May 2014, and it was advertised as part of the celebrations marking _Winx Club_{{'}}s tenth anniversary as a brand.[18] The film's title was chosen as part of a promotion on the official _Winx Club_ website, which included a poll that asked fans to vote on one of four potential titles. Iginio Straffi and Joanne Lee, the executive producer, appeared alongside Winx mascots on the red carpet of the 2014 Venice Film Festival to promote the movie.[19]
