The KENSINGTON VESTRY HALL is a historic building on Kensington High Street in Kensington, London, England. It houses Bank Melli Iran.


History

The Kensington Vestry Hall was built by Thomas Corby in 1852.[1][2] It was designed by architect James Broadbridge.[3][4] Its construction was met with dismay by ratepayers, who complained about the outlandish railings.[5] They were finally removed in 1880.[6]

From 1889 to 1960, the building housed the Kensington Central Library.[7] It was dedicated by Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll in November 1889.[8]

It has been listed as Grade II by English Heritage since April 15, 1969.[9] By 1998, it was "the only substantial remnant" of what the street looked like during the Victorian era.[10]

It is now home to Bank Melli Iran.[11]
