_EUCALYPTUS DOLICHOCERA_ is a species of mallee that is endemic to Western Australia. It has rough, ribbony bark near the base, smooth grey to brownish above, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds arranged in groups of seven, yellow to cream-coloured flowers and cup-shaped or urn-shaped fruit.


Description

_Eucalyptus dolichocera_ is a mallee, rarely a tree, that typically grows to a height of and has rough, ribbony, grey-brown or red-brown bark on the lowest of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves arranged in opposite pairs, lance-shaped, slightly glaucous up to long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance-shaped, dull green, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a narrow conical operculum up to three times as long as the floral cup. Flowering occurs between October and November and the flowers are yellow to cream-coloured. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped to urn-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed below the rim.[1][2][3][4]


Classification

_Eucalyptus dolichocera_ was first formally described by the botanists Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson and Ken Hill in 1999 in the journal _Telopea_. The type specimen was collected by Ian Brooker and Donald Blaxell in 1975 about north east of Kalbarri on the North West Coastal Highway.[5][6] The specific epithet (_dolichocera_) is derived from the Ancient Greek words _dolichos_ meaning "long"[7] and _keros_ meaning "horn"[8] referring to the long narrow operculum.[9]

This species belongs to the _Eucalyptus_ subgenus _Symphyomyrtus_ in the section _Bisectae_ and the subsection _Destitutae_. It is similar in appearance to _Eucalyptus moderata_.[10]


Distribution

This mallee grows in laterite, limestone or sand on dunes, flats and sandplains and has a range from just north of Geraldton to Dowerin and Wongan Hills in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Mallee and Yalgoo biogeographic regions.[11][12]


Conservation status

_Eucalyptus dolichocera_ is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife[13]
