In shogi, FOURTH FILE ROOK (四間飛車 _shikenbisha_) is a class of Ranging Rook openings in which the rook is initially positioned on the fourth file if played by White or the sixth file if played by Black.


History

The earliest recorded shogi game was a Static Rook vs. Fourth File Rook game from 1607. Black was who played a Right Fourth File Rook position (Static Rook) against Sansa Hon'inbō's Fourth File Rook. Ōhashi won the game.

Bishop-Exchange Fourth File Rook

The Bishop-Exchange Fourth File is a Fourth File Rook opening in which the player's bishop diagonal remains open allowing for a bishop exchange to occur early in the opening.

Leghorn Special

The Leghorn Special (白色レグホン・スペシャル _hakushoku reguhon supesharu_ or, most commonly, the abbreviation レグスペ _regusupe_) is an opening in which you build up an Anaguma castle while you're simultaneously defending against an opponent's Anaguma. It's a Bishop Exchange Fourth File Rook Anaguma, and it's also famous as an opening to prevent the building of Anaguma. The name is said to have originated in the resemblance of this opening to the behavior of a white leghorn chicken that keeps attacking when surrounded by Anaguma.

The leghorn special consists mainly in castling the king in Anaguma once the bishops have been exchanged in Fourth File Rook. It requires that the opponent is playing Static Rook, and that you're playing White. Following Black's K-68, White would go for the bishop exchange (Bx88), which leads to Black's Sx88, hence reducing the escape routes of Black's king and interfering with Black's castle formation. So, the Leghorn Special prevents (or at least slows down) Black's Anaguma, while White can devote to building its own Anaguma without problem.


Fourth File Rook in Double Ranging Rook

Fourth File Rook positions are not often used in Double Ranging Rook games in professional play. When they are used, the positions often transition to Opposing Rook positions.
