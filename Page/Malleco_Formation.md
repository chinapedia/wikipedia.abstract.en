MALLECO FORMATION () is a geological formation of volcanic origin in the Andes of Araucanía Region (38–39° S), Chile. The formation is made up by volcaniclastic rocks, including tuffs, lahars and lavas of Pliocene–Early Pleistocene age.[1] It is considered equivalent to the Cola de Zorro Formation found further north in Chile and the so-called "Asociación volcánica de la precordillera oriental" located around the upper courses Bío Bío and Aluminé rivers.[2][3]
