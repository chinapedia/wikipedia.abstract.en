It is set in the Arrowverse, sharing continuity with the other television series of the universe, and is a spin-off of _Arrow_. The season was produced by Berlanti Productions, Warner Bros.

Production

Development

In March 2016, The CW president Mark Pedowitz announced that _The Flash_ was renewed for a third season,[18] which was initially reported to be given a 22-episode order.[19] However, writer Brian Ford Sullivan clarified that August that there would be 23 episodes.[20] Andrew Kreisberg,[21] Aaron and Todd Helbing served as the season's showrunners,[22] while Zack Stentz, who wrote the season 2 episode "The Runaway Dinosaur", joined as consulting producer.[23] He announced his exit from the series on February 1, 2017,[24] and Aaron Helbing left in May 2017.[25]

Writing

In June 2016, Grant Gustin confirmed that the season premiere would be titled "Flashpoint" and adapt elements from the comics storyline of the same name which showed Barry Allen traveling back in time to save his mother from being murdered, creating a new timeline in the process,[26] though he later noted that "We're definitely doing this [_Flashpoint_] thing our own way…. This will be its own thing."[27] Gustin also revealed that the "Flashpoint" timeline of the series would not last for all of the third season, but that there would be "permanent ramifications".[28]

Casting

Main cast members Grant Gustin, Candice Patton, Danielle Panabaker, Carlos Valdes, Jesse L. Martin, and Keiynan Lonsdale returned from previous seasons as Barry Allen / The Flash, Iris West, Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon, Joe West, and Wally West, respectively.[29] Gustin also portrayed Savitar, the season's Big Bad.[30] Tom Cavanagh also returned as a regular,[31] portraying the Harrison Wells of Earth-19 who goes by "H.R". He also portrayed, in a less prominent capacity, "Harry" Wells of Earth-2, and several parallel universe versions of Wells as cameos: a hillbilly from an unspecified Earth, the Wells of Earth-17, and a French-speaking mime artist from another Earth.[32] Tom Felton joined the cast as Julian Albert, a fellow crime-scene investigator at the Central City Police Department.[33][34] The character was originally known as Julian Dorn,[35] and serves as the series' version of Doctor Alchemy.[36]

Rick Cosnett, who played Eddie Thawne as a regular during season 1, was confirmed to make a guest appearance in the second part of the season, with no additional details given about his return.[37] He was later revealed to be playing the Speed Force's manifestation of Eddie.[38]

Filming

Production for the season began on July 6, 2016 in Vancouver.[39][40] The episode "The Once and Future Flash" marked Tom Cavanagh's return to directing after a decade; he previously directed three episodes of the TV series _Ed_ (2000–2004).[41] Production concluded on April 22, 2017.[42]

Design

Practical effects and costume for Savitar were created by Legacy Effects. Kreisberg noted, "The suit's body lights were all practical, which I think was actually one of the hardest parts of the process. One light would go out and...Oh God, we'd be screwed!"[43] The Killer Frost costume seen in the third season differs substantially from that seen in season two; while the earlier version was simply leather pants and a jacket, this one includes fishnets, thigh-high boots and a cape.[44] The season introduces Wally West as Kid Flash, and the costume was designed to look exactly as in the comics. The Flash costume of the Barry Allen from 2024 was designed to look more sleek and form fitting than the present Barry's costume, and additionally features a more prominent yellow belt.[45]

Music

All music composed by Blake Neely.[46]

Arrowverse tie-ins

During the third season, _The Flash_ was a part of the "Invasion!" crossover event with _Arrow_ and _Legends of Tomorrow_. The event also saw Melissa Benoist reprising her role as Kara Danvers / Supergirl from _Supergirl_.[47] Andrea Brooks, who plays Eve Teschmacher on _Supergirl_, briefly reprised her role in the episode "Dead or Alive".[48] The _Supergirl_ episode "Star-Crossed" ends with Music Meister hypnotizing Kara on Earth-38 and fleeing to Earth-1 to do the same to Barry, thus initiating the events of _The Flash_ season 3 episode "Duet". Benoist returned as Kara, as did _Supergirl_ regulars Chris Wood, David Harewood and Jeremy Jordan, along with _Legends of Tomorrow_ regular Victor Garber and former _Arrow_ regular John Barrowman.[49]

In July 2016, members of the cast as well as executive producers Todd Helbing and Aaron Helbing attended San Diego Comic-Con to promote the season,[54] where the first trailer for the season was released.

New Dangers."[57]

In September 2016, The CW released the promo "Superhero Fight Club 2.0" to promote the start of the 2016–17 season with the addition of _Supergirl_ to their lineup, as well as their new mobile app, where the promo could exclusively be viewed initially. The new Superhero Fight Club sees Green Arrow, Flash, Atom, Firestorm, White Canary and Supergirl go up against a new fight simulator created by Cisco Ramon and Felicity Smoak, while Diggle and Martian Manhunter observe. After defeating the simulator, Cisco releases Grodd into the arena for the heroes to face.[58][59]

Critical response

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 86% approval rating with an average rating of 7.43/10 based on 22 reviews. The website's consensus reads, "Taking its most compelling and emotionally resonant turn to date, _The Flash_ shifts focus in its third season, turning from the grandiose and bizarre toward the characters who inhabit its core universe -- all while remaining action-packed, funny, and dramatic."[72] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 80 out of 100 based on 4 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[73]

Maçek III of _PopMatters_ rated the season 7 out of 10, saying, "When the show stumbles, the overarching story arc of the season keeps things going and keeps us interested [...] The show remains interesting and fun enough -- without being too lightweight -- to sustain another season and another cliffhanger."[76]
