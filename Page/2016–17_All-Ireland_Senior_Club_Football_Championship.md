The 2016–17 ALL-IRELAND SENIOR CLUB FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP was the 47th annual Gaelic football club championship since its establishment in the 1970-71 season. The winners receive The Andy Merrigan Cup.

On St. Patrick's Day 17 March 2017, Dr. Crokes from Kerry won the title for the second time by defeating Slaughtneil of Derry 1-9 to 1-7 in the final at Croke Park. Johnny Buckley was the winning captain.[1][2]

The 2015-16 champions were Ballyboden St. Endas from Dublin who defeated Castlebar Mitchels of Mayo on 17 March 2016 to win their 1st title. They were defeated in the second round of the 2016 Dublin Championship by Kilmacud Crokes.


Format

COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIPS

Ireland's 32 counties play their county championships between their senior gaelic football clubs. Each county decides the format for determining their county champions. The format can be straight knockout, double-elimination, a league or a combination.

PROVINCIAL CHAMPIONSHIPS

Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster each organise a provincial championship for their participating county champions. All matches are knock-out and two ten minute periods of extra time are played if it's a draw at the end of normal time.

ALL-IRELAND

The winners of the London club championship play one of the four provincial champions in a single match in mid-December. The match is usually played in London and is referred to as a quarter-final. Two semi-finals are usually played on a Saturday in mid-February. The All-Ireland final is traditionally played in Croke Park on St. Patrick's Day, the 17th of March.
