History

The magazine was established in 2009 by Patricia Maloney,[1][2] who served as director and editor-in-chief until 2015. In 2013, the publication acquired and incorporated the events website Happenstand[3] and the arts publication _Daily Serving_,[4] which maintained its independent site with Maloney as director. Beginning in 2015, the California College of the Arts became the publisher of _Art Practical_ and _Daily Serving_ with Maloney transitioning to executive director and with Kara Q. Smith and Bean Gilsdorf, respectively, as editors-in-chief.[5][6] In March 2015, Maloney resigned and took the position of executive director of _Southern Exposure_.[7] Michele Carlson was named as the new executive director in May 2016.[8][9]

The magazine has produced over 1,000 reviews,[10] hundreds of columns,[11] and more than a dozen thematic issues organized by staff and guest editors.[12] The publication also hosts a user-submitted events calendar for arts and cultural events in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The magazine has organized programming and partnered with numerous organizations including The Lab,[13] San Francisco Museum of Modern Art,[14] Ratio 3,[15] and the Asian Contemporary Arts Consortium.[16]

The publication was awarded a residency in 2011 in Kansas City via the Charlotte Street Foundation and Spencer Museum of Art[17] and a residency in 2012 in Miami via Cannonball (formerly Legal Art Miami).[18]
