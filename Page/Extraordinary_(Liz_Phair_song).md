"EXTRAORDINARY" is a song by American singer/songwriter Liz Phair.[1] It was released in January 2004 as the second single from her self-titled 2003 album.[2][3]


Release

The song was released as a promotional one-track CD single.[4]


Use in media

The song was featured in the 2004 film _Raising Helen_.[5] It was also featured in an episode of _Charmed_, titled "Oh My Goddess!"[6] The song was included on the teen pop compilation _Got Hits! 2_ as well.[7] The song was included on the soundtrack for _Queer Eye for the Straight Guy_.[8]


Music video

Two music videos for the song were released. The first features black-and-white footage of Phair singing the song.[9] After the song was featured in the 2004 film _Raising Helen_,[10] a second music video was made, featuring clones of Phair in front of various backdrops.


Critical reception

The song garnered mixed reviews from music critics, who were dissatisfied with her attempt to go mainstream. _Slate_'s Mim Udovitch said that Phair sounds "bogus,"[11] while _PopMatters_ called the song "sickeningly effervescent."[12] Some critics were more complimentary towards the song, however. Chuck Klosterman, writing for _Spin_, praised the song's "authenticity,"[13] while Allmusic noted that it was one of its parent album's highlights.[14] Michael Paoletta of _Billboard_ called the song "ultra-catchy" and "oh-so-buoyant".[15]


Commercial performance

Though the song failed to recreate the chart success of past hits "Supernova" and "Why Can't I?" it still managed to chart. It reached number 111 in the US, spending a total of 5 weeks on the "Bubbling Under Hot 100" chart.[16] It also charted on the Mainstream Top 40 chart[17] and the Adult Top 40 chart, on which it spent six months.[18]
