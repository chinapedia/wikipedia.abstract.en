Story

In an universe parallel to the main Super Sentai reality, countless planets including Earth have been conquered by the Jark Matter organization under the mysterious Don Armage. In response, an insurgent force called "Rebellion" is established and gathers nine alien warriors from across the galaxy who are chosen by the Kyutama, magical stones with the power of the constellations, to become the Kyurangers; the humanoids Lucky, Stinger, Naga Ray, Hammie, and Spada, the wolf-man Garu, the mechanical lifeform Balance, and the androids Champ and Raptor 283. Once assembled, the Kyurangers decide to start their campaign against Jark Matter by liberating Earth (their first target), as they are suspicious of why the planet is so heavily guarded by their forces. The team later gains three other members; their commander, the dragon-like alien Shou Ronpo, a young boy from Earth named Kotaro Sakuma, and Tsurugi Ōtori, a legendary warrior who defeated Jark Matter 300 years ago and was put to sleep until he is reawakened by the other Kyurangers.[1]
