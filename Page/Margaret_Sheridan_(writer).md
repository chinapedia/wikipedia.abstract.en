Life

Her father, Wilfred Sheridan was killed at the Battle of Loos on 25 September 1915. A sister died in infancy. She accompanied her mother to live in America in her early years.

Sheridan spent some time in Biskra, Algeria, where, in 1937, her brother Richard died of appendicitis, aged twenty-one, and she travelled extensively in the Saharan region. In 1935 she married Comte Guy de Renéville, an officer in the French army, and later _Chef de Cabinet Militaire_ to the Governor General of French Equatorial Africa.

She wrote autobiographies about her time in Algeria and the French Congo. Her mother died in 1970 and she inherited her copyrights. When Sheridan died in 1980 it is believed that her mothers and her own copyrights had no heir.[1]
