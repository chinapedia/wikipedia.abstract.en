It's almost like a video resume because I have my own personality on YouTube and since I don't play a character, they can see who I am and what I'm about. I feel like they know me on a personal level and know what I will be like to work with."[5] Caylen played Mikey in the 2016 Tyler Perry comedy _Boo! A Madea Halloween_,[6] and its 2017 sequel, _Boo 2! A Madea Halloween_.
