MIROSŁAW KĘPIŃSKI (born 27 July 1980 in Mława, Poland), known by his stage name MIRO KEPINSKI, is a Polish film composer, music producer, and performer. Graduating from a Classical Music school in Mlawa, Poland as Musician Instrumentalist (Classical Guitar), he then expanded his musical knowledge by enrolling at the Jazz faculty of the Academy of Music in Katowice, Poland, graduating with the title ‘Bachelor of Art’. Miro has gone on to enjoy a career playing a broad palette of musical styles including classical, rock and electronic. Miro composes mainly for film and his compositions can be heard in productions all over the world from Sydney to Los Angeles. His most recent credits include a multiple-award winning feature documentary 'The Wounds We Cannot See' by Alexander Freeman, drama 'In This Gray Place' by R.D.Womack II and a dark-comedy, horror 'Suicide for Beginners' by Craig Thieman. His music mixes minimalism with a ‘rawness’ of the north and a Slavic melancholy blended with the classic sounds.


MIRO

In 2014, Kepinski founded a post-rock, ambient solo music project where he played the electric guitar. On March 6, 2015 MIRO has released a 5-track maxi single _Be There_.[1] Track 'Be There' [original mix] was mixed by Aaron Harris, an acclaimed mixing engineer and ex-drummer of Isis and mastered by Maor Appelbaum.


Tanana

In 2015, Miro founded an electronic music project called Tanana. Tanana's debut EP, _Star_, was released on December 18, 2015. In 2016 Miro teamed up with a vocalist Steve Krolikowski from ex-band Repeater and Fear and the Nervous System, the conceptual side project of Korn's James 'Munky' Shaffer. This collaboration resulted in releasing a EDM track 'Situation'.[2]
