The DOLMA FESTIVAL IN ARMENIA is an annual festival, also known as UDULI, that is held annually near the city of Armavir, Armenia. It began in 2011 and focuses on appreciation of Armenian cuisine, especially dolma, a traditional Armenian dish made of ground beef, lamb and spices wrapped in grape leaves, cabbage leaves and vegetables.[1]

During the festival, chefs from Armenia and other countries aim to cook different kinds of stuffed vegetable dishes known as dolma. During the competition, festival guests can watch Armenian dances, listen to songs, and taste the dolma. At the end of the festival, a jury chooses the best chef. The winner gets a special prize â€” a golden statue.[2]

Armenian cuisine uses many spices and herbs, including salt, garlic, red pepper, dried mint (in Western Armenia), cumin, coriander, sumac, cinnamon, cloves and mahleb.
