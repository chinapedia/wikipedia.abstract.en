ROMANO SCARPA (September 27, 1927, Venice – April 23, 2005, Málaga) was one of the most famous Italian creators of Disney comics.


Biography

Growing up in Venice he developed a particular love for American cartoons and Disney comics, that, at the time, were published in the big format of the Topolino Giornale which was then printing now classic Floyd Gottfredson's stories. In the Forties he opened an Animation Studio in Venice in which he produced his first works: some commercials, a short titled _E poi venne il diluvio_ and another one titled _La piccola fiammiferaia_ (1953, based on Hans Christian Andersen's _The Little Match Girl_), distributed in Italy together with Robert Aldrich's _Attack!_ (1956).

Right after that he stopped working in animation for a while and dedicated wholly to creating Disney comics. When in 1956 Italian editors had no more new Floyd Gottfredson's stories to reprint, he was given the responsibility to continue Gottfredson's stories about Mickey Mouse. Also influenced by Carl Barks in the late Fifties and up to about 1963 he wrote and penciled stories like _Topolino e la collana Chirikawa_ (1960) or _The Flying Scot_ (1957) that have, later, been translated in many different languages throughout the world. Many of these stories have their backgrounds in movies, for example _Topolino nel favoloso regno di Shan Grillà_ (1961) is based upon Frank Capra's _Lost Horizon_ (1937); not to talk about all the stories starring Snow White or the Seven Dwarfs, obviously based on _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_ (1937). Sometimes the exact opposite happened; the Italian movie _Riusciranno i nostri eroi a ritrovare l'amico misteriosamente scomparso in Africa?_ (1968) is based on Scarpa's story _Topolino e il Pippotarzan_ (1957).

Around 1963, Scarpa stopped writing for 6 or 7 years. In the seventies, he moved to Spain and started working for a different publisher. Among the last things he made while he was still in Italy, at the end of the Eighties and at beginning of the Nineties, there are the so-called _Paperolimpiadi_ (a long story about the 1988 Seoul Olympic games) and some strip stories, the same kind of stories that he loved when he was a child. One of these, _Topolino e l'enigma di Brigaboom_ (1989) was partially based on _Brigadoon_ (1954).

In the meanwhile he has had time enough for some more animation, so we have _Aihnoo degli Icebergs_ (1972), _The Fourth King_ (1977) and a new TV series, _The Adventures of Marco and Gina_ (_Sopra i tetti di Venezia_) (2001).

Mainly Scarpa worked on Disney comics, but many years ago he used to do something non-Disney once in a while, so he did one (Rolf Kauka's) _Lupo_ story and one (Hannah and Barbera's) _Yogi Bear_ story. In the 1950s he also drew some _Angelino_ story, and Italian character.

Since 1988 some of his comic stories have been published in the USA by GLADSTONE PUBLISHING; it was the first time that this happened to an Italian Disney author. Later, when Disney Comics took Gladstone's place, they published some more of his stories, and in 2003, the same happened with Gemstone Publishing, that is publishing his stories in the US at the moment.

He has influenced many younger creators (Giorgio Cavazzano was his inker during the Sixties) and many have attempted to imitate his style.
