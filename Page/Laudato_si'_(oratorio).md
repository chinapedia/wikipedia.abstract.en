History

The work was commissioned by the Referat Kirchenmusik im Bistum Limburg (RKM), the division of church music of the Diocese of Limburg, to celebrate the organization's 50th anniversary.[1][2] The work was requested to include many different musical groups and styles, to represent the activities of the church musicians in the diocese, such as Gregorian chant, choral singing of children and adults, organ solo music, and Neues Geistliches Lied. The text was planned to contain writings by Pope Francis from his Apostolic exhortation _Evangelii gaudium_ (2013) and his encyclical _Laudato si'_ (2015), and the Magnificat in the traditional Latin.[3] The librettist, the Franciscan Helmut Schlegel, introduced additional writings by Francis of Assisi and Clare of Assisi, and focused on mercy corresponding to the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy in 2016.[4] Peter Reulein was commissioned to compose the music. The oratorio was published in 2016 by the Dehm Verlag. The composer conducted the premiere in a concert at the Limburg Cathedral on 6 November 2016.[5][6]

Scenes

Different actions comment on the verses of the Magnificat. The prologue introduces an angel announcing that God sent his Son when the time was fulfilled, the Choralschola emphasizes that the Son shows God's face of mercy, and the choir concludes that the time is fulfilled.[8]

Scene 1 introduces Clare and Francis of Assisi singing "" in tarantella rhythm, ultimately joined by the choirs. The schola intones the Dies irae expanded by Pope Francis, singing of the saddening situation of the environment caused by humans, in an to honour the Pope's home country. The scene ends with the Neues Geistliches Lied "."[9]

In scene 2, Mary tells of her experience of the Annunciation and begins the Magnificat, joined by the choirs. The scene is concluded with the 2009 song "" by Schlegel with a melody by Joachim Raabe (GL 885 in the regional part for Limburg).[10]

Scene 3 is focused on the Marriage at Cana, portrayed in Klezmer music. Pope Francis stresses the importance of the female voice in society and church. Mary sings "" (And his mercy), now from the Magnificat, joined by the choir.[11]

Scene 4 opens with the schola singing Stabat Mater, facing the Crucifixion. Pope Francis connects in recitative to drama of 2016, such as poverty, wars, and refugees, and forced prostitution. The verses from the Magnificat that focus on God's strong arm creating justice are given to choral fugues, interrupted by Clare and Francis reminding the listener to reflect who he is. The children open Halleluja as an African call and response, joined by all soloists and the mixed choir.[12][13]

Scene 5 opens with the schola singing the final line from the Magnificat, "" (As was spoken), to which Francis, the Pope, and Clare respond with a praising God.
