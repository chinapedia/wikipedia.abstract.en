She had her first New York solo show in 2008 in Manhattan gallery Monkdogz Urban Art.[12][13] More than 20 works from series _GAPscape Urban Art_ on canvas and Plexiglas were displayed accompanied by a monograph printed for that occasion.

In autumn 2008 Minya opened a second studio, in Zurich, Switzerland, and started her collaboration with KunstFokus.

In 2013 she began the collaboration with art critic Achille Bonito Oliva on her project: _GAPscape - State of Art Italia_

GAPscape - State of Art Italia

Figurative paintings, pigments on Plexiglas and the photography of those paintings taken in different cities around Italy. In this project, Minya's artistic research unites the technique developed while painting abstract art on Plexiglas with her affection for Italy. The central idea behind _GAPscape - State of Art Italia_ is to represent the present-day Italy through its most prominent personalities and their chosen locations. During the realization of the project, Minya personally involved the protagonists, such as Ennio Morricone, Andrea Bocelli, Umberto Eco, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Federica Pellegrini and many others.[27][28][29][30][31][32][33] Many of them also dedicated a personal thought or quote, a further contribution to the task of representing the current moment.[34]

The works form this series were exhibited at the Italian Consulate in New York in 2015 and at the Palazzo delle Esposizioni in Rome in 2016.[35] The exhibition in Rome comprised 78 works: 37 painted portraits, 37 photographs showing those portraits against the background of Italian cities and 4 abstract paintings.

TIMEscape[36]

Figurative paintings, pigments on Plexiglas. This series has been initiated in 2008 but it has not yet been exhibited

_TIMEscape_ is a socio-political, cultural and anthropological study. This artistic project is a visual diary that reflects this historical moment capturing the key current events in politics, culture, sport, environment and religion. With its numerous reflections _TIMEscape_ participates in a complex artistic debate searching for potential answers to most urgent interrogations presented by contemporary society.
