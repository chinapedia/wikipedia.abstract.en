_THE ALIENIST_ is an American period drama television series based on the novel of the same name by Caleb Carr. The ten-episode limited series[1][2] first aired on TNT as a sneak peek on January 21, 2018, before its official premiere on January 22, 2018, and ended on March 26, 2018.[3] The series stars Daniel Brühl, Luke Evans, and Dakota Fanning as an ad hoc team assembled in mid-1890s New York City to investigate a serial killer who is murdering street children. The series incorporates fact with fiction by including the characters that are historical figures, such as Theodore Roosevelt, who held the post of police commissioner from 1895 to 1897.[4] On August 16, 2018, TNT ordered a sequel series based upon the follow-up novel _The Angel of Darkness_.[5]


Premise

The psychological thriller drama is set in 1896, when a series of gruesome murders of boy prostitutes has gripped New York City. Newly appointed police commissioner Teddy Roosevelt calls upon Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, a criminal psychologist and John Moore, a newspaper illustrator, to conduct the investigation in secret. Joining them in the probe is Sara Howard, the headstrong secretary to the police commissioner, as well as the Jewish twin brothers Marcus and Lucius Isaacson, both detective sergeants in the NYPD.

The team finds opposition within the NYPD, primarily from Captain Connor and the recently retired Chief Byrnes, both of whom are more committed to protecting the reputations of New York's high society than they are to finding the perpetrators of the crimes; as well as from the working poor and lower class citizens who distrust them for being outsiders.

OPENING TITLE:


Cast

Main

-   Daniel Brühl as Dr. Laszlo Kreizler,[6] a psychologist (or alienist) who has focused recently on children suffering from mental illnesses, called upon by his former Harvard classmate Theodore Roosevelt to try to get into the psychology behind grisly child murders. He is German and comes from a well-off family, but lives alone save for his maid, valet, and stable boy. He suffers from a lame arm, and frequently seeks out the insight of former patients and criminals for help with his investigations and research.
-   Luke Evans as John Schuyler Moore,[7] a _New York Times_ cartoonist and illustrator, as well as a society man who attended Harvard with Dr. Kreizler and Roosevelt. He lives with his grandmother, and is estranged from his father following the drowning death of his brother. He is handsome and charming, but is an alcoholic and frequenter of brothels, and remains unmarried after his fiancée left him for another man. Like Roosevelt, he has known Sara since she was young.
-   Brian Geraghty as Theodore Roosevelt,[8] then the newly-appointed Commissioner of the NYPD. He is portrayed as commanding respect from certain people, but remains malleable by society's most venerable as well as veteran NYPD officers. He attended Harvard with Dr. Kreizler and Moore, both of whom he calls upon to mount a secret, parallel investigation into the child murders. He employs Sara Howard as his secretary, having known her father, and thinks highly of her.
-   Robert Ray Wisdom as Cyrus Montrose,[9] Kreizler's valet whom he employed after testifying on Cyrus' behalf during a murder trial.
-   Douglas Smith as Marcus Isaacson,[10] a young Jewish detective sergeant with the NYPD whom Roosevelt enlists to work with Kreizler, Moore, and Howard. He is Lucius' twin brother, and like his brother, is well versed in science and general crime scene investigation. He becomes involved with a Jewish socialist.
-   Matthew Shear as Lucius Isaacson,[11] Marcus' twin brother and another detective sergeant with the NYPD. He is much more cautious and restrained than Marcus, and eager to utilize the latest scientific techniques to solve crimes.
-   Q'orianka Kilcher as Mary Palmer,[12] Kreizler's maid. Like Cyrus, he took her in after she was acquitted for murder. She is mute and uses sign language to communicate, and has an affection for Kreizler.
-   Matt Lintz as Stevie Taggert,[13] a youthful ward and stable boy of Kreizler's who often assists Cyrus, and gets involved in the team's investigation.
-   Dakota Fanning as Sara Howard,[14] a young society woman who becomes Roosevelt's secretary and the first woman employed by the NYPD. She spent time in a sanitarium after the death of her father, whom Roosevelt and Moore both knew. She is composed and determined to not allow her male colleagues to disparage her. She gets involved with the team as a liaison between Roosevelt and Kreizler and Moore. The character is loosely based upon the story of Isabella Goodwin, New York's first female detective.[15]

Recurring

-   Antonio Magro as Paul Kelly,[16] a mobster who runs a brothel frequented by high society men.
-   David Wilmot as Captain Connor,[17] an Irish police officer who dislikes Roosevelt and who tries to subvert the team's investigations at every possible turn.
-   Jackson Gann as Joseph,[18] a young boy who works at a brothel and who endears himself to Moore.
-   Ted Levine as Thomas F. Byrnes,[19] the retired police chief who steers Connor toward protecting the rich and wealthy from being persecuted for their crimes and indescretions.
-   Emanuela Postacchini as Flora,[20] a high-end prostitute who counts Moore as one of her clients.
-   Michael Ironside as J.P. Morgan,[21] the financier and banker. He uses Connor and Byrnes as his muscle to enforce protecting his fellow members of high society.
-   Sean Young as Mrs. Van Bergen, the matriarch of the fictional van Bergen family. She is generally unperturbed by rumors about her son's actions, but nonetheless is compelled by Byrnes to take action to protect him.
-   Josef Altin as Willem Van Bergen, a young man who preys on prepubescent boys. He suffers from syphilis.
-   Peter McRobbie as Mayor William Lafayette Strong, the mayor of New York City from 1895 to 1897. He echoes Morgan and Byrnes' concerns for the city's upper crust.
-   Stephen Louis Grush as Jesse Pomeroy, a real-life child murderer from Boston. In the show's history, Kreizler attempted to study Pomeroy early in his career.
-   David Meunier as Adam Dury, a farmer from the countryside.
-   Bill Heck as John Beechum
