BABY, BABY, BABY is a 1953 hit song by Teresa Brewer from the film _Those Redheads from Seattle_. The song was written in 1950 by Jerry Livingston and lyricist Mack David. The song was sung by Brewer in the role of a singer, who appears through a red curtain line of dancing girls and commences the lyrics: "Baby, Baby, Baby love me love me do, Baby, Baby, Baby love me love true." The song reached No.12 in the US hit parade in December 1953.[1] Coral released the record first in 1953 as 9-61067 with the B-side "I Guess It Was You All The Time", written by Hoagy Carmichael and Johnny Mercer, then in 1954 as an EP, EC 81086 with A2: "Jilted" Robert Colby and Dick Manning, Track B1: "Chicago Style" James Van Heusen and Johnny Burke, and B2 "My Sweetie Went Away (She Didn't Say Where, When Or Why)" written by Rey Turk, and Lou Handman.
