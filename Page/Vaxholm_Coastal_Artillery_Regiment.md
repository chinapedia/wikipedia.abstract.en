The VAXHOLM COASTAL ARTILLERY REGIMENT (), designation KA 1, was a Swedish Navy coastal artillery regiment of the Swedish Armed Forces which operated between 1902 and 2000. The unit was based at Rindö in the Stockholm archipelago in Uppland.


History

On 1 January 1902, the Swedish Coastal Artillery was established as a separate military branch in the Swedish Armed Forces, following a decision taken in May the previous year. The decision meant that Karlskrona Artillery Corps and Vaxholm Artillery Corps was disbanded and that a coastal artillery was established.[1] The Vaxholm Artillery Corps was transferred to the coastal artillery and formed the Vaxholm Coastal Artillery Regiment (KA 1). The regiment manned the Vaxholm Fortress and Oskar-Fredriksborg Fortress as well as Fårösund's coastal position and Hörningsholm's coastal position.[2]

The regimental buildings, drawn by Erik Josephson, were completed in 1906. The barracks were completed already in 1904 and had three floors unlike the design which had four.[3] Parts of KA 1 was placed at Vaxholm and it was not until the 1940s that the operations were collocated to eastern Rindö next to Oskar-Fredriksborg Fortress. KA 1 consisted of artillery companies, naval mine companies and _yrkes_ (occupational) companies: an organization that was maintained until the 1940s. In 1941, the former buildings of the Vaxholm Grenadier Regiment (I 26) became a part of the KA 1. The part of the KA 1 that has been placed at the Vaxholm Fortress was instead placed in the former barracks of I 26.[4]

In 1981 the regiment became subordinated to the Stockholm Coastal Artillery Defense (_Stockholms kustartilleriförsvar_, SK/Fo 46) and renamed Stockholm Coastal Artillery Defense with Vaxholm Coastal Artillery Regiment (_Stockholms kustartilleriförsvar med Vaxholms kustartilleriregemente_, SK/KA 1). This organization was retained until SK was merge with the East Coast Naval Command in 1990.[5] The regiment was renamed the Vaxholm Amphibious Regiment (_Vaxholm amfibieregemente_, Amf 1) in 2000, when parts of the coastal artillery was converted into the Swedish Amphibious Corps. The Vaxholm Coastal Artillery Regiment was disbanded on 31 October 2000 as a result of the disarmament policies set forward in the Defence Act of 2000.[6]
