MORRIS GOODKIND was chief bridge engineer for the New Jersey State Highway Department from 1925 to 1955 (now New Jersey Department of Transportation), and was responsible for the contraction of numerous bridges during that period. Goodkind emphasized the integration of architecture and aesthetics in bridge design and received awards from the American Society of Civil Engineers and the American Institute of Steel Construction for his designs.

Goodkind was a graduate of Columbia University. He worked for the New York City Public Service Commission in the development of the subway system before working on bridge designs for engineering firms and Mercer County, New Jersey. He joined the New Jersey Highway Department in 1922, and was its Chief Bridge Engineer from 1925-1955, after which he retired to private practice.[1][2]
