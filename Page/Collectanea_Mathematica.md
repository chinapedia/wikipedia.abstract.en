_COLLECTANEA MATHEMATICA_ is a mathematical journal of the Institute of Mathematics of the University of Barcelona (IMUB), published by Springer since 2011, with a periodicity of three issues per year. It publishes original research papers of high quality in all fields of pure and applied mathematics.


History

Collectanea Mathematica was founded in 1948 by (it is the oldest mathematical journal in Spain [1]). Thanks to the contribution of some relevant mathematicians in Catalonia, like , and eminent international collaborators (Wilhelm Blaschke, Hugo Hadwiger, Gaston Julia or Ernst Witt), the journal reached a central role in the spanish scientific publications, under the direction of (1969-1971), who was also president of the , and specially with (1971-1986), president of the Societat Catalana de Ciències Físiques, Químiques i Matemàtiques (1968-1973). During the period 1987-2007, with Joan Cerdà as the Main Editor, the journal took several steps forward to further improve its scientific quality. In 2003, the recently created Institute of Mathematics of the University of Barcelona started to be in charge of its publication, providing Collectanea Mathematica with a stable economic and scientific support. As a consequence, coverage of Collectanea Mathematica by the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) began with the 2005 volume and 2007 was its first impact factor in JCR. In 2008 became the current Chief Editor. In this period the journal has changed its editorial policy and Springer is the new publisher since 2011.
