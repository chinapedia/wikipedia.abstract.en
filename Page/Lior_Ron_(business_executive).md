Recent career

In 2016 Ron left Google to found Otto, a company that makes self-driving kits to retrofit big rig trucks.[7] Quoted in Wired, Ron said he left Google because he “felt an obligation to bring this technology to society sooner rather than later.”[8] Otto launched in May, 2016 and was acquired by Uber in late July the same year.[9] The Uber partnership allowed Ron and Otto the opportunity to develop a freight marketplace for truck drivers.[10] In March, 2018, Ron left Uber with no immediate information about his future plans.[11]

On May 18, 2017, Ron and Uber launched Uber Freight, an app for long-haul truck drivers.[12] The Uber Freight app is "targeted towards vetted and approved drivers, who can browse for nearby available loads, see destination info, distance required and payment upfront and then tap to book."[13]


Controversy

Ron co-founded Otto with Anthony Levandowski, who faces a lawsuit from Google's parent company Alphabet that alleges Levandowski stole trade secrets while working for Alphabet's self-driving car division before he and Ron co-founded Otto.[14]
