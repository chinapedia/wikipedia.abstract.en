Postwar career

During August 1945, Brown was appointed deputy chief of staff of Sixth Army under General Walter Krueger. As an experienced staff officer, he participated in the planning of Operation Downfall, planned invasion to Japan. However, the Empire of Japan surrendered on September 2, 1945, and the operation was cancelled. Brown was decorated with the Bronze Star Medal for his participation in the planning. While he served in this capacity, he also participated in the Occupation of Japan.[11]

In December 1945, Brown was ordered back to the United States and promoted to the rank of brigadier general. He was subsequently appointed Chief of staff of V Amphibious Corps and succeeded Brigadier General William W. Rogers in this capacity. The V Amphibious Corps was officially deactivated in February 1946 and transferred to Washington, D.C., where he was assigned to the staff of the National War College.

His last service assignment came at the beginning of May 1948, when he was appointed deputy commandant of the Marine Corps Schools at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia.[13] Brown retired from the Marine Corps on July 1, 1950, and was advanced to the rank of major general on the retired list for having been specially commended in combat. Upon his retirement from the military, Brown resided in White Stone, Virginia, and died of cancer on March 10, 1971, in Portsmouth Naval Hospital. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia, together with his wife Josephine H. Brown (1896–1981).[14]
