_ARISTOBIA RETICULATOR_ is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae. It is known from Myanmar, India, China, Laos, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Vietnam. It feeds on _Prunus persica_, _Liquidambar formosana_, _Quercus acutissima_, _Prunus salicina_, and _Nephelium mutabile_.[1] Many references list the name as _ARISTOBIA TESTUDO_[2], but this name, though published earlier, is unavailable under the ICZN[3][4], primarily in that Voet's 1778 work giving the name _testudo_ fails to fulfill the requirement in ICZN Article 11.4 that a work must be consistently binominal; none of Voet's 1778 names, including _testudo_, are available.[5]


Description

This species has a black body with yellow spots, and black tufts on the basal antennomeres, similar to the related species _Aristobia approximator_; however, _A. approximator_ has tufts only on the 3rd antennal segment, while _A. reticulator_ has tufts on segments 3, 4, and sometimes 5.[6]
