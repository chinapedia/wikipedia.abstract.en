PETER ISAAC DIAMONDSTONE (December 19, 1934 – August 30, 2017)[1] was an American lawyer and politician from the U.S. state of Vermont, best known as a perennial candidate and co-founder of the Liberty Union Party. He ran for various Vermont political offices, all unsuccessfully, in every election cycle from 1970 until 2016.[2]


Early life

Diamondstone was born in the New York borough of The Bronx in 1934 and raised in the borough of Queens. His father was a dentist and a socialist.[3] In 1944, Diamondstone got a job passing out flyers for the fourth presidential campaign of Franklin D. Roosevelt. He received a law degree from the University of Chicago in 1960 and moved to Vermont in 1968, and soon began his involvement in politics there.[4][5]


Career

Diamondstone, along with former U.S. Congressman William H. Meyer, Bernie Sanders (who is a current U.S. Senator), and others, founded the Liberty Union Party in 1970.[6] From then until his death, he ran every two years for various political offices, never receiving more than 8% of the vote in general elections.[7]

Diamondstone arrived late to a debate for U.S. Congress in 1980, and was told he would not be able to participate. He remained in the debate area and was arrested.[8] He was also arrested in 1996 while attempting to participate in a debate for U.S. Congress, for which he was a candidate. He participated in a 2014 debate for governor of Vermont, along with all six other candidates.[9]


Personal life

Diamondstone and his wife, Doris Lake, had four children: Aaron, Jessy, Ian, and Paula, 14 grandchildren, and 3 great grandchildren.[10] He was an atheist.[11]

Peter Diamondstone died on August 30, 2017, at age 82. According to his wife of sixty years, he was suffering from several aliments, including heart and kidney diseases, and had been recently released from the hospital.[12][13] Upon his death, Bernie Sanders said, "I first met Peter Diamondstone over 45 years ago. While I have not had any real contact with him for many, many years, I have the feeling that he never changed. Peter was a very independent thinker, unafraid to express his (often controversial) point of view on any subject. As a result, he forced people to examine and defend their own positions. No small thing. In his own way, Peter played an important role in Vermont politics for many decades."[14]
