Language

Southern Lurish language is the southernmost section of Lurish language family. LURISH is a Western Iranian language continuum spoken by the Lurs in Western Asia. Lurish language forms five language groups known as Feyli lurish,[7][8][9][10] Central Lurish, Bakhtiari,[11][12] Laki[13][14][15][16] and the Southern Lurish.[17][18] The Lurish language is derived and descended from Pahlavi language and in comparison with other Iranian languages has been less affected by foreign invaders language e.g. Arabic and Turkic.[19][20][21] An important feature of Southern Lurish is some common characteristics like plural suffixes (al, yal and gal) that is common with Northern Lurish dialects including Laki and [[Feyli_language|Feyli lurish]. In northern parts, the language is highly amenable to Bakhtiari dialect and in southern regions is slightly affected by Persian language.

The authority of tribal elders remains a strong influence among the nomadic population. It is not as dominant among the settled urban population. As is true in other Lurish communities and Kurdish societies, southern Lurish women have much greater freedom than women in other groups within the region.[22]
