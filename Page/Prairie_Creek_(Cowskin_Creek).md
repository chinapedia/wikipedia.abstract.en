It flows south through the west part of the city then turns southwest to west. The stream passes under routes 14 and 5 within west Ava. The confluence with Cowskin Creek is just east of Arno about four miles west-southwest of Ava.[2][3]

Prairie Creek was named for the prairie land along its course.[4]
