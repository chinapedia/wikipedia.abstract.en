_TOTALLY RELIGIOUS_ is the fourth release and third LP by The Screaming Blue Messiahs and (as of 2016) their last studio album. The album was co-produced by previous Screaming Blue Messiahs producer Howard Gray and Rob Stevens.[1]


Reviews

The album has a 3/5 star rating on All Music. John Duggan wrote: "The final chunk of squalling guitar rant from the Screaming Blue Messiahs doesn't reach the relentless highs of Bikini Red, but it's pure mania nonetheless, and a sure shot for those who lapped up the first two waxings. The titles alone (_All Gassed Up_ and _Four Engines Burning [Over the USA]_) clue you in that this is no mellow fest."[2]
