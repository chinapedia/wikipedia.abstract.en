The ODESSA FUNICULAR (; ), serves the Ukrainian city of Odessa. Running alongside the Potemkin Stairs, it connects the Primorsky Boulevard with the Port of Odessa.[1]

Despite what its name suggests, in its modern state the Odessa Funicular is not technically a funicular, but rather a _double inclined lift_.[2][3] The system was built by the "Skylift" from Kiev.[4]


History

Odessa_Funicular_early_XX_century.JPG The funicular was designed by the engineer N. I. Pyatnitsky and opened on 8 June 1902. It was equipped with two passenger cabins for 35 persons each delivered from Paris.

In 1969 the original system was replaced by a cascade of escalators, which had to be closed in 1997.

Then in 1998, the city council decided to restore the service, this time in a form of an inclined elevator. Construction started in the same year, but they were delayed until 2005, and the ropeway was reopened on 2 September 2005.[5]

On 27 September 2016 it has temporarily interrupted the service due to repairs to the Potemkin Stairs.[6]
