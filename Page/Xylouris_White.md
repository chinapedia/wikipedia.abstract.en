XYLOURIS WHITE is a musical collaboration established in 2013, involving Greek singer and laouto player George Xylouris and Australian drummer Jim White, best known for his work with Dirty Three. The duo's music has been described as combining "free-jazz, avant-rock and ages-old Greek folk traditions."[1] To date they have released three albums, and undertaken a world tour.


History

The two musicians first met in Melbourne in 1990, when Xylouris was touring with his father, Antonis Xylouris,[2] and became friends. White first played with Xylouris' family band in Australia in 2009.[3] They began recording and performing regularly in public together in New York City in late 2013.[4] They released their first album, _Goats_, in 2014; it topped the _Billboard_ World Music chart.[5]

They performed together at the Sydney Festival in 2015, in advance of a world tour,[6] and released their second album, _Black Peak_, on Bella Union, in 2016.

Their third album, _Mother_, was released early in 2018.

Each of their albums have been produced by Guy Picciotto (Fugazi).[7]
