Research projects

1) The Hoasca Project- Hoasca is a plant-based botanically developed beverage that is used as a component of ritualistic practices in Brazil by the members of UDV, a syncretic religious movement in Brazil. It is the most comprehensive and in-depth study done on the relationship between Ayahuasca and mental health.[8][9][10]

2) Psilocybin- Charles Grob conducted a study that observed the effect on psilocybin when used by patients with advanced cancer and existential anxiety. From 2004 to 2008 the research group at Harbor- UCLA Medical Center conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation examining the safety and efficacy of psilocybin as a treatment for advanced-cancer anxiety. A total of twelve subjects were studied, all of whom tolerated the experimental treatment without adverse effects.[11][12]
