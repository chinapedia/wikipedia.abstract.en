History

The small indistinct building with a stone, brick, and stucco belltower, reflects multiple reconstructions. The chapel was initially build in the mid to late 11th-century, but rebuilt and expanded over the next two centuries till labeled a church. The belltower has stones arrayed in a herringbone orientations, interspersed with brick. In the 17th century, a hermitage for a single occupant was attached to chapel.

While the exterior is mainly rustic, the oratory is known for its frescoes from the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Five of them survive on the southern exterior flank, depicting San Grato of Aosta'' (protector against inclement weather, St Antony Abbot, St Giulio, the Pieta, and St Christopher (patron of travelers).

The interior of the church was frescoed in 1512 by the Sperindio brothers and Francesco Cagnola. Along the walls of the nave are depictions of the _Life and Passion of Christ_. Some of the events derive from new testament Biblical Apocrypha.

Cagnola painted thirty-seven squares, framed by white or red bands: thirteen depict _Stories of Christ's childhood_, twenty-three _Stories of his Passion_ and finally the _Story of Original Sin_. In the counterfacade arch, there is a depiction of the _Final Judgment_. In the apse, the superior portion depicts the _Annunciation and Incarnation_, while below is a _Holy Trinity_ in an awkward mandorla. The lower registers have a panel of apostles, and below them, allegories of the _Seven Works of Mercy_.[1]
