_ASTERIX_ or _THE ADVENTURES OF ASTERIX_ ( or _Astérix le Gaulois_ ) is a series of French comics. The series first appeared in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine _Pilote_ on 29 October 1959. It was written by René Goscinny and illustrated by Albert Uderzo until the death of Goscinny in 1977. Uderzo then took over the writing until 2009, when he sold the rights to publishing company Hachette. In 2013, a new team consisting of Jean-Yves Ferri (script) and Didier Conrad (artwork) took over. , 37 volumes have been released, with a 38th forthcoming 2019.


Description

Each Asterix comic starts with the following introduction:

  _The year is 50 BC. Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans. Well, not entirely... One small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the invaders. And life is not easy for the Roman legionaries who garrison the fortified camps of Totorum, Aquarium, Laudanum and Compendium..._ [1][2]

The series follows the adventures of a village of Gauls as they resist Roman occupation in 50 BCE. They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their druid Panoramix (named "Getafix" in the English translations), which temporarily gives the recipient superhuman strength. The protagonists, the title character Asterix and his friend Obelix, have various adventures. The "-ix" ending of both names (as well as all the other pseudo-Gaulish "-ix" names in the series) alludes to the "-rix" suffix (meaning "king") present in the names of many real Gaulish chieftains such as Vercingetorix, Orgetorix, and Dumnorix.

In many of the stories, they travel to foreign countries, though other tales are set in and around their village. For much of the history of the series (Volumes 4 through 29), settings in Gaul and abroad alternated, with even-numbered volumes set abroad and odd-numbered volumes set in Gaul, mostly in the village.

The _Asterix_ series is one of the most popular Franco-Belgian comics in the world, with the series being translated into 111 languages and dialects .[3]

The success of the series has led to the adaptation of its books into 13 films: nine animated, and four live action (one of which, _Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra_, was a major box office success in France). There have also been a number of games based on the characters, and a theme park near Paris, Parc Astérix. The very first French satellite, Astérix, launched in 1965, was also named after the comics character. As of 2017, 370million copies of _Asterix_ books have been sold worldwide,[4] with co-creators René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo being France's best-selling authors abroad.[5][6]


History

(1821 – 1896) paintings of Goths had been rather popular in France and are a possible role model for the _Asterix_ series.

  ]] Prior to creating the _Asterix_ series, Goscinny and Uderzo had previously had success with their series _Oumpah-pah_, which was published in _Tintin_ magazine.[7] _Astérix_ was originally serialised in _Pilote_ magazine, debuting in the first issue on 29 October 1959.[8] In 1961 the first book was put together, titled _Asterix the Gaul_. From then on, books were released generally on a yearly basis. Their success was exponential; the first book sold 6,000 copies in its year of publication; a year later, the second sold 20,000. In 1963, the third sold 40,000; the fourth, released in 1964, sold 150,000. A year later, the fifth sold 300,000; 1966's _Asterix and the Big Fight_ sold 400,000 upon initial publication. The ninth _Asterix_ volume, when first released in 1967, sold 1.2 million copies in two days.

Uderzo's first preliminary sketches portrayed Asterix as a huge and strong traditional Gaulish warrior. But Goscinny had a different picture in his mind, visualizing Asterix as a shrewd, compact warrior who would possess intelligence and wit more than raw strength. However, Uderzo felt that the downsized hero needed a strong but dim companion, to which Goscinny agreed. Hence, Obelix was born.[9] Despite the growing popularity of _Asterix_ with the readers, the financial backing for the publication _Pilote_ ceased. _Pilote_ was taken over by Georges Dargaud.[10]

When Goscinny died in 1977, Uderzo continued the series by popular demand of the readers, who implored him to continue. He continued to issue new volumes of the series, but on a less-frequent basis. Many critics and fans of the series prefer the earlier collaborations with Goscinny.[11] Uderzo created his own publishing company, Les Editions Albert-René, which published every album drawn and written by Uderzo alone since then.[12] However, Dargaud, the initial publisher of the series, kept the publishing rights on the 24 first albums made by both Uderzo and Goscinny. In 1990, the Uderzo and Goscinny families decided to sue Dargaud to take over the rights. In 1998, after a long trial, Dargaud lost the rights to publish and sell the albums. Uderzo decided to sell these rights to Hachette instead of Albert-René, but the publishing rights on new albums were still owned by Albert Uderzo (40%), Sylvie Uderzo (20%) and Anne Goscinny (40%).

In December 2008, Uderzo sold his stake to Hachette, which took over the company.[13] In a letter published in the French newspaper _Le Monde_ in 2009, Uderzo's daughter, Sylvie, attacked her father's decision to sell the family publishing firm and the rights to produce new _Astérix_ adventures after his death. She said:

  ... the co-creator of _Astérix_, France's comic strip hero, has betrayed the Gaulish warrior to the modern-day Romans – the men of industry and finance.[14][15]

However, René Goscinny's daughter, Anne, also gave her agreement to the continuation of the series and sold her rights at the same time. She is reported to have said that "_Asterix_ has already had two lives: one during my father's lifetime and one after it. Why not a third?".[16] A few months later, Uderzo appointed three illustrators, who had been his assistants for many years, to continue the series.[17] In 2011, Uderzo announced that a new _Asterix_ album was due out in 2013, with Jean-Yves Ferri writing the story and Frédéric Mébarki drawing it.[18] A year later, in 2012, the publisher Albert-René announced that Frédéric Mébarki had withdrawn from drawing the new album, due to the pressure he felt in following in the steps of Uderzo. Comic artist Didier Conrad was officially announced to take over drawing duties from Mébarki, with the due date of the new album in 2013 unchanged.[19][20]

In January 2015, after the murders of seven cartoonists at the satirical Paris weekly _Charlie Hebdo_, _Astérix_ creator Albert Uderzo came out of retirement to draw two _Astérix_ pictures honouring the memories of the victims.[21]

_Asterix Conquers Rome_ is a comics adaptation of the animated film _The Twelve Tasks of Asterix_. It was released in 1976, and was the 23rd volume to be published, but it has been rarely reprinted and is not considered to be canonical to the series. The only English translations ever to be published were in the _Asterix Annual 1980_ and never an English standalone volume. A picture-book version of the same story was published in English translation as _The Twelve Tasks of Asterix_ by Hodder & Stoughton in 1978.

In 1996, a tribute album in honour of Albert Uderzo was released titled "Uderzo Croqué par ses Amis", a volume containing 21 short stories with Uderzo in Ancient Gaul. This volume was published by Soleil Productions and has not been translated into English

In 2007, Les Editions Albert René released a tribute volume titled _Astérix et ses Amis_, a 60-page volume of one-to-four-page short stories. It was a tribute to Albert Uderzo on his 80th birthday by 34 European cartoonists. The volume was translated into nine languages. , it has not been translated into English.[52]

In 2016, the French publisher Hachette, along with Anne Goscinny and Albert Uderzo decided to make the special issue album _The XII Tasks of Asterix_ for the 40th anniversary of the film _The Twelve Tasks of Asterix_. There was no English edition.


Synopsis and characters

The main setting for the series is an unnamed coastal village (rumoured to be inspired by Erquy) in Armorica (present-day Brittany), a province of Gaul (modern France), in the year 50 BC. Julius Caesar has conquered nearly all of Gaul for the Roman Empire. The little Armorican village, however, has held out because the villagers can gain temporary superhuman strength by drinking a magic potion brewed by the local village druid, Getafix. His chief is Vitalstatistix.

The main protagonist and hero of the village is Asterix, who, because of his shrewdness, is usually entrusted with the most important affairs of the village. He is aided in his adventures by his rather corpulent and slower thinking friend, Obelix, who, because he fell into the druid's cauldron of the potion as a baby, has permanent superhuman strength (because of this, Getafix steadily refuses to allow Obelix to drink the potion, as doing so would have a dangerous and unpredictable result). Obelix is usually accompanied by Dogmatix, his little dog. (Except for Asterix and Obelix, the names of the characters change with the language. For example, Obelix's dog's name is "Dogmatix" in English, but "Idéfix" in the original French edition.)

Asterix and Obelix (and sometimes other members of the village) go on various adventures both within the village and in far away lands. Places visited in the series include parts of Gaul (Lutetia, Corsica etc.), neighbouring nations (Belgium, Spain, Britain, Germany etc.), and far away lands (North America, Middle East, India etc.).

The series employs science-fiction and fantasy elements in the more recent books; for instance, the use of extraterrestrials in _Asterix and the Falling Sky_ and the city of Atlantis in _Asterix and Obelix All at Sea_.


Humour

The humour encountered in the _Asterix_ comics often centers around puns, caricatures, and tongue-in-cheek stereotypes of contemporary European nations and French regions. Much of the humour in the initial Asterix books was French-specific, which delayed the translation of the books into other languages for fear of losing the jokes and the spirit of the story. Some translations have actually added local humour: In the Italian translation, the Roman legionaries are made to speak in 20th-century Roman dialect, and Obelix's famous _Ils sont fous ces romains_ ("These Romans are crazy") is translated as _Sono pazzi questi romani_, humourously alluding to the Roman abbreviation _SPQR_. In another example: Hiccups are written onomatopoeically in French as _hips_, but in English as "hic", allowing Roman legionaries in more than one of the English translations to decline their hiccups absurdly in Latin (_hic, haec, hoc_). The newer albums share a more universal humour, both written and visual.[53]

Character names

All the fictional characters in _Asterix_ have names which are puns on their roles or personalities, and which follow certain patterns specific to nationality. Certain rules are followed (most of the time) such as Gauls (and their neighbours) having an "-ix" suffix for the men and ending in "-a" for the women; for example, Chief Vitalstatistix (so called due to his portly stature) and his wife Impedimenta (often at odds with the chief). The male Roman names end in "-us", echoing Latin nominitive male singular form, as in Gluteus Maximus, a muscle-bound athlete whose name is literally the butt of the joke. Gothic names (present-day Germany) end in "-ic", after Gothic chiefs such as Alaric and Theoderic; for example Rhetoric the interpreter. Greek names end in "-os" or "-es"; for example, Thermos the restaurateur. British names end in "-ax" and are often puns on the taxation associated with the later United Kingdom; examples include Valuaddedtax the druid, and Selectivemploymentax the mercenary. Other nationalities are treated to Pidgin translations from their language, like Huevos y Bacon, a Spanish chieftain (whose name, meaning eggs and bacon, is often guidebook Spanish for tourists), or literary and other popular media references, like Dubbelosix (a sly reference to James Bond's codename "007").

Most of these jokes, and hence the names of the characters, are specific to the translation; for example, the druid named Getafix in English translation is _Panoramix_ in the original French and _Miraculix_ in German.[54] Even so, occasionally the wordplay has been preserved: Obelix's dog, known in the original French as _Idéfix_ (from _idée fixe_, a "fixed idea" or obsession), is called _Dogmatix_ in English, which not only renders the original meaning strikingly closely ("dogmatic") but in fact adds another layer of wordplay with the syllable "Dog-" at the beginning of the name.

The name _Asterix_, French _Astérix_, comes from __, meaning "asterisk", which is the typographical symbol * indicating a footnote, from the Greek word αστήρ (_aster_), meaning a "star". His name is usually left unchanged in translations, aside from accents and the use of local alphabets. For example, in Esperanto, Polish, Slovene, Latvian, and Turkish it is _Asteriks_ (in Turkish he was first named _Bücür_ meaning "shorty", but the name was then standardised). Two exceptions include Icelandic, in which he is known as _Ástríkur_ ("Rich of love"), and Sinhala, where he is known as (_Soora Pappa_), which can be interpreted as "Hero".

For explanations of some of the other names, see List of _Asterix_ characters.

Ethnic stereotypes

Many of the _Asterix_ adventures take place in other countries away from their homeland in Gaul. In every album that takes place abroad, the characters meet (usually modern-day) stereotypes for each country, as seen by the French.

-   Italics (Italians) are the inhabitants of Italy. In the adventures of Asterix, the term "Romans" is used by non-Italics to refer to all inhabitants of Italy, who at that time had extended their dominion over a large part of the Mediterranean basin. But as can be seen in _Asterix and the Chariot Race_, in the Italic peninsula this term is used only to the people from the capital, with many Italics preferring to identify themselves as Umbrians, Etruscans, Venetians, etc. Various topics from this country are explored, as in this example, Italian gastronomy (pasta, pizza, wine), art, famous people (Pavarotti, Berlusconi, Mona Lisa), and even the controversial issue of political corruption.
-   Goths (Germans) are disciplined and militaristic, they are composed of many factions that fight amongst each other (which is a reference to Germany before Otto von Bismarck, and to East and West Germany after the Second World War), and they wear the _Pickelhaube_ helmet common during the German Empire.
-   Helvetians (Swiss) are neutral, eat fondue, and are obsessed with cleaning, accurate time-keeping, and banks.
-   The Britons (English) are phlegmatic, and speak with early 20th-century aristocratic slang (similar to Bertie Wooster). They stop for Tea every day (making it with hot water and a drop of milk until Asterix brings them actual tea leaves), drink lukewarm beer (Bitter), eat tasteless foods with mint sauce (Rosbif), and live in streets containing rows of identical houses.
-   Hibernians (Irish) are the inhabitants of Hibernia, the Latin name of Ireland. They fight against the Romans alongside the Britons to defend the British Isles.
-   Hispania (Spain) is overrun with tourists, the country where people of northern Europe go on vacation, ask to eat the same food they eat at their homelands, and cause tremendous traffic jams on the Roman roads. Other recurring topics are flamenco, bullfighting, and olive oil. Reference is also made to the famous literary character Don Quixote.
-   When the Gauls visited North America in _Asterix and the Great Crossing_, Obelix punches one of the attacking Native Americans with a knockout blow. The warrior first hallucinates American-style emblematic eagles; the second time, he sees stars in the formation of the Stars and Stripes; the third time, he sees stars shaped like the United States Air Force roundel. Asterix's inspired idea for getting the attention of a nearby Viking ship (which could take them back to Gaul) is to hold up a torch; this refers to the Statue of Liberty (which was a gift from France).
-   Corsicans are proud, patriotic, and easily aroused but lazy, making decisions by using pre-filled ballot boxes. They harbour vendettas against each other, and always take their siesta.
-   Greeks are chauvinists and consider Romans, Gauls, and all others to be barbarians. They eat stuffed grape leaves, drink retsina, and are hospitable to tourists. Most seem to be related by blood, and often suggest some cousin appropriate for a job.
-   Normans (Vikings) drink endlessly, they don't know what fear is (which they're trying to discover), and in their home territory (Scandinavia), the night lasts for 6 months.
-   Cimbres (Danes) are very similar to the Normans. But while Asterix and Obelix were unable to communicate with them, they are perfectly able to understand the Cimbres. Their names end in "-ten", perhaps similar to those of the Normans, whose names end in "-sen".
-   Belgians speak with a funny accent, snub the Gauls, and always eat sliced roots deep-fried in bear fat. They also tell Belgian jokes.
-   Lusitanians (Portuguese) are short in stature and polite (Uderzo said all the Portuguese who he had met were like that).
-   Sumerians, Assyrians, Hittites, Akkadians, and Babylonians are perpetually at war with each other and attack strangers because they confuse them with their enemies, but they later apologize when they realize that the strangers are not their enemies. This is likely a criticism of the constant conflicts among the Middle Eastern peoples.
-   The Jews are all depicted as Yemenite Jews, with dark skin, black eyes, and beards, a tribute to Marc Chagall, the famous painter whose painting of King David hangs at the Knesset (Israeli Parliament). Asterix's and Obelix's visit to Jerusalem is full of references to the Bible.
-   Numidians, contrary to the Berber inhabitants of ancient Numidia (located in North Africa), are obviously Africans from sub-Saharan Africa. The names end in "-tha", similar to the historical king Jugurtha of Numidia.
-   The Picts (Scots) wear typical dress with a kilt (skirt), have the habit of drinking "malt water" (whisky) and throwing logs (caber tossing) as a popular sport; their names all start with "Mac-".
-   Sarmatians (Russians), inhabitants of the North Black Sea area, represent present-day Russia. Their names end in "-ov", like many Russian surnames.

When the Gauls see foreigners speaking their foreign languages, these have different representation in the cartoon speech bubbles:

-   Iberian: Same as Spanish, with inversion of exclamation marks ('¡') and question marks ("¿")
-   Goth language: Gothic script (incomprehensible to the Gauls, except Getafix)
-   Viking (Normans and Cimbres): "Ø" and "Å" instead of "O" and "A" (incomprehensible to the Gauls)
-   Amerindian: Pictograms and sign language (generally incomprehensible to the Gauls)
-   Egyptians and Kushites: Hieroglyphics with explanatory footnotes (incomprehensible to the Gauls)
-   Greek: Straight letters, carved as if in stone
-   Sarmatian: In their speech balloons, some letters (E, F, N, R ...) are written in a mirror-reversed form, which evokes the modern Cyrillic alphabet.


Translations

The various volumes have been translated into more than 100 languages and dialects. Besides the original French language, most albums are available in Estonian, English, Czech, Dutch, German, Galician, Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Portuguese, Italian, modern Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Turkish, Slovene, Bulgarian, Serbian, Croatian, Latvian, Welsh,[55] as well as Latin.[56]

Selected albums have also been translated into languages such as Esperanto, Scottish Gaelic, Irish, Scots, Indonesian, Persian, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Bengali, Afrikaans, Arabic, Hindi, Hebrew, Frisian, Romansch, Vietnamese, Sinhala, Ancient Greek, and Luxembourgish.[57]

In France, Finland, and especially in Germany, several volumes were translated into a variety of regional languages and dialects, such as Alsatian, Breton, Chtimi (Picard), and Corsican in France; Bavarian, Swabian, and Low German in Germany; and Savo, Karelia, Rauma, and Helsinki slang dialects in Finland. Also, in Portugal, a special edition of the first volume, Asterix the Gaul, was translated into local language Mirandese.[58] In Greece, a number of volumes have appeared in the Cretan Greek, Cypriot Greek, and Pontic Greek dialects.[59] In the Italian version, while the Gauls speak standard Italian, the legionaries speak in the Romanesque dialect. In the former Yugoslavia, the "Forum" publishing house translated Corsican text in _Asterix in Corsica_ into the Montenegrin dialect of Serbo-Croatian (today called Montenegrin).

In the Netherlands, several volumes were translated into West Frisian, a Germanic language spoken in the province of Friesland; into Limburgish, a regional language spoken not only in Dutch Limburg but also in Belgian Limburg and North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany; and into Tweants, a dialect in the region of Twente in the eastern province of Overijssel. Hungarian-language books have been published in Yugoslavia for the Hungarian minority living in Serbia. Although not translated into a fully autonomous dialect, the books differ slightly from the language of the books issued in Hungary. In Sri Lanka, the cartoon series was adapted into Sinhala as _Sura Pappa_.[60]

Most volumes have been translated into Latin and Ancient Greek, with accompanying teachers' guides, as a way of teaching these ancient languages.

English translation

Before Asterix became famous, translations of some strips were published in British comics including _Valiant_, _Ranger_, and _Look & Learn_, under names _Little Fred and Big Ed_[61] and _Beric the Bold_, set in Roman-occupied Britain. These were included in an exhibition on Goscinny's life and career, and Asterix, in London's Jewish Museum in 2018.[62][63]

The translation of the books into English has been done by Derek Hockridge and Anthea Bell, and their English language rendition has been widely praised for maintaining the spirit and humour of the original French version. Derek Hockridge died in 2013 and Anthea Bell retired in 2016 for health reasons. Bell died in 2018.[64] Adriana Hunter is the present translator.

Influence in popular culture

s]]

-   The first French satellite, which was launched in 1965, was named _Astérix-1_ in honour of Asterix. Asteroids 29401 Asterix and 29402 Obelix were also named in honour of the characters. Coincidentally, the word Asterix/Asterisk originates from the Greek for _Little Star_.
-   During the campaign for Paris to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, Asterix appeared in many posters over the Eiffel Tower.
-   The French company Belin introduced a series of _Asterix_ crisps shaped in the forms of Roman shields, gourds, wild boar, and bones.
-   In the UK in 1995, _Asterix_ coins were presented free in every Nutella jar.
-   In 1991, Asterix and Obelix appeared on the cover of _Time_ for a special edition about France, art directed by Mirko Ilic. In a 2009 issue of the same magazine, Asterix is described as being seen by some as a symbol for France's independence and defiance of globalisation.[68] Despite this, Asterix has made several promotional appearances for fast food chain McDonald's, including one advertisement which featured members of the village enjoying the traditional story-ending feast at a McDonald's restaurant.[69]
-   Version 4.0 of the operating system OpenBSD features a parody of an Asterix story.[70]
-   _Action Comics_ Number 579, published by DC Comics in 1986, written by Lofficier and Illustrated by Keith Giffen, featured an homage to _Asterix_ where Superman and Jimmy Olsen are drawn back in time to a small village of indomitable Gauls.
-   In 2005, the Mirror World _Asterix_ exhibition was held in Brussels. The Belgian post office also released a set of stamps to coincide with the exhibition. A book was released to coincide with the exhibition, containing sections in French, Dutch and English.[71]
-   On 29 October 2009, the Google homepage of a great number of countries displayed a logo (called Google Doodle) commemorating 50 years of _Asterix_.[72]
-   Although they have since changed, the #2 and #3 heralds in the Society for Creative Anachronism's Kingdom of Ansteorra were the Asterisk and Obelisk Heralds.[73]
