ESKEBORNITE is a selenide mineral with the formula CuFeSe_(2.)[1][2] It crystallizes in the tetragonal system and it has a brassy colour. Eskebornite is sometimes found as thick tabular crystals, but is more often found intergrown with other selenides.[3] It is part of the chalcopyrite group and forms a series with chalcopyrite.[4]


Occurrence

Eskebornite was first identified in 1949 by Paul Ramdohr in the Eskaborn Adit, Tilkerode (Abberode), Harz, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany,[5] which it was also named after. It is often found with other selenides, including clausthalite, tiemannite, berzelianite, naumannite, umangite, geffroyite, and cham√©anite, but also with other minerals like chalcopyrite, uraninite, ankerite, and dolomite.[6]
