_DONNA MARIANNA_ (or _Donna Mariana_) was a vessel that left Liverpool in 1809. On 22 May 1810 seized _Donna Marianna_ for breach of the Act for the abolition of the slave trade. The Vice admiralty court at Freetown, Sierra Leone, condemned _Donna Mariana_ and her owners appealed the decision. The result of the appeal was a finding against the owners in a case that became an important milestone in the suppression of the slave trade.

The passage of the Act abolishing the slave trade does not mean that English vessels stopped trading slaves. A number of Liverpool merchants initially engaged in subterfuge, selling their vessels to nominal owners in other countries that had not yet abolished the trade. The case of _Donna Marianna_ established the precedent that British warships could detain, and British Vice admiralty courts could condemn, vessels under foreign flags, and their cargo, where British ownership could be proved.


Facts of the case

_Donna Marianna_ was the American vessel _Orion_,[1] which Samuel Macdowall & Co. of Liverpool purchased in 1809. They appointed a man named Vauralst as master, and sent her to Madeira with a cargo of culm. From Madeira she sailed to Pernambuco with a cargo of wine. There she was said to have been sold to a Portuguese merchant by the name of Da Silva.[2]

From Pernambuco _Donna Marianna_ sailed to Bahia under the Portuguese flag, carrying a cargo of wine of unspecified origin. From Bahia she sailed Cape Coast, having first taken on board "a variety of goods assorted for the Slave Trade". For this voyage she was under the command of Captain DaSouza,[3] though Vauralst continued on board as supercargo.

On 22 May 1809 _Crocodile_ seized _Donna Marianna_ for breach of the Act for the abolition of the slave trade and sent her into Sierra Leone. The Vice admiralty court at Sierra Leone condemned vessel and cargo on 6 July 1810, though there is no evidence that there were any slaves aboard her.[4]

Key evidence was the documents found in a passenger's trunk that showed that her fitting out for the slave trade had taken place at Liverpool.[5]


Judgement on appeal

The owners appealed, arguing that _Donna Marianna_ was a Portuguese vessel and that therefore she and her cargo were not subject to British Law.[6]

Judge William Scott presided over the appeal. On 3 June 1812 he ruled upholding the seizure of _Donna Marianna_ on the grounds that she was a "British vessel, and that this Portuguese disguise has been assumed for the mere purpose of protecting the property of British merchants in a traffic which it was not lawful for them to engage in."[7]

On 6 June 1812 Scott upheld the seizure of the cargo. He stated, "I consider the whole interest of the adventure to reside in the British merchants, and that De Silva is lending his name and agency to further a deception on British laws. I therefore see no reason the cargo should not follow the fate of the ship, with which it is involved in one common fraud."[8]


The captors' reward

In November 1814, the captain and crew _Crocodile_ received a moiety of the proceeds of the seizure. A first-class share of the distribution, that of _Crocodile_{{'}}s captain, was worth £443 17s 0d; a seaman's share was worth £1 15s 9d.[9]
