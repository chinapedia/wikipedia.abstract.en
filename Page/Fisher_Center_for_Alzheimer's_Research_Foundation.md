The FISHER CENTER FOR ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH FOUNDATION is a nonprofit American health organization that supports research into the causes and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.

Zachary Fisher, a builder and philanthropist in New York City, founded the organization in 1995 after his wife, Elizabeth Fisher, developed Alzheimer’s disease. He teamed with philanthropist David Rockefeller to establish the Zachary and Elizabeth M. Fisher Center for Research on Alzheimer’s Disease at Rockefeller University.[1] Since its founding, the Fisher Center laboratory has been led by Nobel Laureate Paul Greengard.[2][3]

The Foundation also publishes educational material for the public. Since 2007, the Foundation has published Preserving Your Memory magazine, a subscription-based publication for consumers.[4] Its “Keeping Your Mind Sharp” program, which has been translated from English into Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Hindi and Urdu, has been used to teach seniors about brain health.[5] In November, 2016, the Foundation published a children’s book, _Why Can’t Grandma Remember My Name?_[6] It was written by Kent Karosen, the president and CEO of the foundation, and Chana Stiefel.[7] The organization is supported by contributions from the public.[8][9]
