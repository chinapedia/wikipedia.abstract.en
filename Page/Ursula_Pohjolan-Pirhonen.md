URSULA KERTTU MARGARETA POHJOLAN-PIRHONEN (6 April 1925 Helsinki â€“ 17 July 1984 Sulkava) was a Finnish author of mainly romantic historical novels.[1]

She is considered one of the founders of historical entertainment in Finnish literature, alongside of Kaari Utrio. She describes the flow of events and what happens to her protagonist in a reliable and historically accurate manner. The characters of her books let things happen to themselves, without trying to interfere or change the history.[2]
