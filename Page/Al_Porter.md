Career

Acting

Porter has been acting since he was 10 years old, and has been the headline attraction in the annual Christmas Pantomime in the Olympia Theatre in Dublin since he was in his early 20s.

Comedy

By the time he was 22 he was also able to sell out Dublin comedy venue Vicar Street for 3 nights as the headline act.

In August 2016, while performing at the Edinburgh Festival he was mistakenly described as a "former panto star" by The Guardian. Despite that error The Guardian conceded "the sheer thrill, frankly, of encountering such a steamroller crowd-pleasing talent."[1] the same routine was described by The London Standard as "superslick stand-up".[2]

Radio host

In 2017, it was announced that Porter would be joining Today FM and taking over the 12pm-2:30pm slot previously held by Dermot and Dave with Porter's show debuting on Monday 13 February 2017.

Television presenting

On 8 October 2017, Porter presented the new series of _Blind Date_ on TV3.[3]


Sexual misconduct allegations

In July 2017, Porter revealed on a podcast that he had been accused of sexual assault by three male classmates in secondary school.[4] On 18 November 2017 the Metro and the Irish edition of The Times reported that Porter has been subject to four allegations from people within the comedy industry of sexual misconduct.[5][6] On the same day his radio employer Today FM released a statement saying that they had spoken with Porter and his management team concerning the allegations.[7]

Later that day a spokesperson for Porter said he has agreed to "take some personal time from his lunchtime radio show."[8]

The following day Porter revealed that he resigned from Today FM, with immediate effect, and that he was "completely taken aback by reports in the media". He also expressed his gratitude to Today FM, the Olympia Panto and TV3 for granting him “the space and time” to deal with the situation.[9]

Porter was accused of sexually assaulting a patient at St Patrick's University Hospital during an October 2015 visit, though two investigations revealed no evidence of sexual assault, Porter released a statement expressing that he was pleased with the findings.[10] The gardaí are also investigating an alleged sexual assault against a male in his late teens in 2016.[11]
