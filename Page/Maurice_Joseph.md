MAURICE JOSEPH (born August 26, 1985) is a former Canadian basketball player and coach. He is the former head coach of the George Washington University Colonials men's basketball team.[1]


Playing career

After a standout prep career at Champlain-St. Lambert in his native Montreal, Joseph committed to play basketball at Michigan State under Tom Izzo. Joseph appeared in 52 games and was a part of two NCAA Tournament squads for the Spartans over a two-year period, averaging 3.8 points per game before transferring to Vermont, closer to his Montreal home. In two seasons with the Catamounts, Joseph was the team's second-leading scorer with 13.9 points per game, helping Vermont to its fourth NCAA Tournament appearance in 2010.[2]

Upon graduation, Joseph played professional basketball in Israel with Hapoel Afula B.C., while also representing the home nation of his parents, Trinidad and Tobago, playing on its national basketball team in 2010.[3]


Coaching career

In 2011, Joseph joined his former coach at Vermont, Mike Lonergan, on his staff at George Washington, rising from director of basketball operations to assistant coach. In 2017, he was elevated to the interim head coaching position after Lonergan was fired by the school amid reports of verbal player abuse and misconduct.[4] Joseph was confirmed to the head coach position on March 27, 2017, with a 5-year deal with the university.[5] Joseph was one of four Canadian-born NCAA Division I men's basketball head coaches all-time, joining James Naismith, Pete Newell, and Paul Weir. On March 15, 2019 Joseph was fired from George Washington, amassing a 44â€“57 overall record.[6]
