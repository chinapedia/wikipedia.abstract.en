Biography

Warsi worked in Rohtas Group of Industries as a manual worker, and became an activist for Indian Independence in 1938.[2] In 1942, he participated in the Quit India Movement and was imprisoned, where he met socialist leaders Jayaprakash Narayan and Ram Manohar Lohia.[3] He joined Subash Chandra Bose's Indian National Army in 1943.[4]

Socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia had named Warsi as Gandhi of Piro (_Piro ke Gandhi_) in 1956, for his strong socialist views.[5][6]

He was elected an MLA from Piro (now named Tarari) constituency on a ticket from Samyukta Socialist Party in 1969.[7][8] He represented the constituency in Bihar Legislative Assembly till 1972.[9]

He left politics in 1972, but continued speaking for the marginalized and the poor.[10]

Warsi was well known for his austere living and uncompromising principles and ideals. He didn't contest elections after 1969, finding the political system dishonest.[11]

He refused to accept the pension he was sanctioned, as an MLA or as a freedom fighter.[12][13] He said -

  “Accepting pension for trying to liberate one’s home is a sin. And taking pension for serving people, as their elected representative, is a bigger sin,”[14]

Warsi lived his last few years in a run-down home in Rohtas,[15][16] refused offers to contest more elections. His family had difficulty in making ends meet.[17][18]


Death

Warsi died in Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Science (IGIMS), Patna at the age of 94 years on 10 October 2016.[19][20]

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, in his tribute said Warsi's "contribution in promoting socialist movement in Bihar would never be forgotten."[21]
