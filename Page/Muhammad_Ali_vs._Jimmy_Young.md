Muhammad Ali and Jimmy Young fought a boxing match on April 30, 1976. Ali won the bout through a unanimous decision on points. This bout was aired live in primetime on ABC with Howard Cosell calling the action from the Capitol Centre in Landover, Maryland.

Prior to the bout, Muhammad Ali's trainer Angelo Dundee put up a message board to Ali saying "Remember San Diego" That was when Ali overweight lost a 12-round split decision to Ken Norton on March 31, 1973 in that city, knowing just before this bout Ali trained lightly and overweight, thankfully no repeat this time around.

Ali came into the bout at 230 pounds, the heaviest he's ever been for any fight until 1981 when he weighted 236 pounds in a bout with Trevor Berbick.

During the bout on six occasions, Young ducked outside of the ropes when he was pressured by Ali. He did it in the seventh round, the eighth, the 12th, twice in the 13th and once more in the 15th. When he did it in the 12th round, the referee ruled it a knockdown and began to count. Young pulled his head back into the ring at the count of two.
