GLORANTHA is a fantasy world created by Greg Stafford. It was first introduced in the board game _White Bear and Red Moon_ (1975) by Chaosium, and thereafter in a number of other board, roleplaying and computer games, including _RuneQuest_ and _HeroQuest_, as well as several works of fiction and the computer strategy game _King of Dragon Pass_. The Gloranthan world is characterised by its complex use of mythology, heavily influenced by the universalist approaches of Joseph Campbell and Mircea Eliade, its Howardian ethos, its long and distinctive history as a setting for role-playing games, its community development and expansion, and (unusual among early American fantasy role-playing games) its relative lack of Tolkienesque influence.

Stafford began imagining Glorantha in 1966 as a way to deepen his own understanding of mythology. He founded the company Chaosium to publish the board wargame _White Bear and Red Moon_ in 1974 (other sources say 1975), which was set in Glorantha. Chaosium later published other games in the setting, including the critically acclaimed _RuneQuest_. Various later editions of _RuneQuest_, the narrative role-playing game _HeroQuest_ (the first edition of which was published as _Hero Wars_), and the video game _King of Dragon Pass_ were also set in Glorantha, as were several prominent fan efforts. Stafford has also explored the Gloranthan setting in the fantasy novel _King of Sartar_[1] and a number of unfinished works published under the collective name of "the Stafford Library".

In Glorantha, magic operates from the everyday level of prayers and charms to the creation and maintenance of the world. Heroes make their way in the world, and may also venture into metaphysical realms to gain knowledge and power, at the risk of body and soul. In the more recent material competing magical outlooks, such as theism, shamanism and mysticism, exist to explain the world. Within each metaphysical system, adherents may also compete - such as when theistic worshipers of rival gods battle each other. The world is flat, with a dome-like sky, and it has been shaped in large and small ways by the mythic actions of the gods. The 'historical' world of Glorantha is in a more or less fallen state, having recovered only partially from a universal battle against Chaos in the mythic Godtime.

Humans are the dominant race, but other sentient beings abound. Some, such as the mystic dragonewts, are unique to Glorantha. Familiar nonhuman races, such as elves and dwarves, are distinct from their common, Tolkienesque portrayals.


Multimedia Glorantha

Glorantha has been; the background for two board-games (_White Bear and Red Moon_/_Dragon Pass_ and _Nomad Gods_), two role-playing games (_RuneQuest_ and _HeroQuest_), one video game (_King of Dragon Pass_), one comic book series (_Path of the Damned_), five novels or collections of fiction (_King of Sartar_ by _Greg Stafford_, _The Collected/Complete Griselda_ by Oliver Dickinson, _Gloranthan Visions_ by various authors, and _The Widow's Tale_ and _Eurhol's Vale & Other Tales_ by Penelope Love), and numerous pieces of myth and fiction created by the Glorantha community, featuring in magazines such as _Tales of the Reaching Moon_. Several hundred gaming miniatures by various licensees and about a dozen plush toys have also been produced at various times.


History of the Gloranthan game world

Origin and board games (1960s - 70s)

Glorantha's origins lie in experiments with mythology, storytelling, and recreation and blending of ancient societies, unlike its contemporary, _Dungeons & Dragons_ which has its roots in wargaming.

Stafford's first imaginings of Glorantha date back to 1966, when he began his studies at Beloit College, as a vehicle for him to deepen his own understanding of mythology by creating his own mythology. Stafford was greatly influenced by the ideas on mythology of Joseph Campbell, and echoes of Campbell's work are to be found in many aspects of Glorantha; for instance the story of the "God Learners" can be seen as an exercise on the implications of Campbell's idea of a unifying monomyth, and the story of Prince Argrath an exploration of Campbell's _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_ (1949). More abstractly, Campbell's idea that myths are how we shape our lives deeply informs the picture of life in Glorantha throughout the game world's publication history.

The first game system set in Glorantha was the board game _White Bear and Red Moon_. Stafford first tried to sell the game to established publishers, but despite being accepted by three different game companies, each attempt ended in failure; eventually he founded his own game company in 1974, the influential Chaosium, to publish his game. The game detailed the rise of the barbarian Prince Argrath to defend his homeland of Sartar against the red tide of the civilized Lunar Empire, and filled out the area of _Dragon Pass_; the game has undergone several reissues since that time.

The next publication was also a board game, _Nomad Gods_, published by Chaosium in 1978, which detailed the raids and wars between the beast-riding spirit-worshiping tribes of Prax, a cursed land to the east of Dragon Pass. A French language edition was published by Oriflam under license from Chaosium under the name _Les Dieux Nomades_ in 1994.

Role-playing games (late 1970s -)

The first edition of the role-playing game _RuneQuest_ was released in 1978. On the back cover of this edition, the game world was called "_Glorontha_" (sic). Several later editions were made; the second edition ("RuneQuest 2") in 1979 introduced many sophisticated game aids, such as _Cults of Prax_ and _Cults of Terror_, and highly polished campaign packs, such as _Griffin Mountain_. Using materials such as _Cults of Prax_, players aligned their characters with any of several distinct religions, grounding those characters in the political, cultural, and metaphysical conflicts of Glorantha. Each religion offered a distinct worldview and cultural outlook, none of which are objectively correct. This approach of offering competing mythical histories and value systems continues in current Glorantha material. _Cults of Terror_ focused on the worship of evil gods and adversaries, such as Vivamort, a vampire cult, and Lunar and Chaos cults.

In an attempt to leverage the power of a much bigger gaming company, a third edition, _RuneQuest 3_, was published with Avalon Hill in 1984. This edition both loosened the connection between _RuneQuest_ and Glorantha, introducing 'Fantasy Europe' as the principal game world for _RuneQuest_, and much broadened the scope of Glorantha, which was treated as an alternative game world. Unfortunately, _RuneQuest_ did not prosper with its association with Avalon Hill, and the relationship between Chaosium, who held the rights to Glorantha, and Avalon Hill, who held the rights to _RuneQuest_, finally broke down completely in 1995. A draft of the _RuneQuest 4_ rules, called _RuneQuest:Slayers_, was written but never published. It has since been renamed _RuneSlayers_ and released as a free download; it is not set in Glorantha.

During this period of breakdown, Glorantha continued to evolve. The advent of popular use of the internet caused a boom in fan creations in Glorantha, supported by some unofficial business ventures, such as Reaching Moon Megacorp, and a lively convention scene. Loren Miller proposed his Maximum Game Fun principle as a basis for gaming, which soon became a game system in its own right, David Dunham proposed his _PenDragon Pass_ system, a nearly freeform game system, and several ambitious freeform games were played at conventions, such as _Home of the Bold_ with up to eighty participants. The video game _King of Dragon Pass_ was released by A Sharp, allowing the player to play an Orlanthi hero who seeks to unite the clans and tribes of Dragon Pass in a kingdom; the game features exceptional depth of coverage of the area of Dragon Pass, and featured the first compelling public view of Stafford's ideas about the hero quest. Also Stafford was at this time publishing material about the history and mythology of Glorantha in non-game form as books such as _King of Sartar_ and _The Glorious (Re)Ascent of Yelm_.

Recent years (2000s -)

In recent years, Gloranthan gaming has been supported by two lines of game systems: the _Hero Wars_/_HeroQuest_ game system, originally published by Issaries, Inc. in 2000 and now available from Moon Design Publications, and _RuneQuest_, originally published by Mongoose Publishing in 2006 and now available from The Design Mechanism.

The _HeroQuest_ game system, written by Robin Laws in collaboration with Greg Stafford, is radically different from _RuneQuest_ in that it emphasises narrativist aspects of role-playing; in contrast, _RuneQuest_ emphasised simulationist aspects. Because of this change in approach some _RuneQuest_ fans found it difficult to adjust to _HeroQuest_. However, other long-term fans felt that the game fit Glorantha far better than _RuneQuest_. A rewritten second edition was published in Spring 2009 by Moon Design Publications, and is being supported with comprehensive Gloranthan sourcebooks: _Sartar: Kingdom of Heroes_ (2009), _Sartar Companion_ (2010) and _Pavis: Gateway to Adventure_ (2012).

The _RuneQuest_ game system was licensed to Mongoose Publishing by Issaries, allowing Mongoose to publish material concerning the little-explored Second Age of Gloranthan history. Their new fourth edition (_Mongoose RuneQuest_ / MRQ) debuted in August 2006, with many Gloranthan supplements following. A fifth edition (_Mongoose RuneQuest II_ / MRQ2) was published in January 2010, but Mongoose Publishing's licence for Gloranthan material lapsed in May 2011. The _RuneQuest II_ game system has been retitled "Legend", and contains no Gloranthan material. A new company, The Design Mechanism, was formed by the authors of _RuneQuest II_, and ownership of the Gloranthan supplements produced for the "RuneQuest II" line was transferred to them (PDF versions continue to be sold). There are close links between The Design Mechanism and Moon Design Publications, with The Design Mechanism founders writing material for both companies. A new sixth edition of the RuneQuest rules, _RuneQuest 6_ (RQ6), was published in August 2012, but no Gloranthan material has yet been published.

Latest publication is RuneQuest Roleplaying in Glorantha, published 21 st of september 2018. For a first time the rulebook is written completely in the Glorantha and the rulebook works as basic encyclopedia about the Glorantha. There is already couple new PDF publications to support the rules set and the rules are close enough to RuneQuest second edition to be used with the older material.


The World of Glorantha

There are a variety of cultures in Glorantha that have strikingly different perceptions of their world, the magic that pervades it and the major events that have shaped it.

The Glorantha website[2] introduces Glorantha as:

  "Glorantha is an action-packed world of adventure. Gods and Goddesses struggle here, with nations of people nothing but their pawns. The stormy barbarians with their brutal but honest Storm God struggle against the Lunar Empire, led by the imperial Sun God and devious Moon Goddess.
  Glorantha is an exciting world of heroes. Legends are being made by great individuals, many who are not even human beings. Some work with the deities, other heroes and heroines fight against them.
  Glorantha is colorful and full of magic. Supernatural animals are found, ranging from unicorns to seven types of merfolk and the Goddess of Lions.
  Glorantha is immense. If explored, it has different worlds and dimensions, whole realms where Gods, spirits and sorcerous powers come from. Unlike many fantasy settings, Glorantha emphasises religion, myth and belief to a level rarely seen in role-playing or fantasy fiction elsewhere.
  Glorantha shares some fantasy tropes such as dwarves, elves, trolls, giants, but has developed them differently to the more conventional versions based on the work of Tolkien. Dwarves are literally made of stone and exist as manifest rigid inflexible laws of creation, while elves are intelligent, mobile plants. Glorantha is full of surprises.
  Glorantha is as deep as you want it to be, or not. Hackers and choppers have what they want, while scholars and mythologists have a vast playground of new stories, legends and myths to enjoy."

The world of Glorantha has various cultures analogous to Earth spread over two major landmasses and a widespread archipelago. The northern continent of Genertela has a caste society of roughly Vedic type to the west, an autocratic Oriental society to the east and a classical style Bronze Age culture in the center. The southern continent of Pamaltela is somewhat like Africa, but with many differences.


Specifically Gloranthan creatures

BROOS are creatures of chaos. As a result of their ability to mate with anything, they have the body of a man and features of their animal parent, often deer, goats, antelope, cattle, and sheep. The animal parent normally dies with the child eating its way out of the host at full gestation. They worship Malia, the Mother of Disease, and Thed, the goddess of rape and mother of Chaos.[3]

SCORPIONMEN are belligerent folk, who look like a sort of scorpion-human centaur. They are described as stupid, vicious and live in violent matriarchies with a religious emphasis on devouring. They are chaotic in nature.

DUCKS or _Durulz_ are large intelligent ducks with arms instead of wings (or men cursed with feathers and webbed feet, depending on your point of view). They reside around rivers, mainly in Sartar, and have an unexplained mystical affinity with Death.

ALDRYAMI are Gloranthan plantmen, nature and sun worshipping—mainly worshipping Aldrya, deity of plants. Unlike Tolkienesque elves, they are alien, physically plant-like and often hostile to normal humans ("meat men'"). Like many other fictional elf races, they are excellent archers.

MOSTALI are a machine-like dwarf race, extremely xenophobic, orthodox and insular. Inventors of iron, which has many extraordinary magical properties in Glorantha, contrasting to the primary metal used bronze.

UZ, the trolls, are the race of darkness, large, intelligent, astoundingly omnivorous, with a very developed sonar-like sense (_darksense_). Their societies are matriarchal, and they worship, among others, a goddess of darkness called Kyger Litor, mother of the Trolls, and the more violent and sinister Zorak Zoran.

DRAGONEWTS are a magical race who comprise several forms of neotenic dragons, engaged in a cycle of self-improving reincarnation. They are extremely alien with an incomprehensible mindset. They must have oral surgery in order to speak human languages.
