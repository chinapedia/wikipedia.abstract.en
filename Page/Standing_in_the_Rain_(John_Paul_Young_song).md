"STANDING IN THE RAIN" is a disco song recorded by Australian pop singer John Paul Young. It was released in Europe in February 1977 and in Australia in December 1977 as the third and final single from Young's third studio album, _J.P.Y._ (1976). The song was written by George Young and Harry Vanda.

The song peaked at number 12 on the Kent Music Report in Australia, remaining on the chart for 27 weeks. In Europe it reached No. 2 in Belgium, No. 3 in the Netherlands, No. 4 in Germany and No. 11 in Austria.


Background

"Keep on Smilin'" was sent to Europe in 1977 to be released as the second single by John Paul Young from the _J.P.Y._ album as it was in Australia. German disc jockeys preferred the B-side, "Standing in the Rain", and flipped the single. The result was a charting success across Europe: the song reached No. 2 in Belgium, No. 3 in Netherlands, No. 4 in Germany and No. 11 in Austria. "Standing in the Rain" was released as the A-side in Australia in December 1977. It peaked at number 12 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart.[1]

In an interview with Drum Media in 2009, Young explains “We'd sent over a song called "Keep On Smilin'" and "Standing in the Rain" was on the B-side. There was a guy working for [record label] Ariola, who didn't like "Keep On Smilin'" at all and turned it over and thought this might have something. He decided to sidestep the radio stations and went straight to a DJ friend in a club and it got played and it just bled from there into the charts and stayed in the charts for forty-something weeks.”[2]

In 1987, Young issued _The Golden Dance-Floor Hits Vol. 10_, a three-track extended play on German label ZYX Records.[3] The album is a part of _The Golden Dance-Floor Hits_ series. It provided two extended remix versions of "Standing in the Rain".[4][5]
