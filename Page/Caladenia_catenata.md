_CALADENIA CATENATA_, commonly known as WHITE CALADENIA, WHITE FINGERS and LADY'S FINGERS, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and one or two white, sometimes pink flowers on a thin, sparsely-hairy stem. It is similar to _Caladenia carnea_ but lacks the red and white bars on the labellum of that species.


Description

_Caladenia catenata_ is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single, sparsely hairy, linear leaf, long and wide.[1][2]

There are one or two flowers borne on a slender, sparsely hairy spike high. The sepals and petals are glistening white, rarely pink and are sparsely hairy on the lower part of their backs. The dorsal sepal is linear to oblong, erect or slightly curved forward and is long. The lateral sepals and petals are about the same length as the dorsal sepal and spreading. The labellum is white or pinkish with a yellowy-orange tip. It is long, wide when flattened and has three lobes. The central lobe is triangle-shaped, longer than the lateral lobes, curves downward and has finger-like teeth on its edges. The lateral lobes are narrow and may have a few teeth near their tips. There are two rows of yellow or white, club-shaped calli on the centre of the mid-lobe but only as far forward as the front of the lateral lobes. Flowering occurs from August to November, earlier in New South Wales than Victoria.[3][4]

This caladenia is similar to _C. carnea_ but differs from it in not having red and white bars on the labellum. In some places, hybrids between the two species occur.[5]


Taxonomy and naming

The first formal description of this orchid was by James Edward Smith in 1805, who gave it the name _Arethusa catenata_ and published the description in his book, _Exotic Botany_.[6][7] In 1917, George Druce changed the name to _Caladenia catenata_ and published the change in _The Botanical Exchange Club and Society of the British Isles Report for 1916, Supplement 2_.[8] The specific epithet (catenata) is a Latin word meaning "chained".[9] In his description, Smith referred to the labellum as having "chain-like glands".[10]


Distribution and habitat

This caladenia is uncommon in Victoria where it grows in scattered populations in forest and woodland east of Melbourne.[11] It is more common in New South Wales where it usually grows in sandy soil in coastal forest and shrubland.[12] It is probably the most common _Caladenia_ in the Sydney region.[13]
