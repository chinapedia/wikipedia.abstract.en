SICKLES TAVERN, also known as HICKORY INN, is a historic inn and tavern located near Wayland, Clark County, Missouri. It was built about 1846, and is a two-story, rectangular, vernacular frame dwelling with full basement and attic. It is an example of a "two-thirds house" - a two-story structure one room wide and two rooms deep, with an end hallway. During the 19th century, it is believed that the house was a tavern and stopping place for the mail and passenger coaches passing from Iowa into Kansas and beyond.[1]

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.[2]
