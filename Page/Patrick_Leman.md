Career

Research

Leman has published many papers in developmental and social psychology, often from an experimental perspective, across areas including communication, gender, ethnicity and race, decision-making and learning applied to child development.[2] His early work on peer conversation with Gerard Duveen[3] developed new methods for understanding children's co-construction of knowledge that has subsequently become a core area of research in European developmental psychology.[4]

He has also examined the role of gender in children's learning and, more recently, focused on issues of ethnicity and race in classroom contexts.[5] Leman's work fuses social, developmental, cognitive and cultural psychology.[6] More recent applied research has developed these theoretical ideas in classroom contexts to promote positive youth development including setting up, with colleagues, the White Water Writers charity.[7]

Other work

Together with colleagues Drs Joe Reddington and Yvonne Skipper, Leman is director of White Water Writers, a not-for-profit organisation that allows young people to write an original novel, collaboratively, in a week. The project has received funding from the Ernest Cook Trust and SHINE Foundation. He has also worked with the Laureus Foundation to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of sport-related interventions projects across the globe. He is a member of the Advisory Board of the Dame Alice Owen Foundation and an active member of the British Psychological Society and many other academic bodies.

Leman is Editor of the British Journal of Developmental Psychology[8] and co-author, with Professor Andrew Bremner, of the popular text book "Developmental Psychology."[9]
