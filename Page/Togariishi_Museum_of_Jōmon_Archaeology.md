The Togariishi stone age ruins

The is an archaeological site containing the ruins of a large scale Jōmon period settlement located in what is now part of the city of Chino, Nagano. It was one of the first Jōmon period settlements found in Japan. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1942 and a Special National Historic Site in 1952.[4] Despite the designation “Stone Age” in its name, the site has no connection with the Japanese Paleolithic period.

The site is located in the Toyohira neighborhood of Chino, at the foot of Mount Yatsugatake at an altitude of 1000 meters. Over 50 mid-Jōmon period ruins are located in the foot of the Yatsugatake mountain area near the center of Nagano prefecture because of abundant spring water. Although the ruins were known since the Meiji period, they were first excavated by the archaeologist Hidekazu Miyasaka in 1929. At that time, the foundation of 33 pit dwellings arranged in a U-shape around a central plaza were discovered, along with numerous artifacts, including earthenware, stoneware, jewelry and obsidian tools. This was the first confirmed example of a Jōmon period settlement found, and was thus the forerunner of the study of that period of Japanese history. Further postwar excavations have revealed that the site contains at least 220 residence sites, making it the largest settlement in the vicinity of Mount Yatsugatake. The area covered by the Special Historical Site designation was expanded in 1993.
