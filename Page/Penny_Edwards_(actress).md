PENNY EDWARDS (August 24, 1928 – August 26, 1998) was an American actress who performed on stage, in films, and on television.


Early years

She was born MILLICENT MAXINE EDWARDS in Jackson Heights, Queens,[1] New York.[2] After moving to Florida, she graduated from Miami Edison High School.[3]


Career

When she was twelve years old, Edwards danced in _Let's Face It_,[4] and at the age of fourteen, she appeared on Broadway as a dancer in _Zigfeld Follies of 1943_. Her other Broadway credits include _Laffing Room Only_ (1944), and _The Duchess Misbehaves_ (1946).[5]

Edwards' film debut came in _My Wild Irish Rose_ (1947).[6] She also appeared in the films _Trail of Robin Hood_, _Spoilers of the Plains_, _Heart of the Rockies_, _In Old Amarillo_, _North of the Great Divide_, _Sunset in the West_, _Street Bandits_ and _Missing Women_, among others.

In the late 1940s, Edwards toured the United States for fourteen months, performing in vaudeville.[7]

Public response to Edwards' appearance with Roy Rogers in _Sunset in the West_ (1950) led to her receiving a long-term contract with Republic Pictures.[8]

In the 1950s, Edwards appeared on television in westerns and mystery programs.[9] Edwards appeared as Nan Gable in the 1958 episode, "Two-Gun Nan," on the syndicated television anthology series, _Death Valley Days_. In the story line, Nan is a woman sharpshooter affiliated with William F. Cody's Wild West Show. She sets out on a daring 180-day thoroughbred horse ride from San Francisco to New York City to prove that a woman could undertake such a task. Robert "Buzz" Henry (1931–1971) played her husband, Frank Gable, and William O'Neal (1898–1961) was cast as Cody. Still living in 1958, Nan Gable appeared with series host Stanley Andrews at the conclusion of the episode.[10]

In 1954, Edwards announced her retirement from acting "to do the Lord's work in whatever way He wills."[11]


Personal life

Edwards was divorced from Ralph H. Winters and Jerry Friedman.[12]


Death

Edwards died of lung cancer on August 26, 1998, in Friendswood, Texas, at the age of seventy.[13][14]
