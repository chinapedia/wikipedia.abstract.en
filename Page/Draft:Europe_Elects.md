Europe Elects

EUROPE ELECTS is a project, founded in 2014 by Tobias Gerhard Schminke, which is since 2018 supported by the _Verein zur Förderung des paneuropäischen politischen Diskurses und der Informationen zur Wahlen und Wahlumfragen_ (English: _Association for the support of paneuropean political discourse and information concerning elections and surveys_) which collects and publishes information concerning opinion polls in European countries with the intention to publish them to the European public.


Profile

It is the main idea of this project to show the different national party systems and ways to vote to the European public in an understandable matter. Europe Elects uses standardized labels and colours for national parties presented in polls. The publications regularly point out the affiliation of national parties with their respective European Parliament groups, which has been adopted by other media outlets over time. Furthermore, overviews of the positions of the single parties and candidates are being provided.

Europe Elects publishes on the basis of the collected data a European projection for the European Parliament on a regular basis and shows how it would look like if there were elections on this specific day. At the 2019 European Parliament election Europe Elects had the most precise forecast for the European Parliament.


Spread and perception

Europe Elects cooperates with the transnational TV-Station Euronews. It is along the most influential media in the European Parliament.[1][2]
