Controversies

The gubernatorial race was particularly controversial during the 2018 elections, as Republican candidate Brian Kemp was also the Georgia Secretary of State, a position which involves overseeing the electoral process, leading to allegations of conflicts of interests.[45][46][47] Despite calls from Georgia Democrats, organizations such as the NAACP[48] and Common Cause,[49] and former president Jimmy Carter,[50] Kemp did not relinquish the position until after the election.[51]

Accusations were also leveled at Kemp with regards to the purging of voter rolls that was done under his oversight. Removing names from voter rolls is a common practice in the case of voters who are deceased or have moved out of state,[52] but since 2017, the practice has spiked in Georgia.[53] Due to strict voting rules in Georgia, tens of thousands of citizens lost their right to vote because of otherwise trivial issues, such as small differences between pieces of identification or insufficiently similar signatures.[54] Kemp was accused of using the voter roll purge as a tactic to disenfranchise more than half a million people, predominantly African-Americans,[55] which has been likened to voter suppression.[56][57]
