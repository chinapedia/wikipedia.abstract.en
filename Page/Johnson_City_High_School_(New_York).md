After facing flooding in 2006 and again in 2011, the Johnson City High School football field located at Greensfield (aka Northside Park) was left in a dilapidated state, as the 8 feet of standing water heavily ruined the bleachers, scoreboard, concession stand, restrooms, and team rooms. The varsity football team played their home games at Binghamton High School's Alumni Stadium from 2011â€“2013. The school district was allocated disaster relief funds courtesy of FEMA, and after a district wide budget election a new stadium on campus was approved and constructed. The grand opening of the new 'Wildcat Stadium' was held in 2014 which was ultimately fitted with bleachers, restrooms, a concession stand, and team rooms.
