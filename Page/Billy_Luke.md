Personal life

On 28 October 1915, over a year into the First World War, Luke enlisted in the Royal Field Artillery.[3] He was deployed to the Western Front during the Battle of the Somme and participated in the battle's closing action on the Ancre in November 1916.[4] Luke's unit moved to trench lines east of Arras in April 1917 and he was seriously wounded in the leg on 9 April, eventually being discharged from the army in August 1918.[5] In the aftermath of his wounding, Luke was recommended for the Military Medal and the award was gazetted on 18 July 1917.[6] At the time of his death in January 1992, Luke was the oldest-living former professional footballer in Britain.[7]
