SCOTT L. POMEROY is the Bronson Crothers Professor of Neurology and Director of the Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center of Harvard Medical School, Chairman of the Department of Neurology and Neurologist-in-Chief of Boston Children's Hospital, and an Associate Member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.


Education

Pomeroy graduated from Wyoming High School in Ohio in 1971, received a B.A. in 1975 from Miami University, M.D. / Ph.D. degrees in 1982 from the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and completed residencies in Pediatrics and Child Neurology respectively at Boston Children's Hospital and Washington University St. Louis and St. Louis Children's Hospital.


Research

His research was the first to apply genomic tools (such as DNA microarrays) to understand the neurodevelopmental origins and molecular mechanisms of childhood brain tumors, especially medulloblastomas, providing the basis for the current classification of these tumors.[1][2][3] This, in turn, led to targeted therapies for brain tumors based upon their more fundamental biology rather than their microscopic appearance. In addition, he has contributed to understanding the neurological outcomes of survivors of nervous system infections and cancer.[4][5]

He also serves as the child neurology editor of the textbook _Neurology in Clinical Practice_ , one of the leading texts in the field, and of the nervous system volumes of the _Netter Collection of Medical Illustrations_.[6][7]
