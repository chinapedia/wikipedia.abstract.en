KERRI ANDERSON is a Canadian pop and rock singer, most prominent in the early 1990s.[1] She is most noted for garnering a Juno Award nomination for Most Promising Female Vocalist at the Juno Awards of 1992.[2]

Born and raised in Edmonton, Alberta, Anderson played piano in her youth and played briefly with a local band called Wages of Sin[3] before recording a number of demo songs.[4] The songs garnered her airplay on 96 K-Lite in the city, and the station recorded one of her subsequent live shows for broadcast;[5] the recording in turn led to her becoming the first artist signed to Randy Nicklaus' Impact Records.[6]

Impact released Anderson's album _Labyrinth_ in 1991.[7] However, by 1992 Impact Records was being taken over by MCA Records, and _Labyrinth_ got lost in the shuffle.[8] Left without a record label, Anderson battled clinical depression for several months before reemerging as a performer on Edmonton's local music scene again.[9]
