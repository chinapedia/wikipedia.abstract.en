Political views and accomplishments

Education

In 2018, Swan proposed house bill HB1665 to allow high schools to temporarily hire professionals without an education degree but with a bachelors degree in their subject area. Under this new visiting scholars program, a teacher can be hired for one year, with an option to renew for two more years. With only three no votes in the house and one no vote in the senate, the new law was signed by governor Eric Greitens on June 1, 2018.[6][7]

Families and children

Swan is a member of Leading Women for Shared Parenting,[8] and in 2018, Swan proposed house bill HB1667 to established a rebuttable legal presumption of shared parenting after divorce or separation.[9][10] Scientific research has shown that children do better with shared parenting compared to sole custody.[11][12] With this bill, the best interest of the children would prevail so that they spend equal or near equal parenting times with their mother and father, except in situations of child neglect or abuse. The bill passed the house with a vote of 137 to 7; it passed the senate committee; and it was expected to pass the senate as well, when it was filibustered by democratic senator Jill Schupp from suburban St. Louis.[13][14] Swan reintroduced the bill in 2019, under the new name of HB229.[15]
