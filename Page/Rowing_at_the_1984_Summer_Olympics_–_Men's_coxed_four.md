The MEN'S COXED FOUR (M4+) competition at the 1984 Summer Olympics took place at Lake Casitas in Ventura County, California, United States. It was held from 30 July to 5 August and the dominant nations were missing from the event due to the Eastern Bloc boycott. The teams from the United States and New Zealand were regarded as favourites, but it was Great Britain that dominated the regatta, thus winning the nation's first rowing gold since the 1948 Summer Olympics, back then in front of their home crowd at the Henley Royal Regatta course. The 1984 event started Steve Redgrave's Olympic rowing success that would eventually see him win five Olympic gold medals.


Background

East Germany was the dominating country for the men's coxed four competition; since the 1977 World Rowing Championships, they had won this competition every year but for the previous world championship in 1983, when New Zealand claimed the title, displacing East Germany to the silver medal.[1][2] The second most dominating nation at the time was the Soviet Union, which had claimed five top three finishes since the 1976 Summer Olympics.[3][4][5][6][7][8] Both these Eastern Bloc nations were part of the boycott in 1984, and that left New Zealand as the reigning world champion as the favourite for the event.[9] The USA was also highly rated, having won world championship silver and bronze in 1981 and 1982, respectively,[10][11] and gold at the Pan American Games in 1983.[12]
