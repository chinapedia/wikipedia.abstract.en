JOHN UHLER LEMMON III (February 8, 1925 – June 27, 2001) was an American actor who was nominated for an Academy Award eight times, winning twice. He starred in over 60 films, such as _Mister Roberts_ (1955, for which he won the year's Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), _Some Like It Hot_ (1959), _The Apartment_ (1960), _Days of Wine and Roses_ (1962), _Irma la Douce_ (1963), _The Great Race_ (1965), _The Odd Couple_ (1968, and its sequel _The Odd Couple II_ (1998), both with frequent co-star Walter Matthau), _Save the Tiger_ (1973, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor), _The China Syndrome_ (1979), _Missing_ (1982), and _Glengarry Glen Ross_ (1992).


Early life

Lemmon was born on February 8, 1925, in an elevator at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Massachusetts.[1] He was the only child of Mildred Burgess LaRue and John Uhler Lemmon, Jr., the president of the Doughnut Corporation of America.[2][3] John Uhler Lemmon II was of Irish heritage, and his son was raised Catholic.[4] His parents had a difficult marriage, and separated permanently when Lemmon was 18, but never divorced.[5][6] He attended John Ward Elementary School in Newton and the Rivers School in Weston, Massachusetts. Often unwell as a child, Lemmon had three significant operations on his ears before he turned 10.[7] He had spent two years in hospital by the time he turned 12.[8]

During his acceptance of his lifetime achievement award, he stated that he knew he wanted to be an actor from the age of eight. He began to act in school productions.[9] Lemmon attended Rivers Country Day School and Phillips Andover Academy (Class of 1943), where he pursued track sports with success, and Harvard College (Class of 1947), where he lived in Eliot House[10][11] At Harvard, he was president of the Hasty Pudding Club and vice-president of Dramatic and Delphic Clubs. Except for drama and music, however, he was an unexceptional student.[12] Forbidden to act in theatres, Lemmon broke Harvard rules to appear in roles using pseudonyms like Timothy Orange.[13]

He was also a member of the V-12 Navy College Training Program and Lemmon was commissioned by the United States Navy,[14] serving briefly as an ensign on an aircraft carrier during World War II before returning to Harvard after completing his military service.[15] After graduation with a degree in War Service Sciences[16] in 1947,[17] he studied acting under coach Uta Hagen at HB Studio[18] in New York City.[19] He was a pianist, who became devoted to the instrument aged 14 and learned to play by ear.[20][21] For about a year in New York City, he worked unpaid as a waiter and master of ceremonies at the Old Knick bar on Second Avenue.[22] He also played the piano at the venue.[23]


Career

Early years (1949–65)

Lemmon became a professional actor, working on radio and Broadway.[24] His film debut was a bit part as a plasterer in the film _The Lady Takes a Sailor_ (1949),[25] but he was already appearing in television shows, which numbered about 400 from 1948 to 1953.[26]

Lemmon believed his stage career was about to take off when he was appearing on Broadway for the first time in a 1953 revival of the comedy _Room Service_, but the production closed after two weeks.[27] Despite this setback, he was spotted by talent scout Max Arnow, who was then working for Columbia, and Lemmon's focus shifted to films and Hollywood.[28] Columbia's head Harry Cohn wanted to change Lemmon's name, in case it was used to describe the quality of the actor's films, but he successfully resisted.[29]

His first role as a leading man was in the comedy _It Should Happen to You_ (1954), which also featured the established Judy Holliday in the female lead. Bosley Crowther in his review for _The New York Times_ described Lemmon as possessing "a warm and appealing personality. The screen should see more of him."[30] The two leads soon reunited in _Phffft_ (also 1954).[31] Kim Novak had a secondary role as a brief love interest for Lemmon's character.[32] "If it wasn't for Judy, I'm not sure I would have concentrated on films", he told _The Washington Post_ in 1986 saying early in his career he had a snobbish attitude towards films over the stage.[33] He managed to negotiate a contract with Columbia allowing him leeway to pursue other projects, some of the terms of which he said "nobody had gotten before".[34] He signed a seven-year contract, but ended staying with Columbia for ten years.[35] Lemmon's appearance as Ensign Pulver in _Mister Roberts_ (1955), with James Cagney and Henry Fonda, for Warner Bros. gained Lemmon the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Director John Ford decided to cast Lemmon after seeing his Columbia screen test, which had been directed by Richard Quine. At an impromptu meeting on the studio lot, Ford persuaded the actor to appear in the film, although Lemmon did not realise he was in conversation with Ford at the time.[36]

In the military farce _Operation Mad Ball_ (1957) set in a U.S. Army base in France after World War II, Lemmon played a calculating private.[37] He met comedian Ernie Kovacs, who co-starred, and they became close friends, appearing together in two subsequent films, as a warlock in _Bell, Book and Candle_ (1958, a film he apparently disliked)[38] and _It Happened to Jane_ (1959), all three under the direction of Richard Quine. Lemmon starred in six films directed by Quine.[39] The others were _My Sister Eileen_ (1955), _The Notorious Landlady_ (1962) and _How to Murder Your Wife_ (1965).

Lemmon worked with Billy Wilder on seven films. Their association began with the director's _Some Like It Hot_ (1959), with Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe.[40] His role required him to perform 80% of the role in drag. People who knew his mother, Millie Lemmon, said he had mimicked her personality and even her hairstyle.[41] The critic Pauline Kael said he was "demoniacally funny" in the part.[42] The sequence of films with Wilder continued with _The Apartment_ (1960) and _Irma la Douce_ (1963), in which Lemmon co-starred with Shirley MacLaine. He was Oscar nominated for his roles in _Some Like It Hot_ and _The Apartment_. MacLaine, observing the director's relationship with his male lead, believed it amounted to "professional infatuation".[43]

Lemmon first role a film directed by Blake Edwards was in _Days of Wine and Roses_ (1962) portraying Joe Clay, a young alcoholic businessman. The role, for which he was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar, was one of Lemmon's favorite roles. By this time, he had appeared in 15 comedies, a western and an adventure film. "The movie people put a label attached to your big toe — 'light comedy' — and that's the only way they think of you", he commented in an interview during 1984. "I knew damn well I could play drama. Things changed following _Days of Wine and Roses_. That was as important a film as I've ever done."[44] _Days of Wine and Roses_ was the first film where Lemmon was involved with production of the film via his Jalam production company.[45] Lemmon's association with Edwards continued with _The Great Race_ (1965), which reunited him with Tony Curtis. His salary this time was $1 million, but the film did not return its large budget at the box-office.[46]

Mid-career (1966–78)

In Wilder's _The Fortune Cookie_ (1966), Lemmon first worked with actor Walter Matthau, which the British critic, Philip French, described as their "one truly great film".[47] Another nine films with them co-starring eventually followed.[48] Lemmon's production company Jalem produced _Cool Hand Luke_ (1967) with Paul Newman in the lead.[49] Newman, in gratitude, offered him the role of the Sundance Kid in _Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid_, but Lemmon turned it down.[50]

The best known Lemmon-Matthau film is _The Odd Couple_ (1968), based on the Neil Simon play, with the lead characters being the mismatched Felix Ungar (Lemmon) and Oscar Madison (Matthau), respectively neurotical and cynical.[51] The much admired comedy _Kotch_ (1971), the only film Lemmon directed,[52] starred Matthau who was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. _The Out-of-Towners_ (1970) was another Neil Simon scripted film in which Lemmon appeared.

Lemmon starred with Juliet Mills in _Avanti!_ (1972) and appeared with Matthau in _The Front Page_ (1974). Both films were directed by Wilder. He felt Lemmon had a natural tendency toward overacting that had to be tempered; the Wilder biography _Nobody's Perfect_ quotes the director as saying, "Lemmon, I would describe him as a ham, a fine ham, and with ham you have to trim a little fat." Wilder though also once said: "Happiness is working with Jack Lemmon".[53]

Lemmon in _Save the Tiger_ (1973) plays Harry Stoner, a businessman in the garment trade who finds someone to commit arson by burning down his warehouse to avoid bankruptcy.[54][55] The project was rejected by multiple studios, but Paramount was prepared to make the film if it was budgeted for only $1 million. Lemmon was so keen to play the part that he worked for union scale, then $165 a week.[56] The role was demanding, like the character Lemmon came close to breaking point: "I started to crack as the character did," he recalled. "I just kept getting deeper and deeper into the character's despair."[57] For this film, Lemmon won the Best Actor Oscar. Having won the Best Supporting actor Academy Award for _Mister Roberts_, he became the first actor to achieve a double, although Helen Hayes had achieved this feat three years earlier in the equivalent female categories.[58]

Later career (1979–2001)

Lemmon was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his role _The China Syndrome_ (1979), for which he was also awarded Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival.[59] In _Tribute_, a stage drama first performed in 1979, he played a press agent who has cancer while trying to mend his relationship with his son. The Broadway production ran for 212 performances, but it gained mixed reviews. Nevertheless, Lemmon was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.[60] For his role in the 1980 film version, Lemmon gained another Oscar nomination.[61]

His final Oscar nomination was for _Missing_ (1982), as a conservative father whose son has vanished in Chile while it was under the Pinochet, he won another Cannes award for his performance.[62] A contemporary failure was his last film with Billy Wilder, _Buddy Buddy_ (1981). Lemmon's character attempts suicide in a hotel while a hitman (Matthau) in the next suite.[63] Another flop at the box-office was his final film with Blake Edwards, another of his friends, was _That's Life!_ (1986) in which he appeared in the director's self-autobiographical part with Edwards' wife, Julie Andrews. A seductress role was played by Lemmon's wife, Felicia Farr.[64] His later career is said to have been affected by other bad choices, such as _Mass Appeal_ (1984), about a conservative Catholic priest, _Macaroni_ (1985), a tale about old Army friends with Marcello Mastroianni, and _That's Life_.[65] Lemmon received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1988.

Lemmon was nominated for a Tony Award the second and last time for a revival of Eugene O'Neill's _Long Day's Journey Into Night_ in 1986;[66] Lemmon had taken the lead role of James Tyrone in a production directed by Jonathan Miller.[67] It had a London run in 1987, Lemmon's first theatre work in the city, and a television version followed. A return to London in 1989 for the anti-war play _Veterans' Day_, with Michael Gambon, was poorly received by critics and, following modest audiences, soon closed.[68][69] As well as the production of _Long Day's Journey Into Night_, Lemmon also worked with Kevin Spacey in the films _The Murder of Mary Phagan_ (1987), _Dad_ (1989), and _Glengarry Glen Ross_ (1992). Lemmon and Matthau had small parts in Oliver Stone's film, _JFK_ (1991) in which both men appeared without sharing screen time.[70] The duo reunited in _Grumpy Old Men_ (1993). The film was a surprise hit. Later in the decade, they starred together in _The Grass Harp_ (1995), _Grumpier Old Men_ (1995), _Out to Sea_ (1997), and _The Odd Couple II_ (1998). Both _Grumpier Old Men_ and _The Odd Couple II_ were box-office disappointments.[71]

In 1996, Lemmon was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Or Non-Musical Album for his narration on "Harry S Truman: A Journey To Independence".[72]

For his role in the William Friedkin[73] directed version of _Twelve Angry Men_ (1997), Lemmon was nominated for "Best Actor in a Made for TV Movie" in the 1998 Golden Globe Awards. The role was as the contentious juror, played in the original 1957 film version by Henry Fonda. Lemmon appeared in the remake with George C. Scott and reunited with him in another television film, this time _Inherit the Wind_ (1999).[74]

Lemmon was a guest voice on _The Simpsons_ episode "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson" (1997), as the owner of the pretzel business. For his role as Morrie Schwartz in his final television role, _Tuesdays with Morrie_ (1999), Lemmon won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie. His final film role was uncredited: the narrator in Robert Redford's film _The Legend of Bagger Vance_.


Lifetime awards

, Los Angeles, California, USA July 19, 2012]] In 1986 the U.S. National Board of Review of Motion Pictures gave Lemmon a "Career Achievement" award;[75] two years later, the American Film Institute gave him its Lifetime Achievement Award in March 1988.[76] In 1995 Lemmon was awarded the inaugural Harvard Arts Medal.[77]

In 1996 Lemmon was awarded the Honorary Golden Bear award at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival.[78]


Personal life

Lemmon was married twice. His first wife was actress Cynthia Stone, with whom he had a son, Chris Lemmon (born 1954), but the couple divorced over their incompatibility. He married his second wife, actress Felicia Farr, on August 17, 1962 in Paris while shooting _Irma La Douce_. The couple's daughter, Courtney, was born in 1966.[79] Farr had a daughter from her marriage to Lee Farr named Denise. Lemmon was a Catholic.[80] He was close friends with actors Tony Curtis and Kevin Spacey, among others.

As the 1970s progressed, Lemmon began to increase his drinking to cope with stress. He was fined for Driving under the influence (DUI) in 1976, finally quitting alcohol in the early 1980s.[81] On a 1998 episode of the television program _Inside the Actors Studio_, he stated that he was a recovering alcoholic.[82][83]

Lemmon was known as the "star" of the celebrity-packed third round telecast of the annual AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, held at Pebble Beach Golf Links each February. Lemmon's packed gallery was there not only for his humor but also to root him on in his lifelong quest to "make the cut" to round 4, something he was never able to achieve. The amateur who helps his team most in the Pro-Am portion is annually awarded the Jack Lemmon Award.

During the 1980s and 1990s Lemmon served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute.[84][85]

Lemmon was a registered Democrat.[86]


Death

]] Lemmon died of bladder cancer on June 27, 2001.[87] He had suffered from the disease privately for two years before his death. His body was interred at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, California. (The graves of Walter Matthau and film director Billy Wilder lie in the same cemetery.) Lemmon's gravestone reads like a title screen from a film: "JACK LEMMON in".[88]
