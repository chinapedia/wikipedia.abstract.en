The _INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMA AND BIO SCIENCES_ is a quarterly scientific journal covering research in pharmaceutical and biological sciences. It was established in 2010 and the editor-in-chief is Guru Prasad Mohanta (Annamalai University).

The journal was placed on Jeffrey Beall's list of "Potential, possible, or probable" predatory scholarly open-access journals before it went offline.[1] Although the journal charges article processing fees,[2] readers have to subscribe to the journal or buy articles individually.[3]


Abstracting and indexing

The journal is abstracted and indexed in Chemical Abstracts Service[4] and Embase.[5]

From 2010 to 2014, and again in 2016, the journal was indexed in Scopus.[6] Indexing was discontinued for "publication concerns".[7]
