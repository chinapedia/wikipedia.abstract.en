COMMON SORREL or GARDEN SORREL (_Rumex acetosa_), often simply called SORREL, is a perennial herb in the family Polygonaceae. Other names for sorrel include SPINACH DOCK and NARROW-LEAVED DOCK. It is a common plant in grassland habitats and is cultivated as a garden herb or salad vegetable (pot herb).


Description

Sorrel is a slender herbaceous perennial plant about high, with roots that run deep into the ground, as well as juicy stems and edible, arrow-shaped (sagittate) leaves. The leaves, when consumed raw, have a sour taste. The lower leaves are in length with long petioles and a membranous ocrea formed of fused, sheathing stipules. The upper ones are sessile, and frequently become crimson. It has whorled spikes of reddish-green flowers, which bloom in early summer, becoming purplish.[1][2] The species is dioecious, with stamens and pistils on different plants.[3]

The leaves are eaten by the larvae of several species of Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) including the blood-vein moth, as well as by non-specialized snails and slugs.


Distribution

_Rumex acetosa_ occurs in grassland habitats throughout Europe from the northern Mediterranean coast to the north of Scandinavia and in parts of Central Asia. It occurs as an introduced species in parts of Australia and North America.[4]


Subspecies

Several subspecies have been named.[5] Not all are cultivated:

-   _Rumex acetosa_ ssp. _acetosa_
-   _Rumex acetosa_ ssp. _ambiguus_
-   _Rumex acetosa_ ssp. _arifolius_
-   _Rumex acetosa_ ssp. _hibernicus_
-   _Rumex acetosa_ ssp. _hirtulus_
-   _Rumex acetosa_ ssp. _vinealis_


Uses

Common sorrel has been cultivated for centuries. The leaves may be pur√©ed in soups and sauces or added to salads; they have a flavour that is similar to kiwifruit or sour wild strawberries. The plant's sharp taste is due to oxalic acid.

In northern Nigeria, sorrel is used in stews usually with spinach. In some Hausa communities, it is steamed and made into salad using _kuli-kuli_ (traditional roasted peanut cakes with oil extracted), salt, pepper, onion and tomatoes. In India, the leaves are used in soups or curries made with yellow lentils and peanuts. In Afghanistan, the leaves are coated in a wet batter and deep fried, then served as an appetizer or if in season during Ramadan, for breaking the fast.

Throughout eastern Europe, wild or garden sorrel is used to make sour soups, stewed with vegetables or herbs, meats or eggs. In rural Greece, it is used with spinach, leeks, and chard in spanakopita. In Albania, the leaves are simmered and served cold marinated in olive oil, or as an ingredient for filling _byrek_ pies (_byrek me lakra_). In Armenia, the leaves are collected in spring, woven into braids, and dried for use during winter. The most common preparation is aveluk soup, where the leaves are rehydrated and rinsed to reduce bitterness, then stewed with onions, potatoes, walnuts, garlic and bulgur wheat or lentils, and sometimes sour plums.

(salmon escalope in sorrel sauce), invented in 1962 by the Troisgros brothers, is an emblematic dish of the French nouvelle cuisine.[6][7]
