The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to literature:

LITERATURE – prose, written or oral, including fiction and non-fiction, drama, and poetry. _See also: outline of poetry._


What _type_ of thing is literature?

Literature can be described as all of the following:

-   Communication – activity of conveying information. Communication requires a sender, a message, and an intended recipient, although the receiver need not be present or aware of the sender's intent to communicate at the time of communication; thus communication can occur across vast distances in time and space.
    -   Written communication (writing) – representation of language in a textual medium through the use of a set of signs or symbols (known as a writing system).[1]
-   Subdivision of culture – shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution, organization, or group.
    -   One of the arts – imaginative, creative, or nonscientific branch of knowledge, especially as studied academically.[2]
