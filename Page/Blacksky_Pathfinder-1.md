BLACKSKY PATHFINDER-1 is an earth imaging satellite of Spaceflight Industries.[1] The satellite is equipped with payloads from Harris Corporation designed to image an area approximately 4.4 km x 6.6 km at 1-meter resolution.[2]

This is first in a series of 60 satellites planned to deploy the BlackSky constellation that will provide near real-time images in about 90 minutes to produce images that are more current and wide-ranging to increase global transparency.[3]

The satellite was launched on 26 September 2016 by ISRO using the PSLV-C35 rocket.[4]
