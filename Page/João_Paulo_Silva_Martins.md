Born in Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, João Paulo joined Santos' youth setup in 2013, after representing Sãocarlense, Grêmio, Itaporã and Sete de Setembro.[1] In 2014, after winning the year's Copa São Paulo de Futebol Júnior, he was promoted to the first team by manager Oswaldo de Oliveira.

In March 2015, after Vanderlei's injury, João Paulo was inscribed in the year's Campeonato Paulista as a third-choice behind Vladimir and Gabriel Gasparotto.[2] In November of that year, he renewed his contract until 2018.[3]

João Paulo made his unofficial first team debut on 8 October 2016, playing the last 20 minutes and saving a penalty in a 1–1 friendly draw against Benfica.[4] On 16 July of the following year, after both Vanderlei and Vladimir were injured, he made his professional – and Série A – debut by starting in a 0–0 away draw against Vasco da Gama.[5]
