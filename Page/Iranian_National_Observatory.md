Gargash.jpg IRANIAN NATIONAL OBSERVATORY (INO) aims at the construction of observing facilities for astronomical research and education purpose.[1] The primary goal is the design and construction of a 4m-class optical telescope and other smaller observing facilities to respond to a growing demand.[2] INO is executed at the Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), one of the leading research institutes in fundamental sciences.


Background

The current research and training capabilities in observational astronomy in Iran is unable to meet the growing demand due to a rapid growth in higher education over the past two decades. While almost every big university in Iran has an astronomy department or group, the existing observational facilities consist of a number of small telescopes in various university campus observatories generally used for undergraduate and graduate training.

A medium-size optical telescope is thought to be a step to facilitate research in astronomy and observational cosmology. The geographic location of Iran, 32N 53E, relatively dry climate, and high altitude mountains, offer suitable locations for optical telescopes to carry out surveys and time critical observations.

At the present, the flagship of the INO observing facilities is a 3.4m optical telescope under construction, known as INO340. Iranian scientists see the project as a platform to catch up with the science and technological developments in the field of astronomy and cosmology.[3]


Site selection

The site selection activities began in 2000 before the formal approval of the project in 2004. With two sites in hand after the conclusion of the site selection (2000–2007) INO made seeing measurements to be able to compare the two sites, Dinava ~3000m and Gargash ~3610m. In 2011, INO announced Mount Gargash as the site for this project. [4][5] The site became road accessible in 2016.[6]


Telescope design

OPTICS

The telescope is a Ritchey–Chrétien f/11 which provides unvignetted 20 arcmin field of view at the main Cassegrain focus. In addition, 3 broken side foci are also provided, each with a field of view of 8 arcmin. The main mirror (M1) is a single segment fast f/1.5 mirror with a diameter of 3.4m, which makes INO340 one of the most compact telescopes for its size. M1 is a meniscus shape 18cm thick made of a Zerudor ceramic with a 700mm central hole. The M1 is polished to 1nm roughness. It is supported by 60 actuators which are actively controlled to hold the mirror shape at the correct shape. The 600mm secondary mirror reflects the light from the primary mirror and is also controlled by a hexapod. The mirror is made of a Zerodur ceramic and has a hyperbolic surface geometry.[7]

THE STRUCTURE

The telescope mount is altitude over azimuth (alt-az) which allows the telescope to be compact and provides direct load paths from the telescope down through the structure to the pier and foundations. The drive motors used to move the telescope in azimuth and elevation will be servo motors with position feedback will be provided by linear tape encoders.[8]

TELESCOPE CONTROL SYSTEM (TCS)

The TCS is responsible for controlling a number of subsystems, such as the mount control system (MCS) which is responsible for pointing and tracking the targets and the mirrors control system or active control systems (ACS). MCS receives commands from the user interface.[9]


Observational facilities

INO SITE MONITORING

The INO site monitoring facility become operational in Nov 2014. The facility is located at about 500 m to the south of the main Gargash peak where the 3.4 m Telescope is under construction. The facility consists of three elements. First, an automatic DIMM seeing monitor placed at a height of 6m above the surface of the mountain, remotely operated from Tehran. Secondly the facility has a standard weather station at 9m above the ground. and finally, it is equipped with an all-sky camera. The control system is designed in-house.[10][11]

Live site data is available here.

INO LENS ARRAY

The INO Lens Array (INOLA) is a multi-lens array constructed by the INO Technology Development Division (TDD) team to study ultra-low surface brightness systems at visible wavelengths. The array is particularly designed to reveal faint structures by greatly reducing scattered light and internal reflections within its optics. Some of the scientific goals envisioned for the INOLA include observing faint galaxies, stellar halos and substructures, tidal debris around galaxies, comets and minor bodies in the solar system, light echos, intra-cluster light, variable stars and exoplanetary transits. INOLA became operational in 2018 and is now open for proposals.

Science with INO

A vast amount of scientific issues in observational astronomy and cosmology can be addressed using a medium class telescope such as INO 3.4m telescope. At the same time, as it is designed for a wavelength interval limited to between 325 and 2500 nm, INO340 is an excellent tool for collaborative programs joining other, major, similar size and/or larger telescopes as well as with space-based telescopes optimized to work at similar or different, not least very different, wavelength ranges.[12]

The study of galaxies and our current understanding of the formation and evolution of the large and small scale structures are, to a large extent, based on the observations carried out by mid-size telescopes. Even at the era of large and very large telescopes, such observations are still pursued thanks to advances in the instrumentation. While there are new frontiers to be explored by very large and extremely large telescopes, there are still enormous details which require further explorations. For economic and flexibility reasons there are still demands for 2‐4m class telescopes. These telescopes can complement other observing facilities to address some of the most fundamental questions related to galaxies such as the evolution of the cosmic web of galaxies, metal production and distribution within and between galaxies, the formation of the present day Hubble sequence and also understanding our own galaxy.

For the community of astronomers in Iran, extra-galactic astronomy and observational cosmology are new undertakings mostly because of the absence of suitable observing facilities in the past and thus INO340 will focus on this line of developing research. Taking advantage of the location, INO340 is designed to respond to time-critical astronomical events. Large programs and surveys are also pursued in instrumentation planning.
