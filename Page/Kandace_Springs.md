Biography

Kandace Springs was born in Nashville, Tennessee, United States, in 1989. Her father Scat Springs was a session singer in Nashville. She has two sisters. At the age of ten she started following piano lessons. She grew up listening to jazz and soul singers like Nina Simone. She was noted for performing Sam Smith's _Stay with Me_ on the internet. She moved to New York City to work with Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers. She believes that music can touch people, spread a message, keep the world sane.[1]

In 2014 she released her self-titled debut EP for the jazz label Blue Note Records. It was produced by Pop & Oak.[2] _Love Got in the Way_ was her first music video. She collaborated with Ghostface Killah on his 2014 single _Love Don't Live Here No More_. She performed live on several TV shows: the Late Show with David Letterman, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Later... with Jools Holland. Prince asked her to perform with him on stage.

For her 2016 album _Soul Eyes_ she kept working with Sturken and Rogers, but she also attracted producer Larry Klein, who praised her as a natural talent. On smooth ballads like _Place to Hide_ and relaxed midtempo songs like _Talk to Me_ she accompanied herself on the piano. Collaborating artists were trumpeter Terence Blanchard, guitarists Dean Parks and Jesse Harris, and drummer Vinnie Colaiuta. Her 2018 album _Indigo_ was produced by Karriem Riggins. It combines the vocal jazz tradition with modern R&B influences and a trumpet solo by Roy Hargrove.[3]
