Myths

Sivalingam_at_panchalimedu.jpg According to the myths, Pandavas along with their spouse Panchali had a sojourn there at time of one-year exile.[13] Hence the place got its name _Panchalimedu_ which derived from the words "Panchali" (Draupadi) and "medu" (hill). The local tribes there offered selfless helps to the Kuru princes. Pandavas left the region before the beginning of one year incognito. They rewarded an idol of Goddess Durga to the tribal chief for their helps and instructed them to worship Devi. But, unexpected incidents occurred when the tribes worshipped Devi by following their own uncivilized puja methods. Hence the place became uninhabitable for them. Later, Devi herself moved to the present Valliyamkavu region and presided there. In light of this myth, people still believe that Panchalimedu is the _moola sthana_ or sanctum sanctorum of Devi.[14] Panchalimedu_check-dam.JPG At present, there is a small temple dedicated to Goddess Bhuvaneswari, which can be approached by a walkway from the main road. The temple which hadn't daily poojas in the past is currently under the administration of Travancore Devaswom Board. The granite edicts found there depicts the linkage of the place to ancient history.[15] Several Shiva lingas, Trishulas (trident) and Nāga idols are also placed near the shrine.[16] A small circular pond known as _Panchalikulam_ is situated there, in which Pandavas and Panchali took their daily bath.[17] It is about in diameter. Even during hot summers, it will be filled by plenty of water.[18] One cave also exist there named _Pandavaguha_ (cave of Pandavas), in which the footprints of Bhima can be witnessed.[19] Local folks still believe that it is the footprints of the mighty Bhima himself.[20]
