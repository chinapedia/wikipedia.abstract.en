CHARLIZE THERON ( ;[1] ;[2] born 7 August 1975)[3] is a South African[4] and American actress and producer. She is the recipient of several accolades, including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and the Silver Bear for Best Actress.

Theron came to international prominence in the 1990s by playing the leading lady in the Hollywood films _The Devil's Advocate_ (1997), _Mighty Joe Young_ (1998), and _The Cider House Rules_ (1999). In 2003, she received critical acclaim for her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos in _Monster_, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the first South African to win an Oscar in a major acting category. She received another Academy Award nomination for playing a sexually abused woman seeking justice in the drama _North Country_ (2005). Theron has since starred in several top-grossing action films, including _Hancock_ (2008), _Snow White and the Huntsman_ (2012), _Prometheus_ (2012), _Mad Max: Fury Road_ (2015), _The Fate of the Furious_ (2017), and _Atomic Blonde_ (2017). She also received praise for playing troubled women in Jason Reitman's comedy-dramas _Young Adult_ (2011) and _Tully_ (2018), receiving Golden Globe Award nominations for both films.

Since the early 2000s, Theron has ventured into film production with her company Denver and Delilah Productions. She has produced numerous films, in many of which she had a starring role, including _The Burning Plain_ (2008), _Dark Places_ (2015), and _Long Shot_ (2019). Theron became an American citizen in 2007, while retaining her South African citizenship. In 2016, _Time_ named her in the Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.[5]


Early life

Theron was born in Benoni, in the then-Transvaal Province (now Gauteng Province) of South Africa, the only child of Gerda (née Maritz)[6][7] and Charles Theron (born 27 November 1947).[8][9] Second Boer War figure Danie Theron was her great-great-uncle.[10] She is from an Afrikaner family, and her ancestry includes Dutch as well as French and German; her French forebears were early Huguenot settlers in South Africa.[11] "Theron" is an Occitan surname (originally spelled Théron) pronounced in Afrikaans as .

She grew up on her parents' farm in Benoni, near Johannesburg.[12][13][14] On 21 June 1991, Theron's father, an alcoholic,[15] threatened both teenaged Charlize and her mother while drunk, physically attacking her mother and shooting a gun at both of them.[16] Theron's mother retrieved her own handgun, shot back and killed him.[17] The shooting was legally adjudged to have been self-defence, and her mother faced no charges.[18][19]

Theron attended Putfontein Primary School (Laerskool Putfontein), a period during which she has said she was not "fitting in."[20] At thirteen, Theron was sent to boarding school and began her studies at the National School of the Arts in Johannesburg.[21] Although Theron is fluent in English, her first language is Afrikaans.[22][23]


Career

Beginnings (1991–1996)

Although seeing herself as a dancer,[24] at age 16 Theron won a one-year modelling contract[25] at a local competition in Salerno[26][27] and moved with her mother to Milan, Italy.[28] After Theron spent a year modelling throughout Europe, she and her mother moved to the US, both New York City and Miami.[29] In New York, she attended the Joffrey Ballet School, where she trained as a ballet dancer until a knee injury closed this career path.[30] As Theron recalled in 2008: In 1994,[31] Theron flew to Los Angeles, on a one-way ticket her mother bought for her, intending to work in the film industry.[32] During the initial months there, she went to a Hollywood Boulevard bank to cash a cheque her mother had sent to help with the rent.[33] When the teller refused to cash it, Theron engaged in a shouting match with him.[34] Upon seeing this, talent agent John Crosby,[35] waiting behind her, handed her his business card and subsequently introduced her to casting agents and also an acting school.[36][37] She later fired him as her manager after he kept sending her scripts for films similar to _Showgirls_ and _Species_.[38]

After several months in the city, Theron made her film debut with a non-speaking role in the horror film _Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest_ (1995).[39] Her first speaking role was that of a hitwoman in _2 Days in the Valley_ (1996).[40] Though it was a small role, a lingerie-clad Theron was prominently featured on the movie poster, and film offers for hot-chick parts quickly followed. But Theron turned them down. "A lot of people were saying, 'You should just hit while the iron's hot,'" she remarked. "But playing the same part over and over doesn't leave you with any longevity. And I knew it was going to be harder for me, because of what I look like, to branch out to different kinds of roles."[41]

Rise to fame (1997–2002)

Larger roles in widely released Hollywood films followed, and her career expanded by the end of the 1990s. In the horror drama _The Devil's Advocate_ (1997), which is credited to be her break-out film,[42] Theron starred alongside Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino as the haunted wife of an unusually successful lawyer. She subsequently starred in the adventure film _Mighty Joe Young_ (1998) as the friend and protecter of a giant mountain gorilla, and in the drama _The Cider House Rules_ (1999), as a woman who seeks an abortion in World War II-era Maine.[43] While _Mighty Joe Young_ flopped at the box office,[44] _The Devil's Advocate_ and _The Cider House Rules_ were commercially successful.[45][46] She was on the cover of the January 1999 issue of _Vanity Fair_ as the "White Hot Venus".[47] She also appeared on the cover of the May 1999 issue of _Playboy_ magazine, in photos taken several years earlier when she was an unknown model; Theron unsuccessfully sued the magazine for publishing them without her consent.[48][49]

By the early 2000s, Theron continued to steadily take on roles in films such as _Reindeer Games_ (2000), _The Yards_ (2000), _The Legend of Bagger Vance_ (2000), _Men of Honor_ (2000), _Sweet November_ (2001), _The Curse of the Jade Scorpion_ (2001), and _Trapped_ (2002), all of which, despite achieving only limited commercial success, helped to establish her as an actress; she was briefly considered a new "It girl". On this period in her career, Theron remarked: "I kept finding myself in a place where directors would back me but studios didn't. [I began] a love affair with directors, the ones I really, truly admired. I found myself making really bad movies, too. _Reindeer Games_ was not a good movie, but I did it because I loved [director] John Frankenheimer."[50]

Worldwide recognition (2003–2008)

Theron starred as a safe and vault "technician" in the 2003 heist film _The Italian Job_, an American remake of the 1969 British film of the same name, directed by F. Gary Gray and opposite Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Jason Statham, Seth Green, and Donald Sutherland. The film was a box office success, grossing US$176 million worldwide.[51]

In _Monster_ (2003), Theron portrayed serial killer Aileen Wuornos, a former prostitute who was executed in Florida in 2002 for killing six men (she was not tried for a seventh murder) in the late 1980s and early 1990s;[52] film critic Roger Ebert felt that Theron gave "one of the greatest performances in the history of the cinema".[53] For her portrayal, she was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actress at the 76th Academy Awards in February 2004,[54] as well as the Screen Actors Guild Award and the Golden Globe Award.[55] She is the first South African to win an Oscar for Best Actress.[56] The Oscar win pushed her to _The Hollywood Reporter's_ 2006 list of highest-paid actresses in Hollywood, earning up to US$10 million for a film; she ranked seventh.[57] _AskMen_ also named her the number one most desirable woman of 2003.[58]

Charlize_cropped.jpg'' at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival]] For her role of Swedish actress and singer Britt Ekland in the 2004 HBO film _The Life and Death of Peter Sellers_, Theron garnered Golden Globe Award and Primetime Emmy Award nominations.[59] In 2005, she portrayed Rita, the mentally challenged love interest of Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman), on the third season of Fox's television series _Arrested Development_,[60] and starred in the financially unsuccessful science fiction thriller _Aeon Flux_; for her voice-over work in the _Aeon Flux_ video game, she received a Spike Video Game Award for Best Performance by a Human Female.[61][62]

In the critically acclaimed drama _North Country_ (2005), Theron portrayed a single mother and an iron mine worker experiencing sexual harassment. David Rooney of _Variety_ wrote: "The film represents a confident next step for lead Charlize Theron. Though the challenges of following a career-redefining Oscar role have stymied actresses, Theron segues from _Monster_ to a performance in many ways more accomplished [...] The strength of both the performance and character anchor the film firmly in the tradition of other dramas about working-class women leading the fight over industrial workplace issues, such as _Norma Rae_ or _Silkwood_."[63] For her performance, she received Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actress.[64][65] _Ms._ magazine also honoured her for this performance with a feature article in its Fall 2005 issue.[66] On 30 September 2005, Theron received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[67]

In 2007, Theron played a police detective in the critically acclaimed crime film _In the Valley of Elah_, and produced and starred as a reckless, slatternly mother in the little-seen drama film _Sleepwalking_, alongside Nick Stahl and AnnaSophia Robb. _The Christian Science Monitor_ praised the latter film, commenting that "Despite its deficiencies, and the inadequate screen time allotted to Theron (who's quite good), _Sleepwalking_ has a core of feeling".[68] In 2008, Theron starred as a woman who faced a traumatic childhood in the drama _The Burning Plain_, directed by Guillermo Arriaga and opposite Jennifer Lawrence and Kim Basinger, and also played the ex-wife of an alcoholic superhero alongside Will Smith in the superhero film _Hancock_. _The Burning Plain_ found a limited release in theaters,[69] but _Hancock_ made US$624.3 million worldwide.[70] Also in 2008, Theron was named the Hasty Pudding Theatricals Woman of the Year,[71] and was asked to be a UN Messenger of Peace by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.[72]

Hiatus and return to acting (2009–2011)

Her film releases in 2009 were the post-apocalyptic drama _The Road_, in which she briefly appeared in flashbacks, and the animated film _Astro Boy_, providing her voice for a character. On 4 December 2009, Theron co-presented the draw for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in Cape Town, South Africa, accompanied by several other celebrities of South African nationality or ancestry. During rehearsals she drew an Ireland ball instead of France as a joke at the expense of FIFA, referring to Thierry Henry's handball controversy in the play-off match between France and Ireland.[73][74] The stunt alarmed FIFA enough for it to fear she might do it again in front of a live global audience.[75]

Following a two-year hiatus from the big screen, Theron returned to the spotlight in 2011 with the black comedy _Young Adult_. Directed by Jason Reitman, the film earned critical acclaim, especially for her performance as a depressed divorced, alcoholic 37-year-old ghost writer. Richard Roeper awarded the film an A grade, stating "Charlize Theron delivers one of the most impressive performances of the year".[76] She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and several other awards. In 2011, describing her process to portray a character on screen, she said:

Roles in big studio films (2012–present)

Charlize_Theron_WonderCon_2012_(Straighten_Crop).jpg in March 2012 promoting _Prometheus_]] In 2012, Theron took on the role of villain in two-big budgeted films. She played Evil Queen Ravenna, Snow White's evil stepmother, in _Snow White and the Huntsman_,[77] opposite Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth, and appeared as a crew member with a hidden agenda in Ridley Scott's _Prometheus_. Mick LaSalle of the _San Francisco Chronicle_ found _Snow White and the Huntsman_ to be "[a] slow, boring film that has no charm and is highlighted only by a handful of special effects and Charlize Theron's truly evil queen",[78] while _The Hollywood Reporter_ writer Todd McCarthy, describing her role in _Prometheus_, asserted: "Theron is in ice goddess mode here, with the emphasis on ice [...] but perfect for the role all the same".[79] Both films were major box office hits, grossing around US$400 million internationally each.[80][81]

In 2013, _Vulture_/_NYMag_ named her the 68th Most Valuable Star in Hollywood saying: "We're just happy that Theron can stay on the list in a year when she didn't come out with anything [...] any actress who's got that kind of skill, beauty, and ferocity ought to have a permanent place in Hollywood."[82] In 2014, Theron took on the role of the wife of an infamous sheepherder in the western comedy film _A Million Ways to Die in the West_, directed by Seth MacFarlane, which was met with mediocre reviews and moderate box office returns.[83][84] In 2015, Theron played the sole survivor of the massacre of her family in the film adaptation of the Gillian Flynn novel _Dark Places_, directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner, in which she had a producer credit,[85] and starred as Imperator Furiosa in _Mad Max: Fury Road_ (2015), opposite Tom Hardy.[86][87] _Mad Max_ received widespread acclaim, with praise going towards Theron for the dominant nature taken by her character.[88] The film made US$378.4 million worldwide.[89]

Theron reprised her role as Queen Ravenna in the 2016 film _The Huntsman: Winter's War_, a sequel to _Snow White and the Huntsman_,[90] which was a critical and commercial failure.[91] In 2016, Theron also starred as a physician and activist working in West Africa in the little-seen romantic drama _The Last Face_, with Sean Penn,[92] provided her voice for the 3D stop-motion fantasy film _Kubo and the Two Strings_, and produced the independent drama _Brain on Fire_.

In 2017, Theron starred in _The Fate of the Furious_, as the main antagonist of the entire franchise, and played a spy on the eve of the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 in _Atomic Blonde_, an adaptation of the graphic novel _The Coldest City_, directed by David Leitch.[93] With a worldwide gross of US$1.2 billion, _The Fate of The Furious_ became Theron's most widely seen film,[94] and _Atomic Blonde_ was described by Richard Roeper of the _Chicago Sun-Times_ as "a slick vehicle for the magnetic, badass charms of Charlize Theron, who is now officially an A-list action star on the strength of this film and _Mad Max: Fury Road_."[95]

In the black comedy _Tully_ (2018), directed by Jason Reitman and written by Diablo Cody, Theron played an overwhelmed mother of three. The film was acclaimed by critics, who concluded it "delves into the modern parenthood experience with an admirably deft blend of humor and raw honesty, brought to life by an outstanding performance by Charlize Theron."[96] She also played the president of a pharmaceutical in the little-seen crime film _Gringo_ and produced the biographical war drama film _A Private War_, both released in 2018.[97]

In 2019, Theron starred as a U.S. Secretary of State, who reconnects with a journalist she used to babysit, in the romantic comedy film _Long Shot_.


Other ventures

Activism

Crystal_Award_Ceremony_-_Exploring_Arts_in_Society_Charlize_Theron.jpg

The Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project (CTAOP) was created in 2007 by Theron, who the next year was named a UN Messenger of Peace, in an effort to support African youth in the fight against HIV/AIDS. CTAOP's mission is to help keep African youth safe from HIV/AIDS. The project is committed to supporting community-engaged organizations that address the key drivers of the disease. Although the geographic scope of CTAOP is Sub-Saharan Africa, the primary concentration has mostly been Charlize's home country of South Africa. CTAOP's approach is based on the belief that community-based organizations on the ground understand the social and structural relationships of their communities better than anyone. By supporting these organizations through grant giving, networking, and spotlighting their work, CTAOP enables communities to mobilize and empower themselves to prevent HIV.[98]

In 2008, Theron was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace.[99] In his citation, Ban Ki-Moon said of Theron "You have consistently dedicated yourself to improving the lives of women and children in South Africa, and to preventing and stopping violence against women and girls."[100] She recorded a public service announcement in 2014 as part of their Stop Rape Now program.[101]

In December 2009, CTAOP and TOMS Shoes partnered to create a limited edition unisex shoe. The shoe was made from vegan materials and inspired by the African baobab tree, the silhouette of which was embroidered on blue and orange canvas. Ten-thousand pairs were given to destitute children, and a portion of the proceeds went to CTAOP.[102]

Theron is involved in women's rights organizations and has marched in pro-choice rallies.[103] Theron also is a supporter of animal rights and active member of PETA. She appeared in a PETA ad for its anti-fur campaign.[104]

Theron is a supporter of same-sex marriage and attended a march and rally to support that in Fresno, California, on 30 May 2009.[105] She publicly stated that she refused to get married until same sex marriage became legal in the United States, saying: "I don't want to get married because right now the institution of marriage feels very one-sided, and I want to live in a country where we all have equal rights. I think it would be exactly the same if we were married, but for me to go through that kind of ceremony, because I have so many friends who are gays and lesbians who would so badly want to get married, that I wouldn't be able to sleep with myself."[106] Theron further elaborated on her stance in a June 2011 interview on _Piers Morgan Tonight_. She stated: "I do have a problem with the fact that our government hasn't stepped up enough to make this federal, to make [gay marriage] legal. I think everybody has that right."[107]

In March 2014, CTAOP was among the charities that benefited from the annual Fame and Philanthropy fundraising event on the night of the 86th Academy Awards. Theron was an honoured guest along with Halle Berry and keynote speaker James Cameron.[108]

In 2015, Theron signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.[109]

Endorsements

Having signed a deal with John Galliano in 2004, Theron replaced Estonian model Tiiu Kuik as the spokeswoman in the "J'adore" advertisements by Christian Dior.[110] From October 2005 to December 2006, Theron earned US$3 million for the use of her image in a worldwide print media advertising campaign for Raymond Weil watches.[111] In February 2006, she and her corporate entity were sued by Weil for breach of contract.[112][113] The lawsuit was settled on 4 November 2008.[114]


Personal life

In 2007, Theron became a naturalized citizen of the United States,[115] while retaining her South African citizenship.[116]

Theron has two daughters, both adopted. She adopted Jackson in March 2012[117] and August in July 2015.[118][119] She lives in Los Angeles.[120] In April 2019, Theron revealed that Jackson, who was assigned male at birth, identifies as a girl. She stated, “They were born who they are and exactly where in the world both of them get to find themselves as they grow up, and who they want to be, is not for me to decide.”[121]

Relationships

Theron was in a three-year relationship with singer Stephan Jenkins until October 2001. Some of Third Eye Blind's third album, _Out of the Vein_, explores the emotions Jenkins experienced as a result of their breakup.[122][123]

Theron began a relationship with Irish actor Stuart Townsend after meeting him on the set of the 2002 film _Trapped_. The couple lived together in Los Angeles and Ireland.[124] Theron split from Townsend in January 2010.[125]

In December 2013, Theron began dating American actor Sean Penn. The two announced their engagement in December 2014. Theron ended their relationship in June 2015.[126]

Health concerns

As a child, Theron had suffered from jaundice that caused dental problems. She said in an interview with _The Sun_ that "I had no teeth until I was 11. I had these fangs because I had jaundice when I was a kid and I was put on so many antibiotics that my teeth rotted. They had to cut them out. So I never had baby teeth."[127]

While filming _Æon Flux_ in Berlin, Germany, Theron suffered a herniated disc in her neck, caused by a fall while filming a series of back handsprings. It required her to wear a neck brace for a month.[128] In July 2009, she was diagnosed with a serious stomach virus, thought to be contracted while overseas.[129][130] While filming _The Road_, Theron injured her vocal cords during the labour screaming scenes.[131]
