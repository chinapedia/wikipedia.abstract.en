Biography

Maxine Beneba Clarke was born and raised in the Sydney suburb of Kellyville.[11] Her mother was an actress of Guayanese heritage and her father an academic of Jamaican descent, who migrated to Australia from England in 1976.[12][13][14] She has said: "Cousins, aunts, and uncles of mine have settled all over the world: including in Germany, America, Switzerland, Australia, England, and Barbados. Mine is a complex migration history that spans four continents and many hundreds of years: a history that involves loss of land, loss of agency, loss of language, and loss, transformation, and reclamation of culture."[15]

Beneba Clarke attended school in Kellyville and Baulkham Hills,[16] before going on to earn a Bachelor of Creative Arts and Law degree[17] from the University of Wollongong.[18] She moved to Melbourne.[19]
