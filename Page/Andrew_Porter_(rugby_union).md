ANDREW PORTER (born 16 January 1996) is an Irish rugby union player for Leinster and Ireland. His preferred position is loosehead prop.


Career

He entered the Leinster academy in Summer 2016 and made his senior first team debut off the bench against Benetton Treviso in the first game of the season on 2 September.[1] He previously starred for the Ireland U20 team for two seasons, including being involved in their best ever result in the Junior World Championship in 2016, when they finished runners-up. He made twelve appearances and scored two tries over the two seasons of his involvement with the squad.[2]

Porter played rugby for St. Andrew's College, Dublin where he attended the school from 2008-2014.[3]

Porter is noted for his strength and power at such a young age - he can squat 350 kg (772 lb), making him already one of the strongest rugby players in the world aged just 20 and in his first year under professional contract.[4] Despite this, he is also noted for his surprising speed and mobility in the loose, as evidenced by his making a break and scoring a try from inside his own half in the 2015-16 season for UCD in the AIL League.[5]
