INGOGO is an Australian company that specialises in online taxi bookings and payments.[1] Cab drivers process fares using a customised mobile application on Android smartphones.[2] The company services Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney.[3][4]


Overview

The company has its own GPS-enable booking system, and allows any nearby taxi service to pick up a fare regardless of which taxi service they work for.[5] The company was the first transportation service company in Australia to provide riders with fixed fares, which included all tolls and charges, and no surge pricing or extra fees due to traffic jams.[6][7] Ingogo's system allows users to book a taxi up to two days in advance.[8] The company has focused on gaining corporate clients such as Qantas.[9]


History

In 2011, entrepreneur Hamish Petrie convinced Moshtix, a company Petrie founded in 2003 and later sold to News Digital Media in 2007, that his idea was workable.[10]

In May 2014, the company closed its internet-based tax receipt service when it was discovered that a security flaw enabled people to access information about clients, the last four digits of credit card numbers and taxi number plates.[11]

In 2015, Ingogo raised $12 million in a funding round that valued the company at $100 million. It claims to have raised more than $16 million in total from Australian investors.[12] More than $4 million came from crowdfunding alone, which was a record on the Australian equity-crowdfunding platform VentureCrowd.[13] The Australian Federal Government has also given the company a grant. Another investor was MYOB co-founder Brad Shofer.[14]

In December 2016, the company postponed plans for a float on the Australian Securities Exchange. It was reportedly considering preference shares or a rights issue in the short term.[15]
