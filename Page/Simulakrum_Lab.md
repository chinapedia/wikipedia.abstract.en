Simulakrum_Lab_2016_vinyl_record_cover.jpg SIMULAKRUM LAB[1][2] is an Italian synthwave/retrowave music project created by composer and sound designer [3] Paolo Prevosto.[4][5][6][7]

Guests who collaborated in the first album were:

-   Claudio Simonetti[8][9][10] (composer, together with Goblin, of many Dario Argento’s movies soundtracks) who was keyboard player in track "Aggregat 4";
-   Fabio Pignatelli[11] (bass player, former Goblin member, known for Profondo Rosso and Suspiria soundtracks) who played bass guitar in track "Backlit";
-   Kenneth Johnson[12][13] (maker, producer and director of many TV series, including _Visitors_, _Bionic Woman_, _The Incredible Hulk_ and _Alien Nation_) who was the voice in track "The Day The Vocoder Stood Still";
-   Liz Enthusiasm[14] (singer for the U.S.A. synth-pop band Freezepop[15] who performed vocals in "Quiet Girl" and "Far Worlds".

The first album[16][17][18] was produced and arranged by Paolo Prevosto in collaboration with the Italian electronic artist Eugene, who also performed lead vocals on many of the tracks.

The music project concept uses advanced research technology with 1970s sound paradigms, inspired by electronic music pioneers such as Kraftwerk, Goblin and Moroder. The tracks are based almost exclusively on original analog synthesizers from the 70s, Moog, Korg and Doepfer, avoiding as much as possible the use of emulated computer synthesizers. The core of Simulakrum Lab is the balance between old school electronic music and groundbreaking future sound engineering.

The first album also containing two songs inspired by lost cosmonauts, titled: "Lost Cosmonauts" (a radio transmission fiction) and "Far Worlds", the lyric recounts and describes the sensations of a cosmonaut aboard his space capsule during an orbital flight.

The first work made by Simulakrum Lab[19][20] was the remix of the song “Special Effects” by Freezepop[21] in 2012. Subsequently, they released the first album titled _Simulakrum Lab_ for the A5 label in 2013. In 2015 they made the remix of the track Killing[22][23][24][25] from Demons soundtrack by Claudio Simonetti for the 30th Anniversary[26][27][28] of the movie.[29] In the same year the track Backlit was used for the ending titles of the French movie Mantoson Biotechnology.[30]

In 2016 they released the Simulakrum Lab white vinyl published by Rustblade label.

[31][32][33] In May 2017 Simulakrum Lab aka [34][35][36] Paolo Prevosto remixed the track "Confusion" for the [37]Dario Argento's movie "Opera" Soundtrack 30th Anniversary composed by Claudio Simonetti released by Rustblade.
