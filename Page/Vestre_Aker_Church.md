VESTRE AKER CHURCH is a church at Ullevaal in Oslo that was consecrated in 1855. The church was at first named Aker Church, but was renamed to Vestre Aker Church in 1861.

The church is built in Neo Gothic style, drawn by architect Heinrich Ernst Schirmer. After the last restoration in 1969 it has about 500 seats. The pulpit was drawn by Alexis de Chateauneuf about 1850, and did originally appear in Oslo Cathedral. Stained glass windows are made by Bernhard Greve, center field in 1939 and the side windows in 1955. The church has a church organ with 27 voices. The bell tower contains two church bells.
