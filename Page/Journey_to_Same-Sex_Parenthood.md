_JOURNEY TO SAME-SEX PARENTHOOD_ is a nonfiction book by author and activist Eric Rosswood. The work focuses on adoption, foster care, assisted reproduction, surrogacy, and co-parenting advice for LGBT couples. The foreword is written by Melissa Gilbert and the introduction by Charlie Condou.


Background

Rosswood, also the author of children's book _My Uncle's Wedding_, adopted a child with his husband after researching different parenting options for almost two years. They researched the differences between adoption, foster care, and surrogacy, eventually deciding on adoption. Speaking of the experience, Rosswood stated, "We found tons of technical information out there from the perspective of agencies and professionals, but it was difficult to find information from the perspective of people who went through the journey themselves. What went well? What went wrong? Now that you’ve been through the journey, is there anything you would have done differently? What advice would you give to others? And I didn’t just want these answers for one parenting path; I wanted answers for all of them so we could compare and decide which would be best for our own family. I couldn’t find a resource like that so I asked people to help me create one."[1]

In an article for the _Huffington Post_, Rosswood wrote that he would like to "help LGBT people understand the pros and cons to the various paths to parenthood."[2] That project eventually resulted in _Journey to Same-Sex Parenthood: Firsthand Advice, Tips and Stories from Lesbian and Gay Couples_, which was released March 15, 2016.


Synopsis

The book is broken down into five main sections: adoption, foster care, assisted reproduction, surrogacy, and co-parenting. The real life experiences from 19 LGBT couples are included. Those couples came from the United States, the UK, Ireland, and South Africa.[3]

The book also includes "legal issues worthy of consideration and other critical information", which were contributed by the National Center for Lesbian Rights.[4]

Through real life experiences and passionate stories, this book is a true game changer. Once you've read it, I'm sure you'll be recommending it to everyone you know.”[8]
