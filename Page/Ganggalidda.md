The GANGGALIDA are an Indigenous Australian people who traditionally lived on the gulf coast west of :sv:Moonlight Creek and the Mingginda. Many of their descendants now dwell in and around Mungubie (Burketown) in northern Queensland.


Language

The Ganggalida spoke Yukulta, an extinct Tangkic language.


Ecology

The Ganggalida lived on the southern coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria, with the Garrwa people to their west, the Waanyi to their southwest, the Nguburinji to their south, and the Mingginda to the east.


Native Title

The Ganggalida are one of 4 groups who have placed native title claims to coastal areas in the southern Gulf of Carpentaria. The Ganggalida claim includes the area which was originally Mingginda territory, but to which the Ganggalida petitioners successfully maintained that they had a right to succession. In modern Ganggalida tales, by virtue of many of their forebears having shifted into the area since the late 19th century, the former Mingginda sites from Burketown south through the Albert River and the lower reaches of the Nicholson River have become part of their dreamtime creation narratives.
