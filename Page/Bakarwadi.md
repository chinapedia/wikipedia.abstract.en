BAKARWADI or BHĀKARWADI, is a traditional Marathi and Gujarati spicy snack, popular in Maharashtra, Gujarat. There are mainly two types of bhakarwadi, Maharashtrian bhakarwadi of Pune, Gujarati bhakarwadi of Vadodara (Baroda). It is widely available in the markets of Pune, Maharashtra, Vadodara (Baroda), Gujarat.[1] It is made from gram flour dough made into spirals stuffed with a mixture of coconut, poppy seeds and sesame seeds. It is then fried until it gets crispy. It can be stored for weeks[2] and enjoyed as an evening snack.[3] It was popularized by Raghunathrao Chitale, a Marathi businessman, through the brand Chitale Bandhu.[4] Bhakarwadi is a beloved Maharashtrian snack, but its origins lie in Gujarat — it is a popular addition on the Farsan menu, adding crunch and a warming, spicy-sweetness to the menu. It reached Maharashtrian plates in a big way though, when Raghunathrao Chitale first tasted the little snack, in 1970.
