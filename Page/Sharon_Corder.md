Biography

Early life and education

Born in Waco, Texas into a military family, Corder moved across the American Southwest according to her father's deployments, including Hawaii and Japan. She trained in theatre at the University of California at Davis.

Career

In the mid-1970s, Corder moved to Vancouver to pursue a theatrical career. There, she founded the Genesis Company Theatre,[1] playing leading roles as an actor in travelling productions across Canada. In 1985, she met and began working with Jack Blum, who would become her co-writer and co-producer on Canadian television series like _Traders, Catwalk,_ and ''Power Play. '' In 1998, Corder and Blum wrote and produced _Babyface_, which premiered at the Directorâ€™s Fortnight in Cannes.[2]

Charity work

In 2005, Corder and Blum founded Reel Canada, an educational program entitled "Our Films in Our Schools" aimed at promoting Canadian film in high schools. The initiative has since spawned "Welcome to Canada," a Canadian film summit for newcomers to Canada, and "National Canadian Film Day," a one-day country-wide celebration of Canadian film with local screening partners in every province and territory. Corder is the Artistic Director of Reel Canada.
