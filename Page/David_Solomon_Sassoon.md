David_Solomon_Sassoon,_London.jpg DAVID SOLOMON SASSOON (1880–1942) (also known as "David Suleiman Sassoon"), was a bibliophile and grandson of 19th Baghdadi Jewish community leader David Sassoon.

Sassoon travelled extensively with the sole intent of collecting Hebrew books and manuscripts which he later catalogued in a two-volume book, entitled, _Ohel David_. The vast importance of his private collection of books and manuscripts cannot be overestimated, since it affords scholars the opportunity to examine some twenty-four distinct liturgical rites used by the different Jewish communities of the nineteenth century: Aleppo, Ashkenazi, Egyptian, Italian, North African (Morocco), Tunis, Tlemcen, Karaite, Sefardi (Spanish), Bene Israel, Cochin, Turkish, Yemen, among others.[1]

David Solomon Sassoon originally owned some 412 manuscripts and twenty incunables, the rarest of which he retrieved from Baghdad. By 1914, the Sassoon collection numbered 500 manuscripts. Between 1914 and 1932, when the Catalogue was published, the manuscripts grew to 1,220, of which 1,153 are fully described in the Catalogue. When David and his mother visited the Holy Land in 1925, he acquired the _Decisions of Rabbi Isaiah ben Mali di Trani the Elder_ (thirteenth century) on _Hullin_ (MS No. 702, Cat. p. 697).[2] One of the more important manuscripts obtained by him is _Sefer Halakhot Pesuḳot_ of Rabbi Yehudai Gaon, a work that he obtained from a Jew in Yemen in 1911, but written in Babylon or Persia in the ninth or tenth century.[3] Sassoon also obtained in Yemen a hand-written copy of Maimonides' _Guide for the Perplexed_, written in Spain in the fourteenth century (1397).[4]

Perhaps the most prized of Sassoon's acquisitions is the _Farhi Bible_, a codex which he purchased in Aleppo. It is said to have been written by Elisha Crescas in Provence between the years 1366 and 1383. It is now kept in a bank vault in Switzerland.[5] Another treasure retrieved by Sassoon is the _Damascus Pentateuch_, a codex which he bought in Damascus in 1915, and which was acquired by the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem in 1975. A particularly significant acquisition in September 1923 was the _Diwan of Samuel Hanagid_ (MS No. 589, Cat. pp. 451–460), which the Oxford University Press published with an introduction by Sassoon in 1924.[6] Samuel ha-Levi b. Joseph ibn Nagrela (993-1056) died ten years before the Norman Conquest of England.

Many of the manuscripts and incunabula collected by David Sassoon were auctioned by Sotheby's of London in Zurich and in New York, between the years 1975 - 1994, in order to satisfy the Sassoon estate's British tax obligations.[7] Today, most of what remains of David Solomon Sassoon's private collection of Hebrew manuscripts is stored at the University of Toronto, in Canada, although a small cluster of manuscripts from the estate of David Solomon Sassoon are now at the British Library, which were either offered to the library in lieu of tax, or were purchased at Sotheby's auction sales in the 1970s.[8]

His son, Solomon David Sassoon (1915–1985), was an educator, Rabbi, philanthropist and fundraiser, and also a collector of Jewish manuscripts.
