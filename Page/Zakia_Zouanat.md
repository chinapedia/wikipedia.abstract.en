ZAKIA ZOUANAT (1957 – 30 August 2012) was a Moroccan anthropologist. A researcher at the Institute of African Studies at Mohammed V University, she was an expert in Moroccan Sufism.[1][2]. Her research concerned biographic accounts of important Sufi figures in the 12th to 13th centuries. Zouanat sought to bridge Moroccans educated in French who accessed their religions through Arabic texts.[3] As evidenced by her commentary on the Delos Initiative[4], she actively sought to promulgate the protection of pilgrimage sites important to Moroccan Sufis, as well as provide context for economic and cultural relevance.
