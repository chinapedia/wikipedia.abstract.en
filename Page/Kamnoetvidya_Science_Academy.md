History

Kamnoetvidya Science Academy with the former name of Rayong Science Academy (RASA) was founded in 2013. The name Kamnoetvidya which literally means “The Genesis of Knowledge” was given by Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn who on 6 August 2015 presided over the grand opening ceremony of the school. Kamnoetvidya Science Academy is supported by the RASA foundation with an endowment fund provided by the PTT Public Company Limited Group of Companies to ensure sustainability, prosperity, and longevity of the academy. The conception of Kamnoetvidya Science Academy was the result of a farsighted vision and a cumulated passion of Dr. Pailin Chuchottaworn, then the chief executive officer (CEO) and president of PTT Public Company Limited, who wishes to see Thailand emerge as a strong power in Science and Technology.

Meanwhile, Dr. Thongchai continues to contribute as Principal Emeritus.
