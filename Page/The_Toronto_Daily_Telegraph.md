_THE TORONTO DAILY TELEGRAPH_ was a conservative newspaper founded by John Ross Robertson in 1866 after he left _The Globe_, a Liberal-leaning paper, to establish a Conservative-leaning paper.[1]

Launched on May 21, 1866, it initially ran a daily and evening version and was a pro-British voice against increasing American influence a year before Confederation.[2]

The paper was never profitable and debt led to the folding of the morning edition in May 1872.[3] The paper's debt woes continued; unable to obtain financial support from the Conservative elite in Toronto, the broadsheet folded in June 1872.[4][5]

Robertson returned to _The Globe_ and later established the successor to the _Telegraph_, _Toronto Telegram_, in 1876.
