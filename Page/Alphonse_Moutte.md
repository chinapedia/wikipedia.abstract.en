He did, in fact, work in that capacity for several years, but decided to become a full-time artist and went to Paris to work in the studios of Ernest Meissonier. His first exhibit at the Salon came in 1869, winning medals in 1881 and 1882.

He soon became a prominent personality and his works could be seen in galleries throughout Provence. He continued to exhibit at the Salon until his death. He was awarded a silver medal at the Exposition Universelle (1889) and a bronze medal at the Exposition Universelle (1900). Among his best-known students were Jean-Baptiste Olive and the sculptor, Ary Bitter.

He was a good friend of Frédéric Mistral and participated in the activities of the Félibrige. In 1892, he was elected a member of the Académie de Marseille and, in 1893, became a Chevalier in the Legion of Honor. A street in Marseille has been named after him.[2]
