Loans at Home is the UK's third-largest provider of home credit (home-collected personal loans), and of Everyday Loans, a branch-based provider of unsecured consumer loans.[1][2]


History

NSF was established in February 2015 by John van Kuffeler, who ran home credit group Provident Financial for 22 years before retiring in December 2013.[3] The firm was formed with £48m backing from a group of investors.[4] NSF was listed on the London Stock Exchange in February 2015 as a cash shell, raising £100m for the acquisition of existing short-term consumer finance companies.[5]

In August 2015, the firm acquired Loansathome4u, the home credit arm of finance group S&U, for £82.5m.[6]

In December 2015, the firm acquired Everyday Loans (a branch-based lending chain owned by Secure Trust Bank) for £235m.[7] The transaction was funded by bank debt along with £160m in new equity finance.[8]

NSF declared its first interim dividend in August 2016.[9]

NSF operates in three main areas of consumer lending: home credit, guaranteed loans and branch-based unsecured lending.[10] Through Loans at Home (previously Loansathome4u), it serves approximately 98,000 customers from 40 branches in England, Wales and Scotland; and through Everyday Loans a further 37,000 customers from approximately 40 branches in the UK.[11][12]
