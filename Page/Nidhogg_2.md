_NIDHOGG 2_ is a fighting game and sequel to _Nidhogg_ by indie developer Messhof. It was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS and PlayStation 4 in 2017. A Nintendo Switch version was released in November 2018. The game received generally positive reviews from critics upon release.


Gameplay

_Nidhogg 2_ is a fighting game in which two player duel against each other. The player has to reach the end of their opponent's side first wins. Players have a variety of moves, including sliding and leaping. They can deflect their opponents' attacks. Weapons, such as daggers, throwing knives and bows, as well as a character creator, are introduced.[1]


Development

The title was announced in September 2016 and demonstrated at the 2016 TwitchCon and 2017 Electronic Entertainment Expo Indie Megabooth. It was released on August 15, 2017, on macOS, PlayStation 4, and Microsoft Windows platforms. A Nintendo Switch version is scheduled for release on November 22, 2018.[2] Unlike the original game, which features a minimalistic artstyle, the game's creator Mark Essen and artist Toby Dixon decided to use a more detailed graphical style with a higher resolution so as to reflect the game's increased depth. Another reason for the change is that Essen considered _Nidhogg 2_ a "spectator game". The artstyle allowed spectators to have more things to look at when they were watching the gameplay.[3]


Reception

The game received "generally favorable" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. _GamesMaster_ said it was "An excellent sword-fighting game that at times has trouble remembering its brilliant roots." _Game Informer_ said, "Though it doesn’t add much for players looking to play around with its improvements solo, _Nidhogg 2_ adds layers of depth to a simple formula without breaking what made it so appealing in the first place." _Destructoid_ said, "It has expanded on the wonderful mechanics of the original and has one of the best soundtracks in recent memory. There isn't much content here for the solo player, but if you've got friends coming over for some friendly competition, the night would not be complete without _Nidhogg 2_." _PlayStation Official Magazine – UK_ said it had "wicked local multiplayer appeal", while _GamesTM_ said it was "Fast, intense, but flawed".

The game was nominated for "Best Fighting Game" and "Best Multiplayer" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards.[4][5]
