History

Tugthusporten.jpg from 1757]] Trompetergade_(Gedde).jpg from 1757]] The street had existed since the Middle Ages but was formerly known under different names. The street section from Amagertorv to Valkendorfsgade was called Lille Helliggeiststræde (Little Holy Ghost Street) after the adjacent church. )t was a very narrow alley. The inclusion of "Little" in the name distinguished it from Store Helliggeiststræde ("Large Holy Ghost Street") as Valkendorfsgade was then called.

The section present-day Niels Hemmingsens Gade which runs from Gråbrødretorv to Skindergade was called Trompetergangen or Trompetergade after Ambrosius Løffelman Trompeter who owned a property at the site.[1]

The short section from Valkendorfsgade to Gråbrødretorv(Løvgade was called Tugthusporten (Jailhouse Gate) after a Children's jail established at the site by Christian IV before moving to Christianshavn but soon moved to Christianshavn (see Women's Prison, Christianshavn.[2] It was a narrow, vaulted passageway which ran through a building. The building had six window bays along the square and two window bays across the street.[3]

Lille_Helliggejststræde.jpg Tugthusporten was merged into Lille Helliggeiststræde in 1843 after complains from the residents who found the name unappealing. Trompetergade was renamed Store Helliggeiststræde.In 1881, the entire street was renamed Niels Hemmingsens Stræde to commemorate the theologian Niels Hemmingsen.

The churchyard was originally surrounded by a low wall. It was demolished and replaced by an iron fence in 17979.[4]
