ALUCHIN is a volcano along the Aluchin River in the Chukotka of Russia. The volcano was discovered in 1956â€“1957 by G.K. Kleshchev.[1]

The volcano is formed by three cones, named Alpha, Beta and Gamma, which occur along a fissure. Alpha, the main cone, formed within a river valley. It is high and has a diameter of . A crater wide and deep caps the cone. Beta, a smaller cone formed by lava and scoria, grew on the southeastern side of Alpha. It ejected lava bombs with sizes of up to that landed in the surrounding valleys. Beta is partially degraded, high and has a wide crater. Gamma is formed by agglomerates. Because the poorly indurated agglomerates are subject to rapid erosion the cone's structure has been heavily degraded. It is high with no recognizable crater and a base size of .

Volcanic activity has generated lava flows that fill a valley. These flows cover a surface area of and reach a length of . The total volume reached by the flows is , or more. Part of the lava flowed down into the valley of the Aluchin River, reaching a length of upvalley. These lava flows may be dependent on fissure eruptions along the fault rather than the cones. The eruption of the lava disrupted the river courses of the Aluchin and Burgakhchan rivers. Later the Aluchin River cut a deep gorge in the lava flow, exposing columnar basalts. The eruptions of the Beta and Gamma lava flows apparently occurred in three distinct events.

Volcanic rocks erupted by the Aluchin volcanic cones include basalts with glass-, pumice- and scoria-like consistency. Granodiorite blocks are found as xenoliths. The lava flows contain olivine, ilmenite and magnetite. The rocks of the volcano are of trachybasalt-basalt composition, being a typical continental Asia alkaline series. Their formation was influenced by pyroxene fractionation.[2]

The volcano is located in part of the Anyuy area where a fault dating back possibly to the Paleozoic cuts the terrain. Paleozoic and possibly Proterozoic rocks crop out at the sides of the fault. A number of volcanic rocks, both effusive and intrusive ones, are associated with the fault and go as far back as the Devonian.

The lava flows of the Beta and Gamma cones apparently formed first. An age of 1000 CE was estimated for the volcanoes, on the basis of the timespan estimated for the development of soil on the lava flows and the growth of trees on them. This makes Aluchin one of the few continental Asian volcanoes with activity during the Holocene. The formation of the Alpha cone was characterized by an alternation of explosive and effusive activity.

The Anyuy volcano lies farther north.[3]
