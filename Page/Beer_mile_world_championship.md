The FLOTRACK BEER MILE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP was an annual beer mile competition that took place in Austin, Texas between 2014 and 2016 that was sponsored by Flotrack, a running-focused media company.

On December 1, 2015 at the second annual World Championship, Canadian Lewis Kent set a new world record with a time of 4:47.17 [1]

The third annual World Championship was be held on December 17, 2016. Flotrack cancelled the event in 2017, citing internal budget concerns.[2]


Race Details

The event took place annually in Downtown Austin at the Austin American Statesman headquarters. Originally scheduled for Yellow Jacket Stadium in Austin, community leaders grew concerned (it is a high school football stadium), and the venue for the first race was moved to Circuit of the Americas, where a makeshift quarter mile oval on the pit straight was formed for the inaugural race. Since the 2015 race, the event has been held in Downtown Austin.

The event is broken down into several different fields. The men's and women's elite fields feature some of the top beer milers in the world. There is also a semi-elite field. Both the elite fields and semi-elite fields require qualification times to enter. There are also open fields open to the first 300 entrants.

The event typically draws crowds in the thousands.

The winner of the men's and women's elite fields receives $5,000.[3]
