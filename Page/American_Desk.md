The AMERICAN DESK is a prospective office for trade deals at the White House announced by president-elect Donald Trump in October 2016.[1][2] Mr. Trump said he intends to merge bureaux for trade policy in the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the United States Department of Commerce and other agencies with a new Office of Trade, which will report to the American Desk.[3] The aim of the American Desk is to fold layers of inefficient bureaucracy,[4] and prevent the delocalization of US corporate entities who employ US citizens.[5]
