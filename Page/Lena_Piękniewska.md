Feminism

She is a member of the Polish feminist punk group which combines lyrical ballads with contemporary protest songs. In an interview she states that the group comments on current political situation in Poland and that it has appeal to _girls of all ages who come to us and for whom our performances are of value and who can laugh at what is difficult, terrifying, fearful and painful_. The group publishes their own CDs.

Jewish traces

Her songs from the album Lullabies for the eternal sleep were written by her and inspired by the traditional Jewish music. Critic notes that she can bring room to total silence when singing her songs, for example the one about Jewish political and social activist Mark Edelman's mural, for which the home association wanted money to be displayed on their house. The reviewer of her _Pół na pół_ concert states that she is well known artists [..] whose music, while rather modest, is devoid of fireworks, and is revealing what's most important - the truth. Another critic notes that the _most special concert_ was _Lullabies for eternal sleep_ dedicated to a vanished Jewish district in Poznań where _the synagogue was transformed into a swimming pool_. She was a star guest during the memorial days for Holocaust victims at a gala concert in Łódź where she presented works written by the young poets from Jewish ghettos in Poland. Her 2016 project is called _Coś przyjdzie: miłość lub wojna (Something will come - love or war)_. It is a tribute to children's poetry from the time of Holocaust including poems by Abraham Koplowicz, Zuzanna Ginczanka, Janka Hescheles, and Abraham Cytryn. It premiered in 2016 during the Festival of Jewish Culture in Warsaw. These projects are unique in Poland in which large population of Jewelry vanished in the Holocaust.
