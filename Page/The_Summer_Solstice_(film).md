Synopsis

HuYang arrives in Beijing in a hot summer to make his fortune but his company goes broke, and he becomes a monk to beg for alms. He meets his sister-in-law YangHua, and while looking for his younger brother HuTao, they get into a relationship. Soon after, they receive news that HuYang's father has passed away and return to their ancestral home. However their dubious relationship proves scandalous and the whole family has a serious meeting to solve the problem. It ends with YangHua's pregnancy and the whole family agrees to their marriage. After the short, happy marriage, however, HuYang's dreams beckon once more and he leaves for Beijing again. Months later, he comes back home again on a hot summer night – the same hot weather as it is in Beijing.[2][3]
