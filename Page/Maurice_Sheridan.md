MAURICE SHERIDAN (born 1974) is an Irish retired Gaelic footballer. His league and championship career with the Mayo senior team lasted nine seasons from 1995 until 2003.[1]

Sheridan made his debut on the inter-county scene when he was picked for the Mayo under-21 team. He won back-to-back Connacht medals in this grade, however, an All-Ireland medal remained elusive. Sheridan made his senior debut during the 1995 championship. He was a regular on the starting fifteen over much of the next decade and won three Connacht medals and one National Football League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions.
