GOODMARK FOODS, INC. is an American food manufacturing company, based in Raleigh, North Carolina.[1][2] It produces "meat snacks, packaged meats, and extruded grain snacks,"[3] especially Slim Jim jerky meat snacks.[4] It is owned by ConAgra.[5]


Company history

Slim Jim snacks originated in Philadelphia.[6] Its manufacturer Cherry-Levis Food Company was sold to General Mills in 1967 for about $20 million[7] and renamed Slim Jim, Inc.[8] In 1970, General Mills purchased Jesse Jones Sausage Co. in Garner, North Carolina, and formed GoodMark Foods, Inc. to make Slim Jims there.[9] Ron Doggett, a General Mills finance executive involved in the purchase of Cherry-Levis, had moved to North Carolina to participate in managing the operations. "In June 1982, he directed a unique leveraged buyout with three other executives of GoodMark from General Mills, who had put the subsidiary up for sale."[10] They took the company public in 1985.[11] The company's stock was traded on NASDAQ as GDMK.[12]

It was acquired by ConAgra, Inc. in 1998[13] for $225 million.[14] GoodMark's annual sales were about $170 million at that time.[15] Doggett retired as chairman, president and CEO in 1999, a year later.[16][17]
