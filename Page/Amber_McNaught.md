AMBER MCNAUGHT is a British blogger, author and journalist. She is best known for her fashion blogs and for discovering[1] Susan Boyle years before she gained fame on Britain's Got Talent.


Early history

After graduating from the University of Edinburgh in the late nineties with a Masters in English Literature McNaught started working as an editorial assistant for the West Lothian Courier which is part of the Mirror group. After a short while, McNaught moved to a full-time reporting role for the West Lothian Herald & Post (owned by Johnston Press). Over a period of years, McNaught achieved numerous by-lines and front pages. One of the more famous articles was the 'discovery' of Susan Boyle in which McNaught reviewed the first album that Susan Boyle ever sang on.[2] After the _Herald & Post_ production was downsized, McNaught moved to a role in public relations with West Lothian Council which was her final job before moving into the field of online publishing with the formation of her publishing company Hot Igloo Productions Ltd.


Freelancing

In the early 2000s, McNaught freelanced for a number of organisations including _The Scotsman_, _The Edinburgh Evening News_, _Scotland on Sunday_ and _Glenmorangie_. In the field of blogging, McNaught wrote regularly for the now defunct[3] Shiny Media. During this period, McNaught founded her first fashion blogs.


Blogging

McNaught now runs two of her own websites. As of 2017, her websites have amassed over 45 million page views.

_ForeverAmber_ is McNaught's principal website and is a mix of fashion and lifestyle blogging. ForeverAmber is one of the most popular personal style blogs in the United Kingdom and has been consistently rated as a top UK fashion blog.[4][5][6][7] McNaught is well known for her large collection of shoes and was interviewed on the Vanessa Feltz Show, as well as being featured in multiple publications including: Office Magazine,[8] Essentials Magazine,[9] Company Magazine,[10] Boden Style Guide,[11] YouLookFab,[12] ASOS,[13] House of Fraser[14] and She Magazine[15]

_Shoeperwoman_ was founded in 2009 and is primarily focused on the appreciation of female fashion and shoes. In its early days it was subject to litigation by DC Comics who argued that Shoeperwoman's logo was too similar to the Superman logo. After some small changes to the logo DC Comics withdrew their legal action and McNaught was able trademark her brand name Shoeperwoman[16] without objection.


Book writing

McNaught's piece on The Famous Five[17] was also published in TWiTTERTiTTERS as part of a fundraising drive for Comic Relief.

In July 2016, McNaught released her first book _My Blogging Secrets_, which as of November 2016 has only had positive reviews.[18][19][20]

In 2017, McNaught was commissioned by The Quarto Group to write and help produce an illustrated guide to capsule wardrobes called _Closet Essentials_.[21] The book was released in October 2017.

McNaught is working on an autobiographical book due to be released in 2019.
