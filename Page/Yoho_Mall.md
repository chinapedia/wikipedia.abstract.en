YOHO MALL is a shopping centre in Yuen Long, New Territories, Hong Kong. It is part of Sun Hung Kai Properties's "Yoho" housing development. [1]


History

The YOHO Midtown mall was finished in October 2010. It was planned to be opened in 2013. However, after the completion of the second phase of YOHO, the developers hope to enhance the attractiveness of the shopping malls through the renovation of the nearby Sun Yuen Long Centre. According to the Rating and Valuation Department, this will attract several extra hundred million dollars of revenue in terms of rent.[2] Sun Hung Kai Properties announced that YOHO City Shopping Center will be combined with New Yuen Long Center Shopping Center to become a new YOHO development. The renovation of YOHO Midtown mall started on October 15, 2013.
