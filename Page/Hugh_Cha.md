He became president of the Breakdance Club (2005-2007), joined the professional dance troop “Ground Hounds Crew”[9] and was given the nickname “Bboy Handsome Hugh” because of his dance fashion.[10] Cha performed and competed with the dance crew, and hosted multi-state hip-hop events with thousands of attendees.

The "Ground Hounds Crew" was previously known as the "Junk Yard Dogs (JYD)". As "Handsome Hugh", Cha starred in a breakdancing spec commercial for Novell.[11]

According to News of Oklahoma, "Yoon Jeong Seong and Hugh Cha are nicely matched as Tuptim and Lun Tha, the Burmese lovers whose fate ultimately rests in the King's hands. Seong, in tandem with Cha, is mesmerizing in 'We Kiss in a Shadow' and 'I Have Dreamed.'"[17]

In June 2014, Cha played 'Luke' in North Shore Music Theatre's production of _Anything Goes_.[18] His comical bits within the production as a supporting cast member were noted by local news outlets.[19][20]

The short play is based on a young Chinese couple in a long-distance relationship, with one in China and the other in the U.S.[22] The performance was part of the Theater Masters MFA Playwrights Festival in 2015,[23] which featured several short plays published by Samuel French.

In January 2017, Hugh Cha portrayed an ensemble cast role of 'Steve' in _Blueprint Specials_ at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum on the interior hanger deck of a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier that served during World War II, the Cold War, and the Vietnam War. The production centers on a collection of lost Frank Loesser musicals commissioned by the U.S. Army during WWII and is part of the Public Theater's Under the Radar Festival.[24]

Cha played both clarinet and saxophone instruments as band member 'Abraham' in the NYC musical _Sweetee_, which centers on the power of music in 1930s America.[25] The limited Off-Broadway play ran from June 1–18, 2017 and was directed by Emmy-winner and Tony-nominee Patricia Birch.

In 2016, Cha appeared in several TV series and short films. He played the lead role of Yushin in _The Destined King_,[30] a Korean short film that follows the story of a veteran warrior as he flees from the carnage of political chaos with an infant born with the destiny of a king. The film received an Honorable Mention in the "Best Action/Adventure" category at the Asians on Film Festival in the summer of 2015,[31] and won an award for "Best Short Film" at the Urban Action Showcase International Film Festival (UAS IAFF) in 2015.[32]

He also co-starred in FX Networks' _The Americans_,[33] a show about two KGB spies in an arranged marriage posing as Americans during Ronald Reagan's presidency, as well as HBO’s series _Crashing_ in 2017,[34] which is about a New York comic who is forced to make a new start for himself after his wife leaves him.
