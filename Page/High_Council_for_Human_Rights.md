HIGH COUNCIL FOR HUMAN RIGHTS () is the governmental national human rights institution of Iran, subdivision to the Judiciary of Iran.[1]


Positions

The council rejects and condemns appointment of Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran by United Nations[2] and strongly opposes the western countries' positions about current human rights situation in Iran. It also assumes the “true face” of human rights should be sought through Islam.[3]

The council has challenged laws against Holocaust denial, spread of Islamophobia, forced unveiling in schools, specifically in France as being against human rights.[4]
