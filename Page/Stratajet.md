History

Stratajet launched in April 2016[5][6] via Stratajet.com and an iOS app.[7] It offers firm-bookable fares for private jets, rather than quotes or estimates.[8]

The company was founded in 2011 by former military officer and pilot Jonathan Nicol. It took him five years to develop the technology needed to calculate the cost of a private jet without manual input.[9]

Stratajet partners with international aircraft operators, including Centreline[10], ASL JetNetherlands[11], and Fixed Base Operators such as Jetex Flight Support[12] and TAG Aviation[13] to deliver its services to customers.

In May 2016, Stratajet received an $8 million round of funding, led by Octopus Ventures,[14] bringing total investment in the platform to $14 million[15].

In May 2017, Stratajet won The Sapphire Pegasus Award in the “Aircraft Broker” category.[16]

In May 2017, Stratajet was included in "The Leap 100 2017", an annual list published in City A.M., identifying the UK's most exciting and fastest growing companies.[17]

Stratajet ranked fifth in the "Deloitte Tech Fast 50 2017"[18][19] (an acknowledgement of the 50 fastest-growing technology companies in the UK),[20] with a growth rate of 3,634% over four years. In April 2018, the company ranked 22nd in The FT 1000, a list published by the Financial Times that ranks Europe’s fastest-growing companies[21].
