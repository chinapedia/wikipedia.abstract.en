PATRICIA LEE SMITH (born December 30, 1946)[1] is an American singer-songwriter, musician, author, and poet who became an influential component of the New York City punk rock movement with her 1975 debut album _Horses_.[2]

Called the "punk poet laureate," Smith fused rock and poetry in her work. Her most widely known song is "Because the Night," which was co-written with Bruce Springsteen. It reached number 13 on the _Billboard_ Hot 100 chart in 1978[3] and number five in the U.K. In 2005, Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture.[4] In 2007, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[5]

On November 17, 2010, Smith won the National Book Award for her memoir _Just Kids_.[6] The book fulfilled a promise she had made to her former long-time roommate and partner, Robert Mapplethorpe. She placed 47th in _Rolling Stone_ magazine's list of 100 Greatest Artists published in December 2010[7] and was also a recipient of the 2011 Polar Music Prize.


Life and career

1946–1967: Early life

Patricia Lee Smith was born in Chicago[8] to Beverly Smith, a jazz singer turned waitress, and Grant Smith, who worked as a machinist at a Honeywell plant.[9] The family was of part-Irish ancestry[10] and Patti was the eldest of four children. At the age of 4, Smith's family moved from Chicago to Germantown, Philadelphia,[11] before heading to Pitman, New Jersey[12] and later to The Woodbury Gardens section of Deptford Township, New Jersey.[13][14]

At this early age Smith was exposed to her first records, including _Shrimp Boats_ by Harry Belafonte, Patience and Prudence's _The Money Tree_, and _Another Side of Bob Dylan_, which her mother gave to her. Smith graduated from Deptford Township High School in 1964 and went to work in a factory.[15][16] She gave birth to her first child, a daughter, on April 26, 1967, and chose to place her for adoption.[17]

1967–1973: New York

In 1967, she left Glassboro State College (now Rowan University) and moved to Manhattan. She met photographer Robert Mapplethorpe there while working at a bookstore with friend and poet Janet Hamill. She and Mapplethorpe had an intense romantic relationship, which was tumultuous as the pair struggled with times of poverty, and Mapplethorpe with his own sexuality. Smith considers Mapplethorpe to be one of the most important people in her life, and in her book _Just Kids_ refers to him as "the artist of my life." Mapplethorpe's photographs of her became the covers for the Patti Smith Group albums, and they remained friends until Mapplethorpe's death in 1989.[18] Her book and album The Coral Sea would be an homage to the life of Mapplethorpe and Just Kids would tell the story of their relationship. She would also write essays for several of Mapplethorpe's books, starting from one, at his request, for his posthumous _Flowers_.[19]

She went to Paris with her sister in 1969, and started busking and doing performance art.[20] When Smith returned to Manhattan, she lived in the Hotel Chelsea with Mapplethorpe; they frequented Max's Kansas City and CBGB. Smith provided the spoken word soundtrack for Sandy Daley's art film _Robert Having His Nipple Pierced_, starring Mapplethorpe. The same year Smith appeared with Wayne County in Jackie Curtis's play _Femme Fatale_. Afterward, she also starred in Tony Ingrassia's play _Island_. As a member of the St. Mark's Poetry Project, she spent the early 1970s painting, writing, and performing. In 1971 she performed – for one night only – in _Cowboy Mouth_,[21] a play that she co-wrote with Sam Shepard. (The published play's notes call for "a man who looks like a coyote and a woman who looks like a crow".) She wrote several poems, "for sam shepard"[22] and "Sam Shepard: 9 Random Years (7 + 2)"[23] about her relationship with Shepard.

Smith was briefly considered for the lead singer position in Blue Öyster Cult. She contributed lyrics to several of the band's songs, including "Debbie Denise" (inspired by her poem "In Remembrance of Debbie Denise"), "Baby Ice Dog", "Career of Evil", "Fire of Unknown Origin", "The Revenge of Vera Gemini" (on which she performs duet vocals), and "Shooting Shark". She was romantically involved at the time with the band's keyboardist, Allen Lanier. During these years, Smith also wrote rock journalism pieces, some of which were published in _Rolling Stone_ and _Creem_.[24]

1974–1979: Patti Smith Group

, 1978]] By 1974, Patti Smith was performing rock music, initially with guitarist, bassist and rock archivist Lenny Kaye, and later with a full band comprising Kaye, Ivan Kral on guitar and bass, Jay Dee Daugherty on drums and Richard Sohl on piano. Kral was a refugee from Czechoslovakia who had moved to the United States in 1966 with his parents, who were diplomats. After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, he decided not to return.[25] Financed by Sam Wagstaff, the band recorded a first single, "Hey Joe / Piss Factory", in 1974. The A-side was a version of the rock standard with the addition of a spoken word piece about fugitive heiress Patty Hearst ("Patty Hearst, you're standing there in front of the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread, I was wondering were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women ...").[26] A court later heard that Hearst had been confined against her will, and had been repeatedly threatened with execution and raped.[27] The B-side describes the helpless anger Smith had felt while working on a factory assembly line and the salvation she discovered in the form of a shoplifted book, the 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud's _Illuminations_.[28] In a 1996 interview which discusses artistic influences during her younger years, Smith said, "I had devoted so much of my girlish daydreams to Rimbaud. Rimbaud was like my boyfriend."[29]

Later that same year, she performed spoken poetry on "I Wake Up Screaming" from Ray Manzarek's _The Whole Thing Started with Rock & Roll Now It's Out of Control_ album.

The Patti Smith Group was signed by Clive Davis of Arista Records, and in 1975 recorded their first album, _Horses_, produced by John Cale amid some tension. The album fused punk rock and spoken poetry and begins with a cover of Van Morrison's "Gloria", and Smith's opening words: "Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine" (an excerpt from "Oath", one of her early poems). The austere cover photograph by Mapplethorpe has become one of rock's classic images.[30] As the popularity of punk rock grew, Patti Smith Group toured the United States and Europe. The rawer sound of the group's second album, _Radio Ethiopia_, reflected this. Considerably less accessible than _Horses_, _Radio Ethiopia_ initially received poor reviews. However, several of its songs have stood the test of time, and Smith still performs them regularly in concert.[31] She has said that _Radio Ethiopia_ was influenced by the band MC5.[32]

On January 23, 1977, while touring in support of _Radio Ethiopia_, Smith accidentally danced off a high stage in Tampa, Florida, and fell 15 feet into a concrete orchestra pit, breaking several neck vertebrae.[33]

The injury required a period of rest and an intensive round of physical therapy, during which time she was able to reassess, re-energize and reorganize her life. Patti Smith Group produced two further albums before the end of the 1970s. _Easter_ (1978) was her most commercially successful record, containing the single "Because the Night" co-written with Bruce Springsteen. _Wave_ (1979) was less successful, although the songs "Frederick" and "Dancing Barefoot" both received commercial airplay.[34]

1980–1995: Marriage

gala]] Before the release of _Wave_, Smith, now separated from long-time partner Allen Lanier, met Fred "Sonic" Smith, former guitar player for Detroit rock band MC5 and his own Sonic's Rendezvous Band, who adored poetry as much as she did. _Wave_{{'}}s "Dancing Barefoot" (inspired by Jeanne Hébuterne and her tragic love for Amedeo Modigliani) and "Frederick" were both dedicated to him.[35] The running joke at the time was that she married Fred only because she would not have to change her name.[36] They had a son, Jackson (b. 1982) who would go on to marry The White Stripes drummer, Meg White in 2009;[37] and a daughter, Jesse (b. 1987).

Through most of the 1980s Smith was in semi-retirement from music, living with her family north of Detroit in St. Clair Shores, Michigan. In June 1988, she released the album _Dream of Life_, which included the song "People Have the Power". Fred Smith died on November 4, 1994, of a heart attack. Shortly afterward, Patti faced the unexpected death of her brother Todd.[38]

When her son Jackson turned 14, Smith decided to move back to New York. After the impact of these deaths, her friends Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Allen Ginsberg (whom she had known since her early years in New York) urged her to go back out on the road. She toured briefly with Bob Dylan in December 1995 (chronicled in a book of photographs by Stipe).[39]

1996–2003: Re-emergence

In 1996, Smith worked with her long-time colleagues to record _Gone Again,_ featuring "About a Boy", a tribute to Kurt Cobain. That same year she collaborated with Stipe on "E-Bow the Letter", a song on R.E.M.'s _New Adventures in Hi-Fi,_ which she has also performed live with the band.[40] After the release of _Gone Again,_ Patti Smith recorded two new albums: _Peace and Noise_ in 1997 (with the single "1959", about the invasion of Tibet) and _Gung Ho_ in 2000 (with songs about Ho Chi Minh and Smith's late father). Songs "1959" and "Glitter in Their Eyes" were nominated for Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance.[41] A box set of her work up to that time, _The Patti Smith Masters,_ came out in 1996, and 2002 saw the release of _Land (1975–2002),_ a two-CD compilation that includes a cover of Prince's "When Doves Cry". Smith's solo art exhibition _Strange Messenger_ was hosted at The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh on September 28, 2002.[42]

2004–2009

On April 27, 2004, Patti Smith released _Trampin'_ which included several songs about motherhood, partly in tribute to Smith's mother, who had died two years before. It was her first album on Columbia Records, soon to become a sister label to her previous home Arista Records. Smith curated the Meltdown festival in London on June 25, 2005, the penultimate event being the first live performance of _Horses_ in its entirety.[43] Guitarist Tom Verlaine took Oliver Ray's place. This live performance was released later in the year as _Horses/Horses_.

On July 10, 2005, Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture.[44] In addition to Smith's influence on rock music, the Minister also noted her appreciation of Arthur Rimbaud. In August 2005, Smith gave a literary lecture about the poems of Arthur Rimbaud and William Blake. On October 15, 2006, Patti Smith performed at the CBGB nightclub, with a 3½-hour _tour de force_ to close out Manhattan's music venue. She took the stage at 9:30 p.m. (EDT) and closed for the night (and forever for the venue) at a few minutes after 1:00 am, performing her song "Elegie", and finally reading a list of punk rock musicians and advocates who had died in the previous years.[45]

Smith was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 12, 2007.[46] She dedicated her award to the memory of her late husband, Fred, and gave a performance of The Rolling Stones staple "Gimme Shelter". As the closing number of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, Smith's "People Have the Power" was used for the big celebrity jam that always ends the program.[47]

From November 2006 to January 2007, an exhibition called 'Sur les Traces'[48] at Trolley Gallery, London, featured polaroid prints taken by Patti Smith and donated to Trolley to raise awareness and funds for the publication of Double Blind, a book on the war in Lebanon in 2006, with photographs by Paolo Pellegrin, a member of Magnum Photos. She also participated in the DVD commentary for _Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters_. From March 28 to June 22, 2008, the Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain in Paris hosted a major exhibition of the visual artwork of Patti Smith, _Land 250_, drawn from pieces created between 1967 and 2007.[49] At the 2008 Rowan Commencement ceremony, Smith received an honorary doctorate degree for her contributions to popular culture. President Jane Ciabattari and NBCC board member John Reed. Smith's memoir _Just Kids_ was an NBCC autobiography finalist at the 2010 awards.[50]]] Smith is the subject of a 2008 documentary film by Steven Sebring titled _Patti Smith: Dream of Life_.[51] A live album by Patti Smith and Kevin Shields, _The Coral Sea_ was released in July 2008. On September 10, 2009, after a week of smaller events and exhibitions in the city, Smith played an open-air concert in Florence's Piazza Santa Croce, commemorating her performance in the same city 30 years earlier.[52] In the meantime, she contributed with a special introduction to Jessica Lange's book _50 Photographs_ (2009).[53]

2010–present

Smith's book, _Just Kids_, a memoir of her time in 1970s Manhattan and her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe, was published in 2010; it later won the National Book Award for Nonfiction.[54][55] In 2018 a new edition with many added photographs and illustrations was published. She also headlined a benefit concert headed by bandmate Tony Shanahan, for The Court Tavern of New Brunswick.[56] Smith's set included "Gloria", "Because the Night" and "People Have the Power." She has a brief cameo in Jean-Luc Godard's 2010 _Film Socialisme_, which was first screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival.[57]

In 2010 Patti Smith received an honorary doctorate in fine arts from Pratt Institute, along with architect Daniel Libeskind, MoMA director Glenn Lowry, former NYC Landmarks Commissioner Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, novelist Jonathan Lethem, and director Steven Soderbergh.[58] Following the conferral of her degree, Smith delivered the commencement address[59] and sang/played two songs accompanied by long-time band member Lenny Kaye. In her remarks, Smith explained that in 1967 when she moved to New York City (Brooklyn), she would never have been accepted into Pratt, but most of her friends (including Mapplethorpe) were students at Pratt and she spent countless hours on the Pratt campus. She added that it was through her friends and their Pratt professors that she learned much of her own artistic skills, making the honor from the institute particularly poignant for Smith 43 years later.[60]

Patti Smith was one of the winners of the 2011 Polar Music Prize.[61] She made her television acting debut at the age of 64 on the TV series _Law & Order: Criminal Intent_, appearing in an episode called "Icarus".[62] In 2011 Smith was working on a crime novel set in London. "I've been working on a detective story that starts at the St Giles in the Fields church in London for the last two years", she told NME adding that she "loved detective stories" having been a fan of British fictional detective Sherlock Holmes and U.S. crime author Mickey Spillane as a girl.[63] Part of the book will be set in Gothenburg, Sweden.[64]

Following the death of her husband in 1994, Smith began devoting time to what she terms "pure photography" (a method of capturing still objects without using a flash).[65] In 2011, Smith announced the first museum exhibition of her photography in the United States, _Camera Solo_. She named the project after a sign she saw in the abode of Pope Celestine V, which translates as "a room of one's own", and which Smith felt best described her solitary method of photography.[66] The exhibition featured artifacts which were the everyday items or places of significance of artists whom Smith admires, including Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Keats and Blake. In February 2012, she was a guest at the Sanremo Music Festival.[67]

Smith recorded a cover of Buddy Holly's classic "Words of Love" for the CD _Rave on Buddy Holly_, a tribute album tied to Holly's seventy-fifth birthday year which was released June 28, 2011.[68] She also recorded the song "Capitol Letter" for the official soundtrack of the second film of the _Hunger Games_-series _The Hunger Games: Catching Fire_.[69]

Smith's 11th studio album, _Banga_, was released in June 2012. Music Journalist Hal Horowitz wrote : "These songs aren't as loud or frantic as those of her late 70s heyday, but they resonate just as boldly as she moans, chants, speaks and spits out lyrics with the grace and determination of Mohammad Ali in his prime. It's not an easy listen—the vast majority of her music never has been—but if you're a fan and/or prepared for the challenge, this is as potent, heady and uncompromising as she has ever gotten, and with Smith's storied history as a musical maverick, that's saying plenty."[70] The critical aggregator website Metacritic awarded the album a score of 81, indicating "universal acclaim".[71]

Also in 2012 Patti Smith recorded the cover of _Io come persona_ by the Italian singer-songwriter Giorgio Gaber, translated into English "I as a person", contained in the anthological album _...io ci sono_.[72][73]

2014]]In 2015, Adult Swim offered Smith the opportunity to perform a song to commemorate the series finale of Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Smith, an avowed fan of the series, recorded the song Aqua Teen Dream with the help of her children and band. The vocal track was recorded in a hotel overlooking Lerici's Bay of Poets.[74] On September 26, 2015, Smith performed during the American Museum of Tort Law convocation ceremony.[75]

In 2016 Smith performed "People Have the Power" at Riverside Church, Manhattan, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Democracy Now. She was joined by Michael Stipe. On December 10, 2016, Smith attended the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm on behalf of Bob Dylan, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, who himself could not be present due to prior commitments. After the official presentation speech for the literary prize by Horace Engdahl, a member of the Swedish Academy, Smith sang the Dylan song "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall". Possibly overcome by nerves she sang "I saw the babe that was just bleedin’", the wrong words to the second verse and became unable to continue.[76] She stopped, and after a brief apology, resumed the song, which earned her a jubilant applause at the end.[77][78]

In 2017, Smith appeared as herself in _Song to Song_ directed by Terrence Malick, opposite Rooney Mara and Ryan Gosling.[79][80] She later made an appearance at the Detroit show of U2's The Joshua Tree 2017 tour and performed "Mothers of the Disappeared" with the band.[81]

In 2018, Smith's concert-documentary film _Horses: Patti Smith and her Band_ premiered at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival to wide acclaim.


Legacy

Smith has been a great source of inspiration for Michael Stipe of R.E.M. Listening to her album _Horses_ when he was 15 made a huge impact on him; he said later, "I decided then that I was going to start a band."[82]

In 1998, Stipe published a collection of photos called _Two Times Intro: On the Road with Patti Smith._ Stipe sings backing vocals on Smith's songs "Last Call" and "Glitter in Their Eyes." Smith sang background vocals on R.E.M.'s songs "E-Bow the Letter" and "Blue".[83]

The Australian alternative rock band, The Go-Betweens dedicated a track ("When She Sang About Angels") off their 2000 album, _The Friends of Rachel Worth_, to Smith's long time influence.[84]

In 2004, Shirley Manson of Garbage spoke of Smith's influence on her in _Rolling Stone_{{'}}s issue "The Immortals: 100 Greatest Artists of All Time", in which Patti Smith was counted number 47.[85] The Smiths members Morrissey and Johnny Marr share an appreciation for Smith's _Horses,_ and revealed that their song "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" is a reworking of one of the album's tracks, "Kimberly".[86] In 2004, Sonic Youth released an album called _Hidros 3 (to Patti Smith)_.[87] U2 also cites Patti Smith as an influence.[88] In 2005 Scottish singer-songwriter KT Tunstall released the single "Suddenly I See" as a tribute of sorts to Patti Smith.[89] Canadian actress Ellen Page frequently mentions Smith as one of her idols and has done various photo shoots replicating famous Smith photos, as well as Irish actress Maria Doyle Kennedy who often refers to Smith as a major influence.[90] In 1978 and 1979, Gilda Radner portrayed a character called Candy Slice on _Saturday Night Live_ based on Smith.

Alternative rock singer-songwriter Courtney Love of Hole heavily credited Smith as being a huge influence on her; Love received Smith's album _Horses_ in juvenile hall as a teenager, and "realized that you could do something that was completely subversive that didn't involve violence [or] felonies. I stopped making trouble," said Love. "I stopped."[91] Hole's classic track "Violet" features the lyrics "And the sky was all violet / I want it again, but violent, more violent", alluding to lyrics from Smith's "Kimberly".[92] Love later stated that she considered "Rock n Roll Nigger" the greatest rock song of all time.[93]

American pop singer Madonna has also named Smith as one of her biggest influences.[94]

Anglo-Celtic rock band The Waterboys' debut single, "A Girl Called Johnny", was written as a tribute to Smith.[95]

In 2018, the English band Florence and the Machine dedicated Smith the _High as Hope_ album song "Patricia". The lyrics reference Patricia as Florence Welch's "North Star".[96]


Activism

In 1993, Smith contributed "Memorial Tribute (Live)" to the AIDS-Benefit Album _No Alternative_ produced by the Red Hot Organization.

Smith was a supporter of the Green Party and backed Ralph Nader in the 2000 United States presidential election.[97] She led the crowd singing "Over the Rainbow" and "People Have the Power" at the campaign's rallies, and also performed at several of Nader's subsequent "Democracy Rising" events.[98] Smith was a speaker and singer at the first protests against the Iraq War as U.S. President George W. Bush spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. Smith supported Democratic candidate John Kerry in the 2004 election. Bruce Springsteen continued performing her "People Have the Power" at Vote for Change campaign events. In the winter of 2004/2005, Smith toured again with Nader in a series of rallies against the Iraq War and called for the impeachment of George W. Bush.[99]

Smith premiered two new protest songs in London in September 2006.[100] Louise Jury, writing in _The Independent_, characterized them as "an emotional indictment of American and Israeli foreign policy". The song "Qana"[101] was about the Israeli airstrike on the Lebanese village of Qana. "Without Chains"[102] is about Murat Kurnaz, a Turkish citizen who was born and raised in Germany, held at Guantanamo Bay detainment camp for four years. Jury's article quotes Smith as saying:

In an interview, Smith stated that Kurnaz's family has contacted her and that she wrote a short preface for the book that he was writing.[103] Kurnaz's book, _Five Years of My Life_, was published in English by Palgrave Macmillan in March 2008, with Patti's introduction.[104]

On March 26, 2003, ten days after Rachel Corrie's death, Smith appeared in Austin, Texas, and performed an anti-war concert. She subsequently wrote a song "Peaceable Kingdom" which was inspired by and is dedicated to Rachel Corrie.[105] In 2009, in her Meltdown concert in Festival Hall, she paid homage to the Iranians taking part in post-election protests by saying "Where is My Vote?" in a version of the song "People Have the Power".[106]

In 2015, Smith appeared with Ralph Nader, spoke and performed the songs "Wing" and "People Have the Power" during the American Museum of Tort Law convocation ceremony in Winsted, Connecticut.[107] She performed "Wing" again in 2016 in homage to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks during the "First they came for Assange ..." event at Centre Pompidou, Paris, France, to mark the 4th year of Julian Assange's attempt to avoid prosecution by taking refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.[108] Smith spoke, read poetry, and performed several songs accompanied by her daughter Jesse at Ralph Nader's _Breaking Through Power_ conference at DAR Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C.[109]


Beliefs

Religion

Smith was raised a Jehovah's Witness and had a strong religious upbringing and a Bible education. She left organized religion as a teenager because she felt it was too confining. In response to this experience, she wrote the line "Jesus died for somebody's sins, but not mine" in her cover version of "Gloria" by Them.[110] She has described having an avid interest in Tibetan Buddhism around the age of eleven or twelve, saying "I fell in love with Tibet because their essential mission was to keep a continual stream of prayer," but that as an adult she sees clear parallels between different forms of religion, and has come to the conclusion that religious dogmas are "... man-made laws that you can either decide to abide by or not."[111]

Feminism and women in music

In 2014, Smith offered her opinion on the sexualization of women in music. "Pop music has always been about the mainstream and what appeals to the public. I don't feel it's my place to judge." As at points earlier in her life and career, she declined to embrace politicized feminism: "I have a son and a daughter, people always talk to me about feminism and women's rights, but I have a son too—I believe in human rights."[112]

In 2015, writer Anwen Crawford observed that Smith's "attitude to genius seems pre-feminist, if not anti-feminist; there is no democratizing, deconstructing impulse in her work."[113]
