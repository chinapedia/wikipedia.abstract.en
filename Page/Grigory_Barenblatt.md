GRIGORY ISAAKOVICH BARENBLATT (; 10 July 1927 – 22 June 2018)[1] was a Russian mathematician.


Education

Barenblatt graduated in 1950 from Moscow State University,[2] Department of Mechanics and Mathematics. He received his Ph.D. in 1953 from Moscow State University under the supervision of A. N. Kolmogorov.[3][4]


Career and research

Barenblatt also received a D.Sc. from Moscow State University in 1957.[5] He was an emeritus Professor in Residence at the Department of Mathematics of the University of California, Berkeley[6] and Mathematician at Department of Mathematics, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.[7] He was G. I. Taylor Professor of Fluid Mechanics at the University of Cambridge from 1992 to 1994[8] and he was Emeritus G. I. Taylor Professor of Fluid Mechanics.[9] His areas of research were:[10]

1.  Fracture mechanics
2.  The theory of fluid and gas flows in porous media
3.  The mechanics of a non-classical deformable solids
4.  Turbulence
5.  Self-similarities, nonlinear waves and intermediate asymptotics.
