Happy Accidents}}

SERENDIPITY means an unplanned, fortunate discovery.[1] Serendipity is a common occurrence throughout the history of product invention and scientific discovery. Serendipity is also seen as a potential design principle for online activities that would present a wide array of information and viewpoints, rather than just re-enforcing a user's opinion.


Etymology

The first noted use of "serendipity" in the English language was by Horace Walpole in 1754. In a letter he wrote to his friend Horace Mann, Walpole explained an unexpected discovery he had made about a lost painting of Bianca Cappello by Giorgio Vasari[2] by reference to a Persian fairy tale, _The Three Princes of Serendip_. The princes, he told his correspondent, were "always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things which they were not in quest of."[3] The name comes from _Serendip_, an old name for Sri Lanka (Ceylon), hence _Sarandib_ by Arab traders.[4] It is derived from the Sanskrit _Siṃhaladvīpaḥ_ (Siṃhalaḥ, Sri Lanka + dvīpaḥ, island).[5]

In June 2004, a British translation company voted the word to be one of the ten English words hardest to translate.[6] The word has been exported into many other languages, with the general meaning of “unexpected discovery” or “fortunate chance”.[7][8]


Applications

Inventions

The term "serendipity" is often applied to inventions made by chance rather than intent. Andrew Smith, editor of _The_ _Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink_, has speculated that most everyday products had serendipitous roots, with many early ones related to animals. The origin of cheese, for example, possibly originated in the Nomad practice of storing milk in the stomach of a dead camel that was attached to the saddle of a live one, thereby mixing rennet from the stomach with the milk stored within.[9]

The Post-It Note emerged after 3M scientist Spencer Silver produced a weak adhesive, and a colleague used it to keep bookmarks in place on a church hymnal. Silly Putty came from a failed attempt at synthetic rubber. The use of sensors to prevent automobile air bags from killing children came from a chair developed by the MIT Media Lab for a Penn and Teller magic show.[10] Raytheon scientist Percy Spencer first patented the idea behind the microwave oven after noticing that emissions from radar equipment had melted the candy in his pocket.[11] On a bird hunting trip, George de Mestral took a closer look at the cockleburs stuck to his pants and dog. Viewed under a microscope, each burr was covered with tiny hooks. The observation led to the invention of the Velcro hook-and-loop fastener.[12] In San Francisco, Frank Epperson, age 11, accidentally left a mix of water and soda powder outside; the frozen result became the basis for the Popsicle.[13]

Discoveries

Winterton's discovery was aided by Flickr's ability to present images that are personalized to a user's interests, thereby increasing the odds he would chance upon the photo. Computer scientist Jaime Teevan has argued that serendipitous discovery is promoted by such personalization, writing that "people don’t know what to do with random new information. Instead, we want information that is at the fringe of what we already know, because that is when we have the cognitive structures to make sense of the new ideas."[14]

Online activity

Serendipity is a design principle for online activity that would present viewpoints that diverge from those participants already hold. Harvard Law professor Cass Sunstein argues that such an "architecture of serendipity" would promote a healthier democracy. Like a great city or university, "a well-functioning information market" provides exposure to new ideas, people, and ways of life, "Serendipity is crucial because it expands your horizons. You need that if you want to be free." [15] The idea has potential application in the design of social media, information searches, and web browsing.[16][17]


Related terms

William Boyd coined the term ZEMBLANITY in the late twentieth century to mean somewhat the opposite of serendipity: "making unhappy, unlucky and unexpected discoveries occurring by design".[18] A zemblanity is, effectively, an "unpleasant unsurprise". It derives from Novaya Zemlya (or Nova Zembla), a cold, barren land with many features opposite to the lush Sri Lanka (Serendip). On this island Willem Barents and his crew were stranded while searching for a new route to the east.

BAHRAMDIPITY is derived directly from Bahram Gur as characterized in _The Three Princes of Serendip_. It describes the _suppression_ of serendipitous discoveries or research results by powerful individuals.[19]
