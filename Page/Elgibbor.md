ELGIBBOR, also known as JAREK POZARYCKI (age 41) or FIRE, is an unblack metal project, that started in 1999.[1][2][3]


Background

Elgibbor started in between 1996-1998,[4] but did not truly do anything until 1999 as an unblack metal.[5] The project has released 12 studio albums and several demos, EPs and singles. The name of the project means, "God Almighty".[6] Jarek, before becoming a Christian, was a Satanist.[7] Since becoming a Christian, his faith has been the foundation of his band.[8] Although Elgibbor is a one man band, founded by Fire, the band played out live at Audiofeed Festival 2017, with the lineup of Fire on guitar, former Frost Like Ashes bandmates Azahel on vocals and Sebat on guitar, Ascending King brainchild Ruah on bass, and bandmate Taberah of Katharos on drums.[9]


Influences

Fire stated in an interview that his influences "always come from Jesus" and he does not listen to secular metal.[10] When he says it "always comes from Jesus", he is implying that he only listens to Christian metal artists, including Crimson Moonlight, Arvinger, Drottnar, and Antestor.[11]
