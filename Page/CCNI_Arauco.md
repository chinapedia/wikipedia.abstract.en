CCNI_Arauco.PNG The CCNI _ARAUCO_ is a large container ship that experienced a major fire in the Port of Hamburg on September 1, 2016.[1] The vessel was only a year old, having been built in the Philippines, in 2015, at the Hanjin Subic Shipyard.[2]

It took four days to extinguish the fire.[3][4] Authorities took the risk of flooding her holds, and breaking her back, due to thermal shock, when local fireboats couldn't extinguish the fire.
