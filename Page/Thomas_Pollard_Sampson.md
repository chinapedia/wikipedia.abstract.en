THOMAS POLLARD SAMPSON (24 June 1875 – 25 June 1961) was a Tasmanian-born Australian architect active in New South Wales during the first forty years of the 20th century. His work encompassed the styles of the Federation Arts and Crafts and Bungalow through to the Inter-War Styles.[1] In 1912 he designed an octagonal roofed stadium at Rushcutters Bay that seated up to 12,000 spectators. At the time, the Sydney Stadium was considered to be “the largest roofed-in structure in the world.”[2]


Family and life

Sampson was born in Launceston, Tasmania, to Richard Sampson (c.1847-1917) and Caroline Elizabeth Pollard (1849-1945). His maternal grandparents were from Yorkshire, England, and his extended family were members of the Methodist Church. He married Clarice Henderson on 17 February 1911 at St Philip's Church, Sydney and died on 25 Jun 1961 at the Scottish Hospital, Paddington.[3] Sampson and his wife had one daughter, Phyllis (Phyl) Marjorie Sampson, who was born on 8 August 1911 in Sydney. In February 1932, at Woollahra, she married Paul Cohen a son of Sir Samuel and Lady Cohen.[4] The marriage produced twins, Christopher and Dinah Cohen. In 1941, Paul Cohen changed his Jewish name and those of his family to Cullen. He was fighting the Germans in North Africa, Greece and Crete and knew that, were he captured he would not be treated as a Prisoner of War.[5] The marriage ended in divorce in 1961. Phyl Cullen died on 22nd October 2011 in Elizabeth Bay, New South Wales, aged 100 years.[6]


Career

He was articled in architecture to A.E. Luttrell of Cameron Street, Launceston[7] In 1891 Sampson exhibited an architectural drawing of a design for a villa residence in the Tasmanian Industrial Exhibition. He had been articled for six months at that time and had become an architectural photographer taking many notable images of Launceston buildings.

Sampson moved to Sydney to practise as an architect. In 1907 he designed an estate of 32 houses in Manly, New South Wales.[8] In 1919 he partnered with Harold Minton Taylor, a solicitor, and purchased 'Rosebank House', Darlinghurst, and adjoining land. They demolished the original house and constructed several apartment blocks, including Upton Court in Forbes Street.
