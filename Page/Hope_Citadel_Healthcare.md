HOPE CITADEL HEALTHCARE CIC is a Community interest company based in Greater Manchester.

When it was established it was criticised at the 2009 national Local Medical Committees conference because its website makes it plain that the organisation is a specifically Christian organisation. It aimed to provide spiritual care and health care ‘alongside and in conjunction with clinical care', to take into account ‘spiritual aspects' of wellbeing and to take ‘every opportunity' for spiritual development. This was said to contravene a fundamental principle of the NHS.[1]

It employs focused care practitioners to fill in the gaps between health and social care. Dr John Patterson, clinical director, told The Guardian “In areas of deprivation you need more multifactorial medicine and psychosocial support.”[2]

It runs The Hill Top Surgery in Fitton Hill, and Hollinwood Medical Practice, both in Oldham. Both were rated outstanding by the Care Quality Commission. According to Dr Steve Field "The Hill Top Surgery is one of the most inspirational GP surgeries that I have visited. It implemented suggestions for improvements from patients and from the patient participation group.[3] Hollinwood Medical Practice was rated higher than others for almost all aspects of care, CQC inspectors reported.[4]

It also runs a health centre in Middleton, where Inspire Middleton describes itself as "a community partner"[5] and Hawthorn Medical Centre in Levenshulme.
