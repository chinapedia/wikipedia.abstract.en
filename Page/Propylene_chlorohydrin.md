PROPYLENE CHLOROHYDRIN usually refers to the organic compound with the formula CH₃CH(OH)CH₂Cl. A related compound, an isomer, is CH₃CH(Cl)CH₂OH. Both isomers are colorless liquids that are soluble in organic solvents. They are classified as chlorohydrins. Both are generated on a large scale as intermediates in the production of propylene oxide.[1]

The reaction of aqueous solution of chlorine with propene gives a 10:1 ratio of CH₃CH(OH)CH₂Cl and CH₃CH(Cl)CH₂OH. These compounds are treated with lime to give propylene oxide, which is useful in the production of plastics and other polymers.
