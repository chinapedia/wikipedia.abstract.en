The GREAT VOWEL SHIFT was a series of changes in the pronunciation of the English language that took place primarily between 1350 and the 1600s and 1700s, beginning in southern England and today having influenced effectively all dialects of English. Through this vowel shift, all Middle English long vowels changed their pronunciation. Some consonant sounds changed as well, particularly those that became silent; the term _Great Vowel Shift_ is sometimes used to include these consonant changes.[1][2]

English spelling began to become standardized in the 15th and 16th centuries, and the Great Vowel Shift is the major reason English spellings now often considerably deviate from their representation of English pronunciations.[3] The Great Vowel Shift was first studied by Otto Jespersen (1860–1943), a Danish linguist and Anglicist, who coined the term.[4]


Causes

The causes of the Great Vowel Shift have been a source of intense scholarly debate, and, as yet, there is no firm consensus. The greatest changes occurred during the 15th and 16th centuries. Some scholars have argued that the rapid migration of peoples from northern England to the southeast following the Black Death caused a mixing of accents that forced a change in the standard London vernacular. Others argue that the influx of French loanwords was a major factor in the shift.[5] Yet others assert that because of the increasing prestige of French pronunciations among the middle classes (perhaps related to the English aristocracy's switching from French to English around this time), a process of hypercorrection may have started a shift that unintentionally resulted in vowel pronunciations that were less like French instead of more.[6] An opposing theory states that the wars with France and general anti-French sentiments caused hypercorrection deliberately to make English sound less like French.[7]


Overall changes

The main difference between the pronunciation of Middle English in the year 1400 and Modern English (Received Pronunciation) is in the value of the long vowels. Long vowels in Middle English had "continental" values, much like those in Italian and Standard German; in standard Modern English, they have entirely different pronunciations. The differing pronunciations of English vowel letters do not stem from the Great Shift as such but from the fact that English spelling failed to be adapted to the changes. German had undergone vowel changes quite similar to the Great Shift in a slightly earlier period but the spelling was changed accordingly (e.g. Middle High German → modern German "to bite").

Middle English vowel system

Before the Great Vowel Shift, Middle English in Southern England had seven long vowels, . The vowels occurred in the words _bite_, _meet_, _meat_, _mate_, _boat_, _boot_, _out_ and many more.

vowel system

The words had very different pronunciations in Middle English from their pronunciations in Modern English. Long _i_ in _bite_ was pronounced as so Middle English _bite_ sounded like Modern English _beet_ ; long _e_ in _meet_ was pronounced as so Middle English _meet_ sounded similar to Modern English _mate_ ; long _a_ in _mate_ was pronounced as , with a vowel like Scottish English _ah_ in _father_ or General American short _o_ in _cot_ ; and long _o_ in _boot_ was pronounced as , similar to modern _oa_ in General American _boat_ . In addition, Middle English had a long in _beat_, like modern short _e_ in _bed_ but pronounced longer, and a long in _boat_.

Changes

After around 1300, the long vowels of Middle English began changing in pronunciation. The two close vowels, , became diphthongs (vowel breaking), and the other five, , underwent an increase in tongue height (raising).

They occurred over several centuries and can be divided into two phases. The first phase affected the close vowels and the close-mid vowels : were raised to , and became the diphthongs or . The second phase affected the open vowel and the open-mid vowels : were raised, in most cases changing to .

The Great Vowel Shift changed vowels without merger so Middle English before the vowel shift had the same number of vowel phonemes as Early Modern English after the vowel shift. After the Great Vowel Shift, some vowel phonemes began merging. Immediately after the Great Vowel Shift, the vowels of _meet_ and _meat_ were different, but they are merged in Modern English, and both words are pronounced as . However, during the 16th and the 17th centuries, there were many different mergers, and some mergers can be seen in individual Modern English words like _great_, which is pronounced with the vowel as in _mate_ rather than the vowel as in _meat_.

This is a simplified picture of the changes that happened between late Middle English (late ME), Early Modern English (EModE), and today's English (ME). Pronunciations in 1400, 1500, 1600, and 1900 are shown. To hear recordings of the sounds, click the phonetic symbols.

First phase

The first phase of the Great Vowel Shift affected the Middle English close-mid vowels , as in _beet_ and _boot_, and the close vowels , as in _bite_ and _out_. The close-mid vowels became close , and the close vowels became diphthongs. The first phase was complete in 1500, meaning that by that time, words like _beet_ and _boot_ had lost their Middle English pronunciation, and were pronounced with the same vowels as in Modern English. The words _bite_ and _out_ were pronounced with diphthongs, but not the same diphthongs as in Modern English.

: First phase of the Great Vowel Shift

Scholars agree that the Middle English close vowels became diphthongs around the year 1500, but disagree about what diphthongs they changed to. According to Lass, the words _bite_ and _out_ after diphthongization were pronounced as and , similar to American English _bait_ and _oat_ . Later, the diphthongs shifted to , then , and finally to Modern English . This sequence of events is supported by the testimony of orthoepists before Hodges in 1644.

However, many scholars such as , , and argue for theoretical reasons that, contrary to what 16th-century witnesses report, the vowels were actually immediately centralized and lowered to .

Evidence from northern English and Scots (see below) suggests that the close-mid vowels were the first to shift. As the Middle English vowels were raised towards , they forced the original Middle English out of place and caused them to become diphthongs . This type of sound change, in which one vowel's pronunciation shifts so that it is pronounced like a second vowel, and the second vowel is forced to change its pronunciation, is called a push chain.

However, according to professor Jürgen Handke, for some time, there was a phonetic split between words with the vowel and the diphthong , in words where the Middle English shifted to the Modern English . For an example, _high_ was pronounced with the vowel , and _like_ and _my_ were pronounced with the diphthong .[10] Therefore, for logical reasons, the close vowels could have diphthongized before the close-mid vowels raised. Otherwise, _high_ would probably rhyme with _thee_ rather than _my_. This type of chain is called a drag chain.

Second phase

The second phase of the Great Vowel Shift affected the Middle English open vowel , as in _mate_, and the Middle English open-mid vowels , as in _meat_ and _boat_. Around 1550, Middle English was raised to . Then, after 1600, the new was raised to , with the Middle English open-mid vowels raised to close-mid .

: Second phase of the Great Vowel Shift

Later mergers

During the first and the second phases of the Great Vowel Shift, long vowels were shifted without merging with other vowels, but after the second phase, several vowels merged. The later changes also involved the Middle English diphthong , as in _day_, which had monophthongised to , and merged with Middle English as in _mate_ or as in _meat_.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, several different pronunciation variants existed among different parts of the population for words like _meet_, _meat_, _mate_, and _day_. In each pronunciation variant, different pairs or trios of words were merged in pronunciation. Four different pronunciation variants are shown in the table below. The fourth pronunciation variant gave rise to Modern English pronunciation. In Modern English, _meet_ and _meat_ are merged in pronunciation and both have the vowel , and _mate_ and _day_ are merged with the diphthong , which developed from the 16th-century long vowel .

+------+---------+-------------------------------------+

: Second phase of the Great Vowel Shift

Modern English typically has the _meet_–_meat_ merger: both _meet_ and _meat_ are pronounced with the vowel . Words like _great_ and _steak_, however, have merged with _mate_ and are pronounced with the vowel , which developed from the shown in the table above.


Northern English and Scots

The Great Vowel Shift affected other dialects as well as the standard English of southern England but in different ways. In Northern England, the shift did not operate on the long back vowels because they had undergone an earlier shift.[11] Similarly, the Scots language in Scotland had a different vowel system before the Great Vowel Shift, as had shifted to in Early Scots. In the Scots equivalent of the Great Vowel Shift, the long vowels , and shifted to , and by the Middle Scots period and remained unaffected.[12]

The first step in the Great Vowel Shift in Northern and Southern English is shown in the table below. The Northern English developments of Middle English and were different from Southern English. In particular, the Northern English vowels in _bite_, in _feet_, and in _boot_ shifted, while the vowel in _house_ did not. These developments below fall under the label "older" to refer to Scots and a more conservative and increasingly rural Northern sound, while "younger" refers to a more mainstream Northern sound largely emerging just since the twentieth century.

+----------------+----------------+

The vowel systems of Northern and Southern Middle English immediately before the Great Vowel Shift were different in one way. In Northern Middle English, the back close-mid vowel in _boot_ had already shifted to front (a sound change known as fronting), like the long __ in German "hear". Thus, Southern English had a back close-mid vowel , but Northern English did not:

+------------------------------+------------------------------+
| +-----------+-------+------+ | +-----------+-------+------+ |
| |           | front | back | | |           | front | back | |
| +===========+=======+======+ | +===========+=======+======+ |
| | close     |       |      | | | close     |       |      | |
| +-----------+-------+------+ | +-----------+-------+------+ |
| | close-mid |       |      | | | close-mid |       | —    | |
| +-----------+-------+------+ | +-----------+-------+------+ |
| | open-mid  |       |      | | | open-mid  |       |      | |
| +-----------+-------+------+ | +-----------+-------+------+ |
| | open      |       | —    | | | open      |       | —    | |
| +-----------+-------+------+ | +-----------+-------+------+ |
|                              |                              |
| : Southern Middle English    | : Northern Middle English    |
| vowel system                 | vowel system                 |
+------------------------------+------------------------------+

In both Northern and Southern English, the first step of the Great Vowel Shift raised the close-mid vowels to become close. Northern Middle English had two close-mid vowels – in _feet_ and in _boot_ – which were raised to and . Later on, Northern English changed to , so that _boot_ has the same vowel as _feet_. Southern Middle English had two close-mid vowels – in _feet_ and in _boot_ – which were raised to and .

In Southern English, the close vowels in _bite_ and in _house_ shifted to become diphthongs, but in Northern English, in _bite_ shifted but in _house_ did not.

If the difference between the Northern and Southern vowel shifts is caused by the vowel systems at the time of the Great Vowel Shift, did not shift because there was no back mid vowel in Northern English. In Southern English, shifting of to could have caused diphthongisation of original , but because Northern English had no back close-mid vowel to shift, the back close vowel did not diphthongise.


Exceptions

Not all words underwent certain phases of the Great Vowel Shift. Examples are _father_, which failed to become , and _broad_, which failed to become . The word _room_, which was spelled as _roum_ in Middle English, retains its Middle English pronunciation. It is an exception to the shifting of to because it is followed by _m_, a labial consonant.

The class _ea_ did not take the step to in several words. The presence of in _swear_ and _bear_ caused the vowel quality to be retained but not in the cases of _hear_ and _near_. Shortening of long vowels at various stages produced further complications: _ea_ is again a good example by shortening commonly before coronal consonants such as _d_ and _th_, thus: _dead_, _head_, _threat_, _wealth_ etc. (That is known as the bred–bread merger.) The _oo_ was shortened from to , in many cases before _k_, _d_ and less commonly _t_: _book_, _foot_, _good_, etc. Some words subsequently changed from to : _blood_, _flood_. Similar but older shortening occurred for some instances of _ou_: _could_.

Some loanwords, such as _soufflé_ and _umlaut_, have retained a spelling from their origin language that may seem similar to the previous examples; but, since they were not a part of English at the time of the Great Vowel Shift, they are not actually exceptions to the shift.


Related consonant changes

During this same period, there were a number of consonant changes, particularly changes that were in combination with the vowel changes, or cases of silencing of consonants. An often-cited example is the word _knight_, which in Middle English was pronounced . The _k_ and the _gh_ were silenced, but additionally the _i_ changed its value to . This vowel shift, of course, was not independent of the consonant shift as it was the combined sound that actually made the transition to .

The following are examples of some of the most common consonant-related shifts that occurred:

Spelling

The printing press was introduced to England in the 1470s by William Caxton and later Richard Pynson.[13] The adoption and use of the printing press accelerated the process of standardization of English spelling, which continued into the 16th century. The standard spellings were those of Middle English pronunciation, and spelling conventions continued from Old English. However, the Middle English spellings were retained into Modern English while the Great Vowel Shift was taking place, which caused some of the peculiarities of Modern English spelling in relation to vowels.
