The SCOTTISH LAND FUND (SLF) was founded in 2000, as a part of land reform in Scotland. Its goal is to help communities buy their land from their landlords.

The SLF was capitalized by the UK Lottery-founded New Opportunities Fund. The initial fund was 10,000,000 GBP and this was later increased to 15,000,000 GBP.

By June 2005, the SLF had assisted roughly 200 communities.[1]
