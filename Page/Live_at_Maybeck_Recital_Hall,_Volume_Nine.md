_LIVE AT MAYBECK RECITAL HALL, VOLUME NINE_ is a 1991 live album by jazz pianist Marian McPartland, recorded at the Maybeck Recital Hall in Berkeley, California.[1]


Reception

The album was positively reviewed by Ken Dryden at Allmusic who wrote that McPartland's "chops are never in question". Dryden highlighted Duke Ellington's "Clothed Woman", writing that "McPartland slowly unveils its shrouds, gliding through a maze of dramatic chords, joyous stride piano and repetitious vamps with a veteran's confidence" and regretted that the concert wasn't filmed "...in order for the rest of us to catch her playfulness at the piano, her head thrown back with laughter, with her witty introductions to each piece (which are unfortunately edited out of the CD)". Dryden concluded that the album "not only ranks with the best of the Maybeck solo series, but it should be considered as one of the best solo concerts ever to be released".[2]
