"CHRISTMAS BELLS" is an American television commercial produced by the Hershey Company promoting Hershey's Kisses. The advertisement, produced with stop-motion animation, features Hershey's Kisses, fashioned as a handbell choir, playing the Christmas carol "We Wish You a Merry Christmas". It debuted in 1989 and is shown in the United States each holiday season; as such, it is the longest-running television commercial for the Hershey brand. In 2012, the ad was redone with a new recording of the audio and the graphics being done entirely in CGI animation. Since then, that has been the version playing each year.[1]


Background

In 1989, the Hershey Company began an advertising campaign for their product Hershey's Kisses, which was referred to as the "whimsy" campaign. Ogilvy & Mather was the advertising agency behind the spot and David Apicella served as Creative Director. Television advertisements would utilize "tabletop stop-motion animation and CG product photography." Colossal Pictures was the animation studio, located in San Francisco, who produced the commercial. Carl Willat directed the spots and performed the stop-motion animation with Gordon Clark. John Dunn, Hershey's brands manager, oversaw the production and helped develop the last-minute idea to create the "Christmas Bells" advertisement.[2] Leah Longan, former marketing director for Hershey, told _the New York Times_ in 1994 they continued to run the advertisement because they "don't wear out like normal commercials," as they are only shown seasonally.[3]
