YOUTH HOMELESSNESS is homelessness for young people.

Youth homelessness is a significant social issue globally, both in developing countries and many developed countries. In developing countries, research and preventions has mostly been focussing on "street children", while in developed countries, central concerns in the research and prevention involve breakdown in family relationships and other causes that lead to young people leaving home.[1] The term "street children" also includes street workers who are not actually homeless.[2]

The exact definition of youth homelessness varies by region. In the United States, a homeless youth is someone who is under the age of 21 and is unable to safely live at a relative, and has no other safe alternative living arrangement.[3] In Australia, there are three categories of homelessness which include those who live from one emergency shelter to another (in homeless shelters of 'couch surfing') as well as those living in accommodation that falls below minimum community standards (boarding houses and caravan parks).[4]

Homeless people, and homeless organizations, are sometimes accused or convicted of fraudulent behaviour. Criminals are also known to exploit homeless people, ranging from identity theft to tax and welfare scams.[5][6][7] These incidents often leads to negative connotations on the homeless.[8][9]


Australia

Youth homelessness in Australia is a significant social issue,[10] affecting tens of thousands of young people in the country. In 2006, the Australian government estimate, focusing on homeless school children, found some 20,000 homeless youth between the ages of 12 and 18.[11] Another estimate find approximately 44,000 homeless Australians under the age of 25.[12]

Activists maintain that the majority of young people left home because of family breakdowns, often created by domestic violence and abuse.[13] An estimate by Swinburne University found that over $600 million is spent each year on health and justice services for homeless youth.[14]

Researchers have studied the prevalence of psychological distress and mental illness among homeless youth in Australia.[15]

Early intervention services have been regarded by some experts as a way to curb youth homelessness.[16] Other researchers have examined the potential solution of youth foyers.[17]


Canada

In Canada, youth homelessness is recognized as a significant social issue, however, no nationwide strategy or study has been conducted.[18]

Some researchers focus on the effects of homelessness on young LGBT Canadians.[19] Others focus on the general rates of poor health among Canada's homeless youth.[20]


United States

In the United States, homeless youth are a varied group.[21] Some researchers maintain that some two million young people in America are homeless.[22]


Health Risks

Youth homelessness is often accompanied by high risk behaviors like sex without a condom and drug use. This happens at a much higher rate than young people who have a stable living situation.[23] Even though the risk of infection is much higher for them, studies have found that with only 46% having been tested recently, these homeless youth are not any more likely to get tested for sexually transmitted infection (STI) than their peers.[24] A history of neglect and abuse is common for youth who become homeless, so they often have a deep distrust of adults and other authority figures. Adults wanting to help these vulnerable young people will need to prove themselves to be trustworthy if they want to maintain any sort of connection with them that lasts. Effective connections have been formed through offering free STI testing. While outreach for interviews saw a retention rate of less than 40%,[25] similar studies offering free STI testing saw return visits as high as 98%.[26] Readily available comprehensive healthcare will help address STI infection rates, and problems of social isolation for this population.
