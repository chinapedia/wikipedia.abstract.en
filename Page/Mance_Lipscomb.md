MANCE LIPSCOMB (April 9, 1895 â€“ January 30, 1976)[1] was an American blues singer, guitarist and songster. He was born BEAU DE GLEN LIPSCOMB near Navasota, Texas. As a youth he took the name Mance (short for _emancipation_) from a friend of his oldest brother, Charlie.


Biography

Lipscomb was born April 9, 1895. His father was an ex-slave from Alabama; his mother was half and African-American.[2][3] For most of his life, Lipscomb supported himself as a tenant farmer in Texas. He had started playing guitar at an early age and became an accomplished musician.

He was discovered and recorded by Mack McCormick and Chris Strachwitz in 1960, during a revival of interest in the country blues. He recorded many albums of blues, ragtime, Tin Pan Alley, and folk music (most of them released by Strachwitz's Arhoolie Records),[4] singing and accompanying himself on acoustic guitar. Lipscomb had a "dead-thumb" finger-picking guitar technique and an expressive voice. He honed his skills by playing in nearby Brenham, Texas, with a blind musician, Sam Rogers.

His first release was the album _Texas Songster_ (1960). Lipscomb performed songs in a wide range of genres, from old songs such as "Sugar Babe" (the first he ever learned), to pop numbers like "Shine On, Harvest Moon" and "It's a Long Way to Tipperary".[5]

In 1961 he recorded the album _Trouble in Mind_, released by Reprise Records.[6] In May 1963, he appeared at the first Monterey Folk Festival, held in California.[7]

Unlike many of his contemporaries, Lipscomb did not record in the early blues era. His life is well documented thanks to his autobiography, _I Say Me for a Parable: The Oral Autobiography of Mance Lipscomb, Texas Bluesman_, narrated to Glen Alyn (published posthumously). He was the subject of a short 1971 documentary film by Les Blank, called _A Well Spent Life_.[8]

He began playing the guitar at an early age and played regularly for years at local gatherings, mostly what he called "Saturday night suppers" hosted by someone in the area. He and his wife regularly hosted such gatherings for a while. Until around 1960, most of his musical activity took place within what he called his "precinct", the area around Navasota.

Following his discovery by McCormick and Strachwitz, Lipscomb became an important figure in the American folk music revival of the 1960s. He was a regular performer at folk festivals and folk-blues clubs around the United States, notably the Ash Grove in Los Angeles, California.

He died in Navasota in 1976, two years after suffering a stroke.
