ANAXIMENES OF LAMPSACUS (; ; 320 BC) was a Greek rhetorician and historian.


Rhetorical works

Anaximenes was a pupil of Zoilus[1] and, like his teacher, wrote a work on Homer. As a rhetorician, he was a determined opponent of Isocrates and his school.[2] He is generally regarded as the author of the _Rhetoric to Alexander_, an _Art of Rhetoric_ included in the traditional corpus of Aristotle's works. Quintilian seems to refer to this work under Anaximenes' name in _Institutio Oratoria_ 3.4.9, as the Italian Renaissance philologist Piero Vettori first recognized. This attribution has, however, been disputed by some scholars.

The hypothesis to Isocrates' _Helen_ mentions that Anaximenes, too, had written a _Helen_, "though it is more a defense speech (_apologia_) than an encomium," and concludes that he was "the man who has written about Helen" to whom Isocrates refers (Isoc. _Helen_ 14). Jebb entertained the possibility that this work survives in the form of the _Encomium of Helen_ ascribed to Gorgias: "It appears not improbable that Anaximenes may have been the real author of the work ascribed to Gorgias."[3]

According to Pausanias (6.18.6), Anaximenes was "the first who practised the art of speaking extemporaneously." He also worked as a logographer, having written the speech prosecuting Phryne according to Diodorus Periegetes (quoted by Athenaeus XIII.591e). The "ethical" fragments preserved in Stobaeus' _Florilegium_ may represent "some philosophical book."[4]


Historical works

Anaximenes wrote a history of Greece in twelve books, stretching from the gods' origins to the death of Epaminondas at the Battle of Mantinea (_Hellenica_, ), and a history of Philip of Macedon (_Philippica_). He was a favorite of Alexander the Great, whom he accompanied in his Persian campaigns,[5] and wrote a third historical work on Alexander (however, Pausanias 6.18.6 expresses doubt about his authorship of an epic poem on Alexander). He was one of the eight exemplary historiographers included in the Alexandrian canon.

Didymus reports that the work transmitted as speech 11 of Demosthenes (_Against the Letter of Philip_) could be found in almost identical form in Book 7 of Anaximenes' _Philippica_, and many scholars regard the work as a historiographic composition by Anaximenes.[6] The _Letter of Philip_ (speech 12) to which speech 11 seems to respond may also be by Anaximenes, or it may be an authentic letter by Philip, perhaps written with the aid of his advisers.[7] The more ambitious theory of Wilhelm Nitsche, which assigned to Anaximenes a larger part of the Demosthenic corpus (speeches 10-13 and 25, letters 1-4, proems), can be rejected.[8]

Anaximenes was hostile to Theopompus, whom he sought to discredit with a libelous parody, _Trikaranos_, published in Theopompus' style and under his name, attacking Athens, Sparta, and Thebes.[9]

Plutarch criticizes Anaximenes, together with Theopompus and Ephorus, for the "rhetorical effects and grand periods" these historians implausibly gave to men in the midst of urgent battlefield circumstances (_Praecepta gerendae reipublicae_ [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Praecepta_gerendae_reipublicae*.html#T803b 803b]).
