GUY F. MUZIANI (August 10, 1925 â€“ July 30, 1988) was an American politician who served in the New Jersey General Assembly from the 1st Legislative District from 1982 to 1988.[1]

Muziani served for 11 years as mayor of Wildwood, New Jersey under a system in which the commissioners chose a mayor from among their members. After a change to the city's form of government to have the mayor be directly elected, Muziani lost the mayoral race to his longtime foe, Earl B. Ostrander, who would be recalled from office after 17 months in office.[2]

"The recall campaign also focused attention on a long-running feud between Mr. Ostrander and Assemblyman Guy F. Muziani, who had been Mayor of Wildwood for 11 years - when the voters elected commissioners and the commissioners selected one from their ranks to be Mayor - until the new form of government was implemented.... When Mr. Ostrander defeated Mr. Muziani in the first mayoral election, local officials considered it a major upset."
