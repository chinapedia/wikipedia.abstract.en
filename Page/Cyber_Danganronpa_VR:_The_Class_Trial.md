Gameplay

_Cyber Danganronpa VR_ is a virtual reality game in which the player plays through the fourth "class trial" from the adventure game _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_, where the player aims to uncover who was behind the murder of Sakura Ogami;[1] unlike the original game, which uses 2D cutouts for characters, _Cyber Danganronpa VR_ uses 3D models.[2] The player character's classmates give testimonies, which appear as words; if the player notices something in the testimony that seems suspicious, they can refute the words by shooting them with "truth bullets".[3] To do this, the player needs to turn their head toward the character who testified, and press a button on the DualShock 4 controller.[4][5] The game takes around ten minutes to play through,[6] and ends with a first-person sequence where the character Monokuma murders the player.[7]


Development and release

_Cyber Danganronpa VR_ was announced and shown at the Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong fair in July 2015 by Sony Interactive Entertainment, as a tech demo for their virtual reality headset PlayStation VR.[8][9] The game was developed by Spike Chunsoft,[10] and was their first PlayStation 4 project. According to producer Yoshinori Terasawa, he was inspired to create the game by Bandai Namco Entertainment's PlayStation VR title _Summer Lesson_. The reason for making a game based on _Trigger Happy Havoc_ rather than the spin-off shooting game _Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls_ was that other companies could create virtual reality shooting games, and that the developers wanted to create something that only they could make. Terasawa decided to make the punishment sequence play out from a first-person perspective to make the player feel horror, but also included Monokuma to lighten the mood. To be able to complete the game quickly, the developers made use of the game engine Unreal Engine 4.[11]

The game was released digitally for the PlayStation 4 on October 13, 2016 in Japan and Hong Kong; it was made available freely for PlayStation Plus subscribers, with no release announced for players without a subscription.[12][13] The Hong Kong release was made available in English, with English voice overs; Spike Chunsoft announced in October 2016 that they were working towards releasing that version in the West.[14] It was released in North America on March 7, 2017, and in Europe on March 10.[15]


Reception

_Hardcore Gamer_{{'s}} Edward Dang was positive to the game, and hoped that it would lead to virtual reality releases of complete _Danganronpa_ games.[16] Jordan Devore at Destructoid thought that the game did not look exciting based on off-screen footage, but noted that this often is the case for virtual reality games, and thought that it "could be the start of something neat".[17] Chris Carter, also writing for Destructoid, enjoyed the game and called it worth playing, but not something to get excited over due to its short length.[18] Aki Otsuki at 4Gamer.net recommended the game, and said that experiencing the punishment sequence in virtual reality was horrifying.[19] _Famitsu_ liked the immersion given by the virtual reality and the 360-degree movements.[20] Hiroaki Mabuchi at IGN Japan said that the new environment graphics were a great reproduction of their _Trigger Happy Havoc_ counterparts, and that the mysterious atmosphere suited _Danganronpa_ well.[21]
