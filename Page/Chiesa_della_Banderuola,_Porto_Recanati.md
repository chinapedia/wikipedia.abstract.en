Banderuola.jpg The CHIESETTA DELLA BANDERUOLA (Little church of the windvane) is a small, Roman Catholic Marian shrine chapel within the town limits of Porto Recanati, province of Macerata, region of Marche, Italy.


History

The little brick chapel shrine has a peculiar history, linked to the resurgence of Marian devotions in the mid-19th century. The present church, although appearing older, was erected in 184 using a design by the architect Pietro Pasquali. Tradition held that this locale was the Italian transitory port of arrival in 1294 for the miraculous transportation of the _Santa Casa di Loreto_, to which the small church now bears a resemblance. Documents site that by 1467, neighbors had erected a wall to memorialize the event. The area was called _Bandirola_ or _Banderuola_, since it appeared to have windvane to signal to pilgrims arriving by sea of the road to Loreto.[1] Further documents in 1561 refer to restoration of the wall. In 1844, Pope Pius IX approved a much grander project, but bureaucratic wrangling restricted it to the small chapel. The present church was rebuilt in 1939-1940.[2]
