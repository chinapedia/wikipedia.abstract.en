The MARINE AIR-GROUND TASK FORCE (MAGTF) UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEM (UAS) EXPEDITIONARY (MUX),[1] formerly the TACTICALLY EXPLOITED RECONNAISSANCE NODE (TERN), a joint program between DARPA and the U.S. Navyâ€™s Office of Naval Research (ONR), seeks to greatly increase the effectiveness of forward-deployed small-deck ships such as destroyers and frigates by enabling them to serve as mobile launch and recovery sites for specially designed unmanned aerial systems (UAS).[2] These vehicles are to carry 600 pounds of ordnance in order to conduct combat strikes.[3][4]


History

Northrop Grumman won the contract to develop the project in December 2015 with tail-sitter, flying wing aircraft with a twin nose-mounted contra-rotating propeller propulsion system.[5][6]
