History

In November 2014,[3] Nguyen founded Rise, a nonprofit organisation which is aimed to protect the civil rights of sexual assault and rape survivors.[4][5][6] In 2013, she had been raped while attending college in Massachusetts.[7][8][9] Nguyen headed the organisation in her spare time[10][11] until September 2016.[12] Everyone who works with Rise is a volunteer,[13] and the organisation has raised money through GoFundMe.[14] Nguyen explained that the organisation was named Rise to "remind us that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can rise up and change the world."[15]
