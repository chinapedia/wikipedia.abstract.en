All Party Parliamentary Group on Heart Disease Inquiry into heart failure

In 2016, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Heart Disease, chaired by Stuart Andrew MP, held an inquiry into living with heart failure. Written and oral evidence was provided by patients, healthcare professionals, and commissioners. The Inquiry's report, Focus on Heart Failure, was published in September 2016 and made ten recommendations for improving heart failure services.

Nine members of the Alliance for Heart Failure were co-opted onto an advisory panel for the inquiry. The panel had ten members in total.


National Heart Failure Audit

2016-17 Audit

The latest National Heart Failure Audit (2016-2017), published on November 27, 2018, reported that mortality among patients admitted to hospital remained at 8.9%, despite more patient episodes being recorded and a trend towards increasing age. The number of patients seen by heart failure specialists increased to over 80%, while 89% of patients get an echocardiogram. However, rates were higher for those admitted to Cardiology (96%) rather than General Medical (84%) wards. Prescriptions for disease modifying medications remained high.

The Alliance for Heart Failure welcomed the improvements but expressed concern at the 'unacceptable' regional variation.

2015-16 Audit

The National Heart Failure Audit (April 2015-March 2016), published on August 10, 2017, reported that mortality among patients admitted to hospital had fallen to 8.9% compared to 9.6% reported in the previous audit. It also reported that the number of patients seen by specialist heart failure nurses remained high at 80%, and that 90% of patients were recorded as having an up to date echocardiogram. The report also recorded an increase in prescriptions for disease modifying medications.

The Alliance for Heart Failure welcomed the findings but called for more to be done to address the vast regional variation in patient outcomes.[1]


National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD)

The National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) published on November 22, 2018, recommended improvements in the process of care for patients with acute heart failure who died while admitted to hospital as an emergency. Responding to the report, the Alliance for Heart Failure said that it reinforces the need for urgent action to improve heart failure services, and the important role of heart failure specialist nurses, as part of a full multi-disciplinary heart failure team, in maximising outcomes for patients.
