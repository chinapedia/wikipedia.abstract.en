Legacy

-   A remix of "Lottery Reptiles" was included on the "Roulette Stars of Metro Detroit" soundtrack album ahead of this album's release.
-   The band performed "I'll Be In Touch" and "(Be My) Skin Caboose" on their second live album "You're Welcome!".
-   Stretch goals for the Kickstarter campaign used to fund production of "You're Welcome!" secured funding for the production of music videos for the songs "I'll Be In Touch" and "I Got the Box". The first video, "I'll Be In Touch" was released on May 22, 2017, and was a shot-for-shot remake of the music video for "Sometimes a Fantasy" by Billy Joel.[1] The second video, "I Got the Box", is to be a direct sequel to "That Voodoo You Do, or The Legba Luncheon", a short film written by and starring Electric Six frontman, Tyler Spencer, and also featuring Electric Six synthesizer player, Christopher Tait.[2]
