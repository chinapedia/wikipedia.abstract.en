CLOWNS LOUNGE is the thirteenth studio album by Enuff Z'Nuff.[1] It is mainly an archival release that features previously unreleased songs of their recording sessions from 1988-1989 in Wisconsin, back when the band was demoing their first self-titled release on ATCO Records. The title of the album is a reference to a strip club they frequented in-between sessions there. The songs mostly feature singer Donnie Vie and bassist Chip Z'Nuff along with guitarist Derek Frigo and drummer Vikki Foxx.[2] One newly recorded song, "Dog On a Bone," has bassist Z'Nuff on lead vocals but with no involvement from Vie.[3] Another song, "The Devil Of Shakespeare," was originally recorded around 2004, co- written by author Billy McCarthy and (Z'Nuff) for McCarthy's debut book, The Devil of Shakespeare.(novel). That version and this latest version by Enuff Znuff features McCarthy on drums, the late Jani Lane of Warrant on vocals, along with James Young of Styx on lead guitar.[4]

On October 12, the first promotional song "Rockabye Dreamland" officially appeared on Spotify and other streaming services such as YouTube. A second song, "She Makes It Harder," was also released to streaming services on October 24, as well as a 3rd track, "Good Luv," on November 7.

The first video and single, "Dog On a Bone," was released on November 21.[5]
