County_Hall,_Taunton.jpg COUNTY HALL in Taunton, Somerset is the seat of Somerset County Council. It is a large complex in the municipal neo-Georgian style designed by E. Vincent Harris and listed at Grade II.[1]

The building was constructed in 1935 from English bond buff-coloured and pink bricks with the dressings in Portland stone. The plan of the three-storey building has two wings at 45 degree to the central entrance block with an arch over the door and a coat of arms on the tympanum.[2]

In 2014 plans were announced for Taunton Deane Council to share the County Hall.[3]
