Athletic career

Fabienne Königstein had her first overall appearance in 1997 at the age of 5 for the TSG Wiesloch. In 2001 at the age of 8 she joined SG Nußloch. During the following 5 years she received a basic combined athletic education. To focus on her particular talent for running, Königstein joined the Track and Field Team of Christian Stang at MTG Mannheim in 2006 at the age of 13. After her first appearance at German National Championships in 2008 over the 400m Hurdles (U16) she regularly participated in national and international championships.

In 2013, at the age of 20, Königstein accomplished the breakthrough in the German National Women's competition with a 5th place at the 5000m race and also had her premier appearance for the German National Team at the European Cross-Country Championships in Belgrade. At the European Cross-Country Championships in Chia, Italy, in 2016 she placed 20th in the Women's competition.[1]. Amrhein won the Silver Medal at the German Cross-Country Championships, placed 6th at the World University Games in Taipei over the 21.1 km[2] and celebrated her debut over the Marathon distance at the Berlin Marathon. In adverse weather conditions she finished 11th after 2h 34min and 14sec in a world class field lead by Gladys Cherono. In spring 2018 Königstein finished 3d at the German Half Marathon Championships. Three weeks later at 29 April 2018 she won her first Gold Medal at the German Marathon Championship, finishing 2nd at the Düsseldorf Marathon behind Volha Mazuronak in 2h 32min and 34sec.

On her first appearance at European Marathon Championships in Berlin 2018, Königstein placed 11th, being the most successful German Athlete in this race. In December, Königstein concluded the season with a Bronze Medal at the SPAR European Cross-Country Championships in Tilburg. She placed 19th and, therefore, as the second-best German runner, although she had suffered a severe respiratory infection shortly before the race. By now, 2018 has been the most successful year in her career.
