Personal life

On December 30, 1913, Cecilia married bee farmer John Hendricks and moved to Powell, Wyoming.[2] Their courtship began as an epistolary relationship (pen pals) and their wedding was only the fourth time they had ever seen each other in person.[3] Her detailed letters to her family were published in a 1986 collection entitled _Letters from Honeyhill_.[4]

In 1926, Hendricks ran as the Democratic candidate for the State Superintendent of Public Instruction in Wyoming. The same year, she campaigned for the re-election of Nellie Tayloe Ross, the first woman to be sworn in as governor of a U.S. state in 1924. Both Hendricks and Ross lost the elections and Hendricks returned to Indiana in 1931.[5]

Her research interests included writing instruction, public education reform, and homesteading.[6] She subsequently held the position of John Hay Whitney Professor at Coe College, and received career awards from IU and from the journalism association then known as Theta Sigma Phi.[7]
