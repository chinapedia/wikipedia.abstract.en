The 2018 CALIFORNIA STATE TREASURER GENERAL ELECTION was held on November 6, 2018, to elect the State Treasurer of California. Incumbent Democratic Treasurer John Chiang did not run for re-election to a second term and instead ran unsuccessfully for governor.[1]

The race was between Fiona Ma, Democratic, Chair of the State Board of Equalization (California), and Greg Conlon, Republican, former President of the California Public Utilities Commission,[2] after they won the two top spots from the June 5 direct primary election. Ma won the November election handily with more than 64% of all votes, and garnering more votes than any other candidate for Treasurer in the state's history. Ma's victory installed the first woman of color and only the 2nd CPA to ever serve as California State Treasurer.
