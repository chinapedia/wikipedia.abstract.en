JASMIN KARINA PARIS (born November 1983[1]) is a British runner who has been a national fell running champion and who holds the records for the Bob Graham Round and the Ramsay Round.

She is well known in Great Britain as a fell runner, but became known on the international stage as a sky runner after her victory in the 2016 Skyrunner World Series (Sky Extreme)[2] and bronze medal at the 2016 Skyrunning World Championships (Sky Ultra).[3] She received significant media attention for her overall win in the 2019 Spine Race.[4]


Biography

She is the daughter of mathematicians Jeff Paris and Alena Vencovská.[5]

While at the University of Liverpool, Paris was a member of the Open Air Club which encouraged outdoor pursuits.[6] However, she did not start running until she left university in 2008 and was working in Glossop near her home town of Hadfield in Derbyshire, although she had done some backpacking and walked a lot in the fells. After a twelve-month sabbatical in Minnesota, she returned to the UK, moved to Edinburgh in 2010 and began to take running more seriously.[7]

She has performed particularly well in the longer fell races. Her wins include Wasdale, the Three Peaks Race, Borrowdale, the Langdale Horseshoe, the Isle of Jura and the Ennerdale Horseshoe[8] and she has won the Lakeland Classics Trophy series.[9]

Paris won the Scottish Hill Running Championships in 2014 and 2015[10] and in 2015 and 2018 she won the British Fell Running Championships.[11]

In 2015, Paris began to be more prominent in ultra distance running. In April that year, she set a new women’s record of 11:09 in the Fellsman, finishing fourth overall,[12] and in June, she was the first female finisher and second overall in the five-day Dragon's Back Race in Wales.[13]

On 23 April 2016, Paris completed the Bob Graham Round in a time of 15:24, taking more than two-and-a-half hours off the women’s record previously held by Nicky Spinks.[14] She then ran the Ramsay Round on 18 June in a time of 16:13. This was not only a new women’s record, but an overall fastest known time for the route.[15] It remained the overall record until 2019, when Es Tresidder ran the Round a minute quicker.[16]

The next month, Paris took third place in the Buff Epic Trail 105K which was the 2016 Skyrunning World Championships race for the ultra category.[17] In August, she finished sixth at the UTMB, her first 100-mile race.[18]

In September, Paris was crowned champion in the Extreme series of the 2016 Skyrunner World Series, having won both the Tromsø Skyrace and the Glen Coe Skyline.[19] In October, she set a new women's record for the Paddy Buckley Round with a time of 18:33.[20]

Paris set a new race record in the 2019 Spine Race along the Pennine Way, finishing the on 16 January in 83 hours 12 minutes and 23 seconds. Becoming the first woman to win the event overall, she surpassed the previous record of 95 hours 17 minutes set by Eoin Keith in 2016 and the previous female record of 109 hours 54 minutes achieved by Carol Morgan in 2017.[21]

In 2016, Paris married Konrad Rawlik who is also a runner with a win in the Fellsman.[22] She is a small-animal vet working at the University of Edinburgh and studied acute myeloid leukaemia.[23] Paris has a daughter, Rowan.[24]
