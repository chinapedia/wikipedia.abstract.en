_ART PEPPER WITH DUKE JORDAN IN COPENHAGEN 1981_ is a live album by saxophonist Art Pepper and pianist Duke Jordan recorded in 1981 at the Jazzhus Montmartre by Danmarks Radio and released on the Galaxy label as a double CD in 1996.[1][2]


Reception

The AllMusic review by Steven McDonald noted "Art Pepper was in the process of dying at the time this recording was made, but there's no lack of energy, no loss of vitality. A two-CD live jazz set that's well worth having and should not be overlooked".[3]
