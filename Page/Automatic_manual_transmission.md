AUTOMATIC MANUAL TRANSMISSION (AMT) is a type of automatic sequential manual transmission. Offered by Renault Group's Dacia under the "Easy-R" name, it is founded on electro-mechanical rather than hydraulic technology. The Easy-R automated transmission uses a traditional manual gearbox with an electronically controlled clutch; the gear shifts are automatic, and the need for a clutch pedal is eliminated.[1]

Easy-R is available in the Logan, Logan MCV, and Sandero models.[2] It is also available on the Indian market in the Duster and Renault Kwid.[3][4]


Operation

The Easy-R transmission has the following gears: R, N, D, M+, M-

-   _R_ is the reverse gear. It is similar to R in both traditional manual and in full automatic transmissions.
-   _N_ is the neutral gear. It is similar to N in both traditional manual and full automatic transmissions.
-   _D_ is the drive gear. It is equivalent of D in a full automatic transmission. The gearbox in an AMT car is a manual gearbox, instead of one with a torque converter as in a traditional automatic transmission.
-   _M-_ downshifts a gear in sequential fashion, from M5 (M6 in 6-speed AMT cars) to M1.
-   _M+_ up-shifts a gear in sequential fashion, from M1 to M5 (M6 in 6-speed AMT cars).
