Career

_The Lizzie Bennet Diaries_ and _Pemberley Digital_

_The Lizzie Bennet Diaries_ is an American web series adapted from Jane Austen's _Pride and Prejudice._ The story is conveyed in the form of vlogs.[1][2] It was created by Hank Green and Bernie Su,[3] produced by Jenni Powell[4][5] and stars Ashley Clements, Mary Kate Wiles, Laura Spencer, Julia Cho and Daniel Vincent Gordh. It premiered on YouTube on April 9, 2012[6] and concluded when the 100th episode was posted on March 28, 2013.[7] The story is told in vlog-style by the eponymous character, each episode being between two and eight minutes long.[8]

In 2013, _The Lizzie Bennet Diaries_ won YouTube’s first primetime Emmy.[9] _The Guardian_ called _The Lizzie Bennet Diaries_ "the best Austen adaptation around" at the 200th anniversary of _Pride and Prejudice_.[10] In 2014, _The Lizzie Bennet Diaries_ YouTube Channel was listed on New Media Rockstars Top 100 Channels, ranked at #40.[11]

A DVD set containing every episode of the series and its spinoffs was launched on Kickstarter on March 22, 2013; the initial pledge goal of $60,000 was met within six hours.[12]

Sequels

_Welcome to Sanditon_

Taking place after the events of _The Lizzie Bennet Diaries_,[13] _Welcome to Sanditon_ follows Gigi Darcy as she spends her summer in Sanditon, CA to run a beta demo of the Pemberley Digital Domino application. The residents of Sanditon have all been invited to join in the test, and discover how this “life-revealing” app performs.

The mini-series is a modernized adaptation of Jane Austen's unfinished novel, _Sanditon_. One notable difference from the source material is Gigi replaces the unfinished novel's original heroine, Charlotte Heywood (as _Sanditon_ is actually not connected to _Pride and Prejudice_ in any way).

_Emma Approved_

Taking place after the events of _Welcome to Sanditon_, _Emma Approved_ focuses on Emma Woodhouse, a confident and proud female entrepreneur who believes she is an excellent matchmaker.[14]

The series is a modernized adaptation of Jane Austen's novel, _Emma_.[15] One notable difference from the source material is Caroline Lee replaces Augusta Hawkins as Philip Elton's wife (as _Emma_ is actually not connected to _Pride and Prejudice_ in any way).[16]

_THE SECRET DIARY OF LIZZIE BENNET_

_The Secret Diary of Lizzie Bennet_ is a book by Bernie Su and Kate Rorick which takes readers deep inside Lizzie’s world and well beyond the confines of her camera.[17]

_The Epic Adventures of Lydia Bennet_

_The Epic Adventures of Lydia Bennet_ is a book by Kate Rorick and Rachel Kiley, and audiobook with Mary Kate Wiles performing all the voices, telling Lydia's story from a few months after TLBD for about a year.[18]

_ArtificialNext_

_ArtificialNext_, also referred to as _Artificial,_ is the first ever scripted and interactive show distributed on twitch.tv.[19] Created by Bernie Su and Evan Mandery, Artificial follows Dr. Matt Lin (Tohoru Masamune) and his artificial intelligence creation/daughter Sophie (Tiffany Chu). Dr. Lin socializes Sophie with the live and interactive Twitch audience in order to help her become human. Episodes are broken into recorded and live scenes. In the live scenes, the audience directly influences the story, and, through in-stream polls and comments, helps the characters make decisions. The first season ran weekly from August 12, 2018 through October 25, 2018 for a total of sixteen episodes and accrued more than two million views. The second season began on March 6, 2019, with 4 weekly episodes scheduled (running until March 27, 2019).[20]
