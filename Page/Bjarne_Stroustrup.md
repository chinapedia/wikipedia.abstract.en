BJARNE STROUSTRUP (; ;[1][2] born 30 December 1950) is a Danish computer scientist, who is most notable for the creation and development of the C++ programming language.[3] He is a visiting professor at Columbia University, and works at Morgan Stanley as a Managing Director in New York.[4][5][6][7][8]


Education

Stroustrup has a master's degree in mathematics and computer science (1975) from Aarhus University, Denmark, and a PhD in computer science in 1979 from the University of Cambridge, England[9] supervised by David Wheeler.[10][11]


Career

Stroustrup began developing C++ in 1979 (then called "C with Classes"), and, in his own words, "invented C++, wrote its early definitions, and produced its first implementation... chose and formulated the design criteria for C++, designed all its major facilities, and was responsible for the processing of extension proposals in the C++ standards committee."[12] Stroustrup also wrote a textbook for the language, _The C++ Programming Language_.[13][14]

Stroustrup was the head of AT&T Bell Labs' Large-scale Programming Research department, from its creation until late 2002. Stroustrup was elected member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2004. He was elected a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 1994 and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). From 2002 to 2014, Stroustrup was the College of Engineering Chair in Computer Science Professor at Texas A&M University.[15][16] As of January 2014, Stroustrup is a Managing Director in the technology division of Morgan Stanley in New York City and a Visiting Professor in Computer Science at Columbia University.[17]

Publications

Stroustrup has written or co-written a number of publications,[18][19] including the books _A Tour of C++_,[20] _Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++_,[21] The C++ Programming Language,[22] _Design and Evolution of C++_[23] and _The Annotated C++ Reference Manual_.[24]

Awards and honors

Stroustrup has been a noble doctor at ITMO University since 2013.[25]

Stroustrup won the Senior Dahlâ€“Nygaard Prize in 2015. The same year, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for his invention of the C++ programming language.[26] In 2017, the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) awarded[27][28] him the Faraday Medal, for pioneering C++, one of the most influential programming languages in the history of computing.[29] On January 3, 2018, Stroustrup was announced as the 2018 winner of the Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering, which comes with $500,000.[30] He was named winner of 2018 Computer Pioneer Award of the IEEE Computer Society.[31] He was awarded an honorary doctor from the University Carlos III, Spain on 25 January 2019.
