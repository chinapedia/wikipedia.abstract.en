CAPE TYL'SKY (, _Mys Tyl'sky_) is a prominent headland in Khabarovsk Krai, Russian Federation.


Geography

Cape Tyl'sky is located on the south side of Uda Gulf, in the western Sea of Okhotsk.[1] It rises to a height of 217 m (712 ft). There is a light atop a 22 m (72 ft) tower on the cape which operates from late July to late October.[2]


History

American whaleships cruised for bowhead whales off the cape from 1858 to 1874. They called it SOUTH HEAD.[3] They also anchored off the cape and sent boat crews on extended cruises to Tugur Bay.[4]
