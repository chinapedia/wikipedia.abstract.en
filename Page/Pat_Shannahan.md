PAT SHANNAHAN is a sample clearance expert. Shannahan has worked with artists such as the Beastie Boys, Janet Jackson, and The Avalanches to research and clear many of the samples used in their music.[1]


Career

Shannahan has worked for over 20 years clearing the use of samples for musical artists. Over the course of her career Shannahan has worded for RCA, ABC Music, Island Records, and Polygram recording companies. She researches which publishing company or independent artist controls the rights to the music to broker a deal to include the sample in another artists work.[2] One of the earliest albums she worked on was an unnamed Prince Paul release.[3]

The Avalanches album _Wildflower_ contained many samples, all of which were cleared by Shannahan. One of the most difficult songs to clear was _Noisy Eater_, as it contained samples of the Beatles song _Come Together_.[4]


Personal life

Shannahan lives in Los Angeles, California.[5]
