_CORYMBIA TORTA_ is a bloodwood native to Western Australia[1]

The tree typically grows to a height of and has smooth white bark that is shed from the tree in thin scales.[2] Adult leaves are disjunct, glossy, green to grey-green and concolorous they have a thin, linear to narrow lanceolate or lanceolate shape that is basally tapered. Petioles are narrowly flattened or channelled.[3]

It produces white flowers in May or November[4] and produces an axillary, compound or simple, conflorescence with irregular seven to eleven flowered umbellasters. Fruits that are cylindrical to ovoid and pedicellate containing red or red-brown seeds form later.[5]

The range of _C. torta_ is confined to a part of the Kimberley region where it is found in the Central Kimberley and Northern Kimberley IBRA bioregions. It grows in skeletal sandy soils over sandstone or granite.[6]

There are three subspecies:

-   _Corymbia torta_ subsp. _allanii_
-   _Corymbia torta_ subsp. _mixtifolia_
-   _Corymbia torta_ subsp. _torta_[7]
