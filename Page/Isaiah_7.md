Parashot

The _parashah_ sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.[1] Isaiah 7 is a part of the _Prophecies about Judah and Israel (Isaiah 1-12)_. {P}: open _parashah_; {S}: closed _parashah_.

    {P} 7:1-2 {S} 7:3-6 {P} 7:7-9 {P} 7:10-17 {P} 7:18-20 {P} 7:21-22 {S} 7:23-25 {P}


Verse 1

    _Now it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin, king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to make war against it, but could not prevail against it._[2]

Cross reference: ; Matthew 1:9

The purpose of the war was to bring Judah into an anti-Assyrian coalition.[3]


Verses 3-9

    'Then the Lord said to Isaiah,

        _“Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-Jashub your son,_
        _at the end of the aqueduct from the upper pool, on the highway to the Fuller’s Field,_[4]

-   "Shear-Jashub": literally means "A remnant will return" (; compare Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 8:3) serves "as a good omen for Ahaz."[5]

According to the New Oxford Annotated Bible, the "upper pool" is the "reservoir south of Gihon Spring" ().[6] This was unlikely to be a regular meeting point: the Good News Translation calls the area "the road where the cloth makers work";[7] Ahaz may have gone there to undertake an engineering inspection, to ensure either that the water supplies for Jerusalem were secure, or that they would not be accessible to invading forces.[8]

Isaiah speaks God's word to Ahaz; apparently this is "received in silence, at any rate without acknowledgment".[9]


Verse 14

    _Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel._[10]

Verse 15

    _Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good._[11]

-   "Butter" (, _chem'âh_): could be rendered as "thick and curdled milk".[12]


Verse 18

    _And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria._[13]

The Pulpit Commentary suggests that "the choice of the terms "bee" and "fly" to represent respectively the hosts of Assyria and Egypt, is not without significance. Egyptian armies were swarms, hastily levied, and very imperfectly disciplined. Assyrian were bodies of trained troops accustomed to war, and almost as well disciplined as the Romans."[14]
