The FACULTY OF PHARMACY, UNIVERSITY OF LISBON (FFULisboa) is a Portuguese public institution of higher education dedicated to education, research, knowledge transfer and continuing education in the fields of pharmacy, medicine, and pharmaceutical sciences.[1]

The FFULisboa is a recognized institution at the national and international level. The courses that grant an academic degree are accredited by the Agency for Assessment and Accreditation of Higher Education (A3ES)[2] and the Integrated Master in Pharmaceutical Sciences is also accredited by the Portuguese Pharmaceutical Society (Ordem dos Farmacêuticos) for professional practice.[3]

With the motto, "By knowledge, by innovation," the FFULisboa takes an active role in the dissemination within the field of Pharmaceutical Sciences[4] and further activities addressed to the community regarding public health. Promoting a culture of internationalization, it is associated to many of its academic counterparts and other relevant national and international institutions, in educational and scientific projects, exchange programs and other partnerships.[5][6]


History

Raul_Hestnes_Fereira_Faculdade_de_FarmáciaLisboa_3921.jpg The Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Lisbon was born in 1836 as a School of Pharmacy integrated in the Medical-Surgical School of Lisbon, in which the teaching in the field of pharmacy was assumed by the apothecary of St Joseph's Hospital. With the establishment of the University of Lisbon in March 1911, the School of Pharmacy remained attached to the same institution, now known as Faculty of Medicine of the University of Lisbon.[7]

By Decree No. 4653 of July 14, 1918, it gained autonomy and was named as the Pharmacy School of the University of Lisbon.[8] It continued, however, to share the facilities of the Faculty of Medicine, in a precarious and inadequate situation. Quinta da Torrinha was bought in 1920 to resolve this situation and to build its own facilities. It would be from this former farm that later the Campus (Cidade Universitária) would be created.[9]

In 1921, by Decree No. 7238 of January 18, the School gets the status of the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Lisbon and assigns bachelor and doctoral degrees in pharmacy.[10] In 1932, it was extinguished along with its counterpart of Coimbra, giving way again to a Superior School of Pharmacy, which only granted a bachelor's degree; only in the University of Porto the Faculty of Pharmacy has remained, where were also given the degrees of graduate ("licenciado") and doctor. This would only be reversed in 1968, when it was restored the Pharmacy Faculties of Coimbra and Lisbon, placing them on an equal footing with the Porto academy.[11]

Today, the FFULisboa teaches various curricular units, some of them in hospital environment. Through these, and project curricular units, students are offered a direct relationship interaction with the pharmaceutical profession as well as with the scientific research that is carried out at the faculty's Research Units.[12]
