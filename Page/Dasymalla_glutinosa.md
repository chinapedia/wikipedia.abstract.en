_DASYMALLA GLUTINOSA_ is a flowering plant in the mint family Lamiaceae and is endemic to Western Australia. It is a spreading, sticky shrub with glabrous branches, egg-shaped, stalkless leaves and small, white or cream-coloured, tube-shaped flowers.


Description

_Dasymalla glutinosa_ is a spreading shrub which grows to a height of with sticky but glabrous branches and leaves. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs (that is, they are decussate), oblong to egg-shaped, long, wide with a blunt end.[1]

The flowers are white or cream-coloured and arranged singly in upper leaf axils on a stalk long and sticky. The flowers are surrounded by leafy bracts long. The five sepals are long and sticky with lance-shaped lobes and joined to form a short tube for about half their length. The five petals are joined to form a tube long and mostly glabrous except for a densely hairy ring inside the tube. There are five lobes on the end of the petal tube, the lower one broad egg-shaped to almost round and slightly larger than the other four lobes.[2]


Taxonomy and naming

This species was first formally described in 1979 by Ahmad Abid Munir who gave it the name _Pityrodia glutinosa_ and published the description in _Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden_.[3][4] In 2011, Barry Conn, Murray Henwood and Nicola Streiber resurrected the genus _Dasymalla_ and transferred this species to it as _Dasymalla glutinosa_.[5] The specific epithet (_glutinosa_) is a Latin word meaning "viscous" or "sticky".[6]


Distribution

_Dasymalla glutinosa_ occurs between the Murchison River and Shark Bay[7] in the Carnarvon, Geraldton Sandplains and Yalgoo biogeographic regions growing in sand on sandplains and dunes and in woodland.[8][9]


Conservation

_Dasymalla glutinosa_ is classified as "Priority Three" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife[10] meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.[11]
