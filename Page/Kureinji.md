The KUREINJI, otherwise known as the KERAMIN, are an Aboriginal group whose traditional lands are located in the Northern Riverina of southwest New South Wales, Australia.


Language

Kureinji was one of 35 languages spoken in this area of southwestern New South Wales, around and north of the border with Victoria. Linguistically the tribe was part of the Lower Murray Areal group.


Country

According to Norman Tindale the Kureinji's traditional lands embraced some of territory, running in good part along the northern banks of the Murray River, ranging from the vicinity of Euston to Wentworth downstream. Across the river from the Kureinji, Mildura, which is in Latjilatji tribal land, was first settled in 1847.

Kemendok National Park is part of their traditional land, and traces of their habitation remains in scar trees, fire hearths, flaked stone artefacts, burial sites and middens.


History

Charles Sturt[1] passed through their country in 1830 but did not mention the Kureinji, Charles Lockhart in 1862 also appears to mention, without however actually specifying this tribe. Many of the Kureinji today live in Mildura.

During colonial times, bodies were taken from five burial sites along the New South Wales side of the Murray River, and are now part of the _Murray Black Collection_. Tribal groups have been seeking the repatriation of these bodies.
