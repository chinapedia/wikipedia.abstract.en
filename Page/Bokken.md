Various_bokken_or_bukuto.jpg A _BOKKEN_ (, _bok(u)_, "wood", and _ken_, "sword") (or a _bokutō_ , as they are instead called in Japan) is a Japanese wooden sword used for training. It is usually the size and shape of a _katana_, but is sometimes shaped like other swords, such as the _wakizashi_ and _tantō_. Some ornamental bokken are decorated with mother-of-pearl work and elaborate carvings. Sometimes it is spelled "boken" in English. _Bokken_ should not be confused with _shinai_, practice swords made of flexible bamboo.


History

_Bokken_ were designed to lessen the damage caused by fighting with real swords and were used for the training of samurai warriors in feudal Japan. Bokken eventually became lethal weapons themselves in the hands of trained experts.[1]

Miyamoto Musashi, a kenjutsu master, was renowned for fighting fully armed foes with only one or two bokkens. In a famous legend, he defeated Sasaki Kojiro with a bokken he had carved from an oar while traveling on a boat to the predetermined island for the duel.[2]

Although it is hard to determine precisely when the first Bokken appeared due to the nature of secrecy in ancient martial arts training, the oldest Bokken known to have been used as training tools date from the Edo period. Before the Meiji era, Bokken very likely manufactured by woodworkers not specialized in Bokken manufacture. It is at the beginning of the 20th century that Bokken manufacture started, mainly in Miyakonojo (Kyushu region). Today, the last four workshops of Japan are still located in Miyakonojo.

The "standard Bokken", mostly used in Kendo and Aikido was created by master Aramaki in collaboration with the All Japan Kendo Federation in the 50's and was the first standardized Bokken ever created. [3]


Usage

Several_bokken.jpg The _bokken_ is used as an inexpensive and relatively safe substitute for a real sword in several martial arts such as _aikido_, _kendo_, _iaido_, _kenjutsu_ and _jodo_. Its simple wooden construction demands less care and maintenance than a katana. In addition, training with a bokken does not carry the same mortal risk associated with that of a sharp metal sword, both for the user and other practitioners nearby. While its use has several advantages over use of a live edged weapon, it can still be deadly, and any training with a bokken should be done with due care. Injuries occurring from bokken are very similar to those caused by clubs and similar battering weapons and include compound fractures, ruptured organs, and other such blunt force injuries. In some ways, a bokken can be more dangerous as the injuries caused are often unseen and inexperienced practitioners may underestimate the risk of harm. It is not a sparring weapon, but is intended to be used in kata and to acclimate the student to the feel of a real sword. For sparring, a bamboo shinai is typically used instead for obvious safety reasons.

In 2003, the All Japan Kendo Federation (AJKF) introduced a set of basic exercises using a _bokuto_ called _Bokuto Ni Yoru Kendo Kihon-waza Keiko-ho_. This form of practice is intended primarily for kendo practitioners up to Nidan ranking, but can be beneficial for all kendo students.[4]

_Suburito_ are _bokken_ designed for use in _suburi_. _Suburi_, literally "bare swinging," are solo cutting exercises. Suburito are thicker and heavier than normal _bokken_ and users of suburito must therefore develop both strength and technique. Their weight makes them unsuitable for paired practice and solo forms. One famous user of the suburi-sized bokken is Miyamoto Musashi who used one in his duel against Sasaki Kojiro.

As late as 2015, bokken were issued to the Los Angeles Police Mounted Unit for use as batons.[5][6]


Types of bokken

Bokken can be made to represent any style of weapon required such as nagamaki, no-dachi, yari, naginata, kama, etc. The most widely used styles are:

-   _daitō_ or _tachi_ (katana-sized), long sword
-   _shoto_ or _kodachi_ or _wakizashi bo_, short sword, (wakizashi-sized)
-   _tantō bo_ (tantō-sized)
-   _suburito_ can be made in _daitō_ and _shoto_ sizes

Additionally, various koryu (traditional Japanese martial arts) have their own distinct styles of bokken which can vary slightly in length, tip shape, or in whether or not a tsuba (hilt guard) is added.

The All Japan Kendo Federation specify the dimensions of _bokken_ for use in the modern kendo kata, called _Nippon kendo kata_.[7]

-   Tachi: Total length, approx. 102 cm; _tsuka_ (handle) approx. 24 cm.
-   Kodachi: Total length, approx. 55 cm; _tsuka_ (handle) approx. 14 cm.


Bokken in fiction

Bokken has been depicted in film, manga, anime, and comic books.

-   In the film _The Last Samurai_, the bokken is seen in multiple instances. In one scene a group of children is playing/sparring with them. Later in the film, Nathan Algren (played by Tom Cruise) is seen undergoing sword training with a bokken.
-   In Hiroyuki Takei's manga and anime series _Shaman King_, Umemiya Ryunosuke possesses a wooden sword and uses it as his main weapon, and is accordingly known as "Wooden Sword" Ryu.
-   In the anime "Outlaw Star" Twilight Suzuka utilizes a bokken with immense skill and is able to use it more efficiently than an actual sword.
-   In the anime "Demon City Shinjuku", the hero Kyoya Izayoi wields a bokken which he can infuse with spiritual energy.
-   In the _Wolverine_ limited series (1982) by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, Wolverine is nearly killed by Shingen Yashida, using a bokken to deliver nerve strikes.
-   In the anime and the manga, _Gin Tama_, the protagonist, Gintoki Sakata, uses a bokken as his main weapon. His skills with it are powerful enough to overpower even real swords.
-   In the anime and manga, _Rurouni Kenshin_, Kamiya Kaoru uses a bokken as her main weapon.
-   In the anime and light novel series, _Toradora!_, Aisaka Taiga can be seen wielding a bokken.
-   In the anime and manga, _Ranma ½_, Kuno Tatewaki wields a bokken and occasionally a shinai.
-   In the anime and manga, _Highschool of the Dead_, Saeko Busujima initially wield a bokken. She replaces it with a katana later in the series.
