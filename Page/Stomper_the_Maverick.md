History

The athletics teams of Minnesota State University, Mankato have changed over the years. Initially as a teacher preparatory college there was no formal mascot until the 1920s when the nickname the "peds" was used to refer to the pedagogues an informal reference to teachers. In the 1950s the mascot the Indians were adopted, but this was dropped in 1976 due to the fact that Native American groups saw this as not representative of their culture. During 1977 there was a competition to come up with a new mascot. During the same time then Mankato State University was transitioning to a new athletic conference, the North Central Conference. The winning suggestion was from Professor Roy Cook, a native of Texas, who suggested the Maverick.[3] The Maverick is a wild powerful steer, unbranded and unyielding.

From this Stomper the Maverick, the mascot was born in the 1980s and officially given the name "Stomper" during Homecoming festivies in 1993 (officially unveiled Oct. 14, 1993). Over the years Stomper has had different designs, with the most recent redesign in 2006.[4]
