FAINA VASILYEVNA SHEVCHENKO (, born 17 July 1893, Voronezh, Imperial Russia, — died 10 May 1971, Moscow, Soviet Union) was a Russian and Soviet stage and film actress, the People's Artist of the USSR (1948) and the recipient of several high-profile state awards (including the Order of Lenin, 1938) and twice the Stalin Prize laureate (1943, 1946).[1]

One of the leading actresses of the Moscow Art Theatre (where she debuted in 1914 and stayed until 1959), Shevchenko excelled in Russian drama classics and was best remembered for her roles in the plays by Alexander Ostrovsky, including _Enough Stupidity in Every Wise Man_ (1920), _An Ardent Heart_ (1926), _The Storm_ (1934), _The Last Victim_ (1944) and _The Forest_ (1948), as well as by Maxim Gorky (_The Lower Depths_, 1916).[2] She was cast in seven films, including _David Guramishvili_ (1946), _The Composer Glinka_ (1952) and _The Lower Depths_ (1952).[3] "Dazzlingly simple, vivid, filled to the brim with life, endowed with huge temperament and open heart," was how the theatre historian Pavel Markov described her in his book of memoirs.[4]

She was said to be the artist Boris Kustodiev's favourite model and, as a 21-year-old, sat nude for his _The Beauty_ sessions. This daring venture caused scandal and almost cost Shevchenko her place in the troupe.[5][6]
