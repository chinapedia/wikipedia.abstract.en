The 2016 SAMARINDA CHURCH BOMBING was a terrorist attack that occurred on 13 November 2016 when a man named Juhanda detonated a Molotov bomb in front of Oikumene Church in Samarinda Seberang, Samarinda, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, where children were playing. At least 1 toddler was killed in the incident and 3 other toddlers were injured. In September 2017, Juhanda and four others were convicted of the attack, with Juhanda sentenced to life imprisonment, while the others received sentences ranging from six to seven years.

The bombing was the second attack on church in Indonesia in 2016, with the first attack occurred in Medan on August when an ISIS sympathiser attacked a priest during a mass. It was also the second terror attack to occur in less than a month, after another ISIS sympathiser was shot dead after wounding 3 police officers with a machete in Tangerang.


Bombing

The explosion occurred on 10:10 WITA (Central Indonesian Time), on Oikumene Church located on Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Road in Sengkotek, Loa Janan Ilir District, Samarinda. Oikumene Church is the most popular church in Sengkotek.[1] At the time, the prayer service had just finished and crowds were getting out from the church. Prosecutors said Juhanda traveled to the church by motorbike, carrying a bag full of black explosive powder and a fuse, intending to cause mass casualties. But instead it exploded when he fell from the bike in front of the church, where children were playing.[2][3] 4 toddlers were injured in the explosion. Juhanda immediately ran away, but later was caught by locals and people from the church after he fell into Mahakam River.[4]

The perpetrator was identified by the Indonesian National Police as Juhanda, who had only been released from jail a few months before the Samarinda attack; he had been previously convicted of attempted terror against the Christ Cathedral in Jakarta, and a series of "book bombings" where explosives were hidden in books and sent to activists, both occurring in 2011.[6] At the time, he joined a terrorist group identified by the police as Pepy Vernando.[7] Before he lived in Samarinda, he settled in Bogor. He moved to Samarinda in 2015 and worked in local mosque.[8] Juhanda was noticed by people shortly before the attack using a "Jihad, Way of life" T-shirt outside the church. He was sentenced to 3 years and 6 months in prison by the Jakarta's Civil Court on 29 February 2012. In July 2014, Juhanda was released[9] due to Eid Al-Fitr remission and immediately joined another terrorist group in East Kalimantan, named as the JAD, which has a link with the Anshori Group, another terrorist group that could bring weapons from the Philippines.

On 25 September 2017, Juhanda was sentenced to life imprisonment. Juhanda was arrested and convicted along with four others, all five accused of belonging to the JAD group. The others received sentences ranging from six to seven years.[10]
