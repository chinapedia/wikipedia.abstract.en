BRYAN MCDANIEL TAYLOR (born March 2, 1976) is an American lawyer and former Alabama state senator, currently serving as general counsel to the governor of Alabama, Kay Ivey.[1] Taylor also served as policy director and counsel to Gov. Bob Riley before being elected to the Alabama Senate in 2010.[2] Taylor began his legal career as an active duty Army judge advocate and served a combat tour in Iraq.[3] Prior to joining the Ivey Administration, Taylor served as general counsel for the Alabama Department of Finance, the cabinet-level agency responsible for the state's fiscal management and overall administration.[4]

In the 2010 election cycle that saw the Republicans in Alabama win control of the State Legislature for the first time since Reconstruction,[5] Taylor was elected to the Alabama Senate over the seven-term incumbent Wendell Mitchell (D-Luverne),[6] becoming the first Republican ever to represent the 30th District. Taylor is "perhaps best known as the author of Alabamaâ€™s new ethics law."[7] Taylor was an advocate for legislative term limits.[8] He decided not to run for re-election in 2014, saying he wanted to "focus on family and [his] private sector career."[9] He is succeeded by Clyde Chambliss (R-Prattville, Ala.).
