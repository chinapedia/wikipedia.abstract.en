ZINEDIN MUSTEDANAGIĆ (; born 1 August 1998) is a Bosnian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Czech First League club Sparta Prague and the Bosnia and Herzegovina U21 national team.


Club career

Sparta Prague

Mustedanagić is a product of Sparta Prague's youth academy, with whom he signed his first professional contract in August 2015.[1] He made his professional debut in a cup game against České Budějovice on 12 October 2016 at the age of 18.[2] Two weeks later, he made his league debut in a 4–0 home win against Příbram.[3]

On 25 January 2017, Mustedanagić signed a new three-year deal with the club.[4]

Two days later, he was sent on a year-long loan to Dukla Prague.[5] During the loan, on 11 March, he scored his first professional goal against Jablonec, which ensured his team a triumph.[6]

Loan to Ružomberok

In August 2018, Mustedanagić was loaned to Slovak Fortuna liga club Ružomberok.[7] It was said, that he re-joined David Holoubek, who previously served as a youth manager in Sparta, to advance Mustedanagić in his career, as well as to increase his play-time due to an overload of players in Sparta's senior team.[8]

In Slovakia, Mustedanagić immediately became a starting-XI player and a crucial part of the team, playing in his preferred position, as an attacking midfielder. In his debut match against Spartak Trnava, that concluded as a goal-less tie, on 26 August 2018, Mustedanagić played the entire match and was booked with a yellow card.[9] He scored his first header goal against Nitra over a month later, after a cross from Peter Gál-Andrezly.[10] By the end of the season he scored 4 more league goals (plus 2 more in the Slovak Cup against FK Gerlachov), including one against Slovan Bratislava, in an unexpected 3–2 win over the season's champions.

This marked the first competitive defeat for Slovan at the newly reconstructed Tehelné pole and meant, that after 16 rounds Ružomberok re-gained the 3rd place in the table overcoming Žilina, to the place guaranteeing them a spot in the qualifying round of next season's Europa League.[11] Ružomberok managed to hold on to that position in the remaining three fixtures of the season.


International career

Mustedanagić represented Bosnia and Herzegovina on all youth levels. He also served as captain of under-17 and under-19 teams.[12]
