The 2017 WINNIPEG BLUE BOMBERS SEASON was the 60th season for the team in the Canadian Football League (CFL) and their 85th season overall. This was the fourth season under head coach Mike O'Shea and the fourth full season under general manager Kyle Walters.

The Blue Bombers clinched a playoff berth for the second consecutive season with a win over the BC Lions on October 14, 2017.[1] The team hosted a CFL playoff game for the first time since 2011 (and a West Division playoff game for the first time since 2003) after finishing in second place with a 12-6 record. However, they lost that West Semi-Final game to the Edmonton Eskimos.
