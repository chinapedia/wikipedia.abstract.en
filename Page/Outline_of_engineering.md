The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to engineering:

ENGINEERING is the scientific discipline and profession that applies scientific theories, mathematical methods, and empirical evidence to design, create, and analyze technological solutions cognizant of safety, human factors, physical laws, regulations, practicality, and cost.


Branches of Engineering

-   Aerospace engineering – branch of engineering behind the design, construction and science of aircraft and spacecraft. It is broken into two major and overlapping branches:
    -   Aeronautical engineering – deals with craft that stay within Earth's atmosphere
    -   Astronautical engineering – deals with craft that operates outside of Earth's atmosphere
-   Applied engineering – application of management, design, and technical skills for the design and integration of systems, the execution of new product designs, the improvement of manufacturing processes, and the management and direction of physical and/or technical functions of a firm or organization.
