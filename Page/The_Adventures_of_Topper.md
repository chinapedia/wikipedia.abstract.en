_THE ADVENTURES OF TOPPER_ is a radio situation comedy in the United States. It was broadcast on NBC June 7, 1945 - September 13, 1945,[1] as a summer replacement for Dinah Shore's program.[2]


Format

The 30-minute program was based on characters created by novelist Thorne Smith. Cosmo Topper, a businessman, bought the house that had been inhabited by George and Marian Kerby before they died. He had no idea that the Kerbys' ghosts haunted the house. Confusion arose because only Topper could see the ghosts, leading his wife to wonder why he spoke to people who apparently were not there.[3]

David C. Tucker, in his book, _The Women Who Made Television Funny: Ten Stars of 1950s Sitcoms_, cited the program's ghost-based premise as one reason for its lack of success: "As noted by _Variety_'s reviewer, however, a comedy centered on the antics of appearing and disappearing ghosts 'reads good on paper and was even enhanced in the film treatment,' but played less well on radio, resulting in a show he found 'singularly unfunny.'"[4]

The program was sponsored by Post Toasties cereal and Maxwell House coffee.[5]
