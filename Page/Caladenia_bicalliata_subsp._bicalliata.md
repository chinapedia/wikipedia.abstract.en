_CALADENIA BICALLIATA_ SUBSP. _BICALLIATA_, commonly known as the LIMESTONE SPIDER ORCHID or DWARF LIMESTONE SPIDER ORCHID, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is native to the south-west of Western Australia and coastal areas of South Australia. It has a single erect, hairy leaf and one or two cream-coloured flowers with reddish-brown tips.


Description

_Caladenia bicalliata_ subsp. _bicalliata_ is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which occurs singly or in small clumps. It has a single erect, very hairy, linear to lance-shaped leaf, long and wide. The inflorescence is a raceme, high with one or two flowers, each flower long and wide. The dorsal sepal is about long and abruptly narrows about one-third of its length from the base. The lateral sepals and petals are cream or greenish-cream, much shorter than those of the similar _C. abbreviata_ and _C. evanescens_ and have reddish-brown tips. The lateral sepals are less than long and thread-like for about half their length and the petals are about the same length and gradually taper to a thread-like tip. The labellum is egg-shaped, about long, wide and white with red stripes. The edge of the labellum is serrated and there are two rows of white-tipped calli along its centre. Flowering occurs from August to early October, however the flowers are often open for only one or two days and sometimes self-pollinate and do not open at all.[1][2][3][4]


Taxonomy and naming

_Caladenia bicalliata_ was first formally described by Richard Rogers in 1909[5] but in 2001 Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown described two subspecies, including subspecies _bicalliata_ and the description of the two subspecies was published in _Nuytsia_[6]


Distribution and habitat

Limestone spider orchid occurs in a narrow coastal strip, growing in calcareous soil between Kalbarri and Esperance in Western Australia and along the south-east coast but sometimes up to inland in South Australia.[7][8][9][10]


Conservation

_Caladenia bicalliata_ subsp. _bicalliata_ is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[11]
