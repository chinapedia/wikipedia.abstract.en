_THE GENUINE IMITATION LIFE GAZETTE_ is a 1969 psychedelic pop album by American band the Four Seasons. With musical influences changing in the late 1960s, the Four Seasons teamed up with Jake Holmes to create a concept album that placed their traditional pop stylings into the psychedelic era.[1] Instead of love songs, the group tackled subjects such as war and racial tension.[2]

The album's packaging was also distinctive, with the cover being stylized as a newspaper and the sleeve containing an eight-page newspaper-like insert that also had specially-done color underground comics strips by Skip Williamson and Jay Lynch. This unique packaging inspired John Lennon and the band Jethro Tull to use the concept for later albums of their own.[3]

The first single issued 7 months before the album's release (5/68) was "Saturday's Father" (Philips 40542). It only bubbled under at #103 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. A 2nd single with both sides culled from the album, "Idaho" and "Something's on Her Mind," was released in March 1969 as Philips 40597. Both sides barely crept into the Billboard Hot 100, at #95 and #98, respectively.[4]


Critical reception

In a review for AllMusic, Donald A. Guarisco says the album "lives up to its reputation as the most bizarre album in the Four Seasons' catalog", describing it as "a concept album that casts a satirical eye on American life." He calls it "relentlessly inventive, skillfully constructed, and never dull" and "a stunning example of the artistry of the Four Seasons at their most ambitious."[5]
