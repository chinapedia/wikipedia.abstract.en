History

The Catholic University of America announced Jan. 8, 2013 the creation of a School of Business and Economics. Previously housed in the School of Arts and Sciences as _Department of Business and Economics_, the University’s Board of Trustees voted in December 2012 to confirm the creation of the school commencing Jan. 1, 2013 after a three-year process of discernment, evaluation, and planning.[1][2]

In 2016, the School was renamed the _Tim and Steph Busch School of Business and Economics_ after a $15 million donation from the Busch Family Foundation. Tim Busch, a businessman from Irvine, California, and a university trustee, is founder and chief executive of Pacific Hospitality Group and The Busch Firm.[3] The donation went to renovating the business school’s Maloney Hall, fund its academic programs and to support the new _Institute for Human Ecology_, which will respond to Pope Francis’ call in his 2015 encyclical Laudato si'.[4]

In May 2017 NC Register reported that the school began to offer a Master of Science in Ecclesial Administration and Management "to give current or future pastors the tools they need to wisely shepherd their parishes’ material goods and personnel, so they can effectively carry out their mission to proclaim the Gospel."[5]

On February 6, 2018, The Tower[6] reported that, "The Economics major, previously offered by the Busch School of Business and Economics, will move under the School of Arts and Sciences in the fall of 2018."
