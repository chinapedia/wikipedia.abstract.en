KUMQUATS (or CUMQUATS in Australian English, ;[1] _Citrus japonica_) are a group of small fruit-bearing trees in the flowering plant family Rutaceae. They were previously classified as forming the now historical genus _Fortunella_, or placed within _Citrus sensu lato_.

The edible fruit closely resembles the orange (_Citrus sinensis_) in color and shape but is much smaller, being approximately the size of a large olive. Kumquat is a fairly cold-hardy citrus.


Etymology

The English name "kumquat" derives from the Cantonese _gām-gwāt_ , literally meaning "golden orange" or "golden tangerine". In Japanese they are called _kinkan_ (金柑).


Origin

The kumquat plant is native to south Asia and the Asia-Pacific region. The earliest historical reference to kumquats appears in literature of China from the 12th century. They have long been cultivated in India, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and southeast Asia. They were introduced to Europe in 1846 by Robert Fortune, collector for the London Horticultural Society, and shortly thereafter were brought to North America.

They are slow-growing evergreen shrubs or short trees that stand tall, with dense branches, sometimes bearing small thorns. The leaves are dark glossy green, and the flowers are white, similar to other citrus flowers, and can be borne singly or clustered within the leaf-axils. Depending on size, the kumquat tree can produce hundreds or even thousands of fruits each year.[2]


Varieties

Citrus taxonomy is complicated and controversial. Different systems place different types of kumquat in different species, or unite them into as few as two species. Historically they were viewed as falling within the genus _Citrus_, but the Swingle system of citrus taxonomy elevated them to their own genus, _Fortunella_. Recent phylogenetic analysis suggests they do indeed fall within _Citrus_. Swingle divided the kumquats into two subgenera, the _Protocitrus_, containing the primitive Hong Kong kumquat, and _Eufortunella_, comprising the round, oval kumquat, Meiwa kumquats,[3] to which Tanaka added two others, the Malayan kumquat and the Jiangsu kumquat. Chromosomal analysis suggested that Swingle's _Eufortunella_ represent a single 'true' species, while Tanaka's additional species were revealed to be likely hybrids of _Fortunella_ with other _Citrus_, so-called _Citrofortunella_.[4] Recent genomic analysis concluded there was only one true species of kumquat, but the analysis did not include the Hong Kong variety seen as a distinct species in all earlier analyses.[5]

Round kumquat

The ROUND KUMQUAT, MARUMI KUMQUAT or MORGANI KUMQUAT (retaining the name _Citrus japonica_ or _Fortunella japonica_ when kumquats are divided into multiple species), is an evergreen tree that produces edible golden-yellow fruit. The fruit is small and usually spherical but can be oval shaped. The peel has a sweet flavor, but the fruit has a distinctly sour center. The fruit can be eaten cooked but is mainly used to make marmalades, jellies, and other spreads. It is grown in Luxembourg and can be used in bonsai cultivation. The plant symbolizes good luck in China and other Asian countries, where it is often kept as a houseplant and given as a gift during the Lunar New Year. Round kumquats are more commonly cultivated than other species due to their high cold tolerance.

Oval kumquat

Citrus_japonica_'Centennial_Variegated'_-_Kumquat.jpg Citrus_japonica_'Centennial_Variegated'_-_Kumquat_-_fruit.jpg The OVAL KUMQUAT or NAGAMI KUMQUAT[6] (_Citrus margarita_ or _Fortunella margarita_ if dividing _Eufortunella_ kumquats into separate species) is ovoid in shape and typically eaten whole, skin and all. The inside is still quite sour, but the skin has a very sweet flavour, so when eaten together an unusual tart-sweet, refreshing flavour is produced. The fruit ripens mid- to late winter and always crops very heavily, creating a spectacular display against the dark green foliage. The tree tends to be much smaller and dwarf in nature, making it ideal for pots and occasionally bonsai cultivation.

The 'Centennial Variegated' kumquat cultivar arose spontaneously from the oval kumquat. It produces a greater proportion of fruit to peel than the oval kumquat, and the fruit are rounder and sometimes necked. Fruit are distinguishable by their variegation in color, exhibiting bright green and yellow stripes. The tree is distinguishable by its lack of thorns.Centennial at the Citrus Variety Collection

Meiwa kumquat

The MEIWA KUMQUAT (_Citrus crassifolia_ or _Fortunella crassifolia_) was brought to Japan from China at the end of the 19th century, it has seedy oval fruits and thick leaves, and was characterized as a different species by Swingle.[7] Its fruit is typically eaten skin and all.

Hong Kong kumquat

The HONG KONG KUMQUAT (_Citrus hindsii_ or _Fortunella hindsii_) produces only pea-sized bitter and acidic fruit with very little pulp and large seeds. It is primarily grown as an ornamental plant, though it is also found in southern China growing in the wild.[8][9] Not only is it the most primitive of the kumquats, but with the kumquats being the most primitive citrus, Swingle described it as the closest to the ancestral species from which all citrus evolved.[10] While the wild Hong Kong kumquat is tetraploid, there is a commercial diploid variety, the GOLDEN BEAN KUMQUAT with slightly larger fruit.[11]

Jiangsu kumquat

The JIANGSU KUMQUAT or FUKUSHU KUMQUAT (_Citrus obovata_ or _Fortunella obovata_) bears edible fruit that can be eaten raw, as well as made into jelly and marmalade. The fruit can be round or bell-shaped and is bright orange when fully ripe. The plant can be distinguished from other kumquats by its distinctly round leaves. It is typically grown for its edible fruit and as an ornamental plant, but cannot withstand frost like the round kumquat. These kumquats are often seen near the Yuvraj section of the Nayak Province. Chromosomal analysis showed this variety to be a likely hybrid.[12]

Malayan kumquat

The MALAYAN KUMQUAT (_Fortunella polyandra_ or in _Citrus_, Tanaka's _Fortunella swinglei_), from the Malay Peninsula where it is known as the "hedge lime" (_limau pagar_), is another hybrid, perhaps a limequat.[13][14] It has a thin peel on larger fruit compared to other kumquats.[15]


Cultivation and uses

Kumquats are much hardier than citrus plants such as oranges. The Nagami kumquat requires a hot summer, ranging from 25 °C to 38 °C (77 °F to 100 °F), but can withstand frost down to about without injury.

In cultivation in the UK, _Citrus japonica_ has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit[16] (confirmed 2017).[17]

Propagation and pollination

Kumquats do not grow well from seeds and so are vegetatively propagated by using rootstock of another citrus fruit,[18] air layering, or cuttings (using a rooting gel/powder).[19] Like most citrus, they are self-pollinating.


Composition

The essential oil of the kumquat peel contains much of the aroma of the fruit, and is composed principally of limonene, which makes up around 93% of the total.[20] Besides limonene and alpha-pinene (0.34%), both of which are considered monoterpenes, the oil is unusually rich (0.38% total) in sesquiterpenes such as α-bergamotene (0.021%), caryophyllene (0.18%), α-humulene (0.07%) and α-muurolene (0.06%), and these contribute to the spicy and woody flavor of the fruit. Carbonyl compounds make up much of the remainder, and these are responsible for much of the distinctive flavor. These compounds include esters such as isopropyl propanoate (1.8%) and terpinyl acetate (1.26%); ketones such as carvone (0.175%); and a range of aldehydes such as citronellal (0.6%) and 2-methylundecanal. Other oxygenated compounds include nerol (0.22%) and trans-linalool oxide (0.15%).[21]
