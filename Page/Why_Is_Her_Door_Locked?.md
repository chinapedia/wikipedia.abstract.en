Plot

Emily is receiving a great deal more verbal lashings from Mrs. Bridges. An example is when Emily mistakenly put salt into the sugar jar, which ruins one of Mrs. Bridges' puddings. During Emily's affair with William, Mrs Bridges continues her vicious tongue lashings at Emily, taunting her about William's real intentions and mocking her dreams of marriage. After Emily's death, Mrs. Bridges takes leave of her senses. She is sitting in her chair, crying brokenheartedly, and feeling very guilty. Mrs. Bridges, distraught with remorse over Emily's death, steals a baby from its pram outside a shop and hides it in her room, locking her door. Richard and Lady Marjorie return the baby to its parents Lily and Arthur Webber. Mrs Bridges only escapes a jail sentence after Hudson agrees to marry her once they are no longer in service.[1][2]
