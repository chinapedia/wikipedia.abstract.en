The MEN'S INDIVIDUAL PURSUIT cycling events at the 2016 SUMMER PARALYMPICS took place on September 8â€“11 at Rio Olympic Velodrome. Six events took place over six classifications.


Classification

Cyclists are given a classification depending on the type and extent of their disability. The classification system allows cyclists to compete against others with a similar level of function. The class number indicates the severity of impairment with "1" being most impaired.

Cycling classes for track cycling are:

-   B: Blind and visually impaired cyclists use a Tandem bicycle with a sighted pilot on the front
-   C 1-5: Cyclists with an impairment that affects their legs, arms and/or trunk but are capable of using a standard bicycle
