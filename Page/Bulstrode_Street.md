Bulstrode_Street_W1.jpg BULSTRODE STREET is a street in Marylebone in the City of Westminster that runs from Welbeck Street in the east to Thayer Street in the west. It is crossed only by Marylebone Lane.


History

Bulstrode Street was laid out when the Marylebone area was urbanised on a grid pattern in the early 1700s.[1] It is named after Bulstrode Park in Buckinghamshire which was in the ownership of the first Duke of Portland and was the family seat until 1810. The second Duke married Margaret Cavendish, the only child and heiress of Edward Harley of Harley Street fame, and thus acquired the land on which Bulstrode Street stands.[2]


Buildings
