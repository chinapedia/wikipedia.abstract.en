Diagonal_Scale_instrument.jpg DIAGONAL SCALE is an engineering measuring instrument which is composed of a set of parallel straight lines which are obliquely crossed by another set of straight lines. Diagonal scales are used to measure small fractions of the unit of measurement.[1]


Etymology

Diagonal scale is derived from the Latin word _Diagonalis_. The Latin word was originally coined from the Greek word _diag≈çnios_ where _dia_ means "through" and _gonios_ denotes "corners".[2][3]


Principle of Diagonal scale

Diagonal scale follows the principle of similar triangles where a short length is divided into number of parts in which sides are proportional.[4] Divided into required number of equal parts


Application

Diagonal scale is used in engineering to read lengths with higher accuarcy as it represents a unit into three different multiple in metres, centimeters and millimeters.[5] Diagonal scale is an important part in Engineering drawings.[6]
