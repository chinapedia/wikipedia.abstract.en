_BIULETYN PERYGLACJALNY_ was a scientific journal covering research on periglacial geomorphology. It was established in 1954 in Łódź by Polish geomorphologist Jan Dylik, who was its editor-in-chief until 1972.[1][2] The journal ceased publication after 39 issues in 2000,[3] after having played an important role in the development of periglacial geomorphology.[4]
