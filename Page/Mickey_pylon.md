Mickey_Mouse_shaped_transmission_tower_Celebration_FL.jpg The MICKEY PYLON is a tall double-deadend pole-type 230-kV power line pylon in front of Osceola Substation, which is used for the power supply of Walt Disney World near Orlando, Florida, and which was completed on February 15, 1996. The pylon is in the form of a stylized Mickey Mouse head.[1] It consists of a high pole carrying a circular steel tube ring in diameter, at which two smaller elliptical rings with axis lengths of and . The head weights . It is located along Interstate 4 on the north side of the highway, at the junction with World Drive and the Central Florida GreeneWay (Exit 62).

As the rings were not transportable on public roads, they were designed for an assembly at the construction site. Each ring is constructed from galvanized steel tubing.

The support pole was fabricated by North American Pole Corp. (NAPCO), Dallas, Texas, USA, while the rings were bent by Bend-Tec of Duluth, Minnesota, from steel tubes manufactured in Chicago, Illinois, and transported to NAPCO for galvanization.

The pylon can be illuminated at night by fiber-optic cables at the rings, which are fed from a laser installed at the ground through a telecommunications-grade fiber running inside the pole.

Polymer insulators are used to minimize visual effects.
