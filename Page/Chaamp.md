Critical reception

_The Times of India_ praised the film, giving _Chaamp_ 3.5 stars out of 5 and calling the film a must watch.[9] Their review praised the directing by Raj Chakraborty, saying that the film shows his coming of age as a director. Despite calling him "deadpan as usual", the review notes that Dev has been played to his strengths and has the perfect body language. Rukmini Maitra was praised for debut performance, being called a natural in the review. The rest of the cast was commended for their performances, including Chiranjeet Chakraborty, Priyanka Sarkar, Kamaleshwar Mukherjee, and Supriyo Dutta. The review also commended the crew, specifically cinematographer Soumik Halder, art director Tanmoy Chakraborty and editor Md Kalam. However, the film's story was criticized for its similarities to _Sultan_, a 2016 Hindi film also about the comeback of an athlete.[10] Dev told they wanted to do a film based on a Moti Nandi's story but didnâ€™t get the rights to it, hence Chaamp was made.[11]


Soundtrack

There are 2 additional songs by Raftaar and Anupam Roy which were not in the film but in the soundtrack. The soundtrack was initially released on Saavn on 14 May 2017,[12] and was later released on other streaming services like Apple Music on 10 June 2017.[13]

Jeet Gannguli, one of the composers of the soundtrack, expressed disappointment with the inclusion of Anupam Roy and Raftaar on the soundtrack.[14] He explained that he initially composed four tracks for the soundtrack, and felt that since he had already done that, he should complete the soundtrack by composing the rest of the music. Gannguli further explained that he is not fond of the trend of hiring multiple composers for a single soundtrack album, a trend which has become popular in the Hindi film industry.[15]

Album critical reception

"Jaya Tomari" has been described as a runaway hit,[16] and was commended along with "Maula Re" and "Tumio Chaamp".[17]
