Early life

Randy is a native of Vienna, Virginia.[2] His dad served in the US Navy: "When my family finally settled in the Washington, D.C., area after moving around the country because of my dad’s service in the Navy, I remember watching Warner Wolf on the local CBS affiliate and George Michael on the local NBC affiliate. "[3] Scott graduated from Northwestern University in 2004 with a degree in journalism.


Career

Scott was a stand-up comedian for a short period of time: "I tried my hand at standup comedy when I was living in Tampa, Fla. The high-water mark came in my second night on stage at the Improv in Ybor City. I won a newcomer contest, $100 for five minutes, and told my wife I thought maybe I could do that for a career. She informed me I was, in fact, incorrect."[4] Scott was hired by ESPN in June 2012. He currently anchors _SportsCenter_.


Awards

Scott earned Florida’s Associated Press and Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ, a national organization dedicated to the perpetuation of a free press) “Best Sports Feature” awards in 2008 for “Deaf Softball Star,” described by SPJ: This feature is both interesting and inspirational without being heavy-handed. Use of sign language like the pitcher and her teammates use was a good touch. He also received 2005 “Best Sports Promotion” honors from the Oklahoma Association of Broadcasters.[5]
