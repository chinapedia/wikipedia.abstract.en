_QILINYU ROSTRATA_ is a "maxillate" placoderm from the late Ludlow epoch of Qujing, Yunnan, 419 million years ago.[1]


Specimen and taxonomy

The holotype and paratype of _Q. rostrata_ are two exquisitely preserved specimens both featuring a domed cranium and a curved rostrum presenting a "dolphin-like profile."[2]

The researchers' cladistic diagram show that _Q. rostrata_ is the sister taxon of _Entelognathus_ and all other crown gnathostomes (i.e., bony and cartilaginous fishes, and their descendants).[3]


Evolutionary significance

_Q. rostrata_, together with _Entelognathus_, demonstrate additional irrefutable proof that modern gnathostomes evolved from arthrodire placoderms.[4][5]
