FEVER HIGH is a Brooklyn-based duo composed of singer/instrumentalists Anna Nordeen and Reni Lane. Their five-track debut EP, _All Work_, was re-released in 2016 by Sire Records after being released independently in 2015. The band also includes collaborator/producer Adam Schlesinger. The group will independently release their debut full-length _FHNY_ on November 10, 2017.[1]

Pop culture blog The Nerdist called their debut single, "Tantalized", "ideal dance music for the summer."[2]

Nordeen describes the band's formation came about when they "discovered we shared an affinity for pop songs, harmony vocals, chimey guitars, analog synth sounds, and spicy margaritas.”[3] The idea for the group started when Nordeen was recording vocals for demos Schlesinger was writing - "One day, he asked me to sing on a song he was working on called “Thats So Typical.” That's when we decided to start collaborating and writing and turn it into Fever High when we found Reni!"[4] On influences, she cites, "Bananarama was a big inspiration to start with because we wanted to encapsulate that girl on girl free spirit. My mix might be Scritti Politti, Blondie and Book of Love."[5]
