LOI TAI LENG (Shan: လွႆတႆးလႅင်း; ; ) is a town located in the mountainous region of southern Shan State, Myanmar (Burma). Its southern boundary is the Myanmar-Thailand border.[1]

The headquarters of the Shan State Army, which is the military wing of Restoration Council of the Shan State, are located in Loi Tai Leng,[2] and the town got its new name as Loi Tai Leng - "Loi" meaning mountain, "Tai" meaning the Tai or Shan people and "Leng" meaning Light, thereby the whole meaning of the town's name is the mountain where the Tai people see the light to fight for their freedom. To avoid confusion, residents use Thailand's time zone instead of Myanmar Standard Time (MMT) which is thirty minutes behind. Residents also prefer to use the Thai baht over the Burmese kyat.[3]
