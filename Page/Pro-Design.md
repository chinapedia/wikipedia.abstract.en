PRO-DESIGN GMBH is an Austrian aircraft manufacturer based in Innsbruck. It was founded in 1986, in Natters. The company specializes in the design and manufacture of paragliders and powered parachute canopies, in the form of ready-to-fly aircraft.[1]

The company is a Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter Haftung, an Austrian limited liability company.[2]

Reviewer Noel Bertrand described the company in a 2003 review as having a very "well-balanced range" of gliders. At that time the company's line included the two-place Carrier, beginner Effect, intermediate Jazz and Pro-Ject, plus the Titan.[3]

The company also makes heavy parafoil wings under the name _Sycon Aircraft_.[4]
