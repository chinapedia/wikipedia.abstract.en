NORMA MACMILLAN (September 15, 1921 â€“ March 16, 2001) was a Canadian actress and voice actress, best known for voicing numerous animation and claymation children's characters, including Casper the Friendly Ghost on _The New Casper Cartoon Show_, Gumby on _The Gumby Show_ and Davey on _Davey and Goliath_.


Early life

MacMillan was born on September 15, 1921, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and began her career there as a stage actress. It was in Vancouver that she met, worked with and married her producer/manager husband Thor Arngrim. In 1954, MacMillan, her husband and his business partner Stuart Baker, set out for Toronto where she began landing work voicing children's roles for CBC.[1]


Career

After she and her husband moved to New York, MacMillan lent her voice talents to numerous roles; as "Casper the Friendly Ghost" on _The New Casper Cartoon Show_, as "Gumby" on _The Gumby Show_, as "Sweet Polly Purebred" in the _Underdog_ cartoons, and as "Davey" on the claymation series _Davey and Goliath_ among others. In addition to these roles, MacMillan also voiced the roles of John-John and Caroline Kennedy in the world record setting _The First Family_ album of 1962.[2]

In addition to her voice roles, MacMillan also appeared as an on-screen actress in various television and films roles. Her on-screen work included guest-starring roles on such television shows as _Columbo_, _She's the Sheriff_, _Webster_ and _Thirtysomething_. During this time, she also appeared in feature films, including _Nightmare on the 13th Floor_, _Big Business_, _Love at Stake_, _Dangerous Intentions_, _Big Bully_, and _Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry_ with Katharine Hepburn.[3]

MacMillan appeared in numerous television commercials, but perhaps her most visible acting role was the part she played in the 1980s as the sweet, demure, naive "Aunt Martha" opposite Ruth Manning's "Aunt Harriet" for Kraft Foods mayonnaise commercials. Upon returning to Vancouver with her husband in the mid-1990s, MacMillan joined the Co-Op Radio's Sunday show for senior citizens and was a board member of the local 411 Seniors Centre.

While in Canada, MacMillan went on to voice characters in a number of later animated series and films such as _Funky Fables_, _Fat Dog Mendoza_, _Madeleine_, _Generation O!_, _Milo's Bug Quest_ and _The Animated Adventures of Tom Sawyer_.


Personal life

MacMillan was the mother of Stefan Arngrim (born December 23, 1955), who played Barry Lockridge on _Land of the Giants_, and Alison Arngrim (born January 18, 1962), who played Nellie Oleson on _Little House on the Prairie_. MacMillan and her husband Thor returned to Canada in 1993. She died in March 2001, at the age of 79[4] and Thor died in 2009 in Vancouver, British Columbia.
