SOPHIA GEORGE is a game designer, and was the first video game designer in residence at the Victoria and Albert Museum.[1]


Career

In 2011, George received a bachelor's degree in Games Art and Design from Norwich University of the Arts.[2] As a student, George worked on the game _Tick Tock Toys_, along with other students from Abertay University and Norwich University of the Arts. The game won the 2011 Dare to Be Digital contest and, in 2012, the BAFTA Ones to Watch Award. In 2013, George was named one of BAFTA's Breakthrough Brits.[3] George received a Professional Masters in Game Development from Abertay University in Dundee.[4] She went on to establish a company with her collaborators on _Tick Tock Toys_, where they developed the game into a full game, which was released in February 2013.[5][6] In its first week of release, the game garnered over 100,000 downloads.

In October 2013, George was named the first ever video game designer in residence at the Victoria and Albert Museum. She was a resident there until March 2014.[7][8] In April 2014, she returned to Scotland in order to complete her proposed game with Abertay University student collaborators. While a resident, George was tasked with creating a game that was inspired by a piece from the 1500-1900 Britain galleries.[9][10] She also had to participate in activities involving games, including workshops and ongoing displays of her work. She spent months selecting the subject for her game, and finally decided on the works of William Morris.[11] She specifically selected his 1883 Strawberry Thief pattern as her subject.[12] In 2014, she released the Strawberry Thief game free for iPad. In the game, players control a flying bird around a screen, and said bird colors the pattern.[13][14]

George currently works in Dundee with primary schools, researching creative ideas for games and introducing game design to the children.[15][16]
