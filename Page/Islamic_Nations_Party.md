ISLAMIC NATIONS PARTY or PARTY OF ISLAMIC NATIONS () was an Islamic leftist armed group with clandestine system[1] short-lived during 1960s. It was initially a secret society active against Pahlavi dynasty in late 1950s.[2] It consisted of middle-class youth, mostly highschool teachers and university students.[3]

The organization was reportedly involved in 1963 events and 1965 assassination of Hassan Ali Mansur.[4][5] However, it is alleged that opening fire on Police before arrest of leading members was its "sole standoff".[6]

After a visit to Iraq, leader Mousavi-Bojnourdi brought two firearms for the planned bank robbery and kidnapping. A rank-and-file member was arrested accidentally and led security forces to a 140-men list of the members.[7] A cache of arms belonging to the party was also discovered in the hills of north Tehran.[8]

55 members of the group were arrested in 1965[9] and received long-term confinements in 1966 by military tribunal. Four members were executed[10] and death sentence of the leader Mousavi-Bojnourdi reduced to life in prison.[11]

A number of Revolutionary Guards commanders including Javad Mansouri, Abbas Zamani and Abbas Duzduzani were members of the group.[12]
