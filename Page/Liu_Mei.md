LIU MEI ( 962 – 1021, courtesy name SHIJI), born GONG MEI, was a Song dynasty official and general. Originally a silversmith, he rose to power after his protégé (possibly even wife) Lady Liu, whom he sold in poverty, became an empress. Because Empress Liu had no non-marital relatives, she claimed him as her brother. Liu Mei rose as high as Inspector in Chief of the Metropolitan Cavalry Command, and married a granddaughter of the Wuyue king Qian Chu.
