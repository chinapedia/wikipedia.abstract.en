Career

Fosu-Mensah's youth career began with Zeeburgia, before he had spells with AFC, Argon and Almere City.[4][5][6] After leaving Almere City, he had a trial with Eerste Divisie club Oss in 2014 which led to him signing a contract with the team, originally as an amateur before signing a professional deal soon after.[7][8] He made his professional football debut on 31 January 2015 versus De Graafschap. Fosu-Mensah made six more appearances in the league for Oss before departing.[9] Upon leaving Oss, he also left Dutch football and moved to the UK to join his brother Timothy and agreed to sign for English National League side Southport.[10]

After only a few months with Southport, he left to join Northern Premier League Premier Division team Colwyn Bay but his spell with them lasted just months again.[11][12] Further spells with Ashton United, Skelmersdale United and North Ferriby United then followed.[13] On 1 February 2017, Fosu-Mensah joined Northern Premier League Premier Division side Hednesford Town.[14] His debut came on 5 February in a 1–1 draw against Barwell.[15] After three appearances for Hednesford, Fosu-Mensah departed to join fellow NPL Premier Division team Marine on 3 March.[16][17] He scored twice in nine matches for Marine.[18]

In August 2017, Fosu-Mensah joined Welsh Cymru Alliance club Airbus UK Broughton.[19] He made his debut on 22 August, coming on as a substitute against Gresford Athletic.[20][21] On the following Saturday, Fosu-Mensah scored a hat-trick in his first start for Airbus UK versus Holywell Town in a 2–5 win.[22] During a run of ten goals in his first eight matches for Airbus UK, he signed a new contract with the club on 21 September.[23] He departed on 30 May 2018, after twenty goals in thirty-one fixtures in all competitions for Airbus UK.[24] In August 2018, Fosu-Mensah signed with Welsh Premier League side Llandudno.[25]

Weeks after signing for Llandudno, Fosu-Mensah was loaned out to Denbigh Town of the Cymru Alliance, before returning to his parent club in September, having scored three goals in all appearances whilst at Denbigh.[26] He was released by Llandudno in November, which preceded him signing for NPL Division One West club Widnes in December.[27][28]


Personal life

He is the brother of fellow footballer Timothy Fosu-Mensah.[29]
