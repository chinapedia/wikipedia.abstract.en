Houghton_TCS_44_-_James_Hewlett_as_Richard_the_Third_-_cropped.jpg in a c. 1821 production.]] JAMES HEWLETT (fl. 1821-1839) was an African-American actor. He was principal actor in and co-creator of William Alexander Brown's African Grove theatre in New York City.[1][2][3][4]

Hewlett started performing as a vocalist and as an actor described as "Shakespeare's proud Representative" in African Grove when it was just an exhibition held in Brown's tea garden.[5] He is most known for starring in African Grove's performance of _Richard III_.[6] After the closure of the theatre, he began to tour performing excerpts from plays; historian Shane White suggests that he may have been "the best-known black New Yorker" around 1831.[7] He also visited the United Kingdom and apparently performed in Liverpool, although documentary evidence of this is limited.[8] His career seems to have entered into a decline by and after 1834, when he was imprisoned for larceny. He is reported to have died around 1849.[9]

George Thompson, who has researched the history of the theatre, concluded that Hewlett was a tailor and may have been an emigrant from the West Indies.[10]
