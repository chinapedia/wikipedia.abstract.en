JAMES HAMILTON, 1ST EARL OF ABERCORN PC (1575 – 23 March 1618) was a Scottish peer and diplomat for James VI and I. He also was an important undertaker in the Plantations of Ireland of that king.


Birth and origins

He was born on 12 August 1575, probably at Paisley (west of Glasgow, Scotland), as the eldest son of Claud Hamilton and his wife Margaret Seton. His father was the first Lord Paisley. His paternal grandfather was James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran. His mother was a daughter of George Seton, 7th Lord Seton. Several of their children died in their infancy or childhood.. The following survived to adulthood:

1.  James (1575–1618), our subject here;
2.  John (?), who would marry Johanna, daughter of Levimus Everard;
3.  Claud (d. 1614) of Shawfield, who was appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland;
4.  George (d. bef. 1657) of Greenlaw and Roscrea, who was an undertaker in the Plantation of Ulster;
5.  Frederick Hamilton (soldier) (1590–1647), who built Manorhamilton Castle and fought for Sweden in the Thirty Years' War in Germany;
6.  Margaret (d. 1623), who married William Douglas, 1st Marquess of Douglas.


Career

In 1597, he sat for Linlithgow in the Parliament of Scotland. He was also made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber and a member of the Privy Council to James VI of Scotland. In 1600, the King created him hereditary Sheriff of Linlithgow. On 24 March 1603 James VI also became king of England, as James I, and from there on reigned both kingdoms in personal union.

On 5 April 1603, James Hamilton was created Lord Abercorn, of Linlithgowshire. This made him the first of the long line of earls, then marquesses, and finally even dukes of Abercorn.

In 1604, he served on a royal commission established to consider the union of the crowns of England and Scotland. Although the project failed, the king was content with his services. He received large grants of lands in Scotland.

This family tree is partly derived from the pedigree pictured in Cokayne.

On 10 April 1606 he was further honoured by being created Earl of Abercorn and Lord Paisley, Hamilton, Mountcastell and Kilpatrick. On the family tree we can see how the title was inherited moving at the death of the 3rd Earl to the eldest descendant of the 2nd son, Claud, and then at the death of the 5th Earl to the eldest descendants of his 4th son, George.


Ireland

He and his brothers Claud and George were undertakers in James VI and I's 1611 Plantations of Ireland. He was given pieces of land called Strabane, Donnalonge and Shean in County Tyrone. He built a castle at Strabane.{sfn|Paul|1904|p=46|ps=: "At Strabane he built a very strong and fair castle, ..."}} His brother Claude had land in County Cavan. His brother George would found the village of Ballymagorry, north of Strabane, where the townland of Greenlaw is.

On 11 March 1613/4, he was summoned to attend the Parliament of Ireland and was granted the precedence of an earl in Ireland (confirmed by royal warrant on 31 March), although he had never been created a peer in that realm. He was appointed to the Council of Munster on 20 May 1615.


Marriage and children

He married Marion, daughter of Thomas Boyd, 6th Lord Boyd. She was a prominent Roman Catholic and would be excommunicated by the Church of Scotland in the Paisley Abbey Church in 1628 after his death. They had nine children, five boys and four girls:

1.  Anne (1592–1620), who would marry Hugh Sempill, 5th Lord Sempill in 1611;
2.  Isobel (1600 – 27 Nov. 1620);
3.  James (d. c. 1670), who would become the 2nd Earl of Abercorn;
4.  Claud (d. 1638), who would establish himself in Ireland;
5.  William (d. 1681), who would become Baronet Hamilton of Westport and represent Henrietta Maria, Charles I's widow, at the pope;
6.  George (c. 1607 – 1679), who would become Baronet Hamilton of Donalong;
7.  Lucy (b. bef. 1618), for whom a marriage was arranged with Randal MacDonnell, 1st Marquess of Antrim, but the wedding never took place;
8.  Alexander (d. bef. 4 May 1669), who would become the founder of the German branch of the family; and
9.  Margaret (d. 1642), who would marry Sir William Cuninghame of Caprington.


Death

He died on 23 March 1618, at the age of 42 years, at Monkton, and was buried on 29 April 1618 in the church of Paisley Abbey. He predeceased his father by three years and therefore never became Lord Paisley, but being Earl of Abercorn he obviously did not need this title. His widow died in 1632.
