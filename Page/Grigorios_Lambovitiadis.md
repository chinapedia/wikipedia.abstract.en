GRIGORIOS LAMBOVITIADIS (, 1908-1945) was a Greek patriot, representative of the Greek community in southern Albania and activist of the Northern Epirus movement. He was executed by the authorities of the People's Republic of Albania as "enemy of the state".


Life

Lambovitiadis was born to a Greek family in the village of Dhuvjan, Ottoman Empire, today in southern Albania (known Northern Epirus among Greeks). After finishing ground level studies at his home village he moved to Corfu, Greece. Latter he attended the dentist school of the University of Athens, where he graduated at 1935. [1]

At 1940, during World War II, Lambovitiadis was organizing Greek resistance groups in his home region Gjirokaster and in nearby Delvine. After the withdrawal of the Axis forces, the region came under the control of the People's Republic of Albania. Lambovitiadis campaigned against post-war incorporation of Northern Epirus to Albania and protested against machinations of the agents of the Albanian communist party.[2] The later attempted to organize elections in order to declare an one-party state in Albania. As a result, Lambovitiadis together with other Greek activists were considered "enemy of the state" and arrested. After being tortured in jail a show trial followed which summarily sentenced him to death.[3][4]
