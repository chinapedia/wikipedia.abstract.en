This is a LIST OF THE BIRD SPECIES RECORDED IN CURAÇAO. The avifauna of Curaçao has 217 confirmed species, of which 13 have been introduced by humans and 75 are rare or vagrants. An additional four species are hypothetical (see below). None are endemic.

Except as an entry is cited otherwise, the list of species is that of the South American Classification Committee (SACC) of the American Ornithological Society.[1] The list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families, and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) are also those of the SACC.[2]

The following tags have been used to highlight certain categories of occurrence.

-   (V) VAGRANT - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Curaçao
-   (I) INTRODUCED - a species introduced to Curaçao as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions
-   (H) HYPOTHETICAL - a species recorded but with "no tangible evidence" according to the SACC
