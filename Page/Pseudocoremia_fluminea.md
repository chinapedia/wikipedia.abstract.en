_PSEUDOCOREMIA FLUMINEA_ is a species of moth in the family Geometridae. It is endemic to New Zealand. It is classified as Not Threatened by the Department of Conservation.


Taxonomy

This species was first described by Alfred Philpott in 1926 and named _Selidosema fluminea_.[1] Philpott and Stewart Lindsay discovered this species at Flora River on the track to Mount Arthur tableland at an altitude of approximately 1000m.[2][3] In 1928, in his book _The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand_, George Hudson discussed the species as a synonym of _Selidosema productata_.[4] Later in 1928 Philpott stated that the moth he described in 1926 was a separate species explaining that although both _productata_ and _fluminea_ were variable, _fluminea_ could be distinguished from the former species by its shorter antennal pectinations and the difference in the male genitalia.[5] Hudson accepted this and discussed and illustrated the species under the name _S. fluminea_ in his 1939 publication _A supplement to the butterflies and moths of New Zealand._[6] In 1988 John S. Dugdale assigned the species to the genus _Pseudocoremia_.[7] The hototype specimen is held at the New Zealand Arthropod Collection.[8]
