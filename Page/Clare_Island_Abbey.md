CLARE ISLAND ABBEY, officially ST. BRIGID'S ABBEY, is a former Cistercian monastery and National Monument located in Clare Island, Ireland.[1][2]


Location

Clare Island Abbey is located in the centre of the south part of Clare Island, near the post office.[3]


History

Saint Bridget`s Abbey was founded in the 12th/13th century and in 1224 became a cell of Knockmoy Abbey, a Cistercian abbey near Tuam.

It was rebuilt c. 1460. It contains numerous tombs of the local ruling family, the Ó Máille (O'Malley) and tradition claims it as the site of the baptism, marriages and burial of Gráinne "Grace" O'Malley (c. 1530 – c. 1603), the famous "pirate queen." She is believed to have been interred at the O'Malley tomb which has a canopy.

The abbey was probably dissolved during the late 16th century. Later it was a place of refuge for Carmelite Friars.


Building

The abbey is furnished with piscina, sedilia, carved heads and ogee and cusp-headed lancet windows.[4] [5]

Clare Island Abbey contains a series of medieval wall and ceiling paintings. They depict mythical, human and animal figures including dragons, a cockerel, stags, men on foot and on horseback, a harper, birds and trees. Such ornamentation is unusual for a Cistercian foundation.[6]
