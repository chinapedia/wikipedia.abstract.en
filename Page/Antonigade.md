History

Antonigade_1900.png The street was in the Middle Ages known as Lille Pilestræde (Little Pilestræde). Its name was later changed to Antonistræde after the Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony in Præstø who until the Reformation owned a building approximately where Silkegade 6Mbsash&8 is today. The street was renamed Antonigade in connection with an extension in 1901.[1][2]

The building at No. 11. with rustication on its ground floor, is a former police station. It was built in 1902 to design by city architect Hans Wright (1854–1925). The police station was decommissioned in 1990-1991 and the building has later been converted into offices.
