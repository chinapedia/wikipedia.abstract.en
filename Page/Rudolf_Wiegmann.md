He worked in the Classical style and, as a painter, is best known for his vedute. His wife, , whom he married in 1841, was also a painter of some note.


Biography

He came from a military family. His father was a Lieutenant (later Captain) in the Tenth Infantry Regiment and was killed at the Battle of Waterloo, where he was serving as an adjutant to Colonel .[1] Marktplatz_Hannover._Farbige_Lithographie_von_Rudolph_Wiegmann_1834.jpg As a child, he often visited St.Dionysius Church in Nordstemmen and its Gothic architecture left a deep impression on him. He began by studying architecture, mathematics and astronomy at the "Ratsgymnasium" in Hanover, where his family had relocated after his father's death. One of his childhood friends was , who would later become the City Architect for Hanover. After 1823, he and Andreae attended the University of Göttingen, where he studied history, the natural sciences and archaeology and was especially impressed by the lectures of Karl Otfried Müller.

He began his art studies in Darmstadt with the City Architect, Georg Moller,[2] who encouraged him to supplement his class work through practical research in Rome. Accordingly, in 1828, he went to work for the German Archaeological Institute, investigating the wall paintings at Pompeii. He remained there until 1832 and became part of the German art colony.

After his return, he devoted himself to creating vedute of Hanover; oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs and etchings, which he published as an album in 1835. During this time, his only architectural work involved a tomb vault for Johann Ludwig Söhlmann (1797–1834), a leather manufacturer.[3] He also became a member of the "" (Art Association) and served on the committee that chose works for their exhibitions.

His career in Düsseldorf

He was, however, unsatisfied with his career in Hanover and moved to Düsseldorf in 1836. There he published a book based on his work in Pompeii: _The Painting of the Ancients in Application and Technique_. This resulted in a dispute with the architect, Leo von Klenze, who questioned Wiegmann's conclusions.[4] Wiegmann replied in 1839 with _Sir Leo von Klenze and Our Art_. Flur_im_Schadowhaus_by_Rudolf_Wiegmann_1836.jpg After 1836, he taught at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. He was named a Professor of Architecture and Perspective in 1839; a position he held until his death.[5] From 1846, he was also head of the Academic Secretariat, under Director Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, and was responsible for correspondence, matriculations and programs. During these years, he became an advocate of Rundbogenstil, a type of Romanesque Revival architecture and designed a home for Schadow on what is now Schadowstraße.[6]

In 1839, he designed a new system for roof joints that he described in a book called _The Construction of Chain Bridges According to the Triangle System and Their Application to Roof Joints_. However, a virtually identical system was invented at about the same time by the French engineer Camille Polonceau, who used it to build stations for the Paris-Versailles railway, so it has come to be known as a "Polonceau Roof".[7]

He was a member of the "", serving on its administrative council. After 1844, he edited its official publication, the _Correspondenzblatt_. In 1857, he was named a corresponding member of the Royal Institute of British Architects. During his later years, he suffered from a chest ailment (possibly tuberculosis) and resigned his positions at the Kunstverein shortly before his death.[8]

His son, Arnold, was killed at the Battle of Spicheren in 1870. Two years later, his personal papers were destroyed in a fire at the Kunstverein.
