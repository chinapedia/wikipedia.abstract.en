The Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium, abbreviately known as the ZAC Stadium is located in Chittagong, is a sports ground in Bangladesh that has hosted international cricket matches along with provincial games.[1] The venue is the home of both the men's and women's national teams and domestically Chittagong Vikings. It has a capacity of 22,000 spectators for international matches.[2]

In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a "five-for" or "fifer")[3][4] refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement.[5]

The best figures in Test cricket at this venue are 7 wickets for 36 runs, taken by Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan against New Zealand in 2008. He is also the best Test bowler to take four fifers at ZAC Stadium. As of October 2016, there have been 16 Test match five-wicket hauls at this ground.[6]
