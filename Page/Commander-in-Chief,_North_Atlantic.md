The COMMANDER IN CHIEF, NORTH ATLANTIC was an operational commander of the Royal Navy.[1] His subordinate units, establishments, and staff were sometimes informally known as the FLAG OFFICER GIBRALTAR AND NORTH ATLANTIC they were charged with the administration of the RN Naval Base, Gibraltar and North Atlantic geographic area.[2]


History

At the outbreak of the Second World War the Gibraltar command was elevated to North Atlantic Command with responsibility for the sea lanes on either side of the Straits of Gibraltar. Those duties remained in place although the flag officers' mission was often unclear due to the operations of both Force H and Western Approaches Command. It was these ambiguous boundaries of command responsibility between Gibraltar and Force H that led to confusion when conducting naval operations in the stated area.[3] In the book The Royal Navy and the Mediterranean, the author David Brown discusses this problem and the Admiralty's response: _The division of responsibility between the Flag Officer North Atlantic Command (FOCNA) and the Flag Officer Force H and the Commander in Chief Mediterranean was defined as follows:[4]_

_F.O.C.N.A was responsible for preventing the passage of Gibraltar Straight by all enemy vessels and by vessels of other nations as maybe ordered by the Admiralty from time to time_.[5]
_While Force H was based on Gibraltar, F.O.C.N.A was to call on, Flag Officer, Force H for such assistance as be necessary. Except when directed to carry out specific tasks by the Admiralty_.[6]

On 1 January 1941, the Admiralty acted and decided that the command's primary function was to house and then protect convoy escorts; from that point on it became a component area command of the allied naval forces Mediterranean.
