The WARSAW–GDAŃSK RAILWAY is a Polish 323-kilometre long railway line, that connects Warsaw with Iława, Malbork, Tczew, Gdańsk and further along the coast to Gdynia.


Opening

The line was opened in stages between 1852 and 1877. Today's Line 9 was created separately in the Russian zone and German zone. It was built as part of the Prussian Eastern Railway linking Berlin with Königsberg (today's Kaliningrad).

Before modernisation speed on the line was between 80 and 120 km/h. The cost of modernisation cost about PLN 10 billion,[3][4] which gives an approximate cost of PLN 31 million per kilometer of the route.
