HUEY, DEWEY, and LOUIE DUCK are triplet cartoon characters created in 1937 by writer Ted Osborne and cartoonist Al Taliaferro, and are owned by The Walt Disney Company. Huey, Dewey, and Louie are the nephews of Donald Duck and the great nephews of Scrooge McDuck. Like their uncles, the boys are anthropomorphic white ducks with yellow-orange bills and feet. They typically wear shirts and colorful baseball caps, which are sometimes used to differentiate each character. Huey, Dewey and Louie have made several animated appearances in both films and television, but comics remain their primary medium. The trio are collectively the 11th most published comic book characters in the world, and outside of the superhero genre, second only to Donald.[1]

While the boys were originally created as mischief-makers to provoke Donald's famous temper, later appearances showed them to be valuable assets to him and Scrooge on their adventures. All three of the boys are members of the fictional scouting organization the Junior Woodchucks.


Origins

HDL_debut_1937.jpg]]

Huey, Dewey, and Louie were the idea of Al Taliaferro, the artist for the _Silly Symphonies_ comic strip, which featured Donald Duck. The Walt Disney Productions Story Dept. on February 5, 1937, sent Taliaferro a memo recognizing him as the source of the idea for the planned short, _Donald's Nephews_. The nephews debuted in Taliaferro's comic strip, which by this time had been renamed _Donald Duck_, on Sunday, October 17, 1937, beating the theatrical release of _Donald's Nephews_ by almost six months. The names were devised by Disney gag man Dana Coty, who took them from Huey Long, Thomas Dewey, and Louis Schmitt, an animator at the Disney Studio in the 1930s and 1940s. Taliaferro's introduction of the nephews emulated the three nephews in the Happy Hooligan comic strip and was also influenced by Mickey Mouse's nephews, Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse.[2]

In translations of Disney works the nephews have different local-sounding names that often follow the repetition (parachesis) of the English names. Examples include Hugo, Paco and Luis (American Spanish); Jorgito, Juanito and Jaimito (European Spanish); and Tick, Trick and Track (German).

Character background

    _Further information: Duck family (Disney) ยง Della Duck and ยง Huey, Dewey, and Louie's father_

Huey, Dewey, and Louie are the sons of Donald's sister Della Duck; in _Donald's Nephews_, their mother is instead named Dumbella. In the original theatrical shorts, they were originally sent to visit Donald for only one day; in the comics, the three were sent to stay with Donald on a temporary basis, until their father came back from the hospital (the boys ended up sending him there after a practical joke of putting firecrackers under his chair). In both the comics and animated shorts, the boys' parents were never heard from or mentioned again after these instances, with the boys ending up permanently living with Donald. All four of them live in the fictional city of Duckburg, in the fictional state of Calisota.

The three ducklings are noted for their identical appearances and personalities. A running joke involves the three sometimes even finishing each other's sentences. In the theatrical shorts, Huey, Dewey, and Louie often behave in a rambunctious and mischievous manner, and they sometimes commit retaliation or revenge on their uncle Donald Duck. In the comics, however, as developed by Al Taliaferro and Carl Barks, the young ducks are more usually portrayed as well-behaved, preferring to assist their uncle Donald Duck and great-uncle Scrooge McDuck in the adventure at hand. In the early Barks comics, the ducklings were still wild and unruly, but their character improved considerably due to their membership in the Junior Woodchucks and the good influence of their wise old great-grandmother Elvira Coot "Grandma" Duck. According to Don Rosa, Huey, Dewey and Louie became members of the Junior Woodchucks when they were around 11 years old.[3]

Colors of Huey, Dewey, and Louie's outfits

Return_to_Plain_Awful_-_Huey_Dewey_and_Louie.jpg: Scrooge with Huey, Dewey, and Louie in "Return to Plain Awful" (1989) by Don Rosa]]

In early comic books and shorts, the caps of Huey, Dewey, and Louie were colored randomly, depending on the whim of the colorist.

On few occasions until 1945 and most every cartoon short afterward, all three nephews wore identical outfits (most commonly red). It wasn't until the 1980s when it became established that Huey is dressed in red, Dewey in blue, and Louie in green. Disney's archivist Dave Smith, in "Disney A to Z", said, "Note that the brightest hue of the three is red (Huey), the color of water, dew, is blue (Dewey), and that leaves Louie, and leaves are green." A few random combinations appear in early Disney merchandise and books, such as orange and yellow. Another combination that shows up from time to time is Huey in blue, Dewey in green, and Louie in red. In-story, this inconsistency is explained away as a result of the ducklings borrowing each other's clothes.

In Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge comics the trio have occasionally been known to dress in their usual outfits, but rather than have their usual colors they all wear black (or the same dark color), rendering them visually identical, leaving their hat color available if they care to be distinguished.

The Don Rosa story _An Eye for Detail_ in Donald Duck comics was based around Donald spending so much time trying to tell his three nephews apart that he developed a heightened sense of sight.

Voices

Clarence Nash, Donald's voice actor, gave the voices to the boys in the cartoon shorts, making them just as unintelligible as Donald's. Huey, Dewey, and Louie were all voiced by Russi Taylor in _DuckTales_. In _Quack Pack_, they were voiced by Jeannie Elias, Pamela Segall, and Elizabeth Daily, respectively. Tony Anselmo voiced the characters in _Down and Out with Donald Duck_ (1987), _Mickey Mouse Works_ and _Disney's House of Mouse_, but Russi Taylor still voices the trio in other projects, such as the video games _Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers_ and _Mickey's Speedway USA_, and the direct-to-video films _Mickey's Once_ and _Twice Upon a Christmas_. Russi Taylor also reprised her role as the nephews in the _DuckTales: Remastered_ video game and the post-2013 _Mickey Mouse_ shorts. Danny Pudi, Ben Schwartz and Bobby Moynihan voice the brothers in the 2017 reboot.

Phooey Duck

Phooey_Duck1.gif On a few occasions, an artist by error drew four nephews and the error was not noticed but was published. This fourth nephew has been named PHOOEY DUCK by Disney comic editor Bob Foster.[4][5]

One short Egmont-licensed Disney comic (called _Much Ado About Phooey_ in the English-language version) used Phooey as a character and explained Phooey's sporadic appearances as a freak incident of nature. (The Swedish text in the two speech balloons says "It is a fourth nephew! An exact copy of the others! / Yes, it's probably best that I explain".)[6]

Comics

Within the comics, Huey, Dewey, and Louie often play a major role in most stories involving either their uncle Donald or great-uncle Scrooge McDuck, accompanying them on most of their adventures. Also seen in the comics is the boys' membership in the Boy Scouts of America-like organization, the Junior Woodchucks, including their use of the Junior Woodchucks Guidebook, a manual containing all manner of information on virtually every subject possible (however, there are some resources, such as the ancient libraries of Tralla La, that hold information not found in the guidebook). This excellent youth organization, which has twin goals of preserving knowledge and preserving the environment, was instrumental in transforming the three brothers from little hellions to upstanding young ducks.

In Disney comic writer Don Rosa's (unofficial) continuity, Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck were born around 1940 in Duckburg. True to his jocular style, Rosa occasionally makes subtle references to the untold mystery of the three boys' life: What became of their parents? In his epic comic series, _Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck_, Rosa pictures how Scrooge first met Donald and his nephews, saying: "I'm not used to relatives, either! The few I had seem to have... disappeared!" Huey, Dewey, and Louie answer: "We know how _that_ feels, Unca Scrooge!"

In _Some Heir Over the Rainbow_ by Carl Barks, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, along with Donald Duck and Gladstone Gander, are tested by Scrooge McDuck, who wants to pick an heir to his fortune. Using the legend of a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow, Scrooge secretly gives US$ 3,000 (One thousand to Huey, Dewey, and Louie, another for Gladstone, and the last one for Donald). Donald uses his money for a down payment of a new car, now being $1,000 in debt. Gladstone, considering himself too lucky to need the money this soon, hides the money for when and if he needs it, causing Scrooge to consider him a better option than Donald. Huey, Dewey, and Louie lend their money to a man who claims to need the money to search for a treasure. Initially thinking they were tricked out of the money, Scrooge actually considers leaving his fortune to Gladstone, even though he sees that as _"an awful injustice to the world"_, but the man actually finds the treasure and pays the kids back. Scrooge makes Huey, Dewey, and Louie his heirs. Although this is disregarded in a number of later comics, it seems to be the most solidly canon indication of Scrooge's plans.

Television

_DuckTales_

Huey,_Dewey_and_Louie_in_the_2017_reboot.png They later starred in the 1987 animated television series _DuckTales_, in which they appeared in adventures with their great-uncle, Scrooge McDuck (Donald having enlisted in the U.S. Navy). The boys' personalities in this series were mainly based on their comic book appearances versus the theatrical shorts.

A new adaptation of the series once again titled, _DuckTales_ features the three brothers as well, albeit with distinct designs, voices, and personalities like in _Quack Pack_, who move to Scrooge's house with Donald after the boat where they lived is destroyed by accident. In the new installment, the brothers also travel in adventures with Scrooge, now with Donald in tow. The first episode also shows an image of Della, the triplets' mother, who also traveled the world in adventures with Donald and Scrooge. This iteration also changed Dewey's real name to DEWFORD, while making DEUTERONOMY his middle name, and Louie's real name to LLWELLYN, a fact which he seems to be embarrassed by.

_Quack Pack_

QuackPack.jpg''.]] Huey, Dewey, and Louie also starred in the 1990s series _Quack Pack_, in which the three were portrayed as teenagers. In _Quack Pack_, the boys were given distinct personalities, with Huey serving as the group's leader, Dewey as a computer whiz, and Louie as enjoying sports. After _Quack Pack_, the boys were reverted to their original ages in future appearances, including 2000s series _Mickey Mouse Works_, and then re-aged in _House of Mouse_. On _House of Mouse_, they served as the house band in a variety of different styles (most commonly as 'The Quackstreet Boys'). They also feature prominently, in a segment of the computer-animated film, _Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas_ from 2004.

Video games

Huey, Dewey, and Louie appear in the third _Magical Quest_ game. The object of the game is to rescue them from the clutches of the villainous King Pete. The trio also appear in _Quackshot_ piloting Donald's plane as he travels the world in search of a lost treasure.

They also appear in _The Lucky Dime Caper_ for the Sega Master system, where they are kidnapped by Magica De Spell. Donald must find Scrooge's lucky dime and barter for their safety.

They also appear in _Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers_, aiding Donald to rescue Daisy and beat Gladstone to her, while he rescues their hexed play toys.

They even appear in _Mickey's Speedway USA_ as unlockable lightweight characters.

They also appear in _DuckTales_, aiding their Uncle Scrooge in finding treasure.

They also appear on _Dance Dance Revolution: Disney Mix_, where they appear as DJ's on certain music tracks

_Kingdom Hearts_

In _Kingdom Hearts_ they work in the item shop in the First District of Traverse Town. In _Kingdom Hearts II_, they individually run an item shop (Huey), a weapon shop (Louie), and an accessory shop (Dewey) in Hollow Bastion/Radiant Garden. In both endings, they are all seen going back to Disney Castle. They reappear in _Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep_ in Disney Town, recreating Ice Cream flavors, this time with a speaking role. They appear once more in the mobile game _Kingdom Hearts Unchained_ as special Support medals that grant the player's other medals a set amount of experience points based on the medal's star value. They appear in the Tram Common area of Twilight Town in Kingdom Hearts III, where they each take turns running the gummi shop. In all of their Kingdom Hearts appearances, they appear similar to their appearance in the original DuckTales.
