This is a LIST OF THE BIRD SPECIES RECORDED IN THE FALKLAND ISLANDS. The avifauna of the Falkland Islands include a total of 227 confirmed species, of which two are endemic, two have been introduced by humans, four have been extirpated, and 140 are rare or vagrants. Three additional species are hypothetical (see below).

The entries on this list and the list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families, and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) are those of the South American Classification Committee (SACC) of the American Ornithological Society.[1][2]

The following tags have been used to highlight several categories of occurrence in addition to non-endemic resident species and regular visitors.

-   (V) VAGRANT - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in the Falklands
-   (E) ENDEMIC - a species endemic to the Falklands
-   (I) INTRODUCED - a species introduced to the Falklands as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions
-   (Ex) EXTIRPATED - a species which formerly occurred in the Falklands
-   (H) HYPOTHETICAL - a species recorded in the Falklands but with "no tangible evidence" according to the SACC
