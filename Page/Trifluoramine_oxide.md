TRIFLUORAMINE OXIDE or NITROGEN OXIDE TRIFLUORIDE (F₃NO) is an inorganic molecule with strong fluoronating powers.


Production

Trifluoramine oxide was first discovered in 1966 independently by two different groups. One way to produce it was by an electric discharge in a mixture of oxygen on nitrogen trifluoride. Another even less yielding method is by reacting noble metal fluorides (IrF₆ or PtF₆) with nitric oxide.[1] It is separated by distillation, and can be purified by treating it with potassium hydroxide solution which reacts with the other fluorine containing molecules produced.[2]

An alternate way to produce it is by burning nitric acid in fluorine, followed by rapid cooling.[3] Yet another way is the photochemical reaction of fluorine and nitrosyl fluoride: F₂ + FNO → F₃NO. This reaction can also happen with heat, but hot fluorine is hard to contain without a reaction with the container.[4] yet another production route is to thermally decompose nitrosyl hexafluoronickelate (NO)₂NiF₆ + ONF + ONF₃.[5]


Properties

F₃NO is a colourless gas at standard conditions. It has a critical temperature of 29.5° C where the density is 0.593 g/cm³. Critical pressure is about 64 atmospheres.[6]

Trifluoramine oxide has a Trouton's constant of 20.7.[7] Heat of vapourisation at the boiling point is 3.85 kcal/mol.[8]

The F₃NO molecule has C_(3V) symmetry, with all the N-F bonds being equivalent. The shape is almost a tetrahedron as N-O bond is similar to the N-F bonds in nature.[9] The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of ¹⁹F has a triplet line around −363 ppm. J_(NF) is 136 Hz.[10] The infra red spectrum N-O stretch at 1687 cm^(−1), N-F stretch at 743 cm^(−1), unsymmetrical N-F stretch 887 cm^(−1) ∠ONF bend 528 cm^(−1), wither other bands at 558, 528, 801, 929, 1055, 1410, 1622, 1772, 2435, and 3345 cm^(−1).[11] The dipole moment is 0.0390 D.[12]

The N-O bond has 75% double bond character. This differs from the amine oxides where the amine is much more basic and with a positive charge.[13] The N-O bond-length is 1.158 Å; the N–F bond-length is  1.431 Å ; the bond angles ∠FNF  is  101°; and the three bond angles ∠ONF = 117.[14]

Trifluoramine oxide is toxic, killing rats at a concentration between 200 and 500 ppm.[15]


Reactions

On fluorinating other compounds nitrosyl fluoride (NOF) is formed.[16] Trifluoramine oxide does not react with water, glass or nickel, making it easier to handle.[17] The "adducts" formed with the pentafluorides, are actually hexafluoride salts containing the F₂NO⁺ ion.[18]

Trifluoramine oxide reacts slowly with mercury, producing mercury fluorides, and nitrogen oxides.[20] Trifluoramine oxide is fairly stable when heated to 300°C but slowly breaks up to fluorine and NO₂F, NOF, NO₂ and NO. The oxygen remains attached to the nitrogen during decomposition.[21]
