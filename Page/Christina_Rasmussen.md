CHRISTINA RASMUSSEN is a Greek–American crisis intervention counselor and author. She is best known for writing Second Firsts, a 2013 book introducing a new model of grief based on the science of neuroplasticity, as well as creating a grief counseling organization of the same name.


Background

In September 1998, Rasmussen delivered her Master's thesis on the stages of grief at the University of Durham in England.[1]

In 2003, Rasmussen's husband of 10 years, Bjarne Rasmussen, was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer.[2] On July 21, 2006, he died in the intensive care unit of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute at the age of thirty-five.[3]

While grieving, Rasmussen continued working to support her two children.[4] She obtained a graduate certificate in human resource management from Northeastern University, and joined the human resource department at PAREXEL, a multinational life sciences consulting firm.[5]


Second Firsts

In April 2010, Rasmussen created the _Life Reentry Model_, a model of grieving based on her professional, academic, and personal observations of the bereavement process.[6] This model is the foundation of her 2013 book, _Second Firsts_, as well as her grief counseling organization of the same name.[7]

Rasmussen's model of grief operates on the assumption of psychological resilience, echoing the theories introduced by George Bonanno, a professor of clinical psychology at the Teachers College of Columbia University. Her theories conflict with popularized concepts of grief stemming from the 1917 and 1969 publications of _Mourning and Melancholia_ and _On Death and Dying_ by Sigmund Freud and Elizabeth Kübler-Ross, respectively.[8][9] The defining characteristic of the model proposed by _Second Firsts_ is the view of loss as a catalyst for change and self-growth.[10]


Reception and Influence

In December 2012, Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington invited Rasmussen to write an article for the website. The article, titled _7 Unexpected Steps to Starting Over During the Holidays_, appeared on the "Most Popular" list within 24 hours of its publication.[11]

For her work on _Second Firsts_, Rasmussen has been featured on the blog of The White House, as well as Hello Giggles, a lifestyle website created by actress Zooey Deschanel.[12][13]
