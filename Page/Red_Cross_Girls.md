Reception

The film critic Lorenzo Hortelano considered _Red Cross Girls_ one of the best examples of the "well-meaning, humorous and nostalgic popular"[2] Spanish cinema of the 1950s and 1960s, following a romantic narrative set against a background that "praises "the joy of the 'modern' Madrid of the fifties."[3]

In the 1980s some Spanish critics dismissed this film's genre as “silly comedies” that presented a false view of Spanish life.[4]


Soundtrack

The main theme, composed by Augusto Algueró became a popular hit in Spain.[5]
