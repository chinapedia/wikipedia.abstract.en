The SID WATSON AWARD is an annual award given to the top player in NCAA Division III Men's Ice Hockey. It is given by the American Hockey Coaches Association. It was known as the Division III Men's Player of the Year Award prior to 2005.

In 2004, the AHCA voted to rename the Division III Men's Player of the Year after Sid Watson.[1] The award is named for longtime Bowdoin College hockey coach and athletic director Sid Watson, who died in April 2004 at age 71. Watson played four seasons in the NFL before starting to coach hockey at Bowdoin in 1958.
