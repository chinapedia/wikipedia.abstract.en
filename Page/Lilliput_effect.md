The LILLIPUT EFFECT is a decrease in body size in animal species which have survived a major extinction.[1] There are several hypotheses as to why these patterns appear in the fossil record, some of which are: the survival of small taxa, dwarfing of larger lineages, and the evolutionary miniaturization from larger ancestral stocks.[2] The term was coined in 1993 by Adam Urbanek in his paper concerning the extinction of graptoloids.[3] This size decrease may just be a temporary phenomenon restricted to the survival period of the extinction event.


Significance

Trends in body size changes are seen throughout the fossil record in many organisms, and major changes (shrinking and dwarfing) in body size can significantly affect the morphology of the animal itself as well as how it interacts with the environment.[4] Since Urbanek's publication several researchers have described a decrease in body size in fauna post-extinction event, although not all use the term "Lilliput effect" when discussing this trend in body size decrease.[5][6][7]

The Lilliput effect has been noted by several authors to have occurred after the Permian-Triassic mass extinction event. Early Triassic fauna, both marine and terrestrial, is notably smaller than those preceding and following in the geologic record.[8]


Potential Causes of Smaller Body Sizes

Extinction of Larger Taxa

The extinction event may affect the larger-bodied organisms more severely, leaving smaller bodies taxa behind.[9] As such, the smaller organisms which now make up the population will take time to grow into larger body sizes.[10] These larger animals may be evolutionarily selected against for several reasons, including high energy requirements for which the resources may not longer be available, increased generation times compared to smaller bodied organisms, and smaller population sizes which would be more severely affected by environmental changes.[11]

Development of New Organisms

New animal taxa tend to originally develop at a small size, as hypothesized by S.M. Stanley.[12]

Shrinking of Surviving Taxa
