ADAM CAROLLA (; born May 27, 1964)[1] is an American comedian, radio personality, television host, actor, podcaster, and director. He hosts _The Adam Carolla Show_, a talk show distributed as a podcast which set the record as the "most downloaded podcast" as judged by Guinness World Records in 2011.[2]

Carolla co-hosted the syndicated radio call-in program _Loveline_ from 1995 to 2005 as well as the show's television incarnation on MTV from 1996 to 2000. He was the co-host and co-creator of the television program _The Man Show_ (1999–2004), and the co-creator and a regular performer on the television show _Crank Yankers_ (2002–2007). He hosted _The Adam Carolla Project_, a home improvement television program which aired on TLC in 2005 and _The Car Show_ on Speed TV[3] in 2011.

Carolla has also appeared on the network reality television programs _Dancing with the Stars_ and _The Celebrity Apprentice_. His book _In Fifty Years We'll All Be Chicks_ debuted on _The New York Times_ Best Seller list in 2010, and his second book, _Not Taco Bell Material_, also reached _New York Times_ bestseller status.[4]

Carolla has made numerous guest appearances on political talk shows as a commentator. He hosted a weekly segment, "Rollin' with Carolla", on Bill O'Reilly's _The O'Reilly Factor_.


Early life

Adam Carolla was born in Los Angeles County, California. His mother's maiden name was McCall.[5] His parents separated when Adam was young.[6] Carolla was not given a middle name by his parents; on his driver's license application he listed his middle name as "Lakers" as a joke. The application was processed without notice.[7][8] His maternal step-grandfather was screenwriter László Görög, who wrote _The Mole People_.[9]

Adam was raised in the North Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles. He attended Colfax Elementary School, Walter Reed Junior High, and North Hollywood High School. Carolla did not receive his high school diploma until years later as it was held by the school until a library fine was paid.[10] Carolla can be seen paying off the book and receiving his diploma in an episode of his 2005 television show, _The Adam Carolla Project_.[11]

During his earlier years, Carolla played Pop Warner football for seven years; he later suggested that being involved in sports saved him from a chaotic home life.[12] During his senior year at North Hollywood High School, Carolla distinguished himself in football. In December 1981, he was named to the First Team Offensive Line, Central Valley League, one of 8 leagues at the time in the LA City Section of the California Interscholastic Federation.[13]

He began living on his own at the age of 18. He briefly attended Los Angeles Valley College, a community college, where he was placed on academic probation before dropping out to work in a series of jobs, including carpet cleaner,[14] carpenter, boxing instructor,[15] and traffic school instructor.[16] Although broke, Carolla, his friends, and roommates owned a 1963 Cadillac limousine.[17]

In the early 1990s, Carolla studied improvisational comedy with The Groundlings and was a member of the ACME Comedy Theatre troupe.[18]


Radio

In 1994, Carolla volunteered his services as a boxing trainer to prepare Jimmy Kimmel for a bout being staged by KROQ-FM's morning radio program _Kevin and Bean_.[19] Kimmel was a regular on the show as "Jimmy the Sports Guy" and he was set to fight another KROQ personality in a boxing exhibition which was being billed as the "Bleeda in Reseda."[20] Carolla parlayed this opportunity into a long-running friendship and business partnership with Kimmel as well as a recurring role on _Kevin and Bean_ as cranky woodshop teacher, Mr. Birchum.[21]

_Loveline_

In October 1995, after being signed to the William Morris Agency by Mark Itkin,[22] Carolla was offered the job of co-hosting the radio call-in show _Loveline._ His co-hosts were the physician Drew Pinsky ("Dr. Drew") and Riki Rachtman. Carolla received the offer after Pinsky heard him on _Kevin and Bean_[23] (Rachtman left the show the following year.)[24] _Loveline_ is broadcast on KROQ-FM in Los Angeles and is syndicated nationwide on the Westwood One radio network.

While the format of the program was primarily a call-in show where listeners would ask questions about sex and relationships, Carolla would often spend much of the show ranting about various topics, from fart jokes to extended parodies of radio morning shows, including mocking the format's penchant for useless and repetitive weather and traffic reports. In contrast to the reserved, thoughtful Pinsky, Carolla served as the loud, funny side of the show. Carolla's character was described by one reviewer as "a toned-down version of Howard Stern minus the huge ego".[25] On September 25, 2001 Carolla and Jimmy Kimmel both had filled in for Howard Stern's head writer Jackie Martling after Martling's departure from the show in March 2001. Carolla had mentioned in various interviews and on his podcast that he was offered the job to replace Jackie Martling, but turned it down primarily due to Stern's show being located in New York as well as his commitment to _Loveline_.

The Adam Carolla Show

In October 2005, Carolla was announced as the host of a new morning radio show on the Infinity Broadcasting network. His new show would replace the popular syndicated Howard Stern Show (which was moving to satellite radio) in twelve of the 27 markets in which Stern had been broadcast including Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San Francisco, San Diego, Phoenix, and Portland, Oregon.[26] _The Adam Carolla Show_ debuted in January 2006.

In early 2008, actor Gerard Butler sat in and observed Adam Carolla on _The Adam Carolla Show_ in order to prepare for his role in _The Ugly Truth_ as a cynical and crass talk-radio host allegedly based on Carolla.[27]

On February 18, 2009, The Adam Carolla Show was canceled as part of a format switch at KLSX to AMP FM, a new top 40 station. The final show was Friday, February 20, 2009.[28]


Podcasts

The Adam Carolla Podcast

Carolla started a daily podcast on February 23, 2009, at his personal website, which would evolve into the ACE Broadcasting Network. The first Adam Carolla podcast was downloaded more than 250,000 times in the initial 24 hours, and by the third podcast, it was the number one podcast on iTunes in both the U.S. and Canada.

 During the debut week, the Adam Carolla podcast recorded 1.6 million downloads. In the second week it recorded 2.4 million downloads. By the fourth episode of the second week, featuring former Adam Carolla Show sidekick Dave Dameshek, the show was downloaded more than 500,000 times.[29] Adam stated that bandwidth cost more than $9,000 a month as of May 2009.[30]

At the end of 2009, The Adam Carolla Podcast was selected by iTunes for its end-of-the-year awards as the Best Audio Podcast of 2009.[31] On May 18, 2011, Carolla made the claim on Jimmy Kimmel Live! that The Adam Carolla Show had taken the Guinness World Record for the most downloaded podcast ever from Ricky Gervais[32][33] after he claims it received 59,574,843 unique downloads from March 2009 to March 16, 2011.[34]

"Patent Troll" Lawsuit

In 2013, Personal Audio filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Lotzi Digital, Inc., producers of The Adam Carolla Show and several other podcasts on the Carolla Digital Network. The suit alleged that owner Adam Carolla and his network of content infringed on Personal Audio's patent 8,112,504.[35]

Using the crowdfunding site FundAnything.com, listeners contributed more than $475,000 (as of August 2014) to support Carolla throughout the legal proceedings.[36]

Personal Audio dropped the lawsuit July 29, 2014, stating that the defendants were not "making significant money from infringing Personal Audio's patents". However, Carolla countersued, having already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars mounting a defense against claims he deemed unfounded. Among claims sought by the countersuit is a request that the initial patent be invalidated.[37] On August 15, 2014, Carolla and Personal Audio filed a joint motion to dismiss after reaching a settlement, the details of which are confidential, but include a six-week "quiet period" during which neither party could speak to the media.[38] Both parties' claims were dropped without prejudice, and as such could be re-filed at a later date.[39]


Television

1999 through 2004

After co-hosting (with Dr. Drew) a television version of _Loveline_ on MTV during the late 1990s, Carolla began his first original television series with _The Man Show_, along with partner and friend Jimmy Kimmel, on Comedy Central from 1999 to 2003. He left _The Man Show_ at the same time as Kimmel. Carolla has continued his work with Kimmel as a writer and guest on _Jimmy Kimmel Live!_. He also appeared on an episode of _Space Ghost Coast to Coast_ around this time.

Carolla and partner Daniel Kellison are the heads of Jackhole Productions. The two created the television show _Crank Yankers_ for Comedy Central, which revived the Mr. Birchum character. (The show premiered in 2002 on Comedy Central and returned to MTV2 on February 9, 2007, running again until March 30, 2007. The show screened in Australia on SBS Television and The Comedy Channel between 2003 and 2008.)

2005 through 2008

From August 2005 to November 2005, Carolla hosted the talk show _Too Late with Adam Carolla_ on Comedy Central.

Also in 2005, Carolla was featured in a home remodeling program called _The Adam Carolla Project_ wherein he and a crew of old friends renovated his childhood home. The 13 episodes aired on the cable channel TLC (The Learning Channel) from October through December 2005. The house was then sold for 1.2 million dollars.[40][41]

In 2006, Carolla appeared on the special summer series _Gameshow Marathon_ as a celebrity panelist on the Match Game episode.

On the February 18, 2008 broadcast of his radio show, Carolla announced that he would be one of the contestants on the next season of _Dancing with the Stars_. Later in the broadcast, it was revealed to Adam that his partner would be Julianne Hough.[42] He was voted off on the April 8, 2008 episode after his performance of the Paso Doble, after incorporating a demonstration of unicycle riding in his dance routine.

On June 16, 2008 Carolla was selected to host a pilot[43] of an American version of the popular BBC show _Top Gear_ for NBC. In December 2008, NBC decided not to pick up the show.[44]

2009 to present

On February 21, 2009, a day after his Los Angeles-based morning radio show was canceled – as part of a format change at KLSX-FM – CBS ordered a comedy pilot starring the actor/comedian. _Ace in the Hole_ was to star Carolla as a husband and father who works as a driving instructor. Carolla created and wrote the pilot with Kevin Hench ("Jimmy Kimmel Live!").[45] Carolla stated that Pamela Adlon was to play his wife and Windell Middlebrooks of the Miller High Life commercial fame will play his best friend. During his March 30, 2009, podcast, Carolla briefly described the show as being "_All in the Family_, essentially", with Carolla playing a similar role to that of Archie Bunker. On the July 23, 2009, episode of the Adam Carolla Podcast, Carolla announced that CBS was not picking up the pilot for the 2009 season, "in any way, shape or form."

On October 22, 2009, it was reported in _Variety_ that Carolla had struck a deal with NBC to produce a half-hour pilot for a sitcom. The report was later confirmed on January 4, 2010, and was the first comedy pilot ordered by NBC for the season.[46] The untitled project, written by Carolla and Kevin Hench, was a single-camera endeavor that starred Carolla as a contractor and father who attempts to rebuild his life after his wife leaves him.[47][48] Carolla was set to executive produce the NBC project along with frequent collaborators Kimmel and Hench, as well as his agent James "Babydoll" Dixon, Jon Pollack from _30 Rock_, Gail Berman, Daniel Kellison, and Lloyd Braun. Universal Media Studios, BermanBraun, and Carolla and Jimmy Kimmel's own Jackhole Industries.[49][50]

On the February 13, 2010 episode of Carolla's CarCast podcast, he broke the news that The History Channel had picked up _Top Gear US_, which NBC had decided against in 2008.[51] On the March 26, 2010, episode of CarCast, Carolla said that he would not be co-hosting _Top Gear US_ because of scheduling conflicts with his NBC sitcom project. In June 2010, Carolla said that his NBC pilot had not been picked up and was now "dead."[52]

Premiering on February 19, 2012, Carolla was also one of the contestants in the 12th season of NBC's _The Celebrity Apprentice_. He was fired in Week 4, because Trump perceived that Carolla did not utilize Andretti's car background during a Buick presentation, even though it was clear that Andretti did not like public speaking.

_The Car Show_

Carolla's _The Car Show_ debuted on Speed TV July 13, 2011. Appearing Wednesdays at 10 pm Eastern, it featured Carolla as the host, along with Dan Neil, John Salley, and Matt Farah. It had a format similar to Top Gear, mixing car reviews, tests and humor. The show was initially met with largely positive reviews from car enthusiasts and comedy fans. Talk show host and comedian Jay Leno called The Car Show, "...a lot of fun."[53] The Car Show was cancelled after one season, after undergoing format changes due to low ratings, as Carolla mentioned on his podcast January 13, 2012.

_Catch a Contractor_

_Catch a Contractor_ is a non-scripted, original series on Spike, hosted by Adam Carolla along with "no-nonsense contractor" Skip Bedell and his wife, investigator Alison Bedell. Together they expose crooked contractors and seek retribution for wronged homeowners.[54]

The show premiered on March 9, 2014, to 1.2 million viewers, the largest audience for a series debut on Spike since _Coal_ in March 2011. The show was cancelled in 2015.[55]

_Adam Carolla and Friends Build Stuff Live_

Premiering on Spike TV on March 14, 2017, _Adam Carolla and Friends Build Stuff Live_ features Carolla building projects live and in studio with some of his Hollywood friends, and tackling viewers' home improvement projects via social media.[56]

Voice acting

Carolla has also done voice acting on cartoons, including Commander Nebula on the Disney animated series _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_, Death on _Family Guy_ (replacing Norm Macdonald) and Spanky Ham on _Drawn Together_. He was also the voice of a police officer, Wynchell, who was also an éclair, in the Disney film _Wreck-It Ralph_. In 2008 and 2009, he was the spokesperson for T.G.I. Friday's.


Film

In 2003, he appeared in _Windy City Heat_ as himself.[57] In 2006, Carolla finished work on _The Hammer_, a semi-autobiographical independent film he co-wrote and co-produced, in which he stars opposite Heather Juergensen. The film is based loosely on his own life and is filmed at a gym he helped build with his co-star, Ozzie, played by Oswaldo Castillo, his friend in real life whom he met while building the gym when they both worked in construction.[58] The film made its world premiere at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City and shortly thereafter received a positive review in Variety.[59] The film was released on March 21, 2008.[60][61][62] The film is rated 80% on Rotten Tomatoes.[63]

Adam made a short appearance in Jeff Balis' _Still Waiting..._ (a sequel to _Waiting..._) playing a pick-up artist guru.

Adam helped write an unproduced screenplay for a movie entitled _Deaf Frat Guy: Showdown at Havasu_.[64]

He is the voice of Virgil in the independent short film _Save Virgil_.

In July 2013, Carolla used crowdfunding for _Road Hard_; a film he directed and starred in, about the lives of aging road comics. Adam confirmed through a press conference that the film would co-star David Alan Grier, Illeana Douglas, Diane Farr, and Larry Miller.[65] It had limited theatrical release in the United States. Several minutes of the credits are devoted to listing the names of those who helped crowdfund the movie.

Carolla also directed the documentary _Winning: The Racing Life of Paul Newman_ on the 35-year car racing career of Paul Newman. The documentary showcases Newman's racing life as both a prolific driver and owner.

In 2017, Carolla and Dennis Prager began filming _No Safe Spaces_, a documentary about political correctness at universities.[66][67]

Books

Carolla and Drew Pinsky co-wrote (with Marshall Fine) the self-help book _The Dr. Drew and Adam Book: A Survival Guide to Life and Love,_ published in 1998.[68] The book is a compilation of some of the advice the pair compiled while producing Loveline.[69]

In November 2010, Carolla's _In Fifty Years We'll All Be Chicks... And Other Complaints from an Angry Middle-Aged White Guy_ was published by Crown Archetype and debuted at number eight on the _New York Times_{{'}} Best Seller list for hardcover non-fiction on November 21, 2010.[70] The book was compiled from rants Carolla had delivered on his radio show and podcast along with some new material and was dictated to and ghost-written by Mike Lynch.[71]

Carolla published a short, illustrated e-book entitled _Rich Man, Poor Man_ in January 2012. The book details some similarities in the experiences of the very rich and the very poor which are not shared by the middle class.[72] The book was illustrated by Michael Narren.[73]

Carolla's book _Not Taco Bell Material_ was published by Crown Archetype on June 12, 2012.[74] It climbed the _New York Times_ bestseller list and received widespread praise for its satirical humor and honest, self-deprecating style.

In _President Me: The America That's in My Head,_ Carolla presents the comedian's fantasy of the United States with him at the helm.[75] When asked in separate interviews, both before and after the book's release, about whether the "if-I-were-king" critique of America was a serious piece, he said it's both: "Well, there's a lot of jokes in it, but you know, it's like... Well, if you have a fat friend you may make a lot of fat jokes about your fat friend, but he's still fat".[76][77]

Carolla's latest book is _Daddy, Stop Talking!: And Other Things My Kids Want but won't be Getting,_ in which Carolla writes about modern parenting. Carolla describes what he believes adults must do if they don't want to have to support their kids forever. Carolla uses his own childhood as a cautionary tale, and decries helicopter parenting.


Controversies

Carolla has occasionally made generalizations about various groups, leading to criticism. For example, in a late-2003 _Loveline_ episode, Carolla said that Hawaiians are "dumb," "in-bred," "retarded" people who are among the "dumbest people we have." The comments were met with anger in Hawaii and resulted in _Loveline_{{'}}s cancellation on Hawaiian affiliate KPOI.[78]

On the April 4, 2010, episode of _The Adam Carolla Show_, Carolla referred to Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao as a "fucking idiot" and said of the Philippines: "They got this and sex tours, that's all they have over there. Get your shit together, Philippines." A spokesman for President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo called Carolla an "ignorant fool." Carolla subsequently apologized via Twitter.[79][80][81]

In 2010, Carolla posed for the NOH8 Campaign.[82][83] In August 2011, Carolla released a podcast where he mocked a petition to the producers of _Sesame Street_ that demanded Bert and Ernie get married on air. He said on air that gay activists should "[j]ust get married, and please shut up" and that "Y.U.C.K." would be more memorable acronym than LGBT, and referring to transgender people he asked: "When did we start giving a shit about these people?"[84]

The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation characterized the previous remarks by Carolla as offensive, including an assertion that "all things being equal," heterosexual parents make better parents than homosexual parents. Carolla responded: "I'm sorry my comments were hurtful. I'm a comedian, not a politician."[85][86] GLAAD called the apology "empty."[87][88][89]

In June 2012, Carolla became the target of charges of sexism due to his remarks during an interview published in the _New York Post_:[90]

Carolla's comments were widely reported and criticized as sexist.[91][92][93][94] Carolla criticized coverage of his comments as over-simplistic and misleading.[95]


Personal life

On September 28, 2002, Carolla married Lynette Paradise. Lynette gave birth to their first children, twins Natalia and Santino "Sonny" Richard Carolla on June 7, 2006.[96] On _The Adam Carolla Show_, Adam repeatedly mentioned the birth was originally scheduled for June 6, but that he and Lynette decided to push it back one day as to avoid the symbolic 666 (06–06–06).

Carolla was a part owner of Amalfi, an Italian restaurant in Los Angeles. The restaurant is now closed.[97]

Carolla won the 2013 Pro/Celebrity Race as a professional and the 2012 Pro/Celebrity Race at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach as an amateur.[98] The race was run on April 14, 2012 and was broadcast on Speed TV.[99] In 2013, Carolla again competed in the Toyota Grand Prix race, this time he raced as a pro-driver. Carolla finished first in the Pro category in the 2013 race[100] Carolla has previously participated in the race in 2010 and 2003.[101][102] He finished ninth among 19 racers (fifth among the ten celebrities) in 2010[103] despite being regarded as a pre-race favorite.[104] He is also a serious automobile collector with over 20 cars. His collection includes several Lamborghinis from the 1960s and early 1970s, including two Miuras (of 764 examples ever produced), one of which he has loaned to the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, two 400GT 2+2s (of 247 units produced) and a 1965 350GT (one of 135 built). At least one Ferrari and Aston Martin and several vintage race cars round out the collection.[105]

Carolla conceived the fortified wine cocktail 'Mangria' (a pun on sangria), which later became commercialized with the Napa Valley-based _Patio Wine Company_ as a partner.

Carolla is left-handed.

Religious and political views

Carolla is an atheist.

Regarding his political views, Carolla has stated, "I guess I would be Republican, in the sense that I want a secure border, I'm not into the welfare state, I'm not into all those freebie lunch programs. It just kind of demeans people." He goes on to state, however, that he is also in favor of typically liberal causes such as the legalization of marijuana and support for as well some progressive causes such as "...  [being] against semi-automatic and automatic weapons. I'm not an NRA guy by any stretch of the imagination. I'd like alternative energy to be explored and electric cars to be used, but I want them to be powered by nuclear power plants."[106] (He is a member of the advisory board of the Marijuana Policy Project.)[107] Elsewhere, he has stated, "My feeling is this whole country is founded on the principle of 'If you are not hurting anyone, and you're not fucking with someone else's shit, and you are paying your taxes, you should be able to just do what you want to do.' It's the freedom and the independence."[108] In an interview with _Reason TV_, Carolla described his views as libertarian.[109]


Honors

Carolla and Pinsky received a Sexual Health in Entertainment (SHINE) Award from The Media Project in 2000 for "incorporating accurate and honest portrayals of sexuality" in the talk show category for _Loveline_.[110]

Asteroid 4535 Adamcarolla is named in his honor.[111]
