A FLEXIBLE SEATING CLASSROOM is one in which traditional seating charts are replaced with seating arrangements that allow the students to seat where they choose.[1] One of its principal objectives is to reduce the number/duration of sedentary periods of time, which research has identified as a danger to health. The Albemarle County Public School system in Virginia adopted this approach with reported success.


Health impacts

Studies have found that extended sitting affects the development of the musculoskeletal system, leading to health disorders such as cardiovascular problems,[2] poor posture, back pain and neck pain.[3]

According to Dieter Breithecker at Germany's Federal Institute for Posture and Mobilization Support, brain activity slows down when the body becomes stationary, for example when sitting in a traditional classroom.[4] Breithecker recommended flexible seating arrangements to remedy these dangers.

Flexible seating classroom designs include:

-   stools
-   couches
-   beanbag chairs
-   chairs
-   beds
-   mats
-   inflatable balls
-   standing
-   laying on the floor
-   pillows
-   benches
-   hanging chairs
