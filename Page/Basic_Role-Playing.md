_BASIC ROLE-PLAYING'' (_BRP'') is a role-playing game system which originated in the _RuneQuest_ fantasy role-playing game. The _BRP_ standalone booklet was first released in 1980 in the boxed set release of the second edition of _RuneQuest_. Greg Stafford and Lynn Willis are credited as the authors. A percentile skill-based system, _BRP_ was used as the basis for most of the games published by Chaosium, including _Call of Cthulhu_, _Stormbringer_, and _Elfquest_.


History

The core rules were originally written by Steve Perrin[1] as part of his game _RuneQuest_.[2] It was Greg Stafford's idea to simplify the rules (eliminating such things as Strike Ranks and Hit Locations) and issue them in a 16-page booklet called _Basic Role-Playing_. Over the years several others, including Sandy Petersen, Lynn Willis, and Steve Henderson, contributed to the system.

The _BRP_ was notable for being the first role-playing game system to introduce a full skill system to characters regardless of their profession. This was developed in _RuneQuest_ but was also later adopted by the more skill-oriented _Call of Cthulhu_.[3][4]

_BRP_ was conceived of as a generic system for playing any sort of RPG. Specific rule systems to support differing genres can be added to the core rules in a modular design. In order to underscore this, in 1982 Chaosium released the _Worlds of Wonder_ box set, which contained a revised main booklet and several booklets providing the additional rules for playing in specific genres. _Superworld_, a superhero-themed game, began as a portion of the _Worlds of Wonder_ set. A third edition of the core booklet, now titled _Basic Roleplaying: The Chaosium System_, was released in 2002.[5]

In 2004, Chaosium published the _Basic Roleplaying_ monographs, a series of paperback booklets. The first four monographs (_Players Book_, _Magic Book_, _Creatures Book_, and _Gamemaster Book_) were essentially _RuneQuest_ 3rd Edition, but with the _RuneQuest_ name and other trademarks removed, as Chaosium had lost the rights to the name but retained copyright of the rules text. Additional monographs allowing for new mechanics, thereby extending the system to other genres, were released in the following years. Many of these monographs reproduced rules from other Chaosium-published _BRP_ games that had gone out of print.

In 2008 most monographs were collected and updated as a single, comprehensive book, nicknamed the "Big Gold Book", allowing game masters to essentially build their own game from the various subsystems included. A quickstart booklet for new players accompanied it.

Other games published over the years by Chaosium using the _BRP_ ruleset include _Ringworld_, _Hawkmoon_, and _Nephilim_.


Rules system

_BRP_ is similar to other generic systems such as _GURPS_, _Hero System_ or _Savage Worlds_ in that it uses a simple resolution method which can be broadly applied. _BRP_ uses a core set of seven characteristics: Size, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Power, and Appearance or Charisma. From those, a character derives scores in various skills, expressed as percentages. These skill scores are the basis of play. When attempting an action, the player rolls percentile dice trying to get a result equal to or lower than the character's current skill score. Each incarnation of the _BRP_ rules has changed or added to the core ideas and mechanics, so that games are not identical. For example, in _Call of Cthulhu_, skills may never be over 100%, while in _Stormbringer_ skills in excess of 100% are within reach for all characters. Scores can increase through experience checks, the mechanics of which vary in an individual game.

_BRP_ treats armor and defense as separate functions: the act of parrying is a defensive skill that reduced an opponent's chance to successfully land an attack, and the purpose of armor is to absorb damage.

The last major element of many _BRP_ games is that there is no difference between the player character race systems and that of the monster or opponents. By varying ability scores, the same system is used for a human hero as a troll villain. This approach allows for players to play a wide variety of non-human species.


Licensed games

Chaosium was an early adopter of licensing out its _BRP_ system to other companies, something that was unique at the time they began but rather commonplace now thanks to the d20 licenses.[6] This places the _BRP_ in the notable position of being one of the first products to allow other game companies to develop games or game aids for their work. Companies such as Green Knight and Pagan Publishing built their earliest works to support Chaosium's games.

Other, non-Chaosium games have used _BRP_ for its core rules. For example, _Other Suns_, published by Fantasy Games Unlimited (FGU), used them under license. _BRP_ was also used as the base for the highly successful Swedish game _Drakar och Demoner_ from Target Games.[7]


Reception

Ronald Pehr reviewed _Basic Role-Playing_ in _The Space Gamer_ No. 41.[8] Pehr commented that "_Basic Role-Playing_ is too little too late. _RuneQuest_ is long established, does an adequate job of teaching role-playing, and there are now even more games to choose from. If you want to teach role-playing to a very young, but literate, child, _Basic Role-Playing_ is excellent. Otherwise, for all its charm, it's not much use."[9]

Awards

The _BRP_ itself has been the recipient, via its games, of many awards. Most notable was the 1981 Origins Award for _Best Roleplaying Rules_ for _Call of Cthulhu_.[10] Other editions of _Call of Cthulhu_ have also won Origins Awards including the Hall of Fame award. The _BRP_ Character Generation software has also won awards for its design.
