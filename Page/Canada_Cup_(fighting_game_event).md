The CANADA CUP is an annual fighting game event held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Launched as the CALGARY CUP in 2009, the event, organized by Lap Chi Duong, has been a major _Street Fighter_ tournament and is part of the Capcom Pro Tour.


Description

Property manager and granite shop owner Lap Chi Duong organizes the Canada Cup fighting game event once a year.[1] The _Street Fighter_ tournament held at the Canada Cup has been a Premier Event of the Capcom Pro Tour since 2015.[2] David "Atari" Bibona noted in 2014 that the Canada Cup is the biggest gathering of high-level _Super Street Fighter II Turbo_ players, in part due to its international focus, allowing American players to compete with Japanese competitors, where _Super Street Fighter II Turbo_ has a more active scene.[3]

_Motherboard_ described the Canada Cup in 2016 as the "largest and most prestigious fighting game tournament in the country."[4]


History

The Canada Cup started in 2009 as the Calgary Cup, held in Calgary rather than Toronto. The tournament was rebranded as the Canada Cup the following year as top _Street Fighter_ players like Daigo Umehara and Justin Wong flew in to compete in the competition. In 2011, Duong decided to charge Twitch.tv viewers of the tournaments $8.95 USD for commercial-free, high-definition livestreams, which became a running gag among the fighting game community. Duong moved the tournament to Toronto in 2012, though he had difficulty convincing sponsors and finding support. Duong stated in an interview with _Motherboard_ that he had contacted 200 unique sponsors at the time, and only one responded positively: Mad Catz. The Cup moved back to Calgary for one year in 2014, which Duong noted as the first year it did not operate at a loss.[5]

2015

In 2015, the Canada Cup became the final Premier Event of the Capcom Pro Tour season. The winner of its _Super Street Fighter IV_ tournament automatically qualified for the 2015 Capcom Cup. 13 of the top 23 players in the Capcom Pro Tour rankings competed in the competition, and _The Daily Dot_ described the Canada Cup as the "deepest tournaments of the season".[6] The tournament was eventually won by Tokido, defeating Fuudo in the finale by playing Akuma with a solid ground game.[7]

2016

Canada Cup 2016 hosted 14 tournaments. Duong invited high-level _Super Smash Bros._ players Armada, Hungrybox, and Mang0 through a publicity stunt, donating a large amount of money to their Twitch.tv streams in order to contact them. The Canada Cup was again the final _Street Fighter_ tournament of the Capcom Pro Tour, and became the first Premier Event in two years to have an American champion: Du "NuckleDu" Dang.
