An ALGEBRAIC NUMBER is any complex number (including real numbers) that is a root of a non-zero polynomial (that is, a value which causes the polynomial to equal 0) in one variable with rational coefficients (or equivalently – by clearing denominators – with integer coefficients). All integers and rational numbers are algebraic, as are all roots of integers. The same is not true for all real numbers or all complex numbers. Those real and complex numbers which are not algebraic are called transcendental numbers. They include and [[e_(mathematical_constant)|, and so are conjugate algebraic integers.

-   Some irrational numbers are algebraic and some are not:
    -   The numbers and are algebraic since they are roots of polynomials and , respectively.
    -   The golden ratio is algebraic since it is a root of the polynomial .
    -   The numbers and {{mvar are not algebraic numbers (see the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem);[1] hence they are transcendental.


 Properties

-   The set of algebraic numbers is countable (enumerable).[2][3]
-   Hence the set of algebraic numbers has Lebesgue measure zero (as a subset of the complex numbers), that is to say, "almost all" complex numbers are not algebraic.
-   Given an algebraic number, there is a unique monic polynomial (with rational coefficients) of least degree that has the number as a root. This polynomial is called its minimal polynomial. If its minimal polynomial has degree , then the algebraic number is said to be of degree . An algebraic number of degree 1 is a rational number. An algebraic number of degree 2 is a quadratic irrational.
-   All algebraic numbers are computable and therefore definable and arithmetical.
-   The set of real algebraic numbers is linearly ordered, countable, densely ordered, and without first or last element, so is order-isomorphic to the set of rational numbers.
-   For real numbers and , the complex number is algebraic if and only if both and are algebraic.[4]


The field of algebraic numbers

Algebraic_number_in_the_complex_plane.png The sum, difference, product and quotient (if the denominator is nonzero) of two algebraic numbers is again algebraic (this fact can be demonstrated using the resultant), and the algebraic numbers therefore form a field (sometimes denoted by , though this usually denotes the adele ring). Every root of a polynomial equation whose coefficients are _algebraic numbers_ is again algebraic. This can be rephrased by saying that the field of algebraic numbers is algebraically closed. In fact, it is the smallest algebraically closed field containing the rationals, and is therefore called the algebraic closure of the rationals.

The set of _real_ algebraic numbers itself forms a field.[5]

Numbers defined by radicals

All numbers that can be obtained from the integers using a finite number of integer additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, and taking th roots where is a positive integer (radical expressions) are algebraic. The converse, however, is not true: there are algebraic numbers that cannot be obtained in this manner. Such a number requires the polynomial it is a root of to be of a degree 5 or more. This is a result of Galois theory (see Quintic equations and the Abel–Ruffini theorem). An example of such a number is the unique real root of the polynomial (which is approximately ).

Closed-form number

Algebraic numbers are all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, starting from the rational numbers. One may generalize this to "closed-form numbers", which may be defined in various ways. Most broadly, all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms are called "elementary numbers", and these include the algebraic numbers, plus some transcendental numbers. Most narrowly, one may consider numbers _explicitly_ defined in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms – this does not include all algebraic numbers, but does include some simple transcendental numbers such as or ln 2.


Algebraic integers

Examples of algebraic integers are , and . Note, therefore, that the algebraic integers constitute a proper superset of the integers, as the latter are the roots of monic polynomials for all In this sense, algebraic integers are to algebraic numbers what integers are to rational numbers.

The sum, difference and product of algebraic integers are again algebraic integers, which means that the algebraic integers form a ring. The name _algebraic integer_ comes from the fact that the only rational numbers that are algebraic integers are the integers, and because the algebraic integers in any number field are in many ways analogous to the integers. If is a number field, its ring of integers is the subring of algebraic integers in , and is frequently denoted as . These are the prototypical examples of Dedekind domains.
