HANNAH ZEITLHOFER (born [1]) is the first woman to reach the rank of _Reiter_ (Rider) at the Spanish Riding School (SRS) of Vienna, Austria. She was inducted in 2016.[2][3]

Zeithofer began to ride as a child and was given her first horse when she was nine years old.[4] She studied Equestrian Science at the university level, and competed in dressage with a Haflinger named Joker.[5] She was granted admission to the SRS in 2008 at the age of 21 and was one of the first two female _élèves_, beginning or apprentice riders, ever admitted to the school.[6] Although Zeitlhofer did not express a view that she faced discrimination at the school, the school's chief rider noted that the young women had to win over a few malcontents.[7][8] Her admission to the SRS occurred about one year after the school hired its first woman director, Elisabeth Gürtler. There had never been a rule against admission of women, but in practice and by tradition, it had never previously occurred.[9] The overall program takes eight to twelve years to complete.[10] She became the first "Assistant Rider" ( in the school's history.[11]

According to the riding school, women now make up the majority of _élèves_,[12] though only about four new riders are admitted in any five-year period.[13] The second woman to follow Zeitlhofer is Assistant Rider Theresa Stefan,[14] who joined the school in 2011.[15]
