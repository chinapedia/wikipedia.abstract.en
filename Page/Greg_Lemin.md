Biography

Lemin was born in Brisbane and played his club cricket in Canberra with Tuggeranong, in the same side as Michael Bevan.[1]

He won the ACTCA player of the year award, the D B Robin Medal, in the 1993/94 season.[2]

The ACT Comets made their debut in Australia's limited-overs tournament in the 1997-98 season. Lemin played in the opening match against South Australia at Manuka Oval and took two wickets for 14 from his four overs, which remained a career best in List A cricket.[3] His other two wickets that season were both noted cricketers, the first was Ricky Ponting at Bellerive Oval, who he dismissed for 22.[4] He also took the penultimate wicket in the ACT's first win in the tournament, bowling Brad Hodge, who was Victoria's last recognised batsman.[5] He featured in a total of six List A matches, five that season, then one more in 1998-99.[6]

Still living in Canberra, Lemin works in the construction industry.[7]
