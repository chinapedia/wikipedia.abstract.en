WAT PHRA KAEO DON TAO (, literally "monastery of the Emerald Buddha on the water jar knoll"[1]) is the principal Buddhist temple in Lampang, Thailand.[2] The temple was founded by the first Mon ruler of Lampang.[3] The Emerald Buddha was enshrined at this temple from 1434 to 1468, when King Tilokaraj relocated the image to Wat Phra Singh in Chiang Mai.[4] The temple's Mon-style chedi, which is reputed to contain a strand of the Buddha's hair, is tall. It is flanked by a Burmese-style mondop, with a pyatthat spired roof, that was commissioned by Lampang's governor in 1909.[5]
