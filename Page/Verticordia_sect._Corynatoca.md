_VERTICORDIA_ SECT. _CORYNATOCA_ is one of six sections in the subgenus _Eperephes_. It includes the single species _Verticordia ovalifolia_. Plants in this section are sometimes bushy shrubs, sometimes tall and open. The flower cup has very short appendages and the staminodes have raised glands on their surface.[1]

When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991 he described the section and gave it the name _Corynatoca_.[2][3] The name "_Corynatoca_" is derived from the Ancient Greek words _koryne_ meaning "a club"[4] and _atokos_ meaning "sterile"[5] referring to the unusual staminodes.[6]

The type and only species in this section is _Verticordia ovalifolia_.[7]
