FUXING () (also known as the FUXING HAO) is a series of electric multiple unit high- and higher-speed (depending on definitions) trains operated by China Railway Corporation and developed by CRRC, which owns the independent intellectual property rights.[1][2] Initially known as the CHINA STANDARDIZED EMU, development on the project started in 2012, and the design plan was finished in September 2014. The first EMU rolled off the production line on 30 June 2015.[3][4] The series received its current designation of Fuxing in June 2017, with nicknames such as "BLUE/RED DOLPHIN" (CR400AF) and "GOLDEN PHOENIX" (CR400BF) for certain units.[5] It is the world's the fastest conventional high speed train in regular service, with a design speed of for the CR400AF and CR400BF models.[6]


History

Background

In 2007, China's Ministry of Railways drafted a plan for China's future high-speed network. Bombardier Transportation, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Alstom and later Siemens joined the high-speed train manufacture project later known as Hexie (). Forming a joint-venture with Chinese company CNR and CSR, four foreign companies signed an agreement with China to manufacture high-speed trains for China as well as provide assistance to a Chinese company to manufacture train cars locally in the future.

Some of the Hexie (Harmony) train sets are manufactured locally through technology transfer, a key requirement for China. The signalling, track and support structures, control software, and station design are developed domestically with additional foreign elements. By 2010, the track system as a whole was predominantly Chinese.[7] China currently holds many new patents related to the internal components of these trains, re-designed in China to allow the trains to run at higher speeds than the foreign designs allowed.

However, most of Hexie's (Harmony's) patents are only valid within China, and as such hold no international power. The weakness of intellectual property of Hexie causes obstacles for China to export its high-speed rail related technology, which led to the development of the completely redesigned train brand called Fuxing () that is based on local technology.[8][9][10][11]

Development

Started in 2012, CNR Changchun Railway Vehicles (now CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles), under the guidance of China Railway Corporation, with a collection of enterprises, universities, and research institutes, carried out the development of China Standardized EMU. In December 2013, CRRC Changchun completed developing the general technical conditions for EMUs, and completed the plan design in September 2014.[12][13] The EMU was rolled off the production line on 30 June 2015.[14]

According to the arrangement for the China Standardized EMU research and development work, the EMUs will receive 600,000-km experimental verification and optimization.[15] They started to experimental work at National Railway Test Center of China Academy of Railway in Beijing after they rolled off, and they were tested at up to 160 km/h.[16][17]

On 18 November 2015, the China Standardized EMU hit a speed of 385 km/h and passed the high speed test on Datong–Xi'an Passenger Railway. The EMU was tested under complicated conditions, including on bridges, in tunnels, and on slopes and turns.[18][19]

On 15 July 2016, the two China Standardized EMUs in opposite directions passed each other at 420 km/h (relative speed to one another of 840 km/h) during test runs on Zhengzhou–Xuzhou high-speed railway.[20][21]

Commercialization

Train G155 by Shanghai-based CR400BF from Beijing South railway station arrives at Shanghai Hongqiao railway station]] On 15 August 2016, the China Standardized EMU has started operation on Harbin–Dalian High-Speed Railway. The train was running as Train No. G8041 departed from Dalian North railway station to Shenyang railway station.[22][23]

From the end of 2016 to the beginning of 2017, several subsidiaries of CRRC gained licences from the National Railway Administration to produce the rolling stocks.[24][25][26]

The China Standardized EMU started its experimental long haul service on Beijing–Hong Kong High-Speed Railway on 25 February 2017.

Designation

Unlike the previous rolling stocks, the vehicles of the newly minted EMU do not bear the marks of "" or "CRH" (but CRH-0305 was an exception), on 25 June 2017, their designation "FUXING (REJUVENATION)" was published.[27]

On 26 June 2017, the CR400AF departed from the Beijing South railway station, traveling toward Shanghai, while the CR400BF also left Shanghai Hongqiao railway station bound for Beijing at the same time. It marks the China Standardized EMU started operation formally, being borne Rejuvenation.[28]


Specifications and technical features

An 8-car Fuxing set is 209m long, 3360mm wide and 4060mm high. It has an axleload of less than 17 tonnes. The train can carry 556 passengers, with 10 in business class, 28 in first class, and 518 in second class.[29] The train also reduces energy consumption, and adopts a standard parts design. It also has reinforced safety features compared with other EMUs.[30] In July 2018, 415 meter long 16 car Fuxing sets started operating. These sets can carry 1,193 passengers and will first start operating on the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway.[31]

The spacing of seats of Fuxing (Rejuvenation) is larger than Hexie (Harmony), with the first class at 1160 mm and the second class 1020 mm. It also provides Wi-Fi access.[32]


Variants

All variants of Fuxing train are compatible. The EMU models shares the same standard required by China Railway Corporation, hence the name China Standardized EMU.

Incidents and equipment issues

-   On 8 February 2018, a train numbered G89 from Beijing West railway station to Chengdu East railway station, serviced by CR400BF-5033 (with 576 seats), was forced to discontinue its journey at Xi'an North railway station, due to a mechanical malfunction (hot box). No passengers were injured. Passengers were then transferred to a CRH380B trainset with only 556 seats.[35]
-   On 27 June 2018, train no. G123 from Beijing South railway station to Shanghai Hongqiao railway station was late by 49 minutes, as it sustained an equipment failure due to an earlier service G239 which is provided by Hexie type CRH380B EMU.[36]
-   On 12 August 2018, train no. G40 from Hangzhou East railway station to Beijing South railway station collided with a flying steel plate, which was blown away from a nearby construction site close to Langfang railway station. The flying steel plates not only damaged the train itself, but caused serious traffic disruptions on the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway as the overhead catenary also sustained damages. Passengers were transferred to buses, while the damaged train was hauled to Beijing South railway station by a Dongfeng 11 diesel locomotive.[37]
-   On 26 September 2018 an inbound CR400BF-A trainset was unable to properly open its doors at Hong Kong West Kowloon railway station, as the platform edge reached beyond the track's structure gauge. The vehicle has been redirected to a different platform. No casualties or injuries has been reported.[38]
-   During the one week holiday of the National Day of the People's Republic of China (October 1–7, 2018), various services of Fuxing were forced to stop at intermediate stations along their routes, as they have been immobilized by the crowd of passengers, causing traffic disruptions. Unlike Hexie, Fuxing trains are equipped with devices that are capable of detecting certain levels of overcrowding, preventing them from any further movement to ensure safety until train staff manage to remove the necessary number of passengers.[39]
-   On 17 October 2018, China Railway Shanghai Group reported that it has implemented portable air quality measurement devices to monitor the level of hazardous fumes emitted by possibly substandard heat resistant surfaces in the passenger carriages as several complaints have been recorded by passengers and train drivers, stating the smell in the carriages is unbearable. Some passengers also suffered minor respiratory diseases such as coughing and sore throat.[40]
