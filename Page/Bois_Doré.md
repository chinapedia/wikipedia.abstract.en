BOIS DORÃ‰ is a French chateau-style mansion built in 1927 in Newport, Rhode Island.[1] The house has a unique and illustrious history, and is a part of the Ochre Point-Cliffs Historic District.[2][3]

Bois Dore was designed by New York architect Charles A. Platt for William Fahnestock, a New York banker. It is described as one of the last great houses built for Newport.[4]

It was also owned by Cambell's Soup heiress, Elinor Winifred Dorrance Hill Ingersoll.

Later, it was owned by oil heiress Carolyn Mary Skelly, daughter of William Grove Skelly. She was once dubbed the "most robbed woman in the US" by the Boston Globe.[5]
