_VEGETARIAN_ () is a 2010 South Korean erotic body horror drama film directed by Lim Woo-Seong based on the same-titled novel by Han Kang.[1] The film debuted at the 14th Busan International Film Festival on October 8, 2009 and was later released in South Korea on February 18, 2010. In January 2010, it was invited to the World Cinema Narrative Competition at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.

Justin Chang, writing for _Variety_, said, "Body horror and body art are conjoined in the tastefully kinky" film, which is a "tonally extreme portrait of a woman who swears off meat before retreating into a literally vegetative state". He felt that the film was "an audacious if borderline risible psychodrama".[2]
