_STRANGER IN PARADISE_ is an album by jazz guitarist Peter Bernstein.


Background

Bernstein and pianist Brad Mehldau had recorded together several times previously, and bassist Larry Grenadier and drummer Bill Stewart had played with the guitarist on his _Heart's Content_ album.[1]


Music and recording

Three of the tracks are Bernstein originals. The album contains "elements of hard bop and post-bop, including an intriguing, slightly off-center approach to 'Stranger in Paradise' and an intricate, moving interpretation of 'This Is Always'".[2] Also covered are "a greasy arranging of Babs Gonzales' 'Soul Stirrin' ' and a breezy take of 'That Sunday, That Summer'".[3]


Reception

_The Penguin Guide to Jazz_ commented that this and Bernstein's previous album, _Heart's Content_, "work at every level".[4]
