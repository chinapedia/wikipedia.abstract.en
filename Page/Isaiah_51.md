Parashot

The _parashah_ sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.[1] Isaiah 51 is a part of the _Consolations (Isaiah 40‚Äì66)_. {P}: open _parashah_; {S}: closed _parashah_.

    {S} 51:1-3 {S} 51:4-6 {P} 51:7-8 {S} 51:9-11 {S} 51:12-16 {S} 51:17-21 {P} 51:22-23 {P}


Verse 1

    _‚ÄúListen to Me, you who follow after righteousness,_

        _You who seek the Lord:_

    _Look to the rock from which you were hewn,_

        _And to the hole of the pit from which you were dug."_ (NKJV)[2]

Cross reference: Matthew 3:9


Verse 2

    _‚ÄúLook to Abraham your father,_

        _And to Sarah who bore you;_

    _For I called him alone,_

        _And blessed him and increased him."_ (NKJV)[3]

Sarah is mentioned alongside Abraham; Abraham is described as "the rock from which you [the Israelites] were hewn" and Sarah is described as "the hole of the pit from which you were dug",[4] the latter being a reference to her maternal womb. Abraham was called when he was alone i.e. childless.[5]

Cross reference: Ezekiel 33:24


Verse 6

    _Lift up your eyes to the heavens,_

        _and look upon the earth beneath:_

    _for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke,_

        _and the earth shall wax old like a garment,_

            _and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner:_

    _but my salvation shall be for ever,_

        _and my righteousness shall not be abolished._[6]

A part of this verse is referred to by Jesus Christ as recorded in Matthew 24:35:

    _"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away."_[7]


Verse 7

    '' Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness,''

        _the people in whose heart is my law;_

    _fear ye not the reproach of men,_

        _neither be ye afraid of their revilings._[8]

A part of this verse is referred to by Jesus Christ as recorded in Matthew 5:11:

    _"Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you,_

        _and persecute you,_

    _and shall say all manner_

        _of evil against you falsely, for my sake."_[9]


Awake, awake!

Verse 9:

    ''Awake, awake, put on strength,
    _O arm of the Lord!_ [10]

Repeated in verse 17:

    ''Awake, awake,
    _Stand up, O Jerusalem._[11]

John Skinner, in the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, says it is "difficult to decide" whether the words in verse 9 are addressed to the Lord "by the prophet himself, or by the community of true Israelites". Skinner presents verses 9-10 as a prayer for divine intervention and verses 12-16 as "the divine answer to this prayer".[12]

    ''Are You not the arm that cut Rahab apart,
    ''And wounded the serpent? [13]

The reference to Rahab is to Egypt, not to the Rahab associated with the Israelites' capture of Jericho in . Use of the name as a symbol for Egypt "rests on the conception of a conflict in days long past between Jehovah and the monsters called Rahab and the Dragon".[14] In Psalm 89, the Lord "rules the raging of the sea" and "breaks Rahab in pieces".[15]
