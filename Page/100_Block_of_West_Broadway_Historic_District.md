The 100 BLOCK OF WEST BROADWAY HISTORIC DISTRICT is a nationally recognized historic district located in Council Bluffs, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.[1] At the time of its nomination the district consisted of 30 resources, including 22 contributing buildings, and eight non-contributing buildings.[2] The linear district on the east side of the central business district is the north side of Broadway. Developed between mid-1850s and 1928, it is the only section of the street that has maintained its historical integrity.[3] The buildings are one to three stories tall with commercial space on the main floor. While many are vernacular commercial structures, others are the various revival styles of Victorian architecture.
