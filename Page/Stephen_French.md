Post-war, marriage & family

Following the end of the Civil War, Stephen French took up residence in Greenville, Illinois.[29] There, he was an active member of the Odd Fellows,[30] Good Templars[31] and of a debating club composed of the youngest business and professional men.[32] Upon leaving Greenville in the 1870s, he began teaching, for several years serving the principal of the Converse School in Springfield, Illinois.[33] Later, he took up the practice of law. He returned to Greenville to marry Margaret Alice Phillips (1846-1929) on 4 December 1873,[34] a graduate of Almira College (now Greenville University) and a granddaughter of Zachariah Connell, founder of Connellsville, Pennsylvania.[35] Margaret was the daughter of John Wesley Phillips[36][37][38][39] (and granddaughter of War of 1812 Capt. John Phillips), and Margaret Rice Connell (1808-1895)[40][41][42][43] (a daughter of Margaret Wallace[44] and Zachariah Connell (1741-1815),[45] Revolutionary War soldier and founder of Connellsville, Pennsylvania[46]).

Stephen and Margaret had three daughters:

1.  Margaret Elizabeth "Eva Grace" (French) Lawrance (29 Jul 1879[47] - 1 Jan 1945[48]),[49][50] who graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1903;[51] m. on 25 Dec 1913[52] Harry Augustus Lawrance[53][54][55] (b. 7 May 1887,[56] d. 16 Apr 1917[57])
2.  Lillian Ruth French (1877-1967, died unmarried), who attended the University of California[58]
3.  Eleanor Alice French (1874-1971, died unmarried), who attended the University of California[59] and Pomona College (Claremont, CA)[60]

In 1887, Stephen and Margaret moved to San Diego, California.[61] During their long residence in San Diego, French was keenly interested in church work.[62] He taught in the Sunday school, and for almost forty years was a member of the official board of the First Methodist Episcopal Church.[63] He was a loyal supporter of the temperance cause, in full sympathy with his wife's notable work in the W.C.T.U.[64]

Stephen French was struck by a car outside his home in San Diego, California, and succumbed to his injuries on 2 January 1929 (age 84).[65] His wife, Margaret, died on 16 October 1929 in San Diego from pneumonia.
