_CALADENIA BREVISURA_, commonly known as the SHORT-SEPALLED SPIDER ORCHID, is a plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a common, small-flowered orchid with an erect, hairy leaf and a single greenish flower with red markings, on a flowering stem up to high. It is found between Ravensthorpe and Israelite Bay.


Description

_Caladenia brevisura_ is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and about wide. The single flower (or rarely two flowers) is borne on a stem high and is long and wide. The dorsal sepal is pointed and the lateral sepals and petals are short and down-swept. The lateral sepals have narrow, red, scent-producing glands on their ends. The labellum is greenish-white with red or brown markings and a red tip. There is a dense band of calli along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs between August and October and is followed by a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing a large number of seeds. This orchid is similar to _Caladenia doutchiae_ but has shorter sepal tips and a more southerly distribution.[1][2][3]


Taxonomy and naming

_Caladenia brevisura_ was first formally described by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown in 2001 from a specimen collected near the Oldfield River. The description was published in Nuytsia.[4] The specific epithet (_brevisura_) is derived from the Latin words _brevis_ meaning "short"[5] and _sura_ meaning "calf of the leg"[6] referring to the short lateral sepal tips.[7]


Distribution and habitat

Short-sepalled spider orchid occurs between Ravensthorpe and Israelite Bay in the Coolgardie, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions[8] where it grows in shallow soil on granite and on the edges of salt lakes.[9][10][11]


Conservation

_Caladenia brevisura_ is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[12]
