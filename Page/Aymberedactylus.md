_AYMBEREDACTYLUS_ (meaning "small lizard finger") is a genus of tapejarid pterosaur from the Early Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil.[1] It contains a single species, _A. CEARENSIS._


Description

Mandibular_symphysis_of_Aymberedactylus.PNG _Aymberedactylus_ can be identified as a tapejarine tapejarid from the holotypic jawbone due to its toothlessness, slightly downturned dentary symphysis which accounts for half of the total length of the jaw, and a small crest on the bottom of the dentary (which was incompletely preserved). Small neurovascular foramina on the symphysis indicates the likely presence of a horned sheath over the tip of the jaw, which is also seen in _Tupandactylus_. The preserved portion is long.[2]

It can be distinguished from other pterosaurs by a long retroarticular process (a process to which the _depressor mandibulae_ muscle attaches, implying that _Aymberedactylus_ had good control over the movement of its jaw bones) and a small fossa, or depression, with a roughened bone texture on the splenial bone. In addition, _Aymberedactylus_ shows a unique combination of traits: the shelf on the dentary symphysis is deep, the dorsal rim of the symphysis is concave, the jaw is relatively wide, the dentary fossa is short and shallow (which indicates a relatively weak bite), and the mandibular rami form a very large angle with the symphysis. These traits are a unique combination of basal and derived characteristics within Tapejaridae.[3]

The preserved specimen of _Aymberedactylus_ would have had a wingspan of approximately , typical of tapejarids. Judging by how the bones in its skull were not yet entirely fused, it was likely a subadult.[4]


Discovery and naming

The holotype of _Aymberedactylus_, MN 7596-V, is a nearly complete mandible preserved in three dimensions. It was discovered in the Aptian-Albian Crato Formation, a konservat-lagerstätte well-known for its exquisite preservation of fossils,[5] and it was described in 2016.[6]

The name _Aymberedactylus_ is derived from the Tupi word _aymbere_ ("small lizard") and Greek _daktylos_ ("finger"), and the specific name refers to the Brazilian state of Ceará, which it was discovered in.[7]


Phylogeny

Azhdarchoid_mandibles.PNG A phylogenetic analysis conducted in 2016 recovered _Aymberedactylus_ as the most basal tapejarine.[8]
