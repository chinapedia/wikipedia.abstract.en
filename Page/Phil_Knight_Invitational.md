The PHIL KNIGHT INVITATIONAL or THE PK-80–PHIL KNIGHT INVITATIONAL was a 16-team, two-bracket college basketball event held in Portland, Oregon on November 23, 24, and 26, 2017 to honor Nike co-founder Phil Knight's 80th birthday.[1][2] The two eight-team brackets ran simultaneously in the Moda Center and Veterans Memorial Coliseum in the Rose Quarter with the crowning of two champions.[3] Michigan State won the Victory Bracket[4] while Duke won the Motion Bracket.[5]

All games from Portland were televised on ESPN networks. The tournament was called the best in-season tournament ever due to the quality of the teams participating.[6]


Brackets

All teams had a business relationship with Nike. Each of the Power Five conferences of FBS football had two teams participating—the ACC (Duke and North Carolina), the Big 12 (Oklahoma and Texas), the Big Ten (Michigan State and Ohio State), the Pac-12 (Oregon and Stanford) and the SEC (Arkansas and Florida). Two non-football conferences also had two teams involved—the Big East (Butler and DePaul) and the West Coast Conference (Gonzaga and Portland). The remaining participants were Connecticut from the American Athletic Conference and Portland State from the Big Sky Conference.[7] Georgetown was originally announced as a participant in the tournament, but withdrew from the tournament in July.[8] DePaul replaced them in the tournament.[9]

The teams were divided into two separate brackets: the Victory and Motion Brackets. Teams from the same conference were placed in separate brackets to avoid non-league sanctioned matchups.[10] The field included 10 of the previous 14 National Champions and three of the Final Four participants from the 2017 NCAA Tournament (North Carolina, Gonzaga, and Oregon).
