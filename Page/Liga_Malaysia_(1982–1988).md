LIGA MALAYSIA (1982–1988) () was an amateur football league in Malaysia that operated from 1982 until 1988. The league was managed by Football Association of Malaysia. Malaysian League was established in 1982 after an introduction of league trophy for the winner of league stage qualification round for the Piala Malaysia competition.[1][2]

During its inaugural season in 1982, 16 teams participated in a single league-tier.[3] All 13 state football teams, Kuala Lumpur, Armed Forces, and Brunei compete in the league. In 1985, Singapore joined the Piala Malaysia competition again and thus also compete for the Malaysian League.[4][5]

A new format with the introduction of league stage was done in 1979 where eight top teams will qualified from the league to compete in knock-out stage of the Piala Malaysia.[6]

The league was the nation's top-tier league until it was succeeded by the formation of Liga Semi-Pro in 1989 by Football Association of Malaysia.
