Brzostrelka_Hellriegel_-_2.jpg Brzostrelka_Hellriegel_-_3.jpg STANDSCHÜTZE HELLRIEGEL 1915 was an Austro-Hungarian water-cooled sub machine gun produced during World War I in very limited prototype numbers.

Standschütze is believed to be referring the Austro-Hungarian reserve force, the Standschützen, while Hellriegel is an Austrian surname, though the significance of how these names relate to the weapon's background is unclear.[1]

The light machine gun could be fed from standard box magazines, or from a large drum magazine which was not actually connected to the weapon and instead fed the cartridges through a flexible chute. The unusual appearance of this drum magazine has led many people to assume it is belt fed, however this is not the case with the rounds being unconnected from one another and are propelled along the drum and feed chute by a spring.[2]

Little is known about the weapon, which does not appear to have progressed from the prototype stage. The only weapon produced was probably scrapped and disassembled.


In popular culture

The Standschütze Hellriegel M1915 appears as a weapon in the first-person shooter _Battlefield 1_ by DICE and EA.
