RICHARD DAVID BACH (born June 23, 1936)[1] is an American writer. Bach is widely known as the author of some of the 1970s' biggest sellers, including _Jonathan Livingston Seagull_ (1970) and _Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah_ (1977). Bach has written numerous works of fiction, and also non-fiction flight-related titles.

Most of Bach's books have been semi-autobiographical, using actual or fictionalized events from his life to illustrate his philosophy. Bach's books espouse his philosophy that our apparent physical limits and mortality are merely appearance. Bach is noted for his love of aviation and for his books related to flying in a metaphorical context. Bach has pursued flying as a hobby since the age of 17. In late August 2012, Bach was badly injured when on approach to landing at Friday Harbor, Washington, his aircraft clipped some power lines and crashed upside down in a field.


Early life

Bach was born in Oak Park, Illinois to Roland R. Bach, an American Red Cross chapter manager, and Ruth (n√©e Shaw).[2] He attended Long Beach State College in 1955.

Bach's first airplane flight occurred at age 14, when his mother was campaigning for a seat on the council of Long Beach, California. Her campaign manager, Paul Marcus, mentioned that he flew airplanes, and invited Richard on a flight in his Globe Swift.[3]


Aviation career

Bach served in the United States Navy Reserve, then in the New Jersey Air National Guard's 108th Fighter Wing, 141st Fighter Squadron (USAF), as a Republic F-84F Thunderstreak fighter pilot. He then worked at a variety of jobs, including as a technical writer for Douglas Aircraft and as a contributing editor for _Flying_ magazine. He served in the USAF reserve and was deployed in France in 1960. He later became a barnstormer.

During the summer of 1970, Bach and his friend Chris Cagle traveled to Ireland, where they participated in flying sequences for Roger Corman's film _Von Richthofen and Brown_. They flew a variety of World War I aircraft of the Blue Max collection owned by ex-RCAF pilot Lynn Garrison. Bach and Garrison first met when Bach wrote articles for _Avian_, Garrison's aviation publication.

Most of Bach's books involve flight in some way, from the early stories which are purely about flying aircraft, to _Stranger to the Ground_, his first book, to his later works, in which he used flight as a philosophical metaphor.


Literary career

Richard Bach's first book, the autobiographical _Stranger to the Ground_ (1963) described the deployment to France of his Air National Guard unit, and was well reviewed, for example by Edmund Fuller in the _Wall Street Journal_.

In 1970, _Jonathan Livingston Seagull_, a story about a seagull who flew for the love of flying rather than merely to catch food, was published by Macmillan Publishers after the manuscript was turned down by several others. It had been first published, free, in _Soaring_, the monthly magazine of the Soaring Society of America. The book, which included photos of seagulls in flight by photographer Russell Munson, became a number-one bestseller. The book, which contained fewer than 10,000 words, sold more than 1,000,000 copies in 1972 alone.[4] The surprise success of the book was widely reported in the media in the early 1970s.[5]

In 1973, _Jonathan Livingston Seagull_ was adapted into a film of the same name, produced by Paramount Pictures Corporation, with a soundtrack by Neil Diamond. In 1975, Bach was the driving force behind _Nothing by Chance_, a documentary film based on his book of the same name. The film centers on modern barnstorming around the United States in the 1970s. Bach recruited a group of his friends who were pilots to recreate the era of the barnstormer.[6]

A second novel, _Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah_, published in 1977, tells of an encounter with a modern-day messiah who has decided to quit.

On August 31, 2012, Bach was injured in an aircraft landing accident on San Juan Island in Washington. He was landing his aircraft, a 2008 Easton Gilbert G Searey (N346PE) that he nicknamed _Puff_, at a private airport when the landing gear clipped some power lines. He crashed upside down in a field about two miles from Friday Harbor, taking down two poles and sparking a small grass fire.[7]

The day after the accident, Bach was reported to be in serious but stable condition with a head injury and broken shoulder.[8] Bach was hospitalized for four months. He reported that his near-death experience inspired him to finish the fourth part of _Jonathan Livingston Seagull_, which had been originally published in three parts.[9]

In December 2012, _Publishers Weekly_ reported that _Travels with Puff_, the book Bach wrote about crossing the United States in _Puff_, had been sent to his publisher the day before his accident.[10] _Travels with Puff_ was released on March 19, 2013.

In 2014, Bach published his sequel to _Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah_, which he called _Illusions II: The Adventures of a Reluctant Student_. The story incorporates Bach's real-life aircraft crash, with the author imagining he is being visited by the "messiah" Don Shimoda, who helps him through his difficult medical recovery. Other fictional characters and references also appear.


Personal life

Bach had six children with his first wife, Bette Jeanne Franks. Also a pilot, she is the author of _Patterns: Tales of Flying and of Life_, a book about her life as a pilot and single mother.[11] She typed and edited most of Richard's aviation writing. They divorced in 1970, and Bach spent years without seeing his children.

Richard and Bette's son Jonathan, named after the titular character in Bach's bestseller, _Jonathan Livingston Seagull,_ is a software engineer and journalist. He wrote the 1993 book _Above the Clouds,_ about growing up without knowing his father and then later meeting him as a college student. Richard gave his approval, although he noted that it included some personal history he would "rather not see in print."[12]

Their other children are Robert, a commercial airline pilot; Kristel; James Marcus Bach, a computer expert and writer; Erika; and their youngest daughter, Bethany, who was killed in an accident at the age of 15 in 1985.

In 1977, Bach married actress Leslie Parrish, whom he met during the making of the film _Jonathan Livingston Seagull_. She featured significantly in two of his subsequent books: _The Bridge Across Forever_ and _One: A Novel_, which primarily focused on their relationship and Bach's concept of soulmates. They divorced in 1997.[13]

Bach married his third wife, Sabryna Nelson-Alexopoulos, in April 1999.
