Legendary narrative

According to the _Kojiki_, , later Emperor Ankan, was the elder son of Emperor Keitai, who is considered to have ruled the country during the early-6th century, though there is a paucity of information about him.[4] When Ankan was 66 years old, Keitai abdicated in favor of him.

Ankan's contemporary title would not have been _tennō_, as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. Rather, it was presumably , meaning "the great king who rules all under heaven". Alternatively, Ankan might have been referred to as or the "Great King of Yamato".

The most noteworthy event recorded during his reign was the construction of state granaries in large numbers throughout Japan, indicating the broad reach of imperial power at the time.[5]

Ankan's grave is traditionally associated with the Takayatsukiyama kofun in Habikino, Osaka.
