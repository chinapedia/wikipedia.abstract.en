The SULTAN ABDUL HALIM MU'ADZAM SHAH GALLERY (Malay: _Galeri Sultan Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah_) is a museum in Alor Setar, Kedah, Malaysia showcasing the history and artifacts of Kedah Sultan Abdul Halim ibni Almarhum Sultan Badlishah.


History

The building was originally completed in November 1922 as the new High Court[1] to assume the functions of its predecessor. The building would see long-term use as the High Court until June 2005, when it was relocated to a new courts complex at Suka Menanti Street. The building was later repurposed as a gallery in 2007 at the cost of RM16 million.[2][3][4]


Architecture

The High Court building was originally designed by architect F. W. Wade with construction overseen by H. W. Fofden. Similar to the old High Court, the building incorporates Neoclassical architecture but adopts a conservative and streamlined late-stage variation of the style, featuring colonnades and a Palladian profile but lacking the eclectic ornamentation of the old High Court.

Conversion of the building into a gallery in the 2000s involved repurposing the existing building as well as constructing a modern extension mimicking the exterior style of the original structure behind the original building; the conversion work was undertaken by architect firm Rusman, with the Seri Temin Development Corporation contracted to manage construction work, _Azam Hias_ undertaking exterior works, and _Syarikat Mariwasa Kraftangan_ managing gallery artifacts work.[5]


Exhibitions

The gallery displays photos, collections, equipment, tool, official documents, jewellery etc. from the Sultan from more than 2,000 artifacts.[6]


Opening time

The gallery opens from 10.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. for a cost of MYR5.[7]


Transportation

The gallery is accessible within walking distance north of Alor Setar railway station.
