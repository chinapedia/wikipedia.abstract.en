4ZR was officially opened on 23 July 1937 by Attorney-General, Robert Menzies.[2][3]

The station is currently owned by Resonate Broadcasting. Resonate purchased 4ZR in 2015, along with a number of other regional Queensland stations that were formerly part of the Macquarie Radio Network. Due to a merger between Macquarie and Fairfax Radio, the stations were offloaded in compliance with ACMA regulations.[4][5]

Programming on 4ZR is made up of a combination of locally presented shows, regionally networked programs such as _Rural Queensland Today_,[6] and nationally syndicated talk shows from capital cities such as those presented by Ray Hadley, Alan Jones and Steve Price.[7]
