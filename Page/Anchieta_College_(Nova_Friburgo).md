History

Anchieta College was founded in April 1886 by Jesuit priests and brothers from the Roman Province. It is currently a part of the Central-Eastern Brazil Province of the Society of Jesus.

The College opened in a large farm house on Burn Hill, known among Swiss settlers as "The Chateau," a name still applied to it by many in the city. It began as a boarding school for students from all over Brazil.[2]
