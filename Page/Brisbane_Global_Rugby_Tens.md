The GLOBAL 10S is a rugby tens tournament held during February each year in Brisbane at Suncorp Stadium. It is hosted by Duco Events and the Queensland Rugby Union. The inaugural tournament was held in 2017.[1][2]

The Super Rugby teams from Australia and New Zealand take part in the tournament each year with other teams from around the world also invited.[3] For the 2017 tournament, RC Toulonnais, Blue Bulls, Manu Samoa, and the Panasonic Wild Knights were invited.[4]

The teams compete for a grand prize of $250,000 AUD over two days, first playing in group stages before entering finals.[5] Between 300 and 400 players attend each event.[6][7] A 'legend wildcard', is allocated to each team allowing a former star player to join their match day squads.[8]

The tournament provides a small economic boost to Queensland through tourism and consumer spending.[9]
