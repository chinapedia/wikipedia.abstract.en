_ENTOURAGE_ () is a South Korean television series starring Cho Jin-woong, Seo Kang-joon, Lee Kwang-soo, Park Jung-min and Lee Dong-hwi. It is a black comedy drama about life in the entertainment industry, based on the American drama series of the same name. It started airing on cable network tvN from November 4, 2016, and finished airing December 24, 2016.[1][2]

The series scored low ratings in South Korea; some have argued that the low ratings were a result of the series being atypical of Korean dramas, particularly its black humour and perhaps American vibe. [3]


Synopsis

A story about a movie star and his entourage of buddies navigating their way through show business and enjoying all the perks along the way.

    A.k.a. "Cup Noodles", he is Young-bin's best friend. An average boy-next-door who gets thrown into the world of showbiz when his best friend becomes a star. He now acts as Young-bin's personal manager and despite his will, is treated badly by the CEO, causing him to be skeptical about his job.
