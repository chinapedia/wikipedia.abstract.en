SEAMUS MCGUIRE is an Irish fiddle player born in County Sligo now residing in County Donegal. In 1966, he won Sligo's prestigious "Fiddler of Dooney" competition.[1] He is a founding member of "Buttons and Bows" (with Manus McGuire, Jackie Daly and Garry O'Briain), as well as "The West Ocean String Quartet" (with Niamh Crowley, Kenneth Rice, and Neil Martin).[2] The quartet reflects his classical training and his love of exploring spaces where classical and traditional musics can meet. Like his younger brother Manus McGuire, another renowned fiddle player, he is a medical doctor.[3]
