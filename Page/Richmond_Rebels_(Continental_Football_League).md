The RICHMOND REBELS were a professional American football team based in Richmond, Virginia. They began play in 1964 as a member of the Atlantic Coast Football League. The Rebels became a charter member of the Continental Football League in 1965. The team consistently lost money for its owners, so after the 1966 CFL season the franchise was first put up for sale and then returned to the league.[1] When new ownership could not be found the team's players were offered in a dispersal draft, putting an end to the franchise.[2]
