The LENNON WALL or JOHN LENNON WALL is a wall in Prague, Czech Republic. Once a normal wall, since the 1980s it has been filled with John Lennon-inspired graffiti, pieces of lyrics from Beatles' songs, and other designs relating to local and global causes.[1]


History and ongoing development

Located in a small and secluded square across from the French Embassy, the wall received its first decoration following the 1980 assassination of John Lennon when an unknown artist painted a single image of the singer-songwriter and some lyrics.[2]

In 1988, the wall was a source of irritation for the communist regime of Gustáv Husák. Following a short-lived era of democratization and political liberalization known as the Prague Spring, the newly installed communist government dismantled the reforms, inspiring anger and resistance to the loss of freedoms. Young Czechs wrote grievances on the wall and in a report of the time this led to a clash between hundreds of students and security police on the nearby Charles Bridge. The liberalization movement these students followed was described as "Lennonism" (not to be confused with "Leninism") and Czech authorities described these people variously as alcoholics, mentally deranged, sociopathic, and agents of Western free market capitalism.

The wall continuously undergoes change and the original portrait of Lennon is long lost under layers of new paint. Even when the wall was repainted by some authorities, by the next day it was again full of poems and flowers. Today, the wall represents a symbol of global ideals such as love and peace.

The wall is owned by the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which allowed the graffiti to continue on the wall, and is located at _Velkopřevorské náměstí_ (Grand Priory Square), Malá Strana.[3]

On 17 November 2014, the 25th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, the wall was painted over in pure white by a group of art students, leaving only the text "wall is over" . The Knights of Malta initially filed a criminal complaint for vandalism against the students, which they later retracted after gaining contact with them.[4] The wall mural is still there as of July 23, 2017. And the "Wall is Over" bit has been changed to "War Is Over”, a song.

On April 22, 2019 - Earth Day - the action group Extinction Rebellion repainted the entire wall with slogans demanding action from the Czech government on Climate Change. "KLIMATICKÁ NOUZE" was painted in large block print letters, which reads "climate emergency" in the Czech language. Passing members of the public were encouraged to add their own message during the process, resulting in calls for action painted in several languages. A giant image of a skull was also painted on the wall. The repaint was carried out in a manner which allowed some of the existing artwork to be included in the new look wall.[5]

In July 2019, artists painted a memorial on the wall for Hong Kong democracy activist Marco Leung Ling-kit, who became known as a martyr and a symbol of hope for the 2019 anti-extradition bill protest movement.[6] The image on the wall depicts the yellow raincoat he was wearing during the banner drop that eventually led to a fall from the building, along with some words of solidarity: "Hong Kong, Add oil."[7][8]


Lennon Walls in Hong Kong

June 2019]] During the 2014 democracy protests in Hong Kong, a similar Lennon Wall appeared along the staircase outside of the Hong Kong Central Government Offices. Inspired by the original in Prague, many thousands of people posted colourful post-it notes expressing democratic wishes for Hong Kong.[9] The wall was one of the major arts of the Umbrella Movement.[10] Throughout the several months of occupations and protest, many efforts were made by different groups to ensure physical and digital preservation of the Hong Kong Lennon Wall.[11][12][13]

Five years later, during the 2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests, the same wall was again created, with new post-it notes. Within days, dozens of post-it-note Lennon Walls had "blossomed everywhere" (遍地開花)[14] throughout Hong Kong, including on Hong Kong Island itself, Kowloon, the New Territories, and on the many outlying islands.[15][16][17] According to a crowd-sourced map of Hong Kong, there are over 140 Lennon Walls throughout the region.[18]

Lennon Walls have also appeared outside of Hong Kong in the cities of: Toronto, Vancouver BC, Tokyo, Berlin, London, Sydney, Manchester, Melbourne, and Taipei.[19][20][21][22][23]
