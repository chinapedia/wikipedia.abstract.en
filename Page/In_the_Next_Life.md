Stereogum premiered the album's first single "If Only" on October 19, 2016[3] and Billboard debuted the exclusive premiere of the video shot in Joshua Tree and directed by Liz Bretz.[4] "If Only" was featured during the closing scenes of NBC's fall drama, _This Is Us_.[5] NPR premiered the full album stream on "First Listen" saying "she's made perhaps her warmest and most affecting album... and filled it with gorgeous, touching songs about family, legacy, fear and the pursuit of contentment."[6] On December 5, "Free Song" was featured as KCRW's "Today's Top Tune."[7] Buzzbands.LA said "_In the Next Life_'s 10 poignant vignettes wrap with the closer "Pretty Scars" (which features Joshua Radin), a musical timeline of Taylor mileposts that's breathtaking in its intimacy.".[8] In their review of the album, Innocent Words said "Taylor has one of the most remarkable singing voices of the last 20 years... One that is more comforting than bombastic, more soulful than aggressive. She is real."[9]
