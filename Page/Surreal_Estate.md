_SURREAL ESTATE_ () is a 1976 French mystery film directed by Argentine filmmaker Eduardo de Gregorio, who is best known for his screenwriting work with Jacques Rivette.


Plot

_Surreal Estate_ tells the story of Eric Sange (Corin Redgrave), an English novelist who, seeking to by a house in France as an investment, discovers a run-down mansion inhabited by three strange women: Ariane (Rivette regular Bulle Ogier), Agathe (Marie-France Pisier), and their ostensible housekeeper, Céleste (Leslie Caron). Together, these women draw Eric into a gothic mystery that his own novelistic experience tells him is hackneyed, but which he nonetheless finds irresistible.[1]

Reception

Imran Khan of PopMatters says of the film: "Very much a film of its time, it helped to corner a market in French cinema that had seen a tiny flourish of fantasy-themed dramas first initiated by Jacques Rivette’s _Céline and Julie Go Boating_ (1974), a film that dispensed with logic and chronology for a shattered perspective on cinematic narrative."[2]
