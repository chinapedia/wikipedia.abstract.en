History

Tradition holds a church at the site was first erected in the 5th century by the Magister Militum Severo using the remains of a former pagan temple. Some of the elements of the walls on the right appear to derive from a late-Roman empire building. Likely a church was erected atop a prior Roman structure in the 7th or 8th centuries with a single hall ending in a semicircular apse. In the 10th to 11th centuries it was subdivided into three naves. A Benedictine monastery was established alongside. The area, prone to flooding acquired the suffix of _pantano_ or swamp.

The church is first documented as dependant on the Abbey of Farfa in 1115. The façade was added in the 14th and 15th centuries. It has a square face with a Gothic rose window. To the right of the facade is a square 14th-century tower. To the left of the church on the wall of the monastery is a spolia depicting the _Sacrifice of Iphigenia_. The complex stood beside the ancient Via Flaminia.

The interior houses a number of tomb memorials as well as Roman spolia. The walls have fresco fragments. The left wall has a 13th-century wooden crucifix. The first column on the right has a frescoed depiction of a saint with a papyrus. The altar of the right nave has a 15th-century depiction of the _Madonna and Child with Saints Barbara and Antony Abbot_ by Niccolò di Vannuccio. The wall has a 14th-century fresco depicting Saints Antony Abbot, Peter, Fortunato, and Honophrius; the apse depicts the Virgin and child with Saints Felix and Benedict. On the left wall is a 17th-century Crucifixion with Saints Severo and Francis.[1]
