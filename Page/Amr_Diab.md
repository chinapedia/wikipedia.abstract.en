Music videos

Diab is one of the first singers to popularize music videos in the whole MENA region and is the first Egyptian singer to appear in music videos.[12]


Film career

It also starred Madiha Kamel. His second film _Ice Cream in Gleam_ (_Ays Krim fi Glym_), in which Diab starred in 1992, was chosen as one of the best five Egyptian musical films by the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television.

David Chute of the _Los Angeles Weekly_ termed it "observant" and "a big leap".[13] His third movie was released in 1993, and was named _Deahk We La'ab_ (_Laughter and Fun_). The film premiered in the Egyptian Film Festival in 1993. Amr played alongside international Egyptian movie star Omar Sharif (_Lawrence of Arabia_, _Doctor Zhivago_) and Yousra.
