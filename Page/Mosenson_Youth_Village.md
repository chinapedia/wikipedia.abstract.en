The MOSENSON YOUTH VILLAGE is a youth village in Hod HaSharon, Israel. The youth village was named after Ben Zion Mossensohn, a teacher, public figure and one of the founders of Tel Aviv.


History

Mosinzon school was established as a school for agriculture, and was part of a network of schools of the Zionist Youth Movement. Its goal was to teach the young immigrants (_olim_) arriving from the diaspora, along with Israeli youth from around the country, for life of labor, creativity and self-fulfillment, in science, technology, arts and sports. To this end, a boarding school was established, and exists until these days, as part of the youth village.

By the end of World War II, the youth village received young Holocaust survivors who immigrated to Israel. In 1943 the first class of the survivors graduated.

Comprehensive studies started in 1967 in collaboration with the local municipality of Hod-Hasharon.
