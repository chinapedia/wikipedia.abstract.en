_HAPLOPORUS CYLINDROSPORUS_ is a species of poroid crust fungus in the family Polyporaceae. Found in China, it causes a white rot in decomposing angiosperm wood.


Taxonomy

The fungus was collected from Ailaoshan Nature Reserve in Jingdong County (Yunnan Province) in August 2015, and described as a new species the following year. The specific epithet _cylindrosporus_ refers to the cylindrical spores.[1]


Description

Fruit bodies of _Haploporus cylindrosporus_ are crust-like, measuring long, wide, and up to 2 mm thick at the centre. The hymenophore, or pore surface, is white to cream coloured. The pores number around four to five per millimetre. There is a distinct margin that surrounds the fruit body, which is up to 2.5 mm wide.[2]

The hyphal structure is dimitic, meaning that there are both generative and skeletal hyphae. The generative hyphae have clamp connections. The thick-walled, cylindrical spores typically measure 10–11.5 by 4.5–5 μm.[3]
