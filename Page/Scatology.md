In medicine and biology, SCATOLOGY or COPROLOGY is the study of feces.

Scatological studies allow one to determine a wide range of biological information about a creature, including its diet (and thus where it has been), health and diseases such as tapeworms. The word derives from the Greek ( ) meaning "dung, feces"; _coprology_ derives from the Greek of similar meaning.[1][2][3]

A comprehensive study of scatology was documented by John Gregory Bourke under the title _ Rites of All Nations_ (1891). An abbreviated version of the work (with a foreword by Sigmund Freud), was published as _The Portable Scatalog_ in 1994.[4]


Psychology

In psychology, a scatology is an obsession with excretion or excrement, or the study of such obsessions.


Sexual fetish

In sexual fetishism, scatology (usually abbreviated _scat_) refers to coprophilia, when a person is sexually aroused by fecal matter, whether in the use of feces in various sexual acts, watching someone defecating, or simply seeing the feces. Entire subcultures in sexuality are devoted to this fetish.


Literature

In literature, "scatological" is a term to denote the literary trope of the grotesque body. It is used to describe works that make particular reference to excretion or excrement, as well as to toilet humor. A common example is John Dryden's _Mac Flecknoe_, a poem that employs extensive scatological imagery to ridicule Dryden's contemporary Thomas Shadwell. In German literature in particular is a wealth of scatological texts and references, which includes such books as Collofino's _Non Olet_.[5] A case which has provoked an unusual amount of comment in the academic literature is Mozart's scatological humour. Smith, in his review of English literature's representations of scatology from the Middle Ages to the 18th century, notes two attitudes towards scatology. One of these emphasises the merry and the carnivalesque. This is found in Chaucer and Shakespeare. The other attitude is one of self-disgust and misanthropy. This is found in the works of the Earl of Rochester and Jonathan Swift.[6]
