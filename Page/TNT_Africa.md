TNT is an African pay television channel centred towards movies. The channel is available in Africa (as TNT Africa) and the Arab world (as TCM MENA). In the Arab world, TCM has a unique schedule, and its movies are broadcast with Arabic subtitles, which are optional.

TCM MENA started broadcasting on 1 January 2016, the date when it separated from TNT Africa (formerly TCM Africa) and became an independent feed. TCM Middle East is exclusively available on BeIN.[1] In Africa, TNT is exclusively available on DStv and Black.


History

The African website name is TCMAfrica.com which launched in 2010.

Turner Classic Movies Africa switched to 16:9 Widescreen on 15 November 2015. On December 27, 2015, Turner Classic Movies stopped broadcasting on OSN and moved to beIN in the Arab world.[2] This was the result of an agreement between Turner Broadcasting System Europe and beIN which moved all Turner-owned pay TV channels to that satellite TV operator, including TCM, Cartoon Network, and Boomerang.[3]

On 1 January 2016, TCM MEA split into TCM Africa and TCM MENA. On 21 September 2018, TCM Africa was rebranded to TNT Africa with this version being a movie channel carrying a bit of TCM in its line-up for a modern audience across South Africa on DStv and Black. The rebranding allowed TCM Africa to offer such films as _Doom_, _Gladiator_ _The Green Mile_, _Hellboy 2: The Golden Army_, _The Illusionist_, _Robin Hood_, and _Tango & Cash_ for at least two days.[4]. On 18 December 2018, TNT Africa and Cartoon Network Africa were launched in HD on DStv.[5][6]
