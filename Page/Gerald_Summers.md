GERALD SUMMERS (1899–1967) was a British mid-century modern furniture designer. He came to prominence with his design for the _Bent Plywood Armchair_. Another of his noted works was the _Two-Tier Table_. Both pieces were designed in 1934 and manufactured by Makers of Simple Furniture, the firm he founded.[1][2][3]


Life

Summers was born in Alexandria, Egypt in 1899, the youngest of six children. He attended Eltham College located in the south eastern part of London. He concentrated on principles of Christianity as well as carpentry. One of his classes included instruction in furniture design where he shone as a student.

In 1915, Summers left school at the age of 16 with no plans. An apprenticeship through a family friend who practiced at the Ruston Engineering Firm followed, but his experience was cut short when he joined the army during the World War I. He returned home from the war and married Marjorie Butcher. She became his partner and as a gift to her, Summers made her an elegant table. This table was the introduction to his design career.

Summers was interested in making simple furniture with his wife as his partner in 1929. He embraced the contemporary style and pushed its boundaries. He later had the opportunity to hold his own exhibition at the Fortnum & Mason department store in London. Also participating in the exhibitions was another famous maker of a plywood armchair, Alvar Aalto.

With the positive response at the exhibition, Summers began to specialize in malleable and free-form designs. He first designed an airplane plywood which sparked the beginning of the most creative and innovative designs. He became known for his Bent Plywood Armchair, which showed off his ability of folding, bending and molding wood to achieve high standards of flexibility. Summers had the ability to transform a given wood material into a diverse, different and seamless piece of furniture with a glossy surface, combined with the modernistic touch on life.

During World War II, Summers' firm closed. But the impact left by his work was still evident. Summers' furniture is widely appreciated in the current architectural world. He is still celebrated as an icon of impressive furniture designs. Summers died in 1967, at the age of 68. Summers' furniture is widely appreciated in the current design and his pieces are prized by museums and collectors alike.[4]


Bent Plywood Armchair

Bent_Plywood_Chair.jpg Summers' organically shaped armchair, comfortable even without cushions, involved low material and labour inputs. With its smooth surface and lack of metal connectors, it is hygienic and deteriorates only gradually. Its unusual shape probably stems from Alvar Aalto's furniture, especially the spectacular “Paimio” chair, which was shown in London in 1933. In his own company, Makers of Simple Furniture, Ltd., founded in 1929, Summers produced only 120 units of the chair. Despite the constructive advantages, the production costs of the chair and thus the sales price were higher than the designs of the popular Scandinavian. It was certainly also a disadvantage that the back legs could not withstand great stress and snapped easily.[5]


Two Tier Table

Two_Tier_Table.jpg This item was an occasional table designed in 1934 by Gerald Summers and made by 'Makers of Simple Furniture', a small British company producing furniture mainly to order. The item was a simple drum style table made of birch plywood. It is considered a rare and very collectible piece of British modernism, with birch plywood drum and top, in good refinished condition. The table had been stained dark at some stage, and on close inspection there are some remnants of the stain in the grain around the edge of the table.[6]
