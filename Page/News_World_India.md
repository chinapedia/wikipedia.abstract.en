About

News World India is a national Hindi news channel from F7 Broadcast Pvt. Ltd.[6] Earlier the channel operation was being carried out from Laxmi Studio in Film City, Noida. Currently, the channel has been shifted to Sector-4, Noida. The channel is positioned as people's channel and is unbiased on political grounds. It is different from already existing debate channels and poses itself to be research oriented. The channel is quite brand conscious in terms of bringing in advertisers.[7]

News World India is the flagship channel of the News World India Network. The National Hindi language channel aims to cut through the chaos and offers news to the upwardly mobile Indian middle class in an interesting, engaging and interactive manner without any exaggeration or shrillness attached to it. The language is simple yet subtle.

Launched in Oct 2015, News World India has been able to carve a niche for itself with its classy, sensitive programming. A distinguishing feature of the channel is the amount of international coverage offered which is necessary for an increasingly globalised world. Besides on-the-hour news bulletins, News World India offers insightful shows helmed by experienced television personalities.[8]

F7 Broadcast has made several Documentaries, CSR Films and Business / Corporate Films.
