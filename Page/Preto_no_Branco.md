The album features appearances by Olavo Bilac and TC and the duet by the fado singer Mariza who made the first disco single UPA - Undiso Para Ajudar, a disc with the original duets of Portuguese artists and serves with a company of social actions which had heard on the radio in late 2008, promoted by Associação Encontrar-se. Samples by Vitorino and the Cape Verdean singer Ildo Lobo are used in the album. The video of the single _Estou Vivo_ was recorded in Macau.

The album was recorded in Lisbon, Rio de Janeiro and New York City.[1]
