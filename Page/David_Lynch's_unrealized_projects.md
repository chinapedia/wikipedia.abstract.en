The following IS A LIST OF UNPRODUCED DAVID LYNCH PROJECTS in roughly chronological order. During his long career, American film director David Lynch has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects fell into development hell or were officially cancelled.


1970s

_Gardenback_

Before starting work on _Eraserhead_, he worked on a script titled _Gardenback_, based on his painting of a hunched figure with vegetation growing from its back. _Gardenback_ was a surrealist script about adultery, featuring a continually growing insect that represented one man's lust for his neighbor. He presented the script to the AFI, but they rejected it as they felt the planned 45-minute runtime was too long for such a figurative, nonlinear script.

_Ronnie Rocket_

After the success of _Eraserhead_,[1] Lynch decided to focus on the screenplay of his second film, entitled _Ronnie Rocket_, which he also wanted to direct. The film's plot would have told the story of a detective seeking to enter a mysterious second dimension, aided by his ability to stand on one leg. He is being obstructed on this quest by a strange landscape of odd rooms and a threatening train; while being stalked by the "Donut Men", who wield electricity as a weapon. In addition to the detective's story, the film was to show the tale of Ronald d'Arte, a teenage dwarf, who suffers a surgical mishap which leaves him dependent on being plugged into an electrical supply at regular intervals; this dependence grants him an affinity over electricity which he can use to produce music or cause destruction. The boy names himself Ronnie Rocket and becomes a rock star, befriending a tap-dancer named Electra-Cute. Michael J. Anderson and Dexter Fletcher were attached to the lead role at different times.[2] However, the project never materialized due to financial conflicts,[3] so Lynch left the production and decided to direct _The Elephant Man_ instead. Also, Anderson finally worked with Lynch in _Twin Peaks_.


1980s

_Venus Descending_

In 1987, after the success of _Blue Velvet_, Lynch was hired by a Warner Bros. executive to direct a film based on the life of famous actress Marilyn Monroe, based on the best-selling book _Goddess_. He co-wrote the script with writer Mark Frost, the first of many collaborations for the two. The film would have revolved around the last few months of life of Monroe (named Rosilyn Ramsay for legal reasons), before her supposed assassination at hands of Bobby Kennedy (renamed Phillip Malloy). However, one of the project's producers decided to drop it, and Lynch decided to focus on _One Saliva Bubble_.[4]

_One Saliva Bubble_

On May 20, 1987, Lynch and Mark Frost finished their script for a film project entitled _One Saliva Bubble_.[5] The film's plot centered around the small town of Newtonville, KS, where a secret government project goes amok. The result is an exchange of identities of several of the townsfolk. Steve Martin was attached to star in the lead role, although Martin Short was also rumored to take that part. In the chapter 'Marty Throws A Party Just To Sing' of his 2014 autobiography, I Must Say: My Life as a Humble Comedy Legend, Martin Short states, "We bought the house on the basis of the income I was about to make from two pending movies. You can guess what happened next. Practically the second we signed the mortgage, one of the two movies, a David Lynch film with Steve Martin entitled, 'One Saliva Bubble', fell through." [6] However, the film never came to fruition for unknown reasons,[7] so Lynch left the project to focus on _Northwest Passage_ (which would later become _Twin Peaks_).


1990s

Untitled _Twin Peaks_ spin-off

During the filming of _Twin Peaks_ around the 1990s, Lynch considered at one point to release a spin-off film of the series film _Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me_ centered around the character Audrey Horne. Actress Sherilyn Fenn was attached to reprise her role. While the project was not ultimately made, elements of the planned story later inspired Lynch's film _Mulholland Drive_.[8]

_Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me_ sequel

Before the release of _Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me_, Lynch planned to release a sequel to the film for being a continuation of the series after its cancellation. He also planned a third film. However, these plans were scrapped after the bad reception of _Fire Walk with Me_.[9]

_Dream of the Bovine_

Around 1994, Lynch and _Twin Peaks_ writer Robert Engels co-wrote a script entitled _Dream of the Bovine_. Engels described the script as being about "three guys, who used to be cows, living in Van Nuys and trying to assimilate their lives.‚Äù Harry Dean Stanton was attached to star and he and Lynch tried to convince Marlon Brando to co-star, but Brando was not interested, calling the script "pretentious bullshit".[10]

_Mulholland Drive_ television series

In 1998, Lynch conceived the idea to make a TV series entitled _Mulholland Drive_. The project started as a 90-minute pilot produced by Touchstone Television and intended to be picked by the ABC network. However, during the filming of the pilot, ABC decided to not pick up the series.[11] However, Lynch reworked the pilot as a feature film, which was released in 2001.

_Woodcutters From Fiery Ships_

In 1998, Synergy Interactive, a Japanese video game production company, announced that they were developing a computer game entitled _Woodcutters From Fiery Ships_, designed primarily by Lynch. Lynch was impressed with their earlier game _Gadget: Invention, Travel, & Adventure_, which he said "delivered an immersive experience to the user". Lynch described the plot of _Woodcutters_ as such: "Certain events have happened in a bungalow which is behind another in Los Angeles. And then suddenly the woodcutters arrive and they take the man who we think has witnessed these events, and their ship is... uh, silver, like a 30`s kind of ship, and the fuel is logs. And they smoke pipes." The game was cancelled in November of 1999, due to concerns that its "conundrum"-like story would be uninteresting to computer game players.[12]


2010s

_Antelope Don't Run No More_

In 2010, Lynch wrote his first film since _Inland Empire_, entitled _Antelope Don't Run No More_. The film is said to be set in Los Angeles and features "space aliens, talking animals, and a beleaguered musician named Pinky". Lynch was unable to secure financing for the project.[13]
