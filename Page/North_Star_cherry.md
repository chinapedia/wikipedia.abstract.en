The NORTH STAR CHERRY is a sour cherry tree.[1] A dwarf cultivar, it typically grows 8 to 10 feet tall.[2]

Developed by the University of Minnesota, (the "North Star State"),[3][4][5] it is self-pollinizing (meaning only one tree is necessary).[6] Cold-resistant, it is a heavy producer of mahogany-red, medium-sized fruit.[7] In recent years, it has become a popular cherry variety for yards and gardens, as well as home cooking.[8][9][10][11][12][13][14]
