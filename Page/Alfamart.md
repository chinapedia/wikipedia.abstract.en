PT SUMBER ALFARIA TRIJAYA TBK or ALFAMART () is a primarily franchised chain of convenience stores from Indonesia, with over 10,000 stores across Southeast Asia.[1][2] Their business started in December 1989 as a trading and distribution company in Jakarta by its president, Djoko Susanto.[3] Ten years later, Susanto ventured to a convenience store as Alfa Minimart with its first branch at Karawaci, Tangerang, Banten.


History

Djoko Susanto and his family establish a trading and distribution company that sells various products in Jakarta in 1989. The distribution company has its corporate share of 70% with PT HM. Sampoerna Tbk and the remaining 30% were to Susanto's PT Sigmantara Alfaindo.[4]

In 1989, Susanto ventured out into a convenience store business and branded it as Alfa Minimart. They open their first branch at Jalan Banyan Kingdom, Karawaci, Tangerang, Banten. In the span of six years, it grew to 1293 branches along Java. The name was later rebranded as Alfamart.

In 2006, PT HM. Sampoerna Tbk sold their shares to Susanto's PT Sigmantara Alfaindo. Susanto gained 60% of its shares while the 40% of its share was granted to their new shareholder, PT Mulia Prima Horizons.

By 2009, Alfamart joined the Indonesia Stock Exchange with around 3000 branches nationwide. Their business soon renamed as PT Sumber Alfaria Trijaya Tbk. Alfamart soon brought Lawson stores in Indonesia while expanding from being a convenience store chain, to supermarket stores as Alfamidi Mini Supermarkets.[5][6][7][8]

In 2014, Alfamart has 7000 branches in Indonesia with an average of 2.5 million customers daily.[9] With success they grew in Indonesia, Alfamart ventured overseas and started to its neighboring country, Philippines. Their entry to the Philippines was a partnership with SM Investments Corporation with their first branch at Trece Martires, Cavite.[10][11][12] By 2020, Alfamart in the Philippines would start expansion along Visayas and Mindanao areas, particularly in Cebu, Davao, Cagayan De Oro and Zamboanga areas.[13][14]
