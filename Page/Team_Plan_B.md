TEAM PLAN B is the only Canadian entry in the Google Lunar XPRIZE, a $30 million competition to land a spacecraft on the Moon, travel 500 metres and transmit high definition video back to earth before the contest deadline of December 2017. Team Plan B aims to be the First Privately Funded Canadian Mission to the Moon.

The Google Lunar XPRIZE entry was first submitted by current team CTO Alex Dobrianski in early 2011 right before the last days of the entry deadline.


First 3D Printing on the Moon

Team Plan B has developed a procedure for the first use of 3D printing using Lunar Soil. The Team Plan B vision is to develop lunar 3D printing rapid manufacturing of metallurgy, parts and components, fuel composition or whatever the human mind can conceive to negate prohibitively expensive launch costs restrictive to earth launch payloads.
