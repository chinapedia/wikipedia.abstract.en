DAVID ROBERT BROOKS (born 8 July 1997) is a professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for club AFC Bournemouth and the Wales national team. He played for both Wales and England at youth level before making his senior debut for Wales in 2017. After a series of impressive performance for Sheffield United in the 2017–18 season, Brooks was recruited by Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe in the summer of 2018.


Club career

Brooks was associated with the Manchester City academy from the age of seven, before he switched to the Sheffield United academy in 2014 and signed professional forms with the club in March 2015.[1] He joined National League side F.C. Halifax Town on a one-month loan on 29 August 2015.[2] He had his loan extended into a second month and scored one goal, against Aldershot Town, in his five appearances.[3]

He made his first team debut for the "Blades" on 30 August 2016, coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute for Matt Done in a 0–0 draw with Leicester City U23's in an EFL Trophy group stage match at Bramall Lane.[4] He made his first start for the club in the next fixture in the competition, a 2–1 home defeat by Walsall on 4 October, following which manager Chris Wilder said that "I think it's difficult for a young player to impress when the players around him aren't performing".[5] Four days later, he was picked for the Wales team by Chris Coleman.

Brooks scored his first senior goal on 27 October 2017, scoring only six minutes after coming on as a substitute against Leeds United to seal the Blades a 2–1 victory in the Yorkshire Derby.

In October 2017, Brooks signed a new long term contract, committing his future to Bramall Lane until the summer of 2021.[6]

In July 2018, Brooks signed for AFC Bournemouth of the Premier League for a fee of £11.5 million,[7] signing a four-year contract, making his debut in the 2–0 home win against Cardiff City.[8]

In March 2019, Brooks signed a new "long-term" contract with the club.[9]


International career

Brooks was born in Warrington and was eligible for both his birth country England and for Wales – the latter through his mother, who is from Llangollen.[10]

On 15 May 2017, he was called up to the Wales U20 squad for the 2017 Toulon Tournament. He later withdrew from the Wales setup, instead being called up to the England U20 squad for the same tournament.[11] England won the tournament and Brooks was given the Best Player award, having scored in the Final.[12]

On 25 August 2017, he was then called up to the Wales U21 squad for the European Championship qualifiers against Switzerland and Portugal.[13] He made his debut for the side on 1 September 2017 in a 3–0 victory over Switzerland, scoring the second goal of the match.[14]

On 28 September 2017, he was called up to the Wales senior squad, for two World Cup Qualifiers against Georgia and Ireland.[15] Brooks made his senior debut for Wales on 10 November 2017, coming on as a substitute in a 2–0 defeat against France.[16]

Brooks scored his first goal for Wales in a 2–1 away defeat to Croatia, after coming on as a substitute.[17]
