The PAX HUNGARICA MOVEMENT (; PHM) was a far-right Hungarist and neo-Nazi movement, founded on 26 January 2008 to represent an alternative against the Hungarian National Front (MNA). Its predecessor organization was the Blood and Honour Cultural Association.[1]

The leadership of the organization decided to abolish the movement on 31 July 2017 due to large-scale withdrawal of members in the previous years.[2]
