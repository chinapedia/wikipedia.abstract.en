GRAVE DISABILITY or GRAVELY DISABLED is a legal status used as a criteria in addition to danger to self or others [1] as the basis for involuntary commitment [2] in only 9 of 50 states of the United States. [3] It is not a criteria in Washington, D.C..

In California,[4] it is defined as "a condition in which a person, as a result of a mental health disorder," ...(or impairment by chronic alcoholism)..., "is unable to provide for his or her basic personal needs for food, clothing, or shelter." [5] [6]

Some states such as Louisiana also include substance-related or addictive disorders and add medical care to needs. [7]

It may also be used in certain defined violent felony cases for mental incompetence.[8]
