_NEW YORK-BARCELONA CROSSING, VOLUMEN 1_ is an album by jazz pianist Brad Mehldau, with Perico Sambeat (alto sax), Mario Rossy (bass) and Jorge Rossy (drums).


Music and recording

The album was recorded in concert at the Jamboree Club in Barcelona[1] on May 10, 1993.[2] The material is mostly jazz standards and pieces from the Great American Songbook.[3]


Release and reception

It was released by Fresh Sound New Talent, after the Mehldau–Rossy album _When I Fall in Love_.[4] _The Penguin Guide to Jazz_ commented that Mehldau's "introduction and improvisation on 'Old Folks' are quite breathtaking and it's clear that the pristine touch of the later discs was already in place."[5]
