Synopsis

Gong Ming (Jing Boran) is an imperial scholar official and his family's sole survivor after they were massacred in a conspiracy. He is an avid supporter of the reinstatement of Empress Xu, who was deposed due to scheming by royal concubine Zhao Feiyan.

While he was being persecuted, he accidentally time-travels two thousand years into the present due to a mysterious jade pendant. He meets and falls in love with actress Lin Xiangxiang (Zheng Shuang), who landed a role as Empress Xu in a historical drama. However, for the greater good, Gong Ming was insistent on heading back into the past to save the deposed queen. He finds out that he could not return to the present where Xiang Xiang is.

The music, editing and artistic direction of the series was also done by the Korean production team of _Queen and I_.

Unlike other typical Chinese television series, _Love Weaves Through a Millennium_ was not pre-produced before its premiere. It was filmed based on a live-shooting format. The script was amended based on audience's responses, including the drama's ending. No dubbing was used; instead, the actors' actual voices were heard in the drama.

Actual Chinese history was adapted into the new script, such as the rivalry between Zhao Feiyan and Empress Xu.
