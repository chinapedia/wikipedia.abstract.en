The QUAI DES CÉLESTINS runs along the Seine in Paris' 4th arrondissement. The quay, or dock, runs into the quai Henri-IV upstream, and downstream becomes the quai de l'Hôtel-de-Ville.


History

Quai_des_Célestins,_Paris_1981_002.jpg The quay was named after the couvent des Célestins,[1] located at the current site of the Caserne des Célestins of the Garde républicaine.[2]

The main entrance to the Hôtel Saint-Pol, also vanished now, was on the quai des Célestins.[3]

The quay was rebuilt and paved in 1705.[4]


Notable locations

-   At the level of the boulevard Henri-IV is the square Henri-Galli, notable for the remains of one of the eight towers of the Bastille prison.
-   2 et 2bis: Hôtel Fieubet ou La Vallette, situated at the location of the royal hôtel Saint-Pol, granted in 1519 by François I^(er). In 1587, Raymond Phélypeaux d’Herbault built a first hôtel there. In 1676, it was acquired by the chancellor of queen Marie-Thérèse d'Espagne, Gaspard Fieubet. Fieubet had it renovated and decorated by Le Sueur and Vicotte according to the plans of Jules Hardouin-Mansart. In 1816, the hôtel became a sugar refinery. In 1857, the count of Lavalette acquired it and had it transformed by Jules Gros in a neo-baroque Italo-Spanish style, especially the street-side and court-side façades. Since 1877, this has been the location of the école Massillon.[5]
