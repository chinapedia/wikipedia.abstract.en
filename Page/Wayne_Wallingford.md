Political views and accomplishments

Education

Wallingford is a member of Governor Mike Parson's commission on workforce development.[3]

Families and children

In 2016 and 2017, Wallingford proposed legislation to established a rebuttable presumption of shared parenting after divorce,[4][5] which scientific research has shown to be in the best interest of children as long as there are exceptions for child abuse and neglect.[6][7] Wallingford stated that _most fatherlessness is not caused by abandonment; it’s created by an outdated court system_, and that _kids need both parents, and this is in the best interest of the child_.[8] Neither bill was voted on, but in 2018 a similar bill by representative Kathryn Swan passed the House on a 137-7 vote as well as the Senate's _Seniors, Families and Children Committee_, although it was subsequently filibustered by senator Jill Schupp from suburban St. Louis.[9][10] In 2019, Wallingford reintroduced a similar bill (SB.14). After passing the Seniors, Families and Children Committee, it is waiting to be voted on by the full senate.[11]

Transportation

Wallingford has sponsored legislation to ban texting while driving in Missouri.[12]
