SEAN and SHAWN were the pen-names of JOHN KLAMIK (July 22, 1935 – January 5, 2005), an American artist specializing in gay male erotica and comics.[1] His homosexual-themed cartoons were among the first to appear in US publications, including a regular feature in the early years of _The Advocate_. He worked under two pen-names: _Shawn_ for more mainstream gay publications such as _In Touch_,[2] and _Sean_ for fetish publications such as _Drummer_ and _Bound & Gagged_.[3]


Career

Klamik was born on July 22, 1935 in Chicago, and studied at the Art Institute.[4] He moved to West Hollywood, California in the mid 1960s,[5] where he worked in an art factory producing paintings for hotel rooms,[6] and as Display Director for the Akron stores.[7]

His first erotic work was "published" in 1963, by taking photographs of the illustrations and making prints in home darkrooms.[8] In 1965, he began doing editorial and gag comics for _The Advocate_, and in the late 1960s did a half-page series under the title "Gayer Than Strange".[9]

In the 1970s he did both softcore and hardcore illustrations for erotic novels and collections of short stories published by Larry Townsend, and his _Leatherman’s Handbook_.[10] In the mid 1970s he created stand-alone wordless hardcore comics _Biff_ and _Biff Bound_ for San Francisco publisher Le Salon, which featured centerfolds with 10 and 15 men having sex, respectively.[11] During this time he produced eighteen 10-page comics stories for hardcore photo-story magazines published by Nova Studios, which were reprinted in _Meatmen_.[12] In the 1980s he also did art direction for some of Nova's porn films and videos. In the late 1980s he produced "Up the Block", a humor comic strip set in a gay neighborhood, for _Frontiers_. He produced 27 installments of "Jake", a 4-page series for _Jock_ magazine; over 20 episodes of "Dick Darling, Hollywood Cover Boy", a 2- or 4-page strip for a twink-themed porn magazine; and 7 episodes of "Johnny Guitar" for another magazine.[13]

At the end of the 1980s, he moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and continued to work with California publishers by mail.[14]


Personal life

In 1965 Klamik began a relationship with Jim Newberry; they remained companions until Klamik's death from lung cancer[15] in 2005.[16]
