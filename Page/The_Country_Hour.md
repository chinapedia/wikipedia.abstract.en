_THE COUNTRY HOUR_ is Australia's longest running radio program, established in 1945. The program is currently broadcast on all regional ABC Local Radio stations from midday to 1pm each weekday, presenting news from rural and regional Australia, with a heavy focus on the agricultural industry.


Programming

The program features live interviews and stories that are compiled by the ABC's rural reporters who are based at each regional station. _National Rural News_, a national five-minute rural news bulletin is broadcast on _The Country Hour_ at 12:06pm. General national news headlines are broadcast at 12:30pm followed by a weather update. Market reports are delivered by designated correspondents just prior to the conclusion of the program at 1:00pm.

There are currently seven separate local editions of _The Country Hour_ that are broadcast to each Australian state and territory, with the exception of the Australian Capital Territory. While the program is not aired on metropolitan ABC stations, but is streamed on their corresponding stations on the ABC Radio app.

Due to _The Country Hour_ being aired at noon on regional ABC stations, the national current affairs program _The World Today_ is aired on a one-hour delay in regional areas, whereas it is broadcast at midday on ABC stations in the capital cities.


History

The concept of _The Country Hour_ arose during World War II when research indicated educational content on radio had the potential to increase productivity for the war efforts, particularly in the agriculture sector.[1] John Douglass, an agricultural scientist with some international radio experience, convinced ABC management to establish a specialist rural department. The ABC agreed and Douglass was subsequently appointed to lead the new department as "Federal Director of Rural Broadcasts".[2][3] After recruiting some former ABC announcers to work on the program, it debuted on 3 December 1945 with presenter Dick Snedden welcoming listeners to "a program for the farm families of Australia".[4] The program was officially opened by Federal Minister for Agriculture William Scully.

Stories that had been planned for the first few weeks of _The Country Hour_ included coverage of stock sales at Homebush; an interview with a Pheasant enthusiast; an educational piece about a poultry factory; and an account of haymaking at Hawkesbury Agricultural College.[5]

The format of _The Country Hour_ was strategically planned to ensure the program rated as highly as possible. Airing from 12:15pm until 1:15pm, Douglass had programmed the show around a national news bulletin at 12:30pm and ensured the program was book-ended with a radio serial such as _The Lawsons_ or _Blue Hills_. Such radio serials were generally popular with women, but Douglass had some input into what script-writer Gwen Meredith included in her work, to make the serials more relevant to _The Country Hour_'s audience. This resulted in the inclusion of relevant and accurate farming references in serial's such as _Blue Hills_.[6]

By the 1950s, the ABC had begun placing rural reporters at their regional stations so more locally-relevant stories could be presented to rural audiences, and enabling local state editions of _The Country Hour_. In 1951, the Victorian edition of _The Country Hour_ broke the news of the decision to introduce the Myxoma virus into Australia in a bid to control the wild rabbit population, after Ian Clunies Ross told rural reporter Graham White about the plan.[7]

70th Anniversary

In 2015, _The Country Hour_ celebrated its 70th anniversary, prompting tributes from well-known figures and a mention in the Parliament of Australia when Western Australian Senator Dean Smith reflected on the rural issues and events that had been covered by _The Country Hour_ particularly in Western Australia.[8]

A special national edition of _The Country Hour_ was broadcast on 3 December 2015, the 70th anniversary of the program's debut.[9]

ABC Rural's television program, _Landline_ also focused on the history of _The Country Hour_ during a special episode reflecting on 70 years of ABC Rural, which effectively commenced with the debut of _The Country Hour_ in 1945.[10]
