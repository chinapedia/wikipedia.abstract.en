_Macleania insignis_, family Ericaceae is a member of the blueberry family—its most common ancestors in North America include blueberries and cranberries.[1] The family Ericaceae is spread across the world, with a large concentration found in South America. This plant falls within the Neotropical subgroup and then Andean clade of this family.[2] The Psammisia II section shares the closest common ancestor to this plant, and its closest split on a family tree is shared with _Macleania coccoloboides_ and M_acleania bullata_. Phylogenic classification of _M. insignis_ has primarily been carried out through an examination of morphological traits as well as genetic analysis.[3] _Macleania_ is an angiosperm eudicot, in the order of Ericales and the family Ericaceae.


Description

_Macleania insignis_ displays 3 cm tubular red orange flowers and dense shiny oval leaves. It can grow in a cloud forest (as an epiphyte) and as a terrestrial plant. The plant can spread out over several feet, and its roots form large, woody tubers that partially emerge above the soil surface in terrestrial plants. Macleania produces an edible fruit that is purple and lightly sweet.[4][5]


In the wild

In a natural setting plants within the _Macleania_ clade are pollinated by hummingbirds. The ability of a plant to attract a pollinator impacts its level of reproductive success.[6] Macleania are found in regions of cloud forest in Central and South America, specifically Mexico, Costa Rica, and Colombia.


Cultivation

_Macleania insignis_ is considered to be a desirable and attractive greenhouse plant, it can be found for sale but is rare. _M. insignis_ prefers moderate greenhouse conditions and partial shade [7]
