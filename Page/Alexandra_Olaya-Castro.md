ALEXANDRA OLAYA-CASTRO is a Colombian theoretical physicist, currently a Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University College London. She is also the Vice-Dean (Equality, Diversity and Inclusion) for the Mathematical and Physical science Faculty.[1]

She is known for her work on quantum physics on biomolecular processes, specifically for her research on quantum effects in photosynthesis.[2] She was the recipient of the Maxwell Medal in 2016 _"for her contributions to the theory of quantum effects in bio-molecular systems"_.[3]


Early life and education

Olaya-Castro did an undergraduate in Physics Education at Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas and later obtained a Master of Science in Physics at Universidad de Los Andes in 2002. She then immigrated to the UK to purse a doctorate in physics in the department of physics at the University of Oxford, where she obtained her DPhil in Physics with her thesis titled “Quantum correlations in multi-qubit-cavity systems” supervised by Neil F. Johnson.


Teaching

Olaya-Castro teaches the 4th-year course in Advanced Quantum Theory attended by intercollegiate students from University College London, Kings College London, Queen Mary University of London and Royal Holloway.[4]


Public engagement

In 2015, she delivered a public talk at the Royal Institution which is available as a podcast.1

Olaya-Castro’s research was showcased at the 2016 Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition.[5]

In 2016 Olaya-Castro delivered a TEDx talk advocating for breaking socioeconomic and gender stereotypes through exploring what she calls the option B, the talk in spanish is found here: El poder de la opción B para romper estereotipos.


Awards and Honours

In 2003, she was awarded the Arthur H Cooke Memorial Prize for distinguished work by a first year student, Department of Physics, University of Oxford.[6]

In 2005, she won a Junior Research Fellowship at Trinity College, University of Oxford.

In 2008, she was awarded an EPSRC Career acceleration fellowship to pursue independent research.[7][8]

In 2016, she was awarded the Maxwell Medal and Prize.


Personal life

Olaya-Castro is the mother of two children.[9]
