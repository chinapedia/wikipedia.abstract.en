_GURPS SUPERS_ is a superhero roleplaying game written by Loyd Blankenship and published by Steve Jackson Games. The first edition was published in 1989.


Contents

_GURPS Supers_ is a supplement of rules for comic-book superhero characters and campaigns for _GURPS_. The first edition book includes new combat rules, 24 superpowers, bionic superlimbs, gadgets and equipment, and rules for creating new powers, sample heroes and villains, and a briefly described campaign world.[1] The second edition book is revised and corrected.[2]

_GURPS Supers_ deals with super-powered characters in a modern-day setting, and contains all the necessary rules to create superheroes for the _GURPS_ basic system.[3] The book also contains suggestions for running a superhero campaign, and a detailed background setting with the UN controlling most superheroes.[4]


Setting

The official "house setting" for _GURPS Supers_ is the "IST World", described briefly in chapter 7 of _GURPS Supers_ and later appearing in its own full-length supplement, _GURPS International Super Teams_.


System

_GURPS Supers_ is a supplement for the GURPS roleplaying game and uses that basic rule system. The supplement offers additional rules and options for characters with superpowers.

Players can choose from several different basic types of superhero characters that influence how the character's powers are selected. Players can select from a wide variety of powers and their modifications given in _GURPS Supers_, augmented by those in the _GURPS Basic_, plus any other GURPS book included by the campaign. The rules book included advice on creating superhero campaigns, and ways for the game master to customize the style of the campaign.

As part of the GURPS system, _GURPS Supers_ allows the exchange of a player's characters between any of the numerous other genres supported by GURPS. _GURPS Supers_ favors lower-powered heroes over higher-powered ones. Many of the superpowers unique to _GURPS Supers_ appear as Advantages and Disadvantages in the GURPS 4e Basic Set.


History

_GURPS Supers_ was written by Loyd Blankenship, with a cover by Alan Gutierrez and Charlie Weidman, and was first published by Steve Jackson Games in 1988 as a 112-page book.[5] _GURPS Space_ was one of the broad genre books that followed the publication of the _GURPS Basic Set_.[6]

The 2nd edition of _GURPS Supers_ was published in 1990 and featured a cover by John Zeleznik.[7]

4th Edition

_GURPS Supers_ for 4e was published in 2007, one of several genre books published by Steve Jackson Games for the new edition.[8]

For the 4th edition of GURPS, the majority of rules governing the creation of superhero characters are covered in the more generic _GURPS Powers_.[9] A PDF release by William H. Stoddard covers the genre specific information in a similar style to _GURPS Fantasy_ and _GURPS Space_ books for the fourth edition of GURPS.[10]


Reception

Rick Swan reviewed the second edition of _GURPS Supers_ for _Dragon_ magazine #233 (September 1996).[11] Comparing it to the _Champions_ RPG, Swan comments that "_GURPS Super_ takes a more realistic route, stressing personality over punch-outs. That's not to say it's stodgy; a typical chapter is titled "Unnatural Multiple Limbs from Another World." The Second Edition streamlines the occasionally awkward mechanics of the First Edition and adds some nifty new powers."[12]

Steve Faragher reviewed the second edition of _GURPS Supers_ for _Arcane_ magazine, rating it a 6 out of 10 overall.[13] He calls the background setting "rather dull", saying it is "fine if you want to recreate a Saturday afternoon TV show, but not so great for a more fantastic, underground campaign of the _Watchmen_ variety".[14] Faragher concludes that "it's a competent enough set of rules - and one that's well presented - but _GURPS Supers_ is not exactly compulsive playing material".[15]
