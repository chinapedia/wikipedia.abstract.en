Payment controversy

Three months after the end of _Night Light_, the TV Chosun subsidiary C-Story, one of its producers, was accused of not duly compensating the actors of the drama. When sought for comment, the company's management said that it was "confused by the reports and that while payments have been delayed, they have been communicating with all of the as-yet-unpaid actors".[17]
