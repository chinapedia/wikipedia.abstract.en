SIR THOMAS SEAN CONNERY (born 25 August 1930) is a retired Scottish actor and producer, who has won an Academy Award, two BAFTA Awards, one being a BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award, and three Golden Globes, including the Cecil B. DeMille Award and a Henrietta Award.

Connery was the first actor to portray the character James Bond in film, starring in seven Bond films (every film from _Dr. No_ to _You Only Live Twice_, plus _Diamonds Are Forever_ and _Never Say Never Again_), between 1962 and 1983.[1] In 1988, Connery won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in _The Untouchables_. His films also include _Marnie_ (1964), _Murder on the Orient Express_ (1974), _The Man Who Would Be King_ (1975), _The Name of the Rose_ (1986), _Highlander_ (1986), _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_ (1989), _The Hunt for Red October_ (1990), _Dragonheart_ (1996), _The Rock_ (1996), and _Finding Forrester_ (2000).

Connery has been polled in _The Sunday Herald_ as "The Greatest Living Scot"[2] and in a EuroMillions survey as "Scotland's Greatest Living National Treasure".[3] He was voted by _People_ magazine as both the “Sexiest Man Alive” in 1989 and the “Sexiest Man of the Century” in 1999.[4] Connery was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours for services to film drama.[5]


Early life

Sean_Connery_plaque,_Fountainbridge_Edinburgh.jpg, Edinburgh]] Thomas Sean Connery, named Thomas after his grandfather, was born in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland on 25 August 1930.[6] His mother, Euphemia "Effie" McBain McLean, was a cleaning woman. She was born the daughter of Neil McLean and Helen Forbes Ross, and named after her father's mother 'Euphemia McBain', wife of John McLean and daughter of William McBain from Ceres in Fife.[7][8][9] Connery's father, Joseph Connery, was a factory worker and lorry driver.[10][11] His paternal grandfather's parents emigrated to Scotland from Ireland in the mid-19th century. The remainder of his family was of Scottish descent, and his maternal great-grandparents were native Scottish Gaelic speakers from Fife (unusually, for a speaker of the language), and Uig on Skye.[12][13] His father was a Roman Catholic, and his mother was a Protestant. He has a younger brother, Neil. Connery has said that he was called Sean, his middle name, long before becoming an actor, explaining that when he was young he had an Irish friend named Séamus and that those who knew them both had decided to call Connery by his middle name whenever both were present. He was generally referred to in his youth as "Tommy". Although he was small in primary school, he grew rapidly around the age of 12, reaching his full adult height of at 18. He was known during his teen years as "Big Tam", and has stated that he lost his virginity to an adult woman in an ATS uniform at the age of 14. St._Cuthbert's_"Co-op_milk_cart",_Edinburgh_(1981).JPG Connery's first job was as a milkman in Edinburgh with St. Cuthbert's Co-operative Society.[14] In 2009, Connery recalled a conversation in a taxi:

Connery then joined the Royal Navy, during which time he acquired two tattoos, of which his official website says "unlike many tattoos, his were not frivolous—his tattoos reflect two of his lifelong commitments: his family and Scotland. ... One tattoo is a tribute to his parents and reads 'Mum and Dad,' and the other is self-explanatory, 'Scotland Forever.'"[15]

Connery was later discharged from the navy on medical grounds because of a duodenal ulcer, a condition that affected most of the males in previous generations of his family. Afterwards, he returned to the co-op, then worked as, among other things, a lorry driver, a lifeguard at Portobello swimming baths, a labourer, an artist's model for the Edinburgh College of Art, and after a suggestion by former Mr. Scotland, Archie Brennan,[16] a coffin polisher. The modelling earned him 15 shillings an hour. Artist Richard Demarco, at the time a student who painted several early pictures of Connery, described him as "very straight, slightly shy, too, too beautiful for words, a virtual Adonis".

Connery began bodybuilding at the age of 18, and from 1951 trained heavily with Ellington, a former gym instructor in the British army. While his official website claims he was third in the 1950 Mr. Universe contest, most sources place him in the 1953 competition, either third in the Junior class[17] or failing to place in the Tall Man classification.[18] Connery stated that he was soon deterred from bodybuilding when he found that the Americans frequently beat him in competitions because of sheer muscle size and, unlike Connery, refused to participate in athletic activity which could make them lose muscle mass.

Connery was a keen footballer, having played for Bonnyrigg Rose in his younger days.[19] He was offered a trial with East Fife. While on tour with _South Pacific_, Connery played in a football match against a local team that Matt Busby, manager of Manchester United, happened to be scouting.[20] According to reports, Busby was impressed with his physical prowess and offered Connery a contract worth £25 a week () immediately after the game. Connery admits that he was tempted to accept, but he recalls, "I realised that a top-class footballer could be over the hill by the age of 30, and I was already 23. I decided to become an actor and it turned out to be one of my more intelligent moves."[21]


Career

1950s

Looking to pick up some extra money, Connery helped out backstage at the King's Theatre in late 1951.[22] He became interested in the proceedings, and a career was launched. During a bodybuilding competition held in London in 1953, one of the competitors mentioned that auditions were being held for a production of _South Pacific_,[23] and Connery landed a small part as one of the Seabees chorus boys. By the time the production reached Edinburgh, he had been given the part of Marine Cpl Hamilton Steeves and was understudying two of the juvenile leads, and his salary was raised from £12 to £14–10s a week. The production returned the following year out of popular demand, and Connery was promoted to the featured role of Lieutenant Buzz Adams, which Larry Hagman had portrayed in the West End.

While in Edinburgh, Connery was targeted by the Valdor gang, one of the most violent in the city. He was first approached by them in a billiard hall where he prevented them from stealing his jacket and was later followed by six gang members to a 15-foot-high balcony at the Palais. There Connery launched an attack singlehandedly against the gang members, grabbing one by the throat and another by a biceps and cracked their heads together. From then on he was treated with great respect by the gang and gained a reputation as a "hard man".

Connery first met Michael Caine at a party during the production of _South Pacific_ in 1954, and the two later became close friends. During the production of _South Pacific_ at the Opera House, Manchester over the Christmas period of 1954, Connery developed a serious interest in the theatre through American actor Robert Henderson who lent him copies of the Henrik Ibsen works _Hedda Gabler_, _The Wild Duck_, and _When We Dead Awaken_, and later listed works by the likes of Marcel Proust, Leo Tolstoy, Ivan Turgenev, George Bernard Shaw, James Joyce and William Shakespeare for him to digest. Henderson urged him to take elocution lessons and got him parts at the Maida Vale Theatre in London. He had already begun a film career, having been an extra in Herbert Wilcox's 1954 musical _Lilacs in the Spring_ alongside Anna Neagle.

Although Connery had secured several roles as extras, he was struggling to make ends meet, and was forced to accept a part-time job as a babysitter for journalist Peter Noble and his actress wife Mary, which earned him 10 shillings a night. He met Hollywood actress Shelley Winters one night at Noble's house, who described Connery as "one of the tallest and most charming and masculine Scotsmen" she'd ever seen, and later spent many evenings with the Connery brothers drinking beer. Around this time Connery was residing at TV presenter Llew Gardner's house. Henderson landed Connery a role in a £6 a week Q Theatre production of Agatha Christie's _Witness for the Prosecution_, during which he met and became friends with fellow-Scot Ian Bannen. This role was followed by _Point of Departure_ and _A Witch in Time_ at Kew, a role as Pentheus opposite Yvonne Mitchell in _The Bacchae_ at the Oxford Playhouse, and a role opposite Jill Bennett in Eugene O'Neill's production of _Anna Christie_.

During his time at the Oxford Theatre, Connery won a brief part as a boxer in the TV series _The Square Ring_, before being spotted by Canadian director Alvin Rakoff, who gave him multiple roles in _The Condemned_, shot on location in Dover in Kent. In 1956, Connery appeared in the theatrical production of _Epitaph_, and played a minor role as a hoodlum in the "Ladies of the Manor" episode of the BBC Television police series _Dixon of Dock Green_. This was followed by small television parts in _Sailor of Fortune_ and _The Jack Benny Program_.

In early 1957, Connery hired agent Richard Hatton who got him his first film role, as Spike, a minor gangster with a speech impediment in Montgomery Tully's _No Road Back_ alongside Skip Homeier, Paul Carpenter, Patricia Dainton and Norman Wooland. In April 1957, Rakoff—after being disappointed by Jack Palance—decided to give the young actor his first chance in a leading role, and cast Connery as Mountain McLintock in BBC Television's production of _Requiem For a Heavyweight_, which also starred Warren Mitchell and Jacqueline Hill. He then played a rogue lorry driver, Johnny Yates, in Cy Endfield's _Hell Drivers_ (1957) alongside Stanley Baker, Herbert Lom, Peggy Cummins and Patrick McGoohan.[24] Later in 1957, Connery appeared in Terence Young's poorly received MGM action picture _Action of the Tiger_ opposite Van Johnson, Martine Carol, Herbert Lom and Gustavo Rojo; the film was shot on location in southern Spain.[25][26] He also had a minor role in Gerald Thomas's thriller _Time Lock_ (1957) as a welder, appearing alongside Robert Beatty, Lee Patterson, Betty McDowall and Vincent Winter; this commenced filming on 1 December 1956 at Beaconsfield Studios.[27]

Connery had a major role in the melodrama _Another Time, Another Place_ (1958) as a British reporter named Mark Trevor, caught in a love affair opposite Lana Turner and Barry Sullivan. During filming, star Turner's possessive gangster boyfriend, Johnny Stompanato, who was visiting from Los Angeles, believed she was having an affair with Connery.[28] Connery and Turner had attended West End shows and London restaurants together.[29] Stompanato stormed onto the film set and pointed a gun at Connery, only to have Connery disarm him and knock him flat on his back. Stompanato was banned from the set.[30] Two Scotland Yard detectives advised Stompanato to leave and escorted him to the airport, where he boarded a plane back to the US.[31] Connery later recounted that he had to lie low for a while after receiving threats from men linked to Stompanato's boss, Mickey Cohen.[32]

In 1959, Connery landed a leading role in Robert Stevenson's Walt Disney Productions film _Darby O'Gill and the Little People_ (1959) alongside Albert Sharpe, Janet Munro, and Jimmy O'Dea. The film is a tale about a wily Irishman and his battle of wits with leprechauns. Upon the film's initial release, A. H. Weiler of _The New York Times_ praised the cast (save Connery whom he described as "merely tall, dark, and handsome") and thought the film an "overpoweringly charming concoction of standard Gaelic tall stories, fantasy and romance."[33] In his book _The Disney Films_, film critic and historian Leonard Maltin stated that, "_Darby O'Gill and the Little People_ is not only one of Disney's best films, but is certainly one of the best fantasies ever put on film."[34] He also had prominent television roles in Rudolph Cartier's 1961 productions of _Adventure Story_ and _Anna Karenina_ for BBC Television, in the latter of which he co-starred with Claire Bloom.[35]

James Bond: 1962–1971, 1983

Sean_Connery_1971_(cropped).jpg Connery's breakthrough came in the role of British secret agent James Bond. He was reluctant to commit to a film series, but understood that if the films succeeded, his career would greatly benefit.[36] He played 007 in the first five Bond films: _Dr. No_ (1962), _From Russia with Love_ (1963), _Goldfinger_ (1964), _Thunderball_ (1965), and _You Only Live Twice_ (1967) – then appeared again as Bond in _Diamonds Are Forever_ (1971) and _Never Say Never Again_ (1983). All seven films were commercially successful. James Bond, as portrayed by Connery, was selected as the third-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute.[37]

Connery's selection for the role of James Bond owed a lot to Dana Broccoli, wife of producer Albert "Cubby" Broccoli, who is reputed to have been instrumental in persuading her husband that Sean Connery was the right man.[38] James Bond's creator, Ian Fleming, originally doubted Connery's casting, saying, "He's not what I envisioned of James Bond looks", and "I'm looking for Commander Bond and not an overgrown stunt-man", adding that Connery (muscular, 6' 2", and a Scot) was unrefined.[39] Fleming's girlfriend Blanche Blackwell told him that Connery had the requisite sexual charisma, and Fleming changed his mind after the successful _Dr. No_ première. He was so impressed, he wrote Connery's heritage into the character. In his 1964 novel _You Only Live Twice_, Fleming wrote that Bond's father was Scottish and was from Glencoe.[40] Impronte_di_Sean_Connery_al_TCL_Chinese_Theatre_-_Los_Angeles_-_USA_-_agosto_2011.jpg, Hollywood]] Connery's portrayal of Bond owes much to stylistic tutelage from director Terence Young, which helped polish the actor while using his physical grace and presence for the action. Lois Maxwell, who played Miss Moneypenny, related that "Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat."[41] The tutoring was successful; Connery received thousands of fan letters a week after _Dr. No’s_ opening, and the actor became a major male sex symbol in film.[42]

During the filming of _Thunderball_ in 1965, Connery's life was in danger in the sequence with the sharks in Emilio Largo's pool. He had been concerned about this threat when he read the script. Connery insisted that Ken Adam build a special Plexiglas partition inside the pool, but this was not a fixed structure, and one of the sharks managed to pass through it. He had to abandon the pool immediately.[43] In 2005, _From Russia with Love_ was adapted by Electronic Arts into a video game, titled _James Bond 007: From Russia with Love_, which featured all-new voice work by Connery, recorded by Terry Manning in the Bahamas, as well as his likeness, and those of several of the film's supporting cast.[44]

Beyond Bond

Sean_Connery_1964.png's _Marnie_ (1964)]] Although Bond had made him a star, Connery grew tired of the role and the pressure the franchise put on him, saying "[I am] fed up to here with the whole Bond bit"[45] and "I have always hated that damned James Bond. I'd like to kill him".[46] Michael Caine said of the situation, "If you were his friend in these early days you didn't raise the subject of Bond. He was, and is, a much better actor than just playing James Bond, but he became synonymous with Bond. He'd be walking down the street and people would say, "Look, there's James Bond." That was particularly upsetting to him." Hepburn_Connery_Robin_and_Marian_Still_1976.jpg and Connery in _Robin and Marian_ (1976)]] While making the Bond films, Connery also starred in other films such as Alfred Hitchcock's _Marnie_ (1964) and _The Hill_ (1965). Having played Bond six times, Connery's global popularity was such that he shared a Golden Globe Henrietta Award with Charles Bronson for "World Film Favorite – Male" in 1972.[47] He appeared in John Huston’s _The Man Who Would Be King_ (1975), starring opposite Michael Caine, with both actors regarding it as their favourite film.[48][49] The same year, he appeared in _The Wind and the Lion_, and in 1976 played Robin Hood in _Robin and Marian_ where he starred opposite Audrey Hepburn who played Maid Marian. Film critic Roger Ebert – who had praised the double act of Connery and Caine in _The Man Who Would Be King_ – praised Connery’s chemistry with Hepburn, writing, "Connery and Hepburn seem to have arrived at a tacit understanding between themselves about their characters. They glow. They really do seem in love."[50] In the 1970s Connery was part of ensemble casts in films such as _Murder on the Orient Express_ (1974) with Vanessa Redgrave and John Gielgud, and _A Bridge Too Far_ (1977) co-starring Dirk Bogarde and Laurence Olivier.

In 1981, Connery appeared in the film _Time Bandits_ as Agamemnon. The casting choice derives from a joke Michael Palin included in the script, in which he describes the character removing his mask as being "Sean Connery — or someone of equal but cheaper stature".[51] When shown the script, Connery was happy to play the supporting role. In 1982, Connery narrated _G'olé!_, the official film of the 1982 FIFA World Cup.[52]

SeanConnery88.jpg]] Connery agreed to reprise Bond as an ageing agent 007 in _Never Say Never Again_, released in October 1983. The title, contributed by his wife, refers to his earlier statement that he would "never again" play Bond. Although the film performed well at the box office, it was plagued with production problems: strife between the director and producer, financial problems, the Fleming estate trustees' attempts to halt the film, and Connery's wrist being broken by fight choreographer, Steven Seagal. As a result of his negative experiences during filming, Connery became unhappy with the major studios and did not make any films for two years. Following the successful European production _The Name of the Rose_ (1986), for which he won a BAFTA award, Connery's interest in more commercial material was revived. That same year, a supporting role in _Highlander_ showcased his ability to play older mentors to younger leads, which became a recurring role in many of his later films. The following year, his acclaimed performance as a hard-nosed Irish-American cop in _The Untouchables_ (1987) earned him his only Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[53]

His subsequent box-office hits included _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_ (1989), in which he played Henry Jones, Sr., the title character's father, _The Hunt for Red October_ (1990) (where he was reportedly called in at two weeks' notice[54]), _The Russia House_ (1990), _The Rock_ (1996), and _Entrapment_ (1999). In 1996, he voiced the role of Draco the dragon in the film _Dragonheart_. In 1998, Connery received a BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award.[55]

Connery's later films included several box office and critical disappointments such as _First Knight_ (1995), _Just Cause_ (1995), _The Avengers_ (1998), and _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_ (2003); he received positive reviews for his performance in _Finding Forrester_ (2000). He also received a Crystal Globe for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema. In a 2003 poll conducted by Channel 4 Connery was ranked eighth on their list of the 100 Greatest Movie Stars.[56]

Connery stated in interviews that he was offered a role in _The Lord of the Rings_ series,[57] declining it owing to his "not understanding the script". CNN reported that the actor was offered up to 15% of the worldwide box office receipts to play Gandalf, which—had he accepted—could have earned him as much as $400 million for the trilogy.[58] Connery's disillusionment with the "idiots now making films in Hollywood" was cited as a reason for his eventual decision to retire from film-making.[59]

Retirement

When Connery received the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award on 8 June 2006, he confirmed his retirement from acting. On 7 June 2007, he denied rumours that he would appear in the fourth _Indiana Jones_ film, stating that "retirement is just too much damned fun".[60]

Connery returned to voice acting, playing the title character in the animated short _Sir Billi the Vet_, and in 2005 he recorded voiceovers for a new video game version of his Bond film _From Russia with Love_.[61] In an interview on the game disc, Connery stated that he was very happy that the producers of the game (EA Games) had approached him to voice Bond and that he hoped to do another one in the near future. In 2010, he reprised his role in an expanded 80-minute version of _Sir Billi_, serving also as executive producer.[62] In 2010, a bronze bust sculpture of Connery was placed in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia.[63]


Personal life

Diane_Cilento,_1954.jpg]]

During the production of _South Pacific_ in the mid-1950s, Connery dated a "dark-haired beauty with a ballerina's figure", Carol Sopel, but was warned off by her Jewish family. He then dated Julie Hamilton, daughter of documentary filmmaker and feminist Jill Craigie. Given Connery's rugged appearance and rough charm, Hamilton initially thought he was an appalling person and was not attracted to him until she saw him in a kilt, declaring him to be the most beautiful thing she'd ever seen in her life. He also shared a mutual attraction with jazz singer Maxine Daniels, whom he met at the Empire Theatre. He made a pass at her, but she informed him that she was already happily married with a baby daughter. Connery was married to actress Diane Cilento from 1962 to 1973. They had a son, actor Jason Connery. In her autobiography in 2006 she alleged that he had abused her mentally and physically during their relationship; Connery had been quoted as saying that occasionally hitting a woman was "no big deal".[64][65] Connery cancelled an appearance at the Scottish Parliament because of the controversy, and said he had been misquoted and that any abuse of women was unacceptable.[66]

Sean_Connery_en_Micheline_Roquebrune_(1983).jpg Connery has been married to Moroccan-French painter Micheline Roquebrune (born 1929) since 1975.[67] A keen golfer, Connery owned the Domaine de Terre Blanche[68] in the South of France for twenty years (from 1979) where he planned to build his dream golf course on the of land; the dream was realised when he sold it to German billionaire Dietmar Hopp in 1999.[69] He has been awarded an honorary rank of _Shodan_ (1st dan) in Kyokushin karate.[70]

Connery was knighted by Elizabeth II at an investiture ceremony at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh on 5 July 2000.[71] He had been nominated for a knighthood in 1997 and 1998, but these nominations were reported to have been vetoed by Donald Dewar due to Connery's political views.[72] Sean Connery has a villa in Kranidi, Greece. His neighbour is Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, with whom he shares a helicopter platform.[73] Michael Caine (who co-starred with Connery in _The Man Who Would Be King_ in 1975) is among Connery's closest friends.[74] Connery is a keen supporter of Scottish Premiership football club Rangers F.C., having changed his allegiance from Celtic.[75]

Political opinions

Connery is a member of the Scottish National Party,[76][77] a centre-left political party campaigning for Scottish independence from the United Kingdom, and has supported the party financially[78] and through personal appearances. His funding of the SNP ceased in 2001, when the UK Parliament passed legislation that prohibited overseas funding of political activities in the UK.[79]

Tax status

In response to accusations that he is a tax exile, Connery released documents in 2003 showing that he had paid £3.7 million in UK taxes between 1997/98 and 2002/03; critics pointed out that had he been continuously resident in the UK for tax purposes, his tax rate would have been far higher.[80][81] In the run-up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Connery's brother Neil said that Connery would not come to Scotland to rally independence supporters since his tax exile status greatly limited the number of days he could spend in the country.[82]

After Connery sold his Marbella villa in 1999, Spanish authorities launched an investigation into alleged tax evasion by him and his wife, alleging that the Spanish treasury had been defrauded of £5.5 million. Connery was subsequently cleared by the Spanish officials but his wife and 16 others were charged with attempting to defraud the Spanish treasury.[83][84]
