SURVIOS is an American virtual reality game developer and software publisher based in Los Angeles, California. The company develops virtual reality software and games, including the titles _Raw Data_ and _Sprint Vector_.[1][2][3] Survios was created by graduates from the University of Southern California's Mixed Reality Lab, where they worked together on Project Holodeck.[4][5] The company has raised over $54 million in venture funding led by Shasta Ventures, Lux Capital and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.[6][7]


History

Survios was founded in 2013 by Nathan Burba, James Iliff, Alexander Silkin and Graham Matuszewski after they worked together at the University of Southern California on Project Holodeck, a student research project exploring motion-input based VR gaming.[8][9][10] By 2014, the company had raised $250,000 in funding, and created several small VR demos playable on a prototype platform made of existing technologies including Oculus Rift, Razer Hydra controllers and a PlayStation Move.[11][12] In May 2014, Survios raised $4 million in series A funding led by Shasta Ventures, as part of the deal Rob Coneybeer joined the company as an early investor and board member.[13][14] The company completed its Series C funding round in December 2016 led by MGM, bringing its funding to over $50 million. As part of the deal, MGM chairman and CEO Gary Barber joined the company's board.[15]


Games

In July 2016, the company released its first co-op VR game _Raw Data_, a science fiction-themed first-person shooter, for the HTC Vive via Early Access on Steam.[16][17] The game reached number one overall on Steam's global top sellers list.[18] In September 2016, it was reported that _Raw Data_ was the first consumer VR game to reach $1 million in sales in a month and that 20% of all Vive owners had purchased the game.[19] In early 2017, Survios announced that _Raw Data_ would debut in VR arcades.[20] In February 2017, Survios announced that _Raw Data_ would be released for the Oculus Rift platform (using Touch controllers) and that players would be able to join cross-platform multiplayer matches.[21] It was also announced that the game would receive a large content update.[22] On March 16, 2017, _Raw Data_ was officially released on Oculus Home as part of the game's v0.6 update.[23] Exactly a year after its Early Access debut, _Raw Data_ added a player-versus-player mode called "Hostile Takeover" alongside its mission-based narrative campaign.[24]

_Raw Data_ officially left Early Access on October 5, 2017, with the final game launching on Steam and Oculus Home for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift; the PlayStation VR version followed on October 10, 2017.[25] The same day, _Raw Data_ won the VR Game of the Year award at the first annual VR Awards, presented by AMD.[26]

At the 2017 Game Developers Conference, Survios debuted its second title, _Sprint Vector_.[27] An adrenaline platformer that merges extreme athleticism within the setting of an unhinged game show, _Sprint Vector_ features a new movement system called Fluid Locomotion that allows gamers to move at high speeds in VR without causing nausea.[28][29] In October 2017, Sony Interactive Entertainment's Paris Games Week pre-show featured an official teaser trailer for _Sprint Vector_ and the announcement that it would be released on PlayStation VR.[30]

Survios announced in E3 2018 that their next game would be _Creed: Rise to Glory_, based on the film _Creed_.[31]
