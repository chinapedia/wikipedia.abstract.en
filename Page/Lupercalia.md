LUPERCALIA was an ancient, possibly pre-Roman pastoral annual festival,[1] observed in the city of Rome between February 13 and February 15, to avert evil spirits and purify the city, releasing health and fertility. Lupercalia was also called _dies Februatus_, after the instruments of purification called _februa_, which gave February _(Februarius)_ its name.


Name

The festival was later known as Februa ("Purifications" or "Purgings") after the __ which was used on the day.[2] It was also known as __ and gave its name to Juno Februalis, Februlis, or Februata in her role as its patron deity; to a god called Februus, and to February (__), the month during which it occurred.[3] Ovid connects __ to an Etruscan word for "purging".[4] Some sources connect the Latin word for fever (__) with the same idea of purification or purging, due to the sweating commonly seen in association with fevers.

The name _Lupercalia_ was believed in antiquity to evince some connection with the Ancient Greek festival of the Arcadian Lykaia, a wolf festival (, _lýkos_; ), and the worship of _Lycaean Pan_, assumed to be a Greek equivalent to Faunus, as instituted by Evander.[5] Justin describes a cult image of "the Lycaean god, whom the Greeks call Pan and the Romans Lupercus," as nude, save for a goatskin girdle.[6] It stood in the Lupercal, the cave where tradition held that Romulus and Remus were suckled by the she-wolf (Lupa). The cave lay at the foot of the Palatine Hill, on which Romulus was thought to have founded Rome.[7]


Rites

Locations

The rites were confined to the Lupercal cave, the Palatine Hill, and the Forum, all of which were central locations in Rome's foundation myth.[8] Near the cave stood a sanctuary of Rumina, goddess of breastfeeding; and the wild fig-tree (_Ficus Ruminalis_) to which Romulus and Remus were brought by the divine intervention of the river-god Tiberinus; some Roman sources name the wild fig tree _caprificus_, literally "goat fig". Like the cultivated fig, its fruit is pendulous, and the tree exudes a milky sap if cut, which makes it a good candidate for a cult of breastfeeding.[9]

Priesthoods

The Lupercalia had its own priesthood, the _Luperci_ ("brothers of the wolf"), whose institution and rites were attributed either to the Arcadian culture-hero Evander, or to Romulus and Remus, erstwhile shepherds who had each established a group of followers. The _Luperci_ were young men (_iuvenes_), usually between the ages of 20 and 40. They formed two religious _collegia_ (associations) based on ancestry; the _Quinctiliani_ (named after gens Quinctia) and the _Fabiani_ (named after _gens_ Fabia). Each college was headed by a _magister_. In 44 BC, a third college, the _Juliani_, was instituted in honor of Julius Caesar; its first _magister_ was Mark Antony.[10] The college of _Juliani_ disbanded or lapsed during Caesar's civil wars, and was not re-established in the reforms of his successor, Augustus. In the Imperial era, membership of the two traditional _collegia_ was opened to _iuvenes_ of equestrian status.

Sacrifice

At the Lupercal altar, a male goat (or goats) and a dog were sacrificed by one or another of the _Luperci_, under the supervision of the Flamen dialis, Jupiter's chief priest.[11] An offering was also made of salted mealcakes, prepared by the Vestal Virgins.[12] After the blood sacrifice, two _Luperci_ approached the altar. Their foreheads were anointed with blood from the sacrificial knife, then wiped clean with wool soaked in milk, after which they were expected to smile and/or laugh.

The sacrificial feast followed, after which the Luperci cut thongs (known as __) from the flayed skin of the animal,[13] and ran with these, naked or near-naked, along the old Palatine boundary, in an anticlockwise direction around the hill.[14] In Plutarch's description of the Lupercalia, written during the early Empire,

  ...many of the noble youths and of the magistrates run up and down through the city naked, for sport and laughter striking those they meet with shaggy thongs. And many women of rank also purposely get in their way, and like children at school present their hands to be struck, believing that the pregnant will thus be helped in delivery, and the barren to pregnancy.[15]

The _Luperci_ completed their circuit of the Palatine, then returned to the _Lupercal_ cave. Circle_of_Adam_Elsheimer_The_Lupercalian_Festival_in_Rome.jpg, showing the Luperci dressed as dogs and goats, with Cupid and personifications of fertility]]


History

The Februa was of ancient and possibly Sabine origin. After February was added to the Roman calendar, Februa occurred on its fifteenth day (__). Of its various rituals, the most important came to be those of the Lupercalia.[16] The Romans themselves attributed the instigation of the Lupercalia to Evander, a culture hero from Arcadia who was credited with bringing the Olympic pantheon, Greek laws and alphabet to Italy, where he founded the city of Pallantium on the future site of Rome, 60 years before the Trojan War.

Lupercalia was celebrated in parts of Italy and Gaul; _Luperci_ are attested by inscriptions at Velitrae, Praeneste, Nemausus (modern Nîmes) and elsewhere. The ancient cult of the Hirpi Sorani ("wolves of Soranus", from Sabine _hirpus_ "wolf"), who practiced at Mt. Soracte, north of Rome, had elements in common with the Roman Lupercalia.[17]

Descriptions of the Lupercalia festival of 44 BC attest to its continuity; Julius Caesar used it as the backdrop for his (possibly staged) public refusal of a golden crown offered to him by Mark Antony.[18][19] The Lupercal cave was restored or rebuilt by Augustus, and has been speculated to be identical with a grotto discovered in 2007, below the remains of Augustus' residence; according to scholarly consensus, the grotto is a nymphaeum, not the Lupercal.[20] The Lupercalia festival is marked on a calendar of 354 alongside traditional and Christian festivals.[21] Despite the banning in 391 of all non-Christian cults and festivals, Lupercalia was celebrated by the nominally Christian populace on a regular basis into the reign of the emperor Anastasius. Pope Gelasius I (494–96) claimed that only the "vile rabble" were involved in the festival[22] and sought its forceful abolition; the Senate protested that the Lupercalia was essential to Rome's safety and well-being. This prompted Gelasius' scornful suggestion that "If you assert that this rite has salutary force, celebrate it yourselves in the ancestral fashion; run nude yourselves that you may properly carry out the mockery."[23]

There is no contemporary evidence to support the popular notions that Gelasius abolished the Lupercalia, or that he, or any other prelate, replaced it with the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary.[24] A literary association between Lupercalia and the romantic elements of Saint Valentine's Day dates back to Chaucer and poetic traditions of courtly love.[25][26][27][28]


Legacy

CaesarRefusesTheDiademRidpathdrawing.jpg Horace's Ode III, 18 alludes to the Lupercalia. The festival or its associated rituals gave its name to the Roman month of February (__) and thence to the modern month. The Roman god Februus personified both the month and purification, but seems to postdate both.

William Shakespeare's play _Julius Caesar_ begins during the Lupercalia. Mark Antony is instructed by Caesar to strike his wife Calpurnia, in the hope that she will be able to conceive.

[11] One of Plutarch's _Roman Questions_ was "68. Why do the Luperci sacrifice a dog?"... [Because] "nearly all the Greeks used a dog as the sacrificial victim for ceremonies of purification; and some, at least, make use of it even to this day. They bring forth for Hecate puppies along with the other materials for purification." (On-line text in English).
