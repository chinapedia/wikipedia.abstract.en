Since 2019, the Asian Cup final tournament is contested by 24 teams, having been expanded from the 16-team format that was used from 2004 to 2015.[1]

The qualification process involves four rounds, where the first two double as the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification for Asian teams.


Format

The qualification structure is as follows:[2]

-   FIRST ROUND: 12 teams (ranked 35–46) played home-and-away over two legs. The six winners advance to the second round.
-   SECOND ROUND: 40 teams (ranked 1–34 and six first round winners) were divided into eight groups of five teams to play home-and-away round-robin matches.
    -   The eight group winners and the four best group runners-up will advance to the third round of FIFA World Cup qualification as well as qualify for the AFC Asian Cup.
    -   The next 16 highest ranked teams (the remaining four group runners-up, the eight third-placed teams and the four best group fourth-placed teams) will advance directly to the third round of Asian Cup qualification.
    -   The remaining 12 teams will enter the play-off round to contest the remaining eight spots in the third round of Asian Cup qualification.
-   PLAY-OFF ROUND: There are two rounds of home-and-away two-legged play-off matches that will determine the final eight qualifiers for the third round.
-   THIRD ROUND: The 24 teams will be divided into six groups of four to play home-and-away round-robin matches, and they will compete for the remaining slots of the Asian Cup.


Entrants

The 46 FIFA-affiliated nations from the AFC entered qualification, with the April 2019 FIFA World Rankings used to determine which nations would compete in the first round and which nations would receive a bye through to the second round. For seeding in the second round and third round draws, the most recent FIFA Rankings prior to those draws are expected to be used.

Due to the joint format of the World Cup and Asian Cup qualifiers, both Qatar (as the host nation of the 2022 World Cup) and China (as the host nation of the 2023 Asian Cup) will also enter the second round of Asian Cup qualifiers.[3]

The following restrictions will be applied:

-   Northern Mariana Islands, which is not a FIFA member, are not eligible to enter.
-   Timor-Leste was barred from participating in the Asian Cup qualification after being found to have fielded a total of 12 ineligible players in 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification matches among other competitions.[4] However, as FIFA did not bar them from the World Cup qualifiers, Timor-Leste was allowed to enter the competition, but was not eligible to qualify for the Asian Cup.
