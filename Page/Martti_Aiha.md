MARTTI AIHA (born 1952) is a sculptor from Finland. He was born in Pudasj√§rvi and works in Fiskars.[1] He has made abstracted sculptured wall reliefs and free-standing sculptures. His reliefs made of transparent acrylic sheet give an impression of immateriality, incorporeality and weightlessness. The ornamental, flame-like living shapes have become his trademark.[2] In addition of acrylic and plywood, he works with metal, wood or plastic.[3]

Many of Aiha's works are related to his curiosity of our use of public space.[4] Aiha's 15 metres high sculpture _Rumba_ in black-painted aluminium was donated to the City of Helsinki by Alko, the government-owned alcohol company, in context of Alko's 60th anniversary. The sculpture is located in Salmisaari, near Alko's then headquarters.[5]

Aiha received the Swedish Prince Eugen Medal in 2013.[6]
