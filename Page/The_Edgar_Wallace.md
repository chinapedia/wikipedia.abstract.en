THE EDGAR WALLACE is a public house at 40–41 Essex Street, London WC2, at the corner with Devereux Court.

The pub dates back to 1777, and was originally THE ESSEX HEAD.[1] The landlord then was Samuel Greaves, a former servant of the Thrale family where Samuel Johnson had lodged and Johnson and his friend Richard Brocklesby established the Essex Head Club in the tavern in 1783.[2]

It was renamed in 1975 to commemorate the crime writer Edgar Wallace's birth centenary.[3]
