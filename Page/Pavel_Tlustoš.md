Prof._Pavel_Tlustos.jpg PAVEL TLUSTOŠ (born 27 February 1955 in Nové Město na Moravě, Czechoslovakia) is a Czech agricultural chemist. From 2000-10 he was Vice Dean of the Faculty of Agricultural Biology, Food and Natural Resources of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CULS), and 2010-February 2018 he was the Dean of the faculty. Since March 2018 he is again Vice Dean and responsible for international relations the faculty.[1][2]


Life and work

After graduating, Tlustoš studied Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Pardubice (1974- 1979) and graduated as an Diploma engineer. He worked as a chemical technician for the Chirana company, before joining CULS as a research assistant in agrochemistry and plant nutrition. He began his PhD study in 1984 and defended his thesis _Environmental fate of slow release fertilizers_ at the Czech Agricultural University in Prague in 1989. His career continued with research fellowships at Iowa State University in the United States (a Fulbright scholarship) and at IACR Rothamsted in England (Rothamsted International scholarship), as well as various lecturing positions. He received his Venia legendi in _Agrochemistry and Plant Nutrition_ and a professorship of CULS from Czech president Vaclav Havel in 2002. In 2000, Tlustoš had been appointed Vice-dean for education at the Faculty of Agrobiology, Food and Natural Resources, and he became Dean in 2010. He is also deputy head of the Department of Agro-Environmental Chemistry and Plant Nutrition. Through his research in the field of bioeffectors he has close links with the University of Hohenheim

His main research areas are:

-   soil-plant relations, in particular the effects of nutrients and toxic substances
-   mobility of nutrients, risk elements and toxic compounds in the soil, especially in the rhizosphere
-   the effect of soil amendments on the mobility of elements in soil and their availability for plants
-   the treatment and recycling of waste materials, their processing and applicability in agriculture and horticulture
-   soil detoxification by plants and living organisms
-   the environmental behavior of fertilizers and release of nutrients


Membership of professional bodies

Tlustoš is a member of the Audit Committees of the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice, the Faculty of Agrobiology and Food Resources of the Slovak University in Nitra, and the Faculty of Agronomy of Mendel University, Brno. He is on the advisory boards of the Plant Research Institute in Prague Ruzyne, and the Research Institute for Soil and Water Conservation in Prague Zbraslav. He is also a paid member of numerous international journals about soil chemistry, plant nutrition and environmental research.


Selected publications

Tlustoš has published around 194 research papers that have been cited 1494 times, with a Hirsch index of 22. He has supervised 20 PhD students and around 100 diploma students and is a member of the Biofector research team.[3][4]
