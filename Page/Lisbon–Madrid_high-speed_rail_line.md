LISBON–MADRID HIGH-SPEED RAIL LINE is a proposed high speed line between the Iberian capitals. It forms part of the Trans-European high-speed rail network, which in turn is one of a number of the European Union's Trans-European transport networks (TEN-T). It was defined by the COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 96/48/EC of 23 July 1996.[1]

In 2012 the project was cancelled officially on the Portuguese side of the project as not being financially viable.[2]

In 2016 the European Union's European Regional Development Fund, gave Spain €205.1m towards the €312.1m needed for the track between Navalmoral de la Mata and Mérida, Spain. [3]
