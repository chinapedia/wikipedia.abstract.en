ANDREW JOHN MCKEAN (born June 23, 1949) is an American politician in the state of Iowa. He currently represents District 58. McKean served in the Iowa State Senate from 1993 to 2003. He was a Republican from 1978 to 2019, in which he became a member of the Democratic Party.


Early life and education

Andy was raised in New York state.[1] He earned his bachelor’s degree in political science from Oneonta State College and his master’s degree in community planning from the University of Rhode Island.[2] He came to Iowa to explore his family roots in the Anamosa area and earned his Juris Doctorate from the University of Iowa College of Law.[3]


Political career

In his nine terms in the Iowa House and three terms in the Senate, Andy has prioritized bi-partisan problem solving that has put him in leadership positions, including serving as Senate President Pro Tem and Judiciary Committee Chair.[4] He recently served as the House Ethics Committee Chair in the 88th General Assembly.[5] Rep. McKean served as a Jones County Supervisor from 2003 to 2011 and was appointed to the Iowa Public Information Board by Governor Branstad. In 2018, he was re-elected to District 58.[6]

Andy was most recently the longest serving Republican in the state legislature, until he made the decision to change political parties and join the Iowa House Democratic Caucus. He cited his disapproval with Donald Trump as the main reason.[7] McKean announced that he will run for re-election as a Democrat.[8]
