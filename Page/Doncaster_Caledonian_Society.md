The DONCASTER CALEDONIAN SOCIETY was founded in Doncaster in the 18th century and holds regular meetings for its members at Doncaster Golf Club [1] to promote Scottish culture and traditions in the local area.[2] Meetings consist of celebrations for St. Andrew's Day, Burns Supper and holding monthly seminars.[3]

The 2016â€“17 President is Vivien M'Itwamwari, a past President of the Yorkshire District World Burns Federation,[4] and the Vice-President is David Hunter.[5]

In 2014, members of the society took part in creating the Scottish Diaspora Tapestry, by stitching Henry of Scotland as he gained the Lordship of Doncaster during his lifetime.
