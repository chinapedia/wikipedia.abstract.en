PETER COADE (born February 14, 1942) is a Canadian broadcast meteorologist. In 2013 he was certified by the _Guinness Book of World Records_ as having had the longest career of any weather forecaster.


Career

Coade was born in north-end Halifax, Nova Scotia, one of five children of pharmacist Vincent Coade and his wife, Jessie (Preston) Coade, the first female sports journalist for the _Halifax Herald_. Sometimes interviewing sailors aboard vessels in port, she became known as "Messdeck Annie".[1]

While in high school, Coade job-shadowed the popular Halifax meteorologist Rube Hornstein, appearing with Hornstein on television,[2] but it would be several years before he became an on-air weather forecaster himself. He was hired by the Meteorological Service of Canada in 1962 where he received on-the-job training in meteorology. Postings with the department included Truro, Goose Bay, and Toronto. He began his broadcast career while in Goose Bay in 1967, providing the nightly weather forecasts for the local CBC affiliate CFLA-TV, which was broadcast to US troops in an agreement with the US Air Force.[3]

About 1970, he and his family moved to Toronto where he continued with Environment Canada as a spokesman, meanwhile also serving as staff meteorologist for radio station CFRB. While in Toronto, he was also the official meteorologist for the Canadian International Air Show. In 1990, he returned to Halifax where he began a seventeen-year tenure as the evening weatherman for ATV's _Live at Five_ (1998â€“2007) and the Atlantic Satellite Network. He left ATV when he reached mandatory retirement age in 2007 and immediately re-joined CBC where he continued to forecast the weather for the CBC evening news.[4] On December 3, 2012, he became CBC Radio One's morning meteorologist, providing weather forecasts for six CBC radio stations within the three Maritime provinces, including _Information Morning_ in Halifax.

Coade's career record surpassed that of fellow Canadian Dave Devall of CTV Toronto who retired from his 48-year career in 2009. His _Guinness Book of Records_ citation read: "The longest career as a weather forecaster is 50 years, 8 months and 21 days, and was achieved by Peter Coade (Canada) at CBC Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada from October 1, 1962 to June 21, 2013".[5] This was subsequently surpassed by Dick Goddard.[6]

He retired on September 30, 2016.[7]
