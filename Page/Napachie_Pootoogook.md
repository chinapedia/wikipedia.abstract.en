NAPACHIE POOTOOGOOK (June 26, 1938 â€“ December 18, 2002) was a Canadian Inuit graphic artist who produced an important body of work.[1] Pootoogook's only written and spoken language was Inuktitut.


Life and family

Napachie Pootoogook is the only daughter of acclaimed artist Pitseolak Ashoona.[2] She was born in the Sarruq Island camp near south Baffin Island.[3] Her father, Ashoona, died while she was six or seven years old. After his death, Pootoogook, along with her mother and five brothers, lived a traditional nomadic Inuit lifestyle and survived with the support of their community to survive.[4] With her mother's encouragement, Napachie began drawing in her early twenties, developing her own unique style and viewpoint.[5] Her brothers, Kiugak and Qaqaq Ashoona, are well known sculptors. As well, two of her sisters-in-law, Mayureak and Sorosiluto Ashoona are well known graphic artists.

In the mid-1950s, Napachie entered into an arranged marriage with Eegyvudluk Pootoogook, an Inuit printmaker and carver, although the difficulties she saw in her parents' arranged marriage originally made her hesitant. The two were married in Kaiktuuq, Nunavut, then moved to Cape Dorset where they lived for most of their marriage, except for two years spent living in Iqaluit.[6] Pootoogook and her husband had eleven children, several of whom died young. Two children died in a house fire in the early 1960s, and one of their daughters drowned soon after.[7] Continuing the family's artistic legacy, their surviving daughter, Annie Pootoogook, grew up to be an important contemporary Inuit artist known for her prints and drawings. In her lifetime, Napachie was made a grandmother to many grandchildren.[8]

Pootoogook's only written and spoken language was Inuktitut.[9]


Work

Pootoogook began drawing in her early twenties with her mother's encouragement.[10] Like many Inuit artists, she brought her drawings to the Cape Dorset-based West Baffin Cooperative (now known as the Kinngait Studios), an institution that would purchase artworks and offered art classes. Pootoogook sold her first drawings to James Archibald Houston for $20 when she was twenty-five years old.[11]

She continued to draw and make prints until her death, producing more than 5000 original works.[12]

Pootoogook's art was included in fourteen Cape Dorset print collections and has been featured in many anthologies of Inuit art since the 1960s.[13]

Inspiration and themes

Much of Pootoogook's early work documented traditional Inuit spirituality, mythology and superstitions.[14] In the 1970s, she began using her art to document traditional Inuit life and clothing as well as local histories.[15] The drawings created toward the end of her career told stories from her personal life and those of her ancestors, going back two generations.[16] Some of those later pieces illustrated darker aspects of Inuit life - covering themes like spousal abuse, starvation, forced marriage and infanticide.[17]

Techniques and methodologies

Pootoogook's drawings were primarily done with acrylic paints, black felt-tipped pens or colored pencils.[18]

Her artistic style changed after she completed courses in acrylic painting and drawing workshops at the West Baffin Co-operative in 1976. After taking those classes, her art featured more landscapes and "Western notions of spatial composition."[19]

In her later career, when depicting events from her life, Pootoogook experimented with figure drawing and lithography.[20]
