PASSERELLES NUMÉRIQUES (PN) is a French Non-governmental organization created in 2005 in Cambodia. The organization later expanded its actions and now operates in Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines.[1]

Passerelles numériques works to provide disadvantaged youths with a way out of poverty for them and their families[2] by giving them the training to become professionals in the Information technology sector.[3]

To ensure gender equity, the organization has made a commitment to take in a minimum of 50% women in its programs.[4] This equalitarian model is in stark contrast to the reality of most IT training courses; for example, in Cambodia, only 6% of IT students at university are women.[5]


History

-   2005: Creation of Passerelles numériques[6] and opening of the first training center in Cambodia[7]
-   2007: First graduation ceremony in Phnom Penh for 20 students of the Systems and Network Administration program
-   2009: The program is expanded to Cebu City, in the Philippines
-   2010: The program is expanded to Vietnam[8]


Activities

Passerelles numériques offers short-term technical and professional training (two or three years) in the sector of information technology to young disadvantaged students.[9]

Students will benefit from training in IT skills, English language proficiency, and soft skills.[10] The program includes practical, hands-on training, and helps them develop problem-solving skills.[11] The focus is placed on employability, with a curriculum frequently updated to reflect market demands and the employers' needs. For that purpose, the curriculum also includes career guidance and on-the-job training in the form of mandatory internships.[12]

Students can train to become Software Developers or Systems & Networks Administrators.[13]

In Vietnam, the diploma received by graduates of the program is recognized by the Vietnamese Ministry of Education.[14]

Passerelles numériques' students and alumni also give back to the community, such as by offering tutoring to local students in need or by supporting local charities.[15] After their graduation, and once they have found a job, they are asked to give back to PN to support the training of future students.[16]


Impact

The average salary of PN Cambodia graduates has been recorded at 149USD three months after graduation, and 300USD per month (nearly five times the national average) three years after graduation.[17]


Organization

Passerelles numériques' board of directors counts 10 members. They are Benoît Genuini (President), Roland Flouquet-Vilboux (Secretary), Michel Cantet (Treasurer), Bruno Grossi, Pierre Danon, Duc Ha Duong, Patrick De Fayet, François Phulpin, Hughes Missonier and Simmoni de Weck.[18]

PN works with a team of international and local volunteers,[19] interns and staff members. It is led by a coordination team with four members, based in Cambodia and France: Maud Lhuiller (Asia Director), Fabrice Filachet (Education and Social Mission Director), Delphine Cantet (Communications Director) and Juliette Wait (Asia Communication Manager).[20]


Partnerships

Passerelles numériques operates with the help of corporate partners such as Cisco Systems,[21] Econocom, Accenture[22] and the Société Générale Corporate Foundation for Solidarity.[23]

Local partners in each of the operating countries include Synacy (in the Philippines)[24] and Web Essentials (in Cambodia).[25]

Passerelles numériques also benefits from partnerships with local universities.[26] The University of San Carlos, in the Philippines, and Da Nang University, in Vietnam, support Passerelles numériques' training.
