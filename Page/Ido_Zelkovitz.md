-   _Students and Resistance In Palestine: Books, Guns, and Politics_ (Routledge, 2015) [10][11][12][13][14]

In his first book, published in Hebrew, Zelkovitz argues that fatah is not a secular political movement, but rather a traditional national liberation movement with religious background. Zelkovitz relates to the importance of Islam in the movement's political discourse and its cultural world.

In his second book, Zelkovitz explores the Palestinian Student Movement from an historical and sociological perspective. This book demonstrates how Palestinian national identity has been built in the absence of national institutions, whilst emphasizing the role of higher education as an agent of social change, capable of crystallizing patterns of national identity.

The book, was the first one that focuses on the political and social activities of Palestinian students in two arenas—the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the Palestinian diaspora in the years 1952-2000.[15] The book investigates the shared goal of the several movements in securing independence and the building a sovereign Palestinian state, comparing their development, social impact and the differing challenges each movement faced.
