_UFC ON FOX: VANZANT VS. WATERSON_ (also known as _UFC ON FOX 22_) was a mixed martial arts event promoted by the Ultimate Fighting Championship and held on December 17, 2016, at Golden 1 Center in Sacramento, California.[1]


Background

After previously contesting four events in Sacramento at Sleep Train Arena, this was the first for the promotion at the newly-built venue.[2]

A women's bout between Paige VanZant and former Invicta FC Atomweight Champion Michelle Waterson served as the event headliner.[3]

The event featured the final fight of former WEC Featherweight Champion and UFC Bantamweight Championship title challenger Urijah Faber, as he faced Brad Pickett.[4]

As a result of the cancellation of UFC Fight Night: Lamas vs. Penn, bouts between James Moontasri vs. Alex Morono and Cole Miller vs. Mizuto Hirota were rescheduled for this event.[5][6]

The event was televised on Fox, averaging 3.2 million viewers.[7]
