SCIMITAR BUILDING, also known as the MEMPHIS LIGHT, GAS, AND WATER BUILDING, WINCHESTER BUILDING and most recently HOTEL NAPOLEON, is a five-story stone-veneer structure in a combination of Beaux-Arts and Romanesque Revival styles. It started life as the home of the Memphis newspaper _Evening Scimitar_ and is currently a boutique hotel.


Building

The Scimitar Building is a five-story stoned-veneer structure on a raised basement, designed in a combination of Beaux-Arts and Romanesque revival styles.[1] The lobby is lined with original Tennessee marble, and is encircled by large circular, arched windows.[2]

Originally the building had entrances on both Third and Madison streets.[3] Lion heads decorate the top of the building along the fifth floor.[4]

Although several alterations have been done in 1920s, 1950s, 1970s, and 2010s, the building overall retains a high degree of historical and architectural integrity.[5]


History

Scimitar_building_memphis_1909_postcard.jpg The Scimitar Building was commissioned by Napoleon Hill (1830-1909) in 1902 and designed by local architects August A. Chigazola (1869-1911) and William J. Hanker (1876-1958). [6] Hill, known as Memphis' original "merchant prince,"[7] was one of the wealthiest people in Memphis, and a part owner of the _Evening Scimitar_.[8] Hill lived across Madison Avenue in a mansion which stood on the site of the present Sterick Building.[9][10] Hill's initials can still be seen etched into the fa√ßade of the building.[11]

The Scimitar Building was home to the Memphis newspaper _Evening Scimitar_ (later News-Scimitar and then Press-Scimitar) from 1902 to 1929.[12] The newspaper took up three floors of the building.[13] The raised basement was home to the stereotype and composing rooms of the newspaper, as well as the press machinery.[14] People on the street could view the press machinery in operation through the building's giant windows.[15] In 1926, the newspaper outgrew the building and moved to an address on Union Avenue.[16]

The building was the headquarters for Memphis Light, Gas and Water from 1937 to 1970.[17] Later, the building was an office building known as the WINCHESTER BUILDING.[18] The Winchester Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.[19] The property went on the market in 2012 and was sold in 2014 for $1.26 million.[20]

In 2016 the building re-opened as the HOTEL NAPOLEON with 56 guest rooms, a business center, and fitness center.[21] Named after original owner Napoleon Hill, the hotel is a member of Ascend Hotels, the boutique brand of parent company Choice Hotels.[22]
