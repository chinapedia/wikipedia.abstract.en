CONJUNCTION INTRODUCTION (often abbreviated simply as CONJUNCTION and also called AND INTRODUCTION)[1][2][3] is a valid rule of inference of propositional logic. The rule makes it possible to introduce a conjunction into a logical proof. It is the inference that if the proposition _p_ is true, and proposition _q_ is true, then the logical conjunction of the two propositions _p and q_ is true. For example, if it's true that "it's raining", and it's true that "I'm inside", then it's true that "it's raining and I'm inside". The rule can be stated:

$$\frac{P,Q}{\therefore P \land Q}$$

where the rule is that wherever an instance of "P" and "Q" appear on lines of a proof, a "P ∧ Q" can be placed on a subsequent line.


Formal notation

The _conjunction introduction_ rule may be written in sequent notation:

    P, Q ⊢ P ∧ Q

where P and Q are propositions expressed in some formal system, and ⊢ is a metalogical symbol meaning that P ∧ Q is a syntactic consequence if P and Q are each on lines of a proof in some logical system;
