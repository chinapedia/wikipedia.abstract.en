Penberthy was born in 1960 in Swansea, Wales.[1][2] She was brought up in Cardiff, and was educated in the city at Cardiff High School, a comprehensive school.[3] She studied at Newnham College, Cambridge, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1981; as per tradition, her BA was promoted to a Master of Arts (MA Cantab) degree in 1985.[4] In 1983, she entered Cranmer Hall, Durham, an Evangelical Anglican theological college, to train for ministry.[5][6] During this time, she also studied for a Master of Theology (MTh) degree, which she completed in 1984.[7]


Ordained ministry

In 1984, Penberthy was made a deaconess in the Church of England.[8] From 1984 to 1985, she served as a full-time deaconess at St Andrew's Church, Haughton-le-Skerne in the Diocese of Durham.[9] She moved to Wales in 1985, and began her ministry in the Church in Wales. From 1985 to 1989, served as a full-time deaconess in the Benefice of Llanishen and Lisvane on the outskirts of Cardiff and in the Diocese of Llandaff.[10][11]

In 1987, Penberthy was ordained a deacon; the Church in Wales had ordained women to the diaconate since 1980.[12] From 1987 to 1989, she was also a non-stipendiary minister in the benefice of Llanishen and Lisvane.[13] From 1989 to 1993, she was a non-stipendiary minister in the benefice of Llanwddyn (St Wyddyn) and Llanfihangel-yng-Nghwynfa and Llwydiarth in the Diocese of St Asaph;[14] her husband served as its Vicar during this period.[15] From 1993 to 1995, she was a non-stipendiary minister in the benefice of St Sadwrn's Church, Llansadwrn with Llanwrda and Manordeilo in the Diocese of St David's;[16] her husband was vicar of this benefice from 1993 to 2010.[17] From 1994, she was also a Provincial Officer in the Division for Parochial Development and Renewal;[18] this was an appointment focused on evangelism.[19]

In 1997, Penberthy was ordained a priest; this was the first year that the Church in Wales ordained women to the priesthood, making her one of the first female priests in the province.[20][21] She continued working for the Division for Parochial Development and Renewal until 1999.[22] From 1999 to 2001, she was Priest-in-Charge of St Cynwyl's Church, Cynwyl Gaeo with Llansawel and Talley in the Diocese of St Davids.[23] She was made Vicar of the benefice in 2001.[24] She was also an Adult Education Officer for the Diocese of St David's between 2001 and 2002, and Warden of Readers for the diocese between 2002 and 2010.[25] In February 2007, she was also made a Canon of St David's Cathedral; she was the first woman to be appointed a canon at that cathedral.[26]

In 2010, Penberthy returned to England, leaving behind her benefice and canonry. From 2010 to 2011, she was Priest-in-Charge of the benefice of Charlton Musgrove (St John) (St Stephen), Cucklington and Stoke Trister in the Diocese of Bath and Wells.[27] She was made Rector of the benefice in 2011.[28] In July 2015, it was announced that she would be leaving the diocese to return to Wales.[29] On 8 September 2015, she was inducted as the Rector of Glan Ithon (a benefice consisting of Llandrindod Wells (Holy Trinity) (Old Parish Church) and Cefnllys with Diserth with Llanyre and Llanfihangel Helygen) in the Diocese of Swansea and Brecon.[30][31]
