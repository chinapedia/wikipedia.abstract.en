The KHON KAEN LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT PROJECT is a planned 22.6km light rail transit system consisting of an initial 16 stations to serve Khon Kaen Province in north-east Thailand.[1] A Phase 2 extension of 3.5km and 5 stations is also planned. The line will have both grade and elevated sections. It is expected to be operational in around 2022. Fares are expected to be a flat 15 baht.[2]


History

The original plan for mass transit in Khon Kaen consisted of a 4 line Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) network which was proposed in 2012.[3] By 2014, a master plan for the BRT network had been finalised.[4]

However, in early 2015 Khon Kaen Mayor proposed converting the long North-South Red BRT line into a light rail line as part of Khon Kaen's Smart City development program and to integrate with the future planned North East high speed rail to Nong Khai. By mid 2015, a feasibility study was commissioned for a light rail line.[5] In mid March 2016, the Thai government signed a decree approving the project and provided a budget to complete the feasibility study and design of the project.[6] In March 2017, the Khon Kaen Mayor announced that a private company, Khon Kaen Transit System Co., owned by Khon Kaen City and 4 surrounding municipalities would be established to operate the line.[7]

In July 2017, it was announced that the tender for the project was to be issued and awarded by the end of 2017.[8] However, this did not occur as the feasibility study by Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning (OTP) evaluating the design and operations had not been completed.[9] The OTP study was completed in February 2018[10] and the project was formally approved by the government in October 2018.[11]

As of December 2018, bidding on the project is scheduled to commence no later than February 2019, with construction beginning immediately after the process concludes within next year.[12]
