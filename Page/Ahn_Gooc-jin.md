Career

Born in 1980, Ahn, after graduating from the theater and film department in Kyung Hee University, studied directing in the Korean Academy of Film Arts. His graduation short film, _Stop by My House_ (2008) was screened at Buchon International Fantastic Film Festival and Seoul Independent Film Festival, and won the runner-up prize at the University Film Festival of Korea. Another short, _Double Clutch_ (2010) was invited to both Mise-en-scène Short Film Festival and Hong Kong Short Film Festival, and won the Grand Prize in the Short Film section at the 2011 Jeonju International Film Festival.[1]

Ahn's directorial feature début _Alice in Earnestland_ is a dark drama with surreal comical overtones that falls somewhere between Park Chan-wook's _The Vengeance Trilogy_ and Korean indie social dramas on the style spectrum. The film premiered at the 2015 Jeonju International Film Festival, where it picked up the Grand Prize in the Korean Film Competition.[2]

Ahn had his TV debut in 2018 through the Drama Stage episode _All About My Rival in Love_.
