Programs

English language training and testing

The Institute supports international students who have been offered a place at The University of Queensland with bridging English programs and free ongoing English language support for current students and their family members.

Teacher training and testing

The Institute designs and delivers a variety of teacher training programs for native and non-native speakers of English and is licensed by Cambridge English to deliver the CELTA (Cambridge Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) and Teaching Knowledge Test (TKT (ELT)). In 2000, the Institute collaborated with World Learning and Cambridge English Language Assessment to develop the International Diploma of Language Teaching Management (IDLTM). The IDLTM provides training specifically for managers of language teaching centres. It is the only qualification of its kind and has been delivered at various locations around the world.

Customised program partners include Chilean Ministry of Education, Vietnamese Ministry of Education and Training, English First (EF) China, and universities and government agencies across Latin-America, Asia, Europe and the African Union.

Professional and internship programs

The Institute delivers programs accredited by the relevant Australian professional bodies and Australian Government to achieve employment outcomes for international students and recent graduates. These programs provide practical training and work experience (internships) in engineering and accounting professions. Internship programs for business professionals are also provided.

International Development

History

ICTE-UQ started in 1981 as a small, one-class English language training centre within the Institute of Modern Languages (Queensland) at The University of Queensland under a grant from the Australian Government's Australia-Japan Foundation. Several divisions at the university subsequently combined and were given the Institute's current name in 1996.

ICTE-UQ has expanded over time to include:

-   the first IELTS test centre in Brisbane (1989)
-   Bridging English for students offered a place at UQ (2008)
-   UQ International Development division (2016), formerly a division of UniQuest, the university's main commercialisation company.

The Institute has grown an international network of over 100 partner organisations and 100 education representatives which it harnesses, together with the expertise of The University of Queensland and experts in industry, to develop customised programs.

With ongoing growth in student numbers and an expanding range of programs, the Institute has moved several times and relocated to its current premises in 2009.


Architecture and campus

The Institute is housed in the purpose-built Sir Llew Edwards Building, a $42 million investment which involved three years of planning, design and construction and was completed in 2008. The building has won numerous architectural awards including the Australian Institute of Architects best public building in Queensland award for 2009.

The Institute is located at the main campus of The University of Queensland, a large 274 acre (111 hectare) site, 7 kilometres from the Brisbane central business district. The campus fans out from a heritage-listed sandstone cloister to an extensive complex of buildings and landscaped grounds, including 3 lakes, 8 athletics ovals, 21 tennis courts, a large sports centre and an aquatics centre with an olympic-sized swimming pool. The campus provides a self-contained environment for students and staff with numerous library and study spaces, health and child care services, art, museum and performance spaces, eating and retail venues.
