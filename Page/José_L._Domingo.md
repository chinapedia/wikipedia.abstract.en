JOSÃ‰ LUIS DOMINGO (born 1951 in Tortosa, Catalonia, Spain) is a Spanish toxicologist and distinguished professor of toxicology at Rovira i Virgili University.[1]


Education and career

Domingo attended the University of Barcelona, from which he received two chemistry degrees: an undergraduate degree in 1972 and a doctorate in 1982. In 1991, he became a full professor of toxicology at the University of Barcelona; two years later, he assumed the same position at Rovira i Virgili University. In 2006, he was named a distinguished professor by Rovira i Virgili University.[2]


Research

Domingo's research focuses on, among other topics, the potential human health effects of environmental and food contaminants.[3] This includes genetically modified foods, and he has argued that not enough independent studies have been done regarding their potential adverse effects.[4] He has also published review articles concluding that there are only a limited number of safety assessment studies of genetically modified foods, and has been critical of the concept of "substantial equivalence" as it relates to such foods.[5]


Honors, awards and positions

Domingo is the editor-in-chief of two scientific journals: _Food and Chemical Toxicology_[6] and _Environmental Research_.[7] He has also been the co-editor-in-chief of _Human and Ecological Risk Assessment_, the editor of the reviews section of _Environment International_, and has served on the editorial boards of more than seven other journals. He is also a member of multiple professional societies, including the Society of Toxicology, the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, and the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.[8] In 2014, and again in 2015, he was named an ISI highly cited researcher.[9]
