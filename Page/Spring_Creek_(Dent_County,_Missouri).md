The stream headwaters arise south of Salem just north of Missouri Route K and west of Missouri Route 19 (at ). The stream flows to the north then turns east passing under route 19 on the south edge of Salem. It then turns north passing under Missouri Route 32 just east of Salem then turns northwest passing under combined routes 68-19.

Spring Creek was named for the fact it is a spring-fed stream at its source.[4]
