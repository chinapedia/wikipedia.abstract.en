The petty princely state, in Jhalawar _prant_, was ruled by Jhala Rajput Chieftains.

In 1901 it comprised a single village, with a population of 131, yielding 3,000 Rupees state revenue (1903-4, mostly from land), paying 416 tribute to the British and to Junagarh State. [1] Solanki Rajputs also live there.
