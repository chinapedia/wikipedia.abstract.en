The COLONIAL HOCKEY CONFERENCE (CHC) is an athletic conference that operates in the northeastern United States. It participates in the NCAA's Division III as an ice hockey-only conference and includes only women's teams.

The formation of the conference was originally announced in late 2014 under the ECAC umbrella, with the conference to be known as the ECAC North Atlantic.[1] The eight founding institutions all had either independent or newly formed women's hockey teams, so no teams had to switch conferences to join the ECAC-NA. In 2015, however, just before the conference's first season commenced, the members announced that the conference would be renamed the Colonial Hockey Conference, dropping the ECAC affiliation.[2]
