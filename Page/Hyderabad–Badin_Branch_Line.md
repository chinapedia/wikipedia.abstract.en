History

The Hyderabad–Badin Railway opened on 15 August 1904 as part of the North Western State Railway's expansion program. However owing to World War 1, financial stringency stagnated developments of the railways. In order to meet the necessities of the military authorities, this rail line (along with the Lodhran–Kasur Railway) was dismantled in 1917 during World War 1, as the rails were needed elsewhere. In 1922, the track was rebuilt to its present alignment.[1]
