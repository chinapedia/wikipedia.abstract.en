Description

_Eucalyptus arenacea_ is a tree with several to many stems or a robust mallee, grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous and stringy bark on its trunk and to the thinnest branches. Leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are arranged in opposite pairs and are egg-shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves are shiny green, arranged alternately, lance-shaped or curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers are borne in groups of between seven and fifteen in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. The mature buds are oval to club-shaped, long and wide with a rounded or conical operculum. Flowering mainly occurs between December and January and the flowers are white. The fruit is hemispherical to a truncated sphere, long and wide on a pedicel up to long.[3][4][5]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus arenacea_ was first formally described in 1988 by Julie Marginson and Pauline Ladiges and the description was published in _Australian Systematic Botany_.[6] The specific epithet (_arenacea_) is a Latin word meaning "of sand".[7]


Distribution and habitat

Desert stringybark grows on pale-coloured sandhills and on sandplains between Keith, Pinaroo and Bordertown in the Ninety Mile Desert in South Australia and in the Little Desert and Big Desert areas of Victoria.[8][9]
