Reception

In a review of _Reading Magic_ _Booklist_ noted its "cheerful, chatty style thatâ€™s totally jargon-free" and recommended it for new parents.[1] _January Magazine_', in its review, wrote "Fox' book isn't some boring, didactic treatise on how to improve your child's reading skills. In fact, she's not at all fond of the phonics fanatics, and even discourages making your child read aloud to show their progress.",[2] while _Library Journal Review_ calls it a "rah-rah book on the benefits of reading aloud to children" and "A marginal purchase for public libraries."[3]

_Reading Magic_ has also been reviewed by _Publishers Weekly_[4] and the _School Library Journal_.[5]
