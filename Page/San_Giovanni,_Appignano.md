SAN GIOVANNI is a Gothic-style, Roman Catholic church located in Appignano, province of Macerata, in the region of Marche, Italy.


History

The original church of Appignano was built in the 15th century. The town walls were built in 1443 by Alessandro Sforza when he took possession of the city. The apse of the church was at one time one of the corner towers of the fortification.

The church was enlarged in the 14th century, erecting a gothic bell tower whose belfry has lobed arches. It was here that the apse was extended into the city tower. In the 16th century this church joined with that of the pieve of San Giovanni and San Pietro. The main altarpiece depicts an _Enthroned Madonna and Child with Saints Peter, John, Catherine of Alexandria, and two donors_ (circa 1519-1534) by Giorgio da Tolentino.

In the 18th century, an inventory identified seven altars, including altars dedicated to _St Lucy Virgin and Martyr_, to _St James_, to _St Vincent Ferrer_, to _St Bartholemew Apostle_, to _The Rosary_, and to _St Joseph_. The altar of St Joseph (San Giuseppe) had an altarpiece depicting the _Marriage of the Virgin_ (circa 1630).

In 1750, the interior underwent a major refurbishment, leaving a single nave with three chapels on each side. The façade portal in stone has a rounded pediment and a Baroque cartouche. In 1931 the interior was frescoed by Tommaso Gentili (1868-1963) of Osimo;[1] depicting in the apse events of the life of John the Baptist: a _Baptism of Christ_, _Preaching_ , and his _Decapitation_. The choir ceiling has a depiction of a dove symbolizing the Holy Spirit in stucco, while the spandrels have cherubs holding festoons. The nave ceiling has _The Redeemer_ image surrounded by the four evangelists. Above the windows are medallions with busts of saints.[2]
