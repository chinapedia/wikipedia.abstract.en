GEKO were a gothic rock duo based in Los Angeles. Formed in 1983, the band's nucleus comprised vocalist/bassist Sarah Folkman and guitarist Carrie McNinch. They released one full-length album, titled _Join My Pretty World_, in 1992 before disbanding.


History

Geko was formed in 1983 by Sarah Folkman and Carrie McNinch, who were roommates and attending school at the time. Both were influenced by early death rock, rockabilly and punk rock. After a few years of performing live, the band recorded a six song demo in the late eighties. The band issued their first proper release, the _"Probing the Gash in Her Head_ 7", in 1991 for Open Records.

Produced with the help of prominent Los Angeles producer Earle Mankey, the band issued their sole full-length album _Join My Pretty World_ in 1992. The album compiled previously recorded tracks with new recordings. Ned Raggett of allmusic called the band "sharply powerful" and the album was "rough, industrial-strength darkwave music that easily bears repeated listening."[1]

The duo dissolved shortly after the release of their debut album. McNinch abandoned the music scene and began publishing comic zines including _The Assassin and the Whiner_, and _Food Geek_. Her mini comic _You Don't Get There From Here_ is still being published regularly. McNinch also has work included in various anthologies, including _QU33R_, _No Straight Lines: Four Decades of Queer Comics_, _Runner Runner_, _Tablegedden_ and multiple issues of _Not My Small Diary_. Her book _I Want Everything to be Okay_ was published by Tugboat Press. Sarah Folkman collaborated with a number of bands, including Spiderworks, Vampire Rodents and proGREX.iv, before joining the trip hop band THC in 1997. She has since gained some recognition as a visual artist and illustrator.[2][3]
