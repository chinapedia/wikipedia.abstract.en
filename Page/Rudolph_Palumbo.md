RUDOLPH PALUMBO (27 March 1901 â€“ 16 July 1987) was a British property developer who made his fortune redeveloping Second World War bombsites in London.[1]


Early life

Palumbo (originally Rodolfo) was the son of Pasquale and Gaetana Palumbo from Amalfi, who ran a cafe in Lower Thames Street.[2][3][4]


Career

Palumbo's development company was called City Acre, and he built their headquarters building in 1952,[5] at 37A Walbrook, as the family office. Following an extensive conversion by Mark Birley, the Walbrook Club opened in 2000.[6]

His portrait was painted by Oskar Kokoschka in 1960, and still hangs in its original position above the fireplace in what was his office, and is now the dining room at 37A Walbrook [7][8]


Personal life

Palumbo married Elsie Annie Gregory, a classical musician from Lancashire, and their only child was Peter Palumbo, Baron Palumbo, also a property developer.[9][10]

Palumbo is buried in the churchyard of St Stephen Walbrook, London.[11]
