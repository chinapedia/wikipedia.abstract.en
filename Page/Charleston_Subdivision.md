History

The line from Florence to Charleston was originally built as the Northeastern Railroad in 1856. The Northeastern Railroad became part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1898.[3]

The line south of Charleston was originally chartered in 1854 by the Charleston and Savannah Railroad (later known as the Charleston and Savannah Railway).[4]

Some of the line in Charleston, including the bridge over the Ashley River, was built as the Ashley River Railroad, which opened in on December 27, 1877. This was the final link in what would become the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad mainline (the CSX A Line).[5][6]

The Charleston and Savannah Railway and the Ashley River Railroad came under the ownership of Henry B. Plant in the 1880s. The Plant System would then be bought by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902.[7] The Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line merged in 1967, with the merged company becoming CSX by 1986.
