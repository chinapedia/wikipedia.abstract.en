SANT'ADRIANO III PAPA is a Roman Catholic church located on Via San Carlo in Spilamberto, province of Modena, region of Emilia-Romagna, Italy.


History

A church was founded in 1210, as a subsidiary church to the Pieve of San Vito. Only in 1628 was it elevated to arcipretura. The original church was smaller and oriented with an apse to the east of the façade; in 1736-1757, it was rebuilt in the present state with a façade and bell tower completed in 1892.

The interior has a Baroque decoration. In 1863, the sculptor Prudenzio Piccioli and the wood-engraver Giuseppe Tacconi worked together in the _Chapel of the Rosary_. Piccioli sculpted the statue of Saints Pope Pius V and Dominic, as well as reliefs with the Mysteries of the Rosary. Tacconi completed wood decoration. Giuseppe Obici completed a stucco _St John the Baptist_, submitted in 1852 as a model for a marble statue completed for Santa Maria sopra Minerva. From 1890 to 1915, the painter Augusto Valli frescoes a number of works in the church including a _Battle of Lepanto_ for the Chapel of the Rosary; a _Vision of the Apocalypse_ for the cupola; a _Communion of the Apostles_ for the half-dome of the apse; an _Annunciation and angels_ for the nave ceiling; as well as Popes and Saints linked to Spilamberto. He also painted five altarpieces including a _Glory of St Josephy_, _Ecce Agnus Dei_, _St Anne and the Virgin Mary as a Girl_, _Sacred Heart of Jesus_, and _St Anthony of Padua_.[1]
