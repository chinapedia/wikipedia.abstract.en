A-FRAME is an open-source web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences.[1] It is maintained by developers from Supermedium (Diego Marcos, Kevin Ngo) and Google (Don McCurdy). A-Frame is an entity component system framework for Three.js where developers can create 3D and WebVR scenes using HTML. HTML provides a familiar authoring tool for web developers and designers while incorporating a popular game development pattern used by engines such as Unity.


History

A-Frame was originally developed within the Mozilla VR team during mid-to-late 2015.[2] A-Frame was created in order to allow web developers and designers to author 3D and VR experiences[3] with HTML without having to know WebGL.[4] A-Frame's first public release was on December 16, 2015.[5] There are now over 256 contributors in total.[6]


Community

All online IDEs support A-Frame as a result of being based on HTML. Documentation is available for the API.[7] Support for developers committing to the library is provided via GitHub issues, while support for developers building apps and web pages is provided via StackOverflow.[8] Real-time on-line support is provided via Slack.[9] Most of the developers are also on Twitter.
