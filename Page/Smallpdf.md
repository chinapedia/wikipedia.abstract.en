Smallpdf was the first project founded under the company name IMMATERIAL (GmbH) in 2013. Immaterial changed its name to SMALLPDF (GmbH) in September 2016. The company headquarters are in Zurich.[4]


History

Smallpdf was founded in October 2013 by three friends (Mathis Buchi, Lino Teuterberg and Manuel Stofer) from Switzerland who got the idea to develop a PDF compression tool when they experienced challenges receiving important documents from home while traveling.[5] Using their collective skills in coding, design, business and marketing, the founders released a basic tool that compressed PDF files in Oct 2013. Since 2013, the company has introduced 14 digital document tools.[6]

The company has been bootstrapped since its inception, relying on initial investment from the founders, donations from the users and advertising sales to fund the development of the available tools.[7]

The company also generated revenue through third party software sales.[8]

In April 2016, Smallpdf released a premium service at a cost of $6 per month or $48 per year.[9]


About Smallpdf

Smallpdf offers SaaS[10] tools to both businesses and the general public via a freemium model:[11]

-   FREE - the software is free to use for anyone twice per hour[12]
-   PRO - unlimited access to the entire software package without waiting time to convert multiple documents[13]

Since its inception in 2013, Smallpdf has been completely self-funded. The founders developed the idea for the project after experiencing difficulty sending and receiving important documents while traveling abroad.[14]

Technical partners

Smallpdf partners with Solid Documents for PDF to Office libraries,[15] as well as with PDF tools.[16] Solid Documents is a New Zealand-based company offering desktop PDF solutions.


Current services

In 2014, Smallpdf released a function that allowed users to submit a PDF file that would be printed and sent via post to the desired recipient but they needed to be terminated as the demand for the service was too low.[17]
