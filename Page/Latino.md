_LATINO_ ()[1] is an Italian, Sicilian, Sardinian, Spanish, and Portuguese noun and adjective often used in the United States to refer to people with cultural ties to Latin America, in contrast to _Hispanic_ which is a demonym that includes Spaniards and other speakers of the Spanish language.[2][3][4][5]

"Latino" as a category used in the United States may be understood as a shorthand for the Spanish word _latinoamericano_ (Latin American in English) or the Portuguese phrase _latino americano_, thus excluding speakers of Spanish or Portuguese from Europe.[6] Both _Hispanic_ and _Latino_ are generally used to denote people living in the United States,[7][8] so much so that "Outside the United States, we don't speak of Latinos; we speak of Mexicans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and so forth."[9][10] In Latin America, the term _latino_ is not a common endonym and its usage in Spanish as a demonym is restricted to the Latin American-descended population of the United States.

The U.S. government Office of Management and Budget has defined _Hispanic or Latino_ people as "a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race".[11] The United States Census uses the ethnonym _Hispanic or Latino_ to refer to "a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race".[12] The Census Bureau also explains that "[o]rigin can be viewed as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person’s ancestors before their arrival in the United States. People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race."[13] Hence the U.S. Census and the OMB are using the terms differently. The U.S. Census and the OMB use the terms interchangeably, where both terms are synonyms. According to a study by the Pew Research Center, the majority (51%) of Hispanic and Latino Americans prefer to identify with their families' country of origin, while only 24% prefer the term _Hispanic_ or _Latino_.[14]

The _AP Stylebook_{{'}}s recommended usage of Latino in Latin America includes not only persons of Spanish-speaking ancestry, but also more generally includes persons "from – or whose ancestors were from – ... Latin America, including Brazilians". However, in the recent past, the term _Latinos_ was also applied to people from the Caribbean region,[15] but those from former Dutch and British colonies are excluded.[16]


Usage in Brazil

In a recent study, 79% of the Brazilian population identified themselves as "Brazilians" while 13% as "Citizens of the World" and only 4% as "Latino-Americanos".[17]


Usage in the United States

The term _Latino_ was officially adopted in 1997 by the United States Government in the ethnonym _Hispanic or Latino_, which replaced the single term _Hispanic_: "Because regional usage of the terms differs – Hispanic is commonly used in the eastern portion of the United States, whereas Latino is commonly used in the western portion."[18]

U.S. official use of the term "Hispanic" has its origins in the 1970 census. The Census Bureau attempted to identify all Hispanics by use of the following criteria in sampled sets:[19]

:* Spanish speakers and persons belonging to a household where Spanish was spoken

:* Persons with Spanish heritage by birth location

:* Persons who self-identify with Latin America, excluding Brazil

Neither "Hispanic" nor "Latino" refers to a race, as a person of Latino/Hispanic ethnicity can be of any race.[20][21] Like non-Latinos, a Latino can be of any race or combination of races: White American / Caucasian, Black / African American, Asian American, Native American / Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander American, or two or more ethnicities. While Brazilian Americans are not included with Hispanics and Latinos in the government's census population reports, any Brazilian American can report as being Hispanic or Latino since Hispanic or Latino origin is, like race or ethnicity, a matter of self-identification.[22][23]

Other federal and local government agencies and non-profit organizations include Brazilians and Portuguese in their definition of _Hispanic_. The U.S. Department of Transportation defines _Hispanic Americans_ as, "persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central or South American, or other Spanish or Portuguese culture or origin, regardless of race".[24] This definition has been adopted by the Small Business Administration as well as by many federal, state, and municipal agencies for the purposes of awarding government contracts to minority owned businesses. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Conference include representatives of Spanish and Portuguese descent. The Hispanic Society of America is dedicated to the study of the arts and cultures of Spain, Portugal, and Latin America. Each year since 1997 the International Latino Book Award is conferred to the best achievements in Spanish or Portuguese literature at BookExpo America, the largest publishing trade show in the United States. The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, which proclaims itself the champion of Hispanic success in higher education, has member institutions in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Latin America, Spain, and Portugal.

Some authorities of American English maintain a distinction between the terms "Hispanic" and "Latino":

  Though often used interchangeably in American English, _Hispanic_ and _Latino_ are not identical terms, and in certain contexts the choice between them can be significant. _Hispanic_, from the Latin word for "Spain," has the broader reference, potentially encompassing all Spanish-speaking peoples in both hemispheres and emphasizing the common denominator of language among communities that sometimes have little else in common. _Latino_—which in Spanish means "Latin" but which as an English word is probably a shortening of the Spanish word _latinoamericano_—refers more exclusively to persons or communities of Latin American origin. Of the two, only _Hispanic_ can be used in referring to Spain and its history and culture; a native of Spain residing in the United States is a _Hispanic_, not a _Latino_, and one cannot substitute _Latino_ in the phrase _the Hispanic influence on native Mexican cultures_ without garbling the meaning. In practice, however, this distinction is of little significance when referring to residents of the United States, most of whom are of Latin American origin and can theoretically be called by either word.[25]

The _AP Stylebook_ also distinguishes between the terms Hispanic and Latino. The Stylebook limits the term "Hispanic" to persons "from – or whose ancestors were from – a Spanish-speaking land or culture". It provides a more expansive definition, however, of the term "Latino". The Stylebook definition of Latino includes not only persons of Spanish-speaking ancestry, but also more generally includes persons "from – or whose ancestors were from – . . . Latin America". The Stylebook specifically lists "Brazilian" as an example of a group which can be considered Latino.

There were 28 categories tabulated in the 2000 United States Census: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican Republic; Central American: Costa Rican, Guatemalan, Honduran, Nicaraguan, Panamanian, Salvadoran, Other Central American; South American: Argentinian, Bolivian, Chilean, Colombian, Ecuadorian, Paraguayan, Peruvian, Uruguayan, Venezuelan, Other South American; Other Hispanic or Latino: Spaniard, Spanish, Spanish American, All other Hispanic or Latino.[26]


Similar and related terms

In English, "Latino" is used interchangeably with "Latin American". As an English demonym "Latin" has other meanings[27][28][29][30] such as:

-   an ancient Italic people entering the Italian peninsula around 1200 BCE
-   in ancient Rome an inhabitant of Old Latium (_Latium vetus_), later extended to New Latium (_Latium adiectum_) as well
-   a member of any population of the Roman Empire engaging in Roman culture and speaking Latin, regardless of their ethnicity
-   the language of Ancient Rome and the Roman Empire
-   denoting or pertaining to Italians, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanians, etc., using the Italic languages (Romance languages) that derive from Latin
-   a member of the Latin Church, or Roman Catholic Church.

Attempts have been made to introduce gender neutral language into Spanish by changing the ending of Latino. Terms like Latinx, Latin@, and Latine (which is both the Italian feminine plural form of "Latina" ("Latine" is pronounced "lah-TEE-nay" in Italian) and the French feminine gender case "Latine" ("Latine" is pronounced "lah-TEEN" in French)) are just a few examples of the various ways in which members of the Latino community have tried to be more inclusive of women and gender nonbinary individuals through language.

Latinx was first introduced in 2004 by members of the queer community online.[31]


Criticism

The use of the term _Latino_, despite its increasing popularity, is still highly debated among those who are called by the name.[32][33] Since the adoption of the term by the U.S. Census Bureau[34] and its subsequent widespread use, there have been several controversies and disagreements, especially in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries. Since it is an arbitrary generic term, many Latin American scholars, journalists, and indigenous rights organisations have objected to the mass media use of the word "Latino", pointing out that such ethnonyms are optional and should be used only to describe people involved in the practices, ideologies, and identity politics of their supporters.[35][36][37][38] Journalist Rodolfo Acuña writes:

  When and why the Latino identity came about is a more involved story. Essentially, politicians, the media, and marketers find it convenient to deal with the different U.S. Spanish-speaking people under one umbrella. However, many people with Spanish surnames contest the term _Latino_. They claim it is misleading because no Latino or Hispanic nationality exists since no Latino state exists, so generalizing the term _Latino_ slights the various national identities included under the umbrella.[39]
