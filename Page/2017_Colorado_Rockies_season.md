The 2017 COLORADO ROCKIES SEASON was the franchise's 25th in Major League Baseball. It was the 23rd season the Rockies played their home games at Coors Field. Bud Black became the new Rockies Manager after the resignation of Walt Weiss. Black in his first season was a finalist for the Manager-of-the -year award. The Rockies finished the season 87–75 in third place in the National League West Division, 17 games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers. They did, however, receive the second wild card spot in the National League and advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 2009. In the Wild Card Game, they lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks.

Regular season

Summary

The Rockies won their Opening Day game on April 3, defeating the Milwaukee Brewers, 7−5. Relief pitcher Greg Holland, making his Rockies debut, earned the save, his first save since September 17, 2015.[8]

Holland won the National League Reliever of the Month Award for April.[9]

On Mother's Day, Holland broke the franchise record of converting 16 consecutive saves to start a season, formerly held by José Jiménez, which he had set in 2002.[10]

For the month of May, Charlie Blackmon won his first MLB Player of the Month Award, for the National League. He led the NL in hits (42) and triples (five), was second in batting average (.359), fourth in runs scored (24), tied for fifth in RBI (22), and tied for seventh with a 1.037 OPS. Holland won his second consecutive NL Reliever of the Month Award, going for 20-for-20 in save opportunities, a 1.31 ERA and 0.82 WHIP through May.[11]

On June 18, 2017, Nolan Arenado hit for the cycle versus the San Francisco Giants. The home run was a walk off, securing a 7−5 win off Giants closer Mark Melancon. The 288th cycle in MLB history, it was the eighth by a Rockies player, and the 17th overall accomplished at Coors Field.[12] It was only the sixth time in MLB history that a cycle included a walk-off home run; Carlos González did the same on July 31, 2010, versus the Chicago Cubs.[13]

During the June 28 game versus the Giants, Arenado knocked down a line drive batted by pitcher Ty Blach as he was facing third base, spun on his stomach, and, without getting up on his feet, threw out Blach at first base.[14]

Arenado set career-highs with three home runs and five hits, while tying a career-high seven RBI in an 18–4 rout of the San Diego Padres on July 19.[15] He tied the franchise record held by Jeff Cirillo and Todd Walker for the number of total bases in a single game with 14, and became the first player in Rockies history to reach both three home runs and five hits in a single game. He also became the first player in the majors to reach 80 RBI. Named NL Player of the Week for the fourth time of his career on July 23, Arenado hit .458/.480/1.000 with four home runs and 13 RBI in five games.[16] He later won NL Player of the Month Award for July, his second career monthly award, after hitting .389/.423/.744 with eight home runs, 35 hits, 15 extra base hits, 30 RBIs and 18 runs scored in 22 games.[17]

With a two-run home run versus José Ureña of the Miami Marlins on August 11, Arenado became the first major leaguer of 2017 to reach 100 RBI, doing so in 112 games. He had batted .441 and 77 RBI with runners in scoring position (RISP).[18]

On September 16 versus the Padres, Arenado drove in his 125th run of the season, becoming the first third baseman and first Rockies player to do so in three consecutive seasons.[19] Later that September, he became the 11th player in major league history to drive in 130 or more runs in three successive seasons.[20] Writing for _The Sporting News,_ Joe Rivera noted that per Fangraphs Arenado was the fourth player in history to net at least 100 defensive runs saved within his first five seasons (103).[21]

On September 29, 2017, Blackmon homered versus Hyun-Jin Ryu of the Los Angeles Dodgers to reach 102 RBI, surpassing Darin Erstad in 2000 for the major league record of RBI by a leadoff hitter in one season.[22][23]
