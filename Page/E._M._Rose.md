_The Murder of William of Norwich_

Roseâ€™s first book, _The Murder of William of Norwich: The Origins of the Blood Libel in Medieval Europe_, published by Oxford University Press in 2015[3] was reviewed[4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] as a landmark[15] in the study of the history of the Blood libel, as the first detailed, academic investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of William of Norwich, the historical incident to which the Blood libel can be traced.

_The Murder of William of Norwich_ was recognized as a "Top Ten Book in History" by _The Sunday Times_ (London)[16] and received the 2016 Ralph Waldo Emerson Award of the Phi Beta Kappa Society for "a scholarly study that contributes significantly to interpretation of the intellectual and cultural condition of humanity.[17]"
