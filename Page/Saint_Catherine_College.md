SAINT CATHERINE COLLEGE was founded in 1905 by the Society of Jesus on Florian贸polis island off the coast of Brazil, at the request of the Santa Catarina state governor at the time. It is maintained by the Ant么nio Vieira Society.[1]


Chronology

Jesuits reopened a school on the Island on 25 September 1845, with an opening class of 30 students. After three years at the Provincial house they received their own building at Getulio Vargas Square, including boarding facilities. In 1854 over half the Jesuits fell victim to yellow fever and the school was closed until 1865 when it reopened under the name College of the Holy Savior, with 110 students.

When the Conservative party took over from the Liberal Party in 1871, they withdrew government support from the Jesuits and the College. It was not until 1905 that the College reopened under the name of Saint Catherine Gymnasium. This received support from President Vidal Ramos of the state of Santa Catarina and from the Ant么nio Vieira Society. Classes resumed in 1906. In 1915 the gymnasium was officially granted status as a college[2] and was named Colegio Catarinense by presidential decree in January 1943.[3] From its founding until 1963 the College had a boarding facility for students from other cities. In 1970 the College began to admit girls. In 1972 Saint Catherine College was integrated into the State System of Education.[4]

Since 1998 the College offers full high school scholarships to needy students in Florian贸polis, with a night school program that has grown to accommodate 422 students.[5] Between 1999 and 2000 classes were extended to include kindergarten through grade four. From 2006 elementary school was extended to nine years, in accord with federal law.
