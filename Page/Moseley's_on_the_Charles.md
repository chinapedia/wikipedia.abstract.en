MOSELEYâ€™S ON THE CHARLES, located on the banks of the Charles River in Dedham, Massachusetts, is the oldest continuous-running ballroom in the country.[1][2] Founded in 1905 by Elisha Moseley,[3] it originally functioned as a summer canoe house in addition to the ballroom.[4]

Duke Ellington's Washingtonians,[5] Harry James, Les Brown, Buddy Rich, The Platters, Lenny Clark, Pat Cooper, and Steve Sweeney have all performed in the hall.[6][7] Each December it hosts the annual meeting of The Society in Dedham for Apprehending Horse Thieves.[8]

In 1998 it was purchased by Edward DeVincenzo, who began working in the coatroom years before.[9]
