KENDRA COULTER (born 1979) is a Canadian labour studies scholar with a background in anthropology who is currently an associate professor at the Centre for Labour Studies at Brock University. She is the author of _Revolutionizing Retail: Workers, Political Action, and Social Change_ (2014) and _Animals, Work, & the Promise of Interspecies Solidarity_ (2016). In the latter book, Coulter develops the concepts of interspecies solidarity and humane jobs.


Career

Coulter was trained as an anthropologist, studying at the University of Western Ontario, from which she graduated with a BA in 2002, and the University of Toronto.[1][2] Her doctoral thesis, _Chameleons, Chimeras and Shape-Shifters: The Production of Neoliberal Government in Ontario_, was successfully defended at Toronto in May 2007.[3] After graduation, she worked for a time in Sociology & Anthropology at the University of Windsor.[4] She then went on to Centre for Labour Studies, Brock University, where she is currently an associate professor.[5] While at Brock, Coulter published her first book, the collection _Governing Cultures: Anthropological Perspectives on Political Labor, Power, and Government_, which she co-edited with William R. Schumann. _Governing Cultures_ was published in 2012 by Palgrave Macmillan.[6]

Coulter's first monograph, _Revolutionizing Retail: Workers, Political Action, and Social Change_ was published in 2014 by Palgrave Macmillan. The book explores the retail sector, examining how the lives of workers in the industry can be transformed. She first examines the nature of retail work, and then looks to the successes and promise of retail unions in changing workers' lives and situations. Coulter then considers retail more broadly, examining a range of possible avenues for political change. Amanda Pyman, who reviewed the book for _Times Higher Education_, said that it was "Essential reading for all employment relations scholars ... Coulter should be commended for this valuable contribution to what is still, despite the prominence of retail in global economies, an understudied sector. In the process, she offers a valuable reminder of the importance of workers' struggles in organising for social change."[7][8] _Revolutionising Retail_ was awarded the 2015 Canadian Association for Work and Labour Studies book prize.[9]

In her second monograph, 2016's _Animals, Work, & the Promise of Interspecies Solidarity_, Coulter examines the work people do with animals as well as the work done by animals, drawing upon a range of theoretical perspectives including feminist political economy. In both labour studies and human-animal studies, Coulter argues, the work done by and for animals has been underexplored. Coulter not only explores these topics, arguing that animals' work should be recognised as such, but critically engages with them, offering alternative ways to conceptualise the place of animals in the workplace and society, with a focus on improving lives and alleviating suffering. She calls for an interspecies solidarity, and the development of humane jobs.[10][11][12] On the website of her Humane Jobs project, Coulter writes that "There are compelling ethical and environmental reasons to move the workforce away from damaging patterns and towards more sustainable and positive practices and employment sectors. We can and should create humane jobs."[13]

In 2017, in recognition of her research achievements, Coulter was one of the 70 academics chosen to become a member of the Royal Society of Canada's College of New Scholars, Artists and Scientists.[14][15] In the same year, she was awarded the Brock University Chancellor's Chair for Research Excellence, which recognises her "outstanding contributions in her field and encourages her position as a path-breaking scholar in research about animals".[16]
