An AUTOBIOGRAPHY (from the Greek, αὐτός-_autos_ self + βίος-_bios_ life + γράφειν-_graphein_ to write) is a self-written account of the life of oneself. The word "autobiography" was first used deprecatingly by William Taylor in 1797 in the English periodical _The Monthly Review_, when he suggested the word as a hybrid, but condemned it as "pedantic". However, its next recorded use was in its present sense, by Robert Southey in 1809.[1] Despite only being named early in the nineteenth century, first-person autobiographical writing originates in antiquity. Roy Pascal differentiates autobiography from the periodic self-reflective mode of journal or diary writing by noting that "[autobiography] is a review of a life from a particular moment in time, while the diary, however reflective it may be, moves through a series of moments in time".[2] Autobiography thus takes stock of the autobiographer's life from the moment of composition. While biographers generally rely on a wide variety of documents and viewpoints, autobiography may be based entirely on the writer's memory. The memoir form is closely associated with autobiography but it tends, as Pascal claims, to focus less on the self and more on others during the autobiographer's review of his or her life.[3]


Biography

Life

Autobiographical works are by nature subjective. The inability—or unwillingness—of the author to accurately recall memories has in certain cases resulted in misleading or incorrect information. Some sociologists and psychologists have noted that autobiography offers the author the ability to recreate history.

Spiritual autobiography

Spiritual autobiography is an account of an author's struggle or journey towards God, followed by conversion a religious conversion, often interrupted by moments of regression. The author re-frames his or her life as a demonstration of divine intention through encounters with the Divine. The earliest example of a spiritual autobiography is Augustine's _Confessions_ though the tradition has expanded to include other religious traditions in works such as Zahid Rohari's _An Autobiography_ and _Black Elk Speaks_. The spiritual autobiography works as an endorsement of his or her religion.

Memoirs

A memoir is slightly different in character from an autobiography. While an autobiography typically focuses on the "life and times" of the writer, a memoir has a narrower, more intimate focus on his or her own memories, feelings and emotions. Memoirs have often been written by politicians or military leaders as a way to record and publish an account of their public exploits. One early example is that of Julius Caesar's _Commentarii de Bello Gallico_, also known as _Commentaries on the Gallic Wars_. In the work, Caesar describes the battles that took place during the nine years that he spent fighting local armies in the Gallic Wars. His second memoir, _Commentarii de Bello Civili_ (or _Commentaries on the Civil War_) is an account of the events that took place between 49 and 48 BC in the civil war against Gnaeus Pompeius and the Senate.

Leonor López de Córdoba (1362–1420) wrote what is supposed to be the first autobiography in Spanish. The English Civil War (1642–1651) provoked a number of examples of this genre, including works by Sir Edmund Ludlow and Sir John Reresby. French examples from the same period include the memoirs of Cardinal de Retz (1614–1679) and the Duc de Saint-Simon.

Fictional autobiography

The term "fictional autobiography" signifies novels about a fictional character written as though the character were writing their own autobiography, meaning that the character is the first-person narrator and that the novel addresses both internal and external experiences of the character. Daniel Defoe's _Moll Flanders_ is an early example. Charles Dickens' _David Copperfield_ is another such classic, and J.D. Salinger's _The Catcher in the Rye_ is a well-known modern example of fictional autobiography. Charlotte Brontë's _Jane Eyre_ is yet another example of fictional autobiography, as noted on the front page of the original version. The term may also apply to works of fiction purporting to be autobiographies of real characters, e.g., Robert Nye's _Memoirs of Lord Byron_.


Autobiography through the ages

The classical period: Apologia, oration, confession

In antiquity such works were typically entitled _apologia,_ purporting to be self-justification rather than self-documentation. John Henry Newman's Christian confessional work (first published in 1864) is entitled _Apologia Pro Vita Sua_ in reference to this tradition.

The Jewish historian Flavius Josephus introduces his autobiography (_Josephi Vita_, c. 99) with self-praise, which is followed by a justification of his actions as a Jewish rebel commander of Galilee.[4]

The pagan rhetor Libanius (c. 314–394) framed his life memoir (_Oration I_ begun in 374) as one of his orations, not of a public kind, but of a literary kind that could not be aloud in privacy.

Augustine (354–430) applied the title _Confessions_ to his autobiographical work, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau used the same title in the 18th century, initiating the chain of confessional and sometimes racy and highly self-critical, autobiographies of the Romantic era and beyond. Augustine's was arguably the first Western autobiography ever written, and became an influential model for Christian writers throughout the Middle Ages. It tells of the hedonistic lifestyle Augustine lived for a time within his youth, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits; his following and leaving of the anti-sex and anti-marriage Manichaeism in attempts to seek sexual morality; and his subsequent return to Christianity due to his embracement of Skepticism and the New Academy movement (developing the view that sex is good, and that virginity is better, comparing the former to silver and the latter to gold; Augustine's views subsequently strongly influenced Western theology[5]). _Confessions_ will always rank among the great masterpieces of western literature.[6]

In the spirit of Augustine's _Confessions_ is the 12th-century _Historia Calamitatum_ of Peter Abelard, outstanding as an autobiographical document of its period.

Early autobiographies

Baburnama.jpg'']]

In the 15th century, Leonor López de Córdoba, a Spanish noblewoman, wrote her _Memorias_, which may be the first autobiography in Castillian.

Zāhir ud-Dīn Mohammad Bābur, who founded the Mughal dynasty of South Asia kept a journal _Bāburnāma_ (Chagatai/; literally: _"Book of Babur"_ or _"Letters of Babur"_) which was written between 1493 and 1529.

One of the first great autobiographies of the Renaissance is that of the sculptor and goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini (1500–1571), written between 1556 and 1558, and entitled by him simply _Vita_ (Italian: _Life_). He declares at the start: "No matter what sort he is, everyone who has to his credit what are or really seem great achievements, if he cares for truth and goodness, ought to write the story of his own life in his own hand; but no one should venture on such a splendid undertaking before he is over forty."[7] These criteria for autobiography generally persisted until recent times, and most serious autobiographies of the next three hundred years conformed to them.

Another autobiography of the period is _De vita propria_, by the Italian mathematician, physician and astrologer Gerolamo Cardano (1574).

It is often claimed that the earliest known autobiography in English is the early 15th-century _Book of Margery Kempe_, describing among other things Kempe's pilgrimage to the Holy Land and visit to Rome although it is, at best, only a partial autobiography and arguably more a memoir of religious experiences. The book remained in manuscript and was not published until 1936.

Possibly the first publicly available autobiography written in English was Captain John Smith's autobiography published in 1630[8] which was regarded by many as not much more than a collection of tall tales told by someone of doubtful veracity. This changed with the publication of Philip Barbour's definitive biography in 1964 which, amongst other things, established independent factual bases for many of Smith's "tall tales", many of which could not have been known by Smith at the time of writing unless he was actually present at the events recounted.[9]

Other notable English autobiographies of the 17th century include those of Lord Herbert of Cherbury (1643, published 1764) and John Bunyan (_Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners_, 1666).

Jarena Lee (1783–1864) was the first African American woman to have a published biography in the United States.[10]

18th and 19th centuries

Following the trend of Romanticism, which greatly emphasized the role and the nature of the individual, and in the footsteps of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's _Confessions_, a more intimate form of autobiography, exploring the subject's emotions, came into fashion. Stendhal's autobiographical writings of the 1830s, _The Life of Henry Brulard_ and _Memoirs of an Egotist_, are both avowedly influenced by Rousseau.[11] An English example is William Hazlitt's _Liber Amoris_ (1823), a painful examination of the writer's love-life.

With the rise of education, cheap newspapers and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop, and the beneficiaries of this were not slow to cash in on this by producing autobiographies. It became the expectation—rather than the exception—that those in the public eye should write about themselves—not only writers such as Charles Dickens (who also incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and Anthony Trollope, but also politicians (e.g. Henry Brooks Adams), philosophers (e.g. John Stuart Mill), churchmen such as Cardinal Newman, and entertainers such as P. T. Barnum. Increasingly, in accordance with romantic taste, these accounts also began to deal, amongst other topics, with aspects of childhood and upbringing—far removed from the principles of "Cellinian" autobiography.

20th and 21st centuries

From the 17th century onwards, "scandalous memoirs" by supposed libertines, serving a public taste for titillation, have been frequently published. Typically pseudonymous, they were (and are) largely works of fiction written by ghostwriters. So-called "autobiographies" of modern professional athletes and media celebrities—and to a lesser extent about politicians—generally written by a ghostwriter, are routinely published. Some celebrities, such as Naomi Campbell, admit to not having read their "autobiographies". Some sensationalist autobiographies such as James Frey's _A Million Little Pieces_ have been publicly exposed as having embellished or fictionalized significant details of the authors' lives.

Autobiography has become an increasingly popular and widely accessible form. _A Fortunate Life_ by Albert Facey (1979) has become an Australian literary classic.[12] With the critical and commercial success in the United States of such memoirs as _Angela’s Ashes_ and _The Color of Water_, more and more people have been encouraged to try their hand at this genre. Maggie Nelson's book _The Argonauts_ is one of the recent autobiographies. Maggie Nelson calls it "autotheory"—a combination of autobiography and critical theory.[13]

A genre where the "claim for truth" overlaps with fictional elements though the work still purports to be autobiographical is autofiction.
