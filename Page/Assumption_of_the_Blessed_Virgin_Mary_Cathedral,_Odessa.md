The ASSUMPTION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY CATHEDRAL [1] ( ) also called CATHEDRAL OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY is the name given to a religious building belonging to the Catholic Church and is located in the city of Odessa in the west part of European country of Ukraine.[2]

The temple follows the Roman or Latin rite and was built between 1844 and 1853 thanks to the efforts of Catholics from Poland and Germany and the initiative of Father Grzegorza Razutowicza, designed by Polish architect Feliksa GÄ…siorowskiego with the help of Italian architect Francesco Morandi.

The church was built as a three-aisled basilica with a dome selected cruise on a cruciform plan. Inside white and gray marble were used. In the painting of the main altar is an image of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in 1850 which is a copy of Raphael. The interior is adorned with many valuable paintings and large crystal chandeliers. Pope Pius IX donated to the church in 1852 marble baptismal font. Next to the church an orphanage, a nursing home, a Catholic school and a shelter for children was built.
