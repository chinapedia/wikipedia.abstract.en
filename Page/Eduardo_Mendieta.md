Education and career

Mendieta earned his BA in Philosophy at Rutgers University, his MA in Systematic Theology at Union Theological Seminary, and his PhD in Philosophy at the New School for Social Research.[10] He was assistant professor of Philosophy at the University of San Francisco from 1995 to 2001 before moving to Stony Brook University, where he served as Director of the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Center from 2005 to 2008 and chair of the Department of Philosophy from 2012 to 2015.[11] He also held visiting positions at the Universidad Iberoamericana and the European Humanities University.

Research

Mendieta has investigated topics including animal rights, colonialism, globalization, mass incarceration, and torture, often by building on the conceptual resources of Frankfurt School-style Critical Theory. His publications include _The Adventures of Transcendental Philosophy: Karl-Otto Apel's Semiotics and Discourse Ethics_ (2002), _Global Fragments: Globalizations, Latinamericanisms, and Critical Theory_ (2007), and _The Philosophical Animal: On Zoopoetics and Interspecies Cosmopolitanism_ (forthcoming).[15][16] _Global Fragments_ has been described as an "important" contribution to ways of thinking about globalization that are "too often ignored in Western European and North American philosophy."[17] _Abolition Democracy: Beyond Empire, Torture and War_ (2006) is a series of interviews between Mendieta and Angela Davis on mass incarceration and torture, which was praised as "a much needed political intervention in mainstream discourse about the Abu Ghraib case."[18] He has also translated the work of Enrique Dussel and Karl-Otto Apel, and co-edited _The Power of Religion in the Public Sphere_ (2011), _Reading Kant’s Geography_ (2011), and _Habermas and Religion_ (2013).[19][20]

Mendieta has also been interviewed about the challenges and opportunities facing Latino/as in contemporary academic philosophy.[21]
