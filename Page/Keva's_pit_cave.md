KEVA'S PIT CAVE (croatian: _Kevina jama_) is pit cave in village Radošić in municipality Lećevica, part of Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia.

This pit cave is infamous for its historical value: during and after World War II, Yugoslav Partisans used this pit cave for disposing bodies of local fascist and Italian soldiers.

Pit cave has funnel form, which, on the widest part, is about 35 meters wide. In the middle of the pit cave there is carbonated "skittle" made of limestone and other materials of karst.

On 22 August 2015, a European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism, a county commemoration for victims of all anti-fascistic and communistic crimes in Croatia was held here.
