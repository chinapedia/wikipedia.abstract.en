ABRAHAM J. ISSERMAN (May 11, 1900 â€“ April 22, 1988) was an American lawyer and activist who defended Gerhart Eisler in 1947 and CPUSA leaders in the Foley Square trial (1949): he was found in contempt of court by Judge Harold Medina, sentenced to four months in jail (1952), and disbarred.[1][2]


Background

Isserman was born on May 11, 1900, in Belgium.[3]


Career

Abraham J. Isserman and Morris Isserman were private attorneys at Isserman & Isserman, 24 Commerce Street, Newark, New Jersey.[4][5]

His clients included Edith Berkman, the New Jersey chapter of the Congress of Industrial Organizations,[6] and the union called the American Newspaper Guild.[7]

In the 1930s through 1941, he served as counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union.[8]

"Communist lawyer"

In 1939, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) reported that Isserman was a member of the national committee of the International Juridical Association, a communist-leaning group co-founded by Carol Weiss King and Shad Polier among others.[11][12][13]

In 1939, ACLU chief Roger Nash Baldwin asked Isserman to prepare a legal brief on whether witnesses could invoke the Fifth Amendment to help witnesses called before the Dies Committee (predecessor to HUAC).[14]

In April 1943, Walter Gellhorn, then New York Regional Attorney and Assistant General Counsel (later professor of law at Columbia University, also brother of photographer Martha Gellhorn) testified before HUAC as follows:

  Mr. MATTHEWS: Do you know Abraham J. Isserman?
  Mr. GELLHORN: Yes.
  Mr. MATTHEWS: Do you have any personal views on whether Mr. Isserman is a Communist or a communist sympathizer?
  Mr. GELLHORN: I imagine the latter. I have no information on the former. I know him to be a competent attorney. I have consulted with him on one or two labor matters.[15]

Gerhart Eisler trial

In 1947, with Carol Weiss King, Isserman defended Gerhart Eisler in a trial for fraudulent passport.[16] (The Federal government believed that the full "Eisler defense committee included: Max Bedacht, Dr. Felix Boenheim, Charles Collins, Eugene P. Connolly, Gustav Faber, Ida Guggenheimer, Isserman, King, Albert Maltz, and Walter Mueller.[17])

In the press, Eisler had been accused of being a mastermind for Soviet spies in the United States. On February 17, 1947, _Life (magazine)_ magazine ran "The Career of Gerhart Eisler as a Comintern Agent" whose subtext read "Prototyp of a professional, Moscow-schooled revolutionary, he is now charged with conspiracy against the government of the U.S."[18]

During proceedings, Isserman stated, "I charge that this whole procedure is in bad faither and savors to me of something more."[19]

Eisler skipped bail and left the country by means of a Polish freighter.[20]

In 1949, the court removed Eisler v. United States, 338 U.S. 189, from the docket, pending return of the fugitive Eisler.[21]

The other three attorneys were Richard Gladstein, Louis F. McCabe, and George W. Crockett, Jr.[22][23] (Sometimes, Isserman is cited as chief counsel.[24]) Isserman was representing Gil Green and John Williamson.[25]

During appeal of the conviction, Isserman and colleagues accused trial judge Harold R. Medina of improperly favoring the prosecution. The defendants lost their appeal and went to prison.[26]

Contempt, Disbarment

Further, Isserman and Crockett among other defense attorneys was found in contempt of court. In 1952, Isserman went to jail for four months, despite support from groups like the National Lawyers Guild.[27][28]

In 1954, he was disbarred from law practice in the State of New Jersey.[29][30]

Following a 1953 order, he was also disbarred from the U.S. Supreme Court (In re Isserman, 348 U.S. 1 1954).[31]

Restoration

In 1961, New Jersey's Supreme Court voided the disbarment and had his license restored.[32]


Personal and death

On April 22, 1988, Isserman died in a nursing home in New York City after several strokes.[33]

Maurice Isserman is his nephew.
