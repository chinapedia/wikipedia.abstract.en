CLARENCE LEON BROWN (May 10, 1890 – August 17, 1987) was an American film director.[1]


Early life

Born in Clinton, Massachusetts, to Larkin Harry Brown, a cotton manufacturer, and Katherine Ann Brown (née Gaw), Brown moved to Tennessee when he was 11 years old. He attended Knoxville High School[2] and the University of Tennessee, both in Knoxville, Tennessee, graduating from the university at the age of 19 with two degrees in engineering.[3] An early fascination in automobiles led Brown to a job with the Stevens-Duryea Company, then to his own Brown Motor Car Company in Alabama.[4] He later abandoned the car dealership after developing an interest in motion pictures around 1913. He was hired by the Peerless Studio at Fort Lee, New Jersey, and became an assistant to the French-born director Maurice Tourneur.[5]


Career

After serving in World War I, Brown was given his first co-directing credit (with Tourneur) for _The Great Redeemer_ (1920). Later that year, he directed a major portion of _The Last of the Mohicans_ after Tourneur was injured in a fall.

Brown moved to Universal in 1924, and then to MGM, where he stayed until the mid-1950s. At MGM he was one of the main directors of their female stars; he directed Joan Crawford six times and Greta Garbo seven.

He was nominated five times (see below) for the Academy Award as a director and once as a producer, but he never received an Oscar. However, he won Best Foreign Film for _Anna Karenina_, starring Garbo at the 1935 Venice International Film Festival.[6]

Brown's films gained a total of 38 Academy Award nominations and earned nine Oscars. Brown himself received six Academy Award nominations and in 1949, he won the British Academy Award for the film version of William Faulkner's ''Intruder in the Dust.

In 1957, Brown was awarded The George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.[7] Brown retired a wealthy man due to his real estate investments, but refused to watch new movies, as he feared they might cause him to restart his career.

The Clarence Brown Theater, on the campus of the University of Tennessee, is named in his honor.[8] He holds the record for most nominations for the Academy Award for Best Director without a win, with six.[9]


Personal life

Clarence Brown was married four times. His first marriage was to Paul Herndon Pratt in 1913, which lasted until their divorce in 1920.[10] The couple produced a daughter, Adrienne Brown, in 1917.[11]

His second marriage was to Ona Wilson, which lasted from 1922 until their divorce in 1927.[12]

He was engaged to Dorothy Sebastian[13] and Mona Maris, although he did not marry either of them, with Maris later saying she ended their relationship because she had her "own ideas of marriage then." [14]

He married his third wife, Alice Joyce, in 1933 and they divorced in 1945.[15][16]

His last marriage was to Marian Spies in 1946, which lasted until his death in 1987.[17]


Death

Brown died at the Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California from kidney failure on August 17, 1987, at the age of 97.[18] He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.[19]

On February 8, 1960, Brown received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1752 Vine Street, for his contributions to the motion pictures industry[20][21]
