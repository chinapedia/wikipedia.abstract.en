NASTASSJA AGLAIA KINSKI (born 24 January 1961)[1][2] is a German actress and former model who has appeared in more than 60 films in Europe and the United States. Her worldwide breakthrough was with _Stay as You Are_ (1978). She then came to global prominence with her Golden Globe Award-winning performance as the title character in the Roman Polanski-directed film _Tess_ (1979). Other notable films in which she acted include the erotic horror film _Cat People_ (1982), the Wim Wenders dramas _Paris, Texas_ (1984) and _Faraway, So Close!_ (1993), and the biographical drama film _An American Rhapsody_ (2001). Kinski is fluent in four languages: German, English, French and Italian.


Early life

Kinski was born in West Berlin as Nastassja Aglaia Nakszynski.[3] She is the daughter of renowned German actor Klaus Kinski[4] and his second wife, actress Ruth Brigitte Tocki.[5] She is of partial Polish descent, for her grandfather Bruno Nakszynski was a Germanized ethnic Pole.[6] Kinski has two half-siblings; Pola and Nikolai Kinski. Her parents divorced in 1968. After the age of 10, Kinski rarely saw her father. Her mother struggled financially to support them;[7] they eventually lived in a commune in Munich.

In a 1999 interview, Kinski denied that her father had molested her as a child, but said he had abused her "in other ways".[8] In 2013, when interviewed about the allegations of sexual abuse made by her half-sister Pola Kinski,[9][10] she confirmed that he attempted with her, but did not succeed. She said:


Career

Kinski began working as a model as a teenager in Germany. Actress Lisa Kreuzer of the German New Wave helped get her the role of the mute Mignon in Wim Wenders 1975 film _The Wrong Move_,[11] in which at the age of 12 she was depicted topless.[12][13] She later played one of the leading roles in Wenders' film _Paris, Texas_ (1984) and appeared in his _Faraway, So Close_ (1993).

In 1976, while still a teenager, Kinski had her first two major roles: in Wolfgang Petersen's feature film-length episode _Reifezeugnis_ of the German TV crime series _Tatort._ Next, she appeared in the British horror film _To the Devil a Daughter_ (1976), produced by Hammer Film Productions, which was released in the UK just 40 days after Kinski's fifteenth birthday, making it a virtual certainty she was only fourteen when her scenes were shot (including full frontal nudity). In regards to her early films, Kinski has stated that she felt exploited by the industry. In an interview with _W_, she said, "If I had had somebody to protect me or if I had felt more secure about myself, I would not have accepted certain things. Nudity things. And inside it was just tearing me apart."[14]

In 1978, Kinski starred in the Italian romance _Stay as You Are_ (_Così come sei_) with Marcello Mastroianni, gaining her recognition in the United States after New Line Cinema released it there in December 1979. _Time_ wrote that she was "simply ravishing, genuinely sexy and high-spirited without being painfully aggressive about it."[15] The film also received a major international release from Columbia Pictures.

Kinski met the director Roman Polanski at a party in 1976.[16] He urged her to study method acting with Lee Strasberg in the United States and she was offered the title role in Polanski's upcoming film, _Tess_ (1979). In 1978, Kinski underwent extensive preparation for the portrayal of an English peasant girl, which included acquiring a Dorset accent through elocution studies:

In 1981, Richard Avedon photographed Kinski with a Burmese python coiled around her nude body.[17] The image, which first appeared in the October 1981 issue of US _Vogue_, was released as a poster and became a best-seller, further confirming her status as a sex symbol.[18]

In 1982, she starred in Francis Ford Coppola's romantic musical _One from the Heart_, her first film made in the United States.[19] _Texas Monthly_ described her as acting "as a Felliniesque circus performer to represent the twinkling evanescence of Eros."[20] The film failed at the box office and was a major loss for Coppola's new Zoetrope Studios. That year, she was also in the erotic horror movie _Cat People_. Dudley Moore's comedy _Unfaithfully Yours_ and an adaptation of John Irving's _The Hotel New Hampshire_ followed in 1984.

Kinski reteamed with Wenders for the 1984 film _Paris, Texas_. One of her most acclaimed films to date, it won the top award at the Cannes Film Festival. Throughout the 1980s, Kinski split her time between Europe and the United States, making _Moon in the Gutter_ (1983), _Harem_ (1985) and _Torrents of Spring_ (1989) in Europe, and _Exposed_ (1983), _Maria's Lovers_ (1984), and _Revolution_ (1985) in the United States.

During the 1990s, Kinski appeared in a number of American films, including the action movie _Terminal Velocity_ opposite Charlie Sheen, the Mike Figgis 1997 adultery tale _One Night Stand_, _Your Friends & Neighbors_ (1998), John Landis's _Susan's Plan_ (1998), and _The Lost Son_ (1999).[21]

Her most recent films include David Lynch's _Inland Empire_ (2006) and Rotimi Rainwater's _Sugar_ (2013). In 2016, she competed in the German _Let's Dance_ show.[22]


Personal life

Relationships

In 1976, when Kinski was aged 15, she reportedly began a romantic relationship with director Roman Polanski, who at the time was 43.[23][24][25][26][27] In a 1999 interview in _The Guardian_, she was quoted as saying that there was no affair and that, "There was a flirtation. There could have been a seduction, but there was not. He had respect for me."[28]

Marriage and children

In the mid-1980s, Kinski met the Egyptian filmmaker Ibrahim Moussa. They married on 10 September 1984. They have two children together; a son Aljosha (born 1984),[29] and daughter (born 1986), who works as a model and actress. The marriage was dissolved in 1992. From 1992 until 1995, Kinski lived with musician Quincy Jones, though she kept her own apartment on Hilgard Avenue, near UCLA, at the time.[30] In 1993, they had a daughter, Kenya Julia Niambi Sarah Jones,[31] a model known professionally as Kenya Kinski-Jones.[32]

Health

In 2001, Kinski stated in an interview in _The Daily Telegraph_ that she was affected by the sleep disorder narcolepsy.[33]
