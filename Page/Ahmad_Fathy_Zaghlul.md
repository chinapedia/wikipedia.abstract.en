AHMAD FATHY ZAGHLUL (1863–1914) was an Egyptian nationalist lawyer and politician. The brother of Saad Zaghloul, Fathy Zahlul studied law in Paris and wrote several law texts. He had several administrative and government posts, and at one point was Deputy Minister of Justice.

In 1906 he was amongst the Egyptian judges at the summary trial for the Denshawai Incident, which damaged his popular reputation in Egypt.[1]

An anti-populist liberal, Fathy Zaghlul also translated several works of European social science into Arabic,[2] including _À quoi tient la supériorité des Anglo-Saxons?_ by Edmond Demolins.[3] A translation of Herbert Spencer's _The Man Versus the State_ was left unfinished and unpublished at his death.[4]
