Literary works

Smith's poems have appeared in literary journals across the country, including _Ploughshares_, _Antioch Review_, _Callaloo_, _Transition_, _River Styx_, and _Quiddity_. Smith's poems have been nominated for the Pushcart Prize and the _Sundress Best of the Net Anthology_.[4][5] His poem _Parted_ has been featured in the magazine Fjords Review.[6] He has published three collections of poetry: _A Mandala of Hands_ (2015), _Soul Be A Witness_ (2016) and _Spirits of the Gods_ (2017).[7]

About _A Mandala of Hands_, Terrance Hayes, a winner of the National Book Award for Poetry, has written: "John Warner Smith’s terrific debut collection pays homage to histories near and far, familial and mythic. Neighbors become ancestors, ancestors become neighbors offering the “songs we never heard,” the songs we have yet to sing in these rich poems. Smith writes with an anthropologist’s precision and a griot’s reverence as he revives, recovers and reimagines the voices that unite us. _A Mandala of Hands_ is a mature and magical new book."[8]

About _Soul Be A Witness_, Thomas Sayers Ellis, winner of the 2005 Whiting Award, wrote: "This is how you upright Richard Wright. Redressed as courageous and urgent contemporary command, Soul Be A Witness carefully balances and re-injects the nutrient-like echoes of the Black Literary Tradition into our current state of soft, staged, formal phony literary legacy––as Heroic savior text and Neo Blue Print for New Black Fighting. For every stone history has cast at us, _Soul Be A Witness_ casts three back in pure “Don’t Get It Twisted” fashion."[9]
