CANNABIS IN MALAYSIA is illegal. Malaysian legislation provides for a mandatory death penalty for convicted drug traffickers. Individuals arrested in possession of 200Â grams (seven ounces) of marijuana are presumed by law to be trafficking in drugs. Individuals arrested in possession of 50 grams (1,5 ounces) or less will be sentenced to imprisonment up to 10 years.[1]


History

Following the British acquisition of Dutch Malacca, by 1826 the British were raising taxes from the production of bhang.[2]

Cannabis restrictions in Malaysia date as far back as the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance 1952 in British Malaya prior to independence.[3]


Reform

In 2018, public outrage over a death penalty handed to a 29-year-old man led Malaysia to discuss legalising cannabis for medical use, which could make them one of the first nations in Asia to do so. The Malaysian cabinet also discussed the medicinal value of marijuana in a September 2018 meeting and started early and informal talks on amending the relevant laws.[4][5]
