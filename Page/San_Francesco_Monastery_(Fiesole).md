The MONASTERY OF ST. FRANCIS () is a Franciscan monastery located in the western, historic center of Fiesole in the region of Tuscany.

Located on Via San Francesco, it is not far from the Cathedral of Saint Romulus and the former Basilica of St. Alex.


History

A small hermitage was built in 1399 on the site of the current monastery by the Franciscans. At the end of the fifteenth century, the underground chapel was enlarged with an above-ground apse and choir. Between 1905 and 1906, the church underwent restoration by architect Giuseppe Castellucci, returning the church to a style similar to its original one.


Facilities

The present complex consists in a church and convent.

Church

Exterior

The facade of the church is Gothic in style with a gabled roof. It is constructed of stone blocks and masonry. At the center is a doorway with a porch, the inside of which contains a portrait of St. Francis. Above the door is a rose window.

Interior

The interior of the church is in a simple Gothic style with a single nave covered by an arched barrel vault ceiling. The nave is divided into four bays. Among each the vaults are four side altars.

In the rear wall of the apse is a pipe organ built in 1938 by Mascioni. The organ has a fully electric drive. Its console has three keyboards with 61 notes each and a concave-radial pedalboard with 32 notes.

Convent

The convent is located to the right of the church. Its main entrance faces the square and consists of a frescoed arch. The convent building is surrounded by three cloisters. The largest cloister comprises a four-sided portico covered by a cross vault ceiling.
