Enamiĝo Reciprokataj (2019)

In February 2019, Anjou released her debut piano album _Enamiĝo Reciprokataj[1]_, on Origin Records, a phrase in the Esperanto language meaning "falling in love reciprocated" or "mutual breakdown".

The album draws influences from Ahmal Jamal, Bill Evans, Vince Guaraldi, Oscar Peterson and Nina Simone, and features Greg Chudzik, Nick Anderson, Ben Perowsky, and Ari Folman-Cohen. The album received positive reviews from Downbeat Magazine,[2] Amazon,[3] All About Jazz,[4] NYC Jazz Record,[5] and France Musique.[6] She has been called a "virtuosa" and "highly sophisticated".[7]
