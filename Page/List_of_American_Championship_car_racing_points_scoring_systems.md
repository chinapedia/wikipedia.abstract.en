This is a LIST OF POINTS SCORING SYSTEMS used to determine the outcome of the ACCR Championships since 1909. The Championships are awarded each year to the driver who accumulate the most championship points over the course of the Championship season.


AAA Championships 1909–1929

-   Between 1909 and 1929, the Championship points were awarded to the first ten drivers. There were only points for ranks in races, no bonus points. The points system was based on mileage factor. The winner received 2 points per mile. The points system from 1920 was retroactively applied to the past season from 1909–1919 with the exception of 1916.
-   Drivers had to be running at the finish to score points. Points scored by drivers sharing a ride were split according to percentage of race driven. Starters were not allowed to score points as relief drivers (except 1920), if a race starter finished the race in another car in a points-scoring position those points were not awarded.

AAA Championship 1916

CART Championships 1981 and 1982

-   For the seasons 1981 and 1982 CART continued to use the USAC points scoring system. But they divided the points by 10, so the winner received only 0.2 points per mile.
-   For the first time, there were bonus points. The driver with the fastest qualifying lap, usually on pole position, and the driver with the most laps led received additional to their rank points a bonus. Bonus points multiplied by mileage factor the same as race points.
-   In 1982, CART awarded 300 mile points also for 400- and 500-mile races and didn't use the 400- and 500-mile pattern.

CART Championships 1983–2003

-   Beginning with 1983, CART used their own scoring system. As previously, only the first twelve ranks got points. All races got the same number of points, based on the 100 mile points scheme from USAC divided by 10.

CCWS Championships 2004–2008

-   After the CART has been converted into the new Champ Car World Series, a new points system was also introduced. The first 20 ranks were given points. The points scoring system is similar to the original CART points scoring system.
-   In addition, bonus points were also introduced for the fastest lap as well as for the driver who improved the most places in the race. If several drivers had gained the same number of positions, the highest ranked driver got this bonus.

IRL Championships 1996–1997

-   Although the Indy Racing League commissioned the USAC to perform the races, the old USAC points system was not reused. Instead, the IRL used its own simple points scoring system for all races, regardless of their distance. The first 33 ranks in race got points, starting with 2 points for position 33. Between the winner and the second place was a 2-point gap, between all other ranks a 1-point gap.
-   In the 1996 season, there was a multiplier for awarding points in race two (Phoenix) and race three (Indianapolis). Drivers were credited with overall points multiplied by the number of races they had competed in. For example, Scott Sharp had scored a sum of 82 points in the first three race, so he got 246 championship points (82 multiplied with 3) at the end of season.
-   In the 1997 season, there wasn't a multiplier, but 2 additional bonus points were awarded to the pole setter, while 1 bonus point got the driver with the most laps led. They also extended the entry list for the 1997 Indy500 to 35 drivers, so they awarded additional 1 point for ranks 34 and 35.

IRL Championships 1998–2003

-   After taking over the driving operation from the USAC, the IRL also changed its points system. All participants of a race were eligle to get championship points, even non-starters received points starting in 1999. The points scoring system applies to all races, regardless of their length or importance.
-   Between 1998 and 2000, the first three drivers from qualifying got bonus points (3, 2, 1) and the driver with most laps led got 2 bonus points instead of 1. From 2001 to 2003 no bonus points for the qualifying were awarded.
