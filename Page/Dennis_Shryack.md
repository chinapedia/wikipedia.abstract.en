DENNIS SHRYACK (August 25, 1936 â€“ September 14, 2016) was an American screenwriter whose credits included _The Gauntlet_ in 1977, _Code of Silence_ (1985), starring Chuck Norris, and _Turner & Hooch_ (1989), which stars Tom Hanks and Beasley the Dog. Shryack also co-wrote the screenplay for _Pale Rider_ in 1985, directed by Clint Eastwood, which became the highest grossing Western film of the 1980s, taking in the $41 million (the equivalent of nearly $92 million in 2016).[1] Shryack often collaborated on screenplays with other writers, including penning seven films with Michael Butler, as well as partnerships with Michael Blodgett on _Turner & Hooch_ and _Run_ in 1991.[2]

Shryack, who was born and raised in Duluth, Minnesota, began his career as a singer in The Escorts quartet, which toured as an opening act for well-known artists such as Sammy Davis Jr. and Sophie Tucker.[3] Following his time with The Escorts, Shryack was hired as a mailroom worker at Universal Pictures.[4]

Shryack's first produced screenplay was for the 1969 Western comedy film, _The Good Guys and the Bad Guys_, which he co-wrote and co-produced with Ronald M. Cohen.[5] His second film, the 1977 thriller _The Car_, starred James Brolin and Kathleen Lloyd.[6]

Shryack co-wrote a series of films starring Chuck Norris, beginning with _Code of Silence_ in 1985. In addition to his work with Clint Eastwood on _The Gauntlet_, he also co-wrote 1986's _Pale Rider_, in which Eastwood both directed and starred in, which became the highest grossing Western film of the 1980s with total box office receipts of $41 million.[7]

Some of Shryack's other credits included _Flashpoint_ (1984), which starred Kris Kristofferson, Treat Williams and Rip Torn; 1987's _Rent-a-Cop_ with Michael Blodgett, starring Burt Reynolds and Liza Minnelli; and _Cadence_ (1990), which starred Charlie Sheen and was directed by Martin Sheen.[8]

Shryack successfully negotiated for $1 million for the script he co-wrote for _Turner & Hooch_ (1989), which was the highest price ever paid for a screenplay by Touchstone Pictures at the time.[9]

He later became a literary agent and returned to his hometown of Duluth.[10]

Dennis Shryack died from congestive heart failure in Duluth, Minnesota, on September 14, 2016, at the age of 80. He was survived by his wife, Kathy, and children, daughter, Jennifer, and son, Chris.[11]
