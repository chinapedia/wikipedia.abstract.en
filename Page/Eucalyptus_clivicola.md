Description

_Eucalyptus clivicola_ is a mallet that typically grows to a height of and rarely forms a lignotuber. It has smooth grey over yellowish bark with flakes of rough, greyish bark that has not been completely shed. Its adult leaves are linear to lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of between nine and thirteen on a peduncle long that widens near the end, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are top-shaped to elongated, long and wide with a conical to horn-shaped operculum up to three times as long as the floral cup. Flowering occurs from December to May and the flowers are pale yellow. The fruit is a woody, barrel-shaped, to conical or cylindrical capsule long and wide.[2][3][4]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus clivicola_ was first formally described in 1991 by Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper from a specimen on the Ravensthorpe - Hopetoun road and the description was publish in the journal _Nuytsia_.[5][6] The specific epithet (_clivicola_) is derived from the Latin word _clivus_ meaning "ascent", "elevation", "hill" or "sloping hillside"[7] with the suffix _-cola_ meaning "dweller",[8] referring to the usual habitat of this species.[9]

Conservation status

This eucalypt is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[12]
