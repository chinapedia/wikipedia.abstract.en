STORMFALL: AGE OF WAR is a social browser game created in 2012 by Plarium and then moved to Facebook in November.[1][2][3] This game franchise builds on the success of Plarium's earlier Facebook titles in the crowded web-based PvP strategy game market, though a pay-to-win aspect of the game raises concerns.[4] Plarium which has a global registered player base of 250 million players introduced Stormfall: Rise of Balur as the sequel to the hugely popular Stormfall: Age of War.[5]


Gameplay

Stormfall: Age of War challenges players to fortify an army and castle within the fictional Kingdom of Darkshine.[6]

Players are required to employ strategy skills to build castles, manage resources, and participate in player-versus-player warfare under the guidance of Lord Oberon, protector of Stormfall. The game has a top-down isometric camera angle and retro style 2D graphics. Players' military units can raid enemy bases, defend their own base, and be used to participate in group warfare in a league system.[7]


Reception

The game became one of the twenty fastest-growing games on Facebook globally, according to Julien Codorniou, Facebook's head of European platform partnerships in 2013.[8] Pete Davison of Adweek called Stormfall "a very solid addition to the growing lineup of mid-core strategy titles on the social network" (referring to Facebook), and wrote that it "features solid gameplay, reasonable (if slightly inconsistent) presentation and plenty of things to do."[9]
