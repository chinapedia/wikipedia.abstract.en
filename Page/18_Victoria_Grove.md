18 VICTORIA GROVE, also known as ALBERT LODGE, is a Grade II listed house in Victoria Grove, Kensington, London W8, built in the early 19th century.[1]

The land locally was bought by John Inderwick (1785â€“1867) in 1836, "variously described as optician or ivory turner, and latterly as an importer of meerschaum pipes and snuff boxes", who became a successful speculative developer, and the architect was probably Joel Bray.[2]

In 1838, the house was leased to George Hinton, who built the houses to the north in Canning Place.[3]
