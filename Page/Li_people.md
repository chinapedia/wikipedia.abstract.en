The LI, LIZU, or HLAI are a Kra–Dai speaking ethnic group, one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People's Republic of China. The vast majority live off the southern coast of China on Hainan Island,[1] where they are the largest minority ethnic group. Divided into the five branches of the Qi (Gei), Ha, Run (Zwn), Sai (Tai, Jiamao), and Meifu (Moifau),[2] the Li have their own distinctive culture and customs.


Names

Li is the Chinese transcription of their native name, which is "Hlai". They are sometimes also known as the "Sai" or "Say". During China's Sui Dynasty, they were known by the name LILIAO.


History

The Li are believed to be descendants of the Rau people, Kra-Dai speaking tribes of ancient China, who settled on the island thousands of years ago.[3] DNA analysis carried out amongst the modern Li population indicate a close relationship with populations in the southern Chinese province of Guangxi.[4]

During the Japanese occupation of Hainan (1939–1945), the Li suffered particularly heavily due to their communist resistance activities especially in the western Hainan. Li villages were frequently targeted for extermination and rape by Japanese soldiers. In four towns alone, the Japanese slaughtered more than 10,000 Li people.[5] Some minor atrocities include the 17 March 1939 one where Japanese entered ethnic Li Houshi village (后石村) in Sanya and raped and killed more than 80 Li people.[6] The Japanese also killed 2,180 Miao civilians in Baisha and Baoting counties.[7]

They are held in high esteem by the Beijing government because they fought on the side of the CPC against Chinese Nationalist rule during the Chinese Civil War. Hainan Li-Miao Autonomous Prefecture was created in 1952 (abolished in 1988).


Language

The Li speak the Hlai languages, a member of the Kra–Dai language family,[8] but most can understand or speak Hainanese and Standard Chinese. The language spoken natively by the Sai (also known as Tai or Jiamao) subgroup has been noted for its dissimilarity to the dialects or languages spoken by the other subgroups of the Li.


Culture

The Li play a traditional wind instrument called _kǒuxiāo_ (口箫),[9] and another called _lìlāluó_ (利拉罗).
