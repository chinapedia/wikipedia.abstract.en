The FIRST STATE BANK OF BAGGS, also known as the BANK CLUB, is a building in Baggs, Wyoming. Built in 1907-08 to house a bank, it is one of the relatively few original buildings left in Baggs. After the bank closed in 1924 the building became a doctor's office, and during Prohibition it housed a bootleg liquor business. After Prohibition was repealed it became Baggs Liquor. In 1946 it was renamed the Bank Club Bar.[1]

The one story log structure is covered by stamped sheet metal and features a Greek Revival pedimented front with Ionic columns _in antis_ between Doric pilastered walls.[2]

The First State Bank of Baggs was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 13, 1984.[3]
