The neighborhood was established in 1935 by an African American landowner, Ross Reid, it was one of the first exclusively African American neighborhoods in Charlotte. The City of Charlotte annexed Reid Park in 1959, and the number of homes and residents grew significantly thereafter. According to residents, in its first 40 years, the neighborhood had a high quality of life. Unfortunately, by the early 1980s, the neighborhood began to decline and crime rose.[2] It became the main attraction for Crack Cocaine dealers and gangs to set up shop, especially around the infamous Dalton village housing Projects. Several homes sustained major renovations in the mid 2000s and by 2013, majority of the homes that where once decaying where now gone or renovated.[3] [4] The revitalization project in Reid Park began after the demolition of Dalton Village in 1998.
