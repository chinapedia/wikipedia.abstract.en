The ALEXANDER D. MCDOUGALL HOUSE is a historic house in the Willamette Heights neighborhood of Northwest Portland, in Portland, Oregon.[1]

It was designed by architect Ellis Lawrence with elements of Tudor Revival architecture and Arts & Crafts architecture, and it was built in 1911 by local builders Franchell & Parlin.[2]

The house is significant as an "excellent intact example" of the early work of Lawrence. Its notable features include the views afforded from its siting; on the outside its landscaping, rock walls, decorative half-timbering, brickwork, and verandah; and on the inside its floor plan which provides "comfort and efficiency" despite the large size of the house, its oak paneling, niches, built-in benches, and art glass window.[3]
