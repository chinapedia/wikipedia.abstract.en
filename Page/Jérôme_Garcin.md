Controversy

The website suggested a conflict of interest between his profession of literary criticism, of animator producing the most prescriptive radio program in literary matter, and that of writer: the highly praising critics of Jérôme Garcin's works would not be alien to the dominant position he occupies in the French literary microcosm.[3][4]
