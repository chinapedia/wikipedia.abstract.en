Professional life

Following graduation Logi returned to Akureyri, where he worked as a landscape designer at H.J. teiknistofa 1992–94 and for the technical and zoning office at Akureyri municipality 1994–96, before switching back to the private sector where he worked for Form 1996-97, Úti og Inni 1997– 2003 and Arkitektúr.is 2003–04.

Political career

Logi unsuccessfully ran for parliament in the Northeast Constituency in the 2009 Althing election for the Social Democratic Alliance (SDA), but served as a substitute MP on five occasions during the 2009-2013 term.[5] He became a member of the City Council in Akureyri in 2010,[6] and was elected as deputy chairman of the SDA on their party conference in 2016. Logi contested the Northeast Constituency for his party in the 2016 Althing election and won the party's sole constituency seat. SDA suffered the worst defeat in the history of the party in the election, and as a consequence party chairman Oddný G.

Logi is married to the lawyer and flute player, Arnbjörg Sigurðardóttir. They have two children, Úlf and Hrefna.[8]
