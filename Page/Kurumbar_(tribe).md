KURUMBAS (or) KURUMBAR (Tamil : குரும்பர்)[1] are a designated Scheduled Tribe in the Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu.[2] The Kurumbar are one of the earliest known inhabitants of the Western Ghats, who are engaged in the collection and gathering of forest produce, mainly wild honey and wax. The members of this community are short, have black skin, and have protruding foreheads.[3]

Kurumbar believe in Hinduism and have a language, which is a mixture of all Dravidian languages. The main deity of the tribe is Lord Shiva under the name of Bhairava. They also worship animals, birds, trees, rock hillocks, and snakes, along with the other Hindu deities.

Kurumbar are one of the six ancient tribal groups in Tamil Nadu. They live very much in tune with Nature. Hunting and collecting forest produce are the two main means of living for the Kurumbar tribe. However, the restrictions to protect native forest and wildlife have forced them to find work outside the forests.
