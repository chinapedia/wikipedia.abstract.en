_EUCALYPTUS AEQUIOPERTA_, commonly known as the WELCOME HILL GUM,[1] is a mallee, sometimes a tree and is endemic to Western Australia. It has rough bark on the lower half of the trunk, lance-shaped leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and fifteen, white flowers and more or less cup-shaped fruit.Eucalyptus_aequioperta_buds.jpg


Description

_Eucalyptus aequioperta_ is a mallee or sometimes a tree growing to a height of or more, and forms a lignotuber. The bark is a dark grey colour, firm and flaky to fibrous over the lower half of the trunk and extending to large limbs. The bark becomes slightly tessellated on older trees and on higher branches is smooth, dull and pinkish grey to white. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, glossy and a similar green on both sides. The leaf blade is linear to narrow lance-shaped or curved, long and wide with a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of between seven and fifteen in leaf axils, the groups on a peduncle long, individual buds on a pedicel long. The buds are "egg-in-egg cup shaped" or spindle-shaped, long and wide. The operculum is long and equal in width or narrower than the floral cup. The stamens are white. Flowering has been observed in May and the fruit are cup-shaped to cone-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide.[2][3][4]


Taxonomy

_Eucalyptus aequioperta_ was first formally described by the botanists Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper in 1993 in the journal _Nuytsia_. The type specimen was collected by Brooker near Mount Walker, north of Hyden in 1985.[5][6] The specific epithet (_aequioperta_) is "from the Latin _aequi_ - equal and _opertus_ - cover, referring to the operculum shape, in relation to the hypanthium".[7] The proper classical Latin word for "equal" is however _aequus_.[8]

_Eucalyptus aequioperta_ is part of the subgenus _Symphyomyrtus_ section _Dumaria_ in a sub-group of nine closely related species called series _Ovulares_. The rough barked members of this series include _E. aequioperta_, _E. baudiniana_, _E. brachycorys_, _E. myriadena_ and _E. ovularis_ and the smooth barked members include _E. cyclostoma_, _E. cylindrocarpa_, _E. exigua_ and _E. oraria_.[9]


Distribution and habitat

The Welcome Hill gum grows in red sand on sandhills in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions of Western Australia. It is found in an area between Corrigin in the west, Southern Cross and Coolgardie in the east but its distribution is not well known and may extend even further east.[10][11]


Conservation status

This eucalypt is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[12]
