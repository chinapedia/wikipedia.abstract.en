CHASE FARRIS (born April 8, 1993) is an American football offensive guard who is a free agent. He played college football at Ohio State, and was signed by the Detroit Lions as an undrafted free agent in 2016.


College career

Farris attended Ohio State University and played for the Ohio State Buckeyes football program beginning in 2012. After redshirting the 2011 season as a true freshman, Farris made the transition from defensive line to offensive line and made seven total appearances on special teams for the 2012 Ohio State Buckeyes football team. As a sophomore in 2013, Farris battled current Detroit Lions tackle Taylor Decker for a spot at the right tackle position, before being moved back to the defensive line. In seven games that season, Farris played in seven games and totaled 120 plays on defense and special teams while collecting three tackles and 1.5 tackles-for-loss. Late in the season, Farris suffered a knee injury, and would have surgery before the 2014 Orange Bowl. In his junior year, Farris played in all 15 games, and totaled 169 offensive snaps, the most of any Ohio State non-starter during the regular season and College Football Playoff, which Ohio State would go on to win. Farris played a career-high 60 snaps on offense during a 66–0 win over Kent State that season. During his senior season, his fifth with the Buckeyes, Farris started at right tackle.

Farris graduated from Ohio State with a bachelor's degree in Consumer and Family Financial Services.
