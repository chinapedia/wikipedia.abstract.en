The THIRD GENERATION HONDA CR-V was launched for the 2007 model year. It went on sale in the US during late September 2006. Unlike preceding models it features a rear liftgate rather than a side-opening rear door and no longer has the spare tire mounted on the rear door. The new CR-V is lower, wider, and shorter than the previous models; the length decrease is attributed mostly to the fact that the spare wheel no longer adds length to the back of the vehicle. A lowering of the center of gravity is another benefit of the spare wheel being located underneath the rear cargo area. The center rear seat pass-through was also introduced as a new feature on the third generation.

The third generation CR-V is powered by the latest version of Honda's standard K-series 2.4 L inline-four engine, similar variants were also found in the Honda Accord and Honda Element. In North American markets, this engine's power is rated at at 5,800 rpm and at 4,200 rpm.[1] A 2.2 L i-CTDI diesel engine is offered in the European and Asian markets. The European market CR-V offers a new R20A 2.0 L petrol engine, based on the Honda R-series i-VTEC SOHC engine found in the Honda Civic, as opposed to the previous CR-V offering the K20A.

Honda offered an integrated Navigation option on the EX-L model. The navigation unit was made for Honda by Alpine and includes voice activated control, XM radio (in the US and Canada), and an in-dash CD player that can play MP3 and WMA media. The media offerings also included a six-disc CD changer in the center console and a PC Card (PCMCIA) slot in the Navigation unit for flash memory MP3 or WMA files. A second CD player is positioned behind the navigation screen, which plays MP3/WMA cds. A rear backup camera was also included.[2]

An iPod adapter was to be an available option on US models, but was only available as an add-on accessory. All CR-V models retained the auxiliary audio input jack, which is either on the head unit itself (LX), on the central tray (EX), or inside the center console (all versions of the EX-L, with or without navigation).


Sales and production

2007_Honda_CR-V_(RE_MY2007)_wagon_01.jpg For 2007, Honda CR-V became one of the ten best selling vehicles of the year.[3] It overtook Ford Explorer, which had held the title for fifteen years (1991–2006), to be the best selling SUV in the US.[4] In Canada, the CR-V was the second best selling SUV in 2007, behind the Ford Escape.[5]

To meet demand, Honda shifted some Civic production from East Liberty, Ohio to Alliston Plant #2, Ontario[6] (where some Pilot, Ridgeline, and Odyssey production was located until production was consolidated at Honda's Lincoln, Alabama facility) to free up space for additional CR-V production. Currently, the East Liberty plant is building 400 CR-V models a day for the Canadian and US markets. The U.S. market CR-V models are imported primarily from Sayama, Saitama, Japan and El Salto, Jalisco, Mexico in increasing numbers. In 2008, CR-V continued to be top ten bestseller and best selling SUV of the year in the U.S.[7] Since its introduction in 1997, there were more than 215,000 CR-V sold in Canada.[8]

Chassis code: RE1 (2WD), RE2 (4WD), RE3 (2WD), RE4 (4WD) RE5 (4WD), RE7 (4WD)


Safety

2008 NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION (NHTSA) CRASH TEST RATINGS[9]

Frontal Impact: 5_stars.svg

Side Impact: 5_stars.svg

Rollover: 4_stars.svg

All models came standard with Vehicle Stability Assist. The Honda CR-V was rated "good" in frontal[10] and side-impact[11] crash tests by the IIHS. However it was rated "marginal" in the roof strength test.[12] An analysis conducted by the IIHS and released in June 2011, found that the 2007-08 MY CR-V had the lowest fatality rate in its class and among the lowest fatality rates among all vehicles.[13]


EPA fuel economy ratings

Since the introduction of a newer, five-speed automatic transmission, which sports a higher MPG rating and smoother shifting, the manual transmission was dropped from the US market. Fuel economy ratings from the EPA are city, highway. _Consumer Reports_ rates fuel economy as city, highway.


2010 facelift

For the 2010 model year, the CR-V received style, powertrain, and equipment changes. The exterior changes included a redesigned front fascia with a new horizontal-slat chrome grille and honeycomb-designed lower front grille, new front bumper, and revised taillights. The rear bumper was redesigned, as well as new five split-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels for EX and EX-L models. The interior received minor changes, including seat fabrics, as well as wider driver and front-passenger armrests. The audio head unit controls were altered and the information display backlighting in the gauges was changed to blue, instead of the previous black. A USB audio input became standard in the EX-L trim while hands-free Bluetooth connectivity was exclusive to the EX-L trim equipped with navigation system. In 2011, a mid-level SE trim debuted with a 6-disc CD changer and 17-inch 7-spoke alloy wheels that came from the pre-facelift EX and EX-L trims.

Power was increased from for 2010 and mileage improved by 1 mpg for both front-wheel and all-wheel drive models. The EPA ratings were / city/highway and / city/highway respectively. Recommended oil weight changed from 5W-20 to 0W-20 from previous years with a change to the K24Z6 engine.

The 2010 model year update went on sale in the United States in September 2009.

Asia

In the Philippines the 2010 Honda CR-V is nearly the same as the US model, but is provided with side-mirror turning signals. It is available in 4x4 (2.4 L) and 4x2 (2.0 L), the former having a five-speed automatic gearbox as standard. The top of the range 2.4 L 4x4 comes with leather upholstery and HID headlamps. All models have rear parking sensors as standard, but no sunroof or GPS fourth generation.[14]

In Thailand, the Honda CR-V has 4 versions: 2.0S(2WD), 2.0E(4WD), 2.4EL(2WD), and 2.4EL(4WD). All versions come with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Navigator, DVD, and rear-view camera are standard equipment for 2.4EL(2WD) and 2.4EL(4WD) versions. The version with 2.0 engine has 150 Hps at 6200 rpms, while the version with 2.4 engine has 170 Hps at 5800 rpms.[15]

In Indonesia, there are 3 variants of Honda CR-V: 2.0L M/T, 2.0L A/T and 2.4L A/T. The 2.4L A/T comes standard with single electric driver seat, Dual Automatic climate control, five-spoke rims, different level of interior trims and touch-screen enabled stereo system. All versions use FWD configuration. In early 2010, the third-generation Honda CR-V is updated with new front grille and minor interior trims.


Europe

The CR-V facelift made available to European markets (as well as South Africa) features new added luxuries not previously seen before, and not available to Japanese, Asian, or American markets. Xenon (HID) headlights are available for the first time, as are 18-inch alloy wheels (19-inch optional), GPS/DVD navigation system, and a premium sound system with USB audio input. A panoramic glass moonroof is standard on upper spec models, and all models feature chrome exterior door handles. Externally, the vehicle also features complete body color-coding, on all lower body plastic cladding (models sold elsewhere in the world feature dark grey plastic lower cladding).

The 2.2 L i-CTDI N22A turbo diesel engine was discontinued and replaced by the 2.2 L i-DTEC N22B engine, increasing power output to 150ps, and meeting Euro5 emissions standards.


South America

In Brazil the CR-V third-generation was sold (imported from Mexico) with a 2.0-liter, i-VTEC engine instead of the 2.4 used in other countries. The reason is that in Brazil the tax is higher for engines above 2.0 liters. The Honda Accord sold in Brazil had the same 2.0-liter engine.

In Peru the CR-V has different trim levels. The two most equipped ones are the Deluxe and the Platinum. These two, in contrast with the models sold in the US feature chrome door handles, and HID headlamps. The Platinum version also comes with rear parking sensors, and 18-inch alloy wheels. It does not feature heated front seats because it is considered unnecessary due to the type of climate in Peru. There is no trim level featuring GPS. Trim levels: 4x2-L, LX 4x4, EX 4x4, Deluxe, 4x4, Top, and Platinum.
