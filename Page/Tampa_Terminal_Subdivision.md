Ybor_City_Train_2012.jpg The TAMPA TERMINAL SUBDIVISION is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in Florida. The Tampa Terminal Subdivision covers track around Yeoman and Uceta Yards and is located at the end of two of CSX's main lines to Jacksonville and points north, the A Line and the S Line. The S Line is CSX's main freight route through Peninsular Florida. Some freight operates on the A Line and all Amtrak passenger service operates on the A Line.

The Tampa Terminal Subdivsion has three distinct sections. The first section includes a segment of the S Line (former Seaboard Air Line Railroad mainline) running from control point YN to Gary and is in length. At its north end it continues south from the Yeoman Subdivision and at its south end the west main leads to the Clearwater Subdivision while the east main leads to the HOOKER'S POINT LEAD.

The second section includes a segment of the A Line (former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad mainline) running from Mango to Tampa Union Station and is 8.1 miles in length. At its north end it continues south from the Lakeland Subdivision and at its south end it continues south as the PORT TAMPA SPUR.

The third section runs on the AZA Line from Yeoman Yard south to East Tampa and is 7.3 miles in length. At its south end it continues south as the Palmetto Subdivision.[1][2]


Yards

Yeoman & Uceta Yards

The Tampa Terminal Subdivision is centered around YEOMAN YARD, CSX's primary classification yard for the Tampa area. Yeoman Yard was built by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad and is located along the S Line. A track on the south side of Yeoman Yard connects the S Line with the AZA line and allows trains to bypass the yard without entering yard limits.[3]

Uceta Yard, located just north of Yeoman Yard on the A Line, was once the main classification yard for the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. Though after the Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line Railroads merged, Yeoman Yard was retained as the main classification yard. Uceta Yard now operates as an intermodal terminal and car storage facility.[4]

Rockport Yard

Another notable yard is ROCKPORT YARD, located south of Yeoman Yard on a wye off the AZA Line. Rockport Yard serves CSX's Rockport Terminal, a deep-water port used for exporting phosphate.[5] Trains bring phosphate for export mined from the Bone Valley in Central Florida. Rockport became the primary phosphate export facility for the railroad after the closure of Port Boca Grande in 1979.[6]


History

Tampa,Florida,USA._-_panoramio_(31).jpg The A Line was previously the main line of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad with Uceta Yard being their main Tampa yard. The Atlantic Coast Line main line was originally built by the South Florida Railroad, which was part of Henry B. Plant's system of railroads. The line began service in 1884, and was taken over by the Atlantic Coast Line in 1902 after they bought the Plant System.

The S Line was previously the main line of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad with Yeoman Yard being their main Tampa yard. The Seaboard Air Line main line was originally part of the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad and began service in 1890. The Seaboard Air Line acquired the line in 1903. Seaboard built Yeoman Yard in the 1950s to mostly replace what is now known as Old Tampa Yard downtown.[7]

The AZA line south to East Tampa was built later in 1924 by the Tampa Southern Railroad a subsidiary of the Atlantic Coast Line.[8] The control point "TS" at the north end of the line is a reference to the Tampa Southern.

The Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line merged in 1967 becoming the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. This brought all tracks in Tampa under a single owner. In 1980, the Seaboard Coast Line's parent company merged with the Chessie System, creating the CSX Corporation. The CSX Corporation initially operated the Chessie and Seaboard Systems separately until 1986, when they were merged into CSX Transportation. Prior to the merger, the Seaboard main line (S Line) continued west from Gary giving the Seaboard its own access to Tampa Union Station. The S Line route into Tampa Union Station, which ran beside Adamo Drive, was removed in the 1990s, after Amtrak discontinued service to St. Petersburg in 1984.[9]
