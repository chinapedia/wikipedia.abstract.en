_ZORA SPINIMANA_ is a prowling spider of the family Miturgidae with a Palearctic distribution. It is the type species of the genus _Zora_.[1]


Description

The females are 5-7.7 mm in length, the males 4.5–5 mm. The epigyne has a small groove and a larger spermatheca.[2] The species is very similar to _Zora silvestris_ but the brown lateral bands on the carapace are narrower than the yellow bands, whereas in _Z. silvestris_ the brown lateral bands are wider than the yellowish bands. _Z. spinimana_ is slightly larger than _Z. silvestris_ and the overall yellow colour of _Z. spinimana_ has a warmer hue. _Z. spinimana_ has three pairs of ventral spines on metatarsus I and II, but _Z. silvestris_ has only two.[3]


Biology

The female is often found sitting on a white sheet of silk which she spins to protect her egg sac. Adults, of both sexes, may be recorded throughout the year, but mostly from late spring into the autumn, with two apparent peaks in early to mid-summer and the autumn.[4]


Habitat

The species is often found in grassland, normally near the ground in grass roots and leaf litter but also under stones or other objects. It can also be found in other habitats such as heathland, open woodland and raised bogs.[5]


Distribution

_Zora spinimana_ has a Palearctic distribution.[6] In Europe this is a common species in western and central Europe but in Great Britain it is commoner in the south and in eastern Scotland but it becomes more localised in northern England and western Scotland.[7]
