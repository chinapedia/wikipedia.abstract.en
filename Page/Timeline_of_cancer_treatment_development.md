This is a historical timeline of the development and progress of cancer treatments, which includes time of discovery, progress, and approval of the treatments.


Ancient Era

Cancer was traditionally treated with surgery, heat, or herbal (chemical) therapies.

-   2600 BC Egyptian physician Imhotep recommended producing a localised infection to promote regression of tumours. According to the Ebers medical papyrus, this was done by placing a poultice near the tumour, followed by local incision.[1]
-   BC Ancient Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians used heat to treat masses. Healers in ancient India used regional and whole-body hyperthermia as treatments.[2]
-   2 AD Ancient Greeks describe surgical treatment of cancer.[3][4]

[47] Tamoxifen was born into a world of indifference in the '60s, when the focus of the research was on contraception. It grew up in the 70s, in a world where chemotherapy was king and hormonal therapies were perceived as non-starters in the quest to cure cancer.

[56] In 1997, a patient with osteosarcoma was first successfully treated with ultrasound imaging-guided HIFU in Chongqing, China. Over the last decade, thousands of patients with uterine fibroids, liver cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, bone tumors, and renal cancer have been treated with ultrasound imaging-guided HIFU. Based on several research groups’ reports, as well as our ten-year clinical experience, we conclude that this technique is safe and effective in treating human solid tumors.

[71] According to Littrup et al., who performed cryoablation of breast tumors in clinical stages I-IV with a multi-probe freeze approach, isotherms within cryozones can be accurately controlled and such cryoablation enables the destruction of much bigger lesions, up to 7 cm in diameter (15)
