The 2016 CANADIAN SOCCER LEAGUE SEASON (known as the GIVOVA CANADIAN SOCCER LEAGUE for sponsorship reasons) was the 19th season of the Canadian Soccer League. The first match of the season was played on May 21, 2016, and ended on October 30, 2016.[1] The season concluded with Serbian White Eagles claiming their second CSL Championship by defeating expansion franchise Hamilton City SC by a score of 2-1.[2] In the Second Division the York Region Shooters B defeated Toronto Atomic FC B 2-1.[3] During the regular season York Region claimed their fifth regular season title and achieved a team milestone by recording their best defensive record allowing only 10 goals a record not matched since the Ottawa Wizards in the 2003 CPSL season.[4] Meanwhile SC Waterloo acquired their third Second Division regular season title.[5]

The 2016 season featured 14 teams in the two divisions with 8 in the First Division and 6 in the Second Division the lowest amount since the league's inaugural year.[6] The CSL revived their sponsorship agreement with Givova which granted the company the naming rights to the league, and to the CSL Championship.[7] The league re-launched their television program the Givova CSL Primetime hosted by Alex Bastyovanszky with Jason De Thomasis providing game analysis while receiving broadcasting from Ethnic Channels Group, and BeIN Sports.[8][9] The CSL formed a partnership with the Ontario Youth Soccer Association in order to establish a YSA Division to house the CSL Academy teams.[10] The league also finalized an agreement with the Canadian Corporate Soccer League a Montreal based league which provides competition for the city's corporate clubs. In order to assist in developing a similar structure in Toronto.


First Division

Changes from 2015

The 2016 season saw the First Division reduced to 8 teams with Brampton United, Burlington SC, Niagara United, and Toronto Croatia departing from the league. While Brampton, Burlington, Toronto, along with Atomic Selects FC became founding members in the LIKA SUPERGROUP Open Division in the Canadian Academy of Futbol (CAF) an academy player developmental league associated with the CSL.[11] New entries included the arrival of FC Ukraine United from the Ontario Soccer League, and the transfer of London City's franchise rights to Hamilton in order to become Hamilton City SC.[12][13][14] The territorial rights to London City were kept by Milton owner Jasmin Halkic, and decided to relegate the club to the Second Division with SC Waterloo Region joining them.
