MARCOS NOGUEIRA EBERLIN (born 4 March 1959[1]) is a Brazilian chemist and professor at the Institute of Chemistry of the University of Campinas. He is a member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences and received the Brazilian National Order of Scientific Merit in 2005 and the Thomson Medal in 2016.[2]

Eberlin discovered the Eberlin Reaction during his work on gas phase ion chemistry, and he and his research group introduced EASI[3] (Easy Ambient Sonic-spray Ionization), an ionization technique used in mass spectrometry.

Eberlin is an advocate of intelligent design in Brazil, he also lectures and he has signed the Dissent From Darwinism statement.[4][5] He is a creationist also, and has said that evolution theory is a fallacy.[6]

His daughter, Livia S. Eberlin,[7] is also a chemist who won the MacArthur "Genius" Fellowship in 2018 for her research on the use of mass spectrometry to diagnose cancer.[8] Eberlin and his daughter have worked together on a different project, using mass spectrometry to detect counterfeit money.[9]
