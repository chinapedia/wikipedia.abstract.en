PRISM VIDEO CONVERTER SOFTWARE (trademarked) is a video conversion software published by NCH Software available[1] for Windows and Macintosh Operating Systems. It offers users the ability to convert AVI, ASF, DVD, FLV, QuickTime, MP4, MPEG-PS and any other video formats[2] using Microsoft DirectShow to another video format. It allows users to set the compression/encoder rates, resolution and frame rates of output files. "Supports all of the popular multimedia devices including PSP, iPod, MP4 players and mobile phones",[3] and has been referenced by _The New York Times_ as a “commercial software with faster conversion speeds and more features” when used to convert video files.[4]


Features

Prism supports HD and high compression for smaller files. Users can configure encoder options to customize their video output, and color can be optimized by applying a filter. Prism can convert individual files or multiple files at once using batch mode, and can convert from any non-copyrighted DVD disc to any of the supported video formats. Prism supports a command line mode[5] for automated file conversions.


Users

Many educational institutions and government offices offer Prism for download to their students[6] or staff,[7] and many also provide instructions on how to use Prism for students/staff,[8] or how-to sites for general knowledge.[9]

Controversy

Previously, Prism and other NCH products came bundled with optional browser plugins like the Conduit[10] and Chrome toolbars, which sparked complaints from users and triggered malware warnings from AV software companies like Norton and McAffee. NCH has since removed all toolbars, browsers, and 3rd party app offerings in all program versions released after July 2015.[11]
