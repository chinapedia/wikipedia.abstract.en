The LINE 4 or Noapara - Barasat Line of the Kolkata Metro is an 16.876 km[1] long metro route from Noapara to Barasat in North 24 Parganas, which is under construction. It is being built by RVNL. It is a fully elevated corridor. It will have an interchange station at the Dum Dum Airport with line 6 of the Kolkata metro. The future of the project beyond Airport is still in darkness due to land problem. After Dum Dum Airport, the metro route will pass through a land owned by a private company. When the project was sanctioned, then railway minister Mamata Banerjee vested this land for metro project but the company moved to High court against it making the future of the project beyond airport in darkness. Till now no solution came. The construction company L&T was given the tender for construction but due to no hope of getting rid of land problem beyond airport, they walked out from the construction. In Barasat, heavy traffic jam is a burning problem for the citizens. Metro project would have given them a breath. But still now no hope arose to the citizens. However, the future of the alignment beyond Dum Dum Airport is still uncertain.

Construction of terminal for Line 6 has begun at Dum Dum Airport and is expected to be completed by the end of 2019.

As per latest news dated 28/03/17, construction work has started between Noapara - Jessore road. Rehabilitation of all families living on railway land, demolition and removing of debris has been completed on 26/03/17. The construction authority is hopeful to construct 37 pillars on this land within nine months. On October 2017, the Airport Authority of India (AAI) will hand over land to the construction authority for construction of an underground station. Further new complications arise at Digla Mouza, 3 buildings to be demolished and 750 Sq Meter land to be acquired for progress of the project. Currently all up to state government, how fast the problems will get resolved & work go on full throttle. The metro railway is expected to open the Noapara - Dum Dum Airport section by June 2021.

After commissioning the metro line up to Dum Dum Airport, the construction work will start towards Barasat. According to metro railway, there is no encroachment till New Barrackpore. But there are encroachments after New Barrackpore to Barasat. They are hopeful to carry out the construction work till New Barrackpore.[2]

Progress of Dum Dum Cantonment metro station

Dum_Dum_Cantonment_metro_station.png An amount of Rs 127 crore contract to build this station along with a mostly at-grade 2.16 km section from the Bagjola Canal to the existing ramp of the Airport Circular Railway track was awarded to Senbo Engineering all the way back in June 2011. Since then, the station’s civil structure has been built, but work for the at-grade track section could not be started due to land acquisition issues along the line’s proposed alignment. But recently the rehabilitation work has started and as per news, the work will begin shortly.
