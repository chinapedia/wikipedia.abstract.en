MULTIBEAM is an American corporation that engages in the design of semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. Based in Santa Clara, in the Silicon Valley, Multibeam is led by Dr. David K. Lam, the founder and first CEO of Lam Research.


Technology

Multibeam developed miniature, all-electrostatic columns for e-beam lithography. Arrays of e-beam columns operate simultaneously and in parallel to increase wafer processing speed. With 36 patents filed,[1] Multibeam develops multicolumn e-beam systems and platforms for four major applications: Complementary E-Beam Lithography (CEBL), Direct Electron Writing (DEW), Direct Deposition/Etch (DDE), and E-Beam Inspection (EBI)[2]


Applications

-   Direct Electron Writing (DEW) embeds security information in each IC including chip ID, IP or MAC address, and chip-specific information such as keys used in encryption. Chip ID is used for supply chain traceability and to detect counterfeits. Hardware-embedded encryption keys are used to authenticate software. Chip-specific information written into DEW-bit registers is non-volatile.[3][4]
-   Complementary Electron Beam Lithography (CEBL) works with optical lithography to pattern cuts (of lines in "lines-and-cuts" layout)[5] and holes (i.e., contacts and vias) with no masks.[6][7][8][9]
-   Direct Deposition/Etch (DDE) can be used in chip fabrication or wafer defect repair. Precursors or reactants are introduced through gas injectors. Activation electrons are directed in accordance with the design layout database to deposit or remove material at precise locations on the substrate.[10][11][12]
-   Multi-column Electron Beam Inspection (EBI) for wafer defect detection and metrology.[13][14][15]
