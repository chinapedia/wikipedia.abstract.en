ALFRED INSELBERG is an American-Israeli mathematician and computer scientist based at Tel Aviv University.

Inselberg started his career at the Biological Computer Laboratory based at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[1] There he was part of a cybernetics group working on biomathematics developing mathematical models of the ear, neural networks, and computer models for Vision and Non-linear Analysis, gaining a PhD [2] in Mathematics and Physics. During this period he participated in the Symposium on Principles of Self-Organization.[3] He is particularly noted for his work on parallel coordinates[4][5] [6] (||-coords), which he proposed in 1959, for the visualization of multidimensional geometries (as in Linear Algebra) and multivariate problems.

Alfred was born in 1936 in Athens, Greece. Later he attended a great school, ''' Whittingehame College ''' in Brighton England, where he fell in love with _Geometry_ and especially the ability to gain insight about geometrical problems by visually interacting with drawings depicting them. He attended the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana (UICU) receiving a B.Sc. in Aeronautical Engineering. Together with Gary van Sant, and two other students under the guidance of Professor Paul Torda, they founded the University of Illinois Rocket Society in 1953; four years prior to Sputnik. Continuing his studies at UICU he obtained in 1965 a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and Physics under the joint guidance of Professors Ray Langebartel and Heinz von Foerster.

He then held senior research positions at IBM where he developed a Mathematical Model of the Ear(Cochlea) (TIME Nov. 74) and later Collision-Avoidance Algorithms for Air Traffic Control (3 USA patents). Concurrently he had joint appointments at UCLA, USC, Technion and Ben Gurion University. Since 1995 he is Professor at the School of Mathematical Sciences of Tel Aviv University. He was elected Senior Fellow at the San Diego Supercomputing Center in 1996. He is a sought after speaker presenting keynotes at major conferences and events. His textbook on "Parallel Coordinates: VISUAL Multidimensional Geometry", was published by Springer and was praised by Stephen Hawking among many others.
