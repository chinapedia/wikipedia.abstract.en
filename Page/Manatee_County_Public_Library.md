History

In 1898, Julia Fuller carried book rentals in her store, which later moved to American Sudbury's store. A library committee was formed in 1904 by the Village Improvement Association. Dr. J.C. Pelot donated a lot at 12th St. West and Avenue West for the library to be built on. In 1904, T. J. Bachman loaned $500 to aid in the construction of a small library.[1]

In 1914, $10,000 was given by the Carnegie Foundation to establish the first library in the area, Palmetto Carnegie Library.

In 1918 the County Library System was established with the opening of the Bradenton Carnegie Library, where the first bookmobile was started in 1956. That same year, some additions were added to the Bradenton Carnegie Library, increasing the overall square footage by one third.[2]

In 1963, a plan was approved for a countywide system which allowed the cities of Bradenton and Palmetto to join together with Manatee County. From 1966 to 1969, the South Manatee Branch Library and the Island Branch Library were built. In the early 1970s, the idea of a large central library was proposed by the county. On April 24, 1978 the Central Library was opened to county citizens.

In 1990, the library system decided to use the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) to catalog books and other items. OCLC has become a vital part of the information infrastructure that supports research, scholarship, and learning around the world.[3]

In 1992, a text-only computer was added to the libraries that was connected to the _Bradenton Herald_ newspaper and had access to the index software. Two years later, one public computer was added for the use of word processing and educational software. In 1996, the first online catalog computers were added for the staff, which replaced the old large wooden card catalogs. Soon after, a few were added for patrons to use. In 2000, the Central Library gained twelve Windows-based PCs in the second-floor computer lab, thanks to a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2001, bookmobiles were updated, but their services ended in 2010. Throughout the 2010s, other technology was brought to the library, such as iPads, PCs, laptops, e-readers, and Wifi systems to enhance patrons' experience.


Elizabeth Eaton Florida History Reading Room

Elizabeth M. Eaton was a local philanthropist of Manatee County who created a trust provision in her will for the Manatee County Library System. The room is located at the Downtown Central Library. It contains a special collection of Manatee County's historical materials which came from local library collections and from the Manatee Historical Society. The materials include yearbooks, telephone books, directories, oral interviews, and archival negatives. The yearbooks are from local private and high schools dating back to 1916, and the telephone directories date back to 1897. The federal census for Florida starting in 1830 is on microfilm. There are also microfilm copies of local Manatee County newspapers, weekly and daily, as well as older magazines. Patrons can access historical maps and aerial photos of different time periods of the county.


Genealogy collection

The Manatee County Public Library has a genealogy collection for patrons to use to learn about their family history. Most materials are for in-house use only, but some may be checked out. The collection focuses on areas east of the Mississippi River and the colonial states. Patrons can search through census indexes, as well as marriage, birth, death, and other vital records. The library system provides manuals to inform patrons on how to search through the vast amounts of records. Other materials show how to identify name changes, nation migration trails, genealogical periodicals, military rosters, and church records. Patrons also have access to foreign ancestry materials to show immigration and passenger lists, guides to research foreign countries, and migration and settlements in the United States. Online genealogy resources are available, such as Heritage Quest Online and America's Genealogy Bank.
