HEZÂRFEN AHMED ÇELEBI was a legendary Ottoman aviator of Constantinople (present day Istanbul), reported in the writings of traveler Evliya Çelebi to have achieved sustained unpowered flight.


Alleged flight

The 17th century writings of Evliyâ Çelebi relate this story of Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi, circa 1630–1632:

The title _"Hezârfen"_, given by Evliyâ Çelebi to Ahmet Çelebi, is from Persian هزار _hezār_ + فنّ _fann_ meaning "having a thousand technics" (polymath).


Single report

In 1648, John Wilkins cites Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, the Austrian ambassador to Constantinople in 1554–1562, as recording that "a Turk in Constantinople" attempted to fly.[1] However, if accurate, this citation refers to an event nearly a century prior to the exploits reported by Evliyâ Çelebi.

Evliyâ Çelebi's account of the exploits of Hezârfen Ahmet Çelebi is only three sentences long (of a ten volume work), but the story has great currency in Turkey. Other than Evliyâ Çelebi's report, there are no other contemporary references to the event.

-   The Galata Tower sits above sea level[2], the peak of its conical dome above ground level[3] and above sea level.
-   Doğancılar square is about above sea level.
-   The elevation change between the tower (takeoff) and the square (landing) is .
-   The distance between the tower and the town square is approximately .[4]
-   Glide ratio required is 44:1. A modern hang glider has a glide ratio of 15:1 on average.


Modern era

-   One of three airports in Istanbul is named the "Hezarfen Airfield".
-   A mosque next to the Istanbul Atatürk Airport bears the appellation "Hezarfen Ahmet Çelebi".
-   A 1996 feature-length film, "Istanbul Beneath My Wings" (_İstanbul Kanatlarımın Altında_) concerns the lives of Hezârfen Ahmet Çelebi, his brother and rocket aviator Lagari Hasan Çelebi, and Ottoman society in the early 17th century, as witnessed and narrated by Evliyâ Çelebi.
