GLENHOLME NATURE RESERVE is a privately managed area of grassland, scarp and swamp forest in Kloof, outside of Durban, South Africa.[1] A small stream in the reserve leads to a waterfall and gorge which forms one of the headwaters of the Umbilo River.[2]

The reserve is managed by WESSA and the Kloof and Highway SPCA. The Glenholme Nature Reserve is accessible via a one-hour-long trail to the neighbouring Clive Cheesman Nature Reserve.[3]
