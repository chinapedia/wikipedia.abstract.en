_DUETS VANCOUVER 1989_ is a live album by American saxophonist and composer Anthony Braxton with pianist Marilyn Crispell recorded at the Vancouver Jazz Festival in 1989 and released on the Music & Arts label.[1][2]


Reception

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow stated "The music is a mixture of composition and improvisation (it is often difficult to know which is which). Although it will not win any new converts who are put off by the complexity of Braxton's music, repeated listenings to these dynamic performances will result in listeners gain in better understanding and appreciating these masterful musicians".[3]
