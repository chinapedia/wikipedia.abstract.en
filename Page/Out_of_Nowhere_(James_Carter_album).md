_OUT OF NOWHERE_ is a live album by saxophonist James Carter's Organ Trio with guests James Blood Ulmer and Hamiet Bluiett recorded at the Blue Note Jazz Club, and released on the Half Note Records label in 2005.[1]


Reception

The _Allmusic_ review by Al Campbell says, " Like its predecessor, _Live at Baker's Keyboard Lounge_, _Out of Nowhere_ provides an admirable cornucopia of modern jazz from Carter and friends".[2] In _JazzTimes_ David R. Adler called the album "another spirited live session".[3] On _All About Jazz_ John Kelman noted, "This recording's sense of adventure and avoidance of the expected makes for an entertaining and eye-opening experience. For those who wonder where Carter's been, the answer is right here. And for those who don't know him—or his illustrious associates—this is as painless an entry into their audacious world as you're apt to find".[4] Critic Robert Christgau rated the album an "A-", saying, "the organ-trio format so derided in jazzbo land suits his vulgar gusto perfectly--it's made for showoffs and delights in the impolite sounds he can extract from any number of saxophones at will".[5]
