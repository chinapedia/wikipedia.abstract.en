The CORFE RIVER is one of the four main rivers flowing into Poole Harbour in the county of Dorset, England. It is just under 9 kilometres long.[1]


Name

The Saxon name for Corfe River was the _Wichen_; this survives in the names of Wytch Farm, Upper Wych Channel, Wytch Heath and Wytch, or Wych, Lake. Wichen may have derived from _wics_ which meant "dairy farm", an indication that the area may not always have been heathland.[2]


Course

Bridge_over_the_Corfe_river_-_geograph.org.uk_-_268765.jpg The Corfe River rises near North Egliston about west of the hamlet of Steeple, between the Purbeck Hills and the coastal ridge. The river initially flows eastwards towards Corfe Castle. Just before reaching the village it swings north-northeast through the gap in the Purbecks between West Hill and East Hill and continues across Wytch Heath before emptying into Wych (or Wytch) Lake on the southern side of Poole Harbour.[3][4]


Water quality

In 2013 the Corfe River's water body quality was graded overall "poor" by the Environment Agency.[5]
