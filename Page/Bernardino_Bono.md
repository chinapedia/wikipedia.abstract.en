BERNARDINO BONO or BONI (died 1774) was an Italian painter of the late-Baroque period, active in Northern Italy.


Biography

He was born in Brescia and putatively a scholar of the Bolognese Giacomo Antonio Boni. It is unclear if they were relatives.[1] He is documented to have painted sacred subjects, including altarpieces and frescoes in the churches of Santi Pietro e Paolo, Pregasso di Marone; the parish church of Cailina; and the Chiesa della Carit√†, Brescia (1729-1748).[2]
