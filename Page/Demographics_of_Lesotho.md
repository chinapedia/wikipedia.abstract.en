Ethnic groups and languages

Due to Lesotho's long history as a unified nation, that continued even through British colonial rule, the ethnic makeup of the country is very homogenous. Lesotho's ethno-linguistic structure consists almost entirely of the Basotho (singular _Mosotho_), a Bantu-speaking people: an estimate of 99.7 percent of the people identify as Basotho.[13] The Kwena (Bakoena) are the largest subgroup of the Sotho; other Basotho subgroups include the Natal (North) Nguni, Batloung (the Tlou), Baphuthi (the Phuti), Bafokeng, Bataung (the Tau), Bats'oeneng (the tso'ene) and the Cape (South) Nguni (Thembu). Other ethnic groups include Europeans, numbering in the thousands, and several hundred Asians.[14]

Sesotho (Southern Sotho) and English languages are both official.[15] Afrikaans, Zulu, Xhosa and French are also spoken.


Religion

The population of Lesotho is estimated to be around 90 percent Christian.[16] Roman Catholics, the largest religious group, make up around 45 percent of the population.[17] Evangelicals comprise 26 percent of the population, and Anglican and other Christian groups an additional 19 percent.[18] Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Baha'i, and members of traditional indigenous religions comprise the remaining 10 percent of the population.[19]


Education and literacy

According to recent estimates, 85 percent of the population 15 and over was literate. Among women the literacy rate was around 95 percent, and among men around 75 percent.[20] As such, Lesotho boasts one of the higher literacy rates in Africa. Although education is not compulsory, the Government of Lesotho is incrementally implementing a programme for free primary education. It was expected that the program would be fully in place by 2006. The National University of Lesotho located in Roma and the Limkokwing University of Creative Technology located in the heart of Maseru, Moshoeshoe 2 are the only universities in the country.[21] In addition, the country has almost 20 other public and 15 private institutes giving tertiary education.[22]
