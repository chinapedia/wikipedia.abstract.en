XEOK-AM/XHOK-FM is a radio station on 900 AM and 90.9 FM in Monterrey, Nuevo León. It is owned by Grupo ACIR.


History

XEOK-AM received its concession on June 19, 1948. It broadcast initially on 950 kHz (soon moving to 920) and was owned by Carlos Roa Montes de Oca, who also built a studio-transmitter link for XEOK in the FM band in the late 1950s. XEOK was sold to Radiodifusión Regiomontana, S.A. in 1963, which boosted its power to 1 kW by the 1980s. In the 1990s, XEOK moved from 920 to 900 kHz which allowed a further power increase to 10,000 watts. ACIR concessionaires have owned XEOK since 2000.

For most of the late 2000s and 2010s, XEOK was a news/talk outlet known as "La OK". With ACIR only owning one station in Monterrey, XEOK was selected for second-wave AM-FM migration and signed on XHOK-FM 90.9 in May 2018. In June, the station took on the Radio Disney format, much like its Guadalajara sister station, XHEMIA-FM.
