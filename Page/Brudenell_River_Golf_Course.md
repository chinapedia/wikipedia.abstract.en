The course is an eighteen-hole course built by the provincial government of Prince Edward Island was originally opened in 1969.[1] The course gets its name from the Brudenell River, which is part of The Three Rivers, as several of the courses holes lie along the river. The Brudenell River Golf Course shares the practice grounds and clubhouse with its sister course Dundarave Golf Course.


History

The Brudenell River golf course started out as a nine-hole course at the location of the current course. In the late 60s, a member of the Legislative Assembly, Lorne Bonnell, in conjunction with a group of the course's regulars, built the current course. The provincial government expanded the course to 18 holes with the intent of drawing tourism to the Eastern region of Prince Edward Island.[2] The full 18-hole golf course officially opened in 1969.[3]

In 2007, the provincial government began looking to sell the Brudenell River Golf course, along with the other three courses it owns. The reasoning behind the decision was the large expenditure of taxpayer money on course maintenance; losses from the four courses totaled $858,900 in the 2014-2015 golf season.[4] Tourism Minister Robert Henderson was quoted as saying, "Obviously, when you're on the floor of the estimates [committee] â€¦ and you're saying you invested in this stuff, sometimes comments get made that maybe that would have been better spent on an X-ray machine or books,"[5] in relation to the government's decision to sell the courses. As of the 2015 golf season, no sale had been completed and the course is still maintained by the provincial government.[6]
