The POOLPARTY SEMANTIC SUITE is a technology platform provided by the Semantic Web Company. The EU-based company belongs to the early pioneers of the Semantic Web movement (Reference). The software supports enterprises in knowledge management, data analytics and content organisation. The product uses standards-based technologies as defined by W3C, which prevents vendor lock-in (Reference). Reference customers are among others Boehringer Ingelheim,[1] Credit Suisse,[2] European Commission,[3] REEEP,[4] Wolters Kluwer[5] and the World Bank Group.[6]


History

The PoolParty Semantic Suite is commercialising Semantic Web technologies. In 2009, the first release of the PoolParty Semantic Software entered the market. Since then, the product has evolved from a taxonomy management tool to a feature-rich semantic software platform that enables companies to deploy enterprise knowledge graphs to integrate structured and unstructured data. The product is developing fast due to a strong R&D focus and is integral part of multiple EU research projects of the Horizon 2020 initiative ( Reference, Reference).


Product

The PoolParty Semantic Suite is a modular and flexible software package. It differentiates nine modules, which can be individually combined depending on the business challenge:

-   Taxonomy & Thesaurus Management
-   Text Mining & Entity Extraction
-   Ontology Management
-   Concept Tagging
-   Data Integration
-   Linked Data Management
-   Semantic Search
-   Recommender System
-   Analytics & Visualization

Content assets get semantically enriched and are put into context by being matched against a knowledge graph. This is the foundation for semantic applications as search or linked data portals.


Technologies

PoolParty Semantic Suite is deploying Semantic Web technologies as promoted by W3C. The backbone of the information architecture is built by applying SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System), ontologies and Linked Data principles. Any data processed within PoolParty is transformed into RDF graphs and can be queried with SPARQL.

An essential advantage of this approach is that taxonomy projects developed in PoolParty can be linked with data from virtually any repository. Companies benefit from an automatic entity linking between resources from the graph-based semantic layer and knowledge assets from data repositories like document management systems.

Critics argue that the technology hasn't yet become mainstream as it is relative complex. As the demand and requirements for smarter enterprise applications are undamped, the Semantic Web technology stack becomes continuously more attractive to developers.
