SETTLEFORLOVE (SETTLE FOR LOVE sometimes abbreviated as SFL[1]) is a free online dating, friendship, and social networking app / website. Members must upload both Good and Bad pictures of themselves, as well as list their positive and not so positive traits.[2] These unique requirements encourage members to be honest from the start of the dating process.


History

SettleForLove was launched in late 2014 by HereKittyKitty LLC.[3] Co-founders David Wheeler and Jacob Thompson launched the site after Wheeler's years of online dating frustrations.[4] Due to the unique concepts, SFL has received publicity across the United States and Canada.[5][6] In Q1 2016, SettleForLove launched both Android & Apple apps to accompany the website.[7]
