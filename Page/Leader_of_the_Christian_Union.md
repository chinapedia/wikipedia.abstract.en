History

The Leaders outwardly act as the 'figurehead' and the main representative of the party. Within the party, they must ensure political consensus. At election time the Leader is always the Lijsttrekker (top candidate) of the party list. Outside election time the Leader can serves as the Opposition leader. In the Christian Union the Leader is often the Parliamentary leader in the House of Representatives. One Christian Union leader became a Minister in a Cabinet.
