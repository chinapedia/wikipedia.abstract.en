_CANU HELEDD_ (modern Welsh /'kani 'hɛlɛð/, the songs of Heledd) are a collection of early Welsh _englyn_-poems. They are rare among medieval Welsh poems for being set in the mouth of a female character.


Summary

Dorothy Ann Bray summarised the cycle thus:

  The entire cycle of the Heledd poems ... is a statement of mourning from which a background story has been deduced: Cynddylan, prince of Powys, and his brothers along with his heroic band are slain in battle, defending their country against the English in the mid-seventh century. Heledd, his sister, is one of the few survivors, who witnessed the battle and the destruction of Cynddylan's hall at Pengwern. She has lost not only all her brothers, but also her sisters and her home, and the poems suggest that she blames herself for the destruction of Cynddylan's court because of some ill-spoken words.[1]

As with the other so-called 'saga _englynion_’ (pre-eminently _Canu Llywarch Hen_ and _Canu Urien_), there is considerable uncertainty and debate as to how the poems of _Canu Heledd_ might originally have been performed. It is usually assumed that they must have been accompanied by some kind of prose narrative, to which they provided emotional depth; but this is not certain.[2]

Manuscripts and dating

The poems are attested principally in the Red Book of Hergest, which was written between about 1382 and 1410. They were also included in the White Book of Rhydderch, but are now lost due to damage to the manuscript. However, they are attested in two later manuscripts descended from the White Book, Peniarth 111 (made by John Jones of Gellillyfdy in 1607), whose spelling is very close to the White Book's, and London, British Library, Add. MS 31055 (made by Thomas Wiliems in 1596), which is a less conservative copy.[4] Some other late copies of lost medieval manuscripts of the _englynion_ also exist: National Library of Wales 4973 contains two copies of the cycle, both copied by Dr John Davies of Mallwyd, one of Wales's leading antiquarians and scribes of his day, before 1631.[5] The first copy, NLW 4973a, derives from a lost manuscript closer to the White Book than the Red. The second copy, NLW 4973b, is more complex and may represent a conflation of multiple medieval sources, but seems to have at least some independent value as a witness to the lost archetype of the poems. It is fairly clear that all these manuscripts descend from a lost common original, to which they are all fairly similar, making the creation of a critical edition of the poems relatively straightforward.[6]

Despite surviving first in manuscripts written between about 1382 and 1410 and in largely Middle Welsh orthography, _Canu Heledd_ are thought mostly to have been composed in Old Welsh and transmitted orally and/or in manuscript, due to their archaic style and occasionally archaic spelling: Jenny Rowland dates the cycle to c. 800-900.[7]


Historicity

Although neither Cynddylan nor Heledd are attested in historical sources such as the Harleian genealogies, Cynddylan is the subject of a lament in _awdl_-metre, _Marwnad Cynddylan_ (not to be confused with the _englynion_ of the same title in _Canu Heledd_), which is thought to date from the time of his death, and scholars have not doubted that Cynddylan and Heledd were historical figures in seventh-century Powys. However, while some scholars have thought of other details of _Canu Heledd_ as also being good evidence for seventh-century events, other sources suggest that seventh-century relations between Mercia and Powys were more cordial, and that there was no catastrophic invasion of Powys by the English in this period. Such invasions did characterise the ninth century, however, when _Canu Heledd_ was probably composed. Thus the poems are generally now thought more to reflect ninth-century imaginings of what the seventh century must have been like, telling us more about ninth-century realities than seventh-century ones.[8][9][10] Some commentators even consider a tenth-century date for the origin of the text.[11]

Heledd has been supposed by some commentators to have 'taken over the mantle of the old Celtic goddess of sovereignty', but there is no substantial evidence for this.[12][13]

Appearances in popular culture

Heledd's reception in post-medieval texts has been surveyed by Marged Haycock.[15] These include the novella _Tywyll Heno_ by Kate Roberts.[16]
