MUHAMMAD ALI VS. LEON SPINKS was the World Boxing Council professional boxing match contested on February 15, 1978 in Las Vegas, Nevada for the Undisputed Heavyweight Championship.


Background

After his unanimous decision victory against Earnie Shavers, Muhammad Ali decided to face 1976 Olympic Gold medalist Leon Spinks, knowing that he'd have to face Ken Norton for the fourth time or lose his WBC belt, after the No 1 ranked Norton beat No 2 ranked Jimmy Young in a title eliminator in November 1977.[1]


The fight

The 10–1 underdog Spinks ended up winning two of the scorecards 145–140 and 144–141, while the third was 142–143 giving him a split decision win. Spinks became the Undisputed Heavyweight Champion after only eight professional bouts, and the only man ever to defeat Ali in a title match. [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]


Aftermath

This bout was named the Ring Magazine upset of the year.

_Sports Illustrated_ covered the bout, and with that historic upset put Leon Spinks on the magazine cover. Spinks was later stripped of his WBC heavyweight title for refusing to fight no. 1 contender Norton. Instead, Spinks signed for a rematch with Ali at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. The rematch took place on September 15, 1978, for the World Boxing Association and Lineal Heavyweight Champion titles. Ali regained the title with a Unanimous Decision over Spinks.
