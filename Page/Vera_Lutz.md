VERA CONSTANCE LUTZ, Smith, (1912â€“1976) was a British economist. She was married to German economist Friedrich Lutz.


Career

Smith was born in Kent, England, and studied at the London School of Economics between 1930 and 1935 for a PhD. In 1937, she married German economist Friedrich Lutz, and the couple moved to Princeton University prior to the start of the Second World War, and moved to Zurich in 1951.[1] Lutz's main areas of study were credit theory, economic development theory and labour economics.[2] Vera and Friedrich's 1951 work _Theory of Investment of the Firm_ was said to have "greatly influenced modern capital theory, and would remain a major source of reference for the next decade".[3] Lutz's work _Italy, a Study in Economic Development_ used neoclassical economics, and focused on the differences between Northern and Southern Italy, and the monopolistic behaviour of Italian industry.[4] Vera and Friedrich had been invited to Italy by the Banca d'Italia.[5]
