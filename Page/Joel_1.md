Verse 1

-   The name "Joel" means "one to whom Jehovah is God," that is, "worshipper of Jehovah". The prophet seems to have belonged to Judah, as no reference occurs to Israel; whereas he speaks of Jerusalem, the temple, the priests, and the ceremonies, as if he were intimately familiar with them (compare ).[6]
