KATE RACCULIA is an American author whose novels include _ Rhapsody_ (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2014), _This Must Be the Place_ (Henry Holt and Company, 2010), and Tuesday Mooney Talks to Ghosts: An Adventure , 2019.[1] Her work has been described as "an artful mix of genres"[2] but she has also been classified as a mystery novelist.[3]

_ Rhapsody_ was named a "best book of the summer" by _Publishers Weekly_ in 2015[4] and won an Alex Award in the same year. This award is given to books written for adults that have special appeal to young adults and is given annually by the American Library Association. The award committee described the book as "[h]igh-school students gather at the isolated Hotel for a statewide music festival only to be trapped by a blizzard with an arrogant fingerless conductor, drunken chaperones, a missing corpse, and perhaps the ghosts of long-dead newlyweds."[5]

Racculia was born in 1980[6] in Syracuse, New York, and currently resides in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where she is a member of the Bach Choir of Bethlehem. She is a graduate of both the University of Buffalo and Emerson College. She owns two cats and "wants to be Jessica Fletcher when she grows up".[7]
