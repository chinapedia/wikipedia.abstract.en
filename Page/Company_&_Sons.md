COMPANY & SONS was an early underground comix publisher based in San Francisco, run by John Bagley. The company operated from 1970–1973.

Creators associated with Company & Sons included Rory Hayes, Dan O'Neill, Charles Dallas, Vaughn Bodē, Bobby London, and Larry Todd. Company & Sons was the first publisher of the long-running anthology _Young Lust_.


History

In 1970 Company & Sons published Rory Hayes' _Bogeyman Comics_ #3 (taking over from the San Francisco Comic Book Company),[1] Wink Boyer's _Buzzard_,[2] Boyer & Dave Geiser's _Honky Tonk_, and the anthology _Hee Hee Comics_ (which was produced "in conjunction with The San Francisco Comic Book Co., Gary E. Arlington, prop.").[3]

But the company hit pay dirt in October 1970 with Jay Kinney & Bill Griffith's _Young Lust_ (which had been previously turned down by fellow San Francisco-based underground publishers Print Mint, Rip Off Press, and Last Gasp).[4][5] The first printing of 10,000 copies sold out almost immediately, leading to more printings and more sales.[6] Despite the first issue's success, however, Griffith and Kinney were dubious about Company & Son's accounting practices,[7] so they brought issue #2 to Print Mint. (The bulk of _Young Lust_'s run was ultimately published by Last Gasp.)

In 1971 Company & Sons published three issues of _Dan O'Neill's Comics and Stories_ and Larry Todd's _Tales of the Armorkins_.

In 1972 the company published the _All Duck_ anthology, Vaughn Bodē's _The Collected Cheech Wizard_, Bobby London's _The Dirty Duck Book_, editor Bill Surski's _Drool Magazine_ anthology, the anthology _Paranoia_, and the first issue of Charles Dallas' _Psychotic Adventures Illustrated_ (issues #2 [Oct. 1973] and #3 [June 1974] were picked up by Last Gasp).[8]

In 1973 the company published Paul McKenna's _Folk Funnies_.

The company went out of business in 1973; reportedly, publisher Bagley claimed he had a fatal disease.[9] The reality is that the company suffered from poor sales due to mediocre products.

Very little is documented about Bagley other than he was an avid collector of _Classics Illustrated_.[10] He was seen in 2001 by Last Gasp publisher Ron Turner, where Bagley was making jewelry while based on a farm in Northern California.[11]
