_HAPLOPORUS THINDII_ is a species of poroid crust fungus in the family Polyporaceae. Found in China and India, it causes a white rot in woody substrates.


Taxonomy

The fungus was first described from south India in 1993 as _Pachykytospora thindii_.[1] In 2002, Yu-Cheng Dai and colleagues treated the genus _Pachykytospora_ as a synonym of _Haploporus_,[2] and he subsequently transferred this fungus to _Haploporus_.[3]


Description

Fruit bodies of _Haploporus thindii_ are crust-like, with a dimensions of up to long, wide, and 0.8 mm thick in the central part. The pore surface is coloured cream to pinkish-buff and has a corky texture. There is a distinct margin up to 5 mm wide that surrounds the crust. The angular pores number about three to four per millimetre.[4]

_Haploporus thindii_ has a dimitic hyphal system (containing both generative and skeletal hyphae), and most of the generative hyphae feature clamp connections. The basidia are barrel shaped, with four sterigmata and a clamp at the base. The spores are ellipsoidal and thick-walled, measuring 20–37 by 6.5–9.1 μm.[5]


Habitat and distribution

_Haploporus thindii_ has been reported from South India, and in 2005 was reported in the Xizang Autonomous Region in southwestern China. The Chinese collections were found growing on the decomposing wood of honeysuckles (genus _Lonicera_) and maple (_Acer_).[6] It has also been recorded in Taiwan.[7]
