The STEFAN BERGMAN PRIZE is a mathematics award, funded by the estate of the widow of mathematician Stefan Bergman and supported by the American Mathematical Society. The award is granted for mathematical research in: "1) the theory of the kernel function and its applications in real and complex analysis; or 2) function-theoretic methods in the theory of partial differential equations of elliptic type with attention to Bergman's operator method."[1]

The award is given in honor of Stefan Bergman, a mathematician known for his work on complex analysis. Recipients of the prize are selected by a committee of judges appointed by the American Mathematical Society. The monetary value of the prize is variable and based on the income from the prize fund; in 2005 the award was valued at approximately $17,000.[2]
