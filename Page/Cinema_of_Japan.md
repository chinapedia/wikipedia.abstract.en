The has a history that spans more than 100 years. Japan has one of the oldest and largest film industries in the world; as of 2010, it was the fourth largest by number of feature films produced.[1] In 2011 Japan produced 411 feature films that earned 54.9% of a box office total of US$2.338 billion.[2] Films have been produced in Japan since 1897, when the first foreign cameramen arrived.

In a _Sight & Sound_ list of the best films produced in Asia, Japanese works made up eight of the top 12, with _Tokyo Story_ (1953) ranked number one. _Tokyo Story_ also topped the 2012 _Sight & Sound_ directors' poll of The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time, dethroning _Citizen Kane_,[3][4] while Akira Kurosawa's _Seven Samurai_ (1954) was voted the greatest foreign-language film of all time in BBC's 2018 poll of 209 critics in 43 countries.[5] Japan has won the Academy Award for the Best Foreign Language Film four times, more than any other Asian country.


History

Early silent era

(Buntarō Futagawa)]] (Masahiro Makino)]]

The kinetoscope, first shown commercially by Thomas Edison in the United States in 1894, was first shown in Japan in November 1896. The Vitascope and the Lumière Brothers' Cinematograph were first presented in Japan in early 1897,[6] by businessmen such as Inabata Katsutaro.[7] Lumière cameramen were the first to shoot films in Japan.[8] Moving pictures, however, were not an entirely new experience for the Japanese because of their rich tradition of pre-cinematic devices such as _gentō_ (_utsushi-e_) or the magic lantern.[9][10] The first successful Japanese film in late 1897 showed sights in Tokyo.[11]

In 1898 some ghost films were made, the Shirō Asano shorts _Bake Jizo_ (Jizo the Spook / 化け地蔵) and _Shinin no sosei_ (Resurrection of a Corpse).[12] The first documentary, the short _Geisha no teodori_ (芸者の手踊り), was made in June 1899. Tsunekichi Shibata made a number of early films, including _Momijigari_, an 1899 record of two famous actors performing a scene from a well-known kabuki play. Early films were influenced by traditional theater – for example, kabuki and bunraku.

At the dawn of the twentieth century theaters in Japan hired benshi, storytellers who sat next to the screen and narrated silent movies. They were descendants of kabuki jōruri, kōdan storytellers, theater barkers and other forms of oral storytelling.[13] Benshi could be accompanied by music like silent films from cinema of the West. With the advent of sound in the early 1930s, the benshi gradually declined.

In 1908, Shōzō Makino, considered the pioneering director of Japanese film, began his influential career with _Honnōji gassen_ (本能寺合戦), produced for Yokota Shōkai. Shōzō recruited Matsunosuke Onoe, a former kabuki actor, to star in his productions. Onoe became Japan's first film star, appearing in over 1,000 films, mostly shorts, between 1909 and 1926. The pair pioneered the _jidaigeki_ genre.[14] Tokihiko Okada was a popular romantic lead of the same era.

The first Japanese film production studio was built in 1909 by the Yoshizawa Shōten company in Tokyo.[15]

The first female Japanese performer to appear in a film professionally was the dancer/actress Tokuko Nagai Takagi, who appeared in four shorts for the American-based Thanhouser Company between 1911 and 1914.[16]

Among intellectuals, critiques of Japanese cinema grew in the 1910s and eventually developed into a movement that transformed Japanese film. Film criticism began with early film magazines such as _Katsudō shashinkai_ (begun in 1909) and a full-length book written by Yasunosuke Gonda in 1914, but many early film critics often focused on chastising the work of studios like Nikkatsu and Tenkatsu for being too theatrical (using, for instance, elements from kabuki and shinpa such as onnagata) and for not utilizing what were considered more cinematic techniques to tell stories, instead relying on benshi. In what was later named the Pure Film Movement, writers in magazines such as _Kinema Record_ called for a broader use of such cinematic techniques. Some of these critics, such as Norimasa Kaeriyama, went on to put their ideas into practice by directing such films as _The Glow of Life_ (1918), which was one of the first films to use actresses (in this case, Harumi Hanayagi). There were parallel efforts elsewhere in the film industry. In his 1917 film _The Captain's Daughter_, Masao Inoue started using techniques new to the silent film era, such as the close-up and cut back. The Pure Film Movement was central in the development of the gendaigeki and scriptwriting.[17]

1920s

New studios established around 1920, such as Shochiku and Taikatsu, aided the cause for reform. At Taikatsu, Thomas Kurihara directed films scripted by the novelist Junichiro Tanizaki, who was a strong advocate of film reform.[18] Even Nikkatsu produced reformist films under the direction of Eizō Tanaka. By the mid-1920s, actresses had replaced onnagata and films used more of the devices pioneered by Inoue. Some of the most discussed silent films from Japan are those of Kenji Mizoguchi, whose later works (e.g., _The Life of Oharu_) are still highly regarded.

Japanese films gained popularity in the mid-1920s against foreign films, in part fueled by the popularity of movie stars and a new style of jidaigeki. Directors such as Daisuke Itō and Masahiro Makino made samurai films like _A Diary of Chuji's Travels_ and _Roningai_ featuring rebellious antiheroes in fast-cut fight scenes that were both critically acclaimed and commercial successes.[19] Some stars, such as Tsumasaburo Bando, Kanjūrō Arashi, Chiezō Kataoka, Takako Irie and Utaemon Ichikawa, were inspired by Makino Film Productions and formed their own independent production companies where directors such as Hiroshi Inagaki, Mansaku Itami and Sadao Yamanaka honed their skills. Director Teinosuke Kinugasa created a production company to produce the experimental masterpiece _A Page of Madness_, starring Masao Inoue, in 1926.[20] Many of these companies, while surviving during the silent era against major studios like Nikkatsu, Shochiku, Teikine, and Toa Studios, could not survive the cost involved in converting to sound.

With the rise of left-wing political movements and labor unions at the end of the 1920s arose so-called tendency films with left-wing "tendencies", with prominent examples being directed by Kenji Mizoguchi, Daisuke Itō, Shigeyoshi Suzuki, and Tomu Uchida. In contrast with these commercially produced 35 mm films, the Marxist Proletarian Film League of Japan (Prokino) made works independently in smaller gauges (such as 9.5mm and 16mm), with more radical intentions.[21] Tendency films suffered from severe censorship heading into the 1930s, and Prokino members were arrested and the movement effectively crushed. Such moves by the government had profound effects on the expression of political dissent in 1930s cinema. Films from this period include: _Sakanaya Honda, Jitsuroku Chushingura, Horaijima, Orochi, Maboroshi, Kurutta Ippeji, Jujiro, Kurama Tengu: Kyōfu Jidai_, and _Kurama Tengu_.[22]

A later version of _The Captain's Daughter_ was one of the first talkie films. It used the Mina Talkie System. The Japanese film industry later split into two groups; one retained the Mina Talkie System, while the other used the Iisutofyon Talkie System used to make Tojo Masaki's films.

The 1923 earthquake, the bombing of Tokyo during World War II, and the natural effects of time and Japan's humidity on inflammable and unstable nitrate film have resulted in a great dearth of surviving films from this period.

1930s

's 1937 _Humanity and Paper Balloons_]] Unlike in the West, silent films were still being produced in Japan well into the 1930s; as late as 1938, a third of Japanese films were silent.[23] For instance, Yasujirō Ozu's _An Inn in Tokyo_ (1935), considered a precursor to the neorealism genre, was a silent film. A few Japanese sound shorts were made in the 1920s and 1930s, but Japan's first feature-length talkie was _Fujiwara Yoshie no furusato_ (1930), which used the _Mina Talkie System_. Notable talkies of this period include Mikio Naruse's _Wife, Be Like A Rose!_ (_Tsuma Yo Bara No Yoni_, 1935), which was one of the first Japanese films to gain a theatrical release in the U.S.; Kenji Mizoguchi's _Sisters of the Gion_ (_Gion no shimai_, 1936); _Osaka Elegy_ (1936); and _The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums_ (1939); and Sadao Yamanaka's _Humanity and Paper Balloons_ (1937).

Film criticism shared this vitality, with many film journals such as _Kinema Junpo_ and newspapers printing detailed discussions of the cinema of the day, both at home and abroad. A cultured "impressionist" criticism pursued by critics such as Tadashi Iijima, Fuyuhiko Kitagawa, and Matsuo Kishi was dominant, but opposed by leftist critics such as Akira Iwasaki and Genjū Sasa who sought an ideological critique of films.[24]

The 1930s also saw increased government involvement in cinema, which was symbolized by the passing of the Film Law, which gave the state more authority over the film industry, in 1939. The government encouraged some forms of cinema, producing propaganda films and promoting documentary films (also called _bunka eiga_ or "culture films"), with important documentaries being made by directors such as Fumio Kamei.[25] Realism was in favor; film theorists such as Taihei Imamura and Heiichi Sugiyama advocated for documentary or realist drama, while directors such as Hiroshi Shimizu and Tomotaka Tasaka produced fiction films that were strongly realistic in style.

1940s

Because of World War II and the weak economy, unemployment became widespread in Japan, and the cinema industry suffered.

During this period, when Japan was expanding its Empire, the Japanese government saw cinema as a propaganda tool to show the glory and invincibility of the Empire of Japan. Thus, many films from this period depict patriotic and militaristic themes. In 1942 Kajiro Yamamoto's film _Hawai Mare oki kaisen_ or "The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya" portrayed the attack on Pearl Harbor; the film made use of special effects directed by Eiji Tsuburaya, including a miniature scale model of Pearl Harbor itself.

Akira Kurosawa made his feature film debut with _Sugata Sanshiro_ in 1943. The first collaborations between Kurosawa and actor Toshiro Mifune were _Drunken Angel_ in 1948 and _Stray Dog_ in 1949. Yasujirō Ozu directed the critically and commercially successful _Late Spring_ in 1949.

The Mainichi Film Award was created in 1946.[26]

With the SCAP occupation following the end of World War II, Japan was exposed to over a decade's worth of American animation that had been banned under the war-time government.

1950s

'' (Yasujirō Ozu, 1953)]] '' (Kenji Mizoguchi, 1953)]]

The 1950s are widely considered the Golden Age of Japanese cinema.[27] Three Japanese films from this decade (_Rashomon_, _Seven Samurai_ and _Tokyo Story_) appeared in the top ten of _Sight & Sound_{{'}}s critics' and directors' polls for the best films of all time in 2002.[28] They also appeared in the 2012 polls,[29][30] with _Tokyo Story_ (1953) dethroning _Citizen Kane_ at the top of the 2012 directors' poll.[31]

The period after the American Occupation led to a rise in diversity in movie distribution thanks to the increased output and popularity of the film studios of Toho, Daiei, Shochiku, Nikkatsu, and Toei. This period gave rise to the four great artists of Japanese cinema: Masaki Kobayashi, Akira Kurosawa, Kenji Mizoguchi, and Yasujirō Ozu. Each director dealt with the effects the war and subsequent occupation by America in unique and innovative ways.

The decade started with Akira Kurosawa's _Rashomon_ (1950), which won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1951 and the Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1952, and marked the entrance of Japanese cinema onto the world stage. It was also the breakout role for legendary star Toshiro Mifune.[32] In 1953 _Entotsu no mieru basho_ by Heinosuke Gosho was in competition at the 3rd Berlin International Film Festival.

The first Japanese film in color was _Carmen Comes Home_ directed by Keisuke Kinoshita and released in 1951. There was also a black-and-white version of this film available. _Tokyo File 212_ (1951) was the first American feature film to be shot entirely in Japan. The lead roles were played by Florence Marly and Robert Peyton. It featured the geisha Ichimaru in a short cameo. Suzuki Ikuzo's Tonichi Enterprises Company co-produced the film.[33] _Gate of Hell_, a 1953 film by Teinosuke Kinugasa, was the first movie that filmed using Eastmancolor film, _Gate of Hell_ was both Daiei's first color film and the first Japanese color movie to be released outside Japan, receiving an Academy Honorary Award in 1954 for Best Costume Design by Sanzo Wada and an Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It also won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, the first Japanese film to achieve that honour.

'' (Ishirō Honda, 1954)]]

The year 1954 saw two of Japan's most influential films released. The first was the Kurosawa epic _Seven Samurai_, about a band of hired samurai who protect a helpless village from a rapacious gang of thieves. The same year, Ishirō Honda directed the anti-nuclear monster-drama _Godzilla_, which was released in America as _Godzilla, King of the Monsters_. Though edited for its Western release, Godzilla became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of _kaiju_ films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history. Also in 1954, another Kurosawa film, _Ikiru_ was in competition at the 4th Berlin International Film Festival.

In 1955, Hiroshi Inagaki won an Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film for Part I of his _Samurai_ trilogy and in 1958 won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival for _Rickshaw Man_. Kon Ichikawa directed two anti-war dramas: _The Burmese Harp_ (1956), which was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards, and _Fires On The Plain_ (1959), along with _Enjo_ (1958), which was adapted from Yukio Mishima's novel _Temple Of The Golden Pavilion_. Masaki Kobayashi made three films which would collectively become known as _The Human Condition Trilogy_: _No Greater Love_ (1959), and _The Road To Eternity_ (1959). The trilogy was completed in 1961, with _A Soldier's Prayer_.

Kenji Mizoguchi, who died in 1956, ended his career with a series of masterpieces including _The Life of Oharu_ (1952), _Ugetsu_ (1953) and _Sansho the Bailiff_ (1954). He won the Silver Bear at the Venice Film Festival for _Ugetsu_. Mizoguchi's films often deal with the tragedies inflicted on women by Japanese society. Mikio Naruse made _Repast_ (1950), _Late Chrysanthemums_ (1954), _The Sound of the Mountain_ (1954) and _Floating Clouds_ (1955). Yasujirō Ozu began directing color films beginning with _Equinox Flower_ (1958), and later _Good Morning_ (1959) and _Floating Weeds_ (1958), which was adapted from his earlier silent _A Story of Floating Weeds_ (1934), and was shot by _Rashomon_ and _Sansho the Bailiff_ cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa.

The Blue Ribbon Awards were established in 1950. The first winner for Best Film was _Until We Meet Again_ by Tadashi Imai.

1960s

The number of films produced, and the cinema audience reached a peak in the 1960s.[34] Most films were shown in double bills, with one half of the bill being a "program picture" or B-movie. A typical program picture was shot in four weeks. The demand for these program pictures in quantity meant the growth of film series such as _The Hoodlum Soldier_ or _Akumyo_.

The huge level of activity of 1960s Japanese cinema also resulted in many classics. Akira Kurosawa directed the 1961 classic _Yojimbo_. Yasujirō Ozu made his final film, _An Autumn Afternoon_, in 1962. Mikio Naruse directed the wide screen melodrama _When a Woman Ascends the Stairs_ in 1960; his final film was 1967's _Scattered Clouds_.

Kon Ichikawa captured the watershed 1964 Olympics in his three-hour documentary _Tokyo Olympiad_ (1965). Seijun Suzuki was fired by Nikkatsu for "making films that don't make any sense and don't make any money" after his surrealist yakuza flick _Branded to Kill_ (1967).

The 1960s were the peak years of the _Japanese New Wave_ movement, which began in the 1950s and continued through the early 1970s. Nagisa Oshima, Kaneto Shindo, Masahiro Shinoda, Susumu Hani and Shohei Imamura emerged as major filmmakers during the decade. Oshima's _Cruel Story of Youth_, _Night and Fog in Japan_ and _Death By Hanging_, along with Shindo's _Onibaba_, Hani's _Kanojo to kare_ and Imamura's _The Insect Woman_, became some of the better-known examples of Japanese New Wave filmmaking. Documentary played a crucial role in the New Wave, as directors such as Hani, Kazuo Kuroki, Toshio Matsumoto, and Hiroshi Teshigahara moved from documentary into fiction film, while feature filmmakers like Oshima and Imamura also made documentaries. Shinsuke Ogawa and Noriaki Tsuchimoto became the most important documentarists: "two figures [that] tower over the landscape of Japanese documentary."[35]

Teshigahara's _Woman in the Dunes_ (1964) won the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and was nominated for Best Director and Best Foreign Language Film Oscars. Masaki Kobayashi's _Kwaidan_ (1965) also picked up the Special Jury Prize at Cannes and received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. _Bushido, Samurai Saga_ by Tadashi Imai won the Golden Bear at the 13th Berlin International Film Festival. _Immortal Love_ by Keisuke Kinoshita and _Twin Sisters of Kyoto_ and _Portrait of Chieko_, both by Noboru Nakamura, also received nominations for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. _Lost Spring_, also by Nakamura, was in competition for the Golden Bear at the 17th Berlin International Film Festival.

1970s

]]

The 1970s saw the cinema audience drop due to the spread of television. Total audience declined from 1.2 billion in 1960 to 0.2 billion in 1980.[36] Film companies fought back in various ways, such as the bigger budget films of Kadokawa Pictures, or including increasingly sexual or violent content and language which could not be shown on television. The resulting pink film industry became the stepping stone for many young independent filmmakers. The seventies also saw the start of the "idol eiga", films starring young "idols", who would bring in audiences due to their fame and popularity.

Toshiya Fujita made the revenge film _Lady Snowblood_ in 1973. In the same year, Yoshishige Yoshida made the film _Coup d'État_, a portrait of Ikki Kita, the leader of the Japanese coup of February 1936. Its experimental cinematography and mise-en-scène, as well as its avant-garde score by Ichiyanagi Sei, garnered it wide critical acclaim within Japan.

In 1976 the Hochi Film Award was created. The first winner for Best Film was _The Inugamis_ by Kon Ichikawa. Nagisa Oshima directed _In the Realm of the Senses_ (1976), a film detailing a crime of passion involving Sada Abe set in the 1930s. Controversial for its explicit sexual content, it has never been seen uncensored in Japan.

Kinji Fukasaku completed the epic _Battles Without Honor and Humanity_ series of yakuza films. Yoji Yamada introduced the commercially successful _Tora-San_ series, while also directing other films, notably the popular _The Yellow Handkerchief_, which won the first Japan Academy Prize for Best Film in 1978. New wave filmmakers Susumu Hani and Shōhei Imamura retreated to documentary work, though Imamura made a dramatic return to feature filmmaking with _Vengeance Is Mine_ (1979).

_Dodes'ka-den_ by Akira Kurosawa and _Sandakan No. 8_ by Kei Kumai were nominated to the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

1980s

The 1980s saw the decline of the major Japanese film studios and their associated chains of cinemas, with major studios Toho and Toei barely staying in business, Shochiku supported almost solely by the _Otoko wa tsurai_ films, and Nikkatsu declining even further.

Of the older generation of directors, Akira Kurosawa directed _Kagemusha_ (1980), which won the Palme d'Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival, and _Ran_ (1985). Seijun Suzuki made a comeback beginning with _Zigeunerweisen_ in 1980. Shohei Imamura won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for _The Ballad of Narayama_ (1983). Yoshishige Yoshida made _A Promise_ (1986), his first film since 1973's _Coup d'État_.

New directors who appeared in the 80s include actor Juzo Itami, who directed his first film, _The Funeral_, in 1984, and achieved critical and box office success with _Tampopo_ in 1985. Kiyoshi Kurosawa, who would generate international attention beginning in the mid-1990s, made his initial debut with pink films and genre horror.

During the 1980s, anime gained in popularity, with new animated movies released every summer and winter, often based upon popular anime television series. Mamoru Oshii released his landmark _Angel's Egg_ in 1985. Hayao Miyazaki adapted his manga series _Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind_ into a feature film of the same name in 1984. Katsuhiro Otomo followed suit by adapting his own manga _Akira_ into a feature film of the same name in 1988.

Home video made possible the creation of a direct-to-video film industry.

1990s

Because of economic recessions, the number of movie theaters in Japan had been steadily decreasing since the 1960s. The 1990s saw the reversal of this trend and the introduction of the Multiplex in Japan.

Takeshi Kitano emerged as a significant filmmaker with works such as _Sonatine_ (1993), _Kids Return_ (1996) and _Hana-bi_ (1997), which was given the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Shōhei Imamura again won the Golden Palm (shared with Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami), this time for _The Eel_ (1997). He became the fifth two-time recipient, joining Alf Sjöberg, Francis Ford Coppola, Emir Kusturica and Bille August.

Kiyoshi Kurosawa gained international recognition following the release of _Cure_ (1997). Takashi Miike launched a prolific career with titles such as _Audition_ (1999), _Dead or Alive_ (1999) and _The Bird People in China_ (1998). Former documentary filmmaker Hirokazu Koreeda launched an acclaimed feature career with _Maborosi_ (1996) and _After Life_ (1999).

Hayao Miyazaki directed two mammoth box office and critical successes, _Porco Rosso_ (1992) – which beat _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial_ (1982) as the highest-grossing film in Japan – and _Princess Mononoke_ (1997), which also claimed the top box office spot until _Titanic_ (1997).

Several new anime directors rose to widespread recognition, bringing with them notions of anime as not only entertainment, but modern art. Mamoru Oshii released the internationally acclaimed philosophical science fiction action film _Ghost in the Shell_ in 1996. Satoshi Kon directed the award-winning psychological thriller _Perfect Blue_. Hideaki Anno also gained considerable recognition with _The End of Evangelion_ in 1997.

2000s

The number of movies being shown in Japan steadily increased, with about 821 films released in 2006. Movies based on Japanese television series were especially popular during this period. Anime films now accounted for 60 percent of Japanese film production. The 1990s and 2000s are considered to be "Japanese Cinema's Second Golden Age", due to the immense popularity of anime, both within Japan and overseas.[37]

Although not a commercial success, _All About Lily Chou-Chou_ directed by Shunji Iwai was honored at the Berlin, the Yokohama and the Shanghai Film Festivals in 2001. Takeshi Kitano appeared in _Battle Royale_ and directed and starred in _Dolls_ and _Zatoichi_. Several horror films, _Kairo_, _Dark Water_, _Yogen_, the _Grudge_ series and _One Missed Call_ met with commercial success. In 2004, _Godzilla: Final Wars_, directed by Ryuhei Kitamura, was released to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Godzilla. In 2005, director Seijun Suzuki made his 56th film, _Princess Raccoon_. Hirokazu Koreeda claimed film festival awards around the world with two of his films _Distance_ and _Nobody Knows_. Female film director Naomi Kawase's film _The Mourning Forest_ won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007. Yoji Yamada, director of the Otoko wa Tsurai yo series, made a trilogy of acclaimed revisionist samurai films, 2002's _Twilight Samurai_, followed by _The Hidden Blade_ in 2004 and _Love and Honor_ in 2006.

In anime, Hayao Miyazaki directed _Spirited Away_ in 2001, breaking Japanese box office records and winning several awards—including the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2003[38]—followed by _Howl's Moving Castle_ and _Ponyo_ in 2004 and 2008 respectively. In 2004, Mamoru Oshii released the anime movie _Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence_ which received critical praise around the world. His 2008 film _The Sky Crawlers_ was met with similarly positive international reception. Satoshi Kon also released three quieter, but nonetheless highly successful films: _Millennium Actress_, _Tokyo Godfathers_, and _Paprika_. Katsuhiro Otomo released _Steamboy_, his first animated project since the 1995 short film compilation _Memories_, in 2004. In collaboration with Studio 4C, American director Michael Arias released _Tekkon Kinkreet_ in 2008, to international acclaim. After several years of directing primarily lower-key live-action films, Hideaki Anno formed his own production studio and revisited his still-popular _Evangelion_ franchise with the _Rebuild of Evangelion_ tetralogy, a new series of films providing an alternate retelling of the original story.

In February 2000, the Japan Film Commission Promotion Council was established. On November 16, 2001, the Japanese Foundation for the Promotion of the Arts laws were presented to the House of Representatives. These laws were intended to promote the production of media arts, including film scenery, and stipulate that the government – on both the national and local levels – must lend aid in order to preserve film media. The laws were passed on November 30 and came into effect on December 7. In 2003, at a gathering for the Agency of Cultural Affairs, twelve policies were proposed in a written report to allow public-made films to be promoted and shown at the Film Center of the National Museum of Modern Art.

2010s

Four films have so far received international recognition by being selected to compete in major film festivals: _Caterpillar_ by Kōji Wakamatsu was in competition for the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival and won the Silver Bear for Best Actress, _Outrage_ by Takeshi Kitano was In Competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, _Himizu_ by Sion Sono was in competition for the Golden Lion at the 68th Venice International Film Festival.

In 2011, Takashi Miike's _Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai_ was In Competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, the first 3D film ever to screen In Competition at Cannes. The film was co-produced by British independent producer Jeremy Thomas, who had successfully broken Japanese titles such as Nagisa Oshima's _Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence_ and '' Taboo'', Takeshi Kitano's _Brother_, and Miike's _13 Assassins_ onto the international stage as producer.

In 2018, Hirokazu Kore-Eda won the Palme d'Or for his movie _Shoplifters_ at the 71st Cannes Film Festival, a festival that also featured Ryūsuke Hamaguchi's _Asako I & II_ in competition.
