The OUR LADY OF REMEDIES CATHEDRAL[1] () Also RIOHACHA CATHEDRAL Is a temple of the Catholic Church consecrated to the Virgin of the Remedies.[2] It is the headquarters of the Diocese of Riohacha and therefore, seat of the titular Bishop.

It was built between 1835 and 1852. In 1906 the facade was reformed, giving it more artistic and marked style, preventing it from collapsing in addition to composing the walls and placed the four altars of Marble next to the Altar major, which would raise a dome.
