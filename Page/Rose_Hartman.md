Career

Hartman is known for her celebrity portraiture.[5] Her photograph of Bianca Jagger riding a white horse at the Studio 54 nightclub at her 30th birthday party is widely known as her most recognizable photo.[6][7] Lloyd Grove, writing in _The Daily Beast_, describes it in 2016 as "the iconic image of a long-lost age."[8] Another well-known photograph portrays Jerry Hall in conversation with Andy Warhol.[9] Her photographs have been published in newspapers and magazines, including _Allure_, _Art+Auction_, _Elle_, _Harper's Bazaar_, _Panorama_, _The New York Times_, _New York_, _Stern_, _Vanity Fair_ and _Vogue_.[10][11]

In addition to documenting celebrities, the jet set, actors, singers, and authors, Hartman was the first to move behind the curtains of Fashion Week catwalks to shoot models and designers backstage as shown in her first book "Birds of Paradise: An Intimate View of the New York Fashion World." In 2011–12, a retrospective of her work including more than 60 photographs was held at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. Her archival images have also been exhibited at the Ravestijn Gallery in Amsterdam, The Netherlands (2012) and in Punta del Este, Uruguay (2013), as well as at American museums including the Experience Music Project, The Whitney Museum and Museum of the City of New York; a selection of her photographs is also on permanent display at Omar’s, a private dining members club in Greenwich Village.
