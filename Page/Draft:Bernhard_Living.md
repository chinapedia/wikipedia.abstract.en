BERNHARD LIVING is an experimental music composer, and former multi-instrumentalist and digital arts curator. He studied composition with the South African-born composer professor Stanley Glasser at Goldsmiths College, University of London, and philosophy at Middlesex University. He was active as a musician in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, playing alto saxophone and flute. During this period, he performed with a large number of different groups and ensembles, and across a wide range of genres, including art-rock, avant-garde jazz, contemporary classical, experimental music, jazz-rock, free form jazz and post-punk, and is a featured artist on a number of jazz, rock and post-punk albums. Besides performing under his given name, he has also used a number of different spellings and alias', including Bernard Living, Bernie Living and Lee Buick. In the 1990s he was the director of BN1, an autonomous non-profit Brighton-based arts organization that commissioned gallery-based installation art and art using digital technologies. He returned to music in 2001 to develop his own digitally-based compositional practice.


Biography

Bernhard Living was born in London in 1948, and spent his childhood in Greenwich, South East London. During the late sixties and seventies he lived in Blackheath, South East London, where his circle of friends included the composer and double-bassist Barry Guy, the lighting designer and theatre director Peter Mumford, the trombonist and jazz musician Paul Rutherford and the composer Hugh Shrapnel. Other associates from this period include composer Hugh Davies.

In an online interview with the composer Benjamin Dwyer, Barry Guy reminisces: "I remember there was one very important thing for me. I suppose you could say it changed my life in the sense that I became aware of another area of music, which was not on my radar then. When we were in school, one lunch hour, we were working on some of our Dixie tunes and a friend of mine, Bernhard Living, who later played with the Mike Westbrook Orchestra as a saxophone player, came in with a Charles Mingus album. He put it on the record player and said we should be playing this music, not Dixie. Some of the guys said, "No, we don't want to play this rubbish," but I immediately heard this as something very important, so I said, "I want to play this." The result was a huge fight in the classroom and the record player went over and there were bloody noses! It was really serious and much frowned-upon by our music teacher. He lost the record player. . .".[1] Later in the interview, Guy adds: "When I took evening classes at Goldsmiths College, we were encouraged to write a piece at the end of the first year. The saxophonist Bernhard Living was also in this class. Remember my mentioning him in the Mingus saga? He was one of these guys who knew a lot about the American avant-garde. He knew all about the painters, the dancers. . . Merce Cunningham. . . he knew all about Rauschenberg, he just had a mercurial knowledge about everything, it seemed. I wrote a piece which had saxophone and trumpet cadenzas in it which were meant to be free. Bernhard was supposed to play the sax cadenza, but he decided he wanted to conduct my piece, as it was a bit difficult. So I heard of a guy called Paul Rutherford who was a trombone player. I found him in the local pub and asked him to play in my piece. He introduced me to the saxophonist Trevor Watts. So Paul and Trevor played in the piece, which wasn't a great work, but it was my first."[2]


Musician

As a musician, Bernhard Living performed with a number of leading composers and musical innovators across a wide variety of genres, including Cornelius Cardew, Hugh Davies, Barry Guy, Manfred Mann, Linder Sterling, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Mike Westbrook.

Living's jazz performance style and saxophone technique was heavily influenced by the American musicians Eric Dolphy and Albert Ayler, and his playing was described by Derek Jewell, the music critic for the Sunday Times, as being revolutionary.[3]

Living was a member of the Mike Westbrook Orchestra from 1968 to 1970, and toured with Westbrook to a number of venues throughout the UK. These included the Melody Maker poll winners' concert at the Royal Festival Hall, London, 1970. He is also a featured soloist of three of Westbrook's albums; _Celebration_ (1967) (Deram) _Release 1969_ (Deram)[4] and _Marching Song – Volumes 1 and 2_ (1969) (Deram)

It was through his association with the composer Hugh Davies that Living took part, as a temporary member of the Gentle Fire Ensemble, in the first UK performance of Karlheinz Stockhausen's Aus den sieben Tagen in London, 1969.

In 1969 Living joined the Manfred Mann Chapter Three group (1969 - 1970)[5][6], and toured extensively with them to major cities in America, continental Europe and the UK, performing in a number of leading music and art venues, including the Whisky a Go Go, Hollywood, Fillmore West, San Francisco, Fillmore East, New York, and the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), London. The group also made a number of appearances on British television, and while in Paris, the group made a tele-recording for French television[7]. Living also recorded two albums with the group; Manfred Mann Chapter Three (1969) (Vertigo) and Manfred Mann Chapter Three Volume Two (1970) (Vertigo).

Living was invited to take part in Barry Guy's large-scale land-mark orchestral project, the London Jazz Composer's Orchestra for the recording of Guy's composition, Ode. The first complete performance of _Ode_ was held in London at the Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in 1971, and the many artists who took part in the project were leading jazz musicians of the day. This performance was followed by a presentation at the English Bach Festival in Oxford in 1972, where the composition was recorded. From 1973 to 1975, Living was based in Cardiff, and worked as the musical director for the Moving Being Dance Company. The company itself had moved from The Place dance and performance centre in London, and took residence at the Chapter Arts Centre, Cardiff. As the then resident composer for the company, Living produced the music for their multimedia production _Sun_, which was premiered in Cardiff in 1974, and was also presented during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe later that year.

Performing under the alias of Lee Buick and playing tenor saxophone, Living worked with the Manchester-based post-punk group Ludus from 1982 to 1984[8]. He toured with the group throughout the UK, and the performances included the infamous opening night of The Haçienda Club in Manchester on the 5th of November, 1982. Living appeared with the band on a number of album and single releases, including Danger Came Smiling (1982) (New Hormones), _Nue Au Soleil (Complètement)_ (1987) (Interior Music) and the Damage Compilation (LTM) (2002). Living took part in a recording with Ludus for a John Peel session that was released on the 4th of August, 1982[9][10]

As a flutist, Bernhard Living gave public performances of compositions from the twentieth-century flute repertoire, including Luciano Berio's _Sequenza_; Pierre Boulez' _Sonatine for Flute_; John Cage's flute-only versions of Concert for Piano and Orchestra, Atlas Eclipticalis, Karlheinz Stockhausen's Aus den Sieben Tagen, Musik für Flöte, and Edgard Varèse's _Density 21.5._


Interim Period

Living temporarily retired from the music world in the mid-eighties to study for an undergraduate degree in philosophy, which he obtained 1986. His tutors included professor Peter Dews and professor Jonathan Reé who was a founding a member the journal Radical Philosophy.


Curator

As a digital arts curator, Living was influential in setting up the BN1 project in 1995, a Brighton-based autonomous arts organization, and later became its director. Described as a ‘museum without walls’, BN1 commissioned leading digital and installation artists, including Susan Collins, Anna Heinrich & Leon Palmer, Thomas Köner, Simon Poulter and Michael Petry to produce artworks for both traditional exhibition spaces and for the public domain. The commissioned projects include 1. A design and architectural collaboration with the sculptor and production designer Markus Blee, which was installed at the The Zap club, Brighton (1995) 2. Fastbuild (1996), a large-scale projection installation shown on the facade of the Unitarian Church, Brighton, by the artists Anna Heinrich & Leon Palmer[11], 3. You See What I Mean (1996) by Michael Petry for the Fabrica Gallery, Brighton[12] [13], 4. Microhenge (1999) by Simon Poulter co-commissioned by BN1 and Lighthouse, a large-scale installation that commemorated John Logie Baird's invention of television in Hastings and was shown at Hastings Museum and Art Gallery[14], 5. _Daikan_ (1999), a sound installation by the composer Thomas Köner, which was given the New Media Prize 2000 in Montreal [15] , 6. Contagion (2000) by Michael Petry, an installation featuring 144 suspended red human heart shaped glass objects, Gardner Centre for the Arts, Brighton Festival [36], and 7. Maximum Cube (2000) by Anna Heinrich & Leon Palmer, a large-scale installation co-commissioned by BN1 and Lighthouse for the De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill.[16]


Composer

Inspired by Buckminster Fuller’s concept of ‘post industrial ephemeralisation’, and using an extreme minimalistic compositional approach, Bernhard Living has taken his digitally-based compositions to what he believes to be their logical conclusion, with his music being characterised by sparse textures, glacial movement, long periods of silence, maximal repetition and minimal variation. With this ‘black square aesthetic’ he regards his compositions to be a form of abstract philosophic meditation in which he explores philosophy with non-linguistic sonic means. As such, he does not regard his music to be an expression of emotions but as an expression of ideas.

Even though some of the compositions contain a semblance of rhythm, most other musical elements, such as harmony and melody have been eliminated with the aim of creating a pure abstract form, and a form that is devoid, as much as possible, of emotional content. Consequently, that are no cadences or musically driven emotion, nor are there any dramatic moments or climaxes. The music is not moving forward to an end goal or resolution, there is no end point, and as such it has become evolution without purpose. The compositions exist, and then they do not exist, fading into existence, and fading out to non-existence.

Living’s work could be described as being depersonalized and non-physical, and lacking conventional titles, they avoid making any reference to real-word contexts or narratives. The compositions are given a number identification, e.g. Composition 00001, Composition 00002, etc., and there is little else give that might create pre-determined expectations for the listener. This largely abstract and machine-driven aesthetic is reinforced by the the structure of the compositions in which the individual sounds and sonic elements are situated within a standardized consistent non-changing grid. To reinforce the mechanized structure of the music there are a limited number of uniform durations of the sounds that are set within the grid, e.g. the sounds being 4,8,16,32,64, 128, 256 and 768 bars in length with a consistent uniform tempo of 120 beats-per-minute.

Living’s earlier digital compositions from 2001 to 2009, such as his project Genius Loci that was produced for the McLuhan’s Message conference at the Watershed Arts Centre [38] [39], have been remixed or absorbed into the Composition number series, Composition 00001 (2010) to ad infinitum).

The production output from Composition 00001 to 00210, have been constructed rather than been composed, and so there is minimal intervention within the compositional process itself. This allows for the uninhibited free-flow of ideas mediated through technology. This ‘techno-flow’ makes it possible for a prolific outpouring of ideas and compositions.

Influences for Living’s work range from the historical avant-garde, including John Cage, Edgard Varèse and Kazimir Malevich, American Minimalist artists, such as Carl Andre, Donald Judd, and Agnes Martin, to contemporary loop-based dance music, particularly techno. In many ways, his music could be considered as an evolved non-dance form of techno, but one that exists within a different cultural context and along a different time continuum.
