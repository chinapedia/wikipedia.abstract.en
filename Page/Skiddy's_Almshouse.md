SKIDDY'S ALMSHOUSE is the oldest inhabited building in the city of Cork.[1] It was built in 1718 and finished in 1719.

It was the second almshouse built using a bequest from Stephen Skiddy for the city's poor, either Catholic or Church of Ireland.[2] Built on a corner of the medieval Saint Mary's Churchyard, the building was once part of a campus including the Green Coat Hospital and School. The other buildings were demolished in the 1950s. The Almshouse was saved from demolition in the 1960s with restoration completed in 1975. A second restoration was completed in 2005. Skiddy's Almshouse is now one of the very few surviving eighteenth-century institutional buildings in Cork.[3][4][5] The restoration of this building in 2005 won the contractor the RIAI Europa Nostra Award for the work.[6]

The Almshouse is an L-shaped building with a stone arcade enclosed by a ten-foot wall and a large iron gate. As of 2011, it housed 15 people.[7][8]
