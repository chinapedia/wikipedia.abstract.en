While managing several dot.com businesses in the 1990s, he attended the University of Munich, from which he received an MBA.[1] Jagodzinski became an online pioneer at 21 years of age with the launch of the first e-commerce company.[2] He is the founder of the first German Internet book retailer Telebooks (Telebuch),[3] which he and his partner Michael Gleissner sold to Amazon.com along with its subsidiaries in 1998 for an undisclosed amount.[4] Jagodzinski took on a position with Amazon as a director of European business development before selling his shares of the company, estimated at $55 million.[5]

Jagodzinski’s other successful Internet venture was "WWW-Service GmbH", which became the leading web hosting provider in Germany and Spain. In October 1998, the company was sold to Verio (later NTT).[6]
