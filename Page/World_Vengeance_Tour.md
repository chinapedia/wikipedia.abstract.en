The _WORLD VENGEANCE TOUR_ was a 1982 concert tour by British heavy metal band Judas Priest where they toured throughout North America from 26 August 1982 until 21 February 1983 in support of the 1982 album _Screaming for Vengeance._


Overview

The 12 December 1982 show was filmed and released on multiple video formats; first released on VHS, Beta, VHD and LaserDisc as _Judas Priest Live_ in 1983; as Disc 5 as a DVD on the _Metalogy_ compilation box-set in 2004; and as a separate DVD package entitled _Live Vengeance '82_ in 2006.

Even though the last United States leg of the tour ended in Honolulu on 21 February 1983, the band would perform their last show of the tour at the 1983 US Festival in San Bernardino, California on 29 May 1983 alongside Quiet Riot, Mötley Crüe, Ozzy Osbourne, Triumph, the Scorpions, and Van Halen.[1] The band's performance is featured as a DVD on the 30th anniversary edition of _Screaming for Vengeance_.[2]
