AL SHELTON (June 27, 1920 – March 22, 2016) established the reputation of “Cowboy Artist to the Stars”,[1] creating custom-crafted leatherwork embossed with iconic cowpoke imagery in his workshop on Ventura Boulevard.[2] [3] Among his regular clientele was Steve McQueen, Ronald Reagan, Clark Gable, and many others. Several of his pieces of are featured at the Autry Museum of the American West.[4][5][6]

Al Shelton’s interest in leather carving began while working as a cowboy in his teens during the tail end of the depression. The parade saddles he would come across featured intricate designs [7] and Shelton attempted to decorate his own saddle in an attempt he said was “ever so humble, hopeless!” [8]

Shelton spent the next decade learning and refining his craft, working at different saddle shops across the Western United States.[9] In the late ‘40s, Shelton moved to Los Angeles and set up shop in the Los Angeles Farmers Market,[10] where hundreds of sight seers daily would watch him work. As his business evolved, he was commissioned to design several patterns and tools for Craftool[11] and began teaching classes as the Pacific Arts and Crafts.[12]

Following a five-year stint working with Nudie Cohn, Shelton set up his own shop just as the TV westerns were taking off.[13] At this workshop on Ventura Boulevard, Shelton spent the next 50 years creating leather belts, guitar cases, director chairs, and a wide variety of other bespoke leather goods for the Hollywood elite.[14][15] In 2004, Shelton's industry contributions were recognized with an Al Stohlman Award for Achievement in Leathercraft.[16]
