Bernhard_Pauss_NFB-37326.jpg, for whom the village was named]] PAUSPUR (also spelled PAUSSPUR) was a village in the current state of Assam in India, located within the modern Kokrajhar district.

It was built in the late 19th century by missionaries affiliated with the Santal Mission of the Northern Churches and was named in honour of Bernhard Pauss (whose last name is also spelled Paus), the chairman of the Norwegian Santal Mission. The village received the name Pauspur or Pausspur well before the end of the 19th century and still carried the name in the 1950s; the name consists of the name of the Norwegian Paus family and the widely used Sanskrit suffix pur, meaning "city" or "settlement."

The village had its own Bengali-language Protestant church which was completed in 1939.[1] However, in 1951, its church was closed and services were moved to a newly completed church in Dingdinga.[2] This led to a decline of the village.

Pauspur is located around 40 kilometres to the south of Bhutan and around 25 kilometres to the north of Bangladesh.
