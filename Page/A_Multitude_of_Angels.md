_A MULTITUDE OF ANGELS_ is a four-CD collection of solo piano recordings by Keith Jarrett. They were recorded in 1996 and released by ECM Records twenty years later.


Music and recording

The music comes from four concerts recorded in Italy: in Modena, Ferrara, Torino, and Genova, on October 23, 25, 28, and 30, 1996, respectively.[1] Jarrett recorded the concerts himself on a DAT machine.[2] Each consists of one performance without breaks; these were among the last times that Jarrett took this approach to performance.[3] After the concerts, he withdrew from playing in public, because of chronic fatigue syndrome.[4]


Reception

John Fordham of _The Guardian_ commented that, "Jarrett has always favoured exhaustive documentation, but the intensity, variety, and astonishing technical command of these performances might well persuade devoted fans and intrigued improv enthusiasts alike of his view that these were landmark moments".[5] John Garratt of _PopMatters_ wrote that, "The four-disc box set _A Multitude of Angels_ is the new turning point in Jarrett's career where he pushed himself too hard. His temporary illness is our gain. [...It] tells the music world what Keith Jarrett fans already knew â€“ that the man could be an endless fountain of music, a one-man jam-band that only needed 88 keys to balance the Law of Fate with the Law of Accident (according to his liner notes). Since that's the case, this box will not alter anyone's perception of Jarrett or change his reputation overall."[6]
