HINN () are supernatural creatures, besides jinn and demons, in Arabian lore and also a group of pre-Adamitic race in Islam-related beliefs.[1]


Pre-Adamitic circles

According to Alawi faith, the Hinn are part of the "circle of time", belonging to a period preceding the creation of mankind. Therefore before human, the _hinn_, _binn_, _timm_, _rimm_, _jann_ and _jinn_ roamed the earth. These six periods symbolize a negative progress until humans emerge, thus the first letters of the first four circles mean _Habtar_ (here referring to the personification of evil) and the latter referring to Jann and Jinn as subordinates of the devil. The following circle divides human history, starting with Adam and ends with Muhammad, the period in which humans now live.[2]

Alternatively, hinn have been said to be associated with air and another creature, binn, with water in a document called, "Revelations of ʻAbdullah Al-Sayid Muhammad Habib". In the same document, hinn and binn are said to be extinct, unlike jinn.[3]

According to Ibn Kathir the hinn belongs together with the jinn to those creatures who shed blood on earth before humankind, causing the angels to protest against God's command to place Adam as a vicegerent.[4] In his work _Al-Bidāya wa-n-Nihāya_ he relates, the hinn and binn were exterminated by the jinn, so that they could dwell on earth.[5]

Muhammad al-Tahir ibn Ashur states in his work _at-Tahreer wa’t-Tanweer_, the hinn and binn may be a reference to Persian mythology or the Ancient Greek Titans, who were driven away by their deities.[6]


Hinn fighting alongside angels

According to some accounts, the _Hinn_ supported the angels, led by Iblis during a battle against the earthen jinn, who bore disaster on the world. Tabari explained the Hinn were created out of fire, like the jinn. But the Hinn, who belong to Iblis´s group are created out of the fire of _samum_ (scorching fire), which is mentioned in the Quran (15:27) while the regular jinn are created out of ''marij min nar ''(smokeless flame), which is mentioned in (55:15).[7]


In folklore and poems

According to some folklore, the Hinn are believed to be still alive and took shape of dogs. Based on a hadith, if a wild dog approaches a Muslim, he shall throw some food to him and chase him away, because he would have an evil soul.[8]

Hinn were mentioned in pre-Islamic poems along with jinn.[9]
