MICHAEL JOSEPH PERRY[1] (born September 15, 1991) is an American professional mixed martial artist and former professional boxer currently competing in the welterweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.


Background

Perry was born in Flint, Michigan on September 15, 1991. For much of his life, he moved around to different schools between Michigan and Florida. This instability led him to a path of drugs, house arrest, probation violation, jail and, eventually, to MMA.[2] Perry started training at age 11.[3]


Mixed martial arts career

Early career

Perry made his professional debut in September 2014, after completing 11 amateur fights with a record of 8-3.[4] He competed for several regional promotions across the United States. In just under two years, he fought nine times while finishing all of his opponents via KO/TKO.[5]

Ultimate Fighting Championship

Perry made his UFC debut on short notice against Lim Hyun-gyu on August 20, 2016, at UFC 202, after Sultan Aliev pulled out due to injury.[6] At the official weigh-ins, Perry faked a handshake with Lim then put his hands up like an old school boxer yelling to Lim, "You thought you had a friend," before screaming passionately at his opponent.[7] He defeated Lim via TKO in the first round after Perry dropped him twice with right hands, dropped him again with a left hook and then followed up with ground and pound before the referee jumped in to stop the fight.[8]

Perry faced Danny Roberts on October 8, 2016, at UFC 204.[9] At the official weigh-ins Perry took a bite from a bar of chocolate and then told Roberts he was going to eat him alive.[10] He defeated Roberts via KO late in the third round after Perry hurt him with a knee from the clinch, dropped him with a right hand and then followed up with ground and pound before the referee jumped in to stop the fight.[11] The referee Marc Goddard appeared to stop the fight late, issuing an apology after the event via Twitter.[12]

Perry faced Alan Jouban, on December 17, 2016, at UFC on Fox 22.[13] At the official weigh-ins Perry took a polaroid photo of Jouban and then tried to hand the photo to him as they traded words, but Jouban slapped it away with his hand and Perry aggressively feigned movement towards him while sticking his tongue out.[14] He lost the fight by unanimous decision.[15]

Perry faced Jake Ellenberger on April 22, 2017, at UFC Fight Night 108.[16] He defeated Ellenberger via KO in the second round after Perry dropped him with a left hook early in round two then finished with a standing elbow from the clinch 30 seconds later.[17] Perry was awarded a $50,000 _Performance of the Night_ bonus.[18]

Perry was expected to face Thiago Alves on September 16, 2017, at UFC Fight Night 116. Alves was pulled from the event and was replaced by newcomer Alex Reyes.[19] He won the fight via knockout.[20] The win also earned Perry his second _Performance of the Night_ bonus award.[21]

Perry faced Santiago Ponzinibbio on December 16, 2017, at UFC on Fox: Lawler vs. dos Anjos.[22] He lost the fight by unanimous decision.[23]

Perry faced Max Griffin on February 24, 2018 at UFC on Fox: Emmett vs. Stephens[24] He lost the fight via unanimous decision.[25]

Perry was expected to face Yancy Medeiros on July 7, 2018 at UFC 226.[26] However, Medeiros pulled out of the fight on June 27 citing a rib injury. The following day, it was announced that Paul Felder would step in to face Perry in a Welterweight bout at the same event.[27] Perry won the fight via split decision.[28]

Perry faced Donald Cerrone on November 10, 2018 at UFC Fight Night 139.[29] Perry lost the fight via submission due to an armbar in round one, marking the first time he's been finished in a professional mixed martial arts fight.[30]

After the fight with Cerrone, Perry signed a new contract with the UFC and faced Alex Oliveira on April 27, 2019 at UFC Fight Night: Jacaré vs. Hermansson.[31][32] He won the back-and-forth fight by unanimous decision. The win also earned Perry his first _Fight of the Night_ bonus award.[33]

Perry is expected to face Vicente Luque on August 10, 2019 at UFC on ESPN+ 14.[34]


Controversy

During his UFC debut at UFC 202 Perry and his cornerman, former UFC middleweight Alex Nicholson, were accused of racism after Nicholson shouted during the pre-fight introductions, saying, "He can't even open his motherf--king eyes." referring to his Korean opponent Hyun Gyu Lim. Nicholson later addressed the comment on Twitter, saying, "I respect every man who steps in the cage and my comments were insensitive towards Lim (sic) I was hype for my brother but It's all love no hate." Nicholson also referred to Lim as "Dung Him Kong Jung Foo," in a Facebook post. On the Monday following the fight Perry offered an explanation while on _The MMA Hour_ stating "I don't think any of my competition can see me, and when I hit Lim, I opened a lot of people's eyes," Perry told Ariel Helwani. Helwani then clarified that the comment was made prior to the fight to which Perry responded "Well, we can see the future."[35][36][37][38] Perry has also been criticized for making homophobic and racist comments as well as wearing blackface.[39][40][41][42][43]
