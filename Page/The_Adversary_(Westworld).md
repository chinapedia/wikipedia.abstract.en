The Man in Black and Teddy are subsequently captured, with the Union soldiers planning to brand Teddy with a symbol of the Maze to mark him as a traitor. Teddy has a flashback confirming that he indeed was complicit in Wyatt's massacre and breaks free of his bonds. He then commandeers a Gatling gun and kills all of the Union soldiers at the camp.

Theresa informs Bernard that she wants to end their relationship. She fears that the revelation that she is sleeping with the head of the Behavior department could create a conflict of interest and hurt her credibility.

Elsie finds evidence that Theresa is responsible for trying to smuggle data out of Westworld. In addition, she discovers that another person has been remotely reprogramming first generation hosts. After warning Bernard about her discoveries, Elsie is grabbed by an unknown assailant.

Dr. Ford checks in on his host family and finds the dog dead. He interrogates Robert, the child host, who lies that the dog died naturally. Dr. Ford catches the lie and figures out that Robert killed the dog. On further interrogation, Robert admits that he was told to "put the dog out of its misery" by Arnold.

Critical reception

received praise for her performance as Maeve]] "The Adversary" received positive reviews from critics. The episode currently has an 87% score on Rotten Tomatoes and has an average rating of 8.6 out of 10, based on 23 reviews. The site's consensus reads "'The Adversary' shifts its focus to Maeve with one of Westworld's most haunting and moving sequences — and an episode that balances character development against the continual advancement of numerous storylines."[5]

Eric Goldman of IGN reviewed the episode positively, saying, "Thandie Newton has done fantastic work all season, but this episode was a true standout for her, as she expertly played Maeve going through so much and processing so much."[6] He gave it a score of 8.8 out of 10.[7] Scott Tobias of _The New York Times_ wrote in his review of the episode; "_Westworld_ has been tossed into the same TV-MA basket as HBO shows like _Game of Thrones_, _True Detective_ and _Rome_, which have brought the network some criticism for appealing heavily to libidinous men. The difference is that _Westworld_ has been, from the very first image of the show, studiously anti-erotic, despite a premise whose human subjects indulge a lust for consequence-free sex and violence. If you were bored by the orgy, that's not a mistake on the part of the filmmakers."[8] Zack Handlen of _The A.V. Club_ wrote in his review, "'The Adversary' goes a long way towards rebuilding the faith I lost in previous weeks. And it does this by focusing on character need as much as on mystery."[9] He gave the episode an A-.[10]

Liz Shannon Miller of IndieWire wrote in her review, "There are some great sequences in this episode, and if we weren't already pulling for Thandie Newton in the Best Supporting Actress category at next year's Emmys, we sure as hell are now."[11] She gave the episode a B+.[12] James Hibberd of _Entertainment Weekly_ wrote in his review, "This is a reason I'm loving _Westworld_. We think this show is about AI. And it is, to some degree. But what's surprising is how the plight of the hosts can give us a fresh perspective on what it means to be human."[13] He gave the episode an A-.[14] Rebecca Hawkes of _The Daily Telegraph_ wrote in her review, "At times during this week's episode, 'The Adversary', it felt as if we were inching nearer to a few of the answers we're so desperately craving. At others, we felt hopelessly lost — but in the best possible way."[15] David Crow of Den of Geek said in his review, "while the episode as a whole was quite powerful, it is stained just enough to cost it that fifth star. Nonetheless, 'The Adversary' was high-quality television as a whole, and there is undoubtedly plenty of fun (and answers) to be had in the first season's final four episodes to come."[16] He gave the episode a four out of five.[17] Erik Kain of _Forbes_ also reviewed the episode, saying, "this feels very much like the calm before the storm. That moment right before the wave comes crashing down, casting everything in its wake against the rocky shore. Then again, we're just six episodes deep. Judging by the restraint shown so far, we may have another episode or two of growing mystery, rising tension, and random acts of crazy disturbing violence before everything implodes."[18]
