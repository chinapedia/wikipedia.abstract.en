HALLOCK STATE PARK PRESERVE (formerly JAMESPORT STATE PARK)[1] is a state park and nature preserve located in the towns of Riverhead and Southold in Suffolk County, New York.[2][3] The park is situated on Long Island's north shore, with nearly of beachfront facing Long Island Sound.[4]


History

The property that was to become Hallock State Park Preserve was formerly used for illegal sand mining during the 1960s, and was once intended to host a nuclear power plant planned by the Long Island Lighting Company during the 1970s. KeySpan Energy took ownership of the land in 1998.[5]

It was purchased by New York State from KeySpan Energy in 2002 for $16 million; the purchase also included an additional adjacent to the future park land.[6][7] Although the park officially opened as Jamesport State Park in 2005,[8] legal access to the undeveloped park was restricted until official trails and a welcome center could be constructed.[9][10]

A master plan was adopted for the park in 2010, at which time the park's name was changed from Jamesport State Park to Hallock State Park Preserve.[11] The name change was intended to address the fact that the park was not located in nearby Jamesport; instead the park was named after a pond on the property.[12]

Impending development of the park's facilities was announced in 2014 after $3 million in funding was secured in the state's budget. The state funds joined an additional $3.9 million of development money that was received from selling the adjacent parcel as protected farmland.[13]
