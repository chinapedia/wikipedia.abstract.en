HUNTER STOCKTON THOMPSON (July 18, 1937 – February 20, 2005) was an American journalist and author, and the founder of the gonzo journalism movement. He first rose to prominence with the publication of _Hell's Angels_ (1967), a book for which he spent a year living and riding with the Hells Angels motorcycle gang in order to write a first-hand account of the lives and experiences of its members.

In 1970, he wrote an unconventional magazine feature entitled "The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved" for _Scanlan's Monthly_ which both raised his profile and established him as a writer with counterculture credibility. It also set him on a path to establishing his own sub-genre of New Journalism which he called "Gonzo," which was essentially an ongoing experiment in which the writer becomes a central figure and even a participant in the events of the narrative.

Thompson remains best known for _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_ (1971), a book first serialized in _Rolling Stone_ in which he grapples with the implications of what he considered the failure of the 1960s counterculture movement. It was adapted on film twice: loosely in _Where the Buffalo Roam_ starring Bill Murray as Thompson in 1980, and directly in 1998 by director Terry Gilliam in a film starring Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro. The _Doonesbury_ cartoon character Duke – who was modeled after Thompson – pens an essay about "my shoplifting conviction" entitled "Fear and Loathing at Macy's Menswear", a reference to Thompson's book.

Politically minded, Thompson ran unsuccessfully for sheriff of Pitkin County, Colorado in 1970 on the Freak Power ticket. He became well known for his dislike of Richard Nixon, whom he claimed represented "that dark, venal, and incurably violent side of the American character".[1] He covered Nixon's 1972 reelection campaign for Rolling Stone and later collected the stories in book form as _Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72_.

Thompson's output notably declined from the mid-1970s, as he struggled with the consequences of fame, and he complained that he could no longer merely report on events as he was too easily recognized. He was also known for his lifelong use of alcohol and illegal narcotics, his love of firearms, and his iconoclastic contempt for authoritarianism. He often remarked: "I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they've always worked for me."

Thompson died by suicide at the age of 67, following a series of health problems. In accordance with his wishes, his ashes were fired out of a cannon in a ceremony funded by his friend Johnny Depp and attended by friends including then-Senator John Kerry and Jack Nicholson. Hari Kunzru wrote that "the true voice of Thompson is revealed to be that of American moralist ... one who often makes himself ugly to expose the ugliness he sees around him."[2]


Early life

Thompson was born into a middle-class family in Louisville, Kentucky, the first of three sons of Virginia Ray Davison (1908, Springfield, Kentucky – March 20, 1998, Louisville), who worked as head librarian at the Louisville Free Public Library and Jack Robert Thompson (September 4, 1893, Horse Cave, Kentucky – July 3, 1952, Louisville), a public insurance adjuster and World War I veteran.[3] His parents were introduced to each other by a friend from Jack's fraternity at the University of Kentucky in September 1934, and married on November 2, 1935.[4] Thompson's first name came from a purported ancestor on his mother's side, the Scottish surgeon John Hunter.[5] Hunter Stockton was named for his maternal grandparents, Prestly Stockton Ray and Lucille Hunter.[6]

On December 2, 1943, when Thompson was six years old, the family settled at 2437 Ransdell Avenue in the affluent Cherokee Triangle neighborhood of The Highlands.[7] On July 3, 1952, when Thompson was 14 years old, his father, aged 58, died of myasthenia gravis. Hunter and his brothers were raised by their mother. Hunter also had a much older half-brother, James Thompson, Jr., from his father's first marriage, who was not part of the Thompson household. Virginia worked as a librarian to support her children, and is described as having become a "heavy drinker" following her husband's death.[8][9]

Education

Interested in sports and athletically inclined from a young age, Thompson co-founded the Hawks Athletic Club while attending I.N. Bloom Elementary School,[10] which led to an invitation to join Louisville's Castlewood Athletic Club,[11] a club for adolescents that prepared them for high-school sports. Ultimately he never joined any sports teams in high school.[12]

Thompson attended I.N. Bloom Elementary School,[13] Highland Middle School, and Atherton High School, before transferring to Louisville Male High School in September 1952. Also in 1952, he was accepted as a member of the Athenaeum Literary Association, a school-sponsored literary and social club that dated to 1862. Its members at the time, generally drawn from Louisville's wealthy upper-class families, included Porter Bibb, who later became the first publisher of _Rolling Stone_ at Thompson's behest. During this time, Thompson read and admired J. P. Donleavy's _The Ginger Man_.[14]

As an Athenaeum member, Thompson contributed articles to and helped produce the club's yearbook _The Spectator_. The group ejected Thompson in 1955, citing his legal problems.[15] Charged as an accessory to robbery after being in a car with the perpetrator, Thompson was sentenced to 60 days in Kentucky's Jefferson County Jail. He served 31 days and, a week after his release, enlisted in the United States Air Force.[16] While he was in jail, the school superintendent refused him permission to take his high-school final examinations, and as a result he did not graduate.[17]

Military service

Thompson completed basic training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, and transferred to Scott Air Force Base in Belleville, Illinois, to study electronics. He applied to become an aviator, but the Air Force's aviation-cadet program rejected his application. In 1956, he transferred to Eglin Air Force Base near Fort Walton Beach, Florida. While serving at Eglin, he took evening classes at Florida State University.[18] At Eglin, he landed his first professional writing job as sports editor of _The Command Courier_ by lying about his job experience. As sports editor, Thompson traveled around the United States with the Eglin Eagles football team, covering its games. In early 1957 he wrote a sports column for _The Playground News_, a local newspaper in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. He could not use his name on the column because the Air Force did not allow airmen to hold other jobs.[19]

Thompson was discharged from the Air Force in November 1957 as an Airman First Class, his commanding officer having recommended him for an early honorable discharge. "In summary, this airman, although talented, will not be guided by policy," chief of information services Colonel William S. Evans wrote to the Eglin personnel office. "Sometimes his rebel and superior attitude seems to rub off on other airmen staff members."[20]

Early journalism career

After leaving the Air Force, Thompson worked as sports editor for a newspaper in Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania[21] before relocating to New York City. There he audited several courses at the Columbia University School of General Studies. During this time he worked briefly for _Time_ as a copy boy for $51 a week. While working, he used a typewriter to copy F. Scott Fitzgerald's _The Great Gatsby_ and Ernest Hemingway's _A Farewell to Arms_ in order to learn about the writing styles of the authors. In 1959 _Time_ fired him for insubordination.[22] Later that year he worked as a reporter for _The Middletown Daily Record_ in Middletown, New York. He was fired from this job after damaging an office candy machine and arguing with the owner of a local restaurant who happened to be an advertiser with the paper.[23]

In 1960 Thompson moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico to take a job with the sporting magazine _El Sportivo_, which folded soon after his arrival. Thompson applied for a job with the Puerto Rican English-language daily _The San Juan Star_, but its managing editor, future novelist William J. Kennedy, turned him down. Nonetheless, the two became friends, and after the demise of _El Sportivo_ Thompson worked as a stringer for the _New York Herald Tribune_ and for a few stateside papers on Caribbean issues, with Kennedy working as his editor.[24][25] After returning to the United States, Thompson hitchhiked along U.S. Highway 40, eventually ending up in Big Sur working as a security guard and caretaker at Slates Hot Springs for an eight-month period in 1961, just before it became the Esalen Institute. While there, he published his first magazine feature (in the nationally distributed _Rogue_ magazine) on the artisan and bohemian culture of Big Sur. Thompson had had a rocky tenure as caretaker of the hot springs, and his unflattering portrayal of Big Sur was not well-received by the residents. His over-the-top antics finally became too much for Vinnie MacDonald Murphy, the owner of Slates Hot Springs. Even though Thompson promised to "retreat down to the rocks or up in the canyon whenever I feel the need to shoot", she evicted him on August 12, 1961.[26][27]

During this period Thompson wrote two novels, _Prince Jellyfish_ and _The Rum Diary_, and submitted many short stories to publishers – with little success. _The Rum Diary_, a novel based on Thompson's experiences in Puerto Rico, was eventually published in .

From May 1962 to May 1963 Thompson traveled to South America as a correspondent for a Dow Jones-owned weekly newspaper, the _National Observer_.[28] In Brazil he spent several months as a reporter for the _Brazil Herald_, the country's only English-language daily, published in Rio de Janeiro. His longtime girlfriend Sandra Dawn Conklin (a.k.a. Sandy Conklin Thompson, subsequently Sondi Wright) later joined him in Rio. They married on May 19, 1963, shortly after returning to the United States, and lived briefly in Aspen, Colorado, where they had a son, Juan Fitzgerald Thompson (born March 23, 1964). (The couple conceived five more times, but three pregnancies miscarried, and the other two produced infants who died shortly after birth. Hunter and Sandy divorced in 1980 but always remained close friends.)

In 1964 the family relocated to Glen Ellen, California, where Thompson continued to write for the _National Observer_ on an array of domestic subjects. One story told of his 1964 visit to Ketchum, Idaho to investigate the reasons for Ernest Hemingway's suicide.[29] While there he stole a pair of elk antlers hanging above the front door of Hemingway's cabin. Thompson severed his ties with the _Observer_ after his editor refused to print his review of Tom Wolfe's 1965 essay-collection _The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby_,[30] and moved to San Francisco. He immersed himself in the drug and hippie culture taking root in the area, and soon began writing for the Berkeley underground paper _Spider_.[31]

_Hell's Angels_

318_Parnassus_Ave_San_Francisco.jpg

In 1965 Carey McWilliams, editor of _The Nation_, hired Thompson to write a story about the Hells Angels motorcycle club in California. The article appeared on May 17, 1965, and after that Thompson received several book offers and spent the next year living and riding with the club. The relationship broke down when the bikers perceived that Thompson was exploiting them for personal gain and demanded a share of the profits from his writings. An argument at a party resulted in Thompson suffering a savage beating (or "stomping", as the Angels referred to it). Random House published the hard-cover _Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs_ in 1966, and the fight between Thompson and the Angels was well-marketed. CBC Television even broadcast an encounter between Thompson and Hells Angel Skip Workman before a live studio audience.[32]

A reviewer for _The New York Times_ praised the work as an "angry, knowledgeable, fascinating and excitedly written book", that shows the Hells Angels "not so much as dropouts from society but as total misfits, or unfits—emotionally, intellectually and educationally unfit to achieve the rewards, such as they are, that the contemporary social order offers". The reviewer also praised Thompson as a "spirited, witty, observant and original writer; his prose crackles like motorcycle exhaust".[33]


Late 1960s

Following the success of _Hell's Angels_, Thompson successfully sold articles to several national magazines including _The New York Times Magazine_, _Esquire_, _Pageant_, and _Harper's_.[34]

In 1967, shortly before the Summer of Love Thompson wrote "The 'Hashbury' is the Capital of the Hippies" for The New York Times Magazine. He criticized San Francisco's Hippies as devoid of both the political convictions of the New Left and the artistic core of the Beats, resulting in a culture overrun with young people who spent their time in the pursuit of drugs. "The thrust is no longer for 'change' or 'progress' or 'revolution' but merely to escape, to live on the far perimeter of a world that might have been — perhaps should have been — and strike a bargain for survival on purely personal terms," he wrote.[35]

By late 1967, Thompson and his family moved back to Colorado and rented a house in Woody Creek, a small mountain hamlet outside Aspen. In early 1969, Thompson received a $15,000 royalty check for the paperback sales of _Hell's Angels_ and used two-thirds of the money for a down payment on a modest home and property where he would live for the rest of his life.[36] He named the house Owl Farm and often described it as his "fortified compound."

In early 1968, Thompson signed the "Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.[37] According to Thompson's letters and his later writings, at this time he planned to write a book called _The Joint Chiefs_ about "the death of the American Dream." He used a $6,000 advance from Random House to travel the 1968 Presidential campaign trail and attend the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago for research. From his hotel room in Chicago, Thompson watched the clashes between police and protesters, which he wrote had a great effect on his political views. The book was never finished, and the theme of the death of the American dream would be carried over into his later work. The contract with Random House was eventually fulfilled with the 1972 book _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_.[38] He also signed a deal with Ballantine Books in 1968 to write a satirical book called _The Johnson File_ about Lyndon B. Johnson. A few weeks after the contract was signed, however, Johnson announced that he would not seek re-election, and the deal was canceled.[39]


Middle years

Aspen sheriff campaign

Thompson_for_Sheriff_poster.jpg

In 1970, Thompson ran for sheriff of Pitkin County, Colorado, as part of a group of citizens running for local offices on the "Freak Power" ticket. The platform included promoting the decriminalization of drugs (for personal use only, not trafficking, as he disapproved of profiteering), tearing up the streets and turning them into grassy pedestrian malls, banning any building so tall as to obscure the view of the mountains, disarming all police forces, and renaming Aspen "Fat City" to deter investors.[40] Thompson, having shaved his head, referred to the crew cut-wearing Republican candidate as "my long-haired opponent".[41]

With polls showing him with a slight lead in a three-way race, Thompson appeared at _Rolling Stone_ magazine headquarters in San Francisco with a six-pack of beer in hand, and declared to editor Jann Wenner that he was about to be elected Sheriff of Aspen, Colorado, and wished to write about the "Freak Power" movement.[42] Thus, Thompson's first article in _Rolling Stone_ was published as _The Battle of Aspen_ with the byline "By: Dr. Hunter S. Thompson (Candidate for Sheriff)". Despite the publicity, Thompson narrowly lost the election. While carrying the city of Aspen, he garnered only 44% of the county-wide vote in what had become a two-way race. The Republican candidate agreed to withdraw a few days before the election in order to consolidate the anti-Thompson votes, in return for the Democrats withdrawing their candidate for county commissioner. Thompson later remarked that the _Rolling Stone_ article mobilized his opposition far more than his supporters.[43]

Birth of Gonzo

Also in 1970, Thompson wrote an article entitled _The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved_ for the short-lived new journalism magazine _Scanlan's Monthly_. For that article, editor Warren Hinckle paired Thompson with illustrator Ralph Steadman, who drew expressionist illustrations with lipstick and eyeliner. Thompson and Steadman collaborated regularly after that. Although it was not widely read, the article was the first to use the techniques of Gonzo journalism, a style Thompson would later employ in almost every literary endeavor. The manic first-person subjectivity of the story was reportedly the result of sheer desperation; he was facing a looming deadline and started sending the magazine pages ripped out of his notebook.

The first use of the word "Gonzo" to describe Thompson's work is credited to the journalist Bill Cardoso. Cardoso first met Thompson on a bus full of journalists covering the 1968 New Hampshire primary. In 1970, Cardoso (who was then the editor of _The Boston Globe Sunday Magazine_) wrote to Thompson praising the _Kentucky Derby_ piece as a breakthrough: "This is it, this is pure Gonzo. If this is a start, keep rolling." According to Steadman, Thompson took to the word right away and said, "Okay, that's what I do. Gonzo."[44] Thompson's first published use of the word appears in _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_: "Free Enterprise. The American Dream. Horatio Alger gone mad on drugs in Las Vegas. Do it _now_: pure Gonzo journalism."

_Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_

The book for which Thompson gained most of his fame had its genesis during the research for "Strange Rumblings in Aztlan", an exposé for _Rolling Stone_ on the 1970 killing of the Mexican-American television journalist Rubén Salazar. Salazar had been shot in the head at close range with a tear gas canister fired by officers of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department during the National Chicano Moratorium March against the Vietnam War. One of Thompson's sources for the story was Oscar Zeta Acosta, a prominent Mexican-American activist and attorney. Finding it difficult to talk in the racially tense atmosphere of Los Angeles, Thompson and Acosta decided to travel to Las Vegas, and take advantage of an assignment by _Sports Illustrated_ to write a 250-word photograph caption on the Mint 400 motorcycle race held there.

What was to be a short caption quickly grew into something else entirely. Thompson first submitted to _Sports Illustrated_ a manuscript of 2,500 words, which was, as he later wrote, "aggressively rejected." _Rolling Stone_ publisher Jann Wenner was said to have liked "the first 20 or so jangled pages enough to take it seriously on its own terms and tentatively scheduled it for publication — which gave me the push I needed to keep working on it", Thompson later wrote.[45]

The result of the trip to Las Vegas became the 1972 book _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_, which first appeared in the November 1971 issues of _Rolling Stone_ as a two-part series. It is written as a first-person account by a journalist named Raoul Duke on a trip to Las Vegas with Dr. Gonzo, his "300-pound Samoan attorney", to cover a narcotics officers' convention and the "fabulous Mint 400". During the trip, Duke and his companion (always referred to as "my attorney") become sidetracked by a search for the American Dream, with "two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers ... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls."

Coming to terms with the failure of the 1960s countercultural movement is a major theme of the novel, and the book was greeted with considerable critical acclaim, including being heralded by _The New York Times_ as "by far the best book yet written on the decade of dope".[46] "The Vegas Book", as Thompson referred to it, was a mainstream success and introduced his Gonzo journalism techniques to a wide public.

_Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72_

Beginning in late 1971 Thompson wrote extensively for _Rolling Stone_ on the election campaigns of President Richard Nixon and his unsuccessful opponent, Senator George McGovern. The articles were soon combined and published as _Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72_. As the title suggests, Thompson spent nearly all of his time traveling the "campaign trail", focusing largely on the Democratic Party's primaries. Nixon, as the Republican incumbent, performed little campaign work, while McGovern competed with rival candidates Edmund Muskie and Hubert Humphrey. Thompson was an early supporter of McGovern and wrote unflattering coverage of the rival campaigns in the increasingly widely read _Rolling Stone_.

Thompson went on to become a fierce critic of Nixon, both during and after his presidency. After Nixon's death in 1994, Thompson described him in _Rolling Stone_ as a man who "could shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time", and said "his casket [should] have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president. [He] was an evil man—evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the Devil can understand it."[47] Following Nixon's pardon by Gerald Ford in 1974, Hunter ruminated on the approximately $400,000 pension Nixon maneuvered his way into, by resigning before being formally indicted. While _The Washington Post_ was lamenting Nixon's "lonely and depressed" state after being forced from the White House, Hunter wrote that '[i]f there were any such thing as true justice in this world, his [Nixon's] rancid carcass would be somewhere down around Easter Island right now, in the belly of a hammerhead shark.'[48] There was however one passion shared by Thompson and Nixon: a love of football, discussed in _Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72_.


Later years

Thompson's journalistic work began to seriously suffer after his trip to Africa to cover "The Rumble in the Jungle"—the world heavyweight boxing match between George Foreman and Muhammad Ali—in 1974. He missed the match while intoxicated at his hotel, and did not submit a story to the magazine. As Wenner put it to the film critic Roger Ebert in the 2008 documentary _Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson_, "After Africa he just couldn't write. He couldn't piece it together".[49]

Plans for Thompson to cover the 1976 presidential campaign for _Rolling Stone_ and later publish a book fell through after Wenner canceled the project without informing Thompson.[50] Wenner then assigned Thompson to travel to Vietnam to cover what appeared to be the end of the Vietnam War. Thompson arrived in Saigon just as South Vietnam was collapsing and as other journalists were leaving the country. Again, Wenner pulled the plug on the project. The incidents strained Thompson's relationship with Wenner and _Rolling Stone._

From the late 1970s on, most of Thompson's literary output appeared as a four-volume series of books entitled _The Gonzo Papers_. Beginning with _The Great Shark Hunt_ in 1979 and ending with _Better Than Sex_ in 1994, the series is largely a collection of rare newspaper and magazine pieces from the pre-gonzo period, along with almost all of his _Rolling Stone_ pieces.

Starting in about 1980, Thompson became more reclusive. He would often retreat to his compound in Woody Creek, rejecting projects and assignments or failing to complete them. Despite a lack of new material, Wenner kept Thompson on the _Rolling Stone_ masthead as chief of the "National Affairs Desk", a position he would hold until his death.

In 1980 Thompson divorced wife Sandra Conklin. The same year marked the release of _Where the Buffalo Roam_, a loose film adaptation based on Thompson's early 1970s work, starring Bill Murray as the writer. Murray eventually became one of Thompson's trusted friends. Later that year Thompson relocated to Hawaii to research and write, _The Curse of Lono_, a Gonzo-style account of the 1980 Honolulu Marathon. Extensively illustrated by Ralph Steadman, the piece first appeared in _Running_ magazine in 1981 as "The Charge of the Weird Brigade" and was excerpted in 1983 _Playboy_.[51]

In 1983, he covered the U.S. invasion of Grenada but didn't write or discuss the experiences until the publication of _Kingdom of Fear_ in 2003. Later that year, at the behest of Terry McDonell, he wrote "A Dog Took My Place", an exposé for _Rolling Stone_ of the scandalous Roxanne Pulitzer divorce case and what he called the "Palm Beach lifestyle". The story included dubious insinuations of bestiality but was widely considered to be a return by Thompson to his proper form. In 1985 Thompson accepted an advance to write about "couples pornography" for _Playboy_. As part of his research, he spent evenings at the Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre striptease club in San Francisco. The experience evolved into an as-yet-unpublished novel tentatively entitled _The Night Manager_.

Hst-by-rsexton-longbeach-5-1989-2.jpg

Thompson next accepted a role as weekly media columnist and critic for _The San Francisco Examiner._ The position was arranged by former editor and fellow _Examiner_ columnist Warren Hinckle.[52] His editor at The Examiner, David McCumber described "One week it would be acid-soaked gibberish with a charm of its own. The next week it would be incisive political analysis of the highest order."

Many of these columns were collected in _Gonzo Papers, Vol. 2: Generation of Swine: Tales of Shame and Degradation in the '80s_ (1988) and _Gonzo Papers, Vol. 3: Songs of the Doomed: More Notes on the Death of the American Dream_ (1990), a collection of autobiographical reminiscences, articles and previously unpublished material.

Throughout the early 1990s, Thompson claimed to be at work on a novel entitled _Polo Is My Life_. It was briefly excerpted in _Rolling Stone_ in 1994, and Thompson himself described it 1996 as "a sex book — you know, sex, drugs and rock and roll. It's about the manager of a sex theater who's forced to leave and flee to the mountains. He falls in love and gets in even more trouble than he was in the sex theater in San Francisco".[53] The novel was slated to be released by Random House in 1999, and was even assigned , but was never published.

Thompson continued to publish irregularly in _Rolling Stone_, ultimately contributing 17 pieces to the magazine between 1984 and 2004.[54] "Fear and Loathing in Elko," published in 1992, was a well-received fictional rallying cry against the nomination of Clarence Thomas to a seat on the Supreme Court of the United States. "Trapped in Mr. Bill's Neighborhood" was a largely factual account of an interview with Bill Clinton at a Little Rock, Arkansas steakhouse. Rather than traveling the campaign trail as he had done in previous presidential elections, Thompson monitored the proceedings on cable television; _Better Than Sex: Confessions of a Political Junkie_, his account of the 1992 presidential campaign, is composed of reactive faxes to _Rolling Stone_. In 1994, the magazine published "He Was a Crook," a "scathing" obituary of Richard Nixon.[55]

In November 2004, _Rolling Stone_ published Thompson's final magazine feature "The Fun-Hogs in the Passing Lane: Fear and Loathing, Campaign 2004", a brief account of the 2004 presidential election in which he compared the outcome of the _Bush v. Gore_ court case to the Reichstag fire and formally endorsed Senator John Kerry, a longtime friend, for president.

_Fear and Loathing_ redux

Thompson's work gained renewed attention with the release of the film _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_. New editions of the book were published, introducing Thompson's work to a new generation of readers. The same year, an early novel _The Rum Diary_ was published, as were the two volumes of collected letters.

Thompson's next, and penultimate, collection, _Kingdom of Fear: Loathsome Secrets of a Star-Crossed Child In the Final Days of the American Century_, was widely publicized as Thompson's first memoir. Published in 2003, it combined new material (including reminiscences of the O'Farrell Theater), selected newspaper and digital clippings, and other older works.

Thompson finished his journalism career in the same way it had begun: Writing about sports. From 2000 until his death in 2005, he wrote a weekly column for ESPN.com's Page 2 entitled "Hey, Rube." In 2004 Simon & Schuster collected some of the columns from the first few years and released it in mid-2004 as _Hey Rube: Blood Sport, the Bush Doctrine, and the Downward Spiral of Dumbness_.

Thompson married assistant Anita Bejmuk on April 23, 2003.


Death

At 5:42 p.m. on February 20, 2005, Thompson died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head at Owl Farm, his "fortified compound" in Woody Creek, Colorado. His son Juan, daughter-in-law Jennifer, and grandson were visiting for the weekend. His wife Anita, who was at the Aspen Club, was on the phone with him as he cocked the gun. According to the _Aspen Daily News_, Thompson asked her to come home to help him write his ESPN column, then set the receiver on the counter. Anita said she mistook the cocking of the gun for the sound of his typewriter keys and hung up as he fired. Will and Jennifer were in the next room when they heard the gunshot, but mistook the sound for a book falling and did not check on Thompson immediately. Juan Thompson found his father's body. According to the police report and Anita's cell phone records,[56] he called the sheriff's office half an hour later, then walked outside and fired three shotgun blasts into the air to "mark the passing of his father". The police report stated that in Thompson's typewriter was a piece of paper with the date "Feb. 22 '05" and a single word, "counselor".[57]

Thompson's inner circle told the press that he had been depressed and always found February a "gloomy" month, with football season over and the harsh Colorado winter weather. He was also upset over his advancing age and chronic medical problems, including a hip replacement; he would frequently mutter "This kid is getting old." _Rolling Stone_ published what Doug Brinkley described as a suicide note written by Thompson to his wife, titled "Football Season Is Over". It read:

Thompson's collaborator and friend Ralph Steadman wrote:

Funeral

On August 20, 2005, in a private funeral, Thompson's ashes were fired from a cannon. This was accompanied by red, white, blue and green fireworks—all to the tune of Norman Greenbaum's "Spirit in the Sky" and Bob Dylan's "Mr. Tambourine Man".[58] The cannon was placed atop a tower which had the shape of a double-thumbed fist clutching a peyote button, a symbol originally used in his 1970 campaign for Sheriff of Pitkin County, Colorado. The plans for the monument were initially drawn by Thompson and Steadman, and were shown as part of an _Omnibus_ program on the BBC titled _Fear and Loathing in Gonzovision_ (1978). It is included as a special feature on the second disc of the 2004 Criterion Collection DVD release of _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_, and labeled as _Fear and Loathing on the Road to Hollywood_.

According to his widow, Anita, the $3 million funeral was funded by actor Johnny Depp, who was a close friend of Thompson. Depp told the _Associated Press_, "All I'm doing is trying to make sure his last wish comes true. I just want to send my pal out the way he wants to go out."[59] An estimated 280 people attended, including U.S. Senators John Kerry[60] and George McGovern;[61] _60 Minutes_ correspondents Ed Bradley and Charlie Rose; actors Jack Nicholson, John Cusack, Bill Murray, Benicio del Toro, Sean Penn, and Josh Hartnett; musicians Lyle Lovett, John Oates and David Amram, and artist and long-time friend Ralph Steadman.


Legacy

Writing style

Thompson is often credited as the creator of Gonzo journalism, a style of writing that blurs distinctions between fiction and nonfiction. His work and style are considered to be a major part of the New Journalism literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s, which attempted to break free from the purely objective style of mainstream reportage of the time. Thompson almost always wrote in the first person, while extensively using his own experiences and emotions to color "the story" he was trying to follow.

Despite him having personally described his work as "Gonzo", it fell to later observers to articulate what the term actually meant. While Thompson's approach clearly involved injecting himself as a participant in the events of the narrative, it also involved adding invented, metaphoric elements, thus creating, for the uninitiated reader, a seemingly confusing amalgam of facts and fiction notable for the deliberately blurred lines between one and the other. Thompson, in a 1974 interview in _Playboy_ addressed the issue himself, saying "Unlike Tom Wolfe or Gay Talese, I almost never try to reconstruct a story. They're both much better reporters than I am, but then, I don't think of myself as a reporter." Tom Wolfe would later describe Thompson's style as "... part journalism and part personal memoir admixed with powers of wild invention and wilder rhetoric."[62] Or as one description of the differences between Thompson and Wolfe's styles would elaborate, "While Tom Wolfe mastered the technique of being a fly on the wall, Thompson mastered the art of being a fly in the ointment."[63]

The majority of Thompson's most popular and acclaimed work appeared within the pages of _Rolling Stone_ magazine. Along with Joe Eszterhas and David Felton, Thompson was instrumental in expanding the focus of the magazine past music criticism; indeed, Thompson was the only staff writer of the epoch never to contribute a music feature to the magazine. Nevertheless, his articles were always peppered with a wide array of pop music references ranging from Howlin' Wolf to Lou Reed. Armed with early fax machines wherever he went, he became notorious for haphazardly sending sometimes illegible material to the magazine's San Francisco offices as an issue was about to go to press.

Robert Love, Thompson's editor of 23 years at _Rolling Stone_, wrote that "the dividing line between fact and fancy rarely blurred, and we didn't always use italics or some other typographical device to indicate the lurch into the fabulous. But if there were living, identifiable humans in a scene, we took certain steps ... Hunter was a close friend of many prominent Democrats, veterans of the ten or more presidential campaigns he covered, so when in doubt, we'd call the press secretary. 'People will believe almost any twisted kind of story about politicians or Washington,' he once said, and he was right."

Discerning the line between the fact and the fiction of Thompson's work presented a practical problem for editors and fact-checkers of his work. Love called fact-checking Thompson's work "one of the sketchiest occupations ever created in the publishing world", and "for the first-timer ... a trip through a journalistic fun house, where you didn't know what was real and what wasn't. You knew you had better learn enough about the subject at hand to know when the riff began and reality ended. Hunter was a stickler for numbers, for details like gross weight and model numbers, for lyrics and caliber, and there was no faking it."[64]

Persona

Thompson often used a blend of fiction and fact when portraying himself in his writing as well, sometimes using the name Raoul Duke as an author surrogate whom he generally described as a callous, erratic, self-destructive journalist who constantly drank alcohol and took hallucinogenic drugs. Fantasizing about causing bodily harm to others was also a characteristic in his work used to comedic effect and an example of his brand of humor.

In the late sixties, Thompson acquired the title of "Doctor" from the Universal Life Church.[65]

A number of critics have commented that as he grew older the line that distinguished Thompson from his literary self became increasingly blurred.[66][67][68] Thompson admitted during a 1978 BBC interview that he sometimes felt pressured to live up to the fictional self that he had created, adding "I'm never sure which one people expect me to be. Very often, they conflict — most often, as a matter of fact. ... I'm leading a normal life and right alongside me there is this myth, and it is growing and mushrooming and getting more and more warped. When I get invited to, say, speak at universities, I'm not sure if they are inviting Duke or Thompson. I'm not sure who to be."[69]

Thompson's writing style and eccentric persona gave him a cult following in both literary and drug circles, and his cult status expanded into broader areas after being portrayed three times in major motion pictures. Hence, both his writing style and persona have been widely imitated, and his likeness has even become a popular costume choice for Halloween.[70]

Political beliefs

Thompson was a firearms and explosives enthusiast (in his writing and in life) and owned a vast collection of handguns, rifles, shotguns, and various automatic and semi-automatic weapons, along with numerous forms of gaseous crowd control and many homemade devices. He was a proponent of the right to bear arms and privacy rights.[71] A member of the National Rifle Association,[72] Thompson was also co-creator of "The Fourth Amendment Foundation", an organization to assist victims in defending themselves against unwarranted search and seizure.[73]

Part of his work with The Fourth Amendment Foundation centered around support of Lisl Auman, a Colorado woman who was sentenced for life in 1997 under felony murder charges for the death of police officer Bruce VanderJagt, despite contradictory statements and dubious evidence.[74] Thompson organized rallies, provided legal support, and co-wrote an article in the June 2004 issue of _Vanity Fair_ outlining the case. The Colorado Supreme Court eventually overturned Auman's sentence in March 2005, shortly after Thompson's death, and Auman is now free. Auman's supporters claim Thompson's support and publicity resulted in the successful appeal.[75]

Thompson was also an ardent supporter of drug legalization and became known for his detailed accounts of his own drug use. He was an early supporter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws and served on the group's advisory board for over 30 years, until his death.[76] He told an interviewer in 1997 that drugs should be legalized "[a]cross the board. It might be a little rough on some people for a while, but I think it's the only way to deal with drugs. Look at Prohibition: all it did was make a lot of criminals rich."[77]

In a 1965 letter to his friend Paul Semonin, Thompson explained an affection for the Industrial Workers of the World, "I have in recent months come to have a certain feeling for Joe Hill and the Wobbly crowd who, if nothing else, had the right idea. But not the right mechanics. I believe the IWW was probably the last human concept in American politics."[78] In another letter to Semonin, Thompson wrote that he agreed with Karl Marx, and compared him to Thomas Jefferson.[79] In a letter to William Kennedy, Thompson confided that he was "coming to view the free enterprise system as the single greatest evil in the history of human savagery."[80] In the documentary _Breakfast with Hunter_, Hunter S. Thompson is seen in several scenes wearing different Che Guevara T-shirts. Additionally, actor and friend Benicio del Toro has stated that Thompson kept a "big" picture of Che in his kitchen.[81] Thompson wrote on behalf of African-American rights and the civil rights movement.[82] He strongly criticized the dominance in American society of, what he called, "white power structures".[83]

After the September 11 attacks, Thompson voiced skepticism regarding the official story on who was responsible for the attacks. He speculated to several interviewers that it may have been conducted by the U.S. Government or with the government's assistance, though readily admitting he had no way to prove his theory.[84]

In 2004, Thompson wrote: "Nixon was a professional politician, and I despised everything he stood for—but if he were running for president this year against the evil Bush–Cheney gang, I would happily vote for him."[85]


Works

Books

Thompson wrote a number of books, publishing from 1966 to the end of his life. His best-known works include _Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs_, _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_, and _The Rum Diary_.

Articles

As a journalist over the course of decades, Thompson published numerous articles in various periodicals. He wrote for many publications, including _Rolling Stone_, _Esquire_, _The Boston Globe_, _Chicago Tribune_, _The New York Times_, _The San Francisco Examiner_, _Time_, _Vanity Fair_, _The San Juan Star_, and _Playboy_. He was also guest editor for a single edition of _The Aspen Daily News_. A collection of 100 of his columns from _The San Francisco Examiner_ was published in 1988 as _Gonzo Papers, Vol. 2: Generation of Swine: Tales of Shame and Degradation in the '80s_. A collection of his articles for _Rolling Stone_ was released in 2011 as _Fear and Loathing at Rolling Stone: The Essential Writings of Hunter S. Thompson_. The book was edited by the magazine's co-founder and publisher, Jann S. Wenner, who also provided an introduction to the collection.

Letters

Thompson wrote many letters, which were his primary means of personal communication. He made carbon copies of all his letters, usually typed, a habit begun in his teenage years.

_The Fear and Loathing Letters_ is a three-volume collection of selections from Thompson's correspondence, edited by the historian Douglas Brinkley. The first volume, _The Proud Highway_ was published in 1997, and contains letters from 1955 to 1967. _Fear and Loathing in America_ was published in 2000 and contains letters dating from 1968 to 1976. A third volume, titled _The Mutineer: Rants, Ravings, and Missives from the Mountaintop 1977–2005_ was edited by Douglas Brinkley and published by Simon & Schuster in 2005. As of March 2019, it has yet to be sold to the public. It contains a special introduction by Johnny Depp.

Illustrations

Accompanying the eccentric and colorful writing of Hunter Thompson, illustrations by British artist Ralph Steadman offer visual representations of the Gonzo style. Steadman and Thompson developed a close friendship, and often traveled together. Though his illustrations occur in most of Thompson's books, they are conspicuously featured in full-page color in Thompson's _The Curse of Lono_, set in Hawaii.

Photography

Thompson was an avid amateur photographer throughout his life and his photos have been exhibited since his death at art galleries in the United States and United Kingdom. In late 2006, AMMO Books published a limited-edition 224-page collection of Thompson photos called _Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson_, with an introduction by Johnny Depp. Thompson's snapshots were a combination of the subjects he was covering, stylized self-portraits, and artistic still life photos. The _London Observer_ called the photos "astonishingly good" and noted that "Thompson's pictures remind us, brilliantly in every sense, of very real people, real colours."[86]

Feature films

The film _Where the Buffalo Roam_ (1980) depicts heavily fictionalized attempts by Thompson to cover the Super Bowl and the 1972 U.S. presidential election. It stars Bill Murray as Thompson and Peter Boyle as Thompson's attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta, referred to in the movie as Carl Lazlo, Esq.

The 1998 film adaptation of _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_ was directed by Monty Python veteran Terry Gilliam and starred Johnny Depp (who moved into Thompson's basement to "study" Thompson's persona before assuming his role in the film) as Raoul Duke and Benicio del Toro as Dr. Gonzo. The film has achieved something of a cult following.

In the 2001 film _Ali_, Thompson is briefly portrayed by actor Lee Cummings.

The film adaptation of Thompson's novel _The Rum Diary_ was released in October 2011, also starring Johnny Depp as the main character, Paul Kemp. The novel's premise was inspired by Thompson's own experiences in Puerto Rico. The film was written and directed by Bruce Robinson.

At a press junket for _The Rum Diary_ shortly before the film's release, Depp said that he would like to adapt _The Curse of Lono_, "The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved", and _Hell's Angels_ for the big screen: "I'd just keep playing Hunter. There's a great comfort in it for me, because I get a great visit with my old friend who I miss dearly."[87]

Documentaries

_Fear and Loathing in Gonzovision_ (1978) is an extended television profile by the BBC. It can be found on disc 2 of The Criterion Collection edition of _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_.

The Mitchell brothers, owners of the O'Farrell Theatre in San Francisco, made a documentary about Thompson in 1988 called _Hunter S. Thompson: The Crazy Never Die_.

Wayne Ewing created three documentaries about Thompson. The film _Breakfast with Hunter_ (2003) was directed and edited by Ewing. It documents Thompson's work on the movie _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_, his arrest for drunk driving, and his subsequent fight with the court system. _When I Die_ (2005) is a video chronicle of making Thompson's final farewell wishes a reality, and documents the send-off itself. _Free Lisl: Fear and Loathing in Denver_ (2006) chronicles Thompson's efforts in helping to free Lisl Auman, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the shooting of a police officer, a crime she didn't commit. All three films are only available online.[88]

In _Come on Down: Searching for the American Dream_[89] (2004) Thompson gives director Adamm Liley insight into the nature of the American Dream over drinks at the Woody Creek Tavern.

_Buy the Ticket, Take the Ride: Hunter S. Thompson on Film_ (2006) was directed by Tom Thurman, written by Tom Marksbury, and produced by the Starz Entertainment Group. The original documentary features interviews with Thompson's inner circle of family and friends, but the thrust of the film focuses on the manner in which his life often overlapped with numerous Hollywood celebrities who became his close friends, such as Johnny Depp, Benicio del Toro, Bill Murray, Sean Penn, John Cusack, Thompson's wife Anita, son Juan, former Senators George McGovern and Gary Hart, writers Tom Wolfe and William F. Buckley, actors Gary Busey and Harry Dean Stanton, and the illustrator Ralph Steadman among others.

_Blasted!!! The Gonzo Patriots of Hunter S. Thompson_ (2006), produced, directed, photographed and edited by Blue Kraning, is a documentary about the scores of fans who volunteered their privately owned artillery to fire the ashes of the late author, Hunter S. Thompson. _Blasted!!!_ premiered at the 2006 Starz Denver International Film Festival, part of a tribute series to Hunter S. Thompson held at the Denver Press Club.

In 2008, Academy Award-winning documentarian Alex Gibney (_Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room_, _Taxi to the Dark Side_) wrote and directed a documentary on Thompson, titled _Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson_. The film premiered on January 20, 2008, at the Sundance Film Festival. Gibney uses intimate, never-before-seen home videos, interviews with friends, enemies and lovers, and clips from films adapted from Thompson's material to document his turbulent life.

Theater

Lou Stein's adaptation of _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_ was performed at the Battersea Theatre. Stein persuades London's _Time Out_ magazine to put Thompson up for a fortnight, in exchange for him writing a cover story to publicize the play. Thompson doesn't write the story, but does rampage around London on _Time Out_ 's expense account. The play was revived for the Vault Fringe Festival in 2014.

_GONZO: A Brutal Chrysalis_ is a one-man show about Thompson written by Paul Addis, who also played the author. Set in the writing den of Thompson's Woody Creek home, the show portrays his life between 1968 and 1971. James Cartee began playing the role soon after Addis's arrest in 2009, and again after Addis's death in 2012.

Awards, accolades and tributes

-   Thompson was named a Kentucky colonel by the Governor of Kentucky in a December 1996 tribute ceremony where he also received keys to the city of Louisville.[90]
-   Author Tom Wolfe has called Thompson the greatest American comic writer of the 20th century.[91]
-   Asked in an interview with Jody Denberg on KGSR Studio, in 2000, whether he would ever consider writing a book "like [his] buddy Hunter S. Thompson", the musician Warren Zevon responded: "Let's remember that Hunter S. Thompson is the finest writer of our generation; he didn't just toss off a book the other day..." [92]
-   Thompson appeared on the cover of the 1,000th issue of _Rolling Stone_, May 18 – June 1, 2006, as a devil playing the guitar next to the two "L"'s in the word "Rolling". Johnny Depp also appeared on the cover.[93]
-   The Thompson-inspired character Uncle Duke appears on a recurring basis in _Doonesbury_, the daily newspaper comic strip by Garry Trudeau. When the character was first introduced, Thompson protested, quoted in an interview as saying that he would set Trudeau on fire if the two ever met,[94] although it was reported that he liked the character in later years. Between March 7, 2005 (roughly two weeks after Thompson's suicide) and March 12, 2005, _Doonesbury_ ran a tribute to Hunter, with Uncle Duke lamenting the death of the man he called his "inspiration". The first of these strips featured a panel with artwork similar to that of Ralph Steadman, and later strips featured various non-sequiturs (with Duke variously transforming into a monster, melting, shrinking to the size of an empty drinking glass, or people around him turning into animals) which seemed to mirror some of the effects of hallucinogenic drugs described in _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_.
-   General Hunter Gathers in the Adult Swim animated series _The Venture Bros._ is a tribute to Thompson and derives his physical appearance from him.
