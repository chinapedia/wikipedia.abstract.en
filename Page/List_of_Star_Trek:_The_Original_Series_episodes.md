Created by Gene Roddenberry, the science fiction television series _Star Trek_ (which eventually acquired the retronym _Star Trek: The Original Series_) starred William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk, Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock, and DeForest Kelley as Dr. Leonard "Bones" McCoy aboard the fictional Federation starship USS _Enterprise_. The series originally aired from September 1966 through June 1969 on NBC.[1]

This is the first television series in the _Star Trek_ franchise, and comprises 79 regular episodes over the series' three seasons, along with the series' original pilot episode, "The Cage". The episodes are listed in order by original air date,[2] which match the episode order in each season's original,[3][4][5] remastered,[6][7][8] and Blu-ray DVD[9] box sets. The original, single-disc DVD releases placed the episodes by production order, with "The Cage" on the final disc.[10] This list also includes the stardate on which the events of each episode took place within the fictional _Star Trek_ universe.[11]

After the series' cancellation, Paramount Television released _Star Trek_ to television stations as a syndication package,[12] where the series' popularity grew to become a "major phenomenon within popular culture".[13] This popularity would eventually lead to the expansion of the _Star Trek_ catalog, which as of 2017 includes six more television series and thirteen _Trek_ motion pictures.

In 2006, CBS Paramount Domestic Television (now CBS Television Distribution) announced that each _Original Series_ episode would be re-syndicated in high definition after undergoing digital remastering, including both new and enhanced visual effects.[14] (To date, the remastered episodes have only been broadcast in standard definition, though all three seasons are now available on the high-definition Blu-ray Disc format.)[15][16] The remastered episodes began with "Balance of Terror" (along with, in some markets, "Miri") during the weekend of September 16, 2006,[17] and ended with "The Cage", which aired during the weekend of May 2, 2009.[18] The remastered air dates listed below are based on the weekend each episode aired in syndication.[19]


Series overview


Episodes

Pilots (1964–65)

_Star Trek_{{'}}s pilot episode, "The Cage", was completed between November 1964 and January 1965,[20] and starred Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Christopher Pike, Majel Barrett as Number One, and Leonard Nimoy as Spock. The pilot was rejected by NBC as being "too cerebral" among other complaints.[21] Jeffrey Hunter chose to withdraw from the role of Pike[22] when creator Gene Roddenberry was asked to produce a second pilot episode ("Where No Man Has Gone Before") of which a slightly (but not significantly) edited version of the same name aired in 1966 as the third episode of the new series.[23][24]

"The Cage" never aired during _Star Trek_{{'}}s original run on NBC. It was presented by Roddenberry as a black-and-white workprint at various science fiction conventions over the years after _Star Trek_{{'}}s cancellation but was not released on home video until 1986 when Paramount Home Video produced a "restored" release of "The Cage" (a combination of the original black-and-white footage and color portions of the Season 1 episode "The Menagerie") along with an introduction by Gene Roddenberry.[25]

On October 4, 1988, Paramount Pictures aired a two-hour television special, hosted by Patrick Stewart, called _The Star Trek Saga: From One Generation to the Next_, which featured, for the first time, a full-color television presentation of "The Cage". In some markets, the special did not air until October 15, 1988.[26] In the United States, "The Cage" was first released to DVD in December 2001.[27] It was later included on the final disc in both the original and "remastered" season 3 DVD box sets (listed with the original air date of October 15, 1988).[28][29][30]

"Where No Man Has Gone Before" in its original form (production number 02a) had been forwarded to NBC, but only a re-edited version was aired, not as a pilot but as the third episode of the series (production number 02b). The original version was thought to be lost, but later appeared on bootleg VHS tapes at conventions, until a print of it was discovered in 2009 and subsequently released on home video under the title _"Where No Fan Has Gone Before" - The Restored, Unaired Alternate Pilot Episode_ as part of the TOS season 3 box set on Blu-ray;[31] it has not been released on DVD. This version remains unaired.

s first season comprised 29 episodes, including the two-part episode "The Menagerie", which includes almost all of the footage from the original pilot, "The Cage". Other notable episodes include "Balance of Terror", which introduces the Romulans; "Space Seed", which introduces Khan Noonien Singh and serves as the basis for _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_; "Errand of Mercy", in which the Klingons make their first appearance; and the critically acclaimed,[32] Hugo-Award-winning episode[33] "The City on the Edge of Forever", which features Kirk, Spock, and McCoy traveling into the past through the Guardian of Forever.

Season 2 (1967–68)

The show's 26-episode second season began in September 1967[34] with "Amok Time", which introduced actor Walter Koenig as Russian navigator Pavel Chekov, and granted viewers the first glimpse of Spock's homeworld, Vulcan. The season also includes such notable episodes as "Mirror, Mirror", which introduces the evil "mirror universe"; "Journey to Babel", featuring the introduction of Spock's parents Sarek and Amanda; and the light-hearted "The Trouble with Tribbles", which would later be revisited in a 1973 episode of _Star Trek: The Animated Series_ and a 1996 episode of _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_. The season ended with "Assignment: Earth", an attempt to launch a spin-off television series set in the 1960s.

Season 3 (1968–69)

After _Star Trek_{{'}}s second season, NBC was prepared to cancel the show due to low ratings.[35][36] Led by fans Bjo and John Trimble, _Trek_ viewers inundated NBC with letters protesting the show's demise and pleading the network to renew the series for another year.[37][38] After NBC agreed to produce a third season, the network promised Gene Roddenberry that the show would air in a favorable timeslot (Mondays at 7:30 p.m.),[39][40] but later changed the schedule so that _Trek_ would air in the so-called "death slot"—Friday nights at 10:00 p.m.[41][42] In addition to the "mismanaged"[43] schedule, the show's budget was "seriously slashed"[44] and Nichelle Nichols described the series' eventual cancellation as "a self-fulfilling prophecy".[45]

_Star Trek_{{'}}s final, 24-episode season began in September 1968 with "Spock's Brain".[46] The third season also includes "The Tholian Web", where Kirk becomes trapped between universes; this episode would later be revisited by two 2005 episodes of the prequel series _Star Trek: Enterprise_. The last episode of the series, "Turnabout Intruder", aired on June 3, 1969,[47] but _Star Trek_ would eventually return to television in animated form when the animated _Star Trek_ debuted in September 1973.

British transmission

_Star Trek_ was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One starting on July 12, 1969 with the episode "Where No Man Has Gone Before". The first episode broadcast in color was "Arena" on November 15, 1969. The episodes were broadcast in a different order than in the United States and were originally aired in four seasons between 1969 and 1971. The BBC edited the episodes for broadcast by showing the title sequence first, then the teaser segment that aired before the titles in the United States, then the rest of the episode. These edited episodes aired until the 1990s, after which the BBC was supplied with NTSC videotape transfers of the first season instead of new film prints, resulting in a substandard picture, and with edits originally made for syndication in the United States. Viewer complaints led to the BBC obtaining film prints for the subsequent two seasons.

"The Cage" was first broadcast on Sky One in July 1990. Three episodes, "Plato's Stepchildren", "The Empath", and "Whom Gods Destroy", were not broadcast on the BBC until 1994, although "The Empath" was listed in the _Radio Times_ as scheduled to broadcast on December 16, 1970 at 7:20 pm.[50] Sky One was the first network to air these three episodes in the UK in 1990, although with the title sequence and teaser shown in the order as they were aired in the United States, whereas the rest of the episodes were broadcast as edited by the BBC.
