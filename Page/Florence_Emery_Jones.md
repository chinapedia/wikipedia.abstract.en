FLORENCE EMERY "EMBRY" JONES was an African American jazz performer, notable for her work in Paris during the 1920s.


Career

Florence Emery Jones was born in the US in 1892 and lived in Bridgeport, Connecticut for most of her youth. She subsequently migrated to Paris to start a musical career, as was a common career move for African American entertainers at the time. In the 1920s, African Americans in the United States were suffering from racial tension and segregation, while Paris was thought to be more tolerant and welcoming.[1]

Jones was a well-known performer at Eugene Bullard’s club, Le Grand Duc, and at Louis Mitchell's club. Later in her career, Mitchell renamed the club after Jones, _Chez Florence_. This allowed her to attract high-profile visitors to her shows and increased her fanbase.[2]

_Chez Florence_ was one of the most fashionable nightclubs in Paris. It was said that Jones had a reputation for being difficult behind the scenes, but always delivered a professional performance.[3] Jones was praised by several African American intellectuals, artists, and musicians, including poet Langston Hughes, who referred to her as a "Petite, lovely brown vision, the reigning queen of Montmartre after midnight".[4] He also praised Chez Florence, calling it a fashionable club.

A native of Connecticut, she had married pianist Palmer Jones. Mitchell described her performances as riveting, and she gained further attention when _Time_ magazine published a small excerpt about her beauty and talent, referring to her as having "Ivory-white [teeth], lipstick-red" and recognizing her as an expatriate of both hemispheres in 1927, a renowned achievement shortly before her death in 1932.
