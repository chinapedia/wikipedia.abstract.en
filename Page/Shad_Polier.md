SHAD POLIER (March 18, 1906 â€“ June 30, 1976) was an American lawyer and civic leader for anti-discrimation rights of labor and minorities.[1]


Early life and education

On March 18, 1906, Polier was born to a Jewish family[2] in Aiken, South Carolina. In 1926, he obtained a bachelor's degree with distinction from the University of South Carolina. In 1929, he obtained a law degree from Harvard Law School, and, in 1931, a masters of law degree. At Harvard, he studied under Felix Frankfurter. He passed the New York Bar exam in 1930.[3][4]


Career

Polier began to champion civil rights causes in response to lynchings in the South, starting in his hometown.[5][6] In 1931, Polier prepared legal briefs on behalf of the Scottsboro Boys. That case led him to join the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP): he served on the Executive Committee of the NAACP's Legal and Educational Defense Fund for thirty years.[7][8]

At inception in 1931, he served as executive director of the International Juridical Association, with Carol Weiss King secretary, and Joseph Kover editor of its monthly bulletin. (In 1932, he met his wife there.[9]) A congressional report found that "examination of the bulletin reveals consistent support of Communist legal cases during its entire career."[10] In 1934, Polier appeared before a congress committee to recommend legislative language that would clarify the right to strike.[11]

In 1934, he served on the National Labor Relations Board (NRLB) as a trial counselor. (Ware Group member Nathan Witt served as the NRLB's secretary.)[12][13]

In 1937, in the matter of _Brown v. United States_ regarding mail fraud, he and Emil Weitzner supported Samuel H. Kaufman in appeal for petition against William W. Barron, US Solicitor General Stanley Forman Reed, Assistant Attorney General Brien McMahon, and W. Marvin Smith for the United States.[14][15][16]

In 1943 (OSS - CIA) and 1968 (FBI), the Federal government investigated him.[17]

In 1945, he became chairman of the Commission on Law and Social Action (CLSA) at the American Jewish Congress (which he helped to found) and served such until 1955. CLSA conducted legal battles against antisemitism, segregation, racism, and other discriminatory laws. He won a six-year battle against antisemitic job practices by the Arabian-American Oil Company (ARAMCO, current "Saudi Aramco").[18]

In 1946, he prosecuted Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons for discrimination in admissions policies against Jews and other minority students.[19]

In 1947, the first statewide Fair Education Practices Law for which he fought, to end discrimination in admissions to colleges and universities on the basis of race or religion, passed into law.[20][21]

In 1948, he personally sued Metropolitan Life Insurance Company for discriminatory practices in its Stuyvesant Town Development in New York City, specifically not admitting African-Americans. The original case was dismissed, but the American Jewish Congress (of which Polier was the vice president) continued to fight for fair housing laws.[22][23]

Polier helped on _Brown vs. Board of Education_ case with briefs of amici curiae to support student rights to obtain equal education.[24]


Personal life and death

Polier "emphasized the strong parallels between the African-American and Jewish experiences and his belief that liberty and freedom can exist only when all citizens hold equal rights."[25]

He served the World Jewish Congress, including its Executive and Governing Council), chair of its budget and finance commission, and honorary chair of its national governing council. He also served on the boards of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany and of the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture.[26][27]

In 1937, he married Justine Wise Polier, daughter of Rabbi Stephen Wise and Louise Waterman Wise.[28][29] He died on June 30, 1976, at his home in New York City.[30][31]

Correspondents in his papers include El Mehdi Ben Aboud (Ambassador of Morocco), Roy Wilkins, Thurgood Marshall, Felix Frankfurter, Hubert Humphrey, John Haynes Holmes, Martin Luther King, Jr., Eleanor Roosevelt, Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, and Adlai E. Stevenson.[32]
