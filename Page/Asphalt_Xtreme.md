_ASPHALT XTREME_ is a racing video game, published and developed by Gameloft. It was the second spinoff, and the first off-road racing iteration, in the _Asphalt_ series. It was released on 27 October 2016.


Development

The game is rumored to have the same physics engine as _Asphalt 8: Airborne_ and _Asphalt Nitro_. Asphalt Xtreme is an off-road racing game in the Asphalt series. In the _Asphalt 8_ update, in Rio, appears a billboard with a poster of _Asphalt Xtreme_.[1][2]

Development lasted from August of 2015 to September of 2017. development has been terminated after 60 people layoffs and following Madrid studio shutdown.


Gameplay

The video game features a lineup of rally cars, monster trucks and a vast amount of snowy tracks and dirt. The visual interface, angular camera view and vehicular design of the game have a strong visual resemblance to the MotorStorm video game series.

While the controls are the same as the previous Asphalt games, the nitro mechanics are different. Normally, there are three nitro "Segments", and using Extra nitro booster, the number of segments are increased to four. Perfect nitro was renamed to long nitro. Triple nitro activates all three or four bars at the same time for added speed. When the race starts, the vehicles are given 2 nitro segments. Different types of vehicles acquire boost at different rates based on certain play styles, e.g. Buggies gain large amounts of nitro from performing airborne stunts, while SUVs perform drifts to maintain their boost.

The vehicle gameplay mechanics also have an effect on the game. Lighter vehicles like buggies and rally cars are in general aerodynamic and will pull off aerial stunts easily, while heavier vehicles like trucks and SUVs struggle to perform the same task and will also gain less boost as a result.

Infected mode has been carried over from _Asphalt 8_, albeit with several changes. Compared to Asphalt 8, there are more ways to get infected in Asphalt Xtreme, but infected players start out with less infected time. Players are now able to extend their infected time by performing aerial stunts and drifting. Also, when the infected timer runs out, players do not wreck as with Asphalt 8, but rather lose their Infected state and gain a full tank of Nitro.
