The CONCORDAT OF 1855 was a Concordat or agreement between the Holy See and the Austro-Hungarian Empire as regards the Catholic Church in Austria.

The Austrian Bishops' Conference was established in 1849 and agreed to a Concordat which would grant them greater scope in a variety of areas. They were granted full control over their own affairs, including making appointments.[1] The Catholic church was also placed in charge of 98% of public primary schools, i.e. those nominally Catholic and controlled the curriculum.[2] The Catholic ecclesiastical courts were given jurisdiction over marriages where either or both the couple were Catholic.[3]


International repercussions

The Concordat had an impact across Germany stimulating anti-clericism amongst liberal opinion. During the Austro-Prussian War the Austrian soldiers were called "Concordat soldiers". The Austrian defeat in this war forced the Emperor Franz Josef to grant concessions to German liberals in Cisleithania[4] Originally there were plans to extend the Concordat to Hungary (the largest part of Transleithania), but these never materialised.[5]
