RALPH MCFILLEN (born 1942) is a former American National Collegiate Athletic Association conference commissioner. McFillen, before retiring in 2007, served as the commissioner for the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA), an NCAA Division II conference since 1997. Before serving as the MIAA commissioner, McFillen was the commissioner for Metro Conference and Gulf South Conference.[1]


Career

Early career

After graduating from Belleville High School in 1960, McFillen attended Kansas State University where he played on the football team.[2] McFillen graduated from Kansas State in 1964 with a bachelor's degree in history and physical education, and a master's degree in education in 1967.[3] In 1972, McFillen began his forty-year career in athletics as an assistant director of championships at the NCAA.[4]

Commissioner years

In 1984, 12 years after working at the MIAA,[5] McFillen became the commissioner for the Gulf South Conference, an NCAA Division II conference.[6] After three years, McFillen moved to the NCAA Division I level as the next commissioner for the now-defunct conference, the Metro Conference.[7] While at Metro Conference, McFillen faced many obstacles, such as trying to expand the "super conference".[8] McFillen was the final commissioner for the conference when it dissolved in 1995.[9]

Two years after the falling-out of the Metro Conference, McFillen was hired to replace Ken B. Jones as the second commissioner for the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association, an NCAA Division II school.[10] While his time as commissioner, McFillen first was able to secure a contract to air five football games on KSMO-TV in the Kansas City area in 1997.[11] All games were on Thursday nights. Other accomplishments during McFillen's term as commissioner were an addition of two schools â€“ Fort Hays State University in 2006[12] and University of Nebraska Omaha in 2008.[13]

In 2007, after 10 years in the MIAA and 40-plus years in collegiate athletics, McFillen retired.[14]
