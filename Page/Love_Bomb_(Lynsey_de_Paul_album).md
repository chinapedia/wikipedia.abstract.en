_LOVE BOMB_ is the fourth album released in 1975 by the British singer-songwriter Lynsey de Paul, and her second album released on Jet Records in the UK and Polydor in Germany, Australia and Japan.[1][2] In the US and Canada, it was released in January 1976 on Mercury Records.[3][4][5][6][7] The album was recorded at the Marquee Studios, London, England, produced by de Paul and arranged by Tony Hymas, with Terry Cox playing drums, John Dean percussion, Chris Rea guitar and Frank McDonald bass.[8] The striking sleeve cover photo of de Paul in U.S military style clothing was taken by Brian Aris.[9]

The album has been critically acclaimed[10] including by de Paul's peers, such as musician, journalist, author Bob Stanley[11] and was a notable album.[12][13] The album was featured as one of _Billboard_ 's recommended LPs in 27 December 1975 issue of _Billboard_ magazine,[14] and also received a positive reviews in 27 December 1975 issue of _Cashbox_, with the reviewer writing "The ingrained sultreyness of Lynsey De Paul’s voice is the major focal point on "Love Bomb " The textured soulfulness of her pop oriented vocals makes the most of ballad and lightly up-tempo numbers. An effective adjunct to the singing is some carefully orchestrated instrumentals that seem to change moods in tandem with the singing registers. Good AM possibilities with equally strong chances at middle of the road and disco oriented stations. Top cuts include "You Are The Happiest Day Of My Life," "Sugar Shuffle,” "Hug And Squeeze Me" and “Season To Season"[15] as well as _High Fidelity_[16] and _Stereo Review_.[17] UK weekly music paper _Record Mirror_ stated "In a field of music where mediocrity is rife, Lynsey shows in no uncertain terms how things should be done properly".[18] The album is held by the US Library of Congress Washington, DC 20540 United States.[19][20] It is also rated as one of the top albums released in 1975 by online site "Best ever albums", as well as one of the top 1000 albums released in the 1970s, a listing that also includes de Paul's previous albums _Taste Me... Don't Waste Me_ and debut album _Surprise_.[21] The album is also mentioned in the book _How to Open & Operate a Financially Successful Independent Record Label_ as being popular [22] as well as in the book _The Mercury Labels: The 1969-1991 era and classical recordings_.[23]

As well as containing the hit single, "No, Honestly" (which was also the theme for the TV comedy series of the same name),[24] the album included the soul/disco infused UK single "Love Bomb"[25] (at 4:54 minutes too long for radio play) and the ballad "Hug and Squeeze Me" (sometimes referred to as "Hug and Squeeze" on later compilation albums), which was also released as a single in November 1975 (backed by the non-album song "You Made Me Write This Song").[26] The song highlights of the album according to AllMusic are "Dreams" and "No Honestly".[27]

"Sugar Shuffle" was released as a single in the USA and Japan, with the UK single A-side "Love Bomb" being relegated to the B-side. "Sugar Shuffle" received positive reviews in the US in industry trade magazines such as _Record World_,[28] with _Cashbox_ writing "Lynsey is a very hot writer in Great Britain at this point in time, and so she's earned a shot at the United States "Sugar Shuffle" is well worth that shot. Cool little teasing vocal gets straight to the point, "Get some honey/forget the money/do the sugar shuffle." The lady works with words very well and has a memorable voice".[29][30] Although it was not released as a single in the UK, "Sugar Shuffle" was popular on a number of mainstream UK radio stations, including BBC Radio 1.[31]

De Paul performed live versions of some of the album's songs as a special weekly guest on _Cooper_, the Tommy Cooper series produced by Thames Television, that was broadcast on ITV in late 1975. Songs performed from the album included "No Honestly", "Hungry for Love" and "Shoobeedoo Wey Doobee How", with each song introduced by a witty exchange between de Paul and DJ David Hamilton.[32][33] The shows were released on DVD by Network Distributing in 2008.[34]

The track "Love Bomb" was covered in 1979 by the American singer Cheryl Lynn as a track on her U.S. charting album _In Love_, which was produced by De Paul's writing partner, Barry Blue and has been remixed by Glenn Rivera.[35][36] According to the magazine _Sepia_, "Love Bomb" was one of three outstanding tracks on Lynn's _In Love_ album[37] and _Record World_ also mentions it in their review of the album.[38] It was also covered by the UK Celtic/folk-rock band, The Dolmen.[39] "Sugar Shuffle" was updated and covered by Japanese artist Asami Kobayashi on her 1984 album, _Cryptography_[40] which reached #4 on the Japanese album charts.[41] The song "No Honestly" was covered by Brazilian singer, Jeannie[42] and also by the Danish singer Vivian.[43]

A remix of de Paul's version of "Love Bomb" is featured in the TOWN II // TELEGRAPH footage for the Peter Hutton film, _Three Landscapes_, which was released in 2013.[44] The German group "Lovebomb" is named after the title song[45], as is the U.S. band formed by Robert Holmes.[46] In March 2019, as part of International Women's Day, Jann Arden chose "You Are The Happiest Day of My Life" from _Love Bomb_ as one of the songs that means most to her.[47]
