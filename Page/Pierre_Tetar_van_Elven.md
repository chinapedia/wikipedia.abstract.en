Pierre was the son of the painter John Baptist Tetar Elven (1805–1839) and Sophia Francisca Noll (or Noel?). Sophie Henry was his sister, born in Brussels in 1830; Joseph Edouard, his brother, was born in 1832 in Amsterdam. The architect Martinus Gerardus Tetar Elven, a founding member of Arti et Amicitiae, and the painter Paul Tetar Elven were, respectively, his uncle and cousin. The family Tetar Elven occupied a building at Number 16 Spinhuissteeg.

Pierre began his training in Amsterdam, but moved to The Hague, where he studied at the Royal Academy of Arts. Pierre left around 1853 for Milan; in 1855 he lived in Rome. Between 1856 and 1863 he was in Turin, where, on 13 May 1856, he married Anna Maria Angela Felicita Fumao (or Annette Fumero) (1831-?). They had three daughters. In 1861, he was appointed court painter by Victor Emmanuel II of Italy.[1] and did some paintings that the Risorgimento supported. In 1866, he left for Tunisia and Turkey, possibly traveling with Tinco Lycklama à Nijeholt, whom he portrayed a few times in oriental attire. In 1869, he lived in Paris. Around 1873, he moved back to Amsterdam and into a building at Number 33 Plantage Muidergracht. There he lived with his wife and children. In an unknown year, he returned to Milan, where he died in 1908.

His works hang in Milan, Genoa, Turin, and Haarlem. The _Musée de la Castre_ in Cannes (France) holds a few works as well, such as the _Bal Travesti chez le baron Lycklama_
