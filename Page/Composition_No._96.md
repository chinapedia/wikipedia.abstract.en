_COMPOSITION NO. 96_ is an album by composer Anthony Braxton featuring his title piece, dedicated to Karlheinz Stockhausen, performed by a 37-piece orchestra and recorded in 1981 and originally released on the Leo label in 1989.[1][2][3][4]


Reception

The Allmusic review by Brian Olewnick stated: "For confirmed Braxaholics, _Composition 96_ is a must-have, if only for its historical significance in his career. Listeners familiar with his jazz work, however, may be put off by its relatively severe classical orientation, lack of improvisation, and absence of overt themes."[5]
