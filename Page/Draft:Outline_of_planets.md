The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to planets:

PLANETS – astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals.[1][2][3]


What _type_ of thing are planets?

Planets can be described as all of the following:

-   Astronomical objects
    -   Gravitationally rounded objects


Types of planets

Planet

-   Planet types by location
    -   Planet of the Solar System
        -   Inferior planet
        -   Superior planet
        -   Inner planet
        -   Outer planet
    -   Exoplanet
-   Planet types by make-up
    -   Terrestrial planet
    -   Giant planet
        -   Gas giant
        -   Ice giant

Other

-   Double planet – Two planetary mass objects orbiting each other
-   Mesoplanet – A planet smaller than Mercury but larger than Ceres
-   Minor planet – A celestial body smaller than a planet
-   Planetary-mass object –


Planetary characteristics

Planetary attributes

-   Orbit –
    -   Heliocentric orbit – orbit around the barycenter of the Solar System, which is usually located within or very near the surface of the Sun. All planets, comets, and asteroids in the Solar System are in such orbits, as are many artificial probes and pieces of debris. The moons of planets in the Solar System, by contrast, are not in heliocentric orbits as they orbit their respective planet.
-   Planetary habitability – The measure of a planet's ability to sustain life.

[1] This definition is drawn from two separate IAU declarations; a formal definition agreed by the IAU in 2006, and an informal working definition established by the IAU in 2001/2003 for objects outside of the Solar System. The official 2006 definition applies only to the Solar System, whereas the 2003 definition applies to planets around other stars. The extrasolar planet issue was deemed too complex to resolve at the 2006 IAU conference.
