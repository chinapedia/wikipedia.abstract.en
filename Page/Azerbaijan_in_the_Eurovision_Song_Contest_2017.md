Background

Prior to the 2017 Contest, Azerbaijan had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest nine times since its first entry in .[1] Azerbaijan had won the contest on one occasion in 2011 with the song "Running Scared" performed by Ell/Nikki. Since their debut in 2008, Azerbaijan has had a string of successful results, qualifying to the final and placing in the top ten each year until 2014, including a third-place result in 2009 with the song "Always" performed by AySel and Arash and a second-place result in 2013 with the song "Hold Me" performed by Farid Mammadov. However, in 2014, Azerbaijan achieved their lowest placing in the contest to this point, placing 22nd in the final with the song "Start a Fire" performed by Dilara Kazimova. In 2016, Azerbaijan placed seventeenth with the song "Miracle" performed by Samra.


Before Eurovision

Internal selection

On 23 September 2016, İTV announced its intentions to participate in 2017 but didn't give any further details about the selection process.[2] On 5 December 2016, it was revealed that Diana Hajiyeva was internally selected to represent the country.[3] Despite not having announced anything about the song, Hajiyeva said in an interview that she was planning to keep her experimental style at Eurovision.[4] Her song for the contest in Kiev, "Skeletons", was presented to the public on 11 March 2017.

Promotion

On 8 April, Dihaj performed during the _Eurovision in Concert_ event which was held at the Melkweg venue in Amsterdam, Netherlands and hosted by Cornald Maas and Selma Björnsdóttir.[5]


At Eurovision

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot.[6] On 31 January 2017, a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. Azerbaijan was placed into the first semi-final, to be held on 9 May 2017, and was scheduled to perform in the first half of the show.[7]

Once all the competing songs for the 2017 contest had been released, the running order for the semi-finals was decided by the shows' producers rather than through another draw, so that similar songs were not placed next to each other. Azerbaijan was set to perform in position 8, following the entry from Finland and before the entry from Portugal.[8]

Semi-final

Dihaj took part in technical rehearsals on 30 April and 4 May, followed by dress rehearsals on 8 and 9 May.[9] This included the jury show on 8 May where the professional juries of each country watched and voted on the competing entries.

At the end of the show, Azerbaijan was announced as having finished in the top 10 and subsequently qualifying for the grand final.It was later revealed that Azerbaijan placed eighth in the semi-final, receiving a total of 150 points: 63 points from the televoting and 87 points from the juries.

Final

Shortly after the first semi-final, a winners' press conference was held for the ten qualifying countries. As part of this press conference, the qualifying artists took part in a draw to determine which half of the grand final they would subsequently participate in. This draw was done in the reverse order the countries appeared in the semi-final running order. Azerbaijan was drawn to compete in the first half, in the position 12.
