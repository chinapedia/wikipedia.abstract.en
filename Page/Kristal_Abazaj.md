Club career

Luftëtari Gjirokastër

In July 2016, Abazaj went on trial with top flight side Luftëtari Gjirokastër,[2] a trail which he successfully passed,[3] and in August 2016 signed the contract. He made his competitive debut as well as his first Albanian Superliga appearance in the opening matchday of 2016–17 season against Partizani Tirana which finished in a 0–1 loss.[4] He finished his first season with Luftëtari by making 35 appearances, including 33 in league, 30 of them as starter, collecting 2507 minutes and scoring 3 goals as Lufëtari finished 4th in the championship. Abazaj was distinguished for his performances throughout the season and at the end of the campaign he was named one of the talents of the season.[5][6]

During the summer transfer window, Lufëtari declined several offers for Abazaj from in and outside the country.[7][8] He started the second season on strong form, netting his team's only goal in the 2–1 defeat to Teuta Durrës in the opening week of championship.[9] This was followed by another one which turned out to be the winner as Lufëtari defeated Laçi for the first three points of the season.[10]

On 17 December, Abazaj scored in the matchday 15 versus Partizani Tirana after collecting the ball on the right side near the halfway line, running 70 metres (229 ft), nutmegging Labinot Ibrahimi before beating Alban Hoxha with a right-footed shoot in an eventual 5–0 home win.[11] He was named Albanian Superliga Player of the Month for December after bagging three goals in four matches, helping the team in their bid to escape relegation.[12]

At the end of the 2017–18, Abazaj was named Albanian Superliga Talent of the Season,[13] becoming the second ever Luftëtari player to win it.

Skënderbeu Korçë

On 5 January 2018, Skënderbeu Korçë announced to have signed a pre-contract with Abazaj for €300,000.[14] The player continued to represent Luftëtari as loanee until the end of the season.[15]

Anderlecht

On 16 April 2018, it was announced that Abazaj has signed a three-year contract with Belgian side Anderlecht.[16] The transfer fee reportedly was €750,000 and the player will join the club on 1 July 2018.[17][18]
