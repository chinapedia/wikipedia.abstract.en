_THE ATLAS_ was a newspaper published in England from 1826 to 1869.


History

The newspaper was founded by Robert Stephen Rintoul in London in 1826.[1] Describing itself as "a general newspaper and journal of literature", the _Atlas_ initially distinguished itself from its rivals both by the size of paper it used (it boasted of being printed on "the largest sheet ever issued from the press") and by its price (one shilling, almost double that of comparable journals).[2] The price was gradually reduced (10 d in 1828, 8d in 1846, falling to 2d by 1858). In the late 1850s, publication was taken over by the United Kingdom Alliance, a Manchester-based pro-temperance organization.[3] The title was changed to _The Englishman_ between 1862 and 1865, before reverting to _The Atlas_. During 1869, the final year of its operation, its name changed to _The Atlas and Public Schools Chronicle_ and finally _The Public Schools Chronicle_ for the remainder of that year.[4]


Content

The newspaper supported the Whigs, (later Liberals). Noted contributors included William Hazlitt, Leigh Hunt, Louis Kossuth, and George Henry Lewes.[5]
