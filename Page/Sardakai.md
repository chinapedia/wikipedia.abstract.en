_SARDAKAI_, Op. 206, is a 1969 comic opera in two acts by Ernst Krenek which premiered in Hamburg in 1970.[1] The "lightweight, fluffy farce", as Krenek described it, dealt with a _Così fan tutte_ inspired scenario on the fictional South Seas island of Migo Migo. Krenek's libretto was intended to poke fun at both left and right wing "sacred cows".[2] The premiere was a catastrophe, attributed by some contemporary and subsequent commentators to the Hamburg Opera director's decision to commission Krenek, who was living in California, to write his own libretto which proved to be out of touch with both the prevailing mood in Germany, and the situation at the Hamburg Opera.[3]

When it was performed in Hamburg later in 1970, the director was so intent upon ideas of his own, which were foreign to the spirit and meaning of the work, that he introduced antithetical elements that created scandal and hostility."
