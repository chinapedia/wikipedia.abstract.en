_LIBERATION_ () is a 1974 painting by the Norwegian artist Odd Nerdrum.[1] It depicts a room with a mattress where a couple have sexual intercourse with the woman on top of the passive man.

Nerdrum's art from the period 1968–1983 is characterized by everyday realism and left-wing politics.[2] _Liberation_ was created in this context, where the radical left propounded a sexual revolution as a way to create a socialist utopia by politicizing every aspect of human life, especially sexuality. Nerdrum made several paintings on the topic of what was considered sexual liberation. The most famous of these are _Liberation_ from 1974 and _Spring_ (_Vår_) from 1977.[3]


Provenance

The painting was first presented at Høstutstillingen in 1974. It was exhibited at the Oslo gallery Kunstnerforbundet in 1976 as part of the exhibition Odd Nerdrum Malerier ("Odd Nerdrum Paintings").[4]
