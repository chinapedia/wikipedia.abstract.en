NOEAZY (노이지) is a Korean metalcore band from Daejeon, South Korea. Formed in 2006, the band aims to spread awareness of heavy metal and rock music in South Korea.


History

The band was founded as a student club by the members when they were undergraduate students at KAIST in 2006 and band activities continued even as they started their graduate studies.[1] The name Noeazy is a combination of the word "noisy" and "not easy", stylized with a 'z' instead of an 's'.[2]

Noeazy started off playing cover songs of popular bands before producing their own music, playing in campus festivals and a variety of indie music festivals in South Korea. In 2008, two of their songs were included in the _Daejeon Indie Pride Compilations_ album, an album designed to showcase local talent from the Daejeon area.[3] Noeazy released their first EP, _The Mirror_, later that year in December.

Their first album, _Discrepancy_, was released in 2010. Noeazy played in the Ssamzi Sound Festival where they received the Sumun Gosu award, which is awarded to talented up-and-coming bands. The band released a compilation album in collaboration with the Japanese band Gates of Hopeless in 2012 and followed it up with their second solo album in 2013, _Land of Abomination_. Music videos for the songs _Genesis_ and _Decay_ were created for the album's release. In 2015, Noeazy was invited to play in the 2015 Beyond the Ocean Tour in Seoul and Busan with other Korean rock and metal bands such as Messgram and End These Days.[4] Noeazy's second EP, _Bioshock_, was released in December 2015.

In 2016, the band won the Korean Emergenza finals and was invited to participate in the Taubertal-Festival (de) in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Germany as the Korean representatives. This marked their first show in Europe.[5] They later celebrated their 10th anniversary by holding a concert in Club Sharp in Seoul.[6]

Noeazy released their third album, Triangle, on June 26, 2018.[7]
