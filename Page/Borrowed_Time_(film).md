_BORROWED TIME_ is a 2015 American animated western drama short film directed by Pixar artists Andrew Coats and Lou Hamou-Lhadj.[1]


Plot

In the Old West, a sheriff and his young son are traveling on a wagon trail. The sheriff gives his son his own pocket watch and his hat for good luck. During their trek, their stagecoach is attacked by bandits. While the sheriff attempts to fend off their attackers, the son drives the wagon, but loses control when it collides with a rock, breaking a wagon wheel, and causing the sheriff to be flung over a nearby cliff's edge. The son recovers, and observes the damage. As he looks around, he finds his father hanging on to a lower rock ledge. Attempting to reach his father with his hand, he isn't able to reach him; subsequently, the sheriff hands his son his rifle for additional leverage, and the son begins to pull him up. Before the son can pull his father to the top of the cliff, he puts his finger inside the trigger guard and accidentally fires the rifle, killing his father by mistake, leaving the young son traumatized.

Many years later, the son has risen to the office of the sheriff, and visits the cliff where his father died. Reliving the events of that day, he contemplates suicide, unable to cope with the guilt. When he accidentally slips at the cliff's edge, he begins to have second thoughts. He quickly climbs back up, and as he looks around, he sees the pocket watch his father gave to him. He retrieves it, and breaks down crying. He cradles the watch in his hands, and breathes deeply in a short moment of solace. He holds the watch close to his heart, and it starts ticking.


Production

The short took roughly five years to develop, from 2010 to 2015, as a part of Pixar's Co-op Program, which allows their animators to use Pixar resources to produce independent films.[2][3][4] The directors worked on the film in their spare time, while remaining full-time at Pixar and contributing to projects such as _Inside Out_, _Brave_, _The Good Dinosaur_, and _WALL-E_, along with shorts such as _Toy Story That Time Forgot_, _Day & Night_, _Toy Story of Terror!_, and _Partly Cloudy_.
