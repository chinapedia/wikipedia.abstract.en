Plot

Sakhavu Kochaniyan (Tovino Thomas) is a strong leftist who during The Emergency period, conducted a successful protest and established the SFY (SFI) party in the famous Maharaja's College, Ernakulam. However, he soon is betrayed by a comrade and killed by the police, shouting the phrase 'Inquilab Zindabad!' to his last breath.

Now, set in mid 2000s, the college is now under the leadership of the KSQ (KSU) activist Roopesh (Roopesh Peethambaran), Shiyaz (Kalabhavan Shajon) and their fellow activists. Paul (Tovino Thomas) is a student from Thrissur who has come to the college to study. He is a typical student and becomes friends with Subhash (Neeraj Madhav), Joby (Vishnu Govindan) and Krishnan (Manu), and soon starts to fall in love Anu (Gayathri Suresh). Subhash has long hated the KSQ's leadership and their abuse of power in the college, and plans to re-introduce the SFY party in the college before the next election. Subhash is shown as a clever, left-wing ideologist, and tries to bring his friends, including Paul, into the party. Krishnan, who came from Irinjalakuda, is also seen as a strong figure, but not completely absorbed in the leftist ideology. There is eventually a skirmish between Subhash's gang and a bunch of people lead by KSU activist Kanjan (Jinu John), but it's stopped safely.

Meanwhile, Paul tells Anu that he loves her, and she tells him, as a joke, that she loves him back. Paul falls under the illusion that it's real love and not friendship. In a local Kalolsavam, Roopesh and his party select the students who are taking part, but they reject a girl who wants to take part in 4 activities. Seeing this, Subhash decides to sign the girl up for the kalotsavam without the others knowing.
