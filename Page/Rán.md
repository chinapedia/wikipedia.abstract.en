, 1901]] In Norse mythology, RÁN is a goddess and a personification of the sea. Rán and her husband Ægir, a jötunn who also personifies the sea, have nine daughters, who personify waves. The goddess is frequently associated with a net, which she uses to capture sea-goers. According to the prose introduction to a poem in the _Poetic Edda_ and in _Völsunga saga_, Rán once loaned her net to the god Loki.

Rán is attested in the _Poetic Edda_, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the _Prose Edda_, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; in both _Völsunga saga_ and _Friðþjófs saga hins frœkna_; and in the poetry of skalds, such as _Sonatorrek_, a 10th century poem by Icelandic skald Egill Skallagrímsson.


Etymology

The Old Norse common noun _rán_ means 'plundering' or 'theft, robbery'.[1] In turn, scholars view the theonym _Rán_ as meaning, for example, 'theft, robbery'.[2] On the etymology of the theonym, scholar Rudolf Simek says, "although the meaning of the name has not been fully clarified, Rán was probably understood as being 'robber' ... and has nothing to do with [Old Norse] _ráða_ 'rule'.[3]

Because Rán is a personification of the sea, skalds employ her name in a variety of kennings to refer to the sea. Examples include _Ránar-land_ ('Ran's land'), _-salr_ ('Rán's hall'), and _-vegr_ ('Rán's way'), and _rán-beðr_ ('the bed of Rán') and meaning 'the bed of the sea'.[4]


Attestations

_Sonatorrek_

Rán receives mention in poem _Sonatorrek_ composed by Icelandic skald Egill Skallagrímsson in the 10th century. In the poem, Egill laments the death of his son Böðvar, who drowned at sea during a storm. In doing so, he mentions Rán:

  |     Old Norse:                     |     Nora K. Chadwick translation:            |  |
  |     Mjök hefr Rán rykst um mik;    |     Greatly has Rán afflicted me.            |  |
  |     emk ofsnauðr at ástvinum.      |     I have been despoiled of a great friend. |  |
  |     Sleit marr bönd mínnar áttar,  |     Empty and unoccupied I see the place     |  |
  |     snaran þátt af sjalfum mér.[5] |     which the sea has torn my son.[6]        |  |
  +------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+--+

_Poetic Edda_

(1845–1921) after an original by Friedrich Wilhelm Engelhard (1813–1902)]] Rán receives three mentions in the _Prose Edda_; twice in poetry and once in prose. The first mention occurs in a stanza in _Helgakviða Hundingsbana I_, when the valkyrie Sigrún assists the ship of the hero Helgi as it encounters ferocious waters:

  +----------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+--+
  | Henry Adams Bellows translation              | Carolyne Larrington translation               |  |
  |                                              |                                               |  |
  |     But from above did Sigrun brave          |     And Sigrun above, brave in battle,        |  |
  |     Aid the men and all their faring;        |     protected them and their vessel;          |  |
  |     Mightily came from the claws of Ron      |     the king's sea-beasts twisted powerfully, |  |
  |     The leader's sea-beast off Gnipalund.[7] |     out of Ran's hand toward Gnipalund.[8]    |  |
  +----------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+--+

In the notes for her translation, Larrington says that Rán "seeks to catch and drown men in her net" and that "to give someone to the sea-goddess is to drown them."[9]

The second instance occurs in a stanza found in _Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar_. In this stanza, the hero Atli references Rán while flyting with Hrímgerðr, a female jötunn:

  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+--+
  | Henry Adams Bellows translation:                                                             | Carolyne Larrington translation:                  |  |
  |                                                                                              |                                                   |  |
  |     "Witch, in front of the ship thou wast,                                                  |     'Ogress, you stood before the prince's ships  |  |
  |     And lay before the fjord;                                                                |     and blocked the fjord mouth;                  |  |
  |     To Ron wouldst have given the ruler's men,                                               |     the king's men you were going to give to Ran, |  |
  |     If a spear had not stuck in thy flesh."<ref name-"BELLOWS-1936-281">Bellows (1936: 281). |     if a spear hadn't lodged in your flesh.'[10]  |  |
  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+--+

Finally, in the prose introduction to _Reginsmál_, Loki visits Rán (here rendered as _Ron_) to borrow her net:

    [Odin and Hœnir] sent Loki to get the gold; he went to Ron and got her net, and went then to Andvari's fall and cast the net in front of the pike, and the pike leaped into the net.[11]

Translator Henry Adams Bellows notes how this version of the narrative differs from how it appears in other sources, where Loki catches the pike with his own hands.[12]

_Prose Edda_

The _Prose Edda_ sections _Skáldskaparmál_ and _Háttatal_ contain several references to Rán. Section 25 of _Skáldskaparmál_ ("How shall sea be referred to?") manners in which poets may refer to the sea, including "husband of Ran" and "land of Ran and of Ægir's daughters", but also "father of Ægir's daughters".[13]

In the same section, the author cites a fragment of a work by the 11th century Icelandic skald Hofgarða-Refr Gestsson, where Rán is referred to as 'Gymir's ... völva':

  Standardized Old Norse

      _Ok sem kvað Refr_:

          _Fœrir bjǫrn, þar er bára_
          _brestr, undinna festa_
          _opt í Ægis kjǫpta_
          *_ursǫl Gymis vǫlva_.[14]

  Anthony Faulkes translation

      And as Ref said:

          Gymir's spray-cold spæ-wife often brings the twisted-rope-bear [ship] into Ægir's jaws [under the waves] where the wave breaks.[15]

The section's author comments that the stanza "[implies] that they are all the same, Ægir and Hler and Gymir.[16] The author follows with a quote from another stanza by the skald that references Rán:

      But sea-crest-Sleipnir [ship], spray-driven, tears his breast, covered with red paint, out of white Ran's mouth [the sea's grasp].[17]

Chapter 33 of _Skáldskaparmál_ discusses why skalds may refer to gold as "Ægir's fire". The section traces the kenning to a narrative surrounding Ægir, in which the jötunn employs "glowing gold" in the center of his hall to light it "like fire" (which the narrator compares to flaming swords in Valhalla). The section explains that "Ran is the name of Ægir's wife, and the names of their nine daughters are as was written above ... Then the Æsir discovered that Ran had a net in which she caught everyone that went to sea ... so this is the story of the origin of gold being called fire or light or brightness of Ægir, Ran or Ægir's daughters, and from such kennings the practice has now developed of calling gold fire of the sea and of all terms for it, since Ægir and Ran's names are also terms for the sea, and hence gold is now called fire of lakes or rivers and of all river-names."[18]

In the _Nafnaþulur_ section of _Skáldskaparmál_, Rán appears in a list of goddesses (Old Norse _ásynjur_).[19]

_Völsunga saga_ and _Friðþjófs saga hins frœkna_

Rán receives a single mention in _Völsunga saga_. Like in the prose introduction to the eddic poem _Reginsmál_ (discussed above), "they sent Loki to obtain the gold. He went to Ran and got her net."[20]

In the legendary saga _Friðþjófs saga hins frœkna_, Friðþjófr and his men find themselves in a violent storm, and the protagonist mourns that he will soon rest in Rán's bed:

+----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+--+
| Old Norse                  | Eiríkr Magnússon and William Morris translation (1875): |  |
|                            |                                                         |  |
|     _Sat ek á bólstri_     |     "On bolster I sat                                   |  |
|     _í Baldrshaga,_        |     In Baldur's Mead erst,                              |  |
|     _kvað, hvat ek kunna,_ |     And all songs that I could                          |  |
|     _fyr konungs dóttur._  |     To the king's daughter sang;                        |  |
|     _Nú skal ek Ránar_     |     Now on Ran's bed belike                             |  |
|     _raunbeð troða,_       |     Must I soon be a-lying,                             |  |
|     _en annar mun_         |     And another shall be                                |  |
|     _Ingibjargar_."[21]    |     By Ingibiorg's side."[22]                           |  |
+----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+--+

The protagonist then decides that as they are to "go to Rán" (_at til Ránar skal fara_) they would better do so in style with gold on each man. He divides the gold and talks of her again:

+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+--+
|     _Nú hefir fjórum_      |     "The red ring here I hew me        |  |
|     _of farit várum_       |     Once owned of Halfdan's father,    |  |
|     _lögr lagsmönnum_,     |     The wealthy lord of erewhile,      |  |
|     _þeim er lifa skyldu_, |     Or the sea waves undo us,          |  |
|     _en Rán gætir_         |     So on the guests shall gold be,    |  |
|     _röskum drengjum_,     |     If we have need of guesting;       |  |
|     _siðlaus kona_,        |     Meet so for mighty men-folk        |  |
|     _sess ok rekkju_.[23]  |     Amid Ran's hall to hold them."[24] |  |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+--+


Scholarly reception and interpretation

According to Rudolf Simek, "... Rán is the ruler of the realm of the dead at the bottom of the sea to which people who have drowned go." Simek says that "while Ægir personifies the sea as a friendly power, Rán embodies the sinister side of the sea, at least in the eyes of the late Viking Age Icelandic seafarers."[25]
