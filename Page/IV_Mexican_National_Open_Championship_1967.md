The IV MEXICAN NATIONAL OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP 1967 was a badminton competition held from 23 to 27 November 1967 in Mexico City.[1][2][3]

In this tournament competed players from Thailand, the United States, Canada and Mexico.[4]

In the quarter-finals of the men's singles category, Antonio Rangel won to the American player Rod Starkey (15-9, 15-4), but his most outstanding victory was during the semi-finals when he defeated Jamie Paulson (15-6, 6-15, and 15-11) who was then ranked as the best Canadian badminton player.[5]

In the men's doubles event, the Mexican brothers Antonio Rangel and Raúl Rangel were defeated (15-10, 15-3) during the semi-finals by the American couple integrated by Stan Hales and Rod Starkey. In a strange twist, the American team became champion as the other finalist team could not play the final due to Jamie Paulson being treated in emergency of appendicitis.[6][7]

In the semi-finals of the women's singles category, Carolina Allier won to Carlene Starkey 11-5, 11-4, while Diane Hales imposed her class to Ernestina Rivera in three sets: 11-12, 11-5, 11-8.[8]

The finalists for the mixed doubles event were Channarong Ratanaseangsuang and Carolina Allier who defeated Rod Starkey and Carlene Starkey 15-5, 15-9, while Stan Hales and Diane Hales eliminated Oscar Luján and Josefina Tinoco 15-12, 15-3.[9]
