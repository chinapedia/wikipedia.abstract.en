]] Réunion possesses a network of highways, which cover a total distance of 2,784km. Of that length, 2,187 km of the road system is paved. There are no roads going into the cirque of Mafate, thus transportation there has to take place by foot or helicopter.


Motorways

A system of motorways that run between the main cities has been developed.

-   N1 connects Saint-Denis to Saint-Pierre, also connecting Le Port, Saint-Paul, La Saline Les Hauts and Saint-Louis. It has a length of 76 km.
-   N2 connects Saint-Denis to Saint-Benoît, also connecting Saint-André. Its length is 34 km.
-   N3 connects Saint-Pierre to Saint-Benoît, but the motorway only goes from Saint-Pierre until Le Tampon, with a length of 7 km.


Sea

There are two major ports in Réunion: Le Port and Pointe des Galets. There are six marinas. Réunion possesses a merchant marine of one ship with a weight exceeding 1,000 gt, which is a chemical tanker.
