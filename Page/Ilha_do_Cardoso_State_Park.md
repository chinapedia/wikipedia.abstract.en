The western side of the island has mangroves, and the coastal plain is mostly covered by _restinga_. Almost 1,000 plant species have been identified.

The park lies in the Iguape-Cananéia-Paranaguá estuary lagoon complex that stretches from Peruíbe in São Paulo state to Paranaguá in Paraná. The complex is one of the largest breeding grounds for South Atlantic marine species. The park is home to endangered fauna such as the red-tailed amazon (_Amazona brasiliensis_) and the broad-snouted caiman (_Caiman latirostris_). The park has many species of bromeliad, which host invertebrate and vertebrate communities, which have been studied in detail.[1] There are many archaeological sites holding ruins of human occupation from the colonial period, and a landmark of the Treaty of Tordesillas.
