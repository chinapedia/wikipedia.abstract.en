Political career

Fareeduddin was a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Andhra Pradesh for ten years to 2009, representing the Zahirabad constituency as an Indian National Congress (INC) politician. In the 2009 elections, the constituency, which had elected INC members in all but one of the elections since 1957, became reserved for candidates from the Scheduled Castes and his party preferred to field J. Geeta Reddy as their candidate. Thus, Fareeduddin instead contested the Amberpet constituency, where he lost to G. Kishan Reddy of the Bharatiya Janata Party.[2][3]

It was alleged that Fareeduddin encouraged his supporters in Zahirabad to vote for any party except the INC in the 2014 elections.[4] He joined the TRS in August 2014.[5]

In 2016, as a TRS politician, Fareeduddin was elected as a Member of the Legislative Council of Telangana, a state that had been created in 2014 by the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh. The position had become vacant following the election of Thummala Nageswara Rao as an MLA.[6] The election under the terms of the MLA's quota was unopposed.[7]


Posts held

Fareeduddin first became a minister in May 2004, when he was appointed in the government of Y. S. R. Reddy.[8] He was Minister for Minority Welfare and Fisheries in 2004[9] and still in that office around February 2007.[10] He became Minister for Co-Operation in April 2007.[11]
