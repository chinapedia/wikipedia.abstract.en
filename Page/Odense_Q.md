ODENSE Q is a Danish women's football team from Odense, playing in Elitedivisionen, the top division of women's football in Denmark.

The team was originally created as the women's football section of Odense Boldklub. They were promoted into the top division for the first time in 1989. After losing the 1995 Danish Women's Cup final to Fortuna Hjørring, the team gained revenge in 1998 by beating Fortuna in the final and securing their first Cup win. Odense also won the Cup in 1999 and 2003, and the league title in 2000 and 2001.[1]

Due to a lack of support from Odense Boldklub, the team decided to break away and form an independent women's football club for the 2016–17 Elitedivisionen season. A new logo was created, inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's _The Ugly Duckling_.[2]
