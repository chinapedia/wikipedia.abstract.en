__NOTOC__ This page lists direct English translations of common Latin phrases, such as _veni, vidi, vici_ and _et cetera_. Some of the phrases are themselves translations of Greek phrases, as Greek rhetoric and literature were highly regarded in Ancient Rome when Latin rhetoric and literature were still maturing.

The Latin letter _i_ may be used either as a vowel or a consonant. When used as a consonant, it often is replaced by the letter _j_, which originally, was simply an orthographic "long i" that was used in initial positions and when it occurred between two other vowels. This convention from Medieval Latin is preserved most commonly in Latin legal terminologyâ€”hence phrases such as _de iure_ often are spelled _de jure_.
