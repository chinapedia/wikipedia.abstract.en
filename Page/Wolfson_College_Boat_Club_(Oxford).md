WOLFSON COLLEGE BOAT CLUB is rowing club for the members of both Wolfson College, Oxford and St Cross College, Oxford. The club has competed since 1969 and takes part in the collegiate competitions Torpids and Summer Eights.[1] Due to the membership being drawn from graduate colleges, the club races actively during the vacation periods at external races.[2] Both squads also participate in the annual head races in London on the tideway (HoRR, WEHoRR, and HOR4s).[3]


The Club

The boat club shares the University College Boathouse with Somerville, St Peter's, and Univ. Prior to the rebuilding due to arson[4] in September 1999, the boat club had stored its equipment in the old OUBC boat house.

The starting positions for both Torpids and Summer Eights are determined by the results from the previous year, but Wolfson has shown good results for both men's and women's squads since entering bumps races. Currently three boats for each squad are pre-qualified in both events due to previous success.[5]
