The CAPER CAT (or Caper Cat 14) is a 14 ft sailing catamaran manufactured by Calypso Sailcraft in Brisbane, Australia.[1] While in many ways similar to other catamarans of its size (notably the Hobie Cat), a unique feature of the catamaran is its large storage capacity.[2] Each hull contains large storage bins that make it an ideal boat for camping and short island-to-island cruising trips.[3]

In addition to the more common 14 ft version, 18 ft Caper Cats with extended storage capacity were also built, although few of these boats exist.

Although these boats are no longer in production, there are a large number still being sailed.
