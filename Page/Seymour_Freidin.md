Freidin was born in New York City.[5] He attended Columbia College, Columbia University, obtaining his degree in 1936, and also studied at the University of Vienna.[6][7] He then joined the _New York Herald Tribune_, serving as their war correspondent in Europe during the Second World War. He subsequently worked as a foreign correspondent in Europe and rose to the _Herald Tribune_{{'}}s executive foreign editor. In 1972, he became the foreign correspondent in London for the Hearst Corporation, remaining with the company until his retirement in 1989, latterly as the executive assistant to the editor-in-chief. He later said that, whilst living in Europe, he had cooperated with the Central Intelligence Agency.[8] He was also a columnist for the _New York Post_ (1949–61), and wrote for _Collier's_, _Look_ and other American magazines.[9][10]

His books include _Fatal Decisions_ (1956), _The Forgotten People_ (1962), _The Experts_ (with George Bailey; 1968) and _The Sense of the Senate_ (1971).[11][12] _The Forgotten People_ won the Overseas Press Club of America's Cornelius Ryan Award for the best book on foreign affairs in 1962.[13]
