Ken Hohman of All About Jazz gave the album a positive review writing "A sizzling showdown between the dueling organs of B3 grand master Joey DeFrancesco and up-and-coming master Tony Monaco, Paesanos shows that the unique sound of the Hammond B-3 can still ignite the kind of sparks it did during its heyday in the '60s." [4] Alex Henderson commented in AllMusic "for the most part, New Generation grooves in a soulful, funky, earthy way." [5] Lee Prosser gave a favorable review stating in his Jazz Review piece, "A classic collection with classic performances, this one will be played years from now with the same sense of wonder and joy as when it was first released!"
