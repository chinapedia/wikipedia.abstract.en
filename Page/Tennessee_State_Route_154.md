Route description

SR 154 begins in Fentress County just west of Jamestown at a junction with SR 52. The highway enters Jamestown the original alignment of US 127/SR 28 for a short distance before turning right onto a route going further northeast to cross the current US 127. It continues northeast through rural countryside to pass through Sharp Place, where it has an intersection with SR 297, before crossing into the easternmost part of Pickett County, and traverses Pickett State Park and Pickett State Forest.
