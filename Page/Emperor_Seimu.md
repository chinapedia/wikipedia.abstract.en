, also known as was the 13th Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.[1][2] His reign is conventionally dated as AD 131–191.[3] He is credited with appointing the first provincial governors and district officials.[4]


Legendary narrative

Seimu is regarded by historians as a legendary Emperor who might have been real. Little is known about him.[5] The reign of Emperor Kinmei ( – 571), the 29th Emperor,[6] is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates;[7] however, the conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kanmu (737–806), the 50th sovereign of the Yamato dynasty.[8]

The name Seimu Tennō was assigned to him posthumously by later generations.[9]

If Seimu did exist, there is no evidence to suggest that the title _tennō_ was used during the time period to which his reign has been assigned. It is much more likely that he was a chieftain, or local clan leader, and the polity he ruled would have only encompassed a small portion of modern-day Japan.[10]

His father was Emperor Keikō and his mother was Yasakairihime-no-Mikoto, a granddaughter of Emperor Sujin and a first cousin of his father.

The actual site of Seimu's grave is not known.[11] The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (_misasagi_) at Nara.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Seimu's mausoleum. It is formally named _Saki no Tatanami no misasagi_.[12]

Seimu's tomb can be visited today at Misasagi-cho, Nara, Nara Prefecture.[13]
