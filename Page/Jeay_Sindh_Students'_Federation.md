Syed in his ideology of a separate homeland for Sindhis in 1972. Since then, it has been working as the students’ front of the Jeay Sindh or Sindhudesh movement.[1]

4 March 1967

Thousands of Sindhi student activists outraged against the Unitary Provincial setup, imposed by Martial law regime, challenged the dictatorship of Field Marshal Ayoub Khan and launched a struggle against the One Unit in 1967.[4] On the 4th of the March 1967, a massive procession taken out by the students marched from the University of Sindh, Jamshoro campus to Hyderabad. While the procession was on its way to the Hyderabad from Jamshoro, the police under the instructions of Martial law administration unleashed brutal force against the protesters leaving 17 of them injured and 200 arrested at the place of the incident. This incident proved to be the day of the emergence of the Sindhi nationalist politics and lead to the foundation of JSSF. Various factions of JSSF mark this day as the "day of the student struggle of Sindh" across Sindh till today.[5]
