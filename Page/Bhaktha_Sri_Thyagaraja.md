Production

_Bhaktha Sri Thyagaraja_, alternatively known as _Sri Thiagaraja Charitham_, was based on the life of the Carnatic musician Tyagaraja.[3] It was produced by the Bombay-based Sagar Movietone. Director Virendra Desai was not fluent in Tamil, so T. P. Kalyanarama Sastry, a lawyer from Chennai who was also involved in film production, worked as an associate director. An attorney from Chennai, M. P. Sundararajan wrote the screenplay. His son M. P. S. Pranatharthiharan, played a child's role in the film. On-location filming took place at the Tirupathi Venkateshwara Temple.[4] The final length of the film was .[5]

There were 32 songs in the film. The ragas used in the film include Thodi, Naata, Bowli, Kapi, Kalyani, Atana, Kaanada, Bilahari, Neelambari and Nalinakanthi. Almost all the songs were in Telugu. Mathirimangalam Natesa Iyer, an Carnatic musician, sang most of the songs. There were two songs in Tamil: one by a group sung by the thieves who were waiting to way-laid Tyagaraja. The other Tamil song "Sivano" is a translation of Tygaraja's popular kruthi "Evareni".[6]

According to film historian Randor Guy, the film was a box office success mainly because of the music. He stated the film would be remembered for "The classic compositions of Saint Thyagaraja rendered by Natesa Iyer and the on-screen narration by Virendra Desai."[7]
