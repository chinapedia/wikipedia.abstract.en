MARIA LUCIA HEIBERG ROSENBERG (born 9 February 1984) is a Danish singer and musical-performer. She became famous when she won a record contract with the label EMI in the TV 2-program _Popstars_ in 2003. Her debut single "Taking Back My Heart" (2004) was no. 1 on hitlisten. The album _That’s Just Me_ sold 22.0000 copies.[1][2]

Rosenberg created a career as a musical singer with leading parts in _Skønheden og udyret_ (English: Beauty and the Beast) on the Det Ny Teater, _Aladdin_ in Fredericia Teater (later on Copenhagen Opera House in _Copenhagen) and West Side Story_ on Gasværket. On 8 May 2011 she was awarded Reumertprisen as singer of the year for her role in Wicked on Det Ny Teater, the first musical performer to receive this prize.[3]

She participated in the TV show _Vild med Dans_ in 2013 and danced with Morten Kjeldgaard. In 2013 she also dubbed Elsa for the Disney film _Frozen_,[4] performing the Danish version of the song "Let it go" ("Lad det ske"), which won an Oscar on 2 March 2014. Rosenberg was chosen for the part also because she played the role of Elphaba in _Wicked_, which in the Broadway-version was originally played by Idina Menzel, who voices Elsa in original version. Between 2011 and 2014 Danmarks Radio held a series of concerts in different locations in Denmark where famous Disney songs were performed by DR UnderholdningsOrkestret, DR VokalEnsemblet and artists such as Stig Rossen, Annette Heick, Henrik Launbjerg, Monique, Jesper Asholt, Thomas Meilstrup and Pelle Emil Hebsgaard.[5]
