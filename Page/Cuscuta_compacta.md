_CUSCUTA COMPACTA_, the COMPACT DODDER,[1] is a parasitic plant that specializes on woody plants. This species is distributed across the Eastern and Midwestern USA, Eastern Canada, and Mexico.


Introduction

_CUSCUTA COMPACTA_ is also known as compact dodder or flower love vine.[2] The range of this parasitic plant extends from eastern Canada, the eastern and Midwestern USA to Canada.[3] It is very common in southern Alabama and other southeastern U.S. states.[4]


Description

The plant _Cuscuta compacta_ is known as stem parasite with a yellowish stem that wraps around a host plant. The flowers on this plant are very small. The flowers are small and occur from clusters of four to five. The flowers have a tube or cylinder form with a size of 5mm long and 2mm wide. The sepals of the flower have obtuse tips. The corolla tips on _C. compacta_ gradually acuminate to a sharp point. The length of the stamens are 0.3mm long and is exerted. The style of the pistil is 0.5Â mm long. Scales on _C. compacta_ are shorter than the corolla tube. Capsules are tubular in shape with a length of 3mm long and width of 2mm wide. The seeds of _C. compacta_ are 2mm in length and are brown when fresh.[5]


Taxonomy

The species _Cuscuta compacta_ Juss. ex Choisy has four accepted synonyms or subspecific varieties. Synonyms are alternative names for a species. Some names attributed to _Cuscuta compacta_ are _Cuscuta_ _compacta_ var. _adpressa_ (Engelm.) Engelm, _Cuscuta_ _fruticum_ Bertol, _Cuscuta_ _glomerata_ var. _adpressa_ (Engelm.) Choisy, and _Lepidanche_ _adpressa_ Engelm.[6] The kingdom for _Cuscuta compacta_ is Plantae. The subkingdom is Viridiplantae. The division is Tracheophyta or known as vascular plants. The class is Magnoliopsida. The order is Solanales. The family is Convolvulaceae which is also known as morning glories. Included in the family is Cuscutaceae. The genus is _Cuscuta_ L. or known as dodder. The Species is _Cuscuta compacta_ Juss. ex Choisy or also known as the compact dodder. The Cuscutaceae family is closely related to the Oncothecaceae family on a Angiosperm Phylogeny.[7][8] _C. compacta_ is in the Cleistogrammica section subsection Lepidanche. Two closest species related to _C. compacta_ are, _Cuscuta glomerata_ and _Cuscuta denticulata_[9]_._


Distribution and Habitat

The species _Cuscuta compacta_ can be particularly found in the lower 48 states including Canada.[10] The genus _Cuscuta compacta_ has been identified in Africa, Europe, South America, China, and Australia.[11][12] _Cuscuta compacta_ can be seen wrapped around their host plants during the months of July through November. Its habitat consists of bottomland forests near stream banks. Other locations are marshes, swamps, and any wet habitats. _Cuscuta compacta_ can parasitize both herbaceous and but especially specialize on woody hosts.[13] _Cuscuta_ is highly diverse being found all over the world yet majority of this genus is in the Americas.


Parasitism

_C. compacta_ is a heterotrophic parasitic plant meaning they attach themselves around other plants and remove their nutrients.[14] As compact dodders age over time, it does not grow any roots. Instead of growing roots, it produces a slender shoot that develops into tendrils. Although it takes time, the tendrils begin to bend and move in different directions until it has attached itself to a host.[15] In a controlled lab environment _Cuscuta compacta_ can attach itself to many host at one time. Yet in the wild, this species _C. compacta_ appears to be more selective for hosts.[16]


Germination

Germination occurs when the embryo begins to grow and bursts from the seed coat. Then the process begins only after the seed absorbs water. The embryo then starts to use the stored food to grow and develop the radicle facing the [null ground][l1]. In order for _Cuscuta compacta_ to germinate the ambient temperature needs to be 22 C to 23 C (71.6 F to 73.4 F).[17]


Economic Impact

In North Carolina blueberry growers have reported _Cuscuta compacta_ as an agronomic pest. Notably, _C. compacta_ specializes on woody hosts such as blueberry bushes (_Vaccinium_ spp.) The multiple basal shoots on blueberry bushes may facilitates parasitism by _C. compacta._ Ditches associated with wetlands may be responsible for _Cuscuta_ seed dispersal or possibly birds.[18]


Hosts

_Cuscuta compacta_ uses herbaceous hosts but specializes on woody or semi-woody plants. Reported hosts of _C._ _compacta_: _Acer, Alnus, Amelopsis, Apios, Aster, Baccharis, Bignonia, Boehmeria, Campsis, Carpinus, Cephalantbus, Cyrilla, Diespyrus, Elephatopus, Eupatorium, Gelsemium, Halesia, Hypericum, Ilex, Idea, Iva, Lespedeza, Leucotboe, Ludwigia, Myrica, Nyssa, Rubus, Sambucus, Sapium, Sassafras, Saururus, Smilax, Vaccinium, Viburnum_[19]_._
