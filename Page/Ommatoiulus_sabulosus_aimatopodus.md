_OMMATOIULUS SABULOSUS AIMATOPODUS_ is a millipede occurring in the South of France; belonging to the same species than _Ommatoiulus sabulosus_, it differs from the type by the lack of lighter transversal lines on the back when adult. It is believed to be a Mediterranean-climate adapted variant, but whether it is a true subspecies or rather an ecomorph is unclear; first described by Antoine Risso as a distinct species, it is for now considered as a form of _Ommatoiulus sabulosus_, under the name _Ommatoiulus sabulosus f. aimatopodus_.[1]

It has been shown that these millipede breed in autumn, and have shorter life cycle, compared to the northern _Ommatoiulus sabulosus_, that leads to the occurrence of only adults or old juveniles during the hot and dry summer season, believed to be an adaptation to that climate.[2]
