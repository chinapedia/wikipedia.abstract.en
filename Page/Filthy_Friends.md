FILTHY FRIENDS is a rock supergroup based in Portland, Oregon. The band is fronted by Corin Tucker (of Sleater-Kinney) and guitarist Peter Buck (formerly of R.E.M. and Tired Pony). The other members of the band include alumni from bands such as the Minus 5, King Crimson, The Baseball Project and Steve Wynn & the Miracle 3.

The band, with the tentative name of Super Earth, first convened in the studio in 2014. This line-up consisted of Tucker, Buck, former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic, Minus 5 and Young Fresh Fellows multi-instrumentalist and singer Scott McCaughey, Fastbacks and Young Fresh Fellows guitarist Kurt Bloch and Ministry drummer Bill Rieflin.[1] Novoselic would later depart the band, however, with McCaughey taking over on bass duties.

In 2016, now under the official moniker of Filthy Friends, the band performed a series of live shows in tribute to the late David Bowie.[2] Later that year, the group released its first song. "Despierta" – Spanish for "awake" – criticized then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump, and was written as part of the _30 Days, 30 Songs_ project.[3] "Any Kind of Crowd", the group's debut single, was released on March 1, 2017, which was later included on a 7" that also featured a cover of Roxy Music's "Editions of You" as its B-side. It was released via Kill Rock Stars the following April.[4] Their debut album, _Invitation_, was announced June 20, along with lead single "The Arrival".[5] The album was released that August. Although Rieflin played on the album, he had left the band by the time it was released. He was replaced by Linda Pitmon, who had worked with both Buck and McCaughey in their band The Baseball Project.

In February 2019, the band announced its second studio album, _Emerald Valley_, which is set for release on May 3. The announcement came with the release of a new single, "Last Chance County."[6]
