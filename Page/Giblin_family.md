The GIBLIN FAMILY OF TASMANIA was an influential family in the early days of the colony of Tasmania, or Van Diemen's Land as it was earlier named. The list below is not exhaustive, but should help in establishing relationships between family members encountered in histories and elsewhere in Wikipedia.


Origin

Robert Wilkins Giblin (17 May 1780 – 1 September 1845) was an English emigrant who arrived on Hobart Town, Van Diemen's Land aboard the _Sir Charles Forbes_ in 1827 with his wife and eight children. He had run a school in England which failed in the financial crash of a few years before, and would run a school near Hobart in the 1830s and early 1840s before being declared insolvent. Many of his descendants and their marriage partners occupied influential positions in the young colony.
