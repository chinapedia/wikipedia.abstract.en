ADAM WALINSKY (born 1937) is a lawyer who served in the United States Department of Justice and as a speechwriter for Robert F. Kennedy.[1] He had also been a nominee for the New York Attorney General by the Democratic Party.[2] He criticized Ira Stoll's efforts to claim John F. Kennedy as a political conservative saying that Kennedy had moved to the Left near the end of his life.[3] In 2016 he endorsed Donald Trump in large part due to concerns the Democratic Party had become too supportive of war.[4]
