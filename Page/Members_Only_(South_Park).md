"MEMBERS ONLY" is the eighth episode in the twentieth season of the American animated television series _South Park_. The 275th episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 16, 2016.

The episode, while mostly progressing the season's plot, lampooned Donald Trump's rejection of political correctness during his presidential campaign and parodied a worst-case scenario of a Trump-led presidency.


Plot

The newly elected Mr. Garrison relishes his newfound authority by getting a Donald Trump-esque toupée and forcing PC Principal and other townspeople to perform fellatio on him as revenge for doubting him. However, as Denmark prepares to unleash their Troll Trace program worldwide, he is called to the Pentagon to manage the global crisis. Having absolutely no idea what to do, he angrily rebuffs a warning from Boris Johnson in London. Johnson warns Garrison that the country is collapsing after everybody ate the "mem'burries". Meanwhile, the member berries flood the White House, where their leader, an aged Godfather-like berry, plans to bring back "the real Stormtroopers."

Butters suddenly joins Cartman and Heidi Turner at the SpaceX building, hoping to leave Earth with them. Under the threat of Troll Trace, Butters has reversed his previous attitude toward women to the point where Heidi becomes interested in him, much to Cartman's annoyance. The three are disappointed to find that their desire to leave the planet was only taken metaphorically, as they are instead given a guided tour of the facility led by Elon Musk. After Musk explains that a Mars rocket is still several years away, he becomes interested in speeding up the process when offered Heidi's assistance.

Detained in the Troll Trace building in Denmark, Gerald Broflovski is given a cell phone by the Troll Trace CEO and is told he can call anybody to help him, although it will end up revealing his identity as Skankhunt42. Gerald calls Ike and instructs him to continue trolling as Skankhunt42, effectively framing Ike when Sheila catches him. When Kyle comes home and finds Ike grounded, Kyle suddenly realizes his father has been the troll all along. He grabs Ike and leaves the house, leaving Shelia bewildered.
