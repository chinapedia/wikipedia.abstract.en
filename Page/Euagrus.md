_EUAGRUS_ is a genus of curtain web spiders that was first described by Anton Ausserer in 1875.[1] It has been referred to as "Evagrus", but this is a transcript error, not an accepted synonym.[2] It is very similar to the genus Allothele, and several species have been transferred there, including _Euagrus caffer_, _Euagrus regnardi_, and _Euagrus teretis_
