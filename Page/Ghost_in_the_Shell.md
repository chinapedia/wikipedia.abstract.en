is a Japanese media franchise originally published as a seinen manga series of the same name written and illustrated by Masamune Shirow. The manga, first serialized in 1989 under the subtitle of _The Ghost in the Shell_, and later published as its own tankōbon volumes by Kodansha, told the story of the fictional counter-cyberterrorist organization Public Security Section 9, led by protagonist Major Motoko Kusanagi, in the mid-21st century of Japan.

Animation studio Production I.G has produced several different anime adaptations of _Ghost in the Shell_, starting with the 1995 film of the same name, telling the story of Section 9's investigation of the Puppet Master. The television series _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_ followed in 2002, telling an alternate story from the manga and first film, featuring Section 9's investigations of government corruption in the Laughing Man and Individual Eleven incidents. A sequel to the 1995 film, _Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence_, was released in 2004. In 2006, the film _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society_ retook the story of the television series. 2013 saw the start of the _Ghost in the Shell: Arise_ original video animation (OVA) series, consisting of four parts through mid-2014. The series was recompiled in early 2015 as a television series titled _Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture_, airing with an additional two episodes (one part).[1] An animated feature film produced by most of the _Arise_ staff, titled _Ghost in the Shell: The New Movie_, was released on June 20, 2015. A live-action American film of the same name was released on March 31, 2017.


Overview

Title

Shirow stated that he had always wanted the title of his manga to be _Ghost in the Shell_, even in Japan, but his original publishers preferred _Mobile Armored Riot Police_. He chose "Ghost in the Shell" in homage to Arthur Koestler's _The Ghost in the Machine_, from which he also drew inspiration.[2]

Themes

One of the core underlying themes of the Ghost in the Shell franchise is the proposition that when human consciousness and individuality, essentially the "ghost", can exist independently of a physical body, visual identification of ethnicity is no longer relevant.[3]

Setting

Primarily set in the mid-twenty-first century in the fictional Japanese city of ,[4] otherwise known as , the manga and the many anime adaptations follow the members of Public Security Section 9, a task-force consisting of various professionals at solving and preventing crime, mostly with some sort of police background. Political intrigue and counter-terrorism operations are standard fare for Section 9, but the various actions of corrupt officials, companies, and cyber-criminals in each scenario are unique and require the diverse skills of Section 9's staff to prevent a series of incidents from escalating.

In this post-cyberpunk iteration of a possible future, computer technology has advanced to the point that many members of the public possess cyberbrains, technology that allows them to interface their biological brain with various networks. The level of cyberization varies from simple minimal interfaces to almost complete replacement of the brain with cybernetic parts, in cases of severe trauma. This can also be combined with various levels of prostheses, with a fully prosthetic body enabling a person to become a cyborg. The main character of _Ghost in the Shell_, Major Motoko Kusanagi, is such a cyborg, having had a terrible accident befall her as a child that ultimately required her to use a full-body prosthesis to house her cyberbrain. This high level of cyberization, however, opens the brain up to attacks from highly skilled hackers, with the most dangerous being those who will hack a person to bend to their whims.

Legacy

_Ghost in the Shell_ influenced a number of prominent filmmakers. The Wachowskis, creators of _The Matrix_ and its sequels, showed it to producer Joel Silver, saying, "We wanna do that for real."[40] _The Matrix_ series took several concepts from the film, including the Matrix digital rain, which was inspired by the opening credits of _Ghost in the Shell_, and the way characters access the Matrix through holes in the back of their necks.[41] Other parallels have been drawn to James Cameron's _Avatar_, Steven Spielberg's _A.I. Artificial Intelligence_, and Jonathan Mostow's _Surrogates_.[42] James Cameron cited _Ghost in the Shell_ as a source of inspiration,[43] citing it as an influence on _Avatar_.[44]

Bungie's famous 2001 third-person action game _Oni_ draws substantial inspiration from _Ghost in the Shell_{{'s}} setting and characters.[45][46] _Ghost in the Shell_ also influenced video games such as the _Metal Gear Solid_ series,[47] _Deus Ex_,[48] and _Cyberpunk 2077_.[49][50]
