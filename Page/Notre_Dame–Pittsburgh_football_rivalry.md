The NOTRE DAME–PITTSBURGH FOOTBALL RIVALRY is an American college football rivalry between the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and Pittsburgh Panthers.


History

This storied series began in 1909,[1] and there have been no more than two consecutive seasons without two teams meeting each other except from 1913 to 1929, 1938 to 1942, and 1979 to 1981. Since 1982, the Panthers and Irish have remained a relative fixture on each other's schedules. Notre Dame leads the series 48–21–1.[2] The longest game in Notre Dame history occurred between the two schools in 2008, when Pitt defeated ND in a record four overtimes by a field goal.[3] The 2012 contest saw Notre Dame erase a 20–6 deficit in the fourth quarter and force overtime. The Irish won 29–26 in triple overtime after the Panthers narrowly missed a game-winning field goal in the second overtime.[4] The most recent game was a 42–30 Irish win in 2015.[5] The teams met again on October 13, 2018, at Notre Dame.[6] The game often gets a large amount of national media attention and most often is televised on major television channels like NBC (which televises all Notre Dame home games),[7] ABC and ESPN.
