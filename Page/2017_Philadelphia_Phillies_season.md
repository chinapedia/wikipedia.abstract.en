The 2017 PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES SEASON was the 135th season in the history of the franchise, and its 14th season at Citizens Bank Park. The Phillies opened the season against the Cincinnati Reds at the Great American Ball Park on April 3[1] and finished the season on October 1 against the New York Mets in Philadelphia. They were coached by Pete Mackanin in his third year as manager of the Phillies. On September 17, 2017, the Phillies were mathematically eliminated from postseason contention.[2] They finished the season 66–96 to finish in last place in their division for the third time in four seasons, failing to make the playoffs for the sixth consecutive year.

Manager Pete Mackanin was reassigned to a front office position following the season.[3]


Offseason

The Phillies made several moves over the offseason to bolster the bullpen and add a veteran presence to the lineup. On November 4, the Phillies acquired relief pitcher Pat Neshek from the Houston Astros for a player to be named later. A few days later, Darin Ruf and Darnell Sweeney were traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for left fielder Howie Kendrick.[4] Andrés Blanco signed a one-year, three million dollar contract to return to the Phillies on December 14.[5] On January 19, the Phillies signed free agent outfielder Michael Saunders.[6]

Matt Stairs was hired as the team's hitting coach in the offseason.[7] He replaced Steve Henderson, who had served in the role since 2013.

April

For the second consecutive season, the Phillies faced the Cincinnati Reds on the road to start the season. The Phillies won the game 4–3,[8] behind a leadoff homerun by César Hernández; the first opening day leadoff homerun for the Phillies since 1938.[9]

The Phillies faced the Washington Nationals in their home opener on April 7. The Nationals would win the game 7–6.[10] The next night, the Phillies scored 12 runs in the first inning off of Jeremy Guthrie and Enny Romero en route to a 17–3 victory over Washington.[11] During the same homestand, Clay Buchholz left a game with a torn flexor tendon in his pitching arm. He was placed on the disabled list, and the Phillies called up Zach Eflin to take his place in the rotation.[12]

August

The Phillies turned a triple play on August 27 in the 5th inning against the reigning World Series champion Chicago Cubs.[13] The Phillies would go on to win the game 6–3.
