He was born in Knutsford, Cheshire in the summer of 1865.[3][4][5]

Spruce first worked at a local tile factory before moving to Burmantofts Pottery in Leeds, where he was principal modeller.[6] His work there includes some fine panels on the Midland Hotel, Manchester.[7] He went to Paris to study art and returned to Leeds to set up as a freelance artist with a studio in Chapeltown.[8][9] In this he was successful, performing numerous commissions including a bust of the Lord Mayor of Leeds, Sir James Kitson.[10] He was also a noted member of the Leeds branch of the Savage Club, becoming its "Indian Chief" (i.e. president) in 1912.[11] He died in 1922.[12][13][14]
