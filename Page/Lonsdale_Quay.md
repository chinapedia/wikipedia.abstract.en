Lonsdale_Quay_terminal_entrance.jpg LONSDALE QUAY is a SeaBus ferry terminal that serves Metro Vancouver's North Shore municipalities. The quay is located in the city of North Vancouver and is a major transit exchange for North Shore bus services. The BCIT Marine Campus and Lonsdale Quay Market are located within the vicinity of the quay.


History

Lonsdale Quay opened in 1977 when the SeaBus service commenced between the quay and Waterfront station in Downtown Vancouver.[1] Prior to the construction of the ferry terminal, the quay was the location of the North Van Ship Repair dock.

In 2016, it was announced that Lonsdale Quay, along with the Waterfront SeaBus terminal, would receive a $12.5 million upgrade. Construction was originally expected to begin in 2017 and to be completed by mid-2018;[2] however, the project timeline had been pushed back. Construction is expected to begin in March 2019.[3][4]


Services

Lonsdale Quay's SeaBus service crosses Burrard Inlet to Waterfront station in Downtown Vancouver. From there, transit users can connect to other TransLink services, including the SkyTrain rapid transit system and the West Coast Express commuter train.

Security for the bus loop and SeaBus terminal is the responsibility of the Transit Security Department. Transit security officers can be found patrolling the bus loop and the SeaBus terminal. Transit security officers also conduct fare inspections on board the buses and within the Fare Paid Zone of the SeaBus terminal. North Vancouver Royal Canadian Mounted Police also patrol the bus loop and SeaBus terminal.
