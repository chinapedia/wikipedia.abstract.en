History

During the Roman Empire, Narlıkuyu was called _Porto Calamie_. In the 4th century A.D., Poimenios, the Roman governor of nearby Corycus, commissioned a bath and baptism complex in Porto Calamie. The source of the bath water was an underground stream from the sinkhole Cennet, which is in the Taurus Mountains, northwest of Porto Calamie. The bath survives and, in 1976, a building was constructed to house the bath. The building is now under the supervision of the Ministry of Culture as a free-of-charge museum.[1]


The mosaic

An inscription at the entrance of the bath reads:

The emperors mentioned were probably Arcadius (378-408) and Honorius (384-423). The holy islands are the Princes' Islands of Marmara.

The bath floor is a mosaic. The mosaic depicts three Graces, Aglaea, Euphrosyne and Thalia, and a couple of partridges and doves. The local name of the mosaic is _Üç Güzeller_ () The mosaic refers to the mythological story of the baptism of Aphrodite.[2]
