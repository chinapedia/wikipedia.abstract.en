LOURENCY DO NASCIMENTO RODRIGUES (born 2 January 1996), simply known as LOURENCY, is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a forward for Brasil de Pelotas, on loan from Chapecoense.


Club career

Born in Imperatriz, Maranhão, Lourency started his career at JV Lideral's youth setup in 2008, aged 12.[1] After a short loan stint at Sabiá,[2] he joined Internacional in 2014.

Lourency moved to Chapecoense in 2015, after being rarely used at Inter. Initially assigned to the under-20s, he made his first team debut on 30 January 2016, coming on as a late substitute for Ananias in a 2–1 Campeonato Catarinense home win against Internacional de Lages.[3]

Lourency made his Série A debut on 15 May 2016, again replacing Ananias in a 0–0 away draw against former club Internacional.[4] On 16 September he scored his first professional goal, netting the winner in a 2–1 success at Fluminense.[5]

Lourency was not on board the ill-fated LaMia Airlines Flight 2933 that crashed on 28 November 2016, and killed 19 of his teammates, due to a request from Chapecoense's under-20 manager.[6]
