OVIEMUNO DOMINIC EJARIA (born 18 November 1997) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Liverpool.[1] He is a current England U21 international.


Club career

Liverpool

Born in London to Nigerian parents, Ejaria grew up supporting Arsenal for whom he played for nine years before signing for Liverpool in summer 2014. His first senior appearance was in a pre-season friendly prior to the 2016-17 season against Tranmere Rovers on 8 July 2016.[2] Despite being relatively unknown prior to the game he performed exceptionally well and caught the eye of first team manager Jürgen Klopp who selected him for four more friendlies over the summer.

His first competitive call-up came on 16 September in a Premier League match against Chelsea. He was an unused substitute in Liverpool's 2–1 victory.[3] Four days later, he made his first team debut against Derby County in the League Cup replacing Roberto Firmino in the 3–0 victory.[4]

On 25 October, Ejaria made his full debut in the fourth round of the EFL Cup in a 2–1 win over against Tottenham at Anfield.[5] On 6 November 2016, he debuted in the Premier League, coming on as a substitute in Liverpool's 6–1 home win over Watford.[6]

On 31 January 2018, Ejaria made a deadline day switch to Sunderland, signing on loan for the remainder of the season.[7] He made 11 appearances in total as the club were relegated to League One.[8] His only goal, and his first in senior football, came in the final match of the regular season when he opened the scoring in a 3–0 win over the eventual league champions, Wolves.[9]

In June 2018, Ejaria moved on loan to Scottish Premiership club Rangers, managed by former Liverpool captain and academy coach Steven Gerrard, after signing a new long-term contract with Liverpool.[10][11] He made his debut on 12 July, coming on as a second-half substitute in Rangers' 2–0 UEFA Europa League win over Macedonian side Shkupi.[12] He scored his first goal for the club in a Scottish Premiership match against Motherwell on 26 August.[13] In December 2018 his loan was curtailed earlier than planned and he returned to training with Liverpool.[14]

On 7 January 2019, Ejaria joined Championship strugglers Reading on loan until the end of the 2018–19 season.[15]


International career

Ejaria is eligible to represent England or Nigeria internationally. He trained with the Nigeria Under-17s team in 2013 and stated that his international allegiance lay with the country in 2014.[16] However, despite rumours of a senior Nigeria call up being in the offing, Ejaria accepted a call up to the England U20 team on 30 September 2016.[17] He made his debut for the Under-20 team on 7 October, in a 3–1 win against Germany, playing the whole match.[18]

Ejaria was selected for the England under-20 team in the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He made his first start in a game in the first round match against South Korea,[19] and came on as a substitute the quarter-final against Mexico,[20] but was an unused substitute in the final where England beat Venezuela 1–0.[21]

He was called up for the England under-21 team in March 2018, making his debut in a friendly against Romania.[22] He was called up again in May 2018 for the Toulon Tournament[23] but had to withdraw from the squad due to an injury.[24]
