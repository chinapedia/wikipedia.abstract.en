Reception

Angrymetalguy.com rates the album 4.0/5.0:

  "Madder Mortem‘s style is not easy to describe succinctly; switching effortlessly from crushing grooves to uncomfortable dissonance to quiet contemplation or soaring beauty, they are experts at manipulating your emotions with their skillful song-craft. The one-two punch of “Blood on the Sand” and “If I Could” that open the record showcase the Madders at their emotive peak, with off-kilter timing and uncomfortable harmonies building towards dramatic releases of tension. Though each runs for over five minutes, the shimmering guitars and arpeggiated bass-lines create a continuous sense of motion meaning that neither seems too long."[4]
