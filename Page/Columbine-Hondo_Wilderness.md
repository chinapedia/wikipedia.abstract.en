COLUMBINE-HONDO WILDERNESS is a Wilderness area located within the Carson National Forest in New Mexico. The area was added to the National Wilderness Preservation System on December 19, 2014 by Public Law 113-291.[1] Located in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, this area contains the headwaters to the Rio Hondo and Red River as well as three peaks which rise to or above timberline.[2]

Elevations in the wilderness range from to at Gold Hill. The other principal summits of the wilderness area are Lobo Peak () and Flag Mountain (). The Colombine-Hondo Wilderness is separated from the Wheeler Peak Wilderness to the south only by Highway 150 and the Taos Ski Valley. Latir Peak Wilderness is located north of Colombine- Hondo Wilderness. [3]

The wilderness has vegetation typical of the southern Rocky Mountains with Ponderosa Pine and Pinyon forests at lower elevations, mixed conifers and aspens at the middle elevations, spruce-fir forests at higher elevations, and alpine tundra above treeline.


History

Columbine-Hondo was designated a Wilderness Study Area by congress in 1980. In April 2012, Senator Jeff Bingaman unsuccessfully introduced a bill (S.2468) to designate the area as wilderness. The bill (S.776) was re-introduced by Senators Martin Heinrich and Tom Udall in April 2013 followed by an identical house bill (H.R.1683) introduced by Representative Ben Ray Luy√°n. The bill was signed into law on December 19th, 2014.[4]
