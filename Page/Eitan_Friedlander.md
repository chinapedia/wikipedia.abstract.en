Friedlander and Brokman were set to compete in the 470 sailing event at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, but did not because Israel joined in the US-led boycott of the Olympics prompted by the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan.[10]

Friedlander competed for Israel at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 26 in Sailing.[11] In the Men's 470 Mixed Two Person Dinghy, he and Brokman came in 8th out of 28 teams.[12][13] When he competed in the Olympics he was 6-1.5 (187 cm) tall and weighed 161 lbs (73 kg).[14]
