MOSHER is an unincorporated community in Ste. Genevieve Township in eastern Sainte Genevieve County, Missouri, United States. It is situated approximately two miles west of Ste. Genevieve. The community most likely was named after a local French colonial family _Mosier_ or _Mosieur_. English spelling of the French pronunciation may account for the spelling of the community's name. The community developed as a stop along the Missouri-Illinois Railroad.[1]
