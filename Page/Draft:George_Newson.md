@worldbruce The Journal of New Music Research is a Taylor & Francis peer review journal! The title of the piece is however, misleading and this reference has been removed.

{{COI} I have a COI as George Newson is my grandfather - I started the Wikipedia page not realising how problematic this was but, nonetheless maintain that it is a relevant, credible entry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

George Newson is a contemporary composer and photographer. He made substantial advances in electronic composition and modes of recording for British electronic music in the 1960s[1]. He has 18 works in 17 library holdings[2] and collections with the British Music Collection [3], the University of Glasgow[4], the Scottish Music Centre[5], and the British Library[6].


Early life

Born in London's docklands (1932) Newson taught himself to read music and play the piano[7]. He was overheard playing boogie-woogie piano in a youth centre and was awarded a piano scholarship to the Blackheath Conservatoire of Music, London, aged 14, just a few years after having been evacuated during the Blitz. Nine years later, he attended Royal Academy of Music on a scholarship.


Music and performances

From 1966, Newson set song cycles to poems by friend, Leonard Smith, for the BBC entitled _The Man Who Collected Sounds_, heralded as 'equally ambitious in its radiophonic exploitation of sounds and voices[8]'. This was facilitated by the BBC Radiphonic Workshop and the technical facilitation given by Delia Derbyshire, in the realisation of tape parts. No further access to the Radiophonic Workshop was allowed without further BBC commission, thus providing impetus for George to pursue a WINSTON CHURCHILL FELLOWSHIP[9].

In 1967 he was granted a fellowship to the USA[10]. Here he stayed in Trumansburg and abased himself at the Moog factory with Robert Moog for several weeks, but his five month stay included visits to a number of other major electronic studios, including the Southern Illinosis University in Carbondale and the UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOSIS, URBANA[11]. There he composed _Silent Spring_, in which birdsong rather than instruments played a prominent role making a statement about humanity's impact upon nature that was decades ahead of its time[12]_._ He then worked at the RAI STUDIO, Milan, producing _Canto II_ for clarinet and tape (1968), which was performed at the Venice Biennale in 1969. In the same year he worked at the UNIVERSITY OF UTRECHT, making his third tape composition, _Genus II_. Here, his electronic works sponsored by the British Society for Electronic Music were well received[13].

George went on to hold the CRAMB RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP IN COMPOSITION at Glasgow University (1972-75), where he received critical acclaim for pieces he composed for the Scottish National Orchestra[14]. The BBC (William Glock) commissioned _Arena_ for the 1971 PROMS (conductor, Boulez; singer, Celo Laine)[15], _Songs for the Turning Year_ for the 1993 season, and various other chamber and ensemble works over three decades. One of his most studied pieces is _Arena_ - 'a kind of staged oratorio addressing different sociopolitical "games", climaxing in the shooting of anti-Vietnam student protestors at Kent State University' [16]. _Arena_ attracted attention as a particularly important political piece of its time [17]

Collaborations with poets

Particular acclaim has focused on Newson's work for voice; 'There is much to admire in Newson’s gift for writing lyrically, even romantically, and yet simply for the voice' (Manning, 1986) [18]. With his residency in Belfast and collaborations with Irish poets, his work has been noted as deserving recognition in celebrations of Irish music[19].

Further commissions

Other commissions include: his one act opera _Mrs Fraser’s Frenzy_ (1994) for the Canterbury and Cheltenham festivals; _Sonograms 1 & 11_ (1995) for the ORCHESTRE NATIONAL DE LILLE; and _Songs_ and _More Songs in Exchange_  (1994/9), which comprised an exhibition and recital of works exchanged by participating artists for a song (42 pieces in all)[20]. In 1998 _Concerto for Percussion (Both Arms)_ was commissioned by Evelyn Glennie for the 2002 CANTERBURY FESTIVAL[21] and George completed his second full opera - _The Winter’s Tale_.

Recent works (2000 - present)

His most recent large work is _Cantiga_ _for_ _Piano Trio,_ which received its premiere at the RYE FESTIVAL OF MUSIC AND ARTS (2004). His double violin concerto was given its UK Premier as part of the BBC ENCORE series in 2006 and _A Lullaby for Aya,_ which he wrote for his first great-grandchild, was included in a set of new songs performed at the Rye Festival in 2016. Newson's _Ezra Pound_ from _More Songs in Exchange_ opened one of the LUDLOW MUSIC FESTIVAL recitals (UK composers setting US texts) in 2017, performed by Robin Tritschler and Iain Burnside.


Photographic career

George is also a keen photographer, with a collection of 57 portraits of eminent composers and artists at the National Portrait Gallery. [22] He has photographed many composers and musicians including; Oliver Knussen, Priaulx Rainier, Sir Richard Rodney Bennett, Alexander Goher, Sir Andrzej Panufnik, David Bedford, (John) Nicholas Maw, Sir Harrison Birtwistle, and father and son Sir Lennox Randal Francis Berkeley and Michael Berkeley. His portraits also include: poets Michael Longley, Seamus Heaney, and Paul Muldoon; painters Ruskin Spear and Carel Weight; sculptor Kenneth Armitage; cartoonist Martin Honeysett; photographers Bert Hardy and George Rodger; and the musicology writer Hans Keller.
