PIERRE DUMONSTIER II (1585-1656) was a French artist.


Life

His family produced several artists. The son of Pierre Dumonstier I, Pierre was sometimes known as 'le neveu' (the nephew). He was one of at least five family members who made a specialism of chalk portrait drawings. Only ten drawings by him were catalogued by Louis Damier in his _Histoire de la peinture de portrait en France au XVIe si√®cle_. One of these is a 1625 drawing of the hand of Artemisia Gentileschi, probably made just after Dumonstier's arrival in Rome.[1]
