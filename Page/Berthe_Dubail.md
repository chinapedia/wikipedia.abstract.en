Biography

Berthe Dubail studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Mons, and at the workshop of La Cambre in Brussels dedicated to monumental painting, she further worked in Paris, at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in the free workshops.
In parallel to her artistic research, she became a professor in Mons and then in Brussels, and developed a new method of teaching that awakened and respected the spontaneity and spirit of discovery of the student. After an early expressionist and figurative period from 1945 to 1956, she turned to a more abstract style.[1][2]
