The HONOUR MEDAL OF RAILROADS () is a state decoration bestowed by the French Republic in the form of an honour medal for work. It was originally meant to reward, depending on the quality and length of time calculated in calendar years, the services rendered by French agents and labourers and to nationals of the French Union or protectorates, in service with the railroads. The Honour medal of railroads was created by decree on 19 August 1913 as a reward for thirty years of service.[1] Since then, many modifications were instituted by consecutive decrees amending the original text.


Award statute

The Honour medal of railroads used to be awarded to salaried labourers, French nationals or citizens of another state of the European Community, in service or having served with the railroads at the national or local level in continental France, Corsica or in an overseas department, or detached abroad. The medal could also be awarded to both French and foreign nationals under contract, and serving with the National society of French railways (SNCF) on the national territory and to foreign citizens under contract representing the SNCF abroad.[2][3] It is now only awarded to salaried labourers and retired salaried labourers of rail transport enterprises operating in continental France.[4]

The medal may be awarded posthumously.[5] Also, any military veteran, holder of the Order of the Legion of Honour, of the Médaille militaire or of the Resistance Medal, or of any grade of the National Order of Merit and two wartime awards, will be awarded the silver gilt level for twenty-five years of service and the gold level for thirty years of service.[6][7]

The Honour medal of railroads may also be bestowed for exceptional acts of bravery and courage carried out during official duties for the railways.[8]

All past state secretaries and ministers for transport receive the gold level award.[9][10]


Award levels

The Honour medal of railroads is currently divided into three levels:

-   Silver: 25 years of service;
-   Silver gilt: 35 years of service;
-   Gold: 38 years of service.

These time criteria are reduced respectively to 20, 30 and 33 years of service for train engineers that can attest to at least 15 years in that position.[11] Awardees also receive a scroll attesting to the award.[12]
