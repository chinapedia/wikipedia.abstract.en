NICOLAES CAVE[1] (_fl_ 1619 â€“ 1651) was a Flemish Baroque still life painter, whose few known works are still lifes featuring game.


Life

Very little is known about this artist. He is first mentioned when he registers as a member of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1619. He was active in Antwerp until 1651, the year in which his death dues were paid to the Guild.[2]


Work

The work of this obscure still life painter is fairly unknown. He painted several versions of a still life with a live hawk (or falcon) perched on a dead partridge together with other dead game in a woven basket. A signed version was recorded with Schlichte Bergen in 1993 and another was auctioned at Sotheby's in 2008 (Sotheby's 11 November 2008, London, lot 138).[3] Although his work shows indebtedness to that of Clara Peeters, the stylistic elements in Cave's work show a clear individuality.[4]
