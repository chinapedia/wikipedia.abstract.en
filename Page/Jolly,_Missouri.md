JOLLY is an unincorporated community in Newton County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] A variant name was "Jollification".[2]


History

A post office called Jolly was established in 1898, and remained in operation until 1903.[3] Jolly was named after the proprietor of a nearby watermill.[4] Jolly Mill, built on Capps Creek in 1848, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[5]

The historic mill community is the centerpiece of the privately-funded "Jolly Milly Park", open to the public.[6]
