SIMON MEYER KUPER (1906-1963)[1] was a judge of the South African Supreme Court, and a noted leader in the South African Jewish community.[2][3] His children include anthropologist Adam Kuper.[4]


Early life

Kuper was born in Johannesburg in 1906. He attended Jeppe High School and subsequently gained his B.A. and LL.B. at the University of the Witwatersrand.[5]


Career

Kuper was admitted to the Bar in 1927.[6] He joined Group 621 of the Johannesburg Bar.[7][8] After practising law for several years, he was appointed King's Counsel in 1946 and became a judge at the South African Supreme Court in 1955.[9][10][11][12][13][14]

The South African Supreme Court consists of several divisions. Kuper sat in the Transvaal Provincial Division,[15] which covers Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.


Civic activities

In 1946, Kuper provided evidence before the Anglo-American Commission of Inquiry on Palestine, on behalf of South African Jews.[16]

At the February 1954 Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, Kuper represented South African Jews, together with Abel Shaban.[17]

Kuper was chairman of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies from 1944–49, and was chairman of the South African Zionist Federation from 1950–55.[18][19] Kuper's resignation from the chairmanship of the latter, which was made in order to pursue his career at the Supreme Court, was honoured by a pledge to plant a grove of 1,000 trees in Israel.[20] Kuper subsequently became honorary president of the South African Zionist Federation.[21]

Kuper was at one time president of the United Hebrew Congregation, honorary vice-president of the Israel United Appeal, and honorary vice-president of the South African Jewish Appeal.[22]


Death

On the evening of 8 March 1963, Kuper, who was at home with his wife and daughter, was shot through a window by an unknown assailant.[23][24][25] He died twelve days later.[26][27][28][29]

Later that year, a hall at the Oxford Shul in Johannesburg, where Kuper had been a member of the congregation, was named in his memory.[30] In November 1963, a new B'nai B'rith lodge, founded in Johannesburg, was named after Kuper.[31]

Mr. Justice Ludorf said of Kuper:[32]
