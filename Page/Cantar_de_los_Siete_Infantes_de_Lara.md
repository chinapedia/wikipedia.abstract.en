in the Monastery of San Millán de Suso, which contains a sarcophagus claimed to be that of the seven _infantes_ of the legend.]] The _CANTAR DE LOS SIETE INFANTES DE LARA_ (Song of the Seven Lara Princes) is a legend, perhaps derived from a lost _cantar de gesta_, that relates a tale of family feuding and revenge, centering on the murder of the eponymous seven _infantes_, princes, of Lara or Salas. The legend survives in prose form in medieval chronicles, the oldest being in the extended version of the _Estoria de España_ (History of Spain) compiles during the reign of Sancho IV of Castile, before 1289 (edited by Ramón Menéndez Pidal under the name _Primera Crónica General_).[1] From the account found in this chronicle as well as mention in the _Crónica de 1344_ (_Segunda Crónica General_) and interpolations into a copy of the _Tercera Crónica General_ dating from 1512, Menéndez Pidal found evidence for the existence of an ancient _cantar de gesta_, lost but partially reconstructed, dating back to the year 1000, that would, along with the _Cantar de Mio Cid_ and the _Poema de Fernán González_, represent one of the most important epic _cantares_ of Castilian literature, and the most primitive example of the Spanish epic. The legendary tradition of the _Infantes de Lara_ has also been developed though ballads. Some more recent scholars have rejected this, dating the story to shortly before the surviving prose versions.[2] The _Infantes de Lara_ were the children of Castilian nobleman Gonzalo Gustioz of Lara or Salas and his wife "_Doña Sancha_" (lady Sancha). The story revolves around a family feud, an escalating tit-for-tat cycle of revenge, between their family and that of Sancha's brother, Ruy Velázquez and his wife _Doña_ Lambra.[3]Barton, pp. 137–138


The legend

According to the version transmitted by the _Estoria de España_, at the wedding between _Doña_ Lambra, from Bureba, and Ruy Velázquez of Lara, a confrontation arose between the bride's family and the sons of Sancha, the _infantes_. In this confrontation, Alvar Sánchez, cousin of _Doña_ Lambra, was killed by Gonzalo González, the youngest of the seven Lara princes. Later Gonzalo González is seen by _Doña_ Lambra, having undressed to his underwear to bath his goshawk, and Lambra interprets it as an intentional sexual provocation. Taking advantage of this to avenge the death of her cousin Alvar, Lambra orders her servant to strip and humiliate Gonzalo González in front of her brothers, throwing a blood-covered cucumber at him. The irate Gonzalo and his brothers respond by killing the servant at Lambra's feet, spattering her with her servant's blood. shows the heads of the seven _infantes_, plus that of a faithful retainer, to their father Gonzalo Gustioz. Engraving by Otto Venius, seventeenth century.]] Thirsting for revenge, Lambra and her husband Ruy Velázquez come up with a plan to send the father of the _infantes_, Gonzalo Gustioz, lord of Salas, as envoy to the ruler of Córdoba, Almanzor, to request money to help pay for their lavish wedding. Unbeknownst to him, he carries a letter that tells Almanzor of Ruy's plans to have the _infantes_ ambushed and murdered, and requesting that the letter bearer likewise be killed. Ruy Velásquez carries out the ambush of his nephews, the _infantes_, by Muslim troops and supervises their beheading, sending the severed heads to Córdoba to torment their father. His painful laments for his sons represent one of the most emotional in all of Castilian epic tradition[4] Almanzor takes pity on him and merely has him imprisoned. In the earliest surviving version, a female servant is assigned to tend to him, and they fall in love and have a sexual liaison. In the later version of the _Crónica de 1344_, she is a sister of Almanzor himself and is offered up to Gonzalo, who takes her by force. She becomes pregnant and has a son named Mudarra González who will eventually return Castile and there consummate the family's revenge by murdering Ruy Velásquez and burning Lambra alive.[5]Barton, pp. 139–140

Shortly before his release, when Gonzalo Gustioz learns his lover is expecting a child, he sees the opportunity for help in his planned revenge against Ruy Velázquez. He takes a ring and breaks it in two, keeping one half and leaving the other to be given the child, so that later they will be able to recognize each other by matching the two sides. The child, Mudarra González, grows up and goes north to Castile to find his father, and when they unite the two halves of the ring, which fit perfectly. The version in the _Crónica de 1344_ has the aged Gonzalo Gustioz become blind and when the halves of the ring are aligned, he miraculously regains his sight and the ring is permanently rejoined.[6]


Literary analysis

Menéndez Pidal argued that the rendition of the existing legend found in the chronicles likely used as source an epic poem, and ancient _cantar de gesta_ composed around the year 990. He deduced this from the abundance of assonant rhymes and other features common to epic literature that are retained in the chronicle prose. There is a consensus among philologists that there was a _Cantar de Los Siete Infantes de Lara_, as the verses of the epic were not overly disturbed. Attempts have been made to reconstruct the original _Cantar_. In this regard, Mercedes Vaquero has identified signs in the prose texts of oral delivery, suggesting that at some point there was a lay that was either spoken or sung.[7]

The _Cantar de los Siete Infantes de Lara_ (or _de Salas_) refers to the historical situation in Castile about 990, and this has been used to date the poem, although not all scholars agree that the epic predates 1000, as this would place it before the great French epic cycles that could have been its inspiration. Barton states that recent analysis places the origin of the story in the 13th century.[8]

In this regard, Carlos and Manuel Alvar note that many of the primitive motivations expressed in the _Cantar de Los Siete Infantes de Lara_ relate more with the Scandinavian and Germanic epics (such as Nibelungenlied) than with the Romance epics. These include the importance of blood ties, the cruelty of revenge as a way of imposing an individual justice not supported by social institutions or a body of law, and the aggressiveness of passionate sexually-charged relationships. Erich von Richthofen in his studies of this epic has pointed to numerous analogies with the epic of central and northern Europe,[9] in particular stating that in addition to many original Castilian elements and motifs, the epic of the Lara princes has many in common with the _Thidrekssaga_ - the disgrace of Odila and her husband Sifka's planned revenge, his collaboration with his friend the governor, Fridrek's trip with his six companions and their ambush by the governor that leads to the death of the seven knights; plus details provided to the episodes of the death of Egard and Aki at Fritila, the theme of skulls sent to a father, and the revenge of the Hogni's son.[10]

The idea of a Muslim woman assisting a prisoner to escape plays a role in other popular stories of the time. Orderic Vitalis tells an analogous story relating to Bohemond I of Antioch, while such an episode also appears in the _Prise d'Orange_, a 12th-century _Chanson de geste_.[11] His relationship with Almanzor's sister is the trigger and mechanism by which Gonzalo gets his revenge on his brother- and sister-in-law, while the sister of Almanzor is seen as a proxy for all of Muslim Al-Andalus, taken by force,[12]Barton, pp. 139–141 and producing a righteous Christian progeny, represented by Mudarra, the product of the liaison, praised as a "very good Christian and at God’s service, and was the most honourable man that there was in Castile, apart from Count Garcia Fernandez".[13] According to Ramón Menéndez Pidal, the subplot in which the ring is used for recognition shows the Germanic origin of the Spanish epic. Barton notes sexual imagery in the episode involving Gonzalo González and Doña Lambra, with Gonzalo bathing his goshawk a metaphor for masturbation, and the blood-covered cucumber representing castration.[14]

According to Ramón Menéndez Pidal there were several versions of the poem, some much later than the original. The name of the song would be _Los Siete Infantes de Salas_, since the name "Lara" is not mentioned. In this, _Doña_ Lambra is married to Ruy Velázquez. He does not assert that all the characters are historical, indeed, he was not able to find any historical evidence for the majority of the characters. Its poetic elements included the deaths of the _infantes_ and their avenger, Mudarra.[15]

Alan Deyermond notes that the background story contains common and universal themes of folklore, such as the letter ordering the death of the messenger (a point of commonality with _Hamlet_), the love of a young woman for her brother's captive, and the protagonist's mysterious ancestry.[16] The Englishman observed that the _Cantar de los Siete Infantes de Lara_ or _Salas_ is valued for its antiquity and priority in its genre, and it reflects what would be the heroic age of the birth and formation of Castile, a period which in turn was when the epic saw gestation in the villages. In addition, he extols the forceful rendering of some passages, such as when Mudarra threatens _Doña_ Lambra and her attempt to seek protection:

No manuscript of the _Cantar de los Siete Infantes de Lara_ survives (although Ramón Menéndez Pidal and, to a lesser extent, Erich von Richthofen have reconstructed many of its verses), yet it has had a large influence on later literature. A partial list includes: ]]

-   The prose rendering of the _Cantar_ in the _Primera Crónica General_, the _Crónica de 1344_, and the _Crónica de los Veinte Reyes_.
-   Fragments of the _Cantar_ in Romance epics, mostly old Ballads. Six epic romances of the _infantes de Lara_ survive.
-   Several plays, including:
    -   _Siete Infantes_, written by Juan de la Cueva in 1579.
    -   _El Bastardo Mudarra_, written in 1612 by Lope de Vega.
    -   _La Gran Tragedia de los Siete Infantes de Lara_, written by Alonso Hurtado Velarde between 1612 and 1624.
-   _Los SIete Infantes de Lara_, a novel by Manuel Fernández y González, published in 1853.
-   _El Moro Expósito_ (1834), a poem in hendecasyllable metre by the Duke of Rivas.


Sarcophagi and tombs

Since ancient times several monasteries have exhibited relics of the legendary _Siete Infantes_. Such links with prestigious heroes (be they real or fictional) and the pilgrims attracted by them provided these ecclesiastical establishments with increased economic resources. Thus, the supposed sarcophaguses of the seven _infantes_ are exhibited in the Monastery of San Millan de Suso, although the authenticity of the claimed remains of the brothers is disputed by other monasteries, such as San Pedro de Arlanza; also the church of Santa María de Salas de los Infantes claims to have their heads, and long exhibited seven skulls as those of the brothers; on the other hand, the tomb of Mudarra is said to be in Burgos Cathedral. The contest for possession of relics of famous heroes from legend has been common since the Middle Ages.
