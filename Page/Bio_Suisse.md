BIO SUISSE is the main organisation of organic agriculture in Switzerland. It notably manages the guidelines of the organic label "Bio Suisse".[1]

It was founded in 1981 and, as federation of the Swiss organic farmers, represents the interest of about 6,100 agricultural businesses (regularly inspected by independent bodies).[2] It also certifies 900 processing companies.

The organic label "Bio Suisse" is widely distributed in Switzerland, for instance through the largest supermarkets chains: Migros (1,300 products) and Coop (1,800 products).


History

As of 2012, eleven percent of Swiss farms are organic.[3]

Between 2010 and 2015, the surface of organic agriculture in Switzerland increased of 23 percent, reaching 136,000 hectares.[4]

Since 2015, the Conservatory and Botanical Garden of the City of Geneva is the first public garden in Switzerland to formally meet the standards of Bio Suisse.

In 2017, Migros introduced a new label, in addition to "Migros Bio", for organic products containing at least 90% of Swiss ingredients ("Migros Bio Suisse").
