Reception

It features a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes with the Critic Consensus reading, "This strange, heartfelt documentary from film critic Godfrey Cheshire is a fascinating examination of his family roots, as well as an evocative meditation on the complexities of the South." Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, claiming that "it starts in one direction and discovers a better one. Cheshire is a dry, almost dispassionate narrator, and that is good; preaching about his discoveries would sound wrong."[1] _LA Weekly_ named it the 9th best film of 2008 along with _The Order of Myths_.[2] Andrew Sarris of _New York Observer_ named it the 2nd best non-fiction film of the year.[3]
