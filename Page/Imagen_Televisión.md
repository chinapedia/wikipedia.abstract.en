IMAGEN TELEVISIÓN is a national broadcast television network in Mexico, owned by Grupo Imagen. It launched on October 17, 2016, at 8 p.m.


History

Imagen on television

In 2006, Imagen's parent, Grupo Empresarial Ángeles, acquired XHRAE-TV channel 28 in Mexico City from its previous owner, beleaguered businessman Raúl Aréchiga Espinoza, for US$126 million. Imagen already owned radio stations in Mexico City and other major cities nationwide. The next year, GEA relaunched the station as "cadenatres", with the ambition of functioning as Mexico's third broadcast network. Despite this and national basic cable carriage, cadenatres only had a handful of local affiliates. On October 26, 2015, cadenatres was shuttered and replaced with news outlet Excélsior TV as Imagen began preparing to launch its national network.[1]

A new national network

In 2014, the Federal Telecommunications Institute began a bidding process to make available packages of new national television networks. Two packages were available, each containing 123 transmitters. Three bidders continued to the final round: Grupo Imagen, under the name Cadena Tres I, S.A. de C.V.; Grupo Radio Centro; and Organización Editorial Mexicana (Centro de Información Nacional de Estudios Tepeyac, S.A. de C.V.), which operates the ABC Radio network.[2] OEM dropped out unexpectedly just days before the death of its CEO, Mario Vázquez Raña,[3][4] paving the way for Cadena Tres I and GRC to be declared the winning bidders on March 11, 2015.[5] Imagen paid 1.808 billion pesos for the concession.[6] Radio Centro, whose bid was significantly higher, subsequently ran into financial problems and dropped out, paying only the security deposit; thus, Imagen would be the only new national network created as the result of the bidding process. The concessions held by Imagen bind them to two coverage clauses; they must serve 30 percent of the population in each of the 32 Mexican federative entities by March 2018, and within five years of the concession award, all 123 transmitters must be on air.[7] Imagen's CEO, Olegario Vázquez Aldir, also announced a planned investment of 10 billion pesos to build out the network over 36 to 40 months.[8] Some of this investment went into building _Ciudad Imagen_ (Imagen City), a new facility in the Copilco neighborhood of Mexico City with of floor space, five studios for entertainment programs, a sixth for news, and three radio studios.[9]

In October 2015, Imagen was approved to relocate all stations planned to be built above channel 36, in order to facilitate the repacking of television spectrum. Several other transmitters changed allocated channels as a result.[10]

The first of the launch transmitters to come to air was the Mexico City station, XHCTMX-TDT, which signed on with color bars on August 19, 2016. In late September, the launch date was announced as Monday, October 17, and Imagen unveiled a new corporate logo designed by Chermayeff & Geismar & Haviv, a New York-based graphic design firm, which will also serve as the network's logo.[11][12] In addition, the name of the network, Imagen Televisión, was formally announced, along with the initial slogan _Juntos Somos Libres_; Vázquez Aldir cited the desire to not merely be "the third network" and to have a more forward-looking moniker as reasons to bypass the Cadena Tres name.[13] The launch makes Imagen the first new national commercial network to begin operations in Mexico since the privatization of Imevisión and resultant creation of Televisión Azteca in 1993.[14]


Programming

Vázquez Aldir described Imagen's programming approach as "a family channel, with a focus on women".[15]

General entertainment

Imagen's first two original telenovelas, produced in collaboration with Argos Comunicación and Estudios TeleMéxico, were _Vuelve temprano_ and _Perseguidos_.[16] The latter was originally known as _El Capo_ (The Drug Lord) but was changed, potentially to prevent a reclassification of the program that would have required it to air after midnight.[17] The network also picked up two Brazilian series, _José de Egipto_ (Joseph from Egypt) and _Reglas del Juego_ (Rules of The Game), and the Colombian novela _Lady, la vendedora de rosas_.[18]

News

Imagen Televisión features three weekday newscasts. Ciro Gómez Leyva, who hosts a Radio Fórmula morning show and formerly worked for Televisa and CNI Canal 40, hosts the network's flagship late news.[19] Francisco Zea hosts the network's morning show,[20] while Yuriria Sierra anchors its afternoon newscast at 2pm.[21]

The network also has a three-hour morning magazine program, _Sale El Sol_,[22] hosted by Luz María Zetina, Mauricio Barcelata, Carlos Arenas and Paulina Mercado.[23][24]

Sports

Javier Alarcón was brought in to head Imagen's sports division and was among the first major hires for the network.[25]

Imagen holds the rights to broadcast two Liga MX soccer clubs, its co-owned Querétaro FC and Jaguares de Chiapas (which would disappear after the 2017 season), though it subleased much of those rights to SKY México as the network was not on air.[26] Both clubs' home matches will generally air on Saturdays at 5pm.[27] The first soccer match to air on Imagen was a Querétaro fixture against Club América on October 22.[28] For the Clausura 2017 tournament, Imagen began carrying Club León and C.F. Pachuca fixtures as well.[29]

One regular sports program airs on Imagen, a Sunday night discussion program titled _Adrenalina_.[30]

In June 2018, Imagen started airing a one-hour version of _WWE Raw_ and _SmackDown_ every Saturday afternoon.[31]

Children's

Imagen's children's programming block consists of a mix of classic series and newer programs. This also includes programming from Nickelodeon, thus making Imagen the second station to currently air Nick shows in Mexico aside from Canal 5.

Local programming

Currently, only Puebla provides local programming on Imagen Televisión. Imagen TV Puebla launched in January 2018, utilizing the resources of AS Media, which had previously produced TV Azteca Puebla local programs.[32][33]


Transmitters

Imagen Televisión, through Cadena Tres I, S.A. de C.V., is currently authorized to operate 46 main stations and one repeater covering 61.72 percent of the population in parts of all Mexican states.[34] 38 transmitters were on air at launch,[35] while 42 currently operate. The transmitters launched on air are primarily in state capitals, densely populated cities, and those that contribute most to the national gross domestic product.[36] The transmitter network has primarily been deployed using preexisting public and commercial infrastructure, notably including towers owned by the Sistema Público de Radiodifusión del Estado Mexicano (SPR), Canal Once, MVS Radio, and several of Imagen's own radio stations. Each callsign represents the primary city listed in the IFT-defined coverage areas, though in several cases, Imagen built the transmitter in another, larger city within the coverage area—sometimes in another state.

On July 4, 2018, the IFT awarded Imagen TV an 18-month extension of its national coverage obligations. Imagen cited crime problems, negotiations with landowners and municipal permitting processes as factors necessitating the extension.

Almost all stations have been allotted virtual channel 3, though one on the border region with the United States was tentatively given virtual channel 13 until the IFT coordinates with the US Federal Communications Commission.

38 transmitters carry Excélsior TV, Imagen's cable news channel, as subchannel 3.4. This does not include the Mexico City transmitter, as Excélsior is available over the air on XHTRES-TDT.

The Chihuahua transmitters had been authorized in June 2018 to carry Canal 16, a forthcoming television channel operated by the Chihuahua state government, as subchannel 3.3; after a delay, this service never began operations. |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |-
