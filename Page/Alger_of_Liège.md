ALGER OF LIÈGE (1055–1131), known also as Alger of Cluny and Algerus Magister, was a learned clergyman from Liège author of several notable works.

Alger was first deacon of church of St Bartholomew in his native Liège and was then appointed () to St. Lambert's Cathedral. He declined offers from German bishops and finally retired to the monastery of Cluny, where he died at a high age, leaving behind a solid reputation for piety and intelligence. This cites:

-   Migne, _Patrol Ser. Lat._ vol. clxxx. pp. 739–972
-   Herzog-Hauck, _Realencyk. für prot. Theol._, art, by S. M. Deutsch.

His _History of the Church of Liège_, and many of his other works, are lost. The most important remaining are:

1.  _De Misericordia et Justitia_ (On Mercy and Justice), a collection of biblical extracts and sayings of Church Fathers with commentary (an important work for the history of church law and discipline), which is to be found in the _Anecdota_ of Martène, vol. v.
2.  _De Sacramentis Corporis et Sanguinis Domini_; a treatise, in three books, against the Berengarian heresy, highly commended by Peter of Cluny and Erasmus.
3.  _De Gratia et Libero Arbitrio_; given in Bernard Pez's _Anecdota_, vol. iv.
4.  _De Sacrificio Missae_; given in the _Collectio Scriptor. Vet._ of Angelo Mai, vol. ix. p. 371.[1]
