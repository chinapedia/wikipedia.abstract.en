_MILIONIA BREVIPENNIS_ is a species of moth in the family Geometridae first described by Karl Jordan and Walter Rothschild in 1895. It is found in New Guinea.[1]

The forewings are identical to those of _Milionia callimorpha_, but broader, with the band narrower and, on the underside, abbreviated behind. The hindwings are short and rounded, with a yellow band as in _M. callimorpha_, but this band is not shaded with black on the underside. Furthermore, the third basal segment of the abdomen is all black, not yellow.[2]
