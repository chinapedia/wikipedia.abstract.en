Biography

Taslima Akhter was born in Dhaka, in Bangladesh, in 1974.[1] Akhter is a graduate of Dhaka University, with Master's degrees in science and in public administration.[2] While at the university, she was a member of the Bangladesh Student's Federation.[3] She went on the study photojournalism at Pathshala,[4] a photography school in Dhaka, which was founded by Shahidul Alam.[5] She tries to bring attention to social and environmental issues through her photography, driven partly by her experience during the 2008 political emergency in Bangladesh.[6] Akhter was among those who documented the fire at Tasreen Garments factory in 2012.[7] Akhter has worked on projects in several cities in Bangladesh, as well as in Nandigram in India.[8] Her work led to her receiving the Magnum Foundation scholarship in 2010.[9] Her work has been exhibited in several countries.[10]

Akhter is a member of the women's organization _Biplobi Nari Sanghati_ and the leftist activist group _Gana Sanghati Andolan_.[11] She is also a coordinator of the _Garments Sramik Sangathan_ (garment worker's union).[12][13] In addition, she teaches at _Pathshala_.[14] Akhter's politics have an influence on her photography.[15]


Final Embrace

Following the Rana Plaza collapse in April 2013, Akhter and other photographers from _Pathshala_ tried to document the lives of people who had died there,[16] while also taking part in the rescue effort.[17] These stories were later published as a book, titled _Chobbish April: Hazaar Praner Chitkar_ (24 April: outcries of a thousand souls).[18] The publication was related to Akhter's work with the garment workers' union.[19] During this process, Akhter photographed a man and woman who had died in the building collapse, locked in an embrace with each other.[20] Akhter was unable to identify the subjects of the photograph despite much effort.[21] [22] This photograph, known variously as the "Eternal Embrace",[23] the "Death of A Thousand Dreams",[24] and the "Final Embrace,"[25] received widespread critical attention and multiple awards, and became emblematic of the incident, in which 1100 people died.[26] The photograph also received widespread attention online, and led to petitions to clothing companies demanding higher minimum wages and improved safety standards.[27] Akhter described herself a being haunted by the photograph.[28][29]
