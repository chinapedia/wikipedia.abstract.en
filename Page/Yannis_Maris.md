YANNIS TSIRIMOKOS (1916–1979) was a Greek left-wing journalist, better known under the name YANNIS MARIS (Γιάννης Μαρής) as a writer of detective fiction.[1] From 1953, Maris wrote over forty short and well plotted novels that at the time were looked down on in Greece as pulp fiction, but have in later years come to be regarded as classics of the crime genre. Many of the novels feature Inspector Bekas (Αστυνόμος Μπέκας), the title figure of a contemporary Greek TV series.[2][3] Maris was noted for the humorous and coded names of his books' characters.[4]

[1] Petros Markaris, in an interview with Lambrini Kozeli, in the weekly «To Vima», April 6, 2011) “Maris is the patriarch of Greek crime fiction. If his extraordinary stories did not have the luck they deserved, it was because of historical circumstances. Maris wrote at the wrong time and in the wrong place, in a country that considered crime novel series a B genre. Yet no other writer of the time was able to describe with equal vigour Athenian high society after the war and the undergrowth of informers who became rich during the occupation and civil strife. If he had written, say, in French, now he would be famous around the world.”
