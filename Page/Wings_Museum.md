The WINGS MUSEUM is an aviation museum located in Sussex, United Kingdom. It is housed in a hangar-like former farm building in Brantridge Lane, between Handcross and Balcombe. The museum displays mainly World War II-related flying memorabilia and equipment which have been donated,[1][2] or which have been recovered and restored by volunteers.[3]


History

The museum was originally located at Redhill Aerodrome.[4] By 2011 it had relocated to Brantridge Lane.[5]

In 2013, the museum hosted a fundraiser for the upkeep of the Bomber Command Memorial in nearby Green Park.[6][7]

In 2015, volunteers restored a Bristol Beaufighter Mk1f which had crashed 75 years earlier.[8]


Aircraft on display

Visitors to the museum can walk inside a complete fuselage from a Douglas C-47 Dakota which was used on D-Day[9] and later during the filming of the television series _Band of Brothers_. [10]
