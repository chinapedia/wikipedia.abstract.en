ATTILA BERTALAN is a Canadian actor and filmmaker.[1] He is most noted for his 1990 film _A Bullet in the Head_, which was selected as Canada's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1991.[2]

Originally from British Columbia,[3] Bertalan was twice honoured by the Canadian Student Film Festival while he was a film student at the University of British Columbia, receiving an honourable mention in 1982 for _The Glass Door_[4] and winning Best Director and Best Fiction Film in 1984 for _The Roomer_.[5] Later based in Montreal, he acted in several films, including Bashar Shbib's _Seductio_, _Clair Obscur_ and _15 Ugly Sisters_, while making _A Bullet in the Head_. The film, a war allegory about an injured soldier's struggle to survive in unfamiliar territory, was spoken entirely in an invented language.[6]

In 1992, _A Bullet in the Head_ was screened by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City as part of a Canadian film series that also included Léa Pool's _The Savage Woman (La Demoiselle sauvage)_ and André Forcier's _An Imaginary Tale (Une histoire inventée)_.[7]

Bertalan's second film, _Between the Moon and Montevideo_, was released in 2000.[8] A science fiction film set on a space station, the film starred Bertalan, Gerard Gagnon and Pascale Bussières.[9]
