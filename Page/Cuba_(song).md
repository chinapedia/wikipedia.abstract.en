"CUBA" is a 1978 song by the Gibson Brothers taken from their album _Cuba_. It was the group's first charting single reaching number 41 in the UK upon its original release however following the success of their following top 10 hit songs "Ooh, What a Life" and "Que Sera Mi Vida (If You Should Go)"; it was re-released in 1980 where it reached number 12 in the UK with "Better Do It Salsa", however, its chart performance did not improve in the U.S due in large part to the anti Disco Backlash in the states at the time.
