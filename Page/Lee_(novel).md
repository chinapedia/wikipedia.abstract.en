_LEE_ is a 1991 novel by the American writer Tito Perdue. It tells the story of an angry and well-read septuagenarian, Leland "Lee" Pefley, who returns to his hometown in Alabama after many years in the North.


Publication

The book was published on August 15, 1991 by Four Walls Eight Windows.[1][2] It was reissued in paperback in 2007, to coincide with the publication of _Fields of Asphodel_.[3]


Reception

_Publishers Weekly_ wrote: "Steeped in Greek classics, spouting cultured allusions to such subjects as Persian painting and Dostoyevski, Lee fancies himself a chastiser of humanity, satirist of the New South, a self-ordained Nietzschean prophet of the crumbling of the West. ... A solipsistic little parable of spiritual self-delusion, the novel starts out interestingly but sinks under the weight of its own pretensions."[4]

_Kirkus Reviews_ found that Perdue "writes convincingly and iconoclastically about a misanthrope who is frightening in his complete contempt for anyone who has not 'held on to their soul.'" The citic continued: "While Lee's critique of modernity seems to be deadly serious, Perdue offers a marvelous black comedy that is sometimes as astringent as John Yount's _Toots in Solitude_. A promising debut."[5]

Jim Knipfel wrote in _New York Press_ in 2001 that reading _Lee_ when it came out "hooked [him] for good" on Perdue and made Perdue one of his favorite authors.[6]


Series

The main character and his relatives appear in a number of the author's other books. These include _The New Austerities_ (1994), which depicts Lee in his middle age working for an insurance company, _Opportunities in Alabama Agriculture_ (1994), which is about his grandfather, _The Sweet-Scented Manuscript_ (2004), about Lee's college days, and _Fields of Asphodel_ (2007), which is about Lee in the afterlife.[7][8]
