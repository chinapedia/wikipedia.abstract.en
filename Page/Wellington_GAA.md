WELLINGTON GAA (WGAA) was established in 1975. It is the ruling body for Gaelic football and hurling in the Wellington region of New Zealand. The AGAA is affiliated to the Australasia GAA.

The AGAA runs both Men's and Women's Football matches over the summer at Seddon Fields in Wellington. The competition was previously played over winter, however clashes with other sports deemed it necessary to move to a summer competition to attract more players.

State Representative Teams are sent to the Australasian Championships every year with Men's senior and Minors and Women's Teams competing.
