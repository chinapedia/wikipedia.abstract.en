NORTHERN SOTHO (_Sesotho sa Leboa_), also known by the name of its standardised dialect version SEPEDI (or PEDI) is a Bantu language spoken primarily in South Africa, where it is one of the 11 official languages. According to the 2011 census it was the first language of 4,618,576 people in South Africa, principally in the provinces of Limpopo, Gauteng and Mpumalanga.[1]


Classification

Northern Sotho is one of the Sotho languages of the Bantu family.

Although Northern Sotho shares the name _Sotho_ with Southern Sotho, the two groups have less in common with each other than they have with Setswana.

Northern Sotho is also closely related to Setswana, sheKgalagari and siLozi. It is a standardised dialect, amalgamating several distinct varieties or dialects.

Until recently, _Lobedu_ (also _Khilovedu_ or _Khelobedu_) used to exist only in an unwritten form, and the standard Northern Sotho language and orthography was usually used for teaching and writing by this language community. As of 2018, a Khilovedu dictionary is being compiled in addition to proper Khilovedu orthography which is also in the process of being developed.

The monarch associated with this language community is Queen Modjadji (also known as the Rain Queen). Lobedu is spoken by a majority of people in the Greater Tzaneen, Greater Letaba, and BaPhalaborwa municipalities, and a minority in Greater Giyani municipality, as well as in the Limpopo Province and Tembisa township in Gauteng. Its speakers are known as the Balobedu''.

Sepulana (also sePulane) exists in unwritten form and forms part of the standard Northern Sotho. Sepulana is spoken in Bushbuckridge area by the MaPulana people.


Confusion of nomenclature with Sepedi

Northern Sotho is often equated with the dialect it is primarily based on, Sepedi, and continued to be known as _Pedi_ or _Sepedi_ for some years after the new South African constitution appeared. However, the Pan South African Language Board and the Northern Sotho National Lexicography Unit now specifically endorse the names _Northern Sotho_ or _Sesotho sa Leboa_.

The original confusion arose from the fact that the (now official) Northern Sotho written language was based largely on the Sepedi dialect (from which missionaries first developed the orthography), but has subsequently provided a common writing system for 20 or more varieties of the Sotho-Tswana languages spoken in the former Transvaal. The name _Sepedi_ thus refers specifically to the dialect of the Pedi people, while _Northern Sotho_ refers to the official language of that name and to all the speech varieties it has been taken to cover.

The English version of the Constitution of South Africa refers to the language as "Sepedi".[2] Its official translation into the language refers to it as "Sesotho sa Leboa" in the article about languages, but as "Sepedi" on the front page.[3]


Other varieties of Northern Sotho

Apart from the Sepedi dialect itself, other languages or dialects covered by the term "Northern Sotho" appear to be a diverse grouping of communal speech-forms within the Sotho-Tswana group. They are apparently united by the fact that they are classifiable neither as Southern Sotho nor as Tswana.[4]

Very little published information is available on these other dialects of Northern Sotho, but these have been reported:

-   kheLobedu (khiLobedu or seLobedu)
-   seTlokwa
-   seBirwa
-   sePulana
-   seKhutswe
-   seTswapo
-   SePai (transitional between Sotho-Tswana and Zulu/Swati)
-   Sebididi (Sotho/Tswana) spoken in Setateng
-   Phahladira
-   Ga-Monyeki
-   Abbotspoort
-   Thabo Mbeki villages and surrounding farms north-east of the coal mining town Lephalale (formerly Ellisras)

The morphological and possible lexical variation among these dialects has led to the above assertion that 'Northern Sotho' is no more than a holding category for otherwise unclassified Sotho-Tswana varieties spoken in north-eastern South Africa. Maho (2002) leaves SePhalaborwa and the "East Sotho" varieties of SeKutswe, SePai, and SePulana unclassified within Sotho–Tswana. Their precise classification would appear to be a matter for further research.


Writing system

Northern Sotho is written in the Latin alphabet. The letter _š_ is used to represent the sound [] ("sh" is used in the trigraph "tsh" to represent an aspirated _ts_ sound). The circumflex accent can be added to the letters e and o to distinguish their different sounds, but it is mostly used in language reference books. Some word prefixes, especially in verbs, are written separately from the stem.[5]

: Northern Sotho consonants

Within nasal consonant compounds, the first nasal consonant sound is recognized as syllabic. Words such as _nthuša_ "help me", are pronounced as . /n/ can also be pronounced as following a velar consonant.[6]

Urban varieties of Northern Sotho, such as Pretoria Sotho (actually a derivative of Tswana), have acquired clicks in an ongoing process of such sounds spreading from Nguni languages.[7]
