Series overview


Episodes

Series 1 (2016)

Writing on the series began in February 2015 with principal photography commencing 29 June and wrapping in mid-August. The show was shot entirely on location due to no studio space being available in the UK. "But you can just be completely mobile now, and set up a video village anywhere", explained Ullman to Televisual magazine.[4] A sketch featuring Ullman playing Cilla Black was filmed and scrapped after the star's untimely death in August 2015.[5] Audience screenings and recordings took place in September 2015 at BBC Radio Theatre.[6]

Series one received generally favourable reviews from critics.[7][8][9][10][11][12][13] Metacritic rated the series 70/100 based on 7 reviews.[14] Several critics chided the BBC's decision to give the show a 'graveyard' time slot. Ullman contended that she didn't believe there was "appointment TV" anymore, and that people could watch whenever they wanted on catch up.[15]

Series 2 (2017)

The BBC announced that the programme had been recommissioned for a second series on 5 March 2016. In a press release, Ullman stated: "It has been a pleasure being back at the BBC, and I am thrilled to get the opportunity to write more shows with my brilliant team. The warm reception from the British public has meant a lot to me personally. I want to thank them and let Dame Judi Dench and Chancellor Angela Merkel know I couldnâ€™t have done it without you girls. Here's to season two."[16]

Filming on series 2 began on 27 June 2016 and wrapped on 19 August.[17][18] On 2 July, BBC Comedy released a clip of Ullman made up as Angela Merkel reacting to the news that Boris Johnson had chosen not to run for Prime Minister.[19] Comedian Ben Miller was confirmed as a guest star for a sketch in which he will play media mogul Rupert Murdoch with Ullman portraying wife and former model Jerry Hall.[20] Audience screenings of the new sketches took place at BBC Radio Theatre on 10, 11 September and 31 October.[21]

According to the _Radio Times_, Ullman is set to impersonate SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, 'who will played like a Bond villain, living in a Tartan Lair with a white Scottie dog on her lap,' as well as an "eerily accurate" Clare Balding.[22] English impressionist Luke Kempner was revealed to be joining the series. Impersonations of tennis pro Andy Murray and actor Simon Pegg impersonated by Kempner are expected to appear in the show's second series.[23]

Brexit plays a part in the show's storyline. "This series, we wrote some material for the Angela Merkel character, but then two days before shooting we had the Brexit vote, which sidelined a lot of that material. So we had to do some very quick rewriting and produced a song about how she feels all alone now."[24] "It made it better, more poignant", says Ullman.[25]

Unlike series 1, each episode of series 2 opens with a parody of a BBC show before the opening title sequence.

A sketch involving Christian discrimination was lauded by Christian commentators.[26] A sketch which turns the tables on victim blaming in sexual assault cases received international critical acclaim after it went viral on social media (even in China).[27][28][29] The sketch was viewed over 32 million times.[30]

Series 3 (2018)

This series takes a more topical tone with Ullman's impersonations of world leaders taking center stage. No longer is the show set in Great Britain but on the global stage. Sketches produced for the reformatted show _Tracey Breaks the News_ are utilised for this series.
