Career

Karting

Beckmann began karting in 2008, collecting major karting wins in 2009, 2012 and 2014. He remained in karting until 2014.

Formula 4

In 2015, Beckmann graduated to single seaters in ADAC Formula 4 and Italian F4, racing with M端cke Motorsport. He ended the seasons fourth in Italian F4 and fifth in ADAC Formula 4, as well as taking the rookie championship in the latter.

FIA European Formula 3 Championship

In December 2015, it was announced Beckmann would graduate to European Formula 3 for 2016, whilst continuing his collaboration with M端cke.[1] On account of his age, Beckmann was forced to miss the first two rounds of the season, making his debut at the third round at Pau. Nonetheless, Beckmann claimed a fastest lap and two podiums to finish seventh in the Rookie Championship and fifteenth overall. For 2017, Beckmann continued to race in European Formula 3, but switched to Van Amersfoort Racing.[2] After three rounds where he failed to score a point with the outfit, Beckmann made a mid-season change to Motopark.[3]
