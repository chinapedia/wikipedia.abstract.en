The WE MEANING YOU TOUR was a twenty-five date North American and European tour by the Australian singer Sia,[1] in support of her We Are Born album .[2][3] The 10 Aprilâ€“ 27 May 2010 shows included a performance at the Roundhouse in London, which was later released through Concert Live.[4] Furler band included Sam Dixon (bass), Tim Vanderkuil (guitar), Joe Kennedy (keyboards) and Felix Bloxsom (drums).[5]

The first show at the Commodore Ballroom in Vancouver was cut short when the singer suffered from heat exhaustion, and left the stage after an aborted rendition of "Be Good to Me".[6][7] The performance of "I Go To Sleep" during the Portland show was described as "swirling, and gently smoldering, something that allowed Sia to let her voice to shine in all its glory".[8]

The setlist featured a selection of new songs from the album set for a June release, such as "Clap Your Hands" and older tracks. It also included the covers "Oh Father" and "I Go to Sleep".[9] A review of the opening night of the European tour remarked that the "actual musical performance [was] decidedly fantastic" while noting the song "Breathe Me" which had been used in prolific advert for the company Nykredit.[10] A reviewer of the well-attended concert in Brussels found a well-balanced setlist and praised the vocal gymnastics,[11] while technical issues resulted in a muted performance in Utrecht.[12]
