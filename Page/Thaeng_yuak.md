Banana_stalk_carving_(finish).jpg THAI BANANA STALK CARVING or _THAENG YUAK_ (_แทงหยวก_, from _Tang_ meaning "stab or carving", and _Yuak_ mean "Banana stalk") is the Thai local art of carving the banana stalk for temporary decoration in funerals and cultural events such as religious ceremonies and ordination ceremonies. It is categorized as the _fresh material carving_ section in the main 10 Thai art skills (_ช่างสิบหมู่_)[1] although the population of _thaeng yuak_ artists is very low compared to other art skills sections.

_Thaeng yuak_ is a carving art that was popular in the lower part of central Thailand such as Phetchaburi and Ayutthaya province but most information about _thaeng yuak_ art has been saved in Phetchaburi community more than it has been in other provinces.[2] The main purpose of Banana Stalk Carving is to decorate the bier and funeral area.[3] Also, _thaeng yuak_ is made by the very skillful artists and the people who want to respect the dead. In the other words, it is used for royal funerals, as well as those of well-known monks, remarkable people and important people. However, the popularity of _thaeng yuak_ has reduced since the new culture has become more interesting to the youth.


History

King_RamaIV_coronation.jpg The history of _thaeng yuak_ is still unclear because the date and the first province where _thaeng yuak_ was invented are not recorded. There is a little information that could be used to estimate the timeline of it. Yet, the only information that could state the oldest period of _thaeng yuak_ is the Thai poem name Khun Chang Khun Phaen. It is the epic poem that was written in the Ayutthaya period (in the middle of 17th century). In the Khun Chang Kun Phaen poem, _thaeng yuak_ is mentioned in the Funeral of Wan Tong chapter when Khun Phaen ( the main character) decided to arrange the formal funeral for Wan Tong, one of his lovers.

Furthermore, in the 19th century, _thaeng yuak_ art was a very common carving art in many provinces. There is a record that said almost every high monk in Phetchaburi can perform _thaeng yuak_ art which it would be used for Buddhist festivals. More importantly, the important property of a banana stalk is fire resistant:.[4] Banana is the plant that has volume of water inside the vessel, therefore people in the past discovered it and used it to protect the bier from the fire. This knowledge has passed through generations and becomes an art at the end.

Moreover, _thaeng yuak_ was meant to add more _attractive elements_ to the funeral state, the shelter and also decorate the stand for a bier, called "_Mae Ru_".[5] Mae Ru is a decorated stand or a shelter for the bier usually used in important or high class funerals. Therefore, it is very difficult to has Mea Ru in other city rather than in capital city. However, Mea Ru is very popular in countryside like Phetchaburi and became the tradition of the city. The Mea Ru of Phetchaburi is unique. The reason is It is made in the same scale as high class Mea Ru, and it will be decorated with _thaeng yuak_.[6] In addition, the bier is decorated by _thaeng yuak_ on the edge and corners. Because of its beauty and delicate carving, King Rama IV (1851 A.D - 1868 A.D) decided to established _thaeng yuak_ as the treasure of country.

Unfortunately, in the past, the book or picture of this art was very hard to find in public. To be more specific, the master of _thaeng yuak_ usually kept their technique only for their students and taught them by experience and did some workshop rather than a book. Therefore, there are many missing pieces of evidence and timeline in _thaeng yuak_ history. However, new generations of _thaeng yuak_ artists have begun to share their knowledge with the public more in order to preserve the culture and art. The master of _thaeng yuak_ also supports these new artists by giving them the guiding and original technique which able to fill the gap of _thaeng yuak_ timeline.

Pattern styles

Because _thaeng yuak_ is the art that bonds with the daily life of people and used it in many religious festivals and becomes the culture of local people. The art has been influenced by the lifestyle of people and creates their own unique pattern. The pattern styles are based on the ideal of beauty in Thai art such as Kranok pattern (_ลายกระหนก_). Some patterns has lost by the change of new lifestyle but the others have been saved by the tradition and some new generations. Therefore, the old pattern will be saved and survive through the time. They are similar to Thai traditional style such as Kra nok pattern but the detail is not as rich as the normal pattern. _Thaeng yuak_ is the art that uses fresh plants as the material, therefore it must be done in a day before it would rot. There are 7 main patterns for _thaeng yuak_:[8]

1) 1ST HERRINGBONE PATTERN or "_Fun Nung_ pattern (_ลายฟันหนึ่ง_)"in Thai (_Fun_ or _ฟัน_ in this case, it means herringbone, _Nung_ or หนึ่ง means one or the first ) – it is the basic beginner pattern

2) 3RD HERRINGBONE PATTERN or "_Fun Sarm pattern_ (_ลายฟันสาม_)" in Thai (_Sarm_ or _สาม_ mean three or the third) – very common pattern for all _thaeng yuak_ artists

3) 5TH HERRINGBONE PATTERN or "_Fun Ha pattern_ (_ลายฟันห้า_)" in Thai (_Ha_ or _ห้า_ mean five or the fifth) – the pattern is bigger than the 3rd Herringbone pattern which makes it can’t split into two equal pieces, therefore it will have some decoration instead.

A) THE MIXING PATTERN - the _1st, 3rd_, and _5th Herringbone patterns_ can be combined together to create 2 layers of patterns but they usually combine only 2 styles together. For example, _1st_ and _3rd Herringbone patterns_, the _1st Herringbone_ will be the first layer and then place _3rd Herringbone_ at the back. Or _5th Herringbone_ combine together which they will create the 2 layers of _5th Herringbone pattern_.

4) TIGER CALF PATTERN ( "_ลายน่องสิงห์_", _Nong Sing pattern_, _น่อง_ or _Nong_ means calf and _สิงห์_ or _Sing_ means tiger ) is the basic pattern used on the pole or edge of a bier or Mea ru.

5) NA KRA DARN PATTERN (_ลายหน้ากระดาน_) or front board pattern (_ลายหน้ากระดาน_, _หน้า_ means front and _กระดาน_ means board) is the pattern used on top, middle and floor areas of a bier.

6) SAO PATTERN (_ลายเสา_) or pole pattern (_ลายเสา_,_เสา_ mean pole) is a very important pattern for every _thaeng yuak_ artist. This pattern is the freestyle area where artists can design it by themselves. The pattern can be any shape or picture depending on the maker.

7) KRA JUNG PATTERN (_ลายกระจัง_) is the extra part, it is used to decorate 1st herringbone and 3rd herringbone pattern but it is usually on top and middle part of a bier because the pattern is pointing downward.
