STAND UP AMERICA is a 501(c)(4) non-profit organization founded in the weeks after the 2016 U.S. presidential election to resist Donald Trump's agenda . It began as a Facebook community started by Sean Eldridge, which grew to over a million people, and evolved into a national advocacy campaign focused on resisting Trump's alleged corruption , ties to Russia , and his legislative agenda.[1][2]

Stand Up America was part of the People's Defense Coalition, which tried to block the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.[3][4] The group helped organize the national Tax March on April 15, 2017, which called for the release of Trump's tax returns.[5] and in May 2017, the group launched a national campaign demanding an independent investigation into Trump's ties to Russia.[6] The group supports the "Not One Penny" campaign, a campaign opposing tax cuts for the wealthy.[7]
