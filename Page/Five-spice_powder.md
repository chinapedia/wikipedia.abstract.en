FIVE-SPICE POWDER () is a spice mixture of five or more spices used predominantly in almost all branches of Chinese cuisines and also used less commonly in other Asian[1] and Arabic cuisines.

Five-spice powder can be used in cocktails.

While there are many variants, a common mix is:[2]

-   Star anise (_bā jiǎo_ 八角)
-   Cloves (_dīng xiāng_ 丁香)
-   Chinese cinnamon (_ròu guì_ 肉桂)
-   Sichuan pepper (_huā jiāo_ 花椒)
-   Fennel seeds (_xiǎo huí xiāng_ 小茴香)

Other recipes may contain anise seed, ginger root, nutmeg, turmeric, _Amomum villosum_ pods (砂仁), _Amomum cardamomum_ pods (白豆蔻), licorice, Mandarin orange peel or galangal.

In Southern China, _Cinnamomum loureiroi_ and Mandarin orange peel are commonly used as substitutes for _Cinnamomum cassia_ and cloves respectively, producing a slightly different flavour profile for southern five-spice powders.


Use

Five spice may be used with fatty meats such as pork, duck or goose. It is used as a spice rub for chicken, duck, pork and seafood, in red cooking recipes, or added to the breading for fried foods.[3] Five spice is used in recipes for Cantonese roasted duck, as well as beef stew. It is used as a marinade for Vietnamese broiled chicken. The five-spice powder mixture has followed the Chinese diaspora and has been incorporated into other national cuisines throughout Asia.

In Hawaii, some restaurants place a shaker of the spice on each patron's table. A seasoned salt can be easily made by dry-roasting common salt with five-spice powder under low heat in a dry pan until the spice and salt are well mixed.
