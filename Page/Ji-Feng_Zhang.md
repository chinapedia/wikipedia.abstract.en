Research areas

Zhang’s current research interests are system identification, adaptive control, stochastic systems, and multi-agent systems.

System identification

He made original contributions on system identification, including the estimation of the orders, time-delays and parameters of stochastic systems. He gave a criterion for time-delay estimate, with which one can get a strong consistent time-delay estimate. He with co-authors initiated the research on the parameter identification and adaptive control of the systems with quantized observations, and investigated the optimal adaptive control and identification errors, time complexity, optimal input design, and impact of disturbances and unmodeled dynamics on identification accuracy and complexity in both stochastic and deterministic frameworks. With a series of significant results, he has established a solid framework for the identification and adaptive control of uncertainty systems with quantized information. This is of great importance for many practical systems, especially, when digital communications are needed.

Adaptive control

He investigated the capability issues of robust and adaptive control in dealing with uncertainty, and revealed that to capture the intrinsic limitations of adaptive control, it is necessary to use sup-types of transient and persistent performance, rather than limsup-types which reflect only asymptotic behavior of a system. This indicates that intimate interaction and inherent conflict between identification and control result in a certain performance lower bound which does not approach the nominal performance even when the system varies very slowly. For nonlinear hybrid stochastic systems with unknown jump-Markov parameters, he with co-authors used the Wonham nonlinear filter to estimate the unknown parameters and presented an estimation error bound, which is a basic tool and plays an important role in performance analysis of adaptive control of nonlinear hybrid stochastic systems. He also attacked a series of hard problems related on global output-feedback control of nonlinear stochastic systems with inverse dynamics, including practical output-feedback risk-sensitive control, robust adaptive stabilization, small-gain theorem of general nonlinear stochastic systems. Different from the existing literature, the systems considered in his work are so complicated that renders any control design for them is much difficult. He developed a set of predominant methods and obtained many innovative results. The work represents an accomplishment for both the field of stochastic nonlinear stabilization and the backstepping method.

Stochastic multi-agent systems

In control of stochastic multi-agent systems, Zhang thoroughly studied the interaction of interest coupled decision-makers and the uncertainty of individual behavior, which is the prominent characteristic of multi-agent systems (MASs). He made a systematic study of the sample path behavior of the closed-loop system in relation to Nash Equilibria (NE) and a substantial contribution to the developing theory of Nash Certainty Equivalence (NCE) for large population stochastic dynamic games. He introduced the concepts of asymptotic Nash- equilibrium in probability and almost surely, and elucidated the relationship between these concepts, which provides necessary tools for analyzing the optimality of the decentralized control laws. With respect to the decentralized quadratic-type and tracking-type performance indices, by using Nash Certainty Equivalence he developed decentralized optimal controls, and proved the optimality of the closed-loop systems. He also initiated the study on consensusability and formability of MAS and obtained necessary and sufficient conditions which reflect the intrinsic relationships between the consensusability/formability and the agents’ dynamics, admissible control sets and communication topologies. These works are of great significance, since they break through the framework of conventional control theory and extend the methodology and tools in the stochastic adaptive control theory to analyzing MAS.

Index-coupled example

The multi-agent system Zhang mentioned could be used to describe an engineering or economic system. The uncertainty in his work is a kind of random noise appearing in the agent’s dynamic model. Brownian agent swarm systems are such examples, where the acceleration of agent depends on not only its own state variables (e.g. position, velocity, and energy), control, Gaussian white noise, but also the population position average. The dynamic equations are coupled together via the population position average. Other interest or performance index-coupled examples can be found in wireless communication networks and stock markets. In a wireless communication network with users, the changing rate of the received power for user depends on, its neighbors’ powers, control, random noise. Each user makes its own power control strategy to ensure the signal-to- interference-ratio to approach a desired level. This can be formulated by the following model (for simplicity, here we use a linear model with constant parameters) and a coupled-index group: where is the neighbor of user, are system parameters, is the constant background noise intensity, and. In a stock market with investigators, suppose that profits of each investigator is influenced by his recent profits situation and the profits situation of his neighbors, and each investigator wants to get something around the average value. Then, the problem can be described by the following model (for simplicity, here we use a linear model with constant parameters) and a coupled-interest index group: When a=1 and b=0, the coupled-interest index becomes.[6][7][8][9]
