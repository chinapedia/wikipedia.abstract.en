Early years

Born in Villamayor de Calatrava, province of Ciudad Real, Casimiro had a very short career as a basketball player.


Coaching career

Casimiro started coaching CB Puertollano, and other Castilian-Manchegan teams, before joining CB Breogán in 1993, as an assistant coach of Ricardo Hevia in the Liga ACB.

In 1993, Casimiro managed Gandía BA, of the Spanish second-tier level, in his first professional experience as a head coach.

Five years later, Casimiro managed TDK Manresa to win the 1997–98 Liga ACB, which is considered to be one of the biggest miracles in the history of Spanish professional club basketball.[1]

After leaving Manresa, Casimiro continued coaching in Spain, in different teams of the Liga ACB and LEB Oro.

In 2002, Casimiro ended up as a runner-up of the Saporta Cup, with Pamesa Valencia. The team was defeated by Montepaschi Siena in the league's final game.

Three years later, he managed Baloncesto Fuenlabrada to achieve a league promotion to the Liga ACB, by winning the 2004–05 LEB. With this title, Casimiro became the first coach to ever win the Liga ACB and the LEB.[2]

On 25 September 2016, Casimiro led Herbalife Gran Canaria to win the 2016 Spanish Supercup title, its first ever national title.[3] In the 2017–18 season, Casimiro reached the ACB semi-finals with Gran Canaria. With this achievement, the team also qualified for the next EuroLeague season, the club's first participation ever. On 13 June 2018, Gran Canaria announced the club and Casimiro separated ways.[4]
