Image_of_Community-led_housing_project_Saffron_Acres_in_Leicester_UK.jpg COMMUNITY-LED HOUSING is where people and communities play a leading role in addressing their own housing needs. The route taken depends on things like the nature of the demand, available resources, location and type of activity. Approaches encompass new build, regeneration and the use of existing buildings. Community-led housing groups may form on the basis of a geographical connection or something else they have in common (e.g. older people, LGBT groups etc.). There is no definitive definition of the term, yet there have been attempts to provide clarity by identifying key principles which underpin all community-led housing activity.[1]


Community-led housing in the UK

In the UK, community-led housing currently constitutes less than 1% of housing stock.[2] There have been attempts to stimulate increased growth, with mixed results.[3] The most commonly known forms of community-led housing include: community land trusts,[4] housing cooperatives, self–build,[5] cohousing,[6] and self-help housing.[7] A range of legal models are in use in the UK to enable the delivery of community-led schemes. There is currently no legal definition of community-led housing. A draft definition[8] was developed and presented for discussion in the House of Lords in March 2016 in relation to the Housing and Planning Act, where it was not progressed.[9]

Key principles

In 2016 key principles for community-led housing were developed collaboratively with several organisations representing community-led housing as part of an alliance building activity coordinated by Building and Social Housing Foundation (BSHF).[20][21]

The key principles are:[22]

-   The community is integrally involved throughout the process in key decisions like what is provided, where, and for who. They don't necessarily have to initiate the conversation, or build homes themselves.
-   There is a presumption that the community group will take a long term formal role in the ownership, stewardship or management of the homes.
-   The benefits of the scheme to the local area and/or specified community group are clearly defined and legally protected in perpetuity.

Individual schemes are designed to fit the needs of the communities involved and achieve specific outcomes and wider benefits.[23]


Benefits

Identified benefits of community-led housing include:

-   Increased community confidence and cohesion: These are developed through the opportunity for the community to work together to influence their housing as formal stakeholders.[24][25]
-   Skills development and employment: This can include the development of practical skills that help to develop the homes, such as plastering, plumbing and tiling. It can also include skills such as project management and community mobilisation in the planning of homes.[26]
-   Addressing social challenges: Community-led housing projects can help to address social problems such as homelessness and loneliness. For example, certain projects help to tackle the challenges of supporting an elderly population.[27][28][29]
-   Provision for a long-term legally protected benefit to the local or specified community via retained income from the housing provided.[30]
