SADIE SINK (born April 16, 2002) is an American actress. She portrays Maxine "Max" Mayfield in Netflix’s _Stranger Things_[1] and has also appeared in _Blue Bloods_ and _The Americans_.[2] Sink has also worked on Broadway, with credits including _Annie_ and _The Audience_.[3]


Life and career

Sink was born in Brenham, Texas. She has three older brothers and a younger sister.

Due to her obsession with recreating Disney’s _High School Musical_ with her brother, Mitchell, when she was seven years old, her mother decided to send her off to acting classes in a community theatre, in nearby Houston. In turn, it led to a Broadway audition and a role in the 2012 revival of _Annie_ at the age of eleven years old. She had to prepare herself for the role by taking dance lessons and doing vocal training. She was initially the standby for all the orphans, until the original lead left, when she began alternating the title role for a few months, then closing the show as Duffy and understudy to Annie.

While still starring in the play, she appeared in the Emmy-winning series _The Americans_.

In 2015, she co-starred with Helen Mirren in _The Audience_ on Broadway, as young Queen Elizabeth II. She also had a small role in _Chuck_.[4]

While filming the drama movie _The Glass Castle_, she became very close with Woody Harrelson, and particularly with his daughter, Makani. She was already a vegetarian, but Harrelson and his family inspired her to go vegan.[5]

In 2017, she played Maxine "Max" Mayfield in the Netflix original _Stranger Things_. In December, she was added to the cast of the horror film _Eli_, starring Charlie Shotwell.[6]
