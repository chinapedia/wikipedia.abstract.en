NAP EYES is a Canadian indie rock band from Halifax, Nova Scotia.[1] The band consists of vocalist Nigel Chapman, guitarist Brad Loughead, bassist Josh Salter and drummer Seamus Dalton.[2]


History

Formed in 2011 when Salter and Dalton joined Chapman's existing solo project The Mighty Northumberland,[3] the band released its debut album _Whine of the Mystic_ independently in 2014.[4] The album was rereleased in 2015 on You've Changed Records in Canada and Paradise of Bachelors in the United States.[5]

The band's second album, _Thought Rock Fish Scale_, with songs delivered in a slow, psychadelic and meditative style,[6] was released in 2016 on both labels.[7] The album was supported by a concert tour of dates in both Canada and the United States,[8] an appearance on CBC Radio's _Q_[9] and a follow-up tour of select dates in Europe.[10] In June 2016, the album was named to the longlist for the 2016 Polaris Music Prize.[11]

Nap Eyes' third album, _I'm Bad Now_, was released in 2018.[12] The songs showed the band's move to a more uptempo style.[13]
