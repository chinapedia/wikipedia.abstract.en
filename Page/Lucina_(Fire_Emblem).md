is a fictional character and one of the protagonists from Intelligent Systems's 2012 role-playing video game _Fire Emblem Awakening_, part of their overarching _Fire Emblem_ series of video games. Her popularity later led to her inclusion in several other video games, including Intelligent System's 2015 title _Code Name: S.T.E.A.M._, Nintendo's crossover fighting game _Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS_ and _Wii U_, Capcom's _Monster Hunter Frontier G_, and Bandai Namco's crossover RPG _Project X Zone 2_. Lucina would again appear in future _Fire Emblem_ titles as well, including _Fire Emblem Fates_, _Fire Emblem Heroes_, and _Fire Emblem Warriors_, though in more of a supporting role rather than a protagonist with the latter titles.


History and appearances

In _Fire Emblem Awakening_

Lucina originates from the Nintendo and Intelligent Systems video game _Fire Emblem Awakening_, an entry in their long-running _Fire Emblem_ series of video games. Internally, _Awakening_ was treated as a last-ditch effort to save the series, as declining sales had led Nintendo to deem it the last game series if the game did not meet sales goals. Lucina was part of the team's efforts to rework the series' arch-typical medieval fantasy setting and revamping it using elements of time-travel; Lucina travels backward in time from a world in ruins to help her father, Chrom, work towards a different future.[1] Lucina's mother is dependent on the player's choices in the game's relationship and marriage system, another revamped system for the game.<ref name"ecunews1"> Early parts in the game see her dressing up as Marth, the protagonist from a number of earlier _Fire Emblem_ titles.[2] Nintendo described her in the game as "an unwavering warrior with a strong sense of justice and commitment to her family...Her power, determination, and wisdom gained from watching the destruction of her world are priceless strengths."[3] Lucina and the rest of the cast were cited as standout aspects of the game that helped in saving the series; _Awakening_ posted strong sales in multiple regions and allowed Nintendo to greenlight further entries in the series.[4]

In other media

Lucina later appeared in _Awakening's_ follow up, _Fire Emblem Fates_, though only as an additional downloadable content (DLC) character, not a core character to the game's story.[5] She is also a playable character in Nintendo's mobile entry in the series, _Fire Emblem Heroes_,[6] and _Fire Emblem Warriors_, a Tecmo Koei developed _musou_ action game spin-off.[7] Tecmo Koei originally wanted to drop her from the game's story, citing both issues with her time-travelling backstory conflicting with the new story they were trying to tell in the game, and the perception that there were already too many sword-bearing characters unbalancing the game's gameplay.[8] This idea was rejected by Intelligent Systems and Nintendo, deeming her too important to the franchise to be cut from the game.[9]

Outside of the _Fire Emblem_ series, Lucina was also included in a number of other Nintendo-related games, including the _Super Smash Bros._ crossover fighting game series. Lucina was a playable character in 2014's _Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U_ as part of the game's core fighting cast, using moves similar to Marth's.[10][11] Around the same time, she also received her own Amiibo figure from Nintendo.[12] She also appears in the series' 2018 entry, _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_, now designated as Marth's "echo fighter".[13] She is also playable in the 2016 tactical role-playing crossover game _Project X Zone 2_, appearing as part of a pair unit with her father Chrom.[14] A downloadable addition to the Japan-only _Monster Hunter Frontier G_ allowed for the player to dress their avatar as Lucina in the game's Wii U version.[15] Lucina is featured as a bonus playable character in _Code Name: S.T.E.A.M._, where she is made playable upon the player linking their Amiibo with the game.[16]

Lucina also received her own figure in Good Smile Company's figma line in 2014.[17]


Reception

The character of Lucina has received positive attention from journalists as part of Nintendo's efforts to better appeal to the female demographics of video gaming.[18][19] Nintendo used her as one of their female characters used to recreate the Rosie the Riveter We Can Do It poster as part of the company's Women's History Month celebration in March 2015,[20] with her being one of the few characters used who was not criticized by journalists for being a damsel in distress, oversexualized, or merely a female version of a male character.[21][22] Other journalists praised her inclusion as part of Nintendo's efforts to have more female character in games, including her starring role in _Fire Emblem Awakening_,[23] and the increased percentage of female characters in the roster for _Super Smash Bros for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U_. While The Mary Sue initially resented the fact that the initial trailer for her revealed appearance in _Super Smash Bros._ led to Lucina, a female, having to be rescued by Robin, a male, the concern was later retracted upon the realization that the Robin character can be chosen to be male or female in the game itself.[24] In _Fire Emblem_ character popularity polls running up to the release of _Fire Emblem Heroes_, Lucina was ranked number 2 in the female character polls in North America.[25] The top four characters in the polls received new in-game costumes; Kotaku praised both Lucina's original costume, and the revised one, for striking a good balance between looking stylish while still appearing to look like traditionally functional armor as well.[26]

As a fighter in _Super Smash Bros._ specifically, her inclusion was generally well-received, although her initial reveal lead to concerns that she was too similar in playing style to Marth, in a game series that stresses that each character be different in play-style.[27] The director of _Super Smash Bros._, Masahiro Sakurai, addressed the concern directly and stated that there were enough differences in balance and size to warrant her being a separate character.[28][29] With seven total _Fire Emblem_ characters appearing in _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_, complaints again arose that she played too similarly to other characters.[30]
