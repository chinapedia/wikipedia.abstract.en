The origins of the COLLECTORS CLUB OF CHICAGO (CCC) are traced to the informal meetings during the 1920s of specialized collectors residing in the local area.

The CCC was incorporated in accordance with the General Not For Profit Corporation Act on 13 October 1928 in the State of Illinois, with nine members being named directors and with meetings being conducted in members' homes.

Meetings continued at members' homes until World War II, at which time the meetings lapsed. On Sunday, 26 November 1944, a reorganization meeting of the then-charter-named "Chicago Collectors Club" was held at the home of Maj. Max G. Johl. Today's CCC is the result of that reorganization effort.

In 1967, CCC member Richard McPherren Cabeen offered the Collectors Club of Chicago his four-level brownstone home, located in Chicago's downtown "Gold Coast" area at 1029 North Dearborn Street. The Cabeen offer was accepted, and the building has served as the CCC Clubhouse since that time.

Because of the foresight of the Chicago-area's philatelic fraternity during the formative years, the current CCC membership enjoys the privileges and benefits of a permanent clubhouse building, a comprehensive philatelic library:[1] and the opportunity to socialize monthly or more frequently with fellow collectors having similar interests.

Membership in the Collectors Club of Chicago is by invitation only and is ratified by current membership.[2]
