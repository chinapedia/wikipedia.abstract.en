The INDO-IRANIAN LANGUAGES (INDO-IRANIC LANGUAGES[1][2]), or ARYAN LANGUAGES[3] constitute the largest and southeasternmost extant branch of the Indo-European language family. It has more than 1.5 billion speakers, stretching from Europe (Romani), Turkey (Kurdish and Zaza–Gorani) and the Caucasus (Ossetian) eastward to Xinjiang (Sarikoli) and Assam (Assamese), and south to Sri Lanka (Sinhala) and the Maldives (Maldivian). Furthermore, there are large communities of Indo-Iranian speakers in northwestern Europe (the United Kingdom), North America (United States and Canada), and Australia.

The common ancestor of all of the languages in this family is called Proto-Indo-Iranian—also known as Common Aryan—which was spoken in approximately the late 3rd millennium BC. The three branches of the modern Indo-Iranian languages are Indo-Aryan, Iranian, and Nuristani. Additionally, sometimes a fourth independent branch, Dardic, is posited, but recent scholarship in general places Dardic languages as archaic members of the Indo-Aryan branch.[4]


Languages

The Indo-Iranian languages consist of three groups:

-   Indo-Aryan languages
-   Iranian/Iranic
-   Nuristani

Indo-Iranian languages are spoken by more than 1.5 billion people. The languages with the most speakers are a part of the Indo-Aryan group: Hindustani (Hindi/Urdu), (~590 million[5]), Bengali (205 million[6]), Punjabi (100 million), Marathi (75 million), Gujarati (50 million), Bhojpuri (40 million), Awadhi (40 million), Maithili (35 million), Odia (35 million), Marwari (30 million), Sindhi (25 million), Assamese (24 million), Rajasthani (20 million), Chhattisgarhi (18 million), Sinhala (19 million), Nepali (17 million), Bishnupuriya (12 million)[7] and Rangpuri (15 million). Among the Iranian branch, major languages are Persian (60 million), Pashto (ca. 50 million), Kurdish (35 million),[8] and Balochi (8 million). There are also many smaller languages.


History

The common proto-language of the Indo-Iranian languages is Proto-Indo-Iranian, which has been reconstructed.

The oldest attested Indo-Iranian languages are Vedic Sanskrit, Older and Younger Avestan and Old Persian (ancient Iranian languages). A few words from another Indo-Aryan language (see Indo-Aryan superstrate in Mitanni) are attested in documents from the ancient Mitanni and Hittite kingdoms in the Near East.


Features

Innovations shared with other languages affected by the satem sound changes include:

-   Fronting and assibilation of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) palato-velar stops:
-   The merger of the PIE labiovelar and plain velar stops:
-   The Ruki sound law

Innovations shared with Greek include:

-   The vocalization of the PIE syllabic nasals to (may be independent developments)
-   Grassmann's law (may be independent developments)

Innovations unique to Indo-Iranian include:

-   The lowering of PIE to
    -   *o was also lowered to *a, though this occurred in several other Indo-European languages as well.
-   Brugmann's law
