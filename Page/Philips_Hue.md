Security concern

A security flaw in the product was discovered and fixed, then disclosed in 2016. The bulbs were able to be remotely controlled over the Internet by simulated security engineers using inexpensive equipment. In the proof-of-concept, researchers were able to remotely control light bulbs using a nearby car or a drone flying outside a window within . However, the flaw was reported to Philips and fixed prior to being publicly revealed.[11]
