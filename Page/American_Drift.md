_AMERICAN DRIFT_ is the first studio album by American electronic musician and composer Elysia Crampton, after her previous work under the name E+E. It was released on August 7, 2015, on Blueberry Records and was released to high critical acclaim from various critics.


Background

_American Drift_, as a concept album, was created with the intent of realizing prehistoric and precolonial history in relation to African-American history and Aymara history, as well as Christian faith and ontology, which is conveyed musically through Crampton's use of relative musical influences like Southern hip hop/crunk, Bolivian and Peruvian prog, metal and psych, trival/tribal-guarachero, new age music, psychedelic folk, neo-classical music, ragtime, spirituals and early blues, as well as her brother's avant-garde records, and her grandfather's collection of huayno and cumbia tapes. She also cited relating late writer José Esteban Muñoz's writings on 'brownness' with the Earth and its prehistoric geology.[1]

In press photos for American Drift, Crampton was often depicted in forest settings, as well as holding a copy of Stacy Alaimo's _Bodily Natures: Science, Environment, and the Material Self_.[2][3]


Concept

Shenandoah_Mountain_-_High_Knob.jpg in Virginia served as a geographical and geological inspiration for _American Drift_.]] Crampton described both herself and _American Drift_ as taking a transevangelistic approach.[4] In particular, the title track, written for and spoken by her collaborator Money Allah (who also appears on "Wing"), is intended as a 'transevangelistic prayer'. Lyrically, it references Paul Claudel's "The Way of the Cross" and the Christian hymn "Rock of Ages", as well as commentary intended to conjure the transmogrification of nature.[5] "Petrichrist"'s name is a portmanteau of petrichor and Christ, and musically documents Crampton herself driving in her Ford Ranger up the Shenandoah Mountain in Virginia, intended as a depiction of 'an encounter between mountain and vehicle, interactions of non-human objects touching one another in a _Worlding_ where all things have agency.'[6] "Wing" is a two-part track based on particular cycles in prehistory; it portrays an impact event, leading into 'negative photosynthesis' and finally fern spikes;[7] the track is also dedicated to black pianist Margaret Bonds.[8] "Axacan" is named for and musically depicts the Ajacán Mission, where the first Spanish settlement in Virginia occurred violently.[9]


Composition

Next to its influences, _American Drift_ uses a distinctive 1990s/2000s-like keyboard-based musical palette, along with Hollywood-style stock sound effects including vocal bites,[10] explosions, alerts, gunshots, beeps[11] and evil laughs. These sounds are often arranged atmospherically or rhythmically in juxtaposition with the otherwise polyphonic and minimalist tone of the music, and in particular, Crampton's style of sound collages with such samples has been dubbed as "epic collage".[12] Crampton's collaborator, Money Allah, who speaks and sings on the title track and "Wing", is described as a 'thug dove';[13] on the latter track, he sings with an apparent Southern drawl.

On "Petrichrist" and "Wing", rhythm samples reminiscent of Baile funk are used along with cumbia rhythms, and on "Axacan", the track is based on a rhythm. The album is also punctuated with vocal samples and synths calling back to Southern rap and crunk, including "yup!"s and, on "Axacan", Lil Jon "yeahhh!", "what!" and "okayyy!" vocal samples which are used repetitively.[14] In correlation, the second section of "Wing" is described as a 'crunk-huayno ballad'.[15] MIDI guitars, flutes and horns[16] that appear to be played on Kurzweil and Yamaha keyboards appear throughout, as well as similarly electronic-sounding bells, chimes and ambient pads that, according to Nick James Scavo of Tiny Mix Tapes, set an Appalachian scene.[17]

Philip Sherburne, writing for Pitchfork, described American Drift as being 'like a hillside that's been worn away by erosion to reveal a sedimentary record of the millennia'.[18] He also commented on the album's use of 'woodblock rhythms', 'trap chants' and 'coruscating organs', praising them, as elements of the record, as being 'overwhelming in the best way.'[19] Nick James Scavo, writing for Tiny Mix Tapes, commented that 'the beauty of Crampton's art is that it gorgeously describes a drifting, transitional nature — to pin it down is to forget its essence, to rob it of movement.'[20] Scavo also stated that Crampton's use of distinct elements, which he picked out as on, for example, "Axacan", including 'huancayo caracols, glass piano, and Lil Jon', "evoke[s] the biologically self-queering nature of the "sublime"" and "approaches the “opening” of Crampton’s sound as a trans-ontology".[21]
