StartingBloc Institutes

StartingBloc Fellowship starts with a 5-day intensive Institute, where Fellows develop key leadership skills, join a community of over 2,500 professionals across the globe and cultivate social impact ideas.[3] Institutes have taken place in LA, Boston, DC, New Orleans, among others. Participation in the Institute requires a tuition payment of $1,500 to cover programming costs and most meals; participants must provide for their own travel and accommodations. A limited number of partial and full scholarships is available for accepted candidates on the basis of merit and financial need. In return, fellows receive access to a global network of social innovators, as well as certain benefits arranged specifically for fellows.[4] The Programming includes:

-   Transformative Action: Fellows learn about the most effective ways that citizens create social progress.
-   Polarity Mapping: Many of the issues that leaders face are not problems to be solved but polarities to be balanced.
-   Rapid Prototyping: Fellows learn about design thinking and put it into action to tackle the challenges of select local impact organizations.

Institutes bring together speakers from a range of industries, such as Scott Sherman, Executive Director of Transformative Action Institute, Robert Egger, the founder of the DC Central Kitchen & LA Kitchen, and Majora Carter, the CEO of Startup Box.
