_WANDERLUST_ is the debut studio album by Canadian atmospheric black metal band Finnr's Cane. It was released in 2010 by Frostscald Records and re-released in 2011 by Prophecy Productions. The re-release includes a demo version of the song Snowfall, one of the first tracks composed by the band.[1]

The album was recorded by The Bard at Sardonic Moon Studio in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. _WANDERLUST_ has been compared to the music of Agalloch,[2][3] Wolves in the Throne Room,[4][5] and early Ulver,[6] while maintaining a sound unique to Finnr's Cane.[7]
