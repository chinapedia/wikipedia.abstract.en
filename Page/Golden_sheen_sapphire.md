GOLDEN SHEEN SAPPHIRE, is a gemstone variety of the mineral corundum, an aluminium oxide (). It typically shows a metallic golden colour with common variations being brass, copper and bronze, however metallic blue, green and yellow colouration is also possible. A very rare variation is a metallic red colour. It has the same color, chemical properties and features as black star sapphire.

Particularly prominent is hematite which will often result in the formation of geometric hexagonal patterns within the gemstone crystal.[1]

The term 'gold sheen' or 'gold sheen effect' was first described by the GIA testing laboratory in Bangkok in 2013. Samples of the gemstone were tested to confirm they were true sapphire and the colour was described as 'brown, with gold sheen effect'.


Questions regarding evidence and claims

The Gemmological Association of Great Britain published an in-depth analysis of golden sheen sapphire in the Journal of Gemmology.[2] The Gemological Institute of Thailand published their own independent analysis.[3]

Two articles from the Journal of Gemmology state that both black star and gold sheen are high in iron and titanium oxide, which accounts for the brown/black color. They have inclusions of ilmenite, hematite (gold color) and magnetite (black). Both exhibit asterism and hexagonal growth, a lack of UV fluorescence, healed fractures and polysynthetic twinning (parallel lines). Although declared as a "new variety"[4], there remains the question of its extremely close similarity to black star sapphire, [5] [6] which comes from more than ten countries in the world. [7][8]

Gemological labs that have issued certificates categorizing golden sheen sapphire as corundum, describing the gold sheen effect as 'known in the industry as gold sheen sapphire', include: GIA, GRS, LOTUS, GIT, SSEF, AIGS, IGL.


Source

In the Journal of Gemmology (JoG)[9], it is claimed that the source is a depleted mine in Kenya close to the border of Somalia. TJN Colors, GIT and In Color [10][11][12] all state that the origin is Kenya. However, GIA Tokyo [13] and Gems and Jewellery [14] admitted in 2018 that the location is not known. GIA [15] and JoG [16] mention that there is no evidence of gemstone deposits in the flat border region near Somalia.


Optical effects

Color change

Golden Sheen Sapphire will exhibit mild to strong color change under warm, cool and direct sunlight.

Asterism

All cabochon cut Golden Sheen Sapphire will exhibit some degree of asterism.

Heating and treatment

There are no known heating or treatment methods for golden sheen sapphire. Testing of heat treatment on sample batches has resulted in diminishment of the gold sheen effect, reducing the appeal of the gemstone.


Use in jewellery

Golden sheen sapphire has been used in jewelry production by companies including

-   William Travis Jewelry

Awards

In 2016 a gold sheen sapphire ring by William Travis Jewelry won the American Gem Trade Association Savor Silver Award, Men's Wear.[17]
