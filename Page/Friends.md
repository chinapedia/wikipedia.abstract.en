The series finale aired on May 6, 2004, and was watched by around 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fifth most-watched series finale in television history,[4][5][6] and the most-watched television episode of the 2000s decade.[7][8]

_Friends_ received acclaim throughout its run, becoming one of the most popular television shows of all time.[9] The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning the Outstanding Comedy Series award in 2002[10] for its eighth season. The show ranked no. 21 on _TV Guide_{{'}}s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time,[11] and no. 7 on _Empire_ magazine's The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.[12][13] In 1997, the episode "The One with the Prom Video" was ranked 100 on _TV Guide_{{'}}s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time.[14] In 2013, _Friends_ ranked no. 24 on the Writers Guild of America's 101 Best Written TV Series of All Time,[15] and no. 28 on _TV Guide_{{'}}s 60 Best TV Series of All Time.[16]


Premise

Rachel Green flees her wedding day and finds childhood friend Monica Geller, a New York City chef. They become roommates, and Rachel joins Monica's group of single people in their mid-20s: Struggling actor Joey Tribbiani, business professional Chandler Bing, masseuse and musician Phoebe Buffay, and newly divorced palaeontologist Ross Geller, Monica's older brother. Rachel becomes a waitress at Manhattan coffee house Central Perk; when not there, the group is usually at Monica and Rachel's nearby West Village apartment, or Joey and Chandler's across the hall.

Episodes depict the friends' comedic and romantic adventures and career issues, such as Joey auditioning for roles or Rachel seeking jobs in the fashion industry. The six characters each have many dates and serious relationships, such as Monica with Richard Burke, and Ross with Emily Waltham. Ross and Rachel's intermittent relationship is the most often-recurring storyline; during the ten seasons of the show, they repeatedly date and break up. Ross briefly marries Emily. Ross and Rachel have a child together after a one-night stand, Chandler and Monica date and marry each other, and Phoebe marries Mike Hannigan. Other frequently recurring characters include Ross and Monica's parents, Jack and Judy Geller from Long Island; Ross's ex-wife, Carol, and their son, Ben; Central Perk barista Gunther; Chandler's ex-girlfriend Janice; and Phoebe's twin sister Ursula.

In their original contracts for the first season, cast members were paid $22,500 per episode.[25] The cast members received different salaries in the second season, beginning from the $20,000 range to $40,000 per episode.[26][27] Before their salary negotiations for the third season, the cast decided to enter collective negotiations, despite Warner Bros.' preference for individual deals.[28] The actors were given the salary of the least paid cast member, meaning Aniston and Schwimmer had their salaries reduced. The stars were paid $75,000 per episode in season three, $85,000 in season four, $100,000 in season five, $125,000 in season six, $750,000 in seasons seven and eight, and $1Â million in seasons nine and ten, making Aniston, Cox, and Kudrow the highest-paid TV actresses of all time.[29][30][31] The cast also received syndication royalties beginning in 2000 after renegotiations. At the time, that financial benefit of a piece of the show's lucrative back-end profits had only been given out to stars who had ownership rights in a show, like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby.[32]

Series creator David Crane wanted all six actors to be equally prominent,[33] and the series was lauded as being "the first true 'ensemble' show."[34] The cast members made efforts to keep the ensemble format and not allow one member to dominate;[35] they entered themselves in the same acting categories for awards,[36] opted for collective salary negotiations,[37] and asked to appear together on magazine cover photos in the first season.[38] The cast members also became best friends off-screen,[39] so much so that recurring guest star Tom Selleck reported that he sometimes felt left out.[40]

The cast remained good friends after the series run, most notably Cox and Aniston, with Aniston being godmother to Cox and David Arquette's daughter, Coco.[41] In the official farewell commemorative book _Friends 'Til the End_, each separately acknowledged in interviews that the cast had become their family.[42][43]

Production

Conception

David Crane and Marta Kauffman began developing three new television pilots that would premiere in 1994 after their sitcom _Family Album_ was cancelled by CBS in 1993.[44] Kauffman and Crane decided to pitch the series about "six people in their 20s making their way in Manhattan" to NBC since they thought it would fit best there.[45] Crane and Kauffman presented the idea to their production partner Kevin Bright, who had served as executive producer on their HBO series _Dream On_.[46] The idea for the series was conceived when Crane and Kauffman began thinking about the time when they had finished college and started living by themselves in New York; Kauffman believed they were looking at a time when the future was "more of a question mark."[47] They found the concept to be interesting, as they believed "everybody knows that feeling",[48] and because it was also how they felt about their own lives at the time.[49] The team titled the series _Insomnia Cafe_ and pitched the idea as a seven-page treatment to NBC in December 1993.[50][51]

At the same time, Warren Littlefield, the then-president of NBC Entertainment, was seeking a comedy involving young people living together and sharing expenses. Littlefield wanted the group to share memorable periods of their lives with friends, who had become "new, surrogate family members."[52] However, Littlefield found difficulty in bringing the concept to life and found the scripts developed by NBC to be terrible. When Kauffman, Crane and Bright pitched _Insomnia Cafe_, Littlefield was impressed that they knew who their characters were.[53] NBC bought the idea as a put pilot, meaning they risked financial penalties if the pilot was not filmed.[54] Kauffman and Crane took three days to write the pilot script for a show they titled _Friends Like Us._[55][56] Littlefield wanted the series to "represent Generation X and explore a new kind of tribal bonding", but the rest disagreed. Crane argued that it was not a series for one generation, and wanted to produce a series that everyone would enjoy watching.[57] NBC liked the script and ordered the series. They changed the title to _Six of One_, mainly because they felt _Friends Like Us_ was too similar to the ABC sitcom _These Friends of Mine_.[58]

Casting

(_pictured_) to portray Rachel, and Jennifer Aniston as Monica; However, Cox and Aniston disagreed, so Cox was cast as Monica and Aniston as Rachel]] Once it became apparent that the series was a favored project at NBC, Littlefield reported that he was getting calls from every agent in town, wanting their client to be a part of the series.[59] Auditions for the lead roles took place in New York and Los Angeles.[60] The casting director shortlisted 1,000Â actors who had applied for each role down to 75. Those who received a callback read again in front of Crane, Kauffman and Bright. At the end of March, the number of potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part, and were asked to read for Les Moonves, then-president of Warner Bros. Television.[61]

Having worked with David Schwimmer in the past,[62] the series creators wrote the character of Ross with him in mind, and he was the first actor cast.[63] Cox wanted to play the role of Monica because she liked the "strong" character, but the producers had her in mind to play Rachel because of her "cheery, upbeat energy", which was not how they envisioned Monica; after Cox's audition, though, Kauffman agreed with Cox, and she got the role.[64][65] When Matt LeBlanc auditioned for Joey, he put a "different spin" on the character.[66] He played Joey more simple-minded than intended and gave the character heart. Although Crane and Kauffman did not want LeBlanc for the role at the time, they were told by the network to cast him.[67] Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry and Lisa Kudrow were cast based on their auditions.[68]

More changes occurred to the series's storylines during the casting process. The writers found that they had to adjust the characters they had written to suit the actors, and the discovery process of the characters occurred throughout the first season. Kauffman acknowledged that Joey's character became "this whole new being", and that "it wasn't until we did the first Thanksgiving episode that we realized how much fun Monica's neuroses are."[69]

Writing

In the weeks after NBC's pick up of _Friends_, Crane, Kauffman and Bright reviewed sent-in scripts that writers had originally prepared for other series, mainly unproduced _Seinfeld_ episodes.[70] Kauffman and Crane hired a team of seven young writers because "When you're 40, you can't do it anymore. The networks and studios are looking for young people coming in out of college."[71] The creators felt that using six equal characters, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for "myriad storylines and give the show legs."[72] The majority of the storyline ideas came from the writers, although the actors added ideas.[73] Although the writers originally planned the big love story to be between Joey and Monica, the idea of a romantic interest between Ross and Rachel emerged during the period when Kauffman and Crane wrote the pilot script.[74]

During the production of the pilot, NBC requested that the script be changed to feature one dominant storyline and several minor ones, but the writers refused, wanting to keep three storylines of equal weight.[75] NBC also wanted the writers to include an older character to balance out the young ones. Crane and Kauffman were forced to comply and wrote a draft of an early episode that featured "Pat the Cop." who would be used to provide advice to the other characters. Crane found the storyline to be terrible, and Kauffman joked, "You know the book, _Pat the Bunny_? We had Pat the Cop." NBC eventually relented and dropped the idea.[76]

Each summer, the producers would outline the storylines for the subsequent season.[77] Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign.[78] The hardest episodes to write were always "the first one and the last one of each season." [79] Unlike other storylines, the idea for a relationship between Joey and Rachel was decided on halfway through the eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey's romantic interest in Rachel. The storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season's finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to Rachel's baby, as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none.[80] Crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they decided to do because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season. Kauffman and Crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even if all the cast members had wanted to continue.[81]

The episode title formatâ"The One ..."[82]âwas created when the producers realized that the episode titles would not be featured in the opening credits, and therefore would be unknown to most of the audience. Episode titles officially begin with "The One ..." except the title of the pilot episode and the series finale "The Last One."

Filming

building, 90 Bedford Street, used as the friends' apartment block in establishing shots]] The first season was shot on Stage 5 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.[83] NBC executives had worried that the coffee house setting was too hip and asked for the series to be set in a diner, but, eventually consented to the coffee house concept.[84] The opening title sequence was filmed in a fountain at the Warner Bros. Ranch at 4:00Â am, while it was particularly cold for a Burbank morning.[85] At the beginning of the second season, production moved to the larger StageÂ 24, which was renamed "The Friends Stage" after the series finale.[86] Filming for the series began during the summer of 1994 in front of a live audience, who were given a summary of the series to familiarize themselves with the six main characters;[87] a hired comedian entertained the studio audience between takes.[88] Each 22-minute episode took six hours to filmâtwice the length of most sitcom tapingsâmainly due to the several retakes and rewrites of the script.[89]

Although the producers always wanted to find the right stories to take advantage of being on location, _Friends_ was never shot in New York. Bright felt that filming outside the studio made episodes less funny, even when shooting on the lot outside, and that the live audience was an integral part of the series.[90] When the series was criticized for incorrectly depicting New York, with the financially struggling group of friends being able to afford huge apartments, Bright noted that the set had to be big enough for the cameras, lighting, and "for the audience to be able to see what's going on";[91] the apartments also needed to provide a place for the actors to execute the funny scripts.[92] The fourth-season finale was shot on location in London because the producers were aware of the series's popularity in the UK.[93] The scenes were shot in a studio with three audiences each made up of 500 people. These were the show's largest audiences throughout its run. The fifth-season finale, set in Las Vegas, was filmed at Warner Bros. Studios, although Bright met people who thought it was filmed on location.[94]


Series finale

explained, "We're like very delicate china right now, and we're speeding toward a brick wall."[95]]] The series's creators completed the first draft of the hour-long finale in January 2004, four months before its original airing. Crane, Kauffman and Bright watched the finales of other sitcoms to prepare the episode's outline, paying attention to what worked and what did not. They liked the ones that stayed true to the series, citing the finale of _The Mary Tyler Moore Show_ as the gold standard. Crane, Kauffman, and Bright had difficulty writing the finale. They did not want to do "something high concept, or take the show out of the show."[96] The most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience, and with a minimum number of crew members. The main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly:[97]

NBC heavily promoted the series finale, which was preceded by weeks of media hype.[98] Local NBC affiliates organized viewing parties around the U.S., including an event at Universal CityWalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor Astrovision screen.[99] The finale was the subject of two episodes of _Dateline NBC_, one of which ran for twoÂ hours. A one-hour retrospective of clips from previous episodes was shown before to the airing of the episode. Following the finale, _The Tonight Show with Jay Leno_ was filmed on the set of the _Friends_' Central Perk coffee house, which featured the series's cast as guests.[100][101] The advertising rates for the finale averaged $2Â million for 30Â seconds of commercial time, breaking the record held by the _Seinfeld_ finale at $1.7Â million.[102]

In the U.S., 52.5Â million viewers watched the finale on May 6, 2004, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast since the _Seinfeld_ finale in 1998.[103] Although not the most-watched episode of the series,[104] the finale was the fourthÂ most-watched series finale in television history, only behind the finales of _M*A*S*H_, _Cheers_ and _Seinfeld_, which were respectively watched by 105, 80.4 and 76.2Â million viewers. The retrospective episode was watched by fewer than 36Â million viewers, and the finale was the second most-watched television broadcast of the year in the United States, only behind the Super Bowl.[105] Following the finales of _Friends_ and _Frasier_, media critics speculated about the fate of the sitcom genre. Expressed opinions varied between a signalling of the end of the sitcom genre, a small decline in the large history of the genre,[106] and a general reduction of scripted television in favor of reality shows.[107]


Reception

Critical reception

Early reviews of the series were mixed; and it holds a Metacritic score of 59 out of 100, based on 20 sampled reviews, indicating "mixed to average reviews."[108] Tom Feran of _The Plain Dealer_ wrote that the series traded "vaguely and less successfully on the hanging-out style of _Seinfeld_",[109] while Ann Hodges of the _Houston Chronicle_ called it "the new _Seinfeld_ wannabe, but it will never be as funny as _Seinfeld_."[110] In the _Los Angeles Daily News_, Ray Richmond named the series as "one of the brighter comedies of the new season",[111] and the _Los Angeles Times_ called it "flat-out the best comedy series of the new season."[112]

The _Chicago Sun-Times_{{'}} Ginny Holbert found Joey and Rachel's characteristics to be underdeveloped,[113] while Richmond commended the cast as a "likeable, youth ensemble" with "good chemistry."[114] Robert Bianco of _USA Today_ was complimentary of Schwimmer, calling him "terrific." He also praised the female leads, but was concerned that Perry's role as Chandler was "undefined" and that LeBlanc was "relying too much on the same brain-dead stud routine that was already tired the last two times he tried it."[115] The authors of _Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends_ thought that the cast was "trying just a little too hard", in particular, Perry and Schwimmer.[116]

As the series progressed, reviews became more positive, and _Friends_ became one of the most popular sitcoms of its time. It is now often ranked among the all-time best TV shows.[117][118][119] Critics commended the series for having consistently sharp writing and for the chemistry between the main actors.[120] Noel Holston of _Newsday_, who had dismissed the pilot as a "so-so _Seinfeld_ wannabe" in 1994, repudiated his earlier review after rewatching the episode and felt like writing an apology to the writers.[121] Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com thought that the series "hit its stride" in the second season. Havrilesky found the character-specific jokes and situations "could reliably make you laugh out loud a few times each episode", and the quality of writing allowed the stories to be "original and innovative."[122] Bill Carter of _The New York Times_ called the eighth season a "truly stunning comeback." Carter found that by "generating new hot storylines and high-decibel laughs", the series made its way "back into the hearts of its fans."[123] However, Liane Bonin of _Entertainment Weekly_ felt that the direction of the ninth season was a "disappointing buzzkill", criticizing it for the non-stop celebrity guest spots and going into jump the shark territory. Although disappointed with the season, Bonin noted that "the writing [was] still sharp."[124] Havrilesky thought that the tenth season was "alarmingly awful, far worse than you would ever imagine a show that was once so good could be."[125] _Friends_ was featured on _Time_{{'}}s list of "The 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time", saying, "the well-hidden secret of this show was that it called itself _Friends_, and was really about family."[126]

Reviews of the series finale were mixed. _USA Today_{{'}}s Robert Bianco described the finale as entertaining and satisfying and praised it for deftly mixing emotion and humor while highlighting each of the stars.[127] Sarah Rodman of the _Boston Herald_ praised Aniston and Schwimmer for their acting, but felt that their characters' reunion was "a bit too neat, even if it was what most of the show's legions of fans wanted."[128] Roger Catlin of the _Hartford Courant_ felt that newcomers to the series would be "surprised at how laughless the affair could be, and how nearly every strained gag depends on the sheer stupidity of its characters."[129] Ken Parish Perkins, writing for _Fort Worth Star-Telegram_, pointed out that the finale was "more touching than comical, more satisfying in terms of closure than knee-slappingly funny."[130]

Awards

To maintain the series's ensemble format, the main cast members decided to enter themselves in the same acting categories for awards.[131] Beginning with the series's eighth season, the actors decided to submit themselves in the lead actor balloting, rather than in the supporting actor fields.[132] The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards,[133] winning six. Aniston and Kudrow are the only main cast members to win an Emmy, while Cox is the only actor not to be nominated. The series won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2002, receiving nominations in 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, and 2003.[134] The series also won an American Comedy Award,[135] one GLAAD Media Award,[136] one Golden Globe Award,[137] three Logie Awards,[138][139] six People's Choice Awards,[140][141] one Satellite Award,[142] and one Screen Actors Guild Award.[143]

Syndication

Because of syndication revenue, _Friends_ continues to generate approximately $1Â billion each year for Warner Bros. That translates into about $20Â million in annual residuals each for Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, who each get 2% of syndication income for _Friends_.[162]

All episodes became available on Netflix on 1 January 2015, introducing teenagers to the show. UK _Friends_ reruns' ratings in 2015 increased by more than 10% annually. reruns' US weekly audience, not including streaming, of 16 million would make it a hit on network television were the show still being produced.[163] In the US the series has a syndication deal through multiple networks including Nickelodeon, TBS, and Paramount (formerly known as Spike).


Cultural impact

Although the producers thought of _Friends_ as "only a TV show", psychologists investigated the cultural impact of _Friends_ during the series's run. Aniston's hairstyle was nicknamed "The Rachel" and copied around the world.[164] Joey's catchphrase, "How _you_ doin'?", became a popular part of Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends.[165] The series also influenced the English language, according to a study by the University of Toronto that found that the characters used the emphasized word "_so_" to modify adjectives more often than any other intensifier. Although the preference had already made its way into the American vernacular, usage on the series may have accelerated the change.[166] Chandler's habit of ending a sentence unfinished for sarcasm also influenced viewers' speech.[167] Following the September 11 attacks, ratings increased 17% over the previous season.[168]

_Friends_ is parodied in the twelfth season _Murder, She Wrote_ episode "Murder Among Friends." In the episode, amateur sleuth Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) investigates the murder of a writer for _Buds_, a fictional television series about the daily lives of a group of city friends. The episode was devised after CBS moved _Murder, She Wrote_ from its regular Sunday night timeslot to a Thursday night timeslot directly opposite _Friends_ on NBC; Angela Lansbury was quoted by Bruce Lansbury, her brother and _Murder, She Wrote_{{'}}s supervising producer, as having "a bit of an attitude" about the move to Thursday, but he saw the plot as "a friendly setup, no mean-spiritedness."[169] Jerry Ludwig, the writer of the episode, researched the "flavor" of _Buds_ by watching episodes of _Friends_.[170]

The Central Perk coffee house, one of the principal settings of the series, is part of the Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood. People sometimes propose marriage on the couch, and many tourists cry when they sit on it. The coffee house has inspired various imitations worldwide. In 2006, Iranian businessman Mojtaba Asadian started a Central Perk franchise, registering the name in 32 countries. The decor of the coffee houses is inspired by _Friends_, featuring replica couches, counters, neon signage and bricks. The coffee houses also contain paintings of the various characters from the series, and televisions playing _Friends_ episodes. James Michael Tyler, who plays the Central Perk manager in the series, Gunther, attended the grand opening of the Dubai cafe, where he worked as a waiter.[171] Central Perk was rebuilt as part of a museum exhibit at Warner Bros. Studios and was shown on _The Ellen DeGeneres Show_ in October 2008. Jennifer Aniston visited the set for the first time since the series finale in 2004.[172] From September 24 to October 7, 2009, a Central Perk replica was based at Broadwick Street, Soho, London. The coffee house sold real coffee to customers and featured a display of _Friends_ memorabilia and props, such as the Geller Cup from the season three episode "The One with the Football."[173] In Beijing, business owner Du Xin opened a coffee shop named Central Perk in March 2010.[174] In India, there are six _Friends_-themed cafes, located in Chandigarh (named Central Perk); Kolkata; and West Bengal (named F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Cafe), which features many icons from the original T.V. series, including Chandler and Joey's ugly dog statue, the orange sofa, the purple door of Monica and Rachel's apartment, and Phoebe's pink bicycle. The other three cafes are located in Delhi, Gurgaon; Bhubaneswar, Odisha; and Pune, Maharashtra.[175][176] There are two _Friends_ themed cafes in Pakistan as wellone in Lahore, Punjab known as "Friends Cafe" and the other in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa called "Central Perk". Both of those cafes have an iconic couch, a guitar and foosball table, quotes from the show on the walls and even episode reruns on a projector. They're also planning to have their own Gunther at the bar.[177] In 2016, a Central Perk replica was opened in Outram, Singapore. It is the only Central Perk that has been given the intellectual property rights by Warner Bros. outside of the United States. The cafe also includes feature walls, replicating the walls of the main characters's apartments and memorabilia and props used on the show.[178][179]

Friends has also developed an alternative family lifestyle by representing young people that live unconventional domestic lives. It presents the idea that "all you need is good friends" and can construct families through choice. The audience is able to identify with the program through the troubles seen on weekly episodes. It portrays a new way of living life and developing relationships which are not normally seen in conventional society.[180] According to a pop-culture expert at the University at Buffalo, _Friends_ is "one of those rare shows that marked a change in American culture." The images of youth and the roles they portray are better defined and represent a lifestyle that centres around creating and sustaining relationships between friends running their own lives and seeking help from each other.[181]

_Vox_ stated that _Friends_ impacted the creation of other conflictless "hangout sitcoms", with groups of adult friends who are funny and have similar character traits. One example of this is _How I Met Your Mother_, which _The Guardian_{{'}}s TV and radio blog notes also shares its setting with _Friends_, Manhattan. Other examples include _The Big Bang Theory_, _New Girl_, and _Happy Endings_.[182][183][184][185]

Readers of _TV Guide_ voted the cast of _Friends_ their Best Comedy cast of all time, ranking at 29% of the votes, beating _Seinfeld_, which registered 18%.[186] A poll undertaken by _60 Minutes_ and _Vanity Fair_ named _Friends_ the third greatest sitcom of all time.[187] In 2014, the series was ranked by _Mundo Estranho_ the Best TV Series of All Time.[188] A 2015 _Hollywood Reporter_ survey of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named _Friends_ as their #1 favorite show.[189]


Distribution

Broadcast

United States

After the produced pilot lived up to NBC's hopes, the series premiered with the name _Friends_ on September 22, 1994, in the coveted Thursday 8:30Â p.m. time slot. The pilot aired between _Mad About You_ and _Seinfeld_,[190] and was watched by almost 22Â million American viewers.[191] The series was a huge success throughout its run and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV.[192] When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing and that at least two of the cast members would not sign on for another season.[193] When it was confirmed that _Friends_ would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of moneyâ$7Â million per episodeâthat it took to bring the series back for another season.[194]

After year-long expectations that the ninth season would be the series's last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series's creative team did not want to extend negotiations into the next year and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale.[195] NBC agreed to pay $10Â million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series.[196] Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series.[197] The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24Â episodes to 18Â episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.[198]

In fall 2001, Warner Bros. Domestic Cable made a deal with sister network TBS (both are owned by Time Warner) to air the series in rerun syndication. Warner Bros. Domestic Cable announced that it had sold additional cable rights to _Friends_ to Nick at Nite which began airing in the fall of 2011 (unlike the TBS and broadcast syndication airings, Nick at Nite broadcasts of the series, which began airing as part of a seven-night launch marathon on September 5, 2011, replace the end credit tag scenes with marginalized credits featuring promotions for the series and other Nick at Nite programs). Warner Bros. was expected to make $200Â million in license fees and advertising from the deal. Nick at Nite paid $500,000 per episode to air the episodes after 6Â p.m. ET for six years through fall 2017. In syndication until 2005, _Friends_ had earned $4Â million per episode in cash license fees for a total of $944Â million.[199]

Beginning on March 5, 2012, high definition versions of all 236 _Friends_ episodes were made available to local broadcast stations, starting with the pilot episode. For the remastered episodes, Warner Bros. restored previously cropped images on the left and right sides of the screen, using the original 35 mm film source, to use the entire 16:9 widescreen frame.[200] These masters had been airing in New Zealand on TV2 since January 2011.[201] Netflix added all ten seasons of _Friends_ in high definition to their streaming service in the United States on January 1, 2015.

These versions, with additional footage not seen domestically, have aired on such stations as Channel 4, Sky1, E4, and Comedy Central UK.[202][203][204][205][206] On September 4, 2011, _Friends_ officially ended on E4 after the channel re-ran the series since 2004. Comedy Central took over the rights to air the program from October 2011. Since 2018 Channel 5 started airing the program. In the Republic of Ireland, each season of the show made its European debut on RTÃ2. After 2004 RTÃ2 began to repeat the series from the start before moving over to TV3 and its digital channel 3e in 2010.[207][208] , repeats of the show have returned to RTÃ2 while also broadcasting on Comedy Central Ireland.[209][210]

Home media

Streaming

In October 2014, Warner Bros. chairman and chief executive officer, Kevin Tsujihara, announced that the company had licensed the North American streaming rights of all ten seasons of _Friends_ to Netflix,[219][220] in a deal said to be worth around $500,000 an episode,[221] or about $120Â million in total. The show became available on Netflix from January 1, 2015.[222] The Netflix airings are the versions aired on NBC rather than the longer international versions, as discussed below. The series will leave Netflix in early 2020 for HBO Max.[223]

Blu-ray and DVD

All ten seasons have been released on DVD individually and as a box set.

In September 1995, WEA Records released the first album of music from _Friends_, the _Friends Original TV Soundtrack_, containing music featured in previous and future episodes. The soundtrack debuted on the _Billboard_ 200 at number 46,[225] and sold 500,000Â copies in November 1995.[226] In 1999, a second soundtrack album entitled _Friends Again_ was released.[227] Other merchandise includes a _Friends_ version of the DVD game "SceneÂ It?", and a quiz video game for PlayStationÂ 2 and PC entitled _Friends: The One with All the Trivia_.[228][229] On September 28, 2009, a box set was released in the UK celebrating the series's 15th anniversary. The box set contained extended episodes, an episode guide, and original special features.[230]

Warner Home Video released a complete series collection on Blu-ray on November 13, 2012.[231] The collection does not feature the extra deleted scenes and jokes that were included on prior DVD releases, and are therefore presented in their NBC broadcast versions.

_Joey_

After the series finale in 2004, LeBlanc signed on for the spin-off series, _Joey_, following Joey's move to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. Kauffman and Crane were not interested in the spin-off, although Bright agreed to executive produce the series with Scott Silveri and Shana Goldberg-Meehan.[252] NBC heavily promoted _Joey_ and gave it _Friends_' Thursday 8:00Â pm timeslot.[253][254] The pilot was watched by 18.6Â million American viewers,[255] but ratings continually decreased throughout the series's two seasons, averaging 10.2Â million viewers in the first season and 7.1Â million in the second.[256] The final broadcast episode on March 7, 2006, was watched by 7.09Â million viewers;[257] NBC cancelled the series on May 15, 2006, after twoÂ seasons.[258] Bright blamed the collaboration between NBC executives, the studio and other producers for quickly ruining the series:[259]
