DICK CLARK'S ROCK, ROLL AND REMEMBER (sometimes shortened to _Rock, Roll and Remember_) was a weekly American rock and roll radio documentary show hosted by Dick Clark featuring oldies music.[1] It was broadcast on United Stations Radio Networks and its predecessors between 1982 and 2004. It is re-run in syndication by United Stations Radio Networks, KZRO, and WRHL.


History

It was first broadcast on February 14, 1982 and originally hosted by Gene Weed. The next year Clark and Mark Elliot became co-hosts. By 1985 Clark became the sole presenter. The show was written by Pam Miller and produced by Frank Furino.[2] and named after the autobiography Clark co-wrote with Richard Robinson.[3] In each episode Clark profiled a different rock 'n' roll artist from the 1950s and 1960s. He also counted down the top four songs that week from a certain year in the 1950s, 1960s or early 1970s.[4] In 2004, when Clark suffered a stroke and was no longer able to speak clearly, production of the show ended.[5] The show has since aired continuously in reruns; these reruns have seen declining appearance since Clark's death, mainly since the "oldies" genre on most radio stations has since evolved into a 1970s/1980s-centered classic hits format that no longer features the 1950s and 1960s music that serves as the show's core playlist.

Beginning in 2009, Clark's profile segments for the show were integrated into another syndicated show, _Rewind with Gary Bryan._ (The current version of _Rewind_ does not have any identifiable contributions from Clark.)


Merchandising

Compilation records of the show have been released throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

It was also adapted as a celebrity comic in 1995. The drawings were provided by Don Sherwood, while Fred Bronson wrote the scripts.[6]
