BILLY YAKUBA OUATTARA (born January 24, 1992 in Tepa, Ghana) is a Ghanaian-French professional basketball player who is currently playing for the AS Monaco Basket of the LNB Pro A.

Because of the unavailability of a Ghanaian national basketball team, he has been a member of the French national basketball team.[1]


Professional career

Ouattara first began his professional career out in France with the Élan Chalon of the LNB Pro A in 2012 as a 20 year old. He played with that team for two seasons before signing a one-year deal with the ASC Denain-Voltaire PH, who were a part of the LNB Pro B at that time. During that year, he helped the team make it to the LNB Pro B Finals before ultimately losing the series to Hyères-Toulon Var Basket. On July 24, 2015, Ouattara signed with the AS Monaco Basket out in Monaco, returning to the Pro A that year.[2] During his second season at Monaco, Ouattara was named a French Pro A All-Star and helped Monaco win the Leaders Cup Championship over the ASVEL Basket in 2017.

Oattara signed a two-way contract with the Brooklyn Nets of the NBA on July 21, 2017, becoming the first foreign born player to sign a two-way deal with an NBA team. Under the terms of the deal, he would have planned to split time between the Brooklyn Nets and their G League affiliate, the Long Island Nets, with a majority of his time being spent with the Long Island affiliate team.[3] However, due to injury problems throughout the year, he would never get a chance to play with the Brooklyn Nets squad, having only played in one G League game with the Long Island Nets during that time. On December 17, 2017, Ouattara was waived by the Nets.[4] On January 17, 2018, Ouattara was reacquired by the Long Island Nets.[5]

On March 30, 2018, Ouattara signed for the remainder of the 2017–18 season with Monaco.[6]
