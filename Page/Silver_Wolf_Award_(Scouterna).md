The SILVER WOLF (Swedish: SILVERVARGEN) is the highest award made by Swedish Scouting, to active leaders at the national level for exceptionally meritorious work. The award consists of a stylized silver wolf with a fleur-de-lis with the words "Scouterna", suspended from a turquoise neck ribbon. The Silver Wolf will be distributed by someone who already holds the award.

The Silver Wolf was established in 1920 for extraordinary contributions to Scouting. The original badge also meant that apart from being first-class, the Scout also passed tests for first aid and another 15 specific merit badges.

When the 1935 World Scout Conference decided that each country would have a Silver Wolf as the highest award at the national level, Sweden chose to continue with the Silver Wolf but then changed so that the Svenska Scoutunionen (Swedish Scout Union) distributed it. At this time the Silver Wolf took on the form it has today.[1]

The first Silver Wolf was awarded to Ebbe Lieberath in 1920.[2] The first awarded the Silver Wolf in its new form was Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten in 1935.[3] In 1970 Ingrid Ericsson was the first woman awarded the Silver Wolf.
