"BASKET OF DEPLORABLES" is a phrase from a 2016 presidential election campaign speech delivered by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on September 9, 2016, at a campaign fundraising event, which she used to describe half of the supporters of her opponent, Republican nominee Donald J. Trump. The next day she expressed regret for "saying half", while insisting that Trump had deplorably amplified "hateful views and voices".

The Trump campaign repeatedly used the phrase against Clinton during and after the 2016 presidential election. Many Trump supporters adopted the "deplorable" moniker for themselves in reappropriation. Some journalists and political analysts questioned whether this incident played a role in the election's outcome. Clinton admitted in her 2017 book _What Happened_ that it was one of the factors for her loss.


Background

Throughout her presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton expressed her concerns regarding Donald Trump and his supporters. _The New York Times_ and _CNN_ cited Clinton's earlier articulation of similar ideas to the phrase in her August 25, 2016 campaign speech at a rally in Reno, Nevada.[1][2] In that speech, Clinton had criticized Trump's campaign for using "racist lies" and allowing the alt-right to gain prominence, claiming that Trump was "taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party".[3][4] Clinton also criticized Trump for choosing Steve Bannon as his chief executive officer, especially given Bannon's role as the executive chair of the far-right news website _Breitbart News_.[5] Clinton read various headlines from the site, including "Would You Rather Your Child Had Feminism or Cancer?" and "Hoist It High And Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims A Glorious Heritage".[6] On that same day, Clinton posted a video on Twitter depicting white supremacists supporting Donald Trump. Within the video is a CNN interview wherein Trump initially declined to disavow white nationalist David Duke.[7]

During campaign fundraisers in August 2016, Clinton reportedly explained her divide and conquer approach to courting Republican voters by putting Trump supporters into two "baskets": everyday Republicans whom she would target and the alt-right crowd.[8] During a September 8, 2016, interview on Israel's Channel 2, Clinton said: "You can take Trump supporters and put them in two big baskets. There are what I would call the deplorables—you know, the racists and the haters, and the people who are drawn because they think somehow he's going to restore an America that no longer exists."[9]


Speech

At an LGBT campaign fundraising event in New York City on September 9, Clinton gave a speech and said the following:[10]


Responses

Hillary Clinton

The following day Clinton expressed regret for "saying half", while insisting that Trump had deplorably amplified "hateful views and voices".[11] At the second presidential debate in October 2016, after Trump mentioned the speech in a response to James Carter, debate moderator Anderson Cooper asked Clinton: "How can you unite a country if you've written off tens of millions of Americans?"[12] Clinton responded to Cooper's question by saying: "My argument is not with his supporters, it's with him and the hateful, divisive campaign he has run".[13]

On October 20, 2016, during the 71st Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, Clinton joked about the phrase, telling the guests: "I just want to put you all in a basket of adorables".[14]

Clinton's campaign

Clinton's campaign pointed to a series of polls that showed that some of Trump's supporters held negative views toward Latinos, African Americans, and Muslims.[15] Clinton's campaign used the incident to try to force Trump's campaign members to denounce its extreme supporters. For example, after Mike Pence refused to call David Duke "deplorable", Clinton's running mate Tim Kaine accused Pence of enabling racism and xenophobia.[16]

Donald Trump

Donald Trump criticized Clinton's remark as insulting his supporters.[17][18] In a rally at Des Moines, Iowa, Trump stated: "While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country".[19][20] During the rest of the election, Trump invited "deplorable Americans" on stage.[21] For example, at a rally in Miami, Florida, on September 16, 2016, Trump parodied _Les Misérables_ with the title _Les Déplorables_ under the song "Do You Hear the People Sing?".[22][23] Trump also used the label against Clinton in an advertisement, which claimed that Clinton herself is deplorable because she "viciously demoniz[es] hard working people like you".[24] On November 8, 2017, one year after the election, Trump thanked his "deplorables" for his victory.[25]

Others in Trump's campaign responded negatively to the statement. Trump's running mate Mike Pence stated in a Capitol Hill meeting: "For Hillary Clinton to express such disdain for millions of Americans is one more reason that disqualifies her to serve in the highest office."[26] Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, had issued a statement on Twitter, claiming: "One day after promising to be aspirational & uplifting, Hillary insults millions of Americans."[27][28]

Meanwhile, Roger Stone and Donald Trump Jr. posted a parody movie poster of _The Expendables_ on Twitter and Instagram titled "The Deplorables", which included Pepe the Frog's face among those of members of the Trump family and other figures popular among the alt-right.[29]

In the final months of the election, the Trump campaign released official merchandise with the word "deplorable".[30][31]

Trump's supporters

One notable celebration was DeploraBall, which was celebrated by Trump supporters and several members of the alt-right at the National Press Building from January 19 to January 20, 2017.[34][35][36]


Analysis

The day after Hillary Clinton's speech, some political analysts compared the statement to Mitt Romney's 47% gaffe in 2012.[37][38][39][40]

After the election, Diane Hessan, who had been hired by the Clinton campaign to track undecided voters, wrote in _The Boston Globe_ that "all hell broke loose" after the "basket of deplorables" comment, which prompted what she saw as the largest shift of undecided voters towards Trump.[41] Political scientist Charles Murray said, in a post-election interview with Sam Harris, that because the comment helped get Donald Trump elected, Murray agreed with Jonathan Haidt that it had "changed the history of the world, and he [Haidt] may very well be right. That one comment by itself may have swung enough votes, it certainly was emblematic of the disdain with which the New Upper Class looks at mainstream Americans."[42]

In an interview with CNN on December 4, 2016, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook said that the statement "definitely could have alienated" her voters.[43] Meanwhile, Courtney Weaver of _Financial Times_ believed that Clinton's comment had no effect on the election, stating: "To argue that one word cost Mrs Clinton the election is foolish." However, Weaver acknowledged that the statement "did not hurt her opponent".[44] James Taranto of _The Wall Street Journal_ wrote that Clinton only stated that she regretted saying half without indicating whether she underestimated or overestimated.[45]

_Spectator_ columnist Charles Moore compared the impact of the statement to that of British left-winger Nye Bevan's comments disparaging British Conservative Party members as "lower than vermin" in 1948.[46] Moore noted that these remarks sparked a similar outrage and led to the formation of the "Vermin Club".

Some Trump opponents turned the phrase against the Trump administration, for example _Time_ writer Darlena Cunha opined that several members nominated for Trump's cabinet were a "basket of deplorables" spreading racism, Islamophobia, and antisemitism.[47]

In her 2017 book _What Happened_, Clinton said that her comments on the "basket of deporables" were a factor in her electoral loss.[48]

_Politico_{{'}}s Rich Lowry describes conservatives' interpretation of Clinton's use of the term as "an unfair, disparaging term for people who believe reasonable but politically incorrect things (immigration should be restricted, NFL players should stand during the national anthem, All Lives Matter, etc.)".[49]
