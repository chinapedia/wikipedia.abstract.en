A_Language_Icon.jpg The LANGUAGE ICON is a specific icon designed for people to select a specific language to use when they face multi-lingual, multi-national websites.[1] __TOC__


History

The Language icon was designed by Onur Mustak Cobanli and his team in 2008 when they planned to build a multi-lingual, multi-national website. After the first language icons were rejected, the design contest was organized by A’ Design Award & Competition.[2] Farhat Datta designed the winning entry, “Turnstile Language Icon.”[3][4]
