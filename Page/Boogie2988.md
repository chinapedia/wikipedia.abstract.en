STEVEN JASON WILLIAMS (born July 24, 1974), also known by his online alias BOOGIE2988 or just BOOGIE,[1] is a YouTube personality best known for his video rants about video games and nerd culture as a character named "Francis".[2][3] The Francis character is based on stereotypes of needy video game players and often parodies trending video game news, reaction and culture. Williams based the character on his early life experiences and has said that he wants viewers to hate the character for embodying gamer stereotypes.[4] Boogie2988 videos range from absurd rants to serious discussions on daily life,[5] such as the ethics of paid promotion on YouTube channels, and his encounters with mental health.[6][7] He won the Trending Gamer award at The Game Awards 2016.[8]


Personal life

Williams had gastric bypass surgery due to morbid obesity on August 1, 2017.[9] On December 19, 2017, Boogie2988 announced that he and his wife Desiree were getting a divorce.[10] The divorce was finalized on February 13, 2018.[11]

Williams attended the University of Virginia's College at Wise but did not finish his graduation.[12]


Hack

In June 2016, Boogie's YouTube account was temporarily closed due to an anonymous hacker. The unidentified person got ahold of his phone number via Verizon during his time at VidCon and was able to gain access to his accounts associated with it, including his YouTube channel. His channel was restored less than a week later.[13][14][15]
