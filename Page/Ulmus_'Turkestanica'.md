The elm cultivar _ULMUS_ 'TURKESTANICA' was first described by Regel as _U. turkestanica_ in Dieck, _Hauptcat. Baumschul. Zöschen_ (1883)[1] and in _Gartenflora_ (1884).[2][3] Regel himself later stressed that "_U. turkestanica_ was only a preliminary name given by me; I regard this as a form of _U. suberosa_ [:_U. minor_]".[4] 'Turkestanica' was distributed in Europe as _U. turkestanica_ Regel by the Späth nursery of Berlin, in whose catalogues it was listed separately from _U. pinnato-ramosa_, now _U. pumila_ 'Pinnato-ramosa', and from _U. campestris umbraculifera_,[5] with both of which it was later confused – the former by Elwes and Henry, the latter (as _U._ 'Turkestanica') by Green.[6] The Hesse Nursery of Weener, Germany, sold an _Ulmus turkestanica_ Reg. in the 1930s, but gave _U. pumila arborea_ Litv., another name for 'Pinnato-ramosa', as a synonym.[7]


Description

Späth in his catalogue of 1903 described _U. turkestanica_ Regel as "a densely growing, small-leaved tree of upright growth, close to _U. pumila_".[8] Melville noted in 1958 that the specimen of _U. turkestanica_ at Kew had "frond-like leading shoots".[9]


Pests and diseases

Cultivation

One tree was planted as _U. turkestanica_ Regel, 'Turkestan Elm', in 1899 at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, Canada, where it was distinguished from _U. pinnato-ramosa_.[10] A specimen of _U. turkestanica_ was planted at Kew.[11] Three _U. turkestanica_ Regel were supplied in 1902 by Späth to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.[12][13] A tree accessioned by that name at the Benmore garden in Argyll in 1902, and surviving (2016) almost certainly as a sucker or cutting of one of the three originals, was, following Green's confusion of 'Turkestanica' and 'Umbraculifera', believed for a time to be 'Umbraculifera'. 'Umbraculifera', however, though present in Späth's 1903 catalogue, does not appear in the RBGE 1902 accessions list from Späth. Being grafted, it does not sucker. Later, the tree was misidentified by the Garden as _U. pumila_ L. var. _arborea_ Litv.,[14] though the leaves do not match those of the latter cultivar. A second tree labelled _U. turkestanica_ stood till 1993 in RGBE itself, near the _U. pinnato-ramosa_. This was also a small tree; it produced suckers, and may itself have been sucker regrowth from one of the 1902 trees. A specimen of 'Turkestanica' obtained from Späth before 1914, and planted in 1916, stood in the Ryston Hall arboretum, Norfolk,[15] in the early 20th century.[16] A specimen of 'Turkestanica' Regel stood in the Arboretum national des Barres, Nogent-sur-Vernisson, France, in the 20th century, where it was distinguished from 'Pinnato-ramosa'.[17]

Putative specimens

A possible third, a tall suckering field elm with leaves closely matching those of the Benmore specimen, and with the "frond-like leading shoots" described by Melville, stands in Carlton Terrace Gardens, Edinburgh, above Carlton Terrace Brae.
