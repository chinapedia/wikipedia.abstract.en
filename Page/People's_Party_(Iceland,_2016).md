The PEOPLE'S PARTY () is an Icelandic political party founded by Inga Sæland. Its main focus is to have better conditions for the poor and disabled.[1]

The party ran in the Icelandic parliamentary election 2016.[2] It received 3.5% of the votes and thus failed to pass the 5% threshold required to enter the legislature. In the parliamentary election of 2017, the party received 6.88% of the votes and gained four seats in the Althing.

At the end of November 2018, the party expelled two of its parliamentarians, Karl Gauti Hjaltason and Ólafur Ísleifsson,[3] after a meeting of these with members of the Centre Party where Karl Gauti and Ólafur didn't object to derogatory remarks of Centre Party members against the People's Party's leader, Inga Sæland.[4] Previously, the party ran into controversy when Inga made comments that were considered by the media as "xenophobic" and "anti-immigrant." Inga has made efforts to distance herself from those comments, even calling for increased care for refugees.[5] _The New York Times_ has referred to the party as "railing against immigration, poverty and corruption".[6]
