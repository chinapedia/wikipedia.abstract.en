AUGUSTUS FREDERICK SHAPLEIGH (1810â€“1902) was an American businessman and early pioneer of St. Louis during the Second Industrial Revolution.[1][2] He was president of the A. F. Shapleigh Hardware Company, which by the 1880s grew to be one of the largest wholesale hardware firms west of the Mississippi River.[3] He was also involved in a number of other business endeavors in the banking, mining, and insurance industry.


Life

Shapleigh was the son of Captain Richard Waldron Shapleigh and Dorothea Blaisdell Shapleigh.[4] His father was captain of the _Granville_.[5] In 1813, at the age of 37, Captain Richard Shapleigh died at sea with his ship, which was wrecked off Rye Beach, New York.[6]

In 1843, Shapleigh founded one of the first hardware stores in St. Louis on behalf of Rogers, Field & Company.[7] The following year the company was renamed Rogers, Shapleigh & Company.[8] The original store was a four-story building at 412-422 Main Street.[9] The site was chosen for its proximity to the Mississippi River, which was the main source of transportation for goods at the time.[10]

Aside from his connection with the hardware industry, Shapleigh was associated with various other business concerns all of which constitute elements in the development of St. Louis.[11] In 1859, he became identified with the State Bank of St. Louis and in 1862 was elected a director of the Merchant's National Bank, so continuing until 1890, when he resigned in favor of his son Alfred.[12] He was also president of the Phoenix Insurance Company, vice president of the Covenant Mutual Life Insurance Company.[13] He was also invested in the Hope Mining Company and the Granite Mountain Mining Company.[14] Shapleigh also served as a board director of the Hope Mining Company.[15]

Shapleigh died of natural causes at the age of 92.[16] He had been in failing health for many years, but retained his mental faculties.[17] He is buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis.[18]
