The LIBERTY OF PETERBOROUGH CONSTABULARY was the territorial police force responsible for law enforcement surrounding 'The Soke of Peterborough', England, from 1856 to 1947.[1] It was initially controlled by the Chief Constable of Northamptonshire Captain Henry Lambert Bayly 1857 - 1876. The constabulary had a newly build headquarters and still stands today, The old Gaol, also known as 'sessions House' along Thorpe Road, Peterborough.


History

1856–1947

Following the passing of the County and Borough Police Act 1856, the Liberty of Peterborough Constabulary was formed the following year on 10 March 1857.[2] Later, in 1874, a Charter of Incorporation was granted to the City of Peterborough, prompting the Council to form a Watch Committee along with the Peterborough City Police.

Up until 1947 the constabulary only officially used the one helmet plate design, a day and a night plate, see photographs. In 1934 when flat caps were issued for officers assigned to motor patrols, the constabulary had some early badges chromed to save on purchase costs of new badges, it is thought that only three chromed badges were produced. The day badge photographed, is one such chromed badge. It is also known that when Liberty badges were in short supply due to breakages, wear and tear, then Identical designed Northamptonshire badges were used as these were in plentiful supply, Peterborough and the soke of, at that time, was still within the county of Northamptonshire. Compare Badges

In 1914 the Constabulary had its own Special Constables but very little is known about this; only a badge exists, and it is only by the design of the badge that dating can be made.

These two forces, The Liberty of Peterborough Constabulary and the Peterborough City Police were combined on 1 April 1947 to form the Peterborough Combined Police Force.

1947–1965

On 31 March 1965, five police forces in the Cambridgeshire area, The Peterborough Combined Police, Cambridge City Police, Cambridgeshire Constabulary, Huntingdonshire Constabulary and Isle of Ely Constabulary were amalgamated to form the Mid-Anglia Constabulary, headquartered in Brampton. The name changed again on 31 March 1974 to form today's Cambridgeshire Constabulary following alterations to the county boundaries.
