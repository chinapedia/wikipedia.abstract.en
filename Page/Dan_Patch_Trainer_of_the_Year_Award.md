The DAN PATCH TRAINER OF THE YEAR AWARD is an annual award created in 1985 by members of the United States Harness Writers Association (USHWA). The Association's website states that their members' determination is aided by input from the American Harness Racing Secretaries plus logistic expertise provided by the United States Trotting Association.[1]

The award winner receives the Glen Garnsey Trophy, named in honor of the Hall of Fame trainer who died at the zenith of his career at age 52 in 1985 as the result of an automobile accident.[2]

There are several categories of USHWA Dan Patch Award named for the legendary pacer Dan Patch (1896-1916).[3]
