_LEE KONITZ MEETS WARNE MARSH AGAIN_ is a live album by American jazz saxophonists Lee Konitz and Warne Marsh recorded at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in 1976 and released on the Pausa label.[1][2][3]


Reception

Scott Yanow of Allmusic wrote: "Their repertoire (common chord changes) and cool jazz styles are not that surprising but both of the saxophonists sound quite inspired to be in each other's presence; they always brought out the best in each other. The melodic and boppish improvisations reward repeated listenings".[4]
