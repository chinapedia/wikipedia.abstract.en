BUCINNAZINE (AP-237, 1-BUTYRYL-4-CINNAMYLPIPERAZINE) is an opioid analgesic drug that was widely used in China to treat pain in cancer patients as of 1986.[1] It is one of the most potent compounds among a series of analgesic acyl piperazines compounds first synthesized and reported in Japan in the 1970s.[2][3][4] Bucinnazine has analgesic potency comparable to that of morphine but with a relatively higher therapeutic index.

The drug was initially claimed to be a non-narcotic analgesic. However, subsequent studies have shown bucinnazine and similar acyl piperazines to be potent and selective agonists of μ-opioid receptor (MOR) with relatively low affinity for the δ-opioid receptor and the κ-opioid receptor.[5] In accordance with these studies, results from the intravenous self-administration experiments in rats showed that bucinnazine has a marked reinforcing effect with tolerance and dependence quickly developing.[6] In addition, the morphine antagonist naloxone reverses the effect of bucinnazine and precipitates withdrawal symptoms in bucinnazine treated rats further indicating a mechanism of analgesia mediated via selective agonist activity at μ-opioid receptors.


Derivatives

The 2-methyl and 2,6-dimethyl derivatives of AP-237 are also known to be active as opioid analgesics,[7][8] and 2-methyl-AP-237 has been sold as a designer drug, first identified by a police forensic laboratory in Slovenia in March 2019.[9] 2-Methyl-AP-237_structure.png
