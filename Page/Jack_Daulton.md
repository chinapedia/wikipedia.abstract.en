JAMES (JACK) DAULTON (born October 30, 1956) is an American art collector, National Geographic lecturer, and trial lawyer, concentrating in art and entertainment litigation. Daulton represented the nation of Myanmar in the 1994 case, _United States v. Richard Diran and The Union of Myanmar,_ successfully recovering a 1,000 year old Buddha statue that had been stolen from a temple in the ancient capital, Bagan, in 1988.[1][2] This was the first cultural property claim litigated by a Southeast Asian nation in the United States. Later in life, Daulton has gained recognition as a result of the Daulton-Ho collection–a collection of European, East Asian, and African art belonging to Daulton and Roz Ho that includes the largest collection of Gabriel von Max works in the world. An expert for National Geographic, Daulton travels the world studying and giving lectures on art, architecture, and religion.[3] Daulton has two children and now resides in the San Francisco Bay area with his partner, software executive Roz Ho.


Education

Daulton received his B.S. from the University of California at Berkeley in 1978 and his J.D. from the UC Berkeley School of Law in 1981. Daulton later attended graduate school at Northern Illinois University where he studied the history of Southeast Asian art under the supervision of Professor Richard Cooler, then Director of the Center for Burma Studies, and studied the Burmese language under the supervision of Professor Saya U Saw Tun. During his time at NIU, Daulton researched, documented, and published the story of the relics of two of the Buddha’s main disciples, Sariputta and Moggallana, at the Kaba Aye Pagoda in Myanmar.[4]


Legal Case Recovering Stolen Buddha

In 1991, an ancient Buddha statue from a Burmese temple was identified in a Sotheby’s auction catalog by an NIU professor specializing in Burmese art, Dr. Richard Cooler. After the FBI tried unsuccessfully for 3 years to prove that the statue was stolen, they enlisted Dr. Cooler to help demonstrate the origins of the statue. Cooler contacted his former student, Daulton, both a specialist in Burmese art and a litigator, to represent Myanmar in the case. Daulton and Cooler were able to demonstrate that the statue, which had been broken off at the legs, matched up with the lower third of the statue that still stood in the temple in Myanmar.[5][6] The national treasure was returned with great gratitude from the Burmese government. The case was highly publicized, a reflection of growing interest in the return of stolen ancient cultural properties to their countries of origin.[7][8]


The Daulton-Ho Collection

The Daulton-Ho collection is an eclectic collection of art and artifacts from all over the world. The current acquisitional focus of the collection is symbolist art, of which the collection contains several notable works including "Hexenwald" ("Witch of the Woods") by Julie Wolfthorn, as well as the largest collection of Gabriel von Max works in the world. Pieces from the collection are frequently featured in exhibitions in Europe and the US. A 2011 exhibition at the Frye Art Museum in Seattle, Washington entitled Gabriel von Max: Be-tailed Cousins and Phantasms of the Soul featured the Daulton-Ho Collection’s many works by the artist.[9][10]
