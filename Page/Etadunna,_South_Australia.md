ETADUNNA is a locality in the Australian state of South Australia located about north of the capital city of Adelaide and about north-east of the town of Marree.[1]

The locality name was gazetted on 26 April 2013 in respect to “the long established local name” which is derived from the pastoral lease.[2][3]

Etadunna consists of a landscape that is described as an “extensive dunefield interrupted by large claypans grading into a large playa complex of salt lakes with gypsum dunes, and surrounding plain with channels and dunes.”[4] The Birdsville Track passes through the locality from south to north while the watercourse of Cooper Creek passes from east to west across its northern end. Features associated with the Cooper Creek watercourse include the northern end of Lake Gregory which is located in the locality’s south-eastern corner.[5][6][7]

Places of cultural and natural heritage significance located within the locality include the Coongie Lakes wetland system, the Killalpaninna Mission site, the Lake Palankarinna Fossil Reserve and the ‘shipwreck’ of the barge, MV Tom Brennan.[8]

The principal land uses within the locality are primary production and conservation with the former being associated with the grazing of cattle and the latter concerning the Coongie Lakes wetland system on the locality’s east side.[9][10][11]

Etadunna is located within the federal Division of Grey, the state electoral district of Stuart, the Pastoral Unincorporated Area of South Australia and the state’s Far North region.[12][13][14][15]
