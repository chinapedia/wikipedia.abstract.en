The Streflings immigrated to North America from Volhynia, Ukraine, in the late 1800s and early 1900s and primarily settled in Weesaw Township, Michigan; Kenosha, Wisconsin; and Rosthern, Saskatchewan. Many of the Streflings were instrumental in the founding of Lutheran Synods in America.

The Streflings immigrated to Volhynia (Volyn Oblast) during the reign of Catherine the Great. Russia’s Tsarina, Catherine the Great, was herself a German, and she invited the German people to join her in Russia.[4] Seeking religious freedom and the promise of fertile land and prosperity, the Strefling family immigrated to Russia in the late 1700s and early 1800s. The Streflings were Protestant Lutherans during a time period where there was a post-reformation resurgence of Catholicism resulting in religious conflicts in Germany. It was also the promise of religious freedom and the opportunity for prosperity that brought them to North America in the late 1800s and early 1900s during a time of secularization and political instability in Russia and Europe.

Volhynia was once a part of Russia, Belarus, Poland, and is now in the Ukraine. When the Strefling family immigrated to North America it was considered part of Belarus which translates to "White Russia" in English. It is not entirely known why the country was referred to as "White" but, the connotation has nothing to do with skin color.

Prior to living in Volhynia, the Strefling family likely had the surname Striefler and lived in the Saarland Bundesländer (Province) of Germany on the border with France. During this time (1700s) The Strieflers likely had close cousins in nearby England, France, and Belgium.
