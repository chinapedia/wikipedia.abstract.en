GIRLYBOI are an American folk pop duo originally from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 2015, Girlyboi started recording and performing in Europe as an "act of love".[1] After releasing three singles - "Actual Woman", "Whole", and "Bedside", Girlyboi released its debut EP, _Actual Woman_, on December 17, 2015 at Rough Trade Records in New York City.[2][3]

Girlyboi released its second EP, _Good Looks_, in 2016.[4]


Formation

After meeting in Chicago, Illinois, Matick and Russ fled their home to pursue their musical career. They moved to Paris to escape the influence of American Pop-Culture and began to form their sound.[5] In the midst of writing their first album, the couple were noticed by photographers and modeling agencies.[6] The fear of objectification and "being packaged" frustrated Matick, but ultimately fueled the lyrical content of their music, which is described as "raw and self-aware".[7][8]
