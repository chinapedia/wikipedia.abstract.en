GEORGES SALLES (24 September 1889 – 20 October 1966) was a 20th-century French art historian.


Biography

A specialist of the East, George Salles led excavations in Iran, Afghanistan and China. He was then curator at the Asian Arts Department of the Louvre Museum, and in 1941 director of the Guimet Museum. Speaking of the first General Conference of the ICOM, held in Paris in 1948, its president Georges Salles reported that "It has enabled a better understanding of the skills needed in our time by the curator of a museum if he/she is to fulfill h/h duties in a satisfactory manner." Between 1945 and 1957 he was director of the Museums of France. With Jean Cassou, he laid the foundations for a new design of the museum of modern art, to make art available to the greatest number. It is with his support that were made the ceiling by Georges Braque at the Louvre, the fresco of Pablo Picasso and the wall of Joan Miró at the UNESCO, all famous painters of whom he was a friend. Himself a collector, he bought works of young artists such as Mark Tobey. He published a _Histoire des Arts de l’Orient_, then _Au Louvre, scènes de la vie du musée_, and _Le Regard_ in 1939. With André Malraux, he headed the series L’Univers des formes.

In 1953, he joined the cultural council of the Cultural Circle of Royaumont.
