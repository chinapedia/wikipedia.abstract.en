_RegioIIRome2.png The REGIO II CAELIMONTIUM is the second regio of Rome, under Augustus's reform. It took its name from the Caelian Hill, which is one of the famous seven hills of Rome.


History

Under the reign of Tullus Hostilius, the entire population of Alba Longa was forcibly resettled on the Caelian Hill.[1] In Republican-era Rome the Caelian Hill was a fashionable residential district, site of residences of the wealthy. Archaeological work under the Baths of Caracalla has uncovered the remains of lavish villas complete with murals and mosaics. A significant area of the hill is taken up by the villa and gardens of Villa Celimontana. The Caelian Hill is the site of the Basilica of Santi Giovanni e Paolo and the ancient basilica of Santo Stefano Rotondo.


Subdivisions

The regio was divided into seven _vici_ (districts) and 3,600 _insulae_ (blocks). It had two curators and 48 Roman magistrates.[2]


Features

The regio contained seven _aediculae_ (shrines), 127 _domÅ«s_ (patrician houses), 27 _horrea_ (warehouses), 85 _balneae_ (bath houses) and 65 _loci_ (fountains).[3] It also contained the _ludus matutinus_, a gladiator school.[4]
