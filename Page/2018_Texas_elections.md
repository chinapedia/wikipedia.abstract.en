The 2018 GENERAL ELECTION was held in the U.S. state of Texas on November 6, 2018. All of Texas's executive officers were up for election as well as a United States Senate seat, and all of Texas's thirty-six seats in the United States House of Representatives. The Republican and Democratic Parties nominated their candidates by primaries held March 6, 2018. Convention Parties nominated their candidates at a series of conventions. County Conventions held March 17, 2018, District Conventions held March 24, 2018, and a State Convention held April 14, 2018.[1] At the present time there is only one Convention Party in Texas, that is the Libertarian Party. Other parties may seek to achieve ballot access.[2]

Turnout in the November general election reached historic levels, rivaling turnout in a presidential election.[3] While the Republican Party won every statewide position, the margin of victory was narrower than previous elections.[4][5][6]


United States Senate

U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke was running for election. Incumbent U.S. Senator Ted Cruz was running for re-election. Libertarian candidate Neal Dikeman was running for election.


United States House of Representatives

All of Texas's thirty-six seats in the United States House of Representatives were up for election in 2018.[7]


Governor

Incumbent governor Greg Abbott is running for a second term. He was first elected in 2014 after serving twelve years as Texas Attorney General, and he succeeded Rick Perry as governor.

Abbott won the March 20, 2018, Republican primary, while Lupe Valdez won the Democratic runoff against Andrew White, becoming the first Latina nominated by a major party for statewide office in Texas.

Libertarian Mark Tippetts also ran against Abbott. Tippetts defeated Kathie Glass, Patrick "Not Governor" Smith, and Kory Watkins at the party convention to earn his nomination.[8]


Lieutenant Governor

On January 9, 2017, the day before the 85th Texas Legislature began its session, incumbent Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick announced he would run for re-election in 2018.[9] He stated his early announcement was in order to dispel rumors that he would challenge Governor Greg Abbott or U.S. Senator Ted Cruz.[10]

-   Dan Patrick, incumbent lieutenant governor
-   Scott Milder, former City Councilman of Rockwall [11][12]

Democratic primary

-   Mike Collier, businessman, Finance Chair of the Texas Democratic Party and nominee for Comptroller in 2014.[13]
