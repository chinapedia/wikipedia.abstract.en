Future plans

The government of Tanzania has plans to build a grid-connected gas-powered electricity power station at Somanga-Fungu village near or at the location of the present installation. The new power plant will have installed capacity of 200MW to 400MW.[7] A financial adviser has been selected to advise government on the project.[8]
