A FIDDLE is a bowed string musical instrument, most often a violin.[1] It is a colloquial term for the violin, used by players in all genres including classical music. Although violins and fiddles are essentially synonymous, the style of the music played may determine specific construction differences between fiddles and classical violins. For example, fiddles may optionally be set up with a bridge with a flatter arch to reduce the range of bow-arm motion needed for techniques such as the double shuffle, a form of bariolage involving rapid alternation between pairs of adjacent strings.[2] To produce a "brighter" tone, compared to the deeper tones of gut or synthetic core strings, fiddlers often use steel strings. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles, which are typically aural traditions—taught 'by ear' rather than via written music.[3]

FIDDLING is the act of playing the fiddle, and FIDDLERS are musicians that play it. Among musical styles, fiddling tends to produce rhythms that focus on dancing, with associated quick note changes, whereas classical music tends to contain more vibrato and sustained notes. Fiddling is also open to improvisation and embellishment with ornamentation at the player's discretion—in contrast to orchestral performances, which adhere to the composer's notes to reproduce a work faithfully. It is less common for a classically trained violinist to play folk music, but today, many fiddlers (e.g., Alasdair Fraser, Brittany Haas, Alison Krauss[4], etc.) have classical training.


History

The medieval fiddle emerged in 10th-century Europe, deriving from the Byzantine lira (Greek: _λύρα_, Latin: _lira_, English: _lyre_), a bowed string instrument of the Byzantine Empire and ancestor of most European bowed instruments.[5][6]

The first recorded reference to the bowed lira was in the 9th century by the Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911); in his lexicographical discussion of instruments he cited the lira (lūrā) as a typical instrument of the Byzantines and equivalent to the rabāb played in the Islamic Empires.[7]

Lira spread widely westward to Europe; in the 11th and 12th centuries European writers use the terms _fiddle_ and _lira_ interchangeably when referring to bowed instruments.[8]

Over the centuries, Europe continued to have two distinct types of fiddles: one, relatively square-shaped, held in the arms, became known as the viola da braccio (_arm viol_) family and evolved into the violin; the other, with sloping shoulders and held between the knees, was the viola da gamba (_leg viol_) group. During the Renaissance the gambas were important and elegant instruments; they eventually lost ground to the louder (and originally less aristocratic) _viola da braccio_ family.[9]


Etymology

The etymology of _fiddle_ is uncertain: the Germanic _fiddle_ may derive from the same early Romance word as does _violin_, or it may be natively Germanic.

    _(as access to the OED online is not free, the relevant excerpt is provided)_ "The ultimate origin is obscure. The [Teutonic] word bears a singular resemblance in sound to its [medieval Latin] synonym _vitula_, _vidula_, whence [Old French] _viole_, Pr. viula, and (by adoption from these [languages]) [Italian], [Spanish], [Portuguese] _viola_: see [_viol_]. The supposition that the early [Romance] _vidula_ was adopted independently in more than one [Teutonic language] would account adequately for all the [Teutonic] forms; on the other hand, _*fiÞulôn-_ may be an [Old Teutonic] word of native etymology, although no satisfactory [Teutonic] derivation has been found."

The name appears to be related to Icelandic Fiðla and also Old English _fiðele_.[10] A native Germanic ancestor of _fiddle_ might even be the ancestor of the early Romance form of _violin_.[11]

In medieval times, _fiddle_ also referred to a predecessor of today's violin. Like the violin, it tended to have four strings, but came in a variety of shapes and sizes. Another family of instruments that contributed to the development of the modern fiddle are the viols, which are held between the legs and played vertically, and have fretted fingerboards.[12]


Ensembles

Musiciens_pub_Gus_O'Connor-Doolin.JPG In performance, a solo fiddler, or one or two with a group of other instrumentalists, is the norm, though twin fiddling is represented in some North American, Scandinavian, Scottish and Irish styles. Following the folk revivals of the second half of the 20th century, however, it has become common for less formal situations to find large groups of fiddlers playing together—see for example the Calgary Fiddlers, Swedish Spelmanslag folk-musician clubs, and the worldwide phenomenon of Irish sessions.[13][14]

Orchestral violins, on the other hand, are commonly grouped in sections, or "chairs". These contrasting traditions may be vestiges of historical performance settings: large concert halls where violins were played required more instruments, before electronic amplification, than did more intimate dance halls and houses that fiddlers played in.

The difference was likely compounded by the different sounds expected of violin music and fiddle music. Historically, the majority of fiddle music was dance music,[15] while violin music had either grown out of dance music or was something else entirely. Violin music came to value a smoothness that fiddling, with its dance-driven clear beat, did not always follow. In situations that required greater volume, a fiddler (as long as they kept the beat) could push their instrument harder than could a violinist. Various fiddle traditions have differing values.

Scottish fiddle with cello

In the very late 20th century, a few artists have successfully attempted a reconstruction of the Scottish tradition of violin and "big fiddle," or cello. Notable recorded examples include Iain Fraser and Christine Hanson, Amelia Kaminski and Christine Hanson's Bonnie Lasses[16], Alasdair Fraser and Natalie Haas' Fire and Grace.[17], and Tim Macdonald and Jeremy Ward's _The Wilds_[18].

Balkan fiddle with _kontra_

Hungarian, Slovenian, and Romanian fiddle players are often accompanied by a three-stringed variant of the viola—known as the _kontra_—and by double bass, with cimbalom and clarinet being less standard yet still common additions to a band. In Hungary, a three stringed viola variant with a flat bridge, called the _kontra_ or _háromhúros brácsa_ makes up part of a traditional rhythm section in Hungarian folk music. The flat bridge lets the musician play three-string chords. A three stringed double bass variant is also used.


Styles

To a greater extent than classical violin playing, fiddle playing is characterized by a huge variety of ethnic or folk music traditions, each of which has its own distinctive sound.

Europe

Great Britain

-   English folk music fiddling, including
    -   The Northumbrian fiddle style, which features "seconding", an improvised harmony part played by a second fiddler.
-   Scottish fiddling, including:
    -   Shetland fiddling, which includes trowie tunes said to come from peerie folk. The style is characterized by "ringing strings" and syncopated rhythms.
    -   A Lowland Scots tradition strongly influenced by baroque violin technique with staccato and Scotch snap bowing techniques in addition to the use of double stops.
    -   A Scottish Borders tradition with a repertoire heavy in hornpipes and with heavy use of double stops.
    -   A Highland tradition, highly influenced by the ornamentation and mixolydian scale of the Great Highland Bagpipe, as well as smoother bowing than other Scottish fiddle styles and a swinging of the 6/8 jig rhythm.
    -   An Orkney tradition with simpler bowing and ornamentation but with tunes featuring accidentals.[19]
-   Welsh fiddling (Welsh _Ffidil_; see Ar Log), a recently revived tradition.

Ireland

-   Irish folk music fiddling including:
    -   Donegal fiddling from the northwest in Ulster, which features mazurkas and a Scottish-influenced repertoire including Strathspey and Highland Fling dances. Fiddlers tend to play fast and make heavy use of staccato bowing and may from time to time "play the bass," meaning a second fiddler may play a melody an octave below where a first fiddler is playing it.
    -   Sligo fiddling from northern Connacht, which like Donegal fiddling tends to be fast, but with a bouncier feel to the bowing.
    -   Galway fiddling southern Connacht, which is slower than Sligo or Donegal traditions, with a heavier emphasis on ornamentation. Additionally, tunes are occasionally played in Eb or Bb to match the tonality of flat pipes.
    -   Clare fiddling from northern Munster, which tends to be played near the slower Galway tempo yet with a greater emphasis on the melody itself rather than ornamentation.
    -   Sliabh Luachra fiddling from the southwest in Munster, characterized by a unique repertoire of polkas and slides, the use of double stops and drones, as well as playing the melody in two octaves as in Donegal.[20]

Nordic countries

-   Norwegian fiddling (including Hardanger fiddling; see also Bygdedans and Gammaldans), including traditions from:
    -   Røros and Nord-Noreg styles, both using the standard fiddle.
    -   Finnskogen, using the standard fiddle, but featuring some flatted notes influenced by Finnish folk music.
    -   Voss and Telemark styles, both using the Hardanger fiddle.
    -   Setesdal, which uses both standard and Hardanger fiddles.
-   Swedish fiddling (including Låtfiol playing; see also Spelmanslag and Gammaldans), including traditions from:
    -   Jämtland
    -   Dalarna
-   Finnish fiddling, including the regional styles of:
    -   Kaustinen
    -   Ostrobothnia, heavily influenced by Swedish fiddling.
