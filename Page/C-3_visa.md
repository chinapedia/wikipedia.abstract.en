The C-3 VISA is a non-immigrant visa which allows governmental officials and their families, attendants, servants and employees to travel to United States for the purpose of transiting through the country.[1] The maximum duration of stay is 29 days.[2]

To qualify, the applicant must possess the ticket necessary to reach their destination and the funds necessary to complete transit. Since there is no dependent visa class, each member of a group must apply separately for a C-3 visa. Individuals who are younger than 13 or older than 80 are usually not required to attend an interview with US consular officers, although this may be required at their discretion.[3]
