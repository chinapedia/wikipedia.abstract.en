_LITORIA BELLA_ is a species of frog in the family Hylidae, first found in Cape York Peninsula. The species is most similar to _L. gracilenta_ and _L. chloris_, but can be distinguished from its cogenerates by having a large male body size (between ), a "near-immaculate" green dorsum, an orange venter, its bright orange-coloured digits and webbing, the purple lateral surfaces of its thighs, by lacking a canthal stripe, its white bones, and a single-note male advertisement call. _Litoria bella_ inhabits rainforest and monsoon vine thicket near water.[1][2]
