Click discovers that a former lawyer William Reardon (Otto Kruger) who disappeared several years before is now living on the street. When the story and her photos are published, William Reardon sued the magazine. Click decides to meet with William and asks him to dismissed the lawsuit. William explains to Click that he quit his law practice after convicting an innocent man and sending him to the electric chair. William agreed to drop the lawsuit when Click offers to find the man's daughter and make restitution. Click learns that the man's daughter died in a car accident and persuades Betty Clarke, her roommate and an actress to pretend to be the man's daughter.

William meets Betty and drops his lawsuit, with the story making the newspaper headline. However, Mike Romero (Bernard Nedell) who works for a gangster named Tony Mitchell (Richard Lane) knows the truth and decides to blackmail Betty. Click plans to expose Tony Mitchell's protection racket. William who is now working as a lawyer again is helping Click. They plan to gather enough evidence of Mike's illegal activity to arrest him, with William and Click falling in love at the same time.

Reception

Frank S.Nugent of _The New York Times_ writes in his movie review: "Flash is not only the name of a picture magazine for which Glenda Farrell makes sensational photographs in a film called "Exposed," now at the Rialto. It is also the impossible space of time in which much of the important action coincidentally happens therein. For just with the innocent snapshot of a presumed Bowery bum Miss Farrell and her magazine set in motion a train of rapid-fire events which culminate in the round-up of a gang of racketeers, the regeneration of a demoralized lawyer and the tinkle of wedding bells. In short, "Exposed" is just another of those headlong reportorial melodramas which pause neither for breath, explanations nor a moment's cool reflection. It is not very true to Life."[4]
