Small-scale oil refining began in the United Kingdom in 1914.[11] Refining capacity increased during the inter-war period. By 1938 there were 11 oil refineries in the UK.[12][13]

  : UK planned new refineries 1973

Following the oil crisis of 1973-4 refining capacity, and the number of oil refineries, was reduced, and many planned refineries were discontinued. In 1976 there were 17 oil refineries in the UK.[21] By 2000 there were 12 refineries namely:[22]

-   BP Amoco, Coryton refinery (later Petroplus, closed 2012)
-   Carless, Harwich refinery (now Haltermann Carless)
-   Phillips 66, Humber refinery
-   Total, Lindsey refinery
-   Petroplus, North Tees refinery (closed 2012)
-   BP Amoco, Grangemouth refinery (PetroIneos from 2004)
-   Nynas, Dundee refinery (closed 2013)
-   Shell/Nynas, Eastham refinery (closed after 2010)[23]
-   Shell Stanlow refinery (Essar Energy from 2011)
-   Amoco, then Murco, Milford Haven refinery (closed 2015)
-   Texaco, Pembroke refinery (Valero from 2011)
-   Esso, Fawley refinery

Further oil company re-organisations and take-overs, and reductions in demand, led to further refinery closures. By 2019 there were 6 major and one smaller oil refineries in the UK.


Organisations

Statistics for petroleum refining in the UK are gathered by the United Kingdom Petroleum Industry Association (UKPIA), on Chancery Lane in London, and the recently formed (July 2016) Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The Energy Institute is headquartered in Marylebone. The Institute of Petroleum merged with the Institute of Energy in 2003. Close to the Energy Institute is the World Petroleum Council (WPC), known for its four-yearly World Petroleum Congresses.
