_LET ME ENTERTAIN YOU_ is a studio album by French singer Amanda Lear, released in May 2016 by the independent label Boomlover.


Background

The album was recorded at Studio Richer in Paris from September 2015 to February 2016. Stylistically, it is a diverse collection of ballads and uptempo pop/dance tracks. It includes some new material written by Lear herself and her collaborators Gaël Brusseleers and Bob Landser, alongside the re-recordings of her 70s hits "Follow Me" and "Fashion Pack" as well as cover versions of Charlie Chaplin's "Smile", Frankie Valli's "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" and the Village People's "Macho Man", among others. The physical edition came with a DVD of Amanda performing selected songs from the album.

Lear announced the album's release date on her social media in March 2016. The Italian ballad "Prima del tuo cuore" recorded with Gianluca De Rubertis (with whom Lear had collaborated on the song "Mai più" the previous year) was released as the lead single in late April 2016. The second single was "The Best Is Yet to Come", released shortly before the album in May 2016. "Catwalk" was chosen as the third single, released in early 2017, accompanied by multiple remixes. The album was a minor chart success in Italy and France.
