Dr HORMASJI DORABJI KANGA (9 April 1880 - 29 December 1945) was an Indian cricketer who played first-class cricket for the Parsis (sometimes spelt Parsees) cricket team between 1899 and 1921 as an all-rounder and opening batsman. He was the first Indian to score a double century in a first-class match, and the Kanga Cricket League is named after him. His older twin brothers Dinshaw and MD also played first-class cricket for Parsees.[1][2]


Career

In his cricketing career, Kanga played 43 first-class matches between 1899 and 1921.[3] In a match between Parsis and a Europeans cricket team at the Deccan Gymkhana Ground, Kanga scored his career best score of 233. In doing so, he became the first Indian to score a double century in a first-class match.[4][5] In 1911, Kanga was part of the All Indian team that toured the British Isles; the team played a number of county cricket and other first-class teams.[6][7] Kanga also played for the Hampstead Cricket Club in England.[8]

After his retirement, Kanga was the President of the Bombay Cricket Association 1930-31 and 1934â€“35, and was also vice-president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India from 1936 until his death in 1945.[9] In 1948, three years after his death, the Bombay Cricket Association created the Kanga Cricket League, a monsoon season cricket tournament that they named after Hormasji Kanga.[10][11]
