KILL THE THRILL is a French rock band, formed in 1989 in Marseille. The band consists of Nicolas Dick (lead vocals, guitar, programming), Marylin Tognolli (bass, programming, vocals), and Frédéric De Benedetti (guitar, vocals).[1]

Generally associated with the industrial music movement, the band has dabbled with a variety of sounds during its career, ranging from alternative rock, to ambient goth, to darker new wave, and heavy metal.[2] The band's musical eclecticism led to a cult following among its selective audience.[3][4][5] During its career, the band has also released records sporadically, including _Dig_ (1993), _Low_ (1996), _203 Barriers_ (2003), and _Tellurique_ (2005).[6]

Kill the Thrill also performed as a supporting act for bands such as Killing Joke, The Young Gods, Einstürzende Neubauten and Treponem Pal.[7]
