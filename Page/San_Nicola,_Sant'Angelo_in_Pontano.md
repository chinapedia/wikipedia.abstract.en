SAN NICOLA is a Roman Catholic church and former convent located in the town of Sant'Angelo in Pontano, province of Macerata, region of Marche, Italy.


History

The church and convent, dedicated to St Nicholas of Tolentino, were erected in the 13th century by the Augustinian order, but refurbished over the centuries. In the church is a cycle of frescoes by Domenico Malpiedi and a number of altarpieces along with elegant wooden choir stalls.[1] In 1600, a chapel dedicated to the saint, and holding his relics, was erected in a Baroque style.[2]
