Atmosfaerisk_spredning.gif In infrared astronomy, the J BAND refers to an atmospheric transmission window (1.1 to 1.4 um) centred on 1.25 micrometres (in the near-infrared).

Betelgeuse is the brightest near-IR source in the sky with a J band magnitude of −2.99.[1] The next brightest stars in the J band are Antares (−2.7), R Doradus (−2.6), Arcturus (−2.2), and Aldebaran (−2.1).[2] In the J band Sirius is the 9th brightest star.
