Critical Reception

Payola was well received by critics. DIY magazine called it a "staggeringly good collection of songs" and ruminated that the album "offers a compelling argument of the threesome as the most important and greatest UK band of the past 10 years" in a 9/10 review. In their 8/10 review, Virgin notes that "This release shows what a huge footprint The Cribs have made on the modern music scene." Q magazine referred to the album as "A reminder of their heartfelt commitment to a struggling underground ideal" in a 4 star review, whilst The Quietus called The Cribs "A national treasure". In a more mixed 6/10 review, Uncut magazine praised the bands ability to write a single, but refers to the b-side disc as "best left to the completists".
