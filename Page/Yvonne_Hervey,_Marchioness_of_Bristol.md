YVONNE MARIE HERVEY, DOWAGER MARCHIONESS OF BRISTOL (_n√©e_ SUTTON; born 1945),[1] is a British peeress, the widow of Victor Hervey, 6th Marquess of Bristol and the mother of the incumbent Frederick Hervey, 8th Marquess of Bristol as well as Lady Victoria Hervey and Lady Isabella Hervey.

Daughter of Anthony Sutton of Woodstock, The Glen, Farnborough Park, Kent, Sutton grew up in Farnborough, Kent. In 1974 she became the third wife of the 6th Marquess of Bristol.[2] In the late 1970s they moved to Monaco as tax exiles.[3] She became stepmother to the Marquess's two children from previous marriages, but had a difficult relationship with them, particularly John, the elder.[4]

By the 2000s, the Lady Bristol was dividing her time between Monaco and Britain, visiting the latter frequently. In 2010, with help from her son, she arranged for her late husband to be reburied in Ickworth Church alongside many other members of his family.[5][6] She has helped author Michael De-la-Noy with his research on the Hervey family.[7]
