EWUARE II (born October 20, 1953) was crowned the Oba of Benin on 20 October 2016.[1] He is the 40th Oba,[2] a title created for the Head of State (Emperor) of the Benin Empire at some time between 1180 and 1300.


Education

Eheneden Erediauwa[3] as he was known before becoming Oba of Benin attended Edo College in Benin from 1965 to 1967 and Immaculate Conception College from 1968 to 1970. He got his A-Level Certificate from South Thames College, London. He graduated with an Economics degree from the University of Wales, UK and holds a Master of Public Administration degree from Rutgers University Graduate School, New Jersey, USA.[4]


Career

He worked at the United Nations between 1981 and 1982. He also served as Nigeria's Ambassador to Angola and Sweden, with accreditation to Norway, Denmark and the Republic of Finland. He was also Nigeria's Ambassador to Italy.[5][6]


Reign

Ewuare II chose his name as tribute to the 15th-century Ewuare I.[7] Since his ascension to the throne, Ewuare II has worked closely with Godwin Obaseki, the governor of Edo State.[8] Like many of his predecessors, he has unsuccessfully demanded that the spiritually and historically important Benin Bronzes that were stolen in 1897 by the British Empire be returned to his people.[9]

In October 2017, he celebrated his first anniversary on the throne, with great participation by the local populace as well as several officials, politicians, and visitors from other parts of Nigeria such as Lagos, Calabar, and Jos. The Sokoto Sultanate Council and Ile-Ife's royal family also sent representatives to take part in the celebrations.[10]


Personal life

By the time he was crowned Oba, Ewuare was married to Princess Iroghama (Obazuaye N'erie), Princess Iyayiota (Obazuwa N'erie) and Princess Ikpakpa (Ohe N'erie).[11] He later wed more women.[12]
