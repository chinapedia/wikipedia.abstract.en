STEAM NAVIGATION ON LAKE COEUR D'ALENE lasted from the 1880s to the 1930s. More steamboats operated on Lake Coeur d’Alene than on any other lake west of the Great Lakes.[1] The high point of steam navigation was probably from 1908 to 1913. After that railroads, and increasingly automobile and truck traffic on newly built highways supplanted steam navigation, although some vessels continued to be operated unit the mid-1930s.


Operations

In September 1908, the Red Collar steamship line operated seven steamers on Lake Coeur d'Alene, which was 27 miles, running mainly in a north-south direction.[2] The main city on the lake was Coeur d’Alene, at the northern, downstream end. By 1908 the city of Coeur d'Alene was connected by steam and electric rail lines to Spokane, Washington, about 30 miles to the west. The lake varied from 50 to 400 feet deep, and with the adjacent navigable St. Joe River, formed a natural water route just over 60 miles long.[3]

In the summer months, in 1908, the Red Collar Line ran three trips daily on the lake to St. Maries, a 45-mile run,[4] and two trips daily to St. Joe.[5] In 1908, the steamer_North Star_, made the St. Maries run in 3 hours 40 minutes.[6]

The fast steamers _Flyer_ and _Idaho_ were operated on the 20 mile run between Coeur d’Alene and Harrison.[7] Winter service on the lake often required ice-breaking, which sometimes took as many as three steamers to force a passage through the ice.[8]

Sources of coal in the area included Rosyln and Rock Springs.[9]

Lack of regulation

There were no federal steamboat inspectors assigned to Lake Coeur d’Alene, and there were frequent races, overcrowding of vessels, instances of drunken crew members, including captains and pursers, and other hazardous actions.[10] Another dangerous practice was to haul dynamite at the same time as a vessel carried passengers.[11] However, there had been only one fatal loss of a steamboat, that of the first _Spokane_ in the 1880s on the St. Joe River, where five people had died.[12]

Competition

In the early 1900s, there was an intense rivalry on the lake and the rivers between two companies. One concern was the Coeur d’Alene and St. Joe Transportation Company, later known as the Red Collar Line, which had been formed by Joseph Clarence "J.C." White and Jim Spaulding and his son, Harry. The other company was White Star Navigation Co., also known as the White Star Line, which had been incorporated by Capt. George Reynolds and McDonald.

In 1903, the Red Collar Line built the 147 foot long side-wheeler _Idaho_, which was described as "luxurious." In response, the White Star Line built the _Boneta_, originally 96 feet long, but later lengthened by 25 feet.

In 1905, while operating on the St. Joe River under the command of Captain Reynolds, _Boneta_ was rammed and sunk by a rival steamer, the side-wheeler _Idaho_.[13] This occurred just upriver from the O-W R & N bridge over the St. Joe River.[14] Reynolds claimed that Idaho pursued him across the river with the intent of sinking _Boneta_. Capt. Jim Spaulding, of Idaho, said there was a confusion in signals.

A subsequent trial was not able to fix responsibility for the collision.[15] Because the steamers on Lake Coeur d’Alene were not subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Steamboat Inspection Service, no government investigation was made into the collision. _Boneta_ was raised and operating again for the White Star line in April 1907, making tri-weekly trips on the lake.[16] In 1908, the White Star Navigation Company sold out to the Red Collar Line, which now achieved a virtual monopoly over transportation on the lake. Its fleet in 1908 comprised _Idaho, Spokane, Colfax, Boneta, Flyer, Telephone, Georgie Oakes, North Star_, and _Milwaukie_. The company also operated 14 barges as well as the tugs _Rambler_ and _Bonanza_.


Points on the route

West side

Starting with the city of Coeur d’Alene, on the west side of the lake from north to south were the following points: Coeur d’Alene (city).[17] Cougar Creek, Casca Bay, Kid Island Bay, Mica Bay, Lyondale (as of 1912 terminus of railway leading west into Mica Mountains up Mica Creek), Del Cordo Bay, Loff's Bay, Len Landing, Black Rock, Rockford Bay, Windy Bay, Amwaco (a rail terminus after 1910), Farmington Landing, and Conkling Park and Hotel.[18] Amwaco was the terminus of the Lake Creek and Coeur d'Alene Railroad, completed in 1910.

The name of one place on the west side, a use of racially pejorative word to designate a geographical feature, was a sign of the racial attitudes of the time.[19]

Saint Joe River

At the far southern end of the lake, flowing in from an easterly direction, was the Saint Joe River, which was navigable for some distance.[20] The St. Joe river was about 2,100 feet elevation above sea level, and it was claimed that it was the highest navigable river in the world.[21]

The St. Joe river valley was about two miles wide where the river flowed into the lake, narrowing to about one-quarter mile at the head of navigation.[22] Within the valley, the river itself was reported to be at least 150 feet wide and 20 feet deep.[23]

Points on the river included Ramsdell, Hell's Gulch, Cosmos, St. Maries, Ducommon, St. Joe City, and Ferrell, or Ferrell's,[24] generally considered the head of navigation on the St. Joe. However, in 1896, the steamer Elk, under the command of Captain Reynolds, was able to reach Cottonwood Island, twelve miles upriver from Ferrell's.[25]

East side from south to Coeur d’Alene river

Starting from the mouth of the St Joe river and moving from south to north, points on the lake included: Lacon and Harrison.[26]

Harrison and the Coeur d’Alene River

Harrison was located at the mouth of the Coeur d'Alene River, which was navigable in part. Points on the river included Harrison was located at the mouth, then Springston, Medimont, Lane, Roselake, Old Mission, Cataldo, Kingston, and, at the head of navigation, Dudley.[27] In 1908, Harrison was described as "the gateway to the Coeur d’Alene mining district, which produces half the lead mined in the United States."[28]

East side from Harrison to Coeur d’Alene City

East Point, Powderhorn Bay, Half Round Bay, Carlin Bay and Carlin Creek, Turner Bay and Turner Creek, Driftwood Point, Echo Bay, Squaw Bay, Hill, Wolf Lodge Bay, Beauty Bay, Wolf Lodge, Bennet Bay, Silver Beach, and Sanders Bay.[29]


Steamboat graveyard

Five or more steamboats are sunk in 30 to 45 feet of water at Stevens Point.[30] These vessels are believed to be the remains of _Bonanza_, _Colfax_, _Harrison_, _Samson_, and _St. Maries_.[31] All were deliberately sunk.[32]

List of vessels

Amelia_Wheaton_ca_1885.jpg

-   _Amelia Wheaton_, sternwheeler, was the first steamer to operate on Lake Coeur d’Alene. Amelia Wheaton was built for the U.S. Army by C.P. Sorenson.[164] Construction began in 1878, and after many difficulties in obtaining materials and components, was finally completed in late 1880.

The steamer was named after a daughter of the post commander.[165] The first pilot of the _Wheaton_ was Private William J. Applebee, who had had 14 years experience in the navy.[166] Sorenson himself was made the first captain of the steamer.[167] Dimensions of the Wheaton vary. According to one non-contemporaneous source, _Wheaton_ was 86 feet long (exclusive of fantail), 14 feet beam. Another source gives a length of 100 feet long and 16 feet beam, which would likely have included the fantail and the guards.[168]). An 1888 source is perhaps most reliable, as it is a listing of the steamer for sale by the government. According to this source, the _Wheaton_ was 76 feet long, with a beam of 17 feet, and depth of hold of 4 feet.[169] In 1888, the lower cabin measured 8x14x57 feet.[170] The upper cabin measured 7.5x14x30 feet.[171] Twin steam engines each had an 8-inch bore and a 24-inch stroke. The engines generated about 40 horsepower in 1888.[172] The steamer's speed was said to be between 8 and 10 miles per hour.[173] Built by P.C. Sorenson.[174] _Amelia Wheaton_ was formally purchased by the government on August 24, 1880 for a price of $8,000.[175] The _Wheaton_ was however little used for the rest of the fiscal year, with operating expenses totally only $165.[176] Sold to private parties in 1888.[177] The sale was advertised as taking place on May 19, 1888, at 11:00 a.m., at Fort Sherman.[178] Removed from service in 1892, engines to sternwheeler St. Joe, hull abandoned.[179] Sometimes referred to as simply the _Wheaton_.

-   _Avondale_,[180] steam launch.[181] One of five steamers managed by C.B. King in April, 1896.[182] Spokane attorney George M. Forster, who owned _Imp_ in 1903, bought _Avondale_ in mid-summer of 1897 from C.B. King for use as a private yacht.[183] In operation July 4, 1899.[184] C.B. King is reported to have used Avondale on Hayden Lake before bringing the vessel to Lake Coeur d’Alene.[185]
-   _Belleville_, rebuilt from _Volunteer_, using the same cabins and pilothouse, by Johnson & Sorenson, launched Wednesday, June 26, 1895.[186][187] Length 58 feet, beam 9 feet, engines developed 12 horsepower.[188] Fred Wilson was the first captain of _Belleville_.[189] Operational in December 1897[190] One of five steamers managed by C.B. King in April, 1896.[191]
-   _Bessie_, Operational as of April 1905, in the Harrison area.[192] Built by Johnson Boat Works.[193]

-   _Bonanza_, tug, operated by Red Collar Line in March 1908.[194] Deliberately sunk at Three Mile Point.[195]
-   _Boneta_, sternwheeler, built by Johnson Boat Works and launched October 1904.[196] Originally _Boneta_ was 96 feet long with a beam of 18 feet. There were guards extending two feet out from the deck along the upper sides of the hull.[197] _Boneta_ was lengthened by 25 feet in 1906, also at Johnson Boat Works.[198] Acquired by People's Transportation Line (II) in September, 1907.[199] Owned by George Reynolds and E. Daniel McDonald, of the White Star Navigation Company in March 1908.[200]
-   _Bonnie Doone_, in operation July 4, 1899.[201] Built by Johnson Boat Works.[202] Owned by H.M. Strathern of the Post Falls Lumber Company.[203]
-   _Clipper_.[204] Deliberately burned on the lake in 1938.
-   _Colfax_, propeller, 100 feet long, built by Johnson Boat Works in 1902.[205][206] _Colfax_ was similar design to _Spokane_, but slightly larger.[207] Both were shallow-draft steamers built to service the flourishing white pine lumber trade on the lake. Both _Colfax_ and _Spokane_ were operated by captains George Reynolds and E.D. McDonald. _Colfax_ could carry 50 tons of ore. In 1903, _Colfax_, under ownership of Reynolds & McDonald competed with the newly built _Idaho_, but was soon acquired by _Idaho_'s owners, the Coeur d’Alene & St. Joe Transportation Company, later known as the Red Collar Line. Made daily or alternate daily trips on the lake in April 1907 for the Red Collar Line in conjunction with steamer _Wallace_.[208] Operated by Red Collar Line in March 1908.[209] Deliberately sunk at Three Mile Point.[210]
-   _Coeur d'Alene_, sternwheeler, built in 1883 by Capt. Z.J.

Corbin interests, sold again in 1888 to the Northern Pacific Railroad. Abandoned in 1890, with machinery and superstructure being used for _Georgie Oakes_.[218][219] Old hull tied to a piling near the Johnson Boat House at Coeur d’Alene city, where it sunk.[220]
-   _Corwin_, built in 1888 for Superintendent Jones of the Spokane water department.[221] Had a shallow draft for operating on the Spokane river, but was later transferred to Lake Coeur d’Alene.[222] Work was reported to have been completed as of April 1, 1892 on this steamer, with the vessel scheduled to go into regular service up the St. Joe River on Monday, April 4, 1892.[223] Owned by People's Transportation Co. in early 1893.[224] Sunk in shallow water by storm in early February 1893 while moored overnight at Coeur d’Alene city.[225] One of five steamers managed by C.B. King in April, 1896.[226] Also seen spelled _Corwine_ and _Korwine_.[227]

Ltd.[287][288] Reportedly launched February 20, 1903[289] but this cannot be correct, because construction was only started on April 17, 1903.[290] The hull was launched on June 20, 1903.[291] Idaho cost $45,000 to build.[292][293] Another source reports that Idaho was built by J.C. White and J.H. "Jim" Spaulding and his son Henry "Harry" Spaulding.[294] Idaho's engines generated 800 horsepower while turning side-wheels 22 feet in diameter.[295] The steamer could carry 1,000 passengers.[296] The engines were of an older "clack valve" type, and had been originally installed on a Mississippi river steamer.[297] Capable of 15 miles per hour speed.[298] Idaho made the 48 mile run from Coeur d’Alene city to St. Joe in three hours ten minutes, including a stop along the way at Harrison. Operated by Red Collar Line in March 1908.[299] Caught fire at Blackrock Bay and burned in 1915 when out of service and being used as a warehouse during the apple harvest.[300]

-   _Kootenai_, built in 1887, and was at the time the most powerful steamer on the lake,[311] _Kootenai_ carried ore from the mines to Coeur d'Alene city, where it was shipped by rail for refining.[312] To break ice, the hull was built of heavy planking sheathed with boiler plate. _Kootenai_ could break 10 inches of ice and still proceed at a good pace, or 20 inches at a slower rate. Still in service as of February 1893.[313] When the O.R.&N rail line was completed into the mining district in 1890, ore shipments on the lake fell off.[314] After being tied up for a year or two, the machinery was removed, and the unpowered hulk was sold to an attorney in the Harrison area, A.A. Crane.[315] This proved to be an unprofitable venture for Crane, who returned to legal work, and, later, was elected to the state legislature.[316][317] Kootenai was deliberately sunk at Three Mile Point, in 1898.[318]
-   _Laura Lyon_. Built by Sorenson and Johnson in 1895 (or, by another report, by J. Herbert Lyon.[319]) purchased by Peter W.

Advertised as part of the Perry steamboat concern in 1909.[334] According to another report, _Milwaukie_ was built for the Blackwell Lumber Company for passenger and freight and, after being used as a tugboat, was rebuilt as Bonnie Doone.
-   _Miss Spokane_, 120 feet long passenger vessel built in 1917 by the Red Collar Line to replace Georgie Oakes. Described as "luxurious and fast", _Miss Spokane_ was driven by twin propellers, each turned by a 300-horsepower Winton gasoline engine. The Red Collar Line intended to use the vessel to compete with the O-W R.& N. company's trains and its steamer, the sternwheeler Harrison. However, _Miss Spokane_ turned out to be expensive to operate, and the design was unsuitable for the lake, so after one year of operation, the vessel was removed from service, and was later converted to an excursion barge. Although the boat cost $45,000, its design was inspired by New York Harbor boats, which wasn’t right for the lake, for example, its propellors were constantly being damaged by logs.[335] Floated for a long time unused at a dock in Coeur d’Alene, until 1943, when the hulk was towed off to a beach and abandoned.[336] Later it was burned.[337]
-   _Mudhen_. Owned by a man named Billings, who was facetiously called "Commodore" in at least one report, _Mud Hen_ appears to have been based out of St. Maries in May 1892.[338] According to one historian, _Mudhen_'s only claim to fame was that she capsized during a windstorm in 1892 and nearly drowned Captain Billings and his family."[339]
