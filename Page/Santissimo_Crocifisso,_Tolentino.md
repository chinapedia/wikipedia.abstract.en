The CHURCH OF SANTISSIMO CROCIFISSO is a Roman Catholic church located in the town limits of Tolentino, province of Macerata, in the region of Marche, Italy.


History

The Capuchins had arrived in Tolentino around 1539, but began construction of this church only in 1589 under the patronage of Laura Zampeshchi, the widow of Alessandro Parisani, who donated the land for the church. The church was first consecrated in 1596 by the Capuchin order, under the titled of _Santa Maria of Constantinopoli_. Only in 1926 was the church rededicated to the _Most Holy Crucifix_.

The church has a single nave and three chapels only on one side. The main altar has a large wooden tabernacle carved by two monks in 1689. The church houses paintings depicting _Christ in Gesthemane_ (16th-century) by an unknown Flemish artist; a _Madonna and Child_ attributed to either Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, or a follower.[1]
