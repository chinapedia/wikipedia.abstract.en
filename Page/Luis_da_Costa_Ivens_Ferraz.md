Ivens Ferraz began to compete in show jumping events in 1917, winning his first Grand Prix in 1922. He was a member of the Portuguese equestrian team between 1925 and 1934, competing abroad in Nice, Madrid, Rome, Naples, Milan, San Sebastian and Barcelona.[1] He won the Grand Prix of Lisbon three times, in 1926 riding _Roussi_ and in 1927 and 1930 riding _Marco Visconti_, becoming the first three-time winner of the main jumping competition held in Portugal. He won in Madrid the Copa SM el Rey in 1928 riding _Marco Visconti_, a trophy that was handed to him by King Alfonso XIII and which until then had only been won by Spanish riders. He also won the Grand Prix of Madrid in 1930. In the 1928 Summer Olympics he and his horse _Marco Visconti_ finished sixth as part of the Portuguese show jumping team and 15th in the individual jumping competition.[2]
