History

The original Highway 97 was created in the 1926 renumbering from Highway 91 in Walnut Ridge to US 63.[2] In 1929, Highway 91 was realigned, replacing Highway 97.[3] The current Highway 97 was added to the state highway system by the Arkansas State Highway Commission between 1939 and 1940 following the completion of a new terrain Highway 8 between New Edinburg and Fordyce. Following completion, the old Highway 8 routing to Kingston was redesignated as Highway 97.[4][5]
