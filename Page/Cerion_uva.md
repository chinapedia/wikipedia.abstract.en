_CERION UVA_ is a species of air-breathing tropical land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Cerionidae, the peanut snails.[1]


Description

Shells of _Cerion uva_ can reach a length of 24 mm.[2] This species shows extensive, geographical variations in whorl size.[3] Moreover the shape of these shells change very much as well they grows. In the adults the shells are beehive-shaped and have an expanded outer lip.[4][5][6]


Distribution

This species is endemic to the islands of Aruba, Curacao and Bonaire- many populations are quite different in terms of morphology and represent diverse makeup of infraspecific taxa[7].
