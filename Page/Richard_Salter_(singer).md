RICHARD JEFFREY SALTER (Hindhead, Surrey, on November 12, 1943 – Karlsruhe, February 1, 2009) was an English baritone, known as a founder member of The Kings Singers before moving to Austria and Germany to take leading roles in many contemporary operas.[1]

After the Kings Singers' first concerts and recording in 1969, Salter was awarded a Richard Tauber Scholarship and moved to Vienna where he successfully established himself as an opera singer. Among his signature roles were Bernd Alois Zimmermann's _Requiem for a Young Poet_, Schoenberg's _Von heute auf morgen_, the baritone lead in operas by Manfred Trojahn and Wolfgang Rihm, the main character K. in Aribert Reimann's _Das Schloß_ after Kafka (1996), and Philip Glass' _Waiting for the Barbarians_ (2005).
