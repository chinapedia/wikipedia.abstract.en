"ROWCHE RUMBLE" is a 1979 song by British post-punk band the Fall, written by Mark E. Smith, Craig Scanlon and Marc Riley. Released as the band's third single, it was the first record by the Fall to reach a recognised national chart when it reached number 31 on the indie chart in January 1980, the first month of that chart's existence.

The song was recorded at Cargo Studios in Rochdale in June 1979 by the band, at that time comprising Smith (vocals), Scanlon (guitar), Riley (guitar), Steve Hanley (bass), Yvonne Pawlett (keyboards), and Mike Leigh (drums). It was produced by Oz McCormick and the band.[1] Its lyrics reputedly reference an incident when Smith worked as a shipping clerk dealing with the Roche pharmaceutical company, and as a result of a clerical error acquired a supply of barbiturates which he attempted to hide around Manchester.[2]

The record received positive reviews, with Ned Raggett at Allmusic describing it as "both a highlight of the young band's career and a clear signpost toward much it would do in the future".[3] It was placed at number 21 among the year's top tracks by the _NME_,[4] and number 40 in John Peel's "Festive Fifty" in 1979.[5]
