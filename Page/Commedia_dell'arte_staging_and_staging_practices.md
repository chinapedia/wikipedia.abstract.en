_COMMEDIA DELL'ARTE_ began in the 16th century.[1] When it began it was performed outside in _piazzas_,[2] in theatres,[3][4][5] and in public meeting halls and courts.[6][7]

With indoor stages there were several to choose from. With the rise in popularity of _commedia_ also came the rise in theatre technology.[8] This new technology was not always available to all _commedia_ troops, but when it was they often took advantage of it.[9] Also with the rise in popularity, communities made ways to aid these troupes. Private homes were converted as well as town halls.[10] When the troupes went to Europe they used what theatres they could find and would also try and build new ones to continue aiding the art.[11]

Out door stages were utilized by dramatizing their daily lives. Where merchants had to try and get the peoples attention from the stage.[12][13] They often had a backdrop to show a general location.[14] Some scholars debate weather or not these troupes were the worst of all.[15] This could have played a part in deterring people from performing in the street due to this stigma.[16] This stigma grew so much that Isabella Andreini to write to the Governor of Milan complaining about them.[17]

The earliest knowledge that we have is when Ferdinand, a son of the Duke of Bavaria, Albrecht V, went to Florence for a wedding.[18][19]
