Novels

Female presidents of the United States have often appeared in science-fiction novels. In the 1959 science-fiction novel _Alas, Babylon_ by Pat Frank (the pen name of Harry Hart Frank) President Josephine Vannebuker-Brown, formerly the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, becomes president of the United States because she was the only member of the line of succession to survive nuclear war; this novel was one of the first apocalyptic novels of the nuclear age and consistently ranks in Amazon.com's Top 20 Science Fiction Short Stories list (which groups together short story collections and novels).[68][69] Other science-fiction novels which feature female presidents of the United States include K.A. Applegate’s 2001-2003 series _Remnants_, Arthur C. Clarke and Stephen Baxter’s 2005 _Sunstorm_ and 2001 _The Light of Other Days_, Jack McDevitt’s 1998 _Moonfall_, Robert J. Sawyer’s 2013 _Red Planet Blues_, John Shirley's 1985, 1988, and 1990 cyberpunk _Eclipse Trilogy_ of novels, Allen Steele's 2002, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 _Coyote_ series of novels, and Robert Anton Wilson’s 1979 _Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy_ of novels.[70][71][72][73][74][75][76][77][78][79][80][81]

There is also a female president of the United States in the non-science-fiction novels _Shall We Tell the President?_ (1977) and _The Prodigal Daughter_ (1982), both by Jeffrey Archer, _First Hubby_ (1990), by Roy Blount, Jr., and _The Woman President_ (2016), by Erwin Hargrove; in _The Prodigal Daughter_, _First Hubby_, and _The Woman President_ the female president obtains her position through the death of the former president.[82][83][84][85] Archer got the inspiration for his female president character Florentyna Kane's political life and rise to the presidency in _The Prodigal Daughter_ from the real-life elections of Golda Meir, Margaret Thatcher and Indira Gandhi. _Shall We Tell the President?_ also by Archer, initially featured president Ted Kennedy, but following the success of _The Prodigal Daughter_ and a previous book featuring Kane in earlier life, called _Kane and Abel_, the character was changed to president Kane in later editions. Michael Bowen's novel _HILLARY!: How America's First Woman President Won The White House_ (2003) is about the fictional presidency of real politician Hillary Clinton.

Some American stand-up comedians, for example Ted Alexandro and Chaunté Wayans, have joked in their stand-up comedy about a fictional woman being president of the United States, and done an impression of such a woman.[86][87][88][89][90]
