NFLDraftScout.com ranked him the sixth best tight end out of the 102 available. He attended Harvard's Pro Day and was able to beat his combine time and numbers. Braunecker chose to stand on his combine numbers for his 3-cone drill, short shuttle, and bench press.[4] Braunecker went undrafted in the 2016 NFL Draft and was signed by the Chicago Bears after the draft.[5]
