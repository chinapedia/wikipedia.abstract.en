Jinggang, also known as "Weigang" (), is located at the northwest of Wangcheng District and was named so due to the general of Tang dynasty (618-907) Li Jing's (571-649) stationing here. Jinggang was firstly mentioned in _National Chorography_ (), which read: "Tang dynasty Li Jing fought against Xiao Xian stationing troops here."[4] In the Xianfeng period (1850-1861) of Qing dynasty (1644-1912), the Xiang Army led by Zeng Guofan (1811-1872) fought against the Taiping Army here. According to the _Changsha County Annals_ (), the book described Jinggang as "Tang dynasty Li Jing station troops here, the army doesn't commit the slightest offence against the civilians, the local people are very nostalgic for him and named the place after him."[5] From the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1912) to the Republican period (1912-1949), Jinggang was the well-known rice market in Hunan and distribution port of Huai salt.[6] It was one of the four rice market in Hunan and known as "Little Hankou".[7] By the end of 19th century, Jianggang had been over 90 rice shops, 5 money exchange shops, and numerous handicraft workshops and scissor-cut, woodworking, manual scale, iron forging, paper umbrella, manufacturing and other handicraft industries gave full play to their respective strong point.[8] Nearly all families on Granite Street were shops, the permanent resident population reached 40,000 and transient population exceeded 10,000.
