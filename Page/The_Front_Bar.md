History

The show, which airs from March to September during the AFL season, launched in 2015 as an online-only show on the official AFL website, AFL.com.au, although Molloy and Maher had previously worked together on _Before the Game_. In 2016, the Seven Network picked up the show, with episodes being split into two segments, with the first half being uploaded to AFL.com.au on Friday afternoon and the second half airing after the Friday night match on the Seven Network in the traditional AFL states and on 7mate in New South Wales and Queensland. Episodes were filmed at the All Nations Hotel in Richmond.[2]

In 2017, the show was renamed to _The Front Bar_ and extended to a one-hour studio-based format.[3] In April, the show moved to Thursday nights to go head-to-head with the Nine Network's long-running _The Footy Show_.[4] The series is produced by Front Bar Entertainment, with episodes generally featuring the hosts drinking Carlton Draught beer as they discuss the week's topics.[5] To date, the guest pool has included Matthew Richardson, Kevin Bartlett, Brian Taylor and _Herald Sun_ cartoonist Mark Knight, who is in charge of designing the paper's commemorative Premiership covers.

In 2018, during the AFL offseason, one of their editions centered on the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. Later that same year, they also did an episode that included nods to the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast.

The show consistently beat _The Footy Show_ in the ratings in the latter half of the 2017 season, and in 2018.[6]
