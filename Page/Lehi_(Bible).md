thumbthumb LEHI, also known as RAMATH LEHI,[1] is a place mentioned in the Bible.


History

The Book of Judges relates that Lehi was the site of an encampment by a Philistine army,[2] and the subsequent engagement with the Israelite leader Samson.[3] This encounters is famous for Samsons' use of a donkey's jawbone as a club,[4] and the name Ramath Lehi means Jawbone Hill.[5]

During the Israelite Monarchy Lehi was the site of another battle between Israel and Philistine forces. Here the text relates that Shammah the Hararite, (one of David's Mighty Warriors)[6] held his ground in a field of lentils, when the Israelites retreated.[7]


Location

The exact site of Lehi is unknown, but was within the territory of Judah.[8]
