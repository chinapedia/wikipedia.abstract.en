BASTARZ (Korean: 바스타즈 (_Baseutajeu_); stylized BASTARZ) is the first official sub-unit of the South Korean boy group Block B. Established in April 2015, the sub-unit consists of three members: Block B's two main dancers, B-Bomb and U-Kwon, and the rapper P.O. The sub-unit debuted with their first mini album, entitled _Conduct Zero,_ on April 14, 2015, released their second mini album, _Welcome 2 Bastarz,_ on October 31, 2016, and released their third, _I'm a Mess,_ on March 28, 2019.


Origin

Although the members of Bastarz initially said they were chosen out of Block B's seven members through a random draw of colored balls,[1] they later said that this was a joke, and that Seven Seasons' CEO chose them for the sub-unit.[2]


History

On April 5 and 6, 2015, Block B announced through solo teaser photos that P.O, U-Kwon, and B-Bomb would make up Bastarz. Though not a part of the sub-unit, Zico confirmed that he produced Bastarz' first title track.[3][4]

The sub-unit's album was released April 13, 2015, along with a video for the title track, "Zero for Conduct."[5] The album debuted at #3 on the Gaon album chart,[6] with the singles "Conduct Zero," "Charlie Chaplin," "Thief," "Nobody but You," and "Sue Me" debuting on the Gaon digital chart at #6, #24, #63, #65, and #76, respectively.[7]

Bastarz' "Conduct Zero" was nominated for five awards in 2015, including two MAMAs, two Seoul Music Awards, and a Melon Music Award for best dance performance.

In October 2015, Bastarz made their Japanese debut with the release of the CD single _Hinko Zero,_ which reached #20 on the Oricon chart.[8]

The following year saw Bastarz' second Korean release. The sub-unit's lead single "Selfish & Beautiful Girl," composed by P.O, was released on October 24, 2016.[9] A follow up single, titled "Make It Rain," composed by Dean, was released on October 31 along with the full _Welcome 2 Bastarz_ extended play,[10] which debuted at #6 on the Gaon album chart.[11] The following week, the sub-unit made a surprise video release for the song "That's Right," featuring the members filming each other as they travel.[12]

P.O received lyrics credits for all five songs on _Welcome 2 Bastarz_ and composition credits for "Selfish & Beautiful Girl," "That's Right," and "The Hidden Girl," while B-Bomb received both lyrics and composition credits for the song "Tightly."[13]

On April 29, 2017, Bastarz performed at the Korea Times Music Festival, held at the Hollywood Bowl.[14]

On May 20, 2018, Bastarz competed on the JTBC music show _Two Yoo Project Sugar Man._ Bastarz won the show with a remake of "An Alley," a song by Yang Dong-geun that itself was a remake of a song by Lee Jae-min.[15][16]

Two Bastarz concerts were announced February 23, 2019, to take place March 29 and March 30 in Seoul.[17]

Bastarz released their third mini-album, _I'm a Mess,_ on March 28, 2019.[18] The album contains eight songs, including three solo songs, and the group members were heavily involved in the production of the album:[19] P.O received lyrics credit for five songs on the album and composition credit for three, B-Bomb received lyrics credit for two songs and composition credits for three, and U-Kwon received lyrics and composition credit for one song.[20]
