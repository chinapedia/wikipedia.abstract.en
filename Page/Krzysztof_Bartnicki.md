Translator

Bartnicki's _Finneganów tren_ (2012) is world's 7th complete translation of James Joyce's _Finnegans Wake_. The translation, completed 1999–2012, won various awards, including the Literatura na Świecie Award (2012).

Bartnicki also translated _Finnegans Wake_ into a rotary business card holder (_Finnegans Meet_, with Marcin Szmandra, 2015)[1] and into a musical cryptogram (_Da Capo al Finne_, 2012).[2]

His intersemiotic translations of Joyce have been discussed in Ireland, Italy,[3] Poland,[4] UK,[5] USA etc.


Composer

In the musical output derived from the text of _Finnegans Wake_, Bartnicki's first publicly performed composition was _A Redivivus of Paganinism: Variations on a Text by Joyce upon Lutosławski's Variations on a Theme by Paganini_ (Częstochowa, The Lutosławski Year celebrations, 2013), the most frequently recurring, however, were his imitations of John Williams's themes for _Star Wars_.[6]
