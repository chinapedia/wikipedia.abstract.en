The CIRCLE BRIDGE (Danish: Cirkelbroen) is a pedestrian bridge spanning the southern mouth of Christianshavn Canal in the Christianshavn area of central Copenhagen, Denmark. It connects Applebys Plads to the south with Christiansbro to the north. The bridge was designed by Olafur Eliasson.


Construction

Description

The bridge consists of five round decks with masts of different heights. The masts are held up by 118 metal cables, giving the bridge a resemblance to a series of sailing yachts. The form highlights the reverse slope of the bridge's rails, which are made of wood from the Brazilian guariuba tree (_Clarisia racemosa_).[1]
