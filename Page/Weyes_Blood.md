NATALIE LAURA MERING (born June 11, 1988), known professionally as WEYES BLOOD (pronounced ), is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. Since 2010, she has released four albums and an EP.

Mering was primarily raised in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. She began her career as a member of the Portland, Oregon-based experimental group Jackie-O Motherfucker, and later toured with the Baltimore-based noise group Natural Almanac. She subsequently began recording her own material under the name Weyes Bluhd, later changed to Weyes Blood, inspired by Flannery O’Connor's 1952 novel _Wise Blood_.

After her self-released debut album, _The Outside Room_ (2011), she signed with the independent label Mexican Summer, releasing _The Innocents_ (2014) and _Front Row Seat to Earth_ (2016). She released her fourth studio album, _Titanic Rising_ (2019) on Sub Pop, to critical acclaim.


Life and career

1988–2002: Early life

Natalie Laura Mering[1] was born June 11, 1988 in Santa Monica, California,[2] into a deeply religious born again Pentecostal Christian family.[3] Commenting on her upbringing, Mering said: "I was raised in a real spiritual, Bible Belt household. So I developed my own cynicism because there are always things in the bible that really bum me out...  I became really obsessed with The Kids in the Hall as a kid, and they had Scott Thompson, who's like the one gay member. I remember having this feeling that "Oh, Scott Thompson isn't going to heaven? How could that be?" That was my first big tipoff that something wasn't quite right with dogmatic Christianity. And then I was just trying to undo it since the age of 12."[4]

Mering's family moved several times throughout her childhood; she spent her early life in the San Francisco Bay Area[5] before they settled in Doylestown, Pennsylvania in 1999, where she attended high school.[6] Both her older brothers and parents are musicians and music played an important part in her upbringing. Her father, Sumner Mering, is a musician and guitarist who was in a Los Angeles new wave band entitled Sumner in the late-1970s,[7] while her older brother, Zak Mering, is also a recording artist, producer and songwriter under the "Raw Thrills" alias.[8]

2003–present: Musical career

At the age of 15 Mering began using the moniker Wise Blood to write songs. She changed to Weyes Bluhd on several self released records before changing the spelling to Weyes Blood.[9][10] She took the name from the Flannery O'Connor novel _Wise Blood_.[11] After finishing high school, Mering relocated to Portland, Oregon to attend Lewis & Clark College, where she majored in music[12] and had a radio show on the campus radio station.[13] However, Mering dropped out after her first year of studies.[14] She subsequently began touring the underground music scene, performing as a bassist in the Portland-based band Jackie-O Motherfucker,[15] and later the Baltimore group Nautical Almanac.[16]

Weyes_Blood_04_04_2019_-7_(32641182727).jpg In 2011 she released the album _The Outside Room_ as Weyes Blood And The Dark Juices on Not Not Fun Records.[17][18] Uncut magazine described the album as "the vibe is devotional and ethereal, but with an edge",[19] while Beatbots found it "an impressive and ambitious album".[20] Natalie released her second record in October 2014 called _The Innocents,_ which was released through Mexican Summer.[21] It was recorded in rural Pennsylvania, Mering's apartment and Gary's Electric Studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.[22] It included contributions by Jacob Brunner (drums) and James Strong (bass).[23] Mering described the theme of the album as "it's about young love. It's about my first real relationship that went really awry".[24]

After the album's release, Mering relocated from New York to Los Angeles, California. She commented: "I was in New York alone: no friends, no money, no record deal at the time. Literally I had nothing."[25] In 2016, she released her third album _Front Row Seat to Earth_, on Mexican Summer to critical acclaim, and toured throughout Europe and the States.[26] NPR wrote that the album reexamines "intimacy and idealism in ways that showcase Mering's gift for measuring and mediating heady emotions."[27] Mering stated the songs on the album were largely inspired by the isolation she felt while living in New York.[28]

On February 12, 2019, a new album titled _Titanic Rising_ was announced and available to pre-order on her website, along with dates of her upcoming tour.[29] The album was released by Sub Pop on April 5, 2019 to critical acclaim.[30]


Influences

Mering has stated that church music, which figured prominently in her upbringing, has been an influence on her songwriting.[31] "Most of the great classical music and early music of our time is written for God in a sacred space," she said. "So sacred music and sacred space music — that was my favorite thing about music. Not so much content-wise. Not so much the theory and concept of God, but just the idea that we've built this gigantic, stone cathedral palace for people to sing in...  When I record, I think about sacred space and I think about what would be the sound of your soul if there is music coming out of it. It would probably be an echoey, strange chamber."[32]
