The MIDLANDS COMEDY AWARDS are an annual awards ceremony for live comedy performers and comedy clubs based in The Midlands region of England. It also recognises achievement in online comedy. They were founded in 2014 and give out awards in eleven categories every year.


History

The Midlands Comedy Awards were created by Birmingham-based comedian Jay Islaam in 2014, "to recognise the huge number of hard working and talented people in [the] regional comedy community".[1][2][3]


Rules and eligibility

The finalists for the awards are chosen by comedy clubs and media professionals from the Midlands region, and only comedians and comedy clubs based in either the East Midlands or West Midlands qualify. This means that comedians resident in The Midlands are eligible even if they are originally from elsewhere. The awards accept the definition of East Midlands and West Midlands as the areas represented in the European Parliament by those constituencies.[4]
