Career

Born in Holzwickede the oldest child of the guitar player Thomas Brendgens-Mönkemeyer and his wife Heidemarie Mönkemeyer, he first studied the violin at the Hochschule für Künste Bremen. He switched to the viola in 1997, inspired by chamber music.[1] He studied viola at the Musikhochschule Hannover with Christian Pohl.[2] He continued his studies at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater München with Hariolf Schlichtig from 2000,[3] graduating in 2003 with a diploma "mit Auszeichnung".[4] He studied further from 2003 to 2004 at the Mozarteum in Salzburg with Veronika Hagen. He took his concert exam with Schlichtig in 2006, again "mit Auszeichnung". [5]

Mönkemeyer first played an Italian viola by Giuseppe Cavaleri from 1742, a loan from the Landessammlung Rheinland-Pfalz. He plays now an instrument built by Peter Erben, Munich.[6] For his first CD, _Ohne Worte_, he chose songs by Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann, playing them "without words", accompanied by Nicholas Rimmer. On his second CD, _Weichet nur, betrübte Schatten_, he recorded viola concertos by Antonio Rosetti and Franz Anton Hoffmeister, the Rosetti a premiere recording.[7] He added arrangements of five vocal movements from Bach cantatas, for example the opening aria from the secular cantata for soprano solo _Weichet nur, betrübte Schatten_, BWV 202.[8]

He was awarded many prizes, including in 2006 both the first prize of the International Yuri Bashmet Competition and the prize of the _Deutscher Musikwettbewerb_.[9] In 2009 he was appointed professor of viola at the Hochschule für Musik Carl Maria von Weber Dresden.
