COMIC FANTASY is a subgenre of fantasy that is primarily humorous in intent and tone. Usually set in imaginary worlds, comic fantasy often includes puns on and parodies of other works of fantasy.


Literature

The subgenre rose in the nineteenth century. Elements of comic fantasy can be found in such nineteenth century works as some of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales, Charles Dickens' "Christmas Books", and Lewis Carroll's Alice books.[1] The first writer to specialize in the subgenre was "F. Anstey" in novels such as _Vice Versa_ (1882), where magic disrupts Victorian society with humorous results.[2] Anstey's work was popular enough to inspire several imitations, including E. Nesbit's light-hearted children's fantasies, _The Phoenix and the Carpet_ (1904) and _The Story of the Amulet_ (1906).[3] The United States had several writers of comic fantasy, including James Branch Cabell, whose satirical fantasy _Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice_ (1919) was the subject of an unsuccessful prosecution for obscenity.[4] Another American writer in a similar vein was Thorne Smith, whose works (such as _Topper_ and _The Night Life of the Gods_) were popular and influential, and often adapted for film and television.[5] Humorous fantasies narrated in a "gentleman's club" setting are common; they include John Kendrick Bangs' _A Houseboat on the Styx_ (1895), Lord Dunsany's "Jorkens" stories, and Maurice Richardson's _The Exploits of Englebrecht_ (1950).[6]

According to Lin Carter, T. H. White's works exemplify comic fantasy,[7] L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt's Harold Shea stories are early exemplars. The overwhelming bulk of de Camp's fantasy was comic.[8] Pratt and de Camp were among several contributors to _Unknown Worlds_, a pulp magazine which emphasized fantasy with a comedic element. The work of Fritz Leiber also appeared in _Unknown Worlds_, including his Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories, a jocose take on the sword and sorcery subgenre.[9]

In more modern times, Terry Pratchett's _Discworld_ books, Piers Anthony's _Xanth_ books, Robert Asprin's _MythAdventures_ of Skeeve and Aahz books, and Tom Holt's books provide good examples,[10] as do many of the works by Christopher Moore. There are also comic-strips/graphic novels in the humorous fantasy genre, including Chuck Whelon's Pewfell series and the webcomics _8-Bit Theater_ and _The Order of the Stick_. Other recent authors in the genre include Toby Frost, Stuart Sharp, Nicholas Andrews, and DC Farmer, and the writing team of John P. Logsdon and Christopher P. Young.


Other media

The subgenre has also been represented in television, such as in the television series _I Dream of Jeannie_, _Kröd Mändoon_. Examples on radio are the BBC's _Hordes of the Things_ and _ElvenQuest_. Comic fantasy films can either be parodies (_Monty Python and the Holy Grail_), comedies with fantastical elements (_Being John Malkovich_) or animated (_Shrek_). It has also been used in the movie _Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle_.
