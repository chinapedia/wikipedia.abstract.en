Critical response

A review by _The Hollywood Reporter_ described it as "a scattered intro that offers some history and introduces a few of the players who are currently big on the scene, but hardly inspires a disinterested viewer to drop everything and set the DVR for the next UFC bout. Some faithful fight fans may rally for the doc's theatrical bookings, but even on VOD, it promises to underwhelm most for whom the names Jon Jones and Sara McMann mean something."[1]
