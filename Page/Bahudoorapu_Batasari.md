_BAHUDOORAPU BATASARI_ () is a 1983 Telugu drama film, produced and directed by Dasari Narayana Rao[1] under his Taraka Prabhu Films banner.[2] It stars Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Sujatha in the lead roles[3] and music composed by Ramesh Naidu.[4] The film was recorded as a _Super Hit_ at the box office.[5]


Plot

Prasad (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) is a sincere and idealist police officer. His friend Avataram (Dasari Narayana Rao) is the complete opposite. He is just a man of fake words who survives on empty promises. Prasad's wife (Sujatha) is a good-natured woman. Avataram's wife Sahastrakoti Suryaprabha (Ramaprabha) is an innocent lady. She is too gullible and believes whatever her husband tells her. Prasad respects his father (Gummadi) a lot. Avataram, on the other hand, throws his father (Allu Ramalingaiah) out of the house and tells everyone that his father is dead. Prasad has two sons (Bhanu Chandra, Raja) and a dumb daughter (Suhasini). Despite looking after his kids so well and getting them married to their right choices, his children abandon Prasad and his wife. To make things worse, Prasad's father dies. It is when an affluent man (Vankayala) is rescued by Prasad in a dangerous situation. The former gives all the property responsibility to Prasad. At the same time, Prasad's kids fall into a financial crisis and request their father to help. But Prasad refuses to do so. Finally, Prasad gives all the property to his children and leaves the house as a distant nomad (Bahudoorapu Baatasari). Avataram's story also moves in parallel with Prasad's as his father returns home and teaches the former a lesson along with his grandchildren.
