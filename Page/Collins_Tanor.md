COLLINS TANOR (born 4 January 1998 in Brong-Ahafo, Ghana) is a Ghanaian footballer who plays as a central midfielder for Manchester City.


Early career

Coming from Brong-Ahafo of Ghana, Tanor started out at the Right to Dream Academy since joining on a student-athlete scholarship at the age of 10. During his time at the Academy, Collins captained the Ghana U17s – leading them to a four-nation tournament victory in 2014. He also guided the RtD Academy U18s to a second successive victory in the Gothia Cup in Sweden.[1] In 2014, Tanor played in the Al Kass U17 International Cup in Qatar with Manchester City U17.

As a result, he would train and eventually sign with the club.[2]


Club career

FC Nordsjælland (loan)

On 28 January 2016 it was confirmed, that Tanor had signed a season long loan deal with Danish Superliga-side FC Nordsjælland.[3] He started the first five months at the club, playing for the reserve side.[4]

Tanor got his FC Nordsjælland debut on 9 May 2016, where he played 45 minutes, before getting replaced by Godsway Donyoh in a 1–2 defeat against Brøndby IF in the Danish Superliga.[5] He went on to make two appearances at the end of the 2015-16 season.[6]

In the 2016-17 season, Tanor started the whole game, where the club beat AB Taarnby 4-1 in the second round of the Danish Cup.[7] However, Tanor did only play 2 matches in the start of the 2016/17 season as a substitute, due to some problems with his stomach. He was diagnosed with sport hernia in his stomach, and was out in 6 months due to an operation.[8] He made his rehabilitation in Manchester, before returning to Denmark again.[9] After he returned in April 2017, he began playing for the U19 squad. He was for example with the U19 squad in Düsseldorf, where they played a friendly tournament.[10] It wasn't until on 29 May 2017 when he made his return to the first team, coming on as a second-half substitute, in a 2-1 win over Brøndby IF on the last game of the league's Championship round.[11]

In the 2017-18 season, Tanor started out playing in the reserve side for the most of the first half of the season and struggled to make a breakthrough in the first team.[12] As a result, on 31 January 2018, FCN terminated the loan deal with midfielder.[13]

KFCO Beerschot Wilrijk (loan)

After his two-years loan spell at FC Nordsjælland came to an end, Tanor left Manchester City when he joined KFCO Beerschot Wilrijk on a loan-contract until the end of this season, with an option for another year.[14]

Tanor made his KFCO Beerschot Wilrijk debut, where he came on as a substitute later in the second-half, as they drew 1-1 against Oud-Heverlee Leuven on 16 February 2018.[15]

Hobro IK (loan)

On 31 August 2018, Hobro IK announced, that they had signed Tanor on a loan-contract for the rest of the season.[16]

Thisted FC (loan)

Tanor and Hobro interrupted the loan deal, and was loaned out to Thisted FC instead, for the rest of the season.[17]

Tanor's playing style is described as _"a great talent who loves to control the game. He can either play as number 6 or 8 in the midfield. He is very energetic and thoughtful in his episodes."_[18]
