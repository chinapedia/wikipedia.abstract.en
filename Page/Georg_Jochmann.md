GEORG JOCHMANN (11 October 1874, in Liegnitz – 6 January 1915, in Berlin) was a German internist and bacteriologist, who specialized in infectious diseases.

In 1898 he received his medical doctorate at the University of Freiburg, and following graduation, worked as an assistant to Bernhard Fischer at the institute of hygiene in Kiel. Afterwards, he worked in the department of internal medicine at Hamburg-Eppendorf Hospital under Theodor Rumpel, and at the university medical clinic in Breslau under Alfred Kast and Adolph Strümpell. In 1904 he obtained his habilitation for internal medicine at the University of Breslau.[1][2]

In 1906 he was named head of the department of infections at Rudolf-Virchow-Krankenhaus in Berlin, and four years later received the title of professor. He died in 1915 at the age of 40 from spotted typhus, contracted while treating Russian prisoners of war.[3][4]
