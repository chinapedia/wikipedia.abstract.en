_The Historian_ garnered mixed receptions from the few critics that reviewed it.Reviews of _The Historian_:

-   -   -   -   -   Ben Kenigsberg of _The New York Times_ stated, "Despite low production values, _The Historian_ [...] sustains curiosity over what [...] is a long running time."[21] Serena Donadoni of _The Village Voice_ derides Doleac as "a filmmaker [who] can't reconcile all his story lines."[22]

Also 2014, Doleac became the executive director of FestivalSouth Film Expo at the Grand 18 theater in Hattiesburg.[23][24] He was asked to join the team organizing the festival by Mike Lopinto, FestivalSouth's artistic director. Doleac was tasked with organizing the festival line-up and acquiring celebrity guests to fill the festival's panels. The festival features, but is not limited to, films that have either been filmed in Mississippi or made by Mississippians.[25]

In 2014 and 2015, Doleac appeared in two episodes of FX's _American Horror Story._[26][27] In 2015, he had guest appearance roles in _Banshee,_ _Salem,_ and _Complications._[28][29][30] He also appeared in _The Astronaut Wives Club_ and the film _Vacation._[31][32] In May 2015, he starred in a production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's _Jesus Christ Superstar._ He swapped between the roles of Jesus Christ and Judas Iscariot with co-star Joseph VanZandt throughout the four days of performances.[33]

The film received mixed reviews from critics. In particular, Noel Murray of Los Angeles Times said the "While the dialogue is colorful and the acting strong, this is ultimately a 90-minute neo-noir stretched unnecessarily past two hours." Expressing a more positive opinion, Sherilyn Connelly of SF Weekly stated that "Miles Doleac's _The Hollow_ is a fun little genre potboiler that gets it right."References for reviews of _The Hollow_:

-   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   That same year he directed and starred in a production of Kander and Ebb's Cabaret (as 'the Emcee').[48]

Demons received a number of favorable reviews from critics. Charlotte Hollingsworth at Morbidlybeautiful.com said "Overall, Demons is an excellent film that brings something fresh to the exorcism genre."[59] Demons received mostly positive reviews, although Noel Murray of the Los Angeles Times had this to say, "The ambitious auteur is getting better at making his novelistic ideas punchy and cinematic, but "Demons" is still a B-movie that takes itself too seriously ... Still, Doleac's forging a niche. His name on a picture is now an indication that genre fans will see something different …".[60]

Doleac also appears as a guest vocalist on the 2017 Grammy winning album by thrash metal band Megadeth, Dystopia (Megadeth album), performing the Latin voiceover in the instrumental, "Conquer or Die!" [61]
