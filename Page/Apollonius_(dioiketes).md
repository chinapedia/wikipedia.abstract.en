APOLLONIUS (or APOLLONIOS, ; 3rd century BC) was the _dioiketes_ or chief finance minister of Egypt during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (r. 283–246 B.C.). Little is known about his personal life; in ancient documents, he is called simply "Apollonius the _dioiketes_" without recording his home city or his father's name.[1] But a great amount of information has survived about his public role, in the archive of papyri kept by his assistant Zenon.

Apollonius was _dioiketes_ from about 262 to 245 B.C. As well as his official role, he was an important merchant and land-owner. He owned estates both abroad in Galilee and in Philadelphia in Egypt.[2] In 252 B.C. he accompanied Berenice, the daughter of Ptolemy, as far as Sidon before her marriage to the Seleucid king Antiochus II.[3] Although the extent of his influence over the king's policies has been disputed, [4] it was during his term of office that the economic and administrative system of the Ptolemaic Kingdom was fully developed, which made the kingdom by far the most prosperous of the Hellenistic states.[5]

As _dioiketes_ he was succeeded by Sosibius.
