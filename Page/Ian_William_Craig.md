IAN WILLIAM CRAIG (born 1980)[1] is a Canadian musician known for using broken tape machines. He is based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Craig was classically trained in vocal performance and uses modified tape reels to distort his recorded voice. Music magazine _Rolling Stone_ compared his style to that of William Basinski, Grouper, and Anohni. His 2016 _Centres_ was the first release on FatCat's relaunched 130701 record label, which specializes in post-classical music and popularized the music of Max Richter and Hauschka.[2] The album received "universal acclaim", according to album review aggregator Metacritic.[3] _Rolling Stone_ described Craig as the most exciting experimental composer of 2016.[4]
