The 2001–02 BUSTA CUP was the 36th edition of what is now the Regional Four Day Competition, the domestic first-class cricket competition for the countries of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB). It was played from 25 January to 8 March 2002.

Eight teams contested the competition, which was played as a round-robin. The six regular teams of West Indian domestic cricket (Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Windward Islands) were joined by a development team (West Indies B) and an invited overseas team (Bangladesh A). Jamaica finished undefeated on the top of the table, claiming a sixth domestic first-class title.[1] The Busta Cup was followed by a brief knockout competition called the BUSTA INTERNATIONAL SHIELD. It was played from 15 March to 7 April, featuring the top four teams from the Busta Cup, and was won by Guyana.[2]
