PURWODADI BOTANICAL GARDEN is a research centre in Purwodadi, Pasuruan, East Java, Indonesia. It has an area of and more than 10,000 types of trees and many plant collections. Callus cultures of _Agave amaniensis_ by Setia Dewi were taken in 1988.[1]


History

The garden was established on January 30, 1941 by Dr. Gerhard Lourens Baas Becking Marinus from the initiative of Dr. Dirk Fok van Slooten as a division of Bogor Botanical Gardens. This garden is one of the three branches of the Botanic Gardens of Indonesia, with each having specific tasks and functions. The two other branches are Cibodas Botanical Garden and Bali Botanic Garden. Management of the entire botanical garden branch is under the responsibility of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences.

Initially, the gardens were used for plantation crop research activities. Then in 1954 the basics of a botanic garden began to be applied, with the establishment of patches of plant collections. From 1980 most of the plants were reorganized according to the Engler classification system. Purwodadi is a major centre of research on plant conservation and plants of dry climates in the tropics.
