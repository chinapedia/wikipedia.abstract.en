YOAST is a search-optimization firm based in Wijchen, Netherlands. It develops and supports a popular Yoast SEO WordPress plugin that had over 5 million active installations (as of October 2018).[1]


History

Yoast was created by Joost de Valk in 2005, originally as JOOSTDEVALK.NL.[2] After moving to and eventually selling the domain "css3.info", de Valk created the Yoast platform in 2009 and the company Yoast BV in 2010.[3][4]

Initially, Yoast focused on SEO consultancy.[5] In 2012, Yoast was expanded to offer a premium model for WordPress. It sold several plugins, with its most popular plugins being Yoast SEO for WordPress and Google Analytics for WordPress. As of April 2016, the Google Analytics for WordPress plugin was acquired by Syed Moiz Balkhi[6].

As of September 2018, Yoast employs almost 100 people, of which 85 are in Wijchen.[7]


Reception

Yoast has received praise for its extensive applications in SEO, both within and beyond its ubiquity as a WordPress plug-in, and for its accessibility as a freemium model.[8][9] The software runs on more than 9 million sites and on 11.4% of the top 1Â million sites in the world.[10] On WordPress alone, it has amassed over five million downloads.[11][12] Its software was rated "5 out of 5" by Syed Moiz Balkhi, founder of WPBeginner, a blog for new users to the WordPress platform.[13] In addition, it's been described as one of the most powerful applications available to WordPress users by GoDaddy and Forbes.[14][15] Michael David, the author of _WordPress Search Engine Optimization_ (2015) book, referred to it as "the granddaddy of all SEO plugins".[16]
