YSGOL GYFUN EMLYN is a mixed, community comprehensive school in Newcastle Emlyn, Carmarthenshire, Wales. It has around 572 pupils, catering for all abilities across an age range of 11 to 18 years.[1]

The school was established in 1984 following the re-organisation of secondary education provision in the area, although parts of the school were built in 1955.[2]

Due to its close proximity to the county border, pupils from both Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion attend the school.

12% of pupils speak Welsh at home. However, school data indicates that 31% of pupils are considered to be fluent in Welsh.[3]
