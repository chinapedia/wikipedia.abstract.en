_SRIKANTA_ is a Bengali novel written by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay. Published in four parts between 1917 and 1933,[1] It has been described as Sarat Chandra's 'masterpiece'.[2][3][4] The novel takes its title after the name of its protagonist, Srikanta, who lives a life of wanderer.

Background

In a conversation, Sarat Chandra revealed that the book is partly autobiographical, and his own life experiences provided the basis for the experiences of the protagonist Srikanta; however, he added a caveat:

Although not a travelogue, the book is described as involving journeys—both physical and spiritual. On being asked whether he considered Srikanta to be a travelogue, an autobiography, or a novel, Sarat Chandra's reply was: "A collection of scattered memories−nothing else."[5]


Publication history

Spanned in four parts, _Srikanta_ was written over a period of more than sixteen years. The first three parts, except the last three chapters of third part, were serialized in a monthly magazine _Bharatbarsha_, under the title _Srikantar Bhraman Kahini_ ( The Tale of Srikanta's Wanderings). While the fourth part was serialized in another monthly magazine _Bichitra_, with a slightly-changed name _Srikanta Chaturtha Parba_. The first three parts of the novel were published as a book, with the modified title, in 1917, 1918 and 1927 respectively. The fourth was published as a book in 1933 with the short title _Srikanta_, and was acclaimed as the great work of Sarat Chandra.[6]

Srikanta spends some days there in the loving care of Piyari, and one day Srikanta takes leave of Piyari and goes to his native village.[10][11]

Part II

In the second part, Srikanta's voyage to Rangoon (Burma) and his stay there have been narrated in details.[12]

Srikanta gets acquainted with many strange people on board the ship bound for Rangoon, among whom are Abhaya, a young married woman, and her male companion named Rohini. Abhaya was going to Rangoon to live with her husband, but she is treated very inhumanly by her beastly husband and is refused entry into his house. Abhaya and Rohini, who love each other, live together like husband and wife. Srikanta returns to his native village, but is taken ill there. Rajalakshmi comes to him and takes charge of his treatment and nursing.[13]

Characters

The book features a large number of female characters− most of them based on women Sarat Chandra had known personally. There is Annada Didi, brought up in a conservative middle-class family, who elopes with a snake charmer.[16] Although her husband is a scoundrel, Annada remains loyal to him, for which she is idolized by the young Srikanta.[17][18] This character is based on a Muslim woman who lived with her snake charmer husband in a village near Sarat's native village. As a child, Sarat would often visit her with his friend Indranath. Indranath is courageous and daredevil who always inspires Sarat. When Annada's husband died, this woman had sold her earrings to the local grocer with instruction that the money obtained be given to Sarat, and soon after that she had left her village permanently.[19]

Another character in the book is Abhaya, who begins a live in relationship with a man in defiance of the existing social norms, after being deserted by her husband. This character is based on a woman Sarat Chandra had known in Rangoon, who lived in a locality inhabited by mechanics and artisans. Her husband would periodically beat this woman, and yet out of a slavish chastity she would not leave him despite there being a man who loved her and who offered to rescue her from her plight. In the book, Sarat Chandra depicts women demanding rights for themselves in their own voice. The protagonist Srikanta has an argument with Abhaya about the propriety of what Abhaya has done; Srikanta argues from the orthodox and traditional point of view, but all his arguments are intelligently demolished by Abhaya.[20]
