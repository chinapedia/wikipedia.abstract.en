Early life

Lloyd Edmonstone Jones was born in Columbia, Missouri on June 17, 1889. He was the son of Dr. John Carleton Jones (1856-1930), an educator who served as president of the University of Missouri, and Clara Field Thompson Jones (d. July 19, 1936).

Jones attended the University of Missouri while teaching school, and received a commission as a second lieutenant in Company G, 4th Regiment of the Missouri National Guard.

He left college in his junior year after passing the examination for a commission in the Army. He placed fifth of the 225 applicants who took the exam, and his high standing allowed him to choose his branch. He selected Field Artillery, and was appointed a second lieutenant in the 6th Field Artillery Regiment in December 1911.

He completed the Field Artillery Officer Course at Fort Leavenworth in 1912, and joined the 5th Field Artillery Regiment at Fort Sill, where he remained until being posted to the Philippines with the 2nd Field Artillery in 1915.

At the start of World War I, Jones was a captain and served as an instructor at Officers Training Camps at the Presidio and in Leon Springs, Texas. He then served on the general staff at the War Department.

In 1918, Jones was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel and commanded 5th Field Artillery Brigade, 5th Division. He later served as a senior instructor for the 2nd Field Artillery Brigade at the Camp Jackson, South Carolina Artillery Replacement Training Center. Jones graduated from the Army Center of Artillery Studies in France, and returned to the United States in July 1919.

Jones was married to Elizabeth Heriot Rembert in 1919, and they were the parents of three children: John Carleton (a World War II veteran and Baltimore Sun reporter); Lloyd E. Jr. (a career Army officer); and daughter Anne.

After the war, Jones reverted to the permanent rank of captain. He was subsequently promoted to major, and his assignments included Professor of Military Science at the University of Missouri. He was also commander of the Field Artillery branch competitive pistol team, which took part in matches against Harvard University, West Point, the University of Oklahoma, and other schools.

In 1922, Jones authored a manual on field artillery techniques and procedures, _Field Artillery Applied Mathematics_. He later commanded 1st Battalion, 83rd Field Artillery Regiment. Jones was a 1924 graduate of the Army Command and General Staff College, and a 1930 graduate of the Army War College.

Jones served in the plans, operations, and training directorate (G3) on the War Department General Staff from 1930 to 1934. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and served on the staff and faculty of the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill from 1935 to 1938.
