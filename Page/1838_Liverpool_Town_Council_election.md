Elections to Liverpool Town Council were held on Wednesday 1 November 1838. One third of the council seats were up for election, the term of office of each councillor being three years.

There was a by-election in the Castle Street ward.

Five of the seventeen seats were uncontested.

The terms "Whig" and "Reformer" are used interchangeably, although the local press at the time referred exclusively to "Reformers".

After the election, the composition of the council was:
