_HAVE HARMONY, WILL TRAVEL_ is an album by singer and songwriter Carla Olson. It was released by Busted Flat Records on April 30, 2013 and marked Olson's first studio album since her 2001 release _The Ring of Truth_ (in between she and her band, the Textones, had produced _Detroit 85: Live and Unreleased_, a live album released in 2008).[1][2]


Overview

Carla Olson desire to cut a duet record has been in development for several decades.[3] In an interview with journalist Mike Ragogna she stated:

    Several years ago, I was in between production projects, which is what I mainly do. I haven't done a studio album in a long time, mainly because I've been working at producing. One day I just thought, "Well, I'm in between projects. Maybe I should try to start something." I approached a couple of people about doing a duet album, one of them being Peter Case, who I’ve known since the '70s, and he said, "Yeah, I’d love to."[4]

Olson then rounded up a host of her friends and bandmates as well as some of her favorite singers.[5] Among these were Juice Newton, who duets with Olson in "You Can Come Cryin' to Me", the album's opening track, and "Stringin' Me On". Olson and Peter Case team on the Del Shannon tune "Keep Searchin' (We'll Follow the Sun)" and on Moby Grape's "8:05".[6] Initially, Olson was to have performed "8:05" with her recording partner, Gene Clark, but he died before the recording was made.[7] "She Don't Care About Time", a song written by Clark, was performed with Richie Furay.[8]

In his review of the album music critic Thom Jurek stated:

    Though there isn't a weak cut in bunch, there are some soaring highlights It ends the set by seamlessly melding folk, rock, and country. _Have Harmony, Will Travel_ is a welcome return for Olson, but that's not all. With its direct, kinetic production, compelling song choices, and inspired performances, it is a blueprint for future duet recordings.[9]

A second volume of Have Harmony, Will Travel will be released in the autumn of 2019 and will include new performances by Stephen McCarthy (of the Long Ryders), Timothy B. Schmit (of the Eagles), Ana Gazzola, Jim Muske and Terry Reid plus a few archive duets with Percy Sledge, Gene Clark and Pat Robinson.
