JILL ALLGOOD (15 November 1910 - 1995) was a British producer, director, script writer, author and broadcaster who worked for the BBC.[1]

Allgood was a personal friend of Bebe Daniels and Ben Lyon, and worked with them professionally. In 1944 she was working for Cecil Madden, Head of BBC Overseas Entertainment, and from 1944 to 1946, with Howard Agg (and later with C. F. Meehan), she devised and produced a weekly/fortnightly programme for forces in hospitals called _Here's Wishing You Well Again_.[2] There she got to know Bebe and Ben, who were often requested guests on that programme.[3] She collaborated with Bebe on episodes of _Life with the Lyons_, and wrote their biography _Bebe and Ben_. She later became a writer, creating nine episodes for _Four Feather Falls_, a TV show produced by Gerry Anderson for Granada Television.[4]
