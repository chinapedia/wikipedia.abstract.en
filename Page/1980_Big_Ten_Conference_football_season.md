The 1980 BIG TEN CONFERENCE FOOTBALL SEASON was the 85th season of college football played by the member schools of the Big Ten Conference and was a part of the 1980 NCAA Division I-A football season.

The 1980 Big Ten champion was Michigan. The Wolverines lost two of their first three games but went undefeated thereafter, culminating in a 23–6 victory over the Washington Huskies in the 1981 Rose Bowl (the program's first bowl victory under head coach Bo Schembechler). Michigan was ranked No. 4 in the final AP Poll, led the Big Ten in scoring defense (10.8 points per game), and did not allow a touchdown in the final 22 quarters of the season. Schembechler was selected as the Big Ten Coach of the Year.

The Ohio State Buckeyes started the season ranked No. 1 in the AP Poll, but finished the season ranked No. 15 after compiling a 9–3 record and losing to Penn State in the 1980 Fiesta Bowl. The Buckeyes led the conference in scoring offense with 32.3 points per game.

The Purdue Boilermakers finished the season tied with Ohio State for second place in the conference and were ranked No. 17 in the final AP Poll. During the 1980 season, Purdue quarterback Mark Herrmann became the first player in college football history to compile more than 9,000 career passing yards. Hermann also won the Chicago Tribune Silver Football as the most valuable player in the conference.

Mark Hermann and Purdue teammate Dave Young, a tight end, were the only two Big Ten players to be recognized as consensus first-team players on the 1980 College Football All-America Team. The conference's statistical leaders included Hermann with 3,212 passing yards, Ohio State's Calvin Murray with 1,267 rushing yards, and Ohio State placekicker Vlade Janakievski with 90 points scored. Michigan linebacker Mel Owens was the only Big Ten player selected in the first round of the 1981 NFL Draft, going to the Los Angeles Rams with the ninth pick.

Pre-season

Led by quarterback and Heisman Trophy candidate Art Schlichter, Ohio State came into the 1980 season as the defending Big Ten champion, having finished the 1979 season with an 11–1 record and ranked No. 4 in the final AP Poll. The 1980 season began with three Big Ten teams ranked in the pre-season AP Poll: Ohio State at No. 1; Purdue at No. 9; and Michigan at No. 12.[5]

Two of the conference's teams hired new head coaches prior to the 1980 season.

-   In December 1979, Illinois hired Mike White to replace Gary Moeller. Moeller's teams had gone 3–16–3 in the prior two seasons. White had been an assistant coach with the San Francisco 49ers in 1978 and 1979 and was the head coach for the California Golden Bears from 1972 to 1977.[6]
-   In January 1980, Michigan State hired Muddy Waters after Darryl Rogers resigned to take over as Arizona State's head coach. Waters had played for Michigan State from 1946 to 1949 and had been a head coach at Hillsdale College (1954–1973) and Saginaw Valley State (1975–1979).[7]

Anthony Carter caught a touchdown pass just before halftime to set a Michigan school record for touchdown receptions in a single season. As Michigan drove deep into Wisconsin territory, noise from the Wisconsin student section made it difficult for Michigan to call its signals. When fans refused to reduce the noise, the officials struck all three Wisconsin timeouts and then assessed two delay of game penalties, giving Michigan a first down at the one-yard line. Butch Woolfolk then scored on a one-yard run[75]

_Purdue 58, Iowa 13_. Purdue (AP No. 17) defeated Iowa, 58–13, at Ross–Ade Stadium in West Lafayette. Mark Hermann set a Purdue single-game record with 439 passing yards. Hermann also set an NCAA career record with 1,151 pass completions.[76]

_Minnesota 31, Indiana 7_. Minnesota defeated Indiana, 31–7, in Minneapolis. Indiana quarterback Tim Clifford was knocked out of the game in the first half by "a savage blindside tackle" by Jeff Schuh. Minnesota running back Garry White rushed for 145 yards and two touchdowns.[77]

_Michigan State 42, Northwestern 10_. Michigan State defeated Northwestern, 42–10, before a crowd of 60,157 at Spartan Stadium in East Lansing. Michigan State tailback Steve Smith rushed for 229 yards and a school record with four touchdowns. The Spartans totaled 571 yards of total offense.[78]

November 15

On November 15, 1980, the Big 10 teams faced off in five conference matchups.

_Michigan 26, Purdue 0_. Michigan defeated Purdue, 26–0, for Michigan's third consecutive shut out. The victory was particularly impressive as the Wolverines held Purdue's record-setting quarterback, Mark Hermann, to 129 passing yard (24 in the second half), intercepted four of Hermann's passes, and did not allow a first down by Purdue in the second half. Coach Schembechler credited Michigan defensive coordinator Bill McCartney with the strategy of playing six defensive backs that held Purdue's offense scoreless.[79]

_Ohio State 41, Iowa 7_. Ohio State easily defeated Iowa, 41–7, in Iowa City. Art Schlichter threw two touchdown passes, and Calvin Murray rushed for 183 yards to lead the Buckeyes.[80]

_Indiana 26, Illinois 24_. Indiana defeated Illinois, 26–24, in Bloomington. Indiana tailback Lonnie Johnson rushed for a school record 237 yards on 37 carries. Illinois quarterback Dave Wilson kept the game close as he passed for 403 yards and three touchdowns.[81]

_Michigan State 30, Minnesota 12_. Michigan State defeated Minnesota, 30–12, before a crowd of 30,329 in Minneapolis. Michigan State quarterback John Leister passed for 209 yards and three touchdowns. Minnesota quarterback Tim Salem completed only 5 of 15 passes, threw two interceptions, and fumbled twice.[82]

_Wisconsin 39, Northwestern 19_. Wisconsin defeated Northwestern, 39–19, in Evanston. Northwestern's Mike Kerrigan passed for 237 yards in the loss.[83] The Wildcats finished the season 0–11 and in the midst of a 34-game losing streak that began on September 22, 1979, and ended on September 25, 1982.

November 22

On November 22, 1980, the Big Ten regular season came to an end with four games being played. Illinois and Northwestern were idle, having concluded their schedules one week earlier.

_Michigan 9, Ohio State 3_. Ohio State (AP No. 5) and Michigan (AP No. 10) met in their annual rivalry game to determine the Big Ten championship. The game was played before a record crowd of 88,827 fans at Ohio Stadium and matched the conference's top scoring offense (Ohio State) against the top scoring defense (Michigan). Michigan prevailed, defeating the Buckeyes by a 9–3 score. Michigan's only touchdown came late in the third quarter on a pass from John Wangler to Anthony Carter. Ali Haji-Sheikh missed the extra point and also missed two field goal attempts. Big Ten rushing leader Calvin Murray was held to 38 yards on 14 carries. Ohio State had a chance to win late in the fourth quarter, as Art Schlichter completed a 28-yard pass to the Michigan 32-yard line with less than a minute to play. Schlichter was penalized for intentional grounding and was sacked on the next play with 13 seconds left on the clock.[84] Michigan extended its streak of not having allowed a touchdown to 18 quarters and 274 minutes.[85][86]

_Purdue 24, Indiana 23_. In the annual battle for the Old Oaken Bucket, Purdue defeated Indiana, 24–23, in West Lafayette. Purdue led, 24–17, with 21 seconds left when Tim Clifford threw a touchdown pass to Steve Corso (Indiana coach Lee Corso's son). Rather than kick an extra point to tie the game, Indiana coach Corso called for a pass play to win the game; the pass was knocked down, and Purdue preserved a one-point margin of victory.[87]

_Wisconsin 25, Minnesota 7_. In the annual battle for Paul Bunyan' Axe, Wisconsin defeated Minnesota, 25–7, at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison. Wisconsin quarterback, Jess Cole, in his second start, scored four touchdowns.[88]

_Iowa 41, Michigan State 0_. Iowa shut out Michigan State, 41–0, before a disappointed crowd of 55,123 fans at Spartan Stadium in East Lansing. After the game, Iowa coach Hayden Fry called it a "real fine victory," while Michigan State coach Muddy Waters said: "You saw it – rotten, lousy flat. It was about the worst game I ever saw. We were afraid it would happen, scared to death it would happen with an inexperienced team like we have."[89]

Three Big Ten teams played in bowl games at the end of the 1980 season, with victories by Michigan in the 1981 Rose Bowl and by Purdue in the 1980 Liberty Bowl and a loss by Ohio State in the 1980 Fiesta Bowl.
