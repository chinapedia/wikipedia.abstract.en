JANŽ TULŠČAK (? – 1594, first name also spelled _Ivan, Hans_, last name also spelled _Tulschak, Tulszhak_, a.k.a. FEISTENBERGER or SCHERER[1]) was a Slovene Protestant preacher and writer.


Life

Tulščak was born at Gracar Turn. He initially served as a Catholic priest in White Carniola. Together with Gregor Vlahovič, in Metlika he started preaching in the Protestant spirit and at the same time participated in the committee that approved the Croatian translations of Primož Trubar's books. In 1571 he became the assistant preacher in Ljubljana, and in 1581 the provincial preacher. Among other duties, he was on the committee for revising Jurij Dalmatin's translation of the Bible.[2][3]
