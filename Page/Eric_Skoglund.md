Career

Skoglund attended Sarasota High School in Sarasota, Florida. He was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 16th round of the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft but did not sign and attended the University of Central Florida (UCF), where he played college baseball.[1][2] After his junior season, he was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the third round of the 2014 MLB Draft.[3]

Skoglund made his professional debut with the Idaho Falls Chukars in 2014 and spent the whole season there, going 0-2 with a 5.09 ERA in nine games (eight starts).

In his major league debut, Skoglund pitched 6 1/3 scoreless innings with five strikeouts, allowing only two hits and one walk in a 1â€“0 win over the Detroit Tigers.[6] Skoglund was sent back down to Omaha on June 19, and he spent the remainder of the 2017 season going back and forth between Omaha and Kansas City.
