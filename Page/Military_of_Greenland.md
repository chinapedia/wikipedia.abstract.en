The government of Greenland does not have control of Greenland's military or foreign affairs. The defence of Greenland is the responsibility of the Kingdom of Denmark. However, following the November 2008 referendum on increased autonomy, which attracted significant popular support (72% turnout, 75% vote in favor), the governments of Greenland and Denmark have agreed to a 30-point package that will begin to give Greenland greater powers over defence and foreign affairs.


Native military

Greenland has no regular military, the Royal Danish Navy Maintains several bases, under the Joint Arctic Command, and conducts coast guard as well as search and rescue operations.
