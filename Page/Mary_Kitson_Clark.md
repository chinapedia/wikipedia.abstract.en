ANNA MARY HAWTHORN KITSON CLARK, (14 May 1905 – 1 February 2005), married name MARY CHITTY, was an English archaeologist, curator, and independent scholar. She specialised in the archaeology of Romano-British Northern England but was also involved in excavations outside the United Kingdom and the Roman period. Her 1935 work, _A Gazetteer of Roman Remains in East Yorkshire_, "remains one of the starting points for any study of the Romans in the north of England".[1]


Early life and education

Kitson Clark was born on 14 May 1905 in Leeds, Yorkshire, England.[2][3] She was the youngest of three children born to Edwin Kitson Clark (1866–1943) and Georgina Kitson Clark (_née_ Bidder); an elder brother was the historian George Kitson Clark.[4] Her paternal grandfather was Edwin Charles Clark, Regius Professor of Civil Law at Cambridge University, and her maternal great-grandfather was George Parker Bidder, an eminent engineer.[5]

Kitson Clark was first educated at home and then at Leeds Girls' High School, a selective independent school in Leeds.[6][7] She then matriculated into Girton College, Cambridge to study the history tripos.[8] After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, she remained at the University of Cambridge to study for the one-year diploma in archaeology.[9]


Career

Kitson Clark belonged to the generation of amateur archaeologists who remained as independent scholars; over her lifetime she "witnessed the decline in influence of the amateur, independent scholar, and the rise of a professional class of archaeologist and historian".[10] From 1929 to 1943, she was secretary of the Roman Antiquities Committee for Yorkshire; her father had been its treasurer.[11] During this time, she published her _magnum opus_, _A Gazetteer of Roman Remains in East Yorkshire_ (1935). It was described in 1990 as a "well-loved, well-thumbed classic",[12] and according to her obituary in _The Independent_ "remains one of the starting points for any study of the Romans in the north of England".[13] From 1941 to 1943, she was also the curator of Roman Antiquities at the Yorkshire Museum in York.[14]

After her marriage in 1943, Kitson Clark remained a member of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society (which, among other things, ran the Yorkshire Museum), becoming its longest-lived Vice-President.[15][16] After the death of her husband in 1971, she continued her research. She published a two-volume monograph on _The Monks of Ynys Enlli_ (1992, 2000);[17][18] the last volume was published just after her 95th birthday.[19]

Kitson Clark was involved in a number of archaeological excavations. She excavated at a number sites in East Yorkshire, and published her findings in _Gazetteer of Roman Remains in East Yorkshire_ (1935).[20] In 1929, she went to Palestine and worked on the Dorothy Garrod led excavations of palaeolithic sites.[21] In 1935, she was part of a team that excavated Petuaria, a Roman fort in Brough, East Riding of Yorkshire.[22]


Personal life

During her involvement in the 1929 excavations in Palestine, Kitson Clark met her future husband Derwas James Chitty (1901–1971); he was also an archaeologist and an Anglican priest.[23][24] On 5 July 1943, she married Chitty.[25] Together they had one child, a daughter.[26] They then lived in Upton, Berkshire, where he served as its vicar.[27] After he retired from full-time ministry in 1968, they lived in Llangwnnadl, Caernarfonshire, Wales.[28] Her husband died in 1971 after a "domestic accident".[29] In her obituary in _The Independent_ it stated that after his death "Mary was much comforted by her strong Christian beliefs".[30]

On 1 February 2005, Kitson Clark died at Môr Awel, Llangwnnadl, at the age of 99.[31] Her funeral and a Requiem Mass were held at St Gwynhoedl's Church in Llangwnadl on 5 February 2005.[32]


Honours

On 13 January 1938, Kitson Clark was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA): at the time of her death she was the "last surviving fellow elected before the Second World War".[33] In 1985, a conference was held in her honour by British Romanists; the proceedings of this conference were later published as _Recent Research in Roman Yorkshire: studies in honour of Mary Kitson Clark (Mrs Derwas Chitty)_ (1988).[34][35]
