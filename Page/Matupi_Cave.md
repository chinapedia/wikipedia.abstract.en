MATUPI CAVE is a cave in the Mount Hoyo massif of the Ituri Rainforest, Democratic Republic of the Congo and northeastern Zaire, where archaeologists have found evidence for Later Stone Age human occupation spanning over 40,000 years.[1] The cave has some of the earliest evidence in the world for microlithic tool technologies.[2]

Van Noten conducted excavations in 1973-1974 here and revealed a microlithic industry dated about 3,000 to 40,000 years back with 2 m residue. Â [3][4]

Today, although Matupi cave is located in the rain forest, the material evidence shows that there used to be Savannah once a time when the stone age hunters settled here. Between 12,000 and 3,000 BP, rain forests began to emerge. [5][6]
