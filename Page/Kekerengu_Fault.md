It is closely associated with the Hope Fault and Jordan Thrust at its south-easternmost edge and likely joins with the Clarence Fault to form the Wairarapa Fault offshore in Cook Strait.[1][2]

Early investigations immediately following the 14 November 2016 Kaikoura earthquake indicate that up to of motion may have occurred on the Kekerengu Fault during the 7.8 magnitude quake.[3] During this earthquake the offshore continuation of the Kekerengu Fault to the north east, known as the Needles Fault, ruptured as well. NIWA marine geologist Dr Philip Barnes said the length of the Kekerenguâ€“Needles Fault rupture may extend for about , consisting of on land and under the sea.[4]
