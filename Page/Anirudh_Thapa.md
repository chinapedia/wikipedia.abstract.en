ANIRUDH THAPA (born 15 January 1998) is an Indian professional footballer who plays as a central midfield for both Indian football club Chennaiyin and the India national football team. He has also appeared for U-23 Indian team.


Career

Born in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, he started his schooling at St. Joseph's Academy and also played football for his school team. Then Thapa began playing football at the age of ten at the St. Stephen's Football Academy in Chandigarh.[1] After spending time with the India under-14 side, Thapa was selected to join the AIFF Regional Academy in Kalyani in 2012.[2] As he moved up the national youth team ranks, Thapa was moved into the AIFF Elite Academy where he became captain of the side in the I-League U19.[3] In April 2016 Thapa, along with four other players, was selected to join French Ligue 2 side Metz on a short training-stint which was sponsored by Indian Super League side Chennaiyin.[4]

In November 2016, due to the injury of Dhanachandra Singh which ruled the defender out for the rest of the ISL season, Thapa was put into the Chennaiyin squad as a replacement.[5] He made his professional debut for the team in the side's final match of the season against Goa. He started the match and played 67 minutes. He almost scored his first goal but unfortunately it was given an own goal.[6]

After the conclusion of the 2016 ISL season, Thapa signed with Minerva Punjab of the I-League on loan for the 2016–17 season.[7]
