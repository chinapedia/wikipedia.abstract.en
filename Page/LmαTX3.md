LMΑTX3 is an α-scorpion toxin from _Lychas mucronatus_.[1] that inhibits fast inactivation of voltage gated sodium-channels (VGSCs).


Etymology

The LmαTX3 toxin derives the first part of its name from the source of the venom (_Lychas mucronatus_, 'Lm') [2]_,_ the middle part due to its nature as an α-scorpion toxin ('αTX'),[3] and the last part as a reflection of the binding to receptor site 3 the toxin acts upon.[4]


Sources

LmαTX3 is a toxin expressed and secreted by the venom gland of _Lychas mucronatus_, a scorpion from the Buthidae family that can be found in China, Laos, Thailand and other regions of Asia.[5][6]


Chemistry

Scorpion toxins targeting VGSGs (also called NaTX) are usually polypeptides composed of 61–76 amino acids cross-linked by four disulfide bridges.[7] LmαTX3 consists of the same disulfide bridge pattern and conserved residues as sodium channel-specific modulators, thus suggesting its modulating effect on sodium channels.[8] Analysis of the amino acid sequence in cDNA previously acquired of the _Lychas mucronatus_ showed that LmαTX3 contained 21 residues in their signal peptides, and 62 residues in their mature peptides (the peptide remaining after the cleaving of the signal peptide).[9]

Modelling of the 3D structure of LmαTX3 showed a typical cysteine-stabilized α-helix/β-sheet motif (CSαβ motif), with the α-helix stabilized by two disulfide bridges to one strand of the β sheet.[10] Similar to other α-scorpion toxins, LmαTX3 presented with potential functional residues in the conversed NC-domains (Lys1, Lys8, Lys 51, Asn53, Ile54 and Lys57) and the Core-domains (Arg14, Lys23, Arg39 and Lys 42).[11] Therefore, there are strong suggestions that LmαTX3 falls under the NaTX type of channels.[12]

The molecular weight of LmαTX3 is 9.2 kDa.[13]


Target

Electrophysiological experiments have evaluated the effect of recombinant LmαTX3 on the following four types of sodium channels:[14]

-   rNav1.2: expressed at high levels in the central nervous system[15]
-   mNav1.4: mostly found in adult skeletal muscles[16]
-   hNav1.5: mostly found in embryonic and denervated skeletal muscle and heart muscle[17]
-   hNav1.7: primarily in the peripheral nervous system [18]

LmαTX3 inhibits fast inactivation of these types of sodium channels.[19] It modulates the inactivation of mNa_(v)1.4 and hNa_(v)1.5 channels more potently than of hNa_(v)1.7 channels and especially rNa_(v)1.2 channels.[20]


Mode of Action

The α-toxins can inhibit the fast inactivation of VGSGs.[21] Based on its homology to other members of the α-scorpion toxin family, LmαTX3 most likely blocks receptor site 3, which is located on the extracellular loop of sodium channels which connects the S3 and S4 segments on domain IV.[22] Site 3 toxins prevent a component of outward gating charge movement associated with channel inactivation,[23] it is likely that they are able to slow inactivation by preventing the outward movement of the DIV S4 segment,[24] hence making fast inactivation difficult and prolonging the action potential.[25][26] In this sense, scorpion α-toxins can be considered gating-modifier toxins.[27]


Toxicity

Currently, there is no LmαTX3-specific knowledge of the toxic effect. Generally, scorpion α-toxins prolong the action potentials of excitable cells.[28] These toxins can kill organisms by inducing paralysis and arrhythmia.[29]
