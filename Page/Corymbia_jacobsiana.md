_CORYMBIA JACOBSIANA_, commonly known as JACOB'S BLOODWOOD or the STRINGYBARK BLOODWOOD,[1] is a member of the genus _Corymbia_ native to Australia's Northern Territory[2]


Description

The tree typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber and rhizomes. It has yellow-brown to grey-brown bark that is rough, tessellated and stringy and persistent over the trunk and the branches. The glossy, green adult leaves are disjunct with a narrow lanceolate or lanceolate shape. Leaves are basally tapered and approximately long and wide. The tree is though to flower between February and April producing a terminal compound conflorescence with regular 3-flowered to 7-flowered umbellasters. The flowers are white or cream and later form ovoid to urceolate fruits that are barrel-shaped long and wide. Seeds are regular and flattened dull to semi-glossy and red or red-brown in colour.[3]

_C. jacobsiana_ has no close relatives,[4] it is solated from all other bloodwoods by the combination of rough stringybark and sparsely setose juvenile leaves but carpeted on the underside with white hairs.[5]


Distribution

_C. jacobsiana_ throughout the top end of the Northern Territory usually in monsoonal woodland areas. Usually part of a tropical savannah woodland mix with eucalpyts and cypress found in sand or clay soils or in dissected sandstone.[6] It has an erratic distribution around Pine Creek, Tipperary Station and further east in Arnhem Land. Often found with _Corymbia arnhemensis_ and _Corymbia nesophila_.[7]

The plant's rhizomes allow it to form dense clones following fires, these later thin out to form woodlands.[8]


History

First described by the botanist William Blakely in 1934 in _A Key to the Eucalypts_ as EUCALYPTUS JACOBSIANA[9][10] from samples collected by Maxwell Ralph Jacobs whom the plant is named for. Jacobs was a distinguished forester and the Principal of the Australian Forestry School in Canberra from 1945 to 1961.[11] Botanists Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson were the first to define the genus _Corymbia_ in 1995, identifying the bloodwoods, ghost gums and spotted gums as a group distinct from _Eucalyptus_.[12]
