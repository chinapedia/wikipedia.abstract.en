In 2016 TemiDollFace released the single "Beep Beep", ahead of an album release.


Career

Dollface was signed to Sony Records in the UK for five years.[2] In September 2003, Dollface was invited by Mary J Blige to support her at the "Sisters with Soul" concert at the Expo Centre Lagos. She has since supported the likes of Chris Brown, Rahsaan Patterson, Femi Kuti, Keziah Jones, and others, and was invited by Coca-Cola to appear on their Nairobi music TV show _Coke Studio_, along with King Sunny Ade and M.I Abaga.[3]

In 2013 she released the single "Pata Pata"[4] which featured in series one of the Ndanitv soap opera Gidi Up. The song earned her four AFRIMA nominations at the December 2014 All Africa Music Awards for "Best Video", "Revelation Of The African Continent", "Best African Pop Song" and "Most Promising African Artiste On The Continent". The music video proved popular, and was regularly shown on channels such as MTV World, Channel O, Soundcity, One music, TVC, and others.[5]

After releasing "Just Like That (Story)",[6] in 2016 TemiDollFace released her third single, "Beep Beep", ahead of an album release. The magazine _Music in Africa_ describes the song as being part of the "artist’s contribution to moving the ‘Girl Power movement’ towards the centre of pop culture and political conversations".[7] It is a love song set in a 1930s cabaret.[8] _VivaNaija_ wrote: "The latest single by the Nigerian artiste, Temi Dollface, is gorgeous. Strands of afrobeat mix with strains of Jill Scott. I hear nu-soul, I hear funk. Janelle Monáe sat with Erykah Badu in a burlesque cafe and had tea with Fela. I love, love, love everything I hear."[9]

In August 2016 Dollface was announced as one of the nominees for "Best Female Artist in Western Africa" at the All Africa Music Awards (AFRIMA), with her song "School Your Face".[10] Dollface was quoted as saying about "School Your Face": "As a creative I like to play with contrasts and words in a similar manner to what I do with clothes. It's really just needing that one trigger or fragment of an idea and then I invent the rest myself."[11]

In October 2016 she is due to appear at the London Felabration 2016 with the Dele Sosimi Afrobeat Orchestra and artists such as Breis, Bumi Thomas, Afrikan Boy, Tiggs da Author, and others.[12]
