CRYSTAL POWELL-COOPER (born Crystal Powell) is an American comedian, actress and singer best known for her roles in Kevin Hart Presents: Hart of the City on Comedy Central and her role in "Ball Don't Lie" featuring Ludacris, Rosanna Arquette and Nick Cannon. Powell was born in the small town of Tatum, Texas [1]and moved to Houston with her family. After the death of both her parents at a young age, she moved to Los Angeles. Rather than let grief swallow her, an agent told her to try Improv comedy to tap into her true personality at auditions. From there she turned to comedy to heal not only her own pain but that of others. Powell has appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live, ABC, FOX and KPRC among other outlets.

She was chosen from hundreds of comics to appear on Comedy Central as the only female comic representing Texas on Hart's new show.[2]

The show premiered on Comedy Central on October 2, 2016 and was part of a two show creation deal that Hart inked with the network.[3]

Powell was also the only comedian chosen to perform at Super Bowl Live during Super Bowl LI in 2017. [4]
