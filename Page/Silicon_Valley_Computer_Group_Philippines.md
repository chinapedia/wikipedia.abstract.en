They were the first in the Philippines to sell computer supplies by pieces instead of selling it by sets. With their prospering business for eleven years, in 1996, the company moved its corporate office at San Francisco Del Monte, Quezon City, Philippines and started to expand branches, nationwide.

In 1997, First International Computer (FIC), a Taiwanese-based manufacturer of computer motherboards,[1] appointed Silicon Valley as their distributor in the Philippines. It then followed by Hewett-Packard which the appointed Silicon Valley as their Accredited Commercial Reseller (ACR), Dealer Premier Support Partner (DPSP) and Accredited Service Provider (ASP).[2]

Silicon Valley has expanded to a chain of retail stores focused on computer sets, parts, and accessories. Gadgets such as smartphones, tablets, digital cameras, video recorders, and printing supplies were later introduced in their product lineup.

Silicon Valley together with Asianic Distributors brought Lenovo in the Philippines by having the first Lenovo Concept store at The Cyberzone, SM Mall of Asia followed by seven other stores within Metro Manila. It was after Lenovo bought International Business Machines Corporation's PC divisions in 2005.[3] By that time, PCs with brands IdeaPad and ThinkPad PCs, ThinkServer systems and ThinkVision monitors, and as well as Lenovo computer accessories were readily available at the concept store. The concept store also offers PC repairs and technical support for Lenovo products.
