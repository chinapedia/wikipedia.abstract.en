KASIDET POS MALWARE is a variant of Point of Sale (POS) Malware that performs DDoS attacks using Namecoin's Dot-Bit service to scrape payment card details.[1][2] It is also known as Trojan.MWZLesson or Neutrino and was found in September 2015 by cyber security experts.[3][4] It is a combination of BackDoor.Neutrino.50 and the POS malware.[5]


Operation

Kasidet POS Worm gets on a system along with the other malware or gets downloaded unknowingly when user visits malicious websites.[6][7] This malware is different from other POS malware and it scrapes data with advanced features.[8] First it scrapes the POS RAM and steals payment card details. Then the scraped information is sent to the cyber criminal with intercepted GET and POST requests from the browser.[9] It's very difficult to detect this bot by using security programs; sometimes it's detectable in email spam campaigns and exploit kits.[10] The scraping capability of Kasidet has now been enhanced by the cyber criminals and it now hides C&C server in the Namecoin DNS Service Dot-Bit.


Incidents

-   The US Government blamed Russian hackers for malicious Kasidet POS malware found in Democratic National Committee computers and a Burlington Electric Company laptop.[11][12][13] In the former case, the software was allegedly used to interfere in the 2016 election.
-   Zscaler has reported that MS Office documents distributed in phishing emails contain macros that install Kasidet POS malware into user machines.[14][15] The malware is believed to originate in Russia.[16]
