A RAVEN is one of several larger-bodied species of the genus _Corvus_. These species do not form a single taxonomic group within the genus.

There is no consistent distinction between "crows" and "ravens", and these appellations have been assigned to different species chiefly on the basis of their size, crows generally being smaller than ravens.

The largest raven species are the common raven and the thick-billed raven.


Etymology

The term "raven" originally referred to the common raven (_Corvus corax_), the type species of the genus _Corvus_, which has a larger distribution than any other species of _Corvus_, ranging over much of the Northern Hemisphere.

The modern English word _raven_ has cognates in all other Germanic languages, including Old Norse (and subsequently modern Icelandic) _hrafn_[1] and Old High German _(h)raban_,[2] all of which descend from Proto-Germanic _*hrabanaz_.[3]

Collective nouns for a group of ravens (or at least the common raven) include "unkindness", "treachery",[4] and "conspiracy".[5] In practice, most people use the more generic "flock".
