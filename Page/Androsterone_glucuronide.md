ANDROSTERONE GLUCURONIDE (ADT-G) is a major circulating and urinary metabolite of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT).[1] It accounts for 93% of total androgen glucuronides in women.[2] ADT-G is formed from androsterone by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, with the major enzymes being UGT2B15 and UGT2B17.[3] It is a marker of acne in women while androstanediol glucuronide is a marker of hirsutism (excess hair growth) in women.[4]
