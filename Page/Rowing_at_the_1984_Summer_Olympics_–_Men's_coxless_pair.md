The MEN'S COXLESS PAIR (M2-) competition at the 1984 Summer Olympics took place at Lake Casitas in Ventura County, California, United States. It was held from 30 July to 5 August and the outcome was wide open due to the Eastern Bloc boycott and thus the absence of the dominating team from East Germany. The event was won by the team from Romania.[1]


Background

East Germany had won the coxless pair competition at every Summer Olympics since the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico, and they were the reigning world champion.[2][3] The Soviet Union had won silver at the last Summer Olympics in this event,[4] had won the 1981 World Rowing Championships,[5] and had won silver in 1983.[6] With both nations absent due to the Eastern Bloc boycott, the only competing nation that had won recent world championships was Norway, which had won the title in 1982.[7] The competition was thus regarded as wide open.[8]
