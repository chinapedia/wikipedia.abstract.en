Early life

Career

In April 2016, Hopkins was cast in the BBC Three Doctor Who spin-off _Class_[2] as April MacLean.[3] Her character April is a student at Coal Hill School, who Hopkins described as "socially awkward", but also "compassionate, kind", and sometimes "extraordinarily brave".[4] April was advertised as _the British Buffy_.[5] When Hopkins first got to know about the series she only knew that the series would be similar to _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_. She didn't know that it would be a _Doctor Who_ spin off. As she was _massive Buffy fan_ and she loved the description of her character April she decided to audition and got the role.[6][7] During the production of the series Hopkins lived in Cardiff, in the same building as actress Vivian Oparah.[8] Later in 2016 Hopkins played the lead in the horror–thriller _Brackenmore_, which was set in Ireland. In 2018 Hopkins reprised her role as April MacLean in six audio plays by Big Finish.[9]
