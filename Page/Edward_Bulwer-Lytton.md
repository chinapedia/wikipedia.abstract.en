EDWARD GEORGE EARLE LYTTON BULWER-LYTTON, 1ST BARON LYTTON, PC (25 May 1803 – 18 January 1873) was an English writer and politician. He served as a Whig MP from 1831 to 1841 and a Conservative MP from 1851 to 1866. He was Secretary of State for the Colonies from June 1858 to June 1859, when he chose Richard Clement Moody to be founder of British Columbia. He declined the Crown of Greece in 1862 after the abdication of King Otto. He became Baron Lytton of Knebworth in 1866.[1][2] His son, the statesman Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton, served as Governor-General of India and British Ambassador to France, and wrote poetry under the pseudonym Owen Meredith. Bulwer-Lytton's works were highly popular and paid him well. He coined the phrases "the great unwashed", "pursuit of the almighty dollar", "the pen is mightier than the sword", and "dweller on the threshold". Then came a sharp decline in his reputation, so that he is known today for little more than the opening seven words of his novel _Paul Clifford_ (1830): "It was a dark and stormy night". The sardonic Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest seeks the "opening sentence of the worst of all possible novels".[3][4][5][6]


Life

Bulwer-Lytton was born on 25 May 1803 to General William Earle Bulwer of Heydon Hall and Wood Dalling, Norfolk and Elizabeth Barbara Lytton, daughter of Richard Warburton Lytton of Knebworth House, Hertfordshire. He had two older brothers, William Earle Lytton Bulwer (1799–1877) and Henry (1801–1872), later Lord Dalling and Bulwer.

When Edward was four, his father died and his mother moved to London. He was a delicate, neurotic child and was discontented at a number of boarding schools. But he was precocious and Mr. Wallington at Baling encouraged him to publish, at the age of fifteen, an immature work, _Ishmael and Other Poems_.

In 1822 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he met John Auldjo, but shortly afterwards moved to Trinity Hall. In 1825 he won the Chancellor's Gold Medal for English verse.[7] In the following year he took his BA degree and printed, for private circulation, a small volume of poems, _Weeds and Wild Flowers_.

He purchased a commission in the army in 1826, but sold it in 1829 without serving.[8] ''.]] In August 1827, he married Rosina Doyle Wheeler (1802–1882), a famous Irish beauty, but against his mother's wishes, who withdrew his allowance, so that he was forced to work for a living.[9] They had two children, Lady Emily Elizabeth Bulwer-Lytton (1828–1848), and (Edward) Robert Lytton Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton (1831–1891) who became Governor-General and Viceroy of British India (1876–1880).

His writing and political work strained their marriage, while his infidelity embittered Rosina.[10] In 1833 they separated acrimoniously and in 1836 the separation became legal.[11]

Three years later, Rosina published _Cheveley, or the Man of Honour_ (1839), a near-libellous fiction bitterly satirising her husband's alleged hypocrisy.[12] In June 1858, when her husband was standing as parliamentary candidate for Hertfordshire, she indignantly denounced him at the hustings. He retaliated by threatening her publishers, withholding her allowance, and denying her access to the children.[13] Finally he had her committed to a mental asylum,[14] but after a public outcry, she was released a few weeks later.[15] This incident was chronicled in her memoir, _A Blighted Life_ (1880).[16][17] She continued her attacks upon her husband's character for several years.

The death of Bulwer-Lytton's mother in 1843 greatly saddened him. His own "exhaustion of toil and study had been completed by great anxiety and grief," and by "about the January of 1844, I was thoroughly shattered".[18][19] In his mother's room at Knebworth House, Bulwer-Lytton "had inscribed above the mantelpiece a request that future generations preserve the room as his beloved mother had used it." It remains essentially unchanged to this day.[20]

On 20 February 1844, in accordance with his mother's will, he changed his surname from 'Bulwer' to 'Bulwer-Lytton' and assumed the arms of Lytton by royal licence. His widowed mother had done the same in 1811. His brothers remained plain "Bulwer".

By chance Bulwer-Lytton encountered a copy of "Captain Claridge's work on the "Water Cure", as practised by Priessnitz, at Graefenberg", and "making allowances for certain exaggerations therein", pondered the option of travelling to Graefenberg, but preferred to find something closer to home, with access to his own doctors in case of failure: "I who scarcely lived through a day without leech or potion!".[21][22] After reading a pamphlet by Doctor James Wilson, who operated a hydropathic establishment with James Manby Gully at Malvern, he stayed there for "some nine or ten weeks", after which he "continued the system some seven weeks longer under Doctor Weiss, at Petersham", then again at "Doctor Schmidt's magnificent hydropathic establishment at Boppart" (at the former Marienberg Convent at Boppard), after developing a cold and fever upon his return home.[23]

When King Otto of Greece abdicated in 1862, Bulwer-Lytton was offered the crown of Greece, which he declined.[24] The English Rosicrucian society, founded in 1867 by Robert Wentworth Little, claimed Bulwer-Lytton as their 'Grand Patron', but he wrote to the society complaining that he was 'extremely surprised' by their use of the title, as he had 'never sanctioned such'.[25] Nevertheless, a number of esoteric groups have continued to claim Bulwer-Lytton as their own, chiefly because some of his writings—such as the 1842 book _Zanoni_—have included Rosicrucian and other esoteric notions. According to the Fulham Football Club, he once resided in the original Craven Cottage, today the site of their stadium.

Bulwer-Lytton had long suffered with a disease of the ear and for the last two or three years of his life he lived in Torquay nursing his health.[26] Following an operation to cure deafness, an abscess formed in his ear and burst; he endured intense pain for a week and died at 2am on 18 January 1873 just short of his 70th birthday.[27] The cause of death was not clear but it was thought that the infection had affected his brain and caused a fit.[28] Rosina outlived him by nine years. Against his wishes, Bulwer-Lytton was honoured with a burial in Westminster Abbey.[29]

His unfinished history _Athens: Its Rise and Fall_ was published posthumously.


Career

published in _Vanity Fair_ in 1870]] Bulwer-Lytton began his career as a follower of Jeremy Bentham. In 1831 he was elected member for St Ives in Cornwall, after which he was returned for Lincoln in 1832, and sat in Parliament for that city for nine years. He spoke in favour of the Reform Bill, and took the leading part in securing the reduction, after vainly essaying the repeal, of the newspaper stamp duties. His influence was perhaps most keenly felt when, on the Whigs' dismissal from office in 1834, he issued a pamphlet entitled _A Letter to a Late Cabinet Minister on the Crisis_.[30] Lord Melbourne, then Prime Minister, offered him a lordship of the admiralty, which he declined as likely to interfere with his activity as an author.

He was created a BARONET, of Knebworth House in the County of Hertford, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom, in 1838.[31] In 1841, he left Parliament and did not return to politics until 1852, when, having differed from the policy of Lord John Russell over the Corn Laws, he stood for Hertfordshire as a Conservative. Lord Lytton held that seat until 1866, when he was raised to the peerage as BARON LYTTON of Knebworth in the County of Hertford. In 1858 he entered Lord Derby's government as Secretary of State for the Colonies, thus serving alongside his old friend Disraeli. In the House of Lords he was comparatively inactive.

British Columbia

When news of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush reached London, Bulwer-Lytton, who was Secretary of State for the Colonies, requested that the War Office recommend a field officer, "a man of good judgement possessing a knowledge of mankind", to lead a Corps of 150 (later increased to 172) Royal Engineers, who had been selected for their "superior discipline and intelligence".[32] The War Office chose Richard Clement Moody: and Lord Lytton, who described Moody as his "distinguished friend",[33] accepted the nomination, in view of Moody's military record, his success as Governor of the Falkland Islands, and the distinguished record of his father, Colonel Thomas Moody, Knight, at the Colonial Office.[34] Moody was charged to establish British order and to transform the newly established Colony of British Columbia (1858–66) into the British Empire's "bulwark in the farthest west"[35] and "found a second England on the shores of the Pacific."[36] Lytton desired to send to the colony "representatives of the best of British culture, not just a police force": he sought men who possessed "courtesy, high breeding and urbane knowledge of the world,"[37] and decided to send Moody, whom the Government considered to be the archetypal "English gentleman and British Officer."[38] at the head of the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment, to whom he wrote an impassioned letter.[39]

The former HBC Fort Dallas at Camchin, the confluence of the Thompson and Fraser Rivers, was renamed in his honour by Governor Sir James Douglas in 1858 as Lytton, British Columbia.[40]


Literary works

Bulwer-Lytton's literary career began in 1820, with the publication of a book of poems, and spanned much of the 19th century. He wrote in a variety of genres, including historical fiction, mystery, romance, the occult, and science fiction. He financed his extravagant life with a varied and prolific literary output, sometimes publishing anonymously.[41] ) frontispiece: Pelham's electioneering visit to the Rev. Combermere St Quintin, who is surprised at dinner with his family.]]

In 1828 _Pelham_ brought him public acclaim and established his reputation as a wit and dandy.[42] Its intricate plot and humorous, intimate portrayal of pre-Victorian dandyism kept gossips busy trying to associate public figures with characters in the book. _Pelham_ resembled Benjamin Disraeli's recent first novel _Vivian Grey_ (1827).[43] The character of the villainous Richard Crawford in _The Disowned_, also published in 1828, borrowed much from that of the banker and forger Henry Fauntleroy, who was hanged in London in 1824 before a crowd of some 100,000.[44]

Bulwer-Lytton admired Disraeli's father, Isaac D'Israeli, himself a noted author. They began corresponding in the late 1820s and met for the first time in March 1830, when Isaac D'Israeli dined at Bulwer-Lytton's house. (Also present that evening were Charles Pelham Villiers and Alexander Cockburn. The young Villiers was to have a long parliamentary career, while Cockburn became Lord Chief Justice of England in 1859.)

Bulwer-Lytton reached the height of his popularity with the publication of _Godolphin_ (1833). This was followed by _The Pilgrims of the Rhine_ (1834), _The Last Days of Pompeii_ (1834), _Rienzi, Last of the Roman Tribunes_ (1835),[45] _Leila; or, The Siege of Granada_ (1838) and _Harold, the Last of the Saxons_ (1848).[46] _The Last Days of Pompeii_ was inspired by Karl Briullov's painting, _The Last Day of Pompeii_, which Bulwer-Lytton saw in Milan.[47]

He also wrote the horror story "The Haunted and the Haunters" or "The House and the Brain" (1859).[48] Another novel dealing with a supernatural theme was _A Strange Story_ (1862), which was an influence on Bram Stoker's _Dracula_.[49]

Bulwer-Lytton penned many other works, including _The Coming Race_ or _Vril: The Power of the Coming Race_ (1871), which drew heavily on his interest in the occult and contributed to the early growth of the science fiction genre.[50] Its story of a subterranean race waiting to reclaim the surface of the Earth is an early science fiction theme. The book popularised the Hollow Earth theory and may have inspired Nazi mysticism.[51] His term "vril" lent its name to Bovril meat extract.[52] Adopted by theosophists and occultists since the 1870s, "vril" would develop into a major esoteric topic, and eventually become closely associated with the ideas of an esoteric neo-Nazism after 1945.[53]

His play _Money_ (1840) was first produced at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, London, on 8 December 1840. The first American production was at the Old Park Theater in New York on 1 February 1841. Subsequent productions include the Prince of Wales's Theatre's in 1872 and it was also the inaugural play at the new California Theatre in San Francisco in 1869.[54]

Among Bulwer-Lytton's lesser-known contributions to literature was that he convinced Charles Dickens to revise the ending of _Great Expectations_ to make it more palatable to the reading public, as in the original version of the novel, Pip and Estella do not get together.[55]


Legacy

Quotations

Bulwer-Lytton's most famous quotation, "The pen is mightier than the sword", is from his play _Richelieu_ where it appears in the line:

  beneath the rule of men entirely great, the pen is mightier than the sword

In addition, he popularized the phrase "pursuit of the almighty dollar" from his novel _The Coming Race_.[56]

He is also credited with "the great unwashed". He used this rather disparaging term in his 1830 novel _Paul Clifford_:

  He is certainly a man who bathes and "lives cleanly", (two especial charges preferred against him by Messrs. the Great Unwashed).[57]

_The Last Days of Pompeii_ has been cited as the first source, but inspection of the original text shows this to be wrong. However, the term "the Unwashed" with the same meaning, appears in _The Parisians_: "He says that Paris has grown so dirty since 4 September, that it is only fit for the feet of the Unwashed." _The Parisians_, though, was not published until 1872, while William Makepeace Thackeray's novel _Pendennis_ (1850) uses the phrase ironically, implying it was already established. The Oxford English Dictionary refers to "Messrs. the Great Unwashed" in Lytton's _Paul Clifford_ (1830), as the earliest instance.

Bulwer-Lytton is also credited with an appellation for the Germans: "Das Volk der Dichter und Denker" (The people of poets and thinkers).

Theosophy

Also the writers of theosophy were influenced by his work. Annie Besant and especially Helena Blavatsky incorporated his thoughts and ideas from particularly _The Last Days of Pompeii_, _Vril, the Power of the Coming Race_ and _Zanoni_ in her own books.[58][59]

Contest

Bulwer-Lytton's name lives on in the annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, in which contestants think up terrible openings for imaginary novels, inspired by the first line of his 1830 novel _Paul Clifford_:[60]

  It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents—except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.

Entrants in the contest seek to capture the rapid changes in point of view, the florid language, and the atmosphere of the full sentence. The opening was popularized by the _Peanuts_ comic strip, in which Snoopy's sessions on the typewriter usually began with It was a dark and stormy night.[61] The same words also form the first sentence of Madeleine L'Engle's Newbery Medal-winning novel _A Wrinkle in Time._ Similar wording appears in Edgar Allan Poe's 1831 short story, _The Bargain Lost_, although not at the very beginning. It reads:

  It was a dark and stormy night. The rain fell in cataracts; and drowsy citizens started, from dreams of the deluge, to gaze upon the boisterous sea, which foamed and bellowed for admittance into the proud towers and marble palaces. Who would have thought of passions so fierce in that calm water that slumbers all day long? At a slight alabaster stand, trembling beneath the ponderous tomes which it supported, sat the hero of our story.

Operas

Several of Bulwer-Lytton's novels were made into operas, one of which, _Rienzi, der Letzte der Tribunen_ (1842) by Richard Wagner, eventually became more famous than the novel. _Leonora_ (1846) by William Henry Fry, the first European-styled "grand" opera composed in the United States, is based on Bulwer-Lytton's play _The Lady of Lyons_, as is Frederic Cowen's first opera _Pauline_ (1876). Verdi rival Errico Petrella's most successful opera, _Jone_ (1858), was based upon Bulwer-Lytton's _The Last Days of Pompeii_, and was performed all over the world until the First World War. _Harold, the Last of the Saxons_ (1848) was the source for Verdi's opera _Aroldo_ in 1857.

Magazines

In 1831 Bulwer-Lytton became the editor of the _New Monthly_ but he resigned the following year. In 1841, he started the _Monthly Chronicle_, a semi-scientific magazine. During his career he wrote poetry, prose, and stage plays; his last novel was _Kenelm Chillingly_, which was in course of publication in _Blackwood’s Magazine_ at the time of his death in 1873.

Translations

Bulwer-Lytton's works of fiction and non-fiction were translated in his day and since then into many languages, including Serbian (by Laza Kostic), German, Russian, Norwegian, Swedish, French, Finnish, and Spanish. In 1879, his _Ernest Maltravers_ was the first complete novel from the West to be translated into Japanese.[62]

Place names

In Queensland, Australia the Brisbane suburb of Lytton is to be found on Bulwer Island which today is home to the Port of Brisbane. Also in Queensland on Moreton Island (Moorgumpin) is located another settlement by the name of Bulwer. The township of Lytton, Quebec (today part of Montcerf-Lytton) was named after him[63] as was Lytton, British Columbia, and Lytton, Iowa. Lytton Road in Gisborne, New Zealand was named after the novelist. Later a state secondary school, Lytton High School, was founded in the road.[64]

Portrayal on television

Bulwer-Lytton was portrayed by the actor Brett Usher in the 1978 television serial _Disraeli_.
