In traditional Chinese culture, QI or CH'I ( ) is believed to be a vital force forming part of any living entity.[1][2][3] _Qi_ translates as "air" and figuratively as "material energy", "life force", or "energy flow".[4] _Qi_ is the central underlying principle in Chinese traditional medicine and in Chinese martial arts. The practice of cultivating and balancing _qi_ is called _qigong_.

Believers of _qi_ describe it as a vital energy, the flow of which must be balanced for health. Qi is a pseudoscientific, unverified concept,[5][6] which has never been directly observed, and is unrelated to the concept of energy used in science[7][8][9] (vital energy itself being an abandoned scientific notion).[10]


Linguistic aspects

The cultural keyword _qì_ is analyzable in terms of Chinese and Sino-Xenic pronunciations. Possible etymologies include the logographs 氣, 气, and 気 with various meanings ranging from "vapor" to "anger", and the English loanword _qi_ or _ch'i_.

Pronunciation and etymology

The logograph 氣 is read with two Chinese pronunciations, the usual _qì_ 氣 "air; vital energy" and the rare archaic _xì_ 氣 "to present food" (later disambiguated with 餼).

Pronunciations of 氣 in modern varieties of Chinese with standardized IPA equivalents include: Standard Chinese _qì_ , Wu Chinese _qi_ , Southern Min _khì_ , Eastern Min _ké_ , Standard Cantonese _hei³_ , and Hakka Chinese _hi_ .

Pronunciations of 氣 in Sino-Xenic borrowings include: Japanese _ki_, Korean _gi_, and Vietnamese _khi_.

Reconstructions of the Middle Chinese pronunciation of 氣 standardized to IPA transcription include: /kʰe̯i^(H)/ (Bernard Karlgren), /kʰĭəi^(H)/ (Wang Li), /kʰiəi^(H)/ (Li Rong), /kʰɨj^(H)/ (Edwin Pulleyblank), and /kʰɨi^(H)/ (Zhengzhang Shangfang).

Reconstructions of the Old Chinese pronunciation of 氣 standardized to IPA transcription include: /*kʰɯds/ (Zhengzhang Shangfang) and /*C.qʰəp-s/ (William H. Baxter and Laurent Sagart).

The etymology of _qì_ interconnects with Kharia _kʰis_ "anger", Sora _kissa_ "move with great effort", Khmer _kʰɛs_ "strive after; endeavor", and Gyalrongic _kʰɐs_ "anger".[11]

Characters

In the East Asian languages, _qì_ has three logographs:

-   氣 is the traditional Chinese character, Korean _hanja_, and Japanese _kyūjitai_ ("old character form") _kanji_
-   気 is the Japanese _shinjitai_ ("new character form") _kanji_
-   气 is the simplified Chinese character.

In addition, _qì_ 炁 is an uncommon character especially used in writing Daoist talismans. Historically, the word _qì_ was generally written as 气 until the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), when it was replaced by the 氣 graph clarified with _mǐ_ 米 "rice" indicating "steam (rising from rice as it cooks.)"

This primary logograph 气, the earliest written character for _qì,_ consisted of three wavy horizontal lines seen in Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BCE) oracle bone script, Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BCE) bronzeware script and large seal script, and Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE) small seal script. These oracle, bronze, and seal scripts logographs 气 were used in ancient times as a phonetic loan character to write _qǐ_ 乞 "plead for; beg; ask" which did not have an early character.

The vast majority of Chinese characters are classified as radical-phonetic characters. Such characters combine a semantically suggestive "radical characters" with a phonetic element approximating ancient pronunciation. For example, the widely known word _dào_ 道 "the Dao; the way" graphically combines the "walk" radical 辶 with a _shǒu_ 首 "head" phonetic. Although the modern _dào_ and _shǒu_ pronunciations are dissimilar, the Old Chinese _*lˤuʔ-s_ 道 and _*l̥uʔ-s_ 首 were alike. The regular script character _qì_ 氣 is unusual because _qì_ 气 is both the "air radical" and the phonetic, with _mǐ_ 米 "rice" semantically indicating "steam; vapor".

This _qì_ 气 "air/gas radical" was only used in a few native Chinese characters like _yīnyūn_ 氤氲 "thick mist/smoke", but was also used to create new scientific characters for gaseous chemical elements. Some examples are based on pronunciations in European languages: _fú_ 氟 (with a _fú_ 弗 phonetic) "fluorine" and _nǎi_ 氖 (with a _nǎi_ 乃 phonetic) "neon". Others are based on semantics: _qīng_ 氫 (with a _jīng_ 巠 phonetic, abbreviating _qīng_ 輕 "light-weight") "hydrogen (the lightest element)" and _lǜ_ 氯 (with a _lù_ 彔 phonetic, abbreviating _lǜ_ 綠 "green") "(greenish-yellow) chlorine".

_Qì_ 氣 is the phonetic element in a few characters such as _kài_ 愾 "hate" with the "heart-mind radical" 忄or 心, _xì_ 熂 "set fire to weeds" with the "fire radical" 火, and _xì_ 餼 "to present food" with the "food radical" 食.

The first Chinese dictionary of characters, the _Shuowen Jiezi_(121 CE) notes that the primary _qì_ 气 is a pictographic character depicting 雲气 "cloudy vapors", and that the full 氣 combines 米 "rice" with the phonetic _qi_ 气, meaning 饋客芻米 "present provisions to guests" (later disambiguated as _xì_ 餼).

Meanings

Qi is a polysemous word. The unabridged Chinese-Chinese character dictionary _Hanyu Da Cidian_ defines it as "present food or provisions" for the _xì_ pronunciation but also lists 23 meanings for the _qì_ pronunciation.[12] The modern _ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary,_ which enters _xì_ 餼 "grain; animal feed; make a present of food", and a _qì_ 氣 entry with seven translation equivalents for the noun, two for bound morphemes, and three equivalents for the verb.

  N. ① air; gas ② smell ③ spirit; vigor; morale ④ vital/material energy (in Ch[inese] metaphysics) ⑤ tone; atmosphere; attitude ⑥ anger ⑦ breath; respiration B.F. ① weather 天氣 _tiānqì_ ② [linguistics] aspiration 送氣 _sòngqì_ V. ① anger ② get angry ③ bully; insult.[13]

English borrowing

Qi was an early Chinese loanword in English. It was romanized as _k'i_ in Church Romanization in the early-19th century, as _ch'i_ in Wade–Giles in the mid-19th century (sometimes misspelled _chi_ omitting the apostrophe), and as qi in Pinyin in the mid-20th century. The _Oxford English Dictionary_ entry for _qi_ gives the pronunciation as IPA (tʃi), the etymology from Chinese _qì_ "air; breath", and a definition of "The physical life-force postulated by certain Chinese philosophers; the material principle." It also gives eight usage examples, with the first recorded example of _k'í_ in 1850 (_The Chinese Repository_),[14] of _ch'i_ in 1917 (_The Encyclopaedia Sinica_),[15] and _qi_ in 1971 (Felix Mann's _Acupuncture_)[16]


Concept

References to concepts analogous to qi are found in many Asian belief systems. Philosophical conceptions of qi from the earliest records of Chinese philosophy (5th century BCE) correspond to Western notions of humours, the ancient Hindu yogic concept of _prana_, and the traditional Jewish concept of _nefesh_.[17] An early form of qi comes from the writings of the Chinese philosopher Mencius (4th century BCE).

The ancient Chinese described qi as "life force". They believed it permeated everything and linked their surroundings together. Qi was also linked to the flow of energy around and through the body, forming a cohesive functioning unit. By understanding the rhythm and flow of qi, they believed they could guide exercises and treatments to provide stability and longevity.

Although the concept has been important within many Chinese philosophies, over the centuries the descriptions of qi have varied and have sometimes been in conflict. Until China came into contact with Western scientific and philosophical ideas, the Chinese had not categorized all things in terms of matter and energy. Qi and _li_ (理: "pattern") were 'fundamental' categories similar to matter and energy.

Fairly early on, some Chinese thinkers began to believe that there were different fractions of qi—the coarsest and heaviest fractions formed solids, lighter fractions formed liquids, and the most ethereal fractions were the "lifebreath" that animated living beings.[18] _Yuanqi_ is a notion of innate or prenatal qi which is distinguished from acquired qi that a person may develop over their lifetime.


Philosophical roots

The earliest texts that speak of qi give some indications of how the concept developed. In the Analects of Confucius qi could mean "breath".[19] Combining it with the Chinese word for blood (making 血氣, _xue_–_qi_, blood and breath), the concept could be used to account for motivational characteristics:

The philosopher Mozi used the word qi to refer to noxious vapors that would eventually arise from a corpse were it not buried at a sufficient depth.[20] He reported that early civilized humans learned how to live in houses to protect their qi from the moisture that troubled them when they lived in caves.[21] He also associated maintaining one's qi with providing oneself with adequate nutrition.[22] In regard to another kind of qi, he recorded how some people performed a kind of prognostication by observing qi (clouds) in the sky.[23]

Mencius described a kind of qi that might be characterized as an individual's vital energies. This qi was necessary to activity and it could be controlled by a well-integrated willpower.[24] When properly nurtured, this qi was said to be capable of extending beyond the human body to reach throughout the universe.[25] It could also be augmented by means of careful exercise of one's moral capacities.[26] On the other hand, the qi of an individual could be degraded by adverse external forces that succeed in operating on that individual.[27]

Living things were not the only things believed to have qi. Zhuangzi indicated that wind is the _qi_ of the Earth.[28] Moreover, cosmic yin and yang "are the greatest of qi{{-"}}.[29] He described qi as "issuing forth" and creating profound effects.[30] He also said "Human beings are born [because of] the accumulation of _qi_. When it accumulates there is life. When it dissipates there is death... There is one _qi_ that connects and pervades everything in the world."[31]

Another passage traces life to intercourse between Heaven and Earth: "The highest Yin is the most restrained. The highest Yang is the most exuberant. The restrained comes forth from Heaven. The exuberant issues forth from Earth. The two intertwine and penetrate forming a harmony, and [as a result] things are born."[32]

The Guanzi essay _Neiye_ (Inward Training) is the oldest received writing on the subject of the cultivation of vapor _[qi]_ and meditation techniques. The essay was probably composed at the Jixia Academy in Qi in the late fourth century B.C.[33]

Xun Zi, another Confucian scholar of the Jixia Academy, followed in later years. At 9:69/127, Xun Zi says, "Fire and water have _qi_ but do not have life. Grasses and trees have life but do not have perceptivity. Fowl and beasts have perceptivity but do not have _yi_ (sense of right and wrong, duty, justice). Men have _qi_, life, perceptivity, and _yi_." Chinese people at such an early time had no concept of radiant energy, but they were aware that one can be heated by a campfire from a distance away from the fire. They accounted for this phenomenon by claiming "_qi_" radiated from fire. At 18:62/122, he also uses "_qi_" to refer to the vital forces of the body that decline with advanced age.

Among the animals, the gibbon and the crane were considered experts at inhaling the _qi_. The Confucian scholar Dong Zhongshu (ca. 150 BC) wrote in Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals:[34] "The gibbon resembles a macaque, but he is larger, and his color is black. His forearms being long, he lives eight hundred years, because he is expert in controlling his breathing." ("猿似猴。大而黑。長前臂。所以壽八百。好引氣也。")

Later, the syncretic text assembled under the direction of Liu An, the Huai Nan Zi, or "Masters of Huainan", has a passage that presages most of what is given greater detail by the Neo-Confucians:


Role in traditional Chinese medicine

The _Huangdi Neijing_ _(_"The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Medicine", circa 2nd century BCE) is historically credited with first establishing the pathways, called meridians, through which qi circulates in the human body.[35][36][37]

In traditional Chinese medicine, symptoms of various illnesses are believed to be either the product of disrupted, blocked, and unbalanced _qi_ movement through meridians or deficiencies and imbalances of qi in the _Zang Fu_ organs.[38] Traditional Chinese medicine often seeks to relieve these imbalances by adjusting the circulation of _qi_ using a variety of techniques including herbology, food therapy, physical training regimens (qigong, t'ai chi ch'uan, and other martial arts training),[39] moxibustion, _tui na_, or acupuncture.[40]

The nomenclature of Qi in the human body is different depending on its sources, roles, and locations.[41] For sources there is a difference between so-called "Primordial Qi" (acquired at birth from one's parents) and Qi acquired throughout one's life.[42] Or again Chinese medicine differentiates between Qi acquired from the air we breathe (so called "Clean Air") and Qi acquired from food and drinks (so-called "Grain Qi"). Looking at roles Qi is divided into "Defensive Qi" and "Nutritive Qi".[43] Defensive Qi's role is to defend the body against invasions while Nutritive Qi's role is to provide sustenance for the body. Lastly, looking at locations, Qi is also named after the Zang-Fu organ or the Meridian in which it resides:[44] "Liver Qi", "Spleen Qi", etc.

A qi field (_chu-chong_) refers to the cultivation of an energy field by a group, typically for healing or other benevolent purposes. A qi field is believed to be produced by visualization and affirmation. They are an important component of Wisdom Healing'Qigong (_Zhineng Qigong_), founded by Grandmaster Ming Pang.[45][46][47]


Comparable concepts

Concepts similar to qi can be found in many cultures.

Religious beliefs

_Prana_ in Hinduism and Indian culture, _chi_ in the Igbo religion, _pneuma_ in ancient Greece, _mana_ in Hawaiian culture, _lüng_ in Tibetan Buddhism, _manitou_ in the culture of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, _ruah_ in Jewish culture. In Western philosophy, notions of _energeia_, _élan vital_, or vitalism are purported to be similar.[48]

Some elements of the _qi_ concept can be found in the term 'energy' when used in the context of various esoteric forms of spirituality and alternative medicine.


Scientific view

Qi is a non-scientific, unverifiable concept.[49] A 1997 consensus statement on acupuncture by the United States National Institutes of Health noted that concepts such as qi "are difficult to reconcile with contemporary biomedical information".[50]

The 2014 Skeptoid podcast episode titled "Your Body's Alleged Energy Fields" related a Reiki practitioner's report of what was happening as she passed her hands over a subject's body:

Evaluating these claims, author and scientific skeptic Brian Dunning reported:


Practices involving qi

Feng shui

The traditional Chinese art of geomancy, the placement and arrangement of space called feng shui, is based on calculating the balance of qi, interactions between the five elements, yin and yang, and other factors. The retention or dissipation of qi is believed to affect the health, wealth, energy level, luck, and many other aspects of the occupants. Attributes of each item in a space affect the flow of qi by slowing it down, redirecting it or accelerating it. This is said to influence the energy level of the occupants.

One use for a _luopan_ is to detect the flow of qi.[51] The quality of qi may rise and fall over time. Feng shui with a compass might be considered a form of divination that assesses the quality of the local environment.

Qigong

Qìgōng (气功 or 氣功) involves coordinated breathing, movement, and awareness. It is traditionally viewed as a practice to cultivate and balance qi. With roots in traditional Chinese medicine, philosophy and martial arts, _qigong_ is now practiced worldwide for exercise, healing, meditation, and training for martial arts. Typically a _qigong_ practice involves rhythmic breathing, slow and stylized movement, a mindful state, and visualization of guiding qi.[52][53][54]

Martial arts

Qi is a didactic concept in many Chinese, Korean and Japanese martial arts. Martial qigong is a feature of both internal and external training systems in China[55] and other East Asian cultures.[56] The most notable of the qi-focused "internal" force (jin) martial arts are Baguazhang, Xing Yi Quan, T'ai Chi Ch'uan, Southern Praying Mantis, Snake Kung Fu, Southern Dragon Kung Fu, Aikido, Kendo, Hapkido, Aikijujutsu, Luohan Quan, and Liu He Ba Fa.

Demonstrations of _qi_ or _ki_ are popular in some martial arts and may include the unraisable body, the unbendable arm, and other feats of power. Some of these feats can alternatively be explained using biomechanics and physics.[57]

Acupuncture and moxibustion

Acupuncture is a part of traditional Chinese medicine that involves insertion of needles into superficial structures of the body (skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles) at acupuncture points to balance the flow of qi. This is often accompanied by moxibustion, a treatment that involves burning mugwort on or near the skin at an acupuncture point.
