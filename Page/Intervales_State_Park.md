History

The Intervales State Park originated with the Fazenda Intervales (Intervalley Farm), which was managed by Banco Banespa until 1986. From 1987 it was managed as a park by the Forest Foundation. 97% of the park was the former farm, owned by the Forest Foundation, and the remainder was vacant land owned by the state. A 1991 UNESCO resolution included the fazenda in the nucleus of the Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve.

The Intervales State Park was formally created by state decree 40.135 of 8 June 1995. In 1999 UNESCO declared it as a Natural World Heritage Site. The park boundaries were altered by decrees 44.293 of 1999 and law 10.850 of 2001. As of 2008 the park was well staffed, with 92 personnel in different roles. There were about 9,000 visitors each year.
