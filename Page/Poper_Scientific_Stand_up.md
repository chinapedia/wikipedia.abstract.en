POPER SCIENTIFIC STAND UP is the first Latin American stand-up comedy group that is engaged in the popularization of science. It is an independent continuation of an early 2015 initiative by Diego Golombek, which was made in conjunction with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Tecnopolis and TECtv.[1] The proposal was to invite university students and graduates of different science fields to participate in a Scientific Stand Up comedy course given by renowned humorist Diego Wainstein, for them to create monologues with scientific content. Using the Stand Up format as a resource, they speak about scientific topics to all age groups, whether they have previous knowledge or not, and they also talk about scientists as people and about the perception of science in society. The name "Poper" is a pun on the initials of _"Popularización Entre Risas"_ (Popularizing Among Laughter), and a tribute to Epistemologist Karl Popper.


Origins and formation

In early 2015, the Argentine Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, alongside with Tecnopolis and TECtv,[2] organized the first Argentine course of Scientific Stand Up, in order to provide innovative teaching tools for the popularization of science. About 200 people enrolled in the course, and 30 were selected to take part in it, chosen for their scientific, artistic and general backgrounds. Those selected were undergraduates, graduates and researchers who had developed different activities in several scientific institutions in Argentina. The course content included several stand-up techniques such as character building, creating stand-up routines, jokes building, working with props and microphones, vocal work, body language, and communication with the public. During the course, each participant produced monologues that were later exhibited in Tecnopolis, under the name "Humor Científico,"[3] in 18 shows. They were well received by a diverse audience, which was composed mainly by people outside scientific fields, reaching around 900 spectators a show. After the completion of this course, some of its graduates formed Poper Scientific Stand Up.[4]

TV

In October 2016 the signal TECtv announced it is working on a TV show with the comedian Poper group and Dalia Gutmann.[16] It was filmed in the Crash Hall of the City of Buenos Aires, the Polo Scientific Technology and Avenida Corrientes.


Curiosities

-   In the show Tecnopolis used as opening and closing the soundtrack of the film Star Wars, however during shows at La Casa de la Comedia did with Baby's on Fire Die Antwoord.
-   The Tecnopolis debut was against 945 people and after the first weekend had joined more than 3,000 people in four shows.[17]
-   A confusing situation lived in Tecnopolis when one of the weekly functions in Ship Science was suspended because the stage was being used for a conference of Evangelical Pastors as part of Jesus Fest.[18]
-   The first show for schools did in the Belgrano San Roman College, where he was attending in the 60s known rock musician Luis Alberto Spinetta.[19]
-   Many of the members had had a relationship in the past not only as fellow scientists, if not sharing scenarios, such as student-teacher or outreach projects.
-   Were hosts at the Awards Tecnox 2015 (Latin American Students Applying Technologies). Its function was to conduct the ceremony sandwiching comedy acts. However, minutes before the start, a blackout surprised all the Aula Magna of the Faculty of Natural Sciences where prizes were given. True to the style of the group took the situation with humor and conducted the ceremony illuminated by a single lamp, cell and a pair of lanterns lit from the public.
-   The thematic variety of the group went beyond the artistic and several members who were not known for his scientific work to be completed different disciplines together in publishing scientific journals.
-   They have shared the stage with the group of scientists monologues Uruguayans "Scientific Bardo" both Montevideo and Buenos Aires.[20]
