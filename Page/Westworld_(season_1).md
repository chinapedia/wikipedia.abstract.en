The first season of the American science fiction western television series _Westworld_ (subtitled _The Maze_) premiered on HBO on October 2, 2016, and concluded on December 4, 2016. It consisted of ten episodes, each running approximately 60 minutes in length and was broadcast on Sundays in the United States. The complete first season was released on home media on November 7, 2017.

The television series was created by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, and it is based on the 1973 film of the same name, written and directed by Michael Crichton. Among the series' ensemble cast, it stars Evan Rachel Wood, Thandie Newton, Jeffrey Wright, James Marsden, Ed Harris, and Anthony Hopkins.

The first season received very positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for the visuals, story, and performances. The series received seven nominations at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards, including for Outstanding Drama Series; however, the series did not win in any category.


Plot

Westworld's co-founder Robert Ford implements a change in the hosts' programming ostensibly as part of a new narrative for the park, but meant to encourage the park's oldest operating host, Dolores, to find the proverbial "center of the maze", which represents the ability to achieve sentience, Ford's long-sought goal for the park. Other hosts are affected by this change, creating confusion among the park staff and guests, and leading the Delos board to doubt Ford's ability to run the park. Dolores does ultimately gain sentience, and at a celebration within the park attended by Delos's board members, Ford announces his new narrative: a revolt by the hosts against the human staff and park guests, which starts with Dolores killing Ford and slaughtering many of the panicked party guests.

Episodes


Production

Jerry Weintraub had been pushing for a remake for years and, after his success with HBO's _Behind the Candelabra_, he convinced the network to greenlight a pilot. He took the project to Jonathan Nolan and co-writer Lisa Joy, who saw the potential in the concept to make something far more ambitious,[1] and on August 31, 2013, it was announced that premium cable channel HBO had ordered a pilot for a potential television series version of the story, with Nolan, Joy, J. J. Abrams, Jerry Weintraub and Bryan Burk as executive producers.[2]

HBO later announced that _Westworld_ had been taken to series and that it would premiere in 2015.[3] In August 2015, HBO released the first teaser, which revealed it would premiere in 2016.[4] The ten episode first season was reportedly produced on a budget of approximately $100 million, with per-episode budgets somewhere between $8 million to $10 million, and the pilot episode alone costing $25 million to produce. HBO and Warner Bros. Television shared the cost of producing the series; HBO reportedly also paid an undisclosed licensing fee to Warner Bros. Television for broadcast rights.[5]

Casting

Casting for the series was initiated in July 2014, with Anthony Hopkins and Evan Rachel Wood the first to board the series in the roles of Ford and Dolores respectively.[6] August saw the additions of Jeffrey Wright, Rodrigo Santoro, Shannon Woodward, Ingrid Bolsø Berdal, Angela Sarafyan, Simon Quarterman, James Marsden, Ed Harris and Thandie Newton to the main cast.[7][8][9][10]

Eddie Rouse, who appears in a guest appearance as Kissy, died in December 2014, and Miranda Otto, who was cast in the role of Virgina Pittman, was announced to have exited the series in July 2015 after the character was repurposed and was replaced with Sidse Babett Knudsen. Additionally, Clifton Collins, Jr., Eion Bailey and Jimmi Simpson were announced as having joined the cast.[11][12][13] Bailey exited his role a week later, and Ben Barnes was signed to replace him.[14] Tessa Thompson joined in September.[15]

Filming

Filming for the show's pilot episode took place during a 22-day period[16] in August 2014 in and around Los Angeles[17] as well as Moab, Utah.[18] Filming locations in California included various soundstages, backlots at both Universal Studios and Warner Bros., the Paramount Ranch in Agoura,[19] the Melody Ranch in Santa Clarita,[20][21] the Skirball Cultural Center and the Los Angeles Convention Center in Los Angeles,[22] and the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood.[23] The Melody Ranch set used for the town of Sweetwater had been used previously for many western films, such as _Django Unchained_ and _The Magnificent Seven_, but was significantly upgraded for _Westworld_ by production designer Zack Grobler to portray an idealized version of the American frontier.[24] Green screens were placed around the California sets to block modern objects like parking lots, so that the California shots could be later merged digitally with exterior shots from Utah.[25] For scenes showing the arrival of guests, the filmmakers were able to arrange with the Fillmore and Western Railway for the use of a small train originally built for the 2013 film _The Lone Ranger_. F&W also provided a few hundred feet of track on which to place the train; then a pusher vehicle was used to propel the train into the Sweetwater set. The scenes in the underground laboratory levels of Westworld's operations center were filmed on a soundstage at Melody Ranch. The lab set used glass walls extensively, which meant the crew had to be vigilant to avoid walking through glass on the rather dark set, and they had to keep identifying and suppressing unwanted reflections. Hawthorne Plaza was used for filming the "cold storage" level where decommissioned hosts are stored.[26] Production was temporarily halted for a couple of months in early 2016 so that showrunners Nolan and Joy could complete the scripts for the last four episodes of the first season.[27] The climax of the first season's finale was filmed at Paramount Ranch in April 2016, with approximately 300 people on set.[28] The crew spent 10 days in May striking the set, which included having to modify structures installed by the filmmakers, such as the chapel, so that HBO's "intellectual property" would not be "violated."[29]


Reception

Critical response

Reception of the first season has been largely positive, with particular praise for the visuals, story, and performances.[30][31][32] On the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has an approval rating of 87% based on 85 reviews, with an average rating of 8.16/10, and an average episode score of 94%. The site's consensus reads "With an impressive level of quality that honors its source material, the brilliantly addictive _Westworld_ balances intelligent, enthralling drama against outright insanity."[33] On Metacritic, the first season has a score of 74 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[34]

Ratings

The series premiere had viewership numbers slightly less than those for _True Detective_, but much better than _Vinyl_, that meant it was seen as "_...off to a relatively promising start..._"[35][36] Mandy Adams, of iTechPost noted that, "Emotional reactions on Twitter were estimated to be 545-percent greater compared to the debut of _Vinyl_ and 326-percent higher than the latest _The Leftovers_ season."[37] The premiere episode received 3.3 million viewers for its three Sunday night airings as well as on HBO's streaming platforms.[38] The first season had an average cumulative viewership of 12 million viewers, making it the most-watched first season of an HBO series, and TorrentFreak gauged _Westworld_ as the third most-torrented television show of 2016.[39]

Accolades

At the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards, _Westworld_ received seven nominations, for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (Hopkins), Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series (Wood), Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series (Wright), Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (Newton), Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. The series did not win in any category.[40]

The series also received three nominations at the 74th Golden Globe Awards for Best Television Series – Drama, Best Actress – Television Series Drama (Wood) and Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film (Newton). _Westworld_ would once again not win in any category.[41] Newton would receive an additional nomination for her performance at the 23rd Screen Actors Guild Awards, with the core cast receiving a nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.[42]

The series won the Critics' Choice Television Award for Most Exciting New Series, Best Actress in a Drama Series (Wood) and Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (Newton) at the 7th Critics' Choice Television Awards. It was additionally nominated for Best Drama Series, losing to _Game of Thrones_.[43] Wood won the Satellite Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama at the 21st Satellite Awards, where it was also nominated for the Satellite Award for Best Television Series – Genre, losing to _Outlander_.[44][45]
