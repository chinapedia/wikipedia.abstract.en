Publication history

The miniseries was first announced in October 2016.[1][2] During an interview with entertainment media news site _Bleeding Cool_, Robinson indicated that he had an idea for a trilogy involving Leiter if the first series performs commercially well, as well as eventually being able to grow into a solo series if the project sold well .[3] A full collected edition of all the issues of the first series was published in hardcover format in November 2017.
