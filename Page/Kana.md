are syllabic Japanese scripts, a part of the Japanese writing system contrasted with the logographic Chinese characters known in Japan as kanji (). There are three kana scripts: modern cursive hiragana ();[1] modern angular katakana (); and the old syllabic use of kanji known as man'yōgana () that was ancestral to both. Hentaigana (, "variant kana") are historical variants of modern standard hiragana. In modern Japanese, hiragana and katakana have directly corresponding character sets (different sets of characters representing the same sounds).

Katakana with a few additions is also used to write Ainu. Taiwanese kana was used in Taiwanese Hokkien as a gloss (_furigana_) for Chinese characters during Taiwan under Japanese rule.

Each kana character (syllabogram) corresponds to one sound in the Japanese language. This is always CV (consonant onset with vowel nucleus), such as _ka_, _ki_, etc., or V (vowel), such as _a_, _i_, etc., with the sole exception of the C grapheme for nasal codas usually romanised as _n_. This structure had made some scholars label the system _moraic_ instead of _syllabic_, because it requires the combination of two syllabograms to represent a CVC syllable with coda (i.e. CV_n_, CV_m_, CV_ng_), a CVV syllable with complex nucleus (i.e. multiple or expressively long vowels), or a CCV syllable with complex onset (i.e. including a glide, C_y_V, C_w_V).

Due to the limited number of phonemes in Japanese, as well as the relatively rigid syllable structure, the kana system is a very accurate representation of spoken Japanese.

-   There are presently no kana for _ye_, _yi_ or _wu_, as corresponding syllables do not occur in modern Japanese natively.
    -   The (_ye_) sound is believed to have existed in pre-Classical Japanese, mostly prior to the advent of kana, and can be represented by the man'yōgana kanji 江.[2][3] There was an archaic Hiragana ()[4] derived from the man'yōgana _ye_ kanji 江,[5] which is encoded into Unicode at code point U+1B001 (𛀁),[6][7] but it is not widely supported. It is believed that _e_ and _ye_ become both pronounced mostly as _ye_, and that the pronunciation _e_ surpassed _ye_ during the Edo period.[8] A hiragana _we_, ゑ, which also came to be pronounced as (_ye_), as demonstrated by 17th century-era European sources,[9] still exists but is considered archaic, and it was eliminated from official orthography in 1946. In modern orthography, if necessary, [je] (_ye_) may be written as いぇ (イェ); however, this usage is limited and nonstandard.
    -   The modern Katakana _e_, エ, derives from the man'yōgana 江, originally pronounced _ye_;[10] a "Katakana letter Archaic E" () derived from the man'yōgana 衣 (_e_)[11] is encoded into Unicode at code point U+1B000 (𛀀),[12] due to being used for that purpose in scholarly works on classical Japanese.[13]
    -   Some gojūon tables published during the 19th century list additional Katakana in the _ye_ (), _wu_ () and _yi_ () positions.[14] These are not presently used, and the latter two sounds never existed in Japanese.[15][16] They do not presently exist in Unicode. These sources also list (Unicode U+1B006, 𛀆) in the Hiragana _yi_ position, and in the _ye_ position.[17]
-   While no longer part of standard Japanese orthography, _wi_ and _we_ are sometimes used stylistically, as in ウヰスキー for _whisky_ and ヱビス or ゑびす for Japanese kami Ebisu, and Yebisu, a brand of beer named after Ebisu. Hiragana _wi_ and _we_ are still used in certain Okinawan scripts, while katakana _wi_ and _we_ are still used in Ainu.
-   _wo_ is preserved only in a single use, as a grammatical particle, normally written in hiragana.
-   _si_, _ti_, _tu_, _hu_, _wi_, _we_ and _wo_ are often romanized respectively as _shi_, _chi_, _tsu_, _fu_, _i_, _e_ and _o_ instead, according to contemporary pronunciation.

Diacritics

Syllables beginning with the voiced consonants [g], [z], [d] and [b] are spelled with kana from the corresponding unvoiced columns (_k_, _s_, _t_ and _h_) and the voicing mark, _dakuten_. Syllables beginning with [p] are spelled with kana from the _h_ column and the half-voicing mark, _handakuten_.

        _g_     _z_     _d_     _b_     _p_     _ng_
  ----- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- -----------
  _a_   が ガ   ざ ザ   だ ダ   ば バ   ぱ パ   か゚ カ゚
  _i_   ぎ ギ   じ ジ   ぢ ヂ   び ビ   ぴ ピ   き゚ キ゚
  _u_   ぐ グ   ず ズ   づ ヅ   ぶ ブ   ぷ プ   く゚ ク゚
  _e_   げ ゲ   ぜ ゼ   で デ   べ ベ   ぺ ペ   け゚ ケ゚
  _o_   ご ゴ   ぞ ゾ   ど ド   ぼ ボ   ぽ ポ   こ゚ コ゚

  : Dakuten diacritic marks, hiragana (left) and katakana (right)

-   Note that the か゚, カ゚ and remaining entries in the rightmost column, though they exist, are not used in standard Japanese orthography.
-   _zi_, _di_, and _du_ are often transcribed into English as _ji_, _ji_, and _zu_ instead, respectively, according to contemporary pronunciation.
-   Usually, [va], [vi], [vu], [ve], [vo] are represented respectively by バ[ba], ビ[bi], ブ[bu], ベ[be], and ボ[bo], for example, in loanwords such as バイオリン (_baiorin_ "violin"), but (less usually) the distinction can be preserved by using ヴァ, ヴィ, ヴ, ヴェ, and ヴォ. Note that ヴ did not have a JIS-encoded Hiragana form (ゔ) until JIS X 0213, meaning that many Shift_JIS flavours (including the Windows and HTML5 version) can only represent it as a katakana, although Unicode supports both.

Digraphs

Syllables beginning with palatalized consonants are spelled with one of the seven consonantal kana from the _i_ row followed by small _ya_, _yu_ or _yo_. These digraphs are called yōon.

         _k_    _s_    _t_    _n_    _h_    _m_    _r_
  ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
  _ya_   きゃ   しゃ   ちゃ   にゃ   ひゃ   みゃ   りゃ
  _yu_   きゅ   しゅ   ちゅ   にゅ   ひゅ   みゅ   りゅ
  _yo_   きょ   しょ   ちょ   にょ   ひょ   みょ   りょ

  : Yōon digraphs, hiragana

-   There are no digraphs for the semivowel _y_ and _w_ columns.
-   The digraphs are usually transcribed with three letters, leaving out the _i_: C_y_V. For example, きゃ is transcribed as _kya_.
-   _si_+_y_* and _ti_+_y_* are often transcribed _sh*_ and _ch*_ instead of _sy*_ and _ty*_. For example, しゃ is transcribed as _sha_.
-   In earlier Japanese, digraphs could also be formed with _w_-kana. Although obsolete in modern Japanese, the digraphs くゎ (/kʷa/) and くゐ/くうぃ(/kʷi/), are still used in certain Okinawan orthographies. In addition, the kana え can be used in Okinawan to form the digraph くぇ, which represents the /kʷe/ sound.

         _g_    _j_    _b_    _p_    _ng_
  ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ --------
  _ya_   ぎゃ   じゃ   びゃ   ぴゃ   き゚ゃ
  _yu_   ぎゅ   じゅ   びゅ   ぴゅ   き゚ゅ
  _yo_   ぎょ   じょ   びょ   ぴょ   き゚ょ

  : Yōon digraphs, hiragana

-   Note that the き゚ゃ, き゚ゅ and remaining entries in the rightmost column, though they exist, are not used in standard Japanese orthography.
-   _jya_, _jyu_, and _jyo_ are often transcribed into English as _ja_, _ju_, and _jo_ instead, respectively, according to contemporary pronunciation.


Modern usage

The difference in usage between hiragana and katakana is stylistic. Usually, hiragana is the default syllabary, and katakana is used in certain special cases.

Hiragana is used to write native Japanese words with no kanji representation (or whose kanji is thought obscure or difficult), as well as grammatical elements such as particles and inflections (okurigana).

Today katakana is most commonly used to write words of foreign origin that do not have kanji representations, as well as foreign personal and place names. Katakana is also used to represent onomatopoeia and interjections, emphasis, technical and scientific terms, transcriptions of the Sino-Japanese readings of kanji, and some corporate branding.

Kana can be written in small form above or next to lesser-known kanji in order to show pronunciation; this is called furigana. Furigana is used most widely in children's or learners' books. Literature for young children who do not yet know kanji may dispense with it altogether and instead use hiragana combined with spaces.


History

The first kana was a system called _man'yōgana,_ a set of kanji used solely for their phonetic values, much as Chinese uses characters for their phonetic values in foreign loanwords (especially proper nouns) today. _Man'yōshū_, a poetry anthology assembled in 759, is written in this early script. Hiragana developed as a distinct script from cursive _man'yōgana_, whereas katakana developed from abbreviated parts of regular script _man'yōgana_ as a glossing system to add readings or explanations to Buddhist sutras.

Kana is traditionally said to have been invented by the Buddhist priest Kūkai in the ninth century. Kūkai certainly brought the Siddhaṃ script of India home on his return from China in 806; his interest in the sacred aspects of speech and writing led him to the conclusion that Japanese would be better represented by a phonetic alphabet than by the kanji which had been used up to that point. The modern arrangement of kana reflects that of Siddhaṃ, but the traditional _iroha_ arrangement follows a poem which uses each kana once.

The present set of kana was codified in 1900, and rules for their usage in 1946.[18]

        a     i     u     e     o     =:≠
  ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -------
  -     ≠     ≠     =     ≠     =     2:3
  k     =     =     =     ≠     =     4:1
  s     ≠     =     ≠     =     =     3:2
  t     ≠     ≠     =     =     =     3:2
  n     =     =     =     =     =     5:0

  m     =     ≠     ≠     =     =     3:2

Collation

Kana are the basis for collation in Japanese. They are taken in the order given by the _gojūon_ (あ い う え お … わ を ん), though iroha (い ろ は に ほ へ と … せ す (ん)) ordering is used for enumeration in some circumstances. Dictionaries differ in the sequence order for long/short vowel distinction, small _tsu_ and diacritics. As Japanese does not use word spaces (except as a tool for children), there can be no word-by-word collation; all collation is kana-by-kana.


In Unicode

The hiragana range in Unicode is U+3040 ... U+309F, and the katakana range is U+30A0 ... U+30FF. The obsolete and rare characters (_wi_ and _we_) also have their proper code points.

Characters U+3095 and U+3096 are hiragana small _ka_ and small _ke_, respectively. U+30F5 and U+30F6 are their katakana equivalents. Characters U+3099 and U+309A are combining dakuten and handakuten, which correspond to the spacing characters U+309B and U+309C. U+309D is the hiragana iteration mark, used to repeat a previous hiragana. U+309E is the voiced hiragana iteration mark, which stands in for the previous hiragana but with the consonant voiced (_k_ becomes _g_, _h_ becomes _b_, etc.). U+30FD and U+30FE are the katakana iteration marks. U+309F is a ligature of _yori_ (より) sometimes used in vertical writing. U+30FF is a ligature of _koto_ (コト), also found in vertical writing.

Additionally, there are halfwidth equivalents to the standard fullwidth katakana. These are encoded within the Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms block (U+FF00–U+FFEF), starting at U+FF65 and ending at U+FF9F (characters U+FF61–U+FF64 are halfwidth punctuation marks):

There is also a small "Katakana Phonetic Extensions" range (U+31F0 ... U+31FF), which includes some additional small kana characters for writing the Ainu language. Further small kana characters are present in the "Small Kana Extension" block.

Unicode also includes "Katakana letter archaic E" (U+1B000), as well as 255 archaic Hiragana, in the Kana Supplement block.[19] It also includes a further 31 archaic Hiragana in the Kana Extended-A block.[20]
