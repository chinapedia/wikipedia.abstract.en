MELTDOWN is a French bar chain dedicated to video games and eSports.


History

Based on the idea of a permanent Barcraft, the first bar Meltdown was established in 2012 in Paris in a small bistro on rue Albert-Thomas.[1] It streamed eSports competitions and had computers and consoles available for use by its clientele. The bar moved to a new location on , in the 11th arrondissement of Paris on December 21, 2013.

Meltdown is developing in France and abroad with a franchise platform. There are 20 bars in 7 countries.[2]

Model

Meltdown has a menu of cocktails inspired by the video game universe.[3]

A schedule, varying depending on the city, highlights one specific game each day of the week, with the organisation of a free access tournament. Outside of tournament hours, computers and consoles are available for customers to play games.[4]

Meltdown bars broadcast major eSports[5] competitions on their screens. Meltdown has had a presence at gaming conventions such as Paris Games Week and Dreamhack.

Professional Players

A team of professional players was created by Meltdown in 2014. The first player to wear its colors was Olivier “Louffy” Hay,[6] followed by Ilyes “Stephano” Satouri.[7] The player Florent “Neo” Lecoanet, a world champion of Super Mario Kart, has since joined the team.
