TETRAMETHYLUREA is the organic compound with the formula (Me₂N)₂CO. It is a substituted urea. This colorless liquid is used as an aprotic-polar solvent , especially for aromatic compounds and is used e. g. for Grignard reagents.[1]


Production

The synthesis and properties of tetramethylurea were comprehensively described.[2]

The reaction of dimethylamine with phosgene in the presence of e. g. 50 % sodium hydroxide solution and subsequent extraction with 1,2-dichloroethane yields tetramethylurea in 95% yield.[3]

The reactions with dimethylcarbamoyl chloride or phosgene are highly exothermic and the removal of the resulting dimethylamine hydrochloride requires some effort.[4]

The reaction of diphenylcarbonate with dimethylamine in an autoclave is also effective.

Tetramethylurea is formed in the reaction of dimethylcarbamoyl chloride with anhydrous sodium carbonate in a yield of 96.5%.[5]

Dimethylcarbamoyl chloride also reacts with excess dimethylamine forming tetramethylurea. Even though the product is contaminated and smelly it may be purified by addition of calcium oxide and subsequent fractional distillation.[6]

Tetramethylurea is also formed during the oxidation of tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene (TDAE), a very electron-rich alkene[7] and a strong reducing agent, available from tris(dimethylamino)methane by pyrolysis[8] or from chlorotrifluoroethene and dimethylamine.[9]

Tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene (TDAE) reacts with oxygen in a (2+2) cycloaddition reaction to a 1,2-dioxetane which decomposes to electronically excited tetramethylurea. This returns to the ground state while emitting green light with an emission maximum at 515 nm.[10][11]

Properties

Tetramethylurea is a clear, colorless liquid with mild aromatic odor that is miscible with water and many organic solvents.[12] Unusual for an urea is the liquid state of tetramethylurea in a range of > 170 °C.


Applications

Tetramethylurea is miscible with a variety of organic compounds, including acids such as acetic acid or bases such as pyridine and an excellent solvent for organic substances such as ε-caprolactam or benzoic acid and dissolves even some inorganic salts such as silver nitrate or sodium iodide.[13][14] Due to its distinct solvent properties tetramethylurea is often used as a replacement for the carcinogenic hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPT).[15]

Tetramethylurea is suitable as a reaction medium for the polymerization of aromatic diacid chlorides (such as isophthalic acid) and aromatic diamines (such as 1,3-diaminobenzene (m-phenylenediamine)) to aramids such as poly (m-phenylene isophthalamide) (Nomex®)[16][17]

The polymerization of 4-amino benzoic acid chloride hydrochloride in tetramethylurea provides isotropic viscous solutions of poly(p-benzamide) (PPB), which can be directly spun into fibers.[18]

In a tetramethylurea-LiCl mixture stable isotropic solutions can be obtained up to a PPB polymer concentration of 14%.[19]

Tetramethylurea also dissolves cellulose ester and swells other polymers such as polycarbonates, polyvinyl chloride or aliphatic polyamides, usually at elevated temperature.[20]

Strong and hindered non-nucleophilic guanidine bases are accessible from tetramethylurea in a simple manner,[21][22] which are in contrast to the fused amidine bases DBN or DBU not alkylated.

A modification of the Koenigs-Knorr reaction for building glycosides from 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-α-D-glucopyranosyl bromide (acetobromoglucose) originates from S. Hanessian who used the silver salt silver trifluoromethanesulfonate (TfOAg) and as a proton acceptor tetramethylurea.[23] This process variant is characterized by a simplified process control, high anomeric purity and high yields of the products. If the reaction is carried out with acetobromoglucose and silver triflate/tetramethylurea at room temperature, then tetramethylurea reacts not only as a base, but also with the glycosyl to form a good isolable uroniumtriflates in 56% yield.[24]

Safety

The acute toxicity of tetramethylurea is moderate. However, it is embryotoxic and teratogenic towards several animal species.[25]
