Lorenz_Chrysanth_Vest.jpg.]] LORENZ CHRYSANTH VON VEST (18 November 1776, in Klagenfurt – 15 December 1840, in Graz) was an Austrian physician and botanist.

He studied medicine in Vienna and at the University of Freiburg, where in 1798 he received his doctorate. After a stint in the military, he settled into a medical practice in his hometown of Klagenfurt (1800). From 1804 to 1812 he taught classes in theoretical and practical medicine at the lyceum in Klagenfurt, and afterwards worked as a professor of botany and chemistry at the Johanneum in Graz. In 1829 he was appointed chief regional physician and health advisor to the Styrian government.[1][2]

In 1809 the plant genus _Vestia_ (family Solanaceae) was named on his honor by Carl Ludwig Willdenow.[3]
