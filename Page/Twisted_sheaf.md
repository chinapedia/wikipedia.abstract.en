In mathematics, a TWISTED SHEAF is a variant of a coherent sheaf. Precisely, it is specified by: an open covering in the étale topology _U__(_i_), coherent sheaves _F__(_i_) over _U__(_i_), a Čech 2-cocycle _θ_ on the covering _U__(_i_) as well as the isomorphisms

$$g_{ij}: F_j|_{U_{ij}} \overset{\sim}\to F_i|_{U_{ij}}$$
satisfying

-   g_(ii) = id_(F_(i)),
-   g_(ij) = g_(ji)^( − 1),
-   g_(ij) ∘ g_(jk) ∘ g_(ki) = θ_(ijk)id_(F_(i)).

The notion of twisted sheaves was introduced by Giraud. The above definition due to Căldăraru is down-to-earth but is equivalent to a more sophisticated definition in terms of gerbe; see § 2.1.3 of .
