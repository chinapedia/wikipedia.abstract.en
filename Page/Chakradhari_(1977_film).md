Plot

The film is based on the life of Gora Kumbhar, a potter who turned into a saint who lived in the 13th and 14th century in Teredoki. Gora (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) is a pot seller, living a happy family life with his Lakshmi (Vanisri) and they have a kid. He spends most of his time under the adoration of Lord Panduranga (Ramakrishna) in which he forgets himself. Once in the prayer, he lost his child while curing the clay by his legs for making pots which angers his wife and she takes an oath on the Lord that he should not touch her. There onwards, Gora makes his work on his own which Lakshmi couldn't tolerate, so, she performs remarriage to him with her sister Manju (Jayaprada). Here Gora vows not to touch her too but unfortunately, he touches them, so, he amputates his hands when Panduranga appears in the form of a potter Ranganna and starts serving him. The rest of the story is how the lord completes his test of Gora.
