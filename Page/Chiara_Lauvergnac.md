Activism

Antifa_2.jpg Freedomofmovement.jpg Lauvergnac is a campaigner for the rights of migrants and asylum seekers. She was associated with Antifaschistische Aktion (ANTIFA), a violent far left wing organisation with branches in several European countries that has been criticised as a left-extremist organisation. In 2006, she protested outside the Haslar detention centre in Hampshire. In 2009, she was part of a group that protested at Tinsley House UK Border immigration centre at Gatwick against the use of charter flights to deport failed asylum seekers and others to Kurdistan in Iraq. She was arrested and convicted of aggravated trespass and given a conditional discharge.[3]

In 2015, she was again involved in protests against the deportation of refugees from the United Kingdom at Gatwick Airport during which she was arrested and subsequently fined.[4] She is a leading figure in the London No Borders anarchist group, part of the No Border network,[5] for which she has reported from the Calais Jungle.[6] Her photographs of the camp featured in the exhibition _Art, Refuge and Resistance_ at the Brighton & Hove Sanctuary on Sea in partnership with the University of Brighton.[7]
