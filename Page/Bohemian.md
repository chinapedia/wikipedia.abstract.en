A BOHEMIAN () is a resident of Bohemia, a region of the Czech Republic or the former Kingdom of Bohemia, a region of the former Crown of Bohemia (lands of the Bohemian Crown). In English, the word "Bohemian" was used to denote the Czech people as well as the Czech language before the word "Czech" became prevalent in the early 20th century.[1]

In a separate meaning, "Bohemian" may also denote "a socially unconventional person, especially one who is involved in the arts" according to Oxford Dictionaries Online. (See Bohemianism).[2]


Etymology

Ottův_slovník_naučný_-_17_České_kroje_-_2.jpg The name "Bohemia" derives from the name of the Boii, a Celtic tribe who inhabited that area towards the latter La Tène period. The toponym _Boiohaemum,_ first attested by Tacitus,[3] is commonly taken to mean "home of the Boii" (from the Germanic root *_haima-_ meaning "world, home").

The word "Bohemian" has never been widely used by the local Czech population. In Czech, the region since the early Middle Ages has been called _Čechy_ but also, especially during the period of restoration/emancipation of the Czech language and nation, as _Čechie._ Another term, stressing the importance of the state/nation, is _Království české_ ("Czech Kingdom") in Czech, or _Böhmen_ (Königreich) in German. Its mainly Czech-speaking inhabitants were called _Čechové_ (in modern Czech _Češi_).

In most other Western European vernaculars and in Latin (as _Bohemi_), the word "Bohemian" or a derivate was used. If the Czech ethnic origin was to be stressed, combinations such as "Bohemian of Bohemian language" (_Čech českého jazyka_), "a real Bohemian" (_pravý Čech_), etc. were used.

It was not until the 19th century that other European languages began to use words related to "Czechs" (as in English, _Tschechien_ in German, _Tchèques_ in French) in a deliberate (and successful) attempt to distinguish between ethnic Slavic-speaking Bohemians and other inhabitants of Bohemia. The latter were mostly ethnic Germans, who identified as "German Bohemians" (_Deutschböhmen_) or simply as "Bohemians" (_Böhmen_). In many parts of Europe, state citizenship was not identical with ethnicity and language, and the various peoples were usually identified by their language. Ethnic boundaries in Bohemia were not always sharp, and people very often were bilingual. Intermarriages across language borders were also common. Native Czech speakers often spoke German and many native German speakers spoke Czech with varying fluency, particularly in areas with many Czech speakers.

Currently, the word "Bohemians" is sometimes used when speaking about persons from Bohemia of all ethnic origins, especially before the year 1918, when the Kingdom of Bohemia ceased to exist. It is also used to distinguish between inhabitants of the western part (Bohemia proper) of the state, and the eastern (Moravia) or north-eastern (Silesia) parts.

The different term "Bohemianism" was associated with "a socially unconventional person, especially one who is involved in the arts", that comes from the French word _bohémien._[4]
