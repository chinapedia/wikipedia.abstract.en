_TO TELL THE TRUTH_ is the second full-length album by Jaymay, the first being 2007's _Autumn Fallin'_.[1]

The thirteen songs on this album are about Jaymay's personal struggles during the preceding few years, including intense pain from Crohn's disease that forced her to cancel her 2013 tour, and the death of her developmentally disabled sister, Cassie, for whom "Cassie's Song" is named. A percentage of the funding for the album that Jaymay raised through PledgeMusic was donated to The Center For Discovery in Monticello, New York, where Cassie went to school.[2]

The album's cover image is of glass tiles arranged in a "TTTT" pattern, which was photographed at the beach at the end of the street on which Jaymay lived as a child.[3]


Critical reception

Popdose called the songs on the album "simply sweet and well-constructed" and that Jaymay "clearly has the goods as a singer and songwriter." [4] Bust Magazine rated the album 3 out of 5, saying that "Jaymay’s evolution as an artist continues, as she excavates her emotional pain for artistic fuel." [5]
