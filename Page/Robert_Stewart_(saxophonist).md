ROBERT DARRIN STEWART (born August 17, 1969) is an American saxophonist. He recorded several albums under his own name during the period 1994–2006. He has also recorded as a sideman, including on trumpeter Wynton Marsalis' _Blood on the Fields_. He went on multiple national and world tours during his 30 year career as a performer, both under his own name and with the Marsalis band.


Early life

Stewart was born in Oakland, California[1] on August 17, 1969. His mother was from Louisiana, and his biological father, Bob Stewart, was a San Francisco Conservatory trained flutist and trumpeter.[2] Stewart says that his mother began teaching him to read from the Qur'an when he was 3 years old; the Bible was his next reading task, and he went on to study other major religions.[3]

Stewart first played the flute as a hobby; his primary passion was basketball during his grade school years.[4] He stated that he "played flute in high school because it was easy to hide from my friends who were all into sports".[5] His high school music teacher encouraged him to play jazz.[6]

The summer after his graduation from Fremont High School, he was listening to the radio and heard tenor saxophonist John Coltrane playing "Russian Lullaby"; the next song was "All Too Soon" played by tenor saxophonist Ben Webster.[7] The contrast in sound between these two men, playing the same instrument, fascinated Stewart; he then remembered his high school teacher's words and focused on jazz.[8] After the summer of 1986, Stewart began to frequent jam sessions with Oakland – Bay Area pianist Ed Kelly.[9] There he met saxophonist Pharoah Sanders, who became his first mentor, giving him technical advice and encouraging him to continue and advance his playing.[10]


Performance career

In New York, Stewart played with trumpeter Roy Hargrove.[11] In 1991, he performed with drummer Max Roach's ensemble.[12] In 1992, Stewart performed with McCoy Tyner (piano), Bobby Hutcherson (vibes), Freddie Hubbard (trumpet), Milt Jackson (vibes), Billy Higgins (drums), and organist Jimmy Smith.[13] Stewart also joined the Los Angeles-based group Black-Note for an eight-month stint, and performed with trombonist Delfeayo Marsalis and drummer Brian Blade that same year.[14] Others he had played with by 1995 include Buddy Montgomery, Chico Freeman, and Donald Byrd.[15] Jazz critic Jason Ankeny said that Stewart was "One of the most impressive hard bop tenor saxophonists to emerge during the 1990s".[16]

In 1993, Stewart was asked to tour with the New York-based group The Harper Brothers led by drummer Winard Harper. This was his first national band tour.[17] By the end of 1994, he began touring nationally under his own name.[18]

Stewart's highest profile engagement that year came after joining trumpeter Wynton Marsalis' big band, the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, to perform _Blood on the Fields_, including on the recording that won the Pulitzer Prize for Music.[19][20][21] He also performed on the album _They Came to Swing_. He was part of the _Blood on the Fields_ tour of the United States and Europe in 1997.[22]

In 1997, Stewart played weekly at San Francisco venues such as Club Deluxe and Bruno's,[23] and had a gig with vocalist Jon Hendricks doing a Bread and Roses benefit inside the former Alcatraz Island Federal Penitentiary.[24] In June 1997, Stewart's quartet included drummer Billy Higgins for a concert at The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.[25] The previous year, Higgins was reported as saying that Stewart was "perhaps the most important young artist to come along in decades."[26]

Stewart performed with guitarist Patrick Greene for President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton at a Democratic fundraiser in Woodside, California in 1998.[27] He backed up Dizzy Gillespie in one of Gillespie's final concerts.[28] In his 30-year performance career he toured the world multiple times.[29]


Recording career

Stewart's first album as leader was _Judgement_,[30] for World Stage Records.[31] The recording featured Higgins, pianist Eric Reed, and bassist Mark Shelby.[32] Jazz writer Scott Yanow wrote: "Even on the up-tempo tunes, Stewart is often content to emphasize his warm tone and to hold long notes, taking his time to get his message across. [...] this is a pleasing modern mainstream effort."[33] In 1994, Stewart recorded _Beautiful Love Ballads_ for Red Records of Italy;[34] it was released in 1998.[35]

Stewart's first album for Quincy Jones's Qwest Records was _In the Gutta_, in 1996.[36] Saxophonist Dave Liebman, on hearing it, reported enthusiastically that Stewart sounded like a player from an older generation.[37] Stewart's next album with Qwest was _The Force_, with drummer Jeff "Tain" Watts, bassist Reginald Veal, and pianist Ed Kelly (his first teacher).[38] According to Stewart, Qwest delayed its release for almost two years and then did not promote it, because of its Islamic influences.[39]

In 2000, Stewart recorded _Nat the Cat_, a tribute to Nat "King" Cole that featured Kelly (piano), Mark Williams (bass), Sly Randolph (drums), and family members Kevin Stewart (piano) and Robert Stewart III (flute).[40][41] Stewart's 2003 album _The Movement_ was a concert recording that was also Higgins's final recording.[42] In 2003, Stewart recorded _Heaven and Earth_ for Nagel-Heyer Records.[43] This was essentially a smooth jazz record, and several of the thirteen songs were Stewart originals.[44] The AllMusic reviewer stated that there is "a positive social message that runs through the songs [...] Perhaps Stewart has found a way to combine new age politics with new age music, creating a hybrid that seems almost natural."[45]


Post-performance career

Stewart retired from recording and performing at the end of 2016 in order to write religious books, teach, and travel.[46]
