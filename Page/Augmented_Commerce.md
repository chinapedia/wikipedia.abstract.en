AUGMENTED COMMERCE, as commonly written as A-COMMERCE or ACOMMERCE, is the buying and selling of goods using augmented reality to visualize products virtually in the real-world environment before purchasing.[1]

Augmented Reality has always been anticipated to change the way people see the world around them, but it will also revolutionize the way we shop online. Innovation in online retail is quickly advancing, and augmented reality is in a position to bring a physical presence to eCommerce. As retailers begin to focus on creating a cohesive experience both online and offline, technology has been vital in engaging buyers through both channels. Augmented reality is allowing retailers to offer a more personal, interactive experience that will change the way we shop forever.

Augmented reality is bringing a realism to these potential scenarios by allowing online shoppers to get a familiarity with products that were only flat images before. Consumers want to feel confident about their purchases and mere photos and furniture dimensions canâ€™t replace the intimacy of trying the products in your real environment in real-time. This new way of shopping helps consumers with their buying decisions while positively impacting sales and product returns for retailers.
