RHYTON is an American experimental psychedelic rock band from Brooklyn, New York.


History

Rhyton was formed as an improvisational outfit by Dave Shuford, Jimy Seitang, and Spencer Herbst; Shuford had been a member of No Neck Blues Band and Seitang had played with Psychic Ills.[1] The group recorded its debut album in a span of only three days, later issuing it as a self-titled effort on the label Thrill Jockey.[2] The band has since released two further full-lengths on Thrill Jockey as well as two limited-edition LPs on other labels.[3][4][5][6][7]
