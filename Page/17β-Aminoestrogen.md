Prolame.svg, a 17β-aminoestrogen.]]

17Β-AMINOESTROGENS are a group of synthetic, steroidal estrogens derived from estradiol which have an amine substitution in place of the hydroxyl group at the C17β position.[1][2] They are estrogenic similarly,[3] but, unlike estradiol, show sustained anticoagulant activity that appears to be mediated by non-genomic mechanisms.[4] As such, it is thought that they may have a reduced risk of venous thromboembolism.[5] The 17β-aminoestrogens include the base or parent estrogen aminoestradiol (AE₂)[6] and the extended-chain derivatives butolame, hexolame, pentolame, prodiame, and prolame.[7][8] They are a homologous series of steroids.[9]
