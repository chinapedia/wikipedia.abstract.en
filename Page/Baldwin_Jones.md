Biography

Jones's mother named him for the writer James Baldwin. He had previously worked in the police department's bias crimes unit, and transferred into the 15th Precinct to replace James Martinez.

Jones had an imposing physique -- he was well over six feet tall, and worked out regularly. When the situation demanded it, he used his size and strength to intimidate suspects. Jones and Greg Medavoy became close friends and solid partners, with Jones often using his calm and direct demeanor to hide his irritation and immediately refocus Medavoy when Medavoy talked too long about some inane subject, or otherwise displayed his neurotic tendencies.

Jones and Assistant District Attorney Valerie Haywood had an on-again, off-again relationship, which included a pregnancy and miscarriage. Jones later took on the parenting role for a troubled teenager named Michael Woodruff, whom he took responsibility for after investigating the murder of Woodruff's mother by his father.
