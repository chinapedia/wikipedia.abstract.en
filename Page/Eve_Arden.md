EVE ARDEN (born EUNICE MARY QUEDENS, April 30, 1908 – November 12, 1990) was an American film, radio, stage, and television actress, and comedienne. She performed in leading and supporting roles for nearly six decades.

Beginning her film career in 1929 and on Broadway in the early 1930s, Arden's first major role was in the RKO Radio Pictures drama _Stage Door_ (1937) opposite Katharine Hepburn, followed by roles in the comedies _Having Wonderful Time_ (1938) and the Marx Brothers' _At the Circus_ (1939). Arden would go on to earn an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role in _Mildred Pierce_ (1945).

In the latter part of her career, she played the sardonic but engaging title character of a high school teacher in _Our Miss Brooks_, winning the first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, and as the school principal in the musicals _Grease_ (1978) and _Grease 2_ (1982).


Early life

Arden was born in Mill Valley, California, on April 30, 1908[1][2][3] to Charles Peter Quedens, son of Charles Henry Augustus and Meta L. (née Dierks) Quedens, and Lucille (née Frank) Quedens, daughter of Bernard and Louisa (née Mertens) Frank, both of German descent. Lucille, a milliner, divorced Charles over his gambling, and went into business for herself.

Although not Roman Catholic, young Eunice was sent to a Dominican convent school in San Rafael, California, and later attended Tamalpais High School, a public high school in Mill Valley until age 16. After leaving school, she joined the stock theater company of Henry "Terry" Duffy.[4]


Career

Film

She made her film debut under her real name in the backstage musical _Song of Love_ (1929), as a wisecracking, homewrecking showgirl who becomes a rival to the film's star, singer Belle Baker. The film was one of Columbia Pictures' earliest successes. In 1933, she relocated to New York City, where she appeared in multiple Broadway stage productions in supporting parts. In 1934, she was cast in that year's _Ziegfeld Follies_ revue. This was the first role in which she was credited as Eve Arden. Told to change her name for the show, she looked at her cosmetics and "stole my first name from Evening in Paris and the second from Elizabeth Arden".[5] Between 1934 and 1941, she would appear in Broadway productions of _Parade_, _Very Warm for May_, _Two for the Show_, and _Let's Face It!_.[6]

Her film career began in earnest in 1937 when she signed a contract with RKO Radio Pictures, and appeared in the films _Oh Doctor_ and _Stage Door_. Her _Stage Door_ portrayal of a fast-talking, witty supporting character gained Arden considerable notice and was to be a template for many of Arden's future roles.[7][8] In 1938, she appeared in a supporting part in the comedy _Having Wonderful Time_, starring Ginger Rogers and Lucille Ball. This was followed by roles in the crime film _The Forgotten Woman_ (1939), and the comedy _At the Circus_ (1939), opposite Groucho Marx, a role that would require her to perform acrobatics.

In 1940, she appeared opposite Clark Gable in _Comrade X_, followed by the drama _Manpower_ (1941), opposite Marlene Dietrich. She also appeared in a supporting part in the Red Skelton comedy _Whistling in the Dark_ (1941), and the romantic comedy _Obliging Young Lady_ (1942).

Her many memorable screen roles include a supporting role as Joan Crawford's wise-cracking friend in _Mildred Pierce_ (1945) for which she received an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress, and James Stewart's wistful secretary in Otto Preminger's murder mystery, _Anatomy of a Murder_ (1959). (One of her co-stars in that film was husband Brooks West.) In 1946, exhibitors voted her the sixth-most promising "star of tomorrow".[9]

She became familiar to a new generation of film-goers when she played Principal McGee in both 1978's _Grease_ and 1982's _Grease 2_. She was known for her deadpan delivery of jokes in films.[10]

Radio and television

and Eve Arden in a scene from _At the Circus_ (1939)]] Arden's ability with witty scripts made her a natural talent for radio; she became a regular on Danny Kaye's short-lived but memorably zany comedy-variety show in 1946, which also featured swing bandleader Harry James and gravel-voiced character actor-comedian Lionel Stander.[11]

Kaye's show lasted one season, but Arden's display of comic talent and timing set the stage for her to be cast in her best-known role, Madison High School English teacher Connie Brooks in _Our Miss Brooks_. Arden portrayed the character on radio from 1948 to 1957, in a television version of the program from 1952 to 1956, and in a 1956 feature film. Arden's character clashed with the school's principal, Osgood Conklin (played by Gale Gordon), and nursed an unrequited crush on fellow teacher Philip Boynton (played originally by future film star Jeff Chandler, and later on radio, then on television, by Robert Rockwell). Except for Chandler, the entire radio cast of Arden, Gordon, Richard Crenna (Walter Denton), Robert Rockwell (Mr. Philip Boynton), Gloria McMillan (Harriet Conklin), and Jane Morgan (landlady Margaret Davis) played the same roles on television.[12]

Arden's portrayal of the character was so popular that she was made an honorary member of the National Education Association, received a 1952 award from the Teachers College of Connecticut's Alumni Association "for humanizing the American teacher", and even received teaching job offers.[13] Her wisecracking, deadpan attitude as the character ultimately became her public persona as a comedienne as well.[14]

, 1940s]] She won a listeners' poll by _Radio Mirror_ magazine as the top-ranking comedienne of 1948–1949, receiving her award at the end of an _Our Miss Brooks_ broadcast that March. "I'm certainly going to try in the coming months to merit the honor you've bestowed upon me, because I understand that if I win this (award) two years in a row, I get to keep Mr. Boynton," she joked. But she was also a hit with the critics; a winter 1949 poll of newspaper and magazine radio editors taken by _Motion Picture Daily_ named her the year's best radio comedienne.[15]

Arden had a very brief guest appearance in a 1955 _I Love Lucy_ episode titled "L.A. at Last" in which she played herself. While awaiting their food at the Brown Derby, Lucy Ricardo (Lucille Ball) and Ethel Mertz (Vivian Vance) argue over whether a certain portrait on a nearby wall is Shelley Winters or Judy Holliday. Lucy urges Ethel to ask a lady occupying the next booth, who turns and replies, "Neither. That's Eve Arden." Ethel suddenly realizes she was just talking to Arden in person, who soon passes Lucy and Ethel's table to leave the restaurant while the pair gawk.[16]

for _Our Miss Brooks_, February 11, 1954]] Desilu Productions, jointly owned by Desi Arnaz and Ball during their marriage, was the production company for the _Our Miss Brooks_ television show, which filmed during the same years as _I Love Lucy_. Ball and Arden became acquainted when they co-starred together in the film _Stage Door_ in 1937. Ball, according to numerous radio historians, suggested Arden for _Our Miss Brooks_ after Shirley Booth auditioned for but failed to land the role and Ball — committed at the time to _My Favorite Husband_ — could not.[17]

Arden tried another series in the fall of 1957, _The Eve Arden Show_, but it was canceled in spring of 1958 after 26 episodes. In 1966, Arden played Nurse Kelton in an episode of _Bewitched_. She later co-starred with Kaye Ballard as her neighbor and in-law, Eve Hubbard, in the 1967–1969 situation comedy _The Mothers-in-Law_, which was produced by Arnaz after the dissolution of Desilu Productions.[18] In her later career, Arden made appearances on such television shows as _Bewitched_, _Alice_, _Maude, Hart to Hart_, and _Falcon Crest_. In 1985, she appeared as the wicked stepmother in the _Faerie Tale Theatre_ production of _Cinderella_.[19]

Stage

Arden was one of many actresses to take on the title roles in _Hello, Dolly!_ and _Auntie Mame_ in the 1960s; in 1967, she won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theatre.[20] Arden was cast in 1983 as the leading lady in what was to be her Broadway comeback in _Moose Murders_, but she wisely withdrew and was replaced with the much younger Holland Taylor after one preview performance, citing "artistic differences". The show went on to open and close on the same night, becoming known as one of the most legendary flops in Broadway history.[21]

Arden published an autobiography, _The Three Phases of Eve_, in 1985. In addition to her Academy Award nomination, Arden has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: Radio and Television (see List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for addresses). She was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1995.[22]


Personal life

Arden was married to Ned Bergen from 1939 to 1947, and to actor Brooks West (1916-1984), from 1952 until his death in 1984 from a heart ailment, aged 67. West and she had four children; all but the youngest were adopted. All four survived their parents.[23]


Death

On November 12, 1990, Arden died from cardiac arrest and arteriosclerotic heart disease, aged 82, at her home, according to her death certificate.[24] She is interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, Westwood, Los Angeles, California.
