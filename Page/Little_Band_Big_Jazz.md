_LITTLE BAND BIG JAZZ_ is an album by trumpeter Conte Candoli's All Stars recorded in 1960 and released on the Crown label.[1][2]


Reception

The AllMusic review by Scott Yanow noted: "While the solos are excellent, trumpeter Conte Candoli's six originals (two co-written with pianist Vince Guaraldi) are not particularly memorable. Their chord structures are comfortable for the musicians but none of the melodies will be remembered".[3]
