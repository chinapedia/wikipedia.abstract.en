LARKSPUR LANDING is an under-construction Sonoma–Marin Area Rail Transit (SMART) station[1] in Larkspur, California. The terminal station is expected to open in late 2019.[2] (Service had previously been estimated in 2018.[3][4]) It is located across Sir Francis Drake Blvd from the Larkspur Ferry Terminal,[5] from which it gets its name.


History

The land for the station was acquired in 1983 by the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District.[6] Initially part of the original plan for system's full buildout,[7] its opening was delayed to a later date as the line's construction was split into phases. Until the line is extended, shuttle bus service connects the Larkspur Terminal with San Rafael Transit Center.[8]
