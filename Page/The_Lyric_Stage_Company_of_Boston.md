THE LYRIC STAGE COMPANY OF BOSTON is the oldest professional theatre company in Boston.[1] Founded in 1974, the Lyric Stage Company is a non-profit organization located at 140 Clarendon Street in the YWCA building. It has been under the leadership of Producing Artistic Director Spiro Veloudos since 1998.[2] The theatre produces about seven plays and musicals each season and is especially well known for its productions of Stephen Sondheim musicals.


Mission

The mission of the Lyric Stage Company of Boston is to produce intimate, challenging and entertaining theatre; reflect the tastes and backgrounds of 21st century Boston; and provide a home for Boston-based theatre artists to establish and expand their careers.[3] It accomplishes this through outreach programs, employment, training, and development opportunities.


History

Building

The Lyric Stage Company of Boston was founded in 1974 by Ron Ritchell and Polly Hogan and began performances in the Community Church on Boylston Street. Two years later, the Lyric Stage moved to a theatre at 56 Charles Street.[4] The stage was less than 300 square feet and sat no more than 103 audience members. The Lyric Stage moved again 140 Clarendon Street where it currently resides. The current theatre is almost triple the original size, includes a band loft, and seats 234.[5]

Theatre

The Lyric Stage's first season consisted of _Antigone_ and _The Second Man_. _The Importance of Being Earnest_ was its first production at 54 Charles Street; the theatre at 140 Clarendon opened with a production of _Red Hot & Cole_.[6] In its 1995–96 season, the Lyric Stage's production of _Whoop-Dee-Doo!_ earned the theatre its first Elliot Norton Award for Outstanding Designer. The theatre's first large-scale musical production occurred in its 2001–02 season with _Sunday in the Park with George_. A 2014 production of _Into the Woods_ is the highest grossing run in Lyric Stage history.[7]


Community Involvement

As part of its mission to support the Boston theatre scene, the Lyric Stage is committed to casting and hiring local playwrights, actors, directors, designers, and musicians. Since its founding, the Lyric Stage has employed over 800 actors and 160 designers.[8]

Fresh Ink Theatre Partnership

The Lyric Stage Company of Boston develops new plays through its partnership with Fresh Ink Theatre.[9] This initiative supports playwrights, actors and directors through the development of new works.

Lyric First Stage

Lyric First stage is a summer program designed for young artists to gain theatrical experience.[10] The program consists of professional mentors who teach a company of teenagers through workshops in music, text, and movement. At the end of each Lyric First Stage program, these young artists perform fully staged productions for a live audience.

Lyric First Curtain

Lyric First Curtain is an educational initiative which gives Boston educators the ability to include drama in their curriculum.[11] This program gives students the opportunity to experience theatre, which they may not otherwise have access to, and delivers theatre education to local communities. Lyric First Curtain is currently in residence at McKinley School (Boston Public Schools) and at the Dudley Public Library.
