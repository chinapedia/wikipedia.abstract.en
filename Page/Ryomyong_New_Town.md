RYOMYONG NEW TOWN () refers to a new town located in Pyongyang, North Korea. The exact location is Ryomyong Avenue which refers from Yongsaengtap to Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Taesong-guyok.[1]


Name

The name "Ryomyong" means "dawn" in Korean language.[2][3] The name is a symbolic reference to former North Korean President Kim Il-sung, who is sometimes called "The Sun of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" (i.e., The Sun of North Korea). [4]


Project

The project was proposed by Kim Jong Un in March 2016[5] and the planned completion was in August of the same year.[6] There were several outdated buildings in Ryomyong Avenue, but due to the plan, all of them were demolished. Construction was started in March 2016.

It consists of 40 of new condominiums, 33 of refurbished condominiums and 34 of public facilities including 6 schools, 3 kindergartens and 3 nurseries.[7] Also, 7 buildings for Kim Il Sung University will be built and 15 of commercial buildings will be constructed.[8] Around the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, only small and idyllic buildings will be built due to the height restrictions. The motto is 'Green city, energy-reduced city'.[9]

The construction was started in March 2016 and topped-out in August of the same year. Total 1.7 billion won were used and the total areas are 151500㎡.[10]

Ryomyong Condominium

This condominium has 82 stories, with a height of 270 m.[11] Construction was started in March 2016 but is temporarily on-hold due to a flood incident in North Hamgyong province,[12] but restarted and it was estimated to complete on 15 April 2017.[13]

The condominium is _de facto_ the highest building of North Korea, since Ryugyong Hotel (_de jure_ the highest building) is only topped-out in 1992 and keep unsure in 2017.

Construction was completed by 13 April 2017 and officially opened just after 2 days.


Criticism

Poor construction

However, it is often criticised as poor construction, especially 270m of condominium was built just in 74 days.[14] This is quite short if compared to another well-known skyscrapers such as Petronas Twin Tower (4~5 years) and Burj Khalifa (5 years). A South Korean expert said, "To build 270m of skyscraper, construction should be done for at least 2 years or more."[15]

Some experts criticise that, due to the poor construction, it could easily collapse. It was shown in 2014 at Pyongchon-guyok.[16]


Relation to other building projects

The new town is one of a number of "monumental" projects 2012-2017 including the Pyongyang Sci-Tech Complex, new Natural History Museum, new People’s Open-air Ice Rink, Changjon Street (창전거리), Unha Scientists Street, Wisong Scientists Street (위성과학자거리), Mirae Street and Ryomyong Street.[17]

[17] Pyongyang Times 8 June 2017 - This is my new home "In retrospect, for the past five years, lots of monumental structures and modern factories have sprung up in Pyongyang, including the Sci-Tech Complex, Natural History Museum and People’s Open-air Ice Rink. And five new streets have been built in the period, namely Changjon, Unha Scientists, Wisong Scientists, Mirae and Ryomyong streets. In other words, every year has witnessed a street coming into being."
