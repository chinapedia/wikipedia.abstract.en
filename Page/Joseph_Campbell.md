JOSEPH JOHN CAMPBELL (March 26, 1904 – October 30, 1987) was an American Professor of Literature at Sarah Lawrence College who worked in comparative mythology and comparative religion. His work covers many aspects of the human experience. Campbell's most well-known work is his book _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_ (1949), in which he discusses his theory of the journey of the archetypal hero shared by world mythologies, termed the monomyth.

Since the publication of _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_, Campbell's theory has been applied by a wide variety of modern writers and artists. His philosophy has been summarized by his own often repeated phrase: "Follow your bliss."[1] He gained recognition in Hollywood when George Lucas credited Campbell's work as influencing his _Star Wars_ saga.[2]


Life

Background

Joseph Campbell was born in White Plains, New York,[3] on March 26, 1904, the son of Josephine (née Lynch) and Charles William Campbell.[4] He was from an upper-middle-class Irish Catholic family. During his childhood, he moved with his family to nearby New Rochelle, New York. In 1919, a fire destroyed the family home in New Rochelle, killing his grandmother.[5]

In 1921, Campbell graduated from the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut. While at Dartmouth College he studied biology and mathematics, but decided that he preferred the humanities. He transferred to Columbia University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature in 1925 and a Master of Arts degree in medieval literature in 1927. At Dartmouth he had joined Delta Tau Delta. An accomplished athlete, he received awards in track and field events, and, for a time, was among the fastest half-mile runners in the world.

In 1924, Campbell traveled to Europe with his family. On the ship during his return trip he encountered the messiah elect of the Theosophical Society, Jiddu Krishnamurti; they discussed Indian philosophy, sparking in Campbell an interest in Hindu and Indian thought.[6] In 1927, he received a fellowship from Columbia University to study in Europe. Campbell studied Old French, Provençal, and Sanskrit at the University of Paris and the University of Munich. He learned to read and speak French and German.

On his return to Columbia University in 1929, Campbell expressed a desire to pursue the study of Sanskrit and modern art in addition to Medieval literature. Lacking faculty approval, Campbell withdrew from graduate studies. Later in life he jested that it is a sign of incompetence to have a PhD in the liberal arts, the discipline covering his work.

The Great Depression

With the arrival of the Great Depression, Campbell spent the next five years (1929–1934) living in a rented shack in Woodstock, New York.[7] There, he contemplated the next course of his life[8] while engaged in intensive and rigorous independent study. He later said that he "would divide the day into four four-hour periods, of which I would be reading in three of the four-hour periods, and free one of them ... I would get nine hours of sheer reading done a day. And this went on for five years straight."

Campbell traveled to California for a year (1931–1932), continuing his independent studies and becoming close friends with the budding writer John Steinbeck and his wife Carol. Campbell was introduced to the Steinbecks by author and early nutritionist Adelle Davis whom he met and developed a close relationship with on a cruise to the Caribbean with his father in December 1929.[9] On the Monterey Peninsula, Campbell, like John Steinbeck, fell under the spell of the marine biologist Ed Ricketts (the model for "Doc" in Steinbeck's novel _Cannery Row_ as well as central characters in several other novels).[10] Campbell lived for a while next door to Ricketts, participated in professional and social activities at his neighbor's, and accompanied him, along with Xenia and Sasha Kashevaroff, on a 1932 journey to Juneau, Alaska on the _Grampus_.[11] Campbell began writing a novel centered on Ricketts as a hero but, unlike Steinbeck, did not complete his book.[12]

Bruce Robison writes that

Campbell continued his independent reading while teaching for a year in 1933 at the Canterbury School, during which time he also attempted to publish works of fiction. While teaching at the Canterbury School, Campbell sold his first short story _Strictly Platonic_ to _Liberty_ magazine.[13]

Sarah Lawrence College

]] In 1934, Campbell accepted a position as Professor of Literature at Sarah Lawrence College. In 1938, he married one of his former students, the dancer-choreographer Jean Erdman. For most of their 49 years of marriage they shared a two-room apartment in Greenwich Village in New York City. In the 1980s they also purchased an apartment in Honolulu and divided their time between the two cities. They did not have any children.

Early in World War II, Campbell attended a lecture by the Indologist Heinrich Zimmer; the two men became good friends. After Zimmer's death, Campbell was given the task of editing and posthumously publishing Zimmer's papers, which he would do over the following decade.

In 1955–1956, as the last volume of Zimmer's posthumous (_The Art of Indian Asia, Its Mythology and Transformations_) was finally about to be published, Campbell took a sabbatical from Sarah Lawrence College and traveled, for the first time, to Asia. He spent six months in southern Asia (mostly India) and another six in East Asia (mostly Japan). This year had a profound influence on his thinking about Asian religion and myth, and also on the necessity for teaching comparative mythology to a larger, non-academic audience.[14]

In 1972, Campbell retired from Sarah Lawrence College, after having taught there for 38 years.

Later life and death

Campbell attended a Grateful Dead concert in 1986, and marveled that "Everyone has just lost themselves in everybody else here!" With the Dead, Campbell put on a conference called "Ritual and Rapture from Dionysus to the Grateful Dead".[15]

Campbell died at his home in Honolulu, Hawaii, on October 30, 1987, from complications of esophageal cancer.[16][17] Before his death he had completed filming the series of interviews with Bill Moyers that aired the following spring as _The Power of Myth_. He is buried in O'ahu Cemetery, Honolulu.


Influences

Art, literature, philosophy

Campbell often referred to the work of modern writers James Joyce and Thomas Mann in his lectures and writings, as well as to the art of Pablo Picasso. He was introduced to their work during his stay as a graduate student in Paris. Campbell eventually corresponded with Mann.[18]

The works of Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche had a profound effect on Campbell's thinking; he quoted their writing frequently.

The "follow your bliss" philosophy attributed to Campbell following the original broadcast of _The Power of Myth_ (see below) derives from the Hindu Upanishads; however, Campbell was possibly also influenced by the 1922 Sinclair Lewis novel _Babbitt_. In _The Power of Myth,_ Campbell quotes from the novel:

Psychology and anthropology

The anthropologist Leo Frobenius and his disciple Adolf Ellegard Jensen were important to Campbell's view of cultural history. Campbell was also influenced by the psychological work of Abraham Maslow and Stanislav Grof.

Campbell's ideas regarding myth and its relation to the human psyche are dependent in part on the pioneering work of Sigmund Freud, but in particular on the work of Jung, whose studies of human psychology greatly influenced Campbell. Campbell's conception of myth is closely related to the Jungian method of dream interpretation, which is heavily reliant on symbolic interpretation. Jung's insights into archetypes were heavily influenced by the _Bardo Thodol_ (also known as _The Tibetan Book of the Dead_). In his book _The Mythic Image_, Campbell quotes Jung's statement about the _Bardo Thodol_, that it


Comparative mythology and Campbell's theories

Monomyth

Campbell's concept of _monomyth_ (one myth) refers to the theory that sees all mythic narratives as variations of a single great story. The theory is based on the observation that a common pattern exists beneath the narrative elements of most great myths, regardless of their origin or time of creation. Campbell often referred to the ideas of Adolf Bastian and his distinction between what he called "folk" and "elementary" ideas, the latter referring to the prime matter of monomyth while the former to the multitude of local forms the myth takes in order to remain an up-to-date carrier of sacred meanings. The central pattern most studied by Campbell is often referred to as _the hero's journey_ and was first described in _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_ (1949).[19] An enthusiast of novelist James Joyce,[20] Campbell borrowed the term _monomyth_ from Joyce's _Finnegans Wake_. Campbell also made heavy use of Carl Jung's theories on the structure of the human psyche, and he often used terms such as _anima_/_animus_ and _ego consciousness_.

As a strong believer in the psychic unity of mankind and its poetic expression through mythology, Campbell made use of the concept to express the idea that the whole of the human race can be seen as engaged in the effort of making the world _"transparent to transcendence"_ by showing that underneath the world of phenomena lies an eternal source which is constantly pouring its energies into this world of time, suffering, and ultimately death. To achieve this task one needs to speak about things that existed before and beyond words, a seemingly impossible task, the solution to which lies in the metaphors found in myths. These metaphors are statements that point beyond themselves into the transcendent. The Hero's Journey was the story of the man or woman who, through great suffering, reached an experience of the eternal source and returned with gifts powerful enough to set their society free.

As this story spread through space and evolved through time, it was broken down into various local forms (masks), depending on the social structures and environmental pressures that existed for the culture that interpreted it. The basic structure, however, has remained relatively unchanged and can be classified using the various stages of a hero's adventure through the story, stages such as _the Call to Adventure, Receiving Supernatural Aid, Meeting with the Goddess/Atonement with the Father_ and _Return_. These stages, as well as the symbols one encounters throughout the story, provide the necessary metaphors to express the spiritual truths the story is trying to convey. Metaphor for Campbell, in contrast with _comparisons_ which make use of the word _like_, pretend to a literal interpretation of what they are referring to, as in the sentence "Jesus is the Son of God" rather than "the relationship of man to God is _like_ that of a son to a father".[21]

In the 2000 documentary _Joseph Campbell: A Hero's Journey_, he explains God in terms of a metaphor:

  God is a metaphor for a mystery that absolutely transcends all human categories of thought, even the categories of being and non-being. Those are categories of thought. I mean it's as simple as that. So it depends on how much you want to think about it. Whether it's doing you any good. Whether it is putting you in touch with the mystery that's the ground of your own being. If it isn't, well, it's a lie. So half the people in the world are religious people who think that their metaphors are facts. Those are what we call theists. The other half are people who know that the metaphors are not facts. And so, they're lies. Those are the atheists.[22]

Some scholars have disagreed with the concept of the "monomyth" because of its oversimplification of different cultures. According to Robert Ellwood, "A tendency to think in generic terms of people, races ... is undoubtedly the profoundest flaw in mythological thinking."

Functions of myth

Campbell often described mythology as having a fourfold function within human society. These appear at the end of his work _The Masks of God: Creative Mythology_, as well as various lectures.[23]

The Metaphysical Function: _Awakening a sense of awe before the mystery of being_
    According to Campbell, the absolute mystery of life, what he called transcendent reality, cannot be captured directly in words or images. Symbols and mythic metaphors on the other hand point outside themselves and into that reality. They are what Campbell called "being statements"[24] and their enactment through ritual can give to the participant a sense of that ultimate mystery as an experience. "Mythological symbols touch and exhilarate centers of life beyond the reach of reason and coercion.... The first function of mythology is to reconcile waking consciousness to the _mysterium tremendum et fascinans_ of this universe _as it is_."[25]

The Cosmological Function: _Explaining the shape of the universe_
    For pre-modern societies, myth also functioned as a _proto-science_, offering explanations for the physical phenomena that surrounded and affected their lives, such as the change of seasons and the life cycles of animals and plants.

The Sociological Function: _Validate and support the existing social order_
    Ancient societies had to conform to an existing social order if they were to survive at all. This is because they evolved under "pressure" from necessities much more intense than the ones encountered in our modern world. Mythology confirmed that order and enforced it by reflecting it into the stories themselves, often describing how the order arrived from divine intervention. Campbell often referred to these "conformity" myths as the _"Right Hand Path"_ to reflect the brain's left hemisphere's abilities for logic, order and linearity. Together with these myths however, he observed the existence of the _"Left Hand Path"_, mythic patterns like the _"Hero's Journey"_ which are revolutionary in character in that they demand from the individual a surpassing of social norms and sometimes even of morality.[26]

The Pedagogical Function: _Guide the individual through the stages of life_
    As a person goes through life, many psychological challenges will be encountered. Myth may serve as a guide for successful passage through the stages of one's life.

Evolution of myth

Campbell's view of mythology was by no means static and his books describe in detail how mythologies evolved through time, reflecting the realities in which each society had to adjust. Various stages of cultural development have different yet identifiable mythological systems. In brief these are:

The Way of the Animal Powers: _Hunting and gathering societies_
    At this stage of evolution religion was animistic, as all of nature was seen as being infused with a spirit or divine presence. At center stage was the main hunting animal of that culture, whether the buffalo for Native Americans or the eland for South African tribes, and a large part of religion focused on dealing with the psychological tension that came from the reality of the necessity to kill versus the divinity of the animal. This was done by presenting the animals as springing from an eternal archetypal source and coming to this world as _willing victims_, with the understanding that their lives would be returned to the soil or to the Mother through a ritual of restoration.[27] The act of slaughter then becomes a ritual where both parties, animal and mankind, are equal participants. In _Mythos_ and _The Power of Myth_,[28] Campbell recounts the story he calls "The Buffalo's Wife" as told by the Blackfoot tribe of North America. The story tells of a time when the buffalos stopped coming to the hunting plains, leaving the tribe to starve. The chief's daughter promises to marry the buffalo chief in return for their reappearance, but is eventually spared and taught the buffalo dance by the animals themselves, through which the spirits of their dead will return to their eternal life source. Indeed, Campbell taught that throughout history mankind has held a belief that all life comes from and returns to another dimension which transcends temporality, but which can be reached through ritual.

The Way of the Seeded Earth: _Early agrarian societies_
    Beginning in the fertile grasslands of the Levant and the Fertile Crescent of Mesopotamia in the Bronze Age and moving to Europe, the practice of agriculture spread along with a new way of understanding mankind's relationship to the world. At this time the earth was seen as the Mother, and the myths focused around Her life-giving powers. The plant and cultivation cycle was mirrored in religious rituals which often included human sacrifice, symbolic or literal.[29] The main figures of this system were a female Great Goddess, Mother Earth, and her ever-dying and ever-resurrected son/consort, a male God. At this time the focus was to participate in the repetitive rhythm the world moved in expressed as the four seasons, the birth and death of crops and the phases of the moon. At the center of this motion was the Mother Goddess from whom all life springs and to whom all life returns. This often gave Her a dual aspect as both mother and destroyer.

The Way of the Celestial Lights: _The first high civilizations_
    As the first agricultural societies evolved into the high civilisations of Mesopotamia and Babylonia, the observation of the stars inspired them with the idea that life on earth must also follow a similar mathematically predetermined pattern in which individual beings are but mere participants in an eternal cosmic play. The king was symbolised by the Sun with the golden crown as its main metaphor, while his court were the orbiting planets. The Mother Goddess remained, but her powers were now fixed within the rigid framework of a clockwork universe.
    However, two barbarian incursions changed that. As the Indo-European (Aryan) people descended from the north and the Semites swept up from the Arabian desert, they carried with them a male dominated mythology with a warrior god whose symbol was the thunder. As they conquered, mainly due to the superior technology of iron smithing, their mythology blended with and subjugated the previous system of the Earth Goddess. Many mythologies of the ancient world, such as those of Greece, India, and Persia, are a result of that fusion with gods retaining some of their original traits and character but now belonging to a single system. Figures such as Zeus and Indra are thunder gods who now interact with Demeter and Dionysus, whose ritual sacrifice and rebirth, bearing testament to his pre-Indo-European roots, were still enacted in classical Greece. But for the most part, the focus heavily shifted toward the masculine, with Zeus ascending the throne of the gods and Dionysus demoted to a mere demi-god.
    This demotion was very profound in the case of the biblical imagery where the female elements were marginalized to an extreme. Campbell believed that Eve and the snake that tempted her were once fertility gods worshipped in their own right, with the tree of knowledge being the Tree of Life.[30] He also found significance in the biblical story of Cain and Abel, with Cain being a farmer whose agrarian offering is not accepted by God, while herder Abel's animal sacrifice is. In the lecture series of Mythos, Campbell speaks of the Mysteries of Eleusis in Ancient Greece, where Demeter's journey in the underworld was enacted for young men and women of the time. There he observed that wheat was presented as the ultimate mystery with wine being a symbol of Dionysus, much like in the Christian mysteries where bread and wine are considered to incarnate the body and blood of Jesus. Both religions carry the same "seeded earth" cosmology in different forms while retaining an image of the ever-dying, ever-resurrected God.

The Way of Man: _Medieval mythology, romantic love, and the birth of the modern spirit_
    Campbell recognized that the poetic form of courtly love, carried through medieval Europe by the traveling troubadours, contained a complete mythology in its own right.[31] In'' The Power of Myth'' as well as the "Occidental Mythology" volume of _The Masks of God_, Campbell describes the emergence of a new kind of erotic experience as a "person to person" affair, in contrast with the purely physical definition given to Eros in the ancient world and the communal agape found in the Christian religion. An archetypal story of this kind is the legend of Tristan and Isolde which, apart from its mystical function, shows the transition from an arranged-marriage society as practiced in the Middle Ages and sanctified by the church, into the form of marriage by "falling in love" with another person that we recognize today. So what essentially started from a mythological theme has since become a social reality, mainly due to a change in perception brought about by a new mythology—and represents a central foundational manifestation of Campbell's overriding interpretive message, "Follow your bliss."
    Campbell believed that in the modern world the function served by formal, traditional mythological systems has been taken on by individual creators such as artists and philosophers. In the works of some of his favorites, such as Thomas Mann, Pablo Picasso and James Joyce, he saw mythological themes that could serve the same life-giving purpose that mythology had once played. Accordingly, Campbell believed the religions of the world to be the various culturally influenced "masks" of the same fundamental, transcendent truths. All religions can bring one to an elevated awareness above and beyond a dualistic conception of reality, or idea of "pairs of opposites" such as being and non-being, or right and wrong. Indeed, he quotes from the Rigveda in the preface to _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_: "Truth is one, the sages speak of it by many names."


Influence

Joseph Campbell Foundation

In 1991, Campbell's widow, choreographer Jean Erdman, worked with Campbell's longtime friend and editor, Robert Walter, to create the Joseph Campbell Foundation.

Initiatives undertaken by the JCF include: _The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell_, a series of books and recordings that aims to pull together Campbell's myriad-minded work; the Erdman Campbell Award; the Mythological RoundTables, a network of local groups around the globe that explore the subjects of comparative mythology, psychology, religion and culture; and the collection of Campbell's library and papers housed at the OPUS Archives and Research Center.[32]

Film and television

George Lucas was the first Hollywood filmmaker to credit Campbell's influence. Lucas stated, following the release of the first _Star Wars_ film in 1977, that its story was shaped, in part, by ideas described in _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_ and other works of Campbell's. The linkage between _Star Wars_ and Campbell was further reinforced when later reprints of Campbell's book used the image of Luke Skywalker on the cover.[33] Lucas discusses this influence at great length in the authorized biography of Joseph Campbell, _A Fire in the Mind_:

  I came to the conclusion after _American Graffiti_ that what's valuable for me is to set standards, not to show people the world the way it is...around the period of this realization...it came to me that there really was no modern use of mythology...The Western was possibly the last generically American fairy tale, telling us about our values. And once the Western disappeared, nothing has ever taken its place. In literature we were going off into science fiction...so that's when I started doing more strenuous research on fairy tales, folklore, and mythology, and I started reading Joe's books. Before that I hadn't read any of Joe's books...It was very eerie because in reading _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_ I began to realize that my first draft of _Star Wars_ was following classic motifs... So I modified my next draft [of _Star Wars_] according to what I'd been learning about classical motifs and made it a little bit more consistent...I went on to read 'The Masks of God' and many other books.[34]

It was not until after the completion of the original _Star Wars_ trilogy in 1983, however, that Lucas met Campbell or heard any of his lectures.[35] In 1984, Campbell gave a lecture at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, with Lucas in the audience, who was introduced through their mutual friend Barbara McClintock. A few years later, Lucas invited Campbell to watch the entire _Star Wars_ trilogy at Skywalker Ranch, which Campbell called "real art".[36] This meeting led to the filming of the 1988 documentary _The Power of Myth_ at Skywalker Ranch. In his interviews with Bill Moyers, Campbell discusses the way in which Lucas used _The Hero's Journey_ in the _Star Wars_ films (IV, V, and VI) to re-invent the mythology for the contemporary viewer. Moyers and Lucas filmed an interview 12 years later in 1999 called the _Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas & Bill Moyers_ to further discuss the impact of Campbell's work on Lucas' films.[37] In addition, the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution sponsored an exhibit during the late 1990s called _Star Wars: The Magic of Myth_, which discussed the ways in which Campbell's work shaped the _Star Wars_ films.

Many filmmakers of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have acknowledged the influence of Campbell's work on their own craft. Christopher Vogler, a Hollywood screenwriter, created a seven-page company memo based on Campbell's work, _A Practical Guide to The Hero With a Thousand Faces_,[38] which led to the development of Disney's 1994 film _The Lion King_. Among films that many viewers have recognized as closely following the pattern of the monomyth are _The Matrix_ series, the Batman series and the _Indiana Jones_ series.[39] Dan Harmon, the creator of the TV show _Community_, often references Campbell as a major influence. According to him, he uses a "story circle" to formulate every story he writes, in a formulation of Campbell's work.[40]

Popular literature

After the explosion of popularity brought on by the _Star Wars_ films and _The Power of Myth_, creative artists in many media recognized the potential to use Campbell's theories to try to unlock human responses to narrative patterns. Novelists, songwriters,[41][42] video game designers[43] have studied Campbell's work in order to better understand mythology – in particular, the monomyth – and its impact.

The novelist Richard Adams acknowledges a debt to Campbell's work and specifically to the concept of the monomyth.[44] In his best known work, _Watership Down_, Adams uses extracts from _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_ as chapter epigrams.

Dan Brown mentioned in a _New York Times_ interview that Joseph Campbell's works, particularly _The Power of Myth_ and _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_, inspired him to create the character of Robert Langdon.[45]

"Follow your bliss"

One of Campbell's most identifiable, most quoted and arguably most misunderstood sayings was his admonition to "follow your bliss". He derived this idea from the Upanishads:

  Now, I came to this idea of bliss because in Sanskrit, which is the great spiritual language of the world, there are three terms that represent the brink, the jumping-off place to the ocean of transcendence: Sat-Chit-Ananda. The word "Sat" means being. "Chit" means consciousness. "Ananda" means bliss or rapture. I thought, "I don't know whether my consciousness is proper consciousness or not; I don't know whether what I know of my being is my proper being or not; but I do know where my rapture is. So let me hang on to rapture, and that will bring me both my consciousness and my being." I think it worked.[46]

He saw this not merely as a mantra, but as a helpful guide to the individual along the hero journey that each of us walks through life:

  If you follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living. Wherever you are—if you are following your bliss, you are enjoying that refreshment, that life within you, all the time.[47]

Campbell began sharing this idea with students during his lectures in the 1970s. By the time that _The Power of Myth_ was aired in 1988, six months following Campbell's death, "Follow your bliss" was a philosophy that resonated deeply with the American public—both religious and secular.[48]

During his later years, when some students took him to be encouraging hedonism, Campbell is reported to have grumbled, "I should have said, 'Follow your _blisters_.'"[49]

Criticism

Campbell's scholarship and understanding of Sanskrit has been questioned. Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, a former Sanskrit professor at the University of Toronto, said that he once met Campbell, and that the two "hated each other at sight", commenting that, "When I met Campbell at a public gathering, he was quoting Sanskrit verses. He had no clue as to what he was talking about; he had the most superficial knowledge of India but he could use it for his own aggrandizement. I remember thinking: this man is corrupt. I know that he was simply _lying_ about his understanding".[50] According to Richard Buchen, librarian of the Joseph Campbell Collection at the Pacifica Graduate Institute, Campbell could not translate Sanskrit well. However, Buchen adds that Campbell worked closely with three scholars who did translate Sanskrit well.

Ellwood observes that _The Masks of God_ series "impressed literate laity more than specialists"; he quotes Stephen P. Dunn as remarking that in _Occidental Mythology_ Campbell "writes in a curiously archaic style – full of rhetorical questions, exclamations of wonder and delight, and expostulations directed at the reader, or perhaps at the author's other self – which is charming about a third of the time and rather annoying the rest." Ellwood notes that "Campbell was not really a social scientist, and those in the latter camp could tell" and records a concern about Campbell's "oversimpification of historical matters and tendency to make myth mean whatever he wanted it to mean". The critic Camille Paglia, writing in _Sexual Personae_ (1990), expressed disagreement with Campbell's "negative critique of fifth-century Athens" in _Occidental Mythology_, arguing that Campbell missed the "visionary and exalted" androgyny in Greek statues of nude boys. Paglia has written that while Campbell is "a seminal figure for many American feminists", she loathes him for his "mawkishness and bad research." Paglia has called Campbell "mushy" and a "false teacher", and described his work as a "fanciful, showy mishmash".[51]

Campbell has also been accused of antisemitism by some authors. Brendan Gill, in an article published in _The New York Review of Books_ in 1989, accused Campbell of both antisemitism and prejudice against blacks.[52] Gill's article resulted in a series of letters to the editor, some supporting the charge of antisemitism or accusing Campbell of having various other right-wing biases, others defending him. However, Robert Ellwood wrote that Gill relied on "scraps of evidence, largely anecdotal" to support his charges against Campbell. Masson accused Campbell of "hidden anti-Semitism" and "fascination with conservative, semifascistic views". Contrarily, the "fascist undercurrents" in Campbell's work and especially its influence on _Star Wars_ have been called "a reminder of how easily totalitarianism can knock at any society's door."[53]

The religious studies scholar Russell T. McCutcheon characterized the "following [of] the bliss of self-realization" in Campbell's work as "spiritual and psychological legitimation" for Reaganomics.


Works by Campbell

Early collaborations

The first published work that bore Campbell's name was _Where the Two Came to Their Father_ (1943), an account of a Navajo ceremony that was performed by singer (medicine man) Jeff King and recorded by artist and ethnologist Maud Oakes, recounting the story of two young heroes who go to the hogan of their father, the Sun, and return with the power to destroy the monsters that are plaguing their people. Campbell provided a commentary. He would use this tale through the rest of his career to illustrate both the universal symbols and structures of human myths and the particulars ("folk ideas") of Native American stories.

As noted above, James Joyce was an important influence on Campbell. Campbell's first important book (with Henry Morton Robinson), _A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake_ (1944), is a critical analysis of Joyce's final text _Finnegans Wake_. In addition, Campbell's seminal work, _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_ (1949), discusses what Campbell called the _monomyth_ – the cycle of the journey of the hero – a term that he borrowed directly from Joyce's _Finnegans Wake_.

_The Hero with a Thousand Faces_

From his days in college through the 1940s, Joseph Campbell turned his hand to writing fiction.[54] In many of his later stories (published in the posthumous collection _Mythic Imagination_) he began to explore the mythological themes that he was discussing in his Sarah Lawrence classes. These ideas turned him eventually from fiction to non-fiction.

Originally titled _How to Read a Myth_, and based on the introductory class on mythology that he had been teaching at Sarah Lawrence College, _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_ was published in 1949 as Campbell's first foray as a solo author; it established his name outside of scholarly circles and remains, arguably, his most influential work to this day. The book argues that hero stories such as Krishna, Buddha, Apollonius of Tyana, and Jesus all share a similar mythological basis. Not only did it introduce the concept of the hero's journey to popular thinking, but it also began to popularize the very idea of comparative mythology itself—the study of the human impulse to create stories and images that, though they are clothed in the motifs of a particular time and place, draw nonetheless on universal, eternal themes. Campbell asserted:

  Wherever the poetry of myth is interpreted as biography, history, or science, it is killed. The living images become only remote facts of a distant time or sky. Furthermore, it is never difficult to demonstrate that as science and history, mythology is absurd. When a civilization begins to reinterpret its mythology in this way, the life goes out of it, temples become museums, and the link between the two perspectives becomes dissolved.

_The Masks of God_

Published between 1959 and 1968, Campbell's four-volume work _The Masks of God_ covers mythology from around the world, from ancient to modern. Where _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_ focused on the commonality of mythology (the "elementary ideas"), the '' Masks of God'' books focus upon historical and cultural variations the monomyth takes on (the "folk ideas"). In other words, where _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_ draws perhaps more from psychology, the '' Masks of God'' books draw more from anthropology and history. The four volumes of _Masks of God_ are as follows: _Primitive Mythology_, _Oriental Mythology_, _Occidental Mythology_, and _Creative Mythology_.

The book is quoted by proponents of the Christ myth theory. Campbell writes, "It is clear that, whether accurate or not as to biographical detail, the moving legend of the Crucified and Risen Christ was fit to bring a new warmth, immediacy, and humanity, to the old motifs of the beloved Tammuz, Adonis, and Osiris cycles."[55]

_Historical Atlas of World Mythology_

At the time of his death, Campbell was in the midst of working upon a large-format, lavishly illustrated series entitled _Historical Atlas of World Mythology_. This series was to build on Campbell's idea, first presented in _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_, that myth evolves over time through four stages:

-   _The Way of the Animal Powers_—the myths of Paleolithic hunter-gatherers which focus on shamanism and animal totems.
-   _The Way of the Seeded Earth_—the myths of Neolithic, agrarian cultures which focus upon a mother goddess and associated fertility rites.
-   _The Way of the Celestial Lights_—the myths of Bronze Age city-states with pantheons of gods ruling from the heavens, led by a masculine god-king.
-   _The Way of Man_—religion and philosophy as it developed after the Axial Age (c. 6th century BC), in which the mythic imagery of previous eras was made consciously metaphorical, reinterpreted as referring to psycho-spiritual, not literal-historical, matters. This transition is evident in the East in Buddhism, Vedanta, and philosophical Taoism; and in the West in the Mystery cults, Platonism, Christianity and Gnosticism.

Only the first volume was completed at the time of Campbell's death. Campbell's editor Robert Walter completed the publication of the first three of five parts of the second volume after Campbell's death. The works are now out of print. , Joseph Campbell Foundation is currently undertaking to create a new, ebook edition.[56]

_The Power of Myth_

Campbell's widest popular recognition followed his collaboration with Bill Moyers on the PBS series _The Power of Myth_, which was first broadcast in 1988, the year following Campbell's death. The series discusses mythological, religious, and psychological archetypes. A book, _The Power of Myth_, containing expanded transcripts of their conversations, was released shortly after the original broadcast.

_Collected Works_

The _Collected Works of Joseph Campbell_ series is a project initiated by the Joseph Campbell Foundation to release new, authoritative editions of Campbell's published and unpublished writing, as well as audio and video recordings of his lectures.[57] Working with New World Library and Acorn Media UK, as well as publishing audio recordings and ebooks under its own banner, the project has produced over seventy-five titles. The series's executive editor is Robert Walter, and the managing editor is David Kudler.

There was no running water, only here and there a well and a pump. ... That is where I did most of my basic reading and work."
