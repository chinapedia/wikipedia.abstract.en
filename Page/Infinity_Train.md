_INFINITY TRAIN_ is an American animated miniseries created by former _Regular Show_ writer/storyboard artist Owen Dennis for Cartoon Network.[1] The series follows 12-year-old Tulip and her two-in-one robot companion One-One in their journey through a seemingly infinite train with limitless possibilities traveling through a completely barren wasteland. They are joined by Atticus, an intelligent, talking Corgi and king of a Corgi kingdom in one of the train's cars, as they search for a way to Tulip's home.

The pilot was first released on the Cartoon Network App and VOD on November 1, 2016, and released the following day on the official Cartoon Network YouTube channel. The short garnered a million views within its first month of availability and has since gained 4.7 million views as of July 2019, making it the most viewed pilot on the channel while two other originals, _Welcome to My Life_ is the second most viewed pilot, and _Twelve Forever_ (later moved to Netflix) being the third most viewed pilot.[2] A petition to greenlight _Infinity Train_ made shortly after the pilot was released garnered over 57,000 signatures before the greenlight announcement.[3]

On March 11, 2018, Cartoon Network's official website launched a teaser site that confirmed the show had been greenlit as a full series.[4]

In July 2018, a sneak peek of the first season was revealed on the Cartoon Network panel at the 2018 San Diego Comic-Con. It was released a couple of hours later on Cartoon Network's social media platforms.

A full trailer for _Infinity Train_ was released in June 2019 which was unlocked by playing the show theme on the _Infinity Train_ website. It was later uploaded to Cartoon Network's YouTube channel.

On July 11, 2019, the show was confirmed to premiere on August 5, 2019.[5]

On July 20, 2019, the first episode was shown during the _Infinity Train_ panel at San Diego Comic-Con. It was then released on the Cartoon Network app and website later that same day.[6]

The miniseries will be 10 episodes long, with 2 episodes airing each night from August 5 to August 9, 2019.[7]


Characters

-   TULIP OLSEN (voiced by Ashley Johnson) is a 12-year-old girl and aspiring computer game designer who has been trapped on the train for about a week when the story begins _in medias res_ without directly explaining how she came to be there, and has a glowing number on her right palm. She is trying to make her way through the train in hopes of finding a way off and getting home. She is accompanied by a robot companion she met on the train, One-One.
-   ONE-ONE is Tulip's robot companion, who is the size and shape of a basketball. One-One consists of two separate hemisphere-shaped robots (with contrasting personalities) that can combine to roll around.
    -   GLAD-ONE (voiced by Jeremy Crutchley) is the utterly exuberant and optimistic part of One-One.
    -   SAD-ONE (voiced by Owen Dennis) is the utterly morose and pessimistic part of One-One.
-   ATTICUS (voiced by Ernie Hudson) is an intelligent, talking Corgi, king of the kingdom of Corginia in a single car of the train.
-   STEWARD (also voiced by Johnson) is a menacing robot with an unknown purpose on the train. It apparently consists of multiple tentacle-like cables converging on a white humanoid mask. The eyes of the mask emit blue flames and can extend machine gun barrels. Steward's only dialog to date is, _"Return to your seat."_
-   MIKAYLA (voiced by Reagan Gomez-Preston) is Tulip's best friend.
-   MEGAN OLSEN (voiced by Audrey Wasilewski) is Tulip's mother.
