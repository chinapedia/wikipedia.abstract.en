RENEW EUROPE[1][2] is a political group in the EUROPEAN COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS [3][4] bringing together liberal and democrat city mayors, regional presidents and ministers, and local and regional councillors to contribute to the European Union's legislative procedure.[5][6] The group is the successor to the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Committee of the Regions (ALDE-CoR) which existed from 2005-2019[7][8], which in turn succeeded the ELDR-CoR group which had existed since 1998. The group consists of members from several European political parties, including Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the European Democratic Party.[9]


History

In 1998 political groups were established in the European Committee of the Regions, and as a result the liberal and democrat members formed the group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (European Parliament group). In 2005 the group was renamed to the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party (ALDE) reflecting a similar change in the group in the European Parliament and incorporating new members along with the change.[10] In 2019 the group was renamed to Renew Europe following the change in the group in the European Parliament.[11][12]

In 2016, Bart Somers, Mayor of Mechelen and leader of the liberal group in the Flemish Parliament, was elected as new Renew Europe (former ALDE-CoR) President by the group. He will serve as President until the end of this mandate (2020).[13][14]
