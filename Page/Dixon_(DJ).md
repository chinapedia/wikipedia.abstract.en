DIXON (born STEFFEN BERKHAHN; 21 December 1975 in Anklam, Germany[1]) is a Berlin-based house and techno DJ, producer and label manager. He was the number one DJ on Resident Advisor's Top 100 DJ Poll every year from 2013 to the last annual poll in 2016.


Life and work

Berkhahn grew up in East Berlin and was aiming for a career as a professional footballer or a long-distance runner, an ambition that was thwarted due to injury.[2][3][4][5][6]

In the early 1990s he began DJing under the name Dixon in Berlin clubs such as Turbine, Tresor, E-Werk and WMF.[7] For several years he held a weekly residency at WMF with Mitja Prinz, which he describes a key experience in his formative years as a DJ.[8] His residencies at Tresor, WMF and later Weekend Club all involved playing long sets.[9] In a city known in particular for techno music, Dixon established a reputation as a deep house DJ.[10][11][12]

Dixon's global prominence as a DJ has grown over the years through appearances at clubs and festivals worldwide.[13][14][15] He was voted No. 1 in Resident Advisor's Top 100 DJ Poll in the years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22] In terms of style, German newspaper Die Welt credits Dixon with "bringing back vocals, drama and grand emotions to the dancefloor" after the electronic dance music scene was dominated by minimal techno for several years.[23] Die Tageszeitung agrees that Dixon and Innervisions "changed the sound of Berlin."[24]

Dixon first began record label and A&R work at the Sonar-Kollektiv sublabel Recreation Recordings.[25] In 2005 he founded the label Innervisions with Kristian Beyer and Frank Wiedemann from Âme.[26][27] Initially a sub-label of Sonar Kollektiv, it became independent in 2006.[28][29] British magazine Mixmag says the label has had "an astounding influence on the global house scene."[30]

As a producer, Dixon has released several EPs in collaboration with artists such as Georg Levin, Derrick Carter, Henrik Schwarz and Âme.[31][32][33][34] Dixon often creates his own edits of other artists' tracks for use in his DJ sets.[35]

Berkhahn lives with his wife and son in Berlin.[36][37]

In 2018, Dixon was added into _Grand Theft Auto Online_ as a nightclub DJ as part of the _After Hours_ DLC.[38]
