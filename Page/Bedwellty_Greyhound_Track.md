BEDWELLTY GREYHOUND TRACK was a greyhound racing track in the hamlet of Bedwellty, near Aberbargoed, South Wales.

The track was situated north of the Bedwellty Road and east of Aberbargoed. The track was larger than the hamlet of Bedwellty itself and sat at a high altitude in Gwent not far from the Brecon Beacons.[1]

Racing began in 1929 on Monday and Friday evenings, the track was independent (unaffiliated to a governing body) and race distances were over 300, 510 and 700 yards with the circuit being described as suiting early paced well balanced dogs. There was car parking for 150 vehicles and on course bookmakers. In 2007 after 78 years of racing the stadium closed.[2]
