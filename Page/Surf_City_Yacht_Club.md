The SURF CITY YACHT CLUB (SCYC) is a private yacht club located on Long Beach Island (Surf City, New Jersey), on Barnegat Bay.[1]


History

The Surf City Yacht Club was formally incorporated as a non-profit club under the laws of New Jersey on September 26, 1940, after a group of young men had been getting together since 1894 to create an informal organization to promote aquatic sports. They purchased lot 36 fronting south side of 9th street in 1937 for $200, acquiring lots 34 and 35 in 1939 to expand their space. These lots eventually became what is the marina today. In 1952, it was decided to acquire two additional lots with riparian rights between 9th and 10th Streets, and in 1954 a club house was built on the lots between 9th and 10th Streets and is where the present day Surf City Yacht Club resides with the South 9th Street lots comprising the marina.[2]


Fleets

Junior sailing and interclubs racing fleets include Optimist, Sunfish, Laser, 420 and Windsurfing. There are also Lightning, Snipe and Mariner senior fleets.


Regattas

SCYC is the usual site of the Snipe Atlantic Coast Championships.[3]
