_CORYMBIA LEPTOLOMA_, commonly known as the PALUMA RANGE YELLOWJACKET[1] or YELLOW JACKET, is a member of the Corymbia genus native to Queensland.[2]

The tree typically grows to a height of and is covered with rough, tessellated grey-yellow bark on the trunk and larger branches. Adult leaves are bright green on the upper surface and paler underneath, they have a lanceolate shape and are wide.[3]

_Corymbia leichhardtii_ sometimes occurs in the same vicinity and can be distinguished from _C. leptoloma_ by dull leaves that are a similar colour on both sides.

The population of _C. leptoloma_ is unknown but it is restricted to a small area north west of Townsville. It grows in remnant areas of wet sclerophyll forest in association with _Syncarpia glomulifera_, _Eucalyptus resinifera_ and _Corymbia intermedia_ in gullies or on hillsides. It occurs in coarse sandy soils derived from granite.[4]
