PAUL GARDNER ALLEN (January 21, 1953 – October 15, 2018) was an American business magnate, investor, researcher, humanitarian, and philanthropist. He co-founded Microsoft alongside Bill Gates in 1975, which helped spark the microcomputer revolution and later became the world's largest PC software company.[1] In March 2018, Allen was estimated to be the 44th-wealthiest person in the world according to the _Forbes_ annual list of the world's billionaires, with an estimated net worth of $21.7 billion, revised at the time of his death to $20.3 billion.[2][3][4]

Allen was the founder, with his sister Jody Allen, and Chairman[5] of Vulcan Inc., the privately held company that managed his various business and philanthropic efforts. He had a multibillion-dollar investment portfolio including technology and media companies, scientific research, real estate holdings, private spaceflight ventures, and stakes in other sectors. He owned two professional sports teams: the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League[6] and the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association,[7] and was part-owner of the Seattle Sounders FC, which joined Major League Soccer in 2009.[8]

Allen was the founder of the Allen Institute for Brain Science,[9] Institute for Artificial Intelligence,[10] Institute for Cell Science,[11] Stratolaunch Systems,[12] and Apex Learning.[13] He gave more than $2 billion to causes such as education, wildlife and environmental conservation, the arts, healthcare, community services, and more.[14] He received numerous awards and honors in several different professions, and was listed among the _Time_ 100 Most Influential People in the World in both 2007 and 2008.[15]


Early life

Allen was born on January 21, 1953, in Seattle, Washington, to Kenneth Sam Allen and Edna Faye (née Gardner) Allen.[16] Allen attended Lakeside School, a private school in Seattle, where he befriended the two-years-younger Bill Gates, with whom he shared an enthusiasm for computers. They used Lakeside's Teletype terminal to develop their programming skills on several time-sharing computer systems.[17] They also used the laboratory of the Computer Science Department of the University of Washington, doing personal research and computer programming; on at least one occasion in 1971 they were banned from the laboratory for abuse of their privileges there.[18] According to Allen, in their teenage years he and Bill Gates would go dumpster-diving for computer program code.[19] After graduating and obtaining a perfect SAT score of 1600,[20] Allen went to Washington State University, where he joined Phi Kappa Theta fraternity.[21][22][23] He dropped out after two years to work as a programmer for Honeywell in Boston, near Harvard University where Bill Gates had ended up.[24] Allen later convinced Gates to drop out of Harvard in order to create Microsoft.[25]


Microsoft

code that produced the Altair BASIC, developed by Allen, Bill Gates and Monte Davidoff. Also pictured are two early Microsoft business cards, showing Gates as President and Allen as Vice President]] In 1975, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Allen and Gates began marketing a BASIC programming language interpreter.[26] Allen came up with the original name of "Micro-Soft" (a combination of "microcomputer" and "software"), according to a 1995 _Fortune_ magazine article.[27]

In 1980, after Microsoft had committed to deliver IBM a disk operating system (DOS) for the original IBM PC, although they had not yet developed one, Allen spearheaded a deal for Microsoft to purchase QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System), written by Tim Paterson, who, at the time, was employed at Seattle Computer Products.[28][29] As a result of this transaction, Microsoft was able to secure a contract to supply the DOS that would eventually run on IBM's PC line. This contract with IBM proved the watershed in Microsoft history that led to Allen's and Gates' wealth and success.[30]

The relationship between Allen and Gates, the company's two technology leaders, became less close as they argued even over small things.[31] Allen effectively left Microsoft in 1982 after receiving a Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosis.[32][33]

Gates reportedly asked Allen to give him some of his shares to compensate for the higher amount of work being performed by Gates.[34][35] According to Allen, Gates said since he "did almost everything on BASIC", the company should be split 60–40 in his favor. Allen agreed to this arrangement, which Gates later renegotiated to 64–36.[36] In 1983, Gates tried to buy Allen out at $5 per share but Allen refused and left the company with his shares intact. This made Allen a billionaire when Microsoft went public.[37][38] Gates repaired his friendship with Allen, and the two men donated $2.2 million to Lakeside in 1986.

Allen resigned from his position on the Microsoft board of directors on November 9, 2000. He remained as a senior strategy advisor to the company's executives.[39][40][41] In January 2014, he still held 100 million shares of Microsoft.[42]


Business and investments

Financial and technology

-   VULCAN CAPITAL is an investment arm of Allen's Seattle-based Vulcan Inc., which has managed his personal fortune. In 2013, Allen opened a new Vulcan Capital office in Palo Alto, California, to focus on making new investments in emerging technology and internet companies.[43]

-   APPS: Allen backed A.R.O., the startup behind the mobile app Saga;[45] SportStream, a social app for sports fans;[46] and a content-management app called Fayve.[47]
-   INTERVAL RESEARCH CORPORATION: In 1992, Allen and David Liddle co-founded Interval Research Corporation, a Silicon Valley-based laboratory and new business incubator that was dissolved in 2000 after generating over 300 patents,[48] four of which were the subject of Allen's August 2010 patent infringement lawsuit against AOL, Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Office Depot, OfficeMax, Staples, Yahoo!, and YouTube.[49][50]
-   TICKETMASTER: In 1993, Allen invested $243 million to acquire 80% of Ticketmaster. In 1997, Home Shopping Network acquired 47.5% of Allen's stock in exchange for $209 million worth of their own stock.[51]
-   CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS: In 1998, Allen bought a controlling interest in Charter Communications.[52] Charter filed for bankruptcy reorganization in 2009, with Allen's loss estimated at $7 billion. Allen kept a small stake after Charter emerged from reorganization, worth $535 million in 2012.[53] The company's 2016 purchase and subsequent merger of Time Warner Cable with Charter's subsidiary, Spectrum, made Charter Communications the second-largest cable company in the U.S.[54][55]

Aerospace

Allen confirmed that he was the sole investor behind aerospace engineer and entrepreneur Burt Rutan's SpaceShipOne suborbital commercial spacecraft on October 4, 2004.[56] The craft was developed and flown by Mojave Aerospace Ventures, which was a joint venture between Allen and Rutan's aviation company, Scaled Composites. SpaceShipOne climbed to an altitude of over the Mojave Air and Space Port and was the first privately funded effort to successfully put a civilian in suborbital space. It won the Ansari X Prize competition and received the $10 million prize.[57]

aircraft, 2018]] On December 13, 2011, Allen announced the creation of Stratolaunch Systems, based at the Mojave Air and Space Port. The Stratolaunch is a proposed orbital launch system consisting of a dual-bodied, 6-engine jet aircraft, capable of carrying a rocket to high altitude; the rocket would then separate from its carrier aircraft and fire its own engines to complete its climb into orbit. If successful, this project would be the first wholly privately funded space transport system.[58] Stratolaunch, which is partnering with Orbital ATK and Scaled Composites, is intended to launch in inclement weather, fly without worrying about the availability of launch pads and to operate from different locations. Stratolaunch plans to ultimately host six to ten missions per year.[59] On April 13, 2015, Vulcan Aerospace was announced. It is the company within Allen's Vulcan Inc. that plans and executes projects to shift how the world conceptualizes space travel through cost reduction and on-demand access.[60]

On April 13, 2019, the Stratolaunch aircraft made its maiden flight, reaching and 165 kn (305 km/h) in a 2 h 29 min flight.[61][62] Stratolaunch CEO Jean Floyd offered this comment: "We dedicate this day to the man who inspired us all to strive for ways to empower the world's problem-solvers, Paul Allen. Without a doubt, he would have been exceptionally proud to see his aircraft take flight".[63]

As of the end of May 2019, Stratolaunch Systems Corporation is closing operations.[64]

_Idea Man_

In 2011, Allen's memoir, _Idea Man: A Memoir by the Cofounder of Microsoft_, was published by Portfolio, a Penguin Group imprint. The book recounts how Allen became enamored with computers at an early age, conceived the idea for Microsoft, recruited his friend Bill Gates to join him, and launched what would become the world's most successful software company. It also explores Allen's business and creative ventures following his 1983 departure from Microsoft, including his involvement in SpaceShipOne, his purchase of the Portland Trailblazers and Seattle Seahawks, his passion for music, and his ongoing support for scientific research. The book made _The New York Times Best Seller list_ and the paperback version, which included a new epilogue, came out on October 30, 2012.[217][218]
