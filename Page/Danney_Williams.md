DANNEY LEE WILLIAMS JR. (born December 7, 1985) is a biracial man from Little Rock, Arkansas who claims to be the biological son of Bill Clinton, the former President of the United States.[1] The claim remains unproven.[2]


Background

Williams was born in 1985 to Danney Williams Sr. and Bobbie Ann Williams, a former prostitute.[3]

The story about Bobbie's relationship with Bill Clinton was started by the _Daily Mail_ in 1992, but it failed to gain media attention. However, the story was revived in the late 1990s when reporting by _Newsmax_ led by celebrity tabloid magazine _Star_ to commission a paternity test prove whether Williams is actually Clinton's biological son.[4] _Time_ magazine cited _Star_ on July 18, 1999 to say that there was no match.[5]

The story was revived in 2016 before the 2016 presidential election and pushed by a number of media outlets including Newsmax, Drudge Report,[6] as well as WorldNetDaily,[7] _New York Daily News_,[8] and _Daily Mail_.[9]

Due to some uncertainties with the original test by _Star_, Snopes concluded that the claim was unproven.[10] _The Washington Post_ stated that, while the test could not prove Clinton was the father, it did conclusively rule him out as the father.[11]

On October 19, 2016, Williams' lawyers announced their intentions to file a paternity suit to prove that Clinton's DNA matched Williams'. Williams wrote to Monica Lewinsky asking for her dress in order to obtain a sample of Clinton's DNA. However, Lewinsky never replied Williams.[12] A partial analysis of Clinton's blood, and thus his DNA, was already part of the public record because of the Lewinsky affair investigation.[13] Russian-funded Facebook advertisements prior to the 2016 presidential election included ads claiming that Williams was Clinton's son.[14]


Personal life

Williams has five children[15] and is unmarried.
