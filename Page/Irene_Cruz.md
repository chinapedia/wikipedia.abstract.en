Biography

Irene Cruz was born in Madrid, Spain, in 1987. She attended the Complutense University of Madrid, where she majored in Marketing, Public Relations and Audiovisual Communication. She also attended the International master's degree in Photography at Efti (formerly, Escuela de Fotografía y Técnica de Imagen, currently Centro Internacional de Fotografía y Cine) in 2011, when she traveled to Berlin for the first time and decided to become a professional photographer. In 2013, she attended the course "Nuevas Iluminaciones. Fundamentos narrativos de la luz" at Efti, which has been a crucial influence in her later works. She is nowadays a well-known artist that has participated in more than 250 exhibitions all over the world, including cities like Paris, New York City, Buenos Aires, Madrid, and Berlin. Nowadays she is working for the first time as a photography director on Alejo Moreno's movie titled "Diana".


Approach and style

Her artwork is about mystery, privacy, integration with the landscape. She works away from customisation to represent universal emotions and feelings.

Another distinguishing feature is the light, a light of sunset, a cold light ...that's "her pantone", Irene always feels a very big attraction to that natural environments dim and intimate, subdued, serene, enveloping the stage. Rarely she shows faces in her photos. The main key is what means the word "liminal" (referring to a position of an initial stage of a process, or be on both sides of a boundary or threshold)... are between day and night, between the tranquility and restlessness. Is not a limit. It is a road, a bridge.

Nature is everything.
