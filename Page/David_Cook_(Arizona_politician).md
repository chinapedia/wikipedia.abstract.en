Personal life

2018 Arrest

On December 19, 2018, Cook was pulled over by a Department of Public Safety (DPS) trooper in Mesa, Arizona when the officer spotted Cook's vehicle moving out of its lane on Loop 202. When asked to step out of the vehicle, Cook responded with “Do you know what you’re doing, son? You’re making a mistake.” Cook was arrested with a blood-alcohol content of 0.152% to 0.158%, well above the state limit of 0.08%. When the officer informed Cook that he would lose his driver's license, he responded with "I’m fine; don’t worry, you’ll get yours/-" [3] In a plea bargain, appearing before a former Arizona state representative, he received a sentence of one day in jail, a fine, plus probation with conditions including no excessive drinking for five years, and he completed a 16-hour on-line DUI course.[4]
