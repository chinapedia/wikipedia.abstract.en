MAR-LEN ABIGAIL "ABBY" BINAY-CAMPOS (born December 12, 1975) is a Filipina politician who has been the Mayor of Makati since 2016. She formerly served in the Congress as Representative of Makati's 2nd District from 2007 to 2016, when she was replaced by her husband, Luis Campos. She is also the daughter of former Vice President and presidential candidate Jejomar Binay.


Early life

Binay was born on December 12, 1975, as the second of five children and the second of four daughters of Jejomar Binay and Elenita Sombillo. She is the younger sister of Nancy Binay, a current Senator, and the older sister of Junjun Binay, the former mayor of Makati.


Political career

At a young age, Binay started her career at MABINI under former Sen. Rene Saguisag as part of the defense counsel for the soldiers involved in the Oakwood mutiny.[1]

In 2007, she was elected representative of Makati's 2nd District, succeeding Butz Aquino and passed several bills under her watch.

In the wake of her brother Junjun's ouster as Makati mayor by the Ombudsman of the Philippines in 2015,[2] Binay announced her candidacy as Mayor of Makati, inviting Cong. Monique Lagdameo as vice mayor of the city competing with Kid Peña and Karla Mercado.[3]

On May 9, 2016, Binay and Lagdameo won the mayoral and vice-mayoral election, respectively.[4] They took their oath of office on June 27, 2016. Abby's first day as Mayor of Makati began three days later on June 30, and by that time her father's term as vice president already expired.

As a result, Abby is the fourth Binay family member, the second female Binay member to administer Makati in 18 years since her mother Elenita Binay, who served as Makati mayor from 1998 to 2001.


Personal life

She has been married to Luis N. Campos Jr. since 2008. They have one child, Martina Campos.
