Rugby career

Shannon

Foley played for Shannon throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s.[3] At the time, the club enjoyed a fierce rivalry with Cork Constitution, with the two sides being the top teams in the province of Munster.[4] Shannon won the Munster Senior Cup in the 1976–77, 1977–78 and 1981–82 seasons.

Munster

Foley played for Munster in many famous games. An "outstanding performance" in a narrow defeat against a touring in 1976 earned him his first ever cap for two weeks later. By coincidence, he also played in the Munster side that beat Australia in 1981 just a week before his final appearance for Ireland.[5] His best known appearance for Munster however, came when they famously beat on 31 October 1978, with Foley playing alongside his Shannon club mates Colm Tucker and Gerry McLoughlin in the side.[6]

Ireland

Foley made his debut for against in Parc des Princes on 7 February 1976, on the back of a strong performance for Munster against two weeks previously.[7] He went on to play 11 times for Ireland, with eight of these appearances coming in the Five Nations Championship. Foley made his last international appearance on 21 November 1981 against Australia in Lansdowne Road.[8]
