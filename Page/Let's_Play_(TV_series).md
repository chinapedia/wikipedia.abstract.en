LET'S PLAY is a long-running British pre-school TV programme, run from 2012 to date on CBeebies. Main presenters have included Sidney Sloane and Rebecca Keatley.[1]

The premise of the show is each episode involves the presenters going on an adventure and dressing up as various characters involved before bringing in comedy and play. Examples include mountain climbing and visiting musical lands. Usually one presenter will play the primary adventurer with the other acting as the other characters met.[2] Each episode will usually have at least one short song played within.[3]

Let's Play is also performed in a stage variation It's Time to Play which is performed by Sloane and Keatley in front of a live audience, with a similar focus on play, dress-up and adventures.[4] The stage show moves with each performance to a different location to allow a wider range of live audiences to attend.[5]
