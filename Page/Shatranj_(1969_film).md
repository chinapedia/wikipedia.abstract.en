Plot

Sharda has been married to Thakur for several years, and both have a daughter: Meena. Sharda and Meena suddenly decide to leave India and settle down in a communist country, without letting Thakur know. Concerned about them, Thakur hires Jai, a spy, to locate them, and bring them back if possible. Jai agrees and soon arrives in that country, which is ruled by a military general who has not shown his face to anyone. Jai assumes the identity of Shinraaz, goes around trying to locate the two women, and finds Meena, who works as a dancer in a hotel. Jai eventually learns what brought Meena and her mother to this country, and why they both are not willing to return to India.

Production

_Shatranj_ was the final film directed by S. S. Vasan.[2] He co-produced the film with N. N. Sippy under Gemini Studios.[3][4] Madan Puri's character was modelled after the fictional character Fu Manchu.[5] The film was colourised using Eastmancolor.[6]


Soundtrack

The music was composed by the duo Shankar Jaikishan.[7][8] Hasrat Jaipuri, S. H. Bihari, Indeevar and Kiran Kalyani were the lyricists.[9]


Release and reception

_Shatranj_ was an "anti-China movie", and theatres screening the film in West Bengal were burnt down by Communist revolutionaries.[10] It was later forcibly removed from exhibition by the Government of that state.[11] In Bathinda, Naxalites tried to blow up the theatre where the film was being screened, but the police successfully removed the bomb before it could do any damage.[12] In a review dated 29 March 1969, the magazine _Thought_ wrote, "Watching a game of shatranj, one needs some intelligence and common sense to follow the opponents' moves and countermoves. Watching _Shatranj_, the film, one has to suspend both intellect and [judgement]."[13] The film was commercially successful but, according to Vasan's son Balan, "not to the extent expected by the maker".[14]
