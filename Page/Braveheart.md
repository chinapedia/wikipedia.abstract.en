_BRAVEHEART_ is a 1995 epic war film directed, co-produced, and starring Mel Gibson, who portrays William Wallace, a late-13th-century Scottish warrior. The film is fictionally based on the life of Wallace leading the Scots in the First War of Scottish Independence against King Edward I of England. The film also stars Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan and Catherine McCormack. The story is inspired by Blind Harry's epic poem _The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace_ and was adapted for the screen by Randall Wallace.

Development on the film initially started at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer when producer Alan Ladd Jr. picked up the project from Wallace, but when MGM was going through new management, Ladd left the studio and took the project with him. Despite initially declining, Gibson eventually decided to direct the film, as well as star as Wallace. The film was filmed in Scotland and Ireland from June to October 1994 with a budget around $65–70 million.[1] _Braveheart_, which was produced by Gibson's Icon Productions and The Ladd Company, was distributed by Paramount Pictures in North America and by 20th Century Fox internationally.

Released on May 26, 1995, _Braveheart_ received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances, directing, production values, battle sequences, and musical score; but criticized its inaccuracies regarding Wallace's title, love interests, and attire.[2] The film grossed $75.6 million in the US and grossed $210.4 million worldwide. At the 68th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for ten Academy Awards and won five: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Makeup, and Best Sound Editing.

The film's title is taken from the name of Wallace's famous broadsword, and the movie's final shot is of that sword on the field at Bannockburn.


Plot

In 1280, King Edward "Longshanks" invades and conquers Scotland following the death of Alexander III of Scotland, who left no heir to the throne. Young William Wallace witnesses Longshanks' treachery, survives the deaths of his father and brother, and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal Uncle Argyle, where he is educated. Years later, in 1297, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including _Prima Nocte_. Meanwhile, a grown Wallace returns to Scotland and falls in love with his childhood friend Murron MacClannough, and the two marry in secret. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as she fights off their second attempt, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to slaughter the English garrison in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England.

Longshanks orders his son Prince Edward to stop Wallace by any means necessary. Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at the Battle of Stirling and then destroys the city of York, killing Longshanks' nephew and sending his severed head to the king. Wallace seeks the assistance of Robert the Bruce, the son of nobleman Robert the Elder and a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son's wife Isabella of France to try to negotiate with Wallace as a distraction for the landing of another invasion force in Scotland.

After meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace. She warns him of the coming invasion, and Wallace implores the Scottish nobility to take immediate action to counter the threat and take back the country, asking Robert the Bruce to lead. In 1298, leading the English army himself, Longshanks confronts the Scots at Falkirk. There, noblemen Mornay and Lochlan turn their backs on Wallace after being bribed by the king. Wallace is then further betrayed when he discovers Robert the Bruce was fighting alongside Longshanks; after the battle, after seeing the damage he helped do to his countrymen, the Bruce vows not to be on the wrong side again.

Wallace kills Lochlan and Mornay for their betrayal, and wages a guerrilla war against the English for the next seven years, assisted by Isabella, with whom he eventually has an affair. In 1305, Robert sets up a meeting with Wallace in Edinburgh, but Robert's father has conspired with other nobles to capture and hand over Wallace to the English. Learning of his treachery, Robert disowns his father. Isabella exacts revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks by telling him that his bloodline will be destroyed upon his death as she is now pregnant with Wallace's child.

In London, Wallace is brought before an English magistrate, tried for high treason, and condemned to public torture and beheading. Even whilst being hanged, drawn and quartered, Wallace refuses to submit to the king. As cries for mercy come from the watching crowd deeply moved by the Scotsman's valor, the magistrate offers him one final chance, asking him only to utter the word, "Mercy", and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, "Freedom!", and the judge orders his death. Moments before being decapitated, Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd, smiling at him.

In 1314, Robert, now Scotland's king, leads a Scottish army before a ceremonial line of English troops on the fields of Bannockburn, where he is to formally accept English rule. As he begins to ride toward the English, he stops and invokes Wallace's memory by throwing Wallace's sword point-down in front of the English army, imploring his men to fight with him as they did with Wallace. Robert then leads his army into battle against the stunned English, winning the Scots their freedom. The final shot of the film is the sun setting behind Wallace's sword as it sways in the wind.

Production

Producer Alan Ladd Jr. initially had the project at MGM-Pathé Communications when he picked up the script from Wallace.[3] When MGM was going through new management in 1993, Ladd left the studio and took some of its top properties, including _Braveheart_.[4] Gibson came across the script and even though he liked it, he initially passed on it. However, the thought of it kept coming back to him and he ultimately decided to take on the project.[5] Gibson was initially interested in directing only and considered Brad Pitt in the role of William Wallace, but Gibson reluctantly agreed to play Wallace as well.[6] ]]

Gibson and his production company, Icon Productions, had difficulty raising enough money for the film. Warner Bros. was willing to fund the project on the condition that Gibson sign for another _Lethal Weapon_ sequel, which he refused. Gibson eventually gained enough financing for the film, with Paramount Pictures financing a third of the budget in exchange for North American distribution rights to the film, and 20th Century Fox putting up two thirds of the budget in exchange for international distribution rights.[7][8]

Principal photography on the film began on June 6, 1994.[9] While the crew spent six weeks shooting on location in Scotland, the major battle scenes were shot in Ireland using members of the Irish Army Reserve as extras. To lower costs, Gibson had the same extras, up to 1,600 in some scenes, portray both armies. The reservists had been given permission to grow beards and swapped their military uniforms for medieval garb.[10] Principal photography ended on October 28, 1994.[11] The film was shot in the anamorphic format with Panavision C- and E-Series lenses.[12]

Gibson had to tone down the film's battle scenes to avoid an NC-17 rating from the MPAA; the final version was rated R for "brutal medieval warfare".[13] Gibson and editor Steven Rosenblum initially had a film at 195 minutes, but Sheryl Lansing, who was the head of Paramount at the time, requested Gibson and Rosenblum to cut the film down to 177 minutes.[14] According to Gibson in a 2016 interview with _Collider_, there is a four-hour version of the film and would be interested in reassembling it if both Paramount and Fox are interested.[15]


Soundtrack

The score was composed and conducted by James Horner and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. It is Horner's second of three collaborations with Mel Gibson as director. The score has gone on to be one of the most commercially successful soundtracks of all time. It received considerable acclaim from film critics and audiences and was nominated for a number of awards, including the Academy Award, Saturn Award, BAFTA Award, and Golden Globe Award.


Release and reception

Box office

On its opening weekend, _Braveheart_ grossed $9,938,276 in the United States and $75.6 million in its box office run in the U.S. and Canada.[16] Worldwide, the film grossed $210,409,945 and was the thirteenth-highest-grossing film of 1995.[17]

Critical response

_Braveheart_ earned positive reviews; critics praised Gibson's direction and performance as Wallace, the performances of its cast, and its screenplay, production values, Horner's score, and the battle sequences. The depiction of the Battle of Stirling Bridge was listed by CNN as one of the best battles in cinema history.[18] However, it was also criticized for its depiction of history. The film holds a 77% approval rating at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 7.25/10, based on 75 reviews. The site's consensus states "Distractingly violent and historically dodgy, Mel Gibson's _Braveheart_ justifies its epic length by delivering enough sweeping action, drama, and romance to match its ambition."[19] The film also has a score of 68 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 20 critic reviews indicating "generally favorable reviews".[20] for his work on _Braveheart_. ]] Caryn James of _The New York Times_ praised the film, calling it "one of the most spectacular entertainments in years." Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of four, calling it "An action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of _The Road Warrior_." In a positive review, Gene Siskel wrote that "in addition to staging battle scenes well, Gibson also manages to recreate the filth and mood of 700 years ago."[21] Peter Travers of _Rolling Stone_ felt that "though the film dawdles a bit with the shimmery, dappled love stuff involving Wallace with a Scottish peasant and a French princess, the action will pin you to your seat."

Not all reviews were positive, however. Richard Schickel of _TIME_ magazine argued that "everybody knows that a non-blubbering clause is standard in all movie stars' contracts. Too bad there isn't one banning self-indulgence when they direct."[22] Peter Stack of _San Francisco Chronicle_ felt "at times the film seems an obsessive ode to Mel Gibson machismo."[23] In a 2005 poll by British film magazine _Empire_, _Braveheart_ was No. 1 on their list of "The Top 10 Worst Pictures to Win Best Picture Oscar".[24] _Empire_ readers had previously voted _Braveheart_ the best film of 1995.[25]

Effect on tourism

The European premiere was on September 3, 1995, in Stirling.[26]

In 1996, the year after the film was released, the annual three-day "Braveheart Conference" at Stirling Castle attracted fans of _Braveheart_, increasing the conference's attendance to 167,000 from 66,000 in the previous year.[27] In the following year, research on visitors to the Stirling area indicated that 55% of the visitors had seen _Braveheart_. Of visitors from outside Scotland, 15% of those who saw _Braveheart_ said it influenced their decision to visit the country. Of all visitors who saw _Braveheart_, 39% said the film influenced in part their decision to visit Stirling, and 19% said the film was one of the main reasons for their visit.[28] In the same year, a tourism report said that the "_Braveheart_ effect" earned Scotland ₤7 million to ₤15 million in tourist revenue, and the report led to various national organizations encouraging international film productions to take place in Scotland.[29]

The film generated huge interest in Scotland and in Scottish history, not only around the world, but also in Scotland itself. Fans came from all over the world to see the places in Scotland where William Wallace fought, also to the places in Scotland and Ireland used as locations in the film. At a _Braveheart_ Convention in 1997, held in Stirling the day after the Scottish Devolution vote and attended by 200 delegates from around the world, _Braveheart_ author Randall Wallace, Seoras Wallace of the Wallace Clan, Scottish historian David Ross and Bláithín FitzGerald from Ireland gave lectures on various aspects of the film. Several of the actors also attended including James Robinson (Young William), Andrew Weir (Young Hamish), Julie Austin (the young bride) and Mhairi Calvey (Young Murron).

Awards and honors

_Braveheart_ was nominated for many awards during the 1995 Oscar season, though it was not viewed by many as a major contender such as _Apollo 13_, _Il Postino: The Postman_, _Leaving Las Vegas_, _Sense and Sensibility_, and _The Usual Suspects_. It wasn't until after the film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director at the 53rd Golden Globe Awards that it was viewed as a serious Oscar contender. When the nominations were announced for the 68th Academy Awards, _Braveheart_ received ten Academy Award nominations, and a month later, won five including Best Picture, Best Director for Gibson, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects Editing, and Best Makeup.[30] _Braveheart_ became the ninth film to win Best Picture with no acting nominations and is one of only three films to win Best Picture without being nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, the other being _The Shape of Water_ in 2017 and followed by _Green Book_ the following year.[31][32][33] The film also won the Writer's Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay.[34] In 2010, the Independent Film & Television Alliance selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years[35]

Cultural effects

Lin Anderson, author of _Braveheart: From Hollywood To Holyrood_, credits the film with playing a significant role in affecting the Scottish political landscape in the mid-to-late 1990s.[42]

Wallace Monument

In 1997, a , sandstone statue depicting Mel Gibson as William Wallace in _Braveheart_ was placed in the car park of the Wallace Monument near Stirling, Scotland. The statue, which was the work of Tom Church, a monumental mason from Brechin,[43] included the word 'Braveheart' on Wallace's shield. The installation became the cause of much controversy; one local resident stated that it was wrong to "desecrate the main memorial to Wallace with a lump of crap".[44] In 1998, someone wielding a hammer vandalized the statue's face. After repairs were made, the statue was encased in a cage every night to prevent further vandalism. This only incited more calls for the statue to be removed, as it then appeared that the Gibson/Wallace figure was imprisoned. The statue was described as "among the most loathed pieces of public art in Scotland".[45] In 2008, the statue was returned to its sculptor to make room for a new visitor centre being built at the foot of the Wallace Monument.[46]


Historical inaccuracy

Randall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay, has acknowledged Blind Harry's 15th-century epic poem _The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie_ as a major inspiration for the film.[47] In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, "Is Blind Harry true? I don't know. I know that it spoke to my heart and that's what matters to me, that it spoke to my heart."[48] Blind Harry's poem is not regarded as historically accurate, and although some incidents in the film that are not historically accurate are taken from Blind Harry (e.g. the hanging of Scottish nobles at the start),[49] there are large parts that are based neither on history nor Blind Harry (e.g. Wallace's affair with Princess Isabella).[50]

Elizabeth Ewan describes _Braveheart_ as a film that "almost totally sacrifices historical accuracy for epic adventure".[51] The "brave heart" refers in Scottish history to that of Robert the Bruce, and an attribution by William Edmondstoune Aytoun, in his poem _Heart of Bruce_, to Sir James the Good Douglas: "Pass thee first, thou dauntless heart, As thou wert wont of yore!", prior to Douglas' demise at the Battle of Teba in Andalusia.[52] It has been described as one of the most historically inaccurate modern films.[53]

Sharon Krossa noted that the film contains numerous historical errors, beginning with the wearing of belted plaid by Wallace and his men. In that period "no Scots [...] wore belted plaids (let alone kilts of any kind)." Moreover, when Highlanders finally did begin wearing the belted plaid, it was not "in the rather bizarre style depicted in the film". She compares the inaccuracy to "a film about Colonial America showing the colonial men wearing 20th century business suits, but with the jackets worn back-to-front instead of the right way around."[54] In a previous essay about the film, she wrote, "The events aren't accurate, the dates aren't accurate, the characters aren't accurate, the names aren't accurate, the clothes aren't accurate—in short, just about nothing is accurate."[55] The belted plaid (_feileadh mór léine_) was not introduced until the 16th century.[56] Peter Traquair has referred to Wallace's "farcical representation as a wild and hairy highlander painted with woad (1,000 years too late) running amok in a tartan kilt (500 years too early)."[57]

Irish historian Seán Duffy remarked "the battle of Stirling Bridge could have done with a bridge."[58]

In 2009, the film was second on a list of "most historically inaccurate movies" in _The Times_.[59] In the humorous non-fictional historiography _An Utterly Impartial History of Britain_ (2007), author John O'Farrell claims that _Braveheart_ could not have been more historically inaccurate, even if a "Plasticine dog" had been inserted in the film and the title changed to "_William Wallace and Gromit_".[60]

In the DVD audio commentary of _Braveheart_, Mel Gibson acknowledges many of the historical inaccuracies but defends his choices as director, noting that the way events were portrayed in the film was much more "cinematically compelling" than the historical fact or conventional mythos.[61]

_Jus primae noctis_

Edward Longshanks, King of England, is shown invoking _Jus primae noctis_, allowing the lord of a medieval estate to take the virginity of his serfs' maiden daughters on their wedding nights. Critical medieval scholarship regards this supposed right as a myth: "the simple reason why we are dealing with a myth here rests in the surprising fact that practically all writers who make any such claims have never been able or willing to cite any trustworthy source, if they have any."[62][63]

Occupation and independence

The film suggests Scotland had been under English occupation for some time, at least during Wallace's childhood, and in the run-up to the Battle of Falkirk Wallace says to the younger Bruce, "[W]e'll have what none of us have ever had before, a country of our own." In fact, Scotland had been invaded by England only the year before Wallace's rebellion; prior to the death of King Alexander III it had been a fully separate kingdom.[64]

Portrayal of William Wallace

As John Shelton Lawrence and Robert Jewett write, "Because [William] Wallace is one of Scotland's most important national heroes and because he lived in the very distant past, much that is believed about him is probably the stuff of legend. But there is a factual strand that historians agree to", summarized from Scots scholar Matt Ewart:

A. E. Christa Canitz writes about the historical William Wallace further: "[He] was a younger son of the Scottish gentry, usually accompanied by his own chaplain, well-educated, and eventually, having been appointed Guardian of the Kingdom of Scotland, engaged in diplomatic correspondence with the Hanseatic cities of Lübeck and Hamburg". She finds that in _Braveheart_, "any hint of his descent from the lowland gentry (i.e., the lesser nobility) is erased, and he is presented as an economically and politically marginalized Highlander and 'a farmer'—as one with the common peasant, and with a strong spiritual connection to the land which he is destined to liberate."[65]

Colin McArthur writes that _Braveheart_ "constructs Wallace as a kind of modern, nationalist guerrilla leader in a period half a millennium before the appearance of nationalism on the historical stage as a concept under which disparate classes and interests might be mobilised within a nation state." Writing about _Braveheart_{{'}}s "omissions of verified historical facts", McArthur notes that Wallace made "overtures to Edward I seeking less severe treatment after his defeat at Falkirk", as well as "the well-documented fact of Wallace's having resorted to conscription and his willingness to hang those who refused to serve."[66] Canitz posits that depicting "such lack of class solidarity" as the conscriptions and related hangings "would contaminate the movie's image of Wallace as the morally irreproachable _primus inter pares_ among his peasant fighters."[67]

Portrayal of Isabella of France

Isabella of France is shown having an affair with Wallace after the Battle of Falkirk. She later tells Edward I she is pregnant, implying that her son, Edward III, was a product of the affair. In reality, Isabella was around three years old and living in France at the time of the Battle of Falkirk, was not married to Edward II until he was already king, and Edward III was born seven years after Wallace died.[68][69]

Portrayal of Robert the Bruce

Robert the Bruce did change sides between the Scots loyalists and the English more than once in the earlier stages of the Wars of Scottish Independence, but he never betrayed Wallace directly, and he probably did not fight on the English side at the Battle of Falkirk (although this claim does appear in a few medieval sources).[70] Later, the Battle of Bannockburn was not a spontaneous battle; he had already been fighting a guerrilla campaign against the English for eight years. His title before becoming king was Earl of Carrick, not Earl of Bruce.[71]

Portrayal of Longshanks and Prince Edward

The actual Edward I was ruthless and temperamental, but the film exaggerates his negative aspects for effect. Edward enjoyed poetry and harp music, was a devoted and loving husband to his wife Eleanor of Castile, and as a religious man he gave generously to charity. The film's scene where he scoffs cynically at Isabella for distributing gold to the poor after Wallace refuses it as a bribe would have been unlikely. Also, Edward died on campaign two years after Wallace's execution, not in bed at his home.[72]

The depiction of the future Edward II as an effeminate homosexual drew accusations of homophobia against Gibson.

The actual Edward II, who fathered five children by two different women, was rumoured to have had sexual affairs with men, including Piers Gaveston, on whom the Prince's male lover Phillip was loosely based.

Gibson defended his depiction of Prince Edward as weak and ineffectual, saying:

In response to Longshanks' murder of the Prince's male lover Phillip, Gibson replied: "The fact that King Edward throws this character out a window has nothing to do with him being gay ... He's terrible to his son, to everybody."[73] Gibson asserted that the reason Longshanks kills his son's lover is because the king is a "psychopath".[74] Gibson expressed bewilderment that some filmgoers would laugh at this murder. The real Gaveston was never murdered by Edward I. Edward I died in 1307, with Gaveston living past his death, until 1312.[75]

Wallace's military campaign

"MacGregors from the next glen" joining Wallace shortly after the action at Lanark is dubious, since it is questionable whether Clan Gregor existed at that stage, and when they did emerge their traditional home was Glen Orchy, some distance from Lanark.[76]

Wallace did win an important victory at the Battle of Stirling Bridge, but the version in _Braveheart_ is highly inaccurate, as it was filmed without a bridge (and without Andrew Moray, joint commander of the Scots army, who was fatally injured in the battle). Later, Wallace did carry out a large-scale raid into the north of England, but he did not get as far south as York, nor did he kill Longshanks' nephew[77] (however, this was not as wide of the mark as Blind Harry, who has Wallace making it as far south as St. Albans, and only refraining from attacking London after the English queen came out to meet him).[78] Edward's nephew John of Brittany did take part in the Wars of Scottish Independence, but he was not killed, dying of natural causes.[79]

The "Irish conscripts" at the Battle of Falkirk are also unhistorical; there were no Irish troops at Falkirk (although many of the English army were actually Welsh), and it is anachronistic to refer to conscripts in the Middle Ages (although there were feudal levies).[80]

The two-handed long swords used by Gibson in the film were not in wide use in the period. A one-handed sword and shield would have been more accurate.[81]


Accusations of Anglophobia

Sections of the English media accused the film of harboring Anglophobia. _The Economist_ called it "xenophobic",[82] and John Sutherland writing in _The Guardian_ stated that: "_Braveheart_ gave full rein to a toxic Anglophobia".[83][84][85]

In _The Times_, Colin McArthur said "the political effects are truly pernicious. It's a xenophobic film."[86] Ian Burrell of _The Independent_ has noted, "The _Braveheart_ phenomenon, a Hollywood-inspired rise in Scottish nationalism, has been linked to a rise in anti-English prejudice".[87]


Home media

_Braveheart_ was released on DVD on August 29, 2000.[88] It was released on Blu-ray as part of the _Paramount Sapphire Series_ on September 1, 2009.[89] It was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray as part of the 4K upgrade of the _Paramount Sapphire Series_ on May 15, 2018.[90]


Sequel

On February 9, 2018, a sequel titled _Robert the Bruce_ was announced.
