_POSSESSION_ is the third and final album by the metalcore band, Benea Reach.


Critical reception

Adam Rees of Metal Hammer wrote "However, it’s the centrepiece, Crown, that encompasses everything that makes Possession such a startling achievement, melding heaviness and haunting beauty with deft ease."[1] Andy Synn of No Clean Singing stated "The performances are impeccable, the passion is palpable, and the end result is truly magical. A triumph of creativity over popularity."[2]
