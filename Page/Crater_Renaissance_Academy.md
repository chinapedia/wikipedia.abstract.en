CRATER RENAISSANCE ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES is a public high school located in Jackson County, Oregon, United States. It is one of three public high schools in Oregon's School District 6, serving the Southern Oregon communities of Central Point, Gold Hill and Sams Valley.


History

In 2007 Crater High School was reorganized through a program called the Small School Initiative. With assistance from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Meyer Memorial Trust, four smaller, independent high schools were created: Crater Renaissance Academy (CRA), Crater Academy of Health and Public Services (CAHPS), Crater School of Business Innovation and Science (BIS), and the Crater Academy of Natural Sciences (CANS).[1] While CANS was disbanded due to declining enrollment in 2012, the three remaining high schools, each with individual academic emphasis and culture, continue to serve the communities of Central Point, Gold Hill and Sams Valley.[2]

Crater Renaissance Academy was acknowledged by _US News and World Report_ as among the Best High Schools in the United States (bronze award) in 2014, 2015, and 2016.[3]

In 2016, Crater Renaissance was one of eight schools in the nation to receive the gold award from the Schools of Opportunity.[4][5] This award seeks "to recognize schools that are excellent because they engage in research-based practices that focus on closing gaps in opportunity, regardless of the students they serve."[6]

Also in 2016, Crater Renaissance was one of four schools in Oregon selected by the Quality Education Commission to serve as a model site in its College Readiness Case Study Project.[7]

Bob King served as principal from the school's inception in 2007 through the 2015-2016 school year.

Crater Renaissance Academy was founded on the principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools (CES), using its ten principles to guide its decisions.[8]
