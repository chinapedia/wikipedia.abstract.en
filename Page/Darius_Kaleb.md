Acting career

Netflix Original - Luke Cage

Kaleb plays the character “Lonnie Wilson” in the Netflix original series Luke Cage.[1] The character depicts the struggles of black youth in modern American society, and deals with social issues pertinent to that culture. His role as Lonnie Wilson addresses issues surrounding police brutality towards young African Americans.[2][3]

Lonnie Wilson is a kid from Harlem, where the show is located. He meets Luke Cage, the main character, who looks out for him on the streets. Lonnie is taken into custody for questioning about Luke Cage, and is given a brutal beating by one of the police officers. This leads to a leak of the abusive treatment to the media by corrupt politicians—for their own benefit. In this role, he is a supporter of Luke's whom he knows is innocent of the crimes he has allegedly committed.

In December, 2016, Netflix announced that Luke Cage would air for a second season.[4]

STEPS (Independent Film)

In this independent film written by Eddie B. Harris, Kaleb plays "Omar" the son of the main character "Brian". Kaleb's character in the film is a symbol of what his father had lost and what he was striving to regain by taking steps toward redemption.[5][6]

ABC pilot - Delores & Jermaine

ABC Network has cast Darius Kaleb as "Jamaal", the younger brother, in Whoopi Goldberg and Jermaine Fowler's new pilot series "Delores and Jermaine".[7][8]

The new pilot is about Jermaine, a young millennial who after being kicked out of his house, moves in with his grandmother Delores, who after quitting her job as a DC cop never leaves her home anymore. The two of them end up needing each other more than they would have thought, as Jermaine is in need of parental guidance, while Delores needs a push to get her back into the world.[9]

Kaleb has had an excellent career on Broadway. He played parts in multiple shows, alongside some big celebrities.

However, before performing on Broadway in NYC, Kaleb toured Japan, where he played the role of young Michael Jackson in “Thriller Live”.[11]
