Description

This nudibranch has a white dorsum with rounded black spots in a single row along both sides of the body, with a spot at the front, in front of the white rhinophores, and a similar spot at the back of the mantle. It is a moderately large Phyllidiid, growing to about 40 mm in length. It is similar to _Phyllidia scottjohnsoni_ but that species has black spots along the midline of the back.[4] It is possible that there are several undescribed species with similar coloration.[5]


Diet

This species feeds on a white sponge.[6]
