RENÉE MÉNDEZ CAPOTE Y CHAPLE (12 November 1901 – 14 May 1989), also known by the pseudonyms IO-SAN, BERENGUELA, and SUZANNE, was a Cuban writer, essayist, journalist, translator, suffragist, and feminist activist.[1][2][3][4] She worked in children's literature, short stories, essays, and biographies.[5]


Life and work

The daughter of Domingo Méndez Capote and María Chaple y Suárez, she made her publishing debut in April 1917 with an article titled "El primer baile" (The first dance) for the alumni newsletter of La Salle College.[6]

Her works include _Memorias de una cubanita que nació con el siglo_ (_Memories of a Cuban girl who was born with the century_), considered a classic of testimonial literature.[7] In the journalistic field, she contributed to several of her country's publications, such as _Diario de la Marina_, _La Gaceta de Cuba_, _Revolución y Cultura_, _Unión y Juventud Rebelde_, as well as the magazines _Bohemia_, _Social y Mujeres_ and the weekly newspaper _Pionero_.[8]

In September 1934, Méndez Capote was a survivor of the last voyage of the American luxury cruise liner _Morro Castle_. She was one of the few passengers to escape the expensive A-Deck staterooms alive as well as the only woman passenger to be rescued by one of the ship's own lifeboats (most other passengers survived by jumping off the ship).[9]


Activism

Together with Berta Arocena de Martínez Márquez, she was one of the founders of the Lyceum on 1 December 1928, one of the "most cultural and intellectual" feminist organizations of the era.[10] They were joined by Carmen Castellanos, Matilde Martínez Márquez, Carmelina Guanche, Alicia Santamaría, Ofelia Tomé, Dulce Marta Castellanos, Lilliam Mederos, Rebeca Gutiérrez, Sarah Méndez Capote, Mary Caballero, María Josefa Vidaurreta, and María Teresa Moré in organizing a group which advocated for women's suffrage.[11] This became a lobbyist institution in Cuba's parliament and organized several feminist events in the country.[12]
