_BURMESARCHAEA_ is an extinct genus of spiders, placed in the family Archaeidae. , only one species has been assigned to the genus, _BURMESARCHAEA GRIMALDII_, found in Cretaceous Burmese amber,[1] dated to 88–95 million years ago.[2]


Description

_Burmesarchaea grimaldii_ is only known from a single male specimen preserved in amber. It is a small spider, with a body length of just under 2 mm. Characteristic of the family Archaeidae, the head region is raised up from the thorax, although without the distinctive "neck" found in other genera in the family. It is presumed to have eight eyes (the posterior median eye is not visible); the anterior median eye is the largest. The chelicerae ("jaws") are long relative to the body at about 0.8 mm, and project forward at about 45 degrees. The longest leg, the first, is 3.3 mm long; the shortest, the third, is 1.7 mm long. All the legs are without spines. The pedipalp has a large, rounded bulb with a spoon-shaped embolus and bent tegular apophysis.[3]


Taxonomy

A fossil spider from Burmese amber was first described by David Penny in 2003, as _Afrarchaea grimaldii_.[4] The species name _grimaldii_ honours David Grimaldi of the American Museum of Natural History for his contributions to the study of amber and for assistance with the specimen. In 2008, J. Wunderlich transferred _A. grimaldii_ to his newly erected genus, _Burmesarchaea_.[5][6]
