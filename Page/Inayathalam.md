Production

Shankar and Suresh, a charted accountant and a doctor, respectively, joined to direct their first feature film _Inayathalam_, a movie on cyber crime.[1] Ganesh Venkatraman and Shweta Menon were signed to play the lead roles of investigation officers.[2] The film began its shoot in August 2016 for two days, before resuming shoot in September.[3] Portions of the film were shot in Kari Motor Speedway, Chettipalayam before the team moved to Coimbatore in October 2016.[4]

Review

Though Shankar-Suresh have won in story selection and roping in the cast and the crew, they have missed out on presenting the film in a racy manner. But still, Inayathalam impresses in parts.[5]
