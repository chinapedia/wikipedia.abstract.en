In Greek mythology, PASIPHAË (;[1] _Pasipháē_, "wide-shining" derived from πᾶς _pas_ "all, for all, of all" and φάος/φῶς _phaos/phos_ "light")[2] was a queen of Crete.


Family

Pasiphae was the daughter of Helios, the Sun, and Perse,[3] of the Oceanids. [4] Like her doublet Europa, her origins were in the East, in her case at Colchis; she was the sister of Circe, Aeëtes and Perses, and she was given in marriage to King Minos of Crete. With Minos, she was the mother of Acacallis, Ariadne, Androgeus, Glaucus, Deucalion, Phaedra, Xenodice, and Catreus. She was also the mother of "starlike" Asterion, called by the Greeks the Minotaur.

Mythology

Minotaur

After a curse from Poseidon, Pasiphae experienced lust for and mated with a white bull sent by Poseidon.[5] Mythological scholars and authors Ruck and Staples remarked that "the Bull was the old pre-Olympian Poseidon." [6]

In the Greek literalistic understanding of a Minoan myth,[7] in order to actually copulate with the bull, she had the Athenian artificer Daedalus[8] construct a portable wooden cow with a cowhide covering, within which she was able to satisfy her strong desire.[9] The effect of the Greek interpretation was to reduce a more-than-human female, daughter of the Sun itself, to a stereotyped emblem of grotesque bestiality and the shocking excesses of female sensuality and deceit.[10] Pasiphaë appeared in Virgil's _Eclogue VI_ (45–60), in Silenus' list of suitable mythological subjects, on which Virgil lingers in such detail that he gives the sixteen-line episode the weight of a brief inset myth.[11] In Ovid's _Ars Amatoria_ Pasiphaë is framed in zoophilic terms: _Pasiphae fieri gaudebat adultera tauri_—"Pasiphaë took pleasure in becoming an adulteress with a bull."

Curse of Pasiphae

In other aspects, Pasiphaë, like her niece Medea, was a mistress of magical herbal arts in the Greek imagination. The author of _Bibliotheke_ (3.197-198) records the fidelity charm she placed upon Minos, who would ejaculate serpents, scorpions, and centipedes killing any unlawful concubine; but Procris, with a protective herb, lay with Minos with impunity.[12]


On divination

In mainland Greece, Pasiphaë was worshipped as an oracular goddess at Thalamae, one of the original _koine_ of Sparta. The geographer Pausanias describes the shrine as small, situated near a clear stream, and flanked by bronze statues of Helios and Pasiphaë. His account also equates Pasiphaë with Ino and the lunar goddess Selene.

Cicero writes in _De Divinatione_ 1.96 that the Spartan ephors would sleep at the shrine of Pasiphaë, seeking prophetic dreams to aid them in governance. According to Plutarch,[13] Spartan society twice underwent major upheavals sparked by ephors' dreams at the shrine during the Hellenistic era. In one case, an ephor dreamed that some of his colleagues' chairs were removed from the agora, and that a voice called out "this is better for Sparta"; inspired by this, King Cleomenes acted to consolidate royal power. Again during the reign of King Agis, several ephors brought the people into revolt with oracles from Pasiphaë's shrine promising remission of debts and redistribution of land.


Possible celestial deity

In _Description of Greece_, Pausanias equates Pasiphaë with Selene, implying that the figure was worshipped as a lunar deity.[14] However, further studies on Minoan religion indicate that the sun was a female figure, suggesting instead that Pasiphaë was originally a solar goddess, an interpretation consistent with her depiction as Helios' daughter.[15] Poseidon's bull may in turn be vestigial of the lunar bull prevalent in Middle Eastern religions.[16]

[7] Specific astrological or calendrical interpretations of the mystic mating of the "wide-shining" daughter of the Sun with a mythological bull, transformed into an unnatural curse in Hellene myth, are prone to variability and debate.

[8] Daedalus was of the line of the chthonic king at Athens Erechtheus.

[9] Greek myth characteristically emphasizes the accursed unnaturalness of a mystical marriage conceived literally as merely carnal: a fragment of Bacchylides alludes to "her unspeakable sickness" and Hyginus (_Fabulae_ 40) to "an unnatural love for a bull."

[10] This was the commonplace of brief notices of Pasiphaë among Latin poets, too, Rebecca Armstrong notes, in _Cretan Women: Pasiphae, Ariadne, and Phaedra in Latin Poetry_ (Oxford University Press) 2006:169. Armstrong falls into the trap of literalness: in discussing the list of candidates for children of Pasiphaë and Minos, she remarks, "It seems unlikely that Pasiphaë gave birth to these human children _after_ her liaison with the bull." (172 note 9); but there is no chronologically coherent narrative _before_ and _after_ in myth or dream, the aspect of myth that Ruck and Staples (1994:9) call "the suspension of linear chronology", a feature which is remarked upon in all introductions to Greek myth.
