SAN FELICE is a Roman Catholic church in the town of Massa Martana, province of Perugia, Umbria, Italy.


History

The church is dedicated to the town patron saint, Felice, said to have been the bishop and later martyr during the persecutions by Emperors Diocletian and Maximinian.

While the church was initially erected by medieval times, the present structure has undergone many re-edifications. The church was damaged during the second world war. The fa√ßade with stone blocks has tall pilasters and a baroque belltower rising from the cornice. The interior has a single nave surrounded by large pilasters. The main altarpiece depicts the _Madonna with Blessed Ruggero, St Felix, Santa Rita and St Pope Pius V_ (1723) by Giacinto Boccanera. On the wall to the left of the entrance are two 16th-century frescoes depicting a _Crucifixion_ and an _Enthroned Virgin and Child with Saints Roch and Ambrosius_. There are also 15th-century frescoes including a _Virgin and Child with St Sebastian and St Bernardino da Siena._[1]
