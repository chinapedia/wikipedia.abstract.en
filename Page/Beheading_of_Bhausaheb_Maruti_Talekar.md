Incident

In the early hours of 27 February 2000, a guerilla attack led by Ilyas Kashmiri and twenty-five[4] HuJI terrorists was launched at the Ashok Lightening Post, Nowshehra sector in the Rajouri district of Jammu and Kashmir, India.[5][6] The attack was covered by heavy mortar and rocket fire from Pakistani soldiers, which were dressed in black uniform and reported to be from Special Services Group.[7] The Indian post is surrounded on all three sides by the Pakistani posts and is said to be an unfavorable position.[8] Bhausaheb Maruti Talekar was on guard duty, and other seven soldiers of the 17 Maratha Light Infantry were in the bunker at the time of incident. Ilyas Kashmiri slit Talekar's throat and thereafter other terrorists accompanying him opened fire inside bunker in which all seven soldiers were killed.[9]

The head of Talekar was taken across the Line of Control in Pakistan by the terrorists[10] and was brandished as a trophy before the public.[11][12] According to Indian Army, Talekar was the first casualty of the attack.[13] A captured terrorist revealed that they had played football with the head of Talekar.[14]

Pakistan denied that its soldiers were involved in the incident.[15]


Aftermath

Ilyas Kashmiri

Pakistani media published the photographs of Ilyas Kasmiri carrying the severed head of Talekar.[16] It also reported that the then president of Pakistan Gen. Pervez Musharraf honored Ilyas Kashmiri in a ceremony and rewarded his one-lakh ruppes cash for bringing the head of an Indian soldier.[17][18][19][20] Ilyas Kashmiri, was killed in a US drone attack in 2011.[21][22]

The inquiry against the commanding officer

The commanding officer of the unit was Colonel Sandes. He had communicated to the superiors seeking permission to shift the Ashok listening post because of the possibility of a sneaking attack such as the one which happened on the 27 February 2000, but he was denied permission. He faced a court of inquiry after the incident which exonerated him, but his superiors had reported that colonel Sandes was unfit for commanding a unit. The colonel had to fight a legal battle to be eligible for promotion. Sandes was promoted to the rank of Brigadier in 2010.[23]

Talekar's memory

The army took up the responsibility of the education of his sister after the incident. His family continues to receive a pension of 10,000 per month. A sum of 12 lakh rupees was given to Talekar's family as compensation.[24]

In his memory, a community hall was built in his village. His sister is pursuing the hope to start a school for special children in his memory.[25]

Similar incidents

Since the torture and murder of Saurabh Kalia during the Kargil war in the custody of Pakistani troops; many allegations of mistreatment of soldiers by the other side have been reported from Kashmir. The beheading of Talekar happened one year after the Kargil war ended. Pakistan has filed complaints with the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) accusing the Indian Army of beheading at least a dozen Pakistani soldiers since 1998.[26] India has denied these allegations.[27][28] In one decade before 2013, when Lance Naik Hemraj was beheaded, there have been at least three other such instances of decapitation of Indian soldiers by the Pakistani troops.[29]
