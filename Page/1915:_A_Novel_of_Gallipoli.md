Reception

_Kirkus Reviews_ wrote "A standard kit of ingredients goes into this Australian WW I novel about a pair of friends, their girls, their fates in war—but it develops with a dimensional quality provided by some very good writing. ... True, McDonald can sometimes get a little bogged down with miniature effects of perception—which still and sap his most bash-about scenes. But this is a small complaint against what otherwise is a strong, though tenuous, book about destructive innocence—how it leads to tragedies large and small."[2] Roger Hillman, writing in the _Australian Humanities Review_ refers to it as one of the "key texts from the reception history of the Australian (Gallipoli) legend."[3]

_Kunapipi_ called it "outstanding" and wrote "It's a poet's novel, beautifully written; perhaps slower and longer than it should be, but a remarkable achievement and one that promises much from his next novel nevertheless."[4]
