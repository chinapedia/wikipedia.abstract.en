JOHN HOLLOWAY (19 February 1943 - 12 March 2013) was an Australian public servant and diplomat and an advisor to the Cambodian Government. Over his career he played a key role in the Cambodian peace process, including during his time as Australian Ambassador to Cambodia from 1992 to 1994.[1][2][3][4][5]

During his career as a diplomat, Holloway took a close interest in Southeast Asian affairs. His career highlights included the following:

-   First Secretary in the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur (September 1970 to September 1973)

In June 1995, Victorian MP Ken Aldred claimed in Parliament that Holloway was a paedophile.[6] The then Secretary to of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Michael Costello told Fran Kelly in a media interview that police had investigated and said there was no evidence to support the allegation.[7] Holloway was arrested in Cambodia and brought back to Australia to face charges, including for having sex with a 14-year-old boy. Holloway denied the charge and was acquitted in 1996.[8]

Holoway later returned to Cambodia, remaining active as an adviser to the Cambodian government and working with numerous international bodies and non-government organisations. He died in Cambodia in March 2013 after a battle with skin cancer and diabetes.
