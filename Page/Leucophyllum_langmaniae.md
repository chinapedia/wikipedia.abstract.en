_LEUCOPHYLLUM LANGMANIAE_ is a shrub native of Mexico (Chihuahuan Desert), semi-evergreen, with gray-green leaves of velvety texture. Its shape is branched and compact, forming a rounded mass of up to high and wide. The flowers are lavender. They appear in the fall, and are even more abundant if drought or heat waves were important.[1]

_Leucophyllum langmaniae_ is called LANGMAN'S SAGE or RIO BRAVO SAGE. However, it is not a true sage and it has no systematics relationship to the genus _Salvia_.

The plant species name _langmaniae_ was given in honor of Ida Kaplan Langman.
