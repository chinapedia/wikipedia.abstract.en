CANNABIS IN NORTH CAROLINA, United States, is illegal for recreational and most medical use, with an extremely narrow exception in the case of the latter.[1]


Decriminalization (1977)

In 1977, during a short-lived wave of decriminalization in the country, North Carolina reduced the penalty for possession of small amounts of cannabis.[2]


Failed medical legalization (2014)

A medical marijuana bill was introduced in May, 2014, but was killed by the House Committee in March, 2015. Additionally, the House Committee issued an "unfavorable report", which blocks the House from considering bills with medical marijuana components for the next two years. Non-psychoactive cannabis has essentially become legalized, but special seeds of very specific low THC strains (industrial hemp) and licensing must be purchased from the state.[3]


Legalization of CBD (2015)

In 2015, Governor Pat McCrory signed into law HB766, allowing those with intractable epilepsy to use CBD oil. His endorsement followed a House vote of 112–22 and Senate vote of 47–0.[4][5] The law does not establish any infrastructure for which potential patients may legally purchase CBD within the state.


Legalization of hemp (2017)
