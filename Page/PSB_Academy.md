History

Once a division of Singaporeâ€™s National Productivity Board (NPB), the Management Services Supervisory Development division was formalised into a full-fledged institution - the Institute for Productivity Training (IPT) in 1988 [2], with the aim of upgrading the knowledge and skills of the workforce.

It was later corporatised in 2001 and privatised in 2006.[3]
