ALBANIA participated in the EUROVISION SONG CONTEST 2017 with the song "World", written by Lindita Halimi, Klodian Qafoku and Gerald Xhari. The song was performed by Lindita Halimi. The Albanian broadcaster Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH) organised the 55th edition of the Albanian song competition _Festivali i Këngës_ in order to select the Albanian entry for the 2017 contest in Kiev, Ukraine. The competition consisted of twenty-five entries competing in two semi-finals held on 21 and 22 December 2016, followed by a final on 23 December 2016 where fourteen entries qualified to compete. A twelve-member jury panel and a public televote selected "Botë", performed by Lindita, as the winner. The song was later translated from Albanian to English for the Eurovision Song Contest and was titled "World".

Albania was drawn to compete in the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 9 May 2017. Performing during the show in position 4, "World" was not announced among the top 10 entries of the first semi-final and therefore did not qualify to compete in the final.


Background

Prior to the 2017 Contest, Albania had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest thirteen times since its first entry in 2004.[1] The nation's best placing in the contest was fifth, which it achieved in 2012 with the song "Suus" performed by Rona Nishliu. Following the introduction of semi-finals for the , Albania had, to this point, featured in seven finals. In 2016, Albania failed to qualify for the final and placed sixteenth with the song "Fairytale" performed by Eneda Tarifa.

The Albanian national broadcaster, Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH), broadcasts the event within Albania and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. The Albanian competition _Festivali i Këngës_ has been organised every year since 1964 and has been used as Albania's Eurovision selection method since its debut in 2004. Details regarding the 55th edition of _Festivali i Këngës_ were announced on 8 August 2016;[2] however, the Albanian broadcaster formally confirmed their participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 on 24 September 2016.[3]

Promotion

Lindita made several appearances across Europe to specifically promote "World" as the Albanian Eurovision entry. Between 3 and 6 April, she took part in promotional activities in Tel Aviv, Israel where she performed during the _Israel Calling_ event held at the Ha'teatron venue.[5][6] On 8 April, Lindita performed during the _Eurovision in Concert_ event which was held at the Melkweg venue in Amsterdam, Netherlands and hosted by Cornald Maas and Selma Björnsdóttir.[7] On 15 April, she performed during the _Eurovision Spain Pre-Party_, which was held at the Sala La Riviera venue in Madrid, Spain.[8]


At Eurovision

Lindita_Kyiv_2017.jpg According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the "Big 5" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot.[9] On 31 January 2017, a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. Albania was placed into the first semi-final, to be held on 9 May 2017, and was scheduled to perform in the first half of the show.[10]

Once all the competing songs for the 2017 contest had been released, the running order for the semi-finals was decided by the shows' producers rather than through another draw, so that similar songs were not placed next to each other. Albania was set to perform in position 4, following the entry from Australia and before the entry from Belgium.[11]

Semi-final

Lindita took part in technical rehearsals on 30 April and 4 May, followed by dress rehearsals on 8 and 9 May.[12] This included the jury show on 8 May where the professional juries of each country watched and voted on the competing entries.

At the end of the show, Albania was not announced among the top 10 entries in the second semi-final and therefore failed to qualify to compete in the final.It was later revealed that Albania placed fourteenth in the semi-final, receiving a total of 76 points: 38 points from the televoting and also 38 points from the juries.

Voting

Both semi-finals and the final were broadcast in Albania on RTSH1 HD, RTSH Muzikë and Radio Tirana with commentary by Andri Xhahu. The Albanian spokesperson, who announced the top 12-point score awarded by the Albanian jury during the final, was Andri Xhahu. Below is a breakdown of points awarded to Albania and awarded by Albania in the first semi-final and grand final of the contest, and the breakdown of the jury voting and televoting conducted during the two shows:[13][14]
