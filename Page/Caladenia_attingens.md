_CALADENIA ATTINGENS_, commonly known as MANTIS ORCHIDS, are plants in the orchid family Orchidaceae and are endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. There are three subspecies, each of which has a single hairy leaf and one or two brightly coloured flowers with upswept sepals and a labellum with long, comb-like fringes. The subspecies differ in size, distribution and habitat.


Description

_Caladenia attingens_ is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and wide. The lower part of the leaf often has reddish blotches.[1][2][3][4]

There are one or two flowers on a hairy spike high, each flower long and wide. The flowers are green, white and yellow with reddish-purple areas. The dorsal sepal is erect, sometimes curves forward, long, wide with a swollen glandular tip . The lateral sepals are long, wide and upswept with a glandular tip similar to the one on the dorsal sepal. The petals are long, long, spread widely and usually lack a glandular tip. The labellum is greenish-yellow with a red tip and four or more rows of dark red calli along its centre. The sides of the labellum bear long, green, comb-like teeth. Flowering occurs between August and November.[5][6][7]


Taxonomy and naming

_Caladenia attingens_ was first formally described by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown in 2001 and the description was published in Nuytsia.[8] The specific epithet (_attingens_) is a Latin word meaning "reaching to" or "attaining", referring to the calli which extend as far as the tip of the labellum.[9]

When Hooper and Brown described the species, they also described two subspecies, _C. attingens_ subsp. _attingens_[10] and _C. attingens_ subsp. _gracillima_.[11] Since then, a third subspecies has been described by Andrew Brown and Garry Brockman and given the name _C. attingens_ subsp. _effusa_.[12]


Distribution and habitat

Mantis orchids occur between Perth and Israelite Bay, growing in a range of habitats, depending on subspecies.[13]


Conservation

All three subspecies of _Caladenia attingens_ are classified as "Not Threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[14]
