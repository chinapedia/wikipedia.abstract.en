Novak Djokovic was the three-time defending champion, but lost to Marin Čilić in the quarterfinals. As a result of Roger Federer's withdrawal from the tournament, he fell outside of the top 10 in the ATP rankings for the first time since 13 May 2002.

The top two seeds (Djokovic and Andy Murray) were in contention for the world No. 1 ranking at the start of the tournament.[1] Djokovic lost in the quarterfinals, and Murray became number 1 by reaching the tournament final when his semifinal opponent, Milos Raonic withdrew because of injury.[2]

Murray went on to win the title, defeating John Isner in the final, 6–3, 6–7^((4–7)), 6–4.
