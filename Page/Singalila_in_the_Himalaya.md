_SINGALILA IN THE HIMALAYA_ is a 2016 film directed by George Thengummoottil. It tells the story of a young Keratoconus patient finding his way in life to trek through the Himalayas and finds that, the best medicine for his eyes are the sights of the beautiful mountains and valleys in the Himalayas.[1] The film progress with a 14 day long trek along the border of India and Nepal, known as the Singalila Ridge from where the team enjoys panoramic views of Mount Kangchenjunga and Mount Everest.

On the 13th day, the team reach a remote village at the border of India and Nepal, inhibited by a lone nomadic yak herder. These are the last generation of nomadic yak herders found in the Himalayas.[2] The title song Singalila in the Himalaya was sung by Adithi Sivaraman, daughter of Malayalam playback singer Chitra Iyer.


Plot

George Thengummoottil, who became blind during his childhood due to an eye disorder called Keratoconus travels through the Himalayas to find solace and peace in his life.[3][4][5]

The team follow the path of three Himalayan explorers. A major part of the trek follows the trail used by Douglas William Freshfield, the British Mountaineer who encircled Mount Kangchenjunga in 1903. On day seven, the team reach Khangla Pass at the border of India and Nepal from where the team head south along the Singalila Ridge, the border between India and Nepal following the path of Joseph Dalton Hooker, to reach West Bengal.


Filming technique

Most of the film was shot in the remote mountains of Sikkim and Nepal Himalayas, inside three national parks Khangchendzonga National Park, Singalila National Park and Varsey Rhododendron Sanctuary. More than 15 potters were hired to carry the equipment and food during the expedition.[6]

The film is shot on cameras charged entirely on solar panels carried by the team during the trek. They used a homemade solar charger by modifying the car battery charger.[7][8]
