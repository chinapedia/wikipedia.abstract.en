_ANGELS_ is a 1983 novel by American author Denis Johnson. It was Johnson's first novel; previously, he had published several books of poetry. Alice Hoffman, writing for the _New York Times_, referred to the novel as "a mixture of poetry and obscenity".[1] _Angels_ follows two characters – Jamie, a young mother fleeing her abusive husband, and Bill Houston, a restless ex-convict – who encounter one another on an interstate bus trip. Bill Houston also appears in Johnson's novel _Tree of Smoke_, which won the National Book Award in 2007.[2] In 1999, David Foster Wallace included the novel on his list of overlooked American books published after 1960.[3]
