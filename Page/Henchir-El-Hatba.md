History

Henchir-El-Hatba was settled in Roman times [3] probably during the Roman Republic.[4]

A broken inscription gives the Roman name as _Fundus Ver..._[5] Although the full name is not known, that the town is the seat of the ancient titular see known as Verrona, it is possible that the full Roman name was _Fundus Verrona_.

Inscriptions from Henchir-El-Hatba show it had colonia status and may have been the site of an _imperial estate_.[6]
