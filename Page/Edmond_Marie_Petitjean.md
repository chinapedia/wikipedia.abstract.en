Biography

His father was a lawyer and wanted him to follow suit; forcing him to study law despite his artistic talent and sending him to Paris, where he was apprenticed to a notary. While there, he visited the museums and became determined to be an artist. His parents cut off his financial support, but he was able to find employment managing a small factory in Nancy. This enabled him to purchase the painting supplies he needed.[1] Peitijean-Fishermen.jpg]] In 1874, he held his first solo exhibit at the Salon des Artistes Français. He was awarded honorable mention at the Salon of 1881 and, two years later, became a member. This was followed by a First Class medal in 1884 and a Second Class medal in 1885.[2]

He painted in several ports along the Atlantic coast and spent a year working in Dordrecht. He participated in decorating several pavilions at the Exposition Universelle (1889) and was presented with a silver medal.[3] The following year, he exhibited in Munich.
