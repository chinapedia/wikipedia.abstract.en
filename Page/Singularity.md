SINGULARITY or SINGULAR POINT may refer to:


Science, technology, and mathematics

-   Isolated singularity, a mathematical singularity that has no other singularities close to it
-   Movable singularity, a concept in singularity theory
-   Removable singularity, a point at which a function is not defined but at which it can be so defined that it is continuous at the singularity

Natural sciences
