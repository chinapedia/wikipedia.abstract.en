TEALE COCO ROIZ (born 6 March 1992) is an Australian model, fashion designer, photographer and owner of an eponymous fashion label.


Early life and education

Coco was born in Melbourne, Australia.[1] "Her interest in photography began at a young age, where she would photograph herself and her surroundings."[2] She studied at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, from where she graduated in 2012 with a Bachelor of Arts in photography with a minor in fashion.[3] Coco said in an interview with _i-D_ that while studying for a degree in photography, she was scouted for by a local modelling agency that placed her with her first international agencies in New Zealand, Korea and Japan.[4] After graduating Coco signed an international contract in Japan, where she worked on contracts with agencies in Tokyo and Osaka.[5]


Modeling

Teale Coco found international placements with Premier Models in London, England,[6][7] Monster Mgmt in Milan, Italy,[8][9] and Muse Models in New York City, United States.[10][11]

In 2016 Coco worked alongside Edward Enninful and Craig McDean photographing for _W_ magazine where she was a featured model and artist in the August 2016 issue.[12]

Coco appeared on the cover of L'Officiel Italia, September 2016, issue #17 with a nine-page editorial spread and interview on her fashion line, with photos shot by Brandon Mercer and styled by Nicola Formichetti[13]

Shortly after Coco was photographed in New York City by Terry Richardson alongside Marilyn Manson for _Dazed_ magazine's 25th anniversary issue, styled by Nicola Formichetti, wearing her own eponymously named design paired with Diesel (brand).[14]

In 2016 Coco posed as the subject for a painting by American "pop surrealist" artist Michael Hussar.[23][24]


Teale Coco The Label

On a trip to Tokyo she had the idea of starting a fashion line of fetish-inspired accessories.[25] The ancient Japanese art of Shibari, is one of the things that Coco has drawn inspiration from in her designs.[26] She began selling these accessories branded "Teale Coco" online.[27][28]

Coco began her fashion career posting on Instagram; Coco was later described as a "social media star" by I-D magazine in 2015.[29] In 2013 Coco opened her self-titled fashion label "Teale Coco", selling her collections of fetish-inspired clothing and accessories.[30]

Coco had no formal education in fashion, but drew upon her own personal taste for inspiration.[31] Soon after she hired a professional seamstress who she began working with to manufacture her designs.[32][33] Coco is part of the Body Positive Movement "There should be no restrictions, either by gender, age or size", making her designs available in a full and customsiable sizing range.[34][35]

Coco and her designs were featured the following year on Vogue.com in June, 2016.[36] In April 2017, Vogue Germany featured Coco and her designs in an article entitled "Hard and tender: How young designers bring "fetish" into the mainstream".[37]

The popular American online alternative fashion retailer Dolls Kill carries "Teale Coco The Brand" in its store.[38]

In 2017 she changed the name of the company from "Teale Coco The Brand" to "Teale Coco The Label."
