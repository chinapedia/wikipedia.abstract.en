Biography

The daughter of an Arab father and a Cuban mother, Landor was born and raised in Lebanon.[5] She was educated in France and Switzerland[6] and she can speak five languages.[7] On joining the BBC in 1989, she first worked for the French service, presenting a news programme. She went on to become one of the first non-British broadcasters in the news department of the BBC World Service, where she presented _Europe Today_ and, two years later, the flagship _Newshour_. She was one of the main presenters of _The World Today_, before becoming the programme's editor.[8]

In 2002, Landor was appointed senior editor of news and current affairs programmes, a department she headed from 2006, gaining responsibility for all World Service English-language news programmes. In late 2009, she moved to the Middle East department of the World Service, with editorial and management responsibilities for all Arabic television and radio broadcasts. In 2013, she became the controller responsible for the BBC World Service's radio and television broadcasting in 27 languages, until her retirement in mid-2016. It was Landor who was instrumental in launching the BBC's _100 Women_ in 2014, in which was included Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by the Taliban.[9][10]

Landor fully appreciates the importance of combining radio and television broadcasting with online service including social media. In a 2014 interview with Hanin Ghaddar of _NOW News_, she stressed the importance of maintaining high-quality news while exploring new possibilities for more effective delivery. The BBC's "impartiality, objectivity, and universal values will not change," she explained. "There are so many ways to get through to audiences, but ultimately you have certain editorial principles that you cannot waive."[11]

On her departure in 2016, the director of BBC News, James Harding, described her as "a defining figure in shaping the World Service" who through the language services had "transformed the BBC’s ability to make sense of the world".[12] The following year the BBC announced the "Liliane Landor Award for Best in Journalism" for a documentary non-fiction work. The first award was won by Karim Sayad for a film about the lives of two Algerian men.[13]

In 2018 Landor became Head of Foreign News for Channel 4, succeeding Nevine Mabro.[14]
