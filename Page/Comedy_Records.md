COMEDY RECORDS is an independent record label run by Toronto-based comedians Tim Golden and Barry Taylor. The label only releases stand up and sketch comedy albums.[1] Comedy Records currently has offices in Toronto and New York City and is distributed through Dine Alone Records.


History

Comedy Records began on July 10, 2010 in Toronto, Canada and was founded by former CFNY-FM personality, Barry Taylor. After being let go from his on-air position in 2009,[2] Taylor began to pursue a career in stand up comedy. One of his early projects was recording a compilation album with ten other up and coming Toronto-based comedians. While looking for distribution, Taylor discovered there were very few labels in Canada releasing comedy albums and the idea for Comedy Records was born. Friend and industry colleague, Joel Carriere[3] agreed to distribute Comedy Records through his label, Dine Alone Records.

In November 2014 Taylor partnered with one of the original Comedy Records comedians, Tim Golden to expand the label to the United States. The company's first American release was with Miami-born comedian Forrest Shaw. The label has since gone on to produce albums at clubs and theatres in Miami,[4] New York[5] and Boston.[6]
