is a Japanese manga artist, game artist and character designer. He first achieved mainstream recognition for his highly successful manga series _Dr. Slump_, before going on to create _Dragon Ball_—his best-known work—and acting as a character designer for several popular video games such as the _Dragon Quest_ series, _Chrono Trigger_ and _Blue Dragon_. Toriyama is regarded as one of the artists that changed the history of manga, as his works are highly influential and popular, particularly _Dragon Ball,_ which many manga artists cite as a source of inspiration.

He earned the 1981 Shogakukan Manga Award for best _shōnen_ or _shōjo_ manga with _Dr. Slump_, and it went on to sell over 35 million copies in Japan. It was adapted into a successful anime series, with a second anime created in 1997, 13 years after the manga ended. His next series, _Dragon Ball_, would become one of the most popular and successful manga in the world. Having sold 250–300 million copies worldwide, it is the second best-selling manga of all time and is considered to be one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. Overseas, _Dragon Ball_{{'}}s anime adaptations have been more successful than the manga and are credited with boosting anime's popularity in the Western world. In 2019, Toriyama was decorated a _Chevalier_ of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his contributions to the arts.


Early life

Akira Toriyama was born in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. He has recalled that when he was in elementary school all of his classmates drew, imitating anime and manga, as a result of not having many forms of entertainment.[1] He believes that he began to advance above everyone else when he started drawing pictures of his friends, and after winning a prize at the local art studio for a picture of _One Hundred and One Dalmatians_, began to think "art was fun".[2]


Career

Early work and success 1978–2000

Before becoming a manga artist, he worked at an advertising agency in Nagoya designing posters for three years.[3] After quitting his previous job, Toriyama entered the manga industry by submitting a work to an amateur contest in a _Jump_ magazine in order to win the prize money.[4] While it did not win, Kazuhiko Torishima, who would later become his editor, contacted him and gave him encouragement.[5] His debut came later in 1978 with the story _Wonder Island_, which was published in _Weekly Shōnen Jump_. However, he did not rise to popularity until the comedy series _Dr. Slump_, which was serialized in _Weekly Shōnen Jump_ from 1980 to 1984. It follows the adventures of a perverted professor and his small but super-strong robot Arale.[6] He began the series at age 25 while living at home with his parents, but when the series ended in 1984 he was a "manga superstar".[7] In 1981, _Dr. Slump_ earned him the Shogakukan Manga Award for best _shōnen_ or _shōjo_ manga series of the year.[8] A very successful anime adaptation aired on TV from 1981 to 1986, with a remake series airing from 1997 to 1999. By 2008, the manga had sold over 35 million copies in Japan.[9]

Toriyama's official fan club was established in 1982. Its newsletters were called _Bird Land Press_ and were sent to members until the club closed in 1987.[10]

In 1984, _Weekly Shōnen Jump_ began serializing Toriyama's _Dragon Ball_, which became an instant hit. As of 2014, it has sold 159.5million _tankōbon_ copies in Japan alone,[11] making it Shueisha's second best-selling manga of all time.[12] It began as an adventure/gag manga but later turned into a martial arts fighting series, considered by many to be the "most influential _shōnen_ manga".[13] _Dragon Ball_ was one of the main reasons for the magazine's circulation hitting a record high of 6.53 million copies (1995).[14][15] The series' success encouraged Toriyama to continue working on it from 1984 to 1995. At the series' end, Toriyama said that he asked everyone involved to let him end the manga, so he could "take some new steps in life".[16] During that 11-year period, he produced 519 chapters that were collected into 42 volumes. Moreover, the success of the manga led to five anime adaptations, several animated movies, numerous video games, and mega-merchandising. The third anime adaptation, _Dragon Ball GT_, was not based on his manga; however, Toriyama was still involved in coming up with the name and designing the main cast.[17] Aside from its popularity in Japan, _Dragon Ball_ was successful internationally as well, including Asia, Europe, and the Americas, with 250–300million tankobon copies of the manga sold worldwide.

Toriyama's design sense led to a position designing characters for the popular _Dragon Quest_ series of role-playing video games (formerly called _Dragon Warrior_ in North America). He has also served as the character designer for the Super Famicom RPG _Chrono Trigger_ and for the fighting games _Tobal No. 1_ and _Tobal 2_ for the PlayStation.

Toriyama's own studio is called Bird Studio,[18] which is a play on his name; meaning "bird". Toriyama does nearly all of the work at Bird Studio himself, and even when he employed an assistant (until 1995, and only one at a time, which is itself rare for manga artists), the assistant did mostly backgrounds. The studio founded in 1983 has produced occasional one-shots, or stand-alone manga that are not serialized, and some other design work. All of Toriyama's manga after _Dragon Ball_ tend to be short (100–200-page) stories, including _Cowa!_, _Kajika_, and _Sand Land_.

2002–present

On December 6, 2002, Toriyama made his only promotional appearance in the United States at the launch of _Weekly Shōnen Jump_'s North American counterpart, _Shonen Jump_, in New York City.[19] Toriyama's _Dragon Ball_ and _Sand Land_ were published in the magazine in the first issue, which also included an in-depth interview with him.[20]

On March 27, 2005, CQ Motors began selling an electric car designed by Toriyama.[21] The one-person QVOLT is part of the company's Choro-Q series of small electric cars, with only 9 being produced. It costs 1,990,000 yen (about $19,000 US), has a top speed of and is available in 5 colors.[22] Designed to look like an American street rod, the QVOLT has a top and a door that are both opened by pulling a cord. Toriyama stated that the car took over a year to design, "but due to my genius mini-model construction skills, I finally arrived at the end of what was a very emotional journey."[23]

He worked on a 2006 one-shot called _Cross Epoch_, in cooperation with _One Piece_ creator Eiichiro Oda. The story is a short crossover that presents characters from both _Dragon Ball_ and _One Piece_. Toriyama was the character designer and artist for the 2006 Mistwalker Xbox 360 exclusive RPG _Blue Dragon_, working with Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu, both of whom he had previously worked with on _Chrono Trigger_.[24] He announced that his help with the making of the _Blue Dragon_ anime might very well be his final work in anime. In his own words, he said:

In 2008, he collaborated with Masakazu Katsura, his good friend and creator of _I"s_ and _Zetman_, for the _Jump SQ_ one-shot _Sachie-chan Good!!_.[25][26] It was published in North America in the free SJ Alpha Yearbook 2013, which was mailed out to annual subscribers of the digital manga magazine _Shonen Jump Alpha_ in December 2012. The two worked together again in 2009, for the three-chapter one-shot _Jiya_ in _Weekly Young Jump_.[27]

Avex Trax commissioned Toriyama to draw a portrait of pop singer Ayumi Hamasaki; it was printed on the CD of her 2009 single "Rule/Sparkle", which was used as the theme song to the American live-action _Dragonball Evolution_ film.[28] Also in 2009, Toriyama drew a manga titled _Delicious Island's Mr. U_ for Anjō's Rural Society Project, a nonprofit environmental organization that teaches the importance of agriculture and nature to young children.[29] They originally asked him to do the illustrations for a pamphlet, but Toriyama liked the project and decided to expand it into a story. It is included in a booklet about environmental awareness that is distributed by the Anjō city government.[30]

He collaborated with _Shōnen Jump_ to create a video to raise awareness and support for those affected by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011.[31] _Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods_, the series' first theatrical film in 17 years, opened on March 30, 2013 and marks the first time Toriyama has been deeply involved in an animation, in this case as early as the screenwriting stages.[32] A special "dual ticket" that can be used to see both _Battle of Gods_ and _One Piece Film: Z_ was created with new art by both Toriyama and Eiichiro Oda, creator of _One Piece_.[33]

His one-shot _Kintoki_, originally published in 2010, was released in North America's online manga anthology _Weekly Shonen Jump_ on January 28, 2013.[34] On March 27, the "Akira Toriyama: The World of _Dragon Ball_" exhibit opened at the Takashimaya department store in Nihonbashi, garnering 72,000 visitors in its first nineteen days.[35][36] The exhibit is separated into seven areas. The first provides a look at the series' history, the second shows the 400-plus characters from the series, the third displays Toriyama's manga manuscripts from memorable scenes, the fourth shows special color illustrations, the fifth displays rare _Dragon Ball_-related materials, the sixth includes design sketches and animation cels from the anime, and the seventh screens _Dragon Ball_-related videos.[37] It was there until April 15, when it moved to Osaka from April 17 to 23, and ended in Toriyama's native Nagoya from July 27 to September 1.[38] To celebrate the 45th anniversary of _Weekly Shōnen Jump_, Toriyama launched a new series in its July 13 issue titled _Jaco the Galactic Patrolman_.[39] Viz Media began serializing it in English in their digital _Weekly Shonen Jump_ magazine, beginning just two days later.[40]

The follow-up film to _Battle of Gods_, _Resurrection 'F'_, released on April 18, 2015, features even more contributions from Toriyama.[41] Toriyama currently writes the story for _Dragon Ball Super_, which began in June 2015. Although its anime adaptation ended in 2018, he continues to write the manga while Toyotarou illustrates it. _Dragon Ball Super: Broly_, released in theaters on December 14, 2018, continued Toriyama's deep involvement with the films.[42]


Personal life

Toriyama married his wife on May 2, 1982.[43][44] She is a former manga artist from Nagoya under the pen name ,[45] and occasionally helped Toriyama and his assistant on _Dr. Slump_ when they were short on time.[46] They have two children: a son named born on March 23, 1987,[47] and a daughter born in October 1990.[48] Toriyama lives in his home studio in Kiyosu.[49] He is a well-known recluse, who avoids appearing in public or media.[50][51][52]

Toriyama has a love of cars and motorcycles, something he inherited from his father who used to race motorbikes and operated an auto repair business for a brief time, although he does not understand the mechanics himself.[53] The author is an animal lover, having kept many different species of birds, dogs, cats, fish, lizards and bugs as pets since childhood.[54] Some were used as models for characters he created such as Karin and Beerus. Toriyama has had a lifelong passion for plastic models,[55] and has designed several for the Fine Molds brand. He also collected autographs of famous manga artists, having over 30 including Yudetamago and Hisashi Eguchi, a hobby he gave to Peasuke Soramame.[56][57]


Style

Toriyama admires Osamu Tezuka's _Astro Boy_ and was impressed by Walt Disney's _One Hundred and One Dalmatians_, which he remembers for its high-quality animation.[58][59] Jackie Chan's early movies also had a noticeable influence on his stories, particularly Chan's martial arts comedy film _Drunken Master_.[60][61] Toriyama stated he was influenced by animator Toyoo Ashida and the anime television series adaptation of his own _Dragon Ball_; from which he learned that separating colors instead of blending them makes the art cleaner and coloring illustrations easier.[62] It was Toriyama's sound effects in _Mysterious Rain Jack_ that caught the eye of Kazuhiko Torishima, who explained that usually they are written in _katakana_, but Toriyama used the Roman alphabet which he found refreshing.[63] In his opinion, Torishima stated that Toriyama excels in black and white, utilizing black areas, as a result of not having had the money to buy screentone when he started drawing manga.[64] He also described Toriyama as a master of convenience and "sloppy, but in a good way". For instance, in _Dragon Ball_, destroying scenery in the environment and giving Super Saiyans blonde hair were done in order to have less work in inking and drawing. Torishima claimed that Toriyama draws what he finds interesting and is not mindful of what his readers think.[65]

_Dr. Slump_ is mainly a comedy series, filled with puns, toilet humor and sexual innuendos. But it also contained many science fiction elements; aliens, anthropomorphic characters, time travel, and parodies of works such as Godzilla, _Star Wars_ and _Star Trek_.[66] Toriyama also included many real-life people in the series, such as his assistants, wife and colleagues (such as Masakazu Katsura), but most notably his editor Kazuhiko Torishima as the series' main antagonist, Dr. Mashirito.[67][68] A running gag in _Dr. Slump_ that utilizes feces has been reported as an inspiration for the Pile of Poo emoji.[69][70]

When _Dragon Ball_ began, it was loosely based on the classic Chinese novel _Journey to the West_,[71][72] with Goku being Sun Wukong and Bulma as Tang Sanzang. It was also inspired by Hong Kong martial arts films,[73] particularly those of Jackie Chan,[74] and was set in a fictional world based on Asia, taking inspiration from several Asian cultures including Japanese, Chinese, South Asian, Central Asian and Arabic cultures.[75] Toriyama continued to use his characteristic comedic style in the beginning, but over the course of time this slowly changed, with him turning the series into a "nearly-pure fighting manga" later on.[76] He did not plan out in advance what would happen in the series, instead choosing to draw as he went. This, coupled with him simply forgetting things he had already drawn, caused him to find himself in situations that he had to write himself out of.[77] In a rare 2013 interview, commenting on _Dragon Ball_'s global success, Toriyama admitted, "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy."[78]

Toriyama was commissioned to illustrate the characters and monsters for the first _Dragon Quest_ video game (1986) in order to separate it from other role-playing games of the time.[79] He has since worked on every title in the series. For each game Yuji Horii first sends rough sketches of the characters with their background information to Toriyama, who then re-draws them. Lastly, Horii approves the finished work.[80][81] Toriyama explained in 1995 that for video games, because the sprites are so small, as long as they have a distinguishing feature so people can tell which character it is, he can make complex designs without concern of having to reproduce it like he usually would in manga.[82] Besides the character and monster designs, Toriyama also does the games' packaging art and, for _Dragon Quest VIII_, the boats and ships.[83] In 2016, Toriyama revealed that because of the series' established time period and setting, his artistic options are limited, which makes every iteration harder to design for than the last.[84] The series' Slime character, which has become a sort of mascot for the franchise, is considered to be one of the most recognizable figures in gaming.[85]

Manga critic Jason Thompson declared Toriyama's art influential, saying that his "extremely personal and recognizable style" was a reason for _Dragon Ball_'s popularity.[86] He points out that the popular _shōnen_ manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s had "manly" heroes, such as _City Hunter_ and _Fist of the North Star_, whereas _Dragon Ball_ starred the cartoonish and small Goku, thus starting a trend that Thompson says continues to this day.[87] Toriyama himself said he went against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, designing many of the series' most powerful characters with small statures.[88] Thompson concluded his analysis by saying that only Akira Toriyama drew like this at the time and that _Dragon Ball_ is "an action manga drawn by a gag manga artist."[89] However, James S. Yadao, author of _The Rough Guide to Manga_, points out that an art shift does occur in the series, as the characters gradually "lose the rounded, innocent look that [Toriyama] established in _Dr. Slump_ and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensity."[90]


Legacy and accolades

Thompson stated in 2011 that "_Dragon Ball_ is by far the most influential shonen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every _Shōnen Jump_ artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways."[91] David Brothers for ComicsAlliance wrote that: "Like Osamu Tezuka and Jack Kirby before him, Toriyama created a story with his own two hands that seeped deep into the hearts of his readers, creating a love for both the cast and the medium at the same time."[92] Many artists have named Toriyama and _Dragon Ball_ as influences, including _One Piece_ author Eiichiro Oda,[93] _Naruto_ creator Masashi Kishimoto,[94] _Fairy Tail_ and _Rave_ author Hiro Mashima,[95] _Boruto: Naruto Next Generations_ illustrator Mikio Ikemoto,[96] _Venus Versus Virus_ author Atsushi Suzumi,[97] _Bleach_ creator Tite Kubo, _Black Cat_ author Kentaro Yabuki, and _Mr. Fullswing_ author Shinya Suzuki.[98] German comic book artist Hans Steinbach was strongly influenced by Toriyama,[99] and Thai cartoonist Wisut Ponnimit cited Toriyama as one of his favorite cartoonists.[100] Ian Jones-Quartey, a producer of the American animated series _Steven Universe_, is a fan of both _Dragon Ball_ and _Dr. Slump_, and uses Toriyama's vehicle designs as reference for his own. He also stated that "We're all big Toriyama fans on [_Steven Universe_], which kind of shows a bit."[101]

In 2008, Oricon conducted a poll of people's favorite manga artists, with Toriyama coming in second, behind only _Nana_ author Ai Yazawa. However, he was number one among male respondents and among those over 30 years of age.[102] They held a poll on the Mangaka that Changed the History of Manga in 2010, _mangaka_ being the Japanese word for a manga artist. Toriyama came in second, after only Osamu Tezuka, due to his works being highly influential and popular worldwide.[103] Toriyama won the Special 40th Anniversary Festival Award at the 2013 Angoulême International Comics Festival, honoring his years in cartooning.[104][105] He actually received the most votes for the festival's Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême award that year; however, the selection committee chose Willem as the recipient.[106] Toriyama was decorated a _Chevalier_ or "Knight" of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government on May 30, 2019 for his contributions to the arts.[107][108] He was also a 2019 nominee for entry into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame.[109] Due to his video game design work, IGN named Toriyama number 74 on their list of the Top 100 Game Creators of All Time.[110]
