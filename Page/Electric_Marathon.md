The first Electric Marathon became the symbolic restoration of the traditions of Star Race rally Tallinn – Monte Carlo,[2] that took place between 1930 and 1939. The idea of the marathon belongs to Prince Albert II of Monaco and Honorary Consul of Estonia Juri Tamm. As a result, the rally was reborn in new format and became the race for electric and hybrid vehicles.
