MARJORIE "MARGIE" HENDRIX (March 13, 1935 â€“ July 14, 1973)[1] was an American rhythm and blues singer best known for her performances as a founder member and leader of the Raelettes, backing Ray Charles, the father of her child. The spelling "Hendricks" is sometimes used.


Biography

Margie was born on March 13, 1935 in Register, Georgia, the daughter of Kattie and Renzy Hendrix.[2] She sang, played piano and directed her local church choir while in her teens. In the early 1950s she moved to New York City, and made her first recording, "Everything", on the Lamp label in 1954. In 1956, she replaced Beulah Robertson in the Cookies, joining existing members Dorothy Jones and Darlene McCrea. The group signed to Atlantic Records, and had a #9 hit on the R&B chart with "In Paradise". They also started working as session singers at Atlantic, where they were introduced to Ray Charles. The Cookies auditioned for Charles on the song "Leave My Woman Alone". In 1958, Hendrix and McCrea left the Cookies (who later went on to greater success with a different line-up), and formed the Raelettes as Ray Charles' backing singers.[3]

In 1958, Charles recorded "Night Time Is the Right Time", which reached #5 on the R&B chart the following year. The song featured Hendrix's barely controlled pleas to the singer to "tease me, squeeze me, please me, oh don't leave me...".[4] Hendrix was featured on Charles' other recordings of the time, including "Tell the Truth", "What'd I Say", "Sticks And Stones", "Hit the Road Jack", "Unchain My Heart", "I Can't Stop Loving You", "Bye Bye Love, and "You Are My Sunshine" . She developed a close personal as well as a professional relationship with Ray Charles; their son Charles Wayne was born on October 1, 1959 in New York City.[5][6]

Hendrix became the effective leader of the Raelettes, but her personal relationship with Ray Charles deteriorated and she (like him) developed problems of drug addiction to alcohol and heroin. In 1964, a final argument with Charles led to her being fired from the Raelettes.[7] After recording a solo single on Charles' Tangerine label in 1964, she signed with Mercury Records, and released five singles on the label, mostly produced by Gene "Bowlegs" Miller. The first two singles on Mercury were released in 1965 ("Now The Hurts On You" and "Baby") and three followed two years later in 1967 ("Restless", "Nothin' But A Tramp" and "One Room Paradise"). Her final recordings were issued on the Sound Stage 7 label in 1969.[8] Hendrix died in obscure circumstances in New York City on July 14, 1973, aged 38; sources said her death was due to a heroin overdose.[9][10]
