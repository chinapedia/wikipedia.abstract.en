(formerly _Kakutō karate_ (格闘空手); often _Daidōjuku_) is a Japanese hybrid martial art. It is full-contact mixed combat sport with head Guard and gloves, throwing and grappling techniques are also allowed in the competition, including restraint, locks and strangle holds. It can be called a mixed martial art with protective gear for the head.[1]

The goal of Kūdō is to come as close as possible to realistic, real fighting, with appropriate protective clothing. To achieve this, Kūdō is fought with very few regulations, and has specialised techniques and actions. The techniques of Kūdō include the entire spectrum of a real struggle-fighting standing up, throwing techniques, grappling and ground fighting.

The training of Kūdō consists primarily of kihon, general fitness training and combat. The kata of Kyokushin were eliminated without replacement.

Kūdō is a comprehensive martial art and philosophy, in which both the physical as well as mental development are considered. Traditional Japanese etiquette Budo (as Reigi) is followed, there are certain Japanese greeting ritual, a traditional training keikogi is worn, the names of the techniques are in Japanese, etc. KIF_Affiliated_Countries_&_Aspirants_(2011-10-31).png Kūdō is practised in more than 52 countries, with the largest representation in Russia.


Takashi Azuma

Azuma_Takashi.jpg (born 1949 in Kesennuma, Japan) is the founder of Kūdō[2][3] and the President of the Kudo International Federation. He currently holds an 9th degree black belt in Kyokushin Budokai (awarded by Jon Bluming), a 3rd degree black belt in judo, and a 9th degree black belt in Kūdō.

Azuma came in contact with budo for the first time when he entered the judo club of his school in Kesennuma at the age of 16 in 1965. In 1972 after his service in the Japanese armed forces, he joined Kyokushin Karate. That same year he founded a Kyokushin dan at Waseda University.[4]

In 1981, Azuma founded his own martial art because he was unhappy with some characteristics of Kyokushin. Azuma was bothered that in Kyokushin serious head injuries are common. Azuma was also of the opinion that physically smaller fighters are at a disadvantage compared to bigger fighters.

Azuma's own development of a martial art was first a hybrid of Kyokushin Karate and Judo. Kyokushin was the basis, however, the regulations changed dramatically. Protective clothing was introduced, which allowed hand techniques to the head, and provides sufficient protection to the head during kicking techniques. Selected techniques of grappling and ground combat have been added from judo. Later, more martial arts and combat sports were analyzed and added, primarily techniques of Muay Thai and jujutsu.
