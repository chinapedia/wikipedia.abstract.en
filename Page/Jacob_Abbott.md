JACOB ABBOTT (November 14, 1803 – October 31, 1879) was an American writer of children's books.[1]


Early life

On November 14, 1803, Abbot was born in Hallowell, Maine. Abbot's father was Jacob Abbot and his mother was Betsey Abbot. [2] Abbot attended the Hallowell Academy. [3]


Education

Abbott graduated from Bowdoin College in 1820. At some point during his years there, he supposedly added the second "t" to his surname, to avoid being "Jacob Abbot the 3rd" (although one source notes he did not actually begin signing his name with two t's until several years later).[4]

Abbott studied at Andover Theological Seminary in 1821, 1822, and 1824. Abbott was tutor in 1824–1825.


Career

From 1825 to 1829 was professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at Amherst College;[5] was licensed to preach by the Hampshire Association in 1826; founded the Mount Vernon School for Young Ladies in Boston in 1829, and was principal of it in 1829–1833;[6] was pastor of Eliot Congregational Church (which he founded), at Roxbury, Massachusetts in 1834–1835; and was, with his brothers, a founder, and in 1843–1851 a principal of Abbott's Institute, and in 1845–1848 of the Mount Vernon School for Boys, in New York City.

He was a prolific author, writing juvenile fiction, brief histories, biographies, religious books for the general reader, and a few works in popular science. He wrote 180 books and was a coauthor or editor of 31 more.[7] He died in Farmington, Maine, where he had spent part of his time after 1839, and where his brother, Samuel Phillips Abbott, founded the Abbott School.

His _Rollo Books_, such as _Rollo at Work, Rollo at Play, Rollo in Europe_, etc., are the best known of his writings, having as their chief characters a representative boy and his associates. In them Abbott did for one or two generations of young American readers a service not unlike that performed earlier, in England and America, by the authors of _Evenings at Home_, _The History of Sandford and Merton_, and _The Parent's Assistant_. To follow up his Rollo books, he wrote of _Uncle George_, using him to teach the young readers about ethics, geography, history, and science. He also wrote 22 volumes of biographical histories and a 10 volume set titled the _Franconia Stories_.[8]

Other works of note: _Lucy Books_, _Jonas Books_, _Harper's Story Books_, _Marco Paul_, _Gay Family_, and _Juno Books_.
