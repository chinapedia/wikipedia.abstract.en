Geology

Bichnakandi is a quarry spot that is used to collect rocks from the riverbed.[4] It is the place where many layers of the Khasi mountains from both sides meet at one point. Fountains from the Khasi mountains make a lake that is connected to Piyain River. The rocks are also natural and come down with water streams from the mountains. It is one of the most visited tourist spots in Bangladesh. This place is alongside Bangladesh-India border and has two tectonic plates on the verge of colliding. Geologist also have proved that these kinds of places in Earth have a high rate of earthquakes. Same can be told for Jaflong, Lalakhal, the entire Manipur estate in India, and San Andreas Fault.[5]
