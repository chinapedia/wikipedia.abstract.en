Biography

Millia Davenport was born March 30, 1895, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to biologists Charles and Gertrude Davenport, who became leaders of the American eugenics movement.[2] She studied in Paris as a teenager, returning to New York where she graduated from Huntington High School in 1913 and attended Barnard College from 1913 to 1915.[3] She studied at the Parsons School of Design from 1917 to 1918, and later taught there.[4]

She married editor Arthur Harold Moss in her early twenties and for a time was editor and publisher of _The Quill_, a Greenwich Village literary magazine.

In the 1920s she married Walter Louis Fleisher, and in the late 1930s married a third time to physician Edward Harkevy. In 1947 she declined an offer from Orson Welles to design costumes for his film production of _Macbeth_ in order to focus on her academic research, culminating in _The Book of Costume_.[5]

In the early 1960s she founded and cataloged the library of the American Museum of Folk Art.[6]

In 1981 Davenport received the highest honor given by the United States Institute for Theatre Technology, for a lifetime of distinguished contribution to the performing arts.[7] That same year she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Parsons School of Design.[8]

She died January 18, 1992,[9] aged 96, at a nursing home minutes away from her longtime home in New City, New York, which she designed and built.[10]


Legacy

In 1991 the Costume Society of America established the Millia Davenport Publication Award recognizing excellence in costume scholarship.[11]
