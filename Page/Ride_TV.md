Carriage

Verizon was the first major provider to announce a carriage agreement in December 2014[2]. However, Verizon would not actually carry the channel for almost two years, finally adding the network in November 2016 only as an A la carte offering. Dish Network added RIDE TV in 2015 as part of the "America's top 250" package[3]. Century Link Prism TV added RIDE TV in spring of 2016 as part of an add-on sports package[4].

RIDE TV is currently available on DISH Network and DISH Latino (248HD), Armstrong (235HD/489SD), Windstream Communications (1674HD/674SD), Century Link (1669HD/669SD), Google Fiber (254HD), CalTel Communications (596HD/96SD), Jefferson County Cable (140HD/50SD), Layer3 TV (272HD), Shentel (370HD), FiOS by Verizon (635HD), Grupo TVCable (297HD), and Viking Broadband (19SD) subscribers.[5] It was added to the "Heartland Extra" add-on through Sling TV on November 1, 2017.[6]
