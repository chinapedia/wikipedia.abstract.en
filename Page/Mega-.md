MEGA is a unit prefix in metric systems of units denoting a factor of one million (10⁶ or {{gaps). It has the unit symbol M. It was confirmed for use in the International System of Units (SI) in 1960. _Mega_ comes from .[1]


Common examples of usage

-   Megapixel: 1 million pixels in a digital camera
-   One megatonne of TNT equivalent amounts to approx. 4 petajoules and is the approximate energy released on igniting one million tonnes of TNT. The unit is often used in measuring the explosive power of nuclear weapons.
-   Megahertz: frequency of electromagnetic radiation for radio and television broadcasting, GSM, etc. 1 MHz = 1,000,000 Hz.
-   Megabyte: unit of information equal to one million bytes (SI standard).
-   Megawatt: equal to one million watts of power. It is commonly used to measure the output of power plants, as well as the power consumption of electric locomotives, data centers, and other entities that heavily consume electricity.
-   Megadeath: (or megacorpse) is one million human deaths, usually caused by a nuclear explosion. The term was used by scientists and thinkers who strategized likely outcomes of all-out nuclear warfare.


Exponentiation

When units occur in exponentiation, such as in square and cubic forms, any multiples-prefix is considered part of the unit, and thus included in the exponentiation.

-   1 Mm² means one square megametre or the size of a square of by or , and not (10⁶ m²).
-   1 Mm³ means one cubic megametre or the size of a cube of by by or 10¹⁸ m³, and not (10⁶ m³)


Computing

In some fields of computing, _mega_ may sometimes denote 1,048,576 (2²⁰) of information units, for example, a megabyte, a megaword, but denotes (10⁶) units of other quantities, for example, transfer rates: = . The prefix _mebi-_ has been suggested as a prefix for 2²⁰ to avoid ambiguity.
