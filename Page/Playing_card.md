A PLAYING CARD is a piece of specially prepared heavy paper, thin cardboard, plastic-coated paper, cotton-paper blend, or thin plastic that is marked with distinguishing motifs and usually used as one of a set for playing card games, performing magic tricks and flourishes, for cardistry, and in card throwing. Playing cards are typically palm-sized for convenient handling, and usually are sold together as a DECK OF CARDS or PACK OF CARDS.

Playing cards were first invented in China during the Tang dynasty.[1]


History

China

Playing cards may have been invented during the Tang dynasty around the 9th century AD as a result of the usage of woodblock printing technology.[2][3][4][5][6] The first possible reference to card games comes from a 9th-century text known as the _Collection of Miscellanea at Duyang_, written by Tang dynasty writer Su E. It describes Princess Tongchang, daughter of Emperor Yizong of Tang, playing the "leaf game" in 868 with members of the Wei clan, the family of the princess' husband.[7][8][9] The first known book on the "leaf" game was called the _Yezi Gexi_ and allegedly written by a Tang woman. It received commentary by writers of subsequent dynasties.[10] The Song dynasty (960–1279) scholar Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) asserts that the "leaf" game existed at least since the mid-Tang dynasty and associated its invention with the development of printed sheets as a writing medium.[11][12] However, Ouyang also claims that the "leaves" were pages of a book used in a board game played with dice, and that the rules of the game were lost by 1067.[13]

Other games revolving around alcoholic drinking involved using playing cards of a sort from the Tang dynasty onward. However, these cards did not contain suits or numbers. Instead, they were printed with instructions or forfeits for whomever drew them.[14]

The earliest dated instance of a game involving cards with suits and numerals occurred on 17 July 1294 when "Yan Sengzhu and Zheng Pig-Dog were caught playing cards [zhi pai] and that wood blocks for printing them had been impounded, together with nine of the actual cards."[15]

William Henry Wilkinson suggests that the first cards may have been actual paper currency which doubled as both the tools of gaming and the stakes being played for,[16] similar to trading card games. Using paper money was inconvenient and risky so they were substituted by play money known as "money cards". One of the earliest games in which we know the rules is _madiao_, a trick-taking game, which dates to the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). 15th-century scholar Lu Rong described it is as being played with 38 "money cards" divided into four suits: 9 in coins, 9 in strings of coins (which may have been misinterpreted as sticks from crude drawings), 9 in myriads (of coins or of strings), and 11 in tens of myriads (a myriad is 10,000). The two latter suits had _Water Margin_ characters instead of pips on them[17] with Chinese characters to mark their rank and suit. The suit of coins is in reverse order with 9 of coins being the lowest going up to 1 of coins as the high card.[18]

Persia and Arabia

Despite the wide variety of patterns, the suits show a uniformity of structure. Every suit contains twelve cards with the top two usually being the court cards of king and vizier and the bottom ten being pip cards. Half the suits use reverse ranking for their pip cards. There are many motifs for the suit pips but some include coins, clubs, jugs, and swords which resemble later Mamluk and Latin suits. Michael Dummett speculated that Mamluk cards may have descended from an earlier deck which consisted of 48 cards divided into four suits each with ten pip cards and two court cards.[19]

Egypt

By the 11th century, playing cards were spreading throughout the Asian continent and later came into Egypt.[20] The oldest surviving cards in the world are four fragments found in the Keir Collection and one in the Benaki Museum. They are dated to the 12th and 13th centuries (late Fatimid, Ayyubid, and early Mamluk periods).[21]

A near complete pack of Mamluk playing cards dating to the 15th century and of similar appearance to the fragments above was discovered by Leo Aryeh Mayer in the Topkapı Palace, Istanbul, in 1939.[22] It is not a complete set and is actually composed of three different packs, probably to replace missing cards.[23] The Topkapı pack originally contained 52 cards comprising four suits: polo-sticks, coins, swords, and cups. Each suit contained ten pip cards and three court cards, called _malik_ (king), _nā'ib malik_ (viceroy or deputy king), and _thānī nā'ib_ (second or under-deputy). The _thānī nā'ib_ is a non-existent title so it may not have been in the earliest versions; without this rank, the Mamluk suits would structurally be the same as a Ganjifa suit. In fact, the word "Kanjifah" appears in Arabic on the king of swords and is still used in parts of the Middle East to describe modern playing cards. Influence from further east can explain why the Mamluks, most of whom were Central Asian Turkic Kipchaks, called their cups _tuman_ which means myriad in Turkic, Mongolian and Jurchen languages.[24] Wilkinson postulated that the cups may have been derived from inverting the Chinese and Jurchen ideogram for myriad ().

The Mamluk court cards showed abstract designs or calligraphy not depicting persons possibly due to religious proscription in Sunni Islam, though they did bear the ranks on the cards. _Nā'ib_ would be borrowed into French (_nahipi_), Italian (_naibi_), and Spanish (_naipes_), the latter word still in common usage. Panels on the pip cards in two suits show they had a reverse ranking, a feature found in madiao, _ganjifa_, and old European card games like ombre, tarot, and maw.[25]

A fragment of two uncut sheets of Moorish-styled cards of a similar but plainer style were found in Spain and dated to the early 15th century.[26]

Export of these cards (from Cairo, Alexandria, and Damascus), ceased after the fall of the Mamluks in the 16th century.[27] The rules to play these games are lost but they are believed to be plain trick games without trumps.[28]

Spread across Europe and early design changes

Four-suited playing cards are first attested in Southern Europe in 1365,[29] and are likely derived from the Mamluk suits of cups, coins, swords, and polo-sticks, which are still used in traditional Latin decks.[30] As polo was an obscure sport to Europeans then, the polo-sticks became batons or cudgels.[31] Their presence is attested in Catalonia in 1371, 1377 in Switzerland, and 1380 in many locations including Florence and Paris.[32][33][34] Wide use of playing cards in Europe can, with some certainty, be traced from 1377 onward.[35]

In the account books of Johanna, Duchess of Brabant and Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg, an entry dated May 14, 1379 reads: "Given to Monsieur and Madame four peters, two forms, value eight and a half moutons, wherewith to buy a pack of cards". In his book of accounts for 1392 or 1393, Charles or Charbot Poupart, treasurer of the household of Charles VI of France, records payment for the painting of three sets of cards.[36]

From about 1418 to 1450[37] professional card makers in Ulm, Nuremberg, and Augsburg created printed decks. Playing cards even competed with devotional images as the most common uses for woodcuts in this period. This new popularity caused some 15th century religious leaders to begin denouncing playing cards, along with throwing dice, as an extension of gambling.[38] Most early woodcuts of all types were coloured after printing, either by hand or, from about 1450 onwards, stencils. These 15th-century playing cards were probably painted. The Flemish Hunting Deck, held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art is the oldest complete set of ordinary playing cards made in Europe from the 15th century.[39]

As cards spread from Italy to Germanic countries, the Latin suits were replaced with the suits of leaves (or shields), hearts (or roses), bells, and acorns, and a combination of Latin and Germanic suit pictures and names resulted in the French suits of (clovers), (tiles), (hearts), and (pikes) around 1480. The _trèfle_ (clover) was probably derived from the acorn and the (pike) from the leaf of the German suits. The names and _spade_, however, may have derived from the sword () of the Italian suits.[40] In England, the French suits were eventually used, although the earliest packs circulating may have had Latin suits.[41] This may account for why the English called the clovers "clubs" and the pikes "spades".

In the late 14th century, Europeans changed the Mamluk court cards to represent European royalty and attendants. In a description from 1377, the earliest courts were originally a seated "king", an upper marshal that held his suit symbol up, and a lower marshal that held it down.[42][43] The latter two correspond with the _ober_ and _unter_ cards found in German and Swiss playing cards. The Italians and Iberians replaced the / system with the "Knight" and "{{lang before 1390, perhaps to make the cards more visually distinguishable. In England, the lowest court card was called the "knave" which originally meant _male child_ (compare German ), so in this context the character could represent the "prince", son to the king and queen; the meaning _servant_ developed later.[44][45] Queens appeared sporadically in packs as early as 1377, especially in Germany. Although the Germans abandoned the queen before the 1500s, the French permanently picked it up and placed it under the king. Packs of 56 cards containing in each suit a king, queen, knight, and knave (as in tarot) were once common in the 15th century.

During the mid 16th century, Portuguese traders introduced playing cards to Japan. The first indigenous Japanese deck was the named after the [[Tenshō_(Momoyama_period)|
