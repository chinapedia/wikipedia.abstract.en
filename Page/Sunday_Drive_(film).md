Plot

Two drivers with identical cars unwittingly take each other's vehicle while at a restaurant – one belonging to a childless couple, Bill and Joan, out on a Sunday drive with their niece and nephew (Christine and John) while their parents are away – and the other car belonging to Paul Sheridan, a young man on his way to meet his fiancé and to begin working for her father.

In Paul's car is his dog, whom Bill and Joan mistake for the children when they get into his car and drive away; and while Paul goes into their car, the children are under a blanket and he mistakenly assumes it's his dog. But when each driver eventually discovers their mistake, everyone has a hassle trying to get back together.[1]
