The 2017 CLEVELAND BROWNS SEASON was the franchise's 69th as a professional sports franchise, their 65th season as a member of the National Football League, their second under head coach Hue Jackson and their second and final season under general manager Sashi Brown.

The Browns failed to improve upon their 1–15 record from the previous season, losing all sixteen games in 2017 and continuing a losing streak dating to the final game of the previous season. They became the second team in NFL history to go 0–16 after the 2008 Detroit Lions. The Browns became the twelfth NFL team to have gone winless playing eight games or more and the fourth since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970.

In going 0–16, the Browns became the first franchise in NFL history to have multiple seasons with 15 or more losses and the first to start consecutive seasons with at least 14 losses. They were mathematically eliminated from the AFC North title contention in Week 11, extending an active NFL record drought of 25 consecutive seasons without a division title. They were then eliminated from playoff contention in Week 12, extending their franchise record playoff drought to 15 consecutive seasons. With the Buffalo Bills qualifying for the postseason for the first time since 1999, the Browns now have the longest postseason drought in the NFL and the second longest in the four major American sports leagues, only behind the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball.

The Browns finished the season with a losing record for the tenth consecutive season, extending a franchise record. It was the first season in which the team lost every home game since 1999. The Browns also extended their road losing streak to 21 games and their losing streak within the division to 17 games, both date back to the 2015 season. A Week 13 loss moved the Browns to 1–27 in their first 28 games under Jackson, surpassing the 1976–77 Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the worst 28 game start (2–26) for a regime in NFL history. The Browns finished the 2017 season with a combined record of 1–31 over the previous two seasons, an NFL record for worst winning percentage over any two season span. After starting 2014 with a 6–3 record heading into Week 11, the Browns went 5–50 in the 55 games between that point and the end of this season.

On December 7, Brown was relieved of his duties as executive vice president. John Dorsey, formerly of the Kansas City Chiefs, was hired as general manager the same day.[1] To further add to these failures, offensive tackle Joe Thomas missed the Pro Bowl for the first time in his career, as he tore his left triceps on October 22, ending his season. Before his injury, Thomas had not missed a single snap since joining the league in 2007, a total of 10,363 plays.[2] He then decided to retire on March 14, 2018 following the season.

The season saw the Browns play in London for the first time in franchise history, where they lost to the Minnesota Vikings 33–16 on October 29.

On January 10, the Browns fired five assistant coaches: offensive line coach Hal Hunter, inside linebackers coach Johnny Holland, outside linebackers coach Ryan Slowik, defensive backs coach Louie Cioffi, and assistant defensive backs coach Cannon Matthews.[5]

On January 13, the Browns hired DeWayne Walker as defensive backs coach. A day later, they hired Blake Williams as linebackers coach, Jerod Kruse as assistant defensive backs coach, and Bob Wylie as offensive line coach.[6]

Game summaries

Week 1: vs. Pittsburgh Steelers

The Browns dropped their 13th consecutive season-opening game with a 21–18 loss to the Steelers.[46]

The scoring began early in the first quarter when Pittsburgh's Tyler Matakevich blocked a Britton Colquitt punt, knocking the ball into the end zone where it was recovered by Anthony Chickillo for a touchdown.[47] The Browns were able to tie the score by the end of the first quarter, however, as rookie quarterback DeShone Kizer orchestrated a 12-play drive that ended when he scored on a 1-yard touchdown run.[48]

The game stayed at 7–7 through most of the second quarter, until the Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger connected with tight end Jesse James on a 4-yard touchdown with 45 seconds left in the first half. The 7–play, 91-yard scoring drive was highlighted by a 50-yard reception by Antonio Brown on a tipped ball.[49]

After a Zane Gonzalez field goal brought the Browns within 14–10 early in the third quarter, the Steelers drove down the field again. Roethlisberger threw a second touchdown pass to James to put them up by 11, 21–10. The drive was boosted by a 41-yard pass interference penalty on Browns cornerback Jamar Taylor on a deep pass intended for Brown.[50]

The score remained 21–10 until under four minutes remained in the game, when Kizer was able to throw his first career touchdown pass to Corey Coleman. A two–point conversion run by Isaiah Crowell brought the Browns to within a field goal, 21–18.[51]

The Browns did not get a chance to score again, however, as the Steelers were able to run out the clock after a long pass from Roethlisberger to Brown. Browns head coach Hue Jackson challenged the ruling; however, the catch call on the field was upheld.[52]

With their 13th straight season–opening loss, which extended an NFL record, the Browns started 0–1. The Browns also lost their 12th straight game against a divisional opponent.[53]

Week 2: at Baltimore Ravens

After losing at home, the Browns traveled to Baltimore to play the Ravens. The Ravens scored the only points of the first quarter when Terrence West ran for a 4-yard touchdown to make it 7-0. They made it 14-0 in the second quarter when Javorius Allen caught a 9-yard pass from Joe Flacco. The Browns got on the board when Kevin Hogan found David Njoku on a 23-yard pass to make it 14-7. The Ravens then moved up by 2 touchdowns at halftime when Flacco found Jeremy Maclin on a 2-yard pass to make it 21-7. In the third quarter, the Browns drew closer when Zane Gonzalez kicked a 38-yard field goal to make it 21-10. In the fourth quarter, the Ravens sealed the game with a field goal of their own: Justin Tucker kicked it from 28 yards out to make the final score 24-10.

With the loss, the Browns fell to 0–2. Ravens QB, Joe Flacco, improved to 16–2 against the Browns for his career while the Browns lost their 14th straight road game.

Week 17: at Pittsburgh Steelers

In one last effort to avoid a 0-16 season, the Browns played their final regular season game against their divisional rivals the Pittsburgh Steelers at Heinz Field. The Browns were competitive throughout the game due to the Steelers, who had been effectively locked into the #2 seed in the playoffs, resting most of their starters. The Steelers took an early lead in the first quarter when Darrius Heyward-Bey ran for a 29-yard run for a touchdown to make it 7-0. They made it 14-0 in the second quarter when Landry Jones found Juju Smith-Schuster for a 20-yard pass. The Browns then got on the board when Duke Johnson ran for a 2-yard touchdown to make it 14-7.

The Browns then came within 7 when DeShone Kizer found Rashard Higgins on a 56-yard pass to make it 21-14 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Browns managed to tie the game at 21-21 when Kizer and Higgins connected again on a 5-yard pass. The Steelers retook the lead when Smith-Schuster returned the ensuing kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown to make it 28-21. Zane Gonzalez then got the Browns within 4 with a 51-yard field goal to make it 28-24.

In a highly defensive fourth quarter, the Browns tried to rally a comeback and win. However, on 4th-and-2 with 1:46 left in the game, Browns receiver Corey Coleman dropped a wide open pass from Kizer at the Steelers' 11-yard line, giving the ball back to the Steelers on downs and sealing the Browns' fate.

With the loss, the Browns became the second team in NFL history to finish 0-16 after the 2008 Detroit Lions. Hue Jackson's career record with the Browns fell to 1-31, the worst 32-game record since the league adapted a 16-game schedule in 1978. The Browns tied their franchise record of 17 straight losses. It also was their 21st consecutive road loss, 17th consecutive loss against a divisional opponent, and 14th consecutive loss in Pittsburgh. The Browns lost 50 of 55 games between Week 10 of the 2014 season and the end of the 2017 season.

Later that afternoon, the Buffalo Bills' win over the Miami Dolphins - coupled with the Cincinnati Bengals win over the Baltimore Ravens - gave the Bills a playoff berth, ending their 17-year playoff drought. As a result, the Browns now hold the longest active postseason drought of any NFL team going back to 2002. This is the second longest playoff drought in the four major American sports, ahead of the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball who last made the playoffs in 2001.


2018 Pro Bowl

Despite the team's historically awful performance, LB Joe Schobert was named to the AFC team for the 2018 Pro Bowl.[55] This marked Schobert's first Pro Bowl Selection.

T Joe Thomas, who was injured during the season, was not selected for the Pro Bowl for the first and only time of his career. He retired after the season.


Aftermath and fan reaction

Perfect_Season_Parade_2.0_(39558172441).jpg A parade was held on January 6, 2018 at FirstEnergy Stadium in honor of the Browns' imperfect season and general ineptitude. It was organized by fan Chris McNeil through the contributions of fellow Browns fans and pain reliever manufacturer Excedrin.[56] The parade's route went in the shape of a circle, signifying the number zero.[57] Additionally, the parade organization raised over $17,000 of charitable donations which went to the Cleveland Food Bank.[58]
