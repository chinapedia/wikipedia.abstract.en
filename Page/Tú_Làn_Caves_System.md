Tú Làn Discovery 1

There are many caves in this limestone mountain area with stalagmites and stalactites, as well as underground rivers and waterfalls. Tu Lan Cave System comprises over 10 caves, some of which were originally discovered and explored in 1992, and some of which were just found in the past couple years.

Hang Ton (Ton cave), first found in 1992 and explored more in depth in 2012, appears first on the horizon on a trek to this intricate cave system.[2]

Geology of Tú Làn Cave System

Because the tectonic plates in this region are always moving and bumping into each other, the mountains are still rising and moving up. The rivers continue to cut into the bottom of the mountain, carving new caves over time. Hence, the river caves that are at a lower elevation are much younger than the higher, dry caves as they were more recently created. The river caves in this system such as Ken Cave and Tu Lan Cave are very young, only about 3 million years old. The higher, dry caves (dry Tu Lan and Ton Cave) are much older, and date around 5 million years old. The French scientist Pierre G commented:[4] "Tu Lan Cave System have the largest, deepest, longest, highest with many of connecting caves including inactive dry caves & active wet caves; including a number of natural phenomena such as the deepest Karst Doline of Southeast Asia (with a depth of more than 255m) and the habitat, stunning natural wonders, the majestic, unique of tropical jungle on the 400 million years of limestone."

One of the caves in the Tu Lan cave system, Ken Cave, even had its formations featured recently in National Geographic (The Top 10 Photographs of 2011[5]) by world renowned photographer Carsten Peter.[6]
