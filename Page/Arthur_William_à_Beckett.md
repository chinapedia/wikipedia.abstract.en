Arthur_William_à_Beckett_by_Harry_Furniss.jpg]] ARTHUR WILLIAM À BECKETT (25 October 1844 – 14 January 1909) was an English journalist and intellectual.


Biography

He was a younger son of Gilbert Abbott à Beckett and Mary Anne à Beckett, brother of Gilbert Arthur à Beckett and educated at Felsted School. Besides fulfilling other journalistic engagements, Beckett was on the staff of _Punch_ from 1874 to 1902, edited the _Sunday Times_ 1891-1895, and the _Naval and Military Magazine_ in 1896.

He gave an account of his father and his own reminiscences in _The à Becketts of Punch_ (1903).[1] A childhood friend (and distant relative) of W. S. Gilbert, Beckett briefly feuded with Gilbert in 1869, but the two patched up the friendship, and Gilbert even later collaborated on projects with Beckett's brother.[2]

He was married to Suzanne Frances Winslow, daughter of the noted psychiatrist Forbes Benignus Winslow.
