ALIENOPTERA is an extinct order of insects. It is part of Dictyoptera making it closely related to cockroaches and mantises. The majority of known members of the group are known from the Cenomanian aged amber from Myanmar;[1][2][3][4][5] however, the group also includes two genera (_Apiblatta_ and _Vcelesvab_) from the Albian Crato Formation (Brazil), as well as two genera (_Chimaeroblattina_ and _Grant_) from the middle Eocene Green River Formation (Colorado, United States).[6]

Vršanský _et al._ (2018) did not consider Alienoptera to be a separate insect order; instead, the authors assigned the family Alienopteridae to the order Blattaria and to the superfamily Umenocoleoidea.[7]
