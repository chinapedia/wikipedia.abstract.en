The is a group of large pumped-storage hydroelectric power plants and smaller conventional plants located in Toyota, Aichi Prefecture, and Ena, Gifu Prefecture, Japan. With a combined installed capacity of , it is among the largest pumped-storage power stations in Japan.

The facilities are run by the Chubu Electric Power Company. The station includes 4 distinct power plants. The first two power plants, Yahagi 1 and 2 are conventional power plants.[1][2] The other two plants, Okuyahagi 1 and 2 are pumped-storage plants. Yahagi 1 uses water from the Yahagi Dam (矢作ダム)[3] and has a capacity of 60 MW.[4] Yahagi 2 uses water from the Second Yahagi Dam (矢作第二ダム),[5] a smaller dam downstream of the main one, and has a capacity of 31.2 MW.

The pumped-storage station has an unconventional configuration, with three reservoirs at different heights.[6] The lower reservoir is created by Yahagi Dam on the Yahagi river. The upper reservoir is the Kuroda Dam lake, an artificial lake created by the Kuroda Dam. A third reservoir, in between the two at an intermediate elevation is formed by the Tominaga Dam. The two Okuyahagi power stations work in tandem between the three reservoirs.[7][8][9] This configuration was necessary because of the geological conditions in the area, with a fault that prevented the safe construction of a single connection between upper and lower reservoirs.[10] Okuyahagi 1 is the upper power plant, operating between the upper and the intermediate reservoir using 3 units with a combined capacity of 323 MW.[11] The first unit started operation in September 1980, while the second and third units became operational in February 1981. The Okuyahagi 2 is the lower power plant operating between the intermediate reservoir and the lower reservoir employing 3 units with a combined capacity of 780 MW.[12] Okuyahagi 2 became operational together with the first plant, with the first unit online in September 1980 and the other 2 in February 1981.[13] The two plants operate as a single power station.[14] Both station have a maximum water flow rate of 234 cubic meter per second.[15]
