_MONOCHAMUS URUSSOVI_ is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae. It was described by Fischer von Waldheim in 1806.[1] It has been recorded in Eastern and Northern Europe and Northern Asia.[2] It is a vector of the nematode _Bursaphelenchus mucronatus_.[3] Larvae burrow into the wood of various conifer species and can be a tree pest, as feeding damage reduces the value of the timber.[4]
