Griot-africa.jpg The _NYAMAKALA_, or _Nyamakalaw_, are the historic occupational castes among Islamic societies of West Africa, particularly among the Mandinka people.[1][2] The _Nyamakala_ are known as _NYAXAMALO_ among the Soninke people,[3][4] and _NYENYO_ among the Wolof people.[5] They are found throughout the Sahel region, from Mali and Senegal to Chad and Sudan.[6]

The term _Nyamakala_ originally implied any talented people, but as slavery, social differentiation and stratification increased with Islamic religious violence called jihads, and later the colonial rule, their status fell to a lowly level below the nobles and free people.[7] _Nyama_ in the traditional Mandinka society implies "vital force", while _Kala_ connotes "handle". Thus, any type of occupation that handled vital force of nature, were a Nyamakala.[8] In its historic contexts, state Charles Bird, Martha Kendall and Kalilou Tera, _Nyama_ has implied different meanings. In one, it connotes notions of "evil or satanic force, dangerous, polluting, energizing, imperfect self control" and in others it is "morally neutral or energizing". In yet another context, _Nyama_ implies "refuse, garbage".[9] With the arrival of Muslims, the evil or polluting contexts became their focus, while the caste people themselves preferred the neutral or energizing connotations.[10]

Among Mandinka, the _Nyamakala_ occupational castes included _Jeli_ or _Jeliyu_ (musicians, griots), _Numu_ (carpenters, smiths), _Garanke_ (leather workers, weavers) and _Fune_ or _Finah_ (singers specializing in Islamic praise).[11] The specific castes had different terms in other ethnic groups of West Africa. For example, among the Soninke people, the griots were called _Gesere_, the smiths _Tage_ and the carpenter caste was called _Sake_.[12]

The _Nyamakala_ have been endogamous, occupation inheriting castes.[13][14][15] Among the Mande people such as the Mandinke, Soninke and others, _Nyamakala_ caste people have been despised and considered of lowly status, in some regions as _Jon_ (slave) and _Wolosa_ (descendant of slave).[16][17]

Some scholars such as Vaughn state that while _Nyamakala_ have been castes of West Africa, it necessarily does not mean imply a generic and uniform "caste system" because the social stratification in Africa was very complex with the inclusion of slaves, race and religious elements.[18][19] Others consider _Nyamakala_ as a part of a caste system, while acknowledging that there were regional variations.[20][21][22]
