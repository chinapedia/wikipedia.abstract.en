Jean Dides engages as a police officer in 1940. Two years later, he was appointed by Lucien Rottée, director of RG (shot at the Liberation), Senior Inspector RG to the 5th section, responsible in particular for the repression of anti-Nazi foreign resistance. Dides has been following Nazi "new order" for four year. Then he creates, an association with 5,000 police officers : "Association of Distant Administration" in 1946.

We want the breakup of its unit, its resources, and if necessary its leaders. " CGT-Police is then purified by the Socialist Interior Minister Jules Moch: 800 police officers accused of sympathizing with the PCF are revoked, and 2200 mutated.[1]
