CANADA–VIETNAM RELATIONS refer to bilateral relations between Canada and Vietnam.

Ties were established in 1973. Canada has an embassy in Hanoi and a consulate general in Ho Chi Minh City. Vietnam has an embassy in Ottawa and a consulate general in Vancouver.[1] Canada has friendly relations with Vietnam, and Vietnam is confirmed as one of Canada's 25 countries to focus, although Canada is a major critic of Vietnam's authoritarian rule.


Education

In 2007, the Canadian embassy and consulate general in Vietnam launched a campaign to encourage young Vietnamese to study in Canada. In 2012, 3,400 Vietnamese students studied in Canada, an increase of 15.9% from 2011.

The Canada education week is held in Vietnam annually.[2]


Immigration

Canada, being one of the top migration destinations in the world, has attracted many immigrants from the Far East, Vietnam included. There are some 240,000 Canadian citizens of Vietnamese descent living in Canada, mostly refugees fleeing from Vietnam after 1975 to 1996.
