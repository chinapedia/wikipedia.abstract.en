Augusta_Jane_Evans_Wilson.jpg Elmo_kills_Murray.JPG _ST. ELMO_ is a novel by American author Augusta Jane Evans published in 1866. Featuring the sexual tension between the protagonist St. Elmo, a cynical man, and the heroine Edna Earl, a beautiful and devout girl, the novel became one of the most popular novels of the 19th century. The novel sold a million copies within four months of its publication.

Augusta Jane Evans (May 8, 1835 â€“ May 9, 1909) finished her celebrated novel at El Dorado, a historical home in Columbus, Georgia. In 1878, the home was purchased by Captain and Mrs. James J. Slade who changed its name to St. Elmo in honor of the novel which it had inspired.[1]


In popular culture

The novel _St. Elmo_ was frequently adapted for both the stage and screen. It inspired the naming of towns, hotels, steamboats, and a cigar brand. The book's heroine Edna Earl became the namesake of Eudora Welty's heroine (Edna Earle Ponder) in _The Ponder Heart_ published in 1954.

The novel also inspired a parody of itself called _St. Twel'mo, or the Cuneiform Cyclopedist of Chattanooga_ (1867) by Charles Henry Webb.[2]

A film and website on Augusta Evans Wilson entitled _The Passion of Miss Augusta_[3] was produced by Alabama filmmaker Robert Clem and aired on public television in 2016, the 150th anniversary of the publication of _St. Elmo._
