DOMINIQUE FORTIER (born 1972) is a Canadian novelist and translator from Quebec, who won the Governor General's Award for French-language fiction at the 2016 Governor General's Awards for her novel _Au péril de la mer_.[1]

A graduate of McGill University, she published her debut novel _Du bon usage des étoiles_ in 2008. That book was a shortlisted Governor General's Award finalist at the 2009 Governor General's Awards,[2] and its English translation by Sheila Fischman, _On the Proper Use of Stars_, was a finalist for the Governor General's Award for French to English translation at the 2010 Governor General's Awards. Her second novel _Les Larmes de Saint-Laurent_ was published in 2010, and its English translation by Fischman, _Wonder_, was a finalist for the translation award at the 2014 Governor General's Awards.

In 2014, Fortier and Nicolas Dickner published _Révolutions_, a collaborative project for which they each wrote a short piece each day for a year based on a word chosen from the French Republican Calendar.[3]

Fortier is also a three-time nominee for the Governor General's Award for English to French translation, garnering two nominations at the 2006 Governor General's Awards for her translations of Mark Abley's _Spoken Here: Travels Among Threatened Languages_ and David Suzuki and Wayne Grady's _Tree: A Life Story_,[4] and at the 2012 Governor General's Awards for her translation of Margaret Laurence's _The Prophet's Camel Bell_.[5]
