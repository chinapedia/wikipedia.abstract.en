MERCEDES-BENZ EQ is an upcoming family of battery electric vehicles to be manufactured by Mercedes-Benz. The first model was previewed at the Paris Motor Show in 2016 with the Generation EQ concept vehicle.[1] Mercedes-Benz intends to produce ten EQ models by 2022, three of which will have the Smart brand, representing between 15% and 25% of the company's global sales. All of Mercedes-Benz electric vehicle design and production efforts will target the EQ family.

Mercedes-Benz EQC, the first member of the EQ family, was presented at a special event in Stockholm.


Family

Mercedes-Benz intends to design and manufacture ten EQ models by 2022,[2] all of which will be based on a single platform developed specifically for electric drivetrains, and which can be configured for any type of vehicle owing to modularization.[3][4] Three models will have the Smart brand.[5]

Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler AG, stated that the new brand will consist of all Mercedes-Benz "electrification efforts", with a goal of having it represent between 15% and 25% of global sales for the company by 2025, dependent on "the continued development of infrastructure and customer preferences".[6] Jurgen Schenk, a director of Daimler who will oversee the development of the electric vehicle program, stated that the company expects energy density improvements to battery technology to be about 14% per year until 2025, equivalent to improvements seen between 2010 and 2016.[7]

To meet production targets, Daimler AG intends to invest €1 billion for capital expansion projects of its global battery production,[8][9] half of which will be dedicated to its Deutsche ACCUmotive subsidiary lithium-ion battery manufacturing facilities in Kamenz, Germany.[10] This is part of the company's investment of up to €10 billion for the design and development of electric vehicles.[11]

The vehicles will use the Combined Charging System,[12] a wall charger, or an optional wireless inductive charging system.

The EQC, the production version of the Generation EQ concept, is the first EQ model.[13] It was unveiled in Stockholm, Sweden on 4 September 2018. It is a compact sport utility vehicle (SUV) scheduled for release in 2019.[14]

An electric car "at the level" of the S-Class sedan, dubbed EQS, is scheduled for production around 2020 and will be the first EQ model based on the dedicated MEA (modular electric architecture) platform.[20][21] The EQE, a lower-ranking sedan more comparable to the C-Class is to be produced by 2022.[22] The EQE will be the second model to be based on the MEA electric car platform with a range of close to .[23] The GLB-based EQB subcompact crossover with a WLTP-estimated range of is schedule for 2021.[24] Another SUV next to the EQC will complete the ten all-electric EQ line-up.[25]

EQ hybrids

In addition to the EQ models, the EQ brand will be extended to the EQ Boost name being given to Mercedes-Benz models using the 48 volt mild hybrid system, while the third-generation of plug-in hybrids due from the end of 2018 will wear EQ Power badges.[27] The new system mates a nine-speed automatic with the electric motor and clutch in the same unit, promising both considerably longer range in electric mode (up to 49 km) and a slightly faster 140 km/h top speed.[28]


Trademark

In March 2017, Chinese automaker Chery filed a complaint with the Trademark Office of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce in China regarding the use of 'EQ', as Chery was using the name 'eQ' for an electric version of its QQ3 city car since 2015.[29] The dispute was resolved in July 2017, with Chery retaining the rights to use 'eQ' with numerical models and Mercedes-Benz to use 'EQ' with alphabetical models.[30]

Mercedes-Benz has trademarked the terms EQA, EQB, EQE, and EQS.[31]
