_PROLEPSIS_ is an insect genus of mainly neotropical Diptera in the family Asilidae or robber flies. Prolepsis_lucifer_male.jpg


Description

Medium-sized robber flies (14–25 mm) with antennae that have a relatively long third article. Abdomen is rather plump compared to many other asilids. Wings usually extending past the abdomen and often tinted or pigmented along most of their length. Coloration predominantly black to brown or reddish; often mimicking spider wasps. The two sexes can have distinctly different colors. Ventral side of the femur of the middle leg pair often with a thick patch of short and stout spines.[1]

Biology

As is typical for robber flies, adults of _Prolepsis_ species are ambush predators, taking off from a resting position on the ground or on branches to intercept other flying insects in mid-air. Prey are probably taken from a wide variety of insect orders: Robert Lavigne's Predator-Prey Database for the family Asilidae[2] has one record for _Prolepsis lucifer_ feeding on the dung beetle _Canthidium globulum_ and four records for _Prolepsis tristis_ feeding on the following identified prey species: the clown beetle _Epierus formidolosus_, the blister beetle _Epicauta trichrus_, the hoverfly _Eristalis dimidiatus_ and the Western honeybee _Apis mellifera_. Herschel Raney's webpage for _Prolepsis tristis_ includes example images of cannibalism and color variation among males. It also illustrates the extreme difference in coloration of both sexes that occurs in this particular species.[3]

Larval stages have received little study to date, but the first instar larvae of _P. lucifer_ are reported to prey voraciously on the subterranean scale insect or ground pearl _Eurhizococcus brasiliensis_, with possible biocontrol applications for protection of grapevines in Brazil[4][5]

Phylogeny

Combined analysis of morphological and molecular characters places _Prolepsis tristis_ in a clade corresponding to the subfamily Stenopogoninae, without however providing direct support for monophyly of this subfamily.[7]
