Description

_Eucalyptus calcareana_ is a mallee or a small tree that typically grows to a height of about and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth grey, cream-coloured, white and orange bark that is shed in short ribbons. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves arranged alternately and dull bluish green, egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, the same glossy green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are borne in groups of seven or nine in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to cylindrical, long and wide with a conical operculum long. Flowering mainly occurs in March and April and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped or conical capsule long and wide on a pedicel long, the valves just above of slightly below the rim.[2][3][4][5][6][7]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus calcareana_ was first formally described in 1979 by Clifford Boomsma from specimens collected near Nundroo.[8][9] The specific epithet (_calcareana_) is derived from the Latin word _calcareus_ meaning "of lime" or "limy"[10] referring to the soil type where this species grows.[11]


Distribution and habitat

Nundroo mallee is found along the south coast of the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia and the south coast of South Australia.[12] It is found from the east of Esperance to coastal areas of the western Eyre Peninsula.[13][14]


Use in horticulture

This eucalypt is grown in exposed locations and is suitable as a windbreak or shade tree.[15]
