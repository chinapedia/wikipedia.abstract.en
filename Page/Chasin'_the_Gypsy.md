_CHASIN' THE GYPSY_ is the sixth album by saxophonist James Carter which was released on the Atlantic label in 2000.[1]


Reception

The _Allmusic_ review by Richard S. Ginell says, "'' Chasin' the Gypsy'', as you might guess, is an homage to Django Reinhardt, whose music Carter used to dig on Detroit radio when he was a teenager, but Carter doesn't take the predictable reverent path in paying his respects ... this is a delightful departure for Carter, though probably destined to be a one-off excursion".[2] In _JazzTimes_ Bill Milkowski wrote, "Just when you had him pegged as a rip-snorting tenor and bari monster with a wicked penchant for ferocious overblowing, he comes across as a shameless romantic on _Chasin' the Gypsy_, his lovely ode to Django. Still, Carter's characteristic bravado, tenor squeals, trills and remarkable displays of multiphonics are still intact here".[3] On _All About Jazz_ Mark Corroto noted, "Carter’s Reinhardt tribute, while appealing to traditional jazz fans, also has something to say to the Downtown crowd".[4] Critic Robert Christgau rated the album an "A", saying, "this is the spirit marriage a tribute should be. It swings like a horse thief, parlays Fransay, and adores the melody".[5]
