CENSORSHIP IN BOLIVIA can be traced back through years of conflict between Bolivia’s indigenous population and the wealthier population of European descent.[1] Until Bolivia democratized in 1982, the media was strictly controlled.[2] Since Evo Morales was elected, censorship has increased throughout the years, being qualified as partially free by the freedom house, with a 53/100 score on freedom of press (0 the most free and 100 the least free). Evo Morales' government has since tried to control the media and regulate it in his favour. "In February 2016, voters rejected a referendum that would have permitted Morales to run for a fourth term. The vote was widely viewed as a rebuke to the president, who responded to it with an attempt to crack down on online media, which he appeared to blame for the referendum’s defeat. Soon after the vote, the government created the General Directorate of Social Networks, a body within the Ministry of Communications tasked with coordinating the government’s interactions with online communities. This mission involves efforts to disseminate government-friendly messages online and to engage with government critics on social media, often aggressively. Authorities also proposed a pair of measures that would have imposed greater regulation on online outlets, but they were never implemented. Additionally, in June, Bolivia joined 16 other countries including Venezuela and Cuba in rejecting a UN Human Rights Commission resolution affirming the right to a free, uncensored internet".[3]


Media

Film

Film and documentary makers in Bolivia and other Latin American countries struggle to make a living creating film, find a large enough audience for their movies, and make their movies impactful yet non-offensive.[4] In Bolivia and Argentina filmmakers have been forced to flee the country as a result of film and censorship laws.[5] In the extreme, documentary film makers in Bolivia have been arrested for defaming Morales in their films.[6]

Radio

Within Bolivia, powerful, wealthy families with connections to the country’s traditional political groups control the majority, around 80 percent, of radio stations although there are still a handful of stations run by local organizations, government, or other groups.[7][8] Independent community stations are about four percent of the total number of radio stations.[9][10] These stations are gaining popularity with Morales as an indigenous president and these stations are overall more popular within indigenous communities.[11] They have a history of serving as a way for marginalized communities to express their identity and dislike of dictators.[12] While legally people are free to talk and discuss any topic, awareness and acceptance of that is taking time to dissipate throughout communities.[13]

Newspapers

Historically, newspapers in Bolivia have been the root and voice of political opposition with the goal of challenging the current and past political leadership.[14] Yet there are many difficulties related to running a newspaper in Bolivia as challenging the political leadership does not lead to high levels of job security and a secure income. Journalists want better working conditions, job training, for media to be free an unrestrained by the government and financial considerations.[15] There is little advertising for newspapers partly because there is readership in a country with low literacy levels.[16] These newspapers have to be careful not to cross the line too much for fear of actions by the state.[17] This environment leads to journalists self-censoring and the proliferation of state run media that is biased towards current political leaders and their parties.[18] While there have been fewer attacks on journalists, there are still many cases that are waiting to work their way through the court system.[19][20] Gradual improvements in internet access will lead to new environments and opportunities for newspapers and media in Bolivia.[21][22][23]


Legal

Anti-racism law

As a result of historically racist communication between Bolivians of European descent and indigenous Bolivians, Morales created an anti-racism law that prevents against publishing racist media with the goal of protecting indigenous communities.[24] Critics of the law say that racism is poorly defined allowing the government to shut down media outlets that publish what the government loosely defines as racist material.[25] This vagueness means that the government is protecting one group of people while oppressing a different group, media outlets.[26] The elite are afraid that this law will result in them losing power and control.[27]

Social media monitoring

In the past couple of years, Morales has tweeted and talked about the possibility of censoring social media, but he was faced with strong opposition and proceeded to abandon the plan.[28] The idea of this stemmed from tweets that Morales saw as bullying or threatening to his reputation.[29] The opposition’s case was that there are many more possible opportunities for the government to utilize and embrace social media rather than censor it and be afraid of it.[30] They were also afraid that the proposed social media regulation law would resemble the anti-racism bill’s vague and broad language which has forced people to self-censor out of fear that what they were writing would be labeled as racist.[31]

Judicial role

Over the years as Evo Morales has become prone to censorship and controlling what people say, he has begun to use economic, legal, and political means to take out independent media.[32] While there is freedom of press in the constitution, Morales continues to act against his enemies.[33] Consistently the court system has been overturning charges and accusations put forth by Morales.[34][35]
