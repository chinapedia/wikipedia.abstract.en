After meeting at an event following the death of Michael Jackson in 2009, co-Founders Staci Lawrence and Conroe Brooks decided to put on flash-mob tribute on to Jackson, based on one they saw on YouTube. The company was founded by the duo later that year.[5] Universal Music Group hired Flash Mob America to create three flash mobs around the release of Janet Jackson's _Number Ones_ album.[6] The company has also been used for marriage proposals.[7]

In October 2011, FMA was hired by former NFL Quarterback Steve Young's wife to surprise him for his 50th birthday.[8]

In June 2012, the wife of real estate developer Kirk Kerkorian hired FMA to surprise him outside of the Beverly Hills Hotel with a flash mob to the song "To Know Him Is To Love Him" by The Shirelles.[9]

On March 1, 2013, the students of the Bush school at Texas A&M surprised former President George H.W. Bush, with the help of FMA.[10]
