FORQN GROUP (, named after Al-Furqan sura) was an Iranian opposition militant group with clandestine cell system [1] adhering to a Shia anti-clerical Islamist ideology.

Forqan assassinated some senior officials, including Gen. Valiollah Qarani, Morteza Motahari, Mohammad Mofatteh and Mohammad Ali Qazi Tabatabaei but it was soon terminated following arrest and execution of its key members in 1980.

The group opposed other social sectors such as the "wealthy _bazaaris_", the "liberal politicians" and the "Marxist atheists" who, in their view, "were plotting to betray the Islamic Revolution" . The group self-proclaimed to be followers of Ali Shariati, however, according to Ronen Cohen, the claim was used instrumentally to look more "prestigious" and allow them to develop their combined ideology.


Etymology

Due to the literal meaning Forqan is described as criterion or standard. Proof or evidence is the meaning that Wehr's dictionary give to this word. Uri Rubin introduced Forquan as one of names of the Quran. Muslim scholars believes that the root of this word is F.R.Q means depart. In the Tarikh al-Tabari and Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi) the root of this word that means "to God's separating or distinguishing between truth and falsehood, is defined F.R.Q.[2]


History

The Forqan group is the Islamic shia group that emphasized the Islam without clergy and decided to present the real Islam and truthful message of Quran.[3]

According to the Shariati' thought, the rule of the unity of Allah forms the basic element of an equal and just society in the Muhammad prophet's tradition. He believed that the Twelve Imams (not Rashidun except Ali) are the real successors of the Prophet and they tried to make equal society. Also he considered shia Islam above all ideologies and religions but clerics should not have key role at political positions. Akbar Goodarzi who were affected by revolutionary thought of Shariati, authored interpretation of the Quran named monotheistic ideology. Shariati followed Islamic method without clerical intervention such as Abul A'la Maududi's idea but Goodarzi was more fanatical than Shariati and on 1970 the Forqan group was founded by him. Another person who had important effect on forming the ideology of Forqan group was Habibollah Ashory, the frustrated cleric.[4]

The climax of activities of Forqan group, actually the fight against clericalism is seen at early days after victory of Iranian revolution and finally this group in early1980 was eliminated by arresting members of it.[5][6]
