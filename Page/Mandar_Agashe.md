Personal life

Agashe was born in Mumbai on 24 May 1969 to Dnyaneshwar Agashe and Rekha Gogte.[1][2] Him and his siblings, Ashutosh Agashe and Sheetal Agashe, are the grandchildren of industrialist Chandrashekhar Agashe.[3] He also has two children from a former marriage.[4]


Business career

Beginning his career in 1994, Agashe became director of three family-held businesses, including his namesake Mandar Agashe Finance & Investments.[5] Between 1994 and 2000, he established EBZ Online, a software company, along with Oracle;[6][7] and established Codito, a chip-processing company Codito.[8][9][10]

In 1998, he explored the Ayurvedic skincare market under Brihans Pharmaceuticals,[11] eventually establishing Brihans Natural Products Ltd. in 2000.[12] Agashe was one of the directors implicated in the controversial case surrounding the alleged scam by the Suvarna Sahakari Bank in 2008.[13][14]

In 2000 Agashe founded Sarvatra Technologies, a financial technological company that provides payment solution software to the Indian rural/co-operative banking sector.[15] As of 2018, it has 450 co-operative banks on India's National Financial Switch.[16][17] Agashe has served as the company's vice chairman since.[18]


Music career

In the mid 90s, while a student of computer engineering, Agashe launched an internet radio website called _Musicurry.com_.[19][20] He formally came into the music field as a co-music director with Pandit Hridayanath and sang his first playback song with Asha Bhosle.[21] In 1998, he released his debut mainstream effort, _Nazar Nazar_. The album was recorded in Hindi and English, with several songs from the album and their accompanying music videos charted well on MTV India.[22]

In 2003, Agashe planned to go international and released a single in Germany called _I Need Someone_. India Times' Huned Contractor said: "It is a track that showcases a different style altogether with Mandar providing it with a laidback attitude and the smoothness of a drawl."[23]

In 2016, he released a reprise effort with Asha Bhosle in the form of an album called "82", reflecting the veteran singer's age at the time of recording.[24][25] Acting as music director, he featured six of Suresh Bhat's ghazals, that Bhat had given Agashe prior to his death.[26][27][28]
