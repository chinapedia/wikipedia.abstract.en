Release

Critical response

_Don't Blink – Robert Frank_ has received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 86%, based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10.[2] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 75 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[3]

In a review for the _Los Angeles Times_, Kenneth Turan wrote that "[r]ather than being a film about an artist, it’s an attempt to show us what it's like to actually be an artist. [...] _Don't Blink_ is directed by Laura Israel, Frank's film editor for more than 20 years, and includes generous selections from those works. Having a filmmaker that Frank is comfortable with in charge means that the photographer lets his guard down here more than he might have with a relative stranger."[4] Writing for _The New York Times_, A. O. Scott stated that "[Laura Israel's] film is less like a full biography than like a magazine profile, which is as it should be. You leave with a vivid sense of the man’s living presence and a reasonably thorough account of his life, work and associations."[5]

A review for _Variety_ thought the "unconventional editorial style [...] involving rapid-fire collages [...] often leaves one feeling aesthetically pummeled to the point of exhaustion, and portends only limited commercial appeal for the project outside die-hard Frank aficionados."[6]

Box office

As of 13 October 2016, the film has grossed $69,531 at the box office.[7]
