JAN VAN EECKELE or VAN EEKELE or VAN HECKELE (1520 – 1561) was an Early Netherlandish painter active in Bruges.

Van Eeckele became a master of the Guild of St. Luke in Bruges in 1534, where he remained until his death.[1] Works by him shown at the 1902 _Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges_ were a _Mater Dolorosa_ from the cathedral of St Salvator in Bruges, and a _Lactatio Bernardi_ from the church of the Black (Augustinian) Sisters. In his critical catalog of the 1902 exhibition, Georges Hulin de Loo stated that Jan van Eeckele is the same person as the Monogrammist J.V.E.
