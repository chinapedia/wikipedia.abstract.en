LOLA GLENN GRAHAM (23 September 19182 January 1992). She first came to public attention after winning a musical competition at age six by playing the piano. She attended Shelford Church of England Girls' Grammar School and passed her music examinations in December 1933.[1] In October 1936 her piano teacher, Sheila MacFie, organised a recital for Graham and fellow student, Eda Ashton, at the British Music Society's rooms, Melbourne.[2] In April 1942 Graham and Ashton were pianists for a radio broadcast on 3LO on the Australian Broadcasting Commission's network. In May of the following year her chamber music piano work was described by _The Argus_{{'}} reporter, "Graham showed virtuosity in her playing of Albanesi's Sonata in C Major."[3]

She worked in radio for most of her career. In October 1946 she performed a duo piano recital with Mamie Reid on national radio.[4] She worked in live musical theatre both as a band member and accompanist. Graham married Fred Menhennitt on 23 February 1957 and the couple had two sons. She was a backing musician for Barry Humphries, and in 1962, she provided piano on his album, _A Nice Night's Entertainment_.[5] She died, aged 73, after being diagnosed with cancer.
