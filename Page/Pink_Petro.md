PINK PETRO is a company, a social media community created for women professionals in the energy industry and headquartered in Houston, Texas. Katie Mehnert, an energy industry entrepreneur, founded the company in 2014, with the support of Shell, Halliburton, Jive Software and KPMG.[1][2][3][4][5]


History

The Pink Petro story started in 2013, aboard a Boeing 777 from London to Houston when Mehnert laid down her ideas on three cocktail napkins[6]. With support from Cindy Patman, a senior director of diversity and corporate affairs at Halliburton and support from Royal Dutch Shell, she launched an online platform based on cloud enterprise social technology from Jive Software. Then, the CEO of Jive, Elisa Steele created a partnership to launch the community. During the Offshore Technology Conference, former Houston Mayor, Annise Parker proclaimed Pink Petro Day on May 2, 2015 to celebrate with over 300 executives and professionals.[7]

Pink Petro marked its first year with The HerWorld Energy Forum, on International Women’s Day, hosted at Halliburton headquarters in Houston and live-streamed around the globe.[8][9][10]

In 2017, Emerson teamed up with Pink Petro to support women professionals in the energy industry.[11]. In 2018, NES Global Talent joined Pink Petro along with ExxonMobil, Anadarko and Wood Mackenzie.

HERWorld conference

In March 2016, Pink Petro organized the HERWorld Energy Forum, a daylong conference on energy innovation, technology, policy and workforce. It was streamed across the globe with local events being coordinated by internal women’s networks at Halliburton, Shell, GE, KPMG, and Enbridge.[19]

The conference grew in 2017 and attracted gender expert Josh Levs, media executive, Jeffrey W. Hayzlett, and former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Commissioner, Vicky Bailey.

In 2018, the conference featured the first female NFL coach, Jennifer Welter, United States Department of Energy executive, Carol Battershell, and LeanIn.org founder and Facebook COO, Sheryl Sandberg. During the 2018 conference, Vice President of IHS Markit and CERA Week co-chairman James Rosenfeld expressed concerns to Bloomberg News that HERWorld was taking away from CERA Week which coincided on the same dates[20]
