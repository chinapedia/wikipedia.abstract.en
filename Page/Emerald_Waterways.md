EMERALD WATERWAYS is a cruise line offering cruises and tours, with its headquarters in Manchester, UK[1]. The company was launched in August 2013 as a division of the Scenic Group[2], with its first sailing in April 2014. As of August 2019, it operates eight river cruise ships[3] , two chartered river ships[4] and two chartered yachts, offering river cruises and tours in Europe, Russia, Egypt, Vietnam and Cambodia, and yacht cruises and tours on Croatia’s Dalmatian Coast.[5]


Company history

The company was founded by Glen Moroney in 2013. [6]

Emerald Waterways offered its first cruises on the rivers of Europe in 2014, these were provided by the 180-passenger capacity _Emerald Sky_, christened in April 2014 by Godmother Twiggy, followed by the _Emerald Star_ in the August. [7]

In 2015, Emerald Waterways added two new vessels to its fleet, _Emerald Sun_ (which launched in April) and _Emerald Dawn_ (which arrived in June).[8]

In its second year of trading, Emerald Waterways announced that three new ships would join its fleet for the 2017 cruise season. In May 2017, the 180-passenger _Emerald Destiny_ was christened by Godmother Coleen Christie in Vienna, Austria to operate on the Rhine, Main and Danube rivers. Later that year, _Emerald Liberté_ and _Emerald Radiance_ were launched on France’s Rhône River and Portugal’s Douro River respectively.[9] These Star-Ships were custom-built to navigate these rivers. [10]

In 2018, the company announced its first non-European ship, _Emerald Harmony_, which will offer cruises on the Mekong River in Southeast Asia. The 84-passenger vessel is scheduled to be launched on the Mekong in August 2019, where it will offer cruises between Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and Siem Reap, Cambodia. The ship is designed to dock within Ho Chi Minh City centre. [11]

In May 2018, the company announced its expansion into yacht cruising, with its charter of the newly-built yacht, MV _Adriatic Princess_. Launching during April 2019, the yachts will offer cruises on Croatia’s Dalmatian Coast on the Adriatic Sea. [12]

In 2019, the company announced plans to charter new vessels as part of its yacht cruise venture. MS _Swallow_ and MS _Lastavica_ will offer cruises on the Dalmatian Coast from April 2020.[13]


Cruises

Emerald Waterways cruises on six European rivers, as well as on the Volga River in Russia, the Nile River in Egypt and the Mekong River in Southeast Asia.[14]

Emerald Waterways began operating yacht cruises in April 2019. The company chartered the newly-built MV _Adriatic Princess_ to provide cruises on Croatia’s Dalmatian Coast.[15] In 2020 the company intends to charter MS _Swallow_ and MS _Lastavica_ to expand this area of operations.
