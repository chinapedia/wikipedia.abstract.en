Professional wrestling career

Chikara (2009-2017)

On February 20, 2009, Williams made his professional wrestling debut, as Green Ant, tending to Worker Ant after he had been injured (kayfabe) by Chuck Taylor’s Awful Waffle finisher. It was then revealed that Worker Ant was forced to retire due to his injuries, and that Green Ant would stand in his absence. Green Ant made his professional wrestling debut on July 31, when The Colony defeated The Order of the Neo-Solar Temple (Crossbones, Delirious and UltraMantis Black) in a six-man tag team match. On October 18, Green Ant was chosen to go on fellow Colony stablemate Fire Ant’s team in the annual torneo cibernetico, going up against Soldier Ant’s team, which had Carpenter Ant on it, but Green Ant was unsuccessful. From April 23-25, Green Ant and his fellow Colony stablemates Fire Ant and Soldier Ant entered the 2010 King of Trios, defeating the team of Flip Kendrick, Louis Lyndon and Johnny Gargano in their first round match on the 23, before going on to defeat the BDK trio of Pinkie Sanchez (the former Carpenter Ant), Lince Dorado and Tim Donst, handing BDK their first non-disqualification loss on the 24. On the last day of King of Trios, April 25, The Colony defeated Team Osaka Pro (Atsushi Kotoge, Daisuke Harada and Tadasuke) in the semi final, before being defeated by the main BDK trio of Ares, Claudio Castagnoli and Tursas, when referee Derek Sabato turned _rudo_, ending the match with a fast count and aligning himself with BDK. On August 29, Green Ant broke his arm in a match with Keita Yano, and when he returned in February 2011, Chikara then started a storyline, similar to what the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) did with Lex Luger in 1993, where it was claimed that Green Ant had a metal plate inserted into his arm, which resulted in strikes from the elbow being more powerful due to the plate. From April 15-17, The Colony entered the 2011 King of Trios, defeating Sinn Bodhi, Kodama and Obariyon in their first round match. The next day, during a fan conclave, Chikara held a contest to see who could bodyslam the 375 lb (170 kg) BDK member Tursas. Green Ant entered the contest, again copying the storyline that the WWF did with Luger and Yokozuna in 1993, but before he could complete the slam, he was tripped by BDK member Jakob Hammermeier. The next day, The Colony defeated the BDK trio of Tim Donst, Delirious and Hammermeier, after Green Ant bodyslammed Tursas, and then submitted Hammermeier with Luger’s trademark finisher, the _Torture Rack_, to reach the semifinals. The following day, The Colony defeated The Osirian Portal (Amasis, Hieracon and Ophidian) to advance to the finals for the second time in a row. Later that same day, The Colony defeated F.I.S.T (Chuck Taylor, Icarus and Johnny Gargano) to win the 2011 King of Trios. In July, Green Ant started a ‘Flex Express’ bus tour that was featured on Chikara’s video podcasts, in preparation for his match with Tursas, once again imitating a similar tour Luger did in 1993. One of the episodes even featured a cameo from Luger himself. The match took place on July 30, and it saw Tursas defeat Green Ant, following interference from Jakob Hammermeier. On August 27, Green Ant took part and advanced to the ninth annual Young Lions Cup tournament, before losing to Osaka Pro Wrestling representative Tadasuke. The following month, Green Ant and Fire Ant, as The Colony, made their first tour of Japan with Osaka Pro, culminating in a match for the Osaka Pro Tag Team Championship, where they unsuccessfully challenged Atsushi Kotoge and Daisuke Harada. On November 13, at Chikara’s first internet-pay-per-view, High Noon, Green Ant ended his feud with Tursas by defeating him with his new finisher, the _Chikara Special: Green_.

2012 saw Green Ant, along with The Colony, and other top Chikara stars, start a feus with the Gekido group, with The Colony mainly focusing on the trio of assailANT, combatANT and deviANT, also known as the Swarm. For the 2012 King of Trios, Chikara’s Director of Fun Wink Vavasseur mixed members of the Colony with members of the Swarm, with Green Ant and Fire Ant being forced to team with assailANT as The Colony. Following those changes, The Colony lost in the first round of King of Trios, to Team Sendai Girls (Dash Chisako, Meiko Satomura and Sendai Sachiko). Green Ant and Fire Ant were also forced to remain with assailANT after King of Trios had ended. At Under the Hood, The Colony teamed with Mike Quackenbush, in a losing effort to The Swarm team of deviANT and Soldier Ant and The Pieces of Hate (Jigsaw and The Shard). When Chikara went inactive following Aniversario: Never Compromise in June 2013, Green Ant and Fire Ant took the time to try and search for Soldier Ant, after Soldier had (kayfabe) quit Chikara in April that year. It was also revealed through The Ashes of Chikara, that Green Ant and Fire Ant still had issues trusting assailANT, due to his prior association with Gekido, but eventually trusted him after assailANT revealed the real reason why he had a change of heart; he had become a father, and he didn’t want his son to see him as a bitter and resentful man. Green Ant and assailANT reconciled, and Green Ant passed on the mantle of Worker Ant to assailANT.

Evolve (2014-2018)

Williams made his debut at Evolve on September 14, 2014, at Evolve 35, losing to Timothy Thatcher.[3]
