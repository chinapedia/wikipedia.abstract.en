RICHARD RAY FARRELL (born 1956) is an American electric blues guitarist, harmonicist, singer and songwriter. Farrell has released ten albums in his own name to date, and has toured widely over a career that started in the mid-1970s.


Life and career

Farrell was born in Niagara Falls, New York, United States, but left home after his graduation, backpacking his way across Europe. He found 'work' as a busker on the Paris Métro.[1] In 1976, Farrell met Sugar Blue whilst they were both busking in the Métro. Farrell's first instrument was the harmonica, graduating then to the guitar to accompany his singing.[2]

In 1978, he briefly fronted a Spanish blues-rock band in Spain, and lived with a gypsy family for six months. After becoming a father in 1985, he relocated to Stuttgart, Germany, and played with a local blues band. In 1987, Richard opened for Joe Cocker at the Backnang Open Air Festival. Two years later he led his own Richard Ray Farrell Band, and started touring across Europe. Through connections he toured with Lazy Lester, Big Jack Johnson, Big Boy Henry, Louisiana Red, Frank Frost and R. L. Burnside between 1990 and 1993, during which time Farrell released his debut album, _Live in Germany_ (1992). In 1993, he formed an outfit known as Street Talk, but the members lived across the Northern Hemisphere, making commitment impossible. Farrell returned to both solo acoustic performances and playing with his electric blues trio. In 1995, Farrell and Jimmy Carl Black formed the Farrell and Black Band, who recorded two albums for Stormy Monday Records, _Cataract Jump_ (1996) and _Black Limousine_ (1999).[3] He honed his songwriting skills on these albums and then released _Street Songs, Jazzy Tunes and Down Home Blues_ (1998).

Farrell returned to the States in 2001, and two years later issued his first album for Blue Beet Music, _Bohemian Life_. Featuring sixteen original songs, it included a guest appearance by the harmonica player, Jerry Portnoy. _Bohemian Life_ reached number 18 on the _Living Blues_ radio chart. _Acoustic Roots_ (2005) followed, which peaked at number 20 on the _Living Blues_ chart. In 2006, Farrell teamed up with Steve Guyger to produce the traditional blues-orientated, _Down Home Old School Country Blues_.[4] _Stuck On The Blues_ (2007) was another largely acoustic joint affair, this time with the Italian harmonicist, Marco Pandolfi.[5] _Camino de Sanlucar_ (2009) was recorded in Seville, Spain.[6]

_I Sing The Blues Eclectic_ (2011) contained twelve original tracks,[7] and was his most commercially profitable to date. In 2013, Farrell issued _At Cambayá Club_, a live album with Farrell providing guitar, harmonica and vocals throughout. _Shoe Shoppin’ Woman_ (Blue Beet, 2014) is his most recent offering,[8] and contained cover versions of Elmore James' "Wild About You", and Snooks Eaglin's "If I Could".[9]

Farrell's favorite statement is "The blues will never die because it's not a fad, it's more a way of life."[10]
