MOLE DAY is an unofficial holiday celebrated among chemists, chemistry students and chemistry enthusiasts on October 23, between 6:02 a.m. and 6:02 p.m.,[1]

-   -   -   making the date 6:02 10/23 in the American style of writing dates. The time and date are derived from the Avogadro number, which is approximately , defining the number of particles (atoms or molecules) in one mole (mol) of substance, one of the seven base SI units.


Overview

Mole Day originated in an article in _The Science Teacher_ in the early 1980s.[2] Inspired by this article, Maurice Oehler, now a retired high school chemistry teacher from Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, founded the National Mole Day Foundation (NMDF) on May 15, 1991.[3]

Many high schools around the United States, South Africa, Australia, and Canada celebrate Mole Day as a way to get their students interested in chemistry, with various activities often related to chemistry or moles.[4]

The American Chemical Society sponsors National Chemistry Week,[5] which occurs from the Sunday through Saturday during which October 23 falls. This makes Mole Day an integral part of National Chemistry Week.
