History

The land was purchased between 1938 and 1968 from private owners, and includes one gift of 10 acres from Lincoln County, Oregon made in 1963. In the days before the completion of the Coast Highway, the beach between Newport and Seal Rock was used as an access road. Motorists would travel at low tide, following the mail carrier who knew the best way to cross Beaver Creek. The park was first known as Ona Beach State Park, but was renamed in 2013 to honor the first Oregon State Parks and Recreation Commission chairperson.[2]
