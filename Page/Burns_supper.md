A BURNS SUPPER is a celebration of the life and poetry of the poet Robert Burns (25 January 175921 July 1796), the author of many Scots poems. The suppers are normally held on or near the poet's birthday, 25 January, occasionally known as ROBERT BURNS DAY (or ROBBIE BURNS DAY[1] or RABBIE BURNS DAY) but more commonly known as BURNS NIGHT (). However, in principle, celebrations may be held at any other time of the year.


History

The first supper was held _in memoriam_ at Burns Cottage by Burns's friends, on 21 July 1801, the fifth anniversary of his death; it has been a regular occurrence ever since. The first still extant Burns Club was founded in Greenock in 1801 by merchants who were born in Ayrshire, some of whom had known Burns. They held the first Burns supper on what they thought was his birthday, 29 January 1802, but in 1803, they discovered the Ayr parish records that noted his date of birth was actually 25 January 1759.[2] Since then, suppers have been held on or about 25 January.

Burns suppers may be formal or informal. Both typically include haggis (a traditional Scottish dish celebrated by Burns in _Address to a Haggis_), Scotch whisky and the recitation of Burns's poetry. Formal dinners are hosted by organisations such as Burns clubs, the Freemasons or St Andrews Societies; they occasionally end with dancing when ladies are present. Formal suppers follow a standard order.


Standard order

Piping in guests

A piper generally greets the guests, who gather and mix as at any informal party.[3] At less formal gatherings, traditional Scottish music is played.[4]

Host's welcoming speech

The host says a few words welcoming everyone to the supper and perhaps stating the reason for it.[5]

All the guests are seated and grace is said, usually using the _Selkirk Grace_, a well-known thanksgiving said before meals that uses the Scots language. Although attributed to Burns, the Selkirk Grace was already known in the 17th century as the "Galloway Grace" or the "Covenanters' Grace". It came to be called the Selkirk Grace because Burns was said to have delivered it at a dinner given by the Earl of Selkirk. ]]

Selkirk Grace

    Some hae meat an canna eat,
    And some wad eat that want it;
    But we hae meat, and we can eat,
    And sae the Lord be thankit.[6]

Soup course

The supper starts with the soup course. Normally, a Scottish soup, such as Scotch broth, potato soup, cullen skink, or cock-a-leekie, is served.

Haggis

Piping of haggis

Everyone stands as the haggis is brought in. It is usually brought in by the cook on a large dish, generally while a bagpiper leads the way to the host's table, where the haggis is laid down. "A Man's A Man for A' That", "Robbie Burns Medley" or "The Star O' Robbie Burns" might be played.[7] The host, or perhaps a guest, then recites the '' Address to a Haggis''. ]]

| Fair fa' your honest, sonsie face,            |
| Great chieftain o' the puddin-race!           |
| Aboon them a' ye tak your place,              |
| Painch, tripe, or thairm:                     |
| Weel are ye wordy o' a grace                  |
| As lang's my airm.                            |
+-----------------------------------------------+
| The groaning trencher there ye fill,          |
| Your hurdies like a distant hill,             |
| Your pin wad help to mend a mill              |
| In time o' need,                              |
| While thro' your pores the dews distil        |
| Like amber bead.                              |
+-----------------------------------------------+
| His knife see rustic Labour dicht,            |
| An' cut you up wi' ready slicht,              |
| Trenching your gushing entrails bricht,       |
| Like ony ditch;                               |
| And then, O what a glorious sicht,            |
| Warm-reekin, rich!                            |
+-----------------------------------------------+
| Then, horn for horn, they stretch an' strive: |
| Deil tak the hindmaist! on they drive,        |
| Till a' their weel-swall'd kytes belyve,      |
| Are bent like drums;                          |
| Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive,        |
| "Bethankit" hums.                             |

| Poor devil! see him ower his trash,           |
| As feckless as a wither'd rash,               |
| His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash,          |
| His nieve a nit;                              |
| Thro' bloody flood or field to dash,          |
| O how unfit!                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------+
| But mark the Rustic, haggis fed,              |
| The trembling earth resounds his tread.       |
| Clap in his wallie nieve a blade,             |
| He'll mak it whistle;                         |
| An' legs an' arms, an' heads will sned,       |
| Like taps o' thristle.                        |
+-----------------------------------------------+
| Ye Pow'rs wha mak mankind your care,          |
| And dish them out their bill o' fare,         |
| Auld Scotland wants nae skinkin ware          |
| That jaups in luggies;                        |
| But, if ye wish her gratefu' prayer,          |
| Gie her a haggis!                             |
+-----------------------------------------------+

At the line _His knife see rustic Labour dicht_, the speaker normally draws and sharpens a knife. At the line _An' cut you up wi' ready slicht_, he plunges it into the haggis and cuts it open from end to end. When done properly, the "ceremony" is a highlight of the evening.

Main course

At the end of the poem, a whisky toast will be proposed to the haggis, and the company will sit down to the meal. The haggis is traditionally served with mashed potatoes (tatties) and mashed swede (neeps).[8]

Other courses

A dessert course, cheese courses, coffee, etc., may also be part of the meal. The courses normally use traditional Scottish recipes. For instance, dessert may be cranachan or tipsy laird (whisky trifle), followed by oatcakes and cheese, all washed down with the "water of life" (uisge beatha), Scotch whisky.

Toasts

When the meal reaches the coffee stage, various speeches and toasts are given.

Immortal memory

The main speaker gives a speech remembering some aspect of Burns's life or poetry. It may be either light-hearted or serious and may include the recitation of a poem or a song by Burns. A toast to the Immortal Memory of Robert Burns then follows.[9]

Address to the Lassies

This was originally a short speech given by a male guest in thanks to the women who had prepared the meal. However, it is now much more wide-ranging and generally covers the male speaker's view on women. It is normally amusing and not offensive, particularly since it will be followed by a reply from the "lassies" concerned. The men drink a toast to the women's health.

Reply to the Laddies

This is occasionally (and humorously) called the "Toast to the Laddies". Like the previous toast, it is generally now quite wide-ranging. A female guest will give her views on men and reply to any specific points raised by the previous speaker. Like the previous speech, it should be amusing but not offensive. Quite often, the speakers giving this toast and the previous one will collaborate so that the two toasts complement each other.

Works by Burns

After the speeches there may be singing of songs by Burns (such as _Ae Fond Kiss_, _Parcel o' Rogues_ and _A Man's a Man_) and more poetry (such as _To a Mouse_, _To a Louse_, _Tam o' Shanter_, _The Twa Dogs_ and _Holy Willie's Prayer_).

That may be done by the individual guests or by invited experts, and it goes on for as long as the guests wish. It may include other works by poets influenced by Burns, particularly poets writing in Scots. Foreign guests may also be invited to sing or say works from their land.

Closing

Finally, the host will call on one of the guests to give the vote of thanks. Then, everyone is asked to stand, join hands, and sing '' Auld Lang Syne'' to bring the evening to an end.
