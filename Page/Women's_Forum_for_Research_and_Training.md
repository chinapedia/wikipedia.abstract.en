The WOMEN'S FORUM FOR RESEARCH AND TRAINING (WFRT) (_Multaqa al-mar æa lil-dirasat, wa al-Tadrib_), established in 2000, is "the major human rights organization for women in Yemen".[1]

The WFRT was founded by the human rights activist Saud al-Qadasr, and is based in Ta'izz. It organizes workshops for government officials, promotes human rights issues with other NGOs and arranges training for grass-roots activists.[2]
