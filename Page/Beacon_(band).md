BEACON is an American electronic music group from Brooklyn.


History

Beacon was founded in 2011 by Thomas Mullarney and Jacob Gossett, both of whom were students at the Pratt Institute at the time. They began by self-releasing their first singles through the Bandcamp platform.[1] Later that year, Moodgadget issued the group's first EP, _No Body_, leading to tours with Gold Panda, Oneohtrix Point Never, and Tycho. In 2012 the group signed with Ghostly International, who released their debut full-length in 2013.[2] A sophomore full-length arrived on the same label in early 2016.[3]
