_EMOTIONS_ is a compilation album by country pop singer Juice Newton. It was released by Pair Records in 1994 and consists of 20 tracks taken from five of the six albums Newton recorded for RCA.


Overview

Juice Newton began her recording career with RCA Records in 1975. Her two albums with them – _Juice Newton & Silver Spur_ and _After the Dust Settles_ – met with little success and the label dropped her.[1] Newton then moved to Capitol Records and eventually made her "breakthrough" in 1981 with _Juice_, an album that reach number 22 on the Billboard 200 chart and number 16 on the Canadian Top 50 album chart.[2][3] The album gave Newton three hit singles, beginning with "Angel of the Morning" which peaked at number four on the pop charts and number 22 on the country charts.[4][5] Her second single from the album, "Queen of Hearts", reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 14 on the country charts.[6] The final single from _Juice_, "The Sweetest Thing (I've Ever Known)", peaked at number one on the country chart and number seven on the pop chart.[7]

Newton followed up _Juice_ with _Quiet Lies_ (1982), another hit album that reached number 22 on the Billboard 200.[8] This album also had three singles released from its track line up. The first, "Love's Been a Little Bit Hard on Me", reached number 7 on the Billboard pop chart and number 2 on the Country chart.[9] The second, "Break It to Me Gently", topped the pop chart at number 11 and the country chart at number 2.[10] It also won her the Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Female.[11] The final single from _Quiet Lies_ was "In the Heart of the Night". It reached number 4 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart and number 25 on the Hot 100.[12]

Newton's next album, _Dirty Looks_ (1983), was not as successful as _Juice_ and _Quiet Lies_. However, it sold well enough in Canada to be certified Gold on October 1, 1983, by the Canadian Music Industry.[13] The three singles released from this album were "Tell Her No", "Dirty Looks", and "Stranger at My Door". The first two peaked on the pop chart at, respectively, numbers 27 and 90. The third peaked on the country chart at 45.[14]

In 1984 Newton returned to RCA and moved more into country music with the release of _Can't Wait All Night_.[15] Her next album, _Old Flame_, peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard album chart. [16] "You Make Me Want to Make You Mine" was the album's lead-off single and went to number one on the Billboard Country chart. It was also her first top ten hit in three years.[17] This was followed by "Hurt" which also went to number one on Billboard's chart. "Old Flame" and "Cheap Love", the next two singles to be released, peaked at number five and number nine, respectively. "What Can I Do with My Heart", the album's final single release was written by Newton's long-time collaborator Otha Young and also peaked at number nine.[18] "Both to Each Other (Friends & Lovers)", a duet by Newton and Eddie Rabbitt, was released as a single in July 1985 and peaked at number one. This song was not included in the original release of _Old Flame_ but was added to CD reissues.[19]

_Emotion_ (1987) was the last of Newton's albums to appear on Billboard's Top Country album chart and peaked at number 59.[20] The album had two single releases. "First Time Caller" peaked at number 24 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart while "Tell Me True" peaked at number 8 on the same chart.[21] Also featured on the album are "Emotions" and "'Til You Cry". After one more album, _Ain't Gonna Cry_ (1989), Newton abandoned recording and concentrated on performing in nightclubs.[22]


Pair Records compilation

_Emotions_ was released on February 7, 1994, by Pair Records, a budget label that specialized in compilations released as double albums with music licensed from various labels.[23][24] For this CD Pair licensed 20 songs from five of Newton's RCA albums. Thus none of the hits from her Capitol releases are included. Two song's from her debut album, _Juice Newton & Silver Spur_ (1975) are included along with three from her second release, _After the Dust Settles_.[25][26] The largest number of songs came from _Old Flame_ with a total of seven songs.[27] Three songs were derived from _Can't Wait All Night_ and four from the similar-named _Emotion_.[28][29]

In his liner notes for _Emotions_ music critic Rich Kienzel noted that:

    In the early nineties, when many younger country artists like Mary-Chapin Carpenter have folk or rock roots, Newton was the first to emerge from such a background. Today, a new younger generation of country artists are treading musical ground Juice Newton help to break years ago.[30]
