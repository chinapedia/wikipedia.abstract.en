Early life

Rahamim Naouri was born in 1902.


Career

Naouri served as the chief rabbi of Bône.[1][2]

Naouri was a religious zionist, and he was an advocate of the creation of the State of Israel in 1948.[3] He also supported Bnei Akiva.[4]

At the outset of the Algerian War, Naouri vowed to stay in Bône as long as there was still a minyan.[5] In 1962, some suggested Naouri should join a temporary unity government in Rocher Noir in the manner of the Moroccan government; however, Naouri never did, possibly due to opposition from the FNL.[6]

Naouri subsequently served as the head of a rabbinical court in Paris.[7][8]


Death and legacy
