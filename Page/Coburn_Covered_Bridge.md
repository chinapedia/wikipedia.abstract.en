The Coburn Covered Bridge stands in far eastern East Montpelier, about east of the town center. Coburn Road runs north from United States Route 2, roughly paralleling the south-flowing Winooski River and eventually crossing it. The bridge is oriented east-west, and is a single-span queenpost truss structure with embedded iron rods. It is long and wide, with a roadway width of (one lane), and rests on abutments of concrete and stone faced with concrete. The exterior side walls are sheathed in vertical board siding to a height of about . The portals are sheathed to their full height in vertical siding, and have segmented-arch tops. The bridge roof is metal. The roadway deck consists of three steel beams carrying a concrete floor; this is the result of work done in the 1970s.[2]

The bridge was built about 1851, and is the town's only covered bridge.[3]
