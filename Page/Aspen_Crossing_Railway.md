The ASPEN CROSSING RAILWAY is a heritage railway in Southern Alberta, southeast of Calgary.

In 2002 the last CP train ran through Mossleigh. After 6 years of negotiations, Jason Thornhill, the creator of Aspen Crossing, was successful at saving and securing the rights to 14 miles of rail line. By May 2015 the Aspen Crossing Railway made its inaugural run with over 100 guests and patrons coming out to celebrate the latest addition to Aspen Crossing.

In 2017 the Aspen Crossing Railway will be in its third year, offering over 11 different themed train excursions. From Wine and Cheese, Ales on Rails, Circus Train, Dinner Theatre and Champagne Brunch just to mention a few. The average train excursion runs between 2 – 4 hours.

Some train tours include food, while others have food and beverages available for purchase. Aspen Crossing was also the first in Alberta to be authorized to offer The Polar Express™ Train Ride based on the book and movie of the same name. The Aspen Crossing Railway is also the first Halloween Haunt on rails in Canada under the name of, The Train of Terror.
