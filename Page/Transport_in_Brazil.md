TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE in Brazil is characterized by strong regional differences and lack of development of the national rail network.[1] Brazil's fast-growing economy, and especially the growth in exports, will place increasing demands on the transport networks.[2] However, sizeable new investments that are expected to address some of the issues are either planned or in progress.[3][4]

Highways

Rodovias_Duplicadas_do_Brasil,_Junho_de_2019.jpg highlighted in red. The São Paulo state, which has state control of most federal roads in its territory, made its road network the most extensive one in the country, thanks to this fact.

]] __ Brazil has 1,751,868 kilometers of roads, 96,353 km of them paved and 1,655,515 km unpaved. That means that only 5.5% of the roads are paved and that 94.5% are unpaved. The most important highway of the country is BR-116 and the second is BR-101.

The country has a low rate of car ownership of 140 per 1000 population, however in comparison to the other developing economies of the BRIC group Brazil exceeds India and China.

Airports

ViewfromAir-SaoPaulo.jpg.]] Rio_de_Janeiro-Galeão_International_Airport.December.01.2011.JPG.]] Most international flights must go to São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport or Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport. Belo Horizonte is the main international airport outside Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. A few go to Brasília, Recife, Natal, and just recently Fortaleza has accepted international flights. With South American integration, more airports can be expected to open to international flights.

In 2013 Brazil had the sixth largest passenger air market in the world.[13]
