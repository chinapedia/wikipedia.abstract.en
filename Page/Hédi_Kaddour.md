Editor-in-Chief of the magazine '' Po&Sie '', he sometimes gives literary columns to _Le Monde_ des livres, _Libération_ and _Le Magazine Littéraire_.

After several collections of poems published by Editions Gallimard, he published __ in 2005, a novel that plunges into the history of men and letters of the twentieth century. This book, which mixes adventure and espionage, also houses a sentimental plot tinged with melancholy. Hailed by critics, it received the prix Goncourt du premier roman and the prix du premier roman, and was ranked "Best French novel of the year 2005" by magazine _Lire_.

A collection of studies on this novel appeared under the title _Études sur Waltenberg, roman de Hedi Kaddour_, at editions Act Mem (series "Lire Aujourd'hui") in 2007. The novel _Waltenberg_ was translated into English by David Coward at Random House in 2007 and in German by Grete Osterwald in 2009 by _Eichborn Verlag_, Frankfurt am Main.

In January 2010, Hédi Kaddour published two new books: _Savoir-vivre_, novel, Gallimard, series "Blanche" and "Folio". A German translation appeared by Eichborn Verlag in April 2011. _Les Pierres qui montent, notes et croquis de l'année 2008_, Gallimard, series "Blanche".

In 2015, Hédi Kaddour received the Prix Jean-Freustié for his novel __, as well as the Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française. He was also among the four finalists of the Prix Goncourt which was eventually awarded to Leïla Slimani. In March 2016, he also received the Prix Valery Larbaud for that novel.

Three of his poems were put into music in 1999 for voice and piano by composer Karol Beffa in the series _Six Mélodies_ (_Le Vin nouveau_, _Théâtre du vide_ and _La Jalousie_); These pieces were subsequently transcribed for violin (or viola) and piano in 2008 (_Cinq Pièces_).
