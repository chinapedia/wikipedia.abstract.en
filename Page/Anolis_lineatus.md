The STRIPED ANOLE (_ANOLIS LINEATUS_) is a species of lizard in the family Dactyloidae. It is native to Curaçao and Aruba of the Netherlands Antilles, but has also been introduced to Klein Curaçao.[1] It is generally common (at least on Curaçao),[2] and is particularly common in densely vegetated gardens in the capital Willemstad.[3] It is found in dry tropical shrubland at all elevations in its range,[4] but is uncommon in habitats without larger trees.[5] It can often be seen on rocks, the walls of buildings or tree trunks; at various heights but often relatively close to the ground.[6] It is a member of the _A. chrysolepis_ species group.[7]

In _A. lineatus_, males reach about in snout-to-vent length and the females about .[8] It is overall light brownish with a dark-edged pale lateral stripe on each side, and typically several light bars on the body and tail.[9] It has an orange-yellow dewlap with a blackish spot; the dewlap is significantly larger in males than in females.[10] It is the only known species of anole where the dewlap is asymmetrically coloured, being deeper orange on one side and yellower on the other.[11][12] In almost three-quarter of all individuals the left side is the most yellow.[13] The colour difference between the two sides is indistinct in only a minority of the females.[14][15]
