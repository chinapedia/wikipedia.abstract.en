GHOLAM ALI MANSOORI (born in 1943), G. Ali Mansoori also known as "GA Mansoori" is an Iranian-American scientist known for his research within energy, nanotechnology and thermodynamics.[1][2][3] He is a professor at the Departments of Bioengineering, Chemical Engineering and also Physics at University of Illinois at Chicago.


Life and education

Mansoori completed his PhD at the University of Oklahoma in 1969 with a dissertation on "A Variational Approach to the Equilibrium Thermodynamic Properties of Simple Liquids and Phase Transitions". Mansoori did post-doctoral work at Rice University.[4]


Career

Mansoori contributed to over 550 publications including ten books,[5] some of which became text-book references in thermodynamics and nanotechnology. The most cited work he has co-authored is Equilibrium thermodynamic properties of the mixture of hard spheres in The Journal of Chemical Physics in 1971[6] with more than 2000 citations as of February 2019.[7]
