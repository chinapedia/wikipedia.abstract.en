OMEGA (capital: Ω, lowercase: Ω; Greek ὦ, later ὦ μέγα, Modern Greek ωμέγα) is the 24th and last letter of the Greek alphabet. In the Greek numeric system/Isopsephy (Gematria), it has a value of 800. The word literally means "great O" (_ō mega_, mega meaning "great"), as opposed to omicron, which means "little O" (_o mikron_, micron meaning "little").[1]

In phonetic terms, the Ancient Greek Ω is a long open-mid _o_ , comparable to the vowel of British English _raw_. In Modern Greek, Ω represents the mid back rounded vowel , the same sound as omicron. The letter omega is transcribed _ō_ or simply _o_.

As the last letter of the Greek alphabet, Omega is often used to denote the last, the end, or the ultimate limit of a set, in contrast to alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet.


History

Ω was not part of the early (8th century BC) Greek alphabets. It was introduced in the late 7th century BC in the Ionian cities of Asia Minor to denote the long half-open [ɔː]. It is a variant of omicron (Ο), broken up at the side (), with the edges subsequently turned outward (, , , ).[2] The Dorian city of Knidos as well as a few Aegean islands, namely Paros, Thasos and Melos, chose the exact opposite innovation, using a broken-up circle for the short and a closed circle for the long /o/.[3]

The name Ωμέγα is Byzantine; in Classical Greek, the letter was called _ō_ (), whereas the omicron was called _ou_ ().[4] The modern lowercase shape goes back to the uncial form , a form that developed during the 3rd century BC in ancient handwriting on papyrus, from a flattened-out form of the letter () that had its edges curved even further upward.[5]

In addition to the Greek alphabet, Omega was also adopted into the early Cyrillic alphabet. See Cyrillic omega (Ѡ, ѡ). A Raetic variant is conjectured to be at the origin or parallel evolution of the Elder Futhark ᛟ.

Omega was also adopted into the Latin alphabet, as a letter of the 1982 revision to the African reference alphabet. It has had little use. See Latin omega.


The symbol Ω (uppercase letter)

or some forms of Latin Q. The O and underscore may, but need not, be touching.]] The uppercase letter Ω is used as a symbol:

-   In chemistry:
    -   For oxygen-18, a natural, stable isotope of oxygen.[6]
-   In physics:
    -   For ohm – SI unit of electrical resistance; formerly also used upside down (℧) to represent mho, the old name for the inverse of an ohm (now siemens with symbol S) used for electrical conductance. Unicode has a separate code point for the ohm sign (U+2126, Ω), but it is included only for backward compatibility, and the Greek uppercase omega character (U+03A9, Ω) is preferred.[7]
    -   In statistical mechanics, Ω refers to the multiplicity (number of microstates) in a system.
