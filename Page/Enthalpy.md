ENTHALPY , a property of a thermodynamic system, is equal to the system's internal energy plus the product of its pressure and volume.[1][2] In a system enclosed so as to prevent matter transfer, for processes at constant pressure, the heat absorbed or released equals the change in enthalpy.

The unit of measurement for enthalpy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule. Other historical conventional units still in use include the British thermal unit (BTU) and the calorie.

Enthalpy comprises a system's internal energy, which is the energy required to create the system, plus the amount of work required to make room for it by displacing its environment and establishing its volume and pressure.[3]

Enthalpy is defined as a state function that depends only on the prevailing equilibrium state identified by the system's internal energy, pressure, and volume. It is an extensive quantity.

Enthalpy is the preferred expression of system energy changes in many chemical, biological, and physical measurements at constant pressure, because it simplifies the description of energy transfer. In a system enclosed so as to prevent matter transfer, at constant pressure, the enthalpy change equals the energy transferred from the environment through heat transfer or work other than expansion work.

The total enthalpy, _H_, of a system cannot be measured directly. The same situation exists in classical mechanics: only a change or difference in energy carries physical meaning. Enthalpy itself is a thermodynamic potential, so in order to measure the enthalpy of a system, we must refer to a defined reference point; therefore what we measure is the change in enthalpy, Δ_H_. The Δ_H_ is a positive change in endothermic reactions, and negative in heat-releasing exothermic processes.

FOR PROCESSES UNDER CONSTANT PRESSURE, Δ_H_ is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system, plus the pressure-volume work p ΔV done by the system on its surroundings (which is > 0 for an expansion and < 0 for a contraction).[4] This means that the change in enthalpy under such conditions is the heat absorbed or released by the system through a chemical reaction or by external heat transfer. Enthalpies for chemical substances at constant pressure usually refer to standard state: most commonly 1 bar pressure. Standard state does not, strictly speaking, specify a temperature (see standard state), but expressions for enthalpy generally reference the standard heat of formation at 25 °C.

Enthalpy of ideal gases and incompressible solids and liquids does not depend on pressure, unlike entropy and Gibbs energy. Real materials at common temperatures and pressures usually closely approximate this behavior, which greatly simplifies enthalpy calculation and use in practical designs and analyses.


History

The word _enthalpy_ was coined relatively late, in the early 20th century, in analogy with the 19th-century terms _energy_ (introduced in its modern sense by Thomas Young in 1802) and _entropy_ (coined in analogy to _energy_ by Rudolf Clausius in 1865). Where _energy_ uses the root of the Greek word (ergon) "work" to express the idea of "work-content" and where _entropy_ uses the Greek word (tropi) "transformation" to express the idea of "transformation-content", so by analogy, _enthalpy_ uses the root of the Greek word (thalpos) "warmth, heat"[5] to express the idea of "heat-content". The term does in fact stand in for the older term "heat content",[6] a term which is now mostly deprecated as misleading, as refers to the amount of heat absorbed in a process at constant pressure only,[7] but not in the general case (when pressure is variable).[8] Josiah Willard Gibbs used the term "a heat function for constant pressure" for clarity.[9]

Introduction of the concept of "heat content" is associated with Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron and Rudolf Clausius (Clausius–Clapeyron relation, 1850).

The term _enthalpy_ first appeared in print in 1909.[10] It is attributed to Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, who most likely introduced it orally the year before, at the first meeting of the Institute of Refrigeration in Paris.See:

-   -

It gained currency only in the 1920s, notably with the _Mollier Steam Tables and Diagrams_, published in 1927.

Until the 1920s, the symbol was used, somewhat inconsistently, for "heat" in general. The definition of as strictly limited to enthalpy or "heat content at constant pressure" was formally proposed by Alfred W. Porter in 1922.[11][12]


Formal definition

The enthalpy of a thermodynamic system is defined as[13][14]

_H_ = _U_ + _p__V_,

    where
    :*H is enthalpy

    :*U is the internal energy of the system

    :*p is pressure

    :*V is the volume of the system

Enthalpy is an extensive property. This means that, for homogeneous systems, the enthalpy is proportional to the size of the system. It is convenient to introduce the specific enthalpy $h=\frac{H}{m}$, where m is the mass of the system, or the molar enthalpy $H_\mathrm{m}=\frac{H}{n}$, where n is the number of moles (h and H_(m) are intensive properties). For inhomogeneous systems the enthalpy is the sum of the enthalpies of the composing subsystems:

_H_ = ∑_(_k_)_H__(_k_),

    where
    :*H is the total enthalpy of all the subsystems

    :*k refers to the various subsystems

    :*H_(k) refers to the enthalpy of each subsystem

    :*∑_(k)H_(k) refers to the sum of the enthalpies of all subsystems

A closed system may lie in thermodynamic equilibrium in a static gravitational field, so that its pressure, p, varies continuously with altitude, while, because of the equilibrium requirement, its temperature T is invariant with altitude. (Correspondingly, the system's gravitational potential energy density also varies with altitude.) Then the enthalpy summation becomes an integral:

_H_ = ∫(_ρ__h_) _d__V_,

    where
    :*ρ ("rho") is density (mass per unit volume)

    :*h is the specific enthalpy (enthalpy per unit mass)

    :*(ρh) represents the enthalpy density (enthalpy per unit volume)

    :*dV denotes an infinitesimally small element of volume within the system, for example the volume of an infinitesimally thin horizontal layer

    :*∫(ρh) dV, represents the sum of the enthalpies of all the elements of the volume.

The enthalpy of a closed homogeneous system is its cardinal energy function, H(S, p), with natural state variables its entropy S[p] and its pressure p. A differential relation for it can be derived as follows. We start from the first law of thermodynamics for closed systems for an infinitesimal process:

_d__U_ = _δ__Q_ − _δ__W_.

    where
    :*δQ is a small amount of heat added to the system

    :*δW a small amount of work performed by the system.

In a homogeneous system in which only reversible, or quasi-static, processes are considered, the second law of thermodynamics gives δQ = T dS with T the absolute temperature of the system. Furthermore, if only pV work is done, δW = p dV. As a result,

_d__U_ = _T_ _d__S_ − _p_ _d__V_.

Adding d(pV) to both sides of this expression gives

_d__U_ + _d_(_p__V_) = _T_ _d__S_ − _p_ _d__V_ + _d_(_p__V_),

    or

_d_(_U_ + _p__V_) = _T_ _d__S_ + _V_ _d__p_.

So

_d__H_(_S_, _p_) = _T_ _d__S_ + _V_ _d__p_.


Other expressions

The above expression of _dH_ in terms of entropy and pressure may be unfamiliar to some readers. However, there are expressions in terms of more familiar variables such as temperature and pressure:[15][16]

_d__H_ = _C__(_p_) _d__T_ + _V_(1 − _α__T_) _d__p_.

Here _C__(_p_) is the heat capacity at constant pressure and _α_ is the coefficient of (cubic) thermal expansion:

$$\alpha = \frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_p.$$

With this expression one can, in principle, determine the enthalpy if _C_(p)_ and _V_ are known as functions of _p_ and _T_.

Note that for an ideal gas, _αT_ = 1,[17] so that

_d__H_ = _C__(_p_) _d__T_.

In a more general form, the first law describes the internal energy with additional terms involving the chemical potential and the number of particles of various types. The differential statement for _dH_ then becomes

_d__H_ = _T_ _d__S_ + _V_ _d__p_ + ∑_(_i_)_μ__(_i_) _d__N__(_i_),

where _μ__(_i_) is the chemical potential per particle for an _i_-type particle, and _N__(_i_) is the number of such particles. The last term can also be written as (with _dn__(_i_) the number of moles of component _i_ added to the system and, in this case, _μ__(_i_) the molar chemical potential) or as (with _dm__(_i_) the mass of component _i_ added to the system and, in this case, _μ__(_i_) the specific chemical potential).

Cardinal functions

The enthalpy, , expresses the thermodynamics of a system in the _energy-language_, or in the _energy representation_. As a function of state, its arguments include both one intensive and several extensive state variables. The state variables , , and } are said to be the _natural state variables_ in this representation. They are suitable for describing processes in which they are experimentally controlled. For example, in an idealized process, and can be controlled by preventing heat and matter transfer by enclosing the system with a wall that is adiathermal and impermeable to matter, and by making the process infinitely slow, and by varying only the external pressure on the piston that controls the volume of the system. This is the basis of the so-called adiabatic approximation that is used in meteorology.[18]

Alongside the enthalpy, with these arguments, the other cardinal function of state of a thermodynamic system is its entropy, as a function, , of the same list of variables of state, except that the entropy, , is replaced in the list by the enthalpy, . It expresses the _entropy representation_. The state variables , , and } are said to be the _natural state variables_ in this representation. They are suitable for describing processes in which they are experimentally controlled. For example, and can be controlled by allowing heat transfer, and by varying only the external pressure on the piston that sets the volume of the system.[19][20][21]


Physical interpretation

The _U_ term can be interpreted as the energy required to create the system, and the _pV_ term as the work that would be required to "make room" for the system if the pressure of the environment remained constant. When a system, for example, _n_ moles of a gas of volume _V_ at pressure _p_ and temperature _T_, is created or brought to its present state from absolute zero, energy must be supplied equal to its internal energy _U_ plus _pV_, where _pV_ is the work done in pushing against the ambient (atmospheric) pressure.

In basic physics and statistical mechanics it may be more interesting to study the internal properties of the system and therefore the internal energy is used.[22][23] In basic chemistry, experiments are often conducted at constant atmospheric pressure, and the pressure-volume work represents an energy exchange with the atmosphere that cannot be accessed or controlled, so that Δ_H_ is the expression chosen for the heat of reaction.

For a heat engine a change in its internal energy is the difference between the heat input and the pressure-volume work done by the working substance while a change in its enthalpy is the difference between the heat input and the work done by the engine:[24]

_d__H_ = _δ__Q_ − _δ__W_
where the work W done by the engine is:

_W_ =  − ∮_p__d__V_


Relationship to heat

In order to discuss the relation between the enthalpy increase and heat supply, we return to the first law for closed systems, with the physics sign convention: , where the heat _δQ_ is supplied by conduction, radiation, and Joule heating. We apply it to the special case with a constant pressure at the surface. In this case the work term can be split into two contributions, the so-called _pV_ work, given by (where here _p_ is the pressure at the surface, _dV_ is the increase of the volume of the system), and the so-called isochoric mechanical work _δW′_, such as stirring by a shaft with paddles or by an externally driven magnetic field acting on an internal rotor. Cases of long range electromagnetic interaction require further state variables in their formulation, and are not considered here. So we write . In this case the first law reads:

_d__U_ = _δ__Q_ − _p_ _d__V_ − _δ__W_′.

Now,

_d__H_ = _d__U_ + _d_(_p__V_).

So

_d__H_ = _δ__Q_ + _V_ _d__p_ + _p_ _d__V_ − _p_ _d__V_ − _δ__W_′

   = _δ__Q_ + _V_ _d__p_ − _δ__W_′.

With sign convention of physics, _δW_' < 0, because isochoric shaft work done by an external device on the system adds energy to the system, and may be viewed as virtually adding heat. The only thermodynamic mechanical work done by the system is expansion work, _p dV_.[25]

The system is under constant pressure (_dp_ = 0). Consequently, the increase in enthalpy of the system is equal to the added heat and virtual heat:

_d__H_ = _δ__Q_ − _δ__W_′.

This is why the now obsolete term _heat content_ was used in the nineteenth century.


Applications

In thermodynamics, one can calculate enthalpy by determining the requirements for creating a system from "nothingness"; the mechanical work required, _pV_, differs based upon the conditions that obtain during the creation of the thermodynamic system.

Energy must be supplied to remove particles from the surroundings to make space for the creation of the system, assuming that the pressure _p_ remains constant; this is the _pV_ term. The supplied energy must also provide the change in internal energy, _U_, which includes activation energies, ionization energies, mixing energies, vaporization energies, chemical bond energies, and so forth. Together, these constitute the change in the enthalpy _U_ + _pV_. For systems at constant pressure, with no external work done other than the _pV_ work, the change in enthalpy is the heat received by the system.

For a simple system, with a constant number of particles, the difference in enthalpy is the maximum amount of thermal energy derivable from a thermodynamic process in which the pressure is held constant.[26]

Heat of reaction

The total enthalpy of a system cannot be measured directly, the _enthalpy change_ of a system is measured instead. Enthalpy change is defined by the following equation:

_Δ__H_ = _H__(_f_) − _H__(_i_),

where

    Δ_H_ is the "enthalpy change",
    _H__(f) is the final enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction, the enthalpy of the products),
    _H__(i) is the initial enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction, the enthalpy of the reactants).

For an exothermic reaction at constant pressure, the system's change in enthalpy equals the energy released in the reaction, including the energy retained in the system and lost through expansion against its surroundings. In a similar manner, for an endothermic reaction, the system's change in enthalpy is equal to the energy _absorbed_ in the reaction, including the energy _lost by_ the system and _gained_ from compression from its surroundings. If Δ_H_ is positive, the reaction is endothermic, that is heat is absorbed by the system due to the products of the reaction having a greater enthalpy than the reactants. On the other hand, if Δ_H_ is negative, the reaction is exothermic, that is the overall decrease in enthalpy is achieved by the generation of heat.[27]

From the definition of enthalpy as H = U + pV, the enthalpy change at constant pressure ΔH = ΔU + pΔV. However for most chemical reactions, the work term pΔV is much smaller than the internal energy change ΔU which is approximately equal to ΔH. As an example, for the combustion of carbon monoxide 2 CO(g) + O₂(g) → 2 CO₂(g), ΔH = –566.0 kJ and ΔU = –563.5 kJ.[28] Since the differences are so small, reaction enthalpies are often loosely described as reaction energies and analyzed in terms of bond energies.

Specific enthalpy

The specific enthalpy of a uniform system is defined as _h_ = where _m_ is the mass of the system. The SI unit for specific enthalpy is joule per kilogram. It can be expressed in other specific quantities by , where _u_ is the specific internal energy, _p_ is the pressure, and _v_ is specific volume, which is equal to , where _ρ_ is the density.

Enthalpy changes

An enthalpy change describes the change in enthalpy observed in the constituents of a thermodynamic system when undergoing a transformation or chemical reaction. It is the difference between the enthalpy after the process has completed, i.e. the enthalpy of the products, and the initial enthalpy of the system, i.e. the reactants. These processes are reversible and the enthalpy for the reverse process is the negative value of the forward change.

A common standard enthalpy change is the enthalpy of formation, which has been determined for a large number of substances. Enthalpy changes are routinely measured and compiled in chemical and physical reference works, such as the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. The following is a selection of enthalpy changes commonly recognized in thermodynamics.

When used in these recognized terms the qualifier _change_ is usually dropped and the property is simply termed _enthalpy of 'process_'. Since these properties are often used as reference values it is very common to quote them for a standardized set of environmental parameters, or standard conditions, including:

-   A temperature of 25 °C or 298.15 K,
-   A pressure of one atmosphere (1 atm or 101.325 kPa),
-   A concentration of 1.0 M when the element or compound is present in solution,
-   Elements or compounds in their normal physical states, i.e. standard state.

For such standardized values the name of the enthalpy is commonly prefixed with the term _standard_, e.g. _standard enthalpy of formation_.

-   Enthalpy of mixing, defined as the enthalpy change upon mixing of two (non-reacting) chemical substances.

Open systems

In thermodynamic open systems, matter may flow in and out of the system boundaries. The first law of thermodynamics for open systems states: The increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by matter flowing in and by heating, minus the amount lost by matter flowing out and in the form of work done by the system:

_d__U_ = _δ__Q_ + _d__U__(in) − _d__U__(out) − _δ__W_,

where _U__(in) is the average internal energy entering the system, and _U__(out) is the average internal energy leaving the system.

operation, an energy balance applied to an open system equates shaft work performed by the system to heat added plus net enthalpy added]]

The region of space enclosed by the boundaries of the open system is usually called a control volume, and it may or may not correspond to physical walls. If we choose the shape of the control volume such that all flow in or out occurs perpendicular to its surface, then the flow of matter into the system performs work as if it were a piston of fluid pushing mass into the system, and the system performs work on the flow of matter out as if it were driving a piston of fluid. There are then two types of work performed: _flow work_ described above, which is performed on the fluid (this is also often called _pV work_), and _shaft work_, which may be performed on some mechanical device.

These two types of work are expressed in the equation

    δW = d(p_(out)V_(out)) − d(p_(in)V_(in)) + δW_(shaft).

Substitution into the equation above for the control volume (cv) yields:

    dU_(cv) = δQ + dU_(in) + d(p_(in)V_(in)) − dU_(out) − d(p_(out)V_(out)) − δW_(shaft).

The definition of enthalpy, _H_, permits us to use this thermodynamic potential to account for both internal energy and _pV_ work in fluids for open systems:

    dU_(cv) = δQ + dH_(in) − dH_(out) − δW_(shaft).

If we allow also the system boundary to move (e.g. due to moving pistons), we get a rather general form of the first law for open systems.[29] In terms of time derivatives it reads:

    $\frac{dU}{dt} = \sum_k \dot Q_k + \sum_k \dot H_k - \sum_k p_k\frac{dV_k}{dt} - P,$

with sums over the various places _k_ where heat is supplied, matter flows into the system, and boundaries are moving. The _Ḣ_(k)_ terms represent enthalpy flows, which can be written as

_Ḣ__(_k_) = _h__(_k_)_ṁ__(_k_) = _H__(_m_)_ṅ__(_k_),

with _ṁ_(k)_ the mass flow and _ṅ_(k)_ the molar flow at position _k_ respectively. The term represents the rate of change of the system volume at position _k_ that results in _pV_ power done by the system. The parameter _P_ represents all other forms of power done by the system such as shaft power, but it can also be e.g. electric power produced by an electrical power plant.

Note that the previous expression holds true only if the kinetic energy flow rate is conserved between system inlet and outlet. Otherwise, it has to be included in the enthalpy balance. During steady-state operation of a device (_see turbine, pump, and engine_), the average may be set equal to zero. This yields a useful expression for the average power generation for these devices in the absence of chemical reactions:

$$P = \sum_k \left\langle \dot Q_k \right\rangle
+ \sum_k \left\langle \dot H_k \right\rangle
- \sum_k \left\langle p_k\frac{dV_k}{dt} \right\rangle,$$

where the angle brackets denote time averages. The technical importance of the enthalpy is directly related to its presence in the first law for open systems, as formulated above.

The specific points A, B, etc., are treated in the main text.]]

The enthalpy values of important substances can be obtained using commercial software. Practically all relevant material properties can be obtained either in tabular or in graphical form. There are many types of diagrams, such as _h_–_T_ diagrams, which give the specific enthalpy as function of temperature for various pressures, and _h_–_p_ diagrams, which give _h_ as function of _p_ for various _T_. One of the most common diagrams is the temperature–specific entropy diagram (_T_–_s_-diagram). It gives the melting curve and saturated liquid and vapor values together with isobars and isenthalps. These diagrams are powerful tools in the hands of the thermal engineer.

Some basic applications

The points A through H in the figure play a role in the discussion in this section.

    A: _T_ = 300 K, _p_ = 1 bar, _s_ = 6.85 kJ/(kg K), _h_ = 461 kJ/kg;
    B: _T_ = 380 K, _p_ = 2 bar, _s_ = 6.85 kJ/(kg K), _h_ = 530 kJ/kg;
    C: _T_ = 300 K, _p_ = 200 bar, _s_ = 5.16 kJ/(kg K), _h_ = 430 kJ/kg;
    D: _T_ = 270 K, _p_ = 1 bar, _s_ = 6.79 kJ/(kg K), _h_ = 430 kJ/kg;
    E: _T_ = 108 K, _p_ = 13 bar, _s_ = 3.55 kJ/(kg K), _h_ = 100 kJ/kg (saturated liquid at 13 bar);
    F: _T_ = 77.2 K, _p_ = 1 bar, _s_ = 3.75 kJ/(kg K), _h_ = 100 kJ/kg;
    G: _T_ = 77.2 K, _p_ = 1 bar, _s_ = 2.83 kJ/(kg K), _h_ = 28 kJ/kg (saturated liquid at 1 bar);
    H: _T_ = 77.2 K, _p_ = 1 bar, _s_ = 5.41 kJ/(kg K), _h_ = 230 kJ/kg (saturated gas at 1 bar);

Throttling

One of the simple applications of the concept of enthalpy is the so-called throttling process, also known as Joule-Thomson expansion. It concerns a steady adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance (valve, porous plug, or any other type of flow resistance) as shown in the figure. This process is very important, since it is at the heart of domestic refrigerators, where it is responsible for the temperature drop between ambient temperature and the interior of the refrigerator. It is also the final stage in many types of liquefiers.

For a steady state flow regime, the enthalpy of the system (dotted rectangle) has to be constant. Hence

0 = _ṁ__h_₁ − _ṁ__h_₂.

Since the mass flow is constant, the specific enthalpies at the two sides of the flow resistance are the same:

_h_₁ = _h_₂,

that is, the enthalpy per unit mass does not change during the throttling. The consequences of this relation can be demonstrated using the _T_–_s_ diagram above. Point C is at 200 bar and room temperature (300 K). A Joule–Thomson expansion from 200 bar to 1 bar follows a curve of constant enthalpy of roughly 425 kJ/kg (not shown in the diagram) lying between the 400 and 450 kJ/kg isenthalps and ends in point D, which is at a temperature of about 270 K. Hence the expansion from 200 bar to 1 bar cools nitrogen from 300 K to 270 K. In the valve, there is a lot of friction, and a lot of entropy is produced, but still the final temperature is below the starting value!

Point E is chosen so that it is on the saturated liquid line with . It corresponds roughly with and . Throttling from this point to a pressure of 1 bar ends in the two-phase region (point F). This means that a mixture of gas and liquid leaves the throttling valve. Since the enthalpy is an extensive parameter, the enthalpy in F (_h__(F)) is equal to the enthalpy in G (_h__(G)) multiplied by the liquid fraction in F (_x__(F)) plus the enthalpy in H (_h__(H)) multiplied by the gas fraction in F . So

_h__(F) = _x__(F)_h__(G) + (1 − _x__(F))_h__(H).

With numbers: , so _x__(F) = 0.64. This means that the mass fraction of the liquid in the liquid–gas mixture that leaves the throttling valve is 64%.

Compressors

A power _P_ is applied e.g. as electrical power. If the compression is adiabatic, the gas temperature goes up. In the reversible case it would be at constant entropy, which corresponds with a vertical line in the _T_–_s_ diagram. For example, compressing nitrogen from 1 bar (point A) to 2 bar (point B) would result in a temperature increase from 300 K to 380 K. In order to let the compressed gas exit at ambient temperature _T__(a), heat exchange, e.g. by cooling water, is necessary. In the ideal case the compression is isothermal. The average heat flow to the surroundings is _Q̇_. Since the system is in the steady state the first law gives

0 =  − _Q̇_ + _ṁ__h_₁ − _ṁ__h_₂ + _P_.

The minimal power needed for the compression is realized if the compression is reversible. In that case the second law of thermodynamics for open systems gives

$$0 = -\frac{\dot Q}{T_\mathrm{a}} + \dot m s_1 - \dot m s_2.$$

Eliminating _Q̇_ gives for the minimal power

$$\frac{P_\text{min}}{\dot m} = h_2 - h_1 - T_\mathrm{a}(s_2 - s_1).$$

For example, compressing 1 kg of nitrogen from 1 bar to 200 bar costs at least . With the data, obtained with the _T_–_s_ diagram, we find a value of 476 kJ/kg.

The relation for the power can be further simplified by writing it as

$$\frac{P_\text{min}}{\dot m} = \int_1^2(dh - T_\mathrm{a}\,ds).$$

With , this results in the final relation

$$\frac{P_\text{min}}{\dot m} = \int_1^2 v\,dp.$$
