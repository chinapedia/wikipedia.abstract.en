History

On the rocky back of "Purgstallhöhe" mountain stood the castle Grauscharn (also Gruscharn, slav. Grusch = _Geröll_) from the Middle Ages. This was already in 1160 the Pfalzburg by Margrave Ottokar III, and thus dominion center for the county Ennstal. The village "Gruscharn", which had formed within sight of the castle, was finally called "Stainach" in 1659. The local community of Stainach, as an autonomous body, was established in 1850.

From the area of the former castle Grau-Scharn, today only the St. Johns chapel (_Johanneskapelle_) has remained, which was built in the 12th century. The style of their paintings indicates their origin to 1160/65,[4] which the existing building confirms. Already in 1183 are on the Church and Castle Burgstall. Pürgg was returned to this parish and was originally the seat of an archdeacon (archpriest). The parish _Sprengel_ extended once far beyond Aussee lake. In 1490 the parish was owned by the Knights of St. George, in 1599 by the Jesuits of Graz. Since 1958, the then independent Stainach site has also been the seat of its own parish.

Construction of the Enns Valley Railway in 1875 opened up the present hamlets Stainach and Trautenfels with suitable rail stops. The trainstop in Trautenfels was leveled however in the year 2007. The construction of the Salzkammergut railway in 1877, also a bus stop in Pürgg and Stainach station (now called Stainach-Irdning) emerged and became the railway junction.

After the annexation of Austria in 1938, today's municipal territory came to the Reichsgau of Styria. From 1945 to 1955, it was part of the British occupation zone in Austria. Since then, the municipal area belonges to Styria.

The town Stainach-Pürgg, in its present form, was created only at the beginning of the year 2015. It was part of the Styrian municipality structural reform, in which the independent municipalities Stainach and Pürgg-Trautenfels were merged.
