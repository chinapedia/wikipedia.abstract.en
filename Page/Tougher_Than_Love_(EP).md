Critical reception

Mike Bell of the _Calgary Herald_ wrote that the record is "very much a complete and well-crafted album," despite comprising only six songs. He also said that, while the collection is "stylistically... all over the map," it is tied together by "Wills's steady voice and likable personality."[9]

_Tougher Than Love_ was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2016 Canadian Country Music Association Awards.[10] "Won't You Be Mine" was nominated for Single of the Year at the same awards ceremony, with Wills also receiving a nomination for the song in the category of Songwriter of the Year.[11] He lost all three awards.[12]
