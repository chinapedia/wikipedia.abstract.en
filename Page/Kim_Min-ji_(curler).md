KIM MIN-JI is a South Korean curler.

Kim skipped the South Korean junior team at the 2016 World Junior Curling Championships. She led her team of Kim Hye-rin, Yang Tae-i, Oh Su-yun and Lee Ji-young to a bronze medal finish. After finishing the round robin with a 7-2 record, the team lost to Hungary (skipped by Dorottya Palancsa) in the 3 vs. 4 page playoff game, but went on to beat the Hungarians in a re-match in the bronze medal game, after Hungary lost in the semi-final.

Kim began skipping a team on the World Curling Tour in 2016. She won her first tour event by claiming the 2016 Hub International Crown of Curling.

Kim, and teammates Kim Hye-rin, Yang and Kim Su-jin represented Korea at the 2017 World Junior Curling Championships. The team posted a 5-4 round robin record, tied with Switzerland for fourth. They would beat the Swiss in a tiebreaker, before losing two straight games against Canada to finish in 4th place. This same team represented Korea at the 2018 World Junior Curling Championships. There, Kim led the team to a 4-5 record, missing the playoffs.

Kim began the 2018-19 curling season by winning the Hokkaido Bank Curling Classic. Then she and her team won gold on 2018 Pacific-Asia Curling Championships, earning South Korea a berth into the 2019 World Women's Curling Championship.

She and her team have participated in the 2018–19 Curling World Cup: they played in the First Leg with 1-5 record, placed 7-8th out of playoffs. She returned to the 2018-19 Curling World Cup later that year and competed in the Second Leg. She and her team made it all the way to the final falling just short to Japan’s Satsuki Fujisawa 7-6. Her team improved on this performance by winning the Third Leg against Sweden's Anna Hasselborg rink. In the Grand Final, the team finished with a 2-4 record.

Her team, still junior eligible represented Korea at the 2019 World Junior Curling Championships. They finished the round robin with a 6-3 record, which was tied with three other teams for the second best record. However, they missed the playoffs due to tiebreaker rules. The following month, the team represented Korea at the 2019 Winter Universiade. This time their 6-3 record was enough to make the playoffs, where they made it all the way to the final before losing to Sweden. Later that month, the team had yet another international event to play in, the 2019 World Championship. The team was even better on this stage, finishing the round robin with a 9-3 record, in second place. In the playoffs, they lost to Switzerland's Silvana Tirinzoni rink in the semifinal, but rebounded to win the bronze medal game against Seina Nakajima of Japan. It was the first ever medal won by Korea at the Women's World Championship.[1]
