Career

San Diego Padres

Lockett spent 2012 with the AZL Padres, pitching to a 4.34 ERA in innings. He pitched only innings in 2013 and innings in 2014 due to injuries.[7] Lockett returned in 2015 and pitched for the Fort Wayne TinCaps, Tri-City Dust Devils, and AZL Padres, posting a combined 4-4 record and 4.14 ERA in 18 total games (17 starts) between the three clubs.
