The SANCTUARY OF THE MADONNA DEL BOSCO (Our Lady of the Forest) is a Roman Catholic sanctuary church outside of Imbersago, province of Lecco, region of Lombardy, Italy.


History

Madonna_del_Bosco_-_Scalinata.jpg The church was built between 1641 and 1644 by the architect Carlo Buzzi. Tradition holds that at the site, a mother whose child was being attacked by wolves, called to the Virgin, who appeared and saved the child from the wolf-attack. In the 20th century, Pope John XXIII named it a Minor Basilica.

The layout is octagonal, typical of 15th-century Marian shrines in Lombardy. The complex was enlarged in 1677 and 1888. The interior has a three lobed nave with a presbytery with a balustrade.

The main altarpiece is a depiction of the _Madonna and Child above a grove of Chestnut trees_ (1888). In the left nave is an altarpiece depicting a _Piet√†_, attributed to the studio of the Campi.

The sanctuary can be accessed via the 392 steps of the Scala Santa. Most are linear steps until the end with a scenic sweep of two arms. At the top is a modern bronze statue of Pope John XXIII by Enrico Manfrini. Below the belvedere, is a crypt with a stucco depiction of the founding miracle.[1]
