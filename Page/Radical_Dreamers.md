[1] is a Japanese video game developed by Square in 1996 for the Satellaview add-on for the Super Famicom.[2][3] It is a text-based visual novel in which the player takes the role of Serge, a young adventurer accompanied by Kid, a teen-aged thief, and Gil, a mysterious masked magician.

The game belongs to the _Chrono_ series and is a _gaiden_, or side story, to the 1995 game _Chrono Trigger_. It was released to complement its predecessor's plot, and later served as inspiration for _Chrono Cross_.[4] It features text-based gameplay with minimal graphics and sound effects, and was scored by composer Yasunori Mitsuda.[5] Unlike many Satellaview titles, _Radical Dreamers_ was not designed to lock after a certain number of playthroughs, so players owning an 8M Memory Pack onto which the game was downloaded can still play today.

Square tried to integrate _Radical Dreamers_ into the Japanese PlayStation port of _Chrono Trigger_ as an Easter egg.[6] Writer and director Masato Kato halted this and other releases, unhappy with the quality of his work.[7] Though the game was never officially released abroad, ROM hackers completed an English fan translation in 2003.[8][9]


Gameplay

Gameplay consists of word-based scenarios presented to the player through the narration of the main character, Serge. As the narrative progresses, the game presents a list of possible actions and the player must choose his or her course. Depending on the choices made, the player may enter a new area, be presented with a new situation or character, or have to choose again if the previous selection was incorrect.[10] In combat with enemies, the player must select from options such as "Fight", "Magic", "Run", and often more complex situational commands like "Run my knife into the goblin's chest!" or "Quickly slash at its hand!".[11] Some decisions must be made before an invisible timer runs out; in combat, hesitation results in injury or death. Serge's health is tracked by an invisible point count, restored by various events (such as finding a potion). The game also tracks Kid's affection for Serge, influenced by battles and scripted events.[12] Her feelings determine whether Serge survives the story's climactic fight.

_Radical Dreamers_ features minimal graphics and animation; most areas are rendered with dim, static backgrounds. The game also uses atmospheric music and sounds. Like other _Chrono_ games, _Radical Dreamers_ contains a variant of New Game + mode. Only one scenario is available on the first play-through; after finishing it and obtaining one of three possible endings, players can explore six others. These later stories often feature comical situations or allusions to _Chrono Trigger_.[13]


Characters and story

_Radical Dreamers_ features three protagonists—Serge, Kid, and Magil—who seek out treasure as venturesome, reputable thieves. The young adult narrator, Serge, is a drifting musician who met Kid by chance three years ago in a remote town.[14] Serge enjoys adventure with a carefree attitude.[15] Kid, only sixteen years old, is a renowned professional thief with a reputation for boisterous behavior.[16] Possessing a turbulent history, Kid dubiously fancies herself as a kind of Robin Hood. Magil is an enigmatic, handsome masked man skilled in magic who rarely speaks and can fade into shadow at will.[17] Crowned by flowing, blue hair, Magil accompanied Kid well before Serge joined the group.[18] They seek the Frozen Flame, a mythic artifact capable of granting any wish.[19] It is hidden in Viper Manor—the home of a terrible and powerful aristocrat named Lynx, who gained control of the estate after usurping power from and killing the Acacia Dragoons, a familial unit of warriors.[20]

Radical_Dreamers_Frozen_Flame.png Following Kid, the group infiltrates Viper Manor on the night of a full moon. While sneaking through the corridors, they battle goblins and other creatures of legend while unraveling the history of the manor and its occupants. Magil explains that the Frozen Flame is a fragment of the massive, extraterrestrial creature known as Lavos, splintered off when Lavos impacted the planet in prehistory and burrowed to its core.[21] The thieves locate Lynx and the Frozen Flame deep within an underground ruin of the Kingdom of Zeal—an ancient, airborne civilization destroyed after it awakened Lavos in search of immortality.[22] Serge discovers that Kid is an orphan, hoping to exact revenge upon Lynx for killing her caretaker, Lucca. Kid attempted to find Lynx in her childhood after Lucca's death, but was stopped and saved from certain defeat by Magil, who accompanied her thereafter.

The trio battle Lynx for the Frozen Flame, and Lynx gains the upper hand after trapping Magil with a powerful spell. He plans to acquire Kid's special gift from Lucca—a Time Egg, or Chrono Trigger.[23] With a Time Egg and the Frozen Flame, Lynx boasts that he shall achieve control over time. Kid lunges at him, but Lynx easily parries her attack and wounds her. She desperately removes the Chrono Trigger from her back pocket. The Trigger shatters and causes a localized temporal distortion, leading Serge to see various scenes in history. Kid learns of her heritage as princess Schala of Zeal, a meek girl who was coerced to help awaken Lavos with her magical power.[24] As Zeal collapsed, Schala was wracked with anguish and guilt for her role in the incident. Nearby in the Ocean Palace, the Frozen Flame felt her grief and changed her to a baby, sending her to the modern era where Lucca found her.[25] It is also circumstantially revealed that Magil is in fact Magus, Schala's wayward brother who searched for her after battling Lavos in _Chrono Trigger_.[26] Once the distortion subsides, an army from Porre—a large nation in search of the Frozen Flame—storms the mansion. Lynx withdraws as Kid, Serge, and Magil flee. Kid tells Serge that she is aware of her true origin, and knowing that is a treasure which cannot be stolen.[27] She bids him goodbye before disappearing into the darkness with Magil.

Other scenarios are available after players complete the first. These include both humorous and serious variations of the main plot.[28][29]

-   "Magil: Caught Between Love and Adventure" – Magil is actually a lifelong friend of Riddel who courts her. When the manor is alerted to his presence, Magil throws Riddel over his shoulder and dashes off into the morning sun as her proud father Lynx tearily bids goodbye.[30]
-   "Kid and the Sunflower" – Kid insults a lecherous sunflower who transforms her into a malicious monster. Serge must kiss her to change her back, or use a special dagger to take her soul at risk of his own soul's capture. Three endings are available.[31]
-   "SuperXtreme Alphacosmos Police Case EX Ultra" – Magil is a space cop searching for Lynx, secretly a green Martian creature with tentacles. Magil's rock guitar forces Lynx out of hiding, and Serge assaults him with a Martian Forest League Concealed Lesser Armament Bunny.[32]
-   "Homecoming: Shea's Light" – Kid learns that Lynx and her caretaker Shea are trapped in a magical seal as part of Lynx's effort to escape a spirit prison. Shea selflessly instructs Magil to destroy the Frozen Flame, killing Lynx forever.[33]
-   "The Enigmatic Gigaweapon: Paradise X" – Serge finds an odd crystal inhabited by an entity named Gange, who tests his strength with gladiatorial combat. Using Gange's Paradise X mecha, Serge and Gange challenge Mecha-Lynx for the Frozen Flame.[34]
-   "The Shadow Realm and the Goddess of Death" – Kid accidentally summons Lilith, the Goddess of Death. She tries to take Kid's soul, but Magil intervenes. The outcome is slightly affected by Kid's affection for Serge.[35]


Development

Masato Kato wrote _Radical Dreamers_ after _Chrono Trigger_'s release, feeling that _Trigger_ concluded with "unfinished business".[36] He composed the main story and drafted the concepts for the sub-scenarios, leaving them to be completed by his peers.[37] He allowed Makoto Shimamoto to write the entire "Kid and the Sunflower" segment, later joking that he "avoided having any part in that episode,"[38] while Miwa Shoda was in charge of the "Shadow Realm and the Goddess of Death" segment.[39] According to scenario writer Daisuke Fukugawa (responsible for the game's "The Enigmatic Gigaweapon: Paradise X" subplot), the game's graphical content pushed the Satellaview's technical limits, requiring developers to redraw prerendered models until functional gameplay could be ensured.[40] Kato remarked that his "savage feelings" from _Chrono Trigger_'s hectic development manifested in Kid's "unusually nihilistic attitude".[41] He explained his approach towards the project in 1999:

Kato's team completed _Radical Dreamers_ in only three months under a rushed production schedule, prompting him to label the game "unfinished" in an interview for the _Ultimania_ _Chrono Cross_ guide.[42][43] Kato regretted that the schedule hampered the quality of his work, and explained that the connections to _Chrono Trigger_ were evoked towards the end of the project:

Music

The music of _Radical Dreamers_ was written by composer Yasunori Mitsuda, who scored _Chrono Trigger_ and later _Chrono Cross_.[44] The soundtrack includes several ambient pieces, including the sound of water running in a fountain and wind accompanied by strings. Players can listen to the game's songs by accessing a hidden menu in the "Gil: Caught Between Love and Adventure" scenario.[45] Several themes and musical patterns were later adapted for _Chrono Cross_ on the suggestion of director Masato Kato; many appear unchanged except for new instrumentation.[46]


Fan translation

In April 2003, the ROM hacking group Demiforce released a fan translation rendering _Radical Dreamers_ in English.[47] The patch works by modifying the ROM image of _Dreamers_ used for playing console-based video games on personal computers through emulation. The ability to save games was not enabled with the first patch, and some minor typos were left in, later remedied by successive releases.[48] On Christmas Day 2005, Demiforce and Radical R released the final version (1.4) of the translation, which fixed remaining minor bugs.[49] The French team Terminus Traduction made a French translation patch soon after.[50] Masato Kato did not perceive significant demand to include _Radical Dreamers_ as a bonus with the release of _Chrono Trigger DS_, and omitted it to preserve continuity between _Trigger_ and _Cross_.[51] He expressed concern in 2009 over re-releasing _Radical Dreamers_ "as-is", citing a need to revise the work.[52]

A reviewer for Home of the Underdogs lauded the game's excellent writing and the "superb" English translation patch, noting that the "interesting plot" would appeal to fantasy fans if they could stomach the limited interactivity.[53] Having never played a _Chrono_ game prior, the reviewer stated, "I was still able to follow the story and be drawn into the world of colorful characters."[54] While praising the replay value afforded by the extra scenarios, the critic derided the random battles of _Radical Dreamers_, writing that "RPG-style random combat doesn't translate well to [a] text-only medium."[55] The website awarded _Dreamers_ "Top Dog" status, and the game maintains a voter score of 8.95 out of 10.[56]

_Radical Dreamers_ preceded _Chrono Cross_, a full role-playing video game sequel to _Chrono Trigger_. Masato Kato cited the desire to "redo _Radical Dreamers_ properly" as the genesis of _Cross_, attributing the latter's serious atmosphere to the influence of _Dreamers_.[57][58] Kato's desire to finish the story of the characters Kid and Serge principally shaped the plot of _Cross_.[59] _Chrono Cross_ borrowed certain thematic elements, story points, characters, music, and objects introduced in _Radical Dreamers_—including the infiltration of Viper Manor, the Frozen Flame, the name _Radical Dreamers_ for Kid's thievery, and the characters of Kid, Lynx, and Serge (who became a non-speaking protagonist).[60][61] Though these characters and items were not presented in the same context, their general traits survived the transition.[62] Gil, confirmed by Kato to be Magus, was also going to be featured in _Chrono Cross_. This idea was scrapped due to difficulties in representing the story of Magus among the game's numerous other characters; the unrelated, enigmatic magician Guile was created instead.[63] Since the release of _Chrono Cross_, _Radical Dreamers_ is considered an alternate continuity of the _Chrono_ series.[64] _Chrono Cross_ addressed this through an easter egg hinting that _Radical Dreamers_ took place in a different dimension. In the English version of _Chrono Cross_, this easter egg refers to Gil as "Magil".[65] Kato intended _Dreamers_ and _Cross_ to prompt players to pursue their personal dreams in life.[66]
