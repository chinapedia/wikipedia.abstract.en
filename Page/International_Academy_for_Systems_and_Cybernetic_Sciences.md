The INTERNATIONAL ACADEMY FOR SYSTEMS AND CYBERNETIC SCIENCES (IASCYS) is an honor society initially created by the International Federation for Systems Research (IFSR). The academy identifies outstanding scientists in systems and cybernetics and elects them as academicians.[1] The members of the Academy conduct workshops and speak at conferences[2] about advances in the field.


Origin

In 2010, the International Federation for Systems Research established an international non-profit association called The International Academy for Systems and Cybernetic Sciences. For 6 years the IASCYS was governed as an IFSR partner organization, but in 2016 it became an independent organization having its own statutes, rules of procedure and membership criteria.[3][4]


Aims

IASCYS was founded to honor and activate outstanding members of the systems and cybernetics community. The fields of systems and cybernetics emphasize a holistic perspective, thus we help people create points of view that describe more of the variety in the world, and thus our work bridges and fills the spaces between the descriptions from traditional sciences. Systems science and cybernetics, in both theory and application, facilitate transdisciplinary cooperation leading to insights into synergies and generalizations and the creation of methods for coping with situations that the traditional sciences fail to cover. Thus, the otherwise resulting oversights are replaced by new insights. These intellectual endeavors help people as individuals, their organizations, and humankind to attain a more complete appreciation, through perception, thinking, emotional and spiritual life, decision making, communication, and action, and therefore to attain more success and well being. Academicians are nominated[5] by an association in the field. Biographies of IASCYS members are published on the IASCYS web-site.[6][7]


Motivations

National and international academies of sciences and arts previously did not include the contributions of systems and cybernetics in their list of sciences and arts. This situation overlooks the contributions which these fields have made to many traditional fields. IASCYS was created to build bridges among the member associations, to identify the most qualified scientists and practitioners in the field in order to invite them as keynote speakers to conferences, to recognize systems and cybernetics as sciences equal to other sciences, and to create links among the leading members of the systems and cybernetics community with the intent to aid and promote the development of these fields.[8][9]


Intentions

Two missions of the IASCYS are, through coordination of the actions of the member associations, to create an internationally accepted curriculum in systems and cybernetics and to create an auditing process aimed at validation and promotion of education in systems and cybernetics.[10][11]
