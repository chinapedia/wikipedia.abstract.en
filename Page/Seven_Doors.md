Reception

Michael Billington of _The Guardian_ wrote in 2004, when the play was produced for the Minerva Theatre in Chichester: "What makes one warm to Strauss is his ability to satirise his own bleak view of individual desperation and social decline. ... What unites these sketches is the idea that collectively we live on the brink of destruction while individually our lives are increasingly robbed of dignity. ... Even if you don't buy into Strauss's absurdist philosophy, there is a contrapuntal gaiety to his pessimism."[2]
