WILLIAM FRANCIS "FRANK" JOHNSTON, (born 29 June 1930) is a Anglican priest and military chaplain. Between 1980 and 1986, he served as Chaplain-General to the Forces and head of the Royal Army Chaplains' Department, British Army.


Early life and education

Johnston was born on 29 June 1930.[1] He was educated at Wesley College, a Methodist private school in Dublin, Ireland.[2] He studied at Trinity College, Dublin, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1955; as per tradition, his BA was promoted to a Master of Arts (MA Dubl) in 1969.[3]


Ordained ministry

Johnston was ordained in the Church of Ireland as a deacon in 1955 and as a priest in 1956.[4] From 1955 to 1959, he served his curacy at St John's Church, Orangefield, County Down in the Diocese of Down and Dromore.[5]

On 15 April 1959, Johnston was commissioned into the Royal Army Chaplains' Department (RAChD) as a Chaplain to the Forces 4th Class (equivalent in rank to captain).[6] He was posted to British Army of the Rhine and served as chaplain of the Garrison Church in Hamelin in Germany from 1962 to 1964.[7] From 1977 to 1980, he was Assistant Chaplain General of the South East District.[8] From 1980 to 1986, he served as Chaplain-General to the Forces and was therefore head of the RAChD.[9][10] As the most senior Anglican chaplain in the British Army, he also served as Archdeacon for the Army and therefore was granted the title _The Venerable_. During his military career, he saw service in the United Kingdom, Germany, Aden, and Cyprus.[11] He left the British Army in 1987.[12]

Rather than return to the Church of Ireland, Johnston remained in England and became a priest in the Church of England.[13] From 1987 to 1991, he was Priest-in-Charge of St Laurence's Church, Winslow in the Diocese of Oxford.[14][15] After his parish was merged with another, he served as Rector of the newly created benefice of Winslow with Great Horwood and Addington.[16][17] He was also Rural Dean of Claydon between 1989 and 1994.[18]

Johnston retired from full-time ministry in 1995.[19] Since then, he has lived in Devon and holds Permission to Officiate in the Diocese of Exeter.[20][21]


Personal life

In 1963, Johnston married Jennifer Morton. Together, they have two sons and one daughter.[22]

On 15 April 1980, Johnston was appointed an Honorary Chaplain to the Queen (QHC).[23] In the 1983 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB).[24]
