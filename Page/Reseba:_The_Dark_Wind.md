_RESEBA: THE DARK WIND_ () is a 2016 Iraqi film directed by Kurdish director Hussein Hassan. It made its world premiere as the opening film of the 4th Duhok International Film Festival on September 2016 and its international premiere as the closing film of the 21st Busan International Film Festival on October 15, 2016.[1][2][3][4]

During its screening at the Duhok International Film Festival, the film was received angrily by some in the audience as it struck close to still open wounds. Crowds flooded out before the end of the film, upset, believing the female lead Pero (who was captured and sold by the Islamic State and then raped) was killed in the film.[5][6]

On December 14, 2016, the Dubai Film Festival gave the Best Fiction Feature award to Hussein Hassan for this movie.[7] Diman Zandi also received the Special Jury Award as Best Actress at the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival for her performance.[8]

It was selected as the Iraqi entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated.[9][10]

It held its North American Premiere at Miami Film Festival 2017.
