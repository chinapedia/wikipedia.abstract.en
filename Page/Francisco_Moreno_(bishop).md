FRANCISCO MANUEL MORENO (born Monterrey, 13 August 1950) is a Mexican Anglican bishop. He is married to Esperanza and they have three children and three grandchildren.


Biography

Moreno was raised as a Roman Catholic but converted to the Anglican Church of Mexico when he was eight.

He studied for the ministry at the San Andr√©s Seminary in Mexico City, being ordained a deacon in 1972 and a priest in 1974, for the Diocese of Northern Mexico.

He was bishop of Northern Mexico, since 5 March 2010, when he was elected Archbishop and Primate of the Anglican Church of Mexico at their 7th General Synod on 14 June 2013, with his installation taking place two days later.[1]

He is seen as a moderate in the context of the current divisions of the Anglican Communion, being friendly with the liberal pro-LGBT provinces, but still opposing civil same-sex marriages and the religious blessing of same-sex unions as the official policy of the province.[2]
