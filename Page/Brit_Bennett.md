BRIT BENNETT is an American writer based in Los Angeles. Her debut novel _The Mothers_ (2016) was a _New York Times_ best-seller.[1]


Early life

Bennett was raised in Southern California and received an undergraduate degree in English from Stanford University. She later attended the University of Michigan for her M.F.A. She also studied at Oxford University.[2]


Career

While she was completing her M.F.A. at Michigan, Bennett's 2014 essay for Jezebel "I Don't Know What to Do With Good White People"[3] gained considerable attention, generating over one million views in three days.[4] While at Michigan, she also won a Hopwood Award in Graduate Short Fiction as well as the 2014 Hurston/Wright Award for College Writers.[5]

She has since published other nonfiction essays, including a history of black dolls called "Addy Walker, American Girl" for the _Paris Review_,[6] as well as a review of the Ta-Nehisi Coates book _Between the World and Me_ for _The_ _New Yorker_.[7] _Vogue_ said Bennett's nonfiction essays "recall Ta-Nehisi Coates [with] a similar ability to contextualize the present moment in a bigoted past."[8]

_The Mothers_

In 2016, Riverhead Books published her debut novel _The Mothers_ to critical acclaim. _The New York Times_ said _The Mothers_ is "shaping up to be one of the fallâ€™s biggest literary debuts, with an initial printing of 108,000 copies and starred reviews in _Booklist_, _Library Journal_ and _Publishers Weekly_."[9] Bennett was named in the National Book Foundation "5 under 35"[10] list of promising debut novelists.[11] In March 2017 it was reported that _The Mothers_ had been tapped by Warner Bros. for a film adaptation, with Kerry Washington as a producer.[12]
