History

Golymki is known as a settlement since 1908, when it was made by a merger of five villages. The names of the four of them were Golynki, Glinyany, Skorokhody, and Ukhabnoye; the name of the fifth village is unknown.[1] The settlement belonged to Orshansky Uyezd of Mogilev Governorate.[2] In 1919, Mogilev Governorate was abolished, and Orshansky Uyezd was included into Gomel Governorate. In 1920, the uyezd was included into Vitebsk Governorate, and shortly the area was transferred to Smolensky Uyezd of Smolensk Governorate.[3]

On 12 July 1929, governorates and uyezds were abolished, and Rudnyansky District with the administrative center in Rudnya was established. The district belonged to Smolensk Okrug of Western Oblast. On August 1, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were subordinated directly to the oblast. On 27 September 1937 Western Oblast was abolished and split between Oryol and Smolensk Oblasts. Rudnyansky District was transferred to Smolensk Oblast. Between 1941 and September 1943, during WWII, the district was occupied by German troops.[4][5] In 1963, Golynki was granted the urban-type settlement status, and the population started to steadily increase due to the construction of the thermometer production plant.[6]
