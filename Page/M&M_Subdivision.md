The M&M SUBDIVISION is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in Alabama. The line runs from Montgomery, Alabama to Mobile, Alabama for a total of 178.2 miles. At its north end it continues south from the S&NA South Subdivision and at its south end it continues south as the NO&M Subdivision. There is also the Prattville Branch which runs from Montgomery, Alabama to Prattville, Alabama for a total of 12.0 miles.[1][2] The name M&M stands for the Mobile and Montgomery Railroad, which the line was part of in its history.


History

The first efforts to build the line that is now the M&M Subdivision began in 1836 when the Alabama and Florida Railroad received a land grant from the federal government for a rail line between Mobile and Montgomery, Alabama. Though, construction would not begin on the line until 1850. In 1868, the Alabama and Florida Railroad merged with the Mobile & Great Northern Railroad Company becoming the Mobile and Montgomery Railroad. The Mobile and Montgomery Railroad would be absorbed by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad in 1880.[3] The Louisville and Nashville Railroad was absorbed by the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad in 1982, which became CSX Transportation in 1986.

Big Bayou Canot accident

Sunset_Limited_Big_Bayout_Canot.png The M&M Subdivision is infamous for being the site of Amtrak's deadliest train crash in its history. On September 22, 1993 at 2:45 a.m., a barge lightly struck the line's bridge over Big Bayou Canot near Mobile. The bridge had been designed as a swing bridge but the center span was never operational and was not fully secured from movement when it was built. This caused the span to be displaced from the impact. Amtrak's _Sunset Limited_ crossed the bridge at full speed 8 minutes later and crashed into the bayou, killing 47 people.[4]
