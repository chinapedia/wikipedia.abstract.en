In mathematics, the BASS–QUILLEN CONJECTURE relates vector bundles over a regular Noetherian ring _A_ and over the polynomial ring A[t₁, …, t_(n)]. The conjecture is named for Hyman Bass and Daniel Quillen, who formulated the conjecture.[1][2]


Statement of the conjecture

The conjecture is a statement about finitely generated projective modules. Such modules are also referred to as vector bundles. For a ring _A_, the set of isomorphism classes of vector bundles over _A_ of rank _r_ is denoted by Vect_(r)(A).

The conjecture asserts that for a regular Noetherian ring _A_ the assignment

_M_ ↦ _M_⊗_(_A_)_A_[_t_₁, …, _t__(_n_)]
yields a bijection

$$\operatorname{Vect}_r(A) \stackrel \sim \to \operatorname{Vect}_r(A[t_1, \dots, t_n]).$$


Known cases

If _A_ = _k_ is a field, the Bass–Quillen conjecture asserts that any projective module over k[t₁, …, t_(n)] is free. This question was raised by Jean-Pierre Serre and was later proved by Quillen and Suslin, see Quillen–Suslin theorem. More generally, the conjecture was shown by in the case that _A_ is a smooth algebra over a field _k_. Further known cases are reviewed in .


Extensions

The set of isomorphism classes of vector bundles of rank _r_ over _A_ can also be identified with the nonabelian cohomology group

_H__(_N__i__s_)¹(_S__p__e__c_(_A_), _G__L__(_r_)).
Positive results about the homotopy invariance of

_H__(_N__i__s_)¹(_U_, _G_)
of isotropic reductive groups _G_ have been obtained by by means of A¹ homotopy theory.
