IRRELEVANT CONCLUSION,[1] also known as _IGNORATIO ELENCHI_ () or MISSING THE POINT, is the informal fallacy of presenting an argument that may or may not be logically valid and sound, but (whose conclusion) fails to address the issue in question. It falls into the broad class of relevance fallacies.[2]

Irrelevant conclusion should not be confused with formal fallacy, an argument whose conclusion does not follow from its premises.


Overview

_Ignoratio elenchi_ is one of the fallacies identified by Aristotle in his _Organon_. In a broader sense he asserted that all fallacies are a form of _ignoratio elenchi_.[3][4]

● EXAMPLE 1: A and B are debating as to whether criticizing indirectly has any merit in general.

    _A_: There is no point in people ranting on social media about politics; the president is not going to read it anyway.
    _B_: But it is their social media. People can agree on making a petition or convey notice from many others that they will be signing one based on their concerns.
    _A_: Well, I do not keep up with it anyway.

A attempts to support their position with an argument that politics ought not to be criticized on social media because the message is not directly being heard by the head of state; this would make them guilty of _ignoratio elenchi_, as people such as B may be criticizing politics because they have a strong message for their peers, or because they wish to bring attention to political matters, rather than ever intending that their views would be directly read by the president.[5]

● EXAMPLE 2: A and B are debating about the law.

    _A_: Does the law allow me to do that?
    _B_: The law _should_ allow you to do that because this and that.

B missed the point. The question was not if the law should allow, but if it does or not.

Dr Johnson's unique "refutation" of Bishop Berkeley's immaterialism, his claim that matter did not actually exist but only seemed to exist,[6] has been described as _ignoratio elenchi_:[7] during a conversation with Boswell, Johnson powerfully kicked a nearby stone and proclaimed of Berkeley's theory, "I refute it _thus_!"[8] (See also _argumentum ad lapidem_.)

A related concept is that of the red herring, which is a deliberate attempt to divert a process of enquiry by changing the subject.[9] _Ignoratio elenchi_ is sometimes confused with straw man argument.[10]


Etymology

The phrase _ignoratio elenchi_ is . Here _elenchi_ is the genitive singular of the Latin noun _elenchus_, which is .[11] The translation in English of the Latin expression has varied somewhat. Hamblin proposed "misconception of refutation" or "ignorance of refutation" as a literal translation,[12] John Arthur Oesterle preferred "ignoring the issue", and [13] Irving Copi, Christopher Tindale and others used "irrelevant conclusion".[14][15]
