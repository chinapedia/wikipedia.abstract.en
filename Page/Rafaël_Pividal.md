[3] Argument appearing on the cover: "From a porcelain doorknob found at the marché aux puces, Rafael Pividal, writer, art lover, reconstructs the path of Hector Guimard, one of the Art Nouveau masters. From mansions to subway entrances and through this exceptional building, the Castel Béranger, the film tries to approach the process from this designer and mainly his work".
