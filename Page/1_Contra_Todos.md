Synopsis

Cadu (Júlio Andrade), who is about to become a father for the second time, loses his job. His situation becomes even more complicated when, by mistake, he is unjustly condemned for the crime of drug trafficking in Taubaté, in the interior of São Paulo. Trying to survive the prison, he is forced to lie and to engage in criminal behavior. He has the help of Professor (Adélio Lima), a man who has been imprisoned for more than 25 years for trafficking and murder. Considered a counselor inside the penitentiary, he knows everything that goes on inside. Believing that Cadu is innocent, Professor becomes a father figure to him. The former lawyer also has the support of China (Thogun Teixeira) and Mom (Sílvio Guindane). The first, convicted of murder, believes in his lies, which leads him to become his friend and personal security guard, risking his own life to protect the 'Doctor of Traffic'. The second, convicted of attempted murder, follows the orders of China, chief of the cell where he is being held. On the other hand, the arrival of Cadu makes Playboy (Sacha Bali), convicted of bank robbery and gang formation, to lose his position in the chain hierarchy, which makes this ambitious young man become an enemy of Cadu. The penitentiary is under the command of the director Demosthenes (Adriano Garib), an ambitious and corrupt man who transforms the life of Cadu into a hell. Meanwhile, his wife Malu (Julia Ianina), willing to do anything to save her husband, enters the charade of Cadu's new identity and becomes the 'first lady' of drug trafficking. The case of Cadu is still investigated by Jonas (Caio Junqueira), a federal police officer who has been working for years to raise evidence against the Santa Cruz de La Sierra Cartel. Reason why you believe in the innocence of Cadu.
