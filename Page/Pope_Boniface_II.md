POPE BONIFACE II (; died 17 October 532) was the first Germanic pope. He reigned from 17 September 530 until his death in 532.[1] He was born an Ostrogoth.


Life

Boniface was chosen by his predecessor, Pope Felix IV, who had been a strong adherent of the Arian king, and was never elected. He was later elected, largely due to the influence of the Gothic king Athalaric.[2] For a time, Boniface served as pope in competition with Dioscorus, who had been elected by most of the priests of Rome. Boniface and Dioscorus were both consecrated in Rome on 22 September 530, but Dioscurus died only twenty-two days later.[3]

Boniface II's most notable act was confirming the decisions of the Council of Orange, teaching that grace is always necessary to obtain salvation.[4][5] Boniface was buried in St. Peter's on 17 October 532.[6]
