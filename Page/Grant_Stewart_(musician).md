GRANT STEWART (born June 4, 1971) is a Canadian jazz saxophonist.


Life and career

Stewart was born in Toronto, Ontario on June 4, 1971.[1] His father was a part-time jazz guitarist.[2] Aged ten, Stewart played on alto sax solos from saxophonists Charlie Parker, Coleman Hawkins, and Wardell Gray that had been transcribed by his father.[3] "By his early teens, Stewart had already found performance experience with such artists as Pat LaBarbera and Bob Mover".[4] By 18 he "was leading a quartet in Toronto, including for a regular gig at C'est What caf√© and pub"; and he moved to New York City when he was 19.[5]

In New York, Stewart first played with guitarist Peter Bernstein and saxophonist Jesse Davis.[6] He then began playing at Smalls Jazz Club from when it opened in 1993.[7]

His younger brother, Philip, has been a drummer in Stewart's bands since 2005.[8]

For his 2007 recording _Young at Heart_, Stewart chose some challenging compositions, including by Elmo Hope and Neal Hefti, as well as originals.[9] On _Around the Corner_ in 2010, Stewart also played soprano sax.[10]


Playing style

Stewart plays "steady swinging, muscular hard bop".[11] His sound is "lean and sinewy, yet flush with lyricism, humor and rhythmic possibilities, much like tenor icons Dexter Gordon and Sonny Rollins, to whom Stewart is frequently compared".[12]
