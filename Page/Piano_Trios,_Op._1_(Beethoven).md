Ludwig van Beethoven's Opus 1 is a set of three piano trios (written for piano, violin, and cello), first performed in 1795 in the house of Prince Lichnowsky, to whom they are dedicated.[1] The trios were published in 1795.

Despite the Op. 1 designation, these trios were not Beethoven's first published compositions; this distinction belongs rather to his _Dressler Variations_ for keyboard (WoO 63). Clearly he recognized these compositions as the earliest ones he had produced that were substantial enough (and marketable enough) to fill out a first major publication to introduce his style of writing to the musical public.


Op. 1 No. 1 - Piano Trio No. 1 in E-flat major

-   Allegro (E-flat major),
-   Adagio cantabile (A-flat major),
-   Scherzo. Allegro assai (E-flat major, with trio in A-flat major),
-   Finale. Presto (E-flat major),

The first movement opens with a similar figure to that of the third movement of Mozart's 20^(th) Piano Concerto.


Op. 1 No. 2 - Piano Trio No. 2 in G major

-   Adagio,  - Allegro vivace, (G major)
-   Largo con espressione (E major),
-   Scherzo. Allegro (G major, with a trio in B minor),
-   Finale. Presto (G major),


Op. 1 No. 3 - Piano Trio No. 3 in C minor

-   Allegro con brio (C minor),
-   Andante cantabile con Variazioni (E-flat major),
-   Minuetto. Quasi allegro (C minor, with a trio in C major),
-   Finale. Prestissimo (C minor, concluding in C major),

Unlike the other piano trios in this opus, the third trio does not have a scherzo as its third movement but a minuet instead.

This third piano trio was later reworked by Beethoven into the C minor string quintet, Op. 104.[2]
