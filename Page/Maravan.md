Plot

Sethupathi (Prabhu) lived in the city with his family consisting of his father Manickam (Vijayakumar), his mother Meenakshi (Sumithra) and his sister Lakshmi (Dakshayini). Manickam, Sethupathi's father, is an honest police officer and wanted his son to become a police officer like him. Sethupathi took the IPS exam and successfully passed it. Sethupathi was subsequently transferred to the remote village called Solaiyoor.

When he arrives in the village, Sethupathi is in a state of shock. The village is under the control of the village president Rajadurai (R. P. Viswam) and his son Shankarapandiyan (Napoleon), a corrupt politician. With the local rowdies, they spread terror among the villagers.

Sethupathi first changes the bad habits of the police officers (Chandrasekhar, Thyagu and Vadivelu). In the meantime, Sethupathi and the village belle Thangathai (Kushboo) fall in love with each other. One day, Sethupathi beats up and strips Rajadurai in front of villagers for cheating them, and he puts him in jail. Shankarapandi makes his father release him the next hour. The next day, Shankarapandi, Rajadurai and his henchmen take revenge by stripping the police officers and beating them. What transpires later forms the crux of the story.
