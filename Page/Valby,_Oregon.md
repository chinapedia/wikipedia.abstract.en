VALBY is an unincorporated community in Morrow County, Oregon, United States. Valby is the site of a Swedish Lutheran church, built in 1897 by settlers of Swedish descent north of Eightmile.[1] The place name _valby_ or _vallby_ is Swedish for a _community of sheepherders_.[2] Eightmile is along Oregon Route 206 between Condon and Heppner.[3]

In 1983, an article in _The Oregonian_ described the church and congregation as they were then. About 35 people, many of them descendants of the church founders, were traveling from as far away as to attend Sunday services conducted by a pastor from Heppner.[4]
