Fictional character biography

Ramonda is Queen Mother of Wakanda, mother to Shuri and step-mother to T'Challa. She is the second wife of T'Chaka.[1] Born in South Africa, she married T'Chaka after the death of his previous wife N'Yami.[2] Sometime after having Shuri, Ramonda was captured by white supremacist Anton Pretorius and suffered years of sexual abuse from him. When T'Challa found out where his mother was kept, he donned the Black Panther costume and rescued his mother. When Anton insisted that he loved her, Ramonda punched him in the face and left with her son.[3][4]

When Birnin Zana was attacked by terrorists, Ramonda was seriously injured, suffering several fractures and ending up in a coma.[5][6] She eventually came out of her coma and, despite the possibility of paralysis, managed to heal somewhat and now walks with a cane.[7][8]

Film

-   Angela Bassett portrays Ramonda in the 2018 film _Black Panther_ as T'Challa and Shuri's mother and Queen Mother of Wakanda.[10] Boseman noted that Ramonda "is one of the advisors that [T'Challa] would look to... for some of the answers of what his father might want or might do. She may not be exactly right all the time, but she definitely has insights."[11] Bassett wore a silver, waist-length wig for the role that was made from 120 pieces of hair hand-rolled into dreadlocks.[12] Corey Calliet served as Bassett's trainer, working with her before she began filming, and while she was on set, by creating high-intensity interval training circuits and helping to craft her diet.[13] This version of Ramonda is the actual birth mother of T'Challa rather than his stepmother.
-   Bassett reprises the role in the 2019 film _Avengers: Endgame_.[14]
