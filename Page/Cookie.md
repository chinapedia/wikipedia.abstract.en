A COOKIE is a baked or cooked food that is typically small, flat and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar and some type of oil or fat. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc.

In most English-speaking countries except for the United States and Canada, crisp cookies are called BISCUITS. Chewier biscuits are sometimes called _cookies_ even in the United Kingdom.[1] Some cookies may also be named by their shape, such as date squares or bars.

Cookies or biscuits may be mass-produced in factories, made in small bakeries or homemade. Biscuit or cookie variants include sandwich biscuits, such as custard creams, Jammie Dodgers, Bourbons and Oreos, with marshmallow or jam filling and sometimes dipped in chocolate or another sweet coating. Cookies are often served with beverages such as milk, coffee or tea. Factory-made cookies are sold in grocery stores, convenience stores and vending machines. Fresh-baked cookies are sold at bakeries and coffeehouses, with the latter ranging from small business-sized establishments to multinational corporations such as Starbucks.


Terminology

Holiday_Cookie_Tray.jpg In most English-speaking countries outside North America, including the United Kingdom, the most common word for a crisp cookie is BISCUIT.[2] The term COOKIE is normally used to describe chewier ones.[3] However, in many regions both terms are used.

In Scotland the term COOKIE is sometimes used to describe a plain bun.[4]

Cookies that are baked as a solid layer on a sheet pan and then cut, rather than being baked as individual pieces, are called in British English BAR COOKIES or TRAYBAKES.[5]


Etymology

Its American name derives from the Dutch word _koekje_ or more precisely its informal, dialect variant _koekie_[6] which means _little cake,_ and arrived in American English with the Dutch settlement of New Netherland, in the early 1600s.

According to the Scottish National Dictionary, its Scottish name derives from the diminutive form (+ suffix _-ie_) of the word _cook_, giving the Middle Scots _cookie_, _cooky_ or _cu(c)kie_. It also gives an alternative etymology: like the American word, from the Dutch _koekje_, the diminutive of _koek_, a cake. There was much trade and cultural contact across the North Sea between the Low Countries and Scotland during the Middle Ages, which can also be seen in the history of curling and, perhaps, golf.


Description

Různé_druhy_cukroví_(2).jpg filled with jam.]] Cookies are most commonly baked until crisp or just long enough that they remain soft, but some kinds of cookies are not baked at all. Cookies are made in a wide variety of styles, using an array of ingredients including sugars, spices, chocolate, butter, peanut butter, nuts, or dried fruits. The softness of the cookie may depend on how long it is baked.

A general theory of cookies may be formulated this way. Despite its descent from cakes and other sweetened breads, the cookie in almost all its forms has abandoned water as a medium for cohesion. Water in cakes serves to make the base (in the case of cakes called "batter"[7]) as thin as possible, which allows the bubbles – responsible for a cake's fluffiness – to better form. In the cookie, the agent of cohesion has become some form of oil. Oils, whether they be in the form of butter, vegetable oils, or lard, are much more viscous than water and evaporate freely at a much higher temperature than water. Thus a cake made with butter or eggs instead of water is far denser after removal from the oven.

Oils in baked cakes do not behave as soda tends to in the finished result. Rather than evaporating and thickening the mixture, they remain, saturating the bubbles of escaped gases from what little water there might have been in the eggs, if added, and the carbon dioxide released by heating the baking powder. This saturation produces the most texturally attractive feature of the cookie, and indeed all fried foods: crispness saturated with a moisture (namely oil) that does not sink into it.


History

Thumbprint_Cookies_(7712226646).jpg Cookie-like hard wafers have existed for as long as baking is documented, in part because they deal with travel very well, but they were usually not sweet enough to be considered cookies by modern standards.[8]

Cookies appear to have their origins in 7th century AD Persia, shortly after the use of sugar became relatively common in the region.[9] They spread to Europe through the Muslim conquest of Spain. By the 14th century, they were common in all levels of society throughout Europe, from royal cuisine to street vendors.

With global travel becoming widespread at that time, cookies made a natural travel companion, a modernized equivalent of the travel cakes used throughout history. One of the most popular early cookies, which traveled especially well and became known on every continent by similar names, was the jumble, a relatively hard cookie made largely from nuts, sweetener, and water.

Cookies came to America through the Dutch in New Amsterdam in the late 1620s. The Dutch word "koekje" was Anglicized to "cookie" or COOKY. The earliest reference to cookies in America is in 1703, when "The Dutch in New York provided...'in 1703...at a funeral 800 cookies...'"[10]

The most common modern cookie, given its style by the creaming of butter and sugar, was not common until the 18th century.[11] Bakarkhani_cookies.jpg Cookie is part of Mughlai cuisine of the Indian subcontinent]]


Classification

Cookies are broadly classified according to how they are formed, including at least these categories:

-   _Bar cookies_ consist of batter or other ingredients that are poured or pressed into a pan (sometimes in multiple layers) and cut into cookie-sized pieces after baking. In British English, bar cookies are known as "tray bakes".[12] Examples include brownies, fruit squares, and bars such as date squares.

-   _Drop cookies_ are made from a relatively soft dough that is dropped by spoonfuls onto the baking sheet. During baking, the mounds of dough spread and flatten. Chocolate chip cookies (Toll House cookies), oatmeal raisin (or other oatmeal-based) cookies, and rock cakes are popular examples of drop cookies. This may also include _thumbprint cookies_, for which a small central depression is created with a thumb or small spoon before baking to contain a filling, such as jam or a chocolate chip.[13] In the UK, the term "cookie" often refers only to this particular type of product.
-   _Filled cookies_ are made from a rolled cookie dough filled with a fruit or confectionery filling before baking. Hamantashen are a filled cookie.
-   _Molded cookies_ are also made from a stiffer dough that is molded into balls or cookie shapes by hand before baking. Snickerdoodles and peanut butter cookies are examples of molded cookies. Some cookies, such as hermits or biscotti, are molded into large flattened loaves that are later cut into smaller cookies.
-   _No-bake cookies_ are made by mixing a filler, such as cereal or nuts, into a melted confectionery binder, shaping into cookies or bars, and allowing to cool or harden. Oatmeal clusters and Rum balls are no-bake cookies.
-   _Pressed cookies_ are made from a soft dough that is extruded from a cookie press into various decorative shapes before baking. Spritzgebäck is an example of a pressed cookie.
-   _Refrigerator cookies_ (also known as _icebox cookies_) are made from a stiff dough that is refrigerated to make the raw dough even stiffer before cutting and baking. The dough is typically shaped into cylinders which are sliced into round cookies before baking. Pinwheel cookies and those made by Pillsbury are representative.
-   _Rolled cookies_ are made from a stiffer dough that is rolled out and cut into shapes with a cookie cutter. Gingerbread men are an example.
-   _Sandwich cookies_ are rolled or pressed cookies that are assembled as a sandwich with a sweet filling. Fillings include marshmallow, jam, and icing. The Oreo cookie, made of two chocolate cookies with a vanilla icing filling, is an example.
-   _Vegan cookies_ can be made with flour, sugar, nondairy milk and nondairy margarine. The icing can be made with aquafaba to decorate the cookies.

Cookies also may be decorated with icing, especially chocolate, and closely resembles a type of confectionery.
