Rev. WILLIAM HOSMER (May 27, 1810 – July 17, 1889) was an American anti-slavery author and editor, and a Methodist minister.


Biography

Hosmer was born on May 27, 1810, near the town of Brimfield, Massachusetts, to Eleazer and Clara (Needham) Hosmer.[1] He studied at the Franklin Academy in Plattsburgh, New York.[2]

In 1831 Hosmer was admitted as a probationer to the Genesee Conference of the Methodist Church, and was ordained as a minister two years later.

Between 1848 and 1856 Hosmer was the editor of the _Northern Christian Advocate_ newspaper, owned by the Methodist General Conference.[3] Hosmer was a strong believer in Wesleyan philosophy, and during his incumbency at the _Advocate_ he was a strong advocate for both antislavery and temperance issues.[4] Due to a schism within the Methodist church, his stance eventually led to his replacement as editor in June 1856 by Rev. F. G. Hibbard.[5] Following his removal from the _Northern Christian Advocate_, a new paper called _The Northern Independent_ was established and Hosmer appointed as its editor. Hosmer remained editor of _The Northern Independent_ until "stricken by paralysis ... while delivering a temperance address" in 1871.[6][7] He also wrote articles and essays for other periodicals, including the _Methodist Quarterly Review_.[8]

Hosmer was a charter trustee of the Genesee College in Lima, New York, which later became Syracuse University.[9][10]

He died in his home in Auburn, New York, on the morning of Monday, June 17, 1889.[11]
