BARBARA KÖHLER (born April 11, 1959) is a German poet and translator.

She was born in Burgstädt, East Germany, but was raised in Penig. She studied at the Johannes R. Becher Literature Institute in Leipzig in 1985. She was there for three years then later started writing for magazines. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, she was able to publish her first collection, _Deutsches Roulette_, meaning German Roulette, in 1991 with the publishing company Suhrkamp Verlag. Many more publications such as her poetry collection _Blue Box_ (1995) and _Wittgensteins Nichte_ (1999), meaning Wittgenstein’s Niece, came soon afterwards.[1]

She released _Niemands Frau_, her most well known work, in 2007. Meaning Nobody's Wife, _Niemands Frau_ tells the story of the Odyssey in the perspective of its female characters. Köhler explains in her Afterword this was done so as to not make them "there in the story as though they weren’t really there: just there for him, for the hero."[2] In 2009, Köhler won the Poetry Prize of the German Industry Culture Group, among several other awards, for _Niemands Frau_.[3]

Köhler now lives in Duisburg and has been since 1994. She has worked as an English and French translator. She has been recognized for her versions of Gertrude Stein and Samuel Beckett.[4]


Early life

Barbara Köhler was born in Burgstädt, East Germany, April 11, 1959. She grew up in Penig. After finishing the Abitur, the school system in Germany, she was a textile production worker in Plauen for a while. Before becoming a poet, she also worked in an elderly home, and was a lighting assistant for the city theater in Karl Marx Stadt, now known as Chemitz. In 1985, she studied at the Johannes R. Becher Literature Institute in Leipzig for three years, then started publishing work for magazines. Once the Berlin Wall fell, her own poetry and work began being published.[5]


Career

Barbara Köhler's career in poetry took off in 1991 with the publication of her first collection, _Deutsches Roulette_, meaning German Roulette. She published several other works succeeding _Deutsches Roulette._ In 1995, she published _Blue Box_ while working as a town writer in Rheinsberg. In 1997, she wrote as a residence writer at the University of Warwick. A year later, _Cor Responde_ was published and, a year after that, _Wittgensteins Nichte_ was as well. In the early 2000s, Barbara Köhler worked on her German translations for Stein and Beckett's writing. In 2000, _Ungarisches Wasser_, meaning Hungarian Water, also came out. In 2007, her latest work, _Niemands Frau_ and _No One's Box_was published. Currently, Barbara Köhler is a freelancer and has been since 1988. Today, she lives in Duisburg, after moving there in 1994.[6]


Writing

Use of language

Barbara Köhler's writing style is characterized by her use of language. She plays with the grammar and diction in her poetry, and demonstrates the subjectivity of language. She often has a stanza, then repeats it, except one similar sounding or spelled word from that stanza will have been changed, altering the stanza's original meaning. This is shown in work such as _Niemands Frau_, the premise of the retelling being that "er", meaning "he" in German, is changed to "sie", meaning "they" or "she" in German, switching from the single voice of Odysseus to the various female voices and showing their point of views.[7]

Influences

Barbara Köhler was heavily influenced by classic literature. This was possibly attributed to the time period she wrote in, which was known as the "classical turn" in German poetry during the mid-1990s. With East Germany's collapse in 1989 and German reunification in 1990, writers looked back on classic literature and philosophers to explain civilization and to understand the changes that were occurring around them. They used ancient works as models, looking for relationships between their present reality to ancient myths, especially through the work of Homer. Thereby potentially influencing Barbara Köhler, as _Niemands Frau_ focuses on the Odyssey. However, Barbara Köhler's interest in Homer may be accredited to her own understanding as a poet and skepticism of the classics. She criticizes classical material for its ideas and assumptions about women's passivity and how classical material has passed down these ideas into western culture. Köhler, therefore, seeks and writes about portrayals of women who are independent and free from these assumptions. Work with the classics and literary heritage was, for Köhler, done to "interrogate the grammar of patriarchal power."[8]
