The JOULE ( ;[1][2][3] symbol: J) is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units.[4] It is equal to the energy transferred to (or work done on) an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of the force's motion through a distance of one metre (1 newton metre or N⋅m). It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second. It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule (1818–1889).[5][6][7]

In terms firstly of base SI units and then in terms of other SI units, a joule is defined below, where kg is the kilogram, m is the metre, s is the second, N is the newton, Pa is the pascal, W is the watt, C is the coulomb, and V is the volt:

$$\text{J} = \frac{\text{kg}{\cdot}\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2} = \text{N}{\cdot}\text{m} = \text{Pa}{\cdot}\text{m}^3 = \text{W}{\cdot}\text{s} = \text{C}{\cdot}\text{V},$$

One joule can also be defined as the following:

-   The work required to move an electric charge of one coulomb through an electrical potential difference of one volt, or one _coulomb-volt_ (C⋅V). This relationship can be used to define the volt.
-   The work required to produce one watt of power for one second, or one _watt-second_ (W⋅s) (compare kilowatt-hour 3.6 megajoules). This relationship can be used to define the watt.


Usage


Exception of newton metre

In mechanics, the concept of force (in some direction) has a close analog in the concept of torque (about some angle):

  Linear                              Angular
  ----------------------------------- -------------------
  Force                               Torque
  Mass                                Moment of inertia
  Displacement (sometimes position)   Angle

A result of this similarity is that the SI unit for torque is the newton metre, which works out algebraically to have the same dimensions as the joule. But they are not interchangeable. The CGPM has given the unit of energy the name _joule_, but has not given the unit of torque any special name, hence it is simply the newton metre (N⋅m) – a compound name derived from its constituent parts.[8] The use of newton metres for torque and joules for energy is helpful to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications.[9]

The distinction may be seen also in the fact that energy is a scalar – the dot product of a vector force and a vector displacement. By contrast, torque is a vector – the cross product of a distance vector and a force vector. Torque and energy are related to one another by the equation

_E_ = _τ__θ_ ,

where _E_ is energy, _τ_ is (the vector magnitude of) torque, and _θ_ is the angle swept (in radians). Since radians are dimensionless, it follows that torque and energy have the same dimensions.


Practical examples

One joule in everyday life represents approximately:

-   The energy required to lift a medium-sized tomato up (assume the tomato has a mass of approximately ).
-   The energy released when that same tomato falls back down one metre.
-   The energy required to accelerate a 1 kg mass at 1 m⋅s^(−2) through a distance of 1 m.
-   The heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 0.24 °C.[10]
-   The typical energy released as heat by a person at rest every 1/60 s (approximately 17 ms).
-   The kinetic energy of a 50 kg human moving very slowly ().
-   The kinetic energy of a 56 g tennis ball moving at .[11]
-   The kinetic energy of an object with mass 1 kg moving at  ≈ 1.4 m/s.
-   The amount of electricity required to light a 1 W LED for 1 s.

Since the joule is also a watt-second and the common unit for electricity sales to homes is the kW⋅h (kilowatt-hour), a kW⋅h is thus 1000 W × 3600 s = 3.6 MJ (megajoules).

About 63 TJ of energy was released by the atomic bomb that exploded over Hiroshima.[16] The International Space Station, with a mass of approximately 450 megagrams and orbital velocity of 7.7 km/s,[17] has a kinetic energy of roughly 13 TJ. In 2017 Hurricane Irma was estimated to have a peak wind energy of 112 TJ.[18][19]

Watt second

A WATT SECOND (also WATT-SECOND, symbol W S or W·S) is a derived unit of energy equivalent to the joule.[22] The watt-second is the energy equivalent to the power of one watt sustained for one second. While the watt-second is equivalent to the joule in both units and meaning, there are some contexts in which the term "watt-second" is used instead of "joule".

Photography

In photography, the unit for flashes is the watt-second. A flash can be rated in watt-seconds (e.g. 300 W⋅s) or in joules (different names for the same thing), but historically the term "watt-second" has been used and continues to be used. An on-camera flash, using a 1000 microfarad capacitor at 300 volts, would be 45 watt-seconds. Studio flashes, using larger capacitors and higher voltages, are in the 200–2000 watt-second range.

$$\text{Energy of a flash in joules or watt-seconds} = \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot \text{capacitance of the storage capacitor in farads} \cdot \text{working voltage}^2$$

The energy rating a flash is given is not a reliable benchmark for its light output because there are numerous factors that affect the energy conversion efficiency. For example, the construction of the tube will affect the efficiency, and the use of reflectors and filters will change the usable light output towards the subject. Some companies specify their products in "true" watt-seconds, and some specify their products in "nominal" watt-seconds.[23]
