AIDUL FITRICIADA AZHARI is the current chairman of the Judicial Commission of Indonesia.[1][2] Azhari has been referred to as a dark horse due to the fact that he initially hadn't been nominated nor had he volunteered to be the Judicial Commission's chairman. Two other candidates were rejected by the People's Representative Council before his confirmation.[3]

Azhari's tenure has been strict. In the summer of 2016, the Judicial Commission offered fewer nominations for the Supreme Court of Indonesia and the corruption courts than the Supreme Court had requested; Azhari explained that of the candidates under consideration, there weren't enough who actually met the Commission's minimum criteria for the positions.[4] Azhari has also promoted the idea of studying other judicial systems such as those of Australia, Turkey and the United States to learn best practices.[5] Specifically, Azhari pointed to the purges of 6,000 judges by the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors after the 2016 Turkish coup d'Ã©tat attempt as a positive example of the exercise of external oversight of a judiciary.[6]
