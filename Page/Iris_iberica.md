_IRIS IBERICA_ is a species in the genus _Iris_, it is also in the subgenus of Iris and in the Oncocyclus section. It is a rhizomatous perennial, from the Caucasus mountains of Armenia, eastern Georgia, and western Azerbaijan. It has narrow, glaucous, gray-green and sickle shaped leaves, short stem holding a single flower in late spring. Which has a pale background (white, cream or pale blue) covered with heavy veining in pale mauve, violet, dark purple, maroon or purple-brown. It has a black or dark purple signal patch and a brown or purple-brown beard. Although, it has many hybrid forms dues to its variability and has 2 known subspecies of _Iris iberica_ subsp. _elegantissima_ and _Iris iberica_ subsp. _lycotis_. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, as it is more hardier than other Oncocyclus species.


Description

It is similar to _Iris susiana_, apart from its leaf and flower form.[1] It is classed as an Mezo-xerophyte,[2] (meaning they like intermediate dry conditions.[3]) or xeric species (similar to _Seseli grandivittatum_, _Thymus tiflisiensis_, _Scorzonera eriosperma_ and _Tulipa eichleri_).[4]

It has a slender,[5] and compact rhizome,[6][7] that is not stoloniferous,[8] but up to 1.5 cm in diameter.[9]

They have 4–6 leaves,[10] that are glaucous,[11][12] grey-green,[13][14][15] and falcate,[16][17][18] (sickle shaped) or curved.[19][20][21] They can grow up to between long,[22] and are narrow,[23][24] being between 0.2 and 0.6 cm wide.[25][26][27] The leaves start to grow in Autumn (near to September), after a summer rest period after flowering.[28]

It has a short,[29] slender stem or peduncle,[30][31] that can grow up to between tall.[32][33][34]

The stem has a green, lanceolate, membranous,[35] spathes (leaves of the flower bud), which are variable is size, between 3mm,[36] to 5 cm long.[37] The stems hold a solitary,[38][39][40] terminal (top of stem) flower, blooming in late spring,[41][42][43] between March and May.[44][45] In the UK, it blooms later between May and June.[46][47] The flowers can last between 120–145 days before fading.[48]

The flowers are in diameter,[49][50][51] they are described as big and flouncy.[52]

The very variable,[53][54][55] bi-coloured flowers,[56] have a white,[57][58][59] silvery white,[60] cream,[61][62] or pale bluish background,[63][64][65] with heavily stippled,[66] spotted or veined in pale mauve,[67] violet,[68] dark purple, maroon,[69][70][71] or purple-brown.[72][73][74] Some forms can have a lilac background.[75]

Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'.[76] The falls are spoon-shaped,[77][78][79] or obovate (rounded),[80][81][82] and reflexed,[83] or concave.[84] They are long,[85][86][87] and 2.7–6.5 cm wide.[88][89] In the center of the falls, is a velvet-like,[90][91] dark,[92] deep rich purple,[93] black-purple,[94] brown,[95] or blackish blotch or signal patch.[96][97] Also, in the middle of the falls, is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which are brown,[98] or purplish brown.[99][100][101] The pale standards,[102] are round,[103][104] or orbicular,[105] and long.[106][107] They are normally less veined than the falls,[108][109] or have paler veining.[110][111][112]

It has style branches that are as long as the falls,[113][114] brown and long,[115] with scalloped lobes.[116] The perianth tube is 2–3.5 cm long/[117][118]

After the iris has flowered, in June,[119][120] it produces a seed capsule,[121] which is long, and 2–2.5 cm wide.[122] The capsule holds 56–60 wrinkled seeds,[123] which are about 0.5 cm in diameter.[124] Only between 10–30 % of the seeds are fertile.[125]

Biochemistry

As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings.[126] It has a chromosome count: 2n=20,[127] counted by Delauney in 1928. Then by Marc Simonet in 1932 and then by Avishai & Zohary in 1977.[128][129] It has an unnamed alkaloid (as of 1961), contained within its rhizome.[130]


Taxonomy

ArmenianStamps-127-128.jpg _Iris iberica_ is pronounced as _EYE-ris eye-BEER-ee-kuh_,[131] and is commonly known as _Iberian Iris_,[132][133][134] or _Georgian Iris_.[135][136][137]

One reference mistakenly lists its common name as 'Chalcedonian iris',[138] but this is normally used for _Iris susiana_.[139]

The Latin specific epithet _iberica_ refers to _ibericus_ -a -um, coming from the Georgian Caucasus,[140] or eastern Turkey.[141]

It was originally found in Transcaucasus,[142][143] and it was first published and described by Georg Franz Hoffmann in Vol.1 page 41 of _Commentationes Societatis Physico-Medicae apud Universitatem Litteratum Caesaream Mosquensem Institutae_ (Commentat. Soc. Phys.-Med. Univ. Litt. Caes. Mosq.), published in Moscow in 1808.[144][145][146]

Although a few references state it was published by Steven in Fl. Taur.-Caucas. Vol.1 on page 30 in 1808,[147][148] as _Iris iberica_ Steven.[149]

It was also published as _Iris iberica_ in Gartenflora page3 in 1863, then in Curtis's Botanical Magazine Table 5847 in 1870 and Revue Horticole Vol.45 page 370 on 1 October 1873.[150][151]

Due to its variability of form, it has two known subspecies, _Iris iberica_ ssp. _elegantissima_,[152][153][154] (grows 20–30 cm in height with flowers 10 cm in diameter having a cream or pale yellow ground colour),[155] and _Iris iberica_ ssp. _lycotis_.[156][157][158][159] Another known subspecies is _Iris iberica_ subsp. _iberica_,[160] but this name is also used for the standard form of the iris as well.[161] In between _I. iberica_ and _I. iberica_ ssp. _lycotis_ are a large range of forms.[162][163]

It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then changed on 1 December 2004.[164]

It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life,[165] and in the Catalogue of Life as _Iris iberica_ Steven.[166]

_Iris iberica_ is an accepted name by the RHS.[167]


Distribution and habitat

It is native to temperate Asia.[168][169]

Range

_I. iberica_ and its subspecies comes from a wide range across the Caucasus mountains,[170][171][172] although _I. iberica_ subsp. _elegantissima_ is found in eastern Turkey from near the Armenian border to Lake Van. _I. iberica_ subsp. _lycotis_ is found in north western Iran near Hakkari, Turkey on the Iranian border and southern Armenia on the Iranian border.[173][174][175] _I. iberica_ itself is found only in eastern Georgia,[176][177][178] (near Tbilisi,[179][180][181]) Armenia,[182] and western Azerbaijan.[183][184]

Habitat

It grows on the dry grasslands of the steppes,[185][186][187] or on the dry stony slopes of the lower mountain belt.[188][189] It grows on steppes of Georgia with various stipa grass communities (including _stipe pulcherrima_, _stipa lessingiana_, _stipa pontica_ and _stipa capillata_),[190] with scattered shrubs of red juniper and berberis.[191] They can be found at an altitude of ,[192][193] or above sea level.[194]


Conservation

The iris is rare and endangered species, and was listed in the Red Book of the USSR,[195] (in ) and on the Red List of Georgia.[196][197] Although, it was not included in the first edition of the Red Data Book of Armenia, (published in 1988,[198]) or also not included in the Annexes of CITES and that of the Bern Convention.[199] It is thought to be close to being extinct in Armenia, due to the effects of land development,[200] in Georgia it was fairly common in selected sites, but has been picked and sold in markets, which has affected the iris populations.[201] It is also affected by loss of habitat due to human activity.[202]


Cultivation

'Oncocyclus Section' Irises are easier to grow than 'Regelia Section' irises.[203] _I. iberica_ is hardy to European Zone 4,[204] (meaning hardy to −5 to −10 °C (23 to 14 °F).[205] This includes parts of Europe, where it can be planted in a sunny,[206] rock garden position, in sandy soil.[207] Although it grows best within a cold frame or alpine house.[208] In order to protect the iris from excess moisture (especially during winter times) and also to ensure the (shallow planted) rhizomes get the best temperatures during the growing season.[209] They can be grown in pots (especially in deep ones known as 'long toms'), but they need re-potting, every 2 years and extra feeding. Watering is one of the most critical aspects of iris cultivation.[210] It can suffer from aphids, viruses and rots.[211] _I. iberica_ is affected by fungal _Puccinia iridis_.[212] It is also the host plant of _Mononychus schoenherrii_ Kolenati (a weevil that feeds on the seeds of the iris). The weevil lays its eggs within seed capsule of the iris, later the larvae feeds on the seed and then pupates. Adult weevils emerge from the seed capsules, fly off for aestivation (summer dormancy) and hibernation.[213] A specimen of the iris can be found in the Herbarium Hookerianum within the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.[214]

Propagation

Irises can generally be propagated by division,[215] or by seed growing. Irises generally require a period of cold, then a period of warmth and heat, also they need some moisture. Some seeds need stratification, (the cold treatment), which can be carried out indoors or outdoors. Seedlings are generally potted on (or transplanted) when they have 3 leaves.[216] Oncoyclus irises dislike division, but it should only be carried out when the plant is overcrowded.[217] Although hand pollination and germinating seedlings gives better results.[218]

Hybrids and cultivars

_I. iberica_ has been used to make many various hybrids and cultivars. Most hybrids are sterile, only one hybrid produced a second generation seedling, that was from _I. iberica_ x _Iris pallida_, produced by Professor M. Foster.[219] Mr Foster was one of the first to breed several hybrids, including _Iris parabid_ is a hybrid between _I. Iberica_ and _Iris paradoxa_,[220][221] _I. ibpall_ (_I. iberica_ x _Iris pallida_), _I. ibvar_ (_I. iberica_ x _Iris variegata_),[222] and _I. iberica_ x _Iris susiana_ and _I. susiana_ x _I. iberica_.[223] The hybrids are very free flowering similar to _Iris germanica_.[224] Cornelius Gerrit Van Tubergen jr of Haarlem in Holland was another major breeder of irises, including _I. iberica_ x _Iris germanica_ macrantha which produced a large (6 in) blue flower with a black blue signal spot, but he found the irises need the dry baking heat in summer, so they do not freely produce flowers in Europe.[225]

Other _I. iberica_ crosses include; _Iris susiana_ X _I. iberica_: 'Charcoal Grey',[226] and 'Van Houteii'.[227] _Iris lortetii_ X _I.

Toxicity

Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also, handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.[288]
