Trim levels

United Kingdom

Interior

The Arteon will be equipped with a new digital cockpit, which replaces the main instrument panel with a configurable display, on SEL and Executive trims.[16]


Safety

The system is called Emergency Assist 2.0, and it takes advantage of four existing Volkswagen safety programs: Adaptive Cruise Control, Side Assist, Lane Assist and Park Assist. The Arteon will notice if a driver has not touched the accelerator, brakes or steering wheel for a certain length of time, and it will attempt to alert the person with sounds, visual cues and even a physical brake tap.

If that does not work, Emergency Assist 2.0 takes over: the car's hazard lights switch on and it steers itself to a safe nearside lane. The system uses Lane Assist to recognize lines on the road and Park Assist to actually steer the car. Radar detection via Adaptive Cruise Control and Side Assist helps ensure the Arteon will not hit any other vehicles.[17]

China commenced production on the Arteon under the CC name starting in August 2018 for the 2019 model year.
