YENISEY RAILWAY STATION (Russian: ) is a railway station on the Krasnoyarsk Railway in Krasnoyarsk. It is located on the Trans-Siberian Railway, east of Moscow and east of Krasnoyarsk Railway station.


Description

The station has three platforms. There is an island platform between the main railway lines (number 7 and 8), which is used for eastbound electric multiple unit commuter trains from Krasnoyarsk, as well as local passenger trains and trains traveling to Divnogorsk. The other two platforms â€“ an island platform located between railway lines number 1 and 2, and a side platform number 1 (situated next to railway line number 1) receive electric multiple unit trains traveling exclusively to Divnogorsk. A pedestrian bridge stretches across the railways. The station building is on the south side of the tracks. The station receives all of the commuter trains, including express trains from Krasnoyarsk to Ilansky, and Reshoty. Long distance trains do not stop at the station, except for trains from Krasnoyarsk to Karabula and Abakan.

The south side of the railyard has an additional park which is mainly used to store goods wagons.
