The FIELD ELM cultivar _ULMUS MINOR_ {{'}}VIMINALIS PENDULA{{'}}, a weeping form of _U. minor_ 'Viminalis', was first listed c.1890 as _Ulmus antarctica pendula_ Hort., and briefly described, by the Späth nursery of Berlin, which distributed it from the late 19th century.[1] On the continent it was also known as _U. campestris antarctica pendula_.[2] Maxwell T. Masters in the _Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society_ (1891) listed it as _U. viminalis pendula_.[3]


Description

'Pendula' was said to be a dainty form of _Ulmus antarctica_ [: 'Viminalis'] with hanging branches.[4][5]


Pests and diseases

Trees of the _U. minor_ 'Viminalis' group are very susceptible to Dutch elm disease.


Cultivation

No specimens are known to survive. One tree supplied by the Späth nursery of Berlin was planted in 1896 at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, Canada, as _U. campestris antarctica pendula_.[6] Three specimens were supplied by Späth to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902 as _U. antarctica pendula_, and may survive in Edinburgh as it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city (viz. the Wentworth Elm).[7] A specimen of _U. antarctica pendula_, planted in 1914, stood in the Ryston Hall arboretum, Norfolk,[8] in the early 20th century.[9]
