CRANE CREEK is a stream in Hickory County in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1] It is a tributary of the Pomme de Terre River.

Crane Creek enters the Pomme de Terre just south of Hermitage.[2]

Some say the name is derived from one Taylor Crane, an early settler, while others believe cranes in the area account for the name.[3]
