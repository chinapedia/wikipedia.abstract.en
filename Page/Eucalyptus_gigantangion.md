_EUCALYPTUS GIGANTANGION_, commonly known as KAKADU WOOLLYBUTT,[1] is a species of tree that is endemic in the Northern Territory. It has soft, fibrous bark most of the trunk, smooth white bark above, narrow lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, orange-coloured flowers and ribbed, urn-shaped fruit.


Description

_Eucalyptus gigantangion_ is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough but soft, fibrous, orange-brown to red-brown, dark grey or black bark over most of the trunk with the upper trunk and branches covered with smooth white bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, dull green to blue-green but lighter on one side, narrow lance-shaped, long and wide, the base tapering to a petiole long.[2][3][4]

The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on a peduncle long, the individual buds more or less sessile. Mature buds are spindle-shaped, long and wide with ribs on the sides, four small teeth at the tip, and a conical operculum. Flowering occurs from July to August and the flowers are orange. The fruit is a woody urn-shaped capsule long and wide with ribs on the sides and the valve enclosed below rim level.[5][6][7]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus gigantangion_ was first formally described in 1991 by the botanists Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill in the journal _Telopea_.[8] The specific epithet (_gigantangion_) "is derived from the Ancient Greek words _gigas_, _gigantos_, a giant and _aggeion_ (usually transliterated as _angion_), a vessel or receptacle, from the extremely large fruits".[9]


Distribution and habitat

Kakadu woollybutt grows in savanna forests with _Triodia_ and shrubs in the understorey. It is found near the upper edge of sandstone cliffs on the Arnhem Land escarpment, mostly only in Kakadu National Park.[10][11]
