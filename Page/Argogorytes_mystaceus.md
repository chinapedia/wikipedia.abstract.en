_ARGOGORYTES MYSTACEUS_ is a species of solitary wasp in the family Crabronidae.[1]


Distribution

This species has a Palearctic distribution occurring in most European countries from Ireland in the west[2] and east to Siberia, Japan, Korea, China; south to Turkey.[3]


Habitat

These wasps prefer deciduous woodland and hedge rows with sandy soil in sunny mountain areas with abundant flowering plants, at an elevation of over above sea level.[4][5]


Description

_Argogorytes mystaceus_ can reach a length of in females, of in males. These medium-sized wasps have a black abdomen with a few yellow stripes and no petiole. In males antennae are very long. Mesothorax and scutellum are black. Legs are pale yellowish brown, with a black base.[6][7]


Biology

Females of _Argogorytes mystaceus_ usually visit Apiaceae flowers,[8] wood spurge and honeydew on sweet chestnut leaves. Males are known to be pollinator of the flowers of fly orchids (mainly _Ophrys insectifera_).[9][10] The males of this species try to copulate (pseudocopulation) with these specialized flowers, that mimic (pouyannian mimicry) the shape and the scent of the females, with the purpose of deceiving them and thereby pollinate the flowers.[11][12][13]

These solitary wasps nest in soil in dry banks. Larvae feed on larvae of small leafhoppers and spittlebugs (mainly _Philaenus_ and _Aphrophora_ species). They fly in one generation from mid-May to mid-August. Among their natural enemies there are parasitoid wasps (especially Ichneumonidae larvae) and nest parasites (_Nysson spinosus_).[14][15]
