PROSPERO ALPINI (also known as PROSPER ALPINUS, PROSPERO ALPINIO and Latinized as PROSPERUS ALPINUS) (23 November 15536 February 1617), was an Italian physician and botanist from the Republic of Venice. He travelled around Egypt and served as the fourth prefect in charge of the botanical garden of Padua. He wrote several botanical treatises which covered exotic plants of economic and medicinal value. His description of coffee and banana plants are considered the oldest in European literature. The ginger-family genus _Alpinia_ was named in his honour by Carolus Linnaeus.


Biography

Born at Marostica, a town near Vicenza, the son of Francesco, a physician, Alpini served in his youth for a time in the Milanese army, but in 1574 he went to study medicine at Padua. After taking his doctor's degree in 1578, he settled as a physician in Campo San Pietro, a small town in the Paduan territory. But his tastes were botanical and influenced by Melchiorre Guilandino, and to extend his knowledge of exotic plants he travelled to Egypt in 1580 as physician to George Emo or Hemi, the Venetian consul in Cairo. The position was obtained with help from Antonio Morosini. From 1587 to 1590 he worked in Venice, Bassano and then at Genoa as physician to Giovanni Andrea Doria.[1] In Egypt he spent three years, and from a practice in the management of datepalms, which he observed in that country, he learned of sexual difference in plants, which was later to become important in the foundation of the Linnaean taxonomy system. He says that "the female date-trees or palms do not bear fruit unless the branches of the male and female plants are mixed together; or, as is generally done, unless the dust found in the male sheath or male flowers is sprinkled over the female flowers".[2]

On his return, he resided for some time at Genoa as physician to Andrea Doria, and in 1593 he was appointed professor of botany at Padua. In 1603, following the death of Giacomo Antonio Cortuso (1513-1603), he was appointed prefect for the botanical garden at Padua. His knowledge of medicinal plants made him a much sought after physician consulted by others such as Fabrici of Acquapendente and Alessandro Massaria. Towards the end of his life he suffered from arthritis, skin inflammation and receptive aphasia. He died on 6 February 1617 and is buried in the Basilica of Saint Antonio. He was succeeded in the botanical chair by his son Alpino Alpini (died 1637).[3][4]


Books

at the Staatsgallerie, Stuttgart]] Alpini's best-known botanical work is _De Plantis Aegypti liber_ (Venice, 1592).[5] This work introduced a number of plant species previously unknown to European botanists including[6] _Abrus, Abelmoschus, Lablab,_ and _Melochia,_ each of which are native to tropical areas and were cultivated with artificial irrigation in Egypt at the time. Other species included _Sesban_ _Sesbania sesban_ and the baobab tree (which he spelled _bahobab_). Early adopters of Alpini's new botanical names included the botanists Carolus Clusius (died 1609), Johann Bauhin (died 1613), Caspar Bauhin (died 1624) and Johann Veslingius (visited Egypt in the 1620s; died 1649).[7]

Prospero Alpini's __ was published in 1629 after his death. It has an expansion of the material in __ plus some other material. His _De Plantis Aegypti liber_ (Venice, 1593) is said to contain the first account of the coffee plant published in Europe although the German traveller Leonhard Rauwolf tasted coffee at Aleppo in 1573 and described its effects in 1582.[8][9] His book _De balsamo dialogus_ (1581, 1592) was among the first books to specialize on a single group of plants. He wrote on the prognosis of diseases in his _De praesagienda vita et morti aegrotanti_ (1601) which led Kurt Sprengel to consider him as a modern father of diagnostic science.[10] Another work that took nearly a decade was the _De medicina methodica libri tredecim_ (1611) which sought a revival of the Methodic school of medicine.[11] His works _De plantis exoticis_ and the _Rerum Aegyptiarum libri IV_ were published posthumously.

The genus _Alpinia_, belonging to the order Zingiberaceae (ginger family), was named after him by Linnaeus.[12]
