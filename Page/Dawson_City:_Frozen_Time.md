_DAWSON CITY: FROZEN TIME_ is a 2016 American documentary film written, edited and directed by Bill Morrison[1] and produced by Morrison and Madeleine Molyneaux. [2] It was screened in the Orizzonti Competition section at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival.[3] It concerns the history of Dawson City, Canada, deep in the Yukon, from its creation during the Klondike Gold Rush culminating in the 1978 discovery of 533 silent film reels, thought to be lost, that had been buried in 1929 in a former swimming pool or hockey rink.[4][5] Along with the lost films, there was also rare footage of other historic events, including the 1919 World Series.[6]


Synopsis

The film centers around the 1978 discovery of 533 reels of film in Dawson City. Known as the Dawson City Film Find, these works had been sealed within a decommissioned swimming pool. The content of the unearthed reels is used to tell the story of Dawson City, the dawn of 20th century America, and Hollywood in the silent era. The film depicts how what was once native land becomes a frontier, a boomtown, and an entertainment hub, before industrial monopolies and poverty of resources eventually return Dawson City to a modest encampment.

The film utilizes a number of silent film techniques, consistent with the subject matter. The film uses intertitles in place of voice-over narration and makes use of archival sound and a prominent musical score. That said, some portions, such as the interviews with those involved in the unearthing of the reels, have a more contemporary style.


Themes

The film begins with a description of the dangers of flammable [nitrate film]. This offers some insight into the fragility of the cinematic medium, the archive, and perhaps history itself. The story of Dawson City is repeatedly framed in terms of loss, with decay foregrounded by the introduction, the brooding score, and the story itself. The film also focuses on the history of exploitation in Dawson City, implying a parallel between the economic apparatus of the Klondike Gold Rush and that of the motion picture industry. [7]


Production

Bill Morrison had initially envisioned the project to be similar to his 12-minute film _The Film of Her_ (1996), but came to envision a broader scope as time went on. Kathy Jones and Michael Gates, employees of the Dawson Museum and Parks Canada respectively, were two of the early authorities on the Dawson City Film Find. Morrison interviewed both in 2014. Originally he did not intend to include the interview in the final film.[8] Morrison was able to recruit Alex Somers as composer after learning that the band Sigur Ros were fans of his previous film _Decasia_.[9]


Critical response

_Dawson City: Frozen Time_ has received positive reviews from critics. Kenneth Turan of the _Los Angeles Times_ wrote, "If you love film, if you’re intoxicated by the way movies combine image and emotion, be prepared to swoon."[10] Glenn Kenny of _The New York Times_ praised the film "as an instantaneously recognizable masterpiece."[11] Rotten Tomatoes reports a 100% approval rating based on 54 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.08/10. The site's consensus reads: "_Dawson City: Frozen Time_ takes a patient look at the past through long-lost film footage that reveals much more than glimpses at life through the camera's lens".[12]
