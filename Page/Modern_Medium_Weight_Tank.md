The MODERN MEDIUM WEIGHT TANK, also known as the MMWT, is a collaborative tank program between Turkish manufacturer FNSS and Indonesian manufacturer PT Pindad. Names for this tank includes Kaplan MT (Turkey), Harimau / Tiger (Indonesia).


History

The governments of Indonesia and Turkey first agreed in May 2015 to jointly develop the MMWT for the Indonesian Army at a reported cost of 30 million US dollars.[1] The development phase of the program was expected to take up to 37 months, with the first prototype being built in Turkey, and the second in Indonesia.[2] The intellectual property of the design was agreed upon to be shared between the two governments.

On 1 November 2016, during the 2016 Indo Defence expo, the first model of the tank was unveiled, along with some technical specifications.[3] Most notably, the vehicles overall weight was reported to be around 35 tonnes, and the main armament would be provided by a Belgian-made turret developed by CMI Defence featuring a 105mm rifled barrel, capable of firing a wide range of projectiles.

On 9 May 2017 at the IDEF 2017 expo, the first prototype of the tank was revealed. The tank can be fitted with either a Cockerill XC-8 105mm concept turret or Cockerill 3105 modular turret. Additionally, the tank utilizes modular armor, allowing for quick replacement upon damage.[4]

On 5 September 2018, the general manager of FNSS told Turkey's Anadolu Agency that the tank had passed months of required qualification tests for the Indonesian Army, and was ready for mass production. He stated that the first batch of 20 to 25 tanks could be ordered as early as late 2018, and that the full number of tanks to be produced would likely fall between 200 and 400.[5]


Design

Armament

The MMWT is equipped with a Cockerill CT-CV 105HP (High Pressure) 105mm Smoothbore gun manufactured by CMI (Cockerill Maintenance & Ingenierie SA Defense), with the barrel mounting a bore evacuator and thermal jacket. The turret is equipped with an autoloader and can be rotated 360 degrees both electronically and mechanically, with a maximum elevation/depression of 42 up to -6 degrees, and it's equipped with Gyro Stabilizer and Firing Control System. It's also equipped with an IFF system, Hunter Killer System for target selection, and Auto Target Locking System to assist the Gunner.

The Gun has been test fired with TPCSDS-T, HEP-T, HE4 TP2 shells, and can also fire NATO standard 105mm Shells such as:

- M1060CV | Velocity 1620m/s with RHA Penetration 560mm from 2000m at 60 degrees

- M1061 HEAT (High Explosive Anti Tank) | Velocity 1173m/s RHA Penetration >400mm from 1500m at 60 degrees

- M393 A3 HESH (High Explosive Squash Head) | Velocity 732m/s

- M416 Smoke | Velocity 731m/s

- M1204 Canister | Velocity 1173m/s

Armour

The hull armour of MMWT is using modular armour. It is categorized as STANAG 4569 level 4 protection, which means the tank can withstand 14.5×114mm AP rounds at 200 meters with 911 m/s velocity. The underbelly of the tank uses V-hull, able to withstand 10 kg AT mine under the tracks and under the center. Due to modularity, the armour can be augmented to level 5 protection (withstand 25 mm APDS-T at 500 m with 1258 m/s velocity) without increasing the volume of the tank, with the frontal arc able to withstand 30 mm rounds.

Mobility

Dynamic and mobility test taken in 7-16 August 2018 to prove the specification design. The tank uses a Caterpillar C13 diesel engine generating 711 HP, coupled with Allison/Caterpillar X300 transmission. During the test the tank is able to reach 78 km/h in road speed. The prototype is able to cross 2 m trench and 0.9 m vertical obstacle.

Weapon Systems

The MMWT's survivability has been furthered strengthened. A modular PULAT Active Protection System joint-developed by ASELSAN and TÜBİTAK SAGE which can be integrated. This ensures the tank's defensive capabilities against projectiles at all-angles.[6]
