Career

Mabel Brownell made her debut in 1903,[5] when she also made her first visit to the American West, in _Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush_ by Ian Maclaren.[6] Brownell appeared in a lead role in a revival of _Ben-Hur_ on Broadway in 1907.[7] She was also lead actress of the Mabel Brownell-Clifford Stork Company, a theatre company based in Newark, New Jersey.[8] In 1909 she starred in William Vaughn Moody's _The Great Divide_ in London.[9] She acted into the 1920s, often outside of New York City.[10][11][12]

She was known to do extensive research into her roles. In 1917 she spent six weeks living in a boarding house in McKeesport, Pennsylvania to play a laborer's wife in a steel town in Eugene Walter's _Just a Woman_.[13]

In 1927, she directed _Immoral Isabella_; the following year, she directed two plays on Broadway: _Mrs. Dane's Defense_ and _Within the Law_, both featuring a similar cast, with Violet Heming, Stanley Logan, Robert Warwick, and Julia Hoyt among the actors appearing in both. As a star of the stage version of _Ben-Hur_ in 1907, she was invited to the premiere of the film version in 1959.[14]
