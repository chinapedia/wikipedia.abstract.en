The CROWN TRUST COMPANY was an Ontario-based firm that operated in most of Canada[1][2] prior to its bankruptcy (along with several other trusts in 1983), due to the inflation of the currency.


History

In January 1946, Crown Trust merged with Guarantee Trust of Montreal.[3]

It eventually came to be controlled by Argus Corporation.
