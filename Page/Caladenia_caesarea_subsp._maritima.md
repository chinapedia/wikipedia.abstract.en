It has a single spreading, hairy leaf and up to three small mustard-coloured flowers with red stripes. It is only known from a small coastal area near Cape Leeuwin where it grows in clumps of ten or more.Caladenia_caesarea_maritima_02.jpg detail]]


Description

_Caladenia caesarea_ subsp. _maritima_ is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb which often occurs in clumps of ten or more. It has an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and wide. There are up to three flowers borne on a stem high and each flower is long and wide. The lateral sepals and petals are spread widely. The labellum is mustard-yellow with brownish-red stripes, projects prominently, has an irregularly serrated edge and two rows of shiny yellow calli along its centre. Flowering occurs from August to mid-September and is followed by a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing a large number of seeds.[1][2][3]


Taxonomy and naming

_Caladenia caesarea_ was first formally described by Karel Domin in 1912 and given the name _Caladenia filamentosa_ subsp. _caesarea_. Domin's description was published in _Journal of the Linnean Society, Botany_[4][5] but in 1989 Mark Clements and Stephen Hopper raised it to species status.[6][7] In 2001 Hopper and Andrew Brown described three subspecies, including subspecies _maritima_ and the descriptions were published in _Nuytsia_.[8] The epithet (_maritima_) is a Latin word meaning "of the sea",[9] referring to the "coastal habitat of this species".[10]


Distribution and habitat

Cape spider orchid occurs in the south-west corner of Western Australia between Dunsborough and Cape Leeuwin in the Jarrah Forest biogeographic region where it grows in shallow soil on granite outcrops.[11][12][13][14]


Conservation

_Caladenia caesarea_ subsp. _maritima_ is classified as "endangered" under the _Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999_ and as "rare flora" under the Western Australian _Wildlife Conservation Act 1950_. An interim recovery plan has been prepared for this subspecies.[15][16]
