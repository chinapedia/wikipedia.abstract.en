Description

"Liverpool in the 1980s. With prospects for the city’s youth bleak, a scheme for unemployed musicians commenced, inadvertently shaping the future for members of Cast, Space, the Lightning Seeds and giving fresh impetus to the idea of song as a saviour for the city.[3] Foremost of the bands to emerge from this ill-fated scheme was The La’s. Inspired by a chance meeting with Captain Beefheart, Mike Badger formed the band with the enigmatic Lee Mavers. First they conquered the city, and then on the brink of hitting the big time, and eventually inspiring what would become Britpop.[4] Badger quit to form Americana pioneers The Onset, find international recognition as a sculptor, produce album art and videos for some of the country’s biggest bands, before finally co-founding Liverpool’s Viper record label (which has recently released its 100th album). Featuring everyone from Arthur Lee to Frank Sidebottom, Jonathan Richman to Half Man Half Biscuit, and above all with new insights into the early years of the great lost Liverpool band The La's, The Rhythm and the Tide is both the personal story of a restlessly creative individual, and a reflection on the ebb and flow of the music scene in the city that he loves." [5] The book is said to be a respected and fair representation of a somewhat undocumented musical period with _Louder Than War_ calling it "the last great untold story in that glorious musical lineage".[6] and _Record Collector_ referring to it as "The hitherto untold story of the founder of The La’s".[7]
