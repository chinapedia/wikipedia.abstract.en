The IMMACULATE CONCEPTION CATHEDRAL[1] () Also CELAYA CATHEDRAL It is the main Catholic building in the city of Celaya[2] in Mexico,[3] occupying at present what was the space of a chapel annexed to the Temple of St. Francis (_Templo de San Francisco_). Because of the size of this last temple, it has come to confuse the Temple of St. Francis with the Cathedral, a common mistake.

The San Francisco Temple was erected by the Franciscan Order, who evangelized in the place, having originally built a small chapel of smaller proportions, as well as the convent attached. The first stone of this temple was erected on February 2 of the year 1683. The Cathedral of Celaya is not the Temple of San Francisco. The Cathedral is located to the side of the aforementioned Franciscan temple and has been administered for many years by the diocesan clergy.

The advances in the work were slow; By 1715 the vaults had been closed, and by the year 1725 the tower was completed.

Remodeled at the beginning of the 19th century, and at the beginning of the 20th century. It also suffered a fire, by which the last remodeling was carried out, in which was added a German organ of good bill, placed in the part of the choir.
