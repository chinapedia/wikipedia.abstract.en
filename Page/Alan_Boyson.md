When his mural _The Tree of Knowledge_, at the former Cromwell Secondary School in Salford, was given statutory protection by English Heritage, they said:[11]

Alan Boyson's Hull murals are now the subject of an arts and film project[12] titled SHIPS in the SKY[13] by Hull filmmaker Esther Johnson[14], working with Untold Hull[15] at Hull Central Libraries. The project invites the public to contribute memories and memorabilia related to the Hull Coop building and Boyson's murals. The project has been written about by House of Mirelle[16] and in Tribune Magazine.[17]
