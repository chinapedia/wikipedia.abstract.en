EARTH is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.[13][14][15] Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.[16]

Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth.[17] The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis and gradually slows its rotation.[18] Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four terrestrial planets.[19]

Earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans.[20] The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together contain many lakes, rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.

Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive.[21][22] In the history of life on Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events. Over 99% of all species[23] that ever lived on Earth are extinct.[24][25] Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely;[26][27][28] most species have not been described.[29] Over 7.6 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival.[30] Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures; politically, the world has around 200 sovereign states.


Name and etymology

'']] The modern English word _Earth_ developed from a wide variety of Middle English forms, which derived from an Old English noun most often spelled __.[31] It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their proto-Germanic root has been reconstructed as *_erþō_. In its earliest appearances, _eorðe_ was already being used to translate the many senses of Latin __ and Greek (_gē_): the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world (including the sea), and the globe itself. As with Terra and Gaia, Earth was a personified goddess in Germanic paganism: the Angles were listed by Tacitus as among the devotees of Nerthus,[32] and later Norse mythology included Jörð, a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.[33]

Originally, _earth_ was written in lowercase, and from early Middle English, its definite sense as "the globe" was expressed as _the earth_. By Early Modern English, many nouns were capitalized, and _the earth_ became (and often remained) _the Earth_, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as _Earth_, by analogy with the names of the other planets.[34] House styles now vary: Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes "Earth" when appearing as a name (e.g. "Earth's atmosphere") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by _the_ (e.g. "the atmosphere of the earth"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as "what on earth are you doing?"[35]


Chronology

Formation

The oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to (Bya).[36] By [37] the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides). According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth taking 10– (Mys) to form.[38]

A subject of research is the formation of the Moon, some 4.53 Bya.[39] A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object, named Theia, hit Earth.[40] In this view, the mass of Theia was approximately 10 percent of Earth,[41] it hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth.[42] Between approximately 4.1 and , numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.

Geological history

Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing.[43] Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets.[44] In this model, atmospheric "greenhouse gases" kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity.[45] By , Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.[46]

A crust formed when the molten outer layer of Earth cooled to form a solid. The two models[47] that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present-day forms[48] or, more likely, a rapid growth[49] early in Earth history[50] followed by a long-term steady continental area.[51][52][53] Continents formed by plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over the period of hundreds of millions of years, the supercontinents have assembled and broken apart. Roughly (Mya), one of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia , then finally Pangaea, which also broke apart .[54]

The present pattern of ice ages began about ,[55] and then intensified during the Pleistocene about .[56] High-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every . The last continental glaciation ended ago.[57]

Origin of life and evolution

of life on Earth based on rRNA analysis]] Chemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose.[58] The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen () accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer () in the upper atmosphere.[59] The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes.[60] True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface.[61] Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia,[62] biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland,[63] and remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.[64][65] The earliest direct evidence of life on Earth is contained in 3.45 billion-year-old Australian rocks showing fossils of microorganisms.[66][67]

During the Neoproterozoic, , much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed "Snowball Earth", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.[68] Following the Cambrian explosion, , there have been five mass extinctions.[69] The most recent such event was , when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared some small animals such as mammals, which at the time resembled shrews. Mammalian life has diversified over the past , and several million years ago an African ape-like animal such as _Orrorin tugenensis_ gained the ability to stand upright.[70] This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the evolution of humans. The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to this day.[71]

Future

Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next , solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next by 40%.[72] The Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, reducing [[Carbon_dioxide|
