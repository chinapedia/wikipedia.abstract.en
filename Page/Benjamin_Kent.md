BENJAMIN KENT (1708â€“1788) was an American minister and later the Massachusetts Attorney General before the American Revolution and acting Attorney General during much of Robert Treat Paine's tenure (1777-1785).[1] Prior to the American Revolution, Kent was the lawyer who took on most of the cases of slaves suing their masters for personal illegal enslavement,[2] which contributed to the demise of slavery in Massachusetts. He has been called an "ardent patriot"[3] and was a member of the North End Caucus and prominent member of the Sons of Liberty, which formed to protest the passage of the Stamp Act of 1765.[4] The efforts of the Sons of Liberty created the foundation for the Boston Tea Party. Kent called for independence early in the American Revolution.


Career

Kent graduated Harvard College in the class of 1727.[5] After being ordained at Marlborough, Massachusetts, he became chaplain at Fort George in Maine, then pastor at the Marlborough Congregational church in 1733.[6] In 1735 he was dismissed and later tried as a heretic.[7] He then studied for the bar and practiced in Worcester County, Massachusetts from 1757 to 1767, and became famous in Boston.

He represented numerous slaves in their attempts to gain their freedom. While Kent was affirming a slave's right to sue his or her master, he was reported to have given slaves as part of his daughter's dowery in 1774.[8] He handled the case of a slave Pompey suing his master.[9] Kent was the first lawyer in the United States to win a case to free a slave Jenny Slew, in 1766.[10] He also won a trial in the Old County Courthouse for a slave named Ceasar Watson (1771).[11] Kent also handled Lucy Pernam's divorce and the freedom suits of Rose and Salem Orne.[12]

He was occasionally a guest at the Old Colony Club, which included a mentoree John Adams. Kent has been described as one of Adams' "role-model in the elite of the Boston bar."[13]

American Revolution

Kent was a senior member of the Sons of Liberty in Boston and maintained correspondence with John Wilkes.[14] On the eve of the American Revolution he was reported to be a member of more town committees than any other Bostonian. After the Siege of Boston, Kent urged Adams to create the Declaration of Independence:

    "It is as certain that the Colonies Will be wholly divorced from that Accursed Kingdom calld Great Britain, as that there will be any eclipses of the Sun or Moon this year... you will have nothing to do, but to Convince 'em that the present time to make a final declaration of Independence is the best."[15]

In response, Adams assured Kent that the "'Declarations in Words' of What is every day manifested in Deeds of the most determined Nature" was forthcoming.[16]

On August 4, 1776, Kent wrote Samual Adams, "It is GOD's doing the bringing about his truly astonishing and unparalled'd _union_ the declaration of Independence."[17]

The loyalist Sampson Salter Blowers became Kent's son-in-law. Kent eventually was forced to put Blowers in jail.[18] Kent's wife and children later moved with Blowers to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Kent took over the abandoned Blowers mansion.

Governor Thomas Cushing sent Kent to Halifax to retrieve the probate records for Suffolk County, Massachusetts after the Revolution in 1784. The records had been taken by the son of Edward Winslow (scholar) and given to the loyalist Foster Hutchinson, who had left Boston on the eve of the Revolution (1776).[19] Nova Scotia Governor John Parr facilitated the negotiations.


Personal life

Kent was the son of Joseph Kent of Charlestown, and was baptised in June 1708 at First Parish in Cambridge.[20] In 1740 he married Elizabeth Watts in Chelsea, Massachusetts, with whom he had three daughters, Elizabeth, Ann, and Sally.[21] His daughter Sally married Sampson Salter Blowers.

When Blowers, a loyalist, was obliged to move to Halifax after the revolution, Kent's daughters and wife went with him. Kent, at age 78, joined them in 1785. He died there three years later and is buried in the Old Burying Ground.[22]


Legacy

He was a friend of Benjamin Franklin who wrote upon hearing of Kent's death: "[my] poor friend Ben Kent is gone, I hope to the regions of the blessed... he was an honest man, and had his virtues."[23] Many years after Kent died, former president John Adams wrote that Kent was one of the "industrious men, who were agents in the Revolution ... that should not be forgotten."[24] There has been controversy among historians over whether or not Kent was a Patriot or Loyalist. Despite Kent's commitment to the Patriot cause, remaining part of John Adams inner circle and fulfilling the role of the acting Attorney General throughout the war, some historians have labeled Kent a loyalist for moving to Nova Scotia after the war to be with his (loyalist) family. Sabine, for example, includes Kent in his list of Loyalist while Stark does not.[25][26] Sibley indicates Kent is a patriot.[27] The editor for Adam's collected works, Charles Adams (John Adams' grandson), identifies that Kent was a patriot.[28]
