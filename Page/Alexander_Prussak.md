A.F.Prussak.jpg ALEXANDER PRUSSAK (1839 – 20 January 1897, in St. Petersburg) was a Russian otologist.

He studied at the Medical-Surgical Academy in St. Petersburg, obtaining his medical degree in 1862. Afterwards, he studied abroad for a few years, and following his return to St. Petersburg, he attained a professorship in otology at the Academy (1870).[1][2]

He is remembered for his studies involving the vasomotor branches of the ear.[3] His name is associated with "Prussak's fibers", which is elastic and connective tissue fiber bounding Shrapnell's membrane, and with "Prussak's space", a small recess of the middle ear.[4]

In addition to his medical works written in Russian, he was the author of a few articles published in German, such as:

-   _Ueber die anatomischen Verhältnisse des Trommelfells zum Hammer_, 1867 – On the anatomy of the tympanic membrane to the malleus.[5]
-   _Zur Physiologie und Anatomie des Blutstromes in der Trommelhöhle_, 1868 – The physiology and anatomy involving blood supply to the tympanic membrane.[6]
