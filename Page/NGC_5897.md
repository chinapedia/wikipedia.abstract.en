NGC 5897 is a globular cluster in the constellation Libra. This satellite of the Milky Way, which is quite remote (located about 24,000 light years away), has a diameter of over 170 light years. With its Shapleyâ€“Sawyer Concentration Class of XI, it has very low star density even in its center.[1]

The stars of the cluster have only one per cent of the sun's metallicity,[2] which means that they were formed in a time before the galaxy formed a disk and spiral arms.

NGC 5897 has a diameter of 12.6 arcminutes and an apparent magnitude of 8.5.
