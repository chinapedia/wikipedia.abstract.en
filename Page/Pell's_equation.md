PELL'S EQUATION (also called the PELL–FERMAT EQUATION) is any Diophantine equation of the form

_x_² − _n__y_² = 1 

where _n_ is a given positive nonsquare integer and integer solutions are sought for _x_ and _y_. In Cartesian coordinates, the equation has the form of a hyperbola; solutions occur wherever the curve passes through a point whose _x_ and _y_ coordinates are both integers, such as the trivial solution with _x_ = 1 and _y_ = 0. Joseph Louis Lagrange proved that, as long as _n_ is not a perfect square, Pell's equation has infinitely many distinct integer solutions. These solutions may be used to accurately approximate the square root of _n_ by rational numbers of the form _x/y_.

This equation was first studied extensively in India, starting with Brahmagupta, who developed the _chakravala_ method to solve Pell's equation and other quadratic indeterminate equations in his _Brahma Sphuta Siddhanta_ in 628, about a thousand years before Pell's time. His _Brahma Sphuta Siddhanta_ was translated into Arabic in 773 and was subsequently translated into Latin in 1126. Bhaskara II in the 12th century and Narayana Pandit in the 14th century both found general solutions to Pell's equation and other quadratic indeterminate equations. Solutions to specific examples of Pell's equation, such as the Pell numbers arising from the equation with _n_ = 2, had been known for much longer, since the time of Pythagoras in Greece and to a similar date in India. The name of Pell's equation arose from Leonhard Euler mistakenly attributing Lord Brouncker's solution of the equation to John Pell.As early as 1732–1733 Euler believed that John Pell had developed a method to solve Pell's equation, even though Euler knew that Wallis had developed a method to solve it (although William Brouncker had actually done most of the work):

(But if such an _a_ be a number that can be reduced in no way to these formulas, the specific method for finding _p_ and _q_ is applied which _Pell_ and _Fermat_ have used for some time now.) From p. 183: ''"§. 19. Methodus haec extat descripta in operibus _Wallisii_, et hanc ob rem eam hic fusius non expono."'' (§. 19. This method exists described in the works of Wallis, and for this reason I do not present it here in more detail.)

History

As early as 400 BC in India and Greece, mathematicians studied the numbers arising from the _n_ = 2 case of Pell's equation,

_x_² − 2_y_² = 1
and from the closely related equation

_x_² − 2_y_² =  − 1

because of the connection of these equations to the square root of 2.[1] Indeed, if _x_ and _y_ are positive integers satisfying this equation, then _x_/_y_ is an approximation of . The numbers _x_ and _y_ appearing in these approximations, called side and diameter numbers, were known to the Pythagoreans, and Proclus observed that in the opposite direction these numbers obeyed one of these two equations.[2] Similarly, Baudhayana discovered that _x_ = 17, _y_ = 12 and _x_ = 577, _y_ = 408 are two solutions to the Pell equation, and that 17/12 and 577/408 are very close approximations to the square root of 2.

Later, Archimedes approximated the square root of 3 by the rational number 1351/780. Although he did not explain his methods, this approximation may be obtained in the same way, as a solution to Pell's equation.[3] Archimedes's cattle problem involves solving a Pellian equation. It is now generally accepted that this problem is due to Archimedes.[4][5]

Around AD 250, Diophantus considered the equation

_a_²_x_² + _c_ = _y_²,
where _a_ and _c_ are fixed numbers and _x_ and _y_ are the variables to be solved for. This equation is different in form from Pell's equation but equivalent to it. Diophantus solved the equation for (_a_, _c_) equal to (1, 1), (1, −1), (1, 12), and (3, 9). Al-Karaji, a 10th-century Persian mathematician, worked on similar problems to Diophantus.

In Indian mathematics, Brahmagupta discovered that

(_x_₁² − _N__y_₁²)(_x_₂² − _N__y_₂²) = (_x_₁_x_₂ + _N__y_₁_y_₂)² − _N_(_x_₁_y_₂ + _x_₂_y_₁)²
(see Brahmagupta's identity). Using this, he was able to "compose" triples (x₁, y₁, k₁) and (x₂, y₂, k₂) that were solutions of x² − Ny² = k, to generate the new triples

(_x_₁_x_₂ + _N__y_₁_y_₂, _x_₁_y_₂ + _x_₂_y_₁, _k_₁_k_₂)
and (x₁x₂ − Ny₁y₂, x₁y₂ − x₂y₁, k₁k₂). Not only did this give a way to generate infinitely many solutions to x² − Ny² = 1 starting with one solution, but also, by dividing such a composition by k₁k₂, integer or "nearly integer" solutions could often be obtained. For instance, for N = 92, Brahmagupta composed the triple (10, 1, 8) (since 10² − 92(1²) = 8) with itself to get the new triple (192, 20, 64). Dividing throughout by 64 ('8' for x and y) gave the triple (24, 5/2, 1), which when composed with itself gave the desired integer solution (1151, 120, 1). Brahmagupta solved many Pell equations with this method; in particular he showed how to obtain solutions starting from an integer solution of x² − Ny² = k for _k_ = ±1, ±2, or ±4.[6]

The first general method for solving the Pell equation (for all _N_) was given by Bhāskara II in 1150, extending the methods of Brahmagupta. Called the chakravala (cyclic) method, it starts by choosing two relatively prime integers a and b, then composing the triple (a, b, k) (that is, one which satisfies a² − Nb² = k) with the trivial triple (m, 1, m² − N) to get the triple (am + Nb, a + bm, k(m² − N)), which can be scaled down to

$$\left( \frac{am+Nb}{k} \,,\, \frac{a+bm}{k} \,,\, \frac{m^2-N}{k} \right).$$

When m is chosen so that $\frac{a+bm}{k}$ is an integer, so are the other two numbers in the triple. Among such m, the method chooses one that minimizes $\frac{m^2-N}{k}$, and repeats the process. This method always terminates with a solution (proved by Joseph-Louis Lagrange in 1768). Bhaskara used it to give the solution _x_ = 1766319049, _y_ = 226153980 to the notorious _N_ = 61 case.[7]

Several European mathematicians rediscovered how to solve Pell's equation in the 17th century, apparently unaware that it had been solved almost five hundred years earlier in India. Pierre de Fermat found how to solve the equation and in a 1657 letter issued it as a challenge to English mathematicians.In February 1657, Pierre de Fermat wrote two letters about Pell's equation. One letter (in French) was addressed to Bernard Frénicle de Bessy, and the other (in Latin) was addressed to Kenelm Digby, whom it reached via Thomas White and then William Brouncker.

-   The letter to Frénicle appears on pp. 333–334; the letter to Digby, on pp. 334–335.

The letter in Latin to Digby is translated into French in:

-

Both letters are translated (in part) into English in:

-   In a letter to Kenelm Digby, Bernard Frénicle de Bessy said that Fermat found the smallest solution for _N_ up to 150, and challenged John Wallis to solve the cases _N_ = 151 or 313. Both Wallis and William Brouncker gave solutions to these problems, though Wallis suggests in a letter that the solution was due to Brouncker.[8]

John Pell's connection with the equation is that he revised Thomas Branker's translation of Johann Rahn's 1659 book "Teutsche Algebra"[9] into English, with a discussion of Brouncker's solution of the equation. Leonhard Euler mistakenly thought that this solution was due to Pell, as a result of which he named the equation after Pell.

The general theory of Pell's equation, based on continued fractions and algebraic manipulations with numbers of the form $P+Q\sqrt{a},$ was developed by Lagrange in 1766–1769.[10]


Solutions

Fundamental solution via continued fractions

Let $\tfrac{h_i}{k_i}$ denote the sequence of convergents to the regular continued fraction for $\sqrt{n}$. This sequence is unique. Then the pair (_x_₁,_y_₁) solving Pell's equation and minimizing _x_ satisfies _x_₁ = _h_(i)_ and _y_₁ = _k_(i)_ for some _i_. This pair is called the _fundamental solution_. Thus, the fundamental solution may be found by performing the continued fraction expansion and testing each successive convergent until a solution to Pell's equation is found.

As describes, the time for finding the fundamental solution using the continued fraction method, with the aid of the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm for fast integer multiplication, is within a logarithmic factor of the solution size, the number of digits in the pair (_x_₁,_y_₁). However, this is not a polynomial time algorithm because the number of digits in the solution may be as large as , far larger than a polynomial in the number of digits in the input value _n_ .

Additional solutions from the fundamental solution

Once the fundamental solution is found, all remaining solutions may be calculated algebraically from

$$x_k + y_k \sqrt n = (x_1 + y_1 \sqrt n)^k,$$
expanding the right side, equating coefficients of $\sqrt{n}$ on both sides, and equating the other terms on both sides. This yields the recurrence relations

_x__(_k_ + 1) = _x_₁_x__(_k_) + _n__y_₁_y__(_k_),

_y__(_k_ + 1) = _x_₁_y__(_k_) + _y_₁_x__(_k_).

Concise representation and faster algorithms

Although writing out the fundamental solution (_x_₁, _y_₁) as a pair of binary numbers may require a large number of bits, it may in many cases be represented more compactly in the form

$$x_1+y_1\sqrt n = \prod_{i=1}^t (a_i + b_i\sqrt n)^{c_i}$$
using much smaller integers _a__(_i_), _b__(_i_), and _c__(_i_).

For instance, Archimedes' cattle problem is equivalent to the Pell equation x² − 410286423278424y² = 1, the fundamental solution of which has 206545 digits if written out explicitly. However, the solution is also equal to

$$x_1+y_1\sqrt n=u^{2329},$$
where

$$u = x'_1+y'_1\sqrt{4729494} = (300426607914281713365\sqrt{609}+84129507677858393258\sqrt{7766})^2$$
and x′₁ and y′₁ only have 45 and 41 decimal digits, respectively.[11]

Methods related to the quadratic sieve approach for integer factorization may be used to collect relations between prime numbers in the number field generated by , and to combine these relations to find a product representation of this type. The resulting algorithm for solving Pell's equation is more efficient than the continued fraction method, though it still takes more than polynomial time. Under the assumption of the generalized Riemann hypothesis, it can be shown to take time

$$\exp O(\sqrt{\log N\log\log N}),$$
where _N_ = log _n_ is the input size, similarly to the quadratic sieve .

Quantum algorithms

showed that a quantum computer can find a product representation, as described above, for the solution to Pell's equation in polynomial time. Hallgren's algorithm, which can be interpreted as an algorithm for finding the group of units of a real quadratic number field, was extended to more general fields by .


Example

As an example, consider the instance of Pell's equation for _n_ = 7; that is,

_x_² − 7_y_² = 1
The sequence of convergents for the square root of seven are

    {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"

|- ! _h_ / _k_ (Convergent) ! _h_² −7_k_² (Pell-type approximation) |- | 2 / 1 | −3 |- | 3 / 1 | +2 |- | 5 / 2 | −3 |- | 8 / 3 | +1 |}

Therefore, the fundamental solution is formed by the pair (8, 3). Applying the recurrence formula to this solution generates the infinite sequence of solutions

    (1, 0); (8, 3); (127, 48); (2024, 765); (32257, 12192); (514088, 194307); (8193151, 3096720); (130576328, 49353213); ... (sequence (_x_) and (_y_) in OEIS)

The smallest solution can be very large. For example, the smallest solution to x² − 313y² = 1 is (32188120829134849, 1819380158564160), and this is the equation which Frenicle challenged Wallis to solve.[12] Values of _n_ such that the smallest solution of x² − ny² = 1 is greater than the smallest solution for any smaller value of _n_ are

    1, 2, 5, 10, 13, 29, 46, 53, 61, 109, 181, 277, 397, 409, 421, 541, 661, 1021, 1069, 1381, 1549, 1621, 2389, 3061, 3469, 4621, 4789, 4909, 5581, 6301, 6829, 8269, 8941, 9949, ...

(For these records, see (_x_), and (_y_)).


The smallest solution of Pell equations

The following is a list of the smallest solution to x² − ny² = 1 with _n_ ≤ 128. For square _n_, there is no solution except (1, 0). (sequence (_x_) and (_y_) in OEIS, or (_x_) and (_y_) (for nonsquare _n_))

Connections

Pell's equation has connections to several other important subjects in mathematics.

Algebraic number theory

Pell's equation is closely related to the theory of algebraic numbers, as the formula

$$x^2 - n y^2 = (x + y\sqrt n)(x - y\sqrt n)$$
is the norm for the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{n}]$ and for the closely related quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n})$. Thus, a pair of integers (x, y) solves Pell's equation if and only if $x + y \sqrt{n}$ is a unit with norm 1 in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{n}]$. Dirichlet's unit theorem, that all units of $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{n}]$ can be expressed as powers of a single fundamental unit (and multiplication by a sign), is an algebraic restatement of the fact that all solutions to the Pell equation can be generated from the fundamental solution. The fundamental unit can in general be found by solving a Pell-like equation but it does not always correspond directly to the fundamental solution of Pell's equation itself, because the fundamental unit may have norm −1 rather than 1 and its coefficients may be half integers rather than integers.

Chebyshev polynomials

Demeyer (2007) mentions a connection between Pell's equation and the Chebyshev polynomials: If _T_(i)_ (_x_) and _U_(i)_ (_x_) are the Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind, respectively, then these polynomials satisfy a form of Pell's equation in any polynomial ring _R_[_x_], with _n_ = _x_² − 1:

_T__(_i_)² − (_x_² − 1)_U__(_i_ − 1)² = 1. 

Thus, these polynomials can be generated by the standard technique for Pell equations of taking powers of a fundamental solution:

$$T_i + U_{i-1} \sqrt{x^2-1} = (x + \sqrt{x^2-1})^i. \,$$

It may further be observed that, if (_x_(i)_,_y_(i)_) are the solutions to any integer Pell equation, then _x_(i)_ = _T_(i)_ (_x_₁) and _y_(i)_ = _y_₁_U__(_i_ − 1)(_x_₁) (Barbeau, chapter 3).

Continued fractions

A general development of solutions of Pell's equation x² − ny² = 1 in terms of continued fractions of $\sqrt{n}$ can be presented, as the solutions _x_ and _y_ are approximates to the square root of _n_ and thus are a special case of continued fraction approximations for quadratic irrationals.

The relationship to the continued fractions implies that the solutions to Pell's equation form a semigroup subset of the modular group. Thus, for example, if _p_ and _q_ satisfy Pell's equation, then

$$\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ nq & p \end{pmatrix}$$

is a matrix of unit determinant. Products of such matrices take exactly the same form, and thus all such products yield solutions to Pell's equation. This can be understood in part to arise from the fact that successive convergents of a continued fraction share the same property: If _p__(_k_−1)/_q__(_k_−1) and _p__(_k_)/_q__(_k_) are two successive convergents of a continued fraction, then the matrix

$$\begin{pmatrix} p_{k-1} & p_{k} \\ q_{k-1} & q_{k} \end{pmatrix}$$

has determinant (−1)^(_k_).

Størmer's theorem applies Pell equations to find pairs of consecutive smooth numbers. As part of this theory, Størmer also investigated divisibility relations among solutions to Pell's equation; in particular, he showed that each solution other than the fundamental solution has a prime factor that does not divide _n_.

As Lenstra (2002) describes, Pell's equation can also be used to solve Archimedes' cattle problem.


The negative Pell equation

The negative Pell equation is given by

_x_² − _n__y_² =  − 1

It has also been extensively studied; it can be solved by the same method of continued fractions and will have solutions if and only if the period of the continued fraction has odd length. However it is not known which roots have odd period lengths and therefore not known when the negative Pell equation is solvable. A necessary (but not sufficient) condition for solvability is that _n_ is not divisible by 4 or by a prime of form 4_k_ + 3.[13] Thus, for example, _x_² − 3_ny_² = −1 is never solvable, but _x_² − 5_ny_² = −1 may be.

The first few numbers _n_ for which _x_² − _ny_² = −1 is solvable are

    1, 2, 5, 10, 13, 17, 26, 29, 37, 41, 50, 53, 58, 61, 65, 73, 74, 82, 85, 89, 97, 101, 106, 109, 113, 122, 125, 130, 137, 145, 149, 157, 170, 173, 181, 185, 193, 197, 202, 218, 226, 229, 233, 241, 250, ... .

demonstrate that the proportion of square-free _n_ divisible by _k_ primes of the form 4_m_ + 1 for which the negative Pell equation is solvable is at least 40%. If the negative Pell equation does have a solution for a particular _n_, its fundamental solution leads to the fundamental one for the positive case by squaring both sides of the defining equation:

(_x_² − _n__y_²)² = ( − 1)²

implies

(_x_² + _n__y_²)² − _n_(2_x__y_)² = 1.


Transformations

The related equation

_u_² − _d__v_² =  ± 2
(*)

can be used to find solutions to the positive Pell equation for certain _d_. Legendre proved that all primes of form _d_ = 4_m_ + 3 solve one case of (*), with the form 8_m_ + 3 solving the negative, and 8_m_ + 7 for the positive. Their fundamental solution then leads to the one for _x_²−_dy_² = 1. This can be shown by squaring both sides of (*)

(_u_² − _d__v_²)² = ( ± 2)²

to get

(_u_² + _d__v_²)² − _d_(2_u__v_)² = 4.

Since dv² = u² ∓ 2 from (*), it follows that

(_u_² ∓ 1)² − _d_(_u__v_)² = 1,

and so the fundamental solutions to (*) are smaller than those of the associated negative Pell equation. For example, u²-3v² = -2 is {_u_,_v_} = {1, 1}, so _x_² − 3_y_² = 1 has {_x_,_y_} = {2, 1}. On the other hand, _u_² − 7_v_² = 2 is {_u_,_v_} = {3,1}, so _x_² − 7y² = 1 has {_x_,_y_} = {8,3}.

Another related equation,

_u_² − _d__v_² =  ± 4

can also be used to find solutions to Pell equations for certain _d_, this time for the positive and negative case. For the following transformations,[14] if fundamental {_u_,_v_} are both odd, then it leads to fundamental {x,y}.

1. If u² − dv² = −4, and {x,y} = {(_u_² + 3)_u_/2, (_u_² + 1)_v_/2}, then _x_² − _dy_² = −1.

Ex. Let _d_ = 13, then {_u_,_v_} = {3, 1} and {_x_,_y_} = {18, 5}.

2. If _u_² − _dv_² = 4, and {_x_,_y_} = {(_u_² − 3)_u_/2, (_u_² − 1)_v_/2}, then _x_² − _dy_² = 1.

Ex. Let _d_ = 13, then {u,v} = {11, 3} and {x,y} = {649, 180}.

3. If _u_² − _dv_² = −4, and {_x_,_y_} = {(_u_⁴ + 4_u_² + 1)(_u_² + 2)/2, (_u_² + 3)(_u_² + 1)_uv_/2}, then _x_² − _dy_² = 1.

Ex. Let _d_ = 61, then {_u_,_v_} = {39, 5} and {_x_,_y_} = {1766319049, 226153980}.

Especially for the last transformation, it can be seen how solutions to {_u_,_v_} are _much_ smaller than {_x_,_y_}, since the latter are sextic and quintic polynomials in terms of _u_.

[8] In January 1658, at the end of _Epistola XIX_ (letter 19), Wallis effusively congratulated Brouncker for his victory in a battle of wits against Fermat regarding the solution of Pell's equation. From p. 807 of (Wallis, 1693): _"Et quidem cum Vir Nobilissimus, utut hac sibi suisque tam peculiaria putaverit, & altis impervia, (_quippe non omnis fert omnia tellus'') ut ab Anglis haud speraverit solutionem; profiteatur tamen _qu'il sera pourtant ravi d'estre destrompé par cet ingenieux & scavant Signieur_; erit cur & ipse tibi gratuletur. Me quod attinet, humillimas est quod rependam gratias, quod in Victoriae tuae partem advocare dignatus es, … "'' (And indeed, Most Noble Sir [i.e., Viscount Brouncker], he [i.e., Fermat] might have thought [to have] all to himself such an esoteric [subject, i.e., Pell's equation] with its impenetrable profundities (_for all land does not bear all things_ [i.e., not every nation can excel in everything]), so that he might hardly have expected a solution from the English; nevertheless, he avows _that he will, however, be thrilled to be disabused by this ingenious and learned Lord_ [i.e., Brouncker]; it will be for that reason that he [i.e., Fermat] himself would congratulate you. Regarding myself, I requite with humble thanks your having deigned to call upon me to take part in your Victory, … ) [Note: The date at the end of Wallis' letter is "Jan. 20. 1657"; however, that date was according to the old Julian calendar; when Britain finally adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1751, that date became January 30, 1658.]
