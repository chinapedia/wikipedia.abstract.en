TAGAYTAY HIGHLANDS is a mountain resort and mixed-use development situated in Tagaytay, Cavite, Philippines.


History

Tagaytay_Highlands_logo.png Tagaytay_view.jpg Willy Ocier of Belle Corporation was behind the concept of Tagaytay Highlands and patterned it after the life he wished for himself and his family, which he deemed acceptable to the growing population of young professionals of his time. He conceptualized the development as a place for people in the city, particularly in Metro Manila to escape the busy city life. Henry Sy of the SM Group influenced Ocier to enter the property development industry.[1]

Ocier, who was looking for a business partner for Tagaytay Highlands approached Sy, who declined.[2] Sy was skeptical due to Tagaytay's rugged terrain. However Sy's prediction of Tagaytay becoming the next recreation center for Metro Manila residents in the 1980s led Ocier to invest in Tagaytay.[3] Ocier decided to push through with his father, Benito Tan Guat's support. Roberto Ongpin was a partner of Ocier in the project.[4]

Tagaytay Highlands would later be established in April 1994.[5]


Residential developments

Residential areas are being developed within the mountain resort[6] and are divided into three parts namely Highlands, Midlands, and Greenlands.[7]

Among the developments inside the Highlands area of the Tagaytay Highlands is the Woodridge Place, a condominium complex composed of 9 buildings. The architectural design of the buildings were inspired from the designs of mountain resort and ski lodge buildings in Colorado, United States.[8] A residential area patterned after the mountain resort town of Aspen, Colorado named Aspenhills is situated also within the Highlands.[9]

In the Midlands, are residential developments patterned from architecture from different countries. Among these is Katsura which was derived from the Katsura Palace in Kyoto, Japan.[10]


Sport

Tagaytay Highlands hosts sporting facilities at its Sports Center which has a swimming pool, a basketball court, billiard hall, a bowling alley, tennis, badminton, and squash courts, as well as a children's playground.[11]

There are two golf courses in Tagaytay Highlands which includes the Lucky 9 golf course, the first 45-hole golfing resort in Tagaytay.[12][13]
