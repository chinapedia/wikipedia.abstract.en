cocktail, served in a cocktail glass]]

A COCKTAIL is an alcoholic mixed drink, which is either a combination of spirits, or one or more spirits mixed with other ingredients such as fruit juice, flavored syrup, or cream. There are various types of cocktails, based on the number and kind of ingredients added. The origins of the cocktail are debated.


Usage and related terms

The Oxford Dictionaries define cocktail as "An alcoholic drink consisting of a spirit or spirits mixed with other ingredients, such as fruit juice or cream".[1] A cocktail can contain alcohol, a sugar, and a bitter/citrus. When a mixed drink contains only a distilled spirit and a mixer, such as soda or fruit juice, it is a highball. Many of the International Bartenders Association Official Cocktails are highballs. When a mixed drink contains only a distilled spirit and a liqueur, it is a duo, and when it adds a mixer, it is a trio. Additional ingredients may be sugar, honey, milk, cream, and various herbs.[2]

Mixed drinks without alcohol that resemble cocktails are known as "mocktails" or "virgin cocktails".


Etymology

The origin of the word cocktail is disputed. The first recorded use of cocktail not referring to a horse is found in _The Morning Post and Gazetteer_ in London, England, March 20, 1798:[3]

  Mr. Pitt, two petit vers of "L'huile de Venus" Ditto, one of "perfeit amour" Ditto, "cock-tail" (vulgarly called ginger)

_The Oxford English Dictionary_ cites the word as originating in the U.S.[4] The first recorded use of _cocktail_ as a beverage (possibly non-alcoholic) in the United States appears in _The Farmer's Cabinet_, April 28, 1803:[5]

The first definition of cocktail known to be an alcoholic beverage appeared in _The Balance and Columbian Repository_ (Hudson, New York) May 13, 1806; editor Harry Croswell answered the question, "What is a cocktail?":

Etymologist Anatoly Liberman endorses as "highly probable" the theory advanced by Låftman (1946), which Liberman summarizes as follows:[6]

In his book _Imbibe!_ (2007), David Wondrich also speculates that _cocktail_ is a reference to a practice for perking up an old horse by means of a ginger suppository so that the animal would "cock its tail up and be frisky."[7]

Several authors have theorized that cocktail may be a corruption of cock ale.[8][9][10]


Development

There is a lack of clarity on the origins of cocktails.[11] Traditionally cocktails were a mixture of spirits, sugar, water, and bitters.[12] But by the 1860s, a cocktail frequently included a liqueur.[13][14]

The first publication of a bartenders' guide which included cocktail recipes was in 1862 – _How to Mix Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant's Companion_, by "Professor" Jerry Thomas. In addition to recipes for punches, sours, slings, cobblers, shrubs, toddies, flips, and a variety of other mixed drinks were 10 recipes for "cocktails". A key ingredient differentiating cocktails from other drinks in this compendium was the use of bitters. Mixed drinks popular today that conform to this original meaning of "cocktail" include the Old Fashioned whiskey cocktail, the Sazerac cocktail, and the Manhattan cocktail.

]] The ingredients listed (spirits, sugar, water, and bitters) match the ingredients of an Old Fashioned,[15] which originated as a term used by late 19th century bar patrons to distinguish cocktails made the "old-fashioned" way from newer, more complex cocktails.[16]

In the 1869 recipe book _Cooling Cups and Dainty Drinks_, by William Terrington, cocktails are described as:[17]

The term highball appears during the 1890s to distinguish a drink composed only of a distilled spirit and a mixer.[18]

The first "cocktail party" ever thrown was allegedly by Mrs. Julius S. Walsh Jr. of St. Louis, Missouri, in May 1917. Walsh invited 50 guests to her home at noon on a Sunday. The party lasted an hour, until lunch was served at 1 pm. The site of this first cocktail party still stands. In 1924, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis bought the Walsh mansion at 4510 Lindell Boulevard, and it has served as the local archbishop's residence ever since.[19]

During Prohibition in the United States (1919–1933), when alcoholic beverages were illegal, cocktails were still consumed illegally in establishments known as speakeasies. The quality of the liquor available during Prohibition was much worse than previously.[20] There was a shift from whiskey to gin, which does not require aging and is therefore easier to produce illicitly.[21] Honey, fruit juices, and other flavorings served to mask the foul taste of the inferior liquors. Sweet cocktails were easier to drink quickly, an important consideration when the establishment might be raided at any moment. With wine and beer less readily available, liquor-based cocktails took their place, even becoming the centerpiece of the new cocktail party.[22]

Cocktails became less popular in the late 1960s and through the 1970s, until resurging in the 1980s with vodka often substituting the original gin in drinks such as the martini. Traditional cocktails began to make a comeback in the 2000s,[23] and by the mid-2000s there was a renaissance of cocktail culture in a style typically referred to as mixology that draws on traditional cocktails for inspiration but utilizes novel ingredients and often complex flavors.[24]
