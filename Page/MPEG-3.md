MPEG-3 is the designation for a group of audio and video coding standards agreed upon by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) designed to handle HDTV signals at 1080p[1] in the range of 20 to 40 megabits per second.[2] MPEG-3 was launched as an effort to address the need of an HDTV standard while work on MPEG-2 was underway, but it was soon discovered that MPEG-2, at high data rates, would accommodate HDTV.[3] Thus, in 1992[4] HDTV was included as a separate profile in the MPEG-2 standard and MPEG-3 was rolled into MPEG-2.[5]
