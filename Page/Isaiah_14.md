Parashot

The _parashah_ sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.[1] Isaiah 14 is a part of the _Prophecies about the Nations (Isaiah 13–23)_. {P}: open _parashah_; {S}: closed _parashah_.

    [{S} 13:6-22] 14:1-2 {S} 14:3-27 {P} 14:28-32 {P}


Verse 12

    ''"How you are fallen from heaven,

        ''O Lucifer, son of the morning!

    ''How you are cut down to the ground,

        _You who weakened the nations!"_[2]

-   "Fallen from heaven": see for the words of Jesus Christ regarding the fall of Satan.
-   "Lucifer" or "Day-star" (Hebrew: הילל hēylēl, from הלל hâlal, "to shine"). The Septuagint renders it, Ἑωσφόρος Heōsphoros, and Jerome in the Vulgate, "Lucifer, the morning star"; in the Chaldee, "How art thou fallen from high, who wert splendid among the sons of men." The New Oxford Annotated Bible suggests the correlation with "a Canaanite myth of the gods Helel and Shahar (Morning Star and Dawn), who fall from heaven as a result of rebellion."[3]


Verse 29

    _Do not rejoice, all you of Philistia,_
    _Because the rod that struck you is broken;_
    _For out of the serpent’s roots will come forth a viper,_
    _And its offspring will be a fiery flying serpent._[4]
