PERE MARIA ORTS I BOSCH (5 July 1921 – 26 February 2015)[1] was a Valencian writer, historian, researcher, heraldist and art collector. He was a member of the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua (Valencian Language Academy) and was awarded the High Distinction of the Generalitat Valenciana in 2006.


Biography

He was born on the city of Valencia on 5 July 1921. He went to the High School in the Piarist School of Valencia. Although he graduated in Law from in the University of Valencia in 1945, and his historian grandfather Pere Maria Orts i Berdin (1839) was a judge of the Superior Court of Valencia, he never practiced it.

When he was 45 years-old, Orts moved to Benidorm, where his paternal family lived, to conduct research directly related to _la Marina_ (Marina Alta and Marina Baixa). His main goal was to find documents and works of art that were actually from the ancient Kingdom of Valencia, hoping to complete Valencian patrimony and part of its lost history. As an art sponsor, he enlarged his family heritage by buying many works of art. He searched for unique objects in libraries, archives and museums outside Valencian Country, eventually donating most of them to Valencian public institutions, particularly to:

-   Valencian Library: more than 11.000 volumes donated, including 13 incunables.
-   Museum of Fine Arts of Valencia saint Pius V: 229 paintings from the Trecento until the 20th century were donated, as were artistic objects of great value. These encompassed 10 sculptures, chinaware of the _Indian Company,_ glass from Murano, and a combined 69 pieces pottery both from Spain (Manises, Talavera, l'Alcora and Ribesalbes) and other countries (China, Japan and France).

Among his other donations were 3 tapestries, 7 chalices, several candelabrums, 9 pieces of furniture, and even a silver writing desk.

He died on 26 February 2015.[2]
