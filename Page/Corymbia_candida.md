_CORYMBIA CANDIDA_, commonly known as the DESERT GHOST GUM[1] or GHOST GUM,[2] is a bloodwood native to arid parts of the Northern Territory[3] and Western Australia.[4]


Description

The weeping tree typically grows to a height of [5][6] and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, white and powdery bark that it sheds in thin strips.[7] It forms a crown of oppositely arranged leaves. The leaves have cordate shaped blades that can rarely be lanceolate. The concolorous, dull, grey-green to pale green blade has a length of and a width of .[8] It blooms around July and produces axillary compound inflorescences in groups of three buds per umbel. The obovoid to pyriform shaped mature buds have a length of and a width of with a flattened operculum and shallow inflexed stamens and white flowers. The pedicellate fruits that form after flowering have a cupular to cylindrical or barrel shape with a length of and a width of with a descending disc and three enclosed valves. The brown to red-brown coloured seeds within have a length of and a flattened to saucer-like shape.[9]


Taxonomy

The species was first formally described by Kenneth Hill and Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson in 1995 as part of the work _Systematic studies in the eucalypts. A revision of the bloodwoods, genus Corymbia (Myrtaceae)_ as published in the journal _Telopea_. The only synonym is _Eucalyptus candida_[10] _C. candida_ has a strong resemblance to _Corymbia aspera_. The specific epithet is taken from the Latin word _candidus_ meaning _glossy white_ in reference to the starkly white trunk.[11]


Distribution

It is distributed widely through the Pilbara and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia where it grows in breakaway areas and pebbly plains in clay, sand, loam or gravel red coloured soils.[12] It is found as far west as Exmouth and has a scattered distribution extending eastwards through the Gascoyne River catchment to the headwaters and continuing into the Little Sandy Desert, Great Sandy Desert, Gibson Desert and into the Northern Territory and the Tanami Desert.[13]
