Schaffner was born in Tokyo, Japan, the son of American missionaries Sarah Horting (n√©e Swords) and Paul Franklin Schaffner,[1][2] and was raised in Japan. He returned to the United States and graduated from Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he was active in drama. He studied law at Columbia University in New York City but his education was interrupted by service with the United States Navy in World War II during which he served with American amphibious forces in Europe and North Africa. In the latter stages of the war he was sent to the Pacific Far East to serve with the United States Office for Strategic Services.


Career

Returning home after the war, he found work in the television industry with _March of Time_ and then joined the CBS network. He won directing Emmys for his work on the original 1954 CBS teleplay, _Twelve Angry Men_. Schaffner earned two more Emmy awards for his work on the 1955 TV adaptation of the Broadway play, _The Caine Mutiny Court Martial_, shown on the anthology series _Ford Star Jubilee_. He won his fourth Emmy Award for his work on the series, _The Defenders_.

In the realm of network television, Schaffner also received widespread critical acclaim in 1962 for his groundbreaking collaboration with the First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Kennedy and CBS television's Musical Director Alfredo Antonini in the production of A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F. Kennedy- a television special which was broadcast to over 80 million viewers worldwide.[3] Schaffner's contributions in this production earned him a nomination in 1963 by the Director's Guild of America USA, for its award in the category of Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Television.[4]

In 1960, he directed Allen Drury's stage play _Advise and Consent_. His first motion picture _The Stripper_ was praised, and he later made _The Best Man_, _The War Lord_, and _The Double Man_. They were followed by the critical and commercial hit _Planet of the Apes_. His next film, _Patton_ was a major success for which he won the Academy Award for Best Director and the Directors Guild of America Award for Best Director. Later works included _Nicholas and Alexandra_, _Papillon_, _Islands in the Stream_ and _The Boys from Brazil_.

Schaffner was President of the Directors Guild of America from 1987 until his death in 1989.

Frequent collaborators

Jerry Goldsmith composed the music for seven of his films: _The Stripper_, _Planet of the Apes_, _Patton_, _Papillon_, _Islands in the Stream_, _The Boys from Brazil_ and _Lionheart_. Four of them were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score.[5]

Schaffner twice worked with actors Charlton Heston and Maurice Evans (_The War Lord_; _Planet of the Apes_), George C. Scott (_Patton_; _Islands in the Stream_) and Laurence Olivier (_Nicholas and Alexandra_; _The Boys from Brazil_).[6][7][8]


Personal life

Schaffner married Helen Jane Gilchrist in 1948. The couple had two children, Jennie and Kate. She died in 2007.

Schaffner died on July 2, 1989, at the age of 69.[9] He was released 10 days before his death from a hospital where he was being treated for lung cancer.


Critical perception

Screenwriter William Goldman identified Schaffner in 1981 as being one of the three best directors (then living) at handling "scope" (a gift for screen epics) in films. The other two were David Lean and Richard Attenborough.[10]
In 1991 Schaffner's widow Jean established the Franklin J. Schaffner Alumni Medal (colloquially known as the Franklin J. Schaffner Award), which is awarded by the American Film Institute at its annual ceremony to an alumnus of either the AFI Conservatory or the AFI Conservatory Directing Workshop for Women who best embodies the qualities of the late director: talent, taste, dedication and commitment to quality filmmaking.[11]
