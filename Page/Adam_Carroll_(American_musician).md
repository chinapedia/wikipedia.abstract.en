Carroll has eight albums to his credit, all indie releases, beginning with 2000's _South of Town_.

Biography

Carroll was born in 1975 in Tyler, Texas. His father is an attorney and his mother, a musician and choir director. He studied classical guitar and creative writing briefly at Tyler Junior College.[4] He left college in his early 20s, around 1995, and began performing in the Austin-Dallas-San Antonio area, initially in coffeehouses and later at pubs and clubs throughout the region.[5] In 1998, he released his debut _South of Town_ which was followed by _Lookin' Out the Screen Door_ in 2000 and _Adam Carroll Live_ in 2002. All three were produced by Grammy Award-winning producer Lloyd Maines.[6][7]

While on the road, Carroll opened for some of East Texas's top musicians, who took notice of his song writing and began performing his work. Hayes Carll was the first to record a cover of one of Carroll's songs, "Take Me Away", on his 2005 album _Little Rock_.[8] The song, co-written by fellow singer-songwriter John Evans, appeared on the soundtrack of the 2010 film _Country Strong_.[9] Other covers followed, including Slaid Cleaves with "Race Car Joe" on _Unsung_ in 2006 and Band of Heathens with "Maple of Tears" (co-written with band members Ed Jurdi and Gordy Quist) on their studio debut _Band of Heathens_ in 2008.[10]

In 2005, Carroll recorded his third studio album, _Far Away Blues_, which was followed three years later by _Old Town Rock 'n Roll_. He released another live album in 2010, _Live at Flipnotics_, recorded at an iconic Austin coffeehouse that has since closed.[11] In 2014, Carroll put out his fifth studio release, _Let It Choose You_.[12]. In April 2019, Carroll will release a new solo record, _I Walked In them Shoes_, produced again by Lloyd Maines. Later in the year a duo record with his wife, singer songwriter Chris Carroll, titled _Good Farmer_ will also be released.


_Highway Prayer: A Tribute to Adam Carroll_

In 2016, fourteen Texas artists contributed interpretations of Carroll's songs to the album _Highway Prayer: A Tribute to Adam Carroll_, which was released by Eight 30 Records in late October. Participating in the homage were James McMurtry on "Screen Door", Hayes Carll on "Girl with the Dirty Hair", Slaid Cleaves on "South of Town", Band of Heathens on "Oklahoma Gypsy Shuffler", Tim Easton and Aaron Lee Tasjan on "Black Flag Blues", and Terri Hendrix on "Red Bandana Blues". Carroll himself recorded the album's 15th song, the closing track "My Only Good Shirt".[13]

The tribute reached the Americana Music Association charts and caught the attention of the regional and national music press.[14] _No Depression_ described the release as one of "the year's three or four best folk albums." Referring to Carroll's talent as a songwriter, _Rolling Stone_ remarked, "It speaks volumes that McMurtry and Hayes Carll and many more all contribute to (this) new homage to Adam Carroll."[15] And Elmore Magazine summed up the attraction of the album's selections: "Carroll's remarkable knack for creating stunning, visceral portraits of everyday Americans."[16]
