KOREAN FORTRESSES are fortifications constructed by Koreans since the Three Kingdoms of Korea period. Koreans developed a unique and distinct fortress tradition.[1] Korea, beginning with Goguryeo,[2][3][4] has been called "a country of fortresses";[5][6][7][8] almost 2,400 mountain fortress sites have been found in Korea.[9][10]

There are numerous types of Korean fortresses, including _sanseong_ (mountain fortress), _eupseong_ (city fortress), _pyeongjiseong_, _gwanseong_, _jangseong_, _chaekseong_, and more.[11]


History

Korean fortresses were based on a stone culture and built with stones on natural mountainous terrain; therefore, they are conceptually completely different compared to Chinese fortresses, which were based on an earth culture and built with bricks and stamped earth on flat land.[12][13] Korean fortresses were invented by Goguryeo and spread to Baekje and Silla,[14] and then inherited and further developed by Goryeo and then Joseon.[15]


Sites

Almost 2,400 mountain fortress sites have been found in Korea.[16][17]

Goguryeo fortress ruins have been found in about 170 sites to date, including in China;[18] one of the most notable among them is Ansi Fortress, which successfully defended against Tang Taizong during the Goguryeo–Tang War.[19][20] Goguryeo fortress ruins have also been found in present-day Mongolia.[21][22][23]

Korean-style fortresses can be found in Japan, which were constructed and supervised by immigrants of Baekje origin.[24]

UNESCO

Hwaseong Fortress and Namhansanseong are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[25][26]
