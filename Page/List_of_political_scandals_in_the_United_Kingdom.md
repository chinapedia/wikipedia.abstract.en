POLITICAL SCANDALS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM are commonly referred to by the press and commentators as "'SLEAZE".


Sleaze

A number of political scandals in the 1980s and 1990s created the impression of what was described in the British press as "sleaze": a perception that the then Conservative government was associated with political corruption and hypocrisy. This was revived in the late 1990s due to accounts of so-called "sleaze" by the Labour government.

-   In 2002, Edwina Currie revealed that she had had an affair, beginning in 1984, with John Major before he became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

-   In March 2006 it emerged that the Labour Party had borrowed millions of pounds in 2005 to help fund their general election campaign.

This became known as "piggate".[26] It also led to questions about the Prime Minister's honesty with party donor's known tax statuses as Lord Ashcroft suggested he had openly discussed his non-dom status with him in 2009, earlier than previously thought.[27]

In January 2017, the scandal caused the resignation of the deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, after Foster refused to stand aside as First Minister pending an investigation, collapsing the Executive Office.
