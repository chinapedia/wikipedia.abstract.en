EUSSOUIS is a character featured in an epic Roman poem passed on via the oral tradition [1] that was all but lost following the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century A.D. Some believe the poem was originally of ancient Greek origin due to the nature of the subject matter, and suggest that it should be included in the Epic Cycle [2] as an essential albeit incomplete work.

Only fragments of the story were preserved which tell of a great but evil queen, Eussouis, who sought to take control of the kingdom her husband, King Orteian, had lost after being banished for having wooed his brother's young daughter, Scaelus. Once the former subjects of Eussouis learned of the deceptive methods she utilized to inspire them to rise up and regain control of the lost kingdom for her, they turned on her, capturing both her and Orteian and beheaded them in a public ceremony. Scaelus was then awarded the wealth that was left behind as restitution for her years of suffering.


Title

It is unclear what title was used for the original oral tradition poem, however there is speculation that it was the same as the main character, "Eussouis."


Significance

It is believed that William Shakespeare was influenced by the fragmented poem, incorporating elements in various ways throughout his works.
