The 2017 NEW ORLEANS SAINTS SEASON was the franchise's 51st season in the National Football League, the 42nd to host games at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome and the eleventh under head coach Sean Payton. The team improved on their 7–9 output from last season, while achieving an 8-game winning streak after losing their first two contests, their longest streak (tied with their 2011 team) since 2009, when they won Super Bowl XLIV. In Week 13 the Saints clinched their first winning season since 2013 and swept the Carolina Panthers for the first time since 2011. In Week 16, the Saints clinched a playoff spot for the first time since 2013 by defeating the Atlanta Falcons. In Week 17, the Saints clinched the NFC South for the first time since 2011 with the Panthers loss to the Falcons. On January 7, 2018 the Saints played their divisional rivals the Carolina Panthers in the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. They beat Carolina for the third time, 31–26 in the Wild Card, but in a rematch of the infamous 2009 NFC Championship Game also known as the "BountyGate Game", fell to the Minnesota Vikings 24–29 in the Divisional Round in a dramatic ending.

This year was Tom Benson's final season as owner of the Saints, as he died at the age of 90 on March 15, 2018 from influenza.[1]
