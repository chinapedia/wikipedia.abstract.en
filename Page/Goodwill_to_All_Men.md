Georgina Worsley (born 28 November 1895) arrives to live at Eaton Place in 1913. She is the step-daughter of Lady Marjorie's brother Hugo Talbot-Carey (the new Earl of Southwold). His new wife is the widow Marion Worsely, and mother of Georgina by her previous marriage. Georgina's natural father died in a hunting accident when she was six years old. Her mother and step-father die along with Lady Marjorie in the sinking of the _RMS Titanic_ in 1912. After that she moves into 165 Eaton Place right before Christmas in December 1913. Georgina is deeply moved by Daisy Peel's (the new under house parlour maid) history of her family. Georgina goes with the new under house parlour maid Daisy and a lot of presents to Daisy's family in Hoxton. But Daisy's father is dead and her mother is now married to a drunk and violent alcoholic named Bill. Daisy sees that her mother is ill and she beats Bill.[1][2]
