Verse 4

Isaiah_Wall.jpg KJV
Bible verse written on a wall across the street from the headquarters of the United Nations in New York City]]

    _And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more._[3]

Many speeches and movements concerned with peace and the adaptation of military technology to peaceful uses have adopted the phrase "swords into plowshares".


Verse 5

    _O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the ._[4]

The first part of this verse in Hebrew: "בית יעקב לכו ונלכה" _Beit Ya'akov Lekhu Venelkha_ ("House of Jacob, let us go [up]") is the basis of the acronym "Bilu" (Hebrew בילו) which became the name of a twentieth-century movement in Israel.[5]


Verse 6

    _Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers._[6]

-   "They be replenished from the east" (King James Version) or "They are filled with eastern ways" (New King James Version): This phrase is amended in Revised Version to "_they are full of diviners from the east_", which is consistent with the following words:



        _... and of soothsayers like the Philistines._


Verse 22

    _Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of ?_[7]

The New King James Version renders this verse:

    _Sever yourselves from such a man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for of what account is he?_

This verse is not found in the Septuagint, and could be a later insertion in Isaiah's prophecy.[8]
