DARREN LOK YEE DENG (born 14 December 1990) is an English-born Malaysian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Johor Darul Ta'zim F.C. II in the Malaysia Premier League as well as for the Malaysia national team.[1]


Early life

Born in East Sussex, Lok is of Malaysian-English descent.


Senior career

Eastbourne Borough

Lok began his career with the Eastbourne Borough Academy. Later, he was promoted to the senior squad in 2012. At the start of the 2012-13 season, he was loaned to Horsham. He impressed at Horsham,[2][3] but was recalled by Eastbourne after 2 games, due to a player shortage at the club.[4]

Early in his Borough career, Lok gained a reputation as a 'super-sub' due to the late goals he would score after coming off the bench.[5] He was later increasingly used as a starting player.

Johor Darul Ta'zim

At the end of the 2015-16 season, Lok left Eastbourne to sign for Johor Darul Ta'zim II of the Malaysia Premier League. His registration was delayed, due to having to apply for a Malaysian passport. In September 2016 he received his Malaysian passport, which enabled him to play for JDT II as well as the Malaysia national football team.[6] Darren Lok only managed to appear twice for the JDT II Team before the season ended.

For the 2017 Malaysia Super League, JDT Coach Mario Gómez announced that Lok would be promoted to the JDT first team from JDT II for the upcoming 2017 season.


International career

Lok plays for Malaysia. He received his first international caps against Singapore on 7 October 2016. In August 2017, Lok scored his first international goal against Syria at Hang Jebat Stadium, Malacca.
