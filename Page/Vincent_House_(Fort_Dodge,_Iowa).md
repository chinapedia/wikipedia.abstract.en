The VINCENT HOUSE is a historic building located in Fort Dodge, Iowa, United States. The distinguishing features of this three-story, red brick, Second Empire house is its mansard roof and wrap-around porch.[1] Web Vincent moved his family into the house in 1879 and it remained in the Vincent family until 1969 when Anne R. Vincent died. Vincent was a businessman who made his fortune in the local gypsum industry. A ballroom was located on the third floor and its walls were composed of gypsum plaster, which was the first time it was used in the United States.[2] The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.[3]
