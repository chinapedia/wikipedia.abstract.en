The start was discussed in an opening for the whole country culture but Joelma've chosen to only to the capitals where they were printed.

For each city we used the theme of culture, first to Belém culture with Carimbó, then a soldier representing Brasilia with a musical background of the start of the national anthem, then immediately one dancer Frevo representing Recife an instrumental sound _Tchau Pra Você_ but executed in the rhythm of Frevo, after that a player of Capoeira representing Salvador and to end a flag bearer representing the Rio de Janeiro with the instrumental sound of ''Isso é Calypso" in rhythm Samba.
