JOELLE KHOURY is a Lebanese-American[1] pianist and a jazz and contemporary classical music composer.[2][3]


Background

Born in Beirut in 1963, Joelle Khoury left Lebanon for the United States after the beginning of the Lebanese civil war. She obtained a degree in Economics and Musicology at George Mason University, Virginia. Returning to Lebanon several years later, she received a master's degree in philosophy from Saint Joseph University and a piano diploma from the Lebanese Higher Conservatory of Music.

She has been invited on Extra-muros residencies in France (2002 and 2004), Czech Republic (2006),[4] Switzerland (2011, through Pro Helvetia)[5] and the United-States (2013) as a MacDowell Colony fellow, where she worked on her multimedia performance _Palais de femmes_.[6]

For almost two decades, she has composed contemporary classical music pieces and concertos for chamber and philharmonic orchestras, as well as pieces for her own jazz quintet. Her idea of composition, not restricted to specific standard styles, eras, geographical spaces or music categories _stricto sensu_, led her toward contemporary music within complex jazz forms and non-traditional classical music structures. Rather than "orientalizing" her music – as a Lebanese composer – she always thought that "A true composition is the fruit of a unique idea, developed into a concept, based in what the composer has heard, aiming at expressing an individual point of view, a certain personality. Therefore it is neither "western" nor "oriental", taking into account the fact that we have all heard numerous styles of music […]".[7]

Her interest in philosophy led her, after years of musical production, towards the preparation of a Ph.D. thesis on Gilles Deleuze titled _Théâtralité et Désir de mort créateur chez Gilles Deleuze._


Major achievements

In 1995, she founded _In-Version_, a jazz quintet performing original compositions which combine a contemporary bebop style with complex counterpoint lines. Tunes as _Circles, Is it so!, Just when you least expect_ (from the album _Is it so!_) are typical examples of how melodies evolve on backing composite lines, which are as fundamental as the melody itself. The same concept is also encountered in some classical contemporary arrangements by the composer, with very complex and intricate backing lines, though smoothly supporting the simplest melodies.

An Arabic opera monodrama for woman's voice (sung by Fadia Tomb El Hage), composed in 2008 and first played in Beirut by the Belgian chamber orchestra _Fragments_ Ensemble,[8] was also performed on May 4, 2012, at Esterházy Palace, Eisenstadt, Austria, by Kremerata Baltica (founded by Gidon Kremer in 1997) and in Switzerland, by the TaG ensemble.[9]

Middle Eastern traditional songs, rearranged on a contemporary classical music basis. _Variations on Imaginary Folk Dances_ (string orchestra and voice) was commissioned by _Kremerata Baltica_ for their 2012 concert, _Arab-Baltic Spring,_ at Esterházy Palace, Eisenstadt, Austria.[10] In 2014, the piece was performed again on May 29 in _Fürth_ and in _Würzburg_, Germany, by the Kremerata, along with the piece _Of Memories, Folks and I_ (string orchestra, percussion and voice).[11] Both pieces, conducted by Andris Veismanis,[12] are based on Middle Eastern folk music, and yet expressed in contemporary style, rendered by the Lebanese alto Fadia Tomb El Hage. The 2014 concert was live-streamed by the Bayerischer Rundfunk. A symphonic version of these two pieces was also performed in May 2013, by the Lebanese National Symphony Orchestra at Saint Joseph University church, Beirut.

_Morning Star_ is a Syriac traditional church song, rearranged for brass quintet and commissioned by _Donne in Musica_,[13] Italy, for a Christmas concert (Natale in Musica 2006). _Donne in Musica_ also commissioned _Getting along,_ a concerto for two marimbas and string orchestra, performed May 2008 in Bari, Italy.

Multimedia performances: A number of performances and recordings consisting of poems put into music (_Music and poetry_, recorded live in May 2003) or played in contemporary performances which gather poetry, acting, music and painting; among which are _Senghor_,[14] _Électroésie_[15]_, Les poètes témoignent_[16] and _Palais de femmes_.[17]

Khoury has also published articles, including _Times Goes One Way - Against the Classification of Arts_,[18] and _Die Geschichte - Ein göttliches Gedicht_ ("History, a divine poem"),[19] associating Bach's compositional style to Leibniz's Monadology.
