The JEAN-LUCIEN HOLLENFELTZ COLLECTION consists of the private collection of physician, humanist, and scholarly musician Jean-Lucien Hollenfeltz, which is held by the Royal Conservatory of Brussels. The collection contains books and musical documents from Constanze Mozart (1762–1842) and her youngest son, Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart (1791–1844).


Biography

Wiki_-_Ex-Libris_Hollenfeltz.jpg Born in Arlon in 1898, Hollenfeltz was involved in the resistance movement of WWII, at the end of which he was assassinated close to his home by German soldiers. This GP, provincial president of the International Red Cross, was also a historian, an archaeologist and a musicologist, interested in 18th century music, specifically in Mozart and his circle.[1]

A member of associations such as the International Musicological Society, the Société Française de Musicologie or the Société d'études mozartiennes, he fostered musical life in his hometown and maintained relations with musicologists specialised in subjects related to the Austrian composer.[2]

In April 1944, knowing his days counted, he donated a major part of his private collection to the library of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels.


The collection

The comprehensive musicological Hollenfeltz collection, consisting of 425 documents and including many ancient and high-value unpublished pieces, includes musicological reviews and works, bibliographical editions, studies and biographic notes, as well as original scores and autograph manuscripts. It also holds 73 original scores from Hollenfeltz himself, initially written for performance at the "La Renaissance" concerts he organised and directed in his home town.[3] The collection was catalogued electronically by the Flemish Brussels Conservatory (_Koninklijk Conservatorium Brussel_).[4]

Next to this _unicum_, the collection contains a handwritten travel diary[5] of nearly 300 pages from her son, Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart, along with autograph letters of the latter between 1802 and 1843 to his mother, his brother Karl Thomas Mozart, his stepfather Georg Nikolaus von Nissen and several editors in Leipzig, including Carl Friedrich Peters or Breitkopf & Härtel.

Mozart (1791–1844), such as the _Rondo for pianoforte in F major_ of 1802, of which the first 16 measures were written and abandoned by his father.

This collection also holds an iconography of engravings, lithographs and, occasionally, photos.
