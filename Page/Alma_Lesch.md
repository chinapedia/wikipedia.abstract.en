ALMA LESCH (March 12, 1917 – May 15, 1999) was an American fiber artist known for her fiber portraits.[1] She was "the undisputed grande dame of Kentucky textile arts."[2] A historic marker notes her achievements in Shepherdsville, where Lesch lived and had her studio.[3] Lesch's quilt, _Bathshebas Bedspread_, was included in the _Objects USA_ exhibit in 1969, which was organized by S.C. Johnson and Son.[4]


Early life

Lesch began her first quilt at the age of five, completing it seven years later.[5] She graduated from Murray State University in 1941 and earned a master's degree in education from the University of Louisville in 1962.[6]


Career

Lesch taught at the Louisville School of Art and the University of Louisville.[7] She also taught at the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts and Arrowmont School of Crafts.

Her style frequently used found objects, quilting of personal garments, and embroidery in her works.[8] Her fiber portraits are fabric collages made from antique clothing, however they intentionally exclude the subject's face and limbs, allowing the viewer to imagine the subject.[9] She pioneered this style of portrait in the 1960s, in which she arranged "clothing stitched on to a quilt as though they were positioned for a portrait."[10] Although her contemporary, Marilyn Pappas, used a similar technique,[11] Lesch's portraits are unique in that they touch on the themes of her life lived in Kentucky, including farming, social manners, and folk art.

Lesch influenced other artists such as Jane Burch Cochran. She was named a Master Craftsman by the World Craft Council in 1974 and a Fellow of the Kentucky Guild of Artists and Craftsmen in 1986. She won the Kentucky Governor's Award for Lifetime Contribution to Visual Arts in 1987.[12]
