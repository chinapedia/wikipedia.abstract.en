ROBERT MUSIL ( or ; 6 November 1880 – 15 April 1942) was an Austrian philosophical writer. His unfinished novel _The Man Without Qualities_ () is generally considered to be one of the most important and influential modernist novels.


Family

Musil was born in Klagenfurt, Carinthia, the son of engineer Alfred _Edler von_[1] Musil (1846, Timișoara – 1924) and his wife Hermine Bergauer (1853, Linz – 1924). The orientalist Alois Musil ("The Czech Lawrence") was his second cousin.[2]

Soon after Robert's birth, the family moved to Chomutov in Bohemia, and in 1891 Musil's father was appointed to the chair of Mechanical Engineering at the German Technical University in Brno and, later, raised to hereditary nobility in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was baptized _Robert Mathias Musil_ and his name was officially _Robert Mathias Edler von Musil_ from 22 October 1917, when his father was ennobled (made _Edler_), until 3 April 1919, when the use of noble titles was forbidden in Austria.


Early life

They sent him to a military boarding school at Eisenstadt (1892–1894) and then Hranice (1894–1897). The school experiences are reflected in his first novel _Die Verwirrungen des Zöglings Törless_ (_The Confusions of Young Törless_).


Youth and studies

After graduating Musil studied at a military academy in Vienna during the fall of 1897 but then switched to mechanical engineering, joining his father's department at the Technical University in Brno. During his university studies, he studied engineering by day, and at night read literature and philosophy, and went to the theatre and art exhibitions. Friedrich Nietzsche, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Ernst Mach were particular interests of his university years. Musil finished his studies in three years and, in 1902–1903, served as an unpaid assistant to Professor of Mechanical Engineering , in Stuttgart.

During that time, he began work on _Young Törless_.

He also invented , the Musil color top, a motorised device for producing mixed colours by additive colour-mixing with two differently colored, sectored, rotating discs. This was an improvement over earlier models, allowing a user to vary the proportions of the two colors during rotation and to read off those proportions precisely.[3]

Musil's sexual life around the turn of the century, according to his own records, was mainly with a prostitute, which he treated partly as an experimental self-experience.[4] But he was also infatuated with the pianist and mountaineer Valerie Hilpert, who assumed mystical features.[5] In March 1902, Musil underwent treatment for syphilis with mercurial ointment. During this time, his several years of relationship with Hermine Dietz, the 'Tonka' of his own novel, published in 1923, began. Hermine's syphilitic miscarriage in 1906 and her death in 1907 may be due to infection by Musil.[6]

Musil grew tired of engineering and what he perceived as the limited world-view of the engineer. He launched a new round of doctoral studies (1903–1908) in psychology and philosophy at the University of Berlin under the renowned Professor Carl Stumpf. In 1905, Musil met his future wife, Martha Marcovaldi (née Heimann, 21 January 1874 – 6 November 1949). She had already been widowed and remarried, with two children, and was seven years older than Musil. His first novel, _Young Törless_, was published in 1906.


Author

In 1909, Musil completed his doctorate and Professor Alexius Meinong offered him a position at the University of Graz, which he turned down to concentrate on writing of novels. Over the next two years, he wrote and published two stories ("The Temptation of Quiet Veronica" and "The Perfecting of a Love") collected in _Vereinigungen_ (_Unions_) published in 1911. During the same year, Martha's divorce was completed, and Musil married her. As she was Jewish and Musil Roman Catholic, they both converted to Protestantism as a sign of their union.1 2 3 Until then, Musil had been supported by his family, but he now found employment first as a librarian in the Technical University of Vienna and then in an editorial role with the Berlin literary journal _Die neue Rundschau_. He also worked on a play entitled _Die Schwärmer_ (_The Enthusiasts_), which was published in 1921.

Klagenfurt_-_Musilhaus_-_Robert_Musil.jpg]] When World War I began, Musil joined the Army and was stationed first in Tirol and then at Austria's Supreme Army Command in Bolzano. In 1916, Musil visited Prague and met Franz Kafka, whose work he held in high esteem. After the war's end, and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Musil returned to his literary career in Vienna. He published a collection of short stories, _Drei Frauen_ (_Three Women_), in 1924. He also admired the Bohemian poet Rainer Maria Rilke, whom Musil called "great and not always understood" at his memorial service in 1927 in Berlin. According to Musil, Rilke "did nothing but perfect the German poem for the first time," but by the time of his death, Rilke had turned into "a delicate, well-matured liqueur suitable for grown-up ladies".[7] However, his work is "too demanding" to be "considered relaxing".[8]

In 1930 and 1933, he published his masterpiece, _The Man Without Qualities_ (_Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften_),[9] in two volumes consisting of three parts, from Berlin, running into 1,074 pages.[10] Volume 1 (Part I: A Sort of Introduction, and Part II: The Like of It Now Happens) and 605-page unfinished Volume 2 (Part III: Into the Millennium (The Criminals)).[11] Part III did not include 20 chapters withdrawn from Volume 2 of 1933 in printer's galley proofs. The novel deals with the moral and intellectual decline of the Austro-Hungarian Empire through the eyes of the book's protagonist, Ulrich, an ex-mathematician who has failed to engage with the world around him in a manner that would allow him to possess _qualities_. It is set in Vienna on the eve of World War I.

_The Man Without Qualities_ brought Musil only mediocre commercial success. Though he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature, he felt that he did not receive the recognition he deserved. He sometimes expressed annoyance at the success of more famous colleagues like Thomas Mann or Hermann Broch, who admired his work deeply and tried to shield him from economic difficulties and encouraged his writing even though Musil was initially critical of Mann.

In the early 1920s, Musil lived mostly in Berlin. In Vienna, Musil was a frequent visitor to Eugenie Schwarzwald's salon (the model for Diotima in _The Man Without Qualities_). In 1932, the Robert Musil Society was founded in Berlin on the initiative of Mann. In the same year, Mann was asked to name outstanding contemporary novels, and he cited only one, _The Man Without Qualities_. In 1936, Musil suffered his first stroke.


Thought

The fundamental problem Musil confronts in his essays and fiction is the crisis of Enlightenment values which engulfed Europe during the early twentieth century.[12] He endorses the Enlightenment project of emancipation while at the same time examining its shortcomings with a questioning irony.[13] Musil believed that the crisis required a renewal in social and individual values which, accepting science and reason, could liberate humanity in beneficent ways.[14] Musil wrote:

  After the Enlightenment most of us lost courage. A minor failure was enough to turn us away from reason, and we allowed every barren enthusiast to inveigh against the intentions of a d'Alembert or a Diderot as mere rationalism. We beat the drums for feeling against intellect and forgot that without intellect...feeling is as dense as a blockhead (_dick wie ein Mops ist_).[15]

He took aim at the ideological chaos and misleading generalizations about culture and society promoted by nationalist reactionaries. Musil wrote a withering critique of Oswald Spengler titled "Mind and Experience: Notes for Readers Who Have Escaped the Decline of the West (_Geist und Erfahrung: Anmerkung für Leser, welche dem Untergang des Abendlandes entronnen sind_)" in which he dismantles the latter's misunderstanding of science and misuse of axiomatic thinking to try to understand human complexity and promote a deterministic philosophy.[16]

He deplored the social conditions under the Austro-Hungarian Empire and foresaw its disappearance.[17] Surveying the upheavals of the 1910s and 20s, Musil hoped that Europe could find an internationalist solution to the "dead end of imperial nationalism."[18] In 1927, he signed a declaration of support for the Austrian Social Democratic Party.[19]

Musil was a staunch individualist who opposed the authoritarianism of both right and left. A recurring theme in his speeches and essays through the 1930s is the defense of the autonomy of the individual against the authoritarian and collectivist concepts then prevailing in Germany, Italy, Austria, and Russia.[20] He participated in the anti-fascist International Writers' Congress for the Defense of Culture in 1935 in which he spoke in favor of artistic independence against the claims of the state, class, nation, and religion.[21]


Later life

The last years of Musil's life were dominated by Nazism and World War II: the Nazis banned his books. He saw early Nazism first-hand while he was living in Berlin from 1931 to 1933. In 1938, when Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany, Musil and his Jewish wife, Martha, left for exile in Switzerland, where he died at the age of 61. Martha wrote to Franz Theodor Csokor that he had suffered a stroke.[22]

Only eight people attended his cremation. Martha cast his ashes into the woods of Mont Salève.Markus Kreuzwieser 4

 From 1933 to his death, Musil was working on Part III of _The Man Without Qualities_. In 1943 in Lausanne, Martha published a 462-page collection of material from his literary remains, including the 20 galley chapters withdrawn from Part III before Volume 2 appeared in 1933,[23] as well as drafts of the final incomplete chapters and notes on the development and direction of the novel.[24] She died in Rome in 1949.


Legacy

After his death Musil's work was almost forgotten. His writings began to reappear during the early 1950s. The first translation of _The Man Without Qualities_ in English was published by Ernst Kaiser and Eithne Wilkins in 1953, 1954 and 1960. An updated translation by Sophie Wilkins and Burton Pike, containing extensive selections from unpublished drafts, appeared in 1995.[25] Musil's work has received more attention since that time,[26] including the philosophical aspects of his novels. According to Milan Kundera, "No novelist is dearer to me."[27] One of the most important philosophy journals, _The Monist_ published a special issue on The Philosophy of Robert Musil in 2014, edited by Bence Nanay.[28]
