The ST. AMBROSE CATHEDRAL[1] () Also LINARES CATHEDRAL Is a cathedral church of Catholic worship, home of the Diocese of Linares[2] in the Maule Region in Chile.[3] It was built between 1935 and 1937.

After the founding of Linares, on May 23, 1794, the priest of Yerbas Buenas Pablo de la Barra transferred to this city the seat of his parish, which was built between 1796 and 1810, by Tiburcio Gúmera.3 The structure Would deteriorate after the 1906 earthquake in Valparaiso and the Talca earthquake of 1928, which led to its demolition. Funding was started for a temple, a task entrusted to the first bishop of the diocese Miguel León Prado, a task that after his death would be continued by Bishop Juan Subercaseaux Errázuriz. It would bring together the architects Carlos Bresciani and Jorge del Campo Rivera, in addition to his brother, Pedro Subercaseaux. The latter is awarded the identification of the building with the Basilica of St. Ambrose in Milan. It would be inaugurated in the year 1937.
