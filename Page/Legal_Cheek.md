LEGAL CHEEK is a British legal news website.[1] It also has a careers section featuring research about law firms and barrister chambers[2] and a large following on social media.[3]


History

Founded by former Guardian journalist Alex Aldridge[4] in 2011, Legal Cheek initially operated out of Aldridge's apartment in London.[5] Aldridge has a background in law after training as a barrister.[6]

In 2012 Legal Cheek was forced to issue an apology for using an incorrect photo in an article about a dispute between two barristers.[7] In an interview after this had taken place, Aldridge admitted there had been a "lawsuit" and pledged to think harder about "accountability".[8]

In 2014 Legal Cheek conducted the first ever interview[9] with Judge Rinder, the barrister who would go on to find fame on Strictly Come Dancing.

Legal Cheek is often cited in the UK media, including the BBC,[10] the Daily Mail [11] and The Independent [12] and The Telegraph [13] Recently Legal Cheek noted[14] that Amal Clooney, the celebrity human rights lawyer married to George Clooney, is eligible to become a judge in the UK Supreme Court, while recognising that this is in fact highly unlikely. Citing the Legal Cheek article, the London Evening Standard subsequently claimed that "Amal could reign supreme".[15]

As of 2016 Legal Cheek has two staff writers, Tom Connelly[16] and Katie King,[17] and various columnists including Joshua Rozenberg, the former BBC legal correspondent,[18] and Will Buckley, the former Observer journalist.[19]
