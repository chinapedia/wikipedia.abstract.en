VOZUĆA is a settlement in Zavidovići in Bosnia and Herzegovina,[1] located on the river of Krivaja. The settlement is known for the Battle for Vozuća of the Bosnian War, when the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina defeated the Army of Republika Srpska. Today, Vozuća represents a symbol of the post-war recovery of Bosnia.


History

In 1470, during the Ottoman rule, the settlement is first mentioned under the name "Kurtkasaba", meaning "wolf settlement" or "a place of wolves" in English. The local people changed it to "Vukovine" because the area's plentiful flora and fauna. In Vozuća are settled some places like HRGE, where in 1911 a spear and a bronze bracelet were found and are now in the collection of the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Southwest from Vozuća is Stog. Stog belongs to the local community of Vozuća. On one of the hills in Stog was placed the town of Maria Theresa known under the name _Grad_ or _Gradina_. When Maria Theresia, it is told, was escaping from that town, she was throwing a golden loom into a vortex in the river of Krivaja. That vortex is known as the _Deep vorte_x or _Balukana_ (Turkish balk - fish).

From 1890 to 1963, the railway connecting Zavidovići and Olovo went through the settlement then known as Vukovine. In 1892, the name of the settlement changed from Vukovine to Vozuća (Bosnian "voz" - train).


Geography

Vozuća is located between the _Kablovac_ hill from the right and _Žedni Vrh_ from the left side of the river of Krivaja, with a large amount of arable land. Most of the people living in Vozuća are Bosniaks.


Battle for Vozuća

The Battle for Vozuća was an attack on 10 September 1995 by the 3rd Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the foreign troops of the Bosnian mujahideen against the strategically important Army of Republika Srpska-held village of Vozuća, during the Bosnian War.[2][3]

The attack started and ended on 10 September, with the total victory of the Bosnian forces. Due to their planning, they were ahead of the Serb forces. The Army and the Mujahideen got help from a special paramilitary force called the Black Swans.[4] The aftermath of the battle is infamous for the brutal behavior of the Mujahideen forces against remaining soldiers and civilians. The Bosnian forces advanced through the Ozren area.[5]
