Plot

After the death of his father Laurie, 42-year-old Stephen is set to take over the family business, the John Barleycorn pub, in Stroud. His plans are interrupted when Andrew, a former foster child briefly raised by Stephen's parents, returns to his life eager to renew his relationship with the family. While Andrew quickly charms the rest of Stephen's family - including his mother Ellen, sister Cass and uncle Geoff - Stephen resents Andrew and views him as "a glib, dangerous sociopath who's about to steal his family, his business and his life".[5] Andrew fondly remembers the time he spent living with the family as happy, whereas Stephen remembers the same time as miserable.
