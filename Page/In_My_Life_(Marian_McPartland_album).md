_IN MY LIFE_ is a 1993 album by jazz pianist Marian McPartland.[1]


Reception

The album was positively reviewed by Scott Yanow at Allmusic who wrote that "Despite the diverse repertoire, McPartland's own flexible style shines through and her individual musical personality is felt in each song. ...McPartland's closing wistful solo piano version of "Singin' the Blues" (dedicated to her late husband, cornetist Jimmy McPartland) should not be missed".[2]
