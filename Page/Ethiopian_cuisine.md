Alicha_1.jpg'' and several kinds of _wat_ (stew) is typical of Ethiopian cuisine.]] LocationEthiopia.svg]]

ETHIOPIAN CUISINE () characteristically consists of vegetable and often very spicy meat dishes. This is usually in the form of _wat,_ a thick stew, served atop _injera_, a large sourdough flatbread,[1] which is about in diameter and made out of fermented teff flour.[2] Ethiopians eat most of the time with their right hands, using pieces of _injera_ to pick up bites of entrées and side dishes.[3].

The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church prescribes a number of fasting periods (_tsom_, _ṣōm_), excluding any kind of animal products, including dairy products and eggs), including Wednesdays, Fridays, and the entire Lenten season, so Ethiopian cuisine contains many dishes that are vegan.[4]


Overview

Kita_herb_bread.jpg A typical dish consists of injera accompanied by a spicy stew, which frequently includes beef, lamb, vegetables and various types of legumes, such as lentils. Gurage cuisine also makes use of the false banana plant (_enset_, Ge'ez: እንሰት _inset_), a type of ensete. The plant is pulverized and fermented to make a bread-like food called _qocho_ or _kocho_ (Ge'ez: ቆጮ _ḳōč̣ō_), which is eaten with kitfo.[5] The root of this plant may be powdered and prepared as a hot drink called _bulla_ (Ge'ez: ቡላ _būlā_), which is often given to those who are tired or ill. Another typical Gurage preparation is coffee with butter (_kebbeh_). _Kita_ herb bread is also baked.

Pasta is frequently available throughout Ethiopia, including rural areas.[6] Coffee is also a large part of Ethiopian culture and cuisine. After every meal, a coffee ceremony is enacted and coffee is served.


Restrictions of certain meats

Ethiopian Orthodox Christians, Jews and Muslims avoid eating pork or shellfish, for religious reasons. Pork is considered unclean in Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, Judaism and Islam. Many Ethiopians abstain from eating certain meats, and mostly eat vegetarian and vegan foods.


Traditional ingredients

BerbereOtherIngredients.JPG or radhuni, korarima, nigella and fenugreek (clockwise, from top) are used with chilis and salt to make _berbere_, a basic ingredient in many Ethiopian dishes.]] _Berbere_, a combination of powdered chili pepper and other spices (somewhat analogous to Southwestern American chili powder), is an important ingredient used in many dishes. Also essential is _niter kibbeh_, a clarified butter infused with ginger, garlic, and several spices.[7][8]

_Mitmita_ (, ) is a powdered seasoning mix used in Ethiopian cuisine. It is orange-red in color and contains ground birdseye chili peppers (piri piri), cardamom seed, cloves and salt.[9] It occasionally has other spices including cinnamon, cumin and ginger.

In their adherence to strict fasting, Ethiopian cooks have developed a rich array of cooking oil sources—besides sesame and safflower—for use as a substitute for animal fats which are forbidden during fasting periods. Ethiopian cuisine also uses _nug_ (also spelled _noog_, also known as "niger seed").[10]


Dishes

Wat

Ethiopian_food.jpg]] _Wat_ begins with a large amount of chopped red onion, which is simmered or sauteed in a pot. Once the onions have softened, _niter kebbeh_ (or, in the case of vegan dishes, vegetable oil) is added. Following this, _berbere_ is added to make a spicy _keiy wat_ or _keyyih tsebhi_. Turmeric is used instead of _berbere_ for a milder _alicha wat_ or both spices are omitted when making vegetable stews, such as atkilt wat. Meat such as beef (_ሥጋ_,[11] _səga_), chicken (_ዶሮ_,[12] _doro_ or _derho_), fish (_ዓሣ_,[13] _asa_), goat or lamb (_በግ_,[14] _beg_ or _beggi_) is also added. Legumes such as split peas (_ክክ_,[15] _kək_ or _kikki_) and lentils (_ምስር_,[16] _məsər_ or _birsin_); or vegetables such as potatoes (_ድንች_,[17] _Dənəch_), carrots and chard (ቆስጣ) are also used instead in vegan dishes.

Each variation is named by appending the main ingredient to the type of wat (e.g. _kek alicha wat_). However, the word _keiy_ is usually not necessary, as the spicy variety is assumed when it is omitted (e.g. _doro wat_). The term _atkilt wat_ is sometimes used to refer to all vegetable dishes, but a more specific name can also be used (as in _dinich'na caroht wat_, which translates to "potatoes and carrots stew"; but notice the word "atkilt" is usually omitted when using the more specific term).

Tibs

Meat along with vegetables are sautéed to make _tibs_ (also _tebs_, _t'ibs_, _tibbs_, etc., Ge'ez: ጥብስ _ṭibs_). Tibs is served in a variety of manners, and can range from hot to mild or contain little to no vegetables. There are many variations of the delicacy, depending on type, size or shape of the cuts of meat used.

The mid-18th century European visitor to Ethiopia describes _tibs_ as a portion of grilled meat served "to pay a particular compliment or show especial respect to someone."[18] It may still be seen this way; today the dish is prepared to commemorate special events and holidays.

Kinche (Qinch'e)

Kinche (Qinch’e) is a very common Ethiopian breakfast, its equivalent of oatmeal. It’s incredibly simple, inexpensive, and nutritious. It is made from cracked wheat, Ethiopian oats, barley or a mixture of those. It can be boiled in either milk or water. The flavor of the Kinche comes from the nit'ir qibe, which is a spiced butter.[19]

Gurage dishes

Kitfo

Kitfo.jpg served rare]] Another distinctively Ethiopian dish is _kitfo_ (frequently spelled _ketfo_). It consists of raw (or rare) beef mince marinated in _mitmita_ (Ge'ez: ሚጥሚጣ _mīṭmīṭā_ a very spicy chili powder similar to the _berbere_) and _niter kibbeh_. _Gored gored_ is very similar to _kitfo_, but uses cubed rather than ground beef.

Ayibe

_Ayibe_ is a cottage cheese that is mild and crumbly. It is much closer in texture to crumbled feta. Although not quite pressed, the whey has been drained and squeezed out. It is often served as a side dish to soften the effect of very spicy food. It has little to no distinct taste of its own. However, when served separately, ayibe is often mixed with a variety of mild or hot spices typical of Gurage cuisine.

Gomen kitfo

_Gomen kitfo_ is another typical Gurage dish. Collard greens (ጎመን _gōmen_) are boiled, dried and then finely chopped and served with butter, chili and spices. It is a dish specially prepared for the occasion of Meskel, a very popular holiday marking the discovery of the True Cross. It is served along with _ayibe_ or sometimes even _kitfo_ in this tradition called _dengesa_.

Breakfast

Kitcha_fit_fit.png, or chechebsa, made with kitcha (unleavened bread), niter kibbeh (seasoned clarified butter) and berbere (spice), is a typical breakfast food.]] _Fit-fit_ or _fir-fir_ is a common breakfast dish. It is made from shredded _injera_ or _kitcha_ stir-fried with spices or wat. Another popular breakfast food is _fatira_. The delicacy consists of a large fried pancake made with flour, often with a layer of egg. It is eaten with honey. _Chechebsa_ (or _kita firfir_) resembles a pancake covered with _berbere_ and _niter kibbeh_, or other spices, and may be eaten with a spoon. _Genfo_ is a kind of porridge, which is another common breakfast dish. It is usually served in a large bowl with a dug-out made in the middle of the genfo and filled with spiced _niter kibbeh_. A variation of _ful_, a fava bean stew with condiments, served with baked rolls instead of _injera_, is also common for breakfast.


Snacks

Typical Ethiopian snacks are Dabo Kolo (small pieces of baked bread that are similar to pretzels) or _kolo_ (roasted barley sometimes mixed with other local grains). _Kolo_ made from roasted and spiced barley, safflower kernels, chickpeas and/or peanuts are often sold by kiosks and street vendors, wrapped in a paper cone. Snacking on popcorn is also common.[20]


Gursha

A _gursha_ (var. _gorsha_, _goorsha_) is an act of friendship and love. When eating injera, a person uses his or her right hand to strip off a piece, wraps it around some _wat_ or _kitfo_, and then puts it into his or her mouth. During a meal with friends or family, it is a common custom to feed others in the group with one's hand by putting the rolled injera or a spoon full of other dishes into another's mouth.[21] This is called a _gursha_, and the larger the gursha, the stronger the friendship or bond (only surpassed by the brewing of Tej together). This tradition was featured in "The Food Wife," an episode of _The Simpsons_ that uses Ethiopian cuisine as a plot point.[22]


Beverages

Traditional alcoholic beverages

There are many different traditional alcoholic drinks which are home made and of natural ingredients.

Tella

Tella is a home-brewed beer served in _tella bet_ ("tella houses") which specialize in serving only tella. Tella is the most common beverage made and served in households during holidays.

It is an alcoholic drink which is prepared from bikil (barley) as main ingredient and gesho (_Rhamnus prinoides_) for fermentation purpose.

Tej (honey wine)

Tej is a potent honey wine.[23] It is similar to mead, and is frequently served in bars, particularly in a _tej bet_ or "tej house".

It is prepared from honey and gesho. It has a sweet taste and the alcoholic content is relatively higher than tella. This drink can be stored for a long time; the longer it is stored, the higher the alcohol content, and the stronger the taste.

Areki (katikala)

Areki, also known as katikala, is probably the strongest alcoholic drink of Ethiopia.[24]

Non-alcoholic beverages

Ethiopians have diverse traditional non-alcoholic drinks which include natural and healthy ingredients.

Kenetto (keribo)

Kenetto, also known as keribo, is a non-alcoholic traditional drink. It is mostly used as substitute for tella for those who don't drink alcohol.[25]

Borde

Borde is famous in the southern Ethiopia regions.[26]

Manufactured drinks

Just like the rest of the world Ethiopians also enjoy several locally manufactured beers,wine and non alcoholic products like Coca Cola and other similar products.Ethiopian_Coca_Cola_bottle.JPG bottle in Ethiopia, with the distinct logo in the Ethiopic script]] Ambo Mineral Water or _Ambo wuha_ is a bottled carbonated mineral water, sourced from the springs in Ambo Senkele near the town of Ambo.[27][28]

Non-alcoholic brews (hot drinks)

Atmet

_Atmet_ is a barley and oat-flour based drink that is cooked with water, sugar and _kibe_ (Ethiopian clarified butter) until the ingredients have combined to create a consistency slightly thicker than egg-nog. Though this drink is often given to women who are nursing, the sweetness and smooth texture make it a comfort drink for anyone who enjoys its flavor.

Coffee

Ethcofcerm.jpg]] According to some sources, drinking of coffee (_buna_) is likely to have originated in Ethiopia.[29] A key national beverage, it is an important part of local commerce.[30]

The coffee ceremony is the traditional serving of coffee, usually after a big meal. It often involves the use of a _jebena_ (ጀበና), a clay coffee pot in which the coffee is boiled. The preparer roasts the coffee beans in front of guests, then walks around wafting the smoke throughout the room so participants may sample the scent of coffee. Then the preparer grinds the coffee beans in a traditional tool called a _mokecha_. The coffee is put into the jebena, boiled with water, and then served in small cups called _si'ni_. Coffee is usually served with sugar, but is also served with salt in many parts of Ethiopia. In some parts of the country, _niter kibbeh_ is added instead of sugar or salt.

Snacks, such as popcorn or toasted barley (or _kolo_), are often served with the coffee. In most homes, a dedicated coffee area is surrounded by fresh grass, with special furniture for the coffee maker. A complete ceremony has three rounds of coffee (abol, tona and bereka) and is accompanied by the burning of frankincense.

Tea (chai)

Tea will most likely be served if coffee is declined.
