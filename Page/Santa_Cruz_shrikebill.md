The SANTA CRUZ SHRIKEBILL (_Clytorhynchus sanctaecrucis_), or NENDO SHRIKEBILL, is a songbird species in the family Monarchidae. The Santa Cruz shrikebill was split from the black-throated shrikebill in 2008 but some authorities still consider it to be its subspecies, _C. n. sanctaecrucis_.[1]

The Santa Cruz shrikebill is little-known species that has been very rarely sighted. It is endemic to the Solomon Islands. It is found on Nendo in the Santa Cruz Islands. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It is threatened by habitat loss.
