The TEMPLE OF ORIGINAL ANCESTOR (, ) was built either in 1804 or during the third year of Gia Long's rule to commemorate the duke Nguyễn Kim who was the ancestor of Nguyễn dynasty.[1] __TOC__


History

Temple of Original Ancestor is located to the north of the Ancestral Temple. Its design was inspired by Ming's architecture, most notably with a rectangular perimeter that represents the script _king_ (王), three main doors facing southward. The interior of the temple consists of an altar, on which two plaques of the Original Ancestor and his lady are placed.[2]

A poem can be found inscribed on the ceiling, with its content presumably praising the following merit of the Original Ancestor, that :

    開國承家，_Khai quốc thừa gia,_
    守成繼體。_Thủ thành kế thể._
    報本崇原，_Báo bản sùng nguyên,_
    洽斯百禮。_Hiệp tư bách lễ._

The temple was badly damaged during the 1968 Tet Offensive. Since then, the temple had been abandoned until 2014 when it underwent a 27-month period of restoration funded with 700,000$ by the United States Department of State.[3]

However, this "newly restored" temple was panned by the press for being too flashy and unaesthetic, given the original intent of how Huế's art works should look during the Golden Age.[4] The mosaics on the roof are rendered rough and do not seem to describe a classical legend of Confucius.
