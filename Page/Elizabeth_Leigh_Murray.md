ELIZABETH LEIGH MURRAY (née _Elizabeth Harriet Lee_, 1815–1892) was an English actor of the Victorian period.


Biography

Elizabeth Leigh Murray, born in 1815, was the daughter of Henry Lee (1765–1836), an actor, playwright and theatre manager, and his second wife Miss Lloyd.[1] As might be expected for a theatrical family of that period, Elizabeth was placed on stage early in life, appearing in _Little Pickle_ when five-years old, and taking roles in many of her father's productions.[2]

She married in 1841 Henry Leigh Murray, an actor.[3]

The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography lists a number of her adult appearance, including:[4]

-   Cupid, in an extravaganza, _Cupid_, at the Olympic Theatre, produced by Lucia Elizabeth Vestris
-   _Love's Labour's Lost_, circa 1839, at Covent Garden Theatre
-   Lady Staunton in _The Whistler of the Glen, or, The Fate of the Lily of St Leonards_, Edinburgh, billed as Miss E. Lee
-   Apollo in _Diogenes and his Lantern_ at the Strand Theatre, February 1850
-   Lady Lavender in _The Love Knot_ at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, March 1858
-   Patty in _The Chimney Corner_, Olympic Theatre, February 1861
-   Lady Lundie in _Man and Wife_, based on the Wilkie Collins novel, _Man and Wife_, Prince of Wales's Theatre, February 1873

Besides these, she appeared in productions across England and Scotland, including joint performances with her husband. She died on 25 May 1892.[5]
