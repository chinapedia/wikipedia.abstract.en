"CAN'T GET BY WITHOUT YOU" was a hit for The Real Thing in 1976. It was the follow up to their smash hit "You to Me Are Everything".


Background

The song was written by Ken Gold and Mickey Denne. It was released on Pye 7N 45618. The B side, "(He's Just A) Moneymaker" was written by Chris and Eddie Amoo.[1] The song had a similar feel to their previous hit. Even though the song shot to no 2 in the UK charts it didn't make any real chart impression in the US.[2] On the week ending 16 October 1976, in the UK charts the song had dropped down a notch from no 2 to no 3.[3]

In 1986, a remixed version of the song "Can't Get By Without You (The Second Decade Remix)" by "She's A Groovy Freak" was released on the PRT label.[4]
