As Maryland embarked on its first season in the Big Ten Conference in 2015, this was also the year Onyekwere picked up her first piece of collegiate hardware.

She added a Top 10 conference finish at this meet by placing 7th in the Discus throw.

Onyekwere capped off her final Big Ten Indoor Track & Field Championship in 2016 by placing 2nd and earning a Silver Medal in the Weight Throw. Her top mark of 21.17 meters (69’ 5.5”) was not only a personal best, but it also broke a school record that had previously stood for 14 years. She placed 6th for the Shotput at this meet as well. Along with earning 2nd Team All-Big Ten honors for the second straight year record-breaking throw, that mark also qualified her for the 2016 NCAA Division I Indoor Track & Field National Championships.
