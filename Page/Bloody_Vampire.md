_BLOODY VAMPIRE_ is a 2012 action-adventure platform game for the Nintendo 3DS created by Japanese studio Silver Star.


Plot

The player character is Latis, a dhampir who enters a castle, which has mysteriously appeared in the human world, to defeat its vampire overlord.


Gameplay

_Bloody Vampire_ is a side-scrolling action-adventure game in which the player controls Latis as she finds her way through a vast, maze-like castle. She fights enemies in similar fashion to _Hydlide_ or _Ys_, bumping into enemies with her body and either inflicting or taking damage depending on her strength and position. She will collect coins by defeating enemies that can then be used to buy equipment from shops. In order to progress deeper into the castle, she will need to acquire certain special items that grant her new abilities and allow her to traverse obstacles.


Reception

_Bloody Vampire_ received mixed reviews, currently sitting at 65/100 on Metacritic.[1] _Nintendo Life_ scored it 7/10, saying, "Bloody Vampire is a bit rough around the edges, and it's far from original, but it combines its sleeve-borne influences into a stylised package that's a lot of fun"; however, it expressed reservation over the "designated save spots and the absence of a map".[2] _Pocket Gamer_ scored the game 6/10, concluding that "_Bloody Vampire_ has the potential to be great, but it's far too sketchy to properly enjoy", criticizing the lack of feedback in the combat system, the lack of a map, and the "under-developed" inventory system.[3]
