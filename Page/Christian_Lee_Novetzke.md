Honors and recognition

Reception for _Amar Akbar Anthony: Bollywood, Brotherhood, and the Nation_

In 2016, Novetzke, along with co-authors William Elison and Andy Rotman, published a book on the 1977 Bollywood film _Amar Akbar Anthony_.[8] Though published by the scholarly Harvard University Press, the book, entitled _Amar Akbar Anthony: Bollywood, Brotherhood, and the Nation_, attracted the attention of the mainstream Indian press, with the authors giving interviews about the book for the _Hindu_,[9] _Mid Day,_[10] and _Daily News and Analysis_.[11]

In his review of the book in the _Hindu_, Jai Arjun Singh notes, "Here's a scholarly work about a popular film that also tries to mimic something of the film's controlled lunacy, winking at itself every now and again."[12]

Frontline's C.S. Venkiteswaran calls the work "an eminently readable book that will delight any cineaste for its sheer passion for cinema and for the delightful theoretical dexterity with which it weaves a complex and rich web of information and analysis."[13]
