The 1937 IDAHO VANDALS FOOTBALL TEAM represented the University of Idaho in the 1937 college football season. The Vandals were led by third-year head coach Ted Bank,[1] and were members of the Pacific Coast Conference. Home games were played on campus in Moscow at the new Neale Stadium, with one in Boise at Public School Field.[2][3]


Season

Led on the field by passing halfback Hal Roise, Idaho compiled a 4–3–1 overall record and were in the PCC. The recently completed Neale Stadium hosted an upset homecoming win over favored Oregon State,[4][5][6][7] the first of four straight wins to open the venue.

In the Battle of the Palouse with neighbor Washington State, the Vandals suffered a tenth straight loss, falling in the rain in Pullman on October 2.[8][9][10] Idaho's most recent win in the series was a dozen years earlier in 1925 and the next was seventeen years away, in 1954.

The Vandals finished the season with a pair of 6–0 shutout victories over Gonzaga in Spokane,[11][12][13] and Montana in Moscow.[14] It was the only loss of the year for the Grizzlies and their only conference game scheduled.[15] The team recorded four shutouts and yielded only 53 points in eight games, but tallied only 35 and went scoreless three times.

The winning season was the first for Idaho football in a decade and it was followed up with a better record in 1938. Future coaches among the Vandal players included Tony Knap, Lyle Smith, and Steve Belko.


Schedule
