ARMS ALOFT is an American punk group from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, formed in 2007. As described by frontman Seth Gile, the band's lyrics frequently focus on left politics and how they affect people personally.[1] Their music accordingly has covered explicitly political topics such as pollution, global warming, Wall Street corruption, and drone strikes, as well as time-honored topics such as breakups and boredom.[2][3]

After releasing their first demo, a string of split EPs, and adding Jack Gribble to the lineup after former drummer Zach Holder moved out of the area, Arms Aloft released their first album, _Sawdust City_.[4] The album title was a reference to a nickname for their home town, Eau Claire — as explained by frontman Seth Gile, the "desolate" name reflected the band's "weird pride in our pessimism" and love of their Eau Claire that's reflected in their lyrics.[5] The album was released to positive reviews, receiving 4.5/5 stars from Punknews.org, who called it "the best punk record I've heard all year".[6]

Their follow-up album, released 4 years later, was similarly enthusiastically reviewed, receiving 4/5 stars from Punknews.org and 4.5/5 stars from Dying Scene.[7][8]
