"FORTISSIMO" is a 1966 song brought to success by Rita Pavone. The music was composed by Bruno Canfora, while the lyrics were written by director and screenwriter Lina Wertmüller, at the time a close collaborator of Pavone, after having directed her in the television miniseries _Il giornalino di Gian Burrasca_ and in the musicarello film _Rita the Mosquito_.[1] The arrangements of the song are by Luis Bacalov.[2]

"Fortissimo" was chosen as the opening song of the popular RAI variety show _Studio Uno_, whose 1966 edition Pavone presented, alternating with Mina, Ornella Vanoni and Sandra Milo.[3]

The song was later covered by several artists, including Mina,[4] Iva Zanicchi,[5] Robert Goulet,[6] Betty Madigan,[7] Laura Bono,[8] Nathalie.[9]
