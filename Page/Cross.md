'', a cross whose limbs are slanted]] A CROSS is a geometrical figure consisting of two intersecting lines or bars, usually perpendicular to each other. The lines usually run vertically and horizontally. A cross of oblique lines, in the shape of the Latin letter X, is also termed a saltire in heraldic terminology.


Name

The word _cross_ is recorded in 10th-century Old English as _cros_, exclusively for the instrument of Christ's crucifixion, replacing the native Old English word _rood_. The word's history is complicated; it appears to have entered English from Old Irish, possibly via Old Norse, ultimately from the Latin _crux_ (or its accusative _crucem_ and its genitive _crucis_), "stake, cross". The English verb _to cross_ arises from the noun c. 1200, first in the sense "to make the sign of the cross"; the generic meaning "to intersect" develops in the 15th century. The Latin word was, however, influenced by popular etymology by a native Germanic word reconstructed as _*krukjo_ (English _crook_, Old English _crycce_, Old Norse _krokr_, Old High German _krucka_). This word, by conflation with Latin _crux_, gave rise to Old French _crocier_ (modern French _crosse_), the term for a shepherd's crook, adopted in English as crosier.

Latin _crux_ referred to the gibbet where criminals were executed, a stake or pole, with or without transom, on which the condemned were impaled or hanged, but more particularly a cross or the pole of a carriage.[1] From this word was derived the Latin verb _crucio_ "to put to death on the cross" or (more frequently) "to put to the rack, to torture, torment" especially in reference to mental troubles.[2] The field of etymology is of no help in any effort to trace a supposed original meaning of _crux_.[3] A _crux_ can be of various shapes: from a single beam used for impaling or suspending (_crux simplex_) to the various composite kinds of cross (_crux compacta_) made from more beams than one. The latter shapes include not only the traditional ‚Ä†-shaped cross (the _crux immissa_), but also the T-shaped cross (the _crux commissa_ or Tau Cross), which the Early Christian descriptions of the execution cross indicate as the normal form in use at that time, and the X-shaped cross (the _crux decussata_ or saltire).

The Greek equivalent of Latin _crux_ "stake, gibbet" is œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅœåœÇ _stauros_, found in texts of four centuries or more before the gospels and always in the plural number to indicate a stake or pole. From the first century BC it is used to indicate an instrument used in executions. The Greek word is used in Early Christian descriptions of the execution cross, which indicate that its normal shape was similar to the Greek letter tau (Œ§).[4][5][6][7]


History

Pre-Christian

" (Urnfield culture, 2nd millennium BC).]] Due to the simplicity of the design (two intersecting lines), cross-shaped incisions make their appearance from deep prehistory; as petroglyphs in European cult caves, dating back to the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, and throughout prehistory to the Iron Age. Also of prehistoric age are numerous variants of the simple cross mark, including the _crux gammata_ with curving or angular lines, and the Egyptian _crux ansata_ with a loop.

Speculation has associated the cross symbol ‚Äì even in the prehistoric period ‚Äì with astronomical or cosmological symbology involving "four elements" (Chevalier, 1997) or the cardinal points, or the unity of a vertical axis mundi or celestial pole with the horizontal world (Koch, 1955). Speculation of this kind became especially popular in the mid- to late-19th century in the context of comparative mythology seeking to tie Christian mythology to ancient cosmological myths. Influential works in this vein included G. de Mortillet (1866),[8] L. M√ºller (1865),[9] W. W. Blake (1888),[10] Ansault (1891),[11] etc.

In the European Bronze Age the cross symbol appeared to carry a religious meaning, perhaps as a symbol of consecration, especially pertaining to burial.[12]

The cross sign occurs trivially in tally marks, and develops into a number symbol independently in the Roman numerals ( "ten"), the Chinese rod numerals (ÂçÅ "ten") and the Brahmi numerals ("four", whence the numeral 4).

In the Phoenician alphabet and derived scripts, the cross symbol represented the phoneme /t/, i.e. the letter taw, which is the historical predecessor of Latin T. The letter name _taw_ means "mark", presumably continuing the Egyptian hieroglyph "two crossed sticks" (Gardiner Z9).[13]

According to W. E. Vine's _Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words_, worshippers of Tammuz in Chaldea and thereabouts used the cross as symbol of that god.[14][15]

Christian cross

on a solidus minted by Leontios (r. 695‚Äì698); on the obverse, a stepped cross in the shape of a Iota Eta monogram.]] The shape of the cross (_crux_, _stauros_ "stake, gibbet"), as represented by the letter T, came to be used as a "seal" or symbol of Early Christianity by the 2nd century.[16] Clement of Alexandria in the early 3rd century calls it ("the Lord's sign") he repeats the idea, current as early as the Epistle of Barnabas, that the number 318 (in Greek numerals, Œ§ŒôŒó) in Genesis 14:14 was a foreshadowing (a "type") of the cross (the letter Tau) and of Jesus (the letters Iota Eta).[17] Clement's contemporary Tertullian rejects the accusation that Christians are _crucis religiosi_ (i.e. "adorers of the gibbet"), and returns the accusation by likening the worship of pagan idols to the worship of poles or stakes.[18] In his book _De Corona_, written in 204, Tertullian tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the cross.[19]

While early Christians used the T-shape to represent the cross in writing and gesture, the use of the Greek cross and Latin cross, i.e. crosses with intersecting beams, appears in Christian art towards the end of Late Antiquity. An early example of the cruciform halo, used to identify Christ in paintings, is found in the _Miracles of the Loaves and Fishes_ mosaic of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna (6th century). The Patriarchal cross, a Latin cross with an additional horizontal bar, first appears in the 10th century. A wide variation of cross symbols is introduced for the purposes of heraldry beginning in the age of the Crusades.[20]


Cross-like marks and graphemes

The cross mark is used to mark a position, or as a check mark, but also to mark deletion. Derived from Greek Chi are the Latin letter X, Cyrillic Kha and possibly runic Gyfu.

Egyptian hieroglyphs involving cross shapes include _ankh_ "life", _ndj_ "protect" and _nfr_ "good; pleasant, beautiful".

Sumerian cuneiform had a simple cross-shaped character, consisting of a horizontal and a vertical wedge (íà¶), read as _ma≈°_ "tax, yield, interest"; the superposition of two diagonal wedges results in a decussate cross (íâΩ), read as _pap_ "first, pre-eminent" (the superposition of these two types of crosses results in the eight-pointed star used as the sign for "sky" or "deity" (íÄ≠), DINGIR). The cuneiform script has other, more complex, cruciform characters, consisting of an arrangement of boxes or the fourfold arrangement of other characters, including the archaic cuneiform characters LAK-210, LAK-276, LAK-278, LAK-617 and the classical sign EZEN (íÇ°).[21]

Phoenician _tƒÅw_ is still cross-shaped in Paleo-Hebrew alphabet and in some Old Italic scripts (Raetic and Lepontic), and its descendant T becomes again cross-shaped in the Latin minuscule t. The plus sign (+) is derived from Latin t via a simplification of a ligature for _et_ "and" (introduced by Johannes Widmann in the late 15th century).

The letter Aleph is cross-shaped in Aramaic and paleo-Hebrew.

Egyptian hieroglyphs with cross-shapes include Gardiner Z9 ‚Äì Z11 ("crossed sticks", "crossed planks").

Other, unrelated cross-shaped letters include Brahmi _ka_ (predecessor of the Devanagari letter ‡§ï) and Old Turkic (Orkhon) _d¬≤_ and Old Hungarian _b_, and Katakana „Éä _na_ and „É°_me_.

The multiplication sign (√ó), often attributed to William Oughtred (who first used it in an appendix to the 1618 edition of John Napier's _Descriptio_) apparently had been in occasional use since the mid 16th century.[22]

Other typographical symbols resembling crosses include the dagger or _obelus_ (‚Ä†), the Chinese (ÂçÅ, Kangxi radical 24) and Roman () ten.

Unicode has a variety of cross symbols in the "Dingbat" block (U+2700‚ÄìU+27BF) :

    ‚úï ‚úñ ‚úó ‚úò ‚úô ‚úö ‚úõ ‚úú ‚úù ‚úû ‚úü ‚ú† ‚ú¢ ‚ú£ ‚ú§ ‚ú•

The Miscellaneous Symbols block (U+2626 to U+262F) adds three specific Christian cross variants, viz. the Patriarchal cross (‚ò¶), Cross of Lorraine (‚ò®) and "Cross of Jerusalem" (implemented as Cross potent, ‚ò©).

            | SKULL AND CROSSBONES   Traditionally used to mark Spanish cemeteries; the symbol evolved to represent death/danger, poison, and pirates.


Physical gestures

Cross shapes are made by a variety of physical gestures. Crossing the fingers of one hand is a common invocation of the symbol. The sign of the cross associated with Christian genuflection is made with one hand: in Eastern Orthodox tradition the sequence is head-heart-right shoulder-left shoulder, while in Oriental Orthodox, Catholic and Anglican tradition the sequence is head-heart-left-right.

Crossing the index fingers of both hands represents and a charm against evil in European folklore. Other gestures involving more than one hand include the "cross my heart" movement associated with making a promise and the Tau shape of the referee's "time out" hand signal.

In Chinese-speaking cultures, crossed index fingers represent the number 10.

[12] "In the bronze age we meet in different parts of Europe a more accurate representation of the cross, as conceived in Christian art, and in this shape it was soon widely diffused. This more precise characterization coincides with a corresponding general change in customs and beliefs. The cross is now met with, in various forms, on many objects: fibulas, cinctures, earthenware fragments, and on the bottom of drinking vessels. De Mortillet is of opinion that such use of the sign was not merely ornamental, but rather a symbol of consecration, especially in the case of objects pertaining to burial. In the proto-Etruscan cemetery of Golasecca every tomb has a vase with a cross engraved on it. True crosses of more or less artistic design have been found in Tiryns, at Mycen√¶, in Crete, and on a fibula from Vulci." O.

[16] "The cross as a Christian symbol or 'seal' came into use at least as early as the second century (see "Apost. Const." iii. 17; Epistle of Barnabas, xi.-xii.; Justin, "Apologia," i. 55-60; "Dial. cum Tryph." 85-97); and the marking of a cross upon the forehead and the chest was regarded as a talisman against the powers of demons (Tertullian, "De Corona," iii.; Cyprian, "Testimonies," xi. 21-22; Lactantius, "Divin√¶ Institutiones," iv. 27, and elsewhere). Accordingly the Christian Fathers had to defend themselves, as early as the second century, against the charge of being worshipers of the cross, as may be learned from Tertullian, "Apologia," xii., xvii., and Minucius Felix, "Octavius," xxix. Christians used to swear by the power of the cross. CROSS:, Jewish Encyclopaedia.

[18] _Apology_., chapter xvi. "Then, if any of you think we render superstitious adoration to the cross, in that adoration he is sharer with us. If you offer homage to a piece of wood at all, it matters little what it is like when the substance is the same: it is of no consequence the form, if you have the very body of the god. And yet how far does the Athenian Pallas differ from the stock of the cross, or the Pharian Ceres as she is put up uncarved to sale, a mere rough stake and piece of shapeless wood? Every stake fixed in an upright position is a portion of the cross; we render our adoration, if you will have it so, to a god entire and complete. We have shown before that your deities are derived from shapes modelled from the cross." _Sed et qui crucis nos religiosos putat, consecraneus noster erit. Cum lignum aliquod propitiatur, viderit habitus, dum materiae qualitas eadem sit; viderit forma, dum id ipsum dei corpus sit. Et tamen quanto distinguitur a crucis stipite Pallas Attica, et Ceres Pharia, quae sine effigie rudi palo et informi ligno prostat? Pars crucis est omne robur, quod erecta statione defigitur; nos, si forte, integrum et totum deum colimus. Diximus originem deorum vestrorum a plastis de cruce induci._
