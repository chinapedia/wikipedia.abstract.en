_SHOCK HORROR!_ is the first album by new wave band Katrina and the Waves, released in 1983 by Aftermath Records.

The album was originally credited to The Waves and released only in the UK, later reissued on CD by US label CGB in 2010.[1] The album was recorded by the band that became Katrina and the Waves, but prior to Katrina Leskanich's becoming the band's sole lead vocalist. _Shock Horror!_ is notable for including the first recording of "Going Down to Liverpool," which was later recorded by the band with Katrina on lead vocals, and covered by the Bangles. "Brown Eyed Son" was also re-recorded by the band for a future album.
