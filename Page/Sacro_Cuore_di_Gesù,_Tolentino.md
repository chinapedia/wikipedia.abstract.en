The CHURCH OF SACRO CUORE DI GESÙ (Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus) is a Roman Catholic church located in the town limits of Tolentino, province of Macerata, in the region of Marche, Italy.


History

Formerly a monastic church known as San Benedetto da Norcia (Benedict of Nursia), the structure was consigned to the confraternity of the Sacro Cuore di Gesù in 1835; they enlarged and restored the church under the designs of the architect Luigi Fontana. The church was finally reconsecrated in 1880. The church was restored and reopened to cult in 2006.

The cult of the Holy Heart of Jesus was founded in the 18th century, inspired by the visions of St Maria Margherita Alacoque. In 1729, a confraternity was founded in Rome, aimed at works of piety. Domenico Spinucci (1777-1796), bishop of Tolentino, was intent on creating an altar for the veneration of the Sacro Cuore in every church of his diocese. In 1805, a confraternity, also known as the _dei Sacconi_, dedicated to this devotion was established in Tolentino. They instituted a ritual procession every Holy Friday, starting in the church of San Vito, similar to those held by medieval flagellants, dressed in sackcloth with hoods for anonymity. The confraternity was suppressed during 1808-1815.[1]

The façade is made of brick with late-Baroque decoration. The interiors were frescoed by Fontana, who also painted the main altarpiece depicting _The Apparition of the Holy Heart to Santa Maria Alacoque_. In the right wall is a large canvas depicting _Madonna between Saints Nicola and Benedetto_ (18th century) and on the left wall a canvas depicting _Santa Giacinta Marescalchi_ by Gerolamo Capoferri.[2]
