BROOKING TOWNSHIP is an inactive township in Jackson County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.[1]

Brooking Township was established in 1872, taking its name from Alvin Brooking, a state legislator.[2]

The township includes Raytown and environs, including a northwestern portion of Unity Village. An atlas showing the townships of Jackson County in 1930 (when today's Unity Village corresponded largely with Knobtown village) is on page 2 at:
