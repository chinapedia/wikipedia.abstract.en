JEAN-PHILIPPE MATETA (born 28 June 1997) is a French footballer who currently plays as a striker for Bundesliga side Mainz 05.[1]


Club career

Lyon

He made his debut for the Ligue 1 side on 21 September 2016 against Montpellier replacing Maxwel Cornet after 76 minutes a 5–1 home win.[2] He played his next match four months later against Montpellier in the Coupe de France coming on for Maxwel Cornet in the 76th minute of a 5–0 home win (almost identically to his first game with the club).[3] He made his first Ligue 1 start match against AS Monaco on 23 April 2017. He played 65 minutes, before being replaced by Mathieu Valbuena in a 2–1 home loss.[4]

Mainz

On 29 June 2018, it was announced that Mateta had joined Bundesliga club FSV Mainz on a four year deal.[5] His arrival was the most expensive signing in club history.[6] Upon signing with the club, the player was compared favorably to former Mainz strikers Aristide Bance and Adam Szalai as well as former Koln and Hoffenheim star Anthony Modeste.[7]

On 5 April 2019, Mateta scored his first senior hat-trick in a 5–0 league victory over SC Freiburg.[8]
