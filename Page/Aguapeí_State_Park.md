History

The Aguapeí State Park was created as compensation when the Companhia Energética de São Paulo (CESP) built the Primavera Hydroelectric Power Plant on the Paraná River. The dam would flood of the Lagoa São Paulo Reserve and of the Great Pontal Reserve. The park was created by state decree 43.269 on 2 July 1998 with an area of . The purpose is to fully protect fauna, flora and natural beauty, while allowing the park to be used for educational, recreational and scientific purposes.

Decree 44.730 of 28 February 2000 defined necessary public areas in the park. Fishing regulations were published on 2 October 2008, covering conservation areas and their buffer zones in the Paraná River basin. They were the Morro do Diabo State Park, Rio do Peixe State Park, Rio Aguapeí State Park, Mico Leão Preto Ecological Station, Ivinhema State Park, Ilha Grande National Park, Caiuá Ecological Station and Iguaçu National Park.

The perimeter of the park has been fenced, and the land has been acquired and donated to the state of São Paulo. The administrative headquarters and visitor center were opened in December 2015.
