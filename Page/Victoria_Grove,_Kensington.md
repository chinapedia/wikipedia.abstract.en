VICTORIA GROVE is a street in Kensington, London W8. House building began in 1837 and was completed in 1841.[1]

The land locally was bought by John Inderwick (1785â€“1867) in 1836, "variously described as optician or ivory turner, and latterly as an importer of meerschaum pipes and snuff boxes", who became a successful speculative developer, and the architect was probably Joel Bray.[2]

It runs from Launceston Place in the north west to Gloucester Road in the south east. 6-13, 18, 19-26, and 27-28 are all Grade II listed houses.[3][4][5][6]

The street is mentioned in _Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats_ by T. S. Eliot as the home of Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer.[7]
