FERM AND PDZ DOMAIN CONTAINING 4 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the FRMPD4 gene. [1]


Function

This gene encodes a multi-domain (WW, PDZ, FERM) containing protein. Through its interaction with other proteins (such as PSD-95), it functions as a positive regulator of dendritic spine morphogenesis and density, and is required for the maintenance of excitatory synaptic transmission.
