Plot

The film starts with the video photographer Diwakar (Murali) coming late to video-shoot a marriage, where he falls in love with Bhuvaneshwari (Gautami) at first sight. He then gets a hold of Bhuvaneshwari's maternal uncle Anjaneya (R. Sundarrajan) and gets information about Bhuvaneshwari. He gathers that she respects only the people who are self-employed and straightforward. He also finds out that she is unmarried and she is about to get transferred to his village soon. Back to his village, Diwakar has the plan to open a video shop with his friend Mani (Senthil). In order to secure the capital, he uses all kinds of tricks to rip off the villagers. Diwakar blackmails Bhagyam (Sharmili) to reveal her extramarital affair to her husband. He then gets money from Kiruba (Goundamani), a married man who is in love with Bhagyam and promises him to join them. He even claims money from chit fund which he never was a member of. After getting enough money, he opens his video shop. He starts to sell electronic products found on the street and advertises them as new products imported from Dubai.

Anjaneya writes him letters in Bhuvaneshwari's name making Diwakar assume that she is in love with him. Afterwards, Bhuvaneshwari, her mother (Vadivukkarasi) and her bachelor uncle Anjaneya land in Diwakar's village, Diwakar arranges them a house. He comes to know that Bhuvaneshwari doesn't love him and he had been cheated by Anjaneya all along. Bhuvaneshwari puts forward a deal that she would marry Diwakar only if he stays out of cheating, and does not utter a lie in a month. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.
