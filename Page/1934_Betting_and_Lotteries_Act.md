The BETTING AND LOTTERIES ACT, 1934 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and had three sections: Betting, Lotteries and Prize Competitions, and General.[1]

The draft bill was presented to parliament on 7 March[2] with the provisions passed on 27 March.[3]


Overview

Betting

Horse racing courses and greyhound tracks were forced to limit their race days to a maximum 104 per annum whereas previously they were able to race on an unlimited basis. On course bookmakers and totalisators were also restricted to betting on a maximum of 104 days per annum.

Power was given to local councils to issue (and revoke or refuse) the betting licences required and the 104 appointed days of trading must be published in advance. The racecourse and tracks were to charge on course bookmakers a specified admission price and it was illegal for under 18 to be involved in any betting organisation.

The issue of street bookmaking was not addressed which the press felt should have been. The restriction to 104 days was primarily brought in due to rapid growth of greyhound tracks after 1927 and the associated gambling implications that had followed.[4]

Lotteries and Prize Competitions

All lotteries were made unlawful with the exemption of small lotteries incidental to certain entertainment and private lotteries. Restrictions were made on certain prize competitions (i.e. in newspapers) and warrant rights were given to any constable to investigate premises that are suspected of breaking the restrictions.

This was primarily directed to combat the Irish Free State Hospitals' Sweepstake.[5][6]
