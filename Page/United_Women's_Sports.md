Play It Forward Foundation

In addition to the UWLX, Murphy and Kirby are co-founders of the Play It Forward Sports Foundation,[4] with the goal of advancing gender equity in sports at all levels of play. With the objective of providing more opportunities for women in sport as professional athletes, coaches and managers, the model for Play It Forward Sports also allows female athletes a chance to participate in the community by educating, training and mentoring young female athletes, providing them with earning potential. Among their initiatives included an initiative with Eyekonz.[5] Founded by Jazmine Smith, with the goal of introducing African-American girls to lacrosse, the initiative saw the UWLX run a free clinic for members of Philadelphia's Strawberry Mansion high school lacrosse team following a UWLX regular season game. Athlete ambassadors for Play It Forward include Molly Schaus, along with tennis players Neha Uberoi and Shikha Uberoi. In addition, Schaus is part of the Foundation's Board, which includes Valarie Gelb, Debbie Mckay and John Mayers.

Said program shall include working with players 12 and under, while another shall involve an Under-14 and Under-16 years of age program.
