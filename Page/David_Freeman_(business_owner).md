In April 2011, Freeman entered a joint venture with friend Raul Gonzales to open a 1950s-style basement bar, loosely modelled on chic New York City hotspots[3] with hopes to change the face of the Kings Cross – and greater Sydney – through his venture.

Sealed behind a mysterious Acme Bookstore façade on the Kings Cross strip The Backroom was a unique venue designed for a distinct clientele – only those who are aware of its existence. 1950s film noir influences the interior aesthetic with the brooding detective and the femme fatale noteworthy characters within the designed space. According to interior designer Kristie Paul of inochi design studio, David had a long list of quirky ideas.[4]

The Backroom was host to a series of international superstars, with names as big as Calvin Harris, Snoop Dogg and Justin Bieber[5] partying there and the likes of Brodinski and Rudimental stopping by for impromptu late night sets.

In September 2014, seven months after the NSW Government implemented their controversial lockout legislation, The Backroom Sydney, were forced to close its doors.[6]
