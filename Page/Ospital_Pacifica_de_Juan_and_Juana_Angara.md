The OSPITAL PACIFICA DE JUAN AND JUANA ANGARA is a hospital and trauma center to be built in Baler, Aurora, Philippines.

CAZA describes that the facility will offer "therapeutic presence of nature" to its patients. It will occupy a space of .[1] The architecture team behind the hospital comprises Carlos Arnaiz, Li Libo, Li Jingjun, Yuan Jin, and Kelvin Tseng.[2]

The hospital's architecture, space, and program was planned around a 9 x 9 meter (29.5 x 29.5 feet) grid which will accommodate a 3 x 3 meter (9.8 x 9.8 feet) room module. An integrated spine area situated in the central area of the facility was designed for efficient movement of staff and supplies between the general hospital and trauma center areas. A portico also forms part of the hospital perimeter. The hospital has four main zones, each with a courtyard garden for natural lighting.[3]

The main hospital building with two floors will be high while the separate chapel structure will stand .[4][5]

The design of the hospital as a prototype design will be prefabricated and is meant to be repeatable for similar hospitals yet to be built in other rural areas.[6]

The facility will feature various health services, including maternity wards, imaging, operating rooms, a chapel, and a caf√©.[7]

Construction of the healthcare facility is set to begin in December 2016 and is projected to be completed in March 2018.[8] Upon its completion it will be the first combined general hospital and trauma center in the Philippines.[9] The building's construction will be funded by Ed Corpus Jr. and Senator Edgardo Angara.[10]
