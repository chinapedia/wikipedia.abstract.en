AMMONIUS HERMIAE (; _Ammōnios ho Hermeiou_; ) was a Greek philosopher, and the son of the Neoplatonist philosophers Hermias and Aedesia. He was a pupil of Proclus in Athens, and taught at Alexandria for most of his life, writing commentaries on Plato, Aristotle, and other philosophers.


Life

Ammonius' father, Hermias, died when he was a child, and his mother, Aedesia, raised him and his brother, Heliodorus, in Alexandria. When they reached adulthood, Aedesia accompanied her sons to Athens where they studied under Proclus. Eventually, they returned to Alexandria, where Ammonius, as head of the Neoplatonist school in Alexandria, lectured on Plato and Aristotle for the rest of his life. According to Damascius, during the persecution of the pagans at Alexandria in the late 480s, Ammonius made concessions to the Christian authorities so that he could continue his lectures.[1] Damascius, who scolds Ammonius for the agreement that he made, does not say what the concessions were, but it may have involved limitations on the doctrines he could teach or promote. He was still teaching in 515; Olympiodorus heard him lecture on Plato's _Gorgias_ in that year.[2] He also taught Asclepius of Tralles, John Philoponus, Damascius and Simplicius.[3] He was also an accomplished astronomer; he lectured on Ptolemy and is known to have written a treatise on the astrolabe.


Writings

Ammonios_Hermeiou.jpg Of his reputedly numerous writings, only his commentary on Aristotle's _De Interpretatione_ survives intact. A commentary on Porphyry's _Isagoge_ may also be his, but it is somewhat corrupt and contains later interpolations.

In _De Interpretatione_, Ammonius contends that divine foreknowledge makes void the contingent. Like Boëthius in his second _Commentary_ and _The Consolation of Philosophy,_ this argument maintains the effectiveness of prayer. Ammonius cites Iamblichus who said "knowledge is intermediate between the knower and the known, since it is the activity of the knower concerning the known."[4]

In addition, there are some notes of Ammonius' lectures written by various students which also survive:

-   On Aristotle's _Categories_ (anonymous writer)
-   On Aristotle's _Prior Analytics I_ (anonymous writer)
-   On Aristotle's _Metaphysics 1–7_ (written by Asclepius)
-   On Nicomachus' _Introduction to Arithmetic_ (written by Asclepius)
-   On Aristotle's _Prior Analytics_ (written by John Philoponus)
-   On Aristotle's _Posterior Analytics_ (written by John Philoponus)
-   On Aristotle's _On Generation and Corruption_ (written by John Philoponus)
-   On Aristotle's _On the Soul_ (written by John Philoponus)

There is Greek-language work called _Life of Aristotle_, which is usually ascribed to Ammonius, but "is more probable that it is the work of Joannes Philoponus, the pupil of Ammonius, to whom it is ascribed in some MSS."[5]
