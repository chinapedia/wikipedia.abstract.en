PHILIP RADCLIFFE (27 April 1905 – 2 September 1986) was an English academic, musicologist and composer, born in Godalming, Surrey.


Early life

He was educated at Charterhouse and read Classics at King's College, Cambridge, gaining a scholarship and a First in Part I of the degree, but then only a Third in Part II, causing him to switch his attention to music,[1] studying under Edward Dent and Henry Moule[2]. He was a gifted pianist.


Career

Philip Radcliffe had his first sight of Cambridge in December 1923 when he sat for a scholarship examination. "I attended evensong in the Chapel of my future College and can still recall the impact made upon me by the quiet, other-world sound of the choir singing _Remember, O thou man_."[3] His dissertation continued the work of Richard Terry and Edmund Fellowes on sixteenth and seventeenth century music.[4] Radcliffe became a music fellow at King's College, Cambridge in 1931, and a lecturer between 1947 and 1972. His pupils included Philip Brett, Winton Dean, Jeremy Dibble,[5] Peter Dickinson, Sebastian Forbes and Richard Lloyd. He lived in King's for the rest of his life, never leaving it for more than a few weeks.[6]

His academic writings included the books _Mendelssohn_ (1954), _Beethoven's String Quartet_ (1965), _Schubert Piano Sonatas_ (BBC Music Guide, 1967), a biography of John Ireland (1954), and sections of Grove's Dictionary, Denis Stevens's symposium _The History of Song_, and the _New Oxford History of Music_. In 1933, at the request of T S Eliot, Radcliffe took over the Music Chronicle section of _The Criterion_ from J B Trend.[7]

His compositions include short choral pieces (such as the eight part setting of _God be In My Head_,[8] _Mary walked through a wood of thorn,_[9] and _The Oxen_)[10] liturgical music (_The Preces and Responses_[11] and _Versicles and Responses_),[12] songs, and a small number of instrumental works (including the String Quartet in D major, 1939).[13] His incidental music for classical Greek plays included _Clouds_[14] (Aristophanes, 1962) _Oedipus Tyrannus_[15] (1965), _Medea_[16] (Euripides, 1974), and _Electra_[17] (Sophocles, 1977). Radcliffe was an active member of the Ten Club playreading society.whose other well-known members included EM Forster, Donald Beves and Noel Annan.

He died in a car accident while travelling with his sister in France at the age of 81, while still an active Fellow of the College.
