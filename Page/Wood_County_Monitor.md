The _WOOD COUNTY MONITOR_ is a weekly newspaper serving Wood County, Texas.

In August 2016, two of Wood County's two longstanding newspaper operations, the _Mineola Monitor_ and the _Wood County Democrat_, were merged by their owner, Bluebonnet Publishing. Prior to that, the _Mineola Monitor_ operated under its own masthead in Mineola, and the _Wood County Democrat_ operated under its own masthead in Quitman. Staffing at the newspapers did not change, and the staffs of both newspapers were merged.
