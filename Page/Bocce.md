(,[1][2] also ,[3] ), sometimes anglicized as BOCCI[4][5][6] or BOCCIE,[7][8] is a ball sport belonging to the boules family, closely related to British bowls and French , with a common ancestry from ancient games played in the Roman Empire. Developed into its present form in Italy, it is played around Europe and also in other areas with Italian migrants, including Australia, North America, and South America. Initially played only by the Italian migrants, the game has slowly become more popular with their descendants and the wider community.


History

Bocce is closely related to British bowls and French __, all having developed from games played in the Roman Empire. It was developed into its present form in Italy[9] (where it is called __, the plural of the Italian word __ which means 'bowl' in the sport sense),[10] it is played around Europe and also in regions to which Italians have migrated, such as Australia, North America, and South America (where it is known as __, or __ ('Criollo balls') in Venezuela, __ in Brazil). The popularity of the game spread first amongst descendants of Italian migrants but has slowly spread into the wider community.


Geographical spread

The sport is also very popular on the eastern side of the Adriatic, especially in Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the sport is known in Serbo-Croatian as __ ('playing __') or __ (colloquially also __).[11][12][13] In Slovenia the sport is known as __[14] or colloquially 'playing __', or __ (from Italian __ and Venetian __, meaning 'balls').[15]


Rules and play

Bocce is traditionally played on natural soil and asphalt courts in length and wide.[16] Bocce balls can be made of metal[17] or various kinds of plastic. Unlike lawn bowls, bocce balls are spherical and have no inbuilt bias. A game can be conducted between two players, or two teams of two, three, or four. A match is started by a randomly chosen side being given the opportunity to throw a smaller ball, the JACK (called a __ ('little bocce') or __ ('bullet' or 'little ball') in Italian, depending on local custom), from one end of the court into a zone in length, ending from the far end of the court. If the first team misses twice, the other team is awarded the opportunity to place the jack anywhere they choose within the prescribed zone.[18]

The side that first attempted to place the jack is given the opportunity to bowl first. Once the first bowl has taken place, the other side has the opportunity to bowl. From then on, the side which does _not_ have the ball closest to the jack has a chance to bowl, up until one side or the other has used their four balls. At that point, the other side bowls its remaining balls. The team with the closest ball to the jack is the only team that can score points in any frame. The scoring team receives one point for each of their balls that is closer to the jack than the closest ball of the other team. The length of a game varies by region but is typically from 7 to 13 points.[19][20]

Players are permitted to throw the ball in the air using an underarm action. This is generally used to knock either the jack or another ball away to attain a more favorable position. Tactics can get quite complex when players have sufficient control over the ball to throw or roll it accurately.[21]


Variants

Bocce volo

A variation called __ uses a metal ball, which is thrown overhand (palm down), after a run-up to the throwing line. In that latter respect, it is similar to the French boules game __ also known as __. A French variant of the game is called __, and (lacking the run-up) is more similar in some respects to traditional __.[22]

Boccia

Another development, for persons with disabilities, is called __. It is a shorter-range game, played with leather balls on an indoor, smooth surface. Boccia was first introduced to the Paralympics at the 1984 New York/Stoke Mandeville Games, and is one of the only two Paralympic sports that do not have an Olympic counterpart (the other being goalball).[23]
