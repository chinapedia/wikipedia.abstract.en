ALEXEY LEONIDOVICH PAJITNOV (born 14 March 1956) is a Russian video game designer and computer engineer who developed _Tetris_ while working for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, a Soviet government-founded R&D center.

He only started to get royalties from his creation in 1996 when he and Henk Rogers formed The Tetris Company.[1]


Biography

Pajitnov was born on 14 March 1956 in Moscow, in the Soviet Union. He studied applied mathematics at the Moscow Aviation Institute.[2][3] He then went on to work on speech recognition at the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre where he would develop Tetris.

As a child, he was a fan of puzzles and played with pentomino toys.[4] In creating _Tetris_, he drew inspiration from these toys.[5] Pajitnov created _Tetris_ with the help of Dmitry Pavlovsky and Vadim Gerasimov in 1984. The game, first available in the Soviet Union, appeared in the West in 1986.

Pajitnov also created a sequel to _Tetris_, entitled _Welltris_, which has the same principle but in a three-dimensional environment where the player sees the playing area from above.[6] _Tetris_ was licensed and managed by Soviet company ELORG, which had a monopoly on the import and export of computer hardware and software in the Soviet Union, and advertised with the slogan _"From Russia with Love"_ (on NES: _"From Russia with Fun!"_). Because he was employed by the Soviet government, Pajitnov did not receive royalties.

Pajitnov, together with Vladimir Pokhilko, moved to the United States in 1991 and later, in 1996, founded The Tetris Company with Henk Rogers. He helped design the puzzles in the Super NES versions of _Yoshi's Cookie_ and designed the game _Pandora's Box_, which incorporates more traditional jigsaw-style puzzles.

He was employed by Microsoft from October 1996 until 2005. While there he worked on the _Microsoft Entertainment Pack: The Puzzle Collection_, MSN Mind Aerobics and MSN Games groups. Pajitnov's new, enhanced version of _Hexic_, _Hexic HD_, was included with every new Xbox 360 Premium package.

On 18 August 2005, WildSnake Software announced that Pajitnov would be collaborating with them to release a new line of puzzle games.[7]


Personal life

Pajitnov's son, Dmitri, died in a skiing accident on Mount Rainier in 2017.[8][9]
