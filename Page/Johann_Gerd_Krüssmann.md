JOHANN GERD KRÜSSMANN (1910–1980) was a German dendrologist and author.[1]

Krüssmann worked as dendrologist from 1935, and from 1946 was the owner of a nursery and part-time horticulture teacher at the Horticultural Vocational School in Wesel and the county vocational school in Dinslaken.[2] The Ellerhoop-Thiensen Arboretum was established in 1956 by Erich Frahm, its owner, in cooperation with Krüssman.
