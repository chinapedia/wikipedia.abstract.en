Prevailing_world_religions_map.png A SECT is a subgroup of a religious, political, or philosophical belief system, usually an offshoot of a larger group. Although the term was originally a classification for religious separated groups, it can now refer to any organization that breaks away from a larger one to follow a different set of rules and principles.

In an Indian context, sect refers to an organized tradition.[1]


Etymology

Catalogue_of_Sects.GIF The word _sect_ comes from the Latin noun _secta_ (a feminine form of a variant past participle of the verb _sequi_, to follow[2]), meaning "a way, road", and figuratively a (prescribed) way, mode, or manner, and hence metonymously, a discipline or school of thought as defined by a set of methods and doctrines. The present gamut of meanings of _sect_ has been influenced by confusion with the homonymous (but etymologically unrelated) Latin word _secta_ (the feminine form of the past participle of the verb _secare_, to cut).[3]


Sociological definitions and descriptions

There are several different sociological definitions and descriptions for the term.[4] Among the first to define them were Max Weber and Ernst Troeltsch (1912).[5] In the church-sect typology they are described as newly formed religious groups that form to protest elements of their parent religion (generally a denomination). Their motivation tends to be situated in accusations of apostasy or heresy in the parent denomination; they are often decrying liberal trends in denominational development and advocating a return to true religion. The American sociologists Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge assert that "sects claim to be authentic purged, refurbished version of the faith from which they split".[6] They further assert that sects have, in contrast to churches, a high degree of tension with the surrounding society.[7] Other sociologists of religion such as Fred Kniss have asserted that sectarianism is best described with regard to what a sect is in tension with. Some religious groups exist in tension only with co-religious groups of different ethnicities, or exist in tension with the whole of society rather than the church which the sect originated from.[8]

Sectarianism is sometimes defined in the sociology of religion as a worldview that emphasizes the unique legitimacy of believers' creed and practices and that heightens tension with the larger society by engaging in boundary-maintaining practices.[9]

The English sociologist Roy Wallis[10] argues that a sect is characterized by "epistemological authoritarianism": sects possess some authoritative locus for the legitimate attribution of heresy. According to Wallis, "sects lay a claim to possess unique and privileged access to the truth or salvation" and "their committed adherents typically regard all those outside the confines of the collectivity as 'in error'". He contrasts this with a cult that he described as characterized by "epistemological individualism" by which he means that "the cult has no clear locus of final authority beyond the individual member."[11][12]


In other languages

The corresponding words for "sect" in European languages other than English – _Sekte_ (German), _secte_ (French), _secta_ (Spanish, Catalan), _sectă_ (Romanian), _seita_ (Portuguese, Galician), _sekta_ (Polish, Czech, Slovak, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, Slovenian, Latvian, Lithuanian), _sekt_ (Danish, Estonian, Norwegian, Swedish), _sekte_ (Dutch), _szekta_ (Hungarian), _секта_ (Russian, Serbian, Bulgarian), σέχτα (Greek) – refer to a harmful religious sect and translate into English as "cult". In France, since the 1970s, _secte_ has a specific meaning which is very different from the English word.[13]


In Buddhism

-   Schools:
    -   Theravada, primarily in South Asia and Southeast Asia;
    -   Mahāyāna, primarily in East Asia;
    -   Vajrayāna, primarily in Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, India, Mongolia and the Russian republic of Kalmykia.

-   Nikāyas, or monastic fraternities, three of which survive at the present day:
    -   Theravāda, in Southeast Asia and South Asia;
    -   Dharmaguptaka, in China, Korea and Vietnam;
    -   Mūlasarvāstivāda, in the Tibetan tradition;


In Christianity

While the historical usage of the term "sect" in Christendom has had pejorative connotations, referring to a group or movement with heretical beliefs or practices that deviate from those of groups considered orthodox,[14][15] its primary meaning is to indicate a community which has separated itself in some way from the larger body from which its members came and to which they may or may not still adhere. The term remains valid for this purpose.

Roman Catholic sects

There are many groups outside the Roman Catholic Church which regard themselves as Catholic, such as the Community of the Lady of All Nations, the Palmarian Catholic Church, the Philippine Independent Church, the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church, the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, Most Holy Family Monastery, and others.

In Hinduism

In Islam

The ancient schools of fiqh or sharia in Islam are known as "madhhabs." In the beginning Islam was classically divided into three major sects. These political divisions are well known as Sunni Islam, Shia Islam and Khariji Islam. Each sect developed several distinct jurisprudence systems reflecting their own understanding of the Islamic law during the course of the history of Islam.

For instance, Sunnis are separated into five sub-sects, namely, Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali and Ẓāhirī.

The Shia, on the other hand, first developed Kaysanism, which in turn divided into three major groupings known as Fivers, Seveners and Twelvers. The Zaydis separated first. The non-Zaydis are initially called as "Rafida Groups." These Rafidis were later divided into two sub-groups known as Imamiyyah and Batiniyyah.[18]

-   The "Imami-Shi'a" later brought into existence Ja'fari jurisprudence. Akhbarism, Usulism, and Shaykhism were all ensued as variations of "Ja'fari fiqh," while Alawites and Alevis who are not the strict followers of "Ja'farism" are developed separately from the teachings of _Ithna'ashari Imāms._Ghardaia02.jpg valley in Sahara is home of the Ibadi religious sect]]
-   Batiniyya groups, on the other hand, were divided into two sub-groups known as Seveners and Ismā'īlīs. Qarmatians who did not follow the Fatimid Caliphate were branched from the Seveners. Those groups of Batiniyya who followed the Fatimids are the ancestors of today's Ismā'īlīs. Druze was emerged as an offshoot of Ismāʿīlism at the beginning of the 11th Century. Isma'ilism at the end of the 11th Century split into two major branches known as Nizārī Ismā'īlī _(Assassins of Alamut)_ and Musta’li Ismaili. As a result of the assassination of Fatimid Caliph Al-Amir bi-Ahkami'l-Lah, Mustaali was once more again divided into Hafizis and Taiyabi Ismailis _(Dawoodis, Sulaymanis and Alavis)_
-   The Khawarij were initially divided into five major branches: Sufris, Azariqa, Najdat, Adjarites and Ibadis.

The Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali Sunnis, the Twelver groups, the Ismā'īlī groups, the Zaydis, the Ibadis, and the Ẓāhirīs continue to exist. In addition, new sects like Ahmadiyya movement, Black Muslim movements, Quranists, Salafis, Wahhabis, and Zikris have been emerged independently.

Amman Message

An Islamic convention held in Jordan in July 2005, which brought 200 Muslim scholars from over 50 countries together, announced the official recognition of eight schools of Islamic jurisprudence[19] and the varying schools of Islamic theology.[20] The eight recognized Islamic schools and branches are:

1.  Sunni Hanafi
2.  Sunni Maliki
3.  Sunni Shafi'i
4.  Sunni Hanbali
5.  Shi'i Imāmī _(followers of the Ja'fari jurisprudence)_
6.  Shi'i Zaydi
7.  Khariji Ibadi
8.  Sunni Ẓāhirī

"In English, it is a term that designates a religiously separated group, but in its historical usage in Christendom it carried a distinctly pejorative connotation. A sect was a movement committed to heretical beliefs and often to ritual acts and practices like isolation that departed from orthodox religious procedures."
