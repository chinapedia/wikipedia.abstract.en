Genesis Club (1936–1937)

Développement_du_sport_pour_Union_Sportive_Musulmane_Algéroise.jpg The discussion soon began despite some reluctance: "I wished a round table would be present all former living. The risks of failure are reduced. " A suggestion very relevant, but for time we had to content ourselves with our initiative. Mr. Kemmat admit that the idea of creating a club came like that. She had begun to sprout during the month of May 1937. "There was a neighborhood team, the sports club of the street that Sallust had enjoyed. We thought this was LAHMAR SAID ALI ZAID, ZEMMOUR ALI, ALI SLIMANI, BENNOUR SAID, MEDDAD AREZKI, SID ALI TERKMANE and I, a group of friends district who lived hard times of colonization. We often discussed, of all things in life .. And then by little we arrived at the sport. The example of Muslims clubs of the time we inflamed. A burning desire to do something we earned every time the subject was discussed. All these clubs had inspired us, including the MSO Oran created it in 1928 in terms of the name I knew all the workings of such an operation. My frequent contact with MOULOUD DJAZOULI very active leader of the MC Alger had taught me a lot. I began immediately to work. We had to prepare the statutes and the case to be filed with the prefecture services. No sooner said than done, the file is saved under the number – wait if I remember correctly – 1687. The only thing that "shocked" the colonial administration was the word Muslim. He was very unpopular. They discussed, we argued on both sides and the approval was granted. On 5 July 1937 the club was created. USMA was born. His office was in the street Divan. Its first board of course includes the first named above which will add ABDELKADER AMRANI, HEMMAZ OMAR, OMAR LAKEHAL, BASTA MOHAMED OUALI ZENNAGUI MOHAMED and ALI CHERIFI. The first president was _Meddad Arezki_, the owner of the café.


Before the war (1938–1954)

The first championship

stade_marcel_cerdan.jpg L'Union sportive musulmane algéroise red and black was thus born and was ready to participate in 1938 in the third division championship. At that time many players have expressed the wish to come to this club, unfortunately the regulations (license B) forbade them. Moreover, all clubs must have committed a stage for the competition. A criterion for which the federation then showed himself intransigent. This is what made MR. KEMMAT to both problems: "The time of the federation demanded a contract with a stadium with a minimum term of five years. This is to ensure the conduct of competitions. I contacted the leaders of the O. Pescade (now Rais Hamidou) and we had heard by paying annually to the club five thousand francs. For the money, needless to say where it came from, "he adds with a sigh that says something about the state of mind that prevailed in those days. More interested than ever we questioned on this issue and particularly on this story license (B). Smirk, EL HADJ AMMI tells us "We had knowingly affiliated to the Sports Gymnastics Federation of Labour _(FSGT)_ the first season. So, when we went to the football federation specifically, there was no obstacle. Everyone who wanted to opt for USMA could. There was no impediment. It began, then, in the third division and finished in third place. It was not bad for a start. As for the money, it just came quests, donations and revenues parties that we organized. Other clubs friends graciously lent the equipment and put the land to us for training. Such were the resources of the USMA of the time. We must also tell you that in that time, the player paying his dues, his equipment and even its shift ... ". Political struggle, the "native" sport was to survive and sacrifices of all kinds will be counted more.

The transition from the 3rd to the 1st Division

Anka.jpg The Grand Master of Andalusian classical music and Algerian chaâbi music, he was one of the biggest fans of the club, which gave the proceeds of several concerts for USM Alger.]] Then comes the World War, the second, more cruel than ever. The official competition is stopped. A symbolic replaces the championship. Two groups are created. USMA is Gallia with the RU Algiers, the other group includes the MC Alger AS Saint Eugène among others. This lasts three seasons. Mr. Kemmat passes his hand over his hair, pulling a drag on his umpteenth cigarette and adds: "It was a way to let us know and the results are not made to wait. Abderrahman Ibrir old center-half became ASTA goalkeeper at home and even had its first selection of Algiers under our colors. Subsequently, other footballers, seduced by the club, followed him. There was ZITOUNI HASSEN, ZOUAOUI RABAH, MAHMOUDI SMAIN – bright as lightning winger although he was limping leg – all MCA. NACERI M'HAMED and HOUARI GS Orleans city (now Chlef) BERKANI _Olympique de Tizi Ouzou_ and many others ... ". USMA is a club known despite the limited resources it has. In the 1939-40 season the team played for the first time in the first division and because of the outbreak of the World War II the championship was divided into three groups where the team signed in the group A the team was bad where they won only two games against the same team US ALGER and he was defeated in 9 games where he could not face the big teams then like RU Alger and AS Saint Eugène in the end, finished second to last either in COUPE DE LA LIGUE and COUPE DE LA SOLIDARITÉ the journey ended in the first round against US BLIDA and STADE ALGÉROIS respectively. The resumption of official competitions occur in 1942. For the 1942–43 season, USMA returns to Third Division according to regulations. MR. KEMMAT intervenes: "The regulations stipulate the. Think well, do a favor for a Muslim club was unimaginable. However after this season, USMA access to the second division with MUSTAPHA EL-KAMAL coach. Nay, it was more than that, an educator, a father to everyone. The mentality that was instilled serve us well after his departure. A great man indeed. His image is still alive, where it happened. " USMA accessed later in 1951 in the first division with KRIMOS the brothers AZZOUZ, CHABLI, BENHAIK ... It is also the eve of the period of major departures Hammam Lif. O Bologhine, we come to you equipped with drums and flags, chanted this refrain ... by usmistes supporters who personifies the place of their meeting place to share the joys and sorrows but also the glories and victories of their club cherished, like a temple, gathering his followers, this space has become legendary for fans of USMA. Its border location between the towns of Bologhine (Ex Saint Eugene) and Bab El Oued, gives it the advantage to dominate a beautiful bay dominated by the promontory of Z'ghara district and the Basilica of Our Lady of Africa . This town which was very popular for its beauty, from the Ottoman period, and where were localized deys summer residences and some diplomatic representations, such as consulates of France, Belgium, England and the United States, passed to the rank common in colonial times and as of September 14, 1870 where she was baptized under the name of St. Eugene in honor of Eugene account Guyot, civilian director of Algiers from 1839 to 1844 and also gave its name City Guyotville (now Ain Benian).

After several months of administrative procedures and affiliations of the clubs to the various regional bodies governing football in Algeria, football competitions come to life in the country.
