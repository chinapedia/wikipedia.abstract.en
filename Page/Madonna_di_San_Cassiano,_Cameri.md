The MADONNA DI SAN CASSIANO, also known as LA MADÃ’NA DI FRAJ is a Roman Catholic church located on Via Galileo Galilei in the town limits of Cameri, province of Novara, Piedmont, Italy.


History

A church at the site is documented since 1012. It was rebuilt in the present Baroque layout in 1673. A single nave opens to lateral chapels.

The interior contains single fresco dating prior to the 12th century: a _Virgin in Pink with the Christ Child_, located behind the main altar. The main altar was built in 1671 with black marble. The main altarpiece is an 18th-century painting depicting _San Cassiano has a vision of the Madonna and Child_. The nave ceiling is frescoed with an _Annuciation_ and an _Assumption of the Virgin_. One of the chapels houses a depiction of _Calvary with Christ_ reached by a Scala Santa ascended on your knees.

Adjacent to the church is a convent, now housing priests of the Passionists Order. In front of the church is a column surmounted with a _Madonna and Child_ installed in 1757.[1]
