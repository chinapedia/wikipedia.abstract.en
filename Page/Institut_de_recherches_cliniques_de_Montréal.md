History

The institute was established in 1967 by Dr. Jacques Genest who had earlier in 1952 established the first clinical research department at Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal hospital and had become the head of the Faculty of Medecine at McGill University in 1964.

With lawyer Marcel Piché, Genest founded _Centre médical Claude-Bernard_ in 1965, renamed _Institut de diagnostic et de recherches cliniques de Montréal_ and further changed to _Institut de recherches cliniques de Montréal_ its present name in 1986. Keeping its links with Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal, the Institute signed in December 1964 a contract of affiliation with the hospital for 25 years, stipulating that clinicians-researchers of the institute would be members in the medical staff of Hôtel-Dieu, ensuring they would have access to the hospital's patients and conducting laboratory tests for the hospital.

The construction of the main headquarters for the institute started in January 1966 inaugurated in presence of Quebec Health Minister Eric Kierans and in 1967, IRCM became affiliated to Université de Montréal, providing additional courses and later recruitment to some of the university's graduates.

In 1976, Centre de bioéthique was founded by Dr. David J. Roy. In 1992, a new wing was inaugurated (named bloc Basset) and in 2003, a further expansion and renovation project was launched. On 24 March 2006, the new 26,500 meter square premises and laboratories were inaugurated in the presence of Raymond Bachand, Quebec Minister of Economic Development, Innovation and Export.
