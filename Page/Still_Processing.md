_STILL PROCESSING_ is a _New York Times_ culture podcast hosted by Jenna Wortham, who works for the New York Times Magazine, and Wesley Morris, the paper's critic at large.[1] The show debuted on September 8, 2016. _Still Processin_g won a 2017 Webby Award in the Podcast & Digital Audio category, and was nominated for a 2019 Shorty Award. [2][3]


History

Morris joined _The New York Times_ from _The Boston Globe_ in 2015 with a podcast as part of his new contract and approached Wortham about serving as co-host.[4] Developed under the working title _Feelings_,[5] the show launched as _Still Processing_ on September 8, 2016,[6] part of a collaboration between _The New York Times_ and Pineapple Street Media to expand _Times_ podcasts offerings.[7]

The first season ran from September 26, 2016, to March 2, 2017.


Production

Morris and Wortham host the podcast. The production team includes Pineapple Street's Jenna Weiss-Berman, Neena Pathak, Sasha Weiss, Wendy Dorr, and members of the _Times_ audio department, Lisa Tobin and Samantha Henig.[8][9][10]


Format

The format typically includes discussion between Morris and Wortham as well as one or more interviews, sometimes in studio but often in outside locations: the first episode ("First Date") followed Wortham and Morris on a walk through Central Park. They have also visited the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC), interviewing curator Joanne Hyppolite,[11] and Columbia University to speak with Margo Jefferson, among other places. Laura Jane Standley and Eric McQuade of _The Atlantic_ described the show as "at base, a set of discussions about the big cultural events of the day. But _Still Processing_ is sharp and intellectual, goofy and raw: The two hosts talk to each other and to guests (including RuPaul and Margo Jefferson) about anyone from Colin Kaepernick to Kerry James Marshall; about society and art; about dating and work."[12]

Episodes are usually between half an hour and an hour in length, and released weekly on Thursdays.[13]


Reception

Reviewing the podcast's launch, Tim Barnes at _The A.V. Club_ said the "inaugural episode of _The New York Times_’ _Still Processing_ podcast is an incredible mix of personality, pop culture, and education. Writers Jenna Wortham and Wesley Morris bring a jolt of energy to the show, which feels like old media finally embracing the new."[14] Of the first episode, Taylor Bryant said at _Nylon_ that Wortham and Morris's "natural banter and strong viewpoints will leave you wanting so, so much more."[15]

_The Atlantic_ named _Still Processing_ among the 50 best podcasts of 2016, citing the November 10, 2016 post-election episode "The Reckoning" as a "banner episode".[16] _The Huffington Post_ likewise cited the post-election episode in naming _Still Processing_ to its list of 15 notable podcasts of 2016.[17] _IndieWire_ named the "Journey to the 'Blacksonian'" episode, on Wortham and Morris's trip to the NMAAHC, to its list of 2016 50 best podcast episodes.[18]
