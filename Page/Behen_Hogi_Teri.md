Critical reception

Rajeev Masand of News18 gave the film two stars out of five; he praised Rao's performance but criticised the weak screenplay: "Where the film slips up is in its writing. The plot, which starts off on a curious note becomes especially convoluted in its second hour".[8] Sweta Kausal of Hindustan Times gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 and said that, "Behen Hogi Teri suffers from a poorly conceived plot that fails to offer the fun expected of a story of its kind. The only enjoyable parts of the movie are the dialogues and the acting of Rajkummar."[9] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV found the writing of the film and Shruti Haasan's acting performance to be extremely weak and concluded his review by saying that, "Watch Behen Hogi Teri only if you think a one-man show is good enough to offset the drudgery of a two-hour trudge through a maze of inanities." Saibal gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5.[10]

Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5 and said that, "The only element worth looking at in this film, apart from the dependable Kamat, is the rock-solid Rao. If he was given a better co-star than the strictly one-note Haasan, this might have turned out to be a better film."[11] Nihit Bhave of The Times of India gave the film a rating of 2.5 out of 5 and said that, "The plot is juvenile to say the least" and "the only reason to smile at the movie is Rajkummar Rao".[12] Namrata Joshi of The Hindu said that, "The possibility of an interesting film gets lost in an overcooked script shorn of any remarkable situations and humour."[13] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave the film a rating of 2.5. out of 5 and said that, "While the premise of Behen Hogi Teri holds promise, the film is written with very little imagination. It plays out in a terribly familiar fashion. Its like youâ€™ve watched this film's formula 10000 times before."[14]
