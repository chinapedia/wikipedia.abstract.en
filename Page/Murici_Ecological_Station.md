The MURICI ECOLOGICAL STATION () is an ecological station in the state of Alagoas, Brazil. It preserves a rugged area of Atlantic Forest that is important as a home for several species of rare or endangered birds.


Location

The Murici Ecological Station (ESEC) is divided between the municipalities of Flexeiras (38.01%), Messias (0.86%) and Murici (61.2%) in Alagoas. It has an area of . The ESEC is in the northwestern region of Alagoas, in an area that has been degraded by sugarcane plantations and cattle ranching. The ESEC is used only by researchers and for environmental education. Most of the station is in the Borborema Plateau, but parts of the east of the ESEC are in the coastal sedimentary tablelands. Elevations range from .


History

The Murici Environmental Protection Area was created by state law 5,907 of 14 March 1997 to provide a buffer zone for the ESEC. The Murici Ecological Station was created by federal decree on 28 May 2001. The consultative council was created on 21 November 2002. It is classed as IUCN protected area category Ia (strict nature reserve). The purpose is to preserve nature and undertake scientific research. The area is considered a priority for the preservation of birds. The ESEC is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio).

As of 2006 land ownership had still not been regularized. Since some undisturbed land lay outside the ESEC, and some land within the ESEC was disturbed, adjustments to the boundaries could be warranted.


Environment

The rainy season is from April to August, with the highest rainfall in May and July. Annual rainfall ranges from . The ESEC has many springs, gullies and streams that feed the Munda√∫ River. The water supply for the Fleixeiras municipality comes from the ESEC. Temperatures range from , with an average of .

The dominant vegetation is dense rainforest in the Atlantic Forest biome. In the best preserved areas, mostly at the higher elevations, the forest forms a fairly uniform closed canopy up to high that provides shade and retains moisture. Tree species include murici (_Byrsonima sericea_), _Schefflera morototoni_, _Parkia pendula_, _Tabebuia_ species, _Pseudobombax_ species, _Bowdichia virgilioides_, _Tapirira guianensis_, _Handroanthus impetiginosus_ and _Protium_ species.

The understory contains seedlings of trees, palms such as _Euterpe catinga_, and many lianas and epiphytes, such as _Araceae_, _Orchidaceae_ (_dimerandra_ species, _Dichaea_ species, _Rodriguezia_ species, _Cattleya labiata_, _Pleurothallis_ species, _Epidendrum_ species, _Oncidium_ species and _Cattleya granulosa_), _Bromeliaceae_ (_Cryptanthus_ species, _Aechmea fulgens_, _Tillandsia_ species) and _Marantaceae_. Plants with medicinal uses include _Ficus_, _Lecythis_ and _Aspidosperma_ species, and _Abarema cochliocarpos_. This last, widely used as a medicinal plant, is threatened with extinction in the Atlantic Forest.

There is high diversity of animal species. The ESEC has 13 species of endangered birds, two of which are endemic, the Alagoas foliage-gleaner (_Philydor novaesi_) and the Alagoas antwren (_Myrmotherula snowi_). Other species are orange-bellied antwren (_Terenura sicki_), Alagoas tyrannulet (_Phylloscartes ceciliae_) and the snake _Bothrops muriciensis_.


Threats

The unit suffers from subsistence hunting by local residents and sports hunting by people from other locations. The most hunted species are paca, agouti and armadillo. Hunters have built wooden hides in the trees throughout the ESEC. Capture of birds for pets is also a constant problem. There is a risk of removal of trees for their lumber or to make charcoal, facilitated by the nearby BR-101 highway. The areas of permanent preservation are not respected by the local population, but are cleared for subsistence farming, sugarcane and pasture. Part of the problem is the lack of compensation to former owners for the land incorporated in the ESEC.
