THE HUNNA are an English rock band from Hertfordshire in England formed in 2015. The band members are singer/guitarist Ryan (Tino) Potter, lead guitarist Daniel (Dan, BD) Dorney, bassist Junate (Prince) Angin, and drummer Jack (IK) Metcalfe.[1] The band takes inspiration from a wide range of sources, including bands like Kings Of Leon, Foals, The 1975, You Me at Six and Queen.[2]


History

Formation and early beginnings

Members Dan and Ryan met while attending the same college. Dan and Junate had known each other for several years and learned to play guitar together. Eventually, they met Jack and the four later formed the band together. According to the band, the name comes from using the slang term "‘hunna’ in everyday language with each other... We put 'the' in front and landed on 'The Hunna'. The name is also what we are really all about, we give 100% in our music and in our daily lives."[3] They also cite a major hip-hop influence for the band name.[4] They released their first single "Bonfire" in October 2015.[5]

2016-present

In the beginning of 2016, they released their second single "We Could Be."[6] The Hunna performed at Reading[7] and Leeds[8] Festival and Dot-to-Dot Festival[9] and performed on the BBC Introducing Stage[10] in Summer 2016. In August 2016, The Hunna released their sixteen-track debut album 100, produced by Tim Larcombe and Duncan Mills.[11] The album debuted at #3 on the UK Indie Chart,[12] and #13 on the Official UK Album Chart.[13] In the United States, it peaked at #36 on the Heat Seekers chart.[14] The album's lead single, "You and Me" made it to U.S alternative radio including Sirius XM Alt Nation, Music Choice and peaked at number 28 on the U.S. Alternative Songs.[15][16] The Hunna toured with Jimmy Eat World in the fall of 2016.[17][18][19] They headlined Alt Nation’s Advanced Placement tour in late 2016 with Night Riots and The Shelters.[20]

Following a headline '100' tour in January 2017, they headlined the Festival Republic stage at Reading & Leads festival in 2017, where they first announced they were in the process of writing their second album 'Dare'.

The Hunna were on the line-up for Community Festival in Finsbury Park, London on 1 July 2017.

After their success on the festival stage during 2017, they announced a 2nd '100' tour, but this time playing in UK, Europe, Australia and USA with Night Riots and Coasts supporting. This included two nights at Brixton Academy in London on 12 and 13 January 2018, the latter of which sold out, prompting them to extend these dates to a full UK Headline tour in January. They also played at All Points East festival in Victoria Park, London in June 2018.

Their new album 'Dare' was released on 13 July. In the week of release, they played intimate shows in and around the country where they played the album in full. The venues included KOKO in London and The Plug in Sheffield.

Another tour was announced straight off the back of this, including their biggest ever headline show which took place at Alexandra Palace on 21 November 2018. 11 more UK dates are scheduled for January/February 2019.
