_DOWN UNDER_ is an Australian black comedy drama film set in the aftermath of the 2005 Cronulla riots. It follows the story of two carloads of vengeful, testosterone-charged young hotheads from both sides of the fight, who are destined to collide.[1] It is written and directed by Abe Forsythe [2]


Plot synopsis

Southern Cross-tattooed Jason (Damon Herriman) is rounding up the troops in the Shire. He recruits Shit-Stick (Alexander England), who works in a DVD store, who has been very unsuccessfully teaching out-of-town cousin Evan (Chris Bunton) to drive, and Ned Kelly obsessive Ditch (Justin Rosniak), whose head is swathed in bandages because of a new tattoo. Shit-Stick's dad, Graham (Marshall Napier), gives him an old rifle brought back from World War I and a left-over grenade, hoping his son will finally make the family proud. Across town at Lakemba, Nick (Rahel Romahn) drags Hassim (Lincoln Younes) away from his studies to join a car heading for the Shire along with devout Muslim Ibrahim (Michael Denkha) and freewheeling rapper D-Mac (Fayssal Bazzi) to join the raid.[3]
