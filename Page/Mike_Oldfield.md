MICHAEL GORDON OLDFIELD (born 15 May 1953)[1] is an English multi-instrumentalist and composer. His work blends progressive rock with world, folk, classical, electronic, ambient, and new-age music. His biggest commercial success is the 1973 album _Tubular Bells_which launched Virgin Records and became a hit in America after its opening was used as the theme for the film _The Exorcist_. He recorded the 1983 hit single "Moonlight Shadow"[2] and a rendition of the Christmas piece "In Dulci Jubilo".

Oldfield has released 26 albums, most recently a sequel to his 1975 album _Ommadawn_ titled _Return to Ommadawn_, on 20 January 2017.


Early life

Oldfield was born on 15 May 1953 at Battle Hospital in Reading, Berkshire to father Raymond Oldfield, a general practitioner, and mother Maureen (_née_ Liston), a nurse.[3] His elder siblings Sally and Terry Oldfield also became musicians who performed on several of their brother's albums. A younger brother David, who had Down syndrome, died in infancy.[4]

Oldfield attended St Joseph's Convent School, Highlands Junior School, St Edward's Preparatory School,[5] followed by Presentation College in Reading. At thirteen, the family moved to Harold Wood, Essex and Oldfield attended Hornchurch Grammar School, where, having already displayed musical talent, he took one GCE examination in English.[6]

Oldfield began to play the guitar at age ten, learning technique by copying instrumentals by Bert Jansch and John Renbourn that he played on a portable record player. He once attempted to learn musical notation and became a "very, very slow" learner; "If I have to, I can write things down. But I don't like to".[7] By the time he was twelve, Oldfield was performing in local folk clubs, earning as much as £4 per gig.[8][9] In his early teens Oldfield joined a beat group, performing music influenced by The Shadows.


Career

1967–1972: Early career

In 1967, Oldfield and his sister Sally formed the folk duo The Sallyangie and, after exposure in the local folk scene, signed to Transatlantic Records. Their only album, _Children of the Sun_, was released in 1969. After they split in the following year, Oldfield formed a rock duo with his brother named Barefoot.[10] This was followed by Oldfield joining The Whole World, the backing band for Soft Machine vocalist Kevin Ayers, playing bass and occasional lead guitar.[11] He and Ayers shared a flat for a time at the northern end of the Seven Sisters Road in north London. Oldfield went on to play on Ayers's albums _Shooting at the Moon_ and _Whatevershebringswesing_, both of which were recorded at Abbey Road Studios where Oldfield familiarised himself with various instruments in the studio such as orchestral percussion, piano, Mellotron, and harpsichord.[12] The band also included keyboardist and composer David Bedford, who quickly befriended Oldfield and offered encouragement to complete _Tubular Bells_. Oldfield was also the reserve guitarist for a production of the rock musical _Hair_ at the Shaftesbury Theatre, playing with Alex Harvey. Oldfield grew bored of the job after ten performances in and was fired after he decided to play his part for "Let the Sunshine In" in a 7/8 time.[13][14]

Having recorded sections of this early version of _Tubular Bells_ as demo pieces, Oldfield attempted to persuade record labels to take on the _Tubular Bells_ project. Nothing came of his efforts until September 1971, when as a session musician and bass guitarist for the Arthur Louis Band, he attended recording sessions at The Manor Studio near Kidlington, Oxfordshire, owned by a young Richard Branson and run by engineers Tom Newman and Simon Heyworth.[15] Branson already had several business ventures and was about to start his own record label, Virgin Records, together with Simon Draper. Newman and Heyworth heard some of Oldfield's demo music and took it to Branson and Draper, who eventually gave Oldfield one week's worth of recording time at The Manor. During this week, he completed "Part One" of _Tubular Bells_; "Part Two" was compiled over a number of months.[16]

1972–1991: Solo career and Virgin years

At nineteen Oldfield signed a six-album deal with Virgin Records, a new label established by Richard Branson and Simon Draper, with an additional four as optional.[17] _Tubular Bells_ is Oldfield's most famous work. The instrumental composition was recorded in 1972 and released on 25 May 1973 as the inaugural album on Virgin. Oldfield played more than twenty different instruments in the multi-layered recording, and its style moved through diverse musical genres. Its 2,630,000 UK sales puts it at No. 34 on the list of the best-selling albums in the country. The title track became a top 10 hit single in the US after the opening was used in _The Exorcist_ film in 1973. It is today considered to be a forerunner of the new-age music movement.[18]

In 1974, Oldfield played the guitar on the critically acclaimed album _Rock Bottom_ by Robert Wyatt.

In late 1974, his follow-up LP, _Hergest Ridge_, was No. 1 in the UK for three weeks before being dethroned by _Tubular Bells_. Although _Hergest Ridge_ was released over a year after _Tubular Bells_, it reached No. 1 first. _Tubular Bells_ spent 11 weeks (10 of them consecutive) at No. 2 before its one week at the top. Like _Tubular Bells_, _Hergest Ridge_ is a two-movement instrumental piece, this time evoking scenes from Oldfield's Herefordshire country retreat. It was followed in 1975 by the pioneering world music piece _Ommadawn_ released after the death of his mother Maureen.[19][20]

In 1975, Oldfield recorded a version of the Christmas piece "In Dulci Jubilo" which charted at No. 4 in the UK.

In 1975, Oldfield received a Grammy award for Best Instrumental Composition in "Tubular Bells – Theme from _The Exorcist_".

In 1976, Oldfield and his sister joined his friend and band member Pekka Pohjola to play on his album _Mathematician's Air Display_, which was released in 1977. The album was recorded and edited at Oldfield's Througham Slad Manor in Gloucestershire by Oldfield and Paul Lindsay.[21] Oldfield's 1976 rendition of "Portsmouth" remains his best-performing single on the UK Singles Chart, reaching No. 3.[22]

In 1978, _Incantations_ introduced more diverse choral performances from Sally Oldfield, Maddy Prior, and the Queen's College Girls Choir.

In June 1978, during the recording of _Incantations_, Oldfield completed a three-day seminar in Exegesis, a controversial self-assertiveness program founded by Robert D'Aubigny and based on Werner Erhard's EST training program. Oldfield used it to "cement the change" which had a significant effect on his personality, becoming more confident and outgoing, "to be myself, without all the bullshit".[23] Possibly as a result, the formerly reclusive musician staged his first major concert tour, the 1979 European tour, to promote the album that is chronicled in his first live release _Exposed_.

In 1979, Oldfield's music was used as the musical score for _The Space Movie_, a Virgin movie that celebrated the tenth anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission.[24] Also in 1979, he recorded a version of the signature tune for the BBC children's television programme _Blue Peter_, which was used by the show for 10 years.[25] In 1981, Oldfield was asked to compose a piece for the Royal Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer, titled "Royal Wedding Anthem".[26]

The early 1980s saw Oldfield make the transition to mainstream pop music, beginning with the inclusion of shorter instrumental tracks and contemporary cover versions on _Platinum_ and _QE2_ (the latter named after the ocean liner). Soon afterwards, he turned to songwriting, with a string of collaborations featuring various lead vocalists alongside his characteristic searing guitar solos. The best known of these is "Moonlight Shadow", his 1983 hit with Maggie Reilly. The most successful Oldfield composition on the US pop charts during this period was Hall & Oates's cover of Oldfield's "Family Man" for their 1982 album _H₂O_. Released as the album's third single, it hit the Top 10 during the spring of 1983 and was a hugely popular MTV music video.

Oldfield later turned to film and video, writing the score for Roland Joffé's acclaimed film _The Killing Fields_ and producing substantial video footage for his album _Islands_. _Islands_ continued what Oldfield had been doing on the past couple of albums, with an instrumental piece on one side and rock/pop singles on the other. Of these, "Islands", sung by Bonnie Tyler and "Magic Touch", with vocals by Max Bacon (in the US version) and Glasgow vocalist Jim Price (Southside Jimmy) in the rest of the world,[27] were the major hits. In the US "Magic Touch" reached the top 10 on the Billboard album rock charts in 1988. During the 1980s, Oldfield's then-wife, Norwegian singer Anita Hegerland, contributed vocals to many songs including "Pictures in the Dark".

_Earth Moving_ was released in July 1989 and was a moderate success. The album was the first to consist solely of rock/pop songs, several of which were released as singles: "Innocent" and "Holy" in Europe, and "Hostage" in the US for album rock stations. This was a time of much friction with his record label. Virgin Records insisted that Oldfield use the title _Tubular Bells 2_ for his next instrumental album. Oldfield's rebellious response was _Amarok_, an hour-long work featuring rapidly changing themes, unpredictable bursts of noise and a hidden Morse code insult, stating "Fuck off RB", allegedly directed at Richard Branson.[28][29] It was not a commercial success. His last album for the Virgin label was _Heaven's Open_, released under the name 'Michael Oldfield'. The album, notable for being the first time Oldfield had contributed all the lead vocals himself, consisted of songs and the rapidly changing instrumental piece "Music from the Balcony". However the rift with Virgin was healed some years later. In 2013 Oldfield invited Sir Richard to preside over the opening of the new school hall at St.Andrew's International School of The Bahamas, where two of Oldfield's children were pupils. This was the occasion of the debut of _Tubular Bells for Schools_, a piano solo adaptation of Oldfield's work.[30]

1992–2003: Warner years

The first thing Oldfield did when arriving at his new label, Warner Bros., was to write and release _Tubular Bells II_, the sequel to his first record on Virgin, in what appeared to be a final insult to his former label. It was premiered at a live concert at Edinburgh Castle. He continued to embrace new musical styles, with _The Songs of Distant Earth_ (based on Arthur C. Clarke's novel of the same name) exhibiting a softer new-age sound. In 1994, he also had an asteroid, 5656 Oldfield, named after him.[31][32]

In 1995, Oldfield continued to embrace new musical styles by producing the Celtic-themed album _Voyager_. In 1992, Oldfield met Luar na Lubre, a Galician Celtic-folk band (from A Coruña, Spain), with the singer Rosa Cedrón. The band's popularity grew after Oldfield covered their song "O son do ar" ("The sound of the air") on his _Voyager_ album.

In 1998, Oldfield produced the third _Tubular Bells_ album (also premiered at a concert, this time in Horse Guards Parade, London), drawing on the dance music scene at his then new home on the island of Ibiza. This album was inspired by themes from _Tubular Bells_, but differed in lacking a clear two-part layout.

During 1999, Oldfield released two albums. The first, _Guitars_, used guitars as the source for all the sounds on the album, including percussion. The second, _The Millennium Bell_, consisted of pastiches of a number of styles of music that represented various historical periods over the past millennium. The work was performed live in Berlin for the city's millennium celebrations in 1999–2000.

He added to his repertoire the MusicVR project, combining his music with a virtual reality-based computer game. His first work on this project is _Tr3s Lunas_ launched in 2002, a virtual game where the player can interact with a world full of new music. This project appeared as a double CD, one with the music, and the other with the game.

In 2003, Oldfield released _Tubular Bells 2003_, a re-recording of the original _Tubular Bells_, on CD, and DVD-Audio. This was done to "fix" many "imperfections" in the original due to the recording technologies of the early 1970s and limitations in time that he could spend in the recording studio. It celebrated the 30th anniversary of _Tubular Bells_, Oldfield's 50th birthday and his marriage to Fanny in the same year. At around the same time Virgin released an SACD version containing both the original stereo album and the 1975 quadraphonic mix by Phil Newell. In the 2003 version, the original voice of the 'Master of Ceremonies' (Viv Stanshall) was replaced with the voice of John Cleese, Stanshall having died in the interim.

2004–present: Mercury years

On 12 April 2004 Oldfield launched his next virtual reality project, _Maestro_, which contains music from the _Tubular Bells 2003_ album and some new chillout melodies. The games have since been made available free of charge on Tubular.net.[33] A double album, _Light + Shade_, was released on Mercury Records in 2005, with whom Mike had recently signed a three-album deal. The two discs contain music of contrasting moods, one relaxed (_Light_) and the other more edgy and moody (_Shade_). Oldfield headlined the pan-European Night of the Proms tour, consisting of 21 concerts in 2006 and 2007.[34]

His autobiography _Changeling_ was published in May 2007 by Virgin Books.[35] In March 2008 Oldfield released his first classical album, _Music of the Spheres_; Karl Jenkins assisted with the orchestration.[36] In the first week of release the album topped the UK Classical chart and reached number 9 on the main UK Album Chart. A single "Spheres", featuring a demo version of pieces from the album, was released digitally. The album was nominated for a Classical Brit Award, the NS&I Best Album of 2009.

In 2008, when Oldfield's original 35-year deal with Virgin Records ended, the rights to _Tubular Bells_ and his other Virgin releases were returned to him,[37] and were then transferred to Mercury Records.[38] Mercury issued a press release on 15 April 2009, noting that Oldfield's Virgin albums would be re-released, starting 8 June 2009. These releases include special features from the archives.[39] a further seven albums have been reissued and compilation albums have been released such as _Two Sides_.[40][41]

In March 2010, _Music Week_ reported that publishing company Stage Three Music had acquired a 50% stake in the songs of Oldfield's entire recorded output in a seven-figure deal.[42][43][44]

In 2008, Oldfield contributed an exclusive song ("Song for Survival") to a charity album called _Songs for Survival_, in support of the Survival International.[45] Oldfield's daughter, Molly, played a large part in the project.[46] In 2010 lyricist Don Black said in an interview with _Music Week_ that he had been working with Oldfield.[47] In 2012, Oldfield was featured on Terry Oldfield's _Journey into Space_ album and on a track called "Islanders" by German producer Torsten Stenzel's York project. In 2013 Oldfield and York released a remix album titled _Tubular Beats_.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, Oldfield performed renditions of _Tubular Bells_, "Far Above the Clouds" and "In Dulci Jubilo" during a segment about the National Health Service.[48] This track appears on the _Isles of Wonder_ album which contains music from the Danny Boyle-directed show.

In October 2013, the BBC broadcast _Tubular Bells: The Mike Oldfield Story_, an hour-long appreciation of Oldfield's life and musical career, filmed on location at his home recording studio in Nassau.[49]

Oldfield's latest rock-themed album of songs, titled _Man on the Rocks_, was released on 3 March 2014 by Virgin EMI. The album was produced by Steve Lipson. The album marks a return of Oldfield to a Virgin branded label, through the merger of Mercury Records UK and Virgin Records after Universal Music's purchase of EMI. The track "Nuclear" was used for the E3 trailer of _Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain_.

Interviewed by Steve Wright in May 2015 for his BBC Radio 2 show, Oldfield said that he was currently working on a "prequel to _Tubular Bells_" which was being recorded using analogue equipment as much as possible. He suggested that the album might only be released on vinyl. The project is in its infancy and would follow his current reissue campaign. Oldfield suggested that it would be released "in a couple of years".[50]

On 16 October 2015 Oldfield tweeted, via his official Twitter account _"I am continuing to work on ideas for "A New Ommadawn" for the last week or so to see if [...] the idea actually works.[51]"_ On 8 May 2016, Oldfield announced via his Facebook group page that the new _Ommadawn_ project with the tentative title of _Return to Ommadawn_ is finished, and he is awaiting a release date from the record company. He also suggested that he may soon be starting work on a possible fourth _Tubular Bells_ album.[52]

Oldfield's latest album, _Return to Ommadawn_ was released on 20 January 2017 and reached #4 in the UK Album Chart.[53] On 29 January 2017, Oldfield again hinted at a _Tubular Bells 4_ album via his official Facebook fan page; he uploaded photos of new equipment and a new Fender Telecaster guitar with the caption "_New sounds for TB4!_"[54]


Multi-instrumentalism and instrument choices

Although Oldfield considers himself primarily a guitarist, he is also one of popular music's most skilled and diverse multi-instrumentalists.[55] His 1970s recordings were characterised by a very broad variety of instrumentation predominantly played by himself, plus assorted guitar sound treatments to suggest other instrumental timbres (such as the bagpipe, mandolin, "Glorfindel" and varispeed guitars on the original _Tubular Bells_). During the 1980s Oldfield became expert in the use of digital synthesizer and sequencers (notably the Fairlight CMI) which began to dominate the sound of his recordings: from the late 1990s onwards, he became a keen user of software synthesizers. He has, however, regularly returned to projects emphasising detailed, manually played and part-acoustic instrumentation (such as 1990's _Amarok_, 1996's _Voyager_ and 1999's _Guitars_).

Oldfield has played over forty distinct and different instruments on record, including:

-   a wide variety of electric and acoustic six-string guitars and bass guitars (plus electric sitar and guitar synthesizer) in a variety of different styles including folk, rock, pop and flamenco and taking in techniques such as bowing
-   other fretted instruments (banjo, mandolin, bouzouki, ukulele, Chapman Stick)
-   keyboards (piano, assorted electric/electronic organs and synthesizers, spinet)
-   electronic instruments (Fairlight CMI plus other digital samplers and sequencers; assorted drum programs, vocoder, software synthesizers)
-   wind instruments (flageolet, recorder, penny and bass whistles, Northumbrian bagpipes)
-   free-reed instruments (accordion, melodica)
-   string instruments (violin, harp, psaltery)
-   unpitched percussion (including bodhrán, African drums, timpani, rhythm sticks, tambourine, shaker, cabasa)
-   tuned percussion (tubular bells, glockenspiel, marimba, gong, sleigh bells, bell tree, Rototoms, Simmons electronic drums, triangle)
-   plucked idiophones (kalimba, jaw harp)
-   occasional found instruments (such as nutcrackers)

While generally preferring the sound of guest vocalists, Oldfield has frequently sung both lead and backup parts for his songs and compositions. He has also contributed experimental vocal effects such as fake choirs and the notorious "Piltdown Man" impression on _Tubular Bells_.

Although recognised as a highly skilled guitarist, Oldfield is self-deprecating about his other instrumental skills, citing them as having been developed out of necessity to perform and record the music he composes. He has been particularly dismissive of his violin-playing and singing abilities.

Guitars

Over the years, Oldfield has used a range of guitars. Among the more notable of these are:

1963[56] Fender Stratocaster : Serial no. L08044, in salmon pink (fiesta red). Used by Oldfield from 1984 (the _Discovery_ album) until 2006 (Night of the Proms, rehearsals in Antwerp). Subsequently, sold for £30,000 at Chandler Guitars.
1989 PRS Artist Custom 24 : In amber, used by Oldfield from the late 1980s to the present day.
1966 Fender Telecaster : Serial no. 180728, in blonde. Previously owned by Marc Bolan, this was the only electric guitar used on _Tubular Bells_.[57] The guitar was unsold at auction by Bonhams in 2007, 2008 and 2009 at estimated values of, respectively, £25,000–35,000, £10,000–15,000 and £8,000–12,000;[58][59][60] Oldfield has since sold it and donated the £6500 received to the charity SANE.[61]
Various Gibson Les Paul, Zemaitis and SG guitars : Used extensively by Oldfield in the 1970s and 80s. The most notable Gibson guitar Oldfield favoured in this time period was a 1962 Les Paul/SG Junior model, which was his primary guitar for the recording of Ommadawn, among other works. Oldfield is also known to have owned and used an L6-S during that model's production run in the mid-1970s. On occasion, Oldfield was also seen playing a black Les Paul Custom, an early reissue model built around 1968.

Oldfield used a modified Roland GP8 effects processor in conjunction with his PRS Artist to get many of his heavily overdriven guitar sounds from the _Earth Moving_ album onwards.[62] Oldfield has also been using guitar synthesizers since the mid-1980s, using a 1980s Roland GR-300/G-808 type system, then a 1990s Roland GK2 equipped red PRS Custom 24 (sold in 2006) with a Roland VG8,[63] and most recently a Line 6 Variax.

Oldfield has an unusual playing style, using fingers and long right-hand fingernails and different ways of creating vibrato: a "very fast side-to-side vibrato" and "violinist's vibrato".[64] Oldfield has stated that his playing style originates from his musical roots playing folk music and the bass guitar.[65]

Keyboards

Over the years, Oldfield has owned and used a vast number of synthesizers and other keyboard instruments. In the 1980s, he composed the score for the film _The Killing Fields_ on a Fairlight CMI.[66] Some examples of keyboard and synthesised instruments which Oldfield has made use of include Sequential Circuits Prophet-5s (notably on _Platinum_ and _The Killing Fields_), Roland JV-1080/JV-2080 units (1990s), a Korg M1 (as seen in the "Innocent" video), a Clavia Nord Lead and Steinway pianos. In recent years, he has also made use of software synthesis products, such as Native Instruments.[67]

Lead vocalists

Oldfield has occasionally sung himself on his records and live performances, sometimes using a vocoder as a resource. It is not unusual for him to collaborate with diverse singers and to hold auditions before deciding the most appropriate for a particular song or album. Featured lead vocalists who have collaborated with him include:

-   Amar
-   Jon Anderson
-   Max Bacon
-   Rosa Cedrón
-   Roger Chapman
-   Cara Dillon

-   Anita Hegerland
-   Sally Oldfield
-   Barry Palmer
-   Maddy Prior
-   Maggie Reilly
-   Luke Spiller
-   Bonnie Tyler
-   Pepsi Demacque

Recording

Oldfield has self-recorded and produced many of his albums, and played the majority of the featured instruments, largely at his home studios. In the 1990s and 2000s he mainly used DAWs such as Apple Logic, Avid Pro Tools and Steinberg Nuendo as recording suites.[68] For composing classical music Oldfield has been quoted as using the software notation program Sibelius[69] running on Apple Macintoshes.[70] He also used the FL Studio DAW on his 2005 double album _Light + Shade_.[71] Among the mixing consoles Oldfield has owned are an AMS Neve Capricorn 33238, a Harrison Series X,[72] and a Euphonix System 5-MC.[73]


Personal life

Oldfield and his siblings were raised as Roman Catholics, their mother's faith.[74] In his early life, Oldfield used drugs including LSD, whose effects on his mental health he discussed in his autobiography.[75] In the early 1990s, he underwent a course on mental health problems and subsequently set up a foundation called Tonic, which sponsored people to have counselling and therapy. The trustee was the Professor of Psychiatry at Guy's Hospital, London.[76]

In the late 1970s, Oldfield was briefly married to Diana D'Aubigny (the sister of the Exegesis group leader), but this lasted just a few weeks. Oldfield has had seven children with his partners. In the early 1980s, he had three children with Sally Cooper: Molly, Dougal (who died aged 33 in May 2015)[77] and Luke. In the late 1980s, he had two children (Greta and Noah) with Norwegian singer Anita Hegerland. In the 2000s, he married Fanny Vandekerckhove (born 1977), whom he met during his time in Ibiza; they have two sons together (Jake and Eugene).[78] Oldfield and Fanny separated in 2013.

Oldfield is a motorcycle fan and has five bikes. These include a BMW R1200GS, a Suzuki GSX-R750, a Suzuki GSX-R1000, and a Yamaha R1. He says that some of his inspiration for composing comes from riding them.[79] Throughout his life Oldfield has also had a passion for aircraft and building model aircraft.[80] Since 1980, he has been a licensed pilot[81] and has flown fixed wing aircraft (the first of which was a Beechcraft Sierra) and helicopters (including the Agusta Bell 47G, which featured on the sleeve of his cover version of the ABBA song "Arrival" as a pastiche of their album artwork). He is also interested in cars and has owned a Ferrari and a Bentley which was a gift from Richard Branson as an incentive for him to give his first live performance of _Tubular Bells_.[82] He has endorsed the Mercedes-Benz S-Class in the Mercedes UK magazine. Oldfield also considers himself to be a Trekkie.[83] He noted in an interview in 2008 that he had two boats.[84]

In 2007, Oldfield criticised Britain for being too controlling and protective, specifically concentrating on the smoking ban which England and Wales had introduced that year. Oldfield then moved from his South Gloucestershire home to Palma de Mallorca, Spain and then to Monaco.[85][86][87] He has lived outside the UK in the past, including in Los Angeles and Ibiza in the 1990s and, for tax reasons, Switzerland in the mid-1980s. In 2009, he moved to the Bahamas and put his home in Mallorca up for sale.[88][89]
