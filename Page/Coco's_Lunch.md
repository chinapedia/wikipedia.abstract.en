COCO'S LUNCH is an _a cappella_ musical group based in Melbourne, Australia. The group was founded in 1994 by vocalists and multi-instrumentalists Lisa Young (voice, djembe, percussion), Nicola Eveleigh (voice, percussion, bass flute, ocarina), Jaqueline Gawler (voice, percussion), Sue Johnson (voice, percussion) and Gabrielle MacGregor (voice, djembe, percussion).[1] Coco's Lunch has a unique sound influenced by jazz, blues, classical, African and Carnatic traditions, and has been compared to artists such as Sweet Honey in the Rock and Bobby McFerrin.[2]

In 2003, Coco's Lunch won the award for "Best Folk/World Song" at the Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards for "Thulele Mama Ya", from the album _A Whole New Way of Getting Dressed_, which in turn was runner-up for the "Best Folk/World Album" category.[3] In the same year, their song "All the Wild Wonders", written by Sue Johnson in collaboration with author Elizabeth Honey, was nominated for the category "Most Performed Jazz Work" in the APRA Music Awards of 2003.[4]

Coco's Lunch received nominations at the ARIA Music Awards of 2007 in the category Best Children's Album for their album _Rat Trap Snap_ and in the category Best World Music Album for their album _Blueprint_.[5] In 2015, they won the "Best Song Composed or Originally Performed by (OPB) an AUS/NZ" category of the A Cappella Recording Awards, presented by Vocal Australia, for Lisa Young's song "Other Plans", which was also nominated for the category "Best Jazz Song".[6]
