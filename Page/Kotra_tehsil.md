The tehsil headquarter is located in the village of Kotra,[3] southwest of the Udaipur at a distance of 57 km and 120 km by road.


History

In the erstwhile Mewar State, present-day Kotra tehsil was part of the Kotra _Bhumat_ (also spelt _Bhumiat_),[4] an area comprising 242 villages.[5] _Bhumat_ was characterized by a system of land tenure under which petty chieftains held tenure known as _bhum_ (spelt as _bhom_ in certain sources).[6][7] The Kotra _Bhumat_ was administered by the chieftains of Jura, Oghna, and Panarva, who paid a small tribute to the Mewar Durbar and were liable to be called on for local service.[8][9] The Kotra _Bhumat_ could be distinguished from other parts of Mewar by the fact that "the Bhils [there] were never conquered: even the _jagirdars_ (were) of Bhil ancestry."[10]

During the British Raj, Kotra was directly under the political supervision of the second in command of the Mewar Bhil Corps and a cantonment was situated in the village of Kotra.[11] The 1908 Imperial Gazetteer describes Kotra as a cantonment where a detachment (two companies) is quartered.[12] Kotra was the site of the oldest medical institutions in the Mewar State, when regimental hospitals of the Mewar Bhil Corps were opened in 1818.[13]

In 1949, Udaipur State merged into Greater Rajasthan, and Udaipur district was formed with 18 tehsils, of which Kotra was one.[14] The Kotra panchayat samiti started functioning in 1959.[15] Between the census of 2001 and 2011, approximately 60 villages in the northeastern portion of the tehsil were reassigned to Gogunda and Jhadol tehsils.[16]

Whereas revenue settlement begun in some parts of Udaipur district in 1879, but it was not until 1955 that Kotra tehsil was settled, when 304 villages were settled.[17]

The general direction of the rivers is north to south. The Sei Dam is located on the Sei River in northern Kotra tehsil near the village of Teja ka Bas.[20] This is a 28 m high dam which is used to impound water not for use downstream of the dam, but for inter-basin transfer to Jawai dam in neighbouring Pali district.[21][22]

The Phulwari ki Nal Wildlife Sanctuary is partially situated in Kotra tehsil.[23]


Economy

Economic activities and livelihood opportunities in Kotra tehsil are limited; this has been attributed to small land holdings, poor quality of natural resources, lack of irrigation, and low literacy levels.[24] Thus, the economy of Kotra depends heavily on migration.[25] A 2006 survey found that at least one member from nearly half of Kotra households (49.2%) leave the tehsil to seek employment.[26] The chief destination for Kotra emigrants is the state of Gujarat (66% of workers), most of which is in the northern Gujarat districts of Banaskantha and Sabarkantha.[27] Migrants from the Kotra block are generally employed in unskilled employment with about 83% of them employed as unskilled laborers in agriculture and construction sectors.[28]
