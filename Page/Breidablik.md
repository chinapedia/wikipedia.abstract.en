In Norse mythology, BREIÐABLIK[1] (_Broad-gleaming_) is the home of Baldr. It is briefly described in Snorri Sturluson's _Gylfaginning_ as one of the halls of Asgard:

    "Then there is also in that place the abode called Breidablik, and there is not in heaven a fairer dwelling."[2]

Later in the work, when Snorri describes Baldr, he gives a longer description, citing _Grímnismál_, though he does not name the poem:

    "He dwells in the place called Breidablik, which is in heaven; in that place may nothing unclean be, even as is said here:



        Breidablik 't is called, | where Baldr has

            A hall made for himself:

        In that land | where I know lie

            Fewest baneful runes."[3]

Breiðablik is not otherwise mentioned in the Eddic sources.
