The 20TH ANNIVERSARY FAREWELL TOUR was a concert tour by former members of Rhapsody. It was announced on November 21, 2016 by ex-Rhapsody members Luca Turilli (founder and composer), Fabio Lione (lead singer), Patrice Guers, Dominique Leurquin and Alex Holzwarth.[1] It celebrated the 20th anniversary of _Legendary Tales_ and had a number of their classic hits played at their shows, along with _Symphony of Enchanted Lands_ in its entirety.

Fabio has stated that the original band would no longer exist as the other members want to do different music.[2] After the tour ended, Fabio and Luca announced that they had formed a new band together with the other members on the farewell tour called Turilli / Lione Rhapsody on December 5, 2018.[3]

Keyboardist Alex Staropoli did not play on this tour.
