ANGELO OF TOLENTINO was a 13th-century Franciscan missionary.


Life

He was jailed for excessive condemnation of luxury and after being released through the intervention of Raymond Godefroy, a new minister general who sympathized with the Spiritualists, he traveled with Angelo da Clareno, Marco da Montelupone, Pietro da Macerata, and Thomas of Tolentino[1] to missionize in Lesser Armenia in 1289.
