MODULUS is the diminutive from the Latin word _modus_ meaning measure or manner. It, or its plural MODULI, may refer to the following:


Physics and engineering

-   Moduli (physics), scalar fields for which the potential energy function has continuous families of global minima
-   The measurement of standard pitch in the teeth of a rotating gear
-   Elastic modulus, a measure of stiffness
-   Young's modulus, a specific elastic modulus
-   The modulo operator (%, mod, etc.) of various programming languages


Mathematics

-   Moduli space, in mathematics a geometric space whose points represent algebro-geometric objects
-   Conformal modulus, a measure of the size of a curve family
-   Modulus of continuity, a function gauging the uniform continuity of a function
-   Modular arithmetic, the modulus being the value at which numbers "wrap around"
-   Similarly, the modulus of a Dirichlet character
-   Modulus (algebraic number theory), a formal product of places of a number field
-   The absolute value of a real or complex number ( |_a_â€‰| )
-   The modular function in the theory of Haar measure, often called simply the modulus
