MARY ALICE "MOLLIE" HEINBACH was born June 9, 1854, in Pennsylvania, and died January 23, 1928, in Ilasco, Missouri.[1] In the 1910s, she and her sister, Euphemia B. Koller, were involved in the Heinbach v Heinbach court case to hold onto a plot of land that Mary's late husband Samuel "Sam" Heinbach left her.[2] This case resulted in the court placing a guardianship over Mary in 1921, which allowed for a court-ordered sheriff's sale of the land to Atlas Portland Cement Company in 1921.[3]
