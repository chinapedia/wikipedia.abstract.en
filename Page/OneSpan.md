History

In 1984, T. Kendall Hunt founded VASCO Corp. as a consulting and software services company for corporate and governmental agencies. The company acquired ThumbScan Inc., which claimed to have the first fingerprint reader device for a computer,[4] in 1991. It was renamed VASCO Data Security International, Inc. by 1993 and expanded its offerings to include data security. Vasco was incorporated in 1997 and held its initial public offering in January 2000.[5]

Vasco started developing its Digipass technology in the early 2000s. The company marketed the technology internationally in Belgium. In 2009, Vasco announced that Digipass two-factor authentication was available in the App Store for iPhone and iPod Touch. _Forbes_ recognized Vasco on its list of "America's Fastest-Growing Tech Companies" that year.[6][7][8]

In January 2011, Vasco acquired DigiNotar, a Dutch certificate authority.[9] In June 2011, DigiNotar was hacked and started issuing false security certificates. When the news broke, confidence was shattered, all issued certificates cancelled and the company went bankrupt.[10]

The company established its international headquarters at Dubai Silicon Oasis in 2012. Vasco announced that it would lower EMEA channel entry for VARs at that time. It became a member of the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance in June 2014 and was later recognized by Gartner's Magic Quadrant for User Authentication.[11][12][13][14]

In October 2015, Vasco acquired Silanis Technology, Inc., a Canadian document e-signature company, for $113 million. By early 2016, the company's cloud electronic signature software, eSignLive, was updated to include integration with Salesforce. Vasco announced a face recognition authentification feature for Digipass in May 2016. The company has partnerships with financial institutions including HSBC Bank USA, Fedict, Rabobank, Arab Bank and Riyadh Bank.[15][16][17][18][19]

On May 30, 2018, VASCO changed its name to OneSpan.[20] It now trades under the ticker symbol OSPN.

In May 2018, the company acquired Dealflo, a UK and Canada-based financial agreement automation software company, for GBP 41 million.[21]
