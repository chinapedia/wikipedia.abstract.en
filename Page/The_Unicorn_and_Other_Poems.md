Reception

The book sold well but was overall poorly received by critics, which made Lindbergh feel ashamed of her poems.[1] _Kirkus Reviews_ described the book as "the poetic versions of almost the same themes as _Gift from the Sea_", and wrote that these themes "are caught up here in a new freshness which will have its appeal to women who experience many of these emotions in common". The critic wrote that the quality is high enough "to win Anne Lindbergh a place among outstanding women poets".[2]
