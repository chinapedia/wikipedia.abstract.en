Reception

_The Indianapolis Business Journal_ reviewed the movie, stating that "In case you couldn’t tell from the film’s title, this movie is full of bad dialogue and mildly absurd story lines. But if you have ever wondered what kind of movie would arise if you melded “Kill Bill,” “A Fistful of Dollars” and “The Outlaw Josie Wales,” this movie is for you."[3] _The Santa Fe New Mexican_ also reviewed the film, writing "For a low-budget oater, _Shoot First_ is surprisingly well shot, well acted, and mostly well scripted (though it's a bit talky and repetitious in places)."[4]

Awards

-   Independent Spirit Award at the Santa Fe Film Festival (2008, won)[5]
