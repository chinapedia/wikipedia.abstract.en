The family ENTEROBACTERIACEAE is a very large family of Gram-negative bacteria that has been studied and characterized for almost a hundred years. It was first proposed by Rahn in 1936 and now included over 50 genera and over 200 species. Its classification above the level of family is a subject of debate, but one classification has it in the order Enterobacteriales of the class Gammaproteobacteria in the phylum Proteobacteria.[1][2][3][4]

Enterobacteriaceae includes, along with many harmless symbionts, many of the more familiar pathogens, such as _Salmonella_, _Escherichia coli_, _Yersinia pestis_, _Klebsiella_, and _Shigella_. Other disease-causing bacteria in this family include _Proteus_, _Enterobacter_, _Serratia_, and _Citrobacter_. Phylogenetically, in the Enterobacteriales, several peptidoglycan-less insect endosymbionts form a sister clade to the Enterobacteriaceae, but as they are not validly described, this group is not officially a taxon; examples of these species are _Sodalis_, _Buchnera_, _Wigglesworthia_, _Baumannia cicadellinicola_, and _Blochmannia_, but not former members of _Rickettsia_.[5] Members of the Enterobacteriaceae can be trivially referred to as enterobacteria or "enteric bacteria",[6] as several members live in the intestines of animals. In fact, the etymology of the family is enterobacterium with the suffix to designate a family (aceae)—not after the genus _Enterobacter_ (which would be "Enterobacteraceae")—and the type genus is _Escherichia_.


Morphology

Members of the Enterobacteriaceae are bacilli (rod-shaped), and are typically 1–5 μm in length. They typically appear as medium to large-sized grey colonies on blood agar, although some can express pigments (such as _Serratia marcescens_).

Most have many flagella used to move about, but a few genera are nonmotile. Most members of Enterobacteriaceae have peritrichous, type I fimbriae involved in the adhesion of the bacterial cells to their hosts.

They are not spore-forming.


Metabolism

Like other proteobacteria, enterobactericeae have Gram-negative stains,[7] and they are facultative anaerobes, fermenting sugars to produce lactic acid and various other end products. Most also reduce nitrate to nitrite, although exceptions exist (e.g. _Photorhabdus_). Unlike most similar bacteria, enterobacteriaceae generally lack cytochrome C oxidase, although there are exceptions (e.g. _Plesiomonas shigelloides_).

Catalase reactions vary among Enterobacteriaceae.


Ecology

Many members of this family are normal members of the gut microbiota in humans and other animals, while others are found in water or soil, or are parasites on a variety of different animals and plants.


Model organisms and medical relevance

_Escherichia coli_ is one of the most important model organisms, and its genetics and biochemistry have been closely studied.

Some enterobacteria are important pathogens, e.g. _Salmonella_, _Shigella_, or _Yersinia,_ e.g. because they produce endotoxins. Endotoxins reside in the cell wall and are released when the cell dies and the cell wall disintegrates. Some members of the _Enterobacteriaceae_ produce endotoxins that, when released into the bloodstream following cell lysis, cause a systemic inflammatory and vasodilatory response. The most severe form of this is known as endotoxic shock, which can be rapidly fatal.

Identification

To identify different genera of Enterobacteriaceae, a microbiologist may run a series of tests in the lab. These include:[8]

-   Phenol red
-   Tryptone broth
-   Phenylalanine agar for detection of production of deaminase, which converts phenylalanine to phenylpyruvic acid
-   Methyl red or Voges-Proskauer tests depend on the digestion of glucose. The methyl red tests for acid endproducts. The Voges Proskauer tests for the production of acetylmethylcarbinol.
-   Catalase test on nutrient agar tests for the production of enzyme catalase, which splits hydrogen peroxide and releases oxygen gas.
-   Oxidase test on nutrient agar tests for the production of the enzyme oxidase, which reacts with an aromatic amine to produce a purple color.
-   Nutrient gelatin tests to detect activity of the enzyme gelatinase.

In a clinical setting, three species make up 80 to 95% of all isolates identified. These are _Escherichia coli_, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, and _Proteus mirabilis_.


Antibiotic resistance

Several Enterobacteriaceae strains have been isolated which are resistant to antibiotics including carbapenems, which are often claimed as "the last line of antibiotic defense" against resistant organisms. For instance, some _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ strains are carbapenem resistant.[9]
