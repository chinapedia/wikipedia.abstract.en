The 2020 NORTH DAKOTA GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION will be held on November 3, 2020, to elect the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of North Dakota, concurrently with other federal and statewide elections, including the U.S. presidential election and election to the U.S. House of Representatives.[1] Incumbent Republican Governor Doug Burgum and Lieutenant Governor Brent Sanford are both eligible to run for re-election to a second term in office, but neither has yet announced whether he will do so.


Republican primary

The Republican Party will hold a state convention in the spring to endorse a single gubernatorial candidate. That candidate and his or her running mate will automatically be placed on the primary election ballot, where they may or may not face competition from other candidates placed there by petitionâ€”as incumbent governor Burgum did in 2016. The primary election will be held on June 9; its winner will appear on the general election ballot. All primary elections in North Dakota are open to all qualified North Dakota electors, regardless of party affiliation.[2]
