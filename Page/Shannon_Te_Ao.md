Walters Prize

Te Ao was the sole New Zealand artist selected for the 19th Biennale of Sydney in 2014.[3] His video work _two shoots that stretch far out_ (2013-2014) was shown at the Art Gallery of New South Wales for the Biennale.[4] In 2015 the work was shown at City Gallery Wellington alongside drawings by Susan Te Kahurangi King in the exhibition _Susan Te Kahurangi King and Shannon Te Ao: From the One I Call My Own_.[5]

In March 2016 Te Ao was announced as a finalist for the biennial Walters Prize (New Zealand's largest visual arts prize) for the work.[6] For his presentation in the Walters Prize exhibition at Auckland Art Gallery Te Ao showed _two shoots that stretch far out_ in one room, and in a space leading in to the screening installed _Okea ururoatia (never say die)_ (2016), made of living plants arranged on pallets and lit by hanging lights.[7] He was announced as the winner on 30 September 2016; the award was judged by Doryun Chong.[8]
