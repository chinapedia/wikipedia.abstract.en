BILL CHAMBERS is an Australian Country musician and former member of the Dead Ringer Band.[1][2] His album _Sleeping with the Blues_ and _Cold Trail_ were nominated for a 2003 and a 2016 ARIA Award for Best Country Album.[3]

Chambers was born in Southend, South Australia and married his wife Diane at age 20. Together they had 2 children, Nash and country singer-songwriter Kasey Chambers. Chambers and Diane started playing gigs together and soon were joined by Kasey and then Nash. The four piece band became known as the Dead Ringer Band. His marriage later got separated and in 1998 Chambers took a break, ending the band. He moved to Sydney, started producing records, started a record label, Reckless Records, then reunited with his family to support Kasey's solo career.[4]

In 1999 he released a duo album with Audrey Auld (as Bill & Audrey) called _Looking Back to See_. In 2002 Chambers released a solo album called _Sleeping with the Blues_ and continued as a solo artist with _Frozen Ground_, _Drifting South_, _Live at the Pub Tamworth_ and _Cold Trail_.

His latest album is called 1952 (January 2019) and is inspired by the late, great Hank Williams.
