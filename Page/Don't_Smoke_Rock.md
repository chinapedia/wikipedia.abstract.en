Critical reception

Bringing a taste of the Golden Age into 2016, Pete Rock and Smoke DZA remind listeners that solid production and thoughtful, socially relevant rhymes are timeless on their collaborative effort, _Don't Smoke Rock_. Employing his trademark sample style, the legendary Rock weaves jazz and soul snippets throughout each track, as DZA and a stacked roster of guests take turns with bars reminiscent of the '90s, _a time when there was more to mainstream hip-hop than mumbling_. The results are refreshing, nostalgic, and extremely satisfying for fans of that period. Released in the same year that saw the return of De La Soul, The LOX and A Tribe Called Quest, _Don't Smoke Rock_ serves as another link between eras: paying respects to old-school hip-hop legacy with updated perspectives and production quality. In case their intent was unclear, DZA even introduces the LP reminiscing about a pre-gentrification "old Harlem" on _"Intro"_ and later pining for the good old days on the creeping Cam'Ron & Nymlo track _"Moving Weight, Pt. 1."_ Rock's samples range from dramatic strings (_"Wild 100s"_), haunting hypnotic loops (the monstrous Wale track _"Show Off"_), and booming horns (the Dave East joint _"Limitless"_) to inspired comedic bits from Bernie Mac (_"I Ain't Scared"_) and Chris Tucker (_"Until Then"_). Highlights are numerous. On _"Black Superhero Car"_, DZA and Rick Ross trade verses over a throwback sample that sounds like early-era Pete Rock-disciple Kanye West. Royce Da 5'9" contributes to the plaintive, aptly titled piano-looper _"Hold The Drums"_, and an all-star cast of BJ The Chicago Kid, Jadakiss, and Styles P descend upon _"Milestone"_. The 13-track time machine does not relent or disappoint, making _Don't Smoke Rock_ a standout for hip-hop fans in need of quality nourishment.[2]
