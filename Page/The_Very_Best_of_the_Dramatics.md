_THE VERY BEST OF THE DRAMATICS_ is a compilation album by American soul vocal group The Dramatics released on Concord Records. The albus is part of Stax's Very Best Series.

Allmusic review by Al Campbell says: "This 2007 compilation is slightly superior than the 1976 version Best of the Dramatics, also on Stax, due to overall improved sound quality and the addition of the tracks "Your Love Was Strange" from 1969 and their last R&B charted single "Bridge Over Troubled Water" from the late '80s."[2]
