SHATANS[1] are odd-looking creatures of Belarusian mythology. In accordance with Belarusian folklore, Shatans are neutral characters and act as symbols of idleness and laziness.


Mode of life

Shatans lead a mindless way of life. All day long they wander about aimlessly without doing anything useful. Shatans are very annoying for other people and dispose them to the same way of useless wandering. But Shatans can not communicate with anyone in a normal way, even with each other and in case of a trouble they don't come to rescue and help each other.[2]

In Belarusian folklore it is said that angry mythological creatures (for example, the Witch) tease Shatans. As Shatans are also known as coward creatures - they hide or run away from the offenders. Sometimes, Shatans even die from attacks of evil spirits and beings.

When Shatans are tired of wandering around, they sometimes spin bast shoes. Bast shoes are quickly erased because of useless wandering.
