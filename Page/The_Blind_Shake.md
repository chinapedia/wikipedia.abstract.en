The Blind Shake are an American punk rock band formed in Minneapolis by brothers Jim (vocals/guitar) and Mike Blaha (vocals/guitar), with Dave Roper on drums.[1] They have released four albums and featured as a backing band for a number of artists, including John Reis and Michael Yonkers.[2]


Biography

The brothers developed an interest in music at an early age, when they were "in Third and Fourth grade, we had a twenty dollar Sears catalogue acoustic".[3] Both began to study guitar with Mike receiving lessons while Jim abandoned the instrument until he was 23.[4] Roper and Mike Blaha had played together in bands during their college years. Inspired by the simple approach of the punk rock, the two began playing together where Mike would use a baritone guitar.[5][6] In 2004 they released a self-titled single.[7]

In 2005, the band released their debut album _Rizzograph_,[8] that was followed by _Carmel_ in 2007, both on Learning Curve Records.[9] In the same year they backed Yonkers on the album _Carbohydrates Hydrocarbons._[10] In July 2011 they released the album _Seriousness_.[11][12]

In 2013 the band released _Key to a False Door_ through Castle Face Records.[13][14] Liquid Hip noted that the album was "significantly more diverse than previous outings".[15]

On April 10th 2015, The Blind Shake Released 'Fly Right', through Slovenly Recordings.

In October 2016 the band released _Celebrate Your Worth_ through Goner Records.[16]
