History

Highway_169_at_US_65_and_US_165_in_McGehee,_Arkansas.jpg The highway was created between 1936 and 1937 as a connection between State Road 1 and Arkansas Post.[4][5] The second section of Highway 169 was created in Crossett on July 18, 1985. The route was designated to provide access to the state highway system for an industrial facility.[6] The Crossett route was extended south on February 18, 1998, supplanting one of the three sections of Highway 278 (because US 278 was extended into Arkansas).[7] The third section of Highway 169 was created on September 27, 2000, by supplanting a short section of Highway 4 in order to reduce confusion.[8]

History

A second segment of Highway 169 was created between Humphrey and the Arkansas/Jefferson county line on March 28, 1973 pursuant to Act 9 of 1973 by the Arkansas General Assembly at the request of the Arkansas County Judge.[9] The act directed county judges and legislators to designate up to of county roads as state highways in each county.[10] This request came during a time when Arkansas State Highway Commission was seeking to close gaps in the state highway system.[11] Since the Arkansas County section left a gap between the end of Highway 169 and Highway 13 in Jefferson County, the ASHC extended the request to Highway 13.[12] The entire route was supplanted by a rerouted Highway 13 on June 22, 1977.[13]
