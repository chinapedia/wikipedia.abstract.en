FELINI is a tribe in the Felidae family.

There are two major groups of felids, the sabre-toothed cats of subfamily Machairodontinae and the conical-toothed cats. The conical toothed cats are divided into the pantherine cats, which include the big cats of genus _Panthera_ and the clouded leopards of genus _Neofelis_, and the feline cats, which include all the rest of the cats, from the smaller _Felis_ and _Prionailurus_ cats to the larger puma and cheetah.

Some authorities use the subfamily Felinae _sensu lato_ for all conical-toothed cats, in which case the tribe Felini is used for the feline cats, while the pantherine cats are assigned the tribe Pantherini. Other authorities use Felinae only for the feline cats (excluding the pantherine cats), in which case Felini is a synonym for Felinae _sensu stricto_.
