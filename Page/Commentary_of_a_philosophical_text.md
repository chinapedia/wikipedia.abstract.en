The COMMENTARY OF A PHILOSOPHICAL TEXT is the analysis of a philosophical text that is undertaken from different angles and points of view, and that enables the study of its nature and characteristics.[1]

Commentary has been a very important and useful tool. A large portion of the philosophical schools was originated through the analysis that different commentarists carried out of renowned philosophical texts. In ancient Greek and Rome, renowned schools of thought were started by commenting on texts from Plato and Aristoteles. A significant portion of Thomas Aquinas philosophical ideas were the result of commentaries to some of Aristoteles ideas.[2]

The commentary of philosophical text tracks its roots to the importance and relevance that philosophy assigns to the analysis of the language and the interpretation of texts.
