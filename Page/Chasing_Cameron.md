_CHASING CAMERON_ is an American reality television series starring Vine star Cameron Dallas.[1] It premiered on Netflix on December 27, 2016.[2] The series centers around Cameron Dallas, a "social media influencer", who is best known for his prominence on the video app Vine. He is one of the main members of a group called Magcon (Meet and greet convention), which was short-lived in 2014,[3][4] but revived, partly with other people, in 2016. During 2016, Magcon went on a tour in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, with events consisting of a show and a meet and greet.

The half-hour episodes depict Cameron and other Magcon members' road to fame, and the price that comes with Internet stardom, including a physical altercation that occurred in a European club. The show's co-starring tour members include Aaron Carpenter and Taylor Caniff, as well as Dallas' immediate family members. The first season of the show consisted of ten episodes.

On January 20, 2017, Dallas said in a red carpet interview at the People's Choice Awards: "For sure. 100% there will be a season 2. [...] I think it's gonna dive deeper more into my relationship between my mom and sister, and then kind of a more in-depth view on where we're going and what's continuing to go on, because we're only taking steps forward, so I feel like the more we go, the more interesting it gets". Dallas also stated that the second season would feature a different premise altogether.[7]

Reception

Since the release of _Chasing Cameron_ the series has received generally negative reviews.[18] Common Sense Media's critical consensus reads, "Internet star's self-serving reality show has iffy messages", while giving the show a rating of 1/5.[19] Kevin O'Keeffe, writing for mic.com also criticized the show, stating "his hesitance to let go of control makes Chasing Cameron a far worse show than it could have been".[20] Michael Andor Brodeur, writing for _The Boston Globe_, was somewhat more receptive, writing "There’s something about the abundant emptiness of “Chasing Cameron” that, right now, feels like a necessary refuge [...] basking in its inconsequential glow."[21]
