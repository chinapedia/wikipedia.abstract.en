Professional boxing career

In 1982 Cenicola became a professional with his first bout against Gary Gamble at the Sands Casino in Atlantic City, NJ. The fight was televised on ESPN. Cenicola initially was declared the loser of the fight after suffering a cut over his right eye from a clash of heads with Gamble in the second round. The NJ Athletic commission however, overturned the loss two days later and changed it to a "No Contest" result.

Cenicola went on to win his next 18 fights in a row, being trained by in part by Lou Duva, Chickie Ferrara, Allie Stoltz, Richie Giachetti, Don Turner and Johnnie Torres. Cenicola fought the promotional banners of Top Rank Boxing, Main Events and Tiger Eye. His most notable win was a hard fought decision against Robert "Choo Choo" Dixon on September 12, 1986, at the Omni New Daisy Theater in Memphis, Tennessee. Cenicola received a perforated eardrum and a torn retina and received more than 100 stitches for cuts he received during the fight but managed a unanimous decision, taking his record to 18-0 with 11 KO's. He was ranked in the top ten as a lightweight in the world in 1986.

After two straight losses to Bryant Paden on August 27, 1987, and to the number one contender Louie Lomeli on February 6, 1988, Cenciola retired at the age of 28 on February 7, 1988.
