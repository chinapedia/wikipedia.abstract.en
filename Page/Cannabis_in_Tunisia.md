Tunisian_Pilgrim_(1878)_-_TIMEA.jpg CANNABIS IN TUNISIA is illegal since 1953.[1] Cannabis is also known as ZATLA nationally or TAKROURI regionally.[2]


History

Cannabis is believed to have been introduced to Tunisia during the Arab invasions of the 9th through 12th centuries.[3] In 1550 Leo Africanus' _Description of Africa_ described hashish consumption in Tunis:

Cannabis was banned in Tunisia by decree on 23 April, 1953.[4]


Enforcement

Using or possessing entails 1–5 years of imprisonment + 1000-3000 dinars (around 500$-1500$). Selling, transporting or cultivating entails 6–25 years of imprisonment + 5000-100,000 dinars (around 2500$-50,000$).

Tunisia still uses urinalysis to prove cases of use without possession. If the urinalysis is below "20 nanogram/litre", defendant will be accused by inhalation which is 6 months of imprisonment.[5][6][7]
