HORROR is a genre of speculative fiction which is intended to frighten, scare, disgust, or startle its readers by inducing feelings of horror and terror. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon defined the horror story as "a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks, or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing".[1] It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it can be non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for the larger fears of a society.


History

Horror in ancient Greece and Rome

The horror genre has ancient origins with roots in folklore and religious traditions, focusing on death, the afterlife, evil, the demonic and the principle of the thing embodied in the person.[2] These were manifested in stories of beings such as witches, vampires, werewolves and ghosts. European horror fiction became established through works by the Ancient Greeks and Ancient Romans. The well-known 19th century novel about Frankenstein was greatly influenced by the story of Hippolytus, where Asclepius revives him from death.[3] Euripides wrote plays based on the story, _Hippolytos Kalyptomenos_ and _Hippolytus_.[4] Plutarch's "The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans: _Cimon_ describes the spirit of a murderer, Damon, who himself was murdered in a bathhouse in Chaeronea.[5]

Pliny the Younger tells the tale of Athenodorus Cananites who bought a haunted house in Athens. Athenodorus was cautious since the house was inexpensive. While writing a book on philosophy, he was visited by a spectre bound in chains. The figure disappeared in the courtyard; the following day, the magistrates dug it up to find an unmarked grave.[6]

Horror after AD 1000

The earliest recording of an official accusation of Satanism by the Church took place in Toulouse in AD 1022 against a couple of clerics.[7] Werewolf stories were popular in medieval French literature. One of Marie de France's twelve lais is a werewolf story titled "Bisclavret". Vlad_Tepes_coloured_drawing.png The Countess Yolande commissioned a werewolf story titled "Guillaume de Palerme". Anonymous writers penned two werewolf stories, "Biclarel" and "Melion".

Much horror fiction derives from the cruellest personages of the 15th century. Dracula can be traced to the Prince of Wallachia Vlad III, whose alleged war crimes were published in German pamphlets. A 1499 pamphlet was published by Markus Ayrer, who is most notable for its woodcut imagery.[8] The alleged serial killer spree of Giles de Rais have been seen as the inspiration for "Bluebeard".[9] The motif of the vampiress is most notably derived from the real life noblewoman and murderess, Elizabeth Bathory, and helped usher in the emergence of horror fiction in the 18th century, such as through László Turóczi's 1729 book _Tragica Historia_.[10]

Gothic horror in the 18th century

Horace_Walpole.jpg wrote the first Gothic novel, _The Castle of Otranto_ (1764), initiating a new literary genre.[11]]]

The 18th century saw the gradual development of Romanticism and the Gothic horror genre. It drew on the written and material heritage of the Late Middle Ages, finding its form with Horace Walpole's seminal and controversial 1764 novel, _The Castle of Otranto_. In fact, the first edition was published disguised as an actual medieval romance from Italy, discovered and republished by a fictitious translator.[12] Once revealed as modern, many found it anachronistic, reactionary, or simply in poor taste — but it proved immediately popular.[13] _Otranto_ inspired _Vathek_ (1786) by William Beckford, _A Sicilian Romance_ (1790), _The Mysteries of Udolpho_ (1794) and _The Italian_ (1796) by Ann Radcliffe and _The Monk_ (1797) by Matthew Lewis.[14] A significant amount of horror fiction of this era was written by women and marketed towards a female audience, a typical scenario of the novels being a resourceful female menaced in a gloomy castle.[15]

Horror in the 19th century

Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley_Rothwell.tif by Richard Rothwell (1840–41)]] Edgar_Allan_Poe_2.jpg The Gothic tradition blossomed into the genre that modern readers today call horror literature in the 19th century. Influential works and characters that continue resonating in fiction and film today saw their genesis in the Brothers Grimm's "Hänsel und Gretel" (1812), Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_ (1818), Washington Irving's _The Legend of Sleepy Hollow_ (1820), Jane C. Loudon's "The Mummy!: Or a Tale of the Twenty-Second Century" (1827), Victor Hugo's _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_ (1831), Thomas Peckett Prest's _Varney the Vampire_ (1847), Nathaniel Hawthorne's _The Scarlet Letter_ (1850), the works of Edgar Allan Poe, the works of Sheridan Le Fanu, Robert Louis Stevenson's _Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde_ (1886), Oscar Wilde's _The Picture of Dorian Gray_ (1890), H. G. Wells' _The Invisible Man_ (1897), and Bram Stoker's _Dracula_ (1897). Each of these works created an enduring icon of horror seen in later re-imaginings on the page, stage and screen.[16]

Horror in the 20th century

A proliferation of cheap periodicals around turn of the century led to a boom in horror writing. For example, Gaston Leroux serialized his _Le Fantôme de l'Opéra_ before it was a novel in 1910. One writer who specialized in horror fiction for mainstream pulps, such as _All-Story Magazine,_ was Tod Robbins, whose fiction deals with themes of madness and cruelty.[17][18] Later, specialist publications emerged to give horror writers an outlet, prominent among them was _Weird Tales_[19] and _Unknown_

_Worlds_.[20]

Influential horror writers of the early 20th century made inroads in these mediums. Particularly, the venerated horror author H. P. Lovecraft, and his enduring Cthulhu Mythos transformed and popularized the genre of cosmic horror, and M. R. James is credited with redefining the ghost story in that era.

The serial murderer became a recurring theme. Yellow journalism and sensationalism of various murderers, such as Jack the Ripper, and lesser so, Carl Panzram, Fritz Haarman, and Albert Fish, all perpetuated this phenomenon. The trend continued in the postwar era, partly renewed after the murders committed by Ed Gein. In 1959, Robert Bloch, inspired by the murders, wrote _Psycho_. The crimes committed in 1969 by the Manson family influenced the slasher theme in horror fiction of the 1970s. In 1981, Thomas Harris wrote _Red Dragon_, introducing Dr. Hannibal Lecter. In 1988, the sequel to that novel, _The Silence of the Lambs_, was published.

Early cinema was inspired by many aspects of horror literature, and started a strong tradition of horror films and subgenres that continues to this day. Up until the graphic depictions of violence and gore on the screen commonly associated with 1960s and 1970s slasher films and splatter films, comic books such as those published by EC Comics (most notably _Tales From The Crypt_) in the 1950s satisfied readers' quests for horror imagery that the silver screen could not provide.[21] This imagery made these comics controversial, and as a consequence, they were frequently censored.[22][23]

The modern zombie tale dealing with the motif of the living dead harks back to works including H.P. Lovecraft's stories "Cool Air" (1925), "In The Vault" (1926), and "The Outsider" (1926), and Dennis Wheatley's "Strange Conflict" (1941). Richard Matheson's novel _I Am Legend_ (1954) influenced an entire genre of apocalyptic zombie fiction emblematized by the films of George A. Romero.

Stephen_King,_Comicon.jpg]] One of the best-known late-20th century horror writers is Stephen King, known for _Carrie_, _The Shining_, _It_, _Misery_ and several dozen other novels and about 200 short stories.[24][25][26] Beginning in the 1970s, King's stories have attracted a large audience, for which he was awarded by the U.S. National Book Foundation in 2003.[27] Other popular horror authors of the period included Anne Rice, Brian Lumley, James Herbert, Dean Koontz, Clive Barker,[28] Ramsey Campbell,[29] and Peter Straub.

Post-millennial horror fiction

Best-selling book series of contemporary times exist in genres related to horror fiction, such as the werewolf fiction urban fantasy Kitty Norville books by Carrie Vaughn (2005 onward). Horror elements continue to expand outside the genre. The alternate history of more traditional historical horror in Dan Simmons's 2007 novel _The Terror_ sits on bookstore shelves next to genre mash ups such as _Pride and Prejudice and Zombies_ (2009), and historical fantasy and horror comics such as _Hellblazer_ (1993 onward) and Mike Mignola's Hellboy (1993 onward). Horror also serves as one of the central genres in more complex modern works such as Mark Z. Danielewski's _House of Leaves_ (2000), a finalist for the National Book Award. There are many horror novels for teens, such as The Monstrumologist by Rick Yancey (2009). Additionally, many movies, particularly animated ones, use a horror aesthetic. These are what can be collectively referred to as "children's horror"[30]. Although it's unknown for sure why children enjoy these movies (as it seems counter-intuitive), it is theorized that it is the grotesque monsters that fascinate kids.[31] Tangential to this, the internalized impact of horror television programs and films on children is rather under-researched, especially when compared to the research done on the similar subject of violence in TV and film's impact on the young mind. What little research there is tends to be inconclusive on the impact that viewing such media has.[32]


Characteristics

One defining trait of the horror genre is that it provokes an emotional, psychological, or physical response within readers that causes them to react with fear. One of H.P. Lovecraft's most famous quotes about the genre is that: "The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown."[33] the first sentence from his seminal essay, "Supernatural Horror in Literature".

In her essay "Elements of Aversion", Elizabeth Barrette articulates the need by some for horror tales in a modern world:

In a sense similar to the reason a person seeks out the controlled thrill of a roller coaster, readers in the modern era seek out feelings of horror and terror to feel a sense of excitement. However, Barrette adds that horror fiction is one of the few mediums where readers seek out a form of art that forces themselves to confront ideas and images they "might rather ignore ... [to challenge] preconceptions of all kinds."

One can see the confrontation of ideas that readers and characters would "rather ignore" throughout literature in famous moments such as Hamlet's musings about the skull of Yorick, its implications of the mortality of humanity, and the gruesome end that bodies inevitably come to. In horror fiction, the confrontation with the gruesome is often a metaphor for the problems facing the current generation of the author.

There are many theories as to why people enjoy being scared. For example, "[...] people who like horror films are more likely to score highly for openness to experience, a personality trait linked to intellect and imagination."[34]

Stephanie Demetrakopoulos illustrates a common interpretation of one of the benchmarks of the canon of horror literature.[35] Tina Broussard in an annotated bibliography of Dracula surmises Demetrakopoulos' thesis:

It is a now commonly accepted viewpoint that the horror elements of Dracula's portrayal of vampirism are metaphors for sexuality in a repressed Victorian era.[36] But this is merely one of many interpretations of the metaphor of Dracula. Judith Halberstam postulates many of these in her essay _Technologies of Monstrosity: Bram Stoker's Dracula_. She writes:

Punch_Anti-Irish_propaganda_(1882)_Irish_Frankenstein.jpg'': An English editorial cartoonist conceives the Irish Fenian movement as akin to Frankenstein's monster, in the wake of the Phoenix Park killings.
Menacing villains and monsters in horror literature can often be seen as metaphors for the fears incarnate of a society.]]

Halberstram articulates a view of Dracula as manifesting the growing perception of the aristocracy as an evil and outdated notion to be defeated. The depiction of a multinational band of protagonists using the latest technologies (such as a telegraph) to quickly share, collate, and act upon new information is what leads to the destruction of the Vampire. This is one of many interpretations of the metaphor of only one central figure of the canon of horror fiction, as over a dozen possible metaphors are referenced in the analysis, from the religious to the anti-semitic.[37]

Noël Carroll's _Philosophy of Horror_ postulates that a modern piece of horror fiction's "monster", villain, or a more inclusive menace must exhibit the following two traits:

-   A menace that is threatening — either physically, psychologically, socially, morally, spiritually, or some combination of the aforementioned.
-   A menace that is impure — that violates the generally accepted schemes of cultural categorization. "We consider impure that which is categorically contradictory"[38]


Scholarship and criticism

In addition to those essays and articles shown above, scholarship on horror fiction is almost as old as horror fiction itself. In 1826, the gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe published an essay distinguishing two elements of horror fiction, "terror" and "horror." Whereas terror is a feeling of dread that takes place before an event happens, horror is a feeling of revulsion or disgust after an event has happened.[39] Radcliffe describes terror as that which "expands the soul and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life," whereas horror is described as that which "freezes and nearly annihilates them."

Modern scholarship on horror fiction draws upon a range of sources. In their historical studies of the gothic novel, both Devandra Varma[40] and S.L. Varnado[41] make reference to the theologian Rudolf Otto, whose concept of the "numinous" was originally used to describe religious experience.

A recent survey reports how often horror media is consumed:

  To assess frequency of horror consumption, we asked respondents the following question: “In the past year, about how often have you used horror media (e.g., horror literature, film, and video games) for entertainment?” 11.3% said “Never,” 7.5% “Once,” 28.9% “Several times,” 14.1% “Once a month,” 20.8% “Several times a month,” 7.3% “Once a week,” and 10.2% “Several times a week.” Evidently, then, most respondents (81.3%) claimed to use horror media several times a year or more often. Unsurprisingly, there is a strong correlation between liking and frequency of use (r=.79, p<.0001).[42]


Awards and associations

Achievements in horror fiction are recognized by numerous awards. The Horror Writer's Association presents the Bram Stoker Awards for Superior Achievement, named in honor of Bram Stoker, author of the seminal horror novel _Dracula_.[43] The Australian Horror Writers Association presents annual Australian Shadows Awards. The International Horror Guild Award was presented annually to works of horror and dark fantasy from 1995 to 2008.[44][45] The Shirley Jackson Awards are literary awards for outstanding achievement in the literature of psychological suspense, horror, and the dark fantastic works. Other important awards for horror literature are included as subcategories within general awards for fantasy and science fiction in such awards as the Aurealis Award.


Alternate terms

Some writers of fiction normally classified as "horror" tend to dislike the term, considering it too lurid. They instead use the terms dark fantasy or Gothic fantasy for supernatural horror,[46] or "psychological thriller" for non-supernatural horror.[47]
