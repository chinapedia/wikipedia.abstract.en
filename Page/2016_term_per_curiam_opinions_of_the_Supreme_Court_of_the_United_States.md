Seal_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.svg The Supreme Court of the United States handed down nine _per curiam_ opinions during its 2016 term, which began October 3, 2016 and concluded October 1, 2017.

Because _per curiam_ decisions are issued from the Court as an institution, these opinions all lack the attribution of authorship or joining votes to specific justices. All justices on the Court at the time the decision was handed down are assumed to have participated and concurred unless otherwise noted.
