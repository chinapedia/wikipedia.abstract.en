History

GreatSchools was founded in 1998 as a school directory and parenting resource in Santa Clara County, with seed funding from New Schools Venture Fund. The next four years (1999–2002), the school ratings expanded statewide in California. In 2003, the main school guide resource expanded nationwide. In 2008–2011 was the launch of College Bound Program, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Robertson Foundation and the Walton Family Foundation.[3] In 2013 GreatSchools received a three-year grant from the Walton Family Foundation.[4] 2013 saw Zillow integrate GreatSchools information such as school search, school ratings and reviews into their real estate database.[5] 2014 included an expanded partnership with Maponics.[6]


Recognition and awards

-   GreatSchools received Outstanding Achievement awards in 2011 and Best In Class awards in 2009 from the Interactive Media Awards.[7]


Equity and Academic Progress Controversy

In 2017 GreatSchools began using proprietary ratings called Equity and Academic Progress in addition to test scores to calculate schools' overall ratings. Schools with a small population of disadvantaged students were given an arbitrary Equity rating. The change had the effect of lowering the rating for many highly rated schools and raising ratings for poorly performing schools. The change has been a subject of considerable controversy with parents and teachers.
