Africa_proconsularis_SPQR.png.]] ALTIBURUS was a Roman–Berber town located in Africa Proconsularis. The town is tentatively identified with ruins at Henchir-Medeina (sometimes Medét'na) (coordinates: 35 ° 52 '24 "N, 8 ° 47' 13" E) in modern Tunisia.[1][2][3]

There are remains of :de:Altiburus (Titularbistum) such as the Forum, a theatre, and houses with mosaics. Some small pre-Roman finds have also been made. In addition, numerous inscriptions in Punic and Latin were found.[4] The site is currently being excavated by Catalan University of Barcelona.

In antiquity, Altiburus lay on the road from Carthage to Theveste, 35 km from El Kef on the confluence of two streams, north of the present location of Dawwar Awlad Gama. The name of the town comes from the Punic language and evidence of inscription there suggest a strong Punic population element. The Emperor Hadrian granted the town Municipium status. The arrival of Islam took place in the end of the 7th century.
