MARION SCHEEPERS is a mathematician and a teaching faculty of the Department of Mathematics of Boise State University in Boise, Idaho since 1988.

He was born in December 1957, in Thabazimbi, South Africa. He completed his Ph.D.[1] thesis entitled _The Meager-Nowhere Dense Game_ at the University of Kansas under the supervision of Fred Galvin. His research interests cover set theory and its relatives, game theory, cryptology, elementary number theory and algorithmic phenomena in biology.

Presently, Scheepers is studying biological encryption mechanisms in certain single-cell organisms in collaboration with researchers from the University of Witten-Herdecke in Germany, and the Boise State Department of Biological Sciences. For this study, he has received grant funding from the National Science Foundation.[2]

He is particularly known for his work on selection principles and on infinite topological and set-theoretic games. He introduced themes that are common to many selection principles and is responsible for the Scheepers diagram.
