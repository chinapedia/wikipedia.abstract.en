Book - Rich Malaysia, Poor Malaysians

Anas is an occasional contributor for The Edge, The Star, Astro Awani and online portals. In 2014, Gerakbudaya published his best-seller book, entitled _Rich Malaysia, Poor Malaysians: Essays on Energy, Economy and Education_. A Malay version of the book, _Malaysia Kaya, Rakyat Miskin_ was also published the same year. Both versions was launched by Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, Malaysia's Former Finance Minister and also the Founding Chairman and CEO of Petronas in April 2014.[14]

Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah applauded Anas' intellectual discipline in completing the writing which he describes as demanding mental toughness, tenacity and absolute patience. Policy makers, scholars and corporate figures are of the opinion that the views and ideas presented in the book can be usefully adopted for the formulation of policies by political parties and the government.[15]

On Energy, the book touches on how Petronas plays it roles in its significant contribution to the country. It also explains the history, the regulations and mechanism used and the secret behind Petronas’ success.[16]

On economy, the book introduces the Malaysia's inequality dilemma, the myth of the rich and poor, high income nation versus low income citizen, the Malaysia's hollow economy conundrum and addresses issue on the foreign workers, education and healthcare. It also explains the concept of free trade, its pros and cons .[17]

On education, the book advocates revisiting the national education philosophy, the introduction of the Love Pedagogy, promoting reading and critical thinking culture, the introduction of philosophy. It also touches on volunteerism and how the third party can become an agent of democracy.[18]

The book also offers insightful proposals and shares a way out for the problems facing the country.

The book was a bestseller for more than six months at Kinokuniya and Borders and is arguably a tour de force in the local intellectual landscape, as a venue for ideas that bridge policies and the hopes of the people, the responsibility of educators and the potential of their students and more important the problems of the present and the potential of a brighter future.[19]

On 11th May 2017, Tan Sri Arshad Ayub, Father of UiTM and former deputy of Malaysia's Bank Negara launched the new and expanded edition of Rich Malaysia, Poor Malaysians. He was accompanied by Emeritus Professor Tan Sri Anuwar Ali, Former Vice-Chancellor of Open University Malaysia and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Tan Sri Dato' Ahmad Fuzi Abdul Razak, Secretary-General of the World Islamic Economic Forum and Professor Tan Sri Dr. Ghauth Jasmon, former Vice-Chancellor of Universiti Malaya.

Tan Sri Arshad Ayub highlighted that Malaysia's 60th year of independence is the precise moment that Malaysia is to return to the drawing board. He argued that Anas has initiated the process by bringing forward a multitude of original ideas encompassing energy, economy, and education based on his analysis on the state of the nation and he urged the government, politicians, the civil society, and policy makers to take heed of Anas' powerfully brave book.[20]

The expanded book is an updated version with 13 additional chapters providing a more holistic coverage on fundamental issues that are currently plaguing Malaysia on healthcare, the foreign workers, environment, the hollow economy, green technology, woman empowerment and others.
