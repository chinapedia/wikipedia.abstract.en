History

In 1983, the National Computer Council was formed by the government of Bangladesh. The name was changed to the Bangladesh Computer Council in 1990 by the Bangladesh Computer Council Ordinance. It falls under the Information Technology (ICT) division of the Ministry of Science and Technology and provides support and services to 661 government organizations and agencies.[5][6]

In 2016, the BCC launched eshikkha.net to teach computer programming in Bengali.[7] The Bangladeshi government awarded the BCC a contract worth over 12 billion taka (US$149 million in February 2017) to connect 2,600 union councils to the internet via fiber optic cable.[8]
