_TONGTIANLONG_ (meaning "Tongtianyan dragon") is a genus of oviraptorid theropod dinosaurs that lived in the late Maastrichtian epoch of the late Cretaceous period. It contains one species, _T. LIMOSUS_.[1]


Description

Tongtianlong-4-horizontal.png _Tongtianlong_ was a sheep-sized member of the oviraptorids, a group of omnivorous, feathered, bird-like theropods.[2] The describers of _Tongtianlong_ recognized that it possessed a set of distinctive characteristics that differentiated it both from other oviraptorosaurs. In particular, unlike other oviraptorids, the crest of _Tongtianlong_ was shaped like a dome, with its highest point just behind the eye socket; and the front edge of the toothless premaxilla, which would have supported its beak, was very rounded.[3]

Additionally, there is a distinct ridge on the front margin of the parietal bone, wedged between the frontal bones; the shaft of the lacrimal bone, which is located in front of the eye socket, is wide, flattened, and plate-like seen from the side; the foramen magnum (a hole in the back of the skull) is smaller than the occipital condyle (the boss forming the skull-neck joint); there is no ridge on the bottom of the front lower jaws, which is also not strongly downturned; and the xiphoid process does not flare out from the sternum behind the ribs. Other characteristics of the skull separate _Tongtianlong_ from its contemporaries; for instance, the nostril is situated much higher than the antorbital fenestra, a trait seen otherwise only in _Nemegtomaia_ and _Rinchenia_.[4]


Discovery and naming

Srep35780-f1.jpg The holotype of _Tongtianlong_, specimen number DYM-2013-8, was discovered during the construction of a new high school near Ganxian District in Jiangxi Province, China. The site where it was found is part of the Nanxiong Formation, which dates to the Maastrichtian epoch (although a more precise dating has not yet been conducted). The specimen is currently stored in the Dongyang Museum.[5] While the exceptionally well-preserved specimen was likely originally complete, portions of the arms, right leg, and tail were destroyed by the TNT blasting which unearthed the fossil.[6][7] Near the hip, a drill hole that was used to place TNT can be seen.[8]

The skeleton was preserved in an unusual pose, with a raised head and splayed arms; while it is difficult to tell exactly what led to this pose,[9] it has been speculatively suggested that the specimen died while it was trapped in mud and trying to free itself.[10] The genus name of _Tongtianlong_ combines a reference to the nearby Tongtianyan () grotto and the suffix _-long_ (, "dragon").[11] "Tongtian" also is a Chinese phrase meaning "road to heaven". The specific name, _limosus_ (the Latin word for "muddy"), refers to how the specimen was preserved in mudstone. It was first described and named by Lü Junchang, Chen Rongjun, Stephen L. Brusatte, _et al_.[12]


Classification

Paleoecology

Tongtianlong-5.jpg _Tongtianlong_ is the sixth oviraptorid described from the Nanxiong Formation, after _Banji_, _Ganzhousaurus_, _Jiangxisaurus_, _Nankangia_, and _Huanansaurus_, in that order. Given the variation in size among these oviraptorids (for instance, _Banji_ is much smaller than _Tongtianlong_), it is reasonable to hypothesize that some of them might be growth stages of others; however, it is more likely that they represent genuinely distinct animals, since juvenile oviraptorid specimens show that their anatomy does not change significantly with age.[14][15]

The describers of _Tongtianlong_ suggested that this diversity is indicative of an evolutionary radiation of oviraptorids that occurred just prior to the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.[16] However, the possibility that these species come from different points in time cannot be excluded, due to a lack of study on the stratigraphy and age of the Nanxiong Formation.[17]
