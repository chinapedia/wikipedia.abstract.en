GIBER Å is a long stream in central peninsular Denmark in Aarhus Municipality.[1] Giber Å and surroundings is a protected Natura 2000 site. It is located in the Marselisborg Forests approximately 4 miles south of the city of Aarhus. Giber Å begins in Testrup Bog (Danish: Testrup Mose) south of the suburb Tranbjerg and runs through Mårslet before passing Vilhelmsborg Manor and ending in the Kattegat by _Moesgård Beach_. The streams _Ballebæk_, _Morsebæk_, _Hovedgrøften_ and _Kapelbæk_ are tributaries to Giber Å and the stream is in addition fed by the water treatment plants in the area. Giber Å has since the Middle Ages marked the border between Beder and Mårslet Parishes and today the stream forms the northern border of the local municipal administrative area "Beder-Malling-Ajstrup".[2]

The stream is unregulated although it has through time been used by water treatment plants at Vilhelmsborg, Fulden Mill and Moesgård Forest Mill. North of the mouth of the stream is a flat valley which stretches to the stone dykes at Moesgård Forest. The area is open and managed as a recreational area with scattered trees and solitary conifers (_Juniperus communis_). To the south lies a fenced area with a reconstructions of a stone age house and a tumuli.[3]


Ecology

In 2004 Moesgård beach, by the outlet of Givber Å, was one of 18 Danish beaches hit by a bathing moratorium due to high levels of E. coli bacteria, stemming from the municipal water treatment plants that use the stream as a recipient. Regardless sea trout travel through Giber Å and can be found in the streams that feed it. Trout has been found as far as _Hovedgrøften_ and _Kapelbæk_ which starts in _Hørret Forest_. Aarhus Municipality works with locals to establish fish ladders to improve conditions for fish in the stream.[4] The white-throated dipper winters in Denmark and can be found at Giber Å and associated streams. Giber Å has in periods had a very low water level due to water being redirected to agriculture and residential use. The former Århus County decided the stream could be supplemented with water from a rain water bassin in Tranbjerg and if necessary groundwater.[5][6]
