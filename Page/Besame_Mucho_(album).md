_BESAME MUCHO_ is a live album by saxophonist Art Pepper recorded in Japan in 1979 at the same concerts that produced _Landscape_ and originally released on the Japanese JVC label in 1981 before being rereleased on the Galaxy label.[1][2]


Reception

The AllMusic review by Thom Jurek noted "Only the ballad is on the short side, and the rest give Pepper the opportunity to really stretch himself and interact with Cables, whose fluid scalar approach to soloing, while invoking bop's precision balanced by an abundant lyrical swing, was a perfect vehicle for the saxophonist's intense melodic improvising. This is a welcome addition to the U.S. catalog for fans and a fantastic introduction to Pepper's many gifts for the uninitiated".[3]
