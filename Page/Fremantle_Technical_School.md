The FREMANTLE TECHNICAL SCHOOL building, also known as the FREMANTLE TECHNICAL COLLEGE building, is a two-storey building of red brick construction located at the corner of South Terrace and Essex Street in Fremantle.[1]

The building adjoins the single storey former Infants and Girls School, which was built from 1877 to 1878; a small forecourt is formed by the recessed central bay former Infants and Girls School and the technical school building, which terminates the north end of the site.[2]

The public school was later transformed into a technical school, in 1902.[3]

Hillson Beasley, the chief architect of the Public Works Department of Western Australia, approved the plans for the Fremantle Technical School on 20 July 1912.[4]

Planned as the western wing of the old school, the building was estimated to cost Â£5,000. It has of frontage along South Terrace and was made from brick with a local limestone base. It features a Donnybrook plinth and facings, and a roof of Marseilles tiling. Designed to have ten new classrooms each to hold 30 students it provided access to the first floor via a wide stairway opening onto a large landing. Each floor had five classroom with the rooms on the ground floor surrounding a large open hall space.[5][6]

The foundation stone was laid by the then Minister for Education, Thomas Walker, on 31 October 1912.[7]

The brick and tile building was built in the Federation Free Style with banded stucco and stone.[8]

The official opening of the building was held on 16 July 1913, although classes had been held in some classrooms prior to the event.[9] It was opened by Thomas Walker together with the Mayor of Fremantle, Frederick James McLaren, in attendance.[10]
