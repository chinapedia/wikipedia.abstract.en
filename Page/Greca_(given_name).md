GRECA is a female given name in Italian, also known in its feminine variant of _Grecia_ and its male variant of _Greco_.[1][2] All three words derive from the Latin 'Graeca' or 'Graecus', which operated as an ethonym for someone born in Greece.[3] During the medieval era this was expanded to citizens of the Byzantine Empire. Semantically it is similar to the given name Elladio. In the modern era it is most commonly used in Sardinia and more specifically in the Sardinian province of Cagliari due to its cult of saint Greca.[4] It is also used in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.[5]
