On September 21, 2016, a boat capsized off the Egyptian coast with around 600 refugees on board in the Mediterranean Sea. 204 bodies were recovered (including at least 30 children), around 160 people were rescued, and hundreds of people remain missing, with approximately 300 people predicted to have been killed. Four people were arrested for trafficking and breaking capacity laws. The incident may be the worst this year in the Mediterranean Sea.[1][2][3][4]


Reactions

An Egyptian Member of Parliament named Elhamy Agina reacted to the incident by stating that the victims of the disaster "deserved to die" and "do not deserve sympathy", causing controversy after an emergency cabinet meeting between President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Egypt's security chiefs.[5]
