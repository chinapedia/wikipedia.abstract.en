A STUDENT NURSE is a student in a post-secondary educational program that leads to certification and licensing to practice nursing, usually as part of a program administered by a nursing school. The title 'nursing student' usually applies to students enrolled in an RN or practical nurse program. A nursing student can be enrolled in a program that leads to a diploma, an associate degree or a Bachelor of Science in nursing.[1][2]

After the Nursing student becomes a Registered nurse, he or she is required to participate in continuing education to retain their licensing and registration.[3] In 2010, it was projected that by 2018, there would be a 22% job growth in the nursing field; at the time it was the United States' fastest growing occupation.[4]
