The KARAMBUNAI INTEGRATED RESORT CITY is a mixed development project comprising a water theme park, water spectacles, a fountain, a cable car, a mangrove research centre, a harbour cruise, and a spa village. This resort is part of the Tenth Malaysia Plan (10MP) and Economic Transformation Programme (ETP).[1][2] It is the largest resort project in Sabah,[3] covering over 3,339 acres and is expected to create between 20,000 and 50,000 jobs for locals.[4]

In 2011, Cambodia's China Central Asia Group (CCAG) teamed up with Karambunai Corp to invest around RM310 million in the project.[5]
