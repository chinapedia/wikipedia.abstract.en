The HOUEN FOUNDATION AWARD () is Norway's most important award for architecture. It was established in 1893 by Anton Christian Houen (1823â€“1894). A successful merchant and businessman, Houen established several philanthropic legacies and funds in culture and research.[1]

The Houen Foundation Award is awarded to buildings that are examples of "outstanding, independently completed works of architecture" in recognition of an architect's highest achievement. The award is made by the Norwegian Ministry of Culture at a recommendation from the board of the Association of Norwegian Architects (_Norske arkitekters landsforbund_) in collaboration with the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design.[2][3]
