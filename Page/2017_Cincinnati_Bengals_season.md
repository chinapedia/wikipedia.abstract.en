The 2017 CINCINNATI BENGALS SEASON was the franchise's 48th season in the National Football League, their 50th overall and their 15th under head coach Marvin Lewis. After starting 0–2, scoring only 9 points, and not scoring any touchdowns in their first two games, the Bengals fired offensive coordinator Ken Zampese. Quarterbacks coach Bill Lazor was promoted to offensive coordinator to replace Zampese.[1] The Bengals suffered back to back losing seasons for the first time since 2007–2008. However, the Bengals were able to knock off two teams contending for the playoffs at the end of their season, the Detroit Lions in Week 16, and the Baltimore Ravens in Week 17.

In the third quarter, the Bengals moved back ahead by double digits when Darqueze Dennard returned an interception 89 yards for a touchdown to make it 24–10. Though, the Ravens reduced that lead again when Alex Collins ran for a 17-yard touchdown to make it 24–17. In the fourth quarter, the Ravens managed to take the lead when Tucker kicked a 34-yard field goal to make it 24–20 followed up by Flacco connecting with Mike Wallace on a 6-yard pass to make it 27–24. Though, the Bengals were able to complete the comeback when Dalton found Tyler Boyd on a 49-yard pass to make the final score 31–27.

The Bengals spoiled their division rival's playoff hopes thanks to a late Andy Dalton touchdown pass to Tyler Boyd. Due to the tiebreakers, and after a 4th down pass from Flacco to Wallace fell a few yards short of converting to a first down, the win also allowed the Buffalo Bills to end their 17-year postseason drought, as they would qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 1999.

The team finished 7–9.
