_MODERN MUSIC_ is an album by pianists Brad Mehldau and Kevin Hays.


Background

The three protagonists for the album – composer and arranger Patrick Zimmerli, and pianists Brad Mehldau and Kevin Hays – were friends.[1] Mehldau was already known for mixing elements from forms of music other than jazz into his performances, and Hays had more recently extended "from his signature, intelligent, hard swinging post-bop approach to include compositions with modern classical touches".[2]


Music and recording

The album was recorded in October 2010 at Mechanics Hall, Worcester, Massachusetts.[3] Zimmerli composed three of the pieces and arranged the others, which included an original each from Mehldau and Hays.[4] The three Zimmerli pieces have "busy palettes, intricate cross-keyboard dialogues, and contrapuntal studies".[5]


Reception

The album was released by Nonesuch Records on September 20, 2011.[6] The AllMusic reviewer concluded that "it's not a jazz album, but one in which new considerations of harmonic composition and intra-instrument dialogue are readily apparent and delivered upon with discipline as well as verve."[7] The _Financial Times_ reviewer commented on the two pianists' awareness of what they were doing together and the positive impact of the structure of their playing.[8]
