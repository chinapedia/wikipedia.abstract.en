The 1964 MIAMI REDSKINS FOOTBALL TEAM was an American football team that represented Miami University in the Mid-American Conference (MAC) during the 1964 college football season. In their second season under Schembechler, the Redskins compiled a 6–3–1 record (4–2 against MAC opponents), finished in a tie for second place in the MAC, and outscored all opponents by a combined total of 210 to 142.[1][2] On October 17, 1964, in what is regarded as one of the great victories in Miami football history,[3] Miami defeated Northwestern, coached by former Miami mentor Ara Parseghian, by a 28 to 27 score.[4]

The team's statistical leaders included quarterback Ernie Kellermann with 1,260 passing yards, Don Peddie with 691 rushing yards, and John Erisman with 392 receiving yards.[5] Kellerman was selected as the team's most valuable player and was also a first-team All-MAC selection.[6] Kellerman, Mike Cohen, and Bill Williams were the team captains.[7]
