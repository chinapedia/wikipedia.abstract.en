FOOTBALL is the most popular sport, both in terms of participants and spectators, in Zagreb. Zagreb has several of Croatia's significant football clubs.


Introduction

GNK Dinamo Zagreb is Zagreb's most successful club.

Maksimir Stadium, Dinamo's home ground is located in the city centre. It is also the home venue of the Croatia national football team.


History

Football was popularized in Zagreb by Franjo Bučar in the late 19th century. The earliest clubs were founded before World War I - HAŠK and PNIŠK in 1903, Concordia in 1906 and Građanski in 1911. First league competition in Croatia started in Zagreb in 1912. After World War I Zagreb clubs joined the Yugoslav First League, with Građanski, Concordia and HAŠK becoming yugoslav champions. In 1945 old clubs were dissolved and new, the likes of Dinamo, Zagreb and Lokomotiva, were founded by the socialist regime. Dinamo later became four time champion of Yugoslavia.
