NATIVE ESPERANTO SPEAKERS (Esperanto: _denaskuloj_ or _denaskaj esperantistoj_) are people who have acquired Esperanto as one of their native languages. As of 1996, there were 350 or so attested cases of families with native Esperanto speakers.[1][2] Estimates from associations indicate that there were around 1,000 Esperanto-speaking families, involving perhaps 2,000 children in 2004.[3] According to a 2019 synthesis of all the estimates made, they would be between several hundred and 2000, and would compose between <1% and 4.5% of the Esperanto community[4]. In all known cases, speakers are natively bilingual, or multilingual, raised in both Esperanto and either the local national language or the native language of their parents. In all but a handful of cases, it was the father who used Esperanto with the child. In the majority of such families, the parents had the same native language, though in many the parents had different native languages, and only Esperanto in common.[5][6]

Raising children in Esperanto occurred early in the history of the language, notably with the five children of Montagu Butler (1884–1970). Because of this, some families have passed Esperanto on to their children for several generations.[7] Also notable are young Holocaust victim Petr Ginz,[8] whose drawing of the planet Earth as viewed from the moon was carried aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia, and Daniel Bovet,[9] the recipient of the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Esperanto is not the primary language of any geographic region, outside of temporary gatherings (such as conventions like the World Congress of Esperanto) and isolated offices (such as the World Esperanto Association's central office in Rotterdam). Consequently, native speakers have limited opportunity to meet one another except where meetings are specially arranged. For this reason, many parents consider it important to bring their children regularly to Esperanto conventions such as the annual "Renkontiĝo de Esperanto-familioj" (or "Esperantistaj familioj"; REF, since 1979). Similarly, the annual happens alongside the largest Esperanto convention, the World Congress of Esperanto (_Universala Kongreso_).

Grammatical characteristics

The Esperanto of native-speaking children differs from the standard Esperanto spoken by their parents. In some cases this is due to interference from their other native language (the adstrate), but in others it appears to be an effect of acquisition.

Bergen (2001) found the following patterns in a study of eight native-speaking children, aged 6 to 14, who were bilingual in Hebrew (two siblings), Slovak (two siblings), French, Swiss German, Russian, and Croatian.[10]

-   Phonological reduction (usually to schwa) of vowels in common grammatical suffixes and one-syllable grammatical words. This occurred about 5% of the time. The reduced grammatical suffixes were mostly the _-o_ of nouns and _-as_ of present-tense verbs, but occasionally also the _-a_ of adjectives. Reduced grammatical words included personal pronouns (which all end in _i_), the article _la_ 'the', and prepositions such as _al_ 'to' and _je_ (a generic preposition). The article _la_ was sometimes omitted with the Slavic speakers, as might be expected as a contact effect.
-   Proper nouns were generally unassimilated, either to Esperanto grammatical suffixes or to stress patterns. Proper nouns are common exceptions to grammatical rules in many languages, and this patterns in common among L2-speakers of Esperanto as well. However, stress was also observed to vary in native words, for example _nómiĝas_ 'is/am called' and _ámikoj_ 'friends' (stress expected on the _i_ in both cases).
-   Children were not observed to use compound tenses (_esti_ + a participle) or aspectual affixes (_ek-, -iĝi, -adi, re-, el-_) on verbal roots. Except for simple passives, the parents were not observed to use compound tenses either. However, they did use aspectual affixes (at least in the formal context of Bergen's interviews), but nonetheless the children did not use such affixes even when their other language was Slavic, where aspectual affixes are important. The closest thing to such forms that the children were observed to use were _fini_ + verb 'stop doing something', _komenci_ + verb 'start doing something', _ankoraŭ_ 'still', and _kaj poste_ 'and then'; but even then, usage was not as common as equivalents in the adstrate language. _-Iĝi_ was, however, used on adjectival roots:



        _Malheliĝas kaj ili ankoraŭ estas ĉe la plaĝo._ – It's becoming dark and they are still on the beach.

-   The word order was mostly SVO. OSV order was also attested, but half of all instances were with the Swiss German-speaking child, and Swiss German allows preposing the object.
-   Related to the fixed word order, there is evidence that the accusative case has become redundant. Usage closely reflects the role of case in the adstrate language, being used only where consistent with the other language, but not always ever there. Usage ranged from ≈100% with the Slovak-speaking children, to 0% with the French-speaking child,[11] despite the fact that the French mother consistently used the accusative case in her own speech. Slovak has an accusative case on nouns, French does not. Other children used the accusative in only some of the contexts required by standard Esperanto, largely reflecting usage in their other language. There were other patterns to emerge as well. The Croatian child, for example, used the accusative only on personal pronouns immediately following a verb (underlined):



        _En la sepa, unu infano prenis liaN ŝtrumpo._ (Standard: ''liaN ŝtrumpoN) – At seven o'clock, a child took hiS sock.

    but

        _Poste li iris kaj poste li prenis en unu mano lia simio._ (Standard: ''liaN simioN) – Then he went and then he took in one hand his monkey.

Among children that do use the accusative, its usage may be regularized from adult usage, at least at young ages. For example, when a screw dropped out of a lock, a young (≤ 5-year-old) child said it _malvenis la pordoN._ Besides the novel use of _mal-_ with _veni_ 'to come' to mean 'come away from', the accusative is not used in adult speech for motion away, but only motion towards. However, in this case the child generalized the usage of the accusative for direct objects.[12]

Lindstedt, on the other hand, referencing Bergen's study, contends that "it is difficult to find convincing examples of changes introduced by the process of nativisation. All examples proposed seem rather to be due to (1) transfers from the children’s other native languages, (2) differences between the spoken and written register of Esperanto and, in some cases, (3) incomplete acquisition." Some of the features, such as phonological reduction, can be found in the speech of some fluent non-native speakers, while some other, such as the attrition of the accusative, are completely absent from the speech of some native-speaking children.[13]


Word derivation

Native-speaking children, especially at a young age, may coin words that do not exist in the speech of their parents, often for concepts for which Esperanto has a word they do not yet know, by exploiting the morphology of the language. This is analogous to what adult speakers do for concepts where Esperanto lacks a word, and indicates that some of the grammatical alterations that adult learners may find difficult come easily to native-speaking children. For example,[14]

-   Antonyms in _mal-_

    The prefix _mal-_ is extremely productive, and children extend it beyond the usage they hear:

        _malmiksi_ 'to separate' (_miksi_ to mix)
        _malpluvi_ 'to stop raining' (_pluvi_ to rain)
        _malscias_ 'is ignorant of' (_scias_ knows)

        _malĝustigis_ 'broke' (_ĝustigis_ repaired, made right)
        _malsandviĉiĝis_ 'became (a shape) which isn't a sandwich anymore' (_sandviĉ-iĝis_ 'became a sandwich', of a brother playing with cushions)
        _malstelita_ 'not surrounded by stars' (of the moon; from _stelita_ 'starred')
        _malmateno_ 'evening' (_mateno_ morning)
        _malio_ 'nothing' (_io_ 'something'; standard Esperanto _nenio_ 'nothing')
        _malinterne_ 'externally' (_interne_ internally)

        _kuvi_ 'to have a bath' (_kuvo_ 'tub'; standard Esperanto _bani sin_ 'to bathe oneself')
        _mukis_ '(my nose) was running' (_muko_ 'snot', by analogy with _sangis_ 'bled', from _sango_ 'blood')

        _ne seĝu sur la divano_ 'don't sit on the couch' (_seĝo_ 'chair'; standard Esperanto _sidu_ 'sit')
        _muzi_ 'to museum' (from _muzeo_ 'museum', misunderstood as _muz-ejo_ 'a place for museuming')

-   Verbs from adjectives

        _mi superruliĝos vin_ 'I will roll over you' (an intransitive verb ending in _-iĝos_ won't normally take an object in the accusative case, but here it is necessary because the preposition _super_ 'over' has been moved to the verb _rul_ 'roll'. Without the suffix _-iĝos_, however, the meaning would be a transitive 'I will roll you over'.)

-   Adverbs from verbs



        _Ege halte, ege paŭze, ege salte_ 'very stoppingly, very pausingly, very jumpily'

-   Adverbs from nouns and prepositions



        _Ene estas akve_ 'inside is wet' (_akvo_ 'water'; standard Esperanto is _malseke_, an adverb being required because no specific thing is wet.)

-   Nouns from adjectives



        _ludeblo_ 'the possibility of playing' (_ludi_ to play, _-ebla_ -able)
