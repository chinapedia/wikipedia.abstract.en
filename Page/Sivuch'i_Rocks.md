The SIVUCH'I ROCKS (, _Ostrova Sivuch'i Kamni_) are a group of barren islets and rocks on the eastern side of Uda Gulf, in the western Sea of Okhotsk.[1]


Geography

They lie just north of Medvezhy Island. The largest are two islets, lying 4 km (2.5 mi) northwest and southeast from each other, the former 232 m (761 ft) high and the latter 171 m (561 ft) high. A 79 m (259 ft) high pillar rock lies just to the southwest of the latter of the two islets. Reefs fringe the group.[2]


History

American whaleships and boat crews cruised for bowhead whales around the rocks between 1855 and 1874. They called them the SUGAR LOAF or PINNACLE ROCKS.[3] On the night of 11 October 1858, the bark _Ocean Wave_ (380 tons), under Captain Hiram Baker, of New Bedford, was wrecked on one of the rocks during a gale. All hands were lost.[4][5][6]
