The BOCHUMER SYMPHONIKER is the classical orchestra of Bochum, Germany.


History

The Bochumer Symphoniker orchestra was founded in 1918 (originally as "Städtisches Orchester" or City Orchestra), at the same time as the Bochum Theatre and its main purpose was to accompany theatrical productions. The first public concert was given under the lead of the music director Rudolf Schulz-Dornburg on May 20, 1919.

Under its new music director Klaus Nessträter, the orchestra received attention throughout Germany, especially for its operas. Between September 1944 and July 1945 the service was interrupted during World War II.

After the war, the orchestra quickly reestablished its popularity and at the opening of the theatre's new building in 1955 Paul Hindemith was guest conductor.

The orchestra played for the grand opening of the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 (Expo 58), with Franz-Paul Decker as music director.

During the leadership of Yvon Baarspul (from 1964 to 1970) the size of the orchestra was increased by 17 musicians to a total of 80 and it was at this time that the orchestra was renamed the "Bochumer Symphoniker".

Under music director Othmar Mága (from 1971 to 1982) audience numbers had increased to 54,000 for the 75 concerts during the 1978/79 season. In 1982 Gabriel Chmura was nominated to the position of music director, followed by Eberhard Kloke in 1988. Kloke introduced contemporary music to the orchestra's repertoire and sought out new concert venues. In 1991, they played for the first time at the Centennial concert hall in Bochum (the Jahrhunderthalle).[1] Whilst these performances were critically acclaimed, they did not find favor with the wider public. In the same year also the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra played for the first time in this venue.[2]


Current management

Since 1994 Steven Sloane has been the Music director of the Bochumer Symphoniker and he has succeeded in increasing audience numbers significantly. For Sloane's music programme and projects the orchestra has already twice won the prestigious German Music Publishers' Association ("Deutschen Musikverleger-Verband") prize for best concert programme of the year (seasons 1996/1997 and 2004/2005).[3]

The orchestra tours internationally and in recent years has gained a reputation in Israel, the USA (Los Angeles and Chicago) and Estonia.

In 2006 the orchestra played a new version of the opera _Die Soldaten_ by Bernd Alois Zimmermann at the Ruhrtriennale, which was then presented at the 2008 Lincoln Center Festival in New York.

The orchestra has also taken part in a number of Crossover music projects: for example with Jethro-Tull lead Ian Anderson; with the a cappella group Take 6; and at a sell-out concert with the well-known German musician Herbert Grönemeyer at Bochum's main Football Stadium, the Ruhrstadion in front of 29,000 people.[4] In 2011 they played seven concerts together with Sting during his _Symphonicities Tour_.[5]


Concert halls

The orchestra's principal venues for rehearsals and concerts prior to 2016 were the main auditorium of the Ruhr University Bochum and the Centennial Hall, Bochum. On October 27, 2016 the orchestra took up residence in their new concert hall, the Anneliese Brost Musikforum and this is now their main venue.[6]


Recordings

For the British Label ASV, the orchestra has recorded the complete works of the German Romantic composer Joseph Marx; the first CD _Natur-Trilogie_ received the British Music Society's best CD of the Month award, the second CD, the _Orchesterlieder_, was nominated for the Grammy.[7]
