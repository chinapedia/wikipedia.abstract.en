_SKELETOCUTIS BAMBUSICOLA_ is a species of poroid crust fungus in the family Polyporaceae. It was described as new to science in 2012 by mycologists Li-Wei Zhou and Wen-Min Qin. It is found in southern China, where it grows on dead bamboo. The type collection was made in Mengla County, Yunnan Province. The specific epithet _bambusicola_ refers to its growth on bamboo. At the time of publication, _S. bambusicola_ was the 22nd _Skeletocutis_ species recorded from China.[1]


Descriptipon

The fruit body forms a 1 mm-thick cream-coloured crust on the bamboo up to long and wide. It has a soft texture when fresh, but becomes corky when dry. The hymenium comprises tiny round to angular pores numbering 8 to 11 per mm.[2]

_Skeletocutis bambusicola_ has a dimitic hyphal system, meaning it has both generative and skeletal hyphae. Most of the generative hyphae bear clamp connections. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped with four sterigmata, and have a clamp at the base; they measure 12–20 by 4–5 μm. The spores are ellipsoid in shape, hyaline (translucent), smooth and thin-walled. They measure 2.7–3.1 by 1.5–1.9 μm.[3]
