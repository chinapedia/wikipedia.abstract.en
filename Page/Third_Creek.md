The stream headwaters are in Gasconade County at and the confluence with the Gasconade is in Osage County at .[2] The stream source is just west of Missouri Route 19 north of Owensville. The stream flows northwest past Old Woollam and, after passing under Missouri Routes P and A, it gains the flow of its southern tributary Crider Creek, and enters Osage County about 1.5 mile before it joins the Gasconade at Cooper Hill.[3]

Third Creek was named for the fact it is the third in order of tributaries on the Gasconade River from the nearby Missouri River.[4]
