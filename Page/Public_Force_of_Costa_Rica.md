The PUBLIC FORCE of Costa Rica is the country’s law enforcement force, which performs policing and border patrol functions.[1]


History

On December 1, 1948, President José Figueres Ferrer of Costa Rica abolished the MILITARY OF COSTA RICA after victory in the civil war that year.[2] In a ceremony in the _Cuartel Bellavista_, Figueres broke a wall with a mallet symbolizing an end to Costa Rica's military spirit.[3]

In 1949, the abolition of the military was introduced in Article 12 of the Costa Rican Constitution.[4] The budget previously dedicated to the military is now dedicated to security, education and culture. Costa Rica maintains Police Guard forces.

The museum _Museo Nacional de Costa Rica_ was placed in the _Cuartel Bellavista_ as a symbol of commitment to culture. In 1986, President Oscar Arias Sánchez declared December 1 as the _Día de la Abolición del Ejército_ (Military abolition day) with Law #8115. Unlike its neighbors, Costa Rica has not endured a civil war since 1948. Costa Rica maintains small forces capable of law enforcement, but has no permanent standing army.

Public Force of the Ministry of Public Security (1996)

In 1996, the Ministry of Public Security established the _Fuerza Pública_ or Public Force, a gendarmarie which reorganized and eliminated the Civil Guard, Rural Assistance Guard, and Frontier Guards as separate entities. They are now under the Ministry and operate on a geographic command basis performing ground security, law enforcement, counter-narcotics, border patrol, and tourism security functions.

Outside the _Fuerza Pública_, there is a small Special Forces Unit, the Unidad Especial de Intervencion (UEI) or Special Intervention Unit, an elite commando force which trains with special forces from around the world, but is not part of the main police forces. Instead it is part of the Intelligence and Security Directorate (DIS) which reports directly to the Minister of the Presidency. About 70 members strong, it is organized along military lines, although officially a civilian police unit.

Its motto is "God, Fatherland, and Honor." Commissioner of Police Juan José Andrade Morales serves as its current Commissioner General.
