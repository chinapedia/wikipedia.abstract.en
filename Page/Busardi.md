BUSARDI is a Thai semi-couture fashion brand founded in 2009 by Busardi Muntarbhorn and her son, Tuck Muntarbhorn.[1] Busardi is Thailandâ€™s first brand to show at Paris Haute Couture Week.[2]

The brand stems from a familial tradition that can be traced back to Yoswadee Boon-Long, creator of Yoswadee, a long-standing fashion house that dressed the royal family, glamorous Thai aristocrats,[3] and women in the government during the 1950s and 1960s.[4]

In January 2015, Busardi made its debut in Paris haute couture with its Spring-Summer 2015 collection.[5][6]

The brand is known for its use of guipure lace and fine Thai craftsmanship, and for romantic designs that fall between haute couture and ready-to-wear clothing.[7]
