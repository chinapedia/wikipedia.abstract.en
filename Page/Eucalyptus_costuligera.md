Description

_Eucalyptus costuligera_ is a tree that typically grows to a height of and has persistent pale grey, fibrous or flaky "box"-type bark on the trunk and branches. The adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same grey-green or bluish colour on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide on a channelled or flattened petiole up to long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of up to seven on a branched or unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature flower buds are club-shaped, about long and wide with faint ribs along the sides. The operculum is hemispherical, about half as long as the floral cup. The flowers are a white-cream colour and the fruit is a woody cylindrical, cup-shaped or pear-shaped capsule long and wide with fine ribs along the sides and the valves enclosed below the rim.[1][2][3]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus costuligera_ was first formally described in 2000 by Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill from a specimen collected from the Derby-Gibb River Road, on the road to Wyndham.[4][5] The specific epithet (_costuligera_) is derived from the Latin word _costa_ meaning "rib" or "side" [6] with the diminutive suffix _uli_,[7] and _-gera_ meaning "to bear", "to carry" or "to perform",[8] hence "bearing fine ribs", referring to the fruit.[9]


Distribution and habitat

This eucalypt has a limited range but is abundant in a small area in the central Kimberley region of Western Australia, growing in savannah woodland in sandy to loamy soils over laterite.[10][11]


Conservation status

This species is classified as is classified as "Priority One" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife[12] meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.[13]
