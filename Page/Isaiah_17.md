Parashot

The _parashah_ sections listed here are based on the Aleppo Codex.[2] Isaiah 17 is a part of the _Prophecies about the Nations (Isaiah 13‚Äì23)_. {P}: open _parashah_; {S}: closed _parashah_.

    {P} 17:1-3 {P} 17:4-8 {S} 17:9-11 {S} 17:12-14 {P}


Verse 1

    ''The burden of Damascus.

        ''Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city,

            _and it shall be a ruinous heap_.[3]


Verse 2

    _The cities of Aroer are forsaken_ [4]

In the Septuagint, the wording is _abandoned for ever_, referring to Damascus (from verse 1), not Aroer in Moab.[5] Anglican Bishop Robert Lowth preferred to use the Septuagint translation: "What has Aroer ... on the river Arnon, (see ) to do with Damascus?‚Äù [6] Hugo Grotius, however, thought the Hebrew text was correct, and that this Aroer was a tract of ground in Syria.[7]
