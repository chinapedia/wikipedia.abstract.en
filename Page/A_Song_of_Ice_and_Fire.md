_A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE_ is a series of epic fantasy novels by the American novelist and screenwriter George R. R. Martin. He began the first volume of the series, _A Game of Thrones,_ in 1991, and it was published in 1996. Martin, who initially envisioned the series as a trilogy, has published five out of a planned seven volumes. The fifth and most recent volume of the series, _A Dance with Dragons_, was published in 2011 and took Martin six years to write. He is currently writing the sixth novel, _The Winds of Winter_.

_A Song of Ice and Fire_ takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos. The point of view of each chapter in the story is a limited perspective of a range of characters growing from nine in the first novel, to 31 characters by the fifth novel. Three main stories interweave: a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural Others in northernmost Westeros, and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the deposed king's exiled daughter, to assume the Iron Throne.

Martin's inspirations included the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels _The Accursed Kings_ by Maurice Druon.[1][2] _A Song of Ice and Fire_ received praise for its diverse portrayal of women and religion, as well as its realism. An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader, and the success or survival of point of view characters is never assured. Within the often morally ambiguous world of _A Song of Ice and Fire_, questions concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety, and the morality of violence frequently arise.

The books have sold 90 million copies worldwide ,[3] after having been translated into 47 languages .[4][5] The fourth and fifth volumes reached the top of _The New York Times_ Best Seller lists upon their releases.[6] Among the many derived works are several prequel novellas, a TV series, a comic book adaptation, and several card, board, and video games.


Plot synopsis

_A Song of Ice and Fire_ takes place in a fictional world in which seasons last for years and end unpredictably. Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel, the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united under the Targaryen dynasty by Aegon I and his sister-wives Visenya and Rhaenys, establishing military supremacy through their control of dragons. Aegon became the first king of the entire continent of Westeros, save for the southerly region of Dorne. The Targaryen dynasty ruled for three hundred years, although civil war and infighting among the Targaryens resulted in the death of all their dragons. At the beginning of _A Game of Thrones_, 15 peaceful years have passed since the rebellion led by Lord Robert Baratheon that deposed and killed the last Targaryen king, Aerys II "the Mad King", and proclaimed Robert king of the Seven Kingdoms, with a nine-year-long summer coming to an end.

The principal story chronicles the power struggle for the Iron Throne among the great Houses of Westeros following the death of King Robert in _A Game of Thrones_. Robert's heir apparent, the 13-year-old Joffrey, is immediately proclaimed king through the machinations of his mother, Queen Cersei Lannister. When Lord Eddard "Ned" Stark, Robert's closest friend and chief advisor, discovers that Joffrey and his siblings are the product of incest between Cersei and her twin brother Ser Jaime "The Kingslayer" Lannister, Eddard attempts to unseat Joffrey, but is betrayed and executed for treason. In response, Robert's brothers Stannis and Renly both lay separate claims to the throne. During this period of instability, two of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros attempt to become independent from the Iron Throne: Eddard's eldest son Robb is proclaimed King in the North, while Lord Balon Greyjoy desires to recover the sovereignty of his region, the Iron Islands. The so-called "War of the Five Kings" is in full progress by the middle of the second book, _A Clash of Kings_.

The second part of the story takes place in the far north of Westeros, where an 8,000-year-old wall of ice, simply called "the Wall", defends the Seven Kingdoms from supernatural creatures known as the Others. The Wall's sentinels, the Sworn Brotherhood of the Night's Watch, also protect the realm from the incursions of the "wildlings" or "Free Folk", who are several human tribes living on the north side of the Wall. The Night's Watch story is told primarily through the point of view of Jon Snow, Lord Eddard Stark's bastard son.[7] Jon follows the footsteps of his uncle Benjen Stark and joins the Watch at a young age, rising quickly through the ranks. He eventually becomes Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. In the third volume, _A Storm of Swords_, the Night's Watch storyline becomes increasingly entangled with the War of the Five Kings.

The third storyline follows Daenerys Targaryen, daughter of Aerys II, the last Targaryen king. On the continent of Essos, east of Westeros across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys is married off by her elder brother Viserys Targaryen to a powerful warlord, but slowly becomes an independent and intelligent ruler in her own right. Her rise to power is aided by the historic birth of three dragons, hatched from eggs given to her as wedding gifts. The three dragons soon become not only a symbol of her bloodline and her legitimate claim to the throne, but also devastating weapons of war, which help her in conquest of the Slaver's Bay.

First three novels (1991–2000)

George_R.R._Martin_at_Archipelacon.jpg at Archipelacon in Mariehamn, 2015.]] George R. R. Martin was already a successful fantasy and sci-fi author and TV writer before writing his _A Song of Ice and Fire_ book series.[27] Martin had published his first short story in 1971 and his first novel in 1977.[28] By the mid-1990s, he had won three Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and other awards for his short fiction.[29] Although his early books were well-received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s.[30] He worked principally on the revival of _The Twilight Zone_ throughout 1986 and on _Beauty and the Beast_ until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made[31] and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes.[32] This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising the size of his imagination.[33] Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.[34]

When Martin was between Hollywood projects in the summer of 1991, he started writing a new science fiction novel called _Avalon_. After three chapters, he had a vivid idea of a boy seeing a man's beheading and finding direwolves in the snow, which would eventually become the first non-prologue chapter of _A Game of Thrones_.[35] Putting _Avalon_ aside, Martin finished this chapter in a few days and grew certain that it was part of a longer story.[36] After a few more chapters, Martin perceived his new book as a fantasy story[37] and started making maps and genealogies.[38] However, the writing of this book was interrupted for a few years when Martin returned to Hollywood to produce his TV series _Doorways_ that ABC had ordered but ultimately never aired.[39]

In 1994, Martin gave his agent, Kirby McCauley, the first 200 pages and a two-page story projection as part of a planned trilogy with the novels _A Dance with Dragons_ and _The Winds of Winter_ intended to follow. When Martin had still not reached the novel's end at 1400 manuscript pages, he felt that the series needed to be four and eventually six books long,[40][41] which he imagined as two linked trilogies of one long story.[42] Martin chose _A Song of Ice and Fire_ as the overall series title: Martin saw the struggle of the cold Others and the fiery dragons as one possible meaning for "Ice and Fire", whereas the word "song" had previously appeared in Martin's book titles _A Song for Lya_ and _Songs the Dead Men Sing_, stemming from his obsessions with songs.[43] Martin also named Robert Frost's 1920 poem "Fire and Ice" and cultural associations such as passion versus betrayal as possible influences for the series' title.[44]

The revised finished manuscript for _A Game of Thrones_ was 1088 pages long (without the appendices),[45] with the publication following in August 1996.[46] _Wheel of Time_ author Robert Jordan had written a short endorsement for the cover that was influential in ensuring the book's and hence series' early success with fantasy readers.[47] _Blood of the Dragon_, a pre-release sample novella drawn from Daenerys's chapters, went on to win the 1997 Hugo Award for Best Novella.[48]

The 300 pages removed from the _A Game of Thrones_ manuscript served as the opening of the second book, entitled _A Clash of Kings_.[49] It was released in February 1999 in the United States,[50] with a manuscript length (without appendices) of 1184 pages.[51] _A Clash of Kings_ was the first book of the _A Song of Ice and Fire_ series to make the best-seller lists,[52] reaching 13 on _The New York Times_ Best Seller list in 1999.[53] After the success of _The Lord of the Rings_ films, Martin received his first inquiries to the rights of the _A Song of Ice and Fire_ series from various producers and filmmakers.[54]

Martin was several months late turning in the third book, _A Storm of Swords_.[55] The last chapter he had written was about the "Red Wedding", a pivotal scene notable for its violence (see Themes: Violence and death).[56] _A Storm of Swords_ was 1521 pages in manuscript (without appendices),[57] causing problems for many of Martin's publishers around the world. Bantam Books published _A Storm of Swords_ in a single volume in the United States in November 2000,[58] whereas some other-language editions were divided into two, three, or even four volumes.[59] _A Storm of Swords_ debuted at number 12 in the _New York Times_ bestseller list.[60][61]

Bridging the timeline gap (2000–2011)

After _A Game of Thrones_, _A Clash of Kings_, and _A Storm of Swords_, Martin originally intended to write three more books.[62] The fourth book, tentatively titled _A Dance with Dragons_, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts.[63] Martin wanted to set this story five years after _A Storm of Swords_ so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger.[64] Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than _A Storm of Swords_, Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to _A Clash of Kings_.[65] A long prologue was to establish what had happened in the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.[66]

In 2001, Martin was still optimistic that the fourth installment might be released in the last quarter of 2002.[67] However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. On one hand, Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to have nothing happen for five years.[68] After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book, which he called _A Feast for Crows_.[69] The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap.[70] The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands.[71] These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions complicated the plot for Martin.[72]

The manuscript length of _A Feast for Crows_ eventually surpassed _A Storm of Swords_.[73] Martin was reluctant to make the necessary deep cuts to get the book down to publishable length, as that would have compromised the story he had in mind. Printing the book in "microtype on onion skin paper and giving each reader a magnifying glass" was also not an option for him.[74] On the other hand, Martin rejected the publishers' idea of splitting the narrative chronologically into _A Feast for Crows_, Parts One and Two.[75] Being already late with the book, Martin had not even started writing all characters' stories[76] and also objected to ending the first book without any resolution for its many viewpoint characters as in previous books.[77]

With the characters spread out across the world,[78] a friend suggested that Martin divide the story geographically into two volumes, of which _A Feast for Crows_ would be the first.[79] This approach would give Martin the room to complete his commenced story arcs as he had originally intended,[80] which he still felt was the best approach years later.[81] Martin moved the unfinished characters' stories set in the east (Essos) and north (Winterfell and the Wall) into the next book, _A Dance with Dragons_,[82] and left _A Feast for Crows_ to cover the events in King's Landing, the Riverlands, Dorne, and the Iron Islands.[83] Both books begin immediately after the end of _A Storm of Swords_,[84] running in parallel instead of sequentially, and involve different casts of characters with only little overlap.[85] Martin split Arya's chapters into both books after having already moved the three other most popular characters (Jon Snow, Tyrion, and Daenerys) into _A Dance with Dragons_.[86]

Upon its release in October 2005 in the UK[87] and November 2005 in the US,[88] _A Feast for Crows_ went straight to the top of _The New York Times_ bestseller list.[89] Among the positive reviewers was Lev Grossman of _Time_, who dubbed Martin "the American Tolkien".[90] However, fans and critics alike were disappointed with the story split that left the fates of several popular characters unresolved after _A Storm of Swords_{{'}} cliffhanger ending.[91][92] With _A Dance with Dragons_ said to be half-finished,[93] Martin mentioned in the epilogue of _A Feast for Crows_ that the next volume would be released by the next year.[94] However, planned release dates were repeatedly pushed back. Meanwhile, HBO acquired the rights to turn _A Song of Ice and Fire_ into a dramatic series in 2007[95] and aired the first of ten episodes covering _A Game of Thrones_ in April 2011.[96]

With around 1600 pages in manuscript length,[97] _A Dance with Dragons_ was eventually published in July 2011 after six years of writing,[98] longer in page count and writing time than any of the preceding four novels.[99][100] The story of _A Dance with Dragons_ catches up with and goes beyond _A Feast for Crows_ around two-thirds into the book,[101] but nevertheless covers less story than Martin had intended, omitting at least one planned large battle sequence and leaving several character threads ending in cliff-hangers.[102] Martin attributed the delay mainly to his untangling "the Meereenese knot", which the interviewer understood as "making the chronology and characters mesh up as various threads converged on [Daenerys]".[103] Martin also acknowledged spending too much time on rewriting and perfecting the story, but soundly rejected the theories of some of his critics that he had lost interest in the series or would bide his time to make more money.[104]

Planned novels and future

Martin believes the last two volumes of the series will be big books of 1500 manuscript pages each.[105] The sixth book will be called _The Winds of Winter_,[106] taking the title of the last book of the originally planned trilogy.[107] Displeased with the provisional title _A Time for Wolves_ for the final volume, Martin ultimately announced _A Dream of Spring_ as the title for the seventh book in 2006.[108] Martin said in March 2012 that the final two novels will take readers farther north than any of the previous books, and that the Others will appear in the book.[109]

_The Winds of Winter_

_The Winds of Winter_ will resolve the cliffhangers from _A Dance with Dragons_ early on and "will open with the two big battles that [the fifth book] was building up to, the battle in the ice and the battle [...] of Slaver's Bay. And then take it from there."[110] By the middle of 2010, Martin had already finished five chapters of _The Winds of Winter_ from the viewpoints of Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Arianne Martell, and Aeron Greyjoy, coming to around 100 completed pages.[111][112] After the publication of _A Dance with Dragons_ in 2011, Martin announced he would return to writing in January 2012.[113] He spent the meantime on book tours, conventions, and continued working on his _The World of Ice & Fire_ companion guide and a new _Tales of Dunk and Egg_ novella.[114][115] In December 2011, Martin posted a chapter from _The Winds of Winter_ from the viewpoint of Theon Greyjoy;[116] several other chapters have been made public since. Four hundred pages of the sixth novel had been written , although Martin considered only 200 as "really finished"; the rest needed revising.[117] During the Guadalajara International Book Fair in Mexico in early December 2016, Martin offered the following hint as to the tone of this book: "There are a lot of dark chapters right now ... I've been telling you for 20 years that winter was coming. Winter is the time when things die, and cold and ice and darkness fill the world, so this is not going to be the happy feel-good that people may be hoping for. Some of the characters [are] in very dark places."[118] Martin did not intend to separate the characters geographically again.[119]

In 2011, Martin gave three years as a realistic estimate for finishing the sixth book at a good pace,[120] but said ultimately the book "will be done when it's done",[121] acknowledging that his publication estimates had been too optimistic in the past.[122] In 2015 there were indications that the book would be published before the sixth season of the HBO show[123][124][125][126][127][128] but in early January 2016 Martin confirmed that he had not met an end-of-year deadline that he had established with his publisher for release of the book before the sixth season. He also revealed there had been a previous deadline of October 2015 that he had considered achievable in May 2015, and that in September 2015 he had still considered the end-of-year deadline achievable. He further confirmed that some of the plot of the book might be revealed in the upcoming season of _Game of Thrones_.[129] In February 2016, Martin stated that he dropped all his editing projects except for _Wild Cards_, and that he would not be writing any teleplays, screenplays, short stories, introductions or forewords before delivering _The Winds of Winter_.[130] In April 2018, Martin announced in a blog post that _The Winds of Winter_ would not be published in 2018.[131]

_A Dream of Spring_

Martin is only firm about ending the series with the seventh novel "until I decide not to be firm".[132] With his stated goal of telling the story from beginning to end, he will not truncate the story to fit into an arbitrary number of volumes.[133] He knows the ending in broad strokes as well as the future of the main characters,[134] and will finish the series with bittersweet elements where not everyone will live happily ever after.[135] Martin hopes to write an ending similar to _The Lord of the Rings_ that he felt gave the story a satisfying depth and resonance. On the other hand, Martin noted the challenge to avoid a situation like the finale of the TV series _Lost_, which left some fans disappointed by deviating too far from their own theories and desires.[136] In 2012, Martin had acknowledged his concerns about _A Dream of Spring_ not being completed by the time the TV series _Game of Thrones_ catches up in its storyline to the novels.[137] In 2015, Martin said that he was not writing _A Dream of Spring_ together with _The Winds of Winter_,[138] and in early 2016, he said he did not believe _A Dream of Spring_ would be published before the last season of the HBO show.[139] In April 2018, Martin commented he had not started working on the book,[140] and in November he said that after _The Winds of Winter_ he would decide what to do next: _A Dream of Spring_ or the second volume of _Fire & Blood_ or one or two stories for the _Tales of Dunk and Egg_.[141] In May 2019 he reiterated he had not started writing _A Dream of Spring_ and would not do so before finishing _The Winds of Winter_.[142]

Martin offered the following hint as to how the series would conclude during a Q&A at the Guadalajara International Book Fair. "I'm not going to tell you how I'm going to end my book, but I suspect the overall flavor is going to be as much bittersweet as it is happy."[143]

TV series and other writings

Early during the development of the TV series, Martin told major plot points to producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.[144] Martin was confident he would have published at least _The Winds of Winter_ before the TV series overtook him.[145] Nevertheless, there were general concerns about whether Martin would be able to stay ahead of the show.[146] As a result, head writers Benioff and Weiss learned more future plot points from Martin in 2013 to help them set up the show's new possible seasons. This included the end stories for all the core characters. Deviations from the books' storylines were considered, but a two-year hiatus to wait for new books was not an option for them (as the child actors continue to grow and the show's popularity would wane).[147] Martin indicated he would not permit another writer to finish the book series.[148] On January 2, 2016, Martin confirmed that the sixth volume would not be published before the start of the sixth season of the HBO series.[149]

Regarding _A Song of Ice and Fire_ as his Masterpiece, Martin is certain never to write anything on this scale again and would only return to this fictional universe in the context of stand-alone novels.[150] He prefers to write stories about characters from other _A Song of Ice and Fire_ periods of history such as his _Tales of Dunk and Egg_ project, instead of continuing the series directly.[151][152] Martin said he would love to return to writing short stories, novellas, novelettes, and stand-alone novels from diverse genres such as science fiction, horror, fantasy, or even a murder mystery.[153][154]


Inspiration and writing

Genre

George R. R. Martin believes the most profound influences to be the ones experienced in childhood.[155] Having read H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, Robert A. Heinlein, Eric Frank Russell, Andre Norton,[156] Isaac Asimov,[157] Fritz Leiber, and Mervyn Peake[158] in his youth, Martin never categorized these authors' literature into science fiction, fantasy, or horror and will write from any genre as a result.[159] Martin classified _A Song of Ice and Fire_ as "epic fantasy",[160] and specifically named Tad Williams' high fantasy epic _Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn_ as very influential for the writing of the series.[161][162] One of his favorite authors is Jack Vance,[163] although Martin considered the series not particularly Vancean.[164]

Martin experienced some harsh winters when living in Dubuque a few years in the 70s, and suspects these winters had an influence on his writing; "I think a lot of the stuff in A Game of Thrones, the snow and ice and freezing, comes from my memories of Dubuque".[165]

The medieval setting has been the traditional background for epic fantasy. However, where historical fiction leaves versed readers knowing the historical outcome,[166] original characters may increase suspense and empathy for the readers.[167] Yet Martin felt historical fiction, particularly when set during the Middle Ages, had an excitement, grittiness, and a realness to it that was absent in fantasy with a similar backdrop.[168] Thus, he wanted to combine the realism of historical fiction with the magic appeal of the best fantasies,[169] subduing magic in favor of battles and political intrigue.[170] He also decided to avoid the conventional good versus evil setting typical for the genre, using the fight between Achilles and Hector in Homer's _Iliad_, where no one stands out as either a hero or a villain, as an example of what he wants to achieve with his books.[171]

Martin is widely credited with broadening the fantasy fiction genre for adult content, including incest, paedophilia, and adultery.[172] Writing for _The Atlantic_, Amber Taylor assessed the novels as hard fantasy with vulnerable characters to which readers become emotionally attached.[173] CNN found in 2000 that Martin's mature descriptions were "far more frank than those found in the works of other fantasy authors",[174] although Martin assessed the fantasy genre to have become rougher-edged a decade later and that some writers' work was going beyond the mature themes of his novels.[175] Adam Roberts called Martin's series the most successful and popular example of the emerging subgenre of grimdark fantasy.[176]

Writing process

Setting out to write something on an epic scale,[177] Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages in the very early stages of the series.[178] His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time.[179] In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later.[180] However, with _A Song of Ice and Fire_ series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing,[181] he still has two more books to write . Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write.[182] , Martin was still typing his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software.[183] He begins each day at 10 am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work,[184] and may write all day or struggle to write anything.[185] Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time.[186] Martin does not consider _A Song of Ice and Fire_ a "series" but a single story published in several volumes.[187]

Martin set the _A Song of Ice and Fire_ story in a secondary world inspired by Tolkien's writing.[188] Unlike Tolkien, who created entire languages, mythologies, and histories for Middle-earth long before writing _The Lord of the Rings_, Martin usually starts with a rough sketch of an imaginary world that he improvises into a workable fictional setting along the way.[189] He described his writing as coming from a subconscious level in "almost a daydreaming process",[190] and his stories, which have a mythic rather than a scientific core, draw from emotion instead of rationality.[191] Martin employs maps[192] and a cast list topping 60 pages in the fourth volume,[193] but keeps most information in his mind.[194] His imagined backstory remains subject to change until published, and only the novels count as canon.[195] Martin does not intend to publish his private notes after the series is finished.[196]

Martin drew much inspiration from actual history for the series,[197] having several bookcases filled with medieval history for research[198] and visiting historic European landmarks.[199] For an American who speaks only English, the history of England proved the easiest source of medieval history for him, giving the series a British rather than a German or Spanish historic flavor.[200] For example, Ned and Robb Stark resemble Richard, 3rd Duke of York, and his son Edward IV, and Queen Cersei resembles both Margaret of Anjou[201] and Elizabeth Woodville.[202] Martin immersed himself in many diverse medieval topics such as clothing, food, feasting, and tournaments to have the facts at hand if needed during writing.[203] The series was in particular influenced by the Hundred Years' War, the Crusades, the Albigensian Crusade, and the Wars of the Roses,[204][205] although Martin refrained from making any direct adaptations.[206] Martin was also inspired by the French historical novels _The Accursed Kings_ by Maurice Druon, which are about the French monarchy in the 13th and 14th centuries.[207][208]

The story is written to follow principal landmarks with an ultimate destination, but leaves Martin room for improvisation. On occasion, improvised details significantly affected the planned story.[209] By the fourth book, Martin kept more private notes than ever before to keep track of the many subplots,[210] which became so detailed and sprawling by the fifth book as to be unwieldy.[211] Martin's editors, copy editors, and readers monitor for accidental mistakes,[212] although some errors have slipped into publication. For instance, Martin has inconsistently referred to certain characters' eye colors, and has described a horse as being of one sex and then another.[213]

: Number of chapters per point-of-view character

The books are divided into chapters, each one narrated in the third person limited through the eyes of a point of view character,[214] an approach Martin learned himself as a young journalism student.[215] Beginning with nine POV characters in _A Game of Thrones_, the number of POV characters grows to a total of 31 in _A Dance with Dragons_ (see table). The short-lived one-time POV characters are mostly restricted to the prologues and epilogues.[216] David Orr of _The New York Times_ noted the story importance of "the Starks (good guys), the Targaryens (at least one good guy, or girl), the Lannisters (conniving), the Greyjoys (mostly conniving), the Baratheons (mixed bag), the Tyrells (unclear), and the Martells (ditto), most of whom are feverishly endeavoring to advance their ambitions and ruin their enemies, preferably unto death".[217] However, as _Time_{{'s}} Lev Grossman noted, readers "experience the struggle for Westeros from all sides at once", such that "every fight is both triumph and tragedy [...] and everybody is both hero and villain at the same time".[218]

Modeled on _The Lord of the Rings_, the story of _A Song of Ice and Fire_ begins with a tight focus on a small group (with everyone in Winterfell, except Daenerys) and then splits into separate stories. The storylines are to converge again, but finding the turning point in this complex series has been difficult for Martin and has slowed down his writing. Depending on the interview, Martin is said to have reached the turning point in _A Dance with Dragons_,[219] or to not quite have reached it yet in the books.[220] The series' structure of multiple POVs and interwoven storylines was inspired by _Wild Cards_, a multi-authored shared universe book series edited by Martin since 1985.[221] As the sole author, Martin begins each new book with an outline of the chapter order and may write a few successive chapters from a single character's viewpoint instead of working chronologically. The chapters are later rearranged to optimize character intercutting, chronology, and suspense.[222]

Influenced by his television and film scripting background, Martin tries to keep readers engrossed by ending each _A Song of Ice and Fire_ chapter with a tense or revelational moment, a twist or a cliffhanger, similar to a TV act break.[223] Scriptwriting has also taught him the technique of "cutting out the fat and leaving the muscle", which is the final stage of completing a book, a technique that brought the page count in _A Dance with Dragons_ down almost eighty pages.[224] Dividing the continuous _A Song of Ice and Fire_ story into books is much harder for Martin. Each book shall represent a phase of the journey that ends in closure for most characters. A smaller portion of characters is left with clear-cut cliffhangers to make sure readers come back for the next installment, although _A Dance with Dragons_ had more cliffhangers than Martin originally intended.[225][226] Both one-time and regular POV characters are designed to have full character arcs ending in tragedy or triumph,[227] and are written to hold the readers' interest and not be skipped in reading.[228] Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not rely on the hero to come through unscathed and will instead feel the character's fear with each page turn.[229]

The unresolved larger narrative arc encourages speculation about future story events.[230] According to Martin, much of the key to _A Song of Ice and Fire_{{'s}} future lies over a dozen years in the fictional past, of which each volume reveals more.[231] Events planned from the beginning are foreshadowed, although Martin is careful not to make the story predictable.[232] The viewpoint characters, who serve as unreliable narrators,[233] may clarify or provide different perspectives on past events.[234] Therefore, what the readers believe to be true may not necessarily be true.[235]

Character development

Regarding the characters as the heart of the story,[236] Martin planned the epic _A Song of Ice and Fire_ to have a large cast of characters and many different settings from the beginning.[237] _A Feast for Crows_ has a 63-page list of characters,[238] with many of the thousands of characters mentioned only in passing[239] or disappearing from view for long stretches.[240] When Martin adds a new family to the ever-growing number of genealogies in the appendices, he devises a secret about the personality or fate of the family members. However, their backstory remains subject to change until written down in the story.[241] Martin drew most character inspiration from history (without directly translating historical figures)[242] and his own experiences, but also from the manners of his friends, acquaintances, and people of public interest.[243] Martin aims to "make my characters real and to make them human, characters who have good and bad, noble and selfish well-mixed in their natures".[244] Jeff VanderMeer of the _Los Angeles Times_ remarked that "Martin's devotion to fully inhabiting his characters, for better or worse, creates the unstoppable momentum in his novels and contains an implied criticism of Tolkien's moral simplicity"[245] (see Themes: Moral ambiguity).

Martin deliberately ignored the writing rule of never giving two characters names starting with the same letter.[246] Instead, character names reflect the naming systems in various European family histories, where particular names were associated with specific royal houses and where even the secondary families assigned the same names repeatedly.[247] The story of _A Song of Ice and Fire_ therefore has children called "Robert" in honor of King Robert of House Baratheon, a "Brandon" in every other generation of the Starks in commemoration of Brandon the Builder (of the Wall), and the syllable "Ty" commonly occurring in given names of House Lannister.[248] Confident that readers would pay attention, Martin distinguished people sharing a given name[249] by adding numbers or locations to their given names (e.g. Henry V of England). The family names were designed in association with ethnic groups (see backstory): the First Men in the North of Westeros had very simply descriptive names like Stark and Strong, whereas the descendants of the Andal invaders in the South have more elaborate, undescriptive house names like Lannister or Arryn, and the Targaryens and Valyrians from the Eastern continent have the most exotic names with the letter Y.[250]

All characters are designed to speak with their own internal voices to capture their views of the world.[251] _The Atlantic_ pondered whether Martin ultimately intended the readers to sympathize with characters on both sides of the Lannister–Stark feud long before plot developments force them to make their emotional choices.[252] Contrary to most conventional epic fantasies, the characters of _A Song of Ice and Fire_ are vulnerable so that, according to _The Atlantic_, the reader "cannot be sure that good shall triumph, which makes those instances where it does all the more exulting."[253] Martin gets emotionally involved in the characters' lives during writing, which makes the chapters with dreadful events sometimes very difficult to write.[254] Seeing the world through the characters' eyes requires a certain amount of empathy with them, including the villains,[255] all of whom he has said he loves as if they were his own children.[256][257] Martin found that some characters had minds of their own and took his writing in different directions. He returns to the intended story if it does not work out, but these detours sometimes prove more rewarding for him.[258]

Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen generate the most feedback from readers.[259] Martin has stated that Tyrion is his personal favorite, as the grayest of the gray characters, with his cunning and wit making him the most fun to write.[260] Martin has also said that Bran Stark is the hardest character to write. As the character most deeply involved in magic, Bran's story needs to be handled carefully within the supernatural aspects of the books. Bran is also the youngest viewpoint character,[261] and has to deal with the series' adult themes like grief, loneliness, and anger.[262] Martin set out to have the young characters grow up faster between chapters, but, as it was implausible for a character to take two months to respond, a finished book represents very little time passed. Martin hoped the planned five-year break would ease the situation and age the children to almost adults in terms of the Seven Kingdoms, but he later dropped the five-year gap (see section Bridging the timeline gap).[263][264]


Themes

Although modern fantasy may often embrace strangeness, _A Song of Ice and Fire_ series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism.[265] Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre,[266] Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters.[267] Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies.[268] In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension,[269] not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells.[270] As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.[271]

Since Martin drew on historical sources to build the world of _A Song of Ice and Fire_ ,[272] Damien G. Walter of _The Guardian_ saw a strong resemblance between Westeros and England in the period of the Wars of the Roses.[273] _The Atlantic_{{'s}} Adam Serwer regarded _A Song of Ice and Fire_ as "more a story of politics than one of heroism, a story about humanity wrestling with its baser obsessions than fulfilling its glorious potential", where the emergent power struggle stems from the feudal system's repression and not from the fight between good and evil.[274] Martin not only wanted to reflect the frictions of the medieval class structures in the novels, but also explore the consequences of the leaders' decisions, as general goodness does not automatically make competent leaders and vice versa.[275]

A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil,[276] which Martin rejects for not mirroring the real world.[277] Attracted to gray characters,[278] Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about.[279] Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the _A Song of Ice and Fire_ series.[280] The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.[281][282]

Although fantasy comes from an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest necessity to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people.[283] Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might.[284] The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war.[285] The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact.[286] Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.[287]

According to Martin, the fantasy genre rarely focuses on sex and sexuality,[288] instead often treating sexuality in a juvenile way or neglecting it completely.[289] Martin, however, considers sexuality an important driving force in human life that should not be excluded from the narrative.[290] Providing sensory detail for an immersive experience is more important than plot advancement for Martin,[291] who aims to let the readers experience the novels' sex scenes, "whether it's a great transcendent, exciting, mind blowing sex, or whether it's disturbing, twisted, dark sex, or disappointing perfunctory sex."[292] Martin was fascinated by medieval contrasts where knights venerated their ladies with poems and wore their favors in tournaments while their armies mindlessly raped women in wartime.[293] The non-existent concept of adolescence in the Middle Ages served as a model for Daenerys' sexual activity at the age of 13 in the books.[294] The novels also allude to the incestuous practices in the Ptolemaic dynasty of Ancient Egypt to keep their bloodlines pure.[295]

Martin provides a variety of female characters to explore the place of women in a patriarchal society.[296] Writing all characters as human beings with the same basic needs, dreams, and influences,[297] his female characters are to cover the same wide spectrum of human traits as the males.[298][299]


Reception

Critical response

_Science Fiction Weekly_ stated in 2000 that "few would dispute that Martin's most monumental achievement to date has been the groundbreaking _A Song of Ice and Fire_ historical fantasy series",[300] for which reviews have been "orders of magnitude better" than for his previous works, as Martin described to _The New Yorker_.[301] In 2007, _Weird Tales_ magazine described the series as a "superb fantasy saga" that "raised Martin to a whole new level of success".[302] Shortly before the release of _A Dance with Dragons_ in 2011, Bill Sheehan of _The Washington Post_ was sure that "no work of fantasy has generated such anticipation since Harry Potter's final duel with Voldemort",[303] and Ethan Sacks of _Daily News_ saw the series turning Martin into a darling of literary critics as well as mainstream readers, which was "rare for a fantasy genre that's often dismissed as garbage not fit to line the bottom of a dragon's cage".[304] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard stated:_Publishers Weekly_ noted in 2000 that "Martin may not rival Tolkien or Robert Jordan, but he ranks with such accomplished medievalists of fantasy as Poul Anderson and Gordon Dickson."[305] After the fourth volume came out in 2005, _Time_{{'s}} Lev Grossman considered Martin a "major force for evolution in fantasy" and proclaimed him "the American Tolkien", explaining that, although Martin was "[not] the best known of America's straight-up fantasy writers" at the time and would "never win a Pulitzer or a National Book Award ... his skill as a crafter of narrative exceeds that of almost any literary novelist writing today".[306] As Grossman said in 2011, the phrase _American Tolkien_ "has stuck to [Martin], as it was meant to",[307] being picked up by the media including _The New York Times_ ("He's much better than that"),[308] the _New Yorker_,[309] _Entertainment Weekly_ ("an acclaim that borders on fantasy blasphemy"),[310] _The Globe and Mail_,[311] and _USA Today_.[312] _Time_ magazine named Martin one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011,[313] and _USA Today_ named George R.R. Martin their Author of the Year 2011.[314]

According to _The Globe and Mail_{{'s}} John Barber, Martin manages simultaneously to master and transcend the genre so that "Critics applaud the depth of his characterizations and lack of cliché in books that are nonetheless replete with dwarves and dragons".[315] _Publishers Weekly_ gave favorable reviews to the first three _A Song of Ice and Fire_ novels at their points of release, saying that _A Game of Thrones_ had "superbly developed characters, accomplished prose and sheer bloody-mindedness",[316] that _A Clash of Kings_ was "notable particularly for the lived-in quality of [their fictional world and] for the comparatively modest role of magic",[317] and that _A Storm of Swords_ was one "of the more rewarding examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy".[318] However, they found that _A Feast For Crows_ as the fourth installment "sorely misses its other half. The slim pickings here are tasty, but in no way satisfying."[319] Their review for _A Dance with Dragons_ repeated points of criticism for the fourth volume, and said that, although "The new volume has a similar feel to _Feast_", "Martin keeps it fresh by focusing on popular characters [who were] notably absent from the previous book."[320]

According to the _Los Angeles Times_, "Martin's brilliance in evoking atmosphere through description is an enduring hallmark of his fiction, the settings much more than just props on a painted stage", and the novels captivate readers with "complex storylines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing, and the willingness to kill off even his major characters".[321] CNN remarked that "the story weaves through differing points of view in a skillful mix of observation, narration and well-crafted dialogue that illuminates both character and plot with fascinating style",[322] and David Orr of _The New York Times_ found that "All of his hundreds of characters have grace notes of history and personality that advance a plot line. Every town has an elaborately recalled series of triumphs and troubles."[323] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard "couldn't stop reading Martin because my desire to know what was going to happen combined with my absolute inability to guess what would happen and left me helpless before his sorcery. At the end, I felt shaken and exhausted."[324] _The Christian Science Monitor_ advised reading the novels with an _A Song of Ice and Fire_ encyclopedia at hand to "catch all the layered, subtle hints and details that [Martin] leaves throughout his books. If you pay attention, you will be rewarded and questions will be answered."[325]

Among the most critical voices were Sam Jordison and Michael Hann, both of _The Guardian_. Jordison detailed his misgivings about _A Game of Thrones_ in a 2009 review and summarized "It's daft. It's unsophisticated. It's cartoonish. And yet, I couldn't stop reading .... Archaic absurdity aside, Martin's writing is excellent. His dialogue is snappy and frequently funny. His descriptive prose is immediate and atmospheric, especially when it comes to building a sense of deliciously dark foreboding [of the long impending winter]."[326] Hann did not consider the novels to stand out from the general fantasy genre, despite Martin's alterations to fantasy convention, although he rediscovered his childhood's views:

Sales

ASOIAF_2011_NYT_Bestseller_List.png

The reported overall sales figures of the _A Song of Ice and Fire_ series vary. _The New Yorker_ said in April 2011 (before the publication of _A Dance with Dragons_) that more than 15 million _A Song of Ice and Fire_ books had been sold worldwide,[327] a figure repeated by _The Globe and Mail_ in July 2011.[328] Reuters reported in September 2013 that the books including print, digital and audio versions have sold more than 24 million copies in North America.[329] _The Wall Street Journal_ reported more than six million sold copies in North America by May 2011.[330] _USA Today_ reported 8.5 million copies in print and digital overall in July 2011,[331] and over 12 million sold copies in print in December 2011.[332] The series has been translated into more than 20 languages;[333] _USA Today_ reported the fifth book to be translated into over 40 languages.[334] _Forbes_ estimated that Martin was the 12th highest-earning author worldwide in 2011 at $15 million.[335]

Martin's publishers initially expected _A Game of Thrones_ to be a best-seller,[336] but the first installment did not even reach any lower positions in bestseller list.[337] This left Martin unsurprised, as it is "a fool's game to think anything is going to be successful or to count on it".[338] However, the book slowly won the passionate advocacy of independent booksellers and the book's popularity grew by word of mouth.[339] The series' popularity skyrocketed in subsequent volumes,[340] with the second and third volume making _The New York Times_ Best Seller lists in 1999[341] and 2000,[342] respectively. The series gained Martin's old writings new attention, and Martin's American publisher Bantam Spectra was to reprint his out-of-print solo novels.[343]

The fourth installment, _A Feast for Crows_, was an immediate best-seller at its 2005 release,[344] hitting number one on "The New York Times" hardcover fiction bestseller list November 27, 2005, which for a fantasy novel suggested that Martin's books were attracting mainstream readers.[345] The paperback edition of _A Game of Thrones_ reached its 34th printing in 2010, surpassing the one million mark.[346] Before it even premiered, the TV series had boosted sales of the book series, with _A Song of Ice and Fire_ approaching triple-digit growth in year-on-year sales. Bantam was looking forward to seeing the tie-ins boost sales further,[347] and Martin's British publisher Harper Voyager expected readers to rediscover their other epic fantasy literature.[348] With a reported 4.5 million copies of the first four volumes in print in early 2011,[349] the four volumes re-appeared on the paperback fiction bestseller lists in the second quarter of 2011.[350][351]

At its point of publication in July 2011, _A Dance with Dragons_ was in its sixth print with more than 650,000 hardbacks in print.[352] It also had the highest single and first-day sales of any new fiction title published in 2011 at that point, with 170,000 hardcovers, 110,000 e-books, and 18,000 audio books reportedly sold on the first day.[353] _A Dance with Dragons_ reached the top of _The New York Times_ bestseller list on July 31, 2011.[354] Unlike most other big titles, the fifth volume sold more physical than digital copies early on,[355] but nevertheless, Martin became the tenth author to sell 1 million Amazon Kindle e-books.[356] All five volumes and the four-volume boxed set were among the top 100 best-selling books in the United States in 2011 and 2012.[357]

The TV series has contributed significantly boosting sales of both the books and collectibles like box-sets, merchandise, and other items. The TV series also contributed in increasing the geographic coverage of the books, introducing new customers in emerging countries like India and Brazil to the book series. All this has significantly increased the overall book sales. As of April 2019, the book series has sold 90million copies worldwide.[358]

Fandom

During the 1980s and early 1990s, Martin's novels had slowly earned him a reputation in science fiction circles,[359] although he said to only have received a few fans' letters a year in the pre-internet days.[360] The publication of _A Game of Thrones_ caused Martin's following to grow, with fan sites springing up and a Trekkie-like society of followers evolving that meet regularly.[361] Westeros.org, one of the main _A Song of Ice and Fire_ fansites with about seventeen thousand registered members , was co-founded in 1999 by a Swedish-based fan of Cuban-American descent, Elio M. García, Jr., and Linda Antonsson, who introduced him to the series; their involvement with Martin's work has now become semi-professional.[362][363] The Brotherhood Without Banners, an unofficial fan club operating globally, was formed in 2001. Their founders and other longtime members are among Martin's good friends.[364]

Martin runs an official website[365] and administers a lively blog with the assistance of Ty Franck.[366] He also interacts with fandom by answering emails and letters, although he stated in 2005 that their sheer numbers might leave them unanswered for years.[367] Since there are different types of conventions nowadays, he tends to go to three or four science-fiction conventions a year simply to go back to his roots and meet friends.[368] He does not read message boards anymore, so that his writing will not be influenced by fans foreseeing twists and interpreting characters differently from what he intended.[369]

While Martin calls the majority of his fans "great", and enjoys interacting with them,[370] some of them turned against him because of the six years it took to release _A Dance with Dragons_.[371] A movement of disaffected fans called GRRuMblers formed in 2009, creating sites such as _Finish the Book, George_ and _Is Winter Coming?_[372][373] When fans' vocal impatience for _A Dance with Dragons_ peaked shortly after, Martin issued a statement called "To My Detractors"[374] on his blog that received media attention.[375][376][377] _The New York Times_ noted that it was not uncommon for Martin to be mobbed at book signings either.[378] _The New Yorker_ called this "an astonishing amount of effort to devote to denouncing the author of books one professes to love. Few contemporary authors can claim to have inspired such passion."[379]

Derived works

Novellas

Martin has written several prequel novellas. The _Tales of Dunk and Egg_ series, three novellas set 90 years before the events of the novel series, feature the adventures of Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire "Egg", who later became King Aegon V Targaryen. The stories have no direct connection to the plot of _A Song of Ice and Fire_, although both characters are mentioned in _A Storm of Swords_ and _A Feast For Crows_, respectively. The first installment, _The Hedge Knight_, was published in the 1998 anthology _Legends_. _The Sworn Sword_ followed in 2003, published in _Legends II_.[394] Both were later adapted into graphic novels.[395] The third novella, _The Mystery Knight_, was first published in the 2010 anthology _Warriors_[396] and is planned to be adapted as a graphic novel, as well.[397] In 2015, the first three novellas were published as one illustrated collection, _A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms_.

The novella _The Princess and the Queen or, the Blacks and the Greens_ appeared in Tor Books's 2013 anthology _Dangerous Women_ and explains some of the Targaryen backstory two centuries before the events of the novels.[398][399] _The Rogue Prince, or, the King's Brother_, published in the 2014 anthology _Rogues_, is itself a prequel to the events of _The Princess and the Queen_.[400] The novella _The Sons of the Dragon_, published in the 2017 anthology _The Book of Swords_, is the story of Aegon the Conqueror's two sons Aenys I and Maegor I "The Cruel". All three of these stories were incorporated as parts of _Fire and Blood,_ a book chronicling the history of the Targaryen line.

Chapter sets from the novels were also compiled into three novellas that were released between 1996 and 2003 by _Asimov's Science Fiction_ and _Dragon_:

-   _Blood of the Dragon_ (July 1996),[401] taken from the Daenerys chapters in _A Game of Thrones_
-   _Path of the Dragon_ (December 2000),[402] taken from the Daenerys chapters in _A Storm of Swords_
-   _Arms of the Kraken_ (March 2003),[403] based on the Iron Islands chapters from _A Feast for Crows_

_Fire & Blood_

_Fire & Blood_ is Martin's complete history of House Targaryen, to be released in two volumes. The first volume was released on November 20, 2018.[404]

TV series

With the popularity of the series growing, HBO optioned _A Song of Ice and Fire_ for a television adaptation in 2007.[405] A pilot episode was produced in late 2009, and a series commitment for nine further episodes was made in March 2010.[406] The series, titled _Game of Thrones_, premiered in April 2011 to great acclaim and ratings (see _Game of Thrones_: Reception). The network picked up the show for a second season covering _A Clash of Kings_ two days later.[407] Shortly after the conclusion of the first season, the show received 13 Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series, winning Outstanding Main Title Design and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for Peter Dinklage's portrayal of Tyrion Lannister.[408] HBO announced a renewal for a third season in April 2012, ten days after the season 2 premiere.[409] Due to the length of the corresponding book, the third season only covered roughly the first half of _A Storm of Swords_.[410]

Shortly after the season 3 premiere in March 2013, the network announced that _Game of Thrones_ would be returning for a fourth season, which would cover the second half of ''A Storm of Swords ''along with the beginnings of ''A Feast for Crows ''and _A Dance With Dragons_.[411] _Game of Thrones_ was nominated for 15 Emmy Awards for season 3.[412] Two days after the fourth season premiered in April 2014, HBO renewed _Game of Thrones_ for a fifth and sixth season.

Season 5 premiered on April 12, 2015 and set a Guinness World Records for winning the highest number of Emmy Awards for a series in a single season and year, winning 12 out of 24 nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series.[413][414] These episodes were watched by 8 million viewers, setting a record number for the series.[415] The sixth season premiered on April 24, 2016.[416] These episodes received the most nominations for the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards with 23, winning 12, including the award for Outstanding Drama Series.[417] The seventh season premiered on July 16, 2017. The eighth and final season premiered on April 14, 2019.[418]
