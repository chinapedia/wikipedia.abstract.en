CHANDANARAJA (r. c. 890-917 CE) was an Indian king belonging to the Shakambhari Chahamana dynasty. He ruled parts of present-day Rajasthan in north-western India.

Chandana-raja succeeded his father Guvaka II as the Chahamana king. He is also known as Vappayaraja and Manika Rai.

According to the Harsha stone inscription, Chandana defeated a Tomara ruler named Rudra (or Rudrena). Dasharatha Sharma identifies this ruler with a king of Delhi's Tomara dynasty. Historian R. B. Singh theorizes that Rudra was another name of the Tomara ruler Chandrapala or Bibasapala.

The _Prithviraja Vijaya_ states that Chandana's queen Rudrani was also known as "Atma-Prabha" because of her yogic powers. She is said to have set up 1,000 lamp-like lingams on the banks of the Pushkar lake.
