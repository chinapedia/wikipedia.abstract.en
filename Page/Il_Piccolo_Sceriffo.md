History and profile

A western series featuring a teenage hero, it debuted on June 10, 1948 and got an immediate success.[1] In 1951 Gianna Arguissola replaced Torelli as writer.[2] Each issue was a self-contained episode of an unfolding story which recounted the adventures of the young orphan Kit Hodgkin, who after having captured the murderers of his sheriff father is acclaimed new sheriff.[3][4][5]

In 1959, inspired by the success of _Intrepido_, the publication adopted a similar pocket format, changed its name in _Il Nuovo Sceriffo_ ("The New Sheriff") and became a proper comic magazine presenting several additional adventure series, while the main series was renamed _Kid lo sceriffo_ ("Kid The Sheriff").[6][7] In 1962 the magazine changed its name in _Il Nuovo Sceriffo presenta Radar_, and in 1963 it eventually split in two magazines, _Radar_ and _Sceriffo Gigante_, with only the latter continuing to publish _Piccolo Sceriffo_ series.[8]

During the years the comic book series was republished several times under different titles, including _Albo dello Sceriffo_, _Raccolta del Piccolo Sceriffo_, _Racconti dello Sceriffo_ and _Sceriffo Kit_.[9]
