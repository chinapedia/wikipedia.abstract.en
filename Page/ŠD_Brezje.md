History

ŠD Brezje was founded in 2011, when the club started competing in the Slovenian second division.[1] In their second season, the team gets promoted to the elite Slovenian Futsal League.[2] After finishing in third place in the 2014–15 season, the team won the league title in the 2015–16 season, defeating FC Litija 3–1 in series in the final.[3][4] The club, competing under the name _PROEN Maribor_ due to sponsorship reasons, has also won the Slovenian Cup in the same season.[5][6]

In the 2016–17 season, ŠD Brezje debuted in the international competitions as the club competed in the 2016–17 UEFA Futsal Cup, where they reached the elite round after winning the Group G of the preliminary round and finishing in the second place in Group 1 of the main round.[7] The team has won the Slovenian Cup trophy for the second time in a row during the 2016–17 season, defeating Bronx Škofije 6–2 in the final on 5 March 2017. The team has also defended the national title, again defeating Litija 3–1 in the final.[8][9] In the 2017–18 UEFA Futsal Cup, Brezje started in the main round of the competition, where the team was eliminated with three defeats out of three games.[10] In the same season, Brezje failed to retain the national championship as the team finished the season in third place.[11]
