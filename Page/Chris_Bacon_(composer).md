CHRISTIAN PAUL BACON (born March 17, 1977) is an American composer. His film scores include _Alpha and Omega_ (2010), _Source Code_ (2011), and _Gnomeo & Juliet_ (2011). He was the composer for all 50 episodes of the A&E drama series _Bates Motel_, for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award, and also composed the music for 26 of the 32 episodes of the NBC musical drama series _Smash_.


Early life

Bacon was born on March 17, 1977 in Provo, Utah. As a youth he learned to play piano and saxophone, and from an early age he knew he wanted to be a film composer. He has said, "From the point that I could start thinking about what I wanted to do when I grew up... it was always to write movie music."[1]

After graduating from high school, Bacon attended Brigham Young University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in music composition. He then moved to Los Angeles to attend USC's film scoring program, which led to an apprenticeship with renowned film composer James Newton Howard.[2]

Bacon cites his internship with Howard as his most valuable musical training, "While I learned a ton from school, my real-world education came under James. It felt like I was on scholarship because I was being paid to learn what it means to be a film composer at the pinnacle of the industry. James gave me my first opportunities on projects that he couldnâ€™t fully take on for a variety of reasons, and his endorsement was very comforting to producers who appreciated the work still being performed under his 'umbrella'."[3]


Career

Bacon's solo debut as a film composer came with the 2007 Lifetime film _Angels Fall_, for which he composed the main theme. Bacon's first solo feature film score was the thriller _Source Code_.[4]

Bacon has also contributed music to many film and TV productions, including _American Hustle_, _Avengers: Age of Ultron_, and _Goosebumps_. Bacon's next project is the Amazon reboot of _The Tick_, directed by Wally Pfister.[5]

Bacon has been nominated for two Emmy Awards: one for his work on the NBC series _Smash_, and the other for is work on the A&E series _Bates Motel_.[6]


Personal life

Bacon and his wife Melia currently live in Los Angeles with their three children.
