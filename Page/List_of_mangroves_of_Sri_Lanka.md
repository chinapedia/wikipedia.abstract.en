Mangrove

MANGROVES are shrubs or small trees that normally grow in varied regions of tropical and subtropical coastal waters, where saline water and freshwater normally meets. The zone is typically known as brackish water. Mangroves are halophytes, which adapted to harsh coastal life conditions. They contain a complex salt filtration system and complex root system to cope with salt water immersion and wave action. They are adapted to the low oxygen (anoxic) conditions of waterlogged mud.[1]

The mangrove ecosystem or commonly mangal, is found at the river mouths bordering lagoons, estuaries, or on sheltered shores.[2] Some of the most common adaptations of mangroves are as follows:

-   They have prop roots which emerge from branches and stilt roots which emerge from the stem. Both roots help to anchor the plant and to filer salt.
-   Some roots known as pneumatophores grow upwards from the soil. They have numerous apertures through which exchange of gases takes place. Some species have knee roots that perform the function.
-   All mangroves show the germination process called vivipary. Because of the unfavorable conditions, hypocotyl of the seed grows, while it is still attaches to the parent plant. When it is released, it either gets stuck in the mud or floats upright before it settles down.
-   Mangrove plants show xeromorphic characters such as highly cutinized epidermis, extensive water storage tissues, and presence of salt-excreting glands.

Mangroves swamps possess numerous ecological functions. Mangroves tend to accumulate sediment. Fine particles trapped in the root systems become permanently deposited. They are also very productive communities with an aquatic productivity and litter fall. Most of the plant material gradually decays and enriches the adjacent waters through detritus food chains. Therefore mangrove ecosystems is called energy-subsidized ecosystem. They serve as nursery grounds to many marine fish and crustaceans. Mangrove timber is valuable since it contains tannins and is resistant to insect attacks. Mangrove clams and oysters are a source of lime and food, as well as fish and crustaceans.[3]

Sri Lanka is an island, which serves a great diversity of lagoons, and estuaries. This enhances a well developed mangrove ecosystem throughout the belt of costal area.[4] About 28 species of true mangroves and 18 mangrove associates have been recorded and many of them are shrubs, shorter than 10m.[5][6] Most of the mangroves of Sri Lanka belongs to family Rhizophoraceae and Avicenniaceae. Mangrove associates are largely belongs to family Acanthaceae.[7][8]
