"BRAHMGIANI" or "THE BRAHM GIANI" is term derived from Sikhism, used to define a highly enlightened individualâ€“ being one with Waheguru. In the Sikhism religion, such a person has also been named a Gurmukh, Sadhu or Sant. Other derivations of Brahmgiani have come from one possessing the knowledge of Brahman. [1]


Etymology and usage

The idea of Brahmgiani in the Sikhism religion depicts the universal soul in theistic terms as the supreme of the universe which is, as it were, the visible form. The term is explained in sublime poetry from Guru Arjan, and Guru Nanak, in his Sukhmani. [2][3][4][5]
