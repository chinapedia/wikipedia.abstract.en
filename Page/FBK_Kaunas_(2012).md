History

Unhappy with the boards decision to close the club, the supporters decided to form a new club in 2012. Futbolo Bendruomenes Klubas Kaunas. F.B.K. Kaunas. They are not the legally successor of FBK Kaunas and is not playing on their license as of 2016, but they are considered to be the spiritual successor of the old club.

F.B.K. Kaunas started the 2012 season in the 4th tier. It was a huge success as Kaunas managed to get a 2nd place and by that gain promotion to the 2013 II Lyga. The 2013 season ended in a 6th-place finish and in the 2014 season F.B.K. Kaunas managed to win the II Lyga, therefore gaining promotion to the second tier of Lithuanian football. The 2015 season in I Lyga ended in a 12th place which was acceptable taking in mind that the club had a midtable budget. The 2016 season was a massive blow to the club as F.B.K.
