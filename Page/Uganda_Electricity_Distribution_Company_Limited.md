The UGANDA ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION COMPANY LIMITED (UEDCL) is a parastatal company whose primary purpose is to distribute electric power to domestic and commercial end-users in Uganda, at and below 33 kilovolts.[1] This role was sub-leased to Umeme for a 20-year concession that ends in 2025.[2]


Location

The headquarters of UEGCL are on the sixth floor of UEDCL Towers, 37 Nakasero Road, Nakasero Hill, in Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city.[3] The coordinates of the company headquarters are 0°19'35.0"N, 32°34'38.0"E (Latitude:0.326390; Longitude:32.577222).[4]


History

UEDCL was established in 2001 by an act of the Ugandan parliament following the break-up of the Uganda Electricity Board. In 2005, Umeme took over the majority of assets and responsibilities of UEDCL for a period of 20 years on a concessionary basis.[5][6]

In 2018, the Natural Resources Committee of the Ugandan Parliament weighed the benefits and consequences of terminating that concession earlier than 2025. The committee was informed by Joseph Katera, the UEDCL managing director, that the government needed to invest at least US$100 million on an annual basis, to maintain on-going operations. Another US$330 million break-up fee would be due to Umeme at the time of premature termination.[7]


Operations

During the period of the concession to Umeme, UEDCL has the following operations:[8][9] (a) Monitor Umeme's adherence to the terms of the concession (b) Maintain and operate the off-grid power networks in Moyo, Adjumani, and Moroto (c) Supervise the completion of the grid-expansion projects that were under construction by the Rural Electrification Network, a sister government agency, at the time the Umeme concession was initialized (d) Maintain, operate, and manage the electric pole treatment plant at Lugogo in Central Kampala.[10][11]


Governance

UEDCL is governed by a seven-person board of directors whose chairman is Francis Tumuheirwe. The managing director is Joseph Katera.[12]
