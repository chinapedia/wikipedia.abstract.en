HOY (from Norse _Háey_ meaning "high island") is an island in Orkney, Scotland, measuring — ranked largest in the archipelago after Mainland. A natural causeway, _the Ayre_, links to much smaller South Walls; the two islands are treated as one entity by the UK census.[1][2]


Description

The dramatic coastline of Hoy greets visitors travelling to Orkney by ferry from the Scottish mainland. It has extremes of many kinds: some of the highest sea cliffs in the UK at St John's Head, which reach ;[3]; a light-stone precarious sea stack taller than the facing cliff – the Old Man of Hoy; patches of northernmost scattered, hardy woodland and the remote possibility of locally extant Orkney charr (_Salvelinus inframundus_) documented in 1908 at Heldale Water.[4] The two most northerly Martello Towers stand here, built to defend the south entrance to Scapa Flow at Longhope in 1814 towards the end of the Napoleonic War; they have never been used in combat.

The highest point in the archipelago, Ward Hill, is on Hoy.

The main naval base for the British fleet in both the First and Second World Wars, Scapa Flow, was at Lyness in the southeast of the island. Some rather incongruous Art Deco structures nearby date from this period. The Arts and Crafts architect William Lethaby rebuilt Melsetter house for mountaineer Thomas Middlemore at the end of the nineteenth century leaving untouched the adjacent barn which is probably mid-18th century.[5][6]

Dwarfie_Stane,_Hoy_-_geograph.org.uk_-_71967.jpg An unusual rock-cut tomb, the Dwarfie Stane, lies in the Rackwick valley towards the north. It is unique in northern Europe, bearing similarity to Neolithic or Bronze Age tombs around the Mediterranean. The tomb has a small rectangular entrance and cleft, hence its name.

Orkney Ferries traverse the west of Scapa Flow with two routes:

-   Lyness on Hoy and Longhope on associated Walls via small Flotta to/from the village of Houton on Orkney Mainland.
-   Moaness in Hoy via small Graemsay to/from the town of Stromness on Orkney Mainland.

Hoy is part of the Hoy and West Mainland National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland.[7]


Mythology

In Norse mythology, Hoy hosted Hjaðningavíg, the never-ending battle between Heðin and Högni.


Wildlife

Hoy is an Important Bird Area.[8][9] The northern part of the island is an RSPB reserve due to its importance for birdlife, particularly great skuas and red-throated divers. It was sold to the RSPB by the Hoy Trust for a nominal amount.[10] _Anastrepta orcadensis_, a liverwort also known as Orkney Notchwort, was first discovered on Ward Hill by William Jackson Hooker in 1808.[11][12]

The northern and western parts of Hoy, along with much of the adjoining sea area, is designated as a Special Protection Area[13] due to its importance for nine breeding bird species: arctic skua, fulmar, great black-backed gull, great skua, guillemot, Black-legged kittiwake, peregrine falcon, puffin and red-throated diver.[14] The area is important for its seabird assemblage, which regularly supports 120,000 individual seabirds during the breeding season.[15]


In popular culture

Hoy is featured prominently in the 1984 video for "Here Comes The Rain Again" by Eurythmics.
