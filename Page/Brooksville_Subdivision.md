The line runs from Sulphur Springs, Florida north to a point just north of Brooksville, a distance of 49.1 miles. At it's south end it connects with the Clearwater Subdivision, which continues south into Tampa, where CSX's Yeoman Yard is located. The Brooksville Subdivision notably serves a Florida Crushed Stone Company facility in Brooksville along with a Cemex facility.[1][2][3]


History

The Brooksville Subdivision is today the northern section of what was originally the Tampa Northern Railroad. The line was completed in 1908 and was bought by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1912.[4] Seaboard would extend the line north from Brooksville to Inverness and Archer connecting with its line there. Though that extension would be abandoned in the 1980s.[5]
