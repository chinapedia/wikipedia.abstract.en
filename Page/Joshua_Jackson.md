Josh Jackson}}

JOSHUA BROWNING JACKSON (born June 11, 1978[1]) is an American-Canadian actor. He is known for his starring role as Pacey Witter in the teen drama series _Dawson's Creek_ (1998–2003), Peter Bishop in the science fiction series _Fringe_ (2008–2013), Cole Lockhart in the drama series _The Affair_ (2014–18), and Mickey Joseph in the drama miniseries _When They See Us_ (2019).

Jackson's best known films include _The Mighty Ducks_ film series (1992–96), _Cruel Intentions_ (1999), _The Skulls_ (2000), and _Shutter_ (2008). For his performance in the Canadian independent film _One Week_ (2008), Jackson won the Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role.


Early life

Jackson was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to parents John Carter and Fiona Jackson.[2] His mother is a casting director.[3] Jackson's father is from Texas;[4] and his mother is a native of Ballyfermot, Dublin, Ireland, having immigrated to North America in the late 1960s.[5][6] He has a younger sister, Aisleagh, and two older half brothers, Jonathan and Lyman.[7] He was raised Catholic.[8][9]

Jackson grew up in California until the age of 8. He moved to Vancouver with his mother and younger sister. He attended Ideal Mini School and later switched to Kitsilano Secondary School. In an interview with _The New York Times_, Jackson said he was kicked out of high school once because of _The Jon Stewart Show_: "[The show] played, at least where I grew up, at 1:30 in the morning, so I would stay up at night to watch Jon Stewart, but then I'd be too tired—or too lazy—to go to school in the morning. So I'd just take the first couple of classes off, 'cause I wanted to be fresh when I got there."[10] He claims that the first time was because of "attitude" problems and that he "wasn't in the school spirit".


Career

Jackson started acting in a small role in the film _Crooked Hearts_ in 1991. The next year, he played the role of Charlie in a musical version of _Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory_. At this point, with the help of the play's casting director Laura Kennedy, he joined the William Morris Agency.[11] Soon after, he landed the role of Charlie (#96) in _The Mighty Ducks_ series, playing a young and aspiring hockey player.

Joshua Jackson went on to appear as Pacey Witter on _Dawson's Creek_, which ran on the WB network from 1998–2003, and also starred James Van Der Beek, Michelle Williams and Katie Holmes. While the show was on hiatus, he appeared in several movies including _Cruel Intentions_ (a New York yuppie adaptation of _Les Liaisons dangereuses_ that also starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe), _The Skulls_, _The Safety of Objects_, _The Laramie Project_ and a short cameo in the remake of _Ocean's Eleven_ in which he appears as himself in a poker scene with Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Holly Marie Combs, among others. In 2000, he also guest-starred in Season 12 of _The Simpsons_, voicing the character of Jesse Grass, a "hunky environmentalist" and love interest for Lisa Simpson in the episode "Lisa the Tree Hugger".[12]

Shortly after _Dawson's Creek_ ended in 2003, Jackson played the lead role in films alongside Dennis Hopper (_Americano_), Harvey Keitel (_Shadows in the Sun_), and Donald Sutherland (_Aurora Borealis_). In 2005, Jackson moved to the UK and made his stage debut on the London West End with Patrick Stewart in David Mamet's two-man play, _A Life in the Theatre_. The play was a critical and popular success, and ran from February to April of that year. Jackson said that he would consider returning to the stage, to try his hand on Broadway. His next film role was in _Bobby_, directed by Emilio Estevez, Jackson's co-star from _The Mighty Ducks_. He played a lead role in _Shutter_, a US remake of a Thai horror film of the same name. He starred and acted as executive producer in the Canadian independent film _One Week_, which opened on March 6, 2009.[13][14]

From 2008 to 2013, Jackson played the lead role of Peter Bishop in the science-fiction series _Fringe_,[15] created by JJ Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman.[16] The series appeared on the Fox TV network and was the second-highest rated new show of the 2008–2009 season after CBS's _The Mentalist_. BuddyTV ranked him #9 on its "TV's 100 Sexiest Men of 2010" list,[17] #19 in 2011[18] and #14 in 2012.[19]

Jackson was nominated for Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for the film _One Week_.[20] He won the award on April 12, 2010.[21] He held and hosted Pacey-Con in 2010, directly across the street from the San Diego Comic-Con, sporting a bowling shirt and giving out fan fiction he wrote himself to those waiting in the Comic-Con entrance line. Footage of the event was recorded for a video, entitled 'Pacey-Con', which he was filming for Will Ferrell's Funny or Die celebrity humor website. In 2013 Jackson appeared in the IFC film _Inescapable_ with Marisa Tomei and Alexander Siddig.[22] Jackson wrote the first story from the comic book trilogy _Beyond the Fringe_, titled "Peter and the Machine".[23] Jackson currently stars in the fourth season of the successful Showtime television show, _The Affair_, where he plays Cole Lockhart, the protagonist husband of the unfaithful Alison Lockhart.

In March 2018, Jackson makes a theatrical debut in Broadway, _Children of a Lesser God_, where he plays James Leeds, an unconventional teacher at school for the deaf who got in a conflicted professional and romantic relationship with a former deaf student, Sarah Norman (Lauren Ridloff). The play ran through May 2018.[24]

In 2019, Jackson starred as defense attorney Mickey Joseph in the Netflix drama miniseries _When They See Us_.[25]

In May 2019, Jackson joined the cast of Hulu's miniseries _Little Fires Everywhere_ based off the book by Celeste Ng.[26]


Personal life

Jackson was in a relationship with _Dawson's Creek_ co-star Katie Holmes during the first two seasons of the show's run. Holmes claims Jackson was her first love.[27]

Jackson began dating German actress Diane Kruger in 2006; the couple shared residences in Paris, Los Angeles and Vancouver.[28] Jackson and Kruger ended their relationship in 2016, after 10 years together.[29] He owns his childhood home in Topanga, California.[30] He previously lived in Wilmington, North Carolina, where _Dawson's Creek_ was filmed; and in New York, where _Fringe_ filmed its first season. In 2009, he moved back to Vancouver for the shooting of the four following seasons before the show aired its last episode on January 18, 2013.

Jackson is a fan of the Vancouver Canucks ice hockey team.[31] He was arrested on November 9, 2002, at a Carolina Hurricanes ice hockey game in Raleigh, North Carolina, after a quarrel with a security guard. He was charged with assault, affray and being intoxicated and disruptive, having a 0.14 blood alcohol content.[32] Prosecutors agreed to dismiss the assault charge, and Jackson agreed to attend an alcohol education program and perform 24 hours of community service in order to have the remaining charge dropped.[33]
