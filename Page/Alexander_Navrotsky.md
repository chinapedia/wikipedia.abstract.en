ALEXANDER ALEXANDRROVICH NAVROTSKY (, 13 March 1839 – 10 June 1914) was a Russian writer, poet and playwright, known also under his pen name N. A. VROTSKY. His best-known poem, "The Stenka Razin Cliff" (Утёс Стеньки Разина), set to music by himself, became popular among Russian revolutionaries in the late 19th-early 20th century and is now considered part of Russian musical folklore.[1]


Biography

Navrotsky was born in Saint Petersburg to a noble Russian family based in Moscow Governorate. After graduating from the Second St. Petersburg Cadet Corps, he joined the Moscow Guard Regiment, but was forced to retire in 1867 due to serious head injury he received in Poland in 1863 while taking part in the suppression of the January Uprising. After graduating the Military Law Academy in Petersburg, he went on to serve as a deputy military procurator of Moscow, then returned to Saint Petersburg to start a career of a successful military lawyer.[2]

In 1869 Navrotsky debuted as novelist with _Semeistvo Tarskikh_ (Семейство Тарских, The Tarsky Family). It was dismissed by the contemporary critics as 'empty and preposterous',[3] but made him known in the literary circles. Navrotsky started to contribute regularly to the liberal _Vestnik Evropy_. He joined the Military History Society, then started to attend the literary salons of Anna Filosofova and Sofya Tolstaya, became friends with Nikolai Leskov and Fyodor Dostoyevsky, visited Leo Tolstoy at his Yasnaya Polyana estate.[4] In 1879 Navrotsky launched his own magazine _Russkaya Retch_ where he published some of his major work, including the historical dramas in verse _The Last Rus_, as well as _The Conversion of Lithuania_ and _Jesuits in Lithuania_. A conservative Slavophile,[5] Navrotsky's agenda as a publicist included the critique of nihilism, materialism, 'western Socialism', all kinds of radicalism, but also bureaucratic inefficiency, so as to highlight the role of the Tsar as a zealous reformer, eager to get as close as possible to his own people.[6]

Navrotsky's numerous poems were collected in several the books, including _Pictures of the Past_ (Картины минувшего, 1881), _Russian Land's Guiding Lights_ (Светочи Русской земли, 1896), _Tales of the Past. Russian Bylinas and Legends in Verse_ (books 1–3, 1896), _Down the Volga River. The Volga Bylinas and Legends in Verse_ (1903). Among them was "The Stenka Razin Cliff" (Утёс Стеньки Разина), written in 1864 and first published in 1870. The poem which Navrotsky himself set to music (and published the score of in 1896) became hugely popular among Russian revolutionaries of the time, to become (according to Ieronim Yasinsky) the "Russian answer to La Marseillaise". Equally powerful impact had the dramatized chronicles _Stenka Razin_ (1871, dedicated to Nikolai Kostomarov whose 1858 book _The Uprising of Stenka Razin_ provided the source of inspiration) which a group of the tchaykovtsy published in Geneva in 1873 without the author's permission (and including the by now famous "Cliff", to serve as a life-affirming finale).[7] Gustaitis2.jpg

In the early 1870s Navrotsky took up the post of a military procurator of Vilno. While there, he developed a keen interest in the Lithuanian history and culture which resulted in two epic drama and numerous poems. _The Conversion of Lithuania_ (Крещение Литвы), written in 1874 and first published in 1879 in _Russkaya Retch_, featured in Volume 3 of the Works by A. Navrotsky (1900), but continued to be edited by the author and only in 1902 came out in its final version. By this time Navrotsky has written music for some of its episodes and the finale. The drama was translated into Lithuanian by the Catholic priest and poet Motiejus Gustaitis. With the translator's notes and the music score, it was published in 1927 in Kaunas. Another drama in verse, _Jesuits in Lithuania_ (Иезуиты в Литве, 1876), dealt with the strengthening of the Jesuits' power in the country during the reign of Stephen Báthory.[8]

In 1891, ranked Lieutenant general, Navrotsky retired. This decade saw the publication of the short stories collection _Waves of Life_ (Волны жизни, 1894) as well as two novels, _Under the Blows of Fate_ (Под ударами судьбы, 1898) and _To Each Their Own_ (Каждому своё, 1899). Navrotsky's most cherished genre was that of a historical drama in verse, his attitude remaining unwaveringly pro-monarchist. In 1903 he joined the right-wing Russian Assembly to become one of its most active members. Of Navrotsky's later work the most successful was the tragedy in verse _The Tsar Ioann III Vasilyevich_ which received a special diploma at the Pushkin Prize Award ceremony in 1901. It was followed by _Darya Osokina, the Merchant's Daughter_ (1904), _The Siege of Rostov_ (1906), _Turbulent Times_ (Лихолетье, 1910), _Artemy Petrovich Volynsky_ (1910). He continued to publish poems and essays, mainly in _Russky Vestnik_ (1903—1904), _Mirny Trud_ (1905, 1907) and _Svetoch_ (1910).

Alexander Navrotsky died in Saint Petesburg and is interred in the Novodevichye Cemetery.[9]
