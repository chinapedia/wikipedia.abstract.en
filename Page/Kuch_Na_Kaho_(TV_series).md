Noman (aina's ex-fiance) met aina and desired of marrying her, aina avoided noman since she was not able to start a normal life with anyone. Noman requested mohsin and sajal andboth of them wanted to get rid of aina convinced aina to marry noman. Aina in order to get rid of situation told about her affair to noman after knowing about aina's affair noman rejected aina. This filled mohsin and sajal with huge anger and both of them taunted and teased aina. Faraz on the other side decided to leave for America with sajal and maaz but kept this seceret. Aina on the other side was constantly taunted by mohsin and sajal. Faraz's unending care for aina as a younger sister raised sajal with doubting of affair between them which hurted both faraz and aina who eventually bumped onto tears and anger and became highly furious in the rain where she yelled at mohsin as well and claimed everyone as cruel people. The next morning Sajal apologized Faraz for doubting him while faraz told everyone that he is leaving for America along with family.

On the other side mohsin became worried as well and requested faraz not to go and asked about aina over this faraz offered mohsin to marry aina for the sake of his children. This shocked mohsin and he rejected stating that this is quite impossible for him as he never considered aina in his life. Faraz and Sajal tried to convince aina who reluctantly agreed over an agreement that faraz would not leave for America. This left mohsin with shock as he wondered about aina's agreement over his proposal but mohsin disagreed over proposal.

Meanwhile, imran and annie lived in devastating relationship which made realize imran that he couldn't forget Aina. Incidentally annie met aina in a mall and told her that imran has totally forgotten her and that he is happily married. Aina reacted firmly over this by stating she is living a happy life as well without imran and that she is going to marry soon, and that she will spit on Imran's face next time she'll meet him. Annie was shocked over it and told imran sarcastically who fiercely asked annie to leave his home. On other side aina intensively asked mohsin to marry her and that she will take good care of his children but mohsin disagreed and stated that he can't start a life with her as this is quite awkward for him, but deep inside mohsin still thought that his children wants a mother's affections. Later on the nanny nafeesa whom Mohsin hired to look after his children was kidnapping his daughter and Aina saved her so Mohsin agreed to get married to her. Imran managed to meet aina and asked for apology aina slapped imran claiming that he is coward. After their marriage Mohsin started thinking of her dead wife Nadia and thinks that he is doing wrong with her faraz tried to convince Mohsin that he should live a happy life with Aaina but Mohsin behaviour is rude with Aaina and he often humiliate aina for being a lazy wife and compares her to nadia. Aina tries hard to become a hardworking housewife and mother but mohsin is always unsatisfied and often loses his temper over her. He knows that not only the children need the support of Aina but he also needs as well as Aina also needs Mohsin. He doesn't want to scold her but he cannot control himself and scolds her everytime.

Meanwhile, Faraz and Sajal decide to go to America knowing that Aina told them not to go and that is why she married Mohsin but Faraz tries to explain Aina that Sajal wants to live in America and he doesn't want to upset her. After so much of pressure she agrees to let them go but she is not happy about it. Since they left Aina is always thinking about Maaz and couldn't concentrate on anything and also she doesn't talks to Mohsin. Faraz calls Mohsin and asks if everything is okay he says that he doesn't know what happened to Aina Faraz then says Mohsin to take care of her and don't repeat the same mistake of the behaviour he kept with Nadia and says that if something happens to Aina he won't forgive himself. Mohsin couldn't take the behaviour of Aina anymore so he told Aina that why is she running away from him and why doesn't she accept this marriage then Aina hugs him and tells him she couldn't live like this, her loneliness will kill her. After saying that she faints and then Zubaida comes and scolds Mohsin for not taking care of Aina she tells him to call the doctor and the doctor says her blood pressure is low. After that he was remembering the old Aina that how joyful she used to be and now whatever he says to her she doesn't says a word.

The next day Mohsin prepared breakfast for Aina and took her very nicely. Mohsin brought his twin children and told Aina that he don't want a child right now from her maybe later but not that time because he doesn't want Aina to take care of her child more than his children.

Then he got angry and started shouting at her and told her this is his house and whatever he says only that will happen and he doesn't wants to eat the food if it is made by the maid and said her what does she even do everyday. After that Ayna said that yeah I am not doing anything everyday angels are coming and taking care of the house and I am doing nothing and just sleeping she said that in anger and ran furiously down the stairs and then her foot slipped and then she fell down.
