TORII KIYOTSUNE (, ) was a Japanese artist of the Torii school of ukiyo-e art.

Kiyotsune's birth and death dates are unknown; his personal name was Daijirō, and is believed to have been son of the publisher Nakajimaya Isaemon (). Kiyotsune's work appeared from the end of the Hōreki era (1751–1764) to the end of the An'ei era (1772–1781), a time of great productivity from the Torii school. Kiyotsune produced _yakusha-e_ portraits of kabuki actors with rounded linework in a style established by Kiyonobu II and Kiyomasu II.
