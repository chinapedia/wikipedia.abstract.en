MX LINUX is a midweight Linux operating system based on Debian stable and using core antiX components, with additional software created or packaged by the MX community.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] It is developed as a cooperative venture between the antiX and former MEPIS communities, aiming to use the best tools and talents from each of these distributions. The community's stated goal is to "combine an elegant and efficient desktop with simple configuration, high stability, solid performance and medium-sized footprint".[12] MX Linux uses the Xfce desktop environment, while KDE and other environments can be added or are available as "spin-off" ISO images.


History

MX Linux began in a discussion about future options among members of the MEPIS community in December 2013.[13] Developers from antiX then joined them, bringing the ISO build system as well as the Live-USB/DVD technology. In order to be listed on DistroWatch, MX Linux was initially presented as a version of antiX. It received its own DistroWatch page as a separate distribution with the release of the first Public Beta of MX-16 on November 2, 2016.

The MX-14 series was based on Debian Stable "Wheezy" and used first Xfce 4.10 and then, with the 14.4 release, Xfce 4.12. The MX-14 versions were intended to fit onto a CD, a constraint that limited the applications that could be included. This series saw the gradual evolution of the MX Tools, a collection of handy utilities designed to help the user with a variety of common tasks that are often complicated and obscure.

MX-15 moved to the new Debian Stable "Jessie" using systemd-shim, meaning that systemd is installed but the default init is sysvinit.[14] The size limitation was lifted, enabling the developers to present the user with a full turnkey product. Substantial expansion of MX Tools occurred.

MX-16 was still based on Debian Stable "Jessie" but with many applications backported and added as well from other sources. Also had additions and refinements to MX Tools, import of advanced antiX developments, expanded support, and a completely new icon/theme/wallpaper combination.

MX-16.1 collected all bug fixes and improvements since MX-16 and added a new kingfisher theme, upgraded and streamlined MX Tools, revised documentation and new translations.

MX-17 changes its base to Debian 9 (Stretch), and brings upgraded artwork, new MX Tools, improved Live operation via antiX and many other changes detailed in the MX Blog.

MX-18 continues the development of MX Tools, introduces a very recent kernel, enables whole disk encryption, and adds grub themes and splash functionality through MX Boot options. New artwork and improved localization have been included. Details in the MX Blog.

Features

MX Linux has basic tools like an installer that handles UEFI computers, a GUI-based method to change a Linux kernel and core AntiX programs. But MX stands out from other distros by shipping a suite of user-oriented tools called MX Tools. Many of these Tools were developed specifically for MX, while some were forked from existing antiX apps or are existing antiX apps; a couple were imported with permission from outside sources.

For example, one of the most interesting is MX-SNAPSHOT, a GUI tool to remaster a live installation into a single .ISO file. This quickly and conveniently "cloned" image is bootable from disk or USB-thumbdrive while maintaining all settings. This way, an installation can be conveniently migrated or distributed to a new hard-disk or USB-thumbdrive requiring next to no administrative effort, since an advanced method of copying the file system (developed by antiX-linux) utilizing bind-mounts performs the "heavy lifting". The snapshot also serves as an essentially complete and convenient backup of the installation.
