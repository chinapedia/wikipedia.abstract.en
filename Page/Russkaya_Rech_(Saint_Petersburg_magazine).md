russkajaRech.jpg _RUSSKAYA RECH_ (, Russian Speech) was a Russian quarterly political and literary magazine published in Saint Petersburg in 1879–1882 by the poet, novelist and playwright Alexander Navrotsky, who was also its editor-in-chief.[1]

Among the authors who contributed to _Russkaya Rech_ regularly, were Alexander Gradovsky, Ivan Goncharov, Nikolai Danilevsky, Alexander Kruglov and Evgeny Markov. The Internal Politics section was run by Mikhail Rosenheim.[2] Navrotsky himself published in it some of his most ambitious works, including the historical dramas _Poslednyaya Rus_ (The Last Rus), _Kreshcheniye Litvy_ (The Conversion of Lithuania) and _Iezuity v Litve_ (Jesuits in Lithuania).

This enterprise proved financial catastrophe for Navrotsky who shut it down in 1882.[3]
