History

In 1596, it was named as a village, _Dayr Siryan_, in the Ottoman _nahiya_ (subdistrict) of Tibnin under the _liwa'_ (district) of Safad, with a population of 10 households and 1 bachelor, all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax-rate of 25 % on agricultural products, such as wheat, barley, olive trees, goats, beehives, in addition to "occasional revenues" and a press for olive oil or grape syrup; a total of 2,952 akçe.[2][3]

In the early 1860´s Ernest Renan found here remains of old buildings and a cistern.[4] In 1875 Victor Guérin found that the village had Metawileh inhabitants,[5] and noted: "Cisterns and tanks partly cut in the rock and partly built. Hewn stones show that here was an ancient village or edifice."[6]

In 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's _Survey of Western Palestine_ (SWP) described it as "a village, built of stone, containing about 200 Metawileh, situated on the plain and surrounded by small gardens and arable land. Water from wells and a spring."[7]
