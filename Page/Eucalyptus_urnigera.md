_EUCALYPTUS URNIGERA_, commonly known as the URN TREE or the URN-FRUITED GUM, is a eucalypt that is native to Tasmania.[1] It is an alpine white gum and is related to _E. gunnii_, _E. archeri_ and _E.morrisbyi_.


Description

_E. urnigera_ is an evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of , although specimens up to have been recorded in sheltered lower altitude positions. The spread of the tree is typically to .[2] The tree often has a gnarled appearance in exposed areas and has a lignotuber.[3] However, in more sheltered and lower altitude sites it grows tall and straight. This is very obvious on the road leading up to Lake Fenton in the Mount Field National Park. The bark is deciduous, peeling in flakes, the branches are smooth, grey, orange-tan to olive green over cream. Branchlets are often glaucous. As with most eucalypts juvenile leaves are distinct from adult leaves in both arrangement and shape. The juvenile leaves are opposite, sessile, orbate to elliptical, apex either rounded on mucronulate (with a small tip) and a crenulated (finely notched or scalloped) margin, long. The leaves range from being dark green (sheltered environment) to highly glaucous in exposed areas. Adult leaves are alternate, petiolate, narrow-lanceolate to ovate, dark green, glossy and coriaceous (leathery). They are typically long and wide. Lateral veins diverge at angles of 25-60 degrees.

The flowers contain three flowered umbels with peduncles (flower stalks) up to long[4] and often longer than the petioles (leaf stalks). Buds are long, glaucous to brown, receptacle urceolate (urn shaped); operculum (cap) shorter than the receptacle but broader with a rounded margin and umbonate (knob like) apex. The flowers are white, blooming between October and March and are typical eucalypt flowers in that the obvious floral structure is the mass of stamens. The petals fuse early in bud development to form the operculum (cap) which is later shed to reveal the stamens. Similarly, the sepals form an outer operculum which is shed early in bud development.[5] The flowers are pollinated by birds such as Yellow-throated Honeyeater (_Lichenostomus flavicollis_), Black-headed Honey-eater (_'Melithreptus affinis_) and Strong-billed Honey-eater (_Melithreptus validirostris_).[6]

The seed capsule is urceolate, long and in diameter, glaucous or brown with a narrow, level staminal ring, sunken disk with deeply enclosed valves.[7]

Variation in leaf colour

Unlike many eucalypts, _E. urnigera_ displays a morphological unity across the species with one important exception. There is a significant variation in the level of glaucicity (waxiness) between _E. urnigera_ in lower altitude shady forest and those trees in the more exposed higher altitude sites. This was studied by Barber and Jackson in 1957[8] and followed up in later studies. _E. urnigera_ at lower altitudes (560-670 m) and in sheltered sites are uniformly green whereas at higher altitude (950-1050 m ) _E. urnigera_ is uniformly glaucous. The transition from one phenotype to the other is most clearly seen on a steep section of walking track below the Chalet on the Pinnacle Road. Within 200 m altitude the transition is made. It is believed that the lower light conditions of the relatively closed sub-alpine forest favours the green leaved phenotype, being able to more efficiently photosynthesize in lower light conditions than the glaucous phenotype. However, at the more exposed higher altitude where there is more direct sunlight the glaucous phenotype is favoured. The wax coating reflects infra red lightand probably assists in protecting the tree from frost.[9] Further research has explored reflectance of ultraviolet and photosynthetically active radiation[10] This may be a mechanism to cope with times of below freezing temperature when water necessary for photosynthesis is not readily available but light intensity is high.


Taxonomy

The species was first described by the nineteenth century English botanist, Joseph Hooker, in the article _Florae Tasmaniae Spicilegium: or, Contributions towards a Flora of Van Diemen's Land._ in the _London Journal of Botany_ in 1847,[11] from specimens collected by the colonial botanist Ronald Campbell Gunn from Mount Wellington and Lake Echo. The specific name comes from the Latin _urna_, meaning urn and _gero_, meaning to bear. It relates to the distinctive urn shaped buds and seed capsules.[12][13]


Range

_E. urnigera_ is an endemic Tasmanian alpine eucalypt of the sub genus _Symphomyrtus_ and is the dominant eucalypt species at altitudes from on moist but well drained dolerite slopes and talus. It is restricted to the mountains of south eastern Tasmania, the Mount Wellington range, Mount Field and isolated pockets from Tylers Hill near Southport, south of Hobart, north to Alma Tier near Interlaken and Mount Seymour east of Oatlands in central Tasmania and a small population on the eastern side of Maria Island off the east coast. Typically, it is found below the range of _E. coccifera_ (snow gum) and above the mixed and wet sclerophyll forests of the lower slopes although it will grow within both vegetation types.


Cultivation

_E. urnigera_ does not have any commercial use as a timber tree in Tasmania but it is prized as a specimen tree in cooler regions of the United States of America and in the British Isles. Grafton Nursery in Worcestershire (UK) considers it superior to _E.gunni,_ a eucalypt commonly grown in the UK. Its colourful bark and foliage make it a valuable as a garden ornamental. Its lignotuber enables coppicing and is proposed as one of the varieties for United Kingdom firewood production.[14]
