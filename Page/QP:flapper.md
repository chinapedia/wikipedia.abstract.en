QP:FLAPPER is a two-member illustrator unit consisting of Japanese artists Tometa Ohara and Koharu Sakura. Since 2001, they have provided character designs for anime and light novels.[1] In 2005, they debuted as character designers in Leaf's game _Kusari_.

According to an interview in _Dengeki G's Magazine_, Ohara and Sakura first met at Ikebukuro's Taishōromandō, a specialty store for goods from Sega's _Sakura Wars_ franchise.[2] After they formed as a unit, they produced _dōjinshi_ based on various games by Leaf such as _To Heart_. Ohara and Sakura's pseudonyms were initially simply and , but Pimeko changed her name to Koharu Sakura in October 2006. In response of this, Tometa added Ohara as a surname to his pseudonym. However, they still used their old aliases when working on visual novels.
