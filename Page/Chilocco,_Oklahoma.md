CHILOCCO is an unincorporated community in Kay County, Oklahoma, United States.[1] The community is located in northern Kay County, south-southwest of Arkansas City, Kansas.[2]

Its name came from the Chilocco Indian School, which in turn most likely took its name from the Creek _tci lako_, which literally meant "big deer" but typically referred to a horse. A post office opened in Chilocco on March 27, 1883.[3]
