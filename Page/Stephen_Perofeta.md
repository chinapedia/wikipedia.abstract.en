He scored a try and kicked two conversions, for a total of nine points in his first game. A week later, Perofeta started at first five as the Blues defeated the touring British and Irish Lions at Eden Park 22-16 [5]. Perofeta played a key role in the victory, with his beautiful cut-out pass setting up Rieko Ioane for the game's opening try, then his unsuccessful penalty goal attempt lead to a Sonny Bill Williams try (which Perofeta duly converted) to give the Blues the halftime lead.
