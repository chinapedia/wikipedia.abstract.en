Science and technology

Device

    -   Filter (aquarium), critical components of both freshwater and marine aquaria
    -   Filter paper, a semi-permeable paper barrier placed perpendicular to a liquid or air flow. It is used to separate fine solids from liquids or air
    -   Air filter, a device composed of fibrous materials which removes solid particulates such as dust, pollen, mold, and bacteria from the air
    -   Oil filter, a filter to remove contaminants from engine oil, transmission oil, lubricating oil, or hydraulic oil
    -   Pneumatic filter, a device which removes contaminants from a compressed air stream
    -   Water filter, removes impurities from water by means of a fine physical barrier, a chemical process or a biological process
    -   Cigarette filter, a part of a cigarette intended to filter the smoke inhaled by a smoker
    -   Coffee filter, a utensil used to separate coffee grounds from liquid coffee
    -   Fuel filter, found in most internal combustion engines
    -   Filtration (wine)
-   Sieve or macroscopic filter, a device for separating wanted elements from unwanted material

Optics

-   Optical filter, selectively transmits light of different wavelengths
    -   Interference filter, reflects one or more spectral bands or lines and transmits others, while maintaining a nearly zero coefficient of absorption for all wavelengths of interest
    -   Dichroic filter, a very accurate color filter used to selectively pass light of a small range of colors while reflecting other colors
    -   Hydrogen-alpha filter, an optical filter that transmits a narrow bandwidth of light centred on the H-alpha wavelength
    -   Photographic filter, a camera accessory consisting of an optical filter that can be inserted in the optical path
    -   Infrared cut-off filter, designed to reflect or block mid-infrared wavelengths while passing visible light
    -   Chelsea filter, a dichromatic optical filter used for identifying coloured stones
    -   Astronomical filter, a telescope accessory used to enhance the details of celestial objects

Signal processing

-   Filter (signal processing)
    -   Electronic filter, an electronic circuit which processes signals, for example to remove unwanted frequency components
    -   Digital filter, a system that performs mathematical operations to reduce or enhance certain aspects of a signal
    -   Analogue filter, a basic building block of signal processing much used in electronics

Computing

-   Filter (higher-order function), in functional programming
-   Filter (software), a computer program to process a data stream
-   Filter (video), a software component that performs some operation on a multimedia stream

-   Content-control software also known as an Internet filter
-   Wordfilter, a script typically used on Internet forums or chat rooms
-   Berkeley Packet Filter, filter expression used in the qualification of network data
-   DSL filter, a low-pass filter installed between analog devices and a telephone line
-   Helicon Filter, a raster graphics editor
-   Filter (large eddy simulation), a mathematical operation intended to remove a range of small scales from the solution to the Navier-Stokes equations
-   Kalman filter, an approximating algorithm in optimal control applications and problems

Mathematics
