_LOVE IT OR LIST IT_ is a television franchise of television programs created by Maria Armstrong and Catherine Fogarty. Each series follows a format, with a current homeowning couple or family to deciding between keeping their newly renovated current home (known on the show as "Love It") or buying a new home and selling their current one (known on the show as "List It").


Overview

Love It or List It

_Love It or List It_ is the original show in the franchise. The show is produced by Big Coat Productions and was based in Toronto and other surrounding areas in Ontario, Canada. The show premiered as a primetime program on W Network on September 8, 2008, and has since aired on OWN Canada as well as HGTV in the United States. In September 2014, the show began filming in the United States in North Carolina.[1] The show is hosted by Hilary Farr and David Visentin.

Love It or List It Vancouver

According to the show's producers, "The time is right to bring the winning formula to Vancouver’s hot real estate market." _Love It or List It Vancouver_ will showcase families in B.C.’s largest metropolitan city who are struggling with homes that no longer suit their needs. It’s up to Jillian to put a stop to the wandering eyes of our homeowners, armed with a list of "must-haves" and a design she hopes will persuade them to stay. Meanwhile, the realtor is determined to get homeowners to relocate by taking the homeowners list of "must-haves" and finding them new digs. This is very similar to the original show's format. According to the show's executive producer Maria Armstrong, "Love It or List It has been a huge success for us and we are thrilled to be taking this amazing show to the West Coast." _Love It or List It Vancouver_ was launched during winter 2012.[2] The show is hosted by ABC's _Extreme Makeover Home Edition_ designer Jillian Harris and actor now realtor Todd Talbot. (The program runs on HGTV under the name _Love it or List it Too_ without any mention that it's shot in Vancouver.)
