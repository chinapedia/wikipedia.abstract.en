_MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL_ is a 1975 British comedy film concerning the Arthurian legend, written and performed by the Monty Python comedy group of Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin, and directed by Gilliam and Jones. It was conceived during the hiatus between the third and fourth series of their BBC television series _Monty Python's Flying Circus_.

In contrast to the group's first film, _And Now for Something Completely Different_, a compilation of sketches from the first two television series, _Holy Grail_ draws on new material, parodying the legend of King Arthur's quest for the Holy Grail. Thirty years later, Idle used the film as the basis for the musical _Spamalot_.

_Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ grossed more than any British film exhibited in the US in 1975. In the US, it was selected as the second-best comedy of all time in the ABC special _Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time_. In the UK, readers of _Total Film_ magazine ranked it the fifth-greatest comedy film of all time; a similar poll of Channel 4 viewers placed it sixth (2000).[1]


Plot

In 963 AD, King Arthur and his squire, Patsy, travel throughout Britain searching for men to join the Knights of the Round Table. Arthur recruits Sir Bedevere the Wise, Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Galahad the Pure, Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, and Sir Not-Appearing-in-this-Film, along with their squires and Robin's troubadours. Arthur leads the men to Camelot, but after a musical number, he decides not to go there because it is "a silly place" and sets off elsewhere. As they turn away, God (an image of W. G. Grace) speaks to them and gives Arthur the task of finding the Holy Grail.

Arthur and his men search the land for clues to the Grail. They come to a castle occupied by rude French soldiers who claim to have the Grail and insult the Englishmen. Arthur and his men come up with a plan to sneak in using a Trojan Rabbit, but they mishandle its execution when they forget to hide inside it and are forced away. Arthur decides that the knights should go their separate ways to search for clues to the Grail's whereabouts. A modern-day historian filming a documentary describing the Arthurian legends is abruptly killed by a knight on horseback, triggering a modern-day police investigation.

On the knights' travels, Arthur and Bedevere attempt to satisfy the strange requests of the dreaded Knights Who Say Ni. Sir Robin avoids a fight with a Three-Headed Giant by running away while the heads are arguing. Sir Galahad is led by a grail-shaped beacon to Castle Anthrax, populated by 150 nubile young women, but to his chagrin is "rescued" by Lancelot. Lancelot, after finding a note from Swamp Castle believed to be from a lady being forced to marry against her will, rushes to the castle and kills nearly the entire wedding party, only to discover that the note was sent by an effeminate prince.

Arthur and his knights regroup and are joined by three new knights as well as Brother Maynard and his monk followers. They meet Tim the Enchanter, who directs them to a cave where the location of the Grail is said to be written, but it is guarded by the deadly Rabbit of Caerbannog. After the Rabbit kills Sirs Gawain, Ector, and Bors, Arthur uses the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, provided by Maynard, to destroy the creature. Inside, they find the inscription from Joseph of Arimathea, directing them to the Castle of Aarrgh. After evading a giant monster, they arrive at the Bridge of Death and must answer three questions from the bridge-keeper to pass. Lancelot answers first and correctly, and passes on. Robin and Galahad fail to answer correctly and are thrown over the bridge. Then Arthur asks for clarification of one of the bridge-keeper's questions - which throws the bridge-keeper over the bridge, allowing Arthur and Bedevere to pass.

When Arthur and Bedevere reach the bridge's end, they cannot find Lancelot, unaware he was arrested by the modern-day policemen investigating the historian's death. Arthur and Bedevere find the Castle of Aarrgh, but it is occupied by the same French soldiers from before. They amass a large army of knights to assault the castle, when suddenly a large police force shows up, arrests Arthur and Bedevere for the historian's death, and shuts down the film's production.

Production

Development

provided a unifying motif for the film.]] Fifteen months before the BBC visited the set in May 1974, the Monty Python troupe assembled the first version of the screenplay.[2] When half of the resulting material was set in the Middle Ages, and half was set in the present day, the group opted to focus on the Middle Ages, revolving on the legend of the Holy Grail. By the fourth or fifth version of their screenplay, the story was complete, and the cast joked the fact that the Grail was never retrieved would be "a big let-down ... a great anti-climax".[3] Graham Chapman said a challenge was incorporating scenes that did not fit the Holy Grail motif.[4]

Neither Terry Gilliam nor Terry Jones had directed a film before, and described it as a learning experience in which they would learn to make a film by making an entire full-length film.[5] The cast humorously described the novice directing style as employing the level of mutual disrespect always found in Monty Python's work.[6]

The film's initial budget of approximately £200,000 was raised by convincing 10 separate investors to contribute £20,000 apiece. Three of those investors were the rock bands Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and Genesis, who were persuaded to help fund the film by Tony Stratton-Smith, head of Charisma Records (the record label that released Python’s early comedy albums).[7] According to Terry Gilliam, the Pythons turned to rock stars like Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and Elton John for finance as the studios refused to fund the film and rock stars saw it as "a good tax write-off" due to UK income tax being "as high as 90%" at the time.[8]

Filming

_Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ was mostly shot on location in Scotland,[9] particularly around Doune Castle, Glen Coe, and the privately owned Castle Stalker. The many castles seen throughout the film were mainly either Doune Castle shot from different angles or hanging miniatures.[10] There are several exceptions to this: the very first exterior shot of a castle at the beginning of the film is Kidwelly Castle in South Wales, and the single exterior shot of the Swamp Castle during "Tale of Sir Lancelot" is Bodiam Castle in East Sussex;[11] all subsequent shots of the exterior and interior of those scenes were filmed at Doune Castle. Production designer Julian Doyle recounted that his crew constructed walls in the forest near Doune.[12] Terry Jones later recalled the crew had selected more castles around Scotland for locations, but during the two weeks prior to principal photography, the Scottish Department of the Environment declined permission for use of the castles in its jurisdiction, for fear of damage.[13]

At the start of "The Tale of Sir Robin", there is a slow camera zoom in on rocky scenery (that in the voice-over is described as "the dark forest of Ewing"). This is actually a still photograph of the gorge at Mount Buffalo National Park in Victoria, Australia. Doyle stated in 2000 during an interview with _Hotdog_ magazine[14] that it was a still image filmed with candles underneath the frame (to give a heat haze). This was a low-cost method of achieving a convincing location effect.

On the DVD audio commentary, Cleese described challenges shooting and editing Castle Anthrax in "The Tale of Sir Galahad", with what he felt the most comedic take being unused because an anachronistic coat was visible in it.[15] Castle Anthrax was also shot in one part of Doune, where costume designer Hazel Pethig advised against nudity, dressing the girls in shifts.[16]

In the scene where the knights were combatting the Rabbit of Caerbannog, a real white rabbit was used, switched with puppets for its killings.[17] It was covered with red liquid to simulate blood, though the rabbit's owner did not want the animal dirty and was kept unaware. The liquid was difficult to remove from the fur.[18] He also stated that he thought that, had they been more experienced in filmmaking, the crew would have just purchased a rabbit instead. Otherwise, the rabbit himself was unharmed. Also, the rabbit-bite effects were done by special puppetry by both Gilliam and SFX technician John Horton.

As chronicled in _The Life of Python_, _The First 20 Years of Monty Python_, and _The Pythons' Autobiography_, it was revealed that Chapman was suffering from acrophobia, trembling, and bouts of forgetfulness during filming. These were the results of Chapman's long-standing alcohol addiction, and he decided from that moment on to remain "on an even keel" while the production continued. Nearly three years after _Holy Grail_, Chapman vowed to quit drinking altogether (which he successfully achieved in December 1977).

Originally the knight characters were going to ride real horses, but after it became clear that the film's small budget precluded real horses (except for a lone horse appearing in a couple of scenes), the Pythons decided that their characters would mime horse-riding while their porters trotted behind them banging coconut shells together. The joke was derived from the old-fashioned sound effect used by radio shows to convey the sound of hooves clattering. This was later referred to in the German release of the film, which translated the title as _Die Ritter der Kokosnuß_ (_The Knights of the Coconut_).[19]

The opening credits of the film feature pseudo-Swedish subtitles, which soon turn into an appeal to visit Sweden and see the country's moose. The subtitles are soon stopped, but moose references continue throughout the actual credits until the credits are stopped again and restarted in a different visual style and with references to llamas, animals often mentioned in _Flying Circus_. The subtitles were written by Michael Palin as a way to "entertain the 'captive' audience" at the beginning of the film.[20]


Soundtrack

In addition to several songs written by Python regular Neil Innes, several pieces of music were licensed from De Wolfe Music Library. These include:

-   "Wide Horizon", composed by Pierre Arvay. Used during the opening titles.
-   "Ice Floe 9", composed by Pierre Arvay. Used during the opening titles.
-   "Countrywide",[21] composed by Anthony Mawer. Used during the beginning titles after the first titlers are sacked.
-   "Homeward Bound", composed by Jack Trombey. Used as King Arthur's heroic theme.
-   "Crossed Swords",[22] composed by Dudley Matthew. Played during King Arthur's battle with the Black Knight.
-   "The Flying Messenger",[23] composed by Oliver Armstrong. Played during Sir Lancelot's misguided storming of Swamp Castle.
-   "The Promised Land",[24] composed by Stanley Black. Used in the scene where Arthur approaches the castle on the island.
-   "Starlet in the Starlight",[25] composed by Kenneth Essex. Briefly used for Prince Herbert's attempt to express himself in song.
-   "Love Theme",[26] composed by Peter Knight. Also used briefly for Prince Herbert.
-   "Revolt",[27] composed by Eric Towren. Used as the army charges on Castle Aaargh.


Release

_Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ had its theatrical debut in the United Kingdom in 3 April 1975, followed by a United States release on 27 April 1975. It was re-released on 14 October 2015 in the United Kingdom.[28]

The film had its television premiere 25 February 1977 on the _CBS Late Movie_. Reportedly, the Pythons were displeased to discover a number of edits were done by the network to reduce use of profanity and the showing of blood. The troupe pulled back the rights and thereafter had it broadcast in the United States only on PBS and later other channels such as Comedy Central and IFC, where it runs uncut.[29]

In Region 1, The Criterion Collection released a LaserDisc version of the film featuring audio commentary from directors Jones and Gilliam.[30] In 2001, Columbia Tristar published a two-disc, special-edition DVD. Disc one included two commentary tracks featuring Idle, Palin and Cleese in the first, and Jones and Gilliam in the second, and "Subtitles for People Who Don't Like the Film", consisting of lines taken from William Shakespeare's _Henry IV, Part 2_.[31] Disc two includes _Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Lego_ (also known as _Lego Knights_ or _It's Only a Model_), a "brickfilm" version of the "Camelot Song" as sung by Lego minifigures.[32] It was created by Spite Your Face Productions on commission from the Lego Group and Python Pictures. The project was conceived by the original film's respective producer and co-director, John Goldstone and Terry Gilliam.[33] Disc two also includes two scenes from the film's Japanese dub, literally translated back into English through subtitles. "The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations", hosted by Palin and Jones,[34] shows places in Scotland used for the setting titled as "England 932 A.D." (as well as the two Pythons purchasing a copy of their own script as a guide). Also included is a who's who page, advertising galleries and sing-alongs.[35]

A limited-edition DVD release additionally included a copy of the screenplay, a limited-edition film cell/senitype, and limited-edition art cards;[36] however, a few of the bonus features from the 'Extraordinarily Deluxe Edition' were omitted. A 35th-anniversary edition on Blu-ray was released in the US on 6 March 2012.[37] Special features include "The Holy Book of Days," a second-screen experience that can be downloaded as an app on an iOS device and played with the Blu-ray to enhance its viewing, lost animation sequences with a new intro from animator Terry Gilliam, outtakes and extended scenes with Python member and the movie's co-director Terry Jones.[38]


Reaction and legacy

Contemporary reviews were mixed. Vincent Canby of _The New York Times_ wrote in a favourable review that the film had "some low spots," but had gags which were "nonstop, occasionally inspired and should not be divulged, though it's not giving away too much to say that I particularly liked a sequence in which the knights, to gain access to an enemy castle, come up with the idea of building a Trojan rabbit."[39] Charles Champlin of the _Los Angeles Times_ was also positive, writing that the film, "like _Mad_ comics, is not certain to please every taste. But its youthful exuberance and its rousing zaniness are hard not to like. As a matter of fact, the sense of fun is dangerously contagious."[40] Penelope Gilliatt of _The New Yorker_ called the film "often recklessly funny and sometimes a matter of comic genius."[41]

Other reviews were less enthusiastic. _Variety_ wrote that the storyline was "basically an excuse for set pieces, some amusing, others overdone."[42] Gene Siskel of the _Chicago Tribune_ gave the film two-and-a-half stars, writing that he felt "it contained about 10 very funny moments and 70 minutes of silence. Too many of the jokes took too long to set up, a trait shared by both _Blazing Saddles_ and _Young Frankenstein_. I guess I prefer Monty Python in chunks, in its original, television revue format."[43] Gary Arnold of _The Washington Post_ called the film "a fitfully amusing spoof of the Arthurian legends" but "rather poky" in tempo, citing the running gag of Swedish subtitles in the opening credits as an example of how the Pythons "don't know when to let go of any _shtik_".[44] Geoff Brown of _The Monthly Film Bulletin_ wrote in a mixed review that "the team's visual buffooneries and verbal rigamaroles (some good, some bad, but mostly indifferent) are piled on top of each other with no attention to judicious timing or structure, and a form which began as a jaunty assault on the well-made revue sketch and an ingenious misuse of television's fragmented style of presentation, threatens to become as unyielding and unfruitful as the conventions it originally attacked."[45]

The film's reputation grew over time. In 2000, readers of _Total Film_ magazine voted _Holy Grail_ the fifth-greatest comedy film of all time.[46] The next Python film, _Life of Brian_, was ranked first.[47] A similar poll of Channel 4 viewers in 2005 placed _Holy Grail_ in sixth place (with _Life of Brian_ again topping the list).

in a production of _Spamalot_]] In 2005, the film spawned a Tony Award-winning Broadway musical smash hit spinoff, _Spamalot_. Written primarily by Idle, the show has more of an overarching plot and leaves out certain portions of the movie due to difficulties in rendering certain effects on stage. Nonetheless, many of the jokes from the film are present in the show.[48]

In 2011, an ABC prime-time special, _Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time_, counted down the best films chosen by fans based on results of a poll conducted by ABC and _People_. _Holy Grail_ was selected as the second best comedy after _Airplane!_.

In 2013, the Pythons lost a legal case to Mark Forstater, the film's producer, over royalties for the derivative work, _Spamalot_. They owed a combined £800,000 in legal fees and back royalties to Forstater.[49][50] To help cover the cost of these royalties and fees, the group arranged and performed in a stage show, _Monty Python Live (mostly)_, held at The O2 arena in London in July 2014.
