FÁBIO LUIZ CARILLE DE ARAÚJO (born 26 September 1973), known as FÁBIO CARILLE, is a Brazilian retired footballer who played as a defender, and is the current manager of Corinthians.


Career

Born in São Paulo, Carille was known as FÁBIO LUIZ during his playing days. After starting it out at Sertãozinho, he notably represented Corinthians, Coritiba, Paraná, Santa Cruz and Botafogo-SP; he also enjoyed a one-year spell in China with Guangzhou.[1][2][3]

Carille retired in 2007 at the age of 33 with Grêmio Barueri, and was immediately appointed as interim manager, as the club's manager Sérgio Soares was relieved from his duites.[4] He would subsequently remain at the club for two more seasons, acting as an assistant manager and under-20 manager.

In 2009, Carille moved to another club he represented as a player, Corinthians, as Mano Menezes' assistant. On 11 October 2010 he was appointed as interim manager, after Adílson Batista resigned.[5] He returned to his previous duties after the appointment of Tite as manager, but was again interim in June 2016, as the latter left to manage the Brazil national team.

On 17 September 2016, Carille was named first team manager until the end of the year, replacing dismissed Cristóvão Borges.[6]

He joined Saudi club Al-Wehda in May 2018.[7]
