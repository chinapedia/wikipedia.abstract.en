History

In October 2012, Currency Exchange International, Corp. applied to the Minister of Finance in Canada for letters patent continuing its wholly owned subsidiary, Currency Exchange International of Canada Corp. as a bank under the Bank Act. The company was to change its name to Exchange Bank of Canada in English and Banque de change du Canada in French, and with its head office in Toronto, Ontario.[3]

In September 2016, Currency Exchange International of Canada Corp. was given the order to commence and carry on business as Exchange Bank of Canada (EBC), in English, and Banque de change du Canada, in French, and is now operating as a Canadian Schedule 1 bank.[4] The order to continue as a federally regulated financial institution was made by Canada's Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) after the Letters Patent were issued by the Minister of Finance.[5]
