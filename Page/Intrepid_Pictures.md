INTREPID PICTURES is an American independent film and television production company dedicated to producing elevated commercial content for global mainstream audiences. It was founded in 2004 by Trevor Macy and Marc D. Evans, and is currently based in Santa Monica, California.


History

Intrepid Pictures was founded in 2004 by founders and co-CEOs Trevor Macy and Marc D. Evans.[1] Currently, Macy serves as the sole CEO. Before Intrepid was created, both Evans and Macy worked at Revolution Studios and Propaganda Films respectively. Evans spent 4 years at Revolution Studios as CFO from 2000 to 2004[2] while Macy spent 2 years as the COO of Propaganda Films and independently produced Auto Focus.[3]

A year after forming the company, Rogue signed a deal with Intrepid to co-produce, co-finance and distribute films with partnership with Universal Studios, Rogue's then-parent company, for five years.[4] The company then debuted with _Waist Deep_ in 2006, which critically flopped but gained $21.35 million worldwide.

After stumbles, the group broke through with _The Strangers_. In May 2012 FilmDistrict acquired the film rights to what would become _Oculus_.[5] Soon after, the film released on April 11, 2013, to commercial and critical success, earning $44 million over a $5 million budget and received positive reviews. On June 2015, Los Angeles Media Fund co-funded _The Bye Bye Man_, which originated from a script by Jonathan Penner[6] with STX Entertainment acquiring the film in December.[7]

Intrepid's most notable recent releases are the critically acclaimed films _Hush_, _Before I Wake_ and Gerald's Game, all with frequent Intrepid collaborator, Mike Flanagan.

Currently, Intrepid is in post-production on the Paramount Players horror thriller _Eli_ directed by Ciar√°n Foy.

In January 2018, Intrepid and Macy announced their involvement in _Doctor Sleep_, the sequel to the iconic horror film _The Shining_, for Warner Brothers.[8]

In February 2011, Melinda Nishioka was hired as a Coordinator, and as of September 2016 is the new Vice President of Development.[9]
