The CIVIL RESOLUTION TRIBUNAL (CRT) is Canada's first online tribunal,[1] located in British Columbia (BC), Canada. It is one of the first examples in the world of online dispute resolution (ODR) being incorporated into the public justice system. The CRT was established under the Civil Resolution Tribunal Act (2012), which was amended in 2015.[2] The CRT initially had jurisdiction over small claims and strata property (condominium) disputes. On April 23, 2018, the government of British Columbia introduced legislation to expand the CRT's jurisdiction to include certain motor vehicle accident disputes, disputes under the Societies Act, and the Co-operative Association Act.


How it works

The CRT provides the public with access to interactive information pathways, tools, and a variety of dispute resolution methods including negotiation, facilitation and, if necessary, adjudication. Participants use all of these ODR services from a computer or mobile device at a time that is convenient for them. For those who are unable or unwilling to use technology to resolve their dispute, the tribunal provides paper-based or telephone-based services.[3]
