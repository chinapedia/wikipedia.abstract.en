DAVID ALLAN GEE (c. 1929 â€“ 13 June 2013) was a Chinese Australian coin expert, dealer, collector, and forger.

Gee was born in rural China and emigrated to Sydney as a boy.[1] He became a coin dealer and exhibitor of adult films.[2] Gee created forgeries of some of Australia's rarest coins. In 1979, he was sentenced to seven years gaol for forging coins.[3]

According to his friend Jim Henderson, controller of the Royal Australian Mint, "the twelve-sided design for the nation's fifty cent piece was substantially Gee's."[4] Gee died in June 2013.[5]
