The SALLE WAGRAM is a historic auditorium in the 17th arrondissement of Paris, France. It was built in 1865.[1] It has been listed as an official historical monument by the French Ministry of Culture since March 2, 1981.[2]

First built in 1812 as the Bal Dourlans, the huge ballroom was designed by Adrien Alphonse Fleuret, and has been the setting for international congresses, political conferences, fashion exhibitions and dance competitions.[3]

From the 1950s the hall was much used as a classical recording venue, including a Beethoven symphony cycle with the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra conducted by Carl Schuricht,[4] Stravinsky ballets with the same orchestra under Pierre Monteux, the complete _Carmen_ with Maria Callas and Nicolai Gedda, and in the 1990s for many Poulenc recordings with the French National Orchestra under Charles Dutoit.[5]

In August 2000 _La Traviata from Paris_ had the orchestra and conductor, Zubin Mehta in the Salle Wagram, while singers were on location around Paris.[6]

From 2016 the hall, then equipped for 800 spectators for orchestral concerts, became the home of the Orchestre Colonne.[7]
