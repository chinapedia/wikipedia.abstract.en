Biography

Bhaskar Saha obtained his PhD from Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Calcutta (1993). He did his postdoctoral fellowship at Naval Medical Research Institute and also served as Principal Investigator at NMRI, and Faculty, Dept of Medicine, USUHS, Bethesda, USA (1996â€“97). He joined National Centre for Cell Science in 1998 where he serves as a _Scientist-G_ and carries out his researches on immunology and cancer biology.[6] His early researches were focused on immunology and he has since shifted his focus to explore that therapeutic uses of his findings.[7] At NCCS, he is involved in five projects viz. _Leishmania-macrophage interaction_, _CD40 signaling_, _DC subset mediated priming against prostate cancer_, _Development and regulation of regulatory T cells in leishmaniasis_ and _DC subsets in leishmaniasis and regulation of T cell response_.[8] He has published several research articles, reviews and book chapters that could be found in Pubmed.[9] He has also served as a faculty member of Pune University and Vidyasagar University.[10]

Saha, who is known to have a calm and composed personality, was in the news in 2013 when he staged a hunger strike in protest against the mismanagement of research programs at National Centre for Cell Science.[11] He is married to Ratna, a school teacher at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and the couple has a son, Baibaswata and a daughter, Saptaparnee. The family lives in Pune.[12]


Awards and honors

Saha's contributions to the biological sciences earned him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research in 2009.[13] He was elected as a fellow by the National Academy of Sciences, India in 2011[14] and a year later, he became an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences.[15] He is also recipient of National Bioscience Award for Career Development of the Department of Biotechnology in 2007.[16]
