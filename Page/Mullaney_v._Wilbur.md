_MULLANEY V. WILBUR_, 421 U.S. 684 (1975), is a criminal case in which a unanimous court struck down a state statute requiring a defendant to prove the defense of provocation to downgrade a murder conviction to manslaughter.[1] Previous common law, such as in _Commonwealth v. York_ (1845), allowed such burden on the defense.[2]

Maine's statute[3] defined murder as unlawfully killing with malice, with malice defined as deliberate and unprovoked cruelty, and added that killings were presumed to be unprovoked unless the defense proved provocation by a preponderance of the evidence.[4] Justice Powell delivered the opinion for the court that provocation was a crucial part of the charge in that it determined "the degree of culpability attaching to the criminal homicide".[5]

States were able to circumvent this decision by careful wording, as in _Patterson v. New York_, in which provocation, or "extreme emotional disturbance", was classified as an allowable defense excuse, not as a listed element.[6]
