Until the end of World War II in 1945, Maria Alice and her husband were landowners in Hungary, but they lost their properties after expropriation in 1945 and left the country to avoid being captured by the Communists. They moved to Bavaria to a property of their son-in-law, Count Hans Heribert von Törring-Jettenbach, who married their eldest daughter. Their second son, Paul Baron Waldbott von Bassenheim, inherited Schloss Halbturn at the death of Maria Alice's only brother, Archduke Albrecht, in 1955.
