_FAMILYHOOD_ (; lit. "Goodbye Single") is a 2016 South Korean comedy-drama film directed by Kim Tae-gon, starring Kim Hye-soo.[1]


Plot

Go Joo-yeon (Kim Hye-soo) is a self-centered star actress who has always gotten what she wants: fame, money, and even good-looking young boyfriends. However, now in her 40s and with her acting career going downhill, she wonders whether she should settle down with her secret boyfriend, who is 12 years younger than her. However, the boyfriend, a rookie actor, is only interested in taking advantage of her fame, cheating on her behind her back. Discovering the truth, Joo-yeon is devastated that she has no one who she can truly rely on. So she decides to have someone definite in her life, her own baby.

She goes to see an obstetrician only to learn that she has reached menopause. While facing the depressing truth, she comes across a pregnant teenager Kim Dan-ji (Kim Hyun-soo) at the hospital. Joo-yeon makes the offer to Dan-ji that she will adopt the baby at whatever price, and will support her until she delivers. Dan-ji, who needs the money, accepts the offer and agrees to stay hidden at Joo-yeonâ€™s home. When Joo-yeon makes a press announcement of her pregnancy, in vengeance against her ex-boyfriend, who has become a rising star, rumors start to spread about who the father is. She declares that she will be a single mom and her dignified demeanor earns her numerous jobs making her more successful than ever. Dazzled by the new phase in her career, Joo-yeon begins to neglect Dan-ji, but worse, people are now getting suspicious.[2]
