_BAZELEY'S CASE_, 2 East P.C. 571 (Cr. Cas. Res. 1799), is an English criminal case that gave rise to Parliament creating the crime of embezzlement.[1] Bazeley was a bank teller who took money from a depositor and applied it to pay a bill of Bazeley's own business.[2] The court agreed with Bazeley's argument that the bank only had a right to possess or title to the note, not possession of it.[3] Parliament responded by creating the crime of embezzlement, the fraudulent conversion of money or property that an employee receives for her employer.[4]
