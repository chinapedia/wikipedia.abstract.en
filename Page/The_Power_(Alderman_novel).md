Overview

_The Power_ is a book within a book: a manuscript of an imagined history of the tumultuous era during which women across the world developed and shared the power to emit electricity from their hands. The manuscript is submitted by Neil Adam Armon to another author named Naomi, approximately five thousand years after the power emerges and revolution reassembles the world into a matriarchy.

Development history

_The Power_ is Alderman's fourth novel and was influenced by her relationship with Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood. The mentorship was arranged through the Rolex mentorship program. In an interview with _The Telegraph_ in 2012, Alderman explained the influence of Atwood's work on her as a novelist before the mentorship as, "I’d been to an Orthodox Jewish primary school where every morning the boys said, ‘Thank you God for not making me a woman.’ If you put that together with _The Handmaid's Tale_ in your head, something will eventually go fizz! Boom!"[8] In another interview for _The Guardian_ regarding _The Power_, Alderman described being inspired by Atwood, saying, "The one thing Margaret directly suggested was the idea of a convent."[9] Within the novel, the setting of the convent plays a crucial role during the development of the power of women.


Literary significance and reception

The book, backed up by critics’ reviews and awards, was broadly regarded as significant work of literature. The Washington Post reviewer Ron Charles praised the novel as "one of those essential feminist works that terrifies and illuminates, enrages and encourages."[10]

The Power was the winner of the Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction in 2017.[11] The novel was also featured fourth in The 10 Best Books of 2017 list by The New York Times.[12] The Guardian’s deputy literary editor Justine Jordan praised the book by stating "it's also endlessly nuanced and thought-provoking, combining elegantly efficient prose with beautiful meditations on the metaphysics of power, possibility and change."[13]

There were some who criticized the novel. The New York Times Book Review contributor Amal El-Mohtar criticized the book for worldbuilding and philosophical inconsistencies.[14]


Sequel

In December 2016, Alderman confessed that "readers of The Power are already asking me if there'll be a sequel – there won't be another novel (probably), but there are definitely so many more stories to tell than I had room for in the book."[15]


Adaptations

The novel is set to be turned into a television series, after the TV rights to Naomi Alderman's work were acquired by Jane Featherstone in an 11-way auction.[16] Upon this acquisition, Alderman said that "I can't wait to expand this story – and bring electric women to TV screens around the world."[17] Along with being the series' writer, Alderman will also be a producer.[18] The series intends to portray the characters' storylines from the book, while also exploring the characters' lives beyond the established narrative.[19]
