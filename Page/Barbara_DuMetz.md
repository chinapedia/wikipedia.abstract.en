BARBARA DUMETZ (born 1947) is an American photographer and pioneer in the field of commercial photography. She began working in Los Angeles as a commercial photographer in the 1970s, when very few women had established and maintained successful careers in the field, especially African-American women.[1][2][3][4] Over the course of her career, "she made a major contribution to diversifying the landscape of images that defined pop culture in the United States."[5]

DuMetz is known for her work with African-American celebrities, corporations and images of everyday life in African-American communities. She has won three CEBA awards and a LULU award for her commercial photography.[6][7] Group shows have included her work in Atlanta,[8][9] Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City.[10] Retrospectives of her work have appeared at the Carl Van Vechten Gallery at Fisk University in 2014[11] and at Texas Southern University.[12]
