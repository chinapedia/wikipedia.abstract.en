WILLIAM HENRY MILLER JR. (January 1, 1954 â€“ November 13, 2016) was an American rock 'n' roll collector and archivist whose magazine, _Kicks_,[1] and record label, Norton (both co-founded with his wife Miriam Linna), championed vintage rockabilly and garage bands.

Miller was born in Jamaica, Queens, and raised in Carle Place, on Long Island. He earned a bachelor's degree in photography and art from the C.W. Post campus of Long Island University, and worked as a draftsman at the same firm as his father, Gibbs & Cox.[2] He and Linna met in 1977. They established _Kicks_ in 1979, and Norton Records in 1986.[3] He performed with the Zantees and The A-Bones, produced records for Hasil Adkins, Roky Erickson and Flat Duo Jets and wrote liner notes for reissues by the Fabulous Wailers, Astronauts, Trashmen and others.[4]

Miller died in 2016, from complications of multiple myeloma, kidney failure and diabetes.[5]
