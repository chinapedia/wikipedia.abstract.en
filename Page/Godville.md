_GODVILLE_ is a mobile and desktop browser zero-player role-playing video game developed by Mikhail Platov and released on July 18, 2010. In the game, the player controls a character known as the god, who interacts with a character called the hero. The hero progresses in the video game without interaction with the player's god character. Reception to the game was positive, with the focus on its gameplay.


Gameplay

_Godville_ is a zero-player game, which means it does not require interaction from the player for the game to progress.[1] In the game, there is the hero-character, who is a non-player character, and there is the god-character, who is played by the player.[2] The hero is a religious fanatic who uses a diary to communicate with the god, and occasionally needs a sign of the god's existence;[3] the player uses the god-character to influence the hero positively or negatively using rewards and punishments, and sometimes direction communication.[4][5]

The game is also a role-playing game, meaning the hero will wander his world, defeat monsters, find and use treasure and items, and sometimes lose to monsters and unfriendly non-player characters.[6][7] The player names the hero.[8] Over time, the hero levels up and learns special skills, and has his own personality as a result of his adventuring,[9] as well as his interaction with the god.[10] The game provides some items with enhanced abilities which the hero can use only with the god's involvement; the hero will sell these items even if they do "have some marvelous effect".[11] The hero can also have a pet companion.[12]

The game allows some limited player-vs-player interaction: the god can have the hero duel other heroes.[13] The hero who wins takes some coins from the losing hero as well some of his items.[14] The god can somewhat influence these duels, but sometimes the god's attempt aids the opposing god's hero instead of his own.[15]

The game has day and night themes.[16] After a period of time playing the game, the game enables the player to review the most-important events the hero has participated in since the last time the player checked the game.[17]

The Russian version of the game in 2010, which was entirely in a web browser, had no graphics or sound.[18]


Development and release

Mikhail Platov developed the video game as "a clear progeny of _Progress Quest_".[19] A beta version of the game was announced in May 2010.[20] The game was released for iPhone and iPod in July 2010 and shortly after for iPad;[21][22] Android in March 2011 and for web browser a month later;[23][24] Windows Phone in July 2013;[25] and Apple Watch in 2015.[26]

The game is free-to-play and connected to the Internet.[27] Once their characters reach level 10, players can suggest updates to the game, which are then voted upon by the community of players for subsequent inclusion.[28][29]

Themes

The game satirizes religion,[30][31] the role-playing game genre,[32][33][34] the massively-multiplayer online game genre,[35] and video games in general.[36][37] Occasionally, the hero will be philosophical.[38]


Reception

On release, Eli Hodapp, editor-in-chief of _TouchArcade_, said that the game "sounds a little stupid" but that "it's surprisingly amusing without needing to actually do anything at all".[39] Jim Sterling, writing for _Destructoid_, called _Godville_ "a fun, funny, incredibly clever little game"; he later added in _GamesRadar_ that it was "one of the most compelling, engaging, and addictive little bits of software out there".[40] In 2012, _Edge Online_ called the game "darkly rewarding in its meaningless levelling and incessant battles even before you take into account the smart writing", and was similarly addicted to "the promises of numbers that get larger and larger over time".[41] In 2014, _The New York Times_ said the game "has a wickedly funny side, and it will light up your imagination."[42]

Hodapp said that the original adventures the character went on were repetitive, but that the developers had implemented a number of excellent community suggestions within the first month.[43] The lack of control over the hero was appealing to Hodapp.[44] He originally thought the game was novel and didn't expect it to last, but was surprised that he was still interested in the game years later, and likens checking the game to checking his email or Twitter feed.[45][46]

_NDTV_ compared the game favorably to _Godus_, another video game in the genre.[47] Reviewers approved of the game on mobile platforms, including iPod Touch,[48] iPhone,[49][50] Apple Watch,[51] and Android.[52] It was also included in _Mashable_{{'s}} "11 Facebook Games You're Embarrassed to Admit You Play" list.[53]
