Early life and education

Hayley Bay Barna was born in 1983.[5] Her parents, Eileen B. Maisel and Richard A. Barna of New York, both worked at RAB Lighting in New Jersey.[6] In high school, she was published in an international science research journal.[7] She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard[8] and has an MBA at Harvard Business School.[9]


Career

Barna began her career shortly after she graduated from Harvard University joining Bain & Company in New York.[10] She moved to Christie's Hong Kong location where she worked in strategy and then in product management for Amazon.com.[11]

Birchbox

While working towards her MBA at Harvard Business School, Barna met Katia Beauchamp and a friendship was born. So, too, was the idea of Birchbox which Barna founded with Beauchamp.[12] What began as a business plan during B-School turned into a website where they began to acquire customers interested in "an ecommerce experience focused on new product discovery."[13] They founded the company Birchbox together in 2010.[14] In 2013, she and Beauchamp won the Leadership Award At Forbes Women's Summit.[15] Barna and Beauchamp opened the first Birchbox store in 2014.[16]

As of 2015, Birchbox had received over $70 million in venture funding and had one million subscribers.[17] In August 2015,[18] Barna ceased co-leading the company as co-CEO.[19] She spent the subsequent six months as an angel investor.[20]

Although she stepped down from her role as co-CEO of Birchbox in 2015,[21][22] she remained a member of the board.[23]

First Round

After announcing it in February,[24] she joined First Round Capital as a venture partner in 2016.[25] On February 16, 2016, Barna shared a post on publishing platform medium.com about her first day at First Round stating, "I canâ€™t think of a better place to do this than First Round, which led the seed round in my company Birchbox, and has always put founders first through good times and bad."[26] She was their first female partner.[27][28] One of her first initial First Round investments was the travel startup Collective Hotels & Retreats, with her also joining the board.[29] By late 2017, she largely focused on e-commerce startups.[30] She was on the boards of Madison Reed and RAB Lighting.[31]

By late 2017, she was organizing a working group of women in technology in New York with monthly meetings.[32] Also in late 2017, she was promoted to general partner. At that point she had invested in companies such as Collective Retreats, Keeps, CrowdJustice, and Mirror.[33]


Personal life

Barna is currently based in Manhattan,[34] New York.[35] During her time at Harvard Business School she met her husband, Fredrik Vik Maroe. They wed in 2014 at a private estate located in Staatsburg, New York.[36]
