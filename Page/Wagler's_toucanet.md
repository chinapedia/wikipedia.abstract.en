WAGLER'S TOUCANET (_Aulacorhynchus wagleri_) is a species of bird in the family Ramphastidae found in the Sierra Madre del Sur of Guerrero and Oaxaca in south-western Mexico.[1] Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowlands and montane forests. It is also resident in shrublands, wetlands, farmlands and gardens.[2]


Taxonomy and systematics

Wagler's toucanet was originally described in the genus _Pteroglossus_. It is still considered to be a subspecies of the emerald toucanet by many authourities.[3]


Description

Like other toucans, Wagler's toucanet is brightly marked and has a large bill. The adult is 30–35 cm (12–14 in) long and weight can range from 118–230 g (4.2–8.1 oz). The sexes are alike in appearance, although the female generally is smaller and slightly shorter-billed. It is, as other members of the genus Aulacorhynchus, mainly green. The vent and tail-tip are rufous. The bill is black with yellow to the upper mandible and a white band at the base of the bill. The throat is white and the colour of the eye-ring is very dark, appearing blackish from a distance. The legs are dull greyish and the iris is dark.
