The SENTINEL BLOCK is a historic building located in Iowa Falls, Iowa, United States. Previous commercial blocks in Iowa Falls tended to follow the more ornate Italianate style. This building, completed in 1905, marks a departure from those older structures.[1] Rectilinear brick panels above the windows replaced the decorative hoodmolds, and the brick patterned cornice with a plain stone cap replaced the heavy metal cornice. The building also features an oriel window with a crenelated parapet. The building housed the _Iowa Falls Sentinel_ for over 20 years. It began as the _Eldora Sentinel_ in 1857, relocated to Iowa Falls in 1865, and was bought out by its competitor, the _Hardin County Citizen_, in 1927.

The building was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. It was included as a contributing property in the Washington Avenue Commercial Historic District in 2012.[2]
