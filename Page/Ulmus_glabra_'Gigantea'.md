The Wych Elm cultivar _ULMUS GLABRA_ 'GIGANTEA' was listed as _U. montana_ var. _gigantea_ Hort. by Kirchner (1864).[1] An _U. montana gigantea_ was distributed by the Späth nursery, Berlin, in the 1890s and early 1900s. It did not appear in Späth's 1903 catalogue.[2] A specimen at Kew was judged by Henry to be "not distinct enough to deserve a special name".[3] Both Späth and the Hesse Nursery of Weener, Germany, supplied it in the 1930s.[4][5]

Green gave a different clone, the Dutch Elm 'Major', as synonym of 'Gigantea'.[6]


Description

The Kew specimen was a small tree with ascending branches.[7] Herbarium leaf-specimens show a large orbicular wych elm leaf with a typically short petiole (see EXTERNAL LINKS below).


Pests and diseases

A cultivar of the Wych Elm, 'Gigantea' is susceptible to Dutch Elm disease.


Cultivation

One tree was planted in 1897 as _U. montana gigantea_ at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, Canada.[8] Three specimens supplied by Späth to the RBGE in 1902 as _U. montana gigantea_ may survive in Edinburgh, as it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city (viz. the Wentworth Elm);[9] the current list of Living Accessions held in the Garden _per se_ does not list the plant.[10]


Accessions

None known.
