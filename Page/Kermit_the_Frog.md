KERMIT THE FROG is a Muppet character and Jim Henson's best-known creation. Introduced in 1955, Kermit serves as the straight man protagonist of numerous Muppet productions, most notably _Sesame Street_ and _The Muppet Show_, as well as in other television series, films, specials, and public service announcements through the years. Henson performed Kermit until his death in 1990; Steve Whitmire performed Kermit from that time until his dismissal in 2016. Kermit is currently performed by Matt Vogel.[1] He was also voiced by Frank Welker in _Muppet Babies_ and occasionally in other animation projects, and is voiced by Matt Danner in the 2018 reboot of _Muppet Babies_.

Kermit performed the hit singles "Bein' Green" in 1970 and "The Rainbow Connection" in 1979 for _The Muppet Movie_, the first feature-length film featuring the Muppets. "The Rainbow Connection" reached No. 25 on the _Billboard_ Hot 100. Kermit's iconic look and voice have been recognizable worldwide since, and in 2006, the character was credited as the author of _Before You Leap: A Frog's Eye View of Life's Greatest Lessons_, an "autobiography" told from the perspective of the character himself.


History and development

Kermit first appeared on May 9, 1955, in the premiere of WRC-TV's _Sam and Friends_.[2] This prototype Kermit was created from a discarded spring coat belonging to Henson's mother and two ping pong ball halves for eyes.[3]

Initially, Kermit was a lizard-like creature. He subsequently made a number of television appearances before his status as a frog was established. His collar was added at the time to make him seem more frog-like and to conceal the seam between his head and body.[4]

Naming

The origin of Kermit's name is a subject of some debate. It is often claimed that Kermit was named after Henson's childhood friend Kermit Scott, from Leland, Mississippi.[5][6] However, Karen Falk, head archivist and board of directors member for the Jim Henson Legacy organization, denies this claim on the Jim Henson Company's website:

Joy DiMenna, the only daughter of Kermit Kalman Cohen who worked as a sound engineer at WBAL-TV during Jim Henson's time with _Sam and Friends_, recalls that the puppet was named after her father. According to Kermit Cohen's obituary, as well as DiMenna and Lenny Levin, a colleague of Mr. Cohen's at WBAL:

Another common belief is that Kermit was named for Kermit Love, who worked with Henson in designing and constructing Muppets, particularly on _Sesame Street_ but Love's association with Henson did not begin until well after Kermit's creation and naming, and he always denied any connection between his name and that of the character.[7]

As _Sesame Street_ is localized for some different markets that speak languages other than English, Kermit is often renamed. In Portugal, he is called _Cocas, o Sapo_ (_sapo_ means "toad"), and in Brazil, his name is similar: _Caco, o Sapo_. In most of Hispanic America, his name is _la rana René_ (_René the Frog_), while in Spain, he is named _Gustavo_.[8] In the Arabic version, he is known as _Kamel_, which is a common Arabic male name that means "perfect". In Hungary, he is called _Breki_ (onomatopoetic).[9]

Performers

Jim Henson originated the character in 1955 on his local television series, _Sam and Friends_.[10] Brian Henson described his father's performance as Kermit as "coming out of his own personality—was a wry intelligence, a little bit of a naughtiness, but Kermit always loved everyone around and also loved a good prank."[11] He continued to perform the character until his death in 1990.[12] Henson's last known performance as Kermit was for an appearance on _The Arsenio Hall Show_ to promote _The Muppets at Walt Disney World_. Henson died twelve days after that appearance.[13]

Following Henson's death, veteran Muppet performer Steve Whitmire was named Kermit's new performer. In 2017, Whitmire seemed to imply in a blog post that Henson had asked him to assume the role before he died, though Henson's daughter Cheryl claimed Brian had selected him after her father's death.[14] Whitmire's first public performance as Kermit was at the end of the television special _The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson_ in 1990. He remained Kermit's principal performer until 2016.[15] Disney announced that Matt Vogel would be taking over as the performer and voice for Kermit on July 10, 2017.[16] Whitmire later revealed that he had not chosen to voluntarily leave the role, but rather, had been recast by The Muppets Studio in October 2016.[17][18] In an interview with _The Hollywood Reporter_ later in July 2017, Whitmire elaborated he was fired for two reasons: long-term creative disagreements over Kermit's characterization and prolonged labor union negotiations that delayed his involvement in Muppet-related productions.[19]

For a brief demonstration at _MuppetFest_ (a 2001 Muppet fan convention), Muppet performer John Kennedy performed Kermit opposite Whitmire's performance of young Kermit (from _Kermit's Swamp Years_). Kennedy also performed Kermit for _Muppets Ahoy!_, a 2006 Disney Cruise Line stage show (though Whitmire performed Kermit for the first few shows). Muppet performer Artie Esposito briefly performed Kermit in 2009 for a few personal appearances (an appearance on _America's Got Talent_, the _MTV Video Music Awards_, and at the 2009 D23 Expo).

Voice actor Frank Welker provided the voice of Baby Kermit on the animated Saturday morning cartoon, _Muppet Babies_.[20] He also provided the voice of an adult Kermit for a short-lived spin-off, _Little Muppet Monsters_. Matt Danner voices Baby Kermit on the 2018 reboot of _Muppet Babies_.[21]

Character biography

A biography has been developed for Kermit the Frog as if he was an actual living performer rather than a puppet character. According to this fictional biography, he was born in Leland, Mississippi, alongside approximately 2,353 siblings,[22] though a 2011 "interview" on _The Ellen DeGeneres Show_ has him state that he was from the swamps of Louisiana.[23]

As portrayed in the 2002 film _Kermit's Swamp Years_, at the age of 12, he was the first of his siblings to leave the swamp, and one of the first frogs to talk to humans. He is shown in the film encountering a 12-year-old Jim Henson (played by Christian Kriebel) for the first time.

According to _The Muppet Movie,_ Kermit returned to the swamp, where a passing agent (Dom DeLuise) noted he had talent and, thus inspired, he headed to Hollywood, encountering the rest of the Muppets along the way. Together, they were given a standard "rich and famous" contract by Lew Lord (Orson Welles) of Wide World Studios and began their showbiz careers. In _Before You Leap_, Kermit again references encountering Jim Henson sometime after the events depicted in the course of _The Muppet Movie_ and details their friendship and their partnership in the entertainment industry, crediting Henson as being the individual to whom he owes his fame. At some point after the events of _The Muppet Movie_, Kermit and the other Muppets begin _The Muppet Show_, and the characters remain together as a group, before starring in the other Muppet films and _Muppets Tonight_, with Kermit usually at the core of the stories as the lead protagonist. Kermit is shown in _The Muppet Movie_ as stating that the events of the film are "approximately how it happened" when asked by his nephew Robin about how the Muppets got started.[24]

Fozzie Bear is portrayed as Kermit's best friend—a fact reiterated by Kermit in _Before You Leap_—and the two were frequently seen together during sketches on _The Muppet Show_ and in other Muppet-related media and merchandise.[25]

On August 4, 2015, Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy "announced" that they had ended their romantic relationship.[26][27] On September 2, 2015, Kermit was stated to have found a new girlfriend, a pig named Denise,[28] but around February 2016, Denise supposedly broke up with Kermit after almost six months together.[29]


Career

'']] Kermit has been featured prominently on both _The Muppet Show_ and _Sesame Street_.[30] However, he had a prominent career before _Sesame Street_{{'}}s debut in 1969, as he starred in _Sam and Friends_, and numerous Muppets made guest appearances on _Today_ from 1961 and _The Ed Sullivan Show_ from 1966.[31]

_Sesame Street_

Kermit was one of the original main Muppet characters on _Sesame Street_.[32] Closely identified with the show, Kermit usually appeared as a lecturer on simple topics, a straight man to another Muppet (usually Grover, Herry Monster or Cookie Monster), or a news reporter interviewing storybook characters for Sesame Street News.[33] He sang many songs on the show, including "Bein' Green",[34] and appeared in the 1998 video _The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street_.[35]

Unlike the rest of the show's Muppets, Kermit was never any property of Sesame Workshop and has rarely been a part of the show's merchandise. When Sesame Workshop bought full ownership of its characters from The Jim Henson Company for $180 million, Kermit was not included in the deal.[36] The character now belongs to The Muppets Studio, a division of The Walt Disney Company.[37] His first _Sesame Street_ appearance since Disney ownership (and last appearance on the show to date) was in an _Elmo's World_ segment in the show's 40th-season premiere on November 10, 2009.

With the Muppets

In _The Muppet Show_ television series, Kermit was the central character, the showrunner, and the long-suffering stage manager of the theater show, trying to keep order amidst the chaos created by the other Muppets. Henson once claimed that Kermit's job on the _Muppet Show_ was much like his own: "trying to get a bunch of crazies to actually get the job done."[38] It was on this show that the running gag of Kermit being pursued by leading lady Miss Piggy developed.[39]

On _Muppets Tonight_, Kermit was still a main character, although he was the producer rather than frontman. He appeared in many parody sketches such as _NYPD Green_, _City Schtickers_, _Flippers_, and _The Muppet Odd Squad_, as well as in the _Psychiatrist's Office_ sketch.[40]

Kermit also served as the mascot for The Jim Henson Company, until the sale of the Muppet characters to Disney.[41] A Kermit puppet can be seen at the National Museum of American History.[42]

Kermit appears in _Muppet*Vision 3D_, an attraction that opened in 1991 at Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The character was formerly featured at the attraction version in Disney California Adventure Park, at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, until its closure in 2014. Kermit also appears at the Magic Kingdom at _The Muppets Present...Great Moments in American History_. He also appeared in two parades; Disney Stars and Motor Cars Parade held at Disney's Hollywood Studios until 2008 and Disney's Honorary VoluntEars Cavalcade that was held during 2010 at the Magic Kingdom and Disneyland.

Cultural impact

Awards and commemorations

]] Kermit was awarded an honorary doctorate of Amphibious Letters on May 19, 1996, at Southampton College, New York, where he also gave a commencement speech.[45] He is also the only "amphibian" to have had the honor of addressing the Oxford Union.[46][47] A statue of Henson and Kermit was erected on the campus of Henson's alma mater, the University of Maryland, College Park in 2003.

Kermit was also given the honor of being the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade in 1996. The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade has featured a Kermit balloon since 1977.[48]

On November 14, 2002, Kermit the Frog received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The star is located at 6801 Hollywood Blvd.[49]

On Kermit's 50th birthday in 2005, the United States Postal Service released a set of new stamps with photos of Kermit and some of his fellow Muppets on them.[50] The background of the stamp sheet features a photo of a silhouetted Henson sitting in a window well, with Kermit sitting in his lap looking at him.

Kermit was also the grand marshal for Michigan State University's homecoming parade in 2006.[51]

In 2013, the original Kermit puppet from _Sam and Friends_ was donated to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. for display in the pop culture gallery.[52] In 2015, the Leland Chamber of Commerce in Leland, Mississippi opened a small museum containing puppets and memorabilia dedicated to Kermit.[53]

Kermit's legacy is also deeply entrenched in the science community. One of the famous WP-3D _Orion_ research platforms flown by the NOAA Hurricane Hunters is named after Kermit. The other is named after Miss Piggy.[54] In 2015, the discovery of the Costa Rican glass frog _Hyalinobatrachium dianae_ also attracted viral media attention due to the creature's perceived resemblance to Kermit, with researcher Brian Kubicki quoted as saying "I am glad that this species has ended up getting so much international attention, and in doing so it is highlighting the amazing amphibians that are native to Costa Rica and the need to continue exploring and studying the country's amazing tropical forests".[55]

Guest television appearances

Kermit has made numerous guest appearances on popular television shows, including co-hosting individual episodes of a number of long-running talk shows. On April 2, 1979, Kermit guest-hosted _The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson_ to promote _The Muppet Movie_.[56] From 1983 to 1995, the French political satire show _Le Bébête Show_ used copies of various Muppets to parody key political figures, and Kermit renamed "Kermitterrand", embodied President François Mitterrand.[57] On May 21, 2018, Kermit and contestant Maddie Poppe performed "Rainbow Connection" live on American Idol.

As an April Fool's joke, Kermit hosted CNN's _Larry King Live_ in 1994 and interviewed Hulk Hogan.[58][59] Kermit was also a semi-regular during various incarnations of _Hollywood Squares_,[60] with other Muppets such as Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch also making appearances on the original _Hollywood Squares_.

Merchandising

Jim Henson's characters, including the Muppets, have inspired merchandise internationally, with Chris Bensch, chief curator of Rochester, New York's The Strong National Museum of Play, reporting "There seems to have been a particular craze for Kermit the Frog in Japan," likely due to the "cuteness appeal".[61] Baby Kermit plush toys became popular in the 1980s after the success of _Muppet Babies._[62] In 1991, one year after Jim Henson died, merchandise featuring Kermit and other Muppet characters was being sold at Disney theme parks, causing Henson Associates to file a lawsuit against Disney for copyright infringement. Henson alleged that the "counterfeit merchandise" falsely indicated that the characters belonged to Disney, although the latter company had the right to exercise use of the characters due to an earlier licensing agreement.[63] The Henson Associates highlighted a T-shirt displaying Kermit, the Disney brand, and a copyright symbol. Disney representative Erwin Okun said the lawsuit was "outrageous" and "an unfortunate break with the legacy of a fine relationship with Disney that Jim Henson left behind".[64] Disney later acquired the Muppets, and thusly, clothes, toys and souvenirs depicting Kermit and the Muppets continued to be sold at Disney theme parks and stores.[65]

The Leland Chamber of Commerce's small Kermit-themed museum set out to preserve some of the dolls and merchandise.[66] In 2016, _The New Zealand Herald_reported a hat featuring Kermit sipping Lipton tea, associated with the "But That's None of My Business" Internet meme, became a popular seller[67] after basketball player LeBron James drew attention for wearing one.[68]

Kermit in Internet culture

In March 2007, _Sad Kermit_, an unofficial parody, was uploaded to the website YouTube, showing a store-bought Kermit puppet performing a version of the Nine Inch Nails song "Hurt" in a style similar to Johnny Cash's famous cover version. In contrast to the real Kermit character's usual family-friendly antics, the video shows the puppet engaging in drug abuse, smoking, alcoholism, performing oral sex on Rowlf the Dog, smashing a picture of Miss Piggy (with a breast exposed) and attempting suicide. The video became an Internet meme. The _Victoria Times Colonist_ called it an "online sensation".[69] The _Chicago Sun-Times_ said it "puts the high in 'Hi-ho!'"[70] The _London Free Press_ said "Sad Kermit is in a world of pain".[71] The _Houston Press_ described it as the "world's most revolting web phenomenon".[72] SF Weekly described the unauthorized video as "ironic slandering".[73] Clips have been featured on the Canadian television series _The Hour_, where host George Stroumboulopoulos speculated that the Kermit version of "Hurt" was inspired by the Cash version rather than that of Nine Inch Nails.[74]

Kermit has also appeared in a popular meme in which he is shown sipping tea, "one used when you sassily point something out, and then slyly back away, claiming that it's not [your] business".[75] The photo is taken from "Be More Kermit," a Lipton advertisement that aired in 2014, and was adapted into the "But That's None of My Business" meme by African American comedians on the Tumblr blog Kermit the Snitch, making appearances on Twitter, Instagram[76] and Facebook.[77] Charles Pulliam-Moore of the TV station _Fusion_ praised "But That's None of My Business" as "a symbol for the comedic brilliance born out of black communities on the internet,"[78] but Stephanie Hayes of _Bustle_ magazine slammed the memes as racist and obscene.[79]

In 2016, a _Good Morning America_ post on Twitter referred to "But That's None of My Business" as "Tea Lizard," becoming the subject of viral online derision. _New York_ magazine replied that, "Kermit is a frog. A frog is an amphibian. A lizard is a reptile. It's just so insulting. Beyond a frog and a lizard both being clearly ectothermic, they couldn't be any more different. Not all green things are the same, you ignorant bastards".[80] _Popular Science_ also addressed the misnomer, writing "Frogs, which are amphibians, have quite a few significant differences from reptiles in how they breathe, their life cycles, whether they have scales or not... there's a lot to absorb here".[81]

In November 2016, a new meme surfaced of Kermit talking to a hooded version of himself which represents the self and its dark inner thoughts. It involves captioning of a screenshot taken from the _Muppets Most Wanted_ movie of Kermit and Constantine looking at each other.[82]
