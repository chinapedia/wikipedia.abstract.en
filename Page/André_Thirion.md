ANDRÉ THIRION (14 July 1907 – 4 January 2001) was a French writer, a member of the group of surrealists, a theorist and political activist.


Biography

After becoming a trade unionist, he turned to communism, a party he joined in 1925. His character led him to the group of surrealists he joined in 1928.[1] A friend of Louis Aragon and Georges Sadoul, he participated in the activities of the Surrealists between 1928 and 1934. His photograph composes the framework of the work of René Magritte, _Je ne vois pas la [femme] cachée dans la forêt_ (1928); He appears in tenth position, starting in a clockwise direction from the upper left corner. In November 1930, with André Breton, he draught the statutes of the "A.A.E.R." (_Association des artistes et écrivains révolutionnaires_) which the French Communist Party took over in 1932, changing the acronym to "A.E.A.R." and excluding the surrealists.[2]

Published in 1972, under the title _Révolutionnaires sans révolution_, his testimony constantly "doubles as a critical commentary which revives surrealist thought while at the same time correcting its illusions".[3] He participated to the magazine _Le Surrealisme au service de la revolution_, supported the film _L'Âge d'or_ by Luis Buñuel[4] and Salvador Dalí.[5] He moved away from communism during the 1930s. He campaigned against Aragon during his departure from Surrealism to the French Communist Party in 1932.[6]

During the Second World War, he incorporated the Gaullist resistance[7] and became a MP for the Rassemblement du peuple français at the Liberation of France.[8]


Work

His work is divided into two groups: the first consists of autobiographical works; The other of political and erotic novels. _Révolutionnaires sans revolution_ is the main work of the first group. It is an autobiography that relates this period and analyzes the group of surrealists.[9]
