Life

Born in Suure-Jaani, Estonia, Villem Kapp was the son of Hans Kapp who was a sacristan, teacher and choir director.

Villem Kapp graduated in 1938, having studied organ with August Topman and again in 1944 having studied composition with Heino Eller. In addition, Kapp studied with his uncle Artur Kapp at the Tallinn Conservatory.

From 1938 Kapp was the organist in Tartu where he ran many famous choirs. After World War II he worked mainly as a composer and taught composition at the State Conservatory of Tallinn from 1944 until his untimely death in 1964. His students included Helmut Rosenvald, Lembit Veevo, Ülo Vinter, Veljo Tormis, Harri Otsa and others.

Villem Kapp's works are characterized by rich melodies and he is strongly connected to the national romantic movement. In 1950, Kapp was awarded the State Prize of the Estonian SSR and, in 1963, he was awarded the People's Artist of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic.[1]

In 1971 a museum was opened in Suure-Jaani dedicated to the life and work of the Kapp family musicians, including Kapp, his uncle Artur Kapp and his cousin Eugen Kapp.

The ancient Sakala County included the areas where Kapp grew up, so the themes were particularly close to his heart.[2]
