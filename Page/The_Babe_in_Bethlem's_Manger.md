upright=1 (1925)]] "THE BABE IN BETHLEM'S MANGER", also called "THE BABE IN BETHLEHEM'S MANGER LAID", "OLD KENTISH CAROL"[1] and "THE SAVIOUR'S WORK",[2] is an anonymous English folk Christmas carol celebrating the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem.


History

The writer of the carol is not known. However, the lyrics are traditionally described as being a traditional folk hymn from the English county of Kent.[3] However Erik Routley noted that its composition was "very much of the 18th century".[4] It was first published in print in 1871[5] by the Church of England's Reverend Henry Ramsden Bramley and hymn writer John Stainer in _Christmas Carols New and Old_.[6] Bramley included the commonly used tune for the carol.[7] Christopher Chope's 1894 _Carols for use in Church_ attributed the words as being Kentish, which was later confirmed by R R Terry in 1923 in his _Old Christmas Carols_ anthology.[8] The carol later passed into North America and was later published in the Evangelical Lutheran Church's _Wartburg Hymnal_ in 1918.[9] In 1960, it was published in the Church of Ireland's _The Church Hymnal_.[10]

A critical analysis of the hymn notes that the refrain is intended to provoke thought about the difference in people's lives without Jesus and then the later redemption through Jesus.[11]


Music

Several composers have also written music for "The Babe in Bethlem's Manger". In 1964, an optional obbligato for flute was copyrighted in the United States by Theron Kirk.[12] In 1973, in one of his last works before his death, British composer Patrick Hadley wrote a piece of music for the carol so it could be performed in his Lent cantata.[13]
