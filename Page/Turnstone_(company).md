TURNSTONE is an office furniture company based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It is a division of Steelcase and was founded in 1993.[1] The brand was created with the intention of reaching younger businesses with budgets too small to afford a dedicated facilities manager and offices with a small number of in-office employees.[2][3] As of January 2006, the company employed 30 people.[4]


Company overview

Turnstone's products are designed to meet the needs of small businesses, startup companies, and entrepreneurs.[5][6] Initially, turnstone also focused on supplying the home-office market.[7] Between 2002 and 2006, turnstone launched over 40 new products.[8]

One aspect of Turnstone's product development process involves meeting with business leaders and uses observational research from the IIT Institute of Design, IDEO, and the d.school at Stanford University.[9] They also visit co-working spaces to study how workers interact with their products.[10]

Turnstone also researches and studies subjects like startup culture, company culture, and how people work.[11][12] In 2013, Turnstone partnered with the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania to release a list of the 15 top young companies to work for.[13]

James Hackett became President of turnstone in 1993.[14] Kevin Kuske was turnstone's general manager from 2009 to 2014.[15] Brian Shapland became turnstone's general manager in the spring of 2014.[16]
