The BOOCH METHOD[1] is a method for object-oriented software development. It is composed of an object modeling language,[2] an iterative object-oriented development process,[3] and a set of recommended practices.[4]

The method was authored by Grady Booch when he was working for Rational Software (acquired by IBM), published in 1992 and revised in 1994. It was widely used in software engineering for object-oriented analysis and design and benefited from ample documentation and support tools.[5]

The notation aspect of the Booch method was superseded by the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which features graphical elements from the Booch method along with elements from the object-modeling technique (OMT) and object-oriented software engineering (OOSE). Methodological aspects of the Booch method have been incorporated into several methodologies and processes, the primary such methodology being the Rational Unified Process (RUP).


Content of the method

The Booch notation is characterized by cloud shapes to represent classes and distinguishes the following diagrams:[6]

  Model      Type      Diagram                    UML correspondence
  ---------- --------- -------------------------- ---------------------
  Logical    Static    Class diagram              Class diagram
                       Object diagram             Object diagram
             Dynamic   State transition diagram   State chart diagram
                       Interaction diagram        Sequence diagram
  Physical   Static    Module diagram             Component diagram
                       Process diagram            Deployment diagram

The process is organized around a macro and a micro process.[7]

The macro process identifies the following activities cycle:

-   Conceptualization : establish core requirements
-   Analysis : develop a model of the desired behavior
-   Design : create an architecture
-   Evolution: for the implementation
-   Maintenance : for evolution after the delivery

The micro process is applied to new classes, structures or behaviors that emerge during the macro process. It is made of the following cycle:

-   Identification of classes and objects
-   Identification of their semantics
-   Identification of their relationships
-   Specification of their interfaces and implementation
