_NAKED NEWS_ is a Canadian news and entertainment program owned by Naked Broadcasting Network. It features naked women reading news bulletins derived from news wires.[1] The show's production studio is located in Toronto, Canada. There are 6 new daily programs a week, that run approximately 22-minute in length.[2] The female cast members read the news fully nude or disrobe as they present their various segments,[3] including entertainment, sports, movies, food, sex and relationships. _Naked News TV!_ is an offshoot of the web program and is broadcast on pay TV in various countries around the world.[4][5]

The show often recruits women from around the world, to either appear as guest reporters, or to appear on a regular basis. Their audition feature, where amateur women try out for the program, is one of their most popular segments and generates the most feedback from its viewers. Another segment that generates a lot of interest is called Naked In The Streets. This is where a reporter will go topless in the street and speak to the general public about various topics.


History

_Naked News_ was conceived by Fernando Pereira and Kirby Stasyna and debuted in December 1999[6] as a web-based news service featuring an all-female cast. It began with only one anchor, Victoria Sinclair, who worked for the program until 2015.[7] As the show grew the number of female anchors increased. Roxanne West joined Sinclair as a lead anchor, and other cast members included Holly Weston, Lily Kwan, Sandrine Renard, Erin Sherwood, Athena King, Brooke Roberts, Michelle Pantoliano, Erica Stevens,[8] Samantha Page, Christine Kerr and Valentina Taylor, plus guest anchors. The website was popularized entirely by word of mouth,[9] and quickly became a popular web destination. During the height of its popularity, the website was receiving over six million unique visitors per month.[10][11] In the site's early days the entire newscast could be viewed for free online.[12] The site was initially supported by advertising but this changed after the collapse of Internet advertising that occurred with the dot-com crash. By 2002 only one news segment could be viewed freely,[13] and by 2004, no free content remained on the website.[14] Beginning in 2005, a nudity-free version of _Naked News_ was available to non-subscribers. Beginning in June 2008, two news segments could be viewed freely. However, this ended in December 2009.

Following the success of _The Naked Truth_, a similar show on Russian television, _Naked News_ launched _Naked News TV!_, the first Internet news program to successfully transfer from website to cable television. It was initially broadcast on Viewers Choice in Canada in 2001,[15] and was first broadcast in the United States a few months later by the iN DEMAND cable TV service on its Too Much for TV pay-per-view network that also included Girls Gone Wild. In 2002 it was broadcast in Australia on The Comedy Channel via cable and satellite television platforms Foxtel and Austar.[16] The British channel Sumo TV briefly showed episodes of _Naked News_, while the free-to-view Playboy One broadcast the show at 9:30pm Mondays-Fridays until its closure in 2008.

_Naked News_ launched a Japanese version of the show in 2006.[17] Japanese broadcasting regulations prohibited the presenters from being fully naked, allowing them only to strip to their underwear.[18] In 2007 the Japanese government changed broadcasting guidelines to prevent the show receiving a subsidy for the section delivered in sign language.[19]

A male version of the show ran from 2001 until 2007.[20] It was created to parallel the female version, but ceased production as it did not enjoy the female version's popularity and fame. Although it was originally targeted towards female viewers (at one point said to be 30% of the website's audience), the male show later promoted itself as news from a queer perspective.


In the media

In 2013 the _Naked News_ show was the subject of an eight-part documentary series called _Naked News Uncovered_ which was broadcast on Super Channel in Canada.[21]

The female announcers have been featured in almost every medium including television (_CBS Sunday Morning_, _The Today Show_, _The View_, _Sally Jessy Raphaël_, and numerous appearances on _Entertainment Tonight_ and _ET Insider_), newspapers and magazines (_TV Guide_, _Playboy_), and as guests on multiple radio shows, including Howard Stern.


Similar shows

In the late 1990s, British cable television channel L!VE TV broadcast _Tiffani's Big City Tips_, in which model Tiffani Banister gave the financial news while stripping to her underwear.[22]

Imitators

-   _Comédie+_ – In 2001, this French cable TV network ran a series promos featuring males and females casually undressing as they read jokes. In 2006 they copied the _Naked News_ format in its entirety in a striptease newscast called _Les Nuz_, except the anchors keep their bottom underwear on.
-   Radio Tango – In 2001 this radio station based in Oslo, Norway began featuring stripping female weather readers in their broadcasts and on their website.[23]
-   A very similar phenomenon by the name "Noodie News" appears in Canadian Margaret Atwood's 2003 novel _Oryx and Crake_.[24][25][26]
-   Počasíčko[27] (diminutive of "weather") was Czech TV Nova's past-10PM featurette launched in January 1998 where a nude woman (or occasionally, a man) got dressed in clothing appropriate for the next day's weather forecast.[28] This was discontinued after several years and returned as web-only in February 2007. When Nova launched a new online portal in May 2008, it included a "Red News"[29] section causing controversy; asked about the _Naked News_, they denied securing license and stressed Počasíčko's primacy.
-   In June 2009 plans for _Naked News Korea_ were announced. It featured a similar format to the Canadian version but with less nudity. This was later revealed to be a scam. After barely a month of operations, _Naked News Korea_, which featured topless news anchors, abruptly closed down amid allegations that the CEO, John Chau, disappeared with all of the company's money. Although Chau bought the naming rights from the _Naked News_, it was never an official subsidiary of the Toronto-based Canadian company.[30][31]
-   In March 2010, students at the University of Cambridge presented a news segment on _Cambridge University Television_ in the nude.[32]
-   French spoof news site _Les Graves Infos_ (Serious News) was launched in mid-2009 with a stripping weather girl.[33] The site closed in February 2010.[34]
-   In June 2014, a very similar show was released in Venezuela called _Desnudando La Noticia_ (Stripping The News) which is a variant of _Naked News_.[35]
-   In Portugal, a five-minute news bulletin fronted by a naked woman, titled _Nutícias_, premiered on April 22, 2002 on cable station SIC Radical. The show got canceled in 2003.
-   A Finnish copy of the _Naked News_ concept was broadcast on the country's Aluetelevisio cable television channel. The show employed the erotic actress Maria Kekkonen as a reporter and the former pornographic actress Rakel Liekki also worked for the show.

Parodies

-   A 2005 episode of the satirical New Zealand news show _Eating Media Lunch_ depicted newsreaders fornicating in a parody of _Naked News_ called "Fuck News".[36]
