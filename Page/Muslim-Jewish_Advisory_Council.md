The MUSLIM-JEWISH ADVISORY COUNCIL is an interfaith, bipartisan collaboration convened by the American Jewish Committee and the Islamic Society of North America in early fall 2016. Its 42 members are business, religious, and political leaders from all over the United States. The Council focuses its public policy advocacy on reversing the rise in hate crimes based on religion in the United States. Despite the little controversy between the two founding organizations about Israel,[1] their overlapping concern was deemed more important. The council's action includes creating "a coordinated strategy to address anti-Muslim bigotry and anti-Semitism" and to "protect and expand the rights of religious minorities" in the United States.[2][3]

The co-chairs of the council are Stanley Bergman, the CEO of Henry Schein,[4] and Farooq Kathwari, the CEO of Ethan Allen. Our two communities share much in common and should find ways, where possible, to work together for the benefit of the entire country, said Bergman; The Council aims to provide a model for civic engagement by two communities, vital to American society, that agree to work together on issues of common concern and overlapping interest -Kathwari. The creator of the Council and its director is Robert J. Silverman, who lead Muslim-Jewish engagement at AJC. He began discussions with American Muslim friends in the summer of 2016, selected the members of the Council, and chairs its policy sub-committee.

On November 2016 the Islamic Society of North America and the American Jewish committee launched their first meeting. The council has decided to focus its advocacy brings together CEOs and council members of each group to meet and get to know each other as well as discuss the group's mission and goals as a new council.[5]


Goals

3.  "To work to protect and expand the rights of religious minorities in the U.S., as enshrined in the Constitution, so they may practice their faiths in full freedom and security."[6]
