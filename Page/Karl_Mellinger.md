KARL MELLINGER (26 November 1858, in Mainz – 21 May 1917, in Basel) was a German-Swiss ophthalmologist.

Up until 1883 he studied medicine at the universities of Zürich and Basel, and afterwards worked as an assistant to ophthalmologists Johann Friedrich Horner in Zürich and Karl Stellwag von Carion at the University of Vienna.

In 1896 he became an associate professor and successor to Heinrich Schiess-Gemuseus as head of the university eye clinic.
