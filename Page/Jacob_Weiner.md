JACOB WEINER (born ROBERT MILTON WEINER; 1947 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American plant ecologist at the University of Copenhagen. Weiner has made contributions to several areas of plant ecology, including competition, allocation, allometry and application of ecological knowledge to agricultural production.


Major Contributions

Much of Weiner’s work has focused on understanding variation in size and allometry among plants using models and experiments (1-4). During the 90’s, Weiner developed the highly influential concept of size-asymmetric competition, the (per unit size) differences in resource uptake between large and small individuals its consequences (5, 6). In addition, Weiner has demonstrated how size-asymmetric competition and evolutionary theory can be applied to increase weed suppression in agriculture (7, 8).


Prizes and awards

Weiner was in the first group of ISI Highly-Cited Researchers[1] and was named Distinguished Fellow of the Botanical Society of America in 2016[2]
