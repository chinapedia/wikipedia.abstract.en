HERMANN SCHACHT (15 July 1814, in Ochsenwerder – 20 August 1864, in Bonn) was a German pharmacist and botanist, who specialized in the fields of plant anatomy and embryology.

Prior to 1847 he worked at pharmacies in Braunschweig, Hamburg, Emmerich, Aachen and Altona, where he worked closely with hepaticologist Carl Moritz Gottsche. In the meantime, he attended classes at the University of Jena (1841–42), where from 1847 he served as assistant to Matthias Jakob Schleiden.[1]

In 1850 he obtained his PhD from Jena, and subsequently moved to Berlin, where in 1853–60 he worked as a university lecturer. Because of health problems he spent two years in Madeira (1855–57), conducting investigations of the island's flora during his convalescence. From 1860 to 1864 he was a professor of botany and director of the botanical garden at the University of Bonn.[2][3]

In 1859 Gustav Karl Wilhelm Hermann Karsten named the plant genus _Schachtia_ (family Rubiaceae) in his honor.[4]
