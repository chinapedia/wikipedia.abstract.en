April_Olrich.jpg APRIL OLRICH (17 July 1931 – 15 April 2014), born EDITH APRIL OELRICHS, was an English ballerina and actress, born in Tanzania.


Early life

Edith April Oelrichs was born in Zanzibar in 1931 (some sources give 1933), where her father was a British diplomat. She also lived in the Seychelles and Uruguay while she was growing up. She trained as a ballerina in Buenos Aires at the Teatro Colón, and in New York with George Balanchine.[1]


Career

Olrich joined the Royal Ballet in 1949 under Ninette de Valois. She danced with The Royal Ballet in London from 1950 to 1954, in _The Sleeping Beauty_, _Les Sylphides_, _Coppélia_ , _Façade_, _Mam'zelle Angot_, _Swan Lake_, _Cinderella_, _Checkmate_, _A Wedding Bouquet_, _Apparitions_, _A Mirror for Witches_, _Bonne-bouche_, _Ballet Imperial_, _Giselle_, _Don Juan_, _The Three-Cornered Hat_, _Job_, _Daphnis and Chloe_, _Ballabile_, _Veneziana_, _Homage to the Queen_, _Tiresias_, and _Les Patineurs_.[2]

After her ballet career, she remained on the London stage as a performer. Olrich appeared in _Pay the Piper_ (1954-1955), _The Balcony_ (1957), _Honeymoon_ (1957), the musical _The Boys from Syracuse_ (1963), and the South African folk revue _Wait a Minim!_ (1964-1966). She accompanied _Wait a Minim!_ to Broadway from 1966 to 1967. In New York, she won the Whitbread Anglo-American Theatre Award for Outstanding Musical Performance.[3] Theatre critic Frank Rich (then a Harvard undergraduate) admired Olrich's appearance, saying, "Then there is April Olrich, who dances and, when she has nothing else to do, just stands facing the audience flashing a pair of large, sparkling eyes. The eyes are part of a body which also seems to throw off a few sparks from time to time."[4]

She also appeared in films including _Women without Men_ (1956), _Battle of the River Plate_ (aka _Pursuit of the Graf Spee_) (1957)[5] _Kill Me Tomorrow_ (1957), _Room at the Top_ (1959), _Deadly Record_ (1959), _The Intelligence Men_ (1965), _The Skull_ (1966), _Clinic Exclusive_ (1972), _Keep It Up Downstairs_ (1976), _Riding High_ (1981), and _Supergirl_ (1984). She was a game-show panelist on television in _Whodunnit?_ (1976). She was in an episode of _The Avengers_ in 1963, and in 1985 she acted in _Fresh Fields_.[6]


Personal life

April Olrich married English actor (and her co-star in _Wait a Minim!_) Nigel Pegram in 1968, in San Francisco. She died in 2014, in London, aged 82.[7]

There is an annual APRIL OLRICH AWARD FOR DYNAMIC PERFORMANCE, given at the Royal Ballet School in her memory.[8]
