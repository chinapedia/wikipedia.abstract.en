SPAGHETTI (; sing. _spaghetto_) is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta.[1] _Spaghettoni_ is a thicker form of spaghetti, while _capellini_ is a very thin spaghetti. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. Authentic Italian spaghetti is made from durum wheat semolina, but elsewhere it may be made with other kinds of flour.[2] Usually the pasta is white because refined flour is used, but whole wheat flour may be added.

Originally, spaghetti was notably long, but shorter lengths gained in popularity during the latter half of the 20th century and now it is most commonly available in lengths. A variety of pasta dishes are based on it, and it is frequently served with tomato sauce or meat or vegetables.


Etymology

_Spaghetti_ is the plural form of the Italian word _spaghetto_, which is a diminutive of _spago_, meaning "thin string" or "twine".[3]


History

The first written record of pasta comes from the Talmud in the 5th century AD and refers to dried pasta that could be cooked through boiling,[4] which was conveniently portable.[5]

The popularity of spaghetti spread throughout Italy after the establishment of spaghetti factories in the 19th century, enabling the mass production of spaghetti for the Italian market.[6]

In the United States around the end of the 19th century, spaghetti was offered in restaurants as _Spaghetti Italienne_ (which likely consisted of noodles cooked past _al dente_, and a mild tomato sauce flavored with easily found spices and vegetables such as cloves, bay leaves, and garlic) and it was not until decades later that it came to be commonly prepared with oregano or basil.[7][8][9]


Ingredients

Spaghetti is made from ground grain (flour) and water.[10] Whole-wheat and multigrain spaghetti are also available.[11]


Production

Fresh spaghetti

At its simplest, spaghetti can be formed using no more than a rolling pin and a knife. A home pasta machine simplifies the rolling and makes the cutting more uniform. Fresh spaghetti would normally be cooked within hours of being formed. Commercial versions of 'fresh' spaghetti are manufactured.[12]

Dried spaghetti

The bulk of dried spaghetti is produced in factories using auger extruders. While essentially simple, the process requires attention to detail to ensure that the mixing and kneading of the ingredients produces a homogeneous mix, without air bubbles. The forming dies have to be water cooled to prevent spoiling of the pasta by overheating. Drying of the newly formed spaghetti has to be carefully controlled to prevent strands sticking together, and to leave it with sufficient moisture so that it is not too brittle. Packaging for protection and display has developed from paper wrapping to plastic bags and boxes.[13]

The measure can portion out 1, 2, 3, or 4 servings based on the diameter of the circle. This spaghetti is an enriched macaroni product made with 100% semolina.


Preparation

Fresh or dry spaghetti is cooked in a large pot of salted, boiling water and then drained in a colander ().

In Italy, spaghetti is generally cooked _al dente_ (Italian for "to the tooth"), fully cooked but still firm to the bite. It may also be cooked to a softer consistency.

_Spaghettoni_ is a thicker spaghetti which takes more time to cook. _Spaghettini_ is a thinner form which takes less time to cook. _Capellini_ is a very thin form of spaghetti (it is also called "angel hair spaghetti" or "angel hair pasta") which cooks very quickly.

Utensils used in spaghetti preparation include the spaghetti scoop and spaghetti tongs.

Serving

Italian cuisine

]]

An emblem of Italian cuisine, spaghetti is frequently served with tomato sauce, which may contain various herbs (especially oregano and basil), olive oil, meat, or vegetables. Other spaghetti preparations include amatriciana or carbonara. Grated hard cheeses, such as Pecorino Romano, Parmesan and Grana Padano, are often sprinkled on top.

International cuisine

In some countries, spaghetti is sold in cans/tins with sauce.

In the United States, it is sometimes served with chili con carne. Unlike in Italy, in other countries spaghetti is often served with Bolognese sauce. with the characteristically sweet and meaty sauce]] In the Philippines, an immensely popular variant is the Filipino spaghetti, which is distinctively sweet with the tomato sauce sweetened with banana ketchup or sugar. It typically uses a large amount of _giniling_ (ground meat), sliced hotdogs, and cheese. The dish dates back to the period between the 1940s to the 1960s. During the American Commonwealth Period, a shortage of tomato supplies in the Second World War forced the development of the banana ketchup.[14][15][16] Spaghetti was introduced by the Americans and was tweaked to suit the local Filipino predilection for sweet dishes.[17]

_Sapaketti phat khi mao_ (Spaghetti fried drunken noodle style) is a popular dish in Thai cuisine.[18]

Consumption

By 1955, annual consumption of spaghetti in Italy doubled from per person before World War II to .[19] By that year, Italy produced 1,432,990 tons of spaghetti, of which 74,000 were exported, and had a production capacity of 3 million tons.[20]
