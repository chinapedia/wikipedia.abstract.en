Synopsis

In the prologue, mobster Lee (Sunny Pang) escapes from prison in a shootout that leaves dozens of prisoners and guards dead.

Two months later, a comatose man of unknown identity (Iko Uwais) is being cared for by Dr Ailin (Chelsea Islan) in a rural hospital on a small island. He awakes, but with no clear memory of how he was injured or even his name. He adopts the name Ishmael from Moby-Dick, which Ailin is reading. He learns he was found on the beach by a man named Romli (Yayu Unru).

Meanwhile, Lee and his henchmen Rika (Julie Estelle) and Besi (Very Tri Yulisman) violently eliminate a rival gang. One of the gang's survivors tells Lee about Ishmael, and Lee sends the man to investigate. Ishmael and the thug have a brief altercation after the man threatens Ailin. Ailin travels to the mainland to seek better care for Ishmael, but her bus is stopped by Lee's men, who are looking for Ishmael (who they call Abdi). They kill every passenger but Ailin and a young girl, whom they kidnap.

Called by Ailin, Ishmael and Romli hurry to the scene of the bus attack. Ishmael kills a few of Lee's thugs who remain at the scene, but Romli is also killed. An Interpol agent tells Ishmael about children kidnapped by Lee's syndicate and bred to be devoted smugglers and criminal enforcers; Ishmael was one of these children. The agent is killed when a group of Lee's killers attacks the police station in an attempt to take out Ishmael/Abdi. Ishmael puts down the attackers instead and escapes.

Ishmael must then go to war with the syndicate to save Ailin. While traveling, he encounters Besi near a well, and it is revealed that he, Rika and Besi trained together. Lee would put children in the well and starve them. After a few days, he would put food in there, and the child who killed all the others to get the food would be freed. Ishmael tries to persuade Besi to not be on Lee's side, but Besi refuses out of loyalty. They soon enter in a fight, and Ishmael gains the upper hand. After Besi dies, Rika finds out and attacks Ishmael.

Ishmael defeats Rika despite multiple wounds from the latter, and it is revealed that Rika was the one who shot Ishmael and gave him memory loss. When Rika holds Ishmael at gunpoint, she can't bring herself to shoot Ishmael again, and instead shoots away from Ishmael, wasting her bullets. In the confusion, Ishmael accidentally deals Rika a mortal injury by reflexively throwing a knife. After comforting her in her dying moments, Ishmael finds Lee's hideout.

Meanwhile, a henchmen is about to rape Ailin, but Ailin and the child fight him off, eventually shooting him with his own rifle. Ishmael and Ailin meet each other, and even though Ailin threatens Ishmael because she was kidnapped due to their relationship, Ishmael convinces her not to, and they embrace. However, Lee arrives, and is enraged that Ishmael killed Rika and Besi, whom he had considered favorite "children." They then enter a brutal fight, with Lee gaining the upper hand due to his strength. However, Ishmael finally beats Lee outside, and impales him on the sharp branch of a tree trunk. In his death throes, Lee is about to kill Ishmael by pulling him closer to the same sharp trunk, but Ailin saves Ishmael. Lee finally succumbs to his wounds, and dies.

In the aftermath, Ailin is recovering in the hospital, with Ishmael wounded severely. However, he wakes up with Ailin by his side, and Ailin smiles.[1]

Reception

Dennis Harvey of _Variety_ wrote that "In terms of sheer, punchy physical vigor, "Headshot" is a knockout."[16] _Headshot_ received 4 out of 5 stars from _The Guardian_, where Wendy Ide called it "the most insanely violent film of the year" and wrote that "Thrilling fight scenes and dizzyingly relentless action elevate this Indonesian adventure to headspinning heights".[17] Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com gave _Headshot_ 2.5 stars of 4, and wrote that "Blood-soaked Indonesian martial arts flick "Headshot" is for anyone who liked "The Bourne Identity," but wished it were way more violent."[18]

Some reviewers considered the film repetitive, excessive, or both. David Ehrlich of IndieWire wrote that the film is a "brutally exhausting bloodbath", saying that "As the movie stretches deep into its second hour, it’s easy to start resenting the fact that everybody gets shot with 20 bullets when one would do."[19] Collider's Matt Goldberg gave the movie "D", criticizing that "a movie that should have been a lean actioner instead runs almost two hours even though it’s just a damsel-in-distress story... Eventually, fight fatigue sets in and we know that the directors aren’t going to do anything to surprise us."[20]
