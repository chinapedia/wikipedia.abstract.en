The LATER GUPTA DYNASTY ruled the Magadha region in eastern India between 6th and 7th centuries. The Later Guptas succeeded the imperial Guptas as the rulers of Magadha, but there is no evidence connecting the two dynasties; these appear to be two distinct families. The Later Guptas are so-called because the names of their rulers ended with the suffix "-gupta", which they might have adopted to portray themselves as the legitimate successors of the imperial Guptas.


History

After the decline of the Gupta Empire, the Later Guptas succeeded them as the rulers of Magadha. The daughter of the dynasty's founder Krishnagupta is said to have married prince Adityavarman of the Maukhari dynasty. According to Apshad inscription, Krishnagupta's grandson Jivitagupta carried out military expeditions in the Himalayan region and southwestern Bengal.

During the reign of Jivitagupta's son Kumaragupta, the dynasty developed a rivalry with the Maukharis. Kumaragupta defeated the Maukhari king Ishanavarman in 554 CE, and died at Prayaga. His son Damodaragupta suffered reverses against the Maukharis.

Damodaragupta's son Mahasenagupta allied with the Vardhana dynasty. His sister married the Vardhana ruler Adityavardhana. He invaded Kamarupa and defeated Susthita Varman. But he subsequently faced three invaders: the Maukhari king Sharva-varman, the Kamarupa king Supratishthita-varman, and the Tibetan king Srong Tsan. His vassal Shashanka also abandoned him (and later established the independent Gauda Kingdom). Under these circumstances, Mahasena-gupta was forced to flee Magadha, and take shelter in Malwa. Subsequently, the Vardhana emperor Harsha restored the Later Gupta rule in Magadha, and they ruled as Harsha's vassals.

After Harsha's death, the Later Gupta ruler Adityasena became the sovereign ruler of a large kingdom extending from the Ganges in the north to the Chhota Nagpur in the south; and from Gomati River in the east to the Bay of Bengal in the west. However, he was defeated by the Chalukyas.

Jivitagupta II, the last known ruler of the dynasty, appears to have been defeated by Yashovarman of Kannauj.
