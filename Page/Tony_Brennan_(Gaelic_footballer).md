ANTHONY "TONY" BRENNAN (born 1944) is an Irish retired Gaelic football selector and former player. His league and championship career with the Meath senior team spanned nine seasons from 1965 until 1973.

Brennan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Meath junior team. He impressed in a number of challenge games and made his senior championship debut during the 1965 championship. Over the course of the next nine seasons, Brennan won one All-Ireland medal in 1967, as well as three Leinster medals.[1] He played his last game for Meath in July 1973.

In retirement from playing, Brennan became involved in team management. He served as a selector with the Meath senior team under the management of Se√°n Boylan and helped steer the team to two All-Ireland titles, five Leinster titles and two National Football League titles in a six-year period.
