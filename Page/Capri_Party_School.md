The CAPRI PARTY SCHOOL was an educational organisation established by the Vperedists, a sub-faction in the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party. It was established by Maxim Gorky, Alexander Bogdanov, Vladimir Bazarov and Anatoly Lunacharsky, with Gorky providing the accommodation and funds essential to enable it to run. Its curriculum primarily reflected the viewpoint of these three founders who were part of the Russian intelligentsia, but hoped to influence Russian workers through the creation of a workers intelligentsia who would in turn develop proletarian culture.[1]

The school was open from August to December, 1909.[2] Nikifor Vilonov was appointed secretary.[3]
