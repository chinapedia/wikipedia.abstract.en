Low-alcohol_beer,_Iran.jpg.]] LOW-ALCOHOL BEER is beer with little or no alcohol content and aims to reproduce the taste of beer without the inebriating effects of standard alcoholic brews. Most low-alcohol beers are lagers, but there are some low-alcohol ales. Low-alcohol beer is also known as LIGHT BEER, NON-ALCOHOLIC BEER, SMALL BEER, SMALL ALE, or NEAR-BEER.

In the United States, beverages containing less than 0.5% alcohol by volume (ABV) were legally called non-alcoholic, according to the now-defunct Volstead Act. Because of its very low alcohol content, non-alcoholic beer may be legally sold to minors in many American states.

In the United Kingdom, Government guidance recommends the following descriptions for "alcohol substitute" drinks including alcohol-free beer. The use of these descriptions is voluntary:[1]

-   No alcohol or alcohol-free: not more than 0.05% ABV
-   Dealcoholized: over 0.05% but less than 0.5% ABV
-   Low-alcohol: not more than 1.2% ABV

In some parts of the European Union, beer must contain no more than 0.5% ABV if it is labelled "alcohol-free".

In Australia, the term "light beer" refers to any beer with less than 3.5% alcohol.

Spain is the main consumer and producer of low-alcohol beer in the European Union.[2]


History

Low-alcoholic brews such as small beer date back at least to Medieval Europe, where they served as a less risky alternative to water (which often was polluted by feces and parasites) and were less expensive than the full strength brews used at festivals.

More recently, the temperance movements and the need to avoid alcohol while driving, operating machinery, etc. led to the development of non-intoxicating beers.

In the United States, non-alcoholic brews were promoted during Prohibition, according to John Naleszkiewicz. In 1917, President Wilson proposed limiting the alcohol content of malt beverages to 2.75% to try to appease avid prohibitionists. In 1919, Congress approved the Volstead Act, which limited the alcohol content of all beverages to 0.5%. These very low alcohol beverages became known as tonics, and many breweries began brewing them in order to stay in business during Prohibition. Since removing the alcohol from the beer requires just one simple extra step, many breweries saw it as an easy change. In 1933, when Prohibition was repealed, breweries easily removed this extra step.[3]

By the 1980s and 1990s, growing concerns about alcoholism led to the growing popularity of "light" beers. In the 2010s, breweries have focused on marketing low-alcohol beers to counter the popularity of homebrew. Declining consumption has also led to the introduction of mass-market non-alcoholic beverages, dubbed as "near beer".

At the start of the 21st century, alcohol-free beer has seen a rise in popularity in the Middle East (which now makes up a third of the market).[4] One reason for this is that Islamic scholars issued fatawa which permitted the consumption of beer as long as large quantities could be consumed without getting drunk.[5]


Pros and cons

Positive features of non-alcoholic brews include the ability to drive after consuming several drinks, the reduction in alcohol-related illness, and less severe hangover symptoms.[6][7]

Some common complaints about non-alcoholic brews include a loss of flavor, addition of one step in the brewing process, sugary taste, and a shorter shelf life. There are also legal implications. Some state governments, e.g. Pennsylvania, prohibit the sale of non-alcoholic brews to persons under the age of 21. A study conducted by the department of psychology at Indiana University said, "Because non-alcoholic beer provides sensory cues that simulate alcoholic beer, this beverage may be more effective than other placebos in contributing to a credible manipulation of expectancies to receive alcohol",[8] making people feel "drunk" when physically they are not.


Categories

Light (reduced alcohol) beer

Light beer is beer with reduced alcohol content and/or calories compared to regular beer. The spelling "lite beer" is also commonly used.

Light beers may be chosen by drinkers who wish to manage their alcohol consumption or their calorie intake. However, these beers are sometimes criticized[9] for being less flavorful than full-strength beers, being "watered down" (whether in perception or in fact), and thus advertising campaigns for light beers generally advertise their retention of flavor.

In Australia, regular beers have approximately 5% ABV; reduced-alcohol beers have 2.2%–3.2%.

In Canada, a reduced-alcohol beer contains 2.6%–4.0% ABV, and an “extra-light” beer contains less than 2.5%.[10]

In the United States, most reduced-alcohol beers, including Bud Light, Coors Light, and Miller Lite, have 4.2% ABV,[11] which is 16% less than beer with 5% ABV.

In Sweden, low alcohol beer is either 2.2%, 2.8% or 3.5%, and can be purchased in an ordinary supermarket whereas normal strength beers of above 3.5% must be purchased at _Systembolaget_. Beer containing 2.8-3.5% ABV (called Folköl or "Peoples' Beer") may be legally sold in any convenience store to people over 18 years of age, whereas stronger beer may only be sold in state-run liquor stores to people older than 20. In addition, businesses selling food for on-premises consumption do not need an alcohol license to serve 3.5% beer. Virtually all major Swedish brewers, and several international ones, in addition to their full-strength beer, make 3.5% folköl versions as well. Beer below or equaling 2.25% ABV (_lättöl_) is not legally subject to age restrictions;[12] however, some stores voluntarily opt out from selling it to minors anyway.[13]

Low-point beer

Low-point beer, which is often known in the United States as "three-two beer" or "3 point 2 brew", is beer that contains 3.2% alcohol by weight (equivalent to about 4% ABV).

The term "low-point beer" is unique to the United States, where some states limit the sale of beer, but beers of this type are also available in countries (such as Sweden and Finland) that tax or otherwise regulate beer according to its alcohol content.

In the United States, 3.2 beer was the highest alcohol content beer allowed to be produced legally for nine months in 1933. As part of his New Deal, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Cullen–Harrison Act that repealed the Volstead Act on March 22, 1933. In December 1933, the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed, negating the federal government's power to regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages, though states retained the power to regulate.[14]

After the repeal of Prohibition, a number of state laws prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors remained in effect. As these were repealed, they were first replaced by laws limiting the maximum alcohol content allowed for sale as 3.2 ABW. As of 2019, the states of Minnesota and Utah permit general establishments such as supermarket chains and convenience stores to sell only low-point beer; in the 2010s, Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma revised state laws to end this practice.[15][16][17][18] In these states, all alcoholic beverages containing more than 3.2% alcohol by weight (ABW) must be sold from state-licensed liquor stores.

Missouri also has a legal classification for low-point beer, which it calls "nonintoxicating beer".[19] Unlike Minnesota and Utah, however, Missouri does not limit supermarket chains and convenience stores to selling only low-point beer. Instead, Missouri's alcohol laws permit grocery stores, drug stores, gas stations, and even "general merchandise stores" (a term that Missouri law does not define) to sell _any_ alcoholic beverage;[20] consequently, 3.2% beer is rarely sold in Missouri.

Near beer

Tourtel_Nearbeer.JPG]] Originally, "near beer" was a term for malt beverages containing little or no alcohol (less than 0.5% ABV), which were mass-marketed during Prohibition in the United States. Near beer could not legally be labeled as "beer" and was officially classified as a "cereal beverage".[21] The public, however, almost universally called it "near beer".

The most popular "near beer" was Bevo, brewed by the Anheuser-Busch company. The Pabst company brewed "Pablo", Miller brewed "Vivo", and Schlitz brewed "Famo". Many local and regional breweries stayed in business by marketing their own near-beers. By 1921, production of near beer had reached over 300 million US gallons (1 billion L) a year (36 L/s).

A popular illegal practice was to add alcohol to near beer. The resulting beverage was known as _spiked beer_ or _needle beer_,[22] so called because a needle was used to inject alcohol through the cork of the bottle or keg.

Food critic and writer Waverley Root described the common American near beer as "such a wishy-washy, thin, ill-tasting, discouraging sort of slop that it might have been dreamed up by a Puritan Machiavelli with the intent of disgusting drinkers with genuine beer forever."[23]

Beginning in the late 2000s, the term "near beer" has been revived to refer to modern non-alcoholic beer. In the early 2010s, major breweries began experimenting with mass-market non-alcoholic beers to counter with declining alcohol consumption amid growing preference for craft beer, launching beverages like Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser Prohibition Brew, launched in 2016.

A drink similar to "near beer", "bjórlíki" was quite popular in Iceland before alcoholic beer was made legal in 1989. The Icelandic variant normally consisted of a shot of vodka added to a half-a-litre glass of light beer.

Small beer

SMALL BEER (also, SMALL ALE) is a beer/ale that contains very little alcohol. Sometimes unfiltered and porridge-like, it was a favored drink in Medieval Europe and colonial North America as opposed to the often polluted water and the expensive beer used for festivities. Small beer was also produced in households for consumption by children and servants at those occasions.

However, small beer/small ale can also refer to a beer made of the "second runnings" from a very strong beer (e.g., scotch ale) mash. These beers can be as strong as a mild ale, depending on the strength of the original mash. (Drake's 24th Anniversary Imperial Small Beer was expected to reach above 9.5% abv.[24]) This was done as an economy measure in household brewing in England up to the 18th century and is still done by some homebrewers. One commercial brewery, San Francisco's Anchor Brewing Company, also produces their _Anchor Small Beer_ using the second runnings from their Old Foghorn Barleywine. The term is also used derisively for commercially produced beers which are thought to taste too weak.

Non-alcoholic beer

0.00_ABV_beers.jpg The Middle East accounts for almost a third of worldwide sales of nonalcoholic and alcohol-free beer.[25]

Arab world

Notable Islamic clerics in Saudi Arabia and Egypt have issued fatawa permitting the consumption of "alcohol-free" beers that can be proven to contain zero traces of alcohol. Alcohol-free beers such as Holsten, Barbican and Moussy are often available in stores and restaurants throughout the Arab world.

Malaysia

The market for nonalcoholic beer in Malaysia has been slow in comparison to other Muslim-majority countries, and as of 2015, the Malaysian government has not approved any nonalcoholic beers as halal.[26]

Iran

In 2008, the sale of non-alcoholic beers in Iran continued its high performance with double-digit growth rates in both value and volume and is expected to more than double its total volume sales between 2008 and 2013.[27]

India

Non alcoholic beer sales in India are relatively low. One major upcoming player is 'COOLBERG' which offers multiple flavors suitable to the tastes of Indian consumers.COOLBERG is the India's First Crafted Zero Alcohol Beer.

North America

North America is seeing a rise in craft non-alcoholic beer production.


Craft Non-Alcoholic Beer

With the global non-alcoholic beer market expected to double by 2024^([1]), there has been an increase in breweries producing the product. As more people lean towards non-alcoholic beverages for health reasons, social reasons, or just because they want to enjoy the taste of beer without the effects of alcohol, companies are producing beers that pander to these audiences^([2]).

History

Craft Non-Alcoholic Beer began to take off in early 2018, as beer companies slowed down on trying to put as high of an ABV% in their brews as possible, and started producing more sessionable beers. Some beers that are still classified as "alcoholic" can have an ABV of as low as 2.4%, and the companies producing these are still seeing sales ^([3]).

With an ever growing health conscious market segment, breweries began to produce craft non-alcoholic beers with as little as 10 calories per can, so that those who crave beer can fulfill their cravings without breaking their health resolution.

Surreal Brewing Company

Health & Wellness are at the forefront of this innovative California brewer who creates a craft non-alcoholic beer in 4 different flavors: Chandelier Red IPA (Gold Medal at the World Beer Awards), 17 Mile Porter, Juicy Mavs Hazy IPA, and Natural Bridges Kolsch. All of Surreal's beers are crafted using all natural ingredients, non-GMO grains, and a wholesome brewing process that allows the yeast to create marvelous esters and phenols, minerals and B vitamins, & flavors and aromas. Surreal Brewing was recently cited across multiple publications such as: CNN Business, Thrillest, and the NY Times among many other publications.[28]

Partake Brewing

Partake Brewing is a Canadian craft non-alcoholic brewery who currently produces an IPA, a Pale, a Stout, and a Blonde Ale that are marketed and sold in both Canada and the United States. Their Pale Ale was awarded the Gold Medal at the World Beer Awards. Their beers contain 10 calories per can and are targeted towards those with health risks associated with drinking regular alcohol, those on varying diets, and those who enjoy the social connection of drinking, but not the affects of alcohol[29]

Clausthaler Classic

Clausthaler Classic uses a different technology in their non-alcoholic beer than most breweries, where instead of trying to take the alcohol out, they brew a beer that doesn't have any alcohol in the first place^([4]). Clausthaler offers classic, unfiltered, lemon, and dry hopped styles[30].

Hill Street Craft Brewed Lager

Hill Street Craft Brewed Lager promotes going alcohol free for a month by offering discounts on their website. They currently only offer a lager in their beer section, but other things the company produces include cannabis infused beer[31]. PartakePaleAle.png


Legal drinking age in the US

Beers that are labeled "non-alcoholic" still contain a very small amount of alcohol. Thus, some US states require the purchaser to be of a legal drinking age. Exceptions include:

-   In Texas, the law does not prohibit minors from consuming or buying non-alcoholic beer, but the law does specify that a beverage containing more than one half of one percent alcohol by volume is an alcoholic beverage and thus will follow the same restrictions as regular beer.[32]
-   In Minnesota, non alcoholic beer (under 0.5% ABV) does not fit in the category that the state defines as an alcoholic beverage and can be purchased by those under the legal drinking age.[33]
-   In Wisconsin, the law does not regulate non-alcoholic beer (less than 0.5% ABV), and it can be purchased without any age restriction.
-   In New Jersey, the law governs only beverages of at least 0.5% ABV.
-   In Illinois, beverages with under 0.5% ABV are not governed by the Illinois Liquor Control Act and can be purchased and consumed by minors.[34]
-   In the District of Columbia, the District's alcohol laws apply to all beverages and food products that have an alcohol by volume equal or greater than .5 percent. Beverages below .5 percent are not covered by the laws that ABRA regulates; therefore, a beverage with an ABV lower than .5 percent may purchased by a person under the age of 21. The laws and regulations that ABRA administers does not reference products carrying the label of "non-alcoholic beverage."
-   In Alaska, "...non-alcoholic beer and wine (containing less than 0.5% alcohol by volume) are not considered alcoholic beverages. Legally, non-alcoholic beer and wine are no different than coffee, tea, or soft drinks."[35]
-   In Hawaii, Hawaii State Liquor Law §281-101.5(b) states “No minor shall consume or purchase liquor and no minor shall consume or have liquor in the minor’s possession...” In the “Liquor Laws of Hawaii” under §281-1 “Definitions”, Liquor is defined as “…containing one-half of one per cent or more of alcohol by volume…”


Brewing process

According to the Birmingham Beverage Company, the brewing process of traditional brews consists of eight basic steps, nine for brewing non-alcoholic brews.[36]

1.  Malting – Barley is prepared by soaking it in water and allowing the grain to germinate or "sprout". This allows the tough starch molecules to be softened and begin conversion to sugars. Next, the sprouts are dried in a kiln; the temperature at which the sprouts are dried will affect the flavor of the finished brew.
2.  Milling – Next the malted grain is ground to a cornmeal-like consistency, which allows the sugars and remaining starches to be more easily released when mixed with water.
3.  Mashing – The finely-ground malted grain is mixed with water and pulverized. By pulverizing the slurry, most of the remaining starches are converted to sugars due to enzymes present in the malt, and the sugars then dissolve into the water. The mix is gradually heated to in what is called a mash tun. The slurry is then filtered to remove the majority of particulates. This filtered sugary liquid is called "wort".
4.  Brewing – The wort is brought to a boil for roughly 1–2 hours. During this time, other grains that will contribute flavor, color, and aroma to the brew are added. Boiling allows several chemical reactions to occur and reduces the water content in the wort, condensing it.
5.  Cooling – The wort is filtered to remove the majority of the grains and hops and then immediately cooled to allow the yeast to survive and grow in the next step.
6.  Fermenting – The cooled wort is saturated with air, and yeast is added in the fermentation tank. Different strains of yeast will create different styles of beer. This step takes around ten days.
7.  Maturation – The freshly fermented uncarbonated beer is placed into a conditioning tank and, in a similar process to wine making, is allowed to age. If this step is rushed the beer will have an off flavor (acetaldehyde) that beer experts sometimes refer to as "green beer" because of its resemblance to green apples.[37][38] During this process of aging, the majority of the residual particulates will settle to the bottom of the tank.
    * Between the seventh and eighth steps, the brew can be converted to non-alcoholic beer.
8.  Finishing – Finally, the brewer is ready to finish the beer. The beer is filtered one last time; it is then carbonated and moved into a storage tank for either bottling or kegging.

How low-alcohol beer is made

Low-alcohol beer starts out as regular alcoholic beer, which is then cooked in order to evaporate the alcohol. This is possible because alcohol is more volatile than water, so it is easier to boil off. The alcohol is allowed to escape and the remaining liquid is used, essentially the opposite of distillation. Most modern breweries also utilize vacuum evaporation to preserve flavor. In essence, the beer is placed under a light vacuum to facilitate the alcohol molecules going into the gaseous phase. If a sufficient vacuum is applied, it may not even be necessary to "cook" the beer, but heat must nevertheless be supplied to counter the heat lost to Enthalpy of vaporization.

An alternative process called reverse osmosis does not require heating. The beer is passed through a filter with pores small enough that only alcohol and water (and a few volatile acids) can pass through. The alcohol is distilled out of the alcohol-water mix using conventional distillation methods. After adding the water and remaining acids back into the syrupy mixture of sugars and flavor compounds left on the other side of the filter, the process is then complete.[39]

Sometimes beer is simply diluted with water to give the desired alcohol level.[40]

How non-alcoholic beer is made

The conversion from a traditional alcoholic beer to a non-alcoholic beer takes place after the seventh step and preceding the finishing step. The uncarbonated beer is heated up to its boiling point. Another method of removing the alcohol is to decrease the pressure so the alcohol boils at room temperature. This is the preferred method because raising the temperature this late in the brewing process can greatly affect the flavor of the brew. If brewers decide to convert their brew to a non-alcoholic brew they must consider the volume of liquid they have lost during the removal of the alcohol. Typically the volume is reduced by roughly 4%, and to compensate water is added. Another tip would be avoiding using sugar from maize; this simply increases the alcohol content without adding to the flavor or body of the beer.[41]

Once the alcohol is removed, one proceeds with the normal finishing process in which the beer is carbonated and bottled.


Branding
