COGNAC SKËNDERBEU is an Albanian cognac produced and degusted for the first time on September 1, 1967 by then government-owned Kantina Skënderbeu.[1]

The alcohol is prepared and aged only in vats, tuns and barrels made by oak wood, which gives it its unique aroma, bouquet and special colour. Its main ingredients are: aged raki, mountain plants extract, processed fruit (grapes, lemon, black plum), ethyl alcohol, sugar syrup, flower honey, distilled water, caramel, etc.[2][3]
