AMRYL JOHNSON (6 April 1944 â€“ 1 February 2001) was a writer born in Trinidad who lived most of her life in Britain.[1]


Life

Johnson was born in Tunapuna, Trinidad, and moved to Britain when she was 11.[2] She attended secondary school in London and went on to study British, African and Caribbean literature at the University of Kent.[3] Much of her work concerned the diasporic nature of her life and the hostility she faced in Britain[4]. For a time, she taught at the University of Warwick but generally supported herself by writing and performing. During the late 1980s, she settled in Coventry.[5]

Her work was included in several anthologies, including _News for Babylon: The Chatto Book of Westindian-British Poetry_ (1984), _Let It Be Told: Essays by Black Women in Britain_ (1987), _Watchers & Seekers: Creative Writing by Black Women in Britain_ (1987), _Delighting the Heart_ (1989), _Creation Fire: A CAFRA Anthology of Caribbean Women's Poetry_ (1990), _Taking Reality by Surprise_ (1991), _Daughters of Africa_ (1992) and _OTHER: British and Irish Poetry since 1970_ (1999).
