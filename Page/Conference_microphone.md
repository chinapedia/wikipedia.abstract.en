CONFERENCE MICROPHONE is the microphone specially designed for the communication in the conference. Conference microphones can be divided into two kinds, the wired conference microphone, which is based on the cable to transmit its signal to perform the communication task; another one is the wireless conference microphone, which is based on Wifi or IR technology to communicate among the microphones.[1]

The operation mechanism of conference microphone is that multiple conference microphone transmits and exchange their signal by the control unit. The amplifier embedded in the microphone translate the electrical signal to voice.

Your mic can be regular or USB. One advantage of USB, if well designed, is that the long cable wonâ€™t pickup stray signals like the call-connection on GSM phones.[2]

It is also possible to determine the type of microphones according to the direction of the action. There are narrowly and broadly directed. If there is a large conference hall with the presence of a large number of participants and speakers, then the narrowly directional microphones are the best choice, since each of the microphones has a limited perception zone and will not perceive the voice of the other speaker. If a room is small and there is an opportunity to put a microphone in the middle of the table, then the wide directional mic can be used.
