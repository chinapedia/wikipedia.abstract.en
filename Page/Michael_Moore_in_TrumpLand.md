_MICHAEL MOORE IN TRUMPLAND_ is a 2016 documentary film by Michael Moore[2][3][4][5][6] about the 2016 United States presidential election campaign. The film is based on a one-person show that Moore originally wanted to perform in Midland Theatre in Newark, Ohio on October 7, but management of the Midland Theatre chose not to honor a rental contract.[7][8][9] He eventually held the show at the Murphy Theatre in Wilmington, Ohio, with the movie based on a recording of that performance over two nights in October.[10][11]

Moore had announced the event on Twitter.[15]
