POPE SIXTUS II (died 6 August 258) was the Pope or Bishop of Rome from 31 August 257 until his death on 6 August 258. He was martyred along with seven deacons, including Lawrence of Rome during the persecution of the Catholic Church by Emperor Valerian.[1]


Biography

According to the _Liber Pontificalis_, he was born in Greece and was a philosopher;[2] however, this is uncertain, and is disputed by modern western historians arguing that the authors of _Liber Pontificalis_ confused him with that of the contemporary author Xystus, who was a Greek student of Pythagoreanism.[3] He restored the relations with the African and Eastern churches which had been broken off by his predecessor on the question of heretical baptism raised by the heresy Novatianism.

In the persecutions under Valerian in 258, numerous bishops, priests, and deacons were put to death. Pope Sixtus II was one of the first victims of this persecution, being beheaded on 6 August. He was martyred along with six deaconsâ€” Januarius, Vincentius, Magnus, Stephanus, Felicissimus and Agapitus.[4] Lawrence of Rome, his best-known deacon, suffered martyrdom on 10 August, four days after his bishop.[5]

He is thought by some to be the author of the pseudo-Cyprianic writing _Ad Novatianum_, though this view has not found general acceptance. Another composition written at Rome, between 253 and 258, is generally agreed to be his.

It is this Sixtus who is referred to by name in the Roman Canon of the Mass.[6] The Tridentine Calendar commemorated Sixtus, Felicissimus, and Agapitus on the feast of the Transfiguration of the Lord, 6 August. They remained in that position in the General Roman Calendar until 1969, when, with the abolition of commemorations, the memorial of Sixtus "and his companions" was moved to 7 August, the day immediately after that of their death.[7]

The following inscription honoring Sixtus was placed on his tomb in the catacomb of Callixtus by Pope Damasus I:
