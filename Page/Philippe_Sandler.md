Club career

Born in Amsterdam, Sandler began his senior career with PEC Zwolle in the 2016–17 season,[1] having previously played youth football for Ajax.[2]

In January 2018 it was announced that Sandler would leave PEC Zwolle to join English club Manchester City in the summer of 2018, for a transfer fee reported to be between €2.5 and 3 million.[3] The transfer went through on 31 July 2018.[4] Sandler requested the number 34 shirt in tribute to former Ajax teammate Abdelhak Nouri, who collapsed and suffered brain damage, ending his career.[5]

Sandler made his City debut on 6 January 2019, coming on as a substitute in a 7–0 win over Rotherham United in the FA Cup.[6]

Sandler was loaned to Anderlecht for the 2019–20 season, joining up with Anderlecht player-manager, former Man City teammate Vincent Kompany.[7]
