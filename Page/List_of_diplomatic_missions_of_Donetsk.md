This page lists the DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS OF DONETSK. The Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) is only recognized by South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Besides, the DNR authority has two representative offices in Russia, plus an illegal office with self-claimed consulate in Czech Republic[1] and another one in Finland[2]. The office in Finland is claimed to be run by an association registered in 20 October 2016[3], but the association is no longer listed in the association registry[4].
