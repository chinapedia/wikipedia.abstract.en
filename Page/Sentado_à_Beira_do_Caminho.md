"SENTADO À BEIRA DO CAMINHO" is a Brazilian song composed by Roberto Carlos and Erasmo Carlos and released as a single in May 1969 by Erasmo Carlos.


Background

The song was inspired by a 1968 hit song, Bobby Russell's "Honey (I miss you)", and it describes the despair and hopelessness of a lover waiting for his beloved.[1] A Spanish-language version of the song was also released titled "Sentado a la Vera del Camino" and was recorded by Erasmo Carlos. The Spanish version has been covered by Los Vikings and . In 1988, American singer Eydie Gormé recorded the Spanish-language version with Roberto Carlos for her album _De Corazón a Corazón_.[2] The song peaked at number two on the _Billboard_ Hot Latin Songs.[3] Their version led to the duo receiving a nomination for Pop Group or Duo of the Year at the inaugural Lo Nuestro Awards in 1989.[4]

In 1970 the song was adapted into Italian language by Bruno Lauzi and recorded by Ornella Vanoni with title "L'appuntamento". This version, chosen as opening song of the radio show _Gran Varietà_, became an immediate hit, ranking #2 on the Italian hit parade. The song was also covered by several artists, including Mina, Andrea Bocelli, Johnny Dorelli, Fernanda Porto.[5] and (in a greek version) Dimitra Galani (Δήμητρα Γαλάνη) (Συνάντηση - Encounter) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of4MCLKoVaw).

Vanoni's version was included in the musical score of the film _Ocean's Twelve_.[6]
