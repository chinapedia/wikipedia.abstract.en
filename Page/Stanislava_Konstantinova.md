Personal life

Konstantinova was born on 14 July 2000 in Saint Petersburg, Russia.[1] Her mother trained in rhythmic gymnastics and track and field and her father in karate.[2] Her sister, Kristina, is eleven years younger.[3]


Career

Konstantinova began learning to skate in 2006.[4] Valentina Chebotareva became her coach when she was nine years old.[5] She made her international debut in November 2012 at the 2012 Tallinn Trophy, where she won the junior gold medal.[6] In the 2015–16 season she won second gold medal at the 2015 Tallinn Trophy. In 2016–17 season she made her Junior Grand Prix debut. She won silver medal at the JGP Russia, she then placed fourth at the JGP Germany.

Konstantinova made her international senior debut at the 2016 CS Tallinn Trophy where she won gold medal with a personal best score of 186.97 points. Placing first in both programs, she won the gold medal by a margin of more than 9 points over silver medalist Serafima Sakhanovich.

2017–18 season

In November 2017 Konstantinova competed the 2017 CS Tallinn Trophy where she won the gold medal. This was her second consecutive victory at Tallinn Trophy. Two weeks later she won the 2017 CS Golden Spin of Zagreb with a personal best score of 199.68 points.

In December 2017 she placed fourth at the 2018 Russian Championships after placing tenth in the short program and third in the free skate. She then competed at the 2018 Russian Junior Championships where she won the bronze medal. [7]

In March 2018 Konstantinova competed at the 2018 Junior Worlds where she placed fourth after placing sixth in the short program and fifth in the free skate. She was subsequently called up to replace Evgenia Medvedeva at the 2018 World Championships in Milan. She was later described as having "more or less bombed" the competition, placing sixteenth in the short program and twentieth in the free skate, for nineteenth place overall. Konstantinova would admit to being "really down after that." She described herself as "very grateful to my family that they supported me in this difficult time, thankful to the fans that didn’t turn away from me and continued to support me. I healed my soul through work and I drew a lot of conclusions for myself."[8]

2018–19 season

Konstantinova started her season by competing at two ISU Challenger Series events. In mid September she won the bronze medal at the 2018 CS Ondrej Nepela Trophy and two weeks later she placed fourth at the 2018 CS Finlandia Trophy, fractions of a point behind Finnish skater Viveca Lindfors. In early November she made her Grand Prix debut at 2018 Grand Prix of Helsinki where she won the silver medal behind her teammate Alina Zagitova. In late November she finished fifth at the 2018 Internationaux de France.

At the 2019 Russian Championships, Konstantinova initially placed fourth in the short program.[9] In the free skate, she popped an Axel and underrotated a triple Lutz, placing fifth in the free skate and fourth overall. Konstantinova was the highest-ranked international senior skater in the competition, 0.89 points ahead of Alina Zagitova. Speaking afterward, she said she was "not too happy with my free as I made mistakes, but I proved that I am competitive in this field."[10]

Konstantinova was assigned to the 2019 European Championships along with Zagitova and Sofia Samodurova, the other top senior qualifiers at the Russian Championships. In the short program, Konstantinova doubled her attempted triple Lutz and underrotated her triple flip, as a result placing eleventh. She placed second in the free skate, behind only Samodurova, and finished in fourth place overall, behind Samodurova, Zagitova, and Lindfors.[11] Competing next at the domestic Russian Cup Final, she placed second in the short program, behind only Medvedeva, but fell to sixth in the free, and was again fourth overall. Although initially submitted as one of Russia's three entries for the 2019 World Championships, she was subsequently withdrawn and replaced by Medvedeva.[12]
