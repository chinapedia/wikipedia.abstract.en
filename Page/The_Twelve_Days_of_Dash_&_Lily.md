_THE TWELVE DAYS OF DASH & LILY_ is a romantic young adult novel. It is a collaboration by authors David Levithan and Rachel Cohn and the sequel to their earlier book, _Dash & Lily's Book of Dares_. It was announced that this would be the first of two new collaborations.[1]


About

The book takes place a year after _Dash & Lily's Book of Dares_.[2] Set in Manhattan in the twelve days preceding Christmas, Lily has been left devastated by her grandfather's heart attack.[3] His declining health has caused her to fall out of love with life. Dash, along with Lily's brother Langston is determined to bring her out of her depression in time for Christmas, a time of year that she traditionally loves.[4]

The story is told in the first person, with each chapter alternating between Lily and Dash as narrator.[5] Rachel Cohn and David Levithan share that they create the story without a clear direction in mind by writing chapter by chapter.[6] Levithan starts the first chapter, then mails it to Cohn, who picks up the story until her chapter is finished and so on.[7] After they completed the first draft, they confer with one another until the book is polished.[8]
