_BAR KOKHBA_ is a double album by John Zorn, recorded between 1994 and 1996.[1] It features music from Zorn's _Masada_ project, rearranged for small ensembles.[2] It also features the original soundtrack from _The Art of Remembrance – Simon Wiesenthal_, a film by Hannah Heer and Werner Schmiedel (1994–95).


Reception

The AllMusic review by Marc Gilman awarded the album 4½ stars noting that "While some compositions retain their original structure and sound, some are expanded and probed by Zorn's arrangements, and resemble avant-garde classical music more than jazz. But this is the beauty of the album; the ensembles provide a forum for Zorn to expand his compositions. The album consistently impresses."[3]
