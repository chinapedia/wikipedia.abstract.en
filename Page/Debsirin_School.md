DEBSIRIN SCHOOL (, ) is a boys' secondary school in Thailand. Founded by King Chulalongkorn in 1885, its alumni include King Ananda Mahidol,[1] Malaysia's founding father Tunku Abdul Rahman,[2] more than 70 cabinet members, including 5 prime ministers, and numerous military leaders and dignitaries. Debsirin School participates in Jaturamitr Samakkee, a biennial traditional football competition between the four oldest boys' schools in Thailand.


History

The fifth Abbot of Wat Thep Sirin Thrawat had donated land for a school as early as 1702.[3] King Mongkut had tried to modernize Siam, enabling it to stand up to the European powers. He was succeeded by his 15-year-old son, Chulalongkorn, who reigned as Rama V, now known as _Rama the Great_. Rama V was the first Siamese king to have a Western education, having been taught by a British governess, Anna Leonowens.[4] As Bangkok developed as the capital of the new nation of Siam, Rama V's government began several nationwide development projects, despite financial hardship. New roads, bridges, railways, hospitals and schools mushroomed throughout the country, all funded from the national budget.

In a speech at a student award ceremony in 1884, the King said;

In 1885, he founded the school, naming it in honour of his mother, Debsirindra Queen Ramphoei Phamaraphirom (Thai: รำเพยภมราภิรมย์). The school opened with 53 pupils.[5] Debsirin_School_2016.jpg

World War II

During World War II Thailand, under Field Marshal Plaek Pibulsongkram, was allied with the Axis powers and declared war on the United Kingdom and United States when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Bangkok suffered heavily in the subsequent Allied bombing raids and Debsirin School, strategically located near the railway, was not spared. Most of the teaching buildings (Maen Naruemit and Choduek Laohasetthi) were destroyed. They were later rebuilt by the alumni and the Ministry of Education. The main building, renamed _Maen Suksa Stan Building_, was built in the Gothic style.[6]

Today, Debsirin School has a strong alumni network (Debsirin Alumni Association) under Royal patronage, several Prime Ministers of Thailand and members of the Royal Family. The school also operates as a _living museum_, containing exhibits on the history of the school and the development of Thai education.[7]
