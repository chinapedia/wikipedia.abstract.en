Style

According to an AMA that Christoffer Franzén from the Lights & Motion hosted on Reddit, the album will contain a lot of different kinds of textures and soundscapes; "I would take beautiful strings and then wrangle them through reverbs/delays and saturation to get it to sound like something else entirely."[2] The album will also feature previously unused elements like vintage synthesiser sounds and electronics.[3]
