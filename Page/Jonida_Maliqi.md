Life and career

1995-1999: Early life and career beginnings

Maliqi's singing talent was discovered at an early age by the renowned Albanian pianist _Nora Çashku_ who was impressed with her singing of a song by Parashqevi Simaku and suggested to Maliqi's mother to enroll her at the music school.[9]. The advice was taken, thus, Maliqi studied violin at the conservatoire for four consecutive years. At the age of nine, she joined the ‘’Cultural Children's Centre’’ in Tirana and participated in various festivals at home and abroad in which she progressed with great success. Later on, she began her guitar studies at Jordan Misja Artistic Lyceum, and then, at the age of thirteen, she made her debut at the Festivali i Këngës with the song _“Planeti i Fëmijëve”’_ in a duet with Albanian tenor Aleksandër Rrapi. The following year, Maliqi began to study canto and graduated from the Lyceum. In 1997, aged fifteen, she returned to the festival with the song _“Flas Me Engjëllin Tim”_, this time in a duet with Albanian tenor Kastriot Tusha. The song was dedicated to the Albanian Catholic Saint Mother Teresa and received wide acclaim nationwide. Maliqi’s professional career as a solo artist began in 1999 with the song _“Do Jetoj Edhe Pa Ty_“ which won the second place in the festival.[10]

2000-2005: Breakthrough

After the successful solo debut in 1999, Maliqi participates at "Festivali i Këngës" for another three consecutive years with songs _“Çast_“, _“Ik_“ and _“Do Humbas Me Ty_“ which placed third at the 41th edition. In 2001, Maliqi pursued studies at the Academy of Arts under the mentorship of the renowned Albanian professor NINA MULA, the mother of internationally acclaimed Albanian soprano Inva Mula. Meanwhile, her participation at various music festivals continued as she approached mainstream success. In 2003, Maliqi won "The Best Performer" category at Kënga Magjike for _“Vetëm Një Natë_“, whereas in 2004, she won the "Ethno Music Award" for _“Nuk Kam Faj Që Robëroj_“. In 2005, Maliqi announced a work on her debut album NUK TË PRES and won the "Best Interpretation Award" at Kënga Magjike for _“Papagalli i Dashurisë_“.

2006-2010: Studio album

After her graduation in 2006, Maliqi starred in the Albanian version of _The Ten Commandments: The Musical_ as Bithia, and in the same year she released her debut album _Nuk Të Pres_ upon her birthday.[11] That year, her collaboration with Albanian pop singer Tuna (singer) spawned the hit _“Forca e Femrës_“ which won the "Best Female Award" at Top Fest. The performance attracted much comment due to their antics on stage that were interpreted by many as a likely titillated lesbian act. Meanwhile, some tabloids instated Tuna as "protégée in Jonida’s same-sex erotica and polymorphous sexuality".[12]. However, both artists denied the allegations about their lesbian relationship. In 2008, Maliqi returned with a new single _“Njëri Nga Ata_“ which entered "Kënga Magjike" and won the competition alongside the "Best Song" and the "10th Anniversary Award". In 2010, she collaborated with Albanian rap artist Big Basta and their song _“Sot t'i Japim Fund_“ won the "Best Pop & R&B Song" at the Top Fest.

2011-2015: Television and theatre endeavours

In 2011, Maliqi returned to "Kënga Magjike" with _“Thesar pa Emër_“ which won "Çesk Zadeja Award" whereas in 2012 she became the captain of her team at the Albanian version of the Dutch TV-series "I Love My Country". In 2013, she won "Jon Music Award" for _“Ti_“ and then was announced as a host of the first season of _The Voice Kids (Albanian TV series)_ but withdrew, presumably due to other professional pursuits.[13]. On the same year, Maliqi starred at the musical "Romeo and Juliet" as Juliet opposite Albanian Skënderaj. In 2014, she co-hosted the fourth season of "Dancing with the Stars" whereas in 2015 she released a new song called _“Jam Bërë Si Ti_“ which became a huge hit.

2016- : The Voice of Albania and the Eurovision Song Contest

Period between 2016 and 2018, denoted a shift in focus of Jonida as an artist to a television personality. In 2016, Maliqi appeared as a judge on the fifth season of "The Voice of Albania" between January 9, 2016 and April 16, 2016. In May 10, 2018, Maliqi released through VEVO the song “N’Errësirë” which marked a successful comeback.[14][15] On December 20, 2018, Maliqi participated and won the 57th edition of the Festivali i Këngës thus becoming Albania’s sixteenth representative at Eurovision Song Contest with the song "Ktheju tokës".[16][17] Maliqi represented Albania among forty-one competing in Eurovision 2019 in Tel Aviv, Israel.

Philanthropy

Maliqi’s diverse charitable activities include campaigns for encouraging awareness about the breast cancer; promoting the value, acceptance and inclusion of people with Down syndrome, as well as consistent benefit performances at charity concerts.[20] Although Maliqi shunts publicity about her privately undertaken philanthropic work, one of her notable publicised case took place during the live broadcast of _“Top Show Magazine”_ at Top Channel in which she surprised a girl born with Down syndrome and presented her with a new iPad.[21] Maliqi’s other charitable endeavours cover a wide range of causes.


Private life

Maliqi’s private life came under media scrutiny since her mainstream breakthrough in the early 2000s. She married the Albanian businessman, Gent Prizreni, in a private luxury wedding that was attended by renowned names of the Albanian music industry. In March 2017, the couple announced their divorce. Jonida and Gent have a son named Dan.[22]
