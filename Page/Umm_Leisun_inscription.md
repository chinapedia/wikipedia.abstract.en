The UMM LEISUN INSCRIPTION () is the Old Georgian _limestone_ _tombstone_ slab inscription written in the Georgian _Asomtavruli_ script which was discovered in 2002, after the renewal of 1996[1] excavation, at a Georgian monastery of the Byzantine period, in the neighborhood of Umm Leisun, 4.5 km southeast of the Old City of Jerusalem,[2] found in a burial crypt under the polychrome[3] mosaic floor.[4]

In total about 24 interments were discovered in the crypt.[5] Per sex estimation for human skeletons, all of them were adult males, as would be expected in a monastery.[6] The occupant of the most important tomb identified by a Georgian inscription was a "Georgian _bishop_ _Iohane_" (John in Old Georgian), who was also the oldest and his age underlined his special status.[7] He would have been aged 66 or 67 when he died, and had suffered from osteoporosis.[8] The inscription is the earliest known example for an ethnonym ႵႠႰႧႥႤႪႨ (_kartveli_ i.e. Georgian) on any archaeological artifact, both in the Holy Land and in Georgia.[9][10]

The inscription covers an area of 81 × 49 cm cut into the tombstone. It is dated to the end of the 5th or the first half of the 6th century AD.[11] The inscription is kept at the Archaeological Garden of Knesset.[12]
