LOUISE CAMPBELL WEISBECKER (May 30, 1911 â€“ November 5, 1997) was an American actress.[1] Despite her success in Hollywood, she always made it clear she preferred the stage.

Campbell was a leading lady in the late 1930s films, notably _Bulldog Drummond Comes Back_ (1937) and _The Star Maker_ (1939).


Early years

Campbell was born LOUISE WEISBECKER in Chicago, Illinois. She had a sister, Ottilia.[2]

Campbell attended St. Michael's School.[3] Northwestern University[4] and DePaul University, studying dramatic arts at the latter.[5] She gained additional dramatic training at the Chicago School of Expression.[6] She said that when she was 6 years old, she decided to be an actress after she watched a production of _Uncle Tom's Cabin_.[7]

At one point, she worked as a dental assistant, an experience which she said was "invaluable to me in my acting" as she observed changes in patients' facial expressions in the dentist's office, with their changing expressions displaying "their real character."[8]


Stage

Campbell gained early theatrical experience by performing with several stock theater companies.[9] Her Broadway debut was in _Three Men on a Horse_ (1935).[10] Her other Broadway credits include _Julie the Great_,[11] _Guest in the House_ (1941), _A House in the Country_ (1936) and _White Man_ (1936).[12] A column in the June 13, 1942, issue of the trade publication Billboard complimented "Louise Campbell, that fine actress, for a lovely, beautifully projected, altogether excellent performance in _Guest in the House_."[13]


Film

Campbell went to Hollywood in 1937 and made 13 films in the 1930s and 1940s. Her film debut was in _Bulldog Drummond Comes Back_ (1937).[14] Her film credits included _Bulldog Drummond_ sequels, _Night Club Scandal_ (1937),[15] _Men with Wings_ (1938), _The Buccaneer_ (1938) and _The Star Maker_ (1939).[16]


Personal life

Campbell was married to actor Horace McMahon, whom she met when they were both in the Broadway play _Three Men on a Horse_.[17] They wed in 1938 and remained married until his death in 1971.[18]
