Description

_Eucalyptus foliosa_ is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has a dense crown of glossy green leaves that reaches to the ground. The bark is smooth and greyish with brownish patches and sometimes hangs in ribbons. The adult leaves are narrow lance-shaped or narrow oblong, the same colour on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven or nine on a peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are shaped like an egg in an egg cup, about long and wide with a rounded operculum. The flowers are white and the fruit is a woody, conical to shortened hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level.[1][2][3]


Taxonomy and naming

_Eucalyptus foliosa_ was first formally described in 1992 by Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson in the journal _Telopea_ from a specimen collected north of Esperance.[4][5] The specific epithet (_foliosa_) is a Latin word meaning "leafy",[6] referring to the dense crown of this species.[7]


Distribution and habitat

This mallee is found growing in sandy clay soils on flat areas adjacent to salt lakes and has a limited range near Esperance in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions of Western Australia.[8][9]


Conservation status

This eucalypt is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[10]
