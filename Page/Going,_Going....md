_GOING, GOING..._ is the ninth studio album by English rock band The Wedding Present. It was released on 2 September 2016 in the UK, and 2 December 2016 in the US, by their record label, Scopitones. It is a 20-song double multimedia album - each song has its own video included - that is also a travelogue about a journey across North America.[1]


Background

_Going, Going..._ came four years after the band's previous album, _Valentina_. David Gedge had decided that he didn't want the next album to be "just another album" and decided on a format of a number of interconnected pieces.[2] In 2014 he travelled across America with photographer Jessica McMillan and made a number of films. After that, says Gedge, it was a case of "progressing through the music, trying all sorts of ideas, seeing how they work set against the visuals."[3]
