GIOSUÈ ALESSANDRO GIUSEPPE CARDUCCI ( ,[1][2] ; also GIOSUE CARDUCCI in later years;[3] 27 July 1835 – 16 February 1907) was an Italian poet, writer, literary critic and teacher. He was very influential[4] and was regarded as the official national poet of modern Italy.[5] In 1906 he became the first Italian to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature[6] "not only in consideration of his deep learning and critical research, but above all as a tribute to the creative energy, freshness of style, and lyrical force which characterize his poetic masterpieces".[7]


Biography

Giosuè_Carducci1.jpg He was born in Valdicastello (part of Pietrasanta), a small town in the Province of Lucca in the northwest corner of the region of Tuscany. His father, a doctor, was an advocate of the unification of Italy and was involved with the Carbonari. Because of his politics, the family was forced to move several times during Carducci's childhood, eventually settling for a few years in Florence.[8]

From the time he was in school, he was fascinated with the restrained style of Greek and Roman Antiquity, and his mature work reflects a restrained classical style, often using the classical meters of such Latin poets as Horace and Virgil. He translated Book 9 of Homer's _Iliad_ into Italian.

Carducci was awarded a scholarship to study at the prestigious Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. After graduating in 1856, he began teaching school. The following year, he published his first collection of poems, _Rime_. These were difficult years for Carducci: his father died, and his brother committed suicide.

In 1859, he married Elvira Menicucci, and they had four children. He briefly taught Greek at a high school in Pistoia, and then was appointed Professor of Italian Literature at the University of Bologna. Here, one of his students was Giovanni Pascoli, who became a poet himself and later succeeded him at the university.

Carducci was a popular lecturer and a fierce critic of literature and society. He was an atheist,[9] whose political views were vehemently hostile to Christianity generally and the Catholic Church in particular.

  I know neither truth of God nor peace with the Vatican or any priests. They are the real and unaltering enemies of Italy.

he said in his later years.[10] This anti-clerical revolutionary vehemence is prominently showcased in one famous poem, the deliberately blasphemous and provocative "Inno a Satana" ("Hymn to Satan".) The poem was composed in 1863 as a dinner party toast, published in 1865, then republished in 1869 by Bologna's radical newspaper, _Il Popolo_, as a provocation timed to coincide with the First Vatican Council, a time when revolutionary fervor directed against the papacy was running high as republicans pressed both politically and militarily for an end to the Vatican's domination over the papal states.[11]

In 1890 he met future writer and poet Annie Vivanti, with whom he started a love affair. Carlo Emilio Gadda reported that

In 2004, the uncensored letters between her and Carducci were published.[12][13]

While "Inno a Satana" had quite a revolutionary impact, Carducci's finest poetry came in later years. His collections _Rime Nuove_ (_New Rhymes_) and _Odi Barbare_ (_Barbarian Odes_) contain his greatest works.[14]

He was the first Italian to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, in 1906. He was also elected a Senator of Italy.[15] In politics he remained a strong Liberal throughout his life, although he vacillated between a preference for republicanism and constitutional monarchy.[16] Although his reputation rests primarily on his poetry, he also produced a large body of prose works.[17] Indeed, his prose writings, including literary criticism, biographies, speeches and essays, fill some 20 volumes.[18] Carducci was also an excellent translator and translated some of Goethe and Heine into Italian.

The Museum of the Risorgimento, Bologna is housed in the Casa Carducci, the house where he died at the age of 71, and contains an exhibits on the author.


Works

It is not always easy to follow the development of Carducci's poetry through the collections he edited. The poet in fact organized his compositions several times and in different ways and gave a definitive arrangement only later in the edition of his _Opere_ published for Zanichelli between 1889 and 1909. The following is a list of poetic works published in one volume, then rearranged into the 20 volumes of his _Opere_.

-   _Rime_, San Miniato, 1857.
-   _Levia Gravia_, 1868.
-   _Poesie_, Firenze, Barbera, 1871.
-   _Primavere elleniche_, 1872.
-   _Nuove poesie_, 1873.
-   _Odi barbare_, 1877.
-   _Juvenilia_, 1880.
-   _Levia Gravia_, 1881.
-   _Giambi ed Epodi_, 1882.
-   _Nuove odi barbare_, 1882.
-   _Rime nuove_, 1887.
-   _Terze odi barbare_, 1889.
-   _Delle Odi barbare. Libri II ordinati e corretti_, 1893.
-   _Rime e ritmi_, 1899.
-   _Poesie. MDCCCL-MCM_, 1901.

Below are the poetic volumes in the _Opere_. The volumes, however, do not correspond to the chronological order with which the poet had published his first collections, but refer more than anything else to the distinctions of genres and therefore we find poems of the same period in different collections. The collections follow this order:

-   _Juvenilia_, in six books, 1850-1860
-   _Levia Gravia_, in two books, 1861-1871
-   _Inno a Satana_, 1863
-   _Giambi ed Epodi_, in two books, 1867-1879
-   _Intermezzo_, 1874-1887
-   _Rime Nuove_, in nine books, 1861-1887
-   _Odi barbare_, in two books, 1873-1889
-   _Rime e Ritmi_, 1889-1898
-   _Della Canzone di Legnano_, Part I, 1879

_Juvenilia_

The first collection of lyrical poems, which Carducci collected and divided in six books under the title _Juvenilia_ (1850-1860), is undoubtedly inspired by the classical tradition of the _Amici pedanti_ group that was constituted at that time for the purpose of fighting the romanticism of the Florentines. In the verses of the collection we can immediately see his imitation of the ancient classics, of the stilnovo style, of Dante and Petrarch and, among the moderns, Vittorio Alfieri, Monti, Foscolo and Leopardi.

But the Carduccian spirit is already visible; his love for the beauty of style, the purity of sentiments and the celebration of liberty, as well as the ability to appreciate all that is genuine, therefore also the language of the common people.[19][20]
