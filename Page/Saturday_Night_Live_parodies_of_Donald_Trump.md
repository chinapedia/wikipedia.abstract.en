Three_Donalds.jpg (left) and Darrell Hammond (right), respectively, portray Donald Trump while the real Donald Trump (middle) hosted _Saturday Night Live_ on November 7, 2015]] The sketch comedy television series _Saturday Night Live_ (_SNL_) has parodied Donald Trump since 1988, from his time as a real estate broker, to his popular run as host of _The Apprentice_, and ultimately during his presidency.

To date, Trump has been portrayed by five _SNL_ performers: Phil Hartman, Darrell Hammond, Jason Sudeikis, Taran Killam, and Alec Baldwin. Darrell Hammond has portrayed him the longest, originally while in the cast in the late 1990s, and then reprising the role in a series of cameos in 2016. The other cast-members held the role briefly, with five appearances by Hartman, three by Killam, and only one by Sudeikis.[1] Since October 2016, the role has been played by Alec Baldwin, who has made many appearances on the series through its run.

_SNL_ has frequently paired parodies of Trump with impressions of his wives and children or, since he took office, various staff-members.

Trump himself has hosted the show twice, in 2004 and 2015, the latter time as a candidate.


Hartman parodies (1988–1990)

Cast member Phil Hartman was the show's first portrayer of Donald Trump, from 1988 until 1990. Hartman portrayed Trump five times,[2] and was paired with Jan Hooks as Trump's then-wife Ivana Trump or, in one case, Marla Maples, Trump's second-wife-to-be.[3][4]

The first sketch, from December 1988, shows Donald and Ivana celebrating Christmas, giving large, gold and jewel-encrusted presents to each other.[5]

Trump is seen in the audience at the _Saturday Night Live 15th Anniversary Special_ from 1989, where Chevy Chase spills popcorn on him.[6]

A sketch from February 1990 parodies the Ivana Trump divorce. Ivana demands more money since Donald has been unfaithful, but he refutes this by referring to their extensive prenuptial agreement. It states, among other things, that he is entitled to have mistresses provided they are younger than she is, and that she will be paid in giant stonecoins.[7]

The next episode had Marla Maples and Trump appearing on _Church Chat_. The couple are referred to as a "satanic sandwich", and the sketch shows press coverage of their relationship, including a "Best Sex I've Ever Had" headline.[8]


Hammond parodies (1999–2011, 2015–2016)

Hartman did not do more Trump-sketches after 1990, and Darrell Hammond's first two portrayals came in 1999.[9] The first sketch had Ross Perot (Cheri Oteri) searching for "a new crazy leader" for the Reform Party, with Trump and Pat Buchanan (Chris Parnell) as possible candidates. Their meeting is crashed by a violent Jesse Ventura (Will Ferrell). In the second sketch Trump announces that he is running for president and tells the audience, "Eh, don't try to fight it. Alright?" He also introduces his running mate, _Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?_ winner John Carpenter.

Hammond resumed playing Trump in 2004, doing so a total of 16 times up to 2011, although he left the cast in 2009.[10] His parodies focused on Trump's interest and involvement with politics, commercials, and his appearances on _The Apprentice_. Trump hosted the show in April 2004, praising Hammond in his opening monologue, and appeared in a sketch next to Hammond's Trump.

An early 2005 episode introduced Trump's third wife, Melania (Paris Hilton). Trump brings her home to let his children, Eric Trump (Fred Armisen), Donald Trump Jr. (Seth Meyers), and Ivanka Trump (Maya Rudolph), "meet their new mommy". Melania would be portrayed later by Molly Shannon and, from 2015 and onward (without Hammond), by Cecily Strong.[11][12]

Hammond is the show's longest running Trump impersonator. He played the role for ten years in the cast, 1999 to 2009, and reprised it twice in 2011. In the 2011 sketches Trump involves himself in the upcoming Republican Party presidential primaries and questions President Obama's birth certificate.

After returning to serve as the show's announcer in 2014, he began reprising his role as Trump regularly, beginning in December 2015. Due to the wide field of GOP candidates in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the show needed at least one cameo appearance to cover all of the candidates. Taran Killam, who at this point had begun playing Trump, switched to portraying Ted Cruz. _SNL_ had asked alumnus Jimmy Fallon (who had portrayed Trump on his own show) to play the part.[13] When a last minute change prevented this, Hammond returned to the role. Cecily Strong, who had portrayed Melania opposite Killam's Trump, continued in this role alongside Hammond.[14]

Hammond subsequently appeared as Trump in seven more episodes of the season. His appearance in the role was critically acclaimed,[15] but some outlets reported that the role should be moved to a permanent cast member at some point.[16]


Sudeikis parody (2012)

Jason Sudeikis appeared in the role once, during a _Fox & Friends_ parody.[17] Sudeikis' Trump comments on Barack Obama's handling of Hurricane Sandy.


Killam parodies (2015)

It was announced prior to the show's forty-first season that Taran Killam would be taking over the role for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Reportedly, several cast members had auditioned for the role.[18]

Killam's Trump debuted on the October 2015 sketch "A Message From Donald & Melania Trump", which also introduced Cecily Strong as Melania Trump. The message is sent from "our humble gold house", and Donald presents himself as "the man who's almost certainly your next president". The couple praise Donald's qualities as a person and a politician, although he becomes uncomfortable when she claims that he "was Democrat before he was Republican".[19] The duo reprised the setup and characters in December, wishing viewers a Merry Christmas and presenting a "Naughty and Nice" list. Donald placed Santa on the "naughty" list since he doesn't trust anybody who can fly over a wall.[20]

Donald Trump hosted _SNL_ a second time in November 2015, and Killam and Hammond appeared during the opening monologue alongside him.[21] Since Trump was running for president, his appearance triggered the equal-time rule, so his opponents received free air time on NBC affiliate stations.[22] Trump appeared in a sketch portraying him as an incredibly successful president in 2018. Cecily Strong parodied Melania, and Trump's daughter Ivanka appeared in a cameo.[23] Trump ends the sketch by telling the audience that his _actual_ presidency would be even better. Trump is one of 17 presidential candidates who have appeared on _Saturday Night Live_, and the only American President to have hosted the show.[24] Killam later expressed regret and shame for what he referred to as "normalizing" Trump's candidacy.[25]

For the December 19, 2015 episode (co-hosted by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler), _SNL_ lacked enough cast members to portray all of the GOP candidates in a debate sketch. As a result, Jimmy Fallon was asked to return in the role of Trump (which he had played many times on _The Tonight Show_) so that Killam could portray Ted Cruz instead. Ultimately, that plan fell through at the last minute, and instead, Hammond played Trump in the debate.

Hammond continued to play Trump for the remainder of the season. Killam's contract was terminated early after that season, with some news sources alleging that being replaced as Trump was part of the reason.[26]


Baldwin parodies (2016–present)

In September 2016, _SNL_ announced that Alec Baldwin would replace Hammond in portraying Trump in its parodies of the 2016 presidential debates. Hammond had not expected this, and was very shaken by the replacement.[27] Baldwin has continued portraying Trump in 2017.[28][29] Unlike his predecessors, he has never been a cast-member, but as of February 2017 he has hosted the show 17 times, more than anyone else.[30] Baldwin received a Critics' Choice Award and a Primetime Emmy Award for his portrayal of Trump.[31]

Before election

Baldwin's Trump debuted in the October 1, 2016 episode, opposite Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton and Michael Che as debate moderator Lester Holt.[32] The sketch was based on the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump. The episode also included impressions of members of Trump's family in a parody of the game show _Family Feud_.[33]

Further sketches with Baldwin included elements of the other presidential debates, the vice presidential debate, and the Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording controversy.[34]

The October 15 episode featured a parody of the third presidential debate.[35] Later in the episode, Baldwin and Cecily Strong appeared as Donald and Melania Trump, in a parody of Beyoncé's _Lemonade_. Host Emily Blunt portrayed Ivanka Trump, and Vanessa Bayer appeared as Trump's youngest daughter Tiffany Trump.

Trump reacted negatively to this episode on Twitter, saying that Baldwin's portrayal "stinks", and that it was "time to retire the boring and unfunny show."[36][37]

After election

Post-election sketches have included Baldwin's Trump meeting with people such as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mitt Romney, and Vladimir Putin, with humor drawn from the 2016 United States election interference by Russia. In February, it was reported that the show has had strong viewer ratings since the election.[38]

Several people who work closely with Trump have been frequently parodied. These include Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway (Kate McKinnon),[39] White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon (Mikey Day) with a Grim Reaper-like appearance,[40] White House Press Secretaries Sean Spicer (Melissa McCarthy),[41][42] and Sarah Huckabee Sanders (Aidy Bryant),[43] and United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions (Kate McKinnon).[44][45] Vice President Mike Pence is portrayed by Beck Bennett,[46] and Trump's sons Eric and Donald Jr by Alex Moffat and Mikey Day.[47] Elder daughter Ivanka Trump has also been featured, as portrayed by Scarlett Johansson.[48]

Trump tweeted his displeasure with the show in November, December, and January, saying "Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse." and "NBCNews is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!".[49][50]

In January 2017, _SNL_ writer Katie Rich was suspended from the show after she wrote a joking tweet saying that Trump's youngest son, Barron, would become "this country's first home school shooter." The tweet provoked significant outrage, and Rich apologized, calling it "inexcusable".[51][52]

_El Nacional_, a Dominican newspaper, mistakenly published Baldwin's picture instead of Trump's in February. The paper quickly apologized.[53][54]
