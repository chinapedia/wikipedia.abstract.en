In shogi, a HANDICAP game (駒落戦 _koma ochisen,_ 駒落ち _koma ochi,_ ハンデキャップ _handekyappu,_ 不利益 _furieki_) is a game setup used between players of disparate strengths, in which one or more pieces are removed from the stronger player's side. (Note that the missing pieces are not available for drops and play no further part in the game.)

In Japanese, the higher ranked player is called 上手 _uwate_ "handicap giver" while the lower player is 下手 _shitate_ "handicap receiver." These terms are usually translated in English simply as _White_ and _Black,_ respectively just like the way 先手 _sente_ and 後手 _gote_ are translated as _White_ and _Black_, respectively.

The imbalance created by this method of handicapping is not as strong as it is in western chess because material advantage is not as powerful in shogi.

An even game, that is a non-handicap game, is known as 平手 _hirate_ in Japanese.


Culture, tradition, pedagogy

In comparison with western chess, the attitude toward handicaps in shogi is quite different. Since shogi is arguably better suited for handicap play as captured pieces exchange sides, there is a strong tradition within shogi pedagogy for learning strategies appropriate to handicap games. Thus, most handicap games have been researched in detail and have developed traditional josekis (駒落ち定跡). Additionally, there are systems for determining what is the appropriate level of handicap to give players based on either the formal rank and/or skill level. (See §Handicaps and player rank below for the official system currently used by the Japan Shogi Association.)

In traditional shogi instruction, handicap games are still commonly used in developing skills for amateur players – particularly in determining how to balance defense and offensive (since the attacking power of Black is greater as the handicap increases). Additionally, handicap games have also traditionally been played between top ranked professional players and lower ranked professional players. Historically, handicap games were even played between top level professionals. For example, a Lance Handicap game between Kōzō Masuda and Meijin Yasuharu Ōyama for the 1956 Osho title is famous. According to the rules at the time (since changed), Masuda was required to give Ōyama a handicap since he had won the previous three even games. Nowadays, handicaps between 4-dan and above professionals are uncommon as shogi tournament practice has become more standardized. Most current handicaps between professionals are now Lance handicaps.


Rules

In handicap games, the stronger player (White/_uwate_) always has the first move except for the _sente_ handicap.

If a jishogi (持将棋 _jishōgi_ "impasse") occurs in a handicap game, the removed pieces are counted towards White's total.[1]

In practice, professional players playing against an amateur may also have a time handicap as well (that is, shorter time control than the amateur).

In modern book diagrams, the White player is usually shown as the top player even though White has first move. (Usually book diagrams show the 先手 _sente_ player with first move at the bottom of the board.)

In western shogi notation, the first pair of moves is shown with the _shitate_ player's move replaced by an ellipsis. For example: 1...G-42, 2. P-76 G-72.


Types of handicap games

In even games, which player has the first move is always determined by a pawn toss (振り駒 _furigoma_).

Therefore, the first handicap given to the lower-ranked player is for that player to always have first move as Black (先手 _sente_) instead of using a pawn toss. The reason for this is that there is a very slight statistical advantage for the Black player in professional games.

All further handicaps involve removing one or more pieces from the _uwate_ player. Handicaps, in increasing order of severity, include the following:

  English       Japanese   Omitted piece(s)
  ------------- ---------- ------------------
  Black         先手       _sente_
  Lance         香落ち     _kyō ochi_
  Bishop        角落ち     _kaku ochi_
  Rook          飛車落ち   _hisha ochi_
  Rook–Lance    飛香落ち   _hi-kyō ochi_
  2-Piece       二枚落ち   _ni-mai ochi_
  3-Piece       三枚落ち   _san-mai ochi_
  4-Piece       四枚落ち   _yon-mai ochi_
  5-Piece       五枚落ち   _go-mai ochi_
  6-Piece       六枚落ち   _roku-mai ochi_
  7-Piece       七枚落ち   _nana-mai ochi_
  8-Piece       八枚落ち   _hachi-mai ochi_
  9-Piece       九枚落ち   _kyū-mai ochi_
  10-Piece      十枚落ち   _jū-mai ochi_
  Three Pawns   歩三兵     _fu sanbyō_
  Naked King    裸玉       _hadaka gyoku_

Handicaps greater than 6-Piece are typically used when teaching the game to new players.[2] The standard handicap games 8-Piece and less have josekis associated with them. The 6-Piece handicap is very large and is estimated to be the equivalent of Queen odds (queen removed) in western chess or a 9-stone handicap in go.

The 3-Piece, 5-Piece, and 7-Piece handicaps are not commonly used. Although the 5-Piece is uncommon, according to Kaufman, many professionals feel that the 5-Piece is useful as there is a very large difference between 4-Piece and 6-Piece handicaps. However, Kaufman thinks the difference 2-Piece and 4-Piece is not so large as to make the 3-Piece useful.

The Right Lance handicap became obsolete officially since 1910. There are many historical Right Lance handicap game records dating all the way back to the Edo period.

The Silver handicaps are unofficial handicaps designed to be a little larger than the distance between and even game and a Lance handicap. The strategy used in these games is often quite similar to even games.

The Dragonfly handicaps can be found in some mobile apps and online playing sites (such as 81Dojo). It may be a useful handicap to learn about beneficial piece exchanges.[3]

Piece-in-hand handicaps

PIECE-IN-HAND HANDICAPS (駒持ち) are a newer nontraditional type of handicap where instead of taking the pieces from the stronger player's side and removing them from the game the pieces taken are given to the weaker player to put in their hand so that they may be used for drops as early as the weaker player's first move.[4] These handicaps may be used to teach new players to look for drop locations. Needless to say, giving White's pieces to Black to keep in hand creates much greater handicaps than compared with removing the same pieces from the game as with traditional handicaps.


Handicaps and player rank

The relationship between handicaps and differences in rank is not universally agreed upon, with several systems in use. The system used by the Japan Shogi Association at its headquarters in Tokyo the is as follows:[5][6][7]

-   Difference of 1 rank: lower ranked player moves first
-   Difference of 2 ranks: Lance
-   Difference of 3 ranks: Bishop
-   Difference of 4 ranks: Rook
-   Difference of 5 ranks: Rook–Lance
-   Difference of 6 or 7 ranks: 2-Piece
-   Difference of 8 or 9 ranks: 4-Piece
-   Difference of 10 or more ranks: 6-Piece

Note that these handicap–ranking systems are used for amateur players. Rank differences between professional players are actually smaller, and, therefore, the handicap–ranking systems used for amateurs is not appropriate. A professional 1-dan is estimated to be a little stronger than a 5-dan amateur player. Thus, a suitable handicap for a 1-dan professional playing against a 1-dan amateur is a difference in 5 ranks.

Historical systems

Earlier a different handicap–ranking system was used:

-   Difference of 1 rank: Lance
-   Difference of 2 ranks: Bishop
-   Difference of 3 ranks: Rook
-   Difference of 4 ranks: Rook–Lance
-   Difference of 5 ranks: 2-Piece
-   Difference of 6 ranks: Rook, Bishop, (left) Lance
-   Difference of 7 ranks: 4-Piece
-   Difference of 8 ranks: 5-Piece Left Knight
-   Difference of 9 ranks: 6-Piece
