_THE FOO SHOW_ is an interactive virtual reality talk show developed by Foo VR and created by Will Smith.[1] The first episode was released in April 2016 and the first full season is planned for release in December the same year.

Viewers watch the show through a compatible virtual reality headset and are able to move around and interact with the game world being discussed by the show's host and guests.


Content

The show takes the format of a talk show where Smith and the episode's guests discuss, move around, and interact with a three dimensional space.[2] Many of the episodes will be based on video games, but others will not.[3] The player is free to move around the world and interact with the same models the guests are talking about while listening to the discussion.[4] The host and guests record their movements through Virtual Reality headsets and controllers and are represented by low poly 3D models that move as they did in the real world while recording the episode.[5]


Development

Foo_Show_live_recording.gif Smith announced in September 2015 that he was leaving Tested.com to start his own virtual reality company which would focus on "some different ways to communicate in VR", saying that he had come to find VR "captivating".[6][7] Smith has said that he is interested in "figuring out the native language of VR storytelling" to create content that would be impossible in another format,[8] and is open to trying a number of different styles with their developed technology, from non-interactive linear experiences to full adventure games.[9] The show is produced through the use of HTC Vive headsets to capture the participants performances,[10] and is planned to run on a weekly schedule.[11]

In November 2016 Smith announced a Kickstarter campaign to fund the show's first, 5 episode, season for release in December, along with more episodes in January and February 2017.[12][13]
