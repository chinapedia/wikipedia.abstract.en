The HOUSE OF EGLOFFSTEIN is an ancient Franconian aristocratic family (_Uradel_) with an eponymous family home in the hill region of Franconian Switzerland in the Bavarian province of Upper Franconia. The family first appears in the records in 1187 with a _Heinrich genannt Stuchs_ ("Henry, named Stuchs") who is also the progenitor. The house belongs to the brotherhood of Franconian Imperial Knights.


History

Franconia

The Egloffsteins were a mighty, influential Franconian family of Imperial Knights with many branches. They belonged to the Knights' Cantons of Gebürg (_Ritterkanton Gebürg_) and Steigerwald (_Ritterkanton Steigerwald_), Gebürg being part of the old name for Franconian Switzerland.

In the 14th century, they not only had their own castles in Egloffstein,[1] but also in Stolzenrode, Leienfels, Burggaillenreuth, Neuhaus an der Pegnitz, Lauterbach, Wolfsberg, Wadendorf, Neunkirchen am Brand, Löhlitz and Henfenfeld as well as a water castle in Kunreuth. The Egloffsteins used their own allodial estates to found the chaplaincy in Egloffstein.

They were related _inter alia_ to the noble families of Lüchau and Rabensteiner zu Döhlau.

Family members engaged in numerous feuds with the Imperial City of Nuremberg.[2]

State of the Teutonic Order

The Egloffsteins had several estates in the State of the Teutonic Order, today Poland and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.

A village in Meistersfelde in present-day Poland was called Egloffstein (today: Główczyno) until 1945. Apparently Lagodzin (near Landsberg an der Warthe) also bore this name.

After the end of the Prussian War of the Cities, _Deutschmeister_, Conrad of Egloffstein, was given the town of Domnau as a fief and a reward for his military service. Conrad of Egloffstein built a new palace on an island in the river. The remains of the old castle were torn down in 1474.

Albert, Freiherr von und zu Egloffstein, had Arklitten Palace built in Arklitten between 1780 and 1782 in the Late Baroque style.

Arklitten

On 19 October 1786, Freiherr Albert Dietrich Gottfried von und zum Egloffstein, a Prussian major general and governor of East and West Prussia, and his brother, Otto Frederick Freiherr of Egloffstein, a Prussian major received the title of count, after the former had founded in 1783 the majorat of Arklitten in East Prussia.[5] This title was confirmed on 8 May 1914 in the Kingdom of Bavaria in the comital class. Its estates included the _fideicommissum_ of Arklitten, the county of Gerdauen, East Prussia, and, fromm 1889, the Upper Lusatian estates of Kromlau and Groß Düben.

Together with the line of free nobles, the counts of Egloffstein owned Schloss Kunreuth, the estates of Egloffstein, Schloss Schmölz and Schloss Theisenort. From the comital line come Counts Otto Dietrich, Albert Henry, Frederick-Eglolf, Albert and Frederick-Tassilo Rafael von und zu Egloffstein.

Family union

From 13 July 1358, a condominium (international law) foundation is mentioned in the records. This family union was re-established in 1505 by cathedral canon, Leonard of Egloffstein and became a registered society in 1911 as the Family Association of the Counts and Lords von und zu Egloffstein. A family day is held every six years in Kunreuth.

Coat of arms

The family coat of arms (_Stammwappen_) with its right-facing, black bear's head with a red tongue on a silver shield is recorded since 1317. On the helmet with its black and silver mantle to the right and black and gold mantle to the left, the bear's head is seen again.

The heraldic device of the Egloffstein bears is recalled on the ruins of the Egloffstein's Bärnfels Castle and Bärenthal Mill on the River Trubach. The coat of arms of Egloffstein with reversed tinctures recalls this family.
