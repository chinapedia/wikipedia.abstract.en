_ANTELLA_ is a genus of three species of crust fungi in the family Steccherinaceae.


Taxonomy

The genus was circumscribed by Finnish mycologist Otto Miettinen in 2016 with _Antella niemelaei_ as the type species. All three species were formerly classified in the polyphyletic genus _Antrodiella_. This is reflected in the name _Antella_, which is a "construct of letters from the genus name _Antrodiella_."[1]


Description

_Antella_ species have light-coloured, crust-like fruit bodies with a poroid surface. They have a dimitic hyphal system, with both generative and skeletal hyphae, and clamp connections in the hyphae. The thin-walled spores are ellipsoid, measuring less than 4.5 by 2.5 μm. There are well-differentiated gloeocystidia, a feature that helps differentiate _Antella_ from _Antrodiella_.[2]
