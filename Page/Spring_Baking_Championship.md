The fifth season will premiere on March 18, 2019, with Clinton Kelly replacing Khan as host.


Format

The series follows the same format with two rounds in each episode. The first round is the "Preliminary Heat" where the contestants must bake something centered around a specific theme (it's often a dessert but occasionally they'll have to make something savory in addition to a dessert). The person who wins the first round gets an advantage going into the next round and aren't told about it until the second round theme is announced. The advantage usually varies (Ex: Getting a few minutes head start or exclusive use of a specific flavor).

The second round is the "Main Heat" where the contestants get more time than the first round to create a larger confection that often follows along the same vein as the pre-heat theme. Partway through the main heat, there's often a curveball thrown in that has the bakers adapt or change their plans. (Ex: In "Bake the Rainbow", they had to incorporate the color black into their multi-colored desserts.)
