CAROLINA CONCEIÇÃO MARTINS PEREIRA (born 18 February 1983), commonly known as CAROL CARIOCA, is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a defender for Israeli club Hapoel Be'er Sheva FC.

She was part of the Equatorial Guinea women's national football team at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup.[1]

On October 5, 2017, FIFA declared Carol and other nine Brazilian footballers ineligible to play for Equatorial Guinea.[2]


Football career

Carolina Conceição Martins Pereira first became involved in footballer through her father, who she both attended games with and watched televised matches. She would also play street football with teams of boys, although her mother disapproved. Pereira is Brazilian by birth, but had been invited to Equatorial Guinea to play football in 2007. After staying in the country, she was recruited for the women's national football team. She caught malaria the following year, which she said was one of the low lights of her career along with the results of a career threatening ankle surgery in 2009 which she was told might mean she could no longer play football.[3] As a footballer, she plays under the name "Carol Carioca".[4]

In April 2010, she was one of several high profile players who helped draw the group states of the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup held later that year in Germany.[5] Pereira was included in the Equatorial Guinea squad for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, held in Germany.[6] This was the first time the nation had qualified to appear at the Women's World Cup, and Pereira said that doing so was her proudest moment as a footballer so far. The first round match between Equatorial Guinea and Brazil was the first time a Brazilian player naturalized for another nation had played against them in women's football.[7]

When Pereira was a member of the Equatorial Guinea team that won the 2012 African Women's Championship, she was one of 11 out of the 21 players who were naturalized Brazilians playing as Equatoguineans.
