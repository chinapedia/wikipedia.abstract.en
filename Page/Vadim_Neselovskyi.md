Early life and education

Born on November 8, 1977 in Odessa, Ukraine,[7] he was the youngest student (fifteen years old) to be accepted into Odessa Conservatory, and then moved to Dortmund, Germany when he was 17 years old. Shortly after arriving in Germany, Neselovskyi established himself on the local jazz scene, taking part in the Dusseldorf Jazz Rally and Leipzig Jazz Days. After a few years he moved to the USA to further his studies at Berklee College of Music, where he was asked to play and compose for a Berklee’s promotional recording produced by Pat Metheny, that also featured Esperanza Spalding and Christian Scott. Next education stage took place at the Thelonious Monk Institute where he was awarded a Full Scholarship as the pianist of an ensemble handpicked by Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter and Terence Blanchard.[8] During this time, he toured internationally with Herbie Hancock, Chaka Khan, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Terri Lyne Carrington and shared the stage with artists such as John Scofield, Terence Blanchard, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Benny Golson, Nicholas Payton and Steve Coleman.


Career

His solo piano CD _Music for September_ (Sunnyside Records, 2013) was produced by Fred Hersch and received 4-star review in Downbeat.[9] It was named one of the "Best of 2013" by jazz critics Ted Gioia and Bob Blumenthal.[10] Reviewers found the record “unique, surprising”, caring “its own thoughtful signature” (Christopher Barton, LA Times), “masterful”, reaching “places few pianists could reach with any piece” (Steve Boudreau, Ottawa Citizen).[11] Brad Farberman of Downbeat calls album's version of Body and Soul “gripping, unique…a reminder that standards are only as worn-out as we allow them to be”. The success of Music for September resulted in solo tours across Europe, US, Korea and Japan, including a rare 2-night solo piano engagement at Tokyo’s prestigious Cotton Club and a concert for Da Camera Music Society of Los Angeles. Another long-standing project, a duo with a unique Alphorn/Frenchhorn virtuoso Arkady Shilkloper (ECM Records) has been consistently touring Europe and put out 2 CD’s on German Neuklang Label.[12]
