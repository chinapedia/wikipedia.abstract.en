REOL (stylized as RΞOL) was a Japanese musical unit that consisted of vocalist/lyricist Reol, music arranger GigaP, and movie director/producer Okiku. The members of REOL originally worked as solo artists, but they signed to Toy's Factory as a group in 2015, using Reol's name for the project. Prior to this unit's formation, Reol and GigaP consistently worked together throughout Reol's solo career, eventually releasing an album together titled _No Title_. Their debut studio album as the unit REOL, _Sigma_, was released on October 19, 2016. They had announced that they had been planning to disband, and so they did in 2017.

Career

2014–2017: Prior releases and _Sigma_

Prior to the formation of REOL, the groups members, Reol and GigaP, had consistently worked together, providing compositions and vocals to several Japanese vocaloids including Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Rin, Kagamine Len and more.[1] Their first release as a duo through label, Celo Project, was _No Title_, which was released on August 17, 2014.[2] Additionally, Reol worked on her 2015 debut studio album, titled _Gokusaishiki_, which reached the top ten on the Oricon Albums Chart.[3]

Subsequently, Reol, GigaP, and movie director Okiku signed a recording contract to Japanese label Toy's Factory, forming themselves as a unit under Reol's name.[4] Despite its release, the group had stayed anonymous with their identity, using anime-influenced illustrations to depict themselves; several other animations were also distributed in their subsequent music videos.[5] On August 18, 2016, they announced the release for their studio album _Sigma_, scheduled on October 19, 2016.[6] Additionally, they released three visuals from the album; "ChiruChiru", "Give Me a Break Stop Now" and "YoiYoi Kokon".[7][8][9] Released on its initial date, _Sigma_ debuted at number six on the Daily Oricon Albums Chart.[10]

On August 1, 2017, REOL announced that they would separate in October 2017 after playing their final two shows.[11]
