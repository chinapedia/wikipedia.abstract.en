According to Rabbi Yahya Yousef Salem who is the rabbi of a Jewish community that has lived in the northern province of Saada, The community is very old in his words “Jewish settlement in Saada could be as old as the Torah”.[1]

According to A report made in 1999 by the US state department, Approximately 500 Jews are scattered in a handful of villages between Sana'a and Saada in northern Yemen.[2]

David carasso who was a Jewish merchant from Thessaloniki, spent his years 1874-9 in Yemen, and described the Saada Jews as a “warrior Jews”, he also mentioned the good relationship between the Arabs of the area and the Saada community Jews.[3]

The Jews from that area were to be found strong and tall, they were belong to a bellicose race, and were always armed in the Arab way with a curved djambi and the rifle.[4]

In 1908 a group left the remote areas of Saada, they made their way to Palestine through the coast of Ashir, with a boat from there.[5]

A homemade alcohol was made by the Jews in the area and was consumed with khat, as a social aspect of life it was consumed in a small group, and described in a testimony from the early 1900s as a "delightful time".[6]

An example for a Muslim prosecution was describe in 1992 as Jews from the Saada area were not allowed to put burial stones on their graves, it was forbidden. Another prohibition from 1992 was that a cooking utensils cannot be shared by Jews, if it has been used by Muslims.[7]

Sanaa’s Jewish community lives in a guarded district under the protection of the central government, after fleeing to the capital from the town of Saada following Houthis threats in 2007.[8]

“We warn you to leave the area immediately... Ignore this message, and we give you a period of 10 days, and you will regret it,” a Houthi representative warned the Jewish community of Saada at the time.[9]

They sought refuge in the night with Sheikh Bakhtan – Jews have traditionally been protected by tribal sheikhs. It was Sheikh Bakhtan who drove the rabbi’s family to the capital, where the community of 70 remains under the president’s protection.[10]

According to a report made by The U.S Department Of State in 2008, Jews in Yemen are the only indigenous non-Muslim religious minority. Nearly all of the once-sizable Jewish population has emigrated. Fewer than 400 Jews remain in the northern part of the country, primarily in Amran Governorate. Since January 2007 the historic Saada Governorate community of 45 Jews has lived in Sana'a, under the protection and care of the Government, after abandoning their homes in the face of threats from al-Houthi rebels. The community has abandoned its synagogues in Saada. There is at least one functioning synagogue in Amran Governorate.[11]

In the year 2015, only 70 Jews from Saada remain. All were driven from their homes in the northern province at gunpoint by Zaidi Houthi rebels and told never to return.[12]

Currently to 2016 it is estimated that around 40 Jews are left in Yemen.[13]
