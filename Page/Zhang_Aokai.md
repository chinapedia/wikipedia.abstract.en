ZHANG AOKAI (; ; born 18 February 2000), original name ZHANG OK (),[1] is a Chinese footballer who plays for Spanish side RCD Espanyol Juvenil A team.[2]


Club career

Zhang Aokai joined Chinese Super League side Guangzhou Evergrande's youth academy from China League Two club Shaanxi Daqin in 2012.[3] He was promoted to Guangzhou's first team squad by manager Luiz Felipe Scolari in July 2016.[4] Zhang made his senior debut on 30 October 2016 in a 4–0 home win against Shandong Luneng, coming on for Zheng Zhi in the 85th minute and taking over the captaincy for the rest of the match,[5] making him the first player born in the new millennium to make an appearance in any of the Chinese professional leagues.[6]

Zhang was excluded from Guangzhou's first team squad for the 2017 season. He left the club and underwent a trial with La Liga side Espanyol in the summer of 2017.[7] He signed a professional contract with Espanyol and joined Juvenil A team on 19 July 2018.[8]


Personal life

Zhang Aokai's original name was Zhang OK; however, his given name violated the _Name Registration Ordinance of the People's Republic of China_; and thus, he could not apply for an identification card. Zhang's father changed his given name to Aokai, which shares a similar pronunciation with OK.[9]
