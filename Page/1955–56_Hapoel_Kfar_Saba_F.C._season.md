The 1955–56 HAPOEL KFAR SABA SEASON was the club's 29th season since its establishment in 1928, and 8th since the establishment of the State of Israel.

At the start of the season, the league which started during the previous season was completed, with the club finishing 12th (out of 14), which meant the club had to compete in a promotion/relegation play-offs against the 11th placed club, Beitar Jerusalem, and the two Liga Bet winners, Maccabi Jaffa and Hapoel Kiryat Haim. Haopel Kfar Saba placed 2nd in the play-offs, preserving their top division status.[1]

The new league season, with the top division being renamed Liga Leumit, began on 3 December 1955 and was completed on 3 June 1956, with the club finishing in 12th and bottom position, relegating to Liga Alef.[2]
