_STAR WARS: ASSAULT ON HOTH_ is a two-player strategic board game produced by West End Games and designed by Paul Murphy that recreates the Battle of Hoth as depicted in _Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back_.[1]


Gameplay

Each player takes the side of the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire on a hex map that depicts the snowy terrain of Hoth as Imperial forces attempt to destroy the Echo Base shield generator before five Rebel transports escape. Cardboard counters represent the various Rebel and Imperial soldiers and vehicles that participated in the Battle of Hoth, including Rebel light and heavy infantry, Imperial snowtrooper light and heavy infantry, AT-ST and AT-AT walkers, laser towers, and snowspeeder aircraft.

Movement is determined using a deck of 20 Action Cards that denotes which unit moves next and what actions is it allowed to perform. If an Action Card says to “Draw Event,” then a card is chosen from that deck that lists reinforcements, special unit bonuses, or a “Transport Away!” card.[2]

In addition to hexes that determine unit placement and movement, _Star Wars: Assault on Hoth_ incorporates “macro hexes” that are used to determine range between units engaged in combat. The game is played using two standard six-sided dice, as well as eight special six-sided dice that each have two blank sides, two Darth Vader sides, and two lightsaber sides. To determine hits, the Imperial player only counts Darth Vader results and the Rebel player only counts lightsaber results. In addition, there are three terrain types (clear, rough, and cliffs) that provide strategic advantages and impact unit movement.[3]

In addition to units on the map, the Rebel player also secretly assigns Luke Skywalker to one of the snowspeeders and does not reveal his identity until the player is ready to use Luke’s “Force Points” that allow him to boost his vehicle’s armor or firepower, as well as reduce the impact of critical hits against his speeder.[4]

The Imperial player wins if he destroys the shield generator before the fifth “Transport Away!” Event Card is drawn. The Imperial player may increase his likelihood of destroying the generator if he also destroys the Power Grid. The Rebel player wins once the fifth “Transport Away!” card is drawn or if he destroys all Imperial units on the map.[5]


Publication history

Released in 1988, _Star Wars: Assault on Hoth_ was one of the first products published by West End Games when it first acquired the _Star Wars_ license. (Other products included _Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game_ and its supplement books, the _Star Wars Miniatures Game_, and additional board games such _Star Wars: Star Warriors_, _Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star_, and _Star Wars: Battle for Endor_.)


Reception

In the November 1989 edition of _Dragon_, Jim Bambra called _Assault on Hoth_ "an exciting board game that uses an innovative move and action sequence to recreate the battle featured in the opening scenes of _The Empire Strikes Back_. The game moves at a fast pace and is easy to learn and play."[6]
