_BARBEQUE DOG_ is an album by Ronald Shannon Jackson and The Decoding Society recorded in 1983 for the Antilles label.[1]


Reception

The Allmusic review by Brian Olewnick stated "_Barbecue Dog_ doesn't quite reach the explosive heights of its predecessor, but is arguably the next best item in Jackson's discography. The band strikes a comfortable balance between the horns and the electric instruments, allowing each to surface when needed, and also complements the required barnburners with more contemplative pieces".[2]
