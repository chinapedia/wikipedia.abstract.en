Born in Christchurch, Armstrong began karting in 2010, winning major titles from 2011 onwards. While still karting, Armstrong graduated to single seaters in 2014 in the 2014–15 season of New Zealand Formula Ford Championship.

In 2016, Armstrong once again diversified his karting with stints in BRDC British Formula 3 and the two Formula Renault 2.0 series.

In November 2016, Armstrong was among five drivers invited to join the Ferrari Driver Academy and was confirmed as a member the following month.[2][3] That same month, he was confirmed to race in the 2017 Toyota Racing Series with M2 Competition, where he took three wins and finished fourth overall.[4]

In February 2017, it was announced Armstrong would race in both the ADAC F4 and Italian F4 championships with Prema Powerteam.[5] Claiming seven wins across both series, Armstrong finished runner-up in ADAC F4 and as 2017 Italian F4 champion.[6]

For 2018, Armstrong returned to the Toyota Racing Series and continued his collaboration with Prema, graduating to the FIA Formula 3 European Championship, alongside fellow Ferrari juniors Robert Shwartzman and Guanyu Zhou[7][8] where he scored a race win at the Norisring and claimed fifth in the championship.[9] At the season ending Macau Grand Prix he finished ninth.[10]

The following year, Armstrong reunited with both Prema and M2 Competition to contest the inaugural FIA Formula 3 Championship and the Toyota Racing Series with the respective teams.[11][12] In TRS, Armstrong took five victories, but missed out on the title in the season ending New Zealand Grand Prix to fellow countryman Liam Lawson.[13] In April 2019, Armstrong joined Nicolas Todt's All Road Management scheme.[14]
