_MU PING_ (, ) is a street food in Thailand.


Preparation

It is Thai-style grilled pork on a skewer that is marinated in pounded coriander roots, peppers and garlics together and is then grilled over a charcoal BBQ.[1] _Mu ping_ has many different recipes, each with a different marinade. Coconut milk is indispensable because it tenderizes the pork.

_Mu ping_ is served with sticky rice and _namchim chaeo_. _Namchim chaeo_ is a spicy sauce which complements grilled meat.[2]

_Mu ping_ is convenient for breakfast or commuting because it is easy to find on the street. It is affordable (five to ten baht).[3]
