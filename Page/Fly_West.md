''FLY WEST'' (1974) is an autobiography written for children by Australian author Ivan Southall.[1] It won the Children's Book of the Year Award: Older Readers in 1976.'''[2]


Book outline

The book tells the story of Ivan Southall's time as a captain of a Sunderland flying boat during World War II.


Critical reception

A reviewer in _The Sydney Morning Herald_ noted: "_Fly West_ is not for those who like to find vicarious excitement in the reading of war books. Ivan Southall gives the truth of the times, and melancholy tinges his account as he writes of men who died, of men who survived to find that evil has triumphed more often than right."[3]
