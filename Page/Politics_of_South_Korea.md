Politics of Korea|the article about the politics of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|Politics of North Korea}} ROK_election_system_and_separation_of_powers_(en).svg and the election system of South Korea]]

The POLITICS OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA takes place in the framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President is the head of state, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature and comprises a Supreme Court, appellate courts and a Constitutional Court. Since 1948, the constitution has undergone five major revisions, each signifying a new republic. The current Sixth Republic began with the last major constitutional revision in 1987.

The Economist Intelligence Unit has rated South Korea as the 20th most democratic country in 2017, the highest ranked Asian country and above Belgium, France or the United States.[1]

Under Lee Myung-bak's presidency, the South Korean intelligence services (NIS) orchestrated campaigns to manipulate public opinion. NIS-led "NGOs" have conducted media campaigns against opponents of the government; denounced the "buses of hope" (which emerged to support a trade union movement in 2011), criticised proposals for free school meals and free medical care and called for the disbandment of the Democratic Labour Party. In 2012, the NIS conducted a slander campaign against the presidential candidate Moon Jae-in in order to divert voters to the conservative candidate Park Geun-hye. In February 2015, the former head of the NIS was sentenced to three years in prison for his role in these manipulations[2]


National government

Executive branch

|President |Moon Jae-in |Democratic Party of Korea |10 May 2017 |- |Prime Minister |Lee Nak-yeon |Democratic Party of Korea |31 May 2017 |} The head of state is the president, who is elected by direct popular vote for a single five-year[3] term. The president is Commander-in-Chief of the armed force of South Korea and enjoys considerable executive powers.

The president appoints the prime minister with approval of the National Assembly, as well as appointing and presiding over the State Council of chief ministers as the head of government. On 12 March 2004, the executive power of then president Roh Moo-hyun was suspended when the Assembly voted to impeach him and Prime Minister Goh Kun became an Acting President. On 14 May 2004, the Constitutional Court overturned the impeachment decision made by the Assembly and Roh was reinstated.

On 10 March 2017, Park Geun-hye became the first president to be removed by the Constitutional Court after impeachment by the National Assembly. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn temporarily served as an acting president between the suspension of Park since 9 December 2016 until the next presidential election, which was held in May 2017. On 9 May 2017, Moon Jae-in became the 19th president of South Korea, replacing acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn.

Legislative branch

Seoul-National.Assembly-02.jpg in Seoul]] The National Assembly (, , _gukhoe_) has 300 members, elected for a four-year term, 253 members in single-seat constituencies and 47 members by proportional representation. The ruling Democratic Party of Korea is the largest party in the Assembly.

Judicial branch

The South Korean judiciary is independent of the other two branches. The highest judiciary body is the Supreme Court, whose justices are appointed by the president with the consent of the National Assembly. In addition, the Constitutional Court oversees questions of constitutionality. South Korea has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction.


Political parties and elections

South Korea elects on national level a head of state – the president – and a legislature. The president is elected for a five-year term by the people. The National Assembly (_Gukhoe_) has 300 members, elected for a four-year term, 246 members in single-seat constituencies and 54 members by proportional representation.

The main two political parties in South Korea are the liberal Democratic Party of Korea (lit. "Together Democratic Party", DPK) and the conservative Liberty Korea Party (LKP). The liberal camp and the conservative camp are the dominant forces of South Korean politics at present.

Political nature

South Korea's political history has always been prone to splits from and merges with other parties. One reason is that there is greater empathise around the 'politics of the person' and rather than party, therefore party loyalty is not strong when disagreements occur. The graph below illustrates the extent of the political volatility within the last 10 years alone. These splits were intensified after the 2016 South Korean political scandal.
