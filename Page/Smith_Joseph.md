SMITH JOSEPH, the Democratic mayor of North Miami, Florida and a physician, was born in Haiti in 1961. Joseph emigrated to the United States in 1979 with his family to Miami, Florida. He graduated from Florida A&M University and Nova Southeastern University, later opening a medical practice in 2001.[1] Joseph was also the co-founder of the Society of Haitian American Professionals.[2]

Following the suspension from office of Mayor Lucie Tondreau in 2014, Joseph was elected Mayor of North Miami against former Mayor Kevin Burns.[3]

After the shooting of Charles Kinsey, Mayor Joseph responded by saying "I have made it clear that I will not tolerate anything that goes against the process."[4]

On 28 May 2019, Philippe Bien-Aime was sworn to succeed Joseph as mayor of North Miami.[5]
