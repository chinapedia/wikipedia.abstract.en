Synopsis

The Wade family is composed of Linda, Michael and their two daughters, Rachel and Anna. Michael decides to investigate his wife's past with the collaboration of his younger daughter, Anna, because he barely knows details about her origins and the previous years to know her. One day he receives a package of information about Linda, which contains a mysterious piece of metal, when manipulated, opens the door for an entity that seems to possess him. A series of events during that night provoke Linda's death in a tragic way, after being run over by Rachel's boyfriend, Matt.

Two years after these events, the Wade sisters decide to return home coinciding with Matt's release from prison, but everything seems to have changed in a town that seems to be abandoned and where its few inhabitants behave strangely. The remaining people act in a strange manner that may be tied to their dead mother's mysterious past and the strange object.

Reception

Screen Anarchy reviewed the film, commenting that "For a debut feature film it shows great promise for Hendrickson who, like only a few others, can seemingly move between videogames and film with ease.[4] Bloody Disgusting rated the movie at three skulls, writing that "Despite a great setup, _The Hollow One_ stumbled with falling into familiar territory with many aspects of its characters."[5] Film School Rejects was also mixed in their review, which stated that "So many horror films follow similar, generic setups and frameworks that it usually comes down to how well the familiar is executed rather than how fresh it all feels, so it’s exciting when a genre film makes the creative effort to build something new. _The Hollow One_ does just that, but its building blocks too frequently become stumbling blocks along the way."[6]
