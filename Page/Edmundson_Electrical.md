History

The company was founded in the early 19th century by Joshua Edmundson, with the company developing into one of the first suppliers of electricity to being a major distributor of electrical equipment. The company serves the United Kingdom through more than 320 branches, supplying a range of electrical items.

Acquisitions have accelerated the company's growth. The largest of these came in 2011, when the company acquired Electric Center from Wolseley plc for £40.6m.[11][12] This added a further 90 branches to the existing Edmundson network of 250 branches, giving it significant control over the market. The deal was cleared by the Office of Fair Trading in 2012[13] after the company agreed to sell a number of branches to Abbey Cross Trading Ltd.[14]

Prior to being acquired, Electric Center achieved sales of £130m earning profits of £1.5m.[15] The company has also expanded through several smaller acquisitions, including Cable Management Centre (2008),[16] Western Electrical for £3.2m (2014),[17] and Lockwell Electrical £8.8m (2015)[18][19] as well as Bennett & Fountain, Walsall, GA Nicholas and Specialist Lamp Distributors[20]

According to a filing with Companies House, in October 2016, Marlow Investments Ltd changed the name to Plumbing And Heating Investments Ltd.[21][22] In the end of 2016, the company acquired East Anglia's leading plumbing wholesaler, Plumbcity Ltd[23][24] parent of Gallery Bathrooms Ltd, Plumbclick Ltd and Plumbclick.co.uk Ltd.

In the financial year of 2015, Plumbcity recorded revenues of £26 million. In the same month the company acquired the leading plumbers merchant in the South of England, Heating Plumbing Supplies Group Ltd[25] and its subsidiary Heating Plumbing Supplies Ltd.[26] The transaction significantly expanded the groups influence, with over 30 branches gained and revenue of more than £53 million in 2015, and adding to the pre existing presence through the East Midlands based merchant, G.B Willbond Limited.[27]

During the 2016 financial year the group acquired Cheshire Electrical Supplies Ltd, Novoplast Kunstoffen, Deutsche ADP and Oak Electrical Ltd[28] for a combined total of £83.8 million.[29]
