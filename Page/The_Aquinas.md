History

The_Aquinas_1916.jpg _The Aquinas_, the university's first student publication, was originally established in 1916 as the monthly literary magazine of St. Thomas College, now called the University of Scranton.[1] The inaugural issue of _The Aquinas_ was published in January 1916.[2] The publication remained a literary magazine from 1916 until 1931, with the final issue of each academic year serving as a yearbook for St. Thomas College's graduating class.[3]

In 1931, _The Aquinas_ became the student newspaper of St. Thomas College.[4] (The school was renamed The University of Scranton in 1938). The newspaper has been published weekly or biweekly throughout its history.[5] _The Aquinas_ is presently a weekly newspaper, published on Thursdays.[6]

In February 2014, the newspaper's staff released an editorial calling for improved access to information, including university crime statistics.[7]
