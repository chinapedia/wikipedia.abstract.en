ANDELA is an African company that identifies and develops software developers. The company launched operations in Nigeria in 2014, to help global companies overcome the severe shortage of skilled software developers and has offices in Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and the United States.[1]


History

Andela was founded in 2014 by four professionals who were working in the online education and recruitment business. The founders, Ian Carnevale, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, Jeremy Johnson from 2U and Christina Sass,[2] started Andela as a training company to match developers in emerging markets not known as technology hubs[3] with North American companies. In June 2016, the company received funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. In 2017, Andela raised $40 million in Series C funding. The investment came from CRE Venture Capital, DBL Partners, Amplo, Salesforce Ventures and TLcom Capital, becoming one of the most highly funded African companies not based in Africa.[4]

In November 2018 it officially launched its office in Rwanda.

In January 2019 Andela raised $100 million in the next round of funding.[5]
