Plot

Ravi (Thalaivasal Vijay), his wife Gowri (Aishwarya), and their little daughter Abhirami (Shamili) move in an abandoned house. Ravi starts to work as an export manager in Ananthu (Keerikkadan Jose) and Swamy's (Thyagu) company. Ravi is helped in his work by the police officer Rajasekhar (Raviraj), the customs officer Ameer (Murali Kumar), and Ananthu's son Balaji (Prabhakaran). That night, strange things happen in their house. Abhirami often meets the old man Adaikalam (M. N. Nambiar) after the school in secret.

One day, Ameer, scared of something, accidentally falls off the ship and dies. The next day, Balaji is set on fire and dies from severe burns. TAdaikalam then confesses to Gowri that Abhirami is in fact possessed by the spirit of his granddaughter Angela.

Four years ago, Adaikalam's son Assistant Commissioner of Police Lawrence (Ramki) got a transfer in a harbour city. He and his pregnant wife Thulasi (Sreeja) moved to the city and eagerly waited for the birth of their baby. The scanning had revealed that the baby is a girl, so they named her Angela. From the very earliest days of his posting, Lawrence became well-known by the local criminals. The smuggler Ananthu, his brother Swamy, and Balaji even threatened Lawrence and his wife, but Lawrence continued to seize Ananthu's illegal loads. Lawrence became friends with the Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajasekhar, his colleague. One night, Lawrence arrested Ananthu, Swamy, Balaji, and Ameer. They were all locked in the local police station. Rajasekhar released them and betrayed Lawrence's trust. Later that night, Lawrence was brutally killed and Thulasi was severely beaten up by the criminals in their house, resulting in abortion which left her mentally ill.

Ananthu, Swamy, and Rajasekhar also realize that Abhirami is possessed by the spirit. They are urged to kill the little girl. What transpires next forms the rest of the story.
