EDRISA LUBEGA is an Ugandan footballer who is now playing for SV Ried on loan from Proline FC.[1] Christened 'Torres' after Fernando Torres, he was born to a family with 4 children to Mugisha Tumushabe and Rebecca Nakamya.[2] He scored in their first win of the 2016-17 Uganda Super League.[3]

Before Proline FC were promoted, when they were playing in the FUFA Big League, he was their top striker, scoring 21 goals, which enabled him to be selected for the Uganda national football team.[4]

Unbeknownst to his school, Dynamic S.S., Lubega left to play for Proline FC without notifying anybody related to the school whatsoever or the competition secretariat, therefore couldn't participate in the 2016 Copa Coca-Cola Schools tournament according to the rules.[5]
