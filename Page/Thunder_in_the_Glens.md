THUNDER IN THE GLENS is an annual Harley-Davidson bike rally held in Aviemore, Scotland, established in 1996. The event is run by the Dunedin Chapter of the Harley Owners Group (HOG), based in Edinburgh.[1] Running over the last weekend of August every year, the event consists of Harley-Davidson displays, rallies and live music. Scottish rock band Big Country, and band RPJ[2] performed at the 2016 festival.[3][4] People travel from around the world to attend.[5]

Thunder in the Glens is currently the largest HOG chapter rally in the United Kingdom[6] and Europe.[7][8] Although mainly for Harley-Davidson bikes, the event is open to all bikers.

The rally on the Saturday consists of an organised ride from Aviemore through the Scottish Highlands to Grantown on Spey.[9][10]

When the event first started, there were around 200 participants in the rally.[11] In 2015, there was over 3000 bikers,[12] and by 2016, it rose to 4000.[13]

There are over 60 charity stands at the event, as well as opportunities to test bikes and Jeep cars.[14] The profits from Thunder go to local charities.[15]

The event is said to substantially boost the local economy of the town of Aviemore. It was suggested the event contributed Â£15million to the Aviemore economy in 2016.[16] Although local residents were initially hesitant about the event, nervous the bikers would be similar to those depicted in films such as _The Wild One_, the bikers are now welcomed into the town every year.[17]

In 2016, Thunder in the Glens celebrated its 20th anniversary.[18][19][20]
