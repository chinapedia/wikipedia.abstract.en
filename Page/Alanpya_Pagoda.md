ALANPYA PAGODA (; also known as SIGNAL PAGODA) is a Burmese pagoda located on Alanpya Hill, on the southern part of Dhammarakhita Hill, in Yangon, Myanmar.[1] The pagoda is south of Maha Wizaya Pagoda.


Names

Alanpya Pagoda is known by a number of various names. During British rule in Burma, the pagoda acquired its present-day name, SIGNAL PAGODA (ALANPYA ZEDI in Burmese), because it was used as a signal station for vessels coming up Yangon River.[2] It was also known as MCCREAGH'S PAGODA, after Brigadier McCreagh, and as SALE'S PAGODA, after Lieutenant Robert Sale, who was stationed there during the First Anglo-Burmese War.[3] The pagoda has also been known as SANDAWKYO PAGODA (ဆံတော်ကြိုစေတီ), GURKHA PAGODA, and TATOO PAGODA (တပ်ဦးစေတီ), as well as by its Mon language name, KYAIK HAPAW CIH (ကျာ်ထပှ်ထစှေ်, ).[4]


History

According to the Shwedagon Chronicle, the pagoda pre-dates Shwedagon Pagoda, and was built on the site of a pavilion honoring the arrival of the Buddha's hair relics.[5] The pagoda was toppled in 1348 and subsequently renovated by King Razadarit.[6] In 1452, Queen Shin Sawbu gilded the entire pagoda, which was reconstructed by King Bayinnaung in 1564.[7] The pagoda was rebuilt yet again in 1775 by Min Letwe, King Hsinbyushin's minister.[8] The pagoda's site subsequently became a military encampment for British forces following the First Anglo-Burmese War.[9] The pagoda's present hti (umbrella) was donated in November 1910.[10]
