K-T.V. (also known as _Kids TV_) was a kids' network broadcast in Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Cyprus and South Africa as a programming block on M-NET and later on FilmNet. It was owned by Multichoice. In Greece, it used to air in the morning and afternoon on Alfa TV exclusively for NOVA.
Its sister programming block was K-TV WORLD (also known as _K-World_), which aired mostly in the afternoon, while K-T.V. aired in the morning.


History

SCANDINAVIA and THE NETHERLANDS: It was a programming block on _Filmnet_ (temporary called _FilmNet Plus_ and renamed later as _FilmNet 1_ in Sweden), from January 1, 1993 to January 11, 1997. It was broadcasting in the mornings and the noon/afternoon.[1] It had a sister programming block called "K-TV mini".
GREECE: The network was replaced on October 1, 2001, by Fox Kids. However, the site and the club were still active.
CYPRUS: It was a programming block on Alfa TV,[2] until January 2002, when it was replaced by a Nickelodeon one.[3] The block is not to be confused with _Kids TV_, the K-T.V. block's spiritual successor, independently managed by the channel itself.
