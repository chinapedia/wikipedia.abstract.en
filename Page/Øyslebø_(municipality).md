History

Øyslebø_1942.jpeg The municipality of Øyslebø was established on 1 January 1899 when the old municipality of Øyslebø og Laudal was split into two separate municipalities: Laudal and Øyslebø (population: 991). On 1 January 1964, the Brunvatne area of Øyslebø (population: 44) was transferred to the neighboring municipality of Søgne. Also on that date, the rest of Øyslebø was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Laudal and Bjelland as well as a portion of Finsland to form the new municipality of Marnardal. Prior to the merger, Øyslebø had a population of 1,068.[2]


Name

The municipality (originally the parish) of Øyslebø (Old Norse: _Øyðslubœr_) is named after the old _Øyslebø_ farm, where Øyslebø Church is located. The name is derived from the old river name, _Øyðsla_.[3] The name was previously spelled _Øslebø_ or _Øislebø_.
