Introduction

History

The game reached Sarajevo in 1903.[1] The city was under Austro-Hungarian rule when official competition began in 1908.[2] At the outbreak of World War I, there were four clubs in Sarajevo; SAŠK, Slavija, Đerzelez (also known as _Sarajevski_) and Barkohba.[3] After the World War I SAŠK and Slavija played in the Yugoslav First League, both becoming finalists and vice-champions (in 1923 and 1936). Most of the old clubs were dissolved in 1945 and soon many new like Torpedo Sarajevo were founded. Sarajevo became Yugoslav champions in 1967 and 1985, Željezničar in 1972. After the war and dissolution of Yugoslavia all Sarajevo clubs joined the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
