A GOOGOLPLEX is the number 10, or equivalently, 10. Written out in ordinary decimal notation, it is 1 followed by 10¹⁰⁰ zeroes, that is, a 1 followed by a googol zeroes.


History

In 1920, Edward Kasner's nine-year-old nephew, Milton Sirotta, coined the term _googol_, which is 10, then proposed the further term _googolplex_ to be "one, followed by writing zeroes until you get tired".[1] Kasner decided to adopt a more formal definition because "different people get tired at different times and it would never do to have Carnera a better mathematician than Dr. Einstein, simply because he had more endurance and could write for longer".[2] It thus became standardized to 10.


Size

A typical book can be printed with 10 zeros (around 400 pages with 50 lines per page and 50 zeros per line). Therefore, it requires 10 such books to print all the zeros of a googolplex (that is, printing a googol zeros). If each book had a mass of 100 grams, all of them would have a total mass of 10 kilograms. In comparison, Earth's mass is 5.972 x 10 kilograms, and the mass of the Milky Way Galaxy is estimated at 2.5 x 10 kilograms.

In pure mathematics

In pure mathematics, there are several notational methods for representing large numbers by which the magnitude of a googolplex could be represented, such as tetration, hyperoperation, Knuth's up-arrow notation, Steinhaus–Moser notation, or Conway chained arrow notation.

In the physical universe

In the PBS science program _Cosmos: A Personal Voyage_, Episode 9: "The Lives of the Stars", astronomer and television personality Carl Sagan estimated that writing a googolplex in full decimal form (i.e., "10,000,000,000...") would be physically impossible, since doing so would require more space than is available in the known universe.

One googol is presumed to be greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe, which has been estimated to be approximately 10⁷⁸.[3] Thus, in the physical world, it is difficult to give examples of numbers that compare to the vastly greater googolplex. However, in analyzing quantum states and black holes, physicist Don Page writes that "determining experimentally whether or not information is lost down black holes of solar mass ... would require more than 10 measurements to give a rough determination of the final density matrix after a black hole evaporates".[4] The end of the universe via Big Freeze without proton decay is expected to be around 10 years into the future.

In a separate article, Page shows that the number of states in a black hole with a mass roughly equivalent to the Andromeda Galaxy is in the range of a googolplex.[5]

Writing the number would take an extreme amount of time: if a person can write two digits per second, then writing a googolplex would take about 1.51 years, which is about 1.1 times the accepted age of the universe.[6]

is a high estimate of the elementary particles existing in the visible universe (not including dark matter), mostly photons and other massless force carriers.[7] There are ! or around ways to arrange these particles.


Mod _n_

The residues (mod _n_) of a googolplex are

    0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 1, 0, 1, 4, 3, 4, 10, 0, 1, 10, 9, 0, 4, 12, 13, 16, 0, 16, 10, 4, 24, 10, 5, 0, 1, 18, 25, 28, 10, 28, 16, 0, 1, 4, 24, 12, 10, 36, 9, 16, 4, 0, ...
