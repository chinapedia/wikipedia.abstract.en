_EUCALYPTUS CONGLOBATA_, also known as the CONG MALLEE or PORT LINCOLN MALLEE,[1] is a species of eucalypt that is native to the south coast of Western Australia and South Australia. It is a mallee with smooth bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and clustered hemispherical fruit.Eucalyptus_conglobata_buds.jpgEucalyptus_conglobata_fruit.jpg


Description

_Eucalyptus conglomerata_ is a mallee that typically grows to a height of or rarely a tree to . It has smooth grey to brown-tan over creamy grey bark. Its young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section, and leaves that are dull bluish green, egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves are usually dull bluish green, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a peduncle up to long, the individual buds sessile. Mature buds are crowded together, oval, green to yellow, long and wide. Flowering occurs from November to May and the flowers are white. The fruit are woody hemispherical capsules crowded together and flattened on one side.[2][3][4][5][6]


Taxonomy and naming

Cong mallee was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham from an unpublished description by Robert Brown who gave it the name_Eucalyptus dumosa_ var. _conglobata_.[7] The description was published in _Flora Australiensis_.[8] In 1922, Joseph Maiden raised the variety to species status as _Eucalyptus conglobata_.[9][10]

In 1972 Ian Brooker described two subspecies, subsp. _conglobata_ as a synonym of _Eucalyptus dumosa_ var. _conglobata_, and subsp. _fraseri_.[11] _Eucalyptus conglobata_ (R.Br. ex Benth.) Maiden subsp. _conglobata_ is accepted by the Australian Plant Census.[12]

In 2004, Brooker and Andrew Slee described _Eucalyptus conglobata_ subsp. _perata_, a name that has been accepted by the Australian Plant Census.[13][14]

The specific epithet (_conglobata_) is derived from the Latin words _globatus_ meaning "make into a ball"[15] with the prefix _con-_ meaning "together"[16] possibly referring to the clusters of flower buds and fruit.[17] The name _perata_ is from the Ancient Greek _peratos_ meaning "on the opposite side" or "west",[18] referring to the distribution of this subspecies comared to subspecies _congloberata_.[19]

Subspecies _conglobata_ has fruit that are in diameter whereas subspecies _perata_ has narrower leaves, smaller buds and fruit in diameter.[20]


Distribution and habitat

Cong mallee grows in tall shrubland. Subspecies _conglobata_ is the only subspecies occurring in South Australia where it occurs near Port Lincoln, but is also common between Israelite Bay, Esperance and Salmon Gums.[21][22] Subspecies _perata_ is common west of Esperance, including in the Stirling Ranges, Fitzgerald River National Park and Ravensthorpe. Where the ranges overlap, it is difficult to distinguish between the two subspecies.[23][24]


Conservation status

Both subspecies of _Eucalyptus conglobata_ are classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[25][26]
