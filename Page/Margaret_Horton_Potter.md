MargaretHortonPotter2.tif MARGARET HORTON POTTER (May 20, 1881 â€“ December 22, 1911) was an American novelist, specializing in historical fiction.


Early life

Margaret Horton Potter was born in Chicago, Illinois,[1] the daughter of Orrin Woodard Potter (1836-1907), a wealthy steel manufacturer,[2] and Ellen Owen Potter, who was active in women's clubs in Chicago.[3]


Career

Margaret Horton Potter was still a teenager when she published her first novel, which was considered such a scandalous tale, modeled on actual people and events in Chicago society, that her family tried (unsuccessfully) to prevent its publication.[4]

Novels by Margaret Horton Potter include _Uncanonized: A Romance of English Monachism_ (1900); _The House of de Mailly: A Romance_ (1901); _Istar of Babylon: A Phantasy_ (1902); _A Social Lion_ (1903, under pseudonym Robert Dolly Williams); _The Castle of Twilight_ (1903); _The Flame-Gatherers_ (1904); _The Fire of Spring_ (1905); _The Genius_ (1906); _The Princess_ (1907); and _The Golden Ladder_ (1908).[5] Her works were generally historical fiction, with romance plots and exotic settings for American readers,[6][7] though _A Social Lion_ and _The Golden Ladder_ are set in Chicago.[8] There were also fantasy elements in some of Potter's novels, such as supernatural characters (the title character in _Istar of Babylon_ is the goddess Ishtar) and the transmigrated souls in _The Flame-Gatherers_.[9]

In addition to novels, Potter wrote short stories and poems that appeared in _Harper's Magazine_.[10] and co-wrote a play, _The Devil's Choice_ (1909), with Wallace Rice.[11]


Personal life

Margaret Horton Potter married lawyer John Donald Black (son of John C. Black) in 1902.[12] In about 1905, she became addicted to morphine.[13] In May 1910, she was declared mentally incompetent due to chronic alcoholism and morphine addiction,[14] and institutionalized.[15] After her release, her husband divorced her for "habitual drunkenness."[16] She died from a morphine overdose, ruled accidental,[17] in 1911, aged 30 years.[18]
