ROYAL BOTANIC GARDENS, KEW (brand name KEW) is a non-departmental public body in the United Kingdom sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. An internationally important botanical research and education institution, it employs 1,100 staff.[1] Its board of trustees is chaired by Marcus Agius,[2] a former chairman of Barclays.

The organisation manages botanic gardens at Kew in Richmond upon Thames in southwest London, and at Wakehurst, a National Trust property in Sussex which is home to the internationally important Millennium Seed Bank, whose scientists work with partner organisations in more than 95 countries.[3] Kew, jointly with the Forestry Commission, founded Bedgebury National Pinetum in Kent in 1923, specialising in growing conifers.[4] In 1994 the Castle Howard Arboretum Trust, which runs the Yorkshire Arboretum, was formed as a partnership between Kew and the Castle Howard Estate.[5]

In 2018 the organisation had 1,858,513 public visitors at Kew, and 354,957 at Wakehurst.[6] Its site at Kew has 40 historically important buildings; it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 3 July 2003.[7] The collections at Kew and Wakehurst include over 27,000 taxa of living plants[8], 8.3 million plant and fungal herbarium specimens, and over 40,000 species in the seed bank[9].

International Plant Names Index

The Harvard University Herbaria and the Australian National Herbarium co-operate with Kew in the IPNI (International Plant Names Index) database, a project which was launched in 1999 to produce an authoritative source of information on botanical nomenclature including publication details. The IPNI includes information from the _Index Kewensis_, a project which began in the 19th century to provide an "Index to the Names and Authorities of all known flowering plants and their countries".[12]

The Plant List

Kew also cooperates with the Missouri Botanical Garden in a related project called The Plant List; unlike the IPNI, it provides information on which names are currently accepted. The Plant List is an Internet encyclopedia project which was launched in 2010 to compile a comprehensive list of botanical nomenclature.[13] The Plant List has 1,064,035 scientific plant names of species rank of which 350,699 are accepted species names. In addition, the list has 642 plant families and 17,020 plant genera[14].
