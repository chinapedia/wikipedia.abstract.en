SEAN EVANS (born April 26, 1986) is an American webshow producer, interviewer, and host. He is the host of the YouTube series _Hot Ones_, in which he interviews celebrities while they eat progressively spicier chicken wings. Born in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Evans found fame on the internet not only for his proficiency in celebrity interviews, but also for eating incredibly spicy food like the Carolina Reaper pepper, which holds the title for hottest pepper by Guinness World Records. He cites eating spicy food as a child for building up his tolerance.[1][2] Before working as an interviewer Evans was a copywriter for the Chicago tourism board.[3]

Evans started freelancing for Complex Magazine in New Orleans, doing interviews for the publication and putting them on their YouTube channel, interviewing famous celebrities such as 2 Chainz and Steph Curry. The magazine offered him a full-time job in New York City, and he quickly quit his job and started a career at Complex.[4]


_Hot Ones_

_Hot Ones_ is created by Christopher Schonberger and produced by FirstWeFeast.com and Complex Media. Its tagline, stated by Evans at the beginning of each episode, is "The show with hot questions, and even hotter wings." The show was created from a meeting between Sean Evans and FirstWeFeast.com Editor in Chief Christopher Schonberger. Sean cites being influenced by a show Alexa Chung used to do. She would do quirky interviews on English TV.[5]

They have interviewed a number of celebrities, including Shaquille O'Neal, Gabriel Iglesias, Theo Von, Al Roker, Wiz Khalifa, Marques Brownlee, Joel Embiid, Taraji P. Henson, Hannibal Buress, Michael B. Jordan, Ty Burrell, Adam Rippon, Shawn Mendes, Tyra Banks, John Mayer, Charlie Day, Padma Lakshmi, Andy Cohen, Tom Arnold, Thomas Middleditch, Tommy Chong, Michael Rapaport, Jim Gaffigan, Jay Pharoah, Nick Kroll, Bill Burr, Pete Holmes, Blake Griffin, Adam Carolla, Chrissy Teigen, Jeff Goldblum, Issa Rae, Michael Cera, Johnny Knoxville, Artie Lange, Natalie Portman, Bob Saget, Vanessa Hudgens, Henry Rollins, Kevin Hart, DJ Khaled, Seth Rogen, Charlize Theron, Kevin Durant, Ja Rule, Joe Budden, Redman, Ricky Gervais, T.J. Miller, Bobby Lee, Rachael Ray, Dax Shepard, Kyle Kinane, Russell Brand, Bryan Cranston, James Franco, Eddie Huang, Coyote Peterson, Eric Andre, Guy Fieri, Gordon Ramsay, Steve-O, Alton Brown, Tom Segura, Terry Crews, Post Malone, Liam Payne, Chris Jericho, Weird Al Yankovic, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Chili Klaus, Joji, Scarlett Johansson, E-40 and Martin Garrix .[6] The format involves Evans and his guest eating ten chicken wings, each prepared with a progressively hotter hot sauce. The current final sauce, The Last Dab Reduxx, has a Scoville rating of 2,000,000.[7]

Every season they rotate out some of the hot sauces for new ones. In season 4, a new sauce was revealed named The Last Dab. It is a sauce created by Hot Ones themselves and includes the new hottest pepper, Pepper X. The Scoville for the pepper is still being tested but is about to break the record with an average of 3.18 million Scoville units. The sauce is projected to be around 2 million Scoville units.[8] After each wing, Evans asks his guest an interview question. As the wings get hotter, the guest begins to display the effects of eating the spicier wings and the interview becomes less about the guest and more about the struggle to finish the wings. The guests are also provided glasses of water and milk to counteract the effect of the wings.

The standard show is Evans and one guest eating ten wings each, but in some episodes where there are two guests (such as the episode featuring Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele) only five wings are given to each guest. A guest who successfully finishes all ten wings is given the opportunity to promote their upcoming projects; guests who fail are still afforded this opportunity but are added to the show's infamous Hall of Shame. Philip Defranco holds the record for eating two additional wings, beating out Dax Shepard.
