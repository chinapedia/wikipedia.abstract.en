The LEYDEN PLAQUE, sometime called LEIDEN PLATE or LEIDEN PLAQUE, is a jadeite belt plate from the early classic period of the Maya civilization. Although the plate was found on the Caribbean coast of Guatemala, researcher think it was made in Tikal. The plate is now in the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden, Netherlands, hence its official name.[1][2][3] It is one of the oldest Maya objects using the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.[4]


History

The plate was discovered by chance by a Dutch ingenior, S.A. Van Braam, in 1834.[5] He was part of a team employed by a lumber company to dig a canal near Puerto Barrios in Guatemala, in the lower Motagua Valley. The team accidentally knocked down what looked like an ancient mesoamerican funeral mound.[6] There he found many objects in bronze and in jadeite, the little jade plate amongst them.[7][8] The plate was brought back in Netherland in 1864 and was gifted to the National Museum of Ethnology.

The first scientific description of the plate was made by Leeman in 1877, and many others followed, notably Holden in 1880 and Valentine in 1881, who started deciphering the inscriptions.[9] A lot of ground work on the datation of the plate was done in 1938 by Frances and Sylvanus Morley. Their study remains one of the more conclusive made on the plate.[10]

The date on the plate was used to study time and calendar in the Maya world, and the plate remains one of the earlier example of the usage of a calendar in the Mesoamerican world.[11] It is remarkable for being the oldest known usage of a Maya ordinal zero,[12] which symbol (graphically derived from the drawing of a sitting man, typically representing a king's crowning) appears two times, one to form the date "0 Yaxkin" from the first day of the seventh month of the festive year in Haab' calendar, and one to denote the Moon-Bird king accessing its throne on the other side of the plaque.


Description

Leiden_Plate_(Frontal_Design_Linework).svg The plaque is a small rectangular object of pale green jadeite measuring 21.7 by 8.6 centimeters.[13][14] It's faces are carved with both drawings and glyphes. A hole at its top hints that it was used as a pendant, probably as a waist plate. While it was found far from its probable original location of Tikal in a postclassical archeological context,[15] it dates from the ancient classic era. It poses as an example of precious object preserved and used several centuries after its making, which is common in Mesoamerica.

The front face has a picture the a figure of richly dressed man. His head and the lower part of his body are seen from profil, but his breast is turn toward the front, with the feet placed one behind the other.[16] It represents a victorious lord, generally accepted as a ruler of Tikan,[17] wearing six celtsand some trophy heads around his waist, standing with bound captives he vanquished.[18][19] He also carries an _atlatl_, or two head serpent, in his hand.[20][21] The serpents have a human head in their mouth, a characteristic feature of the Sun God.[22][23] The posterior face is engraved with an inscription bearing traces of cinnabar, documenting the crowning of a king the 17 September 320 in Long Count calendar.The other face of the plate bears some glyphes giving one of the earlier registered date of the Maya Classic period.[24] These inscriptions are composed of fifteen glyphes neatly carved in one column.[25] The date written is 320 A.D. and the name of the ruler is also provided as "Moon Zero Bird.[26] It was proposed that the plate represented the ascension of a ruler and that the glyphes gave the name and the date of his ascension.[27] The motif of the ascension of a ruler depicted on the Leiden Plate isn't uncommun at all, and similar carvings were found on stelae and other celts around the Maya world, a subject often used in Old Empire stelea.[28]

For a long time authors considered this king, nicknamed "Moon-Zero-Bird", to be one of the first kings of the Tikal dynasty.[29][30] This interpretation is contested in recent publications: though the plaque is likely to be tied with Tikal, there is no hard evidence of this,[31] and "Moon-Zero-Bird" does not appear in Tikal dynastic listings.[32]


The Leyden plaque today

The Leyden plaque is now displayed in the Mesoamerican gallery of the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden, Netherland. It is the most recognisable object of the museum collection, with replicas gifted to museum, politicians and organisations around the world.[33] Its image is also featured on the one quetzal note, the Guatemalan money, after it was chosen as one of the Guatemalan symbol in 2006.

Controversies remains regarding the return of the original Leiden plate in Guatemalan soil.[34] During a Maya exhibition in the Kimberley Museum in Texas in 1986, the National Museum of Ethnology of Leiden asked for a Declaration of Immunity From Public Seizure in order to protect the plate from being seized by a third party.[35]
