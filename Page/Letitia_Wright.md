LETITIA MICHELLE WRIGHT is a Guyana-born British actress. Beginning her professional career in 2011, she has played roles in several British TV series, including _Top Boy_, _Coming Up_, _Chasing Shadows_, _Humans_, the _Doctor Who_ episode "Face the Raven" and the _Black Mirror_ episode "Black Museum"; for the latter she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie.

The British Academy of Film and Television Arts named Wright among the 2015 group of BAFTA Breakthrough Brits for her role in the award-winning film _Urban Hymn_.[1] In 2018, she achieved global recognition for her portrayal of Shuri in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films _Black Panther_ and _Avengers: Infinity War_, both of which stand among the highest-grossing films of all time. In 2019, she received the BAFTA Rising Star Award.


Early life

Wright was born in Georgetown, Guyana. Her family moved to London when she was seven years old and she attended school there.[2] Having been brought up in Tottenham and attending Duke's Aldridge Academy, she has stated, "I'll always be a north London girl."[3]


Career

Wright performed in school plays as a child, but credits her desire to be a professional actress to the 2006 film _Akeelah and the Bee_. She found Keke Palmer's performance inspiring, remarking that the role "resonated. It's one of the reasons why I'm here".[4] She attended the Identity School of Acting, enrolling at the age of 16.[5][6] She appeared in two episodes of _Holby City_ and _Top Boy_ in 2011.[7] She had a small role in _My Brother the Devil_ in 2012, where she was recognized by Screen International as one of its 2012 Stars of Tomorrow. Michael Caton-Jones cast Wright in her first leading role in _Urban Hymn_ (2015),[8] which brought her to the attention of Hollywood.[9][10] The same year, she appeared in an episode of _Doctor Who_, and the following year, she began a recurring role as Renie on _Humans_.[11] During this time, she also appeared in the play _Eclipsed_ on the West End.[12] In 2017, Wright starred in the _Black Mirror_ episode "Black Museum"; her performance earned her a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie.[13]

Wright co-starred in the 2018 film _Black Panther_, playing the role of Shuri, King T'Challa's sister and princess of Wakanda.[14] Part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the film also starred Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, and Danai Gurira.[15][16] Wright won the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Breakthrough Performance in a Motion Picture for her work in the film,[17] and reprised the role in _Avengers: Infinity War_, which was released later that year.[18] Also in 2018, Wright appeared as Reb in Steven Spielberg's film adaptation of the 2011 science-fiction novel _Ready Player One_.[19] Wright features as one of the cameos in Drake's music video for "Nice for What".[20]

In 2019, Wright won the BAFTA Rising Star Award.[21] In April 2019, Wright appeared alongside Donald Glover and Rihanna in _Guava Island_, a short musical film released by Amazon Studios,[22] before reprising her role as Shuri in _Avengers: Endgame_.

In November 2018 it was announced that Wright would be starring alongside John Boyega in a novel adaption of Hold Back The Stars.[23] Wright will appear in 2020's _Death on the Nile_.[24]


Personal life

Wright has been vocal about her struggles with depression. In 2018, she told _Vanity Fair_ that when she first experienced depression at the age of 20, she "was in the dark going through so many bad things".[25] Wright credits her faith for helping her overcome her depression, which she discovered after attending a London actors' Bible study meeting.[26] To focus on her recovery and her faith, she declined film roles.[27] She later explained she "needed to take a break from acting" and "went on a journey to discover my relationship with God, and I became a Christian."[28]
