Regarded as a four-star recruit by ESPN, Key was ranked as the No. 6 defensive end prospect in the class of 2015.[3]


College career

As a true freshman at LSU in 2015, Key played in 12 games and started the final nine. He recorded 41 tackles and five sacks and was named a freshman All-American.[4][5] As a sophomore in 2016, he set a single-season school record by recording 12 sacks.[6] He earned first-team All-Southeastern Conference honors from the Associated Press.[7] As a junior in 2017, Key was limited to 8 games due to injury, but finished with 33 tackles, 4 sacks, and a forced fumble. On January 4, 2018, Key officially announced that he would be entering the 2018 NFL Draft.[8]


Professional career

40 from pro day

Prior to Key's junior season, he was projected as the number one overall prospect for the 2018 NFL Draft by Chris Trapasso of CBS Sports.[9] In January 2018, he was ranked as the number two draft prospect at the outside linebacker position, behind Tremaine Edmunds of Virginia Tech, by Mel Kiper of ESPN.[10]

Key was projected to be an early first round selection, but his off-the-field issues caused his draft stock to plummet. Key ended up being selected by the Oakland Raiders in the third round as the 87th pick overall.[11]
