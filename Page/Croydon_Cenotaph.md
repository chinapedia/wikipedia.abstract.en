CROYDON CENOTAPH is a war memorial, in Croydon, London, England. It is located outside Croydon Library, on Katharine Street in Croydon.[1][2]

The cenotaph, made from Portland stone, was designed by James Burford ARIBA and was unveiled on 22 October 1921,[3] to commemorate local victims of World War I.

It is framed by two bronze statues of seated figures by Paul Raphael Montford, cast at the M. Maneti foundry.[4] One depicts a wounded soldier from the East Surrey Regiment, the other a widow holding her child.[5][6] The former was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1921.[7]

The cenotaph's inscription reads:[8]

The dates "1939 1945" were added after World War II ended. The AND IN MEMORY ... SINCE lines were added in 1997.[9]

The cenotaph was granted Grade II listed status on 19 November 1973, both in its own right[10][11] and as part of a group of municipal buildings, legally protecting it from unauthorised modification or demolition.[12][13]

A roll of honour is kept in the library.[14]
