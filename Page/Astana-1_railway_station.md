ASTANA-1 RAILWAY STATION is a railway station in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan. The original station can handle 7,000 travellers a day, as part of the infrastructure build up to Expo 2017 a new Astana Nurly Jol railway station is located near Mynzhyldyk Alley with a new capacity of 12,000.[1]


Train Services

Around half of the train services serving Nur-Sultan call at ASTANA-1. Most of these are "through" services as the newer Astana Nurly Jol is a terminal station. Almost all Talgo services that serve Nur-Sultan no longer serve ASTANA-1, but many long distance and commuter services remain at the station. A handful of services call at both ASTANA-1 and Astana Nurly Jol.
