RUDOLPH GEORGE STERN (1936–2006) was an American multimedia artist most widely known for his work in neon. In his later years, he concentrated on making documentary films.[1]


Biography

Stern was born in New Haven, Connecticut. He graduated from Bard College in 1958 with a bachelor's degree in studio arts and from University of Iowa in 1960 with a master's degree.[2][3] He also studied painting with Oskar Kokoschka and Hans Hofmann.[4][5]

He moved to New York City in the mid-1960s where he met the poet and artist Jackie Cassen. They collaborated on multimedia installations of kinetic art, including the "Psychedelic Celebration Number One" for LSD advocate Timothy Leary,[6] and installations at the Electric Circus nightclub.[7]

In 1972, he founded Let There Be Neon,[8] a studio and gallery in New York.[9] He designed and produced neon pieces for the Broadway show, _Kiss of the Spider Woman_,[10] and other art and music performances, as well as commercial signs.[11]

Together with Katharine Kean, he directed the 1992 documentary, _Haití: Killing the Dream_, starring Jean-Bertrand Aristide.[12]

Between 1999 and 2001, his multimedia installation, "Theater of Light", was shown at multiple locations in New York and New Jersey. The installation involved several screens, over 30 projectors and "surrounded audience members with densely layered, constantly changing images, intricately choreographed to music."[13]

Stern died in 2006 at his home in Cadiz, Spain from complications of lung cancer.[14] He was married twice, to Moira North and then to Raffaella Trivi. He had two daughters: Stella (with Trivi) and Lumiere (by an earlier relationship).[15]
