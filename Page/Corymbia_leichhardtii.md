_CORYMBIA LEICHHARDTII_, commonly known as LEICHHARDT'S RUSTYJACKET,[1] RUSTY JACKET or YELLOW JACKET,[2] is a bloodwood native to Queensland[3]

The tree typically grows to a height of and has tessellated, thick, soft bark that is pale brown to yellow-brown or orange bark in colour and persists over the length of the tree. The adult leaves are dull, grey-green, thin, concolorous and lanceolate in shape.[4] The tree blooms between January and March[5] and produces a terminal compound conflorescence with regular seven flowered umbellasters that have terete pedicels and penduncles.[6]

_Corymbia leichhardtii_ has a range stretching from Mareeba in North Queensland south to Salvator Rosa National Park in Central Queensland. It is found in tropical and subtropical sclerophyll woodlands and grows in sandy soils over sandstone.

It was first described by the botanist Frederick Manson Bailey in 1906 in the _Journal of Queensland Agriculture_ as EUCALYPTUS LEICHHARDTII.[7]
