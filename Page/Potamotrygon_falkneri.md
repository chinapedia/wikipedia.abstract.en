_POTAMOTRYGON FALKNERI_, the LARGESPOT RIVER STINGRAY or RETICULATED FRESHWATER STINGRAY, is a species of freshwater stingray in the family Potamotrygonidae from tropical and subtropical South America.[1][2] It is sometimes seen in the aquarium trade, but requires a very large tank.[3]


Taxonomy and appearance

This species was originally described by ichthyologists Castex and Maciel in 1963.[4]

This species is densely spotted above, but the exact color and pattern are very variable. One of these types was initially described as a separate species _P. castexi_ and another as _P. menchacai_. Intermediates between the various patterns are common, and all represent variants of the species _P. falkneri_.[5] It reaches a disc width of up to and a total length, including tail, up to .[6]

The so-called "tiger stingray" has sometimes been misidentified as _P. menchacai_ (a synonym of _P. falkneri_), but it is a separate species that only was scientifically described as _P. tigrina_ in 2011.[7]


Etymology

The etymology of the term _Potamotrygon_ derives from the Greek words potamos, which means 'river', and _trygon_ which means 'sting ray'.[8]


Distribution

This species has a disjunct distribution with the best-known population found throughout much of the Paraná—Paraguay River basin in southern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and northeastern Argentina.[9] Initially it did not occur in the upper Paraná basin above the Guaíra Falls, but these disappeared after the construction of the Itaipu Dam, allowing this species (and several others) to spread.[10]

The other main distribution of _P. falkneri_ is in the upper Amazon Basin: Madre de Díos, Guaporé, Beni, Marañón and Solimões Rivers in Bolivia, eastern Peru and western Brazil.[11]
