The U.S.-JAPAN CAUCUS is a bipartisan Congressional Member Organization within the United States Congress made up of over 100 members of the United States House of Representatives who work to strengthen and maintain U.S.–Japanese Relations.[1]


Mission and purpose

According to the Caucus's website, its goal is to "...facilitate bilateral collaboration on matters of common interest between our two countries, including trade, foreign direct investment, regional stability, military cooperation, energy, technological development, and the environment. The Caucus collaborates with other entities and stakeholders that share this same objective."[2]


History

In January 2014, Congressmen Joaquin Castro (D-TX) and Devin Nunes (R-CA) began inviting members of Congress from both parties to join a Congressional Member Organization based on the improvement of U.S.–Japanese relations. [3]

The formation of the Caucus was officially announced on March 24, 2014, during a live press conference. During the conference, Rep. Castro gave the following statement on behalf of the Caucus:

“I’m thrilled to help establish this bipartisan caucus and further strengthen the relationship between the U.S. and Japan on a range of issues including international economics, national security, and international development. As a Representative of San Antonio, it is especially important to continue to maintain and develop Texas’ strong economic and cultural ties with Japan. Not only is Kumamoto is San Antonio’s sister city, but also Japan is the 4th largest contributor of foreign direct investment in Texas with over 30 business projects in the state. I look forward to working with my Congressional colleagues on both sides of the aisle to facilitate bilateral collaboration on issues of common interest and strategic importance between the two countries.”[4]

In January 2015, after Rep. Devin Nunes became the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he stepped down from his role within the caucus as its Republican Co-Chair. Nunes was replaced by then Rep. Charles Boustany (LA-3). On March 23, 2016, Boustany stepped down as Co-Chair of the Caucus. He was replaced by Rep. David Reichart (WA-8). Reichart, to date, is the current Republican Co-Chair.[5]

Political activity

Since the founding of the Caucus, it and its members have repeatedly voiced their opinions on various issues surrounding Japanese foreign relations, as well as worked to pass legislation that would benefit U.S.–Japanese relations.

Visit to Japan

From August 23 to August 28, 2015, Rep. Joaquin Castro, then Co-Chair of the U.S.-Japan Caucus, visited Japan for five days as an official representative of the United States and the U.S.-Japan Caucus. While there, he met with various officials within the Japanese Government, including, Shinzo Abe (The Prime Minister of Japan), Caroline Kennedy (the then-U.S. Ambassador to Japan), Yoichi Miyazawa (Then Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry), as well as the members of the Japanese-US Parliamentary Friendship League (the Japanese counterpart of the U.S.-Japan Caucus).[11]

Japanese Comfort Women

On January 12, 2016, the U.S.-JAPAN CAUCUS came out in support of a historic agreement between Japan and South Korea surrounding the controversial issue of Japanese Comfort Women. The Caucus released the following statement:

"In reaching this historic agreement, the leaders of Japan and the Republic of Korea have shifted their gazes toward a future built on mutual respect. We are pleased to see two important allies of the United States take such a significant step forward. The resolution of this sensitive issue not only strengthens Japan and the Republic of Korea's bilateral relationship, it also positions the entire Asia-Pacific region for greater prosperity, peace, and stability. We commend Prime Minister Abe and President Park's leadership and resolve in addressing this matter. The progress they achieved will surely serve both nations well as they confront any number of serious challenges that may arise in today's unpredictable world."[12]

November 2017 North Korean Missile Test

On November 28, 2017, North Korea launched a Hwasong-15 ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan, which landed near Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone.[13] In response, the U.S.-Japan Caucus, consisting of members from both political parties, issued the following statement:

“North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the United States and our Japanese and South Korean allies. Applying the necessary diplomatic pressure on North Korea to cease its weapons development will require a fully-staffed and well supported diplomatic corps that is empowered to carry out the tasks required of them, including through the appointment of leaders to be Ambassador to South Korea and other important positions within the State Department that remain vacant ten months into this Presidency.”[14]
