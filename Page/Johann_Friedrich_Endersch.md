Life

Endersch was born in Dörnfeld an der Heide, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Thuringia, but lived most of his life in Elbing (Elbląg), Royal Prussia[1] in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.[2]

In 1755 Endersch completed for Imperial Prince-Bishop Adam Stanisław Grabowski (_Celsissimo ac Reverendissimo S. Rom. Imp. Principi Domino Adam Stanislao in Grabowo Grabowski Episcopo Warmiensi et Sambiesi, Terrarum Prussiae Praesidis ..._) a map of Warmia titled _Tabula Geographica Episcopatum Warmiensem in Prussia Exhibens_. The map, detailing the towns of Warmia (Ermland), was commissioned for the court of Holy Roman Emperor Francis I.

Endersch also made a copper etching that depicted a galiot that had been built in Elbing in 1738 and was named _D' Stadt Elbing_[3][4] (German for "City of Elbląg").
