_HAMMATODERUS EMANON_ is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae. It is known from Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. It was originally described by Dillon and Dillon in 1941 as _Plagiohammus emanon_, but later combined into the genus _Hammatoderus_, thus making the current binomial name _Hammatoderus emanon_.[1]
