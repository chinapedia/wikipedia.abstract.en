In probability theory, two events are INDEPENDENT, STATISTICALLY INDEPENDENT, or STOCHASTICALLY INDEPENDENT[1] if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other (equivalently, does not affect the odds). Similarly, two random variables are independent if the realization of one does not affect the probability distribution of the other.

The concept of independence extends to dealing with collections of more than two events or random variables, in which case the events are pairwise independent if each pair are independent of each other, and the events are MUTUALLY INDEPENDENT if each event is independent of each other combination of events.


Definition

For events

Two events

Two events A and B are INDEPENDENT (often written as A ⊥ B or A⊥​​​ ⊥ B) if and only if their joint probability equals the product of their probabilities:[2][3]

Why this defines independence is made clear by rewriting with conditional probabilities:

$$\mathrm{P}(A \cap B) = \mathrm{P}(A)\mathrm{P}(B) \iff \mathrm{P}(A) = \frac{\mathrm{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathrm{P}(B)} = \mathrm{P}(A\mid B)$$
.

and similarly

_P_(_A_ ∩ _B_) = _P_(_A_)_P_(_B_) ⇔ _P_(_B_) = _P_(_B_ ∣ _A_)
.

Thus, the occurrence of B does not affect the probability of A, and vice versa. Although the derived expressions may seem more intuitive, they are not the preferred definition, as the conditional probabilities may be undefined if P(A) or P(B) are 0. Furthermore, the preferred definition makes clear by symmetry that when A is independent of B, B is also independent of A.

Log probability and information content

Stated in terms of log probability, two events are independent if and only if the log probability of the joint event is the sum of the log probability of the individual events:

log _P_(_A_ ∩ _B_) = log _P_(_A_) + log _P_(_B_)
In information theory, negative log probability is interpreted as information content, and thus two events are independent if and only if the information content of the combined event equals the sum of information content of the individual events:

_I_(_A_ ∩ _B_) = _I_(_A_) + _I_(_B_)
See for details.

Odds

Stated in terms of odds, two events are independent if and only if the odds ratio of and is unity (1). Analogously with probability, this is equivalent to the conditional odds being equal to the unconditional odds:

_O_(_A_ ∣ _B_) = _O_(_A_) and _O_(_B_ ∣ _A_) = _O_(_B_),
or to the odds of one event, given the other event, being the same as the odds of the event, given the other event not occurring:

_O_(_A_ ∣ _B_) = _O_(_A_ ∣ ¬_B_) and _O_(_B_ ∣ _A_) = _O_(_B_ ∣ ¬_A_).
The odds ratio can be defined as

_O_(_A_ ∣ _B_) : _O_(_A_ ∣ ¬_B_),
or symmetrically for odds of given , and thus is 1 if and only if the events are independent.

More than two events

A finite set of events {A_(i)}_(i = 1)^(n) is PAIRWISE INDEPENDENT if every pair of events is independent[4]—that is, if and only if for all distinct pairs of indices m, k,

A finite set of events is MUTUALLY INDEPENDENT if every event is independent of any intersection of the other events[5][6]—that is, if and only if for every k ≤ n and for every k-element subset of events {B_(i)}_(i = 1)^(k) of {A_(i)}_(i = 1)^(n),

This is called the _multiplication rule_ for independent events. Note that it is not a single condition involving only the product of all the probabilities of all single events (see below for a counterexample); it must hold true for all subsets of events.

For more than two events, a mutually independent set of events is (by definition) pairwise independent; but the converse is not necessarily true (see below for a counterexample).[7]

For real valued random variables

Two random variables

Two random variables X and Y are INDEPENDENT if and only if (iff) the elements of the π-system generated by them are independent; that is to say, for every x and y, the events {X ≤ x} and {Y ≤ y} are independent events (as defined above in ). That is, X and Y with cumulative distribution functions F_(X)(x) and F_(Y)(y), are independent iff the combined random variable (X, Y) has a joint cumulative distribution function[8]

or equivalently, if the probability densities f_(X)(x) and f_(Y)(y) and the joint probability density f_(X, Y)(x, y) exist,

_f__(_X_, _Y_)(_x_, _y_) = _f__(_X_)(_x_)_f__(_Y_)(_y_) for all _x_, _y_
.

More than two random variables

A finite set of n random variables {X₁, …, X_(n)} is PAIRWISE INDEPENDENT if and only if every pair of random variables is independent. Even if the set of random variables is pairwise independent, it is not necessarily mutually independent as defined next.

A finite set of n random variables {X₁, …, X_(n)} is MUTUALLY INDEPENDENT if and only if for any sequence of numbers {x₁, …, x_(n)}, the events {X₁ ≤ x₁}, …, {X_(n) ≤ x_(n)} are mutually independent events (as defined above in ). This is equivalent to the following condition on the joint cumulative distribution function F_(X₁, …, X_(n))(x₁, …, x_(n)). A finite set of n random variables {X₁, …, X_(n)} is MUTUALLY INDEPENDENT if and only if[9]

Notice that is not necessary here to require that the probability distribution factorizes for all possible k−element subsets as in the case for n events. This is not required because e.g. F_(X₁, X₂, X₃)(x₁, x₂, x₃) = F_(X₁)(x₁) ⋅ F_(X₂)(x₂) ⋅ F_(X₃)(x₃) implies F_(X₁, X₃)(x₁, x₃) = F_(X₁)(x₁) ⋅ F_(X₃)(x₃).

The measure-theoretically inclined may prefer to substitute events {X ∈ A} for events {X ≤ x} in the above definition, where A is any Borel set. That definition is exactly equivalent to the one above when the values of the random variables are real numbers. It has the advantage of working also for complex-valued random variables or for random variables taking values in any measurable space (which includes topological spaces endowed by appropriate σ-algebras).

For real valued random vectors

Two random vectors X = (X₁, ..., X_(m))^(T) and Y = (Y₁, ..., Y_(n))^(T) are called INDEPENDENT if[10]

(\mathbf{x}) \cdot F_{\mathbf{Y}}(\mathbf{y}) \quad \text{for all } \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}|}} |cellpadding= 6 |border |border colour = #0073CF |background colour=#F5FFFA}}

where F_(X)(X) and F_(Y)(Y) denote the cumulative distribution functions of X and Y and F_(X, Y)(X, Y) denotes their joint cumulative distribution function. Independence of X and Y is often denoted by X⊥​​​ ⊥ Y. Written component-wise, X and Y are called independent if

_F__(_X_₁, …, _X__(_m_), _Y_₁, …, _Y__(_n_))(_x_₁, …, _x__(_m_), _y_₁, …, _y__(_n_)) = _F__(_X_₁, …, _X__(_m_))(_x_₁, …, _x__(_m_)) ⋅ _F__(_Y_₁, …, _Y__(_n_))(_y_₁, …, _y__(_n_)) for all _x_₁, …, _x__(_m_), _y_₁, …, _y__(_n_)
.

For stochastic processes

For one stochastic process

The definition of independence may be extended from random vectors to a stochastic process. Thereby it is required for an independent stochastic process that the random variables obtained by sampling the process at any n times t₁, …, t_(n) are independent random variables for any n.[11]

Formally, a stochastic process {X_(t)}_(t ∈ 𝒯) is called independent, if and only if for all n ∈ ℕ and for all t₁, …, t_(n) ∈ 𝒯

(x_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot F_{X_{t_n}}(x_n) \quad \text{for all } x_1,\ldots,x_n|}} |cellpadding= 6 |border |border colour = #0073CF |background colour=#F5FFFA}}

where F_(X_(t₁), …, X_(t_(n)))(x₁, …, x_(n)) = P(X(t₁) ≤ x₁, …, X(t_(n)) ≤ x_(n)). Notice that independence of a stochastic process is a property _within_ a stochastic process, not between two stochastic processes.

For two stochastic processes

Independence of two stochastic processes is a property between two stochastic processes {X_(t)}_(t ∈ 𝒯) and {Y_(t)}_(t ∈ 𝒯) that are defined on the same probability space (Ω, ℱ, P). Formally, two stochastic processes {X_(t)}_(t ∈ 𝒯) and {Y_(t)}_(t ∈ 𝒯) are said to be independent if for all n ∈ ℕ and for all t₁, …, t_(n) ∈ 𝒯, the random vectors (X(t₁), …, X(t_(n))) and (Y(t₁), …, Y(t_(n))) are independent,[12] i.e. if

(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \cdot F_{Y_{t_1},\ldots,Y_{t_n}}(y_1,\ldots,y_n) \quad \text{for all } x_1,\ldots,x_n|}} |cellpadding= 6 |border |border colour = #0073CF |background colour=#F5FFFA}}

Independent σ-algebras

The definitions above ( and ) are both generalized by the following definition of independence for σ-algebras. Let (Ω, Σ, P) be a probability space and let 𝒜 and ℬ be two sub-σ-algebras of Σ. 𝒜 and ℬ are said to be INDEPENDENT if, whenever A ∈ 𝒜 and B ∈ ℬ,

_P_(_A_ ∩ _B_) = _P_(_A_)_P_(_B_).

Likewise, a finite family of σ-algebras (τ_(i))_(i ∈ I), where I is an index set, is said to be independent if and only if

∀(_A__(_i_))_(_i_ ∈ _I_) ∈ ∏_(_i_ ∈ _I_)_τ__(_i_) : _P_(⋂_(_i_ ∈ _I_)_A__(_i_)) = ∏_(_i_ ∈ _I_)_P_(_A__(_i_))

and an infinite family of σ-algebras is said to be independent if all its finite subfamilies are independent.

The new definition relates to the previous ones very directly:

-   Two events are independent (in the old sense) if and only if the σ-algebras that they generate are independent (in the new sense). The σ-algebra generated by an event E ∈ Σ is, by definition,

_σ_({_E_}) = {∅, _E_, _Ω_ \ _E_, _Ω_}.

-   Two random variables X and Y defined over Ω are independent (in the old sense) if and only if the σ-algebras that they generate are independent (in the new sense). The σ-algebra generated by a random variable X taking values in some measurable space S consists, by definition, of all subsets of Ω of the form X^( − 1)(U), where U is any measurable subset of S.

Using this definition, it is easy to show that if X and Y are random variables and Y is constant, then X and Y are independent, since the σ-algebra generated by a constant random variable is the trivial σ-algebra {⌀, Ω}. Probability zero events cannot affect independence so independence also holds if Y is only Pr-almost surely constant.


Properties

Self-independence

Note that an event is independent of itself if and only if

_P_(_A_) = _P_(_A_ ∩ _A_) = _P_(_A_) ⋅ _P_(_A_) ⇔ _P_(_A_) = 0 or _P_(_A_) = 1
.

Thus an event is independent of itself if and only if it almost surely occurs or its complement almost surely occurs; this fact is useful when proving zero–one laws.[13]

Expectation and covariance

If X and Y are independent random variables, then the expectation operator E  has the property

E [_X__Y_] = E [_X_]E [_Y_],

and the covariance cov [X, Y] is zero, since we have

cov [_X_, _Y_] = E [_X__Y_] − E [_X_]E [_Y_]
.

(The converse of these, i.e. the proposition that if two random variables have a covariance of 0 they must be independent, is not true. See uncorrelated.)

Similarly for two stochastic processes {X_(t)}_(t ∈ 𝒯) and {Y_(t)}_(t ∈ 𝒯): If they are independent, then they are uncorrelated.[14]

Characteristic function

Two random variables X and Y are independent if and only if the characteristic function of the random vector (X, Y) satisfies

_φ__((_X_, _Y_))(_t_, _s_) = _φ__(_X_)(_t_) ⋅ _φ__(_Y_)(_s_)
.

In particular the characteristic function of their sum is the product of their marginal characteristic functions:

_φ__(_X_ + _Y_)(_t_) = _φ__(_X_)(_t_) ⋅ _φ__(_Y_)(_t_),

though the reverse implication is not true. Random variables that satisfy the latter condition are called subindependent.


Examples

Rolling dice

The event of getting a 6 the first time a die is rolled and the event of getting a 6 the second time are _independent_. By contrast, the event of getting a 6 the first time a die is rolled and the event that the sum of the numbers seen on the first and second trial is 8 are _not_ independent.

Drawing cards

If two cards are drawn _with_ replacement from a deck of cards, the event of drawing a red card on the first trial and that of drawing a red card on the second trial are _independent_. By contrast, if two cards are drawn _without_ replacement from a deck of cards, the event of drawing a red card on the first trial and that of drawing a red card on the second trial are _not_ independent, because a deck that has had a red card removed has proportionately fewer red cards.

Pairwise and mutual independence

Pairwise_independent.svg Mutually_independent.svg

Consider the two probability spaces shown. In both cases, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 and P(C) = 1/4. The random variables in the first space are pairwise independent because P(A|B) = P(A|C) = 1/2 = P(A), P(B|A) = P(B|C) = 1/2 = P(B), and P(C|A) = P(C|B) = 1/4 = P(C); but the three random variables are not mutually independent. The random variables in the second space are both pairwise independent and mutually independent. To illustrate the difference, consider conditioning on two events. In the pairwise independent case, although any one event is independent of each of the other two individually, it is not independent of the intersection of the other two:

$$\mathrm{P}(A|BC) = \frac{\frac{4}{40}}{\frac{4}{40} + \frac{1}{40}} = \tfrac{4}{5} \ne \mathrm{P}(A)$$

$$\mathrm{P}(B|AC) = \frac{\frac{4}{40}}{\frac{4}{40} + \frac{1}{40}} = \tfrac{4}{5} \ne \mathrm{P}(B)$$

$$\mathrm{P}(C|AB) = \frac{\frac{4}{40}}{\frac{4}{40} + \frac{6}{40}} = \tfrac{2}{5} \ne \mathrm{P}(C)$$

In the mutually independent case, however,

$$\mathrm{P}(A|BC) = \frac{\frac{1}{16}}{\frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{16}} = \tfrac{1}{2} = \mathrm{P}(A)$$

$$\mathrm{P}(B|AC) = \frac{\frac{1}{16}}{\frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{16}} = \tfrac{1}{2} = \mathrm{P}(B)$$

$$\mathrm{P}(C|AB) = \frac{\frac{1}{16}}{\frac{1}{16} + \frac{3}{16}} = \tfrac{1}{4} = \mathrm{P}(C)$$

Mutual independence

It is possible to create a three-event example in which

_P_(_A_ ∩ _B_ ∩ _C_) = _P_(_A_)_P_(_B_)_P_(_C_),

and yet no two of the three events are pairwise independent (and hence the set of events are not mutually independent).[15] This example shows that mutual independence involves requirements on the products of probabilities of all combinations of events, not just the single events as in this example. For another example, take A to be empty and B and C to be identical events with non-zero probability. Then, since B and C are the same event, they are not independent, but the probability of the intersection of the events is zero, the product of the probabilities.


Conditional independence

For events

The events A and B are conditionally independent given an event C when

P(A ∩ B ∣ C) = P(A ∣ C) ⋅ P(B ∣ C).

For random variables

Intuitively, two random variables X and Y are conditionally independent given Z if, once Z is known, the value of Y does not add any additional information about X. For instance, two measurements X and Y of the same underlying quantity Z are not independent, but they are CONDITIONALLY INDEPENDENT GIVEN Z (unless the errors in the two measurements are somehow connected).

The formal definition of conditional independence is based on the idea of conditional distributions. If X, Y, and Z are discrete random variables, then we define X and Y to be _conditionally independent given_ Z if

_P_(_X_ ≤ _x_, _Y_ ≤ _y_ | _Z_ = _z_) = _P_(_X_ ≤ _x_ | _Z_ = _z_) ⋅ _P_(_Y_ ≤ _y_ | _Z_ = _z_)

for all x, y and z such that P(Z = z) > 0. On the other hand, if the random variables are continuous and have a joint probability density function f_(XYZ)(x, y, z), then X and Y are conditionally independent given Z if

_f__(_X__Y_|_Z_)(_x_, _y_|_z_) = _f__(_X_|_Z_)(_x_|_z_) ⋅ _f__(_Y_|_Z_)(_y_|_z_)

for all real numbers x, y and z such that f_(Z)(z) > 0.

If discrete X and Y are conditionally independent given Z, then

_P_(_X_ = _x_|_Y_ = _y_, _Z_ = _z_) = _P_(_X_ = _x_|_Z_ = _z_)

for any x, y and z with P(Z = z) > 0. That is, the conditional distribution for X given Y and Z is the same as that given Z alone. A similar equation holds for the conditional probability density functions in the continuous case.

Independence can be seen as a special kind of conditional independence, since probability can be seen as a kind of conditional probability given no events.
