DEVON TERRELL CURRIE (born 23 October 1992) is an American-Australian actor best known for playing a young Barack Obama in the 2016 biographical film _Barry_.[1]


Early life and education

Terrell was born in Long Beach, California to an African-American father and Anglo-Indian mother (_n√©e_ Saxby). At age 5, he moved to Perth, Western Australia, growing up in Forest Lakes. He attended Edith Cowan University, specialising in drama education. He graduated from the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 2013.[2][3][4]


Career

Terrell's first role was in the Steve McQueen series for HBO, _Codes of Conduct_, which was canceled after the pilot was filmed. Terrell then sought an audition for _Barry_, feeling an affinity for Obama as both are of mixed race. He said that, when once asked at age 19 what his "dream role" was, it was to portray Obama.[5][6]

To prepare for the role, he worked with a dialect coach and watched Obama's speeches to master his accent and manner of speaking, and was offered the part after one audition. He also trained himself to portray the left-handed Obama, including learning how to write and play basketball with his left hand.[7][8] He read Obama's book _Dreams from My Father_ three times to get into his mindset, and he received praise for his portrayal when the film was released.[9][10][11][12]
