BADU PEOPLE are an indigenous Australian Torres Strait Island people based on the central-west Badu island.


Language

The language traditionally spoken by the Badu people and their Mabuiag neighbours is Kala Lagaw Ya, a member of the Pama-Nyungan language family.


Ecology

Badu, together with Moa Island to its West from which it is separated by a narrow channel, is one of the largest in the Torres Strait. Circular in form, roughly 6 kilometres in diameter it is surrounded by complex tides that can run up to 7 knots. Generally sparsely wooded, and rocky, the northern part of the island is fringed with dense mangroves.


Headhunting

Badu Island in particular, with the publication of Ion Idriess's novel _The Wild White Man of Badu_ (1950), gained a reputation as an island of headhunters, though the practice was widespread throughout the Torres Strait. Taking the head of one's enemy was a ritual practice, involving a cane hoop and a special bamboo knife (_upi_) for severing the head, then boiling it and dressing it with beeswax noses and eyes fashioned from nautilus nacre.


History

Willem Janszoon in the _Duyfken_ as early as 1605 sailed close to the island of Badu while en route back to the East Indies after a reconnaissance of New Guinea for the Dutch East India Company. The impression left of the region was of a waste land populated by cruel savages. The island itself, together with Mabuiagm was later charted by William Bligh.

Badu islanders murdered three Europeans from the _Thomas Lord_ which had anchored off the island while searching for trepang in June 1846.
