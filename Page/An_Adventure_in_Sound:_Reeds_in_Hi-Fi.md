_AN ADVENTURE IN SOUND: REEDS IN HI-FI_ (also released as _AN ADVENTURE IN SOUND - REEDS_) is an album by composer, arranger and conductor Pete Rugolo featuring performances recorded in 1956 and first released on the Mercury label in 1958.[1][2][3][4]


Reception

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow noted: "Unfortunately, the novelty effects tend to overshadow the creative elements, and despite the complexity of some of the writing, the overall feel is quite lightweight. A bit of a disappointment considering the potential."[5]
