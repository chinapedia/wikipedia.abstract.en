Biography

Daish was born in Wellington, New Zealand and grew up in the suburb of Roseneath. While young, her family moved to New York for two years as her father had a job at the United Nations.[2] This early exposure to American food influenced her interest and taste in food in later years.[3]

In the 1960s, Daish cooked at the Downstage Theatre, and later worked at a bohemian cafe, The Settlement.[4]

In the 1970s, Daish wrote articles for a friend's newspaper in the western suburbs of Wellington; most were on town planning issues, but Daish convinced her friend to include a food column and she wrote food articles for the newspaper as well.[5]

In the 1980s, Daish owned several Wellington restaurants: Number 9 on Bowen St for four years, followed by the Mount Cook Café from 1984 to 1989, and then the Brooklyn Café & Grill.[6][7] In 1984 she began writing a food column for the _New Zealand Listener_ magazine. For the first ten years she wrote alternate weeks with Annabel Langbein, and from 1994 she wrote the column every week.[8] She retired from the _Listener_ in 2009.[9][10] In 1987, she was a founding member of the New Zealand Guild of Food Writers.[11]
