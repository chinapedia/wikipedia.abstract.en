Biography

Mikhail Kotlyarov was born in 1963 in the city Azov, Rostov region. From his childhood he was passionate about music, practiced vocal. Studying in a secondary school, Michael has already soloed in the choir of the local pedagogical college. At the same time he was enrolled at the School of Music at the percussion department. Having shown his capabilities and diversified talent he became a musician in a symphonic orchestra. Being a member of this orchestra he participated in various city events. But singing was not his only passion. Inspired by a contemporary icon – the legendary hockey player Kharlamov – Mikhail spent all the time he could spare from music playing sports. Hockey became such an addiction for him that it became his childhood dream, making him wish to be a winner.

«Novoye vremia» is a rock band created by Mikhail in the mid-70s. A fifteen year old teenager was overwhelmed by the creativity of western starts: the legendary Deep Purpose, Whitesnake, Black Sabbath. This could not avoid influencing the choice of music genre for his amateur band. The boys played hard rock and sothereafter in 1978 they received their first acknowledgement – they won the 6th All-Union musical artists competition in Leningrad. A bit later Mikhail was offered to join a famous folk band – ViA «Rovesknik». With this band he took part in the opening of the sailing race of the Moscow Olympic games of 1980. It took place in Tallinn, Estonia.

In the same year the musician applied to the best universities in Moscow. The artistic challenges in GITIS, VGIK and the theatrical institute in the name of Boris Shukin were all successfully overcome. However he chose GITIS.

In 1985 Mikhail received an award during the XII World festival of youth and students, where tens of thousands of people from 157 countries participated. In 1987 he was awarded during the TV competition «When soldiers sing».

The Military service of Mikhail Kotlyarov was twice: in the Krasnoznamyonnii singing and dancing ensemble of the Soviet Army lead by S. A. Alexandrov and in the song and dance ensemble of the air defense forces. After he finished service, Mikhail worked in a children’s musical theater under the leadership of Natalia Ilyinichna Satz – a famous soviet director of opera and theater plays. During this time Mikhail met his future wife – a Frenchwoman with a Russian name Natalia. Soon she introduced her young husband to the famous French fashion designer Pierre Cardin. This predetermined many events to come in the future life of the musician.

In 1990s the married couple moved to France. Mikhail became a postgraduate of the Paris Conservatory. During this time the glamorous opera diva – Galina Pavlovna Vishnevskaya – was his mentor and teacher.

Pierre Cardin was touched by the artwork of Mikhail and did a lot to ensure that as many fans of opera music as possible got to know this Russian talent. A charity concert initiated by a member of the Romanov tsar dynasty – Prince V.K. Romanov - became an excellent occasion. The upper class society of opera singing admirers was invited in the family mansion of the Conde princes, in the Chantilly residence. This was the first sortie of the magnificent tenor from Russia.

In 1991 the musician was invited together with the Royal London Orchestra to record the Symphony No. 2 of Dmitrii Shostakovich. Later Pierre Cardin organized the meeting with his renowned colleague Yves Saint Laurent and the director of the Paris Opera house («Opera de Bastille») Pierre Berger. They offered Mikhail to sing the role of Herman in Petr Tchaikovsky’s opera «Pikovaya Dama». Then the 29-year-old Russian talent took one of the main international stages.

Invitations followed one after the other. The big theatrical stage of Geneva, «Capitol» of Warsaw, the Parisian «Opera de Bastille» and one of the best concert scenes «The Champs Elysees», the Vienna state Opera, «La Scala» in Milan, the Moscow Conservatorium named after Tchaikovsky and the Moscow Academic Philharmonic Society, concert stages of the Cannes and Vienna film festivals. Even today Mikhail Yurievich is a welcome guest of multiple opera festivals and concerts, which take place on the stages in many countries of the World.

In 2005 with the academic Russian chorus in the name of A.V. Sveshnikov and the Big Symphonic orchestra Mikhail Kotlyarov recorded famous arias of J. Rossini. After that he went on an opera tour in Kazakhstan, organized by the head of state – Nursultan Nazarbaev. And straight after that he made an unforgettable performance in the Italian city of Florence.

In 2008 the organizers of the all-Russian national award «Olymp» were honored to invite Mikhail to perform during the opening ceremony. That same year his first musical solo album «Destiny» («Sudba») was highly demanded by opera singing admirers.

The next important step in the work of the musician was a joint project with the American musician and producer Walter Afanasieff. In the list of his «Star» clients were such names as Whitney Huston, Celine Dion, Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey and many other popular musicians. After several months of collaboration Kotlyarov and Afanasieff released one more record «IN ONE BREATH» («V odno dikhanie»). It was a fantastic success. Randy Jackson, an American bass player, vocalist, art manager and the creator of the top-rated show «American Idol», Emmy Award winner, helped with the promotion and sales of the album.

Two years ago, in October 2015, another album of the Russian musician was released. The album was called «Mikhail Kotlaroff – Unity of Variety. The compositions were presented in an unusual style «Classical crossover», which is an organic mix of different styles of music and opera singing.
