Exhibited items

The first hall is reserved for the Kültepe ruins. The origin of the clay tablets are either Assyrian trade post (karum) or the Hittite city Kültepe (Nesa). These are the earliest written materials in Turkey (ca 1900 B.C.), pitchers, vases, stamps, bowls, metallic objects and various reliefs. In the corridor between the two halls the Phrygian ceramics are displayed. The second hall is the hall of the later civilizations such as Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine eras. These are ornaments, figurines, marble sculptures, etc. One of the most important items is the Heracles sarcophagus which was recently found during the construction of a nearby building.[4] There are also some items in the yard.
