INGRID ST-PIERRE (born in 1985) is a French Canadian singer-songwriter from Quebec.


Biography

Ingrid St-Pierre was born and raised in Cabano, a town within the Bas-Saint-Laurent region of Quebec, Canada.[1] Her father is a businessman while her mother is a painter and an artist. Since a young age, Ingrid took piano and Gregorian classical singing classes. At age 17, she left her hometown to go study in Quebec City. She later on settled in Trois-Rivières where she decided to study psychology. Ultimately, she left university to pursue a musical career.


Musical career

She joined independent Canadian record label "La Tribu" in 2011 and still works with them to this day[2]

She released her first album _Petite mam’zelle de chemin_ on May 24, 2011. The album sold relatively well in Quebec and it even got St-Pierre her first nomination for the Breakthrough Award at the ADISQ, the main awards for music in Quebec. Ingrid was called _Francophone discovery_ by the Public Francophone Radio Association.[3] On January 20, 2012, Ingrid released a music video for her song "Ficelles" on YouTube, a video on her Grandmother and her struggle with Alzheimer's[4] which now has more than a million views.[5] In 2012, she released her second album _L’Escapade_, receiving three ADISQ nominations: album of the year, singer-songwriter of the year and the Contemporary adult award, an award she lost to Celine Dion. After a three-year hiatus due to personal reasons, during which St-Pierre suffered a miscarriage in 2014, she released her third album _Tokyo_ in November 2015. Ingrid with her partner and drummer, Liu Kong-Ha, had a baby boy on September 9, 2015 who they decided to name Polo.[6] Her son was conceived in Tokyo hence the name she gave to her new album. Later that year, she was nominated once again for the ADISQ Gala and finally won her first Felix for artist of the year.[7] Following her vocality on the subject, The Federation of Quebec Alzheimer's society named Ingrid St-Pierre their Spokesperson for the Alzheimer's movement.[8][9]

Ingrid is presently on tour for her third album _Tokyo_ since January 2016. She also joined the Canadian celebrity dancing show _Les Dieux de la danse_[10] with her long-time friend, singer and television host Joël Legendre.
