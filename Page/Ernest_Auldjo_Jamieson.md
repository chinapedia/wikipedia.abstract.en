ERNEST ARTHUR OLIPHANT AULDJO JAMIESON FRIBA MID (1880–1937) was a Scottish architect operating in the early 20th century. He specialised in country houses, largely for wealthy family friends. From after the First World War he also got many commissions from local authorities for social housing, plus several commissions related to hospitals and asylums.


Life

Church_of_Scotland_Offices,_Edinburgh.JPG He was born on 3 December 1880 at 58 Melville Street[1] in Edinburgh’s west end, the fifth son (out of eight children) to George Auldjo Jamieson, a wealthy accountant, and his wife, Susan Oliphant.

He was sent to boarding school at Glenalmond College then won a place at Cambridge University. He graduated BA in 1903. From 1905 he lived with his young family at 32 Murrayfield Road. In 1906 he became an architectural assistant in the office of Sydney Mitchell at 13 Young Street.[2] When Mitchell retired in 1909 Jamieson bought the practice and moved it to 1 Melville Street.[3] In 1912 his family moved to 14 Royal Circus in the New Town.

In the First World War he joined the Royal Naval Air Service as a lieutenant. He was promoted rapidly, becoming a flight commander in 1917. He ended the war as a lieutenant colonel in the Army Flying Corps. He was twice Mentioned in Dispatches.

After the war he went into partnership with James Alexander Arnott to form Auldjo Jamieson & Arnott.

He retired due to ill-health in 1935 and died at Grey House in Murrayfield on 10 April 1937 aged only 56. He is buried in the 20th century northern extension to Dean Cemetery. The grave lies on the north wall near the north-west corner.
