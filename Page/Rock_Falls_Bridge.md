The ROCK FALLS BRIDGE is a historic structure located in Rock Falls, in the north-central part of the U.S. state of Iowa. The span carries Spring Street over the Shell Rock River for . The Iowa State Highway Commission prepared the plans for this bridge in September 1928, and they were revised in February 1929. While they designed riveted steel trusses for medium-span bridges in rural areas, they used concrete open spandrel arches like this one for several urban and small town structures in the 1920s.[1] C.A. Holvik of Mason City was awarded the contract to construct the bridge, which they completed later in 1929. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.[2]
