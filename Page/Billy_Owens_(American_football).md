Early years

He accepted a football scholarship from the University of Pittsburgh, where he was switched between running back to safety as a freshman, but still managed to average 8.3 yards per carry (14 carries for 116 yards and one touchdown). In 1984, he was redshirted after being lost for the season with a knee injury.

As a sophomore, he became the starter at free safety toward the end of the season, although he was used as a backup running back in some games.[2] He was a part of a secondary that was called "The Burnt Toast Patrol", after giving up a school record 2,283 passing yards.[3]

As a junior, he was moved to strong safety and was fourth on the team with 106 tackles. He also tied with Quintin Jones for the club lead with 4 interceptions. He had a career-high 16 tackles against North Carolina State University.

As a senior, he tallied 88 tackles (fifth on the team), 2 sacks, 2 fumble recoveries and one interception. He also averaged 22.4 yards as a part-time kick off returner. Against West Virginia University, he tallied 9 tackles, one sack and 2 forced fumbles, including the one that set up the winning field goal in Pittsburgh's 6-3 win. He made a season-high 10 tackles in the upset 30â€“22 win against the University of Notre Dame. He had a memorable play against Penn State University, when he returned an interception 69 yards to seal a 10-0 victory with 42 seconds remaining in the game. It was Pitt's first shutout over Penn State since 1955 (a 20-0 victory).[4][5]
