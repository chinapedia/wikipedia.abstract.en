GIOVANNI ANTONIO FALDONI (24th April, 1689 â€“ c. 1770) was an Italian painter and engraver, citizen of the Republic of Venice.

He was born in Asolo, province of Treviso, and was active in Venice. He trained under a landscape painter named Antonio Luciani, and learned engraving with a burin from Egidio Sadeler, then Claude Mellan. He created a series of portraits of the Doges of Venice and procurators of St Mark and Knights of the Star of Gold.[1] He engraved a series of paintings, portraits, and busts of Roman Emperors for Anton Maria Zanetti the Elder.[2]

Exiled from Venice in 1765, he moved to Rome, where his traces are lost.
