CENESTHOPATHY (from [1], formed from the Ancient Greek κοινός () „common“, αἴσθησῐς () „feeling“, „perception“ + πᾰ́θος () „feeling, suffering, condition“), also known as COENESTHESIOPATHY[2], is a rare psychiatric term used to refer to the feeling of being ill and this feeling is not localized to one region of the body.[3] Most notably, cenesthopathies are characterized by aberrant and strange bodily sensations (for example, a feeling of wires or coils being present within the oral region; tightening, burning, pressure, tickling etc. occurring in various parts of the body, and so on).[4]


History

Cenesthopathy (originally ) is a term created in 1907 by the French neuro-psychiatrists Ernest Ferdinand Pierre Louis Dupré and Paul Camus.[5][6][7]

Cenesthopathic schizophrenia

The established occurrence of coenesthetic hallucinations in 18 % of individuals with a psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia has led to the formulation of a separate subgroup of schizophrenia in the ICD-10, called cenesthopathic schizophrenia.[11] _Cenesthopathic schizophrenia_ is included (but not defined) within the category "other schizophrenia" () in the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems.[12][13]
