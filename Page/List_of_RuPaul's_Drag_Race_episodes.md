_RuPaul's Drag Race_ is an American reality competition television series produced by World of Wonder for Logo TV. The show documents RuPaul in his search for "America's next drag superstar."[1] Queen RuPaul plays the roles of host, mentor, and source of inspiration for this series, as contestants are given different challenges each week. _RuPaul's Drag Race_ employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, Michelle Visage and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. The title of the show is a play on drag queen and drag racing, and the title sequence and song "Drag Race" both have a drag-racing theme.

_RuPaul's Drag Race_ has spanned ten seasons and inspired the spin-off shows _RuPaul's Drag U_ and _RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars_. The show has become the highest-rated television program on Logo TV,[2] and airs internationally, including in Australia, Canada and the UK. The show earned Rupaul a 2016 Emmy for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program, and the show itself was awarded as an Outstanding Reality Program at the 21st GLAAD Media Awards. It has been nominated for 4 Critics' Choice Television Award including Best Reality Series â€“ Competition and Best Reality Show Host for RuPaul, and was nominated for a Creative Arts Emmy Award for Outstanding Make-up for a Multi-Camera Series or Special (Non-Prosthetic).
