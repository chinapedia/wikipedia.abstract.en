SELO in Java, Indonesia is a village on the saddle of ground between the two volcanoes n Central Java, Mount Merbabu and Mount Merapi. It is regularly identified as _Selo, Boyolali_ due to its district name and immediate administrative centre having that name[1]

It is situated on the northern lower slopes of Merapi, southern slope of Merbabu [2] When Merapi is inactive between eruptions, Selo is often utilised for walkers to go up to the volcano crater as an alternative to the older and more difficult climbing routes from Kaliurang on the southern slopes.[3][4][5]
