AYAM KECAP[1] or AYAM MASAK KICAP is a Maritime Southeast Asia chicken dish poached or simmered in sweet soy sauce (_kecap manis_ or _kicap lemak manis_) commonly found in Indonesia[2] and Malaysia.[3]


Indonesia

Ayam_Kecap_Panggang.jpg In Indonesia, _ayam kecap_ is pieces of chicken simmered in _kecap manis_ (sweet soy sauce), spiced with shallot or onion, garlic, ginger, pepper, leek and tomato.[4] Other version might add richer spices, including nutmeg and cloves.[5] In Indonesia, the term _ayam kecap_ is often interchangeable with _ayam goreng kecap_ (a variant of _ayam goreng_ in sweet soy sauce) and _semur ayam_, Indonesian sweet soy stew which uses chicken instead of beef. Since all of them are actually similar â€” if not almost identical, recipes of chicken cooked in sweet soy sauce. However, _semur ayam_ often add richer spices, which includes clove, cinnamon and star anise. On the other hand, _ayam goreng kecap_ has thicker sweet soy sauce and often added with slices of fresh lime or splash of lime juices. The main difference probably is its water content, despite quite moist, both _ayam kecap_ and _ayam goreng kecap_ are usually dryer and has thicker soy sauce compared to _semur ayam_ which is more watery.

In Indonesian, fried chicken in sweet soy sauce is a typical chicken dish commonly served across Indonesia. However, it is more precisely of Javanese-Chinese origin. The recipe follows the production of Indonesian _kecap manis_ (sweet soy sauce). Historically, soy sauce production is linked to Chinese influence in the archipelago. However, Indonesian Javanese version of soy sauce has its own twist, which is a generous addition of thick liquid palm sugar (_gula jawa_) with consistency of molasses.[6] The _ayam kecap pedas_ is a hot and spicier version which add generous amount of chili pepper.[7]

In Indonesia, ayam kecap commonly is poached chicken cut in pieces, which includes its bones. However, there is a variant called ayam panggang kecap which uses identical sweet soy sauce and spices, but the chicken is boneless fillet and being grilled instead of being fried.[8]


Malaysia

Ayam_masak_kicap.jpg The Malay _ayam masak kicap_ is different from the Chinese version of soy sauce chicken as the chicken meat is cut into pieces and mixed with its own spices.[9]
