INTERNATIONAL OPEN FILM FESTIVAL (IOFF) is an independent film festival based in the United States and owned by an organization in the United States that attracts filmmakers from all over the world. The International Film Festival offers aspiring filmmakers with both a live and a secured non-public online platform where they feature and screen their films for festival-goers and online audiences respectively.


Background

IOFF was established with the aim to promote local and international talent. The film festival holds an annual contest where they accept films from several different categories such as educational film, feature film, film on women, Bengali films, and more. In total, the film festival has listed 32 film categories[1] and has received more than 4,000 submissions from 105 countries.

They have executed certain safety measures to protect the illegal downloading and redistribution of the films on their site by utilizing advanced technology to minimize the possibility of a theft. The film festival has developed a program, the Independent Film Collaborative (IFC)[2] to produce an international feature film directed by filmmakers from different countries. Moreover, they are going to establish a Film Market, Co-production Market, Work-in-progress Lab, Scriptwriting Lab, 48hrs Filmmaking Project, Filmmaking Grant etc.


Selection Process

The film festival selects 338 jury members representing different countries. The jury members and online audiences score the film. The film festival recruits scriptwriters, filmmakers, critics, and producers with experience in producing, directing, and judging contemporary films. The results of the film competition are calculated and based on the scores given by jury members, selected audience members, and special jury members.
