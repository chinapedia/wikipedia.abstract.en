The SCHOTTMANN HOUSE Danish: (I. B.) Schottmannns Gård) is a historic property located at Strandgade 10 in the Christianshavn neighbourhood of Copenhagen, Denmark.


History

Strandgade_10_vintage_photo.png The property was part of a large lot at present-day No. 8–14. Jacob Madsen, Christianshavn's mayor from 1641 to 1653, lived at No. 10.[1]

The current house was built in 1668. It was later adapted by master builder Johan Bernhardt Schottmann.[2] Originally from Saxony, he had settled as a mason in Copenhagen in 1763. His later works included a new warehouse for Danish Asiatic Company further down Strandgade (No. 25) and Søkvæsthuset's Bådsmandsgade Wing.


Architecture

The building is four storeys tall and five bays wide. The gate opens to a narrow, cobbled courtyard. It is to the southwest defined by two consecutive side wings, one in brick and one with timber framing, and to the south east by a rear wing. The last side of the courtyard is defined by the side wing and rear wing of the Jennow House at No. 12.[3]
