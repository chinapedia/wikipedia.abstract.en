The team is selected from the best senior club players in South Australia and represents the state in matches against other Australian representative teams. They currently play in the Emerging States Championship against Tasmania, Victoria Country and the Northern Territory. The Black Falcons previously competed in the Australian Rugby Shield run by the Australian Rugby Union.[1]


History

The Black Falcons team traces its history back to the South Australian representative rugby union side that first played in 1933.[2]

The seven-a-side South Australian Black Falcons team played at the Adelaide International Sevens tournament in the 1990s.[3][4][5]

The name Adelaide Black Falcons was adopted for the team's entry into the Australian Rugby Shield competition in 2000. The Adelaide team played in every Shield competition until the competition folded following the 2008 season.[6] While the Black Falcons did not win any Shield titles, the team performed consistently well with a number of players making the annual Shield Merit Team as a result.

The Black Falcons regularly play invitational matches against other states,[7] with the team being picked out of the top 2 divisions of the men's state league.


Notable past players

David Campese captained the Black Falcons at the Adelaide International Sevens tournament in 1998.[8][9]


Kit

The Black Falcons wear a black, red and gold kit with the letters SA on the back in red representing South Australia.

The kit manufacturers were BLK until the 2017 season, and since then have been manufactured by O'Neills.
