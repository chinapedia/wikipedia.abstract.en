NATALIA G. TOREEVA (, born April 8, 1941, in Leningrad, USSR, now St. Petersburg, Russia), is a Russian and American artist, writer, and book illustrator. Natalia_Toreeva_End_of_USSR_1992.jpg


Life and career

She belonged to the "School of Sidlin" art group,[1][2] a Russian Nonconformist movement in the 1970s and 1980s formed around the artist Osip Sidlin (1909–1972), who was a teacher in the Art Studio at the _Kapranov Palace of Culture_ in Leningrad, which she attended from 1958 until her emigration to the US in 1977. The _"School of Sidlin"_, where their teacher, Osip Sidlin, studied art under Alexander Osmerkin and Alexander Savinov, and visited classes of Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin and Kazimir Malevich, is considered to be one of the _successors_ of the Russian Avant-garde art of the 1920s–1930s. [3]

Her early childhood and school years were spent in a communal apartment on 28 Voinova Street, not far from the _Writer's House_ on 18 Voinova Street (now 18 Shpalernaya Street), where her mother often brought her on the writers and poets presentations, and where it was Toreeva's beginning point of interest in the literature and poetry. She saw there the famous Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, who was expelled from the Union of Soviet Writers and readmitted in 1951.[4] In 1961, after graduating from the _Leningrad Engineering School of Clothing (College)_ with the B.A. in Art,[5] she worked as a Fashion designer in Leningrad.[6] From 1969 until 1971, in parallel with her work at the _House of Models_, as the Fashion Designer, she was teaching the _"Design and Composition"_ at the _Leningrad Engineering School of Clothing (College)_, which was renamed later to the _Engineering School of Clothing (College) of the St. Petersburg State University of Industrial Technology and Design_.[7]

While working on her master's degree in Art, and having privilege to have her own art studio, she worked there on her sketches for the costumes, and also on her art projects, including paintings, drawings, and the Posters for the films and theaters. Her art studio was not far from the _Mariinsky Theatre_ (Leningrad Kirov Ballet and Opera Theatre), where the theater artist Sofia Yunovich (1910–1996) worked.[8] They knew each other before, and they both met often in Toreeva's studio, or in the studio of Yunovich, where Sofia Yunovich showed her the costume sketches and stage design models for her new theatrical projects, and where she encouraged her to work at the film studio _Lenfilm_. After graduating from Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy with the M.A. (Master of Art and Design), Toreeva joined the Lenfilm film studio in 1971. She worked as a Costume designer at _Lenfilm_ where she worked in different genres of films,[9][10][11] but her work on the _Twenty Days Without War_ (ru) film (1976) stands out. This film was based on the WWII story and screenplay by the famous Russian poet and writer Konstantin Simonov, and directed by Aleksei Yuryevich German.[12] In 1987, at the International Film Festival (Netherland), Aleksei German received award for his three films, including _Twenty Days Without War_ film. Toreeva has worked at the _Lenfilm_ film studio until her emigration to the United States in mid-1977. Because of her emigration, Toreeva's title as the costume designer was erased from the films, but later restored after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 (See the "Biography" secion in Aleksei Yuryevich German, where Toreeva's name was mentioned among other names of crew members of his films).

Toreeva immigrated to the United States in 1977, following the route through Austria and Italy, the path at that time for emigrants from the Soviet Union to the United States. She has settled in Illinois. In 1987, after graduating from DePaul University with the M.S. (Master's degree in Computer Science) and taking additional "Computer Art Design" and "Computer Graphics" courses in the school of Art and Design at the University of Illinois at Chicago, she worked as a Freelance Computer Graphics Designer, and later, from 1989, as the Computer Science software engineer and System analyst in IT companies. Having two master's degrees in the _Art and Design_ and in _Computer Science_, she used this combined knowledge of the art and technology in some of her art projects, as the _computer graphics_ and _mixed media_, that she mostly used for the Posters,[13] Banners,[14][15][16] literary journals and magazines, and other projects. For example, in the Bonfire for Marina Tsvetaeva (1892–1941), the Russian poet of Silver Age, Toreeva's drawing "Portrait of Marina Tsvetaeva" (mixed media) was presented as the fragment of exposition from their private collection by the "Washington Museum of Russian Poetry and Music", 2016, US.[17]

Using computer graphics and mixed media, her inspiration came from the Russian artists of the 1920s and 1930s avant-garde, Kazimir Malevich and El Lissitzky. Malevich was also the teacher of Osip Sidlin, her teacher in the "School of Sidlin" art group in Leningrad, and where Kazimir Malevich's art was the big influence on the students. Toreeva continued the principles and ideas of the Russian Art movement of the 1920s–1930s, but using those ideas in a new format and with new technology, as the _computer graphics_ and _mixed media_, that did not exist at that _Avant-garde_ art time.

In the United States, working as the freelance computer graphics designer for cable TV projects (international advertising), and later as the software engineer for IT companies, she transferred her digital skills and visions into the new formats, where she combined the text and engineering with two-dimensional computer graphics, as to visualize data for the artwork or her IT research projects. Using this knowledge, she represented the IT company in her business trips to Spain (Madrid), 1992, and Ireland/England, 1997.

She has produced a wide range of paintings and drawings, but besides that, she developed further her artistic expressions using the mixed media technique, specially in her computer graphics artwork, collage, photomontage, posters, banners, and books. She used those Suprematism elements, incorporating in both traditional and digital forms, that helped further development of the 1920s–1930s Avant-garde movement, but in the new multimedia technology format.

Style

As an artist and computer scientist, her artistic style was shaped by the digital medium and used in her computer graphics and multimedia artwork. Her interest in technology, science and art made the good boundaries between art and design disciplines, that share the visual content and communication with forms, structures and color. Mixing these approaches and using traditional and digital forms in her art is her _latest additional contribution_ to the "School of Sidlin", and in finding her own creative way of demonstrating significant parts of her artistic style that also represented the continuation of a tradition of the 1920s–1930s art movement.

-   In her _paintings_, mostly portraits, she continued to follow traditions of the "School of Sidlin", even living in the US. Not large in size, her paintings are dark in color and very carefully built, but rationally hidden by the poetic spirit, that gives the work a deep sense of spirituality. The key was to use the subject with the simple form of its lines, color, and composition, where the principles of the "School of Sidlin" continued to be applied.
-   In her _graphic works_, with the black and white compositions and simple methods of drawings, the image of the drawing with its delicate details, is unfinished and yet have multi-verbosity. It is more focused on the line and composition, simply, but stating her point directly without being over descriptive.
-   In her _book illustrations_, especially in her illustrations for the children's books, her color illustrations are opposite to her "dark" paintings. We can see her love of Russian icons with its almost flat and two-dimensional forms, and with the purity and brightness of the colors (see her books in the Books section below).
