LETYA PYANCHI (, ; d. April 1413) was governor of Prome (Pyay) from 1390 to 1413. The governor, a Hanthawaddy royal, was a key Ava commander in the Forty Years' War against Hanthawaddy Pegu.


Brief

He was a Hanthawaddy royal, and son-in-law of Viceroy Laukpya of Myaungmya. His Mon language title is reported in Burmese as Bya Kyin[1][2] or Bya Kyi.[3] Kyin remained loyal to his father-in-law who in 1384 decided to revolt against the new king at Pegu, Razadarit. Their rebellion in the Irrawaddy delta lasted for the next five years with the help of King Swa Saw Ke of Ava.

Kyin and his brother-in-law Bya Kon were driven out by Razadarit's invasion of the delta in 1389–90. Swa Saw Ke welcomed the duo, and appointed Bya Kon governor of Salin with the title of Nawrahta, and Bya Kyin governor of Prome (Pyay) with the title of Letya Pyanchi.[4][5] It was early 1390.[6] He ruled, Prome, a key province and the gateway to Upper Burma for the next 22+ years. He fought several campaigns in the Forty Years' War. He was wounded by an arrow at the battle of Hmawbi April 1413.[7] He died en route to Prome, soon after having reached Dagon.[8][9]


Military service

All his campaigns were part of the Forty Years' War on the side of Ava.

[6] _Maha Yazawin_ and _Hmannan Yazawin_ chronicles are internally inconsistent. Their Summary of Rulers of Prome sections (Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 163) and (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 214) say Pyanchi became governor in 755 ME (1393/94). But earlier, they also say that Pyanchi succeeded Myet-Hna Shay as governor in 751 ME (1389/90) after Razadarit's dry season campaign, which means the appointment most probably came in early 1390.

[7] Chronicles are again inconsistent. (Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 163) and (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 214) say he died in 777 ME (1415/16). But according to their own narrative earlier, he died before Nayon 775 ME (30 April to 28 May 1413).
