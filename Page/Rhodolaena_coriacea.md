_RHODOLAENA CORIACEA_ is a tree in the family Sarcolaenaceae. It is endemic to Madagascar. The specific epithet __ is from the Latin meaning "leathery", referring to the leaves.


Description

_Rhodolaena coriacea_ grows as a tree from tall. Its large, coriaceous leaves are elliptic in shape and measure up to long.[1] The inflorescences have one or two flowers on a long peduncle. Individual flowers are large with five sepals and five purple-pink petals, measuring up long. The fruits are medium-sized and woody, with a fleshy involucre. The involucre is reportedly eaten by lemurs, facilitating seed dispersal.[2]


Distribution and habitat

_Rhodolaena coriacea_ is only found in the eastern regions of Sava, Vatovavy-Fitovinany, Alaotra-Mangoro and Analanjirofo.[3] Its habitat is coastal and evergreen forests from altitude.[4]


Threats

_Rhodolaena coriacea_ is threatened by timber exploitation and threats to the lemur population. Future population decline of the tree due to habitat loss is predicted at 50% to 80%, though some subpopulations are considered secure in protected areas. Threats to lemurs would in turn affect the tree's reproduction due to the their role in seed dispersal.[5]

The timber is used in construction. Deforestation is a threat to this and other tree species. Due to shifting patterns of agriculture, deforestation is extensive outside of protected areas.[6]
