Biography

Career

Puig started in the aluminum industry, serving at the Research and Development division of Pechiney (French Aluminum Company).

He occupied various positions at Pechiney: mining extraction, operations management, sales and international development, in different countries. He notably was plant manager in Delphi, Greece, and responsible for international development and financial control in Sydney, Australia.

Puig joined Sofiproteol in 2012 as CEO, taking the position after Philippe Tillous-Borde’s retirement.

He operated a series of changes aiming at transforming a federation of small and medium businesses into an integrated food and agriculture company. Among these, he changed the governance of the company into a limited partnership with share capital ("société en commandite par actions"), an operation which allowed the distinction between the financial and industrial activities, and establish the farmers (oleaginous producers) at the heart of the governance.[2][3]

The transformations came with a rebranding of the company: Sofiprotéol became Avril in January 2015.[4]

Jean-Philippe Puig is a vocal defender of biofuels, and especially French biodiesel (Diester).[5][6][7]
