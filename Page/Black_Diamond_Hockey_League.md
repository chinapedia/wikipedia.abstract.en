The _' Black Diamond Hockey League_' (BDHL) is a Senior ice hockey league consisting of teams from the Western United States. Teams compete for the Joe Casey Cup - named in honor of former Jackson Hole Moose team captain who died suddenly at the age of 37.[1][2][3][4]


History

The league was founded in 2014 with four member clubs: Bozeman Stingers, Jackson Hole Moose, Park City Pioneers and Sun Valley Suns.[5] Teams played a 12-game schedule[6] followed by a single-elimination playoff with the winner awarded the Joe Casey Cup.

In the first-ever league game Jackson Hole shut out Park City 4-0.[7]

Jackson Hole Moose upset regular season winner Sun Valley, who were a perfect 12-0, to capture the first league championship.[8]

Season two in the BDHL saw the end of an era with the Park City Pioneers folding.[9] The league replaced the team with the Missoula Desperados to remain at four teams.

Sun Valley Suns avenged their championship loss by defeating Jackson Hole for the 2016 title.[10]
