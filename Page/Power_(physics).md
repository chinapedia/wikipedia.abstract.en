In physics, POWER is the rate of doing work or of transferring heat, i.e. the amount of energy transferred or converted per unit time. Having no direction, it is a scalar quantity. In the International System of Units, the unit of power is the joule per second (J/s), known as the watt in honour of James Watt, the eighteenth-century developer of the condenser steam engine. Another common and traditional measure is horsepower (comparing to the power of a horse). Being the rate of work, the equation for power can be written:

$$\text{power}=\frac{\text{work}}{\text{time}}$$

As a physical concept, power requires both a change in the physical system and a specified time in which the change occurs. This is distinct from the concept of work, which is only measured in terms of a net change in the state of the physical system. The same amount of work is done when carrying a load up a flight of stairs whether the person carrying it walks or runs, but more power is needed for running because the work is done in a shorter amount of time.

The output power of an electric motor is the product of the torque that the motor generates and the angular velocity of its output shaft. The power involved in moving a ground vehicle is the product of the traction force on the wheels and the velocity of the vehicle. The power of a jet-propelled vehicle is the product of the engine thrust and the velocity of the vehicle. The rate at which a light bulb converts electrical energy into light and heat is measured in watts—the higher the wattage, the more power, or equivalently the more electrical energy is used per unit time.[1][2]


Units

The dimension of power is energy divided by time. The SI unit of power is the watt (W), which is equal to one joule per second. Other units of power include ergs per second (erg/s), horsepower (hp), metric horsepower (Pferdestärke (PS) or cheval vapeur (CV)), and foot-pounds per minute. One horsepower is equivalent to 33,000 foot-pounds per minute, or the power required to lift 550 pounds by one foot in one second, and is equivalent to about 746 watts. Other units include dBm, a logarithmic measure relative to a reference of 1 milliwatt; food calories per hour (often referred to as kilocalories per hour); BTU per hour (BTU/h); and tons of refrigeration (12,000 BTU/h).


Equations for power

Power, as a function of time, is the rate (i.e. _derivative_) at which work is done, so can be expressed by this equation:

$$P =\frac{dW}{dt}$$

where _P_ is power, _W_ is work, and _t_ is time. Because work is a force F applied over a distance X,

_W_ = F ⋅ X

for a constant force, power can be rewritten as:

$$P =\frac{dW}{dt}= \frac{d}{dt}\left(\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right)= \mathbf{F}\cdot \frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf {v}$$

In fact, this is valid for _any_ force, as a consequence of applying the fundamental theorem of calculus.


Average power

As a simple example, burning one kilogram of coal releases much more energy than does detonating a kilogram of TNT,[3] but because the TNT reaction releases energy much more quickly, it delivers far more power than the coal. If Δ_W_ is the amount of work performed during a period of time of duration Δ_t_, the AVERAGE POWER _P__(avg) over that period is given by the formula

$$P_\mathrm{avg} = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}\,.$$
It is the average amount of work done or energy converted per unit of time. The average power is often simply called "power" when the context makes it clear.

The INSTANTANEOUS POWER is then the limiting value of the average power as the time interval Δ_t_ approaches zero.

$$P = \lim _{\Delta t\rightarrow 0} P_\mathrm{avg} = \lim _{\Delta t\rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t} =  \frac{\mathrm{d}W}{\mathrm{d}t}\,.$$

In the case of constant power _P_, the amount of work performed during a period of duration _t_ is given by:

_W_ = _P__t_ .

In the context of energy conversion, it is more customary to use the symbol _E_ rather than _W_.


Mechanical power

Horsepower_plain.svg by 1 meter in 1 second.]] Power in mechanical systems is the combination of forces and movement. In particular, power is the product of a force on an object and the object's velocity, or the product of a torque on a shaft and the shaft's angular velocity.

Mechanical power is also described as the time derivative of work. In mechanics, the work done by a force F on an object that travels along a curve _C_ is given by the line integral:

    W_(C) = ∫_(C)F ⋅ V dt = ∫_(C)F ⋅ dX,

where X defines the path _C_ and V is the velocity along this path.

If the force F is derivable from a potential (conservative), then applying the gradient theorem (and remembering that force is the negative of the gradient of the potential energy) yields:

_W__(_C_) = _U_(_B_) − _U_(_A_),

where _A_ and _B_ are the beginning and end of the path along which the work was done.

The power at any point along the curve _C_ is the time derivative

$$P(t) = \frac{\mathrm{d}W}{\mathrm{d}t}=\mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{v}=-\frac{\mathrm{d}U}{\mathrm{d}t}.$$

In one dimension, this can be simplified to:

_P_(_t_) = _F_ ⋅ _v_.

In rotational systems, power is the product of the torque τ and angular velocity ω,

_P_(_t_) = Τ ⋅ Ω, 
where Ω measured in radians per second. The ⋅ represents scalar product.

In fluid power systems such as hydraulic actuators, power is given by

_P_(_t_) = _p__Q_,​
where _p_ is pressure in pascals, or N/m² and _Q_ is volumetric flow rate in m³/s in SI units.

Mechanical advantage

If a mechanical system has no losses, then the input power must equal the output power. This provides a simple formula for the mechanical advantage of the system.

Let the input power to a device be a force _F_(A)_ acting on a point that moves with velocity _v_(A)_ and the output power be a force _F_(B)_ acts on a point that moves with velocity _v_(B)_. If there are no losses in the system, then

_P_ = _F__(_B_)_v__(_B_) = _F__(_A_)_v__(_A_),​
and the mechanical advantage of the system (output force per input force) is given by

    $\mathrm{MA} = \frac{F_B}{F_A} = \frac{v_A}{v_B}.$

The similar relationship is obtained for rotating systems, where _T_(A)_ and _ω_(A)_ are the torque and angular velocity of the input and _T_(B)_ and _ω_(B)_ are the torque and angular velocity of the output. If there are no losses in the system, then

_P_ = _T__(_A_)_ω__(_A_) = _T__(_B_)_ω__(_B_),​
which yields the mechanical advantage

$$\mathrm{MA} = \frac{T_B}{T_A} = \frac{\omega_A}{\omega_B}.$$

These relations are important because they define the maximum performance of a device in terms of velocity ratios determined by its physical dimensions. See for example gear ratios.


Electrical power

Ansel_Adams_-_National_Archives_79-AAB-02.jpg photograph of electrical wires of the Boulder Dam Power Units, 1941–1942]] The instantaneous electrical power _P_ delivered to a component is given by

_P_(_t_) = _I_(_t_) ⋅ _V_(_t_) 

where

    _P_(_t_) is the instantaneous power, measured in watts (joules per second)
    _V_(_t_) is the potential difference (or voltage drop) across the component, measured in volts
    _I_(_t_) is the current through it, measured in amperes

If the component is a resistor with time-invariant voltage to current ratio, then:

$$P=I \cdot V = I^2 \cdot R = \frac{V^2}{R} \,$$

where

$$R = \frac{V}{I} \,$$
is the resistance, measured in ohms.


Peak power and duty cycle

peak-power-average-power-tau-T.png

In the case of a periodic signal s(t) of period T, like a train of identical pulses, the instantaneous power p(t) = |s(t)|² is also a periodic function of period T. The _peak power_ is simply defined by:

_P_₀ = max [_p_(_t_)]
.

The peak power is not always readily measurable, however, and the measurement of the average power P_(avg) is more commonly performed by an instrument. If one defines the energy per pulse as:

_ϵ__(_p__u__l__s__e_) = ∫₀^(_T_)_p_(_t_)_d__t_ 
then the average power is:

$$P_\mathrm{avg} = \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T}p(t) \mathrm{d}t = \frac{\epsilon_\mathrm{pulse}}{T} \,$$
.

One may define the pulse length τ such that P₀τ = ϵ_(pulse) so that the ratios

$$\frac{P_\mathrm{avg}}{P_0} = \frac{\tau}{T} \,$$

are equal. These ratios are called the _duty cycle_ of the pulse train.


Radiant power

Power is related to intensity at a radius r; the power emitted by a source can be written as:

_P_(_r_) = _I_(4_π__r_²)
