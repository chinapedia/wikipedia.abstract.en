MOHAMMED ABDULLAH RASUL was an Indian politician. He belonged to the Communist Party of India (Marxist).[1] M.A. Rasul was a prominent leader of the peasants' movement and served as minister in the West Bengal state government for a short period in the 1960s.


Early political activity

Rasul hailed from Burdwan.[2] Rasul was a leader of the peasant movement.[3] Rasul was arrested during the 1959 Food Movement.[4] In January 1936 he was one of the leaders, gathered in Meerut, that were tasked with convening the founding conference of the All India Kisan Sabha in Lucknow.[5] As a political activist, Rasul was an associate of Muzaffar Ahmed.[6] Around 1943 Rasul was sent to Chittagong, to make contact with the Communist Party of Burma, but his trip was suspended due to a boat accident.[7]


Independence, Partition and Tebhaga movement

Rasul was elected General Secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha at its 10th conference held in Sikandra Rao in 1947.[8] At the time the Kisan Sabha was facing government repression.[9] He resigned from this post in the early 1950s, in order to facilitate merger talks with the United Kisan Sabha (a break-away group).[10] Following the Second Party Congress of the Communist Party of India, held in Calcutta in 1948, at which the Communist Party of Pakistan was founded, Rasul and a number of other Muslim party leaders were sent to East Pakistan to build the party there.[11] Rasul's stay in Pakistan became short, however, and he soon returned to India.[12] He was a leader of the Tebhaga movement.[13]
