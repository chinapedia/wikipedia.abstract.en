CASTLE NAGHTEN is a motte and National Monument located in County Roscommon, Ireland.[1][2]


Location

Castle Naghten is located east of Brideswell, on the east bank of the Cross River.


History

Motte-and-bailey castles were a primitive type of castle built after the Norman invasion, a mound of earth topped by a wooden palisade and tower.[3]

The motte at Castle Naghten was constructed to control the route from Athlone to Rindown, a narrow and arduous way passing through bogland.[4]
