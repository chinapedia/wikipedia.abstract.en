SAINT PIRAN or PYRAN (, [1]), died c. 480,[2][3][4][5] was a legendary 5th-century Cornish abbot and saint, supposedly of Irish origin. He is the patron saint of tin-miners, and is also generally regarded as the patron saint of Cornwall, although Saint Michael and Saint Petroc also have some claim to this title.{{#tag:ref|The cult of St Michael was largely due to the Norman Earls of Cornwall, while that of St Petroc was the most important in the Diocese of Cornwall since he was the founder of the monastery of Bodmin the most important in the diocese and, with St Germans, the seat of the bishops. He was the patron of the diocese and of Bodmin.[6]|group=note}}{{#tag:ref|According to an article in the 1859 edition of the _Ulster Journal of Archaeology_:

:* "...St. Ciaran, under the name Piran, [is the patron saint] of more than one church in Cornwall."[7]|group=note}}

Traditionally, St Piran has been identified as the Irish saint Ciarán of Saigir.[8][9][10][11][12]{{#tag:ref|Rev. Richard Stanton notes the following in his _Menology of England and Wales_ (1892):

:* "According to LANIGAN (_Hist_., i., 22, and ii., 9), St. Piran is known in Ireland as Kieran of Saigir, and was a pupil of St. Finian in the sixth century. He is generally spoken of as Bishop of Ossory, but the Irish accounts do not mention his going to England."

:* "Queranus, mentioned by Whitford and Wilson on the 9th of Sep., and honoured in Scotland, is said by FORBES (_Kal. of Scottish Saints_, p. 435) to be St. Piran of Cornwall. "[13]|group=note}}{{#tag:ref|"Piran or Kiaran (of Saighir)".[14]|group=note}}

Saint Piran's Flag, a white cross on a black background, is the Cornish national flag. Saint Piran's Day falls on 5 March.


Suggested Irish origins

Piran is the most famous of all the saints said to have come to Cornwall from Ireland.[15][16][17][18] By at least the 13th century, since Brittonic languages and Goidelic languages regularly alternate p and k sounds (see the classification of Celtic languages for an explanation), he had become identified as the Irish Saint Ciarán of Saigir who founded the monastery at Seir-Kieran in County Offaly.

The 14th-century _Life of Saint Piran_, probably written at Exeter Cathedral, is a complete copy of an earlier Middle Irish life of Saint Ciarán of Saighir, with different parentage and a different ending that takes into account Piran's works in Cornwall, and especially details of his death and the movements of his Cornish shrine; thus "excising the passages which speak of his burial at Saighir" (Doble). However, there is no shrine to him in Ireland.

5 March is the traditional feast day of both St Ciarán of Saighir and St Piran.{{#tag:ref|"5th March.- St. Piran's day is a miners' holiday. St. Piran is the patron saint of "tinners," and is popularly supposed to have died drunk. (However, this appears to conflate Piran with St. Pyr of Caldey.)"As drunk as a Piraner" is a Cornish proverb."[19]|group=note}} However the Calendar of Launceston Church records an alternative date of 18 November for the latter.[20] In Perranzabuloe parish Perran Feast is traditionally celebrated on the last Monday in October. On the previous Sunday there are services at the site of St Piran's Oratory and in the parish church of St Piran.

Views from modern scholars

-   Charles Plummer suggested that St Piran might, instead, be identified with St Ciarán of Clonmacnoise, who founded the monastery of Clonmacnoise also in County Offaly, but this is doubtful since this saint is believed to have died of yellow fever at the age of thirty-two and was buried at Clonmacnoise. His father is, however, sometimes said to have been a Cornishman.
-   Joseph Loth, moreover, has argued, on detailed philological grounds, that the two names could not possibly be identical.
-   G. H. Doble thought that Piran was a Welshman from Glamorgan, citing the lost chapel once dedicated to him in Cardiff.
-   David Nash Ford accepts the Ciarán of Clonmacnoise identification, whilst further suggesting that Piran's father in the Exeter life, Domuel, be identified with Dywel ab Erbin, a 5th-century prince of Dumnonia (Devon and Cornwall).
-   The St Piran Trust has undertaken research which[21] suggests that St Piran was either St Ciarán of Saighir or a disciple, as indicated by Dr James Brennan of Kilkenny and Dr T. F. G. Dexter, whose thesis is held in the Royal Cornwall Museum.
-   Professor Nicholas Orme writes in his _Churches of Medieval Exeter_, that "it may well be that Piran was the inspiration for the Kerrian dedication (in Exeter), albeit believed (as Piran usually was) to be identical with Ciarán."[22] Also, the saint of the church in Exeter was _Keranus_ or _Kyeranus_ [Queranus] in Latin documents, with _Kerrian_ being the local vernacular pronunciation.[23][24]


Legends

-   The heathen Irish tied him to a mill-stone, rolled it over the edge of a cliff into a stormy sea, which immediately became calm, and the saint floated safely over the water to land upon the sandy beach of Perranzabuloe in Cornwall. His first disciples are said to have been a badger, a fox, and a bear[25]
-   He landed in Cornwall, and there established himself as a hermit. His sanctity and his austerity won for him the veneration of all around, and the gift of miracles, with which he was favoured, brought many to seek his charitable aid.[26]
-   He was joined at Perranzabuloe by many of his Christian converts and together they founded the Abbey of Lanpiran, with Piran as abbot.
-   St Piran 'rediscovered' tin-smelting (tin had been smelted in Cornwall since before the Romans' arrival, but the methods had since been lost) when his black hearthstone, which was evidently a slab of tin-bearing ore, had the tin smelt out of it and rise to the top in the form of a white cross (thus the image on the flag).[27]


Death and veneration

Blason_de_la_famille_de_saint-pezran.svg of Saint-Piran's family]] Oratoire-de-saint-peran-trezilide.jpg, Finistère]] It is said that at his death,{{#tag:ref|"At length, however, worn out with age and infirmity, St Piran called his followers around him, and, having addressed them for the last time, desired a grave to be prepared. He then took leave of them, and, descending into it with calmness, his spirit departed on the 5th day of March, about 480. He rests, continues an old narrative of his life, in Cornwall, on the shore of the _Severn_ sea, fifteen miles from Petroc-stowe or Padstow, and twenty-five from Mousehole (two ancient harbours of Cornwall, the former on the north, and the latter on the south coast)."[28]|group=note}} the remains of the Blessed Martin the Abbot which he had brought from Ireland were buried with him at Perranzabuloe.

His own remains were subsequently exhumed and redistributed to be venerated in various reliquaries. Exeter Cathedral was reputed to be the possessor of one of his arms, while according to an inventory, St Piran's Old Church, Perranzabuloe, had a reliquary containing his head and also a hearse in which his body was placed for processionals. In 1443, Cornish nobleman, Sir John Arundell bequeathed money in his Will for the preservation of the head of St Piran in the chapel at Perranzabuloe.The Saints of Cornwall, Oxford University Press, By Nicholas Orme

(page 221)  

The churches at Perranuthnoe and Perranarworthal were dedicated to Piran and holy wells at Perranwell and Probus, Cornwall are named after him. In Brittany St. Peran, Loperan and Saint-Perran are also named after him.[29] The former Methodist chapel at Laity Moor has served as the Orthodox Church of Archangel Michael and Holy Piran since 1996.[30]

The earliest documented link to the design of the St Piran's Flag with St Piran is on the coat of arms of the _de Saint-Péran_ or _Saint-Pezran_ (pronounced _Peran_) family from Cornouaille in Brittany. The earliest evidence known comes from the 15th century, with the arms being _De sable à la croix pattée d'argent._ (a black shield with a white cross pattée).[31][32]

Mount St. Piran is a mountain in Banff National Park near Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, named after the saint. St Piran's crab, _Clibanarius erythropus_, was also named in his honour, in 2016.

St Piran's Day

St_Piran's_Cross_-_geograph.org.uk_-_63222.jpg St Piran's Day is popular in Cornwall and the term 'Perrantide' has been coined to describe the week prior to this day. Many Cornish-themed events occur in the Duchy and also in areas in which there is a large community descended from Cornish emigrants. The village of Perranporth ('Porthpyran' in Cornish) hosts the annual inter-Celtic festival of 'Lowender Peran', which is also named in honour of him.

The largest St Piran's Day event is the march across the dunes to St Piran's cross which hundreds of people attend, generally dressed in black, white and gold, and carrying the Cornish Flag.[33] A play of the Life of St Piran, in Cornish, has been enacted in recent years at the event. Daffodils are also carried and placed at the cross. Daffodils also feature in celebrations in Truro, most likely due to their 'gold' colour. Black, white and gold are colours associated with Cornwall due to St Piran's Flag (black and white), and the Duchy Shield (gold coins on black).

In 2006 Cornish MP Dan Rogerson asked the government to make 5 March a public holiday in Cornwall to recognise celebrations for St Piran's Day.[34] In 2010, a short movie about St. Piran was made and premiered at the Heartland Film Festival.


In popular culture

ST PIRAN'S CRAB, CLIBANARIUS ERYTHROPUS a small hermit crab found on the south Cornwall coast is named in honour of the hermit saint.
