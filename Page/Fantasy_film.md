FANTASY FILMS are films that belong to the fantasy genre with fantastic themes, usually magic, supernatural events, mythology, folklore, or exotic fantasy worlds. The genre is considered a form of speculative fiction alongside science fiction films and horror films, although the genres do overlap. Fantasy films often have an element of magic, myth, wonder, escapism, and the extraordinary.[1]


Subgenres

Several sub-categories of fantasy films can be identified, although the delineations between these subgenres, much as in fantasy literature, are somewhat fluid.

The most common fantasy subgenres depicted in movies are High Fantasy and Sword and Sorcery. Both categories typically employ quasi-medieval settings, wizards, magical creatures and other elements commonly associated with fantasy stories.

High Fantasy films tend to feature a more richly developed fantasy world, and may also be more character-oriented or thematically complex. Often, they feature a hero of humble origins and a clear distinction between good and evil set against each other in an epic struggle. Many scholars cite J. R. R. Tolkien's _The Lord of the Rings_ novel as the prototypical modern example of High Fantasy in literature, and the recent Peter Jackson film adaptation of the books is a good example of the High Fantasy subgenre on the silver screen.

Sword and Sorcery movies tend to be more plot-driven than high fantasy and focus heavily on action sequences, often pitting a physically powerful but unsophisticated warrior against an evil wizard or other supernaturally endowed enemy. Although Sword and Sorcery films sometimes describe an epic battle between good and evil similar to those found in many High Fantasy movies, they may alternately present the hero as having more immediate motivations, such as the need to protect a vulnerable maiden or village, or even being driven by the desire for vengeance.

The 1982 film adaptation of Robert E. Howard's _Conan the Barbarian_, for example, is a personal (non-epic) story concerning the hero's quest for revenge and his efforts to thwart a single megalomaniac—while saving a beautiful princess in the process. Some critics refer to such films by the term Sword and Sandal rather than Sword and Sorcery, although others would maintain that the Sword and Sandal label should be reserved only for the subset of fantasy films set in ancient times on the planet Earth, and still others would broaden the term to encompass films that have no fantastic elements whatsoever. To some, the term Sword and Sandal has pejorative connotations, designating a film with a low-quality script, bad acting, and poor production values.

Another important subgenre of fantasy films that has become more popular in recent years is contemporary fantasy. Such films feature magical effects or supernatural occurrences happening in the "real" world of today.

Films with live action and animation such as Disney's _Mary Poppins_, _Pete's Dragon_, _Enchanted_, and the Robert Zemeckis film _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_ are also fantasy films although are more often referred to as Live action/animation hybrids (2 of those are also classified as musicals).

Fantasy films set in the afterlife, called Bangsian Fantasy, are less common, although films such as the 1991 Albert Brooks comedy _Defending Your Life_ would likely qualify. Other uncommon subgenres include Historical Fantasy and Romantic Fantasy, although 2003's _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl_ successfully incorporated elements of both.

As noted above, superhero movies and fairy tale films might each be considered subgenres of fantasy films, although most would classify them as altogether separate movie genres.


Fantasy movies and the film industry

As a cinematic genre, fantasy has traditionally not been regarded as highly as the related genre of science fiction film. Undoubtedly, the fact that until recently fantasy films often suffered from the "Sword and Sandal" afflictions of inferior production values, over-the-top acting, and decidedly poor special effects was a significant factor in fantasy film's low regard.

Since the early 2000s, however, the genre has gained new respectability in a way, driven principally by the successful adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's _The Lord of the Rings_ and J.K. Rowling's _Harry Potter_ series. Jackson's _The Lord of the Rings_ trilogy is notable due to its ambitious scope, serious tone, and thematic complexity. These pictures achieved phenomenal commercial and critical success, and the third installment of the trilogy became the first fantasy film ever to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. The _Harry Potter_ series has been a tremendous financial success, has achieved critical acclaim for its design, thematic sophistication and emotional depth, grittier realism and darkness, narrative complexity, and characterization, and boasts an enormous and loyal fanbase.

Following the success of these ventures, Hollywood studios have greenlighted additional big-budget productions in the genre. These have included adaptations of the first, second, and third books in C. S. Lewis' _The Chronicles of Narnia_ series and the teen novel _Eragon_, as well as adaptations of Susan Cooper's _The Dark Is Rising_, Cornelia Funke's _Inkheart_, Philip Pullman's _The Golden Compass_, Holly Black's _The Spiderwick Chronicles_, Nickelodeon's TV show _Avatar: The Last Airbender_, and the _Fantasia_ segment (along with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's original poem) _The Sorcerer's Apprentice_

Fantasy movies in recent years, such as _The Lord of the Rings_ films, the first and third _Narnia_ adaptations, and the first, second, fourth and seventh _Harry Potter_ adaptations have most often been released in November and December. This is in contrast to science fiction films, which are often released during the northern hemisphere summer (June–August). All three installments of the _Pirates of the Caribbean_ fantasy films, however, were released in July 2003, July 2006, and May 2007 respectively, and the latest releases in the _Harry Potter_ series were released in July 2007 and July 2009. The huge commercial success of these pictures may indicate a change in Hollywood's approach to big-budget fantasy film releases.


History

Fantasy films have a history almost as old as the medium itself. However, fantasy films were relatively few and far between until the 1980s, when high-tech filmmaking techniques and increased audience interest caused the genre to flourish.

What follows are some notable Fantasy films. For a more complete list see: List of fantasy films

1900–1920s

In the era of silent film, the earliest fantasy films were those made by French film pioneer Georges Méliès from 1903. The most famous of these was 1902's _A Trip to the Moon_. In the Golden Age of Silent film (1918–1926) the most outstanding fantasy films were Douglas Fairbanks' _The Thief of Bagdad_ (1924), Fritz Lang's _Die Nibelungen_ (1924), and _Destiny_ (1921). Other notables in the genre were F.W. Murnau's romantic ghost story _Phantom_, _Tarzan of the Apes_ starring Elmo Lincoln, and D. W. Griffith's _The Sorrows of Satan_.

1930s

Following the advent of sound films, audiences of all ages were introduced from 1937's _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_ to 1939's _The Wizard of Oz_. Also notable of the era, the iconic 1933 film _King Kong_ borrows heavily from the Lost World subgenre of fantasy fiction as does such films as the 1935 adaptation of H. Rider Haggard's novel _She_ about an African expedition that discovers an immortal queen known as Ayesha "She who must be obeyed". Frank Capra's 1937 picture _Lost Horizon_ transported audiences to the Himalayan fantasy kingdom of Shangri-La, where the residents magically never age. Other noteworthy fantasy films of the 30s include _Tarzan the Ape Man_ in 1932 starring Johnny Weissmuller starting a successful series of talking pictures based on the fantasy-adventure novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and the G. W. Pabst directed _The Mistress of Atlantis_ from 1932. 1932 saw the release of the Universal Studios monster movie _The Mummy_ which combined horror with a romantic fantasy twist. more light-hearted and comedic affairs from the decade include films like 1934s romantic drama film _Death Takes a Holiday_ where Fredric March plays Death who takes a human body to experience life for three days and 1937s _Topper_ where a man is haunted by two fun-loving ghosts who try to make his life a little more exciting.

1940s

The 1940s then saw several full-color fantasy films produced by Alexander Korda, including _The Thief of Bagdad_ (1940), a film on par with _The Wizard of Oz_, and _Jungle Book_ (1942). In 1946, Jean Cocteau's classic adaptation of _Beauty and the Beast_ won praise for its surreal elements and for transcending the boundaries of the fairy tale genre. _Sinbad the Sailor_ (1947), starring Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., has the feel of a fantasy film though it does not actually have any fantastic elements.

Several other pictures featuring supernatural encounters and aspects of Bangsian fantasy were produced in the 1940s during World War II. These include _Beyond Tomorrow_, _The Devil and Daniel Webster_, and _Here Comes Mr. Jordan_, all from 1941, _Heaven Can Wait_ the musical _Cabin in the Sky_ (1943), the comedy _The Horn Blows at Midnight_ and romances such as _The Ghost and Mrs. Muir_ (1947), _One Touch of Venus_ and _Portrait of Jennie_, both 1948.

An astonishing anticipation of the full "sword and sorcery" genre was made in 1941 in Italy by Alessandro Blasetti. _La Corona di Ferro_ presents the struggles of two imaginary kingdoms around the legendary Iron Crown (historically the ancient crown of Italy), with war, cruelty, betrayal, heroism, sex, magic and mysticism, a whirl of events taken from every possible fairy tale and legend source Blasetti could find. This movie is unlike anything done before; indeed, considering that it was finished fifteen years before the publication of Lord Of The Rings, its invention of a vast, national epic mythology is an act of genius. And while the storytelling is rough - due to the need to insert everything - and the resources limited, Blasetti shows how to make a little go a long way through beautifully staged and designed battle and crowd scenes.

Although it's not classified as a fantasy film, Gene Kelly's _Anchors Aweigh_ had a fantasy sequence called "The King who Couldn't Dance" in which Gene did a song and dance number with Jerry Mouse from Tom and Jerry.

Because these movies do not feature elements common to high fantasy or sword and sorcery pictures, some modern critics do not consider them to be examples of the fantasy genre.

1950s

In the 1950s there were a few major fantasy films, including _Darby O'Gill and the Little People_ and _The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T_, the latter penned by Dr. Seuss. Jean Cocteau's Orphic Trilogy, begun in 1930 and completed in 1959, is based on Greek mythology and could be classified either as fantasy or surrealist film, depending on how the boundaries between these genres are drawn. Russian fantasy director Aleksandr Ptushko created three mythological epics from Russian fairytales, _Sadko_ (1953), _Ilya Muromets_ (1956), and _Sampo_ (1959). Japanese director Kenji Mizoguchi's 1953 film _Ugetsu Monogatari_ draws on Japanese classical ghost stories of love and betrayal.

Other notable pictures from the 1950s that feature fantastic elements and are sometimes classified as fantasy are _Harvey_ (1950), featuring a púca of Celtic mythology; _Scrooge_, the 1951 adaptation of Charles Dickens' _A Christmas Carol_; and Ingmar Bergman's 1957 masterpiece, _The Seventh Seal_. Disney's 1951 animated film _Alice in Wonderland_ is also a fantasy classic.

There were also a number of lower budget fantasies produced in the 1950s, typically based on Greek or Arabian legend. The most notable of these may be 1958's _The 7th Voyage of Sinbad_, featuring special effects by Ray Harryhausen and music by Bernard Herrmann.

1960s

Harryhausen worked on a series of fantasy films in the 1960s, most importantly _Jason and the Argonauts_ (1963). Many critics have identified this film as Harryhausen's masterwork for its stop-motion animated statues, skeletons, harpies, hydra, and other mythological creatures. Other Harryhausen fantasy and science fantasy collaborations from the decade include the 1961 adaptation of Jules Verne's _Mysterious Island_, the critically panned _One Million Years B.C._ starring Raquel Welch, and _The Valley of Gwangi_ (1969).

Capitalising on the success of the sword and sandal genre several Italian B-movies based on classical myth were made, including the _Maciste_ series. Otherwise, the 1960s were almost entirely devoid of fantasy films. The fantasy picture _7 Faces of Dr. Lao_, in which Tony Randall portrayed several characters from Greek mythology, was released in 1964. But the 1967 adaptation of the Broadway musical _Camelot_ removed most of the fantasy elements from T. H. White's classic _The Once and Future King_, on which the musical had been based. The 1960s also saw a new adaption of Haggard's _She_ in 1965 starring Ursula Andress as the immortal "She who must be obeyed" and was followed by a sequel in 1968 _The Vengeance of She_ based loosely on the novel _Ayesha: The Return of She_ both produced by Hammer Film Productions, 1968 also saw the release of _Chitty Chitty Bang Bang_ based on a story by Ian Fleming with a script from Roald Dahl.

1970s

Fantasy elements of Arthurian legend were again featured, albeit absurdly, in 1975's _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_. Harryhausen also returned to the silver screen in the 1970s with two additional _Sinbad_ fantasies, _The Golden Voyage of Sinbad_ (1974) and _Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger_ (1977). The animated movie _Wizards_ (1977) had limited success at the box office but achieved status as a cult film. There was also _The Noah_ (1975) which was never released theatrically but became a cult favorite when it was finally released on DVD in 2006. Some would consider 1977's _Oh God!_, starring George Burns to be a fantasy film, and _Heaven Can Wait_ (1978) was a successful Bangsian fantasy remake of 1941's _Here Comes Mr. Jordan_ (not 1943's _Heaven Can Wait_).

A few low budget "Lost World" pictures were made in the 1970s, such as 1975's _The Land That Time Forgot_. Otherwise, the fantasy genre was largely absent from mainstream movies in this decade, although 1971's _Bedknobs and Broomsticks_ and _Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory_ were two fantasy pictures in the public eye the former being predominantly from the same team who did _Mary Poppins_ the latter again being from Roald Dahl in both script and novel.

1980s

1980s fantasy films were initially characterised by directors finding a new spin on established mythologies. Ray Harryhausen brought the monsters of Greek legends to life in _Clash of the Titans_ while Arthurian lore returned to the screen in John Boorman's 1981 _Excalibur_. Films such as Ridley Scott's 1985 _Legend_ and Terry Gilliam's 1981–1986 trilogy of fantasy epics (_Time Bandits_, _Brazil_, and _The Adventures of Baron Munchausen_) explored a new artist-driven style featuring surrealist imagery and thought-provoking plots. The modern sword and sorcery boom began around the same time with 1982's _Conan the Barbarian_ followed by _Krull_ and _Fire and Ice_ in 1983, as well as a boom in fairy tale-like fantasy films such as _Ladyhawke_ (1985), _The Princess Bride_ (1987), and _Willow_ (1988).

The 1980s also started a trend in mixing modern settings and action movie effects with exotic fantasy-like concepts. _Big Trouble in Little China_ (1986), directed by John Carpenter and starring Kurt Russell, combined humor, martial arts and classic Chinese folklore in a modern Chinatown setting. _Highlander_, a film about immortal Scottish swordsmen, was released the same year.

Jim Henson produced two iconic fantasy films in the 80s, the solemn _The Dark Crystal_ and the more whimsical and lofty _Labyrinth_. Meanwhile, Robert Zemeckis helmed _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_, featuring various famous cartoon characters from animation's "Golden Age," including Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Droopy, Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner, Sylvester the Cat, Tweety Pie, and Jiminy Cricket, among others.
