ATLAS PUBLICATIONS was an Australian publishing company which operated from 1948 until 1958 and was based in Clifton Hill, a suburb of Melbourne. It published magazines and popular fiction, and the genre for which it was best known, adventure comics. It had no relation to the American company Atlas Comics which was active in the same period.


History

The company was founded in 1947 by Jack Bellew and George Warnecke, two former journalists at _The Daily Telegraph_, and Clive Turnbull, who at the time was a staff writer and art critic for the Melbourne-based _Herald_. The company was managed by Peter Ryan, who characterised the founders as "a small syndicate of well-off Melbourne lefty journalists". Warnecke himself would later describe the venture to friends as an "Intelligent Young Man's Guide to Capitalism".[1][2][3]

The company achieved a major success with its 1948 series _Captain Atom_ drawn by Arthur Mather and written largely by Jack Bellew under the pen name "John Welles". Captain Atom (no relation to the later American superhero Captain Atom) was one of the few original Australian comic heroes to have his own merchandising and fan club. The comic was originally published entirely in colour, but Atlas followed their chief rival, K.G. Murray, and switched to black and white two years later when the cost of colour printing became prohibitive. Despite the switch to black and white, the _Captain Atom_ series remained successful, running to 64 issues over the next six years.[4][5] The majority of Atlas's comics publications were reprints of British or American comic strips or Australian versions of them, such as _Sergeant Pat of the Radio Patrol_ (based on two characters of the American strip _Radio Patrol_) and _Brenda Starr_ with illustrations by Yaroslav Horak, who like Arthur Mather and Andrea Bresciani became a regular artist for Atlas. However, Atlas was best known for its home-grown Australian comics—in addition to _Captain Atom_, it published Keith Chatto's _The Lone Wolf_ and Terry Trowell's _Grey Domino_.

In 1955, Atlas launched its science fiction magazine, _Science Fiction Monthly_, which ran for 18 issues and ended in 1957. Although it largely published stories reprinted from foreign magazines, including three by A. Bertram Chandler, _Science Fiction Monthly_ also published some original stories such Wynne Whiteford's "Ancestral Home" and articles on the science fiction genre by Forrest J Ackerman.[6][7][8] In the mid-1950s Warnecke and Bellew also bought out Frank Packer's interest in the women's magazine _Family Circle_ and began publishing it under the Atlas imprint. Atlas's other publications included _Miss Young Romance_ comics, _Heart-Throb_ photo novels, novelettes of Western stories, a racing guide, and the men's magazines _Zowie_, _Fun_ and _Frolic_.[9] In 1954 all three men's magazines were banned from sale in Queensland by the Queensland Literature Board of Review for featuring sex and nudity.[10] Through its associated imprint, Western & United Publishing, the company published reprints of books aimed at teen-age girls such as its 1952 _How To Get Along With Boys_.

Atlas ceased publication in 1958. Jack Bellew had died in 1957. George Warnecke moved to Ireland that same year. Page Publications acquired the rights to some of the Atlas comics such as _Sergeant Pat of the Radio Patrol_ and continued to publish them through the 1960s. Clive Turnbull remained in Melbourne and went on to write a series of biographies, a history of Australia, and a book on Australian art.[11][12][13]
