ARCHVIEW INVESTMENT GROUP LP is an institutional alternative investment firm based out of Stamford, Connecticut. The firm was founded in 2009 by Founding Principals Jeffrey Jacob and John Humphrey.[1]


History

Archview was founded in 2009 by Jeffrey Jacob and John Humphrey. Jacob and Humphrey have worked together since 1995, during which time they have jointly invested, overseen risk assessment, and built businesses. The core of Archview’s investment team has worked together since 2004.[2]

Upon the firm’s inception, Archview focused chiefly on corporate credit and distressed corporate assets.[3] Jacob and Humphrey brought several of their colleagues from Citigroup to join them at Archview, calling it a “spin-off” more than a “start-up.”[4]
