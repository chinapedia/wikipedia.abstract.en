Reception

Film critic Baradwaj Rangan wrote, "There’s no effort in any department of filmmaking, and we’re just left with the sight of M Sasikumar angling for an easy B/C-centre hit. No one can grudge him that, and not every film can be a _Subramaniapuram_, but is a little quality control too much to expect?"[7]
