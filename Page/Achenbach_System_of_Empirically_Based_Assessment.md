The ACHENBACH SYSTEM OF EMPIRICALLY BASED ASSESSMENT (ASEBA),[1] created by Thomas Achenbach, is collection of questionnaires used to assess adaptive and maladaptive behavior and overall functioning in individuals. The system includes report forms for multiple informants - the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is used for caregivers to fill out ratings of their child's behavior, the Youth Self Report Form (YSR) is used for children to rate their own behavior, and the Teacher Report Form (TRF) is used for teachers to rate their pupil's behavior. The ASEBA seeks to capture consistencies or variations in behavior across different situations and with different interaction partners.[2]

The ASEBA is used in a variety of settings, including mental health, school, research, and forensic settings.

The ASEBA exists for multiple age groups, including preschool-aged children, school-aged children, adults, and older adults. Scores for individuals in each age group are norm-referenced. The ASEBA has been translated in one hundred languages, and has a variety of multicultural applications.[3] Each report form in the ASEBA System has 113 items, but there is not a one-to-one correspondence between each individual item across the different report forms.
