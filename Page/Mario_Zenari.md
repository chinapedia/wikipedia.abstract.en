Life

Mario Zenari was born in 1946 in Verona. He received his ordination to the priesthood on 5 July 1970 in Verona from the Venerable Giuseppe Carraro while later being appointed to several diplomatic positions to non-governmental organizations by Pope John Paul II in 1994. He was later named as the Titular Archbishop of Iulium Carnicum on 12 July 1999, while simultaneously being named as the apostolic nuncio to two African nations (Niger and Cote d'Ivoire); he was later named a week later on 24 July as the nuncio to Burkina Faso.

He received his episcopal consecration on 25 September 1999 from Cardinal Angelo Sodano and served as the nuncio to those three nations until 10 May 2004 when he was named the nuncio to Sri Lanka.[1] Zenari remained there until 30 December 2008 when Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as the nuncio to Syria[2] where he was stationed during the onslaught of the Syrian Civil War that broke out in 2011.

Pope Francis on 9 October 2016 announced that he would create Archbishop Zenari a cardinal on 19 November 2016 in the papal consistory, citing his work for the "beloved and martyred Syria".[3] He was made a Cardinal Deacon on that day and assigned to the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie alle Fornaci fuori Porta Cavalleggeri.[4] Francis made him a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches on 23 December 2017.[5]
